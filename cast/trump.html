      <div class="quote-block">
        "Bradley J. Edwards, Esq., provided notice that he intended to take the deposition of Donald Trump.
        Edwards possessed a legitimate basis for doing so: (a) <strong>The message pads confiscated from
        Epstein's home indicated that Trump called Ep[stein]</strong>…"
        <div class="attr">— EFTA00729910 (DS9), Court filing page 25</div>
      </div>
      <div class="callout red">
        <strong>KEY EVIDENCE:</strong> Physical evidence seized from Epstein's residence — message pads — proved
        Trump was initiating phone contact with Epstein. This is not hearsay; these are physical records
        recovered during law enforcement searches.
      </div>

      <h3>Lawyers Discussed Deposing Trump as Settlement Leverage</h3>
      <div class="quote-block">
        "Q: Did you ever discuss with Mr. Rothstein or anyone on his behalf the value of taking the depositions
        of <strong>Trump, Dershowitz, former president Clinton, David Copperfield, and Leslie Wexner</strong>
        as an inducement to get Mr. Epstein to settle his lawsuits?"

      </div>
      <p>The question was objected to on attorney-client privilege grounds, and the witness was instructed not to answer.
      The implication: deposing these five powerful individuals was considered valuable enough to force Epstein
      into a settlement, suggesting the testimony would have been damaging.</p>

      <h3>Mark Epstein Testimony — Flight Logs</h3>
      <p>Jeffrey Epstein's brother Mark Epstein confirmed Trump flew on Epstein's aircraft "numerous times."
      The FD-302 evidence package (EFTA01689026) contained Mark Epstein's deposition and
      <strong>complete flight logs from Jeffrey Epstein's plane</strong>.</p>

      <h3>Mark Epstein's Real Estate Connections</h3>
      <p>Mark Epstein's building housed apartments for Epstein associates including Jean-Luc Brunel, Nadia Marcinkova,
      Sarah Kellen, Epstein's pilot, and an ex-girlfriend. Former Israeli PM Ehud Barak also "regularly spent time at the condo."</p>
