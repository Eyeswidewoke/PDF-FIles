# **The Trump Administration's 2025 Agenda: **

### **A Bulldozer Through Rights, Norms, and Institutions**

## **The Year of Retaliation and Regression**

One month into **Donald Trump's second term**, the administration has wasted no time **rolling back civil rights, dismantling equity policies, and asserting its brand of governance with sweeping executive orders that have left no institution untouched.** If the first presidency was a chaotic whirlwind, this second term is proving to be a calculated dismantling of policies aimed at inclusion, environmental protections, and even **basic human rights.**
### **A Timeline of Power Grabs and Controversial Directives**

#### **January 20, 2025: The Erasure Begins**

- 

**Executive Order 14148**: The mass **rescission of executive orders** from the previous administration, targeting everything from **DEI policies to climate change regulations** and **immigration protections.**
- 

**Erasing Gender Identity from Federal Law**: An order requiring all federal agencies to **define sex in strict binary terms**, effectively removing protections for transgender individuals. **A direct attack on decades of civil rights progress.**

**Oh, but it didn’t stop there.**

#### **January 21, 2025: Purging Diversity from Workplaces**

- 

**Merit-Based Opportunity or a Return to Discrimination?**

Trump signed an **executive order banning DEI frameworks** in federal contracts and workplaces, gutting affirmative action policies that helped address long-standing discrimination.
- 

The administration framed it as “ending illegal discrimination,” but in reality, it **stripped marginalized communities of protections and opportunities** in the workforce.

#### **January 24, 2025: The Putin Connection Strengthens**

- 

**Putin and Trump Reunite**

Russian President **Vladimir Putin expressed his eagerness to meet with Trump**, praising his pragmatism.
- 

Trump signaled **doubt over enforcing sanctions on Russia**—the same country that interfered in previous U.S. elections. **The question remains: what does Putin get in return?**

#### **January 27, 2025: The Military as a Culture War Battleground**

- 

**Executive Order: “Prioritizing Military Excellence”**

Trump ordered **a ban on transgender individuals serving in the military**, calling it a move to ensure “unit cohesion.”
- 

**DEI programs were eliminated from the armed forces**, a direct reversal of previous efforts to create an inclusive military environment.

- 

**Attacking LGBTQ+ Healthcare**

**Gender transition treatments for minors were outlawed**, with federal funding completely removed from any medical facility providing such care.
- 

Trump framed this as “protecting children,” but **medical professionals warn it will have devastating effects on transgender youth.**

#### **January 28, 2025: Federal Employees Face a New Reality**

- 

**Forced Return to In-Person Work or Quit**

A mass email ordered all **federal employees to return to in-person work by February 6**.
- 

Those unwilling to comply? **Take a buyout and leave.**
- 

The move has been criticized as **punitive and out of touch** with modern workplace flexibility.

#### **January 29, 2025: The Most Draconian Orders Yet**

- 

**Guantánamo Bay Becomes a Migrant Detention Camp**

Trump announced plans to **detain up to 30,000 undocumented immigrants** at **Guantánamo Bay**—a location infamous for human rights abuses.
- 

**No trials, no due process—just indefinite detention.**
- 

**Human rights organizations and foreign governments condemned the move** as inhumane and likely unconstitutional.

- 

**Pausing Federal Financial Assistance**

- 

The administration launched **investigations into universities**, threatening to pull funding from any institution accused of suppressing “conservative speech.”
- 

**Professors, educators, and students alike** warned of **a new era of academic censorship**.

### **A Presidency Fueled by Retaliation, Not Reform**

One month in, Trump’s second term has proven to be **not just a continuation of his first, but a more aggressive, more vengeful version of it.** Instead of addressing pressing national issues, **this administration is hyper-focused on cultural purges, erasing progressive policies, and centralizing power.**

- 

**Immigrants? Detained without trial.**
- 

**Trans and LGBTQ+ people? Erased from federal protections.**
- 

**Federal employees? Obey or leave.**
- 

**Racial equity initiatives? Scrapped.**
- 

**International relations? Aligning closer to authoritarian figures like Putin.**

**This is not governance—it’s ideological warfare.**

And the scariest part? **It’s only January.**

This is just the beginning of Trump’s second term. **What comes next?**
