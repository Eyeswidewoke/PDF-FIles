# **2020: The Year of Disaster, Denial, and Desperation**

*"Pandemic, Protests, and a President Who Refused to Lose"*

If 2019 was **the year of scandal**, then **2020 was the year of consequences**—or at least, it should have been.

This was the year Trump **fumbled a deadly pandemic, stoked racial tensions, nearly started a war, got impeached, lost re-election, refused to leave office, and dragged the country into chaos on his way out.**

✔ **He ignored early warnings about COVID-19, downplayed its severity, and botched the response so badly that over 400,000 Americans were dead by the time he left office.**
✔ **He used federal forces against protesters after George Floyd’s murder, escalating nationwide unrest while doing nothing to fix police brutality.**
✔ **He got impeached (again), spent months screaming “fraud” after losing to Joe Biden, and pushed a conspiracy so extreme that it led directly to an insurrection.**
✔ **And as the economy crashed and millions lost their jobs, he focused on one thing: himself.**

2020 should have been the end of Trump’s influence. **Instead, it was the year his cult solidified, his lies metastasized, and the seeds of the January 6th coup attempt were planted.**

This was the moment America could have **broken free from the madness.** Instead, **we barely survived.**
