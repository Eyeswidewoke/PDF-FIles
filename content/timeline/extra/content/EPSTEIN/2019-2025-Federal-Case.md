## 2019: Arrest & Death

### July 6, 2019 - Arrest

2. **Conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors**

### July 25, 2019 - Bail Denied

### August 10, 2019 - Death

**Found**: ~6:30 AM in Special Housing Unit (SHU), MCC Manhattan
**Official Ruling**: Suicide by hanging (NYC Medical Examiner)

### DOJ Inspector General Documented Failures

The **DOJ OIG report** cites **systemic breakdowns**:

| Failure | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Staffing failures** | Inadequate personnel |
| **Cameras not functional** | Security footage unavailable |
| **Officers falsified records** | Logs showed checks that didn't happen |
| **Required rounds not performed** | Epstein not checked for hours |
| **Cellmate removed** | Night before death, no explanation |

### Independent Review

- **Dr. Michael Baden** (hired by Epstein family) questioned official findings
- Noted injuries more consistent with homicide than suicide
- Official ruling unchanged

### "Mysterious" Element

The documented failures (cameras, guards, falsified records) are the factual basis for ongoing suspicion - not speculation, but official findings of institutional breakdown.
