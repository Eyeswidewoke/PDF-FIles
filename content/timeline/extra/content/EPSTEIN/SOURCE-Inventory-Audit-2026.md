Inventory and Handling Audit of Epstein Case Files

Executive Summary

The Epstein Files Transparency Act (EFTA) has triggered an unprecedented release of federal records on Jeffrey Epstein, but our audit finds significant discrepancies between official claims and actual disclosures. While the Department of Justice (DOJ) touts nearly 3.5 million pages released, roughly half of the identified Epstein-related records remain withheld (about 3 million pages out of 6 million). Examination of DOJ and FBI releases, FOIA productions, court filings, and Congressional oversight reveals unusual redaction patterns, missing attachments, inventory inconsistencies, internal scope-limiting directives, and gaps between “full compliance” assurances and evidence of additional materials. Key findings are summarized below:

Proven Issues: DOJ’s own records confirm that thousands of pages were initially concealed despite earlier assurances that all files had been provided. For example, in early 2025 FBI officials insisted they had given then-AG Pamela Bondi the “full set” of Epstein files – roughly 200 pages of flight logs, contacts, and a victim list – only for Bondi to discover a cache of thousands of pages withheld at FBI’s New York office. This prompted a directive to produce all files with “no withholdings or limitations” and an internal investigation into why the order was ignored. It is also documented that DOJ identified over 6 million pages of relevant materials but ultimately released only ~3 million by the statutory deadline, citing duplicates and exemptions – a fact openly criticized by Congress as noncompliance. Additionally, at least 16 digital files vanished from DOJ’s public release site shortly after posting (including a photo of President Trump with Epstein and Maxwell), fueling speculation of impropriety. DOJ later acknowledged it pulled certain images for further “review and redaction…in an abundance of caution”. These confirmed irregularities demonstrate incomplete disclosure and possible ad hoc content removals.

Likely Issues: Strong indications exist that critical investigative records are still missing or were belatedly revealed under pressure. An Associated Press review of the initial EFTA disclosures noted “scant new insight” – pointing out that FBI interviews with victims and internal DOJ memos about charging decisions (e.g. explaining Epstein’s lenient 2008 plea deal) were nowhere to be found in the mass release. Those gaps align with what the Act’s proponents and Epstein’s accusers most wanted public, suggesting that either those records were never properly preserved or are being withheld under exemptions (e.g. grand jury secrecy or deliberative privilege). Inconsistencies in redaction also hint at selective handling: DOJ claims it “did not redact” any prominent names, and indeed the released trove includes unmasked photos of Bill Clinton, Donald Trump, and other public figures. Yet certain notorious associates (e.g. Britain’s Prince Andrew) are barely mentioned in the files, raising questions as to whether references to them were minimal due to investigative neglect or were kept out of releasable records. Moreover, the content of some documents suggests internal directives may have narrowed scope – for instance, one email (now public) shows agents scrambling to obtain a “full NTOC report” on allegations involving the Alexander Brothers, implying prior tips about politically sensitive perpetrators that were not initially in the case file. Such patterns strongly suggest that additional relevant evidence (e.g. tip reports, collateral investigations, names of Epstein’s “clients” or co-conspirators) were either not pursued or not included in public disclosures without direct legal compulsion.

Unknowns: Despite the progress in transparency, significant unknowns remain. It is still unclear exactly which materials were withheld under EFTA’s exceptions and why. DOJ lists broad categories – duplicates, privileged deliberations, “unrelated” items, and violent/sexual content exceptions – but no detailed index of withheld files has been released. Thus, we cannot fully verify DOJ’s claim that nothing was redacted to protect powerful individuals. Questions persist about missing attachments and exhibits referenced in the records: for example, an email in the release references an attachment “Hamptons2009contacts-1.docx” (a memo of relevant contacts) that is not seen among the published files. Likewise, subpoenas and court filings signal the existence of materials (like Epstein’s complete “black book” of contacts, non-prosecution agreement correspondence, and victim NDAs) that have not surfaced in the DOJ’s online library. Finally, the outcome of Bondi’s ordered inquiry into FBI’s non-compliance – and whether any officials directed subordinates to *“flag” or suppress references to high-profile figures (such as Trump) – is unknown. The Deputy AG (a former Trump attorney) insists no such order was given, but without the internal communications or the promised FBI compliance report, we lack independent verification. These unknowns define the next phase of investigation: pinpointing the “gap” artifacts and contradictions that demand further FOIA requests, subpoenas, or judicial unsealing to ensure the Epstein record is truly complete and unfiltered.

In the detailed sections below, we catalog the identified gaps, redaction anomalies, and inventory inconsistencies, followed by a list of 20 priority records that auditors and the public should target next to close the transparency gaps.

GAP LEDGER: Missing or Withheld Epstein Records

The following ledger enumerates known gaps – items explicitly referenced or expected in Epstein-related files that are absent from the public releases (or were removed post-release). Each entry lists the material and where its existence was indicated:

Missing/Withheld Material	Reference Location (Evidence of Existence)
FBI 302 Interview Reports of Victims (2005–2008): Detailed witness interview summaries from the original Palm Beach investigation, which would document victim accounts.	Expected by context: AP review noted these FBI interviews with survivors are missing from DOJ’s initial public disclosures despite their centrality to the 2007–08 case. Grand jury testimony released confirms agents did interview multiple underage girls, so the 302s or summaries of those interviews exist but were not included.
Internal DOJ Charging Memos & Communications (2006–2008): Memos or emails discussing whether to prosecute Epstein federally and the 2007 non-prosecution agreement (NPA) decisions.	Expected by context: The document trove “omits…internal Justice Department memos on charging decisions” that could explain Epstein’s 2008 plea deal. In 2020, DOJ’s Office of Professional Responsibility did review Acosta’s handling of the case, producing a report – but any contemporaneous 2007 deliberative memos (e.g. pros/cons of federal charges) have not appeared in the release.
*Full “NTOC” Complaint Report re: Alexander Brothers & Others: A compiled tip report alleging the Alexander brothers (Miami real-estate heirs) and others (including Trump and Clinton) were involved in abusing minor models.	Referenced in released email: A Child Exploitation Task Force agent emailed asking “Are you able to send me [redacted] full NTOC report?…We need to interview regarding the Alexander brother allegations.” This implies a National Threat Operations Center tip report exists. Indeed, a summary of that complaint (a 16-year-old’s account of being assaulted by Epstein and nearly raped by Alon and Oren Alexander, naming other men at “orgy parties” including a former U.S. President) was briefly posted then removed from DOJ’s site. The underlying full report remains unseen.
Email Attachment “Hamptons2009contacts-1.docx”: A memo of “relevant contacts” from an incident involving the Alexander brothers, sent by attorney Evan Torgan.	Referenced in released email: An email with subject “Alexander Brothers” lists an attachment “Hamptons2009contacts-1.docx” containing a memo from a source with contacts from “that evening and beyond”. The email text was released, but the attachment’s content is not provided online, indicating it was likely withheld or redacted in full.
Names of Epstein’s “Clients” or Additional Co-Conspirators: Identities of men who procured or abused victims (beyond Epstein and Maxwell), sometimes alluded to in case files.	Expected by context: Congress explicitly “demanded the names of Epstein’s co-conspirators and the men…who abused women and girls”. The Act mandates release of records related to “individuals…named or referenced in connection with Epstein’s criminal activities”. Yet the released files contain very few new identifiable names of perpetrators besides known figures. Notably, Prince Andrew is scarcely mentioned despite victim accusations in civil litigation, suggesting either investigative records naming him were never done or were withheld. Other known associates (e.g. Jean-Luc Brunel, Les Wexner, Bill Richardson) are also rarely seen, hinting at gaps in the roster of “named individuals” provided.
Complete Epstein “Black Book” (Contact Directory): Epstein’s infamous address book of contacts, which was recovered by investigators.	Partial release vs. known content: DOJ released a “Contact Book (Redacted)” in the first declassification batch. However, victims’ attorneys note that many names in Epstein’s black book (which leaked in civil cases years ago) were redacted or omitted. For example, the Masseuse phone list was published in redacted form. The full unredacted entries – particularly for high-profile contacts – remain withheld under privacy claims, leaving a gap between the known black book and the public version.
FBI “Vault” Deleted Page References: Pages that were removed or blanked in prior FOIA releases, often logged via “Deleted Page Information Sheets,” which might correspond to sensitive records.	Referenced in FOIA records: The FBI Vault’s Epstein files contain sheets noting pages deleted under exemptions (e.g. citing b(7)(C), b(7)(D), etc.). For instance, Civil Action 17-cv-03956 (a FOIA lawsuit) led to many pages being withheld. Those withheld page contents – potentially names of third parties or informants – were not later provided in the Transparency Act releases. They remain known gaps identifiable by their FOIA deletion codes.
2008 Non-Prosecution Agreement Attachments and Correspondence: Any letters or emails between Epstein’s attorneys and federal prosecutors finalizing the secret NPA (e.g. drafts, rider agreements, scope of immunity).	Expected by context: The NPA signed on Sept 24, 2007 (and an addendum in 2008) included unusual provisions immunizing “any potential co-conspirators.” While the text of the NPA became public in litigation, attachments or correspondence referenced therein (such as lists of co-conspirators or victim notification provisions) have not surfaced. The House Oversight subpoena to Epstein’s estate specifically sought “all documents relating to the NPA” including correspondence【28† 】, indicating expectation of more than just the agreement text. Any internal DOJ emails about notifying victims (or not notifying them) under that deal also remain undisclosed.
Acosta–DOJ Internal Communications (2017–2019): Emails or memos when Alex Acosta was nominated Labor Secretary, regarding the re-investigation of the Epstein case or media inquiries.	Expected by context: In 2018–2019, Epstein’s plea deal came under intense scrutiny (e.g. the Miami Herald expose). It’s likely DOJ leadership correspondence exists about reviewing the case or responding to public criticism. The OPR Report (Nov 2020) summarized Acosta’s justifications, but any emails Acosta or DOJ officials sent during the 2018-2019 period (for example, about reopening the case or press strategy) have not been released, even though they “relate to Epstein” and thus fall under the Act’s scope.
Bondi’s FBI Compliance Inquiry Report (March 2025): The report that the FBI Director was ordered to deliver to the AG explaining why the FBI failed to turn over all Epstein files initially, including any recommended personnel actions.	Referenced by directive: AG Bondi’s letter of Feb 27, 2025 explicitly directs Director Patel to “deliver…a comprehensive report of your findings and proposed personnel action within 14 days”. Such a report (due mid-March 2025) would detail internal failures or miscommunications in complying with records requests. To date, neither DOJ nor Congress has published this accountability report, leaving a conspicuous gap in the transparency timeline.

Redaction Anomalies & Patterns

This section documents redaction patterns and anomalies observed in the released records, focusing on inconsistencies or unexplained choices in censoring information. Redactions were expected mainly to protect victim identities and personal privacy, per DOJ’s stated policy. However, our audit found instances that deviate from those guidelines:

Anomaly / Pattern	Description and Significance
“Famous Names” Mostly Unredacted – Except Where They Vanish Entirely:	DOJ asserted that “notable individuals and politicians were not redacted” in any of the Epstein files. Indeed, many prominent names appear openly – e.g. Donald Trump and Bill Clinton are named in complaint summaries and photos. However, some high-profile associates are nearly absent rather than redacted. Notably, Prince Andrew is barely referenced in the thousands of pages, and others like Leslie Wexner (Epstein’s primary benefactor) or Alan Dershowitz (accused by some victims) appear, if at all, only sparingly. The paucity of references to certain well-known figures – despite their known connections – is an anomaly that suggests either investigative records involving them were extremely limited or that such records were categorized as outside the Act’s scope. In short, the redaction policy didn’t black out their names on paper; instead, those names largely never show up, raising questions about earlier filtering of content.
Heavy Redaction of Entire Pages (Grand Jury and Beyond):	The release includes documents that are completely blacked out or heavily redacted, sometimes with only a heading. For example, a 119-page file labeled “Grand Jury – NY” was entirely black, likely due to grand jury secrecy (Rule 6(e)). While legal, it is unusual that DOJ released the document at all in that state. Its inclusion, albeit fully redacted, could be to signal its existence. Similarly, numerous FBI FD-302 reports in the FOIA Vault files remain heavily redacted under privacy exemptions (b7C, b7D), obscuring names of third-party subjects or informants. The inconsistency lies in EFTA’s mandate of maximum disclosure versus DOJ’s continued use of FOIA-style redactions on certain law enforcement sensitive details (e.g. entire pages of internal emails or case notes were redacted, sometimes marked “DOJ Redaction” for victims, but other times citing no clear notation). These blanket redactions frustrate the Act’s intent, and the mix of fully redacted pages amidst otherwise unredacted famous names is a perplexing pattern.
Initial Release vs Subsequent Takedowns:	A glaring anomaly occurred on December 20–21, 2025 when DOJ’s first EFTA batch went online. Within a day, at least 15–16 documents disappeared from the public site without notice. Among them was an image containing a photo of President Trump alongside Epstein, Melania Trump, and Ghislaine Maxwell (seen in a snapshot of Epstein’s home). Other missing files included images of nude or sexual content (paintings, etc.). DOJ’s only explanation, via a post on X, was that “photos and other materials will continue being reviewed and redacted…in an abundance of caution”. This backtracking – effectively post-release redaction – is highly unusual. It suggests DOJ may have initially over-shared some sensitive content (possibly unredacted minor faces or explicit images) and then silently pulled those files. The lack of transparent explanation or a public log of what was removed fueled bipartisan suspicions of a cover-up or political sanitization. Though DOJ denies any effort to scrub Trump’s image or references, the abrupt takedowns represent a redaction anomaly (normally redactions are done prior to release, not after public posting).
Inconsistent Redaction of Third-Party Names:	In the FOIA-released FBI files (Parts 1–22) which DOJ incorporated into the library, pre-existing redactions remain in place. These were made under FOIA privacy exemptions – for instance, the names of middle-tier participants (pilots, employees, associates) often appear as black bars labeled b(7)(C) or b(6) in those PDFs. However, in the new EFTA-mandated releases, some of those individuals’ names do appear elsewhere. For example, Epstein’s pilot Larry Visoski was publicly identified in trial, but FOIA files still redact his name in certain interview summaries. Similarly, Epstein’s former assistant Sarah Kellen is believed to be referenced in older files under redaction, yet recent records (like flight logs from Maxwell’s trial) list her openly. This inconsistency creates a patchwork: the very same person can be unnamed in one document but named in another that DOJ released. It highlights a tension between FOIA standards and the Transparency Act’s goals – DOJ opted not to undo prior FOIA redactions, resulting in anomalies where one set of records conceals a name that another set reveals.
Extensive Use of “Doe” Pseudonyms and State-Law Redactions:	Some materials, especially from state investigations in Florida, contain pre-redacted information per state law (e.g. victim identities protected under Florida statutes). In the audio files and transcripts released, victims are often referred to as “Minor Victim-1” or similar, which is expected. However, in certain civil case files and correspondence, many individuals are only referred to as “John Doe” or “Jane Doe”, even when their identities are widely known (for instance, many sealed names in Giuffre v. Maxwell were later unsealed, yet the DOJ site still uses the Doe labels in the exhibit list). This conservative approach to redacting names already public in media or other cases is an anomaly of caution – it arguably over-redacts in the name of privacy. Victim advocates have called the heavy redaction of even context (not just names) “a slap in the face” because it obscures how little was done with the information. In sum, DOJ sometimes erred on the side of over-redaction – beyond what the Act required – which, combined with the patterns above, suggests a less-than-uniform transparency methodology.

Inventory Consistency & Disclosure Timeline

The Inventory Consistency Table cross-checks official claims about the volume of Epstein records vs. what was actually located or released at various points in time. It highlights evolving numbers and “we have everything” assertions in light of later revelations:

Date / Event	Official Claim (Inventory/Completion)	Reality / Subsequent Findings
Early 2025 – Initial DOJ Internal Collection
(Context: AG Bondi’s first request for Epstein case files)	FBI’s Claim: The FBI provided ~200 pages and assured the Attorney General this was the “full and complete” Epstein file.	Thousands Withheld: In Feb 2025, AG Bondi learned “thousands of pages” were held by the FBI’s New York office, never disclosed despite her repeated inquiries. Bondi documented that discovery and demanded immediate production of all remaining records (audio, video, documents) by Feb 28, 2025. The FBI’s initial inventory was therefore grossly inconsistent with actual holdings.
Aug 5, 2025 – Oversight Committee Subpoena
(Context: Congress intervenes, suspecting more files exist)	DOJ’s Stance: No public numeric claim from DOJ on this date, but by Aug 18 DOJ acknowledged “many records in DOJ’s custody” and agreed to begin producing on a rolling basis. Chairman Comer lauded the Trump DOJ’s “commitment to transparency” while noting it “will take time to produce all records”.	Partial Compliance: By Sept 2, 2025, DOJ had sent 33,295 pages of records to the House Committee – a fraction of the total universe. DOJ implied more was coming, and indeed continued deliveries. The subpoena also pried loose confirmation that over 6 million pages existed (DOJ later admitted ~6M pages were initially identified). At this stage, inventory counts went from vague to concrete: millions of pages acknowledged, versus tens of thousands produced.
Nov 19, 2025 – Epstein Files Transparency Act signed
(Context: 30-day statutory deadline to release all Epstein and Maxwell files)	Statutory Expectation: All unclassified Epstein-related records in DOJ possession should be published by Dec 19, 2025 (30 days). President Trump and sponsors touted that the law “require[s] everything to be made public, with few exceptions.” DOJ did not initially publish a specific count, but full compliance was the benchmark.	Deadline Not Met: By Dec 20, 2025 (the day after the deadline), DOJ had released only a “first tranche” of tens of thousands of pages, not the entirety. Deputy AG Todd Blanche openly stated on deadline day that “all the files will not be released today” due to ongoing victim redactions. He argued that the law permits rolling releases when immediate full release is “impossible”. This effectively revised the inventory timeline unilaterally. Thus, DOJ’s claimed compliance was to meet the spirit of the law over time, versus the letter (all at once).
Dec 21, 2025 – AP/Media Analysis of Initial Release	DOJ Claim: DOJ did not issue new numbers publicly this day, but in media statements officials emphasized that no substantive records were being withheld intentionally – implying the initial drop was representative. Blanche denied any political motive in what was or wasn’t yet released (e.g. no special withholding of Trump-related files). DOJ also suggested duplicates and privacy were the only holdups.	Media Finds Gaps: The Associated Press reported that the release so far was “a sliver of potentially millions of pages”, confirming DOJ had millions on hand. AP highlighted key gaps (missing FBI interviews, missing DOJ memos, few mentions of certain figures). It also noted at least 16 files that appeared then disappeared from the DOJ site. These findings contradicted any notion that the first release was comprehensive – it was partial both in quantity and content scope.
Jan 30, 2026 – DOJ “Completion” Press Release
(Context: Final large release & DOJ declares compliance)	DOJ Claim: DOJ announced it had “published over 3 million additional pages… Combined with prior releases, nearly 3.5 million pages” were now public. It framed this as fulfilling the Act, with only narrow exceptions (duplicates, privileged, unrelated, violent/sexual content) withheld. DOJ emphasized extensive manpower (500+ reviewers) and that notable names were not redacted. In short, DOJ presented the inventory as 3.5M pages released = full compliance, remaining material being non-public due to legitimate exclusions.	Oversight Counter-Claim: The House Oversight Committee’s ranking member blasted DOJ, stating “they intend to withhold roughly 50% of the Epstein files, while claiming to have fully complied”. He cited DOJ’s own admission of collecting 6 million pages versus ~3 million actually released. Thus, by Congress’s accounting, half the inventory was missing. This includes files DOJ deemed duplicates or privileged – which lawmakers view skeptically – and possibly records DOJ has but did not deem “related” enough to Epstein/Maxwell. The inventory consistency test here reveals a stark mismatch: DOJ’s “full compliance” of 3.5M pages versus the Oversight Committee’s evidence of double that volume existing.

Table: Timeline of claims vs. reality regarding the volume of Epstein records. It shows the growth in acknowledged inventory and lingering discrepancies at each stage, even as DOJ declared completion.

Next 20 Artifact Targets (FOIA or Subpoena Priorities)

Based on the gaps and inconsistencies identified, we recommend pursuing the following 20 high-value records or artifacts to complete the Epstein files audit. Each item is believed to exist or is strongly indicated by evidence, yet remains unreleased or heavily redacted – making it an ideal target for FOIA requests, congressional subpoenas, or court unsealing:

Full FBI NTOC Tip Reports on Epstein (e.g. Alexander Brothers Allegation): Obtain the complete National Threat Operations Center report referenced in emails, which details a caller’s accusations linking Alon, Oren, and Tal Alexander (and others) to sexual assaults. This report was only summarized and then pulled from the DOJ site; releasing it in full (with victim info protected) would shed light on leads the FBI received and how they were handled.

Attachment “Hamptons2009contacts-1.docx” (Memo of Contacts): This file was attached to an email regarding the Alexander brothers. It purportedly lists relevant names/contacts from a 2009 Hamptons party. The content could reveal associates present with underage girls. Since it’s an attachment to a disclosed email, it should be considered a releasable record – a FOIA request could compel DOJ to provide the memo’s text, filling a known gap.

All FBI 302 Interview Summaries of Epstein Victims and Witnesses: Especially from the 2005–2007 Palm Beach investigation and the 2019 SDNY investigation. The Act covers “investigative materials”, yet AP noted these firsthand accounts were absent. These reports are crucial for public understanding of what evidence agents gathered (e.g. which recruiters and clients were named by victims). FOIA could be used to request 302s by date or subject, now that the case is closed.

DOJ Internal Memos on Declining 2007 Prosecution: Any memoranda or emails in which prosecutors (e.g. Acosta’s office or Main Justice) debated or decided not to indict Epstein federally. These could include draft indictments, correspondence with Main Justice’s Child Exploitation Section, or notes of calls. The 2020 OPR report referenced Acosta’s rationale; obtaining the original communications (possibly via FOIA to OPR or the Executive Office of US Attorneys) would provide a contemporaneous record of that controversial decision.

Bondi-Ordered FBI Compliance Report (March 2025): The report Director Patel was required to produce by March 14, 2025 explaining the FBI’s failure to turn over all files. This presumably includes names of personnel who misled or the reasons for the “oversight.” It is directly responsive to congressional oversight of possible misconduct. If DOJ does not release it voluntarily, a targeted subpoena or a FOIA to DOJ’s Deputy AG office (which would hold a copy) is warranted.

Index of Withheld Epstein Act Records (Duplicates & Privileged): A comprehensive log or Vaughn index itemizing what documents were withheld and under which exception. DOJ cited categories like duplicates, deliberative privilege, etc. but no itemized list. An index would allow verification that “duplicates” truly add no new info, and identify any important documents being kept back (e.g. internal emails marked privileged). This could be requested via FOIA (referencing the Act’s mandate and any internal DOJ tracking lists used).

Unredacted “Black Book” and Contact Lists: Epstein’s personal contacts directory and associated phone message pads (many entries of which were redacted in FOIA releases). Given DOJ’s stance that public figures are not to be protected, the only redactions in these should be victim or truly personal contacts. Requesting a re-release of the “Contact Book” without pseudonyms for known public individuals (e.g. entries that were blanked despite being high-profile) would enhance transparency. For example, confirming whether entries for people like “Prince Andrew” or “--- Clinton” exist in the unredacted ledger would address suspicions of scrubbed names.

FBI New York Field Office Case File on Epstein (2019): According to Bondi’s letter, the NY Field Office held a trove of Epstein case documents not initially shared. A FOIA request for the inventory of that field office’s Epstein case file (case opening memo, lead communications, evidence logs) could reveal if any entire sub-files or evidence collections remain unpublished. This may include, for instance, SDNY case team communications that weren’t in the centralized DOJ repository.

Communications Involving U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman (2019): As the SDNY prosecutor who charged Epstein in 2019, Berman likely communicated with Main Justice about case scope, especially regarding co-conspirators previously immunized. Any emails or memos where SDNY sought guidance on whether to pursue others (and Main Justice responses) would clarify if internal directives narrowed the scope. These could be sought via FOIA to EOUSA or as part of oversight’s ongoing inquiry into “who was or was not scrutinized”.

Records on Non-Prosecution of Named Co-Conspirators: Documents showing DOJ’s treatment of the four women named as co-conspirators in the 2007 NPA (and any others). For example, any declination memos or immunity agreements with Sarah Kellen, Nadia Marcinkova, Lesley Groff, or Adriana Ross. Thus far, the public has the NPA text granting them immunity, but not any internal follow-up. If DOJ internally discussed charging them after Epstein’s 2019 arrest (or decided against it), those records would be revealing. A FOIA to DOJ’s Criminal Division or SDNY for records on these specific individuals in connection to Epstein could be productive.

Correspondence with International Partners (UK, France, etc.): Epstein’s activities involved multiple countries (e.g. Prince Andrew in the UK, Brunel in France). Any DOJ or FBI communications with foreign law enforcement about Epstein or Maxwell (e.g. an FBI legal attaché reporting a request, or correspondence about evidence sharing) should be released. These could highlight if any foreign government requested certain information be kept confidential. FOIA to DOJ’s Office of International Affairs or FBI records of mutual legal assistance may uncover, for instance, discussions about Prince Andrew which could explain his near absence in files.

All NDAs and Settlements Involving Epstein’s Victims: The House Oversight subpoena to Epstein’s estate demanded all non-disclosure agreements from 1990–2019 involving Epstein【28† 】. Many victims were paid off confidentially. While these may not have sat in DOJ’s investigative files, they are crucial historical records. Now that the estate matters are largely settled, these NDAs could potentially be obtained through the estate or court. If not, Congress should continue pressing the executors (Indyke and Kahn) to produce them. Unmasking the scope of those NDAs will show how Epstein silenced victims and might reveal additional perpetrators or enablers mentioned therein.

Epstein’s Complete Flight Manifests (1990–2009): Some flight logs were released (e.g. one set from the Maxwell trial covering select years), but to ensure completeness, all FAA or charter records of Epstein’s air travel should be collated. FOIA to FAA or NTSB for all tail numbers associated with Epstein’s aircraft over the years 1990–2019 could fill any gaps in logs (some gaps exist in publicly known logs, especially mid-2000s). This would verify that DOJ’s released “Flight Log” is comprehensive and not missing flights where notable passengers were on board.

Unreleased BOP Records on Epstein’s Detention and Death: DOJ did post many Bureau of Prisons records (including video footage) around Epstein’s August 2019 suicide. However, one should obtain the internal BOP inquiry records beyond the OIG Report – for example, the logs of Epstein’s cell checks, maintenance reports for the malfunctioning cameras, and disciplinary records or interviews of the correctional officers on duty (some were charged for falsifying logs). Some of this may be in the OIG case file. A FOIA to BOP for the complete after-action report or emails from MCC staff about Epstein could uncover additional context (the OIG summary indicated multiple failings, but raw records would show if anything more nefarious was considered).

All Items Seized from Epstein’s Residences (Evidence Inventories): When Epstein was arrested in July 2019, agents seized troves of evidence (e.g. hard drives, photo CDs, documents from his New York mansion and Palm Beach home). A detailed inventory list of those seized items was likely created (and parts surfaced in court filings). Request the unredacted inventory of evidence – which might list, for instance, titles of DVD/CDs (some labeled with victim names), firearms, etc. Any items not already digitized and released (like tens of thousands of sexually suggestive photos that were reportedly taken) should be accounted for. Knowing what evidence existed will highlight if certain categories (e.g. videos) were withheld due to the Act’s “depictions of violence/sexual abuse” exemption.

Transcripts of Key Depositions/Testimony Under Oath: Over the years, many figures gave sealed depositions about Epstein – e.g., Ghislaine Maxwell’s 2016 deposition (partially released), or testimony of Epstein’s pilots in civil cases. While not DOJ records per se, they are now highly relevant. The Maxwell trial transcripts and exhibits were released in part, but if any portion remains redacted (for privacy or under seal by court order), an effort should be made to unseal them fully given the public interest (the DOJ letter noted dealing with sealing orders from a separate civil action). Additionally, Congress subpoenaed depositions of individuals like James Comey, Loretta Lynch, and Alex Acosta. If those went forward (or even if not), any sworn statements or responses received should be published or obtained, as they could reveal whether high-level officials have knowledge of missing pieces (e.g. Acosta explaining the 2008 deal under oath, beyond the OPR interview).

Logs of White House/Executive Branch Contacts Pertaining to Epstein: Given Epstein’s connections, it’s worth seeking any records of contact with federal officials outside DOJ. For example, Secret Service logs of the Clinton White House (Epstein visited the White House in the 1990s), or any documented calls from Epstein or his lawyers to DOJ leadership (e.g. was Main Justice lobbied in 2007 by politically connected attorneys?). These could be pursued via FOIA to relevant agencies or presidential libraries. While not directly “Epstein case files,” they fall under “records…that relate to Jeffrey Epstein” as per the Act and could clarify external influence on handling of the case.

Oversight Committee Interview Transcripts and Exhibits: The House Oversight Committee has been conducting its own investigation. They likely have transcripts of interviews (e.g. with Bureau of Prisons officials, or FBI personnel) and exhibits like emails obtained via subpoena. For instance, Democrats on the committee have hinted at “whistleblower disclosures” about Ghislaine Maxwell’s prison transfer and treatment. Those materials, while separate from DOJ’s public release, are crucial artifacts to obtain and cross-reference. As the Committee winds down its probe, it should be urged to publish all such transcripts and documents in a searchable archive (similar to how the January 6 Committee did), or they should be FOIA-able if they ended up in executive branch custody.

Complete Set of Protective Orders and Sealing Lists from Past Cases: To identify what remains sealed, we should collect all protective order documents and sealed docket entry lists from USA v. Epstein (S.D. Fla. 2008, the non-prosecution negotiations), Jane Doe #1 and #2 v. USA (the Crime Victims’ Rights Act case in S.D. Fla.), USA v. Epstein (S.D.N.Y. 2019), and USA v. Maxwell (S.D.N.Y. 2020). Some of these dockets have entries like “sealed document #X,” which can point to items that exist but are still hidden. A particularly important one is the list of materials covered by the protective order in the Maxwell case – DOJ noted it had to navigate a court order protecting victim identities. A FOIA to the U.S. Courts (or a motion to those courts) for unsealing could be filed to release any documents that remain sealed but are now historical (for instance, any Epstein grand jury indictments that were never publicly filed or the full FBI case closing memo after his death).

Epstein Financial Records and Client Payments: Lastly, a crucial piece is financial evidence of Epstein’s trafficking operation – payments to recruiters, wire transfers from clients, donations to foundations possibly used as quid pro quo. The JPMorgan private banking records for Epstein (surfaced in the separate civil litigation by U.S. Virgin Islands) revealed hundreds of suspicious transactions. While those are outside DOJ’s releases, the Act’s scope could be interpreted to include “all investigative materials,” which might encompass financial investigative reports by FBI/IRS agents. Any SARs (Suspicious Activity Reports) or spreadsheets tracking Epstein’s money flows and payouts to co-conspirators would greatly illuminate the “client network” that to date remains shadowy. FOIA requests to the FBI or FinCEN for Epstein-related financial investigation summaries (now that cases are over) could potentially be fruitful. Even if redacted, knowing whether DOJ traced the money trail – or chose not to – will fill a critical gap in the story.

Each of these targets addresses a gap identified in our audit. Securing these artifacts would either confirm the completeness of the Epstein disclosures or expose remaining blind spots, ensuring that the official “we have everything” truly means everything. Continued vigilance and use of transparency mechanisms are required to test the DOJ’s assertions and bring any lingering secrets to light.
