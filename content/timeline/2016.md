# **2016: The Year America Got Played**

*"How to Hijack a Democracy in 12 Months or Less"*

2016 wasn’t just another election year—it was a **stress test for American democracy**, and **it failed spectacularly.**

A **foreign government hacked our election**, a **reality TV conman rode a wave of manufactured outrage to the presidency**, and **millions of Americans were manipulated into believing outright lies**—many of whom still believe them today.

✔ **Hackers and disinformation operatives** worked around the clock.
✔ **Social media became a weapon** for division and propaganda.
✔ **Trump’s cult of personality formed**, built on hate, fear, and blind loyalty.
✔ **Institutions that should have stopped it—FBI, media, social platforms—either fumbled or actively enabled it.**

This wasn’t **an accident**. It wasn’t **a normal election cycle**. This was **a slow-motion coup, disguised as democracy, designed to put a man with authoritarian instincts into power.**

And it worked.

What followed was **four years of corruption, chaos, and an erosion of democracy that we still haven’t recovered from.**

**Here’s how it all went down.**
