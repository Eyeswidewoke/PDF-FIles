# 2017 Timeline
## The Year Chaos Became the New Normal

*Era C — First Presidency / Stress Tests*

---

## Overview

2017 was supposed to be the year Trump **delivered on his promises** — instead, it became the year **his administration started collapsing under its own weight.**

From Day One, chaos defined the administration:
- **Muslim Ban** chaos at airports
- **"Enemy of the People"** media attacks begin
- **Comey fired** during Russia investigation
- **Charlottesville** — "Very fine people on both sides"
- **Mueller investigation** begins

## The Pattern Emerges

**2017 established the governance model:**

1. **Test** → Issue Muslim Ban
2. **Chaos** → Airport detentions, protests, legal challenges
3. **Blame** → Courts, media, "fake news"
4. **Survive** → Modified ban eventually upheld
5. **Normalize** → This is how policy works now

Comey's firing showed that the "obstruction" pattern from business life would transfer to the presidency. When someone gets in the way — fire them. Consequences come later (or not at all).

Charlottesville showed that the base would accept **anything** — even defending neo-Nazis — if it was framed as fighting the left.

## What It Meant

> "2017 was when everything started falling apart. And yet, it was **only the beginning.**"

The institutions held — barely. Courts blocked the travel ban (initially). Congress investigated Russia. The press documented chaos. But the stress tests had begun.

The "Roy Cohn Algorithm" was now running at the presidential level:
- **Attack** → Media is the enemy
- **Deny** → No collusion, no obstruction
- **Claim Victory** → Stock market up
- **Never Apologize** → Charlottesville doubling down
