# **2021: The Year America Came Face to Face with Its Own Fragility**

*"The Insurrection, the Reckoning, and the Man Who Refused to Leave"*

If 2020 was **the year of denial**, then 2021 was **the year reality fought back.**

January 6th wasn’t **just another riot**—it was **an attempted coup** orchestrated by a sitting president and fueled by years of disinformation. **And the terrifying part? It almost worked.**
