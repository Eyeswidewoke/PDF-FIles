# **2023: The Year the Walls Started Closing In**

*"Indictments, Investigations, and the Fight for the Future of the GOP"*

If **2021 was about insurrection** and **2022 was about denial**, then **2023 was the year of consequences—at least, it should have been.**

✔ **Trump faced multiple indictments, including federal conspiracy charges, election interference cases, and financial fraud.**
✔ **His company, the Trump Organization, was found guilty of tax fraud, shattering the illusion of his “self-made billionaire” persona.**
✔ **His allies faced subpoenas and legal scrutiny over their roles in the January 6 attack and ongoing election fraud conspiracies.**
✔ **And yet, despite overwhelming evidence of corruption, the GOP doubled down, making it clear they were willing to burn democracy to the ground to protect him.**

This should have been **the end of Trump’s political career.** Instead, **he announced his 2024 presidential run, claimed victimhood, and watched as his cult remained loyal despite mountains of criminal evidence.**

**2023 was proof that in America, if you’re rich, powerful, and shameless enough, you can break the law and still run for president.**
