# **2022: The Year of Legal Fallout and the GOP’s Full Surrender**

*"Trump May Have Left Office, But Trumpism Was Just Getting Started"*

✔ **Election fraud conspiracies fueled voter suppression laws, deepening distrust in democracy.**
✔ **The GOP continued purging any remaining voices of reason, replacing them with loyal extremists.**
✔ **January 6th wasn’t just a failed coup—it was the blueprint for their next attempt.**
