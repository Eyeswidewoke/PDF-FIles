# **2019: The Year of Impeachment, Corruption, and Desperation**

*"When the Crimes Catch Up to the Criminal"*

By 2019, **Trump’s presidency was no longer just a scandal machine—it was a full-blown crime scene.**

The year began with **a cloud of investigations**, thanks to **Mueller’s report confirming Russian interference** in the 2016 election. But rather than being held accountable, **Trump doubled down, obstructing justice at every turn.**

✔ **His closest allies were flipping on him in court.**
✔ **The Ukraine scandal exposed outright abuse of power.**
✔ **His business empire was under legal attack.**
✔ **And yet, he screamed ‘witch hunt’ while openly breaking the law.**

Then came **impeachment**—a historical moment, **but one that meant nothing in a broken political system where Republicans refused to acknowledge reality.**

2019 was **the year Trump should have fallen.** Instead, **it became the year America learned that corruption, when enabled by cowardice, has no consequences.**
