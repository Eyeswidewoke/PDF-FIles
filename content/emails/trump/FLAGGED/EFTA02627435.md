| **Subject** | PBI I spoke to TSA at Palm Bch Atlantic, Once the President departs Palm Beach area, the TFR (temporary flight restri=tion) is lifted, We should be able to land in PBI., Currently the TFR expires at 10:30pm„ the superbowl is typically 3 hours lo=g, it starts at 6:30pm„ Only a guess, Trump will leave |
