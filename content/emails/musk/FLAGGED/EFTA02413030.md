Jeff, 
Good to talk to you this morning on this subject, as it is one I am entirely comfortable 
with. ;-) 
The list I sent you yesterday has the criteria of thinkers, out of the box. These are amongst 
the very brightest people that I know, where I enjoy listening to them, and they 
say insightful things along with a deep understanding of the subject matter. 
Intellectual judgment along with intellectual ability. The two don't always go 
hand-in-hand. This is also a list of people who have a certain type of intelligence, 
but may not necessarily have social intelligence, i.e, they are a bit awkward. 
Jay is incredibly skilled socially compared to some of the people on this list. Just fyi. I 
personally am not bothered by social awkwardness, but this is your thing, and 
you would like a good mix, and that is understandable. Criteria will just be 
different then. 
You brought up Jay. This is a good example. Jay does listen, and then tends to offer up his 
own views. I very much enjoy interacting with Jay, and he is a close friend, and 
although I may not always agree with him, he does always offer up ideas that are 
interesting and worth thinking about. That's why I put him on the list. He has a 
certain way he maps the world and he is also very well read and informed. This is 
not an argument about Jay, just why I put him on the list. I would also put 
Nathan in the same category as Jay. Doesn't listen much, pontificates, don't 
always agree with what he says, but he tends to say things that are provocative 
and interesting. He has an interesting way of mapping the world too, and is well 
read and informed. I enjoy bantering with both of them, and count them as real 
friends that I have known and hung out with for many years. 
Some of the names listed are titans of intellectual ego. Steven Wolfram being amongst the 
worst of them. Others are very shy and socially and fashion awkward, but are 
amongst the very brightest and informed that I know, and will run intellectual 
circles around some of the names on this list. 
I very much like the idea of your asking people on this list to contribute names of the ten 
"brightest" people that they know. This list would provide an excellent set of 
references. 
Please note, that although I have a diversity of thinkers, I have distinctly avoided people 
who map the world in a magical way, and would encourage us to avoid "magical 
thinkers."

Anyone you don't know on an immediate list, ask me or google 
them. All arc good friends of mine for years, but these very high end 
circles travel together, so you should be very familiar with almost all 
of them. And, a few that you don't know, are off the charts, and in 
some respects smarter than the ones that are familiar... ;-) They just 
didn't seek the limelight. I have marked these people with an 
asterisk. Not everyone on this list is a scientist. 
There is no order to this list (this is a cross-section off the top of my head). I can 
think of more names if I put my mind to it, but lets start here:
