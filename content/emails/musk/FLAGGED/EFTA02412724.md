Subject Re: 
Anyone you don't know on an immediate list, ask me or google them. All are good friends of mine 
for years, but these very high end circles travel together, so you should be very familiar with 
almost all of them. And, a few that you don't know, are off the charts, and in some respects 
smarter than the ones that are familiar... ;-) They just didn't seek the limelight. I have marked 
these people with an asterisk. Not everyone on this list is a scientist. 
There is no order to this list (this is a cross-section off the top of my head). I can think of more 
names if I put my mind to it, but lets start here:
