Subject: RE: 
Ok I will process immediately 
On the topic of education I would like to ask for your assistance with tuition for my son 
He is now 
17 months and growing so fast...He will be attending a Parenting Program at Temple Shaaray Tefila 
beginning in September 2009. The cost is $2200. I am so grateful for your support when we went 
through IVF which allowed us to have such a wonderful son. We still have 3 frozen embryos and I would 
like to put them to use however my wife wants to wait 6 more months. Thank you for your 
consideration.
