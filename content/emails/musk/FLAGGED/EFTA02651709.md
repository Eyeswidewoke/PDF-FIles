Re: did they steal your idea 
Oh that? 
They have no priority rights... which is one reason they have not been able to raise money (that is what I hear at least

The first three questions I get from investors are: 
1) what is your spectrum position? 
2) what is your spectrum position? 
3) what is your spectrum position?
