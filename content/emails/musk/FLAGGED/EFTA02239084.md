It became an annual event beginning in 1998 with our first dinner in Monterey, and then, in 2010, we moved it to Long Beach. It's been called "The Digerati Dinner", "The Billionaires' Dinner" (thanks to the WSJ again in 1999), "The EDGE Science Dinner", "The Last Digerati Dinner", and our favorite iteration, "The New Age of Wonder Dinner", characterized by Freeman Dyson as the new era dominated by computational biology. He said: "A new generation of artists, writing genomes as fluently as Blake and Byron wrote verses, might create an abundance of new flowers and fruit and trees and birds to enrich the ecology of our planet. Most of these artists would be amateurs, but they would be in close touch with science, like the poets of the earlier Age of Wonder. The new Age of Wonder might bring together wealthy entrepreneurs ... and a worldwide community of gardeners and farmers and breeders, working together to make the planet beautiful as well as fertile, hospitable to hummingbirds as well as to humans." "The leaders of the new Age of Wonder, Dyson noted, include biology wizards' Kary Mullis, Craig Venter, medical engineer Dean Kamen; and 'computer wizards' Larry Page, Sergey Brin, and Charles Simonyi, and John Brockman and Katinka Matson, the cofounders of EDGE, the nexus of this intellectual activity."

Please join Katinka Matson and myself for the sixteenth annual EDGE dinner. The 
"Dinner" actually began 29 years ago at a Mexican restaurant during the 1985 
Comdex in Las Vegas as "The Millionaires' Dinner" (branded by the WSJ in a front 
page article). It became an annual event beginning in 1998 with our first dinner in 
Monterey, and then, in 2010, we moved it to Long Beach. It's been called "The 
Digerati Dinner", "The Billionaires' Dinner" (thanks to the WSJ again in 1999), 
"The EDGE Science Dinner", "The Last Digerati Dinner", and our favorite 
iteration, "The New Age of Wonder Dinner", characterized by Freeman Dyson as 
the new era dominated by computational biology. He said: 
"A new generation of artists, writing genomes as fluently as Blake and Byron wrote 
verses, might create an abundance of new flowers and fruit and trees and birds to 
enrich the ecology of our planet. Most of these artists would be amateurs, but they 
would be in close touch with science, like the poets of the earlier Age of Wonder. 
The new Age of Wonder might bring together wealthy entrepreneurs ... and a 
worldwide community of gardeners and farmers and breeders, working together to 
make the planet beautiful as well as fertile, hospitable to hummingbirds as well as 
to humans." 
"The leaders of the new Age of Wonder, Dyson noted, include biology wizards' Kary 
Mullis, Craig Venter, medical engineer Dean Kamen; and 'computer wizards' Larry 
Page, Sergey Brin, and Charles Simonyi, and John Brockman and Katinka 
Matson, the cofounders of EDGE, the nexus of this intellectual activity."
