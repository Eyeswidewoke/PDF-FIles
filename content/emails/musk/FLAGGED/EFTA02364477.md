Tesla has dominated the =potlight in EVs and applied Al in transport. Apple CEO Tim Cook views =utonomous cars as the

disrupting =utos and transport. We share the following thoughts on this evolving =opic:l. Many investors we speak with 
believe Tesla's lead in =iles traveled and data capture is insurmountable. We question this =osition, particularly at this 
still very early stage of commercial =pplication in shared autonomy. It is the working assumption of the =organ Stanley 
Global Autos & Shared Mobility team and the Tech =ardware team (led by Katy Huberty) that Apple will pursue a 
strategy in =ars/transport, an addressable market we calculate is worth many =rillions of dollars in revenue and many 
hundreds of billions of =onsumer hours annually. For more, please see our May 15th TSLA =owngrade, The Price of 
Ambition: Downgrade to EW.2. If Apple is serious =bout pursuing autonomous driving systems as a 'core =echnology,' it 
will have to harvest real-world miles on public =oads in very large quantities, perhaps in the not too distant future. =here 
are many potential ways in which it can go about this: (a) with =stablished ride sharing firms, (b) with established car
