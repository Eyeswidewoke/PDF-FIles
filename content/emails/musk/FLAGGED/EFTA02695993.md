Abstract 
Infants in intensive care units often undergo medically necessary heel-stick procedures. Because the risks of administering 
analgesics and anesthetics are often thought to outweigh the benefits, there remain no proven means of ameliorating the pain 
and stress these infants suffer, particularly during procedures. This study examined the controlled use of recorded vocal music 
to attenuate physiological and behavioral responses to heel stick In 13 premature infants via an experimental design. In both 
instances, infants exposed to music and infants in the control group, heart rate, and respiration rate increased during the 
heel-stick procedure (P's — .02) and nearly all infants cried. During a 10-minute recovery following the heel stick, heart rate, and 
crying significantly decreased in infants exposed to music (P = .02) but not in unexposed infants. Controlled music stimulation 
appears to be a safe and effective way to ameliorate pain and stress in premature infants following heel sticks.

Introduction 
Ample empirical evidence indicates that music stimulates 
cognitive, emotional, and sensoritnotor processing across widely 
distributed brain regions.I.2 The strong physiological and emo-
tional effects of music on many listeners" and the wealth of qua-
litative and quantitative findings provided by music therapy"' 
motivate the development of standardized protocols for the use 
of music in a wide range of clinical settings. Prospective, 
randomized-controlled clinical trials are needed in order to eluci-
date how music's effects can be harnessed to ameliorate suffering 
and, possibly, decrease morbidity and mortality independent of, 
and additive to, benefits related to therapist skills." Two recent 
Cochrane Database reviews have examined the use of music for 
pain relier and end-of-life care." 
Neonates, especially premature infants, constitute a needy 
population of patients who might benefit from the implementa-
tion of standardized protocols incorporating music for analge-
sia, stress reduction, and auditory enrichment." 1'13 The human 
cochlea is anatomically developed by 24 weeks gestational 
age.14 and auditory evoked responses have been recorded in 
premature infants as early as 26 weeks gestational age. I5.16 The 
results of many recent studies of the fetus and infant are consis-
tent with the notion that perceptual competence develops 
prenatally.'" Fetuses from 27 to 35 weeks gestational age 
demonstrate behavioral habituation to auditory stimuli." Heart 
rate (HR) changes in response to music have been observed 
in fetuses of 28 to 38 weeks gestational age.20 Functional 
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) studies indicate left tem-
poral lobe activation to sound in fetuses at 33 weeks gestational 
age.2' Newborns demonstrate ERP sensitivity to 10% devia-
tions in tonal frequency.22 Approximately, 12% of the US 
births are premature (ie, before 37 weeks)23; about half of these 
require immediate hospital admission and many need long-
term care. Neurological complications of premature birth 
include learning disorders in as many as 2 in 5 school-age

children,24 a 2.6 relative risk for attention deficit hyperactivity 
disorder (ADHD),25 and a significant risk of hypothalamic-
pituitary dysfunction.36 Developmentally, sensitive care that 
incorporates noise management as well as human contact and 
other "positive" stimuli appear to improve clinical outcome 
and decrease costs associated with inpatient care for prema-
ture infants.22-32
The acoustic environment in which many premature infants 
spend their first days-to-months of life—hospital neonatal 
intensive care units (NICUs) and special care units (SCUs)—
is at once impoverished and chaotic.33 Whether lying in a bas-
sinet or enclosed in a temperature-controlled isolette on 
mechanical-assisted ventilation, hospitalized infants arc 
exposed to little in the way of speech, music, and other etholo-
gically relevant sounds important for normal language and 
social development. Even worse, the sound environment is 
filled with unpredictable, sometimes loud acoustic stimuli 
(eg, alarms indicating a potentially dangerous change in a phy-
siological measure)." The ambient sound level in an NICU can 
reach intensities as high as 90 dB SPL, several-fold louder than 
the ambient intrauterine intensities the infant had been accus-
tomed to (50 dB SPL).35.36 Moreover, NICU sounds contain 
high as well as low frequencies, whereas the intrauterine envi-
ronment only allows low-frequency sounds (less than 250 Hz) 
to reach the infant. Infants born before 36 weeks may be espe-
cially sensitive, and thus vulnerable, to the effects of an impo-
verished, chaotic auditory environment because their auditory 
discrimination capabilities are immamrc,37 and they remain 
unable to visually identify the sources of sound and have lim-
ited exposure to faces and visual scenes in general. The infant's 
heightened auditory sensitivity requires that physicians and 
nurses determine the type, dose, and dose interval of acoustic 
stimuli empirically. What the optimal auditory conditions are, 
and how they could be provided in the NICU environment, 
remain unknown. The American Academy of Pediatrics" and 
the National Association of Neonatal Nurses" have proposed a 
number of procedural and technical strategies to reduce ambi-
ent noise. One study of 30 premature infants showed that wear-
ing earmuffs significantly increased quiet sleep timeo 
Another study of 24 very low birthweight neonates found that 
wearing silicone earplugs significantly increased weight 
gain:" However, there remains the possibility that quiet is sub-
optimal because stimulation with music or other natural sounds 
would promote development while avoiding the potential dele-
terious consequences of decreasing auditory and multimodal 
stimulation (for reviews see Philbin42 and Aucott et al43). Sev-
eral researchers have explored the potential benefits of auditory 
stimulation with music in the NICU environment."'" In their 
recent review, Hartling et a15 found that the researchers have 
used a variety of musical types (eg, vocal vs instrumental, folk 
vs classical), presentation methods (recorded vs live), and 
acoustic environments (eg, music alone vs with intrauterine 
sounds) in the NICU.5 Methodological consideration, as the 
authors point out, preclude a straight forward interpretation 
of how the type of music and its presentation affect physiologi-
cal and behavioral responses. Auditory stimulation, controlled 
with respect to music type, intensity, presentation, dose, and 
dose-interval, could counter the effects on unpredictable noise 
in the NICU environment and promote normal auditory and 
cognitive development via exposure to the language and music 
of the infant's culture. 
Acutely painful stimuli typically cause increases in HR, 
respiration rate, blood pressure, plasma cortisol levels, facial 
grimacing, crying and body movements, and decreases in oxy-
gen saturation (O2-sap:I?" These responses, which could 
reflect an internal state of stress, can be difficult to appreciate 
in the most vulnerable premature infants because their imma-
ture central nervous system precludes their ability to generate 
all the components of a stress response.67•4R Even routine pro-
cedures administered to hospitalized infants have been shown 
to elicit a stress response:It" A recent study of 430 infants 
admitted to NICUs in Paris found that on average, each infant 
received 12 painful procedures daily during their first 2 weeks 
in the NICU 51 In another study, 54 infants admitted to a 
NICU over a 3-month period experienced 3283 invasive pro-
cedures.52 The majority (56%) involved the "heel-s
