Curriculum Vitae 
Mark Judc Tramo. April 2009 
• Experiments on auditory perception by stroke patients that corrected a 25-year old misconception, set 
forth by Neff and colleagues in the 1975 Handbook of Sensory Physiology, and hitherto widely held by 
auditory physiologists, psychologists, and audiologists, that auditory cortex is neither necessary nor 
sufficient for simple pitch discrimination and loudness discrimination (Tramo 1990; Tramo et al. 2002: 
Dykstra et al. 2008). 
• Experiments on auditory perception by split-brain and stroke patients and event-related potential 
experiments on auditory perception by normal adults that elucidated (a) the functional role of auditory 
cortex in complex-pitch, harmony, and timbre perception: (b) the neuroanatomical dissociability of conical 
mechanisms mediating the perception of harmony in its vertical vs. horizontal dimensions in the presence 
vs. absence of tonal context; and (c) the location of interhemispheric auditory projections in the human 
corpus callosum (Tramo et al. 1987. I 990. I991,1993,2005.2008ab; Tramo & Bharucha 1991; Tramo 
& Koelsch 2008); 
• Experiments on the neural coding of tonal harmony
