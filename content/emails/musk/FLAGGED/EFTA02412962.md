Anyone you don't know on an immediate list, ask me or google them. All are 
good friends of mine for years, but these very high end circles travel together, so 
you should be very familiar with almost all of them. And, a few that you don't 
know, are off the charts, and in some respects smarter than the ones that are 
familiar... ;-) They just didn't seek the limelight. I have marked these people with 
an asterisk. Not everyone on this list is a scientist. 
There is no order to this list (this is a cross-section off the top of my head). I can think of 
more names if1 put my mind to it, but lets start here:
