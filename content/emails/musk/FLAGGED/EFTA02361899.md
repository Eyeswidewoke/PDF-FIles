Lucy Page had offered her second house to me 6 mos ago but she's on a =acht in the Marshall Islands and I can't reach 
her. Salar wants to do =t the home of Google billionaire Omid Kordestani and his wife. I don't =now them. Omid was hire 
#12, and worked at Google until 5 years ago as =ead of business. He's Larry close friend and just rejoined the company. = 
Hans Ulrich Obrist is adding two people to the invite list: Taryn Simon, = hot young artist = http://bit.ly/1uwNRS1), and 
John Baldessari, or, =nother famous established artist. He has already invited Taryn. He =nvited Rem Koolhaas, who,
