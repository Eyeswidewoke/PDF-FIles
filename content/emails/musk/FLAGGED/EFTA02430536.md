By Amir Oren 
CIC 
Tags: Mossad, Dubai Assassination 
An important figure with many followers goes overboard and gets exiled to a 
faraway village in the north. That creative solution comes courtesy of the 
rabbinical forum "Takana." But the sanction meted out to Rabbi Mordechai Elon 
should also be applied to another gentleman, who anyway already resides in the 
north: Maj. Gen. (ret.) Meir Dagan, the belligerent, heavy-handed chief of the 
Mossad. 
The State of Israel did not claim responsibility for the assassination of Mahmoud 
al-Mabhouh in Dubai. The entire matter is treated as AFMR - According to 
Foreign Media Reports. We can still argue both sides of the broader issue at 
hand: assassinating senior officials in hotels (see under Rehavam Ze'evi) and in 
public (Imad Mughniyeh, Fathi Shkaki, Abbas Mussawi, Ali Hassan Salameh, and 
the list goes on). But we could also narrow the question to the quality of the 
performance in Dubai. And what must have seemed to its perpetrators as a huge 
success is now being overshadowed by enormous question marks. 
If the perpetrators were from the Mossad (AFMR, of course), Prime Minister 
Benjamin Netanyahu must be walking around with an acute sense of deja vu. 
Once again, an assassination of a senior Hamas leader in a friendly Arab country; 
once again, an operation designed to kill someone quietly and inconspicuously; 
once again, a diplomatic mess; and once again, it is all happening on 
Netanyahu's watch. In 1997, it was Khaled Meshal in Jordan. This time, it's 
Mabhouh in Dubai.

The anticipated diplomatic crisis is not, so far, with Dubai, but with the countries 
whose passports were used by the assassins. The United Kingdom and Ireland 
were used once again, and this time, a French connection topped it off. It is as if 
Israeli govemments had never apologized to London for using British 
documentation; as if they had not promised solemnly, when passports of Her 
Majesty's subjects were found in a certain phone booth, that this would never 
happen again.
