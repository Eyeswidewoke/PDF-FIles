Advising 
As you now know I'm deciding among a few nice places that have approached me and 
had discussed with John some of the pros and cons. I hadn't actually read the 
letter when he sent it( or known that he would send it) but based on the 
responses I do think there has been some misunderstanding and I certainly hadn't 
intended to approach everyone with all this information. 
I am trying to be sure I will have a group in my field to work with during the 
(hopefully) exciting scientific times in the next few years. 
What I had told John was that it seemed odd to have the decision made by an 
NYU donor. Although the Caltech group has tremendous potential to be one of the 
major LHC research centers, it is small and I wanted to investigate whether that 
was a given or could be remedied by some external support so that I could create 
a truly great research environment, which is why I had contacted both John and 
Charles. It's an exciting time with the LHC and John and Charles both know this. 
In any case thank you for taking an interest. It is encouraging. 
Best, Lisa 
PS I don't know which is worse: easy or not easy.:) In any case just trying to
