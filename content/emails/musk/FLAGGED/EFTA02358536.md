| **Subject** | Greg Brown's Weekend Reading and Other Things.. 04/16/2017 DEAR FRIEND <=div> Obesity's hefty price tag America's heaviest city grapples with costs from weight-loss surgery =o extra-wide hospital beds. <=r> <=p> =n a recent article in Politico Magazine by Beth Baker she=describes the operation above of a 30 year-old 330 pound female patient =E24140, considered "morbidly obese" 40=93 with two gaping hernias holes torn in the abdominal sac that holds the =ody's major organs, as "The belly wall is not designed to =old this much weight," said by her Baptist Memphis Hospital, surge=n George Woodman. By the operation's end, most of the patient*=804>s stomach was trimmed away, leaving a much smaller "gas=ric sleeve" that will allow her to feel full after eating =nly small amounts of food. Removing a portion of the stomach also suppress=s the hormones that stimulate hunger. The operation (known as a laparoscopic sleeve gastrectom=) is now the most common type of weight-loss surgery performed in=the U.S. Woodman has conducted 6,000 gastric sleeve operations, and =id three more that morning. Memphis is the heaviest metropolitan cit= in the country, with an adult obesity rate of about 36 percent — =pproaching the rate of more than 40 percent that researchers say we4i=99II reach by 2030, if current trends continue. "There is an unlimited number of patients," he sai=. EFTA_R1_01345793 EFTA02358536 Memphis may be the heaviest city in the country, but it isn't mu=h of an outlier. From the trimmest state, Colorado, to the most obese, Mis=issippi, the entire nation has been on a perilous—and costly*=94upward track when it comes to extreme weight gain. Severe obesity <=span>(a BMI of 40 or more) — the kind most harmful to individual well-being and expen=ive to society — is rising at an alarming rate and may affect 11 p=rcent of U.S. adults by 2030. Dieting and exercise are the prescription fo= most Americans who want to lose weight, but only a minority succeed.t>=A0 Woodman estimates that just 3 percent of his morbidly obese patients co=ld lose their excess weight on their own, so for most, bariatric surgery i= a last-resort option. With luck, this patient will lose about 75 percent =f her excess weight, putting her on track to a healthier future. 0=804fleople say that obesity is self-induced," Woodman said. 4k=A0"But it doesn't matter. We have to do something about it=" Every five days, Woodman holds a seminar for prospective patient=. On a recent Saturday, 60 people showed up. Perhaps one-third would=follow through with surgery. For some, Medicare, Medicaid, or private insu=ers will pay, calculating that the price of the surgery is less than the c=st of a lifetime of chronic disease. At Baptist Memphis, the operati=n costs $14,000 — the cost is often higher elsewhere, $25,000 or m=re. That may seem expensive, but it could be a bargain compared with=the estimated $200,000 in excess medical costs obese Americans can rack up=over their lifetimes. Memphis has the highest obesity rate among U.S. citi=s, and its appetite for unhealthy food is part of the reason. <1=> Pedestrians on Beale Street take in the sights, top,=including the day's menu at B.B. King's famous blues club, left.=C24, At right, spectators wait for the city's famous Mardi Gras parad= to pass by. As American waistbands continue t= expand, researchers and policymakers are trying to figure out just what t=e obesity epidemic is going to cost the nation. There are the direct=medical costs of treating obesity-related diseases including Type 2 diabet=s, heart disease and stroke, high blood pressure, arthritis, and related c=ncers, among others. And then there are the indirect costs: lost productiv=ty, more illness, extra infrastructure to handle heavier patients and resi=ents. These bills are already coming due in Memphis. Last year, extr= health care costs from obesity were $538 million — more than half=the budget of the city's public school system, according to Gallup=Healthways Well-Being Index. For the state of Tennessee, the annual =xcess health costs of obesity were $2.29 billion — equivalent to m=re than 6 percent of the entire state budget. No matter how many sur=eries Woodman conducts, he won't make a dent; many more Americans =re tipping the scales into the obese range each year. 2 EFTA_R1_01345794 EFTA02358537 Endocrinologist Ja= Cohen, who treats many patients with obesity-caused diabetes, estimates t=at the average diabetic patient costs the health care system triple what a=healthy person costs. Add in their lost productivity and the price t=g skyrockets. "It's politically imperative to reduce=the obesity rate," said Cohen. Nationally, "it costs literally tr=llions of dollars to treat these conditions." AS COSTLY AS the o=esity problem is now, its set to get worse. The baby boom generation=is the fattest on record, and they are just reaching the age where health =roblems begin to mount. Federal and state officials are growing incr=asingly worried about the steep price the country will pay for its weight =roblem. In West Virginia, one of the most obese states, public health comm=ssioner Rahul Gupta says the preventable direct medical costs of obesity a=e $1.4 billion to $1.8 billion a year, with an additional $5 billion in in=irect costs, such as lost productivity. Obese patients submit up to =even times the number of medical claims compared with normal-weight patien=s, he said. "At the state and federal levels, chronic diseas= burden is among the largest drivers of health care costs/4k=99 Gupta said, "and among chronic diseases it comes down to the conse=uences of obesity and tobacco." c=pan style="font-size:12ptline-height:17.12px;font-family:georgia,serif"= And then there are the national co=ts. Zhou Yang, a professor at Emory University who studies the impact of o=esity on the medical system, found that obese older males spent $190,657 m=re on lifetime health care expenses than their normal weight peers while o=der obese women spent $223,629 more. A 2016 meta-analysis by Univers=ty of Washington researchers found that annual medical spending attributed=to obesity nationally was nearly $150 billion — more than four tim=s the federal budget for foreign aid and nearly enough to fund the entire =.S. Department of Veterans Affair=. Other potential costs are harder to quantify but no less worrisome, for =atients, taxpayers and society at large. For example, researchers ar= discovering that vaccines may not be as effective in those who are obese.=C24> Studies have found that obese patients do not respond as well to the=HIV vaccine and the flu vaccine, leaving them more vulnerable to infection=— and to passing those diseases on to others. Over time, it4k=99s possible that a community's "herd immunity" co=ld suffer, creating the conditions for the return of diseases that were on=e controlled through immunization—and that could affect us all, ac=ording to an analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientists. Even the milita=y is affected, as recruiters struggle to find enough soldiers who meet fit=ess requirements. The percentage of overweight and obese young men doubled=over a 50-year period and tripled for young women. According to a st=dy by the National Bureau of Economic Research, Navy recruits who were ove=weight were more likely than their normal-weight peers to fail semiannual =hysical readiness tests. In all, overweight and obese active 3 EFTA_R1_01345795 EFTA02358538 duty mi=itary personnel cost the taxpayer $105 million a year in lost productivity= and $1 billion annually on treating obesity-related illness —more=than treating military tobacco and alcohol-related illness combined, NBER =stimated. Transportation costs, too, are rising, and not only for obese pa=sengers who must purchase two seats to fly. Researchers at the Unive=sity of Illinois estimated that 1 billion additional gallons of gasoline a=e consumed in the U.S. each year to ferry overweight and obese car passeng=rs from place to place. One study estimated that U.S. airlines purch=sed 350 million more gallons of jet fuel because of the number of heavier =assengers. Obesity also affects the bottom line of employers. Obesit= contributes to absenteeism and "presenteeism," whe= people show up but are less productive. Based on current trends, the cost=of obesity in lost economic productivity by 2030 will be between $390 bill=on and $520 billion annually. Obese employees may suffer financially as we=l. A 2010 study found that white women had 9 percent lower wag=s because of obesity, "equivalent in absolute value to the wage ef=ect of roughly 1.5 years of education or three years of work experience.=E2$4 A study in the Journal of Health Economics found that some =mployers pay lower wages to obese workers to cover higher insurance costs.=/span> c=pan style="font-size:12ptline-height:17.12pr,font-family:georgia,serif"=Even the cost of dying is higher for obese people. Companies like Go=iath Caskets specialize in funeral products for the obese — for a =rice. Everything from wider grave plots to specialized hearses with reinfa=ced chassis and heavy-duty lifting equipment must be used. Crematories are=widening furnace doors and chambers to accommodate very large bodies.4,=A0 A "supersize" funeral costs between $800 and $3,=oo more, notes U.S. Funerals Online. "The costs are not just rela=ed to health care," said Gupta. "There's a cost fo= people who can't reach their full potential in terms of education= employment, mobility, physical activity and productivity."=/p> AT BAPTIST MEMPHIS, case m=nagers Bonnie Jeter and Phyllis Lutz see the costly impact of obesity in t=e long-term acute care hospital, a special wing for critically ill patient=. When Jeter began as a case manager 27 years ago, obesity was rare.=C2.> Today, some 40 to 50 percent of the patients she sees are obese or =E204>super obese." Before opening this special win=, the rooms had to be retrofitted with hydraulic ceiling lifts and wider d=orways because of the large number of obese patients. On a tour of t=e unit, Jeter and Lutz led visitors to the bathing room. They cannot=lift their most obese patients into the extra-large tub, so these patients=must be given sponge baths. The large toilet is mounted on the floor= rather than the wall, to hold heavy patients. 4 EFTA_R1_01345796 EFTA02358539 "It can take three =eople to turn a super obese patient," said Lutz. Patients mu=t be turned every two hours to prevent pressure ulcers, in addition to bei=g moved for wound care, bed baths, and other needs. To make matters =orse, "We don't have any more staff [to handle obese patients]," sh= said. These patients face numerous complex medical problems. Q=9CThey take longer to get better," said Jeter. "Ther= are a lot of complications—diabetes, renal failure, terrible skin=wounds, circulatory issues, cellulitis, breathing difficulties." =C240Providing care is not incrementally more difficult, she said, 4>=9Cles a quantum leap." Not surprisingly, pati=nts often grow depressed and unmotivated. 'They're d=ing younger and younger," said Jeter. "It's horrif=c." To accommodate the many obese patients, Baptist Memphis Hospit=l has had to install extra-wide hospital doors. Bariatric surgeon Ge=rge Woodman, right, talks with patient Dana Brown one day after she receiv=d gastric sleeve surgery to shrink the size of her stomach. Then the=e's the discharge planning for patients ready for release. Nursing=homes and dialysis clinics can be hard to find. "Some [clinics] have a 350-po=nd size limit," said Jeter. She and Lutz must plan far ahead=to locate places to send the patients. =br> Usually, hospitals must eat the cos= for expensive bariatric equipment. A mechanical lift that can hold up to =00 pounds costs $6,000 — a bariatric lift, for up to 1,000 pounds,=$13,000. A standard hospital bed runs $8,000 compared with a large b=d for $45,000. Everything from larger blood pressure cuffs to wheelchairs,=stretchers, waiting room chairs and patient gowns must be on hand. Y=t health care providers cannot charge insurers for these costs. =p class="MsoNormal"> 4>=804,Obesity is one of the most urgent public health problems in our natio= today," said Jay Bhatt, chief medical officer of the American Hos=ital Association. In addition to equipment costs, he said, hospitals=pay for special safety training for workers. Nurse's aides r=nk 4th nationally in job injuries, behind police officers, jailers and fir=fighters, in part due to lifting heavy patients. Nursing homes face many o= the same challenges, said Cheryl Phillips, senior vice president for Publ=c Policy and Health Services for Leading Age, the trade association of non=rofit nursing homes. "We are arguing for better reimbursemen= that is risk-adjusted," said Phillips. "Medicaid do=sn't even meet the costs for much of the care—obesity is b=t one example." According to research by Yang, overweight an= obese baby boomers will spend 1.3 billion more days in long- term care tha= previous generations, costing Medicaid at least $68 billion. 5 EFTA_R1_01345797 EFTA02358540 At the end of a workday, she an= pediatrician-in-chief Jon McCullers sit in his office to reflect on the o=esity epidemic. McCullers was an infectious disease researcher until=five years ago, when he was recruited to Le Bonheur. "It was=obvious that my research wasn't what they needed," he said= High poverty levels in Memphis led to a host of urgent problems...A0 Topping the list was obesity. With an infusion of state and hospi=al funding, he launched the obesity program, which combines research, comm=nity outreach and a Healthy Lifestyle clinic. Most of the program*=8040s $3.5 million annual budget is not covered by patient insurance. Wha= is the goal? "Not to be the worst in the country," McCull=rs said wryly. The clinic has served 650 high-risk kids since opening in =ctober 2014, the majority African-American girls. For these children= a healthy lifestyle can be a new concept. Through surveys, Han.=8040s team found that two-thirds of the families they serve are considere= "food insecure," despite their obesity. "So=it's the types of foods they're eating — high in f=t, high in sugar," she said. As for exercise, Han, whose own=children go to Memphis public schools said gym class is held in the hallwa=s, if at all. Despite the immensity of the problem, Han and McCullers tr= to be hopeful. Nationally, the prevalence of obesity has remained s=able for children and teens, and the rate decreased significantly among pr=schoolers in 2013.2014, according to the Centers for Disease Control and P=evention. "We know we can make the obesity rate plateau4=804> said Han. "Now we need to make it reverse." Th= challenge is finding creative ways to connect with people where they live= "Most hospitals look at who is inside their walls,"=said McCullers. "You have to look outside your walls, and be=engaged with local and state governments and community groups." Ul=imately, they said, its clear obesity has stopped being a problem for only=those affected and is now a national crisis. The country literally c=nnot afford the impending costs. Shifting investments toward encoura=ing healthy environments and behaviors rather than paying for expensive, l=fe-threatening chronic disease is the only affordable — and humane=— response. "Obesity costs everybody,Q=9D said Yang. "Nobody can escape. Someone has to pa= the bill." =/p> So True The Reality of an American being Killed by an Illegal Immigrant 6 EFTA_R1_01345798 EFTA02358541 So Why are so many People T=rrified of Illegal Immigrants?

But no one does. The U.S. milit=ry remains in a league of its o None of the difficulties the United States=has faced over the past 25 years has been in any way because its military =as too small or weak.

The U.S. defense budget in 2015 was nine times the siz= of Russia's and three times that of China's. 7 EFTA_R1_01345799 EFTA02358542 More =mportantly President Trump is proposing dramatically increasing our nuclea= arsenal, as if this will somehow dissuade ISIS and other terrorist. =Also Trump is stuck in the 20th Century advocating large m=litary programs like aircraft carriers who are useless against a group of =ad guys with a dirty bomb or an adversary intent to poison our water suppl= or hack into banking system or election.

Estimates of just how much of our national de=t payments are from past military spending vary wildly. In 2007, economist=Robert Higgs calculated it like this: I added up all past deficits (minus surpluses) since 1916 (whe= the debt was nearly zero), prorated according to each year's ratio of=narrowly defined national security spending--military, veterans, and inter=ational affairs--to total federal spending, expressing everything in dolla=s of constant purchasing power. This sum is equal to 91.2 percent of the v=Iue of the national debt held by the public at the end of 2006. Therefore,=l attribute that same percentage of the government's net interest outl=ys in that year to past debt-financed defense spending. When Higgs did tha= analysis four years later, he came up with a figure of $206.7 billion jus= in interest payments on our past military adventures. And most peop=e see this number as extremely conservative. Fareed Zakaria tells a story =hat he was surprise by the answer that General David Petraeus told him dur=ng the early days of the Iraq War and things were not going well. Wh=n asked whether he wished he had more troops. Petraeus was too polit=cally savvy to criticize the Donald Rumsfeld "light footprint*=8* strategy, so he deflected the question, answering it a different way= "I wish we had more Foreign Service officers, aid professionals a=d other kinds of non- military specialists," he said. The heart of =he problem the United States was facing in Iraq, he noted presciently, was=a deep sectarian divide between Shiite and Sunni, Arab and Kurd. "=e need help on those issues. Otherwise, we're relying 9 EFTA_R1_01345801 EFTA02358544 on 22-year-o=d sergeants to handle them. Now, they are great kids, but they really don=E2Q4H know the history, the language, the politics." I understand the need fo= a strong national defense but when you are already spending more than the=combined military budgets of the next largest countries, it is difficult t= believe that our military spending is bloated and more importantly full w=th wasteful boondoggles that suck the resources that we better use non-mil=tary specialists, foreign aid and diplomacy. As I use to say during =he Vietnam War, "if we had given the Viet Cong televisions instead=of dropping bombs the war would have ended years earlier." A= such throwing more money in an already bloated military is not only waste=ul it is dereliction to the fiduciary responsibility that our government o=es its citizens. Someone Has Got To Be Kidding? <=pan style="font-size:12ptline-height:107%;font-family:georgia,serif"> It is often =aid that Wall Street (the=financial markets) is a casino, but after this week I would label it the ultimate Ponzi Scheme (named after Charles Ponzi who=e company, Securities Exchange Company, in 1919 promised returns of 50% in 45 days or =00% in 90 days out of monies from newer investors) — after hearin= that Tesla Corporation surpassed Ford Motor Company in value. But how can =his be possible? One company is an automotive titan that has built more that 350 million vehicles over the past 115 years with 201,000 employees, sales of 6.6 million vehicles, annual revenues $152 billion and profits of $10.4 billion last year. And the other is only 15 years old, with 30,000 employees, sales of 76,000 vehicles, revenues of $7 billion, pre-tax loss of $746 million and has neve= made a profit. Yet the 15 year-old Tesla is now valued more than Ford. =br> Someone is crazy. =/font> Even if one were=to believe that Tesla has a more promising future, numbers don't lie. And yet a 7% surge in the value of shares in electric car firm Tesla a week ago Monday s=w it zoom ahead of Ford Motor Company, in terms of its stock market value..=A0 As Wall Street closed for the day, Tesla, led by 45-year-old tycoon and futurist Elon Musk, was worth $49bn (E38bn), compared with a pal=ry $46bn for the empire built by Henry Ford. This astonishing overtaking maneuver says as much about the nature of stock mark=ts as it does about these two very different carmakers. The old 10 EFTA_R1_01345802 EFTA02358545 clichl>=A9 among stock market investors is that you should "buy on the rumor, sell on the fact" — the idea that investment is more ab=ut what you expect to happen in the future than the current state of play — obviously =his is the case with Tesla. While Tesla's investors believe that it is th= standard-bearer of a battery-powered future — and Ford is the archetypal mass-produ=tion legacy car business. That is the myth that CEO Elon Musk carefully crafted for thirty-something year old Wall Street analysists who can afford to buy a $100,000 car. But as someone who j=st leased a Chevy Bolt, I did so because it was half the price of an entry level Tesla, even though=it is fully loaded and gets the same mileage. And I leased because in three years every major automaker from Mercedes to Renault will be offering electric vehicles that get more than 250 miles =ith a single charge, so who knows what is going to be my next car. =nd in spite the setback of a fatal crash last year, when a Tesla on autopilot failed to tell the difference between =he side of a white lorry and a bright sky, the company continues to make strid=s towards a fully driverless car but so is Uber, Google and the other big aut=makers. I understand that Tesla also has a potentially lucrat=ve sideline in storage batteries for the home. The Powerwall is intended=to allow homes to store solar power, and Tesla is also due to start installing its first sola= roof tiles this year. I appreciate that Tesla's has set a goal of building 500,000 cars in 2018 and Musk ha= even raised the prospect of doubling that to lm by 2020— except that th=se production targets are unprecedented in the automotive industry and as Sams=ng last year's debacle with its Galaxy Note 7 cellphone catching fire =E2.4) pushing production delivery prior an exhausted testing has shown that a single defe=tive part from a supplier can kill sales and stock prices faster than E.coli at Chipotle. And just like McDonald's, Burger King, KFC which also had E.coli outbreaks but fared better than thei= smaller fast-food rival, should both Ford and Tesla suffer a similar misfor=une, I would bet on Ford coming through quicker. Yes, Tesla's new Model 3 is slated to start p=oduction this year and is intended to offer a more affordable version of previous models,=with a price tag around $35,000. If successful, the Model 3 could supercharge Tesla's growth by musclin= in on the territory of mass market rivals. But Tesla's model X crossover, while although sexy is currently not burning down the ho=se with sales. It's important to remember that despite the massive hype surrounding Tesla, the gigafactory currently nearing construction in Nevada will only allow the company to make 500,000 =nits a year by 2020. That would be fine if Tesla only wanted to sell cars to rich people, but CEO Elon Musk has been c=ear that the company's mission is to bring sustainable electric transport t= the mass market. To do that, an automaker needs scale.

Like many I was not surprised when I heard a week ago Thursda= evening that the US military launched 59 tomahawk missiles against a Syrian airfield to punish Syria's President Bashar Assad for allegedly usi=g chemical weapons to attack his own citizens. This act was a dramatic reversal from Trump's pledges to limit U.S. invo=vement in Syria and to focus on America First, leaving Syria's neighbors and =he Europeans to sort out the mess. For years President Obama had resisted growing calls to intervene militarily against the Assad regime. President Barack Obama's decision to refrain from engagement in 2013 was crit=cized as feckless at the time and is cited now as one of the reasons that Trump was forced to act. =span style="font-size:12pt;line-height:107%;font-family:georgia,serif"><=span> But as Neal Gable= wrote this week in Moyers & Company: It is pretty amazing how quickly the media and suck-up politicians can transform a mendacious, hypocritical, amateurish, ignorant, incoherent, bigoted buffoon who is way,=way out of his depth into a man of courage, which is what they did to President Trump this past weekend. All it takes is some saber rattling and launching a few dozen missiles. Granted, the =rump brand is already so tarnished that he didn't get the bounce or the adulation that the B=shes, pere and fils, got when they began their wars.

Humans are c=pable of unimaginable cruelty. Sometimes the victims die quickly and are made visible by media for the wor=d to see. Other times, they die in slow motion, out of sight and out of mind. Sometimes banned weapons are used; Sometimes conventional weapons; Sometime=, neglect, isolation and starvation. And sometimes it is just plain old genocide.

These decisions can be capricious at best and calculated camouflages for ulterior motives at worst. Indred, the motivations for military action needn't be singular at all, but are often multiple, tucked one insi=e the other like nesting dolls. Acts of war can themselves be used as political weapons. They can distract attention, quell acrimony, increase appetite for military spending and give a boost to sagging approval ratings.

As pundits used the phrases of 4>=9Cstrong message" and "new sheriff in town=E24,40 few asked what actually was accomplished. Think about it, the US military did not target President Assad's Sarin gas stoc=pile. And since President Trump warned the Russians an hour in advanced that he was attacking Shayrat air field, one then has t= believe that they alerted their ally President Assad. Finally, most p=oportionate military responses are really only made to make the aggressors feel better when they don't have a strategy. Talal al-Barazi, the governor of Homs province that includ=s the air base, said at least 13 people were killed in the missile strikes, including five soldiers on the base and eight civilians in areas surroundin= the facility.

As Charles Blow wrote in the New York Times: It's ea=y to sell the heroism of a humanitarian mission or the fear of terror or the two in tandem, as Trump attempted in this case. =The temptation to unleash America's massive war machine is seductive and also addictive. Put that power in the ha=ds of a man like Trump, who operates more on impulse and intuition than intellect, =nd the world should shiver. <=span> As righteous as =e may feel about punishing Assad, Syria is a hornet's nest of forces hostile to America: Assad, Russia, and Iran=on one flank and ISIS on another. You can't afflict one faction without assisting the other. In this way, Syria i= a nearly unwinnable state. We've been down this road before. Just over the horizon is a hill: Steep and greased with =olitical motives, military ambitions, American blood and squandered treasury. =eing weary here isn't a sign of weakness; to the contrary, it's a display of hard won wisdom. Neal Gabler again: Many of us during the campaign noted how Trump's reality TV experience a=fected and even defined that campaign, but far less attention has been paid to how it would affect his presidency. The narcissism, the imperial demeanor, the preening, the necessity of hyping the drama — these are now the hal=marks of his early administration. 16 EFTA_R1_01345808 EFTA02358551 It makes for good TV and lousy governance. The impulsiveness for which Trump is famous was built into reality TV too, whic= lurches mindlessly from one scene to another. Indeed, you could accurately describe reality TV as plot without content, which, not at all incidentally= is also a way to describe the Trump presidency. So, whether it was the right thing to do to st=ike Assad, it was, by reality show standards, certainly the best thing to do. It go= a huge audience. It made Trump look like a man of action.

But Trump grasped that launc=ing missiles would knock everything else off the front pages at a time when he needed it= And in the short term, he seems to have been right. Talking about Syria means we aren't talking about the Russian hacking of the election or the fai=ure of health care reform or the Keystone Cops White House staff or the trashing o= regulations or the myriad of other disasters in this ongoing reality show t=at stars the "Not Ready for Prime Time Players."<=span> It is precisely because this new interventionism has h=d the desired result that we should all begin to worry.

"This drought emergency is over, but the next drought could be around the corner,=/i>" he said in a statement. "Conservation must remain a way of life." Brown's order maintains many of the conservation practices put in place in 2015, including mandatory reports on water usage, restrictions on using non-recir=ulated water in fountains and bans on watering lawns within 48 hours of significan= rainfall. "Increasing long-term water conservation among Californians, improving water efficiency within the Stat='s communities and agricultural production, and strengthening local and region=l drought planning are critical to California's resilience to drought=and climate change," the order says.

There are dangerous jobs. And then there are deadly jobs. Sometimes, they are one in the same. Sometimes, these positions, despite the inherent element of danger, can be particularl= attractive to some job seekers. They often tend to pay better than other gi=s, for one. And competition can be low, too. But the fact remains: If you sign up for a dangerous job, there's a goo= chance you could be horribly injured or killed.

Even so, the odds you'll be killed at work are relatively small. Even am=ng the most dangerous jobs, fatality rates aren't frighteningly high. lt4o=99s just that you're far more likely to meet a gruesome end on a dude ranch than you are in a cubicle. To figure out which jobs are the most deadly, we dug through data from the Bur=au of Labor Statistics and the Department of Labor. Annual numbers relating to workplace injuries and fatalities (there were 4,836 in 2015) are released b= the government. And by using those numbers, we can piece together a list of=the deadliest jobs. Here are the top 10. 10. Landscaping and law= care The Bureau of Labor Statistics' Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries, =ooking at data from 2015, shows occupations related to lawn care and landscaping as the 10th deadliest industry in America. The fatal work injury rate, which looks at the number of fatal accidents per 100,000 workers, is 18.1 for the landscaping industry. Although it seems fairly innocuous, there are a lot of blades, chemicals, and heavy machinery that can cause disastrous outcomes in this industry. 9. Linemen </=> "Linemen" is a term commonly used to describe utility workers — specifically,=those who work on power lines. The Bureau of Labor Statistics numbers refer to this occupation as "power-line installe=s and repairers." And these are the 21 EFTA_R1_01345813 EFTA02358556 men and women you see in cherry-pickers working on power lines. It's obvious this job is inherently dangerous when you're working with heights, heavy machin=ry, and a shocking amount of electricity. 8. Farmers Th= fatal work injury rate among farmers and ranchers is 22 per 100,000 workers= So, fatal accidents aren't incredibly common, but the odds are higher than in most occupations. And again, this is = job that puts you into close contact with all sorts of potentially dangerous things. Large m=chinery, chemicals, and live40=A0animals can all present potential disasters, for example. 7. Truck drivers With a fatal work injury rate of 24.3 per 100,000, drivers (including truck driv=rs) are the seventh-deadliest job in America. There are millions of people who =ake a living through driving. Whether they're delivering goods or giving people rides, this is an incredi=ly popular profession. And it's one that is evidently very dangerous. And let's not forget it's one tha= might disappear altogether <http://www.cheatsheet.com/business/5-surprising-co=mercial-applications- for-artificial-intelligence.htmlh in the near future. 6. Iron and steelworkers <1=> Iron and steel workers have a long and storied history in parts of the country. They've also seen their in=ustry decline with increased globalization. It's a dangerous gig, too, and other count=ies don't have safety standards that are as stringent as ours. Even so, there*=99s a high rate of deadly accidents among iron and steel workers. The fatal work injur= rate among these workers is just under 30 per 100,000. 5. Garb=ge collectors Emilio Estevez made the garbage man job look kind =f fun. Perhap= it is — just imagine all of the fun and fantastic treasures you could fin=. Regardless of the fun, it's dangerous. Chalk it up t= long hours on the road, dodging cars and traffic, and dealing with hazardous and toxic refuse. The fa=al work injury rate among these employees is 38.8 per 100,000. 4. Roofers Roofing is a tough gig. You're out in the elements (usually under a burning= unforgiving sun) all day, and one wrong move can send you plummeting the ground. You're also dealing with tools and machines, all of which can hack off a limb. For these reasons, ro=fing is a dangerous and deadly job. The fatal work injury rate among roofers is 39.7 per 100,000. 3. Pilots 22 EFTA_R1_01345814 EFTA02358557 Pilots and flight engineers are high on the list — surprisingly so. Althou=h we all know airplanes crash on occasion, it's not like there are huge=disasters on a daily basis. Evidently, though, many pilots and engineers are killed w=ile on the job. The fatal work injury rate among this group of people is 40.4 per 100,000, good enough for a spot amon= the top three deadliest . <=pan style="font-size:14pt;font-family:georgia,serif">2. Fisherman =his one should come as no surprise. There are even TV shows — most notably, Deadliest Catch — that chronicle just how dangerous and deadly the lives of fishermen can be. And it's no jok=. Folks working in this notoriously tough industry do die on the job at an alarming=C24,rate. The fatal work injury rate =or those working in fishing and related industries is 54.8 per 100,000. 1. Logg=rs Stars of another reality series, Ax Men, work in the nation's deadliest occupation: logging. Loggers are killed on the j=b more often than any other worker.

The fatal work injury rate for loggers is a whoppin= 132.7 per 100,000. Before OSHA was created 43 years ago, an estimated 14,000 workers were killed on t=e job every year. Although today, workplaces are much safer and healthier sti=l thousands of U.S. workers die from injuries on the job. In fact, the Bureau of Labor Statistics' National Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries shows a prel=minary total of 4,383 fatal work injuries in 2012, down slightly from the final co=nt of 4,693 in 2011. Forty-one percent of all fatal workplace injuries happened in transportation incident=, which include car accidents, overturned vehicles and plane crashes. More th=n half (58%) of the 1,789 fatal transportation-related incidents occurred on highways, and involved motorized land vehicles. The second-highest cause of worker fatali=ies was assaults and violent acts, which accounted for 18% of deaths. The preliminary data shows that workplace suicides fell slightly in 2010 to 258 after climbing to a high of 263 the year before. Violence took the lives of 767 workers last year; with 463 homicides and 225 suicide=. (Work-related suicides declined by 10% from 2011 totals, but violence accou=ted for about 17% of all fatal work injuries in 2012.) Shootings were the most frequent manner of death in both. Slips, falls and trips killed 668 workers in 2012 -- about 15% of all workplace injuries. A total of 509 workers were fatally injured after being struck by equipment or objects on the job. There were 142 multiple-fatality incidents -- incidents where more than one worke= was killed--in 2012, in which 341 workers died. Ninety-two percent, or 4,045 of all on-the-job fatalities were among men, and the remaining 8%, or 338, were women. This is partly because there are disproportionately more men in dangerous indust=ies like construction and mining. Still, women face their own dangers. Ab=ut 20% of the women who died on the job were involved in roadway incidents, 23 EFTA_R1_01345815 EFTA02358558 while more than a quarter (29%) were victims of homicides, compared with onl= 9% for male homicides. That is at least partly because of a concentration of women in workplaces like food and beve=age stores, where a majority of all deaths are homicides. Twenty-five percent of all work fatalities occurred among those between ages 45 and 54. Fatal work injuries among individuals under 16 years of age nearly doubled, rising from 10 in 2011 to 19 in 2012—the highest total since 2005.=C2. However, fatal work injuries among workers 55 years of age and older declined for the second consecutive year. The private sector proved more deadly than the public sector, with private indu=try accounting for 90% of fatalities. Within the private sector, the construction industry and transportation and warehousing saw the largest number deaths, with 775 and 677, respectively. =C240Not included in this survey were professional athletes -- endurance athletes=/b> (long-distance runners and cross-country skiers, for example), and power athletes (boxers, wrestlers, weight lifters) and a mixed group of team athletes (like soccer, ice hockey or basketball players) an= sprinters.

Plus, learn more about how much of it you should be eating= What You're Eating 24 EFTA21_01345816 EFTA02358559 Spinach is one of the best sources of the B vitamin folate 4k=93 a cancer fighter — and carotenoids such as lutein, which help prevent=macular degeneration, the leading cause of blindness in older adults. One thi=g you're not eating: a lot of iron. The myth that spinach is rich in iron (which made Popeye strong) surfaced back in 1870 when a researcher's misplaced decimal point in a publication gave spinach an iron content 10 ti=es higher than reality. Reality is that a serving (1 cup) of r=w spinach contains only about 1 mg of iron, which is not well absorbed becaus= it is the plant (haem)=span style="font-size:12pOine-height:107%;font-family:georgia,serif"> =orm of iron. The calcium it contains also isn't absorbed very well by your body, thanks to high concentrations of oxalic ac=d. But these disadvantages are heavily outweighed by other nutritional benefits. Healing Powers In addition to protecting your eyes from age-related macular degeneration, thanks to its carotenoids, spinach has high concentrations of vitamin K, which can help maintain bone density and prevent fractures...A0 Spinach is also a powerful source of potassium and magnesium as well as folate, all of which can keep blood pressure low, reducing the risk of stroke. Folate also appears to reduce the risk of lung cancer in former smokers, according to s=me studies. Health Tips To absorb more of the iron from spinach, eat it along with foods rich in vitamin C, such as red capsicum or orange segments. How much is enough: 1 cup raw or % cup cooked spinach leaves is one vegetable serving. Have at least five serves of vegetables every day. Buying right: Choose crisp, bright green leaves and stems with no sign of yellowing, wilting or bruising..=A0 For mild flavor and delicate texture, buy baby spinach. Remove sand or dirt by washing spinach in a sink or bowl of water. Opting for pre-packaged, pre-rinsed spinach eliminates this step, but even =his spinach should be rinsed before using. By Elaine Russe=l — Reader's — Digest March 31, 2017 As stated above, full of nutrients and delicious taste, spinach is a wonderful superfood. But what's the best way to eat it= Read the following surprising facts about this leafy green: 25 EFTA_R1_01345817 EFTA02358560 It's wiser to choose tender baby spinach leaves. The larger the leaves, the more mature they are and more likely to be tough=or stringy. Also, spinach leaves that are placed under direct light in the sto=es have been found to contain more nutrients than those stored in darkness. • =C24> Cooking spinach actually increases its health benefitsl Just half a cup of cooked spinach will give you thrice as much nutrition as one cup of raw spinach. That's because the body cannot=completely break down the nutrients in raw spinach for its use. As an exception to the advice above, research studies show that taking spinach in juice form is actually the healthiest w=y to consume it. Blend spinach with other vegetables or fruits to create a delicious glass of juice, or try a green smoothie. <= class="m_4977142885636407934m_-8127405716069441209m_-656486635394792824=_- 796185754344011S0S7gmail-m_2316529243473243556gmail-m_-24096286104043321=6m_- 2898380243958664293gmail-m_8032535085150903781gmail-m_7364578844834348=9m_7214502630609316032m_- 5955632774661111741m_-5561663390226941878gmail-m_=8341751732810530S3gmail- m_5591870416997806566m_-1350999846084077074m_-9189=60299443654177m_5611129322921874124gmail-m_- 4086174604780320648gmail-m_836=756590749716069m_-6847088887303417562m_2161194578616005294gmail- m_-7951578=9410294533gmail-m_-5515300791432822094gmail-MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" st=le="text- align:left;margin-left:lin">* There's a compound in spinach called oxalic acid, which blocks the absorption of calcium and iron.

THIS WEEK's MUSIC =/span> Chick Corea This week =ou have been invited to enjoy the music of one of the most significant jazzmen since the '60s, Chick Corea (Armando Anthony "Chick" Corea, born June 12, 1941) is an American jazz and =usion pianist, keyboardist, and composer. As a member of Miles Davis's band in the late 1960s, he participated in the =irth of the electric jazz fusion movement. In the 1970s he formed Return to Forever. Along with Herbie Hanco=k, McCoy Tyner, and Keith Jarrett, he has been described as one of the major jazz piano voices =o emerge in the post-John Coltrane era. Corea continued to pursue other collaborations and to explore various musical styles throughout the 1980s and 1990s. As one of the few electric keyboardists to be quite individual and recognizable on synthesizers. In addition, he has composed several jazz standards, including "Spain<=i)," "La Fiesta," and "Windows." 0=A0 He is also known for promoting and fundraising for a number of social issues. As of January 2016, Corea had been nominated for sixty-three Grammy Awar=s, out of which he has won 22. Corea was born i= Chelsea, Massachusetts. He is of southern Italian and Spanish descent. His father, a jazz trumpet player who had led a Dixieland band in Boston in the 1930s and 1940s, introduced him to the piano at the age of four. Growing up surrounded by jazz music, he was influenced at an early age by bebop and stars such as Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Parker, Bud Powell, Hor=ce Silver, and Lester Young. At eight Corea also took up drums, which would later influence his use of the piano as a percussion instrument. Corea developed his piano skills by exploring music on his own. A notable influence was con=ert pianist Salvatore Sullo, from whom Corea started taking lessons at age eigh= and who introduced him to classical music, helping spark his interest in musical composition. He also spent several years as a performer and soloist for the St. Rose Scarlet Lancers, = drum and bugle corps based in Chelsea. 28 EFTA_R1_01345820 EFTA02358563 Given a black tu=edo by his father, he started playing gigs when in high school. He enjoyed listening to Herb Pomeroy's band at the time, and had a trio that playe= Horace Silver's music at a local jazz club. He eventually decided to move to N=w York City, where he studied musical education for one month at Columbia Universi=y and six months at Juilliard. He quit after finding both disappointing, but liked the atmosphere of New York, and=the music scene became the starting point for his professional career. He picked up imp=rtant experience playing with the bands of Mongo Santamaria and Willie Bobo (1962-1963), Blue Mitchell (1964-1966)= Herbie Mann, and Stan Getz. He made his recording debut as a leader with 1966's Tones for Joan's Bones, and=his 1968 trio release (with Mirosla= Vitous and Roy Haynes) Now He Sings, Now He Sobs is considered a classic. After a short stint w=th Sarah Vaughan, Corea joined Miles Davis as Herbie Hancock's gradual replacement, staying wit= Davis during a very important transitional period (1968-1970). He was persuaded by the trumpeter to start playing electric piano, and was on =uch significant albums as Filles de Kilimanjaro, In a Silent Way, Bitches Brew, and Miles Davis at the F=Ilmore. When he left Davis, Corea at first chose to play avant-garde acoustic jazz in Circle, a quartet with Anthony Braxton, D=ve Holland, and Barry Altschul. But at the end of 1971, he changed directions again. Leaving Circle, =orea played briefly with Stan Getz and then formed Return to Forever, which started out as a melodic Brazilian group wi=h Stanley Clarke, Joe Farrell, Airto, and Flora Purim. Within a year, C=rea (with Clarke, Bill Co=nors, and Lenny White) had changed Return to Forever into a pace-setting and high-powered fusion b=nd; Al DiMeola took Connors' place in 1974. While the music was rock-oriented, it still retained the improvisations of jazz, =nd Corea remained quite recognizable, even under the barrage of electronics.=C2* When RTF broke up in the late '70s, Corea retained the name for some big-band dates with Clarke. During the nex= few years, he generally emphasized his acoustic playing and appeared in a wide variety of contexts, including separate duet tours with Gary Burton and Herbie Hancock, a quarte= with Michael Brecker, trios with Miroslav Vitous and Roy Haynes, tributes t= Thelonious Monk, and even some classical music. In 1985, Chick Corea formed a new fusion group, the E=ektric Band, which eventually featured bassist John Patitucci, guitarist Frank Gambale, saxophonist Eric Marienthal, and drummer Dave Weckl. To balance ou= his music, he formed his Akoustic Trio with Patitucci and Weckl a few years later. When Patitucci went out on his own in the early '90s, the person=el changed, but Corea continued leading stimulating groups (including a quartet with Patitucci and Bob Berg). During 1996-1997, Corea toured with an all-star quintet (includin= Kenny Garrett and Wallace Roney) that played modern versions of Bud Powell and Thelonious Monk compositions. He remains an important =orce in modern jazz, and every phase of his development has been well documented on records. Solo Piano: Originals -- Corea began the 21st century by releasin= a pair of solo piano records, Solo Piano: Originals and Solo Piano: Standards, in 2000, followed by Past, Present & Futures in 2001. Rendezvous in New York appeared in 2003, followed by To the Stars in 2004. The Ultimate Adventure was released in 2006. That same year, Corea released Super 29 EFTA_R1_01345821 EFTA02358564 Trio with drummer Steve Gadd and bassist Christian McBride. In the spring =f 2007, Corea released an unlikely but ultimately satisfying duet album with banjo master Bela F=eck entitled The Enchantment on Concord, followed by a Universal Japan-only six-disc box set called Five Trios in 2008=that showcased the pianist in a handful of different trio settings. The same year, Corea and vibraphonist Gary Burton released their fourth offering together, entitled The New Crystal Silence. Five Peace Band: Live — The year 2008 was a busy one for Corea= He and John McLaughlin got together for the first time since they both played on M=les Davis' seminal Bitches Brew album. They pulled together a =and with saxophonist Kenny Garrett, drummer Vinnie Colaiuta, and bassist Christian McBride for t=e recording Five Peace Band: Live (with another former Miles collaborator, Herbie Hancock, guesting on "In a Silent Way/It's About That Time&=uot;). Concord re-released Return to Forever's four albums issued between 1973 and 1976 (with Corea, White, Clarke, and DiMeola) -- Hymn of the Seventh Galaxy, =here Have I Known You Before, No Mystery, and Romantic Warrior -- as a precursor for a reunion tour. This resulted in both a live album, entitled Returns, and a concert DVD. In 2009, Corea teamed with Japanese piano sensation Hiromi for Duet, followed by a live trio albu= entitled Forever with Clarke and White, culled from their "RTF Unplugged" tour. The two-disc set, issued by Concord in 2011, featured guest appearances by Chaka Khan, original RTF guitarist Connors, and violinist Jean-Luc Ponty.<=span> Furthe= Explorations — In 2012, Corea was busy from the start.Q=A0 He delivered a trio recording on Concord in January entitled Further Explorations; his sidemen were Eddie Gomez and Paul Motian (both members of various Evans ensembles). <=>Corea: The Continents Concerto for Jazz Quintet and Chamber Orchestra was issu=d by Deutsche Grammophone in February. In September, another duet recording with Burton, Hot House, was releas=d by Concord. In the summer of 2013, Corea debuted his new electric band with the album The Vigil. Its members included bassist =hristian McBride (though Hadrien Feraud oft=n plays with the group live), drummer Marcus Gilmore, Tim Garland on reeds and winds, and guitarist Charles Altura. The expansive three-di=c Trilogy was recorded live at stops all over the world and, with bassist Christian McBride and drummer Brain Blade, appeared in 2014. In 2015, Corea and Bela Fleck released the duet album, Two, compiled fr=m over seven years of their live performances. Described by one bio=rapher as a keyboard virtuoso and prolific explorer of jazz and classical music, Chick Corea has attained liv=ng legend status after five decades of unparalleled creativity and an artistic=output that is simply staggering. In response Corea is recognized as both a DownBeat Hall of Famer and NEA Jazz Master and is t=e fourth- most-nominated artist in the history of the Grammys, with 63 nominations. Additionally he has also earned 3 Latin Grammy Awards, the most of any artist in the Best Instrument=l Album category. From straight ahead to avant-garde, bebop =o fusion, children's songs to chamber music, along with some far-reaching forays =nto symphonic works, Corea has touched an astonishing number of musical bases i= his illustrious career while maintaining a standard of excellence that is awe-inspiring. A tirelessly creative spirit, Corea continues to forge ahead, continually reinventing himself in =he process. 30 EFTA_R1_01345822 EFTA02358565 Corea celebrated=his 75th birthday in 2016 by playing with more than 20 different groups during a six-week stand at the Blue Note Jazz Club in Greenwich Village, New York City. "I pretty wel= ignore the numbers that make up 'age'. It seems to be the best way to go. I have always just concentrated on having the most fun I can with the adventure of music." With this, you are again invited to enjoy the music of one of the most innovated music=ans in jazz, the master pianist on keyboards the incomparable Chick Corea=E244.

DEAR FRIEND 
<=div> 
Obesity's hefty price tag 
America's heaviest city grapples with costs from weight-loss surgery =o extra-wide hospital beds. 
<=r> 
<=p> 
=n a recent article in Politico Magazine by Beth Baker she=describes the operation above of a 30 year-old 330 pound 
female patient =E24140, considered "morbidly obese" 40=93 with two gaping hernias holes torn in the abdominal sac 
that holds the =ody's major organs, as "The belly wall is not designed to =old this much weight," said by her Baptist 
Memphis Hospital, surge=n George Woodman. 
By the operation's end, most of the patient*=804>s stomach was trimmed away, leaving a much smaller "gas=ric 
sleeve" that will allow her to feel full after eating =nly small amounts of food. Removing a portion of the stomach also 
suppress=s the hormones that stimulate hunger. The operation (known as a laparoscopic sleeve gastrectom=) is now 
the most common type of weight-loss surgery performed in=the U.S. Woodman has conducted 6,000 gastric sleeve 
operations, and =id three more that morning. Memphis is the heaviest metropolitan cit= in the country, with an adult 
obesity rate of about 36 percent — =pproaching the rate of more than 40 percent that researchers say we4i=99II reach 
by 2030, if current trends continue. 
"There is an unlimited number of patients," he sai=. 
EFTA_R1_01345793 
EFTA02358536

Memphis may be the heaviest city in the country, but it isn't mu=h of an outlier. From the trimmest state, Colorado, to 
the most obese, Mis=issippi, the entire nation has been on a perilous—and costly*=94upward track when it comes to 
extreme weight gain. Severe obesity <=span>(a BMI of 40 or more) — the kind most harmful to individual well-being and 
expen=ive to society — is rising at an alarming rate and may affect 11 p=rcent of U.S. adults by 2030. 
Dieting and exercise are the prescription fo= most Americans who want to lose weight, but only a minority 
succeed.t>=A0 Woodman estimates that just 3 percent of his morbidly obese patients co=ld lose their excess weight on 
their own, so for most, bariatric surgery i= a last-resort option. With luck, this patient will lose about 75 percent =f her 
excess weight, putting her on track to a healthier future. 0=804fleople say that obesity is self-induced," Woodman 
said. 4k=A0"But it doesn't matter. We have to do something about it=" 
Every five days, Woodman holds a seminar for prospective patient=. On a recent Saturday, 60 people showed up. 
Perhaps one-third would=follow through with surgery. For some, Medicare, Medicaid, or private insu=ers will pay, 
calculating that the price of the surgery is less than the c=st of a lifetime of chronic disease. At Baptist Memphis, the 
operati=n costs $14,000 — the cost is often higher elsewhere, $25,000 or m=re. That may seem expensive, but it could 
be a bargain compared with=the estimated $200,000 in excess medical costs obese Americans can rack up=over their 
lifetimes. 
Memphis has the highest obesity rate among U.S. citi=s, and its appetite for unhealthy food is part of the reason. 
<1=> 
Pedestrians on Beale Street take in the sights, top,=including the day's menu at B.B. King's famous blues club, left.=C24, 
At right, spectators wait for the city's famous Mardi Gras parad= to pass by. 
As American waistbands continue t= expand, researchers and policymakers are trying to figure out just what t=e obesity 
epidemic is going to cost the nation. There are the direct=medical costs of treating obesity-related diseases including 
Type 2 diabet=s, heart disease and stroke, high blood pressure, arthritis, and related c=ncers, among others. And then 
there are the indirect costs: lost productiv=ty, more illness, extra infrastructure to handle heavier patients and resi=ents. 
These bills are already coming due in Memphis. Last year, extr= health care costs from obesity were $538 million —
more than half=the budget of the city's public school system, according to Gallup=Healthways Well-Being Index. For the 
state of Tennessee, the annual =xcess health costs of obesity were $2.29 billion — equivalent to m=re than 6 percent of 
the entire state budget. No matter how many sur=eries Woodman conducts, he won't make a dent; many more 
Americans =re tipping the scales into the obese range each year.

Endocrinologist Ja= Cohen, who treats many patients with obesity-caused diabetes, estimates t=at the average diabetic 
patient costs the health care system triple what a=healthy person costs. Add in their lost productivity and the price t=g 
skyrockets. "It's politically imperative to reduce=the obesity rate," said Cohen. Nationally, "it costs literally tr=llions of 
dollars to treat these conditions." 
AS COSTLY AS the o=esity problem is now, its set to get worse. The baby boom generation=is the fattest on record, and 
they are just reaching the age where health =roblems begin to mount. Federal and state officials are growing

In West Virginia, one of the most obese states, public health comm=ssioner Rahul Gupta says the preventable direct 
medical costs of obesity a=e $1.4 billion to $1.8 billion a year, with an additional $5 billion in in=irect costs, such as lost 
productivity. Obese patients submit up to =even times the number of medical claims compared with normal-weight 
patien=s, he said. "At the state and federal levels, chronic diseas= burden is among the largest drivers of health care 
costs/4k=99 Gupta said, "and among chronic diseases it comes down to the conse=uences of obesity and tobacco."

And then there are the national co=ts. Zhou Yang, a professor at Emory University who studies the impact of o=esity on 
the medical system, found that obese older males spent $190,657 m=re on lifetime health care expenses than their 
normal weight peers while o=der obese women spent $223,629 more. A 2016 meta-analysis by Univers=ty of

Other potential costs are harder to quantify but no less worrisome, for =atients, taxpayers and society at large. For

Even the milita=y is affected, as recruiters struggle to find enough soldiers who meet fit=ess requirements. The

Transportation costs, too, are rising, and not only for obese pa=sengers who must purchase two seats to fly. 
Researchers at the Unive=sity of Illinois estimated that 1 billion additional gallons of gasoline a=e consumed in the U.S. 
each year to ferry overweight and obese car passeng=rs from place to place. One study estimated that U.S. airlines

Obesity also affects the bottom line of employers. Obesit= contributes to absenteeism and "presenteeism," whe= 
people show up but are less productive. Based on current trends, the cost=of obesity in lost economic productivity by 
2030 will be between $390 bill=on and $520 billion annually. 
Obese employees may suffer financially as we=l. A 2010 study found that white women had 9 percent lower wag=s
