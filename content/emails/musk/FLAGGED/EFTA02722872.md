Small satellites: Taking advantage of smartphones and other consumer technologies, tiny 
satellites are changing the space business 
Jun 7th 2014 
ALTHOUGH widely used, satellites are expensive to build and to launch. That began to change 
last year. On November 19th Orbital Sciences, an American company, launched a rocket from 
the Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia. It carried 29 satellites aloft and released them into low-
Earth orbit, a record for a single mission. Thirty hours later, Kosmotras, a Russian joint-venture, 
carried 32 satellites into a similar orbit. Then, in January 2014, Orbital Sciences carried 33 
satellites up to the International Space Station (ISS), where they were cast off a month later. 
Many of these 94 satellites were built in a standard format known as a CubeSat, a 10cm (4 inch) 
cube weighing 1.3kg (2.91b) or less. Some comprised units of two or three cubes. After a decade 
of fits and starts, during which some 75 CubeSats were launched, satellites of this scale and 
other small satellites are moving from being experimental kit to delivering useful scientific data 
and commercial services. 
In the next five years or so some 1,000 nanosats, as small satellites of 1-10kg are called, are 
expected to be launched. Some will be smaller than a CubeSat; others bigger and heavier. Some 
are like a matryoshka doll: the Russian launch included a satellite that launched eight smaller 
ones, including four PocketQubes (a 5cm cube format). One of these smaller satellites, 
developed in Peru, released its own tiny bird. 
There will be upsets along the way. In April, as part of a mission by SpaceX, an American 
company, to resupply the 1SS, a small mothership was placed in orbit carrying 104 "sprites" 
(pictured below). Not much larger than a postage stamp, these contain all the basic elements of a 
satellite, such as a radio, aerials, a solar cell and instruments. Developed as part of a crowd-
funded project called KickSat at Cornell University, each sprite cost just $25 in parts. Their 
launch was free, courtesy of NASA, the American space agency. The sprites were designed to 
remain in orbit for a few weeks collecting data before burning up on re-entry. Unfortunately, due 
to a fault with a timer, the mothership failed to release them before it burned up on re-entry. A 
second mission is now being planned. 
Despite that setback, the way ahead for satellite technology is clear. "You can now, with a single

chip, create most of the capabilities that you would have found in Sputnik, but, of course, orders 
of magnitude faster," says Mason Peck, a former chief technologist at NASA and now a 
professor at Cornell University. 
The most ambitious project to date is a flock of 28 nanosats, each one three CubeSats in size (ie, 
30cm long). These were carried to the ISS in January and released in batches (pictured at the 
beginning of this article) through a sort of satellite shooter developed by NanoRacks, an 
American company. These nanosats came from Planet Labs, a firm based in San Francisco. The 
satellites now take pictures as they scan the Earth more frequently than traditional ones and at a 
fraction of the cost, albeit at a lower resolution. 
Planet Labs, funded modestly with $65m of private investment, says its nanosats provide much 
of the performance of a conventional satellite for a fraction of the cost. That reflects a lot of 
antiquated technology in the space business, much of which can be bettered by the latest off-the-
shelf equipment, says Will Marshall, Planet Labs' boss. There are other cost-savin measures. 
Satellites are usual] built in elaborate clean rooms, but 
The company expects to put another 100 
nanosats into orbit in the next 12 to 18 months. 
A few miles away, in another modest San Francisco office, Nanosatisfi is working on its 
ArduSats. These arc open-source platforms and two have already gone up. They will contain an 
array of sensors and can carry out various missions, such as locating things. More than 250,000 
ships, for instance, now broadcast an automatic identification signal than carries about 50 
nautical miles. A fleet of small satellites in low orbit could pick up these signals and provide 
frequent updates about the ships' positions without the vessels having to use costly dedicated 
satellite uplinks. Such a system might have been able to track Malaysian Airlines flight MH370, 
which went missing in March. 
Farther south in Mountain View, Skybox captures high-resolution imaging data from its first 
satellite in orbit as it prepares another 23 to launch in the coming years. Some things, though, 
can be shrunk only so far and larger satellites arc needed for a telesco 
to obtain the hi er 
resolutions required for the firm's analysis. 
fairly common size for small satellites, the firm proved its concept to investors using CubeSats. 
"Being able to put something in space at very low cost allows you to demonstrate the 
technology to get more money," says Dan Berkenstock, one of the company's founders. 
The CubeSat specification came out of the academic world in the late 1990s. Bob Twiggs, then 
at Stanford University and now at Morehead State University, was frustrated by long delays on a 
large-satellite programme and set about thinking how much satellite capability might be 
crammed into a much smaller craft that could be launched cheaply. Space launches usually 
comprise one or more primary payloads and require ballast to balance the rocket. CubeSats, 
reasoned Mr Twiggs, could take the place of some of this ballast, so long as they did not 
jeopardise the main mission. The optimum size Mr Twiggs came up with was based on a box 
used to display Beanie Babies. Later, with Jordi Puig-Suari of California Polytechnic State 
University, it was turned into a full specification. Mr Twiggs also developed the 5cm 
PocketQube, which has a maximum weight of 180 grammes.

Small satellites benefit from the constant improvements in price and performance being achieved 
by the consumer-electronics industry, particularly in smartphones. A typical phone is now likely 
to contain an accelerometer to measure how fast it is moving, a magnetometer to detect 
magnetic fields and provide a compass reading, a GPS receiver to pick up satellite data, multiple 
radios, a gyroscope to measure its position, a barometer to detect pressure, two cameras and 
much more. 
Last year the world's first "phonesat" went into orbit. It was a Google Nexus One smartphone 
incorporated into a three-unit CubeSat called STRaND-1. This was built by Surrey Satellite 
Technology, a British firm that specialises in small satellites and which is part of the European 
Airbus group. The idea was to test the components of the smartphone in a space environment. 
The phone was loaded with a number of experimental apps for such things as taking 
photographs and recording magnetic fields during orbit. 
s my smartphone in there? 
Smartphones and other consumer electronics provide a wealth of ready-made technologies that 
can enable a CubeSat to perform many of the functions of a satellite a hundred times heavier and 
much larger, but at substantially less cost. Including the launch, a nanosat of CubeSat dimensions 
might cost $150,000-1m, rather than $200m-1 billion for a full-sized one. 
Low cost and a tolerance of less-stringent standards allow multiple nanosats to be built faster. 
This allows for a higher risk of failure. Nanosats have a relatively short life, which might be no 
more than a year or two in low-Earth orbit before re-entering the atmosphere and burning up. 
Planet Labs, for one, expects to replace some of its nanosats with new versions every year.

Into space in a flash 
In an industry in which preparing some missions has taken decades, the speed at which nanosats 
can be developed and put into orbit makes the biggest in the space business take notice. NASA 
has also found ways to leverage the consumer-electronics industry, says Bruce Yost of the space 
agency's Ames Research Centre in California. His group (some former members of which 
founded Planet Labs) has launched five phonesats and is now planning a small fleet of them to 
experiment with communications between satellites. 
Nanosat parts are readily available to researchers. One supplier, Pumpkin, operates from a 
residential San Francisco neighbourhood. Andrew Kalman, its founder, started in 2000 selling 
standard components that Mr Twiggs and his colleagues at Stanford needed. Pumpkin now sells 
items ranging from brackets for a few hundred dollars up to complete systems for hundreds of 
thousands of dollars. The company has also supplied America's National Reconnaissance Office 
with 12 three-unit CubeSats to help the agency demonstrate the technology. 
Although many satellites already circle the globe taking pictures, some of the images may not be 
updated for days, months or even years. Commercial services can provide relatively rapid 
satellite images on demand, a number of them taking pictures down to a resolution of 50cm (ie, 
50cm x 50cm per pixel, the legal limit in America for commercial satellites, although military 
ones can peer closer). But such satellites may cover only part of the globe each day. Once their 
fleets are complete, Planet Labs will offer images with resolutions of between 500cm to 300cm 
and Skybox, with its bigger minisatellites, 90cm. The companies will provide pict
