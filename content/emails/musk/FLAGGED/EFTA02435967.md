As Lisa's literary agent, as far as getting the attention of the media and readers in general, Harvard is the gold standard, and Caltech is high-value. But NYU is not even on the cultural map. (I have exactly one client there and don't know of anyone to chase). In any event. Lisa's next book is sold and this shouldn't be a consideration in her decision. And in general, it hasn't hurt Steve Weinberg and Shelly Glashow to have lett Harvard. I know: Lisa is not easy. Some people are that way. But I say she's worth it. And, in terms of science, we all need to do what we can to give women a place at the table. It's not easy being a woman - perhaps the top woman - in theoretical physics, and nobody expects her male counterparts to be regular guys (nor are they).

Title: RE: Lisa Randall 
I talked to Lisa at length. I summarized my thoughts to her: sounds like CalTech is her true love and NYU is the 
rich boyfriend. She agreed, but i think she is looking for someone to sponsor the true love so that her decision 
will be easier - and no doubt the results would be better, too. 
I am not in the *support science and arts" business now for a while, but gentlemen, this may be certainly a good 
cause for you. I agree with Nathan on the money comments (as with everything else ;-) but I think the issue of 
support is more the team that can be built, not necessarily the personal income, so the books/consulting/etc. 
approach will not work that well.

Subject: RE: Usa Randall 
Feel free to pass this along to Lisa, and I would be happy to discuss with her in person in addition. 
There arc several issues raised in your email. 
First there is I larvard vs Caltech or NYU. I think that the key issue there is where she will be comfortable. I agree with 
your assessment about reputation value of Ilarvard/CaltchtNYU, but if she has a second book out and you as her agent I 
don't think that she has to worry about that quite so much. Her brand value is mostly personal at this point - she isn't just 
some random professor at I lanurd. she is Lisa Randall. 
Within physics community nobody cares about what place she is - her papers arc what matters. 
An academic department doesn't actually do much for a theoretical physicist. You get an office and some teaching and 
committee duties, but that is about it. She could do her work anywhere, especially now that she has an established 
reputation. 
If they arc annoying her, then it should be taken seriously because it is not going to change anytime soon. Department 
chairmen can hold the post forever, and the rest of the faculty will be there even longer. So if she is not getting along with 
the department now there is no reason to think it will change. 
If she wants to build an empire, then NYU's deal which includes hiring other faculty would be a possibility. I don't know 
whether Lisa wants to do that or not, but my guess is not. So I don't see any reason to go for NYLI, unless she wants a 
mini-empire, or unless she really and truly wants to live in NYC. 
One option that is not mentioned is whether there are other institutions that ought to be considered. Lisa is very high 
profile. and I suspect that there arc departments that would love to have her. If they know she is "in play" then they might 
EFTA_R1_01508243 
EFTA02435967

come up with oilers. That is how University of Texas at Austin got Weinberg and some others - they went on a mission to 
increase their profile by hiring a big shot. NYU is clearly trying to do that - hire a big shot name brand physicist as part of 
a move to upgrade their department. 
There might be some other department out there that doesn't know she might be available. However, just like putting a 
company "in play" can backfire with a suitor you don't want, or could screw up the deal with ones you do want, there arc 
some possible issues with letting everybody know. Perhaps the physics departments do already know she might be 
available. 
Second there is the salary issue. Without knowing more about the dynamics of the department. it is hard to say for sure. 
It probably does not hurt to ask for more money to a point, but past that point it could raise rancor in the department and 
ultimately be self defeating. Caltech is a much smaller institution than its reputation would suggest. and it is possible that 
they don't have any more resources. 
So those are some general considerations, but here is the real advice. 
Shc should accept Caltech. Depending on the details of the situation, maybe she could ask gently for a bit more money. 
However I think that is a small detail • she should basically take the otter. Here is why: 
• The reputation is perfectly OK. She has enough brand that it doesn't matter, but there is nothing wrong with Caltech . It 
is not a reputations' embarassment to go there. Yes, it is not as famous with the general public as Harvard. but that is 
small change compared to being unhappy at Harvard. 
• She likes the place - both the department and LA. That matters a lot. One can strategize all day long about how to make 
Harvard pay more to keep her, or get NYU to step up... but if she really likes Caltcch then that matters a lot. Asking a 
bunch of big-shot advisors like us to recommended a strategy is all well and good, but she has to live this out day by day 
for many years. She should go to the place that makes her happy. 
• It may be less money but with less teaching load she can make more money in other ways. She can write books more 
often (you'll like that part John). she can give paid speaking engagements, she potentially could consult for companies... I 
don't know the key numerical details of course, and perhaps the difference in salary is huge. However I suspect that it is 
not. Lisa has sufficient personal brand that I think she can very likely earn the difibrence if making some more money is 
really important. Indeed, less teaching time may well make the Caltech offer higher if you factor this sort of thing in... 
- However if making money is really important, then why be an academic in the first place? She chose an academic life 
and has been successful. Shc should go to the place that will make her happy.

Lisa Randall needs advice re a possible move from the Harvard Physics Department to either Caltech or NYU, both of 
which have extended job offers. She's unhappy at Harvard. where the department seems to be intent on pulling the rug out 
from under her at every opportunity, and she wants a change. I am writing to all of you because I am out of my depth in 
advising her on her choices between universities and physics departments. compensation packages, etc. In this regard, it 
occurred to me that any of you might have good advice and/or connections and that Lisa might benefit by talking to you
