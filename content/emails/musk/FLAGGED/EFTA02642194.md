Hi Jeff 
This seems to be THE most fascinating subject on the ta=le right now (probably except for the the emerging potential of 
gene editin= and the NOTCH2NL gene role (to be validated) in the leap from primates =99 to humans' brain). 
Could you think of using your conne=tions to establish a 2 days seminar on this issue with some of the to= players. Yan 
LeCun is originally from Courant Institute in NYU, I believe.=I happen to know Demis Hassabis of Deep Mind. Probably 
Peter Thiel or Yuri M=lner could either be the hosts, or help us to reach/ convince several more t=p thinkers to join. 
Your thoughts?

risks presented by something tha= doesn't exist yet, all of Silicon Valley is learning about uninten=ed consequences of
