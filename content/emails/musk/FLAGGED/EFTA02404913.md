| **Subject** | Re: Al startup Vicarious secures $40 million in investment funding Hi, Yeah, I understand that to secure substantial funding for my work, it will likely be necessary to make an impressive demo, and we're working on it.... When I have such a demo, I will let you know. I think we should be able to come up with a nice "theory of mind" demo this year, using our Al game world as a basis. (The "deception agent" we discussed would be a part of this.) .... This may not be as headline-grabbing as solving CAPTCHAs but will form a much sounder basis for further work toward real AGI.... Indeed, perhaps Dileep made a wiser choice than me in terms of rapid securing of funding. I make no claim to be a genius of fundraising or scientific or tech-industry politics... On the other hand, I believe my approach has led me to understand the problem better. I have always been driven more by understanding than by money; which is probably associated with why I have a lot more understanding than money ;-p Dileep put a lot of resources on solving CAPTCHA, which was a very cool demo. In the course of doing this, he did not build his understanding of the broader AGI problem; but he created something that was broadly viewed as proving the validity of his approach, which enabled him to raise a lot of money... Similarly, Demis Hassabis put a lot of resources on making a system that could learn to play simple video games using computer vision and reinforcement learning. This is basically a bunch of fiddling-around and tuning of known algorithms, which did not impress any of the world's reinforcement learning / vision experts particularly; but it did blow Larry Page away and got Demis a fat acquisition for Deep Mind. Good for Demis! ;) I have worked on many aspects of the AGI problem at once, rather than focusing on pushing one corner of the solution to an impressively demo-able state; which has made it very slow for me to get to an impressive demo, but has enabled me to understand the problem in all its aspects pretty well... Regarding Vicarious, though -- I'm sure you also understand that luck plays a large role in these things. Dileep was in the right place at the right time, and making use of this fact, he connected himself with the right people in the right way. Many others just as smart as him have put years of their lives into constructing wizzy demos, and have done so successfully, but have not gained much $$ or understanding in the process just due to contingent factors... Bear in mind, more than 70,000 man-years of effort have gone into the Linux OS. Windows has taken millions of man- years of effort. These are just operating systems; not thinking machines. If OpenCog can be EFTA_R1_01444969 EFTA02404913 created in a couple hundred man-years of effort all total, that will be remarkable efficiency compared to that with which operating systems or more commercial software programs have been built. And the fact that with a mere low-dozens of man-years of effort we have struggled to come up with an impressive demo shouldn't be a big shock. AGI is difficult. Of course it's easier to make a demo if you address an easier problem, like recognizing CAPTCHAs or playing Atari games, in a way that doesn't reflect a truly general architecture or approach... :1 ben -- Ben On Sat, Mar 22, 2014 at 9:57 PM, Jeffrey Epstein <jeevacation@gmail.com> wrote: > understood , the major difference between him and you was that he had a > demo.

Hi, 
Yeah, I understand that to secure substantial funding for my work, it will likely be necessary to make an impressive 
demo, and we're working on it.... When I have such a demo, I will let you know. 
I think we should be able to come up with a nice "theory of mind" demo this year, using our Al game world as a basis. 
(The "deception agent" 
we discussed would be a part of this.) .... This may not be as headline-grabbing as solving CAPTCHAs but will form a 
much sounder basis for further work toward real AGI.... 
Indeed, perhaps Dileep made a wiser choice than me in terms of rapid 
securing of funding. I make no claim to be a genius of fundraising 
or scientific or tech-industry politics... 
On the other hand, I believe my approach has led me to understand the 
problem better. I have always been driven more by understanding than 
by money; which is probably associated with why I have a lot more understanding than money ;-p 
Dileep put a lot of resources on solving CAPTCHA, which was a very 
cool demo. In the course of doing this, he did not build his 
understanding of the broader AGI problem; but he created something that was broadly viewed as proving the validity of 
his approach, which enabled him to raise a lot of money... 
Similarly, Demis Hassabis put a lot of resources on making a system that could learn to play simple video games using 
computer vision and reinforcement learning. This is basically a bunch of fiddling-around and tuning of known 
algorithms, which did not impress any of the world's reinforcement learning / vision experts particularly; but it did blow 
Larry Page away and got Demis a fat acquisition for Deep Mind. Good for Demis! ;)

to an impressively demo-able state; which has made it very slow for me to get to an impressive demo, but has enabled
