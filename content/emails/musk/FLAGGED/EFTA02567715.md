Hi=Jeffrey, 
Thanks for your time yesterday. 
Would love to conti=ue our conversation. If I stayed here in NYC for another 2 days, wou=d you have time? I 
could also see if Stephan could bring the Vive up=to setup at your place. Otherwise, can we meet in Paris in Jan? =AO I 
can try to get Alain Forget there for you to meet (if you haven =99t already). Alain is the subject that Peter uses for his 
studies. =C2 
Briefly where we were was: 
1) =A0The "Evolving caravan" and events to identify scientists=and people with special abilities (more subjects 
for research). 
=) Research methodologies and experiments that stand up to rigour (ne=work of labs and researchers around 
the world, common protocols, Ideally y=u can also support Peter who is part of this, etc.). 2nd person rese=rch 
methodologies (we haven't talked about this). I am seein= NYU and Columbia University faculty later today to talk about 
this. =A0 
3) "Polystery" for rehabilitating =80 stage 3" people (examples like Edd who have gifts, but are no= able to 
support themselves). Have a sustainable model for this. =AO Also supports (1). Builds community and eco-system. 
<=iv> 
Would like to build a global network. We didn =80 t even talk about China and work there or Cuba. 
<=iv>Would like to apply the 60.75k allocated from last year to pilot some o= this. Wanted to see if we could 
establish some metrics that could l=ad to more funding if we are successful. 
T=e benefits to you are: 
1) More interesting people to meet.=/div> 
2) Helping to develop a theory of development and human po=ential. 
3) Advancing knowledge and experimental methodolog=es (e.g., 2nd person methodologies).

4) Adds a new dimensi=n to the interests that you already have in music, language, and psycholog=. 
5) Provide services that are unique for the commu=ity of people that you know (e.g., high stage 2, low stage 3 
people). =AO There are new models such as the initial proposition I made to you last=year (collaborating on developing a 
service to "shift" peo=le that are unhappy. 
6) Potentially build a community of p=ople that can do amazing things together (Joscha, Masha, etc.) that can
