Payments: Your payment must be sent to the payment address shown on your statement and must be received by 5 p.m. local time at that address to 
be credited as of the day it is received. Payments we receive after 5 p.m. will not be credited to your Account until the next day. Payments must also: 
(1) include the remittance coupon from your statement (2) be made with a single check drawn on a US bank and payable in US dollars, or with a 
negotiable instrument payable in US dollars and clearable through the US banking system: and (3) include your Account number. If your payment does 
not meet all of the above requirements, crediting may be delayed and you may incur late payment fees and additional Interest charges. Electronic 
payments must be made through an electronic payment method payable in US dollars and clearable through the US banking system. If we accept 
payment in a foreign currency, we will convert it into US dollars at a conversion rate that is acceptable to us, unless a particular rate is required by law. 
Please do not send post-dated checks as they will be deposited upon receipt. Any restrictive language on a payment we accept will have no effect on 
us without our express prior written approval. We will re-present to your financial institution any payment that is returned unpaid. 
Permission for Electronic Withdrawal: (1) When you send a check for payment, you give us permisslonto electronically withdraw your payment from 
your deposit or other asset account. We will process checks electronically by transmitting the amount of the check routing number, account number 
and check serial number to your financial institution, unless the check is not processable electronically or a less costly process is available. When we 
process your check electronically, your payment maybe withdrawn from your deposit or other asset account as soon as the same day we receive your 
check, and you will not receive that cancelled check with your financial account statement. If we cannot collect the funds electronically we may issue a 
draft against your deposit or other asset account for the amount of the check. (2) By using Pay By Computer, Pay By Phone or any other electronic 
payment service of ours, you give us permission to electronically withdraw funds from the deposit or other asset account you specify in the amount you 
request. Payments using such services of ours received after 8:00 p.m. MST may not be credited until the next day. 
How We Cakuiate Your Balance: We use the Average Daily Balance (ADO) method (including new transactions) to calculate the balance on which we 
charge Interest for Pay Over Time balances on your Account. Call the Customer Service number listed below for more information about this balance 
computation method and how resulting interest charges are determined. The method we use to figure the ADS and interest results in doily 
compounding of interest. 
Paying interest If you have a Pay Over Time balance, your due date is at least 25 days after the close of each billing period. We will begin charging 
interest on transactions added to a Pay Over Time balance as of the date they are added. However, we will not charge interest on charges added to a 
Pay Over Time balance automatically (for example, Sign& Trove! and Extended Payment Option) if you pay the Account Total New Balanceby the due 
date each month. 
Foreign Currency Charges: If you make a Charge in a foreign currency, we will convert it into US dollars on the date we or our agents process it. We 
will choose a conversion rate that Is acceptable to us for that date, unless a partkular rate is required by law. Theconversion rate we use Is no mote than 
the highest official rate published by a government agency or the highest interbank rate we identify from customary banking sources on the conversion 
date or the prior business day. This rate may differ from rates in effect on the date of your charge. Charges converted by establishmentswill be billed at 
the rates such establishmentsuse. 
Credit Balance: A credit balance (designated CR) shown on this statement represents money owed to you. If within the six-month period following the 
date of the first statement Indicating the credit balance you do not request a refund or charge enough to use up the credit balance, we will send you a 
check for the credit balance within 30 days if the amount is S1.00 or more. 
Credit Reporting: We may report information about your Account to credit bureaus. Late payments, missed payments, or other defaults on your 
Account may be reflected in your credit report. 
New York residents may contact the NY Banking Dept. for a comparative listing of credit card rates, fees and grace periods at 1-800-518-8866.
