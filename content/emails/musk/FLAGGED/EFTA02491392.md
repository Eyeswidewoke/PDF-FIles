The idea of interpreting sensory syst=ms as involving both input and output, and hence presumably 
accessing a central system of competence (as distinct from the input-output performa=ce systems) is a very interesting

What sensory systems provide to the b=ain is always interpreted by internal systems, memory included, 
and the sensory systems themselves carry out analysis. There =99s a good deal of detailed work on this, mainly for 
sound and vision. =AO Turns out, for example, that chimp auditory system yields something ver= close to the physical 
features that enter into the phonological systems of human language, but lacking the internal interpret=tion, for the 
apes it's noise while for the newborn infant it =80 s language.

Been on the road all day from the Cap= to Cambridge. Along with every other car in Mass. 
Glad you liked the paper. Since=Leonard Bernstein's Charles Eliot Norton lectures at Harvard 
about 40 years ago there has been interesting work seeking structural similariti=s between language and at least some 
musical traditions, mostly western to=al. You might want to have a look. One of those doing the best=work is my 
colleague David Pesetsky, a fine linguist and excellent musician. 
You're right that "re=ding the eyes" is a complex and fascinating topic, even extrapolat=ng gaze, 
the way infants do but probably not other animals. And famously, staring=into someone's eyes is far from neutral: 
either serious threat or =eal intimacy. But these are all cognitive interpretations of the (in=ernal) output of the visual 
system. 
It could be argued that the computati=ns involved in determining what we see are a central 
system, not just part of a processing system. Hard to see how to pose that a= a real empirical issue that can be tested.

" processing" -my use of sloppy language=C2 , sorry, thanks for the great paper. =C2 music 
and its" understanding" , might be a clo=er representation to expressing a formalism that might help describe the 
events. it is not an either=, or , it is a superposition of melody, prosody, harmony, within cer=ain bounds that 
differentiate it from noise. 
fyi, in the paper it says the vis=on system is only input, .not sure that is corrrect. reading t=e 
eyes might have more to it than previously thought. 
On Sat, Aug 1, 2015 at 6:54 AM, Noam Chomsky note: 
There is a view that language is esse=tially a processing system. The arguments against 
it seem to me very power. I'll attach a recent paper about it, a =ontribution to a volume of essays dedicated to Jerry 
Fodor and focusing on=his conception of language as processing (input modules). His =ersion is far more sophisticated 
than the signal processing approaches that were all the rage in the 1950s, drawing from the successes=of wartime 
technology in signal analysis and Shannon's information=theory.
