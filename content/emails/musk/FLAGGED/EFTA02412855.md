Anyone you don't know on an immediate list, ask me or google them. 
All are good friends of mine for years, but these very high end circles 
travel together, so you should be very familiar with almost all of them. 
And, a few that you don't know, arc off the charts, and in some 
respects smarter than the ones that arc familiar... ;-) They just didn't 
seek the limelight. I have marked these people with an asterisk. Not 
everyone on this list is a scientist. 
There is no order to this list (this is a cross-section off the top of my head). I can 
think of more names if I put my mind to it, but lets start here:
