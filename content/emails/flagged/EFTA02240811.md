, the hotel in Milan says they have very strict payment policies and do 
not usually accept third party payments through credit card for security 
reasons Can you please put on your credit card, email the receipt to Rich in our 
accounting dept (he is cc'd here) and he can wire the money (like Bella did with 
your last hotel stay)...
