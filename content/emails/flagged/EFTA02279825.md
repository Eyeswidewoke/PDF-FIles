I got through to the Customer Service Dept. to State Department (202 485 8100) I asked if there 
was a specialist in the area of passports for registered sex offenders and was told no but the man 
did advise me that each case is an individual legal process...everything must be 
reviewed/researched, may require possible court orders...I asked if I could please connect him to 
the person applying for the passport and was told there is really nothing else he could answer 
since each case is individual. He did say most registered sex offenders do receive passports, but 
with an endorsement on the back. 
Would you like me to call again, get someone on the phone and connect you?
