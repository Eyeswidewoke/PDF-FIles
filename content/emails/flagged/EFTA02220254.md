DearM 
Thank you so much foil 
email, 
I just heard back from 
that she's waiting for the answer from 
her employer if she can leave from Saturday to Monday (basically 
over the weekend). All of the previous correspondence between 
Jeffrey's assistant, was private so am not sure they 
understood each other correctly if the ticket was requested by 
Jeffrey for Sunday. 
Just to avoid the inconvenience and confusion, I would like to let 
you know that she's aiming to go to the island on Saturday morning 
and come back Monday morning, if that's possible and is still 
awaiting for the approval. 
Please let me know if that's okay.
