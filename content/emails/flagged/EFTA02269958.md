Hi Jeffrey, It was lovely seeing you again and I'm glad we were able to connect while you're still in town.

The idea is to focus on crypto PR, business speaker agency, events organization (such as Davos) with global recognition. We're very excited about it :) Also as I've mentioned, we'd like to raise capital and we really need some advise on what direction to take. I've put together a very raw picture of what we currently have in terms of financials and I'd really appreciate your take on how to build a solid roadmap to raise some capital and build bigger operations. Looking forward to your feedback! Kind regards, Co-Founder & CEO, Crypto PR Lab EFTA_R1_01076905 EFTA02269958 |

Hi Jeffrey, 
It was lovely seeing you again and I'm glad we were able to connect while you're still in
