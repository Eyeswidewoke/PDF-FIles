Re: Jeffrey Epstein 
Misha, 
Thursday they will start around 9am (I'm told they can never really confirm until 
the night before.) 
You Don't need to bring anything (I recommend bringing as little on your person 
as possible so you don't lose anything on set) Either Karyna or Arina (or maybe 
both!) will escort you there...they have both been to one of woody's shoots and 
know the ropes :1 I will come back to you with more details...
