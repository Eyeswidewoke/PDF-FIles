Dear Jeffrey 
I hope you've been well. I wanted to update you on what I've been up to for 
the last two years. I was also hoping to talk with you to 
see if I might use the foundation's Lexington office 
conference room from time to time for my work and 
what I could provide in exchange for that. I am cc'ing 
Rich because I'm not sure if you still use this email? 
Since working for your foundation, I continued to publish as a journalist 
writing mostly about genetic vectors (Newsweek, 
Techonomy etc). I then set up an LLC that provides 
business development for labs that have reversed age-
driven or degenerative diseases. Most of the therapies are 
genetic vectors, and have to show remarkable results at 
the mouse level and beyond. Regenerative medicine is a 
rapidly evolving field, and one that forces the medical 
industry to shift their focus from addressing symptoms of 
disease to fundamental evolutionary shortfalls. 
So far, I placed a genetic vector at the National Institute of Medicine in 
France (that reversed glaucoma in mice using the 
ncuroglobin gene) under formal licence review with a 
publicly traded pharma group here in the US. And I am 
collaborating with a lab at the University of Pittsburgh 
that has reversed cirrhosis/ end stage liver disease in rats 
using the master transcription gene in hepatocytes. The 
concept of the latter gene vector is really intriguing in 
that a master transcription gene completely restored liver 
function by rebalancing genetic expression and thus 
proteostasis. 
While I don't really need an office at this point, I do need access to a 
conference room from time to time and it would be 
hugely helpful if I could access the foundation's. If there 
was some work that I could do for the foundation in 
exchange, I would be delighted to do that.
