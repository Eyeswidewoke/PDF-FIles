Most of the therapies are genetic vectors, and have to show remarkable results at the mouse level and beyond. Regenerative medicine is a rapidly evolving field, and one that forces the medical industry to shift their focus from addressing symptoms of disease to fundamental evolutionary shortfalls.

And I am collaborating with a lab at the University of Pittsburgh that has reversed cirrhosis/ end stage liver disease in rats using the master transcription gene in hepatocytes. The concept of the latter gene vector is really intriguing in that a master transcription gene completely restored liver function by rebalancing genetic expression and thus proteostasis. While I don't really need an office at this point, I do need access to a conference room from time to time and it would be hugely helpful if I could access the foundation's. If there was some work that I could do for the foundation in exchange, I would be delighted to do that.

Dear Jeffrey 
I hope you've been well. I wanted to update you on what I've been up to for the last two 
years. I was also hoping to talk with you to sec if I might use the foundation's 
Lexington office conference room from time to time for my work and what I could 
provide in exchange for that. I am cc'ing Rich because I'm not sure if you still use 
this email? 
Since working for your foundation, I continued to publish as a journalist writing mostly 
about genetic vectors (Newsweek, Techonomy etc). I then set up an LLC that 
provides business development for labs that have reversed age-driven or 
degenerative diseases. Most of the therapies are genetic vectors, and have to show 
remarkable results at the mouse level and beyond. Regenerative medicine is a 
rapidly evolving field, and one that forces the medical industry to shift their focus 
from addressing symptoms of disease to fundamental evolutionary shortfalls.

review with a publicly traded pharma group here in the US. And I am collaborating 
with a lab at the University of Pittsburgh that has reversed cirrhosis/ end stage liver 
disease in rats using the master transcription gene in hepatocytes. The concept of

While I don't really need an office at this point, I do need access to a conference room 
from time to time and it would be hugely helpful if I could access the foundation's.

It would be wonderful to catch up with you as well.
