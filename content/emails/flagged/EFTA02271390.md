| **Subject** | Flight Davos Dear Lesley, I hope this finds you well and you had a great start into the New Year! — I have gotten an invitation to speak at Davos on the 22nd of January, and Jeffrey offered he could take care of the flight. It is probably best if I get there on the 21st of Jan and leave on the 24th, because I need to be in Honolulu for the AAAI conference on the 26th. It seems that the best airport to get there is Zurich (ZRH). Could you please help with arranging the flight? Thank you so much! Joscha EFTA_R1_01080205 EFTA02271390 |

Dear Lesley, 
I hope this finds you well and you had a great start into the New Year! — I have gotten an 
invitation to speak at Davos on the 22nd of January, and Jeffrey offered he could 
take care of the flight. It is probably best if I get there on the 21st of Jan and leave 
on the 24th, because I need to be in Honolulu for the AAAI conference on the 
26th. It seems that the best airport to get there is Zurich (ZRH). 
Could you please help with arranging the flight? 
Thank you so much!
