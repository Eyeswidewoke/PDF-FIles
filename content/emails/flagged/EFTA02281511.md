Can you please type out the carrier name, flight number and time of departure as well as give me the exact dates? I see you want to depart Zurich on March 7...but return is what day? RE the hotel, if we book through Jeffrey and pay with his CC, there is no way to avoid his name. His name will be on everything. Probably best for you to book it and get reimbursed. RE your passport, I believe I can book without passport info. We really just need your name and birthday. However, you will need an actual passport to travel. If you are traveling this week on Thursday March 7 but not getting the new passport until next week, you will need to travel with the old passport now...

Hi 
What a nice trip! I will ask Jeffrey re the biz ticket .. the link you provided is not taking 
me to the exact flights you are requesting. Can you please type out the carrier name, flight 
number and time of departure as well as give me the exact dates? I see you want to depart Zurich 
on March 7...but return is what day? RE the hotel, if we book through Jeffrey and pay with his 
CC, there is no way to avoid his name. His name will be on everything. Probably best for you to 
book it and get reimbursed. RE your passport, I believe I can book without passport info. We 
really just need your name and birthday. However, you will need an actual passport to travel. If 
you are traveling this week on Thursday March 7 but not getting the new passport until next 
week, you will need to travel with the old passport now...
