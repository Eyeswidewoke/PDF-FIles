I am going back and forth with 
She prefers to fly to Miami vs NY because she says 
customs is easier in Miami than NY. She has a ticket 
to Kaliningrad Jan 3-7 but says she can postpone the 
trip after coming to see you Jan 2-7. She would like 
to fly: 
-Moscow to Miami Wed. Jan. 2 
-OK for her to fly from SIT-Miami-Moscow on Jan. 7? (or should she fly 
with you to NY then Moscow from NY?) 
-Moscow-Kaliningrad Jan. 8 
-Kaliningrad-Moscow Jan 12 
Please advise...
