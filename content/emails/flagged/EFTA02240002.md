Hi Jeffery, would it be possible to stay at your guest apartment in New York from 04.26 til 
04.29? I have an appointment at Russian Consulate in NY. 
I will be traveling with my boyfriend. We would usually split the cost but I want to save some 
money. I'm still looking for a job. Hopefully, I will find something in a few months.
