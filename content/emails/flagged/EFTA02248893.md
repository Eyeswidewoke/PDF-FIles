None of Lesley's 
emails showed up 
on my phone during 
the day, until I 
typed in her name 
in search just now 
and then all of them 
appeared as new 
emails...

If they 
were 
sent 
during 
the 
time 
Google 
had 
blocke 
d your 
phone, 
they'll 
be 
delaye 
d and 
deliver 
the 
next 
time 
your 
phone' 
Mail.a 
PP is 
opened 
catches 
up. 
If she's 
not 
getting 
these 
messag 
es for 
exampl 
e, it's 
not 
related 
and 
will 
require 
further 
explora 
tion 
(might

be on 
the 
iCloud 
side, 
for 
exampl 
e).
