HI Marz and sorry for the delay in response...the only possibility I can see is to 
pencil in Sunday March 3rd. Jeffrey is to fly in to NY from Paris this day however 
and I am not sure of his timing. I don't know where Matt is located ...would he 
have to fly to NY also? Maybe we should circle back as the date approaches. 
Besides this date, I do not see when Jeffrey will be in NY over a Fri-Sun...but his 
schedule always changes too. Can we remain fluid?

Good morning 
Thank you for your prompt response. Due to the nature of what Matt does he will travel to 
see people of influence and book for an open ended timeframe with them. I 
recommend that we find them an afternoon or evening booking where Jeffrey & 
Matt have the last meeting for the day, so that they have flexibility to go into the 
evening as long as needed. Would Geoffrey have one of these times available 
in his schedule for an upcoming Friday, Saturday or Sunday? 
I look forward to hearing from you.
