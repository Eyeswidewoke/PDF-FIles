Hello Francois. I have asked Jeffrey what he would like to do and await his reply. To confirm, 
do I cancel the ticket for Nicolas? (FYI-you can not reassign a ticket to someone else. The 
airlines will not let you. We will have to cancel his ticket and then purchase you your own 
ticket).

Dear Lesley 
We are looking for the best time to meet Jeffrey on G.St 
James Island after the hurricane season. 
Fabrice and 
Nicholas schedule is at this time open, except for November 
1st and 14th. We hope that will be compatible with Jeffrey's 
schedule with the objective to all meet on the Island site and 
move forward on the project.
