Dear 
Many thanks for your last Email. Those clarifications give us 
a better vision on the Main Residence project. 
In the way to move forward on the project, we'll need the 
island topographies plan and associated documentation and 
information. 
With those documents we'll be able to start to work; on a first 
preliminary master plan as well as first preliminary studies 
for Main Residence. 
Just one more question. Regarding the Main Residence 
could we suggest to you, other locations on the island, or do 
we need absolutely to keep the previous one. For the Main 
Residence do there's also any visuals requirements or 
recommendation, weather special complementary 
conditions, etc... Who could be architecturally helpful? 
On our side we'll prepare a first proposal for this preliminary 
work mission for the Main Residence, who'll include: 
Island Master Plan 
Main house furnished plan 
Main House Main Section & Elevations 
3D View & Rendering 
Thank you for your assistance, 
Best regards
