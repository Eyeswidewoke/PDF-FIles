Hi Lesley

I have following few notes: 
I. The new sheets that's Nili brought has no duvet cover, so we put clean duvet cover 
from us. 
2. I check the refrigerator and there is lots of good items and it's all good, so I didn't 
throw anything out. 
3. I put the extra towels in the closet next to their bathroom if they happen to ask 
Thanks
