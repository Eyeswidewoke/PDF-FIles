It will just be easier as the hotel likes to see the credit card when you check-in. This will keep us from having to fill out a third-party credit card authorization form that could possibly get denied at the last minute. Bella will make sure to have the money available on your card. Ok!? Lesley > Sent from my iPhone EFTA_R1_01072038 EFTA02267771 |
