They are a bit different than the ones we were looking at yesterday, but perhaps these make more sense if you get a lot of inclement weather. They come in size 9 and I0US..which translates to a size 40 or 41 (correct?) Which would be better? I like this with either the green or the ivory coat...which do you prefer? I will order today...

Hello 
I really like the Sorel Women's Emelie Lace boots! They look durable and I like 
the color. They are a bit different than the ones we were looking at yesterday, but perhaps these 
make more sense if you get a lot of inclement weather. They come in size 9 and I0US..which 
translates to a size 40 or 41 (correct?) Which would be better? I like this with either the green 
or the ivory coat...which do you prefer? I will order today...
