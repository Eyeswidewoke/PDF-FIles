She has a few more apartment renovation bills and was wondering how Jeffrey would like to handle...perhaps through wire transfer? If so, her accountant can send the bank details. Let me know what you guys think! Best, Rebecca Drescher Assistant to Peggy Siegal EFTA_R1_00981006 EFTA02230156 |

Hi 
Peggy wanted me to check in as she would like to know how Jeffrey would like to handle the last 
portion of her $30k birthday gift. 
She has a few more apartment renovation bills and was wondering how Jeffrey would like to 
handle...perhaps through wire transfer? If so, her accountant can send the bank details. 
Let me know what you guys think! 
Best,
