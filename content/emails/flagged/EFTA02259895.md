precious! I think 
you will enjoy 
being in the 
burbs with your 
family. It's nice 
to have space! I 
will certainly 
keep you in mind 
if I hear of 
anything out this 
way. If I were 
you I would get 
in with a head 
hunter in this are 
if you really 
want to be here! 
Word of mouth 
is always best 
but good to have 
your name in 
with someone 
looking for you 
also. We are all 
doing well here. 
Enjoying the 
season for sure. 
Take care!

March I st. I just 
started a new 
job, which I like 
but I am a bit 
worried about 
the commute and 
having Leo in 
daycare for 12 
hours a day. I 
thought I should 
start putting 
feelers out there 
in case there are 
any good 
opportunities in 
the 
Greenwich/Stam 
ford/White 
Plains market. I 
remember you 
mentioned a 
friend was 
looking for an 
assistant a 
couple years ago 
so was hoping if 
anything like that 
came up again, 
maybe you could 
consider passing 
my resume 
along. Right now 
I'm working as 
an Executive 
Assistant to the 
CEO of a new 
multi family real 
estate company 
owned by 
Blackstone (we 
don't have a 
name yet).
