So, I'am thinking maybe better just hire the moving company, who can provide the 
insurance paper and will be able to disassemble the bed and deliver it to the 
addrese where Jojo would like? 
I also have a table and two chairs, can Jojo be interested in it as well? ( Photo 
attached) <IMG_7589.jpeg> 
Ill connect with the moving company right now and check the price for moving out 
process. 
Will be right back to you
