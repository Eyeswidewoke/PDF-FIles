Hello to you both, 
You're both already briefed, so I'll keep this short. 
Bryan is building Kernel, and today I spoke with Masha about the potential 
value of him and Jeffrey chatting. Masha has spoken 
with Jeffrey, and will be working with his team to 
hopefully coordinate time to connect before Bryan 
leaves on Weds. 
@Masha: I'll let you take it from here. 
Thanks so much!
