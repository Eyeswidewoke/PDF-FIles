1113 has been cleaned, but the workers will be installing the column in there tomorrow and 
then the measuring guy is coming on Thursday. 8A is free, but not as clean. So it is 
up to her. 
Please let me know where she decides to stay and until when, just so we do not disturb her 
accidentally. 
Thanks.
