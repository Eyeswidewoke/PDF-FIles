Any scoops if Jeffrey will leave on Friday? Last I heard, rumor was he was not going to 
the ranch this weekend, Brice said he was going to return to LSJ on Saturday, I'm 
planning to come to New York tomorrow at 6 PM do you think our departure is 
still Friday or is Saturday possible? ***do you have appointments late in the 
afternoon for JE on Friday? 
Any info would help 
Thx
