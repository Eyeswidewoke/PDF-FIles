Re: Confirming Appt tomorrow at 12pm 
Hi Lesley, 
My apologies, but I spoke too soon. Unfortunately, we cannot accommodate Jeffrey 
today. We have two aestheticians out sick/hospital/surgeries - not a good week 
for us! I'm sorry for any inconvenience this may have caused. Is he available 
next week to reschedule? 
Best, 
Kristhle
