Dear 
Many thanks for your last Email. Those clarifications give us a better vision on the Main 
Residence project. 
In the way to move forward on the project, we'll need the island topographies plan and 
associated documentation and information. 
With those documents we'll be able to start to work; on a first preliminary master plan as 
well as first preliminary studies for Main Residence. 
Just one more question. Regarding the Main Residence could we suggest to you, other 
locations on the island, or do we need absolutely to keep the previous one. For the Main 
Residence do there's also any visuals requirements or recommendation, weather special 
complementary conditions, etc... Who could be architecturally helpful?
