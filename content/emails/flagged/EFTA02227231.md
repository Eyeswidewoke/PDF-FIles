Harnican(a): 
Hi 
. Can you please show your own credit card to 
the hotel when you check in on Monday please. I need to 
fill out a credit card authorization form in order for 
Jeffrey to pay for the room, but the department that can 
send me this form does not open until Monday. Due to 
the time difference I will not be able to fill out this form 
until after you have checked in. I will have it done before 
you check out on Tuesday so they should charge Jeffrey's 
card for the stay and not yours. But in order for you to 
check in, they will need to see your card...is that ok?
