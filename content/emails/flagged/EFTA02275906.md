Hello 
. The heat in your apartment is working 
well. There was a repair yesterday done on the heating 
system. The air conditioners where also winterized. 
The apartment is warm , Tomorrow a new dishwasher 
is being delivered and installed. We will also look at the 
ceiling and repairing that. 
Let me know if you need anything else. 
Thank you Andrew.

Hi Andrew and Anthony, 
Thank you very much for your 
coordination in addressing the 
heating issue. 
Could you please kindly update us from yesterday what exactly is the 
issue with the heating system in 
my apartment? 
As of this morning, it still barely works. Cesar was at my apartment on 
Sunday and said that there is a need for 
additional lattice installation to let the heat 
to come through, is that correct?
