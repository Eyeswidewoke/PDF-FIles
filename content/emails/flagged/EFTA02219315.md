Re: 
hi lesley, 
Yes he did! 
He has found a fault in a window and said that there is 2 pieces he has to order 
(2 pieces that are broken and therefore it is impossible to open the window). But 
that is not urgent and I am sure he will take care of it. What was important -
lamps and shades, he fixed perfectly. 
thanks for asking, 
Nili
