book it this way on my end. As fro now business sold out, but she can call Aeroflot 
mileage line, once ticket is issued, and put herself on wait list? Not sure how Aeroflot 
works. They will not talk to me on mileage line. Let me first try to price it as flex fare.

Of course. I looked and Jet Blue has such a fare. I think it is the fate where you can 
choose a seat and check a bag. So always a little more. But I think that is the economy 
seat you always give me.

can you tell me what Economy Flex is? Is it only available on Aeroflot? if you purchase 
'economy flex' is it easier to upgrade to biz? As far as I can tell you never even offer such 
a price tag to me...? I have heard of premium economy...biz and then first seats...is it 
when you get to 'check a bag and choose your seat'? 
never mind...I recall she hates flying through JFK..

available...thanks

what is economy flex? is that a better seat than economy seat? if so, yes, price it for me if it 
exists. however, she still could not upgrade herself to BIZ since all BIZ seats are sold out, 
right? 
Business class is sold out, so no upgrades available. Pricing economy flex.

Morning...can you tell me if there is any flight on Sunday April 14 from Miami to Moscow 
where we can purchase an economy seat and then the passenger can upgrade herself to 
biz? and if she does, how much money it would cost her to do so.? Is there any flight that 
has 'economy flex'?
