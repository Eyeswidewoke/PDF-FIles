Hi. 
Yesterday morning he called to 
yet again to reschedule for 
Thursday or Friday. Once he 
starts hanging the gates the 
work will take two to three 
days. 
Tomorrow the second beach 
well for the desal unit on GSJ 
will be going in along with the 
brine outflow well. That work 
will be two to three days.
