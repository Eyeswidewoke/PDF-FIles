Final answer. Yes. 
Side question: How many of the recipients are in France? Are any outside of France and US? 
This is my logistical mind at work, but the cell fimctions require purchasing watches specific for 
each country (and they don't work outside their home country)... it's really a small thing tho, 
because the watch will use the iPhone's network first anyway.
