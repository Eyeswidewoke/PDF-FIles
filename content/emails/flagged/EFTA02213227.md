| **To** | bellakle' Hi Bella, I think this is the best option for my parents. I talked to them they actually prefer to take a different flight rather than S7 or Aeroflot because these p horrible and old. They said they will be just fine flying through Finland. It also the shortest flight by houi hrs and they will have a full day in Saint Petersburg to see my little brother who study there but becaw student campus we will need to get them a hotel for one night and they can fly back next day on the e‘ interview. Here are details of a flight from Saint Petersburg to Ulan Ude. This is the best option I was t flight duration and price but if you have anything better I am open to consider:) thank you!
