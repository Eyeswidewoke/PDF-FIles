Hi Lesley -
Hope you had a great Christmas! 
I'm just getting back into the office today and seeing this. Sony that this was 
ordered incorrectly.

It looks like the single tour watch band is no longer available, otherwise I'd say we 
could just make a swap through a retail store. 
So, in this case, we would have to submit for a return of the original watch (double 
tour) and a purchase of the new watch (single tour). There is a 4 
week ship time on this model. 
Let me know if. 
would still like to continue with the return/purchase and I'll 
help you get everything coordinated.
