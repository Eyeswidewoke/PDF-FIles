• There is a way Mr. Epstein can look at his lab results, but he would have to 
sign up to the system and set up an account. If he does not have a Weill Cornell 
Connect Account yet, I encourage Mr. Epstein to sign up for one as this is a

Epstein to sign up.

letter from Mr. Epstein requesting the lab results and it is to include his name, 
date of birth, the labs he is requesting and include the information of where he 
needs those labs sent and then his signature.
