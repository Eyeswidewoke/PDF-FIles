Hi Jeffrey, It was lovely seeing you again and I'm glad we were able to connect while you're still in town.

Hi Jeffrey, 
It was lovely seeing you again and I'm glad we were able to connect while you're 
still in town. As I've mentioned, me and 
are determined to 
grow our company and we're even planning to rename it in a less 
targeted name soon (Millenium communications with Crypto PR Lab 
being a sister company - thoughts?). 
The idea is to focus on crypto PR, business speaker agency, events organization 
(such as Davos) with global recognition. We're very excited about it 
:) 
Also as I've mentioned, we'd like to raise capital and we really need some advise on

what direction to take. I've put together a very raw picture of what 
we currently have in terms of financials and I'd really appreciate your 
take on how to build a solid roadmap to raise some capital and build 
bigger operations. 
Looking forward to your feedback!
