Dear Lesley --
I just got home. As Jeffrey might have told you, 
I am free almost all the time. The conference 
that I go to once a year is about the only time 
I go anywhere. Let me know when Jeffrey is free, 
remind me of the address and those infernal door 
codes, and I'll make sure to be there. 
With best wishes, 
D
