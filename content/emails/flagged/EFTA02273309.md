Hello Les, 
Thank you so much for this. It looks like the trains are running again on sunday! 
Just the tickets are very expensive which I didnt anticipate. There is only business 
left on the Saturday morning outward journey which gets in at 
11.17am, and then it doesnt allow me to book the return in standard. 
I tried to book it as two separate trips to see if it would work out 
cheaper but it only saved about 20 pounds. 
I have an appointment between 6pm and 7pm London time but will be back on line 
after that!
