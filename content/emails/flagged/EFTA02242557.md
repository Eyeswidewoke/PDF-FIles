| **CC** | Scott, Thank you for letting us walk through the house. I noticed lots of traps and sticky sheets up in the attic. Have there been lots of mice lately? I am thinking I want to come and vacuum out the attic of all the dead bugs and get rid of many of the traps. It just does not show so well if someone thinks there is a big mice issue. Obviously I do not want to cause an uptick in mice but there was only one in a trap that I saw so I am guessing not huge issue. I notice some rain spots below the fans in the attic. I am guessing that it is just a bit of spatter from heavy storms but wondered if it had been very wet up there. The front porch and back porch. I want to have someone come and repoint the stones and so forth. I do not think they will need inside access but wanted to let you know. I want to get someone in to repair the broken window in the kitchen and the faucet in the master. I will schedule around your housekeeper being there if that is ok. I want to put the house on the market tomorrow April 27th. I am going to give keys to the realtor so they can put boxes on the front porch.

Scott, 
Thank you for letting us walk through the house. 
I noticed lots of traps and sticky sheets up in the attic. Have there been lots of mice 
lately? I am thinking I want to come and vacuum out the attic of all the dead bugs and 
get rid of many of the traps. It just does not show so well if someone thinks there is a 
big mice issue. Obviously I do not want to cause an uptick in mice but there was only 
one in a trap that I saw so I am guessing not huge issue. 
I notice some rain spots below the fans in the attic. I am guessing that it is just a bit of 
spatter from heavy storms but wondered if it had been very wet up there. 
The front porch and back porch. I want to have someone come and repoint the stones 
and so forth. I do not think they will need inside access but wanted to let you know. 
I want to get someone in to repair the broken window in the kitchen and the faucet in 
the master. I will schedule around your housekeeper being there if that is ok. 
I want to put the house on the market tomorrow April 27th. I am going to give keys to 
the realtor so they can put boxes on the front porch.
