arrangements that meet your individual needs. We consider various factors in identifying 
travel suppliers to you and recommending specific itineraries. In this role, we are acting as

goals, and from time to time may also provide incentives to our travel counselors. Certain 
suppliers may also provide compensation to us for various marketing and administrative 
services that we perform for them, such as granting them access to our marketing 
channels, participating in marketing programs and supporting technology initiatives. In 
addition, we receive compensation from suppliers when customers use the American 
Express Card or other American Express products to pay for supplier products and 
services. From time to time we may enter into other business relationships with suppliers 
and these arrangements, including levels and types of compensation and incentives we

may consider a number of factors, including supplier availability and your preferences. The 
relationships we have with suppliers may also influence the suppliers we identify and the 
itineraries we recommend.
