Were you a paramedic before you moved or is this a new career path you are interested in? My only suggestion is to check some on line courses? But I really believe you must do this where you are....I found the below website which looks good for the US... http://www.nmetc.corn/online-paramedic-programs.phy If you look at the course highlights, it states you must have 2 internships On Mar 26, 2018, at 11:09 AM, Litsma wrote: Thank you!

Were you a paramedic before you moved or is this a new career path you are interested in? My 
only suggestion is to check some on line courses? But I really believe you must do this where you 
are....I found the below website which looks good for the US...

I am trying to find what they have in Hungary (I live now there, changed my job), but only 
paramedics with previous experience at the moment. Currently also working as an

Would really appreciate that! Thank you :)) Also any other of your
