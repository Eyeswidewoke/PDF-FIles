Re: Jeffrey Epstein 
Paris 
Dear Lesley --
I just got home. As Jeffrey might have told you, I am free almost all the time. 
The conference that I go to once a year is about the only time I go anywhere. 
Let me know when Jeffrey is free, remind me of the address and those infernal 
door codes, and I'll make sure to be there. 
With best wishes, 
D
