Thank you for this...I am not aware of our 
arriving Paris? do you have the 
specifics? or is this something I am to book as well for Sept. 9th? ( 
from Moscow to 
Paris on Sept. 9th?)

is traveling from Novosibirsk (Russia), 
Coming to Paris on the 7th around 230pm, leaving on the 9th back to 
Novosibirsk 
(Probably would be great to find a flight leaving Paris around the same time when 
arrives from Moscow )
