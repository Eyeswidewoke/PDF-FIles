| **To** | Dear Lesley, On Friday a gift should arrive for Jeffrey to N Y with Fedex, tracking number I would really appreciate if you could arrange that it is received when expected. Would be really nice if somebody could take off the first layer of packing, so that gift wrapping would be seen and 2 letters that are together with the box put on top of the box when giving it to Jeffrey. Hope your Christmas were calm and beautiful! Have a lovely day! EFTA_R1_00993183 EFTA02234453 |
