Greetings Aaron, 
I spoke with Heather this morning regarding the above referenced quote for 
TWA on St. Thomas. 
The project was approved. I would like to pay the 50% deposit via credit 
card today, so we can be scheduled for the repairs as soon as possible, 
if possible. 
My contact number is 340-775-2525. Larry is currently out of the country, so 
he asked me to assist in his absence. 
Thank you and kind regards,
