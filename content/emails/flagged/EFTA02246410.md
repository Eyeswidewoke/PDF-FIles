Hi Jeffrey 
Hi Hadi, 
Hadi made my trip to Seattle such a fantastic experience. He is a great 
athlete, angel investor (early investor in Facebook, 
Dropbox, Uber), serial entrepreneur and a founder of 
a non-profit organisation, Code.org.
Jeffrey is a very dear friend for 7 years now. He is a brilliant financier, 
investor, philanthropist, promotes education. 
I am sure you will have a lot to talk about and find exciting business 
opportunities together :-)
