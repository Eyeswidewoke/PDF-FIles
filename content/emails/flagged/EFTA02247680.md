Window Issue in 11J-can you disarm the alarm today? 
Hi 
wanted Anthony take a look at your window issue since you will be away 
for awhile. Might you be able to disarm the alarm now so he can go and take a 
look at the problem? Remind me, is the window in the bedroom? 
Let me know... 
Thanks Lesley
