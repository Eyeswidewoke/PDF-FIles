Ah, totally understand! The only thing is we have our weekly staff meetings on 
Wednesdays between 11-12, so since the facial is an hour, I would have you 
finishing at 11 before the meeting or starting at 12 after the meeting and 
finishing around 2.. ?

He is off next week for the jewish holidays so I'm happy to get you in for skin 
those days, of course, but for filler stuff we will have to do Tuesday the 2nd, 
if that's okay?
