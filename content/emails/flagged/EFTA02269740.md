correct :) 
Hotels usually make you check out early in the thy (11am is typical) since you 
have an evening flight on Dec. 16th (flight departs at 6:40pm) you just say you 
prefer to pay for another night at the hotel so you have a place to stay during the 
day until time to depart for your flight. 
don't be embarrassed! ask anything you need
