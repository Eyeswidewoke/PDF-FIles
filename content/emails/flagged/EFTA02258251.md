| **Subject** | Wifi password in 11J Hi Les, Nilli would like to change the wifi password. That's something we typically would not allow but since they're staying there for a while should we let them do it? They have someone that can do it for them.

Hi Les, 
Nilli would like to change the wifi password. That's something we typically would not 
allow but since they're staying there for a while should we let them do it? They 
have someone that can do it for them. 
Thanks
