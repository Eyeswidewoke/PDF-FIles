Hi. 
Yesterday morning he called to yet again to reschedule for Thursday or Friday. Once he starts 
hanging the gates the work will take two to three days. 
Tomorrow the second beach well for the desal unit on GSJ will be going in along with the brine 
outflow well. That work will be two to three days.
