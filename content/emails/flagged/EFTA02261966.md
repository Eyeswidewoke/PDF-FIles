| **CC** | Lyndsey Belle T ler < Max Tibett Good morning Lesley! I would have written you in the day. The trip went very well, and I want to thank you for your hospitality and congratulate you for the great organizational capacity. They were two very intense days, as soon as we arrived we went to make the survey until late afternoon, in the morning we visited both islands again and I could clarify with the many ideas I had. In these days I will make drawings and prepare renderings to clearly illustrate my intervention. I wait for your assistant who welcomed us on the island to send us further photographic documentation and the topographic map of the island. Every works that I'm going to do will be interactive. If we realize what I have in mind it will be a masterpiece. I think that by October 31st I will be able to present you the project. Do you think it will be possible to organize a meeting in New York for the presentation?

Good morning Lesley! 
I would have written you in the day. 
The trip went very well, and I want to thank you for your hospitality and 
congratulate you for the great organizational capacity. 
They were two very intense days, as soon as we arrived we went to make the 
survey until late afternoon, in the morning we visited both islands 
again and I could clarify with the many ideas I had. 
In these days I will make drawings and prepare renderings to clearly illustrate my 
intervention. 
I wait for your assistant who welcomed us on the island to send us further 
photographic documentation and the topographic map of the island. 
Every works that I'm going to do will be interactive. 
If we realize what I have in mind it will be a masterpiece. 
I think that by October 31st I will be able to present you the project. 
Do you think it will be possible to organize a meeting in New York for the 
presentation? 
Best regards 
Jago
