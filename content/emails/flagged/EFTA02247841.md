Today I am taking a drive north (88mfies) to go visit NGS Power where jeffrey sent a wire for $46,325.34 for 2 generators for his island. It has been almost 2 months and still no generators. The company has answered very few questions and when they do answer the phone they say the motors are on back order from their supplier. Jeffrey wants me to speak to the owner Jared and get his money back. Any help on diplomatically getting the money back would be great. I am told if I can even actually meet with Jared that will be a win and to threaten the next visit will be from Jeffreys attorney. This all being said, we ordered one generator from this company last year and All was received and fine. Our accounting sept thinks NGS May have a cash cow problem and is using our funds for different purposes. I will be in the car for an hour and half. If you had 5 minutes we can talk on the phone. I won't leave here until I :30am so I am there at 1 ish. Love, lesley!! Sent from my iPhone EFTA_R1_01027798 EFTA02247841 |

Morning!! Today I am taking a drive north (88mfies) to go visit NGS Power where jeffrey sent a 
wire for $46,325.34 for 2 generators for his island. It has been almost 2 months and still no 
generators. The company has answered very few questions and when they do answer the phone 
they say the motors are on back order from their supplier. Jeffrey wants me to speak to the owner 
Jared and get his money back. Any help on diplomatically getting the money back would be 
great. I am told if I can even actually meet with Jared that will be a win and to threaten the next 
visit will be from Jeffreys attorney. This all being said, we ordered one generator from this 
company last year and All was received and fine. Our accounting sept thinks NGS May have a 
cash cow problem and is using our funds for different purposes. I will be in the car for an hour 
and half. If you had 5 minutes we can talk on the phone. I won't leave here until I :30am so I am 
there at 1 ish. Love, lesley!!
