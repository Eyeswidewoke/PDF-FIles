Could you please kindly update us from yesterday what 
exactly is the 
issue with the 
heating system 
in 
my apartment? 
As of this morning, it still barely works. Cesar was at my 
apartment on 
Sunday and said 
that there is a 
need for 
additional 
lattice 
installation to 
let the heat to 
come through, 
is that correct?
