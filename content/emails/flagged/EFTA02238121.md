Dear Lesley,

If you would be so kind as to forward our sincere gratitude to Jeffrey for his time and 
counsel. It was extremely valuable and has already helped us fine-tune our story. 
Please also let him know that we made contact with Steven Sinofsky yesterday, per his 
recommendation. Steven said that meeting early stage companies via Skype is not

will absolutely make note of connecting with him when we next schedule a trip to

Jeffrey also mentioned an introduction to Joi Ito who I believe is more local and accessible 
for us in the NYC/Boston area. Wondering if he would be open to making that 
introduction at this time. 
Thank you again.
