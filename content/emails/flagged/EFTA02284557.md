Hi 
I see JE copied me on the Bannon trip„ 
He is going to S11' on Saturday? 
JE said he would fly Sunday from STT to NY on Sunday, do you think sunday to 
NY is a go? 
The reason I asked, 
i am using Darren and Chip as Pilots on Sunday, Darren returns to St Thomas on 
Saturday afternoon. Chip is on St Thomas now. 
I'm just trying to figure out if all is covered, Darren is the only one that can fly the 
helicopter as well as me, 
Jeffrey sent me home yesterday to get some home time, I'm just trying to make sure 
all is covered? 
Thx
