Hello 
it is `Jeffrey's assistant 
I know how much Jeffrey values your knowledge and skills! could you tell me what 
in your opinion are the most impotrant skills I can learn and courses I 
can take. 
my goal is to go somewhere and learn, not just online at my place ( it doesn't seem 
to help me) and get a certificate by the end of the training, so I can 
have it if I ever needed 
Whatever you think will be worth considering. 
thank you!
