| **To** | Him How are you? I hope your everything is going well. Actually I need to ask you more time to finish the painting. The painting is still in progress in this moment. I had no enough time to paint recently so I feel it is in 70% now. I don't want to make this painting look cheap with rushed. I will finish this painting in happy way if you can give me couple more months. Sometimes detail works of 30% is takes more time than 70% of finished status. I hope you can understand about this. Please let me know how do you think and I'll do my best if you want me to finish this painting sooner. I'm so sorry about postponing every time.
