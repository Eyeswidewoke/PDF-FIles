Hi
ncil that date in, what times may work for Geoffrey March 3rd? 
Matt would have to fly to NY, though he can fly anywhere in the USA easily. If there is another option 
of location where they could meet, we could explore that if you would like to send some dates and 
times through, I could check Matt's schedule for alignment. 
We can remain fluid to other opportunities for them to connect also as they arise. 
Kindly,

Thank you for your prompt response. Due to the nature of what Matt does he will travel to see 
people of influence and book for an open ended timeframe with them. I recommend that we 
find them an afternoon or evening booking where Geoffrey & Mari have the last meeting for the 
day, so that they have flexibility to go into the evening as long as needed. Would Geoffrey have 
one of these times available in his schedule for an upcoming Friday, Saturday or Sunday? 
I look forward to hearing from you.
