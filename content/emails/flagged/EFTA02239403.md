My name is Lesley and I coordinated the ski trip for and IIIIi—I understand you have emailed re a lesson you feel she needs to pay for on Feb. 14th. From what has explained, she and took the 4 lessons we originally paid for (2 lessons on Feb. 12 and 2 lessons on Feb. 13). Apparently on WEd. Feb. 14th, and were skiing together where they `bumped into' your ski instructor on the slope and he `invited' them to join the group. They skied 2 runs with the instructor/group then went on their own way and finished the day. At no time did the instructor tell them he would charge for a day of lessons and they genuinely thought the short time they spent with the instructor was for free! Can you kindly confirm this scenario with your instructor? Both young ladies say they had a tremendous time and enjoyed the lessons Feb. 12 and 13-but truly considered Feb. 14 an honest coincidence Thank you, Lesley EFTA_R1_01008538 EFTA02239403 |

Hello Lizzie. My name is Lesley and I coordinated the ski trip for 
and 
IIIIi—I understand you have emailed 
re a lesson you 
feel she needs to pay for on Feb. 14th. From what 
has explained, she and 
took the 4 lessons we originally paid for (2 lessons on Feb. 12 and 2 
lessons on Feb. 13). Apparently on WEd. Feb. 14th, 
and 
were skiing 
together where they `bumped into' your ski instructor on the slope and he 
`invited' them to join the group. They skied 2 runs with the instructor/group 
then went on their own way and finished the day. At no time did the instructor 
tell them he would charge for a day of lessons and they genuinely thought the 
short time they spent with the instructor was for free! Can you kindly confirm 
this scenario with your instructor? 
Both young ladies say they had a tremendous time and enjoyed the lessons Feb. 12 
and 13-but truly considered Feb. 14 an honest coincidence 
Thank you,
