HI 
I always reconfirm Jeffrey's appointments—so you will need to call or 
email with anyone he makes appointments with the morning of the appointment-so on 
Monday you will call 
and say: Hi .1•...this is 
from Jeffrey 
Epstein's office. I wanted to reconfirm you will come see Jeffrey today at 
6:30/7pm...) On Tuesday you will need to call Vincenzo and say the same. If 
Jeffrey adds in appointments (which I am sure he will) you will do the same with 
those people. I have their phone numbers on the itinerary 
TBD- To Be Determined. When I don't know what time a person can come see Jeffrey 
or I have asked someone to come see Jeffrey but the person has not confirmed, I
