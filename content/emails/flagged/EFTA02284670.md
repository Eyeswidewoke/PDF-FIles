Hi 
I see JE copied me on the Bannon trip„ 
He is going to STT on Saturday? 
JE said he would fly Sunday from STT to NY on Sunday, do you think 
sunday to NY is a go? 
The reason I asked, 
i am using Darren and Chip as Pilots on Sunday, Darren returns to St 
Thomas on Saturday afternoon. Chip is on St 
Thomas now. 
I'm just trying to figure out if all is covered, Darren is the only one that 
can fly the helicopter as well as me, 
Jeffrey sent me home yesterday to get some home time, I'm just trying 
to make sure all is covered? 
Thx 
Larry
