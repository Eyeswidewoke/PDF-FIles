Hi Natasha...Jeffrey would like to book a 'meeting room' at the TED conference hotel April 
10-14, 2018 AND the 2 BEST rooms we can reserve for April 11-13 (suites? one 
bedrooms?) This is always a challenging request! I am still not positive what hotel the TED 
conference is being held at...I have emailed the TED people to find out...maybe you know? 
It is in Vancouver this year. With the 'meeting room' (hospitality room?) Jeffrey says he will 
host 15 people...we would cater breakfast, lunch and 'happy hour' each day... 
Wanted to get this out there now...It may be the Marriott Vancouver who hosts? 
uh....Help!???? :) Lesley
