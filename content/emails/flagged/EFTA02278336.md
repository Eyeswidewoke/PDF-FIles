Hi Lesley, 
You're right about things being a bit chaotic. There are boxes 
everywhere despite adopting a Marie Kondo approach to my things 
prior to the move! Monday would be better as I hope to be more 
organized by then. 
Enjoy the weekend,

Hi Lesley, 
I am moving into my 
apartment on 
March 14. Is it possible to hold on to the 
gift card until then? Otherwise I will be 
teaching on Friday at P.S. 217 on 
Roosevelt Island. It's not the easiest place
