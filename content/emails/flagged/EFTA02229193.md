Hello Merwin and 
Merwin, I see the items we were waiting for to complete the gift for 
have 
arrived! 
=, 
can you lease
 facilitate sending this ft from Jeffrey to 
via Fed Ex today? 
would like the below form filled 
out so she does not need to pay taxes on it ...it is a gift form from 
Fed Ex (when you go to Fed Ex talk to them and I am sure they can 
walk you through filling it out!!) The address to send to is below. 
Please be sure to give me the Fed Ex tracking number once 
completed. This will probably be expensive to send since the box 
EFTA_R1_00977490 
EFTA02229193

will be large...please get the rates to determine best method to ship! 
Bella may have an account # you can use for `freight'? once the box 
is organized let Bella know the size...(Bella, for some reason I 
thought you had a way to send large boxes for less?)
