| **To** | Lesley Groff a Hello Lesley, Dr. Chen mentioned to me that Mr. Epstein will be referring a VIP patient to him? I will need their contact information so that I can have them scheduled. Also, is the patient International with International insurance or will they be self-pay? If the patient is international then the appointment will need to go through our International Services Department here at Columbia and they will organize everything. Thanks!

Hello Lesley, 
Dr. Chen mentioned to me that Mr. Epstein will be referring a VIP patient to him? I 
will need their contact information so that I can have them scheduled. Also, is the 
patient International with International insurance or will they be self-pay? If the patient 
is international then the appointment will need to go through our International 
Services Department here at Columbia and they will organize everything. Thanks!
