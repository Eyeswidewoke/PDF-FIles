Hello Francois. I have asked Jeffrey what he would like to do and await his reply. To confirm, 
do I cancel the ticket for Nicolas? (FYI-you can not reassign a ticket to someone else. The 
airlines will not let you. We will have to cancel his ticket and then purchase you your own ticket).

Fabrice and 
Nicholas schedule i8 at this time open, except for November

move forward on the project.
