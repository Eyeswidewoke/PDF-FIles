P.s. So happy! Jeffrey offered me this treat ))) 
SCHOOL ITALY: 
So, I also like the course audiences of art (20 hours) must be 
interesting! With 4 modules of 
cooking. (12 hours) during 7 
days ( around 5 hours per day 
for school staff) 
I have to check the schedule of classes in school. Waiting for 
their answer. 
http;//aefirenze.it/en/courses/art-courses/art-history/282-art-
sites.html 
I'm thinking to go first to Bolognia (from Paris straight 1,5 hours 
flight; from my hometown just 1 
stop, according to flight from 
Rostov to Florence 3 stops) So, 
spend there 1 day come around 
10-11 pm on 20th May, ??rent a 
hotel to walk during the day, 
rent the car 
(https://www.hertz.com/rentaca 
r/reservation/) and by evening 
21 we will be in Florence). In 
Florence I'm thinking about to 
rent an Airbnb apt for a week. It 
will be more freedome and 
space and less expensive 
according to hotel. 
This apartment for example: 
https: • airhnb con) rooms/2872042?checkin=2018-05-
22&sottrce=handoff-
ios&guests=2&checkotit- 20 1 8-

EFTA02246033

So, If all will be good, on 29 morning we rent ( for 2 days) a car 
(https://www.hertz.com/rentaca 
r/rcscrvation/ around $70 per 
day ) and go to San Gimiano 
city for one day, than to Pisa 
city ( 1 night, 1 day) ??need a 
hotel and than during 4 hours 
through the coast road to 
Milano on 31 of may, 5 days in 
Milano. Didn't decide yct what 
to rent better (apt or hotel). 
From Milan I'm happy to comeback straight to USA)))) 
Thank You so much Lesley!!!
