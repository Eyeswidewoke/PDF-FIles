as I have said in the initial mail bellow : "I haven't done any 3D yet as I would like to be sure you 
like the general line of the project.» 
Last time , Jeffrey has commented only the plans, so I want his thought regarding the plan and the 
functionality of the house and then I will do the model 3D. 
It could be the style he wants. 
Looking forward your comments.

You will find a site plan of the all island with several points, 
conceptual, on the island which, 
I think, are interesting place. 
You will see the new proposal for the house . I have kept the 
same general idea but with 
modifications following all 
comments you did. 
I haven't done any 3D yet as I would like to be sure you like the 
general line of the project. 
I am available to talk with you about it . 
Hope you will like the general idea of the project. 
Best regards.
