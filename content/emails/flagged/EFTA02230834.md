Dear Jeffrey, 
Hope you arc great! Not sure if you received my previous email with some talents that I was able 
to find.. 
Next week I'm coming to NY for a few concerts. I will be comin to ether with m friend • ianist 
With him we will have our concert 
. I was wondering if you would have a free apartment (or two) for us to stay 
in for one week? I didn't want to bother you so I was trying to find some other accommodations 
but I'm still struggling in finding a place with a decent location... if I found something it was 
always out of Manhattan.. 
Anyways, I hope I get a chance to see you while in NY (would love to bring you some homemade 
bread!). Hope you're having fun and looking forward to hearing from you!
