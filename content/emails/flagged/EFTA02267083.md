This flight was tricky due to it being so close to the travel dates. Many flights sold out completely. Lesley Sent from my iPhone On Dec 31, 2018, at 8:42 AM, wrote: Hi, Lesley!

About Kaliningrad, sure, I just check if they have same date and same airport Aeroflot su 1006 January 8th And return Su 1001 January 11th May be we can just change those ones that we had on 3-7th? Or it's easier to book a new one? Should I send confirmation number you sent me before?
