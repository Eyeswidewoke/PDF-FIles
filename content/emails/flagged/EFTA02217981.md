PLEASE allow yourself ample time to get this done before your departure time—I would arrive an hour early for just in case! You must present them 2 forms of ID: your passport with your picture in it and another form of ID (drivers license, school ID, etc) Next time, if you prefer, it may be better for you to just purchase your ticket yourself with your own credit card and get reimbursed—this would save yourself the time at the ticket counter because you could just print your ticket at home. Something to consider.... OK? > On Jul 6, 2017, at 11:55 AM, Margherita > wrote: > Hi Lesley, I am sorry to bother you but I can't print my ticket.
