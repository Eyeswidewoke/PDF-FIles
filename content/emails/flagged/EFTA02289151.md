risky to fly that day, the timing is too tight. So let's do as you offered. Fly on Monday morning

departure, they will have to be at the airport 2-3 hours prior to departure, at 11:25a-
12:25pm. So, depends what time they are picking up passports, I assume it is at

Direct flight from Moscow to LA is at 12:00, no way they will have enough time in 
Moscow to go to the city. Flight from Ulan Ude arrives to 
different airport in Moscow. Latest connecting time from Moscow
