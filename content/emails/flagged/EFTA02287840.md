Just an FYI if you click the File tab on that is on the same level with the name of the sheet there is an Activity log option. It reports who has logged in and what modifications were made. Let me know if you have any problems finding it. Hope this helps. Regards Jruan JRuan On Wed, May 29, 2019 at 11:54 PM Jermaine Ruan S> wrote: Checking now.

Good evening Lesley 
The boss has not logged in as yet. I don't see any entries under his email address. 
Just an FYI 
if you click the File tab on that is on the same level with the name of the sheet there is an Activity 
log option. It reports who has logged in and what modifications were made. Let me know if you 
have any problems finding it. Hope this helps. 
Regards
