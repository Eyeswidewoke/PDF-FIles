Hello Lesley, 
I've been wanting a Peloton bike for a long time and it was very thoughtful of 
Jeffrey to remember. That would be an amazing birthday gift 
especially now since I fractured my neck in two places and my doctor 
recommends exercises that keep my cervical spine stable. No more 
jogging, tennis, or dancing for a while :-( 
but the stationary bike will be perfect. 
Many thanks,
