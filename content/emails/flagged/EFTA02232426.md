were able to get on the hotel! Can you please book the Paridisus this morning for us!!? We 
want to prepay so I'll need to sign a credit card authorization form I think? Please let me 
know! Thanks! (Also we decided to keep the direct flights for 
and the less 
expensive connecting flights for_!). 
Thanks.

Cancun! Thx for checking hotels.

Wow. That is pricey ticket for sister! $3100 outbound and another $1700 for return right? 
`likes. I have no idea what Hotel prices are there but assume this is high season? Is there 
something like $300 a night that is decent?

Jeffrey just called and is asking if the sister can fly from Paris to Miami so the sister can fly 
together from Miami to Cancun. Then way back maybe they can also fly first leg together to 
NY then sister go on to Paris. Sorry. Wish we would have thought of that first.
