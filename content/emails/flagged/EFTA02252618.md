I see Jeffrey has been in more frequently lately and was wondering if he would be interested in purchasing a new 52 pack and we will give him the $2000 Birthday present for Melanie as a gift. The packages don't expire and we can also message over the gift card to Meanie with some products. If so , should we use the EFTA_R1_01041471 EFTA02252618 CC# we have on file. BIG HUG!!!
