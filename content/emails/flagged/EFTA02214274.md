HI 
how nice! Since the pilots are coming we 
need to give them 2 apartments (7J and 10B)...the 
other 2 apartments (8A and 11P) are the studio's 
which are having work done...let me ask Karyna how 
8A and 11P are coming along...perhaps you could 
stay in one of them and your mom and brother could 
take 3M?

Hi La, 
My Mom and brother arc coming to NY for 3 days and JE said if there 
were apartments available they could use 
one (otherwise they can stay at 3M and I 
will stay with my boyfriend). They arc 
arriving late on the 15th and will leave 
either on the 17th or early on the 18th. 
Thank you!
