Hi Lesley -
Sony, I missed this email. 
You likely won't be able to make that purchase with a US credit 
card. 
In the US for example, they verify your billing address for each

it must be linked to a US billing 
address in order to complete the 
purchase. 
Did you guys come to any decision on how you'd like to proceed

Hi Martin...I just got on line to see if I could place the 2 
orders for London 
on the UK 
website...is there 
any reason you see 
that I could not do 
this? 
This would be a great simple solution!
