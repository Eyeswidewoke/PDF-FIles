| **Subject** | Fwd: figur8 / P5 materials Hi It was nice talking to you yesterday. Attached please find information on P5 Health Ventures as well as some in-depth material on one of the more interesting companies they've invested in. Jeffrey asked that I forward to him through you. I recently met the principal David Eigen through a long time friend. I'm working with them to identify potential investors and healthcare providers that would deploy the technologies within their patient populations. David originally started 135 with Dr. Bruce Moskowitz who stepped away when he took a position with the Trump administration to help with the VA. In a meeting yesterday with David Eigen he mentioned Jeffrey by name and said that when Bruce first started P5 Health Ventures Jeffrey was interested in making an investment. It made me note that I knew him and because i think it's really a great group of people and David Eigen has a terrific track record both with the Iridum Fund and Post Road I offered to reach out to him. The kinds of companies they're investing in apply technology to health issues that affect large populations of patients in order to keep them out of the hospital where insurers are reimbursing less to patients and penalizing providers. I'f be hap to s ak with Jeffrey if he has any questions or remains interested. My cell is Please keep it in your records as I told Jeffrey I relocated to the Pa Beac area to facilitate care among the Mount Sinai practices our hospital affiliations and our Board and donor community. i would be happy to help Jeffrey with anything when he's down there.
