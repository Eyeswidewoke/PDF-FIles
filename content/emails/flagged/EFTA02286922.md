That would be an amazing birthday gift especially now since I fractured my neck in two places and my doctor recommends exercises that keep my cervical spine stable. No more jogging, tennis, or dancing for a while :-( but the stationary bike will be perfect. Many thanks, On Wed, May 22, 2019 at 1:55 PM Lesle Groff wrote: Hi Kathy!
