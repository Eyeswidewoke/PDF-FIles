Hello Les, 
I am going because of visa issues. It will be lovely that she is there though. It is not 
without its challenges as NYC is by far preferable to me over London and this 
timeline of packing up my life in two weeks is causing me anxiety and some health 
issues. I had anticipated doing it by October 15th which is when I legally have to 
leave. It is next to impossible to find a decent and affordable place two weeks out. 
And as an interior designer, not made easier, as I have high standards and my eye 
sees everything!! 
Anyway, the positives are, I will still come and visit and I am a British Citizen so the 
opportunity and freedom I have there career wise is incomparable to here. Night 
and day ;) And for that I look forward to it and now my life will be pretty different 
in a positive way!! 
Thank you for your help. lets see if I make the flight or if I have died or had too many 
nervous breakdowns by then!!
