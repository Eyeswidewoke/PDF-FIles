Just the tickets are very expensive which I didnt anticipate. There is only business left on the Saturday morning outward journey which gets in at 11.17am, and then it doesnt allow me to book the return in standard. I tried to book it as two separate trips to see if it would work out cheaper but it only saved about 20 pounds. I have an appointment between 6pm and 7pm London time but will be back on line after that! xx On Thu, Feb 14, 2019 at 3:21 PM Lesley Groff c•- > wrote: there are lots of flights...just let me know...couple of examples below Feb 16: AF1381 depart LHR 6:40am arrive CDG 9am Feb 17: AF1380 depart CDG 9:20pm arrive LHR 9:45pm Feb 16: Easy Jet 8323 Depart 8:10am arrive CDG 10:30am Feb. 17: Vueling 8772 Depart 8:50pm arrive CDG 8:55pm ...lots morc..you can have a look too...

Hello Les, 
Thank you so much for this. It looks like the trains are running again on sunday! 
Just the tickets are very expensive which I didnt anticipate. There is only business left on the 
Saturday morning outward journey which gets in at 11.17am, and then it doesnt allow me to book 
the return in standard. I tried to book it as two separate trips to see if it would work out cheaper 
but it only saved about 20 pounds. 
I have an appointment between 6pm and 7pm London time but will be back on line after that!
