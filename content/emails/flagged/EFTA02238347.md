Snowmass is the major 'Aspen ski resort' — Aspen is the town. Snowmass is about 20 minutes away on convenient shuttle. With more ski in and out options. Most stay at Snowmass, then go to Aspen for shopping and dining. The ski hill in Aspen is smaller and steeper. If they are expert to intermediate skiers and are familiar with this type of terrain, then Aspen might be perfect. Otherwise I might recommend Snowmass. Lift ticket passes work for both Aspen, Snowmass and the two smaller hills in-between called Highlands and Buttermilk. But Snowmass is by far the larger ski area base with three village levels of shopping and dining. Rentals can be picked up at a conveniently located shop or delivered at the lodge. Skiers or snowboarders? Helmets or no helmets? Transportation from the airport is included in most Snowmass packages, but not Aspen. For Aspen we arrange e for a round trip shuttle/taxi.
