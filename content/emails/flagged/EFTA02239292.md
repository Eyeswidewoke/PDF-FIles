Hi 
N415LM was changed to N212JE,,,,the G550 
And N120JE is the GIV which is still in operation but it will be down for 
maintenance for two weeks and then Jeffrey will try to sell it „eventually it 
will go away but I would still keep it on file for now 
N331JE is the Helicopter, 
Bell 430 Hyperion Air, LLC based in St Thomas„ FYI is still a good number as 
well 
Thx
