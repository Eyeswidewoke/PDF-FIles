Oh excellent!! Do you 
have a CC you can show 
when checking in? When 
do you check out? Is the 
room reserved under your 
name? Can I pay for the 
room tomorrow? I need to

Hi. MAsha. 
Are you 
sharing one 
room? 2 
beds? One 
bed? How 
long will you 
stay? The 
breakers is 
nice but 
probably all 
booked up.
