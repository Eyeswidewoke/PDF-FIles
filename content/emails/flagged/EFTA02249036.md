Tell Jeffrey is is a raw image of my pencil sketch that I still need to clean up and colour. He 
should be able to see what designs I am thinking of and if he hates it I can stop and do something 
else! Hopefully he will like it and I carry on with the colouring!

I think I have got an idea but it is quite 
radical for Great St James! I will need this 
weekend to complete the sketch idea and
