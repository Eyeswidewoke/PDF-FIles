I know Anna has done some shopping for restocking in the last week while I've been away, so she might need to add or edit the following, but I believe we still need the following: 12 horse hair brushes 12 combs 12 motion sensor lights 12 dimmer light switches 24 remote control light switches (the kind you plug into the outlet and control with remote) 12 outlet converters (European to U.S.) 2 good household vacuums Lots of Single packaged toothbrushes (the kind JE likes) Eddie Bauer crew neck (not V neck) tee shirts size Large 12 binoculars 8 small white digital clocks for bedside tables Thank you so much!

12 dimmer light switches 
24 remote control light switches (the kind you plug into the outlet and control with remote) 
12 outlet converters (European to U.S.) 
2 good household vacuums 
Lots of Single packaged toothbrushes (the kind JE likes) 
Eddie Bauer crew neck (not V neck) tee shirts size Large 
12 binoculars

Thank you so much!
