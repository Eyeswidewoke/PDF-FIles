Dear Lesley 
We are looking for the best time to 
meet Jeffrey on G.St James Island after the 
hurricane season. 
Fabrice and Nicholas 
schedule is at this time open, except for 
November 1st and 14th. We hope that will be 
compatible with Jeffrey's schedule with the 
objective to all meet on the Island site and 
move forward on the project. 
Please let us know 
Best Regards,
