With that said my trip to NYC is never complete without at least a short walk or visit with JE. As of now Im open all day this coming Friday, then dinner with one of Dominique's business clients.

But wanted to extend the invite! And as far as next week, I'm back Weds/Thurs. - solo - to do radio from approx 2-6pm. Supposed to dinner but can blow them off if need be...
