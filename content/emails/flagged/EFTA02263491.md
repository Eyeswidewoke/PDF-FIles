Hi Lesley -
The support team just got back to me with the 
spreadsheets for shipment and they've advised that they 
no longer ship to the US Virgin Islands. So that means 
those orders will also have to be shipped to you and then 
forwarded to the respective recipients.

distributed to the recipients. 
Quotes: 
• United States: Quote 1 for 
HBRK 112118 SSO_CC_US + 2205191522 B

Hi Lesley -
Attached is the quote for the orders shipping to the US. I haven't 
received the updated

team yet for you to review to 
ensure shipping addresses are 
correct. Once I have that, I'll 
forward it over for you to verify 
the information.
