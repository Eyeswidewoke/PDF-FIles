She can try 1 I P but she is 'scared' of all the apartments 
now. Come Monday (after Dr. Bard leaves) she can stay in 7J which I believe she is most 
comfortable in. I do think 
prefers a hotel until Monday though. 
The roach issue is a problem. I have talked to Anthony about it. I told him I want the 
exterminator every 2 weeks in all our guest apartments...then Leo must go and check for dead 
roaches so guests don't walk in and get disgusted by dead (or alive) roaches.
