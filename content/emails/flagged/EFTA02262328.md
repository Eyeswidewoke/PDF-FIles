Fed Ex was able to change the zip code on the first package that was sent (Tracking #773677992030)...but the second package is not showing up in Fed Ex's system yet. I am hoping you can change the zip code on your end before shipping. I have made the address correction on your website. The CORRECT ZIP CODE is 10021 (wrong is 06840) So sorry for the inconvenience!

#773677992030)...but the second package is not showing up in Fed Ex's system yet. I am 
hoping you can change the zip code on your end before shipping. I have made the address 
correction on your website. The CORRECT ZIP CODE is 10021 (wrong is 06840)
