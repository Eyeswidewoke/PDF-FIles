| **To** | Lesley Groff Dear- It was a pleasure to meet you in-person. If you would be so kind as to forward our sincere gratitude to Jeffrey for his time and counsel. It was extremely valuable and has already helped us fine-tune our story. Please also let him know that we made contact with Steven Sinofsky yesterday, per his recommendation. Steven said that meeting early stage companies via Skypc is not effective, and therefore suggested an in-person in the Bay Area the next time we go out west (he told us not to make a trip out specifically to meet with him). We will absolutely make note of connecting with him when we next schedule a trip to the Bay Area later in the year. Jeffrey also mentioned an introduction to Joi Ito who I believe is more local and accessible for us in the NYC/Boston area. Wondering if he would be open to making that introduction at this time. Thank you again.

Dear-
It was a pleasure to meet you in-person. 
If you would be so kind as to forward our sincere gratitude to Jeffrey for his time and 
counsel. It was extremely valuable and has already helped us fine-tune our story. 
Please also let him know that we made contact with Steven Sinofsky yesterday, per his 
recommendation. Steven said that meeting early stage companies via Skypc is not 
effective, and therefore suggested an in-person in the Bay Area the next time we 
go out west (he told us not to make a trip out specifically to meet with him). We 
will absolutely make note of connecting with him when we next schedule a trip to 
the Bay Area later in the year. 
Jeffrey also mentioned an introduction to Joi Ito who I believe is more local and accessible 
for us in the NYC/Boston area. Wondering if he would be open to making that 
introduction at this time. 
Thank you again. 
Best regards,
