I spoke with my agent and told her you prefer to leave 
May 23 morning and rent a car from the airport. Then 
you will pick up 
from the hotel and Drive to 
Florence. I have asked Leonardo, the owner of the 
Airbnb, what time you can arrive for your stay May 23. 
Do you know how long the Drive is from Bologna to 
Florence? 2 hours? 3 hours? Or what.
