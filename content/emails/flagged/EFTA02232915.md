Morning. I called and booked the girls flights this morning as I was worried about 
availability and pricing! However the rep I spoke with could not come up with the price you 
were able to get on the hotel! Can you please book the Paridisus this morning for us!!? We 
want to prepay so I'll need to sign a credit card authorization form I think? Please let me 
know! Thanks! (Also we decidelarep the direct flights for 
and the less 
expensive connecting flights for 
). Thanks.
