• Hello 
sorry for the delay, I just landed in Miami, I swapped with Bill 
Hammond, so I have Dave running the rest of the trip, the tentative plan is 
Jeffrey to fly to Nice tomorrow, then Sunday the 31st to the island, then come to 
New York around April 4 or fifth, however somethings have changed and I'm sure 
Jeffrey will update the schedule shortly, this is all I have right now I will 
keep you posted thanks Larry
