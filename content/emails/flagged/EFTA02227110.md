I have 2 bags. The big suitcase is approximately 30 kilos and the hand luggage is 
around 12. So it fits into business class category. 
Yes, just for one night would be perfect, because I don't know when exactly I'll 
get the visa and for sure I'll be able to prolong my stay there for an extra 
night if necessary.
