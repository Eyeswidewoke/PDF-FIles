He sent me the below reply and will stay on top of it. I promise! Lesley, I'm afraid package might not make it tomorrow. It got held up in Denmark and France (security reason), but they will call me back to give me the exact delivery date. As of now it's still at Munich airport. I will give you an update once I hear from them.

Lesley, 
I'm afraid 
package might not make it tomorrow. It got held up in Denmark 
and France (security reason), but they will call me back to give me the exact 
delivery date. As of now it's still at Munich airport. 
I will give you an update once I hear from them. 
Thanks

I would really appreciate if you could arrange that it is received 
when expected. Would be really nice if somebody could take off the first layer of 
packing, so that gift wrapping would be seen and 2 letters that are together with 
the box put on top of the box when giving it to Jeffrey.
