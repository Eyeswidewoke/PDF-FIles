Jeff it's a please to meet. 
A video call (skype, or whatever you prefer) sounds great to me 
too. My assistant Lian can 
help us find a time, it may 
be a week or so given my 
travel schedule.

Hi Jeffrey 
Hi Hadi, 
Hadi made my trip to Seattle such a fantastic experience. He is a 
great athlete, angel 
investor (early investor in 
Facebook, Dropbox, 
Uber), serial entrepreneur 
and a founder of a non-
profit 
organisation, Code.org.
Jeffrey is a very dear friend for 7 years now. He is a brilliant 
financier, investor, 
philanthropist, promotes 
education. 
I am sure you will have a lot to talk about and find exciting 
business opportunities 
together :-) 
Jeffrey proposed to connect by Skype to start with. He will be in
