Hello Martin and hope you had a Merry 
Christmas! We received a Hermes watch and 
band for 
(#22 on the spread 
sheet) but the band is not what she wanted. I 
see I ordered it originally correct (Single tour) 
but somewhere along the line it became a 
Double Tour band...and I did not catch it. So 
sorry. May we return the bordeaux/Rose
