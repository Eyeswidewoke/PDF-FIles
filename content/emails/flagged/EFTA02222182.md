Tha 
you so much fors email, 
I just heard back from 
that she's waiting for the answer from her employer 
if she can leave from Saturday to Monda 
basicall over the weekend). All of the 
previous correspondence between 
Jeffrey's assistant, was private 
so am not sure they understood ea 
if the ticket was requested by 
Jeffrey for Sunday. 
Just to avoid the inconvenience and confusion, I would like to let you know that 
she's aiming to go to the island on Saturday morning and come back Monday 
morning, if that's possible and is still awaiting for the approval. 
Please let me know if that's okay.
