| **Subject** | Peggy's Birthday Gift Hi Peggy wanted me to check in as she would like to know how Jeffrey would like to handle the last portion of her $30k birthday gift. She has a few more apartment renovation bills and was wondering how Jeffrey would like to handle...perhaps through wire transfer? If so, her accountant can send the bank details. Let me know what you guys think! Best, Rebecca Drescher EFTA_R1_00981185 EFTA02230168 |

Hi 
Peggy wanted me to check in as she would like to know how Jeffrey would like to handle the last 
portion of her $30k birthday gift. 
She has a few more apartment renovation bills and was wondering how Jeffrey would like to 
handle...perhaps through wire transfer? If so, her accountant can send the bank details. 
Let me know what you guys think! 
Best, 
Rebecca Drescher
