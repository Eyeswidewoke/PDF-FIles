| **Subject** | Jeffrey Epstein Hello Brittany. Hope you had a nice weekend. Jeffrey has asked I touch base with Dr. Moskowitz, I believe, to get names/numbers of doctors he recommends? I think they have spoken on something but I am a little unclear _would it be possible for you to ask Dr. Moskowitz if they spoke and if I need to make some appointments? Would greatly appreciate it-I just spoke to the front desk at your office and she was not aware of anything... Thank you, Lesley Assistant to Jeffrey Epstein EFTA_R1_00995435 EFTA02235283 |
