| **To** | Lesley Groff Hello Dr. Chen mentioned to me that Mr. Epstein will be referring a VIP patient to him? I will need their contact information so that I can have them scheduled. Also, is the patient International with International insurance or will they be self-pay? If the patient is international then the appointment will need to go through our International Services Department here at Columbia and they will organize everything. Thanks!
