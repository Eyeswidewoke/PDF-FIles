It looks like the single tour watch band is no longer available,

Hello Martin and hope you had a Merry Christmas! We 
received a Hermes 
watch and band for 
(#22 on the spread 
sheet) but the band 
is not what she 
wanted. I see I 
ordered it originally 
correct (Single 
tour) but 
somewhere along 
the line it became a 
Double Tour 
band...and I did not 
catch it. So sorry. 
May we return the 
bordcaux/Rose 
Extreme/rose 
Azalee Swift 
Leather Double 
Tour and get the 
Bordeaux/Rose 
Extreme Rose 
Azalee Swift 
Leather Single 
Tour instead? Do 
you need the watch 
and band returned 
or can we just 
return the band? 
Please let me know how to proceed. 
Sony for the trouble. 
Thanks.
