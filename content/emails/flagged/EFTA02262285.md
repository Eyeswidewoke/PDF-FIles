Good Evening Lesley, 
I've made the reservation for the 2 cats on the flight Nov. 19 Palm Beach/LaGuardia. The cost is 5125 per al
weight is 20 lbs with carrier included and animal must remain in carrier at all times. If the total animal and ca
can cancel the space for them. Jet Blue agent said they are very strict with the weight issue. 
Also there were no extra leg room seats available on any of the Jet Blue flights booked.
