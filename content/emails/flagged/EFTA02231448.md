Actually.... the real story is that I'm meeting with the full hospice team - hospice rules arc 
a maximum of six months of life to qualify for medicare payments for their 
excellent care - qualifications are their responsibility. Mom is now approaching two 
years on hospice and going strong, causing them 'problems'. Their thrilled, of 
course, but can't decide if she has to 'graduate' and loose the excellent care or 
they can continue to try to justify, which we all want, since the care is very good.
