Re: Jeffrey Epstein 
Dear Lesley 
Sorry not to reply you earlier. 
I have talked with several people in Tsinghua , including the Vice President who 
is in charge of development for Tsinghua . We have been talking with a group of 
researchers in Tsinghua who have been working with Harvard physics dept and Johns 
Hopkins university on brain and neuroscience research . We are thinking to form 
a center on the brain with a parallel center on AI , machine learning and data 
analysis . I shall send Jeffrey a prelimery proposal soon . I think it will be 
good time for Jeffery to visit after he receives the proposal . And I can arrange 
him to see important people 
Is this a good plan? 
Best regards 
Yau

If 
Martin is interesting to do something in china , I am sure that I can find 
supporters . I know people high up in the academic world. But it would be 
important to know how much interest does jefferey have and if he makes an effort 
to support a project , what would he like in return?
