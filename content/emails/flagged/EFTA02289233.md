Would 9 am work? I think my 11 am meeting will be about an 
hour (in midtown) so we could 
still do from 12:30 to 1:30 as 
well if that's convenient

Hey 
hanks for getting in touch. 
Pm out
 this weekend, but Monday is great if 
Jeffrey is 
available. I have 
just one meeting 
at 11 am, then 
free the rest of 
the day. Would 
something in 
there work? 
cheers
