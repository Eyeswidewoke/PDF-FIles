| **From** | Leon Black I understand that Prof. Lawrence Krauss is no longer director of The ASU Origins Project, and that this program was recently terminated. As you know, my family foundation provided a $2 Million gift to the ASU Foundation to the Origins Project, to be employed at the discretion of Prof. Krauss to help support his efforts to enhance the mission and goals of The ASU Origins Project. As this program no longer exists, would like to request that all unexpended funds currently held by the ASU Foundation be transferred to another non-profit of my choosing to support goals that coincide with my interests. I am currently considering options and will inform the University within 90 days of my selection. Please inform me who I should deal with in this regard. In the meantime, I would request a freeze on all expenditures associated with my gift to the Foundation. EFTA_R1_01124350 EFTA02290531 |

I understand that Prof. Lawrence Krauss is no longer director of The ASU Origins 
Project, and that this program was recently terminated. As you know, my family 
foundation provided a $2 Million gift to the ASU Foundation to the Origins 
Project, to be employed at the discretion of Prof. Krauss to help support his 
efforts to enhance the mission and goals of The ASU Origins Project. 
As this 
program no longer exists, would like to request that all unexpended funds 
currently held by the ASU Foundation be transferred to another non-profit of my 
choosing to support goals that coincide with my interests. I am currently 
considering options and will inform the University within 90 days of my 
selection. Please inform me who I should deal with in this regard. In the 
meantime, I would request a freeze on all expenditures associated with my gift to 
the Foundation.
