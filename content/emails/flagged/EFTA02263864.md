Hello Francois. I have asked Jeffrey what he would like to do and await his reply. 
To confirm, do I cancel the ticket for Nicolas? (FYI-you can not 
reassign a ticket to someone else. The airlines will not let you. We 
will have to cancel his ticket and then purchase you your own ticket).

Dear Lesley 
We are looking for the best time to 
meet Jeffrey on G.St James Island 
after the hurricane season. 
Fabrice and Nicholas schedule is 
at this time open, except for 
November 1st and 14th. We hope 
that will be compatible 
with Jeffrey's schedule with the 
objective to all meet on the Island 
site and move forward on the 
project. 
Please let us know 
Best Regards,
