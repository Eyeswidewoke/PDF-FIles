Hi Bella, 
Please tell them that there is no BA ticket desk and there was British Airways 
representative. They closed the check in on us 1 hour and a couple of minutes 
before take off. There were about 30 of us still in the line and I was in the front. I 
have now put it on my own card and will have to take it up with British Airways. 
It was unbelievable that there was no one who could help us.
