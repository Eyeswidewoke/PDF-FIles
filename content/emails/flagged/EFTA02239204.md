at the end when Sully requested they add in the 35 seconds to each live simulation attempt (to 
LGA and Teterboro) both models resulting in crashes...geez! the tears were coming down and 
my heart was pounding...I guess my heart was pounding through the entire movie though!! 
....do you need an apartment as well since you will fly in on 3rd ..I don't know where your task 
on March 5th at "SAV for the G550" is...? I guess NOT NY?
