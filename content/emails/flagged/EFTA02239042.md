Dear Lesley, 
I hope this finds you well! 
From the 16th to the 18th of March, I would like to visit a workshop at 
NYU. Would it be possible to use the apartment during 
that time, please? I would probably arrive there in the 
evening of the 16th, and leave either on the morning of 
the 18th or 19th. 
Thank you and bests,
