Regenerative medicine is a rapidly evolving field, and one that forces the medical industry to shift their focus from addressing symptoms of disease to fundamental evolutionary shortfalls. So far, I placed a genetic vector at the National Institute of Medicine in France (that reversed glaucoma in mice using the neuroglobin gene) under formal licence review with a publicly traded pharma group here in the US. And I am collaborating with a lab at the University of Pittsburgh that has reversed cirrhosis/ end stage liver disease in rats using the master transcription gene in hepatocytes. The concept of the latter gene vector is really intriguing in that a master transcription gene completely restored liver function by rebalancing genetic expression and thus proteostasis. While I don't really need an office at this point, I do need access to a conference room from time to time and it would be hugely helpful if I could access the foundation's. If there was some work that I could do for the foundation in exchange, I would be delighted to do that. It would be wonderful to catch up with you as well. all the best, EFTA_R1_01093560 EFTA02278037 <1506365439123blobjpg> <I 506365439123blobjpg><1506365439123blobjpg> EFTA_R1_01093561 EFTA02278038 |

Dear Jeffrey 
I hope you've been well. I wanted to update you on what I've been up to for the last 
two years. I was also hoping to talk with you to see if I might use the 
foundation's Lexington office conference room from time to time for 
my work and what I could provide in exchange for that. I am &ling 
Rich because I'm not sure if you still use this email? 
Since working for your foundation, I continued to publish as a journalist writing 
mostly about genetic vectors (Newsweek, Techonomy etc). I then set 
up an LLC that provides business development for labs that have 
reversed age-driven or degenerative diseases. Most of the therapies 
are genetic vectors, and have to show remarkable results at the mouse 
level and beyond. Regenerative medicine is a rapidly evolving field, 
and one that forces the medical industry to shift their focus from 
addressing symptoms of disease to fundamental evolutionary 
shortfalls. 
So far, I placed a genetic vector at the National Institute of Medicine in France (that 
reversed glaucoma in mice using the neuroglobin gene) under formal 
licence review with a publicly traded pharma group here in the US. 
And I am collaborating with a lab at the University of Pittsburgh that 
has reversed cirrhosis/ end stage liver disease in rats using the master 
transcription gene in hepatocytes. The concept of the latter gene 
vector is really intriguing in that a master transcription gene 
completely restored liver function by rebalancing genetic expression 
and thus proteostasis. 
While I don't really need an office at this point, I do need access to a conference 
room from time to time and it would be hugely helpful if I could 
access the foundation's. If there was some work that I could do for 
the foundation in exchange, I would be delighted to do that. 
It would be wonderful to catch up with you as well. 
all the best,
