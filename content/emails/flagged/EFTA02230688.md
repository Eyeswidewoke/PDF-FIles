Nov. 26th...we will keep your ox personal items at the house (it did not ship yet!) So you will have your things still here..you may stay in the same room you were staying in at the house ...please bring an empty suitcase with you so you can pack up your items and take them with you when you leave—If you would like to go to the PB house and pick up your other cell it is still there..or you can use your own for the week (just let me know what you prefer)...I don't have exact return date yet so I am only purchasing the one way to NY on 26th...

keep your ox personal items at the house (it did not ship yet!) So you will 
have your things still here..you may stay in the same room you were staying in at 
the house ...please bring an empty suitcase with you so you can pack up your items 
and take them with you when you leave—If you would like to go to the PB house and 
pick up your other cell it is still there..or you can use your own for the week 
(just let me know what you prefer)...I don't have exact return date yet so I am 
only purchasing the one way to NY on 26th...
