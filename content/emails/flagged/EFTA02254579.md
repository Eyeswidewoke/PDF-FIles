Les can you look into options that arc on the later side on the 10th, like as close to 
midnight as possible ;) departure and arrival airports not of great concern to me. 
J knows that I am looking into accommodation, but you do what you have to 
regarding letting him know / following up. You can say I told you I am doing it 
and that I would collect options if you need to. I think that it's easier this way 
because I know the transport links to my sister who is just south of the city. So I 
am looking central / south west like Chelsea, South Kensington etc. Close to 
Victoria station which has a direct train to Gatwick and to my sister. 
Thank you so much for your patience and help 000000
