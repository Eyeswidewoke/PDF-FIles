Hi Lesley -
The support team just got back to me with the spreadsheets for 
shipment and they've advised that they no longer ship to the US 
Virgin Islands. So that means those orders will also have to be 
shipped to you and then forwarded to the respective recipients. 
I've attached (2) Spreadsheets with corresponding quotes for your review: 
• United States: Apple Multiship Template HBRK 112818 
United States 
• Europe & US Virgin Islands: Apple Multiship Template 
HBRK 112818 Europe & US Virgin Islands 
EFTA_R1_01064998 
EFTA02263439

o Europe & US Virgin Islands will need to ship to the 
HBRK main office and then be distributed to 
the recipients. 
Quotes: 
• United States: Quote 1 for HBRIC_112118_SSO_CC_US + 
2205191522 B 
• Europe: Quote 1 for HBRK_112118_SSO CC_Europe + 
2205191882 
• US Virgin Islands: Quote 1 for 
HBRK_112118_SSO_CC_USVirgin + 2205191892 
Please review the information to ensure shipping addresses and 
product details arc correct. 
Let me know if you have any questions and we can schedule a time to chat. 
Talk soon!

Hi Lesley -
Attached is the quote for the orders shipping to the US. I haven't 
received the updated spreadsheet from my 
support team yet for you to review to ensure 
shipping addresses are correct. Once I have 
that, I'll forward it over for you to verify the 
information. 
Also, re: Europe. The teams in the UK and France are now telling me 
they no longer accept US credit cards over
