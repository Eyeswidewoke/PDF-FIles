Want to give you 
the heads up: My 
account rep, 
Natasha, is on 
holiday. She 
purchases our rail 
tickets through an 
account she has, 
which no one else 
apparently has 
access to. I booked 
a new 
ticket myself on line 
and received a 
nbrmild)na 
but she must print 
the ticket herself at 
a kiosk at the 
station OR go to 
the window and 
speak with an 
agent. She is to 
take the 7:55am 
train arriving Paris 
11:17am. 
...I worry however 
...I don't know if 
she needs the card 
it was purchased on 
(the website 
doesn't state so, 
but...??) I did 
received an email 
stating it takes 2 
business days for 
the credit card to be 
reviewed and ticket 
finalized (?) Yet it 
accepted the date 
EFTA_R1_01014313 
EFTA02241696

of travel as 
tomorrow. She 
needs to take 
money with her to 
the train station in 
case she needs to 
purchase a new 
ticket or pay a 
change fee. I have 
told her to take 
money and a 
credit card!
