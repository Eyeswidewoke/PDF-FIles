Hi Dada. I am told the circuit breaker box is usually located outside the kitchen 
or in the hallway leading to the bedroom. Maybe you can flip the tripped 
switch for yourself.

Good morning! Hmmm, not sure. They should be working. ..perhaps a 
fuse has tripped. ... can you pick up the phone on the wall near the front 
door ..it will ring the doorman at the desk downstairs. Maybe he can 
send up a maintenance man. I will see if I can reach someone in our staff 
also.
