Hi Lesley -
Sony, I missed this email. 
You likely won't be able to make that purchase with a US credit card. 
In the US for example, they verify your billing address for each form of payment we 
accept and it must be linked to a US billing address in order to 
complete the purchase. 
Did you guys come to any decision on how you'd like to proceed with the 
additional watches? Sony my initial plan of action didn't work out.
