Wanted to give you the heads up and hoping you may be able to help 
with travel during this time if Jeffrey needs it. He is heading to Paris 
on July 19 and staying until the 27th...he always has people flying in 
and out of Paris and sometimes with lots of changes (which I'm sure 
you both know)...— will be in Paris but she does not have
