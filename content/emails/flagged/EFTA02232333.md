Dear Jeffrey, 
The scope does include digitalization of the entire islands 
(planonetrics) to reflect the general topography, existing roads, trees 
and structures. This will be delivered in the form of stamped and 
sealed survey drawings which will be required for any administrative 
process and a digital 3D model that we will create so we can play with 
it in the design stage. 
It also includes to digitalize all the existing buildings to reflect the 
current interior layouts and exterior general elevations so we can 
determine what can be used from the existing constructions. 
Additionally, we will create a professional video of the two islands to 
have precise aerial views and will take professional photos of all the 
panoramic views from each one of the possible sites for new buildings. 
This will also be needed in the future in order to produce the photo-
realistic renderings in the design stage. 
Everything will be delivered to you digitally and all this basic info will 
be needed later on when we agree to start the master plan design 
proposal.
