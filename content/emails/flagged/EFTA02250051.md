the only website I can find that has tickets is Viagogo and they do not 
give you the exact number for your 
scat...Only that it is Section I, 2 or 3...do 
you know of any other websites that sell the 
tickets and I will look.

a emit : 
I found a ticket in section 1...but it does not state exactly 
where it is 
unfortunately. 
Section I is the 
longer side of the 
stadium (not the 
goal/end sides) I 
hope you are 
sleeping by now! 
But let me know if 
I should buy this 
ticket..
