Jeffrey, 
I'm just back from NYC. Wanted to pass along a large Permian deal we're involved in. This will be a very 
near term opportunity. So thought it maybe of interest. 
See attached info. We are forming what will become the next Reliance Energy. Most of Reliance was sold to 
CXO late in 2016 for $1.68. 
We will use the company's remaining 40k acreage and add them to a newco with the addition of the 
Riverstone assetf3Rock). So in total we will have 100k of acreage w 5O00boe of production and midstream 
operations. 
There is also an option to increase the acreage to 137k by Fall. 
Total deal metrics are $1.7-1.98. With the Riverstone deal alone around $1.3-1.5B. 
We plan to add cash and use men debt. So today only in need of appx $400-600mm of equity. 
The plan would be to have this as a private newco with a path towards an !PO within a year. We see a 3X 
opp here. Similar to Reliance's past deals. 
Josh Fink(Larry's son) and I are leading the new group re financing and strategy. Gary McKinney and his 
team will be running to show. Gary will be investing $100mm into the co. 
Please keep in confidence. Would be great to have you involved and continue to reflect what opportunities 
Livermore sources, structures, and invests in.
