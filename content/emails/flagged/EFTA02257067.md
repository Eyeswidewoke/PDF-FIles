| **Subject** | September 6th -Soundwaters Cruise All, I had previously sent a "Save the Date" for September 6". We are now finalizing the plan for the "Sunset Cruise" from Stamford. I wanted to circle back with more details and to best determine of final count in order to plan accordingly. We will be leaving from Stamford as close to 5:30pm as possible. The Soundwaters team has informed me that the sun sets at 7:20pm that evening and it will be dark (difficult to sail) shortly after that. They know it will be difficult for us all to get there by 5:30pm, but they advised leaving as soon after that time as possible. I have told them we will do our best. We will be back to the dock around 7:30pm. We will have some food and beverages on the boat. The boat can accommodate up to 40 people. There are about 26 of us. With all spouses, we would be 51 so I think there is a chance to work it all out...I just need to know from TOUR can come ASAP. EFTA_R1_01050550 EFTA02257071 Please let me know....

All, 
I had previously sent a "Save the Date" for September 6". 
We are now finalizing the plan for the "Sunset Cruise" from 
Stamford. 
I wanted to circle back with more details and to best determine of 
final count in order to plan accordingly. 
We will be leaving from Stamford as close to 5:30pm as possible. 
The Soundwaters team has informed me that the sun sets at 
7:20pm that evening and it will be dark (difficult to sail) 
shortly after that. 
They know it will be difficult for us all to get there by 5:30pm, but 
they advised leaving as soon after that time as possible. 
I have told them we will do our best. 
We will be back to the dock around 7:30pm. 
We will have some food and beverages on the boat. 
The boat can accommodate up to 40 people. 
There are about 26 of us. 
With all spouses, we would be 51 so I think there is a chance to 
work it all out...I just need to know from TOUR can 
come ASAP.
