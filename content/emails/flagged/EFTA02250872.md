receive emails...it was Bebe...maybe it will be Daphne? not sure-as date approaches, 
I will ask him...

Wanted to give you the heads up and hoping you may be able to help with travel 
during this time if Jeffrey needs it. He is heading to Paris on July 19 and 
staying until the 27th—he always has people flying in and out of Paris and 
sometimes with lots of changes (which I'm sure you both know)_A 
will be in 
Paris but she does not have authorization to purchase tickets...I am hoping we will 
coordinate all the travel prior to his departure but...one never knows_I will 
remind him again that I am leaving and hope this will encourage him to get people 
organized. I'm sorry to have to ask but you two are the only ones who are 
authorized..
