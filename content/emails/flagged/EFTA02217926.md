Dear Lesley, 
Enclosed you'll find the confirmation letter for 
room 
booking at the Rixos Premium Belek Hotel in Antalya. 
The boarding is on all inclusive system, meaning that almost every food 
and beverage consumption is included in the rate. There are always extra 
service with payment such as laundry, spa, hairdressers, some a la carte
