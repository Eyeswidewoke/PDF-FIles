HiIn 
I am told the circuit breaker box is usually located outside the kitchen or in the 
hallway leading to the bedroom. Maybe you can flip the tripped switch for yourself.

Good morning! Hmmm. not sure. They should be working. _perhaps a fuse has tripped. 
can you pick up the phone on the wall near the front door ..it will ring the doorman at 
the desk downstairs. Maybe he can send up a maintenance man. I will see if I can reach 
someone in our staff also.
