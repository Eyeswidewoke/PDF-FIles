Good day, Mr. Jeffers, 
We have plenty of material here for you to begin on the 
Flagpole Pool Road. This is the owner's first priority. 
We look forward to you beginning this project on 
Tuesday, May 28. 
The owner's second priority is the road going toward the gym all the way up 
to the Sun Dial.

Good Day, 
Mr Epstein chose a color sample labeled #3 for the 
flag road. That sample will use about 21 pounds of 
color per cubic yard of concrete with gray cement. Mr. 
Epstein also mentioned doing two roads in that area, 
one being the "Beach Road". I need assistance and 
confirmation in identifying that road. I also need 
verification as to whether this is an added amount to 
the sample roads or if we will do this one in lieu of the
