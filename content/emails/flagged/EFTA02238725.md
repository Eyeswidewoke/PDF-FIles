There is a severe problem - there is a crack in the bedroom ceiling and I think that water have poured to the bed. The covers and the mattress are wet. Unless there is a possibility to change them, it is not possible to sleep upon. I don't know how Leo didn't see it because the water are brownish. I entered the room and immediately noticed it. It seems that it happened sometime between we left and now because the ceiling is not wet but you see the crack. Can you help today, Sunday? Thanks, Nili EFTA_R1_01005950 EFTA02238725 |

Hi lesley, 
Thank you for there welcome goodies. 
There is a severe problem - there is a crack in the bedroom ceiling and I think 
that water have poured to the bed. The covers and the 
mattress are wet. 
Unless there is a possibility to change them, it is not possible to sleep upon. 
I don't know how Leo didn't see it because the water are brownish. I entered 
the room and immediately noticed it. It seems that it 
happened sometime between we left and now because the 
ceiling is not wet but you see the crack. 
Can you help today, Sunday? 
Thanks, 
Nili
