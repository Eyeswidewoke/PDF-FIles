I just went through all of the rent payments you gave us and here is what I have 
based on the deposits for the year. Based on this I think we are still short one 
month rent. Can you check your outgoing checks to see if you concur with this. it 
gets confusing because of the delay in check but I think I have this correct. I think 
that the check you gave us in February of 2018 was actually for November of 
2017. 
For 2017 you can see all the checks given by date they are cashed. 
Based on this I think we are missing Feb of 2018 at $4750. I understand all the 
confusion so do not worry about the late or let me know if my numbers are wrong 
Also we have a check from back in October for $1000 that we never cashed. I 
think I told Lesley not to cash it because you asked us to hold up. You latter paid 
October in full so I think this check should not be cashed or if it is then Feb check 
should only be for $3750. 
For now we will deposit all but the $1000 check, and wait for you to let us know 
what you think
