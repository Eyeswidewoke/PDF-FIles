Hello 
The heat in your 
apartment is working well. There was a 
repair yesterday done on the heating 
system. The air conditioners where also 
winterized. The apartment is warm , 
Tomorrow a new dishwasher is being 
delivered and installed. We will also look 
at the ceiling and repairing that. 
Let me know if you need anything else. 
Thank you Andrew.

Hi Lesley, thanks again for 
your help! 
Hi Andrew and Anthony, 
Thank you very much for 
your coordination in 
addressing the heating issue. 
Could you please kindly update us from yesterday what exactly is 
the issue with the heating 
system in my apartment? 
As of this morning, it still barely works. Cesar was at my 
apartment on Sunday and 
said that there is a need for 
additional lattice installation 
to let the heat to come 
through, is that correct?
