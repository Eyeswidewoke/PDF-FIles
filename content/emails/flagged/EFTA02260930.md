I am checkingBut I am not sure that you can fly from Chicago to St. Thomas and 
back in one day I would think he needs at least five hours on the islands?! Or 
more? I am getting information on an early departure from Chicago to Saint 
Thomas on Thursday and early departure back to Chicago Friday morning if a 
direct round-trip on Thursday does not exist
