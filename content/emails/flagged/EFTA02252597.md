Hello Leslie ! I believeJeffrey is half way thru his last 
package. I see 
Jeffrey has been in 
more frequently 
lately and was 
wondering if he 
would be interested 
in purchasing a new 
52 pack and we will 
give him the $2000 
Birthday present for 
Melanie as a gift. 
The packages don't 
expire and we can 
also message over 
the gift card to 
Meanie with some 
products. If so , 
should we use the 
CC# we have on 
file. BIG HUG!!! 
ENJOY YOUR 
VACATION....
