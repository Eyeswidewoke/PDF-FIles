Good morning Camilla...might you be able to forward me the information for Terje's flight...I'd 
like to see if I am able to upgrade him...I am not sure since I did not make the reservations...if 
not, perhaps you can upgrade for Terje, and forward us the invoice...then we can wire the money. 
I need to see the reservation before we can determine. Might you be able to help? Lesley
