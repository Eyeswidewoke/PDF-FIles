Dear Lesley 
This is a more solid version where I have made the side glazed panels solid and these can 
contain solid shutters and these solid shutters will slide across the remaining glass 
in event of a hurricane. The concept is now 20% of the glazing is now solid and 
these will house shutters which will slide across for security. 
Please can you show this to Jeffrey to see if he is happier with this approach before we 
spend time to colour up the drawing.
