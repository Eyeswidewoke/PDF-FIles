Hi Andrew and Anthony, 
Thank you very much for 
your coordination in 
addressing the 
heating issue. 
Could you please kindly update us from yesterday what exactly is 
the issue with the heating 
system in my apartment? 
As of this morning, it still barely works. Cesar was at my 
apartment on Sunday and 
said that there is a need for 
additional lattice installation 
to let the heat to come 
through, is that correct?
