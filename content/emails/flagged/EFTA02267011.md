Just a question, about flight back is confirmed that it's gonna be on 7th? If yes, will I be able to upgrade a class from Miami to Paris? About Kaliningrad, sure, I just check if they have same date and same airport Aeroflot su 1006 January 8th And return Su 1001 January llth May be we can just change those ones that we had on 3-7th? Or it's easier to book a new one? Should I send confirmation number you sent me before? 1est On Mon, 31 Dec 2018 at 17:14, Lesley Groff ‹ > wrote: Please give me the dates you would like to travel to Kaliningrad so I can re-organize that ticket for you.

Hi, Lesley! 
Regarding to my trip to the states, that's of course all correct and delta works perfect too. Thank 
you! 
Just a question, about flight back is confirmed that it's gonna be on 7th? 
If yes, will I be able to upgrade a class from Miami to Paris? 
About Kaliningrad, sure, I just check if they have same date and same airport 
Aeroflot su 1006 January 8th 
And return Su 1001 January llth 
May be we can just change those ones that we had on 3-7th? Or it's easier to book a new one? 
Should I send confirmation number you sent me before?
