Could you please confirm what exactly Jeffrey needs so I can best direct the conversation? Is it just company structure and bank account details? ..or other information too - i.e. company information and/or strategic advice from our international tax lawyers, etc. If you could send through his list that would be great and we'll get it sorted easily!

Matt & Jeffrey touched base yesterday after all. 
Matt only had 60 second to fill me in between sessions at the supernatural gathering.. but from 
what I understand Jeffrey is interested in funding some of our current or potential future 
projects, and he wanted to know the best way to go about this. Could you please confirm 
what exactly Jeffrey needs so I can best direct the conversation? Is it just company structure 
and bank account details? ..or other information too - i.e. company information and/or 
strategic advice from our international tax lawyers, etc.

Thanks for everything Lesley, you're amazing!
