| **To** | Lesley Groff Dear Leslie, I will certainly bring with me the general idea for the master plan concept but I feel it will be best that I personally walk Jeffrey through it during our meeting instead of sending it in advance. Please let me know if this is acceptable to him and I would appreciate if you can confirm our meeting on Friday Feb 2nd. As I mentioned Jeffrey, I could also meet Thursday evening if it is more convenient for him. I will land in NY at 4:00pm. Kind regards, Ramon Alonso On Jan 19, 2018, at 7:58 PM, Lesley Gro otc: Hello Ramon. Hope you are well. Jeffrey is requesting you please send him the master plan with all the items he wishes you to incorporate so he can digest it prior to meeting with you beginning of Feb.

Dear Leslie, I will certainly bring with me the general idea for the master plan concept but 
I feel it will be best that I personally walk Jeffrey through it during our meeting 
instead of sending it in advance. 
Please let me know if this is acceptable to him and I would appreciate if you can confirm 
our meeting on Friday Feb 2nd. 
As I mentioned Jeffrey, I could also meet Thursday evening if it is more convenient for 
him. I will land in NY at 4:00pm. 
Kind regards,
