The only problem, that there should not be any reference to Jeffrey's name. 
Because I will have an internship at this hotel through 
Jeffrey's networking and it was his request. 
Right now in London both of our rooms with 
are under Mr. Jeffrey

should not happen at Andaz... Let me know please if it
