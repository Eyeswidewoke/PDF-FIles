| **Subject** | It's Beck & I'm hoping you can sponsor me! Hey everyone! I wish I was able to get to you all in person to ask this, but.... I am asking for your support as my family & I ski & snowboard for 24 hours March 16-17 to help raise money for underprivileged children though the Stratton Community Foundation. Each member of our team has a goal to raise $300. by March 15th. I'm hoping we far surpass that number with your help! The money we raise will help less fortunate children gain access to basic needs like food on the table, warm clothes, medical care & much more that we often take for granted. More details are on our website. ANY amount is appreciated!! Even $10. will help. (That's what some of us easily spend at McKenzies on candy after school or on a fancy Starbucks coffee!) :) AND it's TAX DEDUCTIBLE!!
