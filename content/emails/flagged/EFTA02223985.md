Subject Re: 
oh yes! OK...I knew I had spelled your name incorrectly (it auto corrected from my cell phone 
...I did this while on the train...) I emailed our contact immediately and let her know it went 
through misspelled! I thought you had completely changed your last name (which, yes, that could 
have been a problem) ;) I can re register you again from my computer...maybe that is best and I 
will spell the last name correctly!
