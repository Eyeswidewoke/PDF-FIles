Hi Les, 
I was wondering if 
could stop by 3m tomorrow or on Thursday 
to change the bedsheets and bring clean towels. The apt is pretty 
clean, I will have some personal things out as I will be coming back 
to stay here on Thursday night with my family. 
I think we are fine with the matrass bed as well! If she could install it before 
Thursday night and also bring an additional blanket for the bedroom 
that would be great! Thank you!
