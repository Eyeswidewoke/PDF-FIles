I didn't know he will be away for so long... would you mind to write to me from time to time that everything is okay? Or if I ask you at least once a month is he is all good? Or would you prefer if I just wait? I just hope he doesn't travel in strange or dangerous countries... Have a wonderful day Lesley, hope you are doing all good and happy <3 I tired to get a green card to USA but they didn't give me :( maybe next year.

Thank you Lesley, I really appreciate your understanding. I didn't know he will 
be away for so long... would you mind to write to me from time to time that 
everything is okay? Or if I ask you at least once a month is he is all good? Or 
would you prefer if I just wait? 
I just hope he doesn't travel in strange or dangerous countries... 
Have a wonderful day Lesley, hope you are doing all good and happy <3 I tired to 
get a green card to USA but they didn't give me :( maybe next year. 
Cheers,
