It's not the easiest place to get to since only one of the two cable cars are currently running. Please let me know which you prefer?

You're right about things being a bit chaotic. There are boxes everywhere despite 
adopting a Marie Kondo approach to my things prior to the move! Monday would

Hi 
just checking in...Hope your move went as well as can be yesterday. 
When would be good for us to deliver your gift cards to you?! Just let me 
know...next week perhaps? Once a little more settled?

Hi Lesley, 
I am moving into my new apartment on March 14. Is it 
possible to hold on to the gift card until then? 
Otherwise I will be teaching on Friday at P.S. 217 on 
Roosevelt Island. It's not the easiest place to get to 
since only one of the two cable cars are currently 
running. Please let me know which you prefer? 
Kind regards,
