Hi Lesley, 
I want to visit Washington for four days of my vacation from 20th to 23rd and we 
prefer to travel by train. Therefore, I would like to request you for 
the train ticket and hotel booking for us. We are three adults and one 
kid (4yrs old). We want to travel on 20th to Washington and leave 
on 23rd to NY. 
Thank you so much
