Re: I am purchasing Airline tickets for myself on JE's account 
No joke! I'm sure that doesn't happen. But when you look at the statement does 
it show who the ticket is for? Is the last name given? I plan to tell him about 
my trip tomorrow morning but didn't want between now and then to be an issue.

Bella, when Jeffrey looks at his amex cc statement will he see that I have 
purchased tickets in my name? Does that show up on the statement? I wasn't 
going to say anything but I don't want him to think I am purchasing tickets with 
his money and not paying him back! but if names aren't attached then I don't 
need to mention?
