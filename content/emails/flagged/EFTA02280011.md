Hi Lesley, 
You're right about things being a bit 
chaotic. There are boxes everywhere 
despite adopting a Marie Kondo approach 
to my things prior to the move! Monday 
would be better as I hope to be more 
organized by then. 
Enjoy the weekend,

Hi 
We can certainly 
hold on to them until you 
move! Or we could Fed Ex 
to your current address? But 
maybe best to wait if things 
are crazy with the move!? 
Just let me know what is 
best. Lesley
