| **To** | Wendell Burnette Architects Hello Thomas and thank you for getting back to me yesterday. Jeffrey, as I thought, would like architectural plans for both his island Little St. James and Great St. James...they both need to be re-done completely ...and the timing is now. I would say this is a very large project. Considering you are already swamped, I am thinking this may not be a project you could take on with good conscience (?) I do believe it would be quite time consuming...it is also the caribbean which would mean trips to/from every so often... ...but please don't let me discourage you... Please advise from here... Jeffrey will be in NY and available to speak with if you would like to set a call. Thank you, Lesley Assistant to Jeffrey Epstein EFTA_R1_00971201 EFTA02226780 |

Hello Thomas and thank you for getting back to me yesterday. Jeffrey, as I thought, 
would like architectural plans for both his island Little St. James and Great St. 
James...they both need to be re-done completely ...and the timing is now. I 
would say this is a very large project. Considering you are already swamped, I am 
thinking this may not be a project you could take on with good conscience (?) I 
do believe it would be quite time consuming...it is also the caribbean which would 
mean trips to/from every so often... 
...but please don't let me discourage you... 
Please advise from here... 
Jeffrey will be in NY and available to speak with if you would like to set a call. 
Thank you,
