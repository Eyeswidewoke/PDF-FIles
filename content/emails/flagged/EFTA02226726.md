Too much thinking about hair** 
Husband - Ozzy Osborne - Brice - another hair thing - one lacking, one not 
But will take Sharon Osborne as a good compliment-no messing around with that girl, would like 
to look as pretty* 
Funny, has been mentioned before and for some reason Susan Sarandon - something about the 
eyes everyone says, unable to see that - more like we have the same shoe size* 
Have a great weekend 
All the best
