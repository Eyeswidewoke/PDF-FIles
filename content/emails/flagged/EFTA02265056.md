Hello Francois. I have asked Jeffrey what he would like to do and 
await his reply. To confirm, do I cancel the ticket for Nicolas? (FYI-
you can not reassign a ticket to someone else. The airlines will not let 
you. We will have to cancel his ticket and then purchase you your 
own ticket).

site and move forward on the 
project.
