Hi Jeffrey, 
Mr. Gabriel and his crew have been working on sanding all the wood in the office 
every weekend for the past four weeks. The sanding process has 
created a very fine, flour-like dust which has coated everything despite 
our attempts to close doors and cover items. It is not possible for us to 
work while they do the sanding hence having them work only on 
weekends. They have two more weekends to go before they finish. I 
have asked them about coming this Friday, Saturday and Sunday and 
knocking it out so that I can have the rug and AC vents cleaned next 
week. I want to get them out of here ASAP since some of us are having 
respiratory issues. They can come those three days but it means closing 
the office on Friday. Is that okay with you? 
With warm regards,
