Hello Mr. Roberts and Shay. 
Following up to see if you have 
heard back from Global Marine 
re when you can use their barge 
to transport sand and the large 
mixer you need on GSJ to 
complete the cottage. Please 
let us know as this is holding 
up the completion date of the 
cottage. Jeffrey has suggested 
you use 'Mike's barge'. 
Would this help? 
Daphne, any better idea on when our barge will be back? Last I 
heard it was first week of June 
which is next week.
