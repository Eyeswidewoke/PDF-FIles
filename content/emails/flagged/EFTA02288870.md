Dear Lesley 
Sony not to reply you earlier. 
I have talked with several people in Tsinghua , including the Vice President who is in 
charge of development for Tsinghua . We have been talking with a group of 
researchers in Tsinghua who have been working with Harvard physics dept and 
Johns Hopkins university on brain and neuroscience research . We are thinking to 
form a center on the brain with a parallel center on Al , machine learning and data 
analysis . I shall send Jeffrey a prelimery proposal soon . I think it will be good 
time for Jeffery to visit after he receives the proposal . And I can arrange him to 
see important people . 
Is this a good plan? 
Best regards 
Yau

Dear Martin and Lesley 
Thanks a lot for Martin `s introduction! 
I shall be in Beijing this Saturday.i shall talk with relevant people

something in china , I am sure 
that I can find supporters . I 
know people high up in the 
academic world. But it would be 
important to know how much 
interest does jefferey have and if
