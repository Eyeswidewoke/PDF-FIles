Hi. 
Yesterday morning he called to yet again to 
reschedule for Thursday or Friday. Once he 
starts hanging the gates the work will take 
two to three days. 
Tomorrow the second beach well for the 
desal unit on GSJ will be going in along 
with the brine outflow well. That work will 
be two to three days.
