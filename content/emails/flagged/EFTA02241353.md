Want to give you the heads up: My account rep, Natasha, is on holiday. She purchases our rail 
tickets through an account she has, which no one else apparently has access to. I booked 
a new ticket myself on line and received a booking number
 but she must 
print the ticket herself at a kiosk at the station OR go to the window and speak with an agent. 
She is to take the 7:55am train arriving Paris 11:17am. 
...I worry however ...I don't know if she needs the card it was purchased on (the website doesn't 
state so, but...??) I did receive an email stating it takes 2 business days for the credit card to 
reviewed and ticket finalized (?) Yet it accepted the date of travel as tomorrow. She needs to 
take money with her to the train station
