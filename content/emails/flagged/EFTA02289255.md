Following up to see if you have heard back from Global Marine re when you can use their barge to transport sand and the large mixer you need on GSJ to complete the cottage. Please let us know as this is holding up the completion date of the cottage. Jeffrey has suggested you use `Mike's barge'. Would this help? Daphne, any better idea on when our barge will be back? Last I heard it was first week of June which is next week. We have a conference call today at 4:45pm and Jeffrey will be asking for a completion date. Thank you and look forward to hearing back.
