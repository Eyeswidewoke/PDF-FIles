Dear-
Thank you so much for your email, 
I just heard back from 
that she's waiting for the answer from her employer if she can 
leave from Saturday to mg (baMover the weekend). All of the previous 
correspondence between 
and 
Jeffrey's assistant, was private so am 
not sure they understood each other correctly if the ticket was requested by Jeffrey 
for Sunday. 
Just to avoid the inconvenience and confusion, I would like to let you know that she's 
aiming to go to the island on Saturday morning and come back Monday morning, 
if that's possible and is still awaiting for the approval. 
Please let me know if that's okay.

like me to purchase her a ticket to the island for this Sunday Aug. 27th.
