Daphne and Anna from the island will work on getting you the items requested. Excellent to know you should have something to present by Oct. 31. Jeffrey would be very happy to meet you at his home in NY...at the moment, I am not positive when he will be here, but should be first or second week of November. I will circle back to you as the date approaches so we can set a meeting. We will be in touch! Lesley On Oct 19, 2018, at 10:06 AM, JAGO art wrote: Good morning Lesley!
