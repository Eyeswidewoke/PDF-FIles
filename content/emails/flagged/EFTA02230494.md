» Hello Nili-wanted you to know we are having a bit of a difficulty with Kobi...he 
says he doesn't know our staff and won't disarm the alarm for us...we provided the 
previous guy all the passports/ID's/Drivers License for each of the employees who 
might need to enter your apartment...Kobi should have on file (I hope)... 
» Might you be able to have conversation with him?

>> I wanted to send In 
to leave a little food and flowers like 
we always do, but she was told she must wait 2 more hours to possibly get entry..
