I am checkingBut I am not sure that you can fly from Chicago to St. Thomas and back in one day 
I would think he needs at least five hours on the islands?! Or more? I am getting information on 
an early departure from Chicago to Saint Thomas on Thursday and early departure back to 
Chicago Friday morning if a direct round-trip on Thursday does not exist
