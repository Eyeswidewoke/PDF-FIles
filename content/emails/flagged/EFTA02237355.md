Aspen the town — or Snowmass? Snowmass is the major 
'Aspen ski resort' — Aspen is the town. Snowmass is about 20 
minutes away on convenient shuttle. With more ski in and 
out options. Most stay at Snowmass, then go to Aspen for 
shopping and dining. The ski hill in Aspen is smaller and 
steeper. If they are expert to intermediate skiers and are 
familiar with this type of terrain, then Aspen might be 
perfect. Otherwise I might recommend Snowmass. 
Lift ticket passes work for both Aspen, Snowmass and the two 
smaller hills in-between called Highlands and Buttermilk. But 
Snowmass is by far the larger ski area base with three village 
levels of shopping and dining. 
Rentals can be picked up at a conveniently located shop or 
delivered at the lodge. Skiers or snowboarders? Helmets or 
no helmets?
