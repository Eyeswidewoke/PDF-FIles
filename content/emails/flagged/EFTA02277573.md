Please let me know which you prefer? Kind regards, Kathy On Wed, Feb 27, 2019 at 11.57 Lesley Groff ‹ > wrote: Hello Kathy and hope you are well.

Hi Lesley, 
I am moving into my new apartment on March 14. Is it possible to hold on to the gift card until 
then? Otherwise I will be teaching on Friday at P.S. 217 on Roosevelt Island. It's not the easiest 
place to get to since only one of the two cable cars are currently running. Please let me know 
which you prefer? 
Kind regards, 
Kathy
