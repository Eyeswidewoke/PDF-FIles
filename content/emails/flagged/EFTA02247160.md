I am securing 2 tickets to the Uffizi gallery for you. These tickets cannot be cancelled. You will 
need to pay in cash on arrival to the Good Tastes of Tuscany for the tickets. Please be sure 
to take plenty of cash with you!

Hi Lesley:) 
I think yes, I would love to visit Uffizi gallery if its possible. I heard that better to buy 
tickets in advance, so if the school has connections and can do it, it would be 
wonderful! 
Looking forward to 
answer about it. 
Thank you Lesley!!!
