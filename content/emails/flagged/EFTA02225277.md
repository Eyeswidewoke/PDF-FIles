I would rather just hire a car from Geneva. 
Much easier and safer option, considering the 
fact that I'll have a lot of luggage.

Hi 
..Have you ever taken this 
trip from Paris to Glion? Apparently 
we can only purchase you a ticket from 
Paris to Geneva then from Geneva to 
Montreux. From there, the train line 
from Montreux to Glion is a regional 
train and you can only purchase your 
ticket locally at the station. The trains 
from Montreux to Glion only depart in 
the morning...the latest train is 9:3Iam. 
Jeffrey had asked you depart around 
3pm on Oct. 14th. We were going to
