Hi Lesley. Good to see you yesterday. I wasted - uh I mean I spent an hour and 
a half with Jeff! 
In Germany in the 1920's there was a modernist architecture and design group 
called the Bauhaus movement. This was the beginning of modernism as we know it 
now. The leaders of the movement, all feared hitler and naziism, which tries to 
stamp out the movement as being radical and anti German. So, In 1929 several fled 
to the US. Harvard took in i think around 8 of these bauhaus architects as 
professors. 
There was much interest and excitement about their work and they started to get 
commissions to design homes near Cambridge. 
New Canaan become their 
"laboratory" due to a few early commissions from residents eager to build a new 
modern home. 
Then in the SO's an American architect, Phillip Johnson designed a 
glass house for his residence. This house is iconic for its 100% glass. Also 
very innovative and ground breaking. Google Phillip Johnson glass house. Some of 
the moderns of new Canaan haven't been kept up but many are still amazing. The 
design movement coined it international modernism and is known for the flat roofs 
and horizontal orientation. These architects also designed many iconic modern 
furniture pieces. 
Some of the architects were: walter Gropius, marcel Bruer, 
and others from the bauhaus school.
