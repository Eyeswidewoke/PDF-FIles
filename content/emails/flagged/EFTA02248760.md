today. Im happy to review his MRI beforehand and if he wishes, he can send any relevant medical 
records directly to my residence to maintain confidentiality if he so pleases. Otherwise, as part of 
his evaluation I would need to review these records during our visit. if its difficult to coordinate 
our respective travel schedules( i am traveling all of July as well) we can do a Sypc as well.
