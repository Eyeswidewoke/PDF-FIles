But all his traveling assistants did complete the CPR/AED training. 
We hired a certified CPR/AED instructor to come to Jeffrey's home

Thank you for the swimming suit suggestion and suggestion for 
the work. :) would like to 
become as good as you are at

Do you have something from the EU that you really like?

Hi 
Congratulations on 
your life changes! 
Hope you enjoy 
Hungary and the 
new jobs... 
Were you a paramedic before you moved or is this a new 
career path you are 
interested in? My 
only suggestion is 
to check some on 
line courses where 
you arc? I found 
the below website 
which looks good 
for the US... 
http://www.nmetc.comionline-paramedic-programs.php 
I see with the above on line course you are required to 
have 2 internships 
with a certain 
amount of hours 
you must 
accomplish...it says 
you can complete 
these internships 
near your home (if 
you were in the 
states) or you 
EFTA_R1_01013242 
EFTA02241268

would have to 
travel to 
Massachusettes to 
complete their 
clinical & field 
rotations. I'm sure 
the interent must 
have some good 
web sites in 
Hungary. (?) I 
wish I could help 
you more, but I 
actually do not 
know of anyone 
who has taken a 
paramedics course. 
The Internet is a 
great resource 
...see what you can 
find! 
I just found the below for International EMS training...and 
it states it has 
accreditation from 
University of Pecs, 
Hungary! maybe 
check this out? 
http://www.ppa-int.com/ 
On to swim suits! I think simple is always good...the ones 
with lots of 
embellishments are 
not needed in my 
opinion. classic 
triangle top and 
scoop bottom or 
side string bottom 
always are a good 
call on any figure. 
!!! (at least that is 
what I think :)
