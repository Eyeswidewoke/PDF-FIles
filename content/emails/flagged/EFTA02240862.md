Hi Lesley, 
As you may already know, Harvard typically doesn't conduct tours on Sundays, but 
they've sent out a special request to the student tour guides and just need to 
wait for responses. I was told that we could probably expect a reply before 5pm 
today, so I will be in touch as soon as I hear anything! 
All the best,
