Hi—
I see JE copied me on the Bannon trip„ 
He is going to STT on Saturday? 
JE said he would fly Sunday from STT to NY on Sunday, do you 
think sunday to NY is a go? 
The reason I asked, 
i am using Darren and Chip as Pilots on Sunday, Darren returns 
to St Thomas on Saturday 
afternoon. Chip is on St Thomas 
now. 
I'm just trying to figure out if all is covered, Darren is the only 
one that can fly the helicopter as 
well as me, 
Jeffrey sent me home yesterday to get some home time, I'm just 
trying to make sure all is 
covered? 
Thx
