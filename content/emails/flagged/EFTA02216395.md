| **Subject** | Elton's Dinner in London EFTA_R1_00945537 EFTA02216404 Dear Rachael, We just had the best time working with you, Paul, YouTube, and everyone else involved in Elton's lunch. We thought the whole day accomplished exactly what you wanted, which is to put Elton's YouTube videos on the global entertainment radar. I'm coming to London the end of June, and there's a possibility I will be there when Elton has his annual summer party. Is it possible for me to get a ticket and come if I'm in town? Looking forward to seeing you again. xoxo, Peggy Siegal <2017 06 22 WGD EJAF - EFTA_R1_00945538 EFTA02216405 Ticket Request Fonn.pdf5 <2017 06 22 WGD EJAF - Ticket Request Form (1).pdf> EFTA_R1_00945539 EFTA02216406 |

Dear Rachael, 
We just had the best 
time working with 
you, Paul, YouTube, 
and everyone else 
involved in Elton's 
lunch. 
We thought the 
whole day 
accomplished exactly 
what you wanted, 
which is to put 
Elton's YouTube 
videos on the global 
entertainment radar. 
I'm coming to 
London the end of 
June, and there's a 
possibility I will be 
there when Elton has 
his annual summer 
party. 
Is it possible for me 
to get a ticket and 
come if I'm in town? 
Looking forward to 
seeing you again. 
xoxo, 
Peggy Siegal
