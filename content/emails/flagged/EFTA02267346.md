Bella has confirmed it is OK for you to use your AMEX card to pay for your and your families rooms while in Minsk. It will just be easier as the hotel likes to see the credit card when you check-in. This will keep us from having to fill out a third-party credit card authorization form that could possibly get denied at the last minute. Bella will make sure to have the money available on your card. Ok!? Lesley Sent from my iPhone EFTA_R1_01071514 EFTA02267346 |
