HI Lesley, 
Yes we can arrange for the transfer from Firenze to the 
estate and back 
into Florence , 
the contact will 
always be 
Meaghan and 
then she knows 
which driver 
will be 
assigned the 
service and can 
call them as 
the company 
has many 
different 
drivers and do 
not assign until 
last minute , 
day prior
