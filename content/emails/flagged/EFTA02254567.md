Hello Telecharge Authorization. 
I purchase lots of tickets for my boss as gifts and for some reason our account with you has been 
blocked...something to do with my email address and too many passwords perhaps? (yes, I have 
forgotten a time or 5!) I try to purchase tickets on your site...all appears to be fine...then in the 
end, I receive a message stating there is something wrong with our account and to call your 
customer service number. A lot of times I am in a hurry purchasing tickets for a show that starts 
in 4 hours and I don't have time to waste. Honestly, last night I was purchasing tickets for 
•om 
you, received the message, so I went to Stub Hub instead...I really prefer to 
order from your website and would like to get this issue fixed. 
My name is Lesley Groff and I'm a personal assistant to Jeffrey Epstein (the card on file with you) 
My email address I have used is: 
and I believe I have even tried using my personal email address at times when an issue has 
occurred, but still using Mr. Epstein's card: 
My office phone numbe 
Could you please look in to this error problem and help rectify? I'd love to place more orders on 
your website. 
Thank you,
