Dear Lesley, 
EFTA R1_00990202 
EFTA02233401

On Friday a gift should arrive for 
Jeffrey to NY with Fedex, tracking 
number 
. I would really 
appreciate if you could arrange that it is 
received when expected. Would be 
really nice if somebody could take off 
the first layer of packing, so that gift 
wrapping would be seen and 2 letters 
that are together with the box put on 
top of the box when giving it to Jeffrey. 
Hope your Christmas were calm and 
beautiful! Have a lovely day!
