I wanted to circle back with more details and to best determine of final count in order to plan accordingly. We will be leaving from Stamford as close to 5:30pm as possible. The Soundwaters team has informed me that the sun sets at 7:20pm that evening and it will be dark (difficult to sail) shortly after that. They know it will be difficult for us all to get there by EFTA_R1_01050158 EFTA02256821 5:30pm, but they advised leaving as soon after that time as possible. I have told them we will do our best. We will be back to the dock around 7:30pm. We will have some food and beverages on the boat. The boat can accommodate up to 40 people. There are about 26 of us. With all spouses, we would be 51 so I think there is a chance to work it all out...l just need to know from TOUR can come ASAP. Please let me know....
