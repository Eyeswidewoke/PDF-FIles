| **Subject** | Jeffrey Epstein Good morning Evette. I understand from Jeffrey he still has not spoken with Dr. Richman—he says Dr. Richman spoke with Dr. Kruger yesterday, but Jeffrey is still hoping to speak with Dr. Richman directly. Jeffrey is flying at the moment but due to land at 9:08am...he will fly again today around 4:30pm_do you think it is possible for Dr. Richman to call Jeffrey on his cell today sometime in between these times?! Jeffrey's cell: Please let me know! and if you could give me a ball park time Dr. Richman might call I can put Jeffrey on `high alert' to listen for his phone to ring! Thanks for your help Evette!!

hoping to speak with Dr. Richman directly. Jeffrey is flying at the moment but 
due to land at 9:08am...he will fly again today around 4:30pm_do you think it is 
possible for Dr. Richman to call Jeffrey on his cell today sometime in between 
these times?! 
Jeffrey's cell: 
Please let me know! and if you could give me a ball park time Dr. Richman might 
call I can put Jeffrey on `high alert' to listen for his phone to ring! 
Thanks for your help Evette!!
