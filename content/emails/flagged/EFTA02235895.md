| **Subject** | Re: Jeffrey Epstein Dear Leslie, I will certainly bring with me the general idea for the master plan concept but I feel it will be best that I personally walk Jeffrey through it during our meeting instead of sending it in advance. Please let me know if this is acceptable to him and I would appreciate if you can confirm our meeting on Friday Feb 2nd. As I mentioned Jeffrey, I could also meet Thursday evening if it is more convenient for him. I will land in NY at 4:00pm. Kind regards, Ramon Alonso On Jan 19, 2018, at 7:58 PM, Lesley Grofla wrote: Hello Ramon. Hope you are well.

Dear Leslie, I will certainly bring with me the general idea for the master plan concept but I feel it 
will be best that I personally walk Jeffrey through it during our meeting instead of sending it in 
advance. 
Please let me know if this is acceptable to him and I would appreciate if you can confirm our 
meeting on Friday Feb 2nd. 
As I mentioned Jeffrey, I could also meet Thursday evening if it is more convenient for him. I will 
land in NY at 4:00pm. 
Kind regards, 
Ramon Alonso
