Hi 
just checking in...Hope your move went as well as can be yesterday. 
When would be good for us to deliver your gift cards to you?! Just let me 
know...next week perhaps? Once a little more settled?

Hi Lesley, 
I am moving into my new apartment on March 14. Is it 
possible to hold on to the gift card until then? 
Otherwise I will be teaching on Friday at 
. It's not the easiest place to get to 
sine 
running. Please let me know which you prefer? 
Kind regards,

Do you have a doorman at your new apartment? 
Or should we deliver to your work?
