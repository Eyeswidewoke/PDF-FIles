Good morning Katherine. Jeffrey will be bringing a very good friend of his 
along with her 17 year old son with him this Sunday to Harvard. Jeffrey is 
asking if Martin could call the developmental office and arrange a tour of 
Harvard for this young man and his mom. Might this be possible please!?
