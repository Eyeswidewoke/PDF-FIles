Arc the apartments available now? I'm thinking of having Eileen join me Saturday or 
Sunday in New York and have her get there early and wait for me, planning to 
spend the week in New York with her let me know if the apartments are available 
Saturday or Sunday early just one apartment 7J for me and I'll put Dave in 10b on 
Tuesday 
If you think that would be OK? Many thanks Larry
