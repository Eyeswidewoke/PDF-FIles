I am happy to pass on a message from Mr. Epstein requesting a call, but could you provide an introductory paragraph as to what Mr. Epstein would like to discuss? Peter may not be aware of who he is and it would help if he knows what the discussion will entail. I'm not sure what his schedule is this week. He still has his autoresponder on as of today.
