I could send you the invoice form that has to be filled And added to other documents. But then I also show the overall value of the package usually low.

Hello 
I 
really like the Sorel 
Women's Emetic 
Lace boots! They 
look durable and I 
like the color. They 
are a bit different 
than the ones we 
were looking at 
yesterday, but 
perhaps these make 
more sense if you 
get a lot of

They come in size 
9 and I0US..which
