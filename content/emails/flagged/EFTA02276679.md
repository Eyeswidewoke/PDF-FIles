The apartment mailbox keys are in my little file cabinet under my desk towards the front of the folders. They should be in a large envelope. 8a. should be labeled.

Hi merwin. The apartment mailbox keys are in my little file cabinet 
under my desk towards the front of the folders. They should be in 
a large envelope. 8a. should be labeled. If there is only one key 
we need to make sure and have a second one made!
