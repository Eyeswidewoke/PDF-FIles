| **Subject** | 1111/ ticket to future date Natasha, is it possible for you to find a date in the future (like end of Sept) where we do not have to pay any fare difference but only the change fee for ticket? How much is the change fee? I am positive she will go see him at some point again in Paris...but at the moment Jeffrey has nothing on the calendar for all of August to go to Paris-it will be in Sept for sure...look end of Sept. or beginning of Oct. Trying to determine if we can save some of the money spent on this ticket or not...thanks EFTA_R1_01036810 EFTA02250804 |
