Subject Re: meet JE at Meridean 
Hello Sir, 
If I'm understanding the problem correctly, purchased video content downloaded to your iPad is 
refusing to play on the TV via the iPad lightning to HDMI adapter because of an HDCP error. 
Do you have *any* Internet connection up in the air? My suspicion is that iTunes content wants 
to connect to the Apple servers to authenticate, and without intemet connection is failing that 
check. 
Thank you,
