tomorrow around 3pm (instead of Friday)which means I can have the apt turned 
around on Friday (instead of Monday when the maid is working) So YES to moving in 
on Sunday. However, are we just talking clothes and small things? For a 
"move"The apartment complex makes us reserve an elevator and you can only "move" 
into an apt on certain days/times. I assume she has the typical '21 year old' 
stuff? 
She does not need to bring furniture.
