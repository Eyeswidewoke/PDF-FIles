Hi Jeffrey, 
It was lovely seeing you again and I'm glad we were able to connect while you're still in 
town. As I've mentioned, me and 
are determined to grow our company and 
we're even planning to rename it in a less targeted name soon (Millenium 
communications with Crypto PR Lab being a sister company - thoughts?). 
The idea is to focus on crypto PR, business speaker agency, events organization (such as 
Davos) with global recognition. We're very excited about it :) 
Also as I've mentioned, we'd like to raise capital and we really need some advise on what 
direction to take. I've put together a very raw picture of what we currently have in 
terms of financials and I'd really appreciate your take on how to build a solid 
roadmap to raise some capital and build bigger operations. 
Looking forward to your feedback!
