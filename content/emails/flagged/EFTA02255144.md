I bought you a DIRECT COACH scat on tomorrows flight Finnair #5 to 
NY...Finnair is supposed to provide you with a flight however and it says the 
flight you were to be on is to take off again as you say...but at least you will know 
this is booked. 
52185.51 including taxes/fully refundable. We will need to VOID this ticket if you 
are able to get out on your original flight. Please keep me posted. We will need to 
VOID this prior to take off (which is going to be 7:10am my time tomorrow...you 
should know way before this though.) Traveling can sometimes be painful...but 
hang in there! You will get back to NY I promise.
