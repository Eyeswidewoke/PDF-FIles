Actually the first email response was correct...this trip is for Sept. 12-14... 
-Is the connecting flight the earliest one of the day on Sept. 12th? I was hoping to get her in earlier. 
If this is the only connecting flight available and the direct is sold out then lets put it on HOLD along 
with the return at 8:40pm on the 14th.
