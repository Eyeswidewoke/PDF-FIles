They are a bit different than the ones we were looking at yesterday, but perhaps these make more sense if you get a lot of inclement weather. They come in size 9 and I 0US..which translates to a size 40 or 41 (correct?) Which would be better? I like this with either the green or the ivory coat...which do you prefer? I will order today...

Hello 
I really like the Sorel Women's Emetic 
Lace boots! They look durable and I like the color. They 
are a bit different than the ones we were looking at 
yesterday, but perhaps these make more sense if you get 
a lot of inclement weather. They come in size 9 and 
I 0US..which translates to a size 40 or 41 (correct?) 
Which would be better? I like this with either the green 
or the ivory coat...which do you prefer? I will order 
today...
