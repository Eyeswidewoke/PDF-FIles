Hi Lesley, 
I'm sorry, I should have known that she was a female. I do have the reservation on hold 
We can hold until July 23 at 11:59pm 
I just called the hotel back because I did not receive their email. 
She said she will try again. She also advised we would have to do a wire transfer or book 
online thru their website, 
which we can not do. 
I will send you the rate , for some reason they won't quote over the phone either.
