Husband - Ozzy Osborne - Brice - another hair thing - one lacking, one not 
But will take Sharon Osborne as a good compliment-no messing around with that girl, 
would like to look as pretty* 
Funny, has been mentioned before and for some reason Susan Sarandon - something 
about the cyes everyone says, unable to see that - more like we have the same shoe 
size* 
Have a great weekend 
best
