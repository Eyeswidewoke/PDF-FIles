| **Subject** | 3m Hi Les, I was wondering if could stop by 3m tomorrow or on Thursday to change the bedsheets and bring clean towels. The apt is pretty clean, I will have some personal things out as I will be coming back to stay here on Thursday night with my family. I think we are fine with the matrass bed as well! If she could install it before Thursday night and also bring an additional blanket for the bedroom that would be great! Thank you!

Hi Les, 
I was wondering if 
could stop by 3m tomorrow or on 
Thursday to change the bedsheets and bring clean towels. 
The apt is pretty clean, I will have some personal things 
out as I will be coming back to stay here on Thursday 
night with my family. 
I think we are fine with the matrass bed as well! If she could install it before 
Thursday night and also bring an additional blanket for 
the bedroom that would be great! Thank you!
