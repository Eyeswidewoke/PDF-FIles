We stay downtown all day, beginning at a restaurant (kind of hard to visit with a lot of people) in the morning. We will then move to an exterior shot for a cab scene and then an exterior shot for another cab scene. Do you know what time he'd try to visit at? I don't have the addresses nor times we will be shooting yet but could try to guess lunch time and when we won't be around on set.

Hi Lesley, 
We have several moves throughout the day. We stay downtown all day, beginning at 
a restaurant (kind of hard to visit with a lot of people) in the morning. We will 
then move to an exterior shot for a cab scene and then an exterior shot for 
another cab scene. Do you know what time he'd try to visit at? I don't have the 
addresses nor times we will be shooting yet but could try to guess lunch time and 
when we won't be around on set.
