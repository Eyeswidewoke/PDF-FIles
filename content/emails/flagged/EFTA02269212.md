7th January I should go to Kaliningrad. To make it easier I can tell you flights, let's figure 
out the flight to the states first 
EFTA_R1_01075156

And I prefer to come to the states via Miami rather then because the passport control 
there is less strict otherwise I'll go to the police again because of my often flights, 
Jeffrey knows it.
