Good afternoon Lesley. 
I have shown the shade structure at flag pole pool to 
Elderfield Roberts, 
and John Bedminste  
Another gentleman, Mr Gumbs was sent out here by 
Anna, I believe, and was shown the shade structure but I 
did not get contact info from him. He took mine. 
The engineering doors were shown to Mr Bedminster along with the second 
floor at pebble beach, replacing doors and windows at the 
gym, 5 palms sliders, and retiling the master bath shower. 
Elderfield also was shown the pebble beach 2nd floor project. 
As I get others to look at these projects I will let you know. 
Thank you, 
MG.
