correct, there is no direct from St. Bart's to STT...it is only the return he was hoping to take a direct 
flight back...however, he needs a full day on the island...if you look at the first email I sent you he 
found flights...my question is, he would arrive on 5th at 12:39AM then depart on 6th at 8:45AM? 
That doesn't make sense? He could take the flights you found on 4th and depart on the direct 
flight on 6th..then he would get an entire day on the island..unless I am thinking of this 
incorrectly...landing at 12:39am? or maybe he meant he would arrive on 5th at 12:39PM? 
something is amiss....it would be an all day layover in San Juan the way he has it...? 
No direct on the 5th. On the 6th, will 6th work?

It's not very simple as tradewind do not have many flight available.

ARRIVAL :11 AM 
SAN JUAN to ST THOMASs the same day with CAP AIR 
Departure 12:03AM 
ARRIVAL :12:39 AM 
and the days after the 6th 
There is a direct fight from 
ST THOMAS to SBH with tradewind 
Departure 08:45AM 
ARRIVAL :09:38 AM
