Lesley, 
We have several moves throughout the day. We stay downtown all day, beginning at a restaurant 
(kind of hard to visit with a lot of people) in the morning. We will then move to an exterior 
shot for a cab scene and then an exterior shot for another cab scene. Do you know what time 
he'd try to visit at? I don't have the addresses nor times we will be shooting yet but could try 
to guess lunch time and when we won't be around on set.
