Re: What is your US Cell #? 
Thank you! 
Also, Make sure you take Martin Nowak's KEY CARD with you. This opens the door 
to his office...It is located in an envelope in the top right hand drawer of my 
desk. It is clearly labeled. When you come back be sure to place the envelope 
with the Key Card back in the drawer for me. OK? :)
