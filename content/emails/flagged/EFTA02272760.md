If I reserve and you pay at hotel you can cancel up to 24 hours before arrival. Are you sure you will go? If so, I will book your room and prepay. If not, is it possible for you to pay and be reimbursed? Let me know what is best. > On Jan 31, 2019, at 12:33 PM, < > wrote: > Sure we can do this one .

Re: Italy 
, In order to pay for your hotel room I have to prepay ...means no 
cancellations or changes—or I can reserve you the hotel room but you have to pay 
at the hotel. If I reserve and you pay at hotel you can cancel up to 24 hours 
before arrival. Are you sure you will go? If so, I will book your room and 
prepay. If not, is it possible for you to pay and be reimbursed? Let me know 
what is best.
