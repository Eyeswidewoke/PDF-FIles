I noticed my statement shows you applied my check #2490 toward my outstanding balance—just want to make sure you know that was a deposit for our 2 trees Tom ordered! I really should send you a check for invoice #18117 in the full amount vs deducting the deposit for the trees...I don't want to screw up your accounting ...just want to make sure we are all on the same page. You should probably type up an invoice for the deposit on the trees and apply my $4666.00 to that! In the meantime, I will send you a check for Inv#18117 for total $4498.61 as well as a check for 120 Oak Street in the amount of $845.48 from our RedHawk Account (Inv#18118) Let me know when you think Tom will plant the trees as well as PURPLE flowers for me! (I sent a not saying I would like purple flowers this year instead of pink!! ok for you?) > On May 5, 2018, at 12:54 PM, Thomas Costello < wrote: > <Lesley Groff.pdf> EFTA_R1_01017747 EFTA02243759 |

Re: April Invoice 
Hi Ann! I noticed my statement shows you applied my check #2490 toward my 
outstanding balance—just want to make sure you know that was a deposit for our 2 
trees Tom ordered! 
I really should send you a check for invoice #18117 in the 
full amount vs deducting the deposit for the trees...I don't want to screw up your 
accounting ...just want to make sure we are all on the same page. You should 
probably type up an invoice for the deposit on the trees and apply my $4666.00 to 
that! In the meantime, I will send you a check for 
Inv#18117 for total $4498.61 
as well as a check for 120 Oak Street in the amount of $845.48 from our RedHawk 
Account (Inv#18118) 
Let me know when you think Tom will plant the trees as well as PURPLE flowers for 
me! (I sent a not saying I would like purple flowers this year instead of pink!! 
ok for you?)
