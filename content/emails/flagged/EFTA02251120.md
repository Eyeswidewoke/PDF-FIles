Hi Lesley, 
if you are not planning on using the car in France, you do not need to register 
the car. If your boss is moving to France, he can only 
drive for 2 weeks with the license plates. Afterward, he 
needs to register it. Another option might be issuing a 
Carnet. If he gets a Carnet, he can stay up to one year 
with the car in the EU and use his American registration, 
afterward he needs to ship it back to the US.
