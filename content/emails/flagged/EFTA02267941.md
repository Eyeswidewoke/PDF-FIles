We're very excited about it :) Also as I've mentioned, we'd like to raise capital and we really need some advise on what direction to take. I've put together a very raw picture of what we currently have in terms of financials and I'd really appreciate your take on how to build a solid roadmap to raise some capital and build bigger operations.

Hi Jeffrey, 
It was lovely seeing you again and I'm &ad we were able to connect while you're 
still in town. As I've mentioned, me and 
are determined to 
grow our company and we're even planning to rename it in a less 
targeted name soon (Millenium communications with Crypto PR 
Lab being a sister company - thoughts?). 
The idea is to focus on crypto PR, business speaker agency, events organization 
(such as Davos) with global recognition. We're very excited about it 
:) 
Also as I've mentioned, we'd like to raise capital and we really need some advise on 
what direction to take. I've put together a very raw picture of what 
we currently have in terms of financials and I'd really appreciate 
your take on how to build a solid roadmap to raise some capital and 
build bigger operations. 
Looking forward to your feedback! 
Kind regards,
