Hi Jeffrey, 
Hope you're well, what a pity you are not in town, would have loved to see 
you.. 
Yesterday we have checked and realized there's Itzhak Perlman concert at 
Carnegie on April 25. Unfortunately it's already fully 
sold out... I know it's crazy to ask, but since you're 
friends with Itzhak, I wonder if you think there could 
be any chance for us to get in and see the concert? I 
know it sounds quite crazy to ask such thing but I 
know you like crazy things and decided to give it a 
try...:)
