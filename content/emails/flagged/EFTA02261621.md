Hi Lesley 
We finished cleaning I1J....and do I have to put flowers and fruits? 
I have following few notes: 
I. The new sheets that's Nili brought has no duvet cover, so we put clean duvet cover from us. 
2. I check the refrigerator and there is lots of good items and it's all good, so I didn't throw 
anything out. 
3. I put the extra towels in the closet next to their bathroom if they happen to ask 
Thanks

They are Returning today and the alarm is off. I believe Leo has 
already cleaned it and it should be just fine but Nili would like us to 
check up on it. Please let me know as soon as you can. Thanks
