HiM„ 
so true about the 35 second delay while handling an emergency, no pilot really understands how 
they will address in emergency until it really happens to them most people may get tunnel vision 
and freeze,,, Captain Sully is exactly correct you need to have a delay when reenacting a real 
emergency,,, 
No apt for me,,, I'll be flying to Savannah Saturday„ 
Also Jeffrey said he may need to fly to New York on Friday, I'm sure there's something brewing 
or an event ,,,you probably are aware already 
Thx
