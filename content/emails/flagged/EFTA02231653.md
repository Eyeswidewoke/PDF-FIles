Hi Lesley: 
I can rearrange for 2:00 pm; actually when I rearrange, a little earlier, 1:00 or 1:30, 
would be a bit better, but if not, then 2:00 is fine. 
Please advise.

Actually.... the real story is that I'm meeting with the full hospice team -
hospice rules are a maximum of six months of life to 
qualify for medicare payments for their excellent care -
qualifications are their responsibility. Mom is now 
approaching two years on hospice and going strong, 
causing them 'problems'. Their thrilled, of course, but 
can't decide if she has to 'graduate' and loose the 
excellent care or they can continue to try to justify, which 
we all want, since the care is very good.
