Hi Les, 
I was wondering if Tes could stop by 3m tomorrow or 
on Thursday to change the bedsheets and bring clean 
towels. The apt is pretty clean, I will have some 
personal things out as I will be coming back to stay 
here on Thursday night with my family. 
I think we arc fine with the matrass bed as well! If she could install it before 
Thursday night and also bring an additional blanket for 
the bedroom that would be great! Thank you!
