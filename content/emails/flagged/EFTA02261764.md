I made a mistake when I gave my availability. I should have said: 
I will be in NYC on Wed Oct 3. The best time for me to meet 
that day would be 7:30 am 
to 11 am, or after 5 pm. 
But I could be free any time 
that day. I could also meet 
Oct 4 at 7:30 am to 10 am. 
So I could breakfast Oct 3 or 4.
