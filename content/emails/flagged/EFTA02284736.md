said to make sure Darren is on 
the island early enough to take 
Bannon and 2 others to the 
island on Sat. Bannon and the 
2 others would arrive STT 
around 12:30pm (whether they 
fly from NY or Washington) 
Can you make sure Darren is 
on island in time to fly them 
please? Below are the 2 flights I 
have for them 
UA1443 depart Washington 
8:26am arrive 12:26pm 
OR 
DL465 Depart NY at 8:35am arrive STT 12:36pm

Hi 
I see JE copied me on the Bannon trip„ 
He is going to STT on Saturday? 
JE said he would fly Sunday from STT to NY on Sunday, 
do you think 
Sunday to NY is a 
go? 
The reason I asked, 
i am using Darren and Chip as Pilots on Sunday, Darren 
returns to St 
Thomas on 
Saturday afternoon. 
Chip is on St 
Thomas now. 
I'm just trying to figure out if all is covered, Darren is the 
only one that can 
fly the helicopter as 
well as me, 
Jeffrey sent me home yesterday to get some home time, 
I'm just trying to 
make sure all is

covered?
