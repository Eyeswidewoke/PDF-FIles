Re: Lsj 
Sounds good 
thanks for keeping me in the loop, 
Darren and myse 
are supposed to start Sikorsky helicopter school Monday morning 
at 8 AM in Palm Beach„ 
I told Jeffrey if he left St Thomas Sunday, Darren would be available for him to 
fly the helicopter from LSJ to the airport, otherwise if he left on Monday he 
would have to take the boat, 
Jeffrey said he would leave on Sunday to New York, I'm planning to have Darren 
arrive St. Thomas on Saturday, so Jeffrey could leave on Sunday to New York, and 
most likely Darren would airline home Sunday night, of course this could change 
till Monday I'll keep you posted 
I'm sure Jeffrey doesn't care if Darren doesn't make class on Monday, 
I'll keep you posted 
thanks Larry

I have nothing about coming to NY on Sunday.
