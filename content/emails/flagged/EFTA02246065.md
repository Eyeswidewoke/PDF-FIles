SCHOOL ITALY: 
So, I also like the course audiences of art (20 hours) must 
be interesting! With 
4 modules of 
cooking. (12 hours) 
during 7 days ( 
around 5 hours per 
day for school 
staff)

I have to check the schedule of classes in school. Waiting 
for their answer.

I'm thinking to go first to Bolognia (from Paris straight 1,5 
hours flight; from 
my hometown just 
1 stop, according to 
flight from Rostov 
to Florence 3 stops) 
So, spend there 1 
day come around 
10-11 pm on 
20th May, ??rent a 
hotel to walk 
during the day, rent 
the car 
(https://www.hcrtz. 
com/rentacar/resery 
ati
on/) and by 
evening 21 we will 
be in Florence). In 
Florence I'm 
thinking about to 
rent an Airbnb apt 
for a week. It will 
be more freedome 
and space and less 
expensive 
according to hotel. 
This apartment for example:

So, If all will be good, on 29 morning we rent ( for 2 days) 
a car 
(lit t ps://www.hertz 
com rentacarkeser 
anon/ around $70 
per clay ) and go to 
San Gimiano city 
for one day, than to 
Pisa city ( I night, I 
day) ??need a hotel 
and than during 4 
hours through the 
coast road to 
Milano on 31 of 
may, 5 days in 
Milano. Didn't 
decide yet what to 
rent better (apt or 
hotel). 
From Milan I'm happy to comeback straight to USA))))
