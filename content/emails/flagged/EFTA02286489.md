Greetings Rich, 
Seth leaves tomorrow 5/23. He will submit the samples for testing Friday, 5/24. The 
results should be ready in 24 hours; so he should have the results back by Saturday 
5/25 or Tuesday, 5/28. Once mold is confirmed and identified, Seth will look at 
his schedule for mobilization. 
I told Seth we need a report from him before he leaves of what he outlined above. Our 
Principal is certain mold will be confirmed; he is in residence 6/2-6/7 potentially, 
can he Seth return 6/10? 
If mold is confirmed I suggested the following schedule: 
Equipment is delivered to Tropical Shipping Monday, 6/3, sails Wednesday, 6/5, EDA on 
STT Saturday 6/8.
