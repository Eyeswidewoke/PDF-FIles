Can you go in and use his email address and give it a password (something easy like: `island' or `Jeffrey') then let me know so I can tell him? I want him to log on and see the progress...

Jermaine, is it possible to set up Jeffrey's account and merely give him the link? Can you go in 
and use his email address and give it a password (something easy like: `island' or `Jeffrey') then 
let me know so I can tell him? I want him to log on and see the progress...

Good eveningM 
The boss has not logged in as yet. I don't see any entries under his email address. 
Just an FYI 
if you click the File tab on that is on the same level with the name of the sheet there is an 
Activity log option. It reports who has logged in and what modifications were 
made. Let me know if you have any problems finding it. Hope this helps.
