Lesley, can you pass this to Jeffrey when possible. I'm in Chgo but around anytime to 
discuss. My mobile is 8479890983.

Jeffrey, 
Hope things are well with you and wanted to send a note ahead of the Holiday. 
I'm attached the latest PR from our Jadestone Energy. 
It shows an inflection point on the business. Which at $56 brent generates positive cash 
flow. And on a go forward w now $63brent, should look even better. 
We now have production of 5000+bpd and a low risk, mature portfolio with strong 
organic growth opportunities. 
In the release, you will see we are now looking at a dual listing and plan to move to 
London in 01. We also have engaged bankers BMO and Stifel for that process. 
Today, there remains one holder with legacy stock (which is a selleriand in which 
Livermore just acquired 8mm shares from. 
With that block removed, we foresee the equity rerating in a strong way. There is 20-
40perc upside once that block is crossed. And longer term, potential for 2-4X from here.
