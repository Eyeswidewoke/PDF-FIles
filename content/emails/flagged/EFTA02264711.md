I'm sorry to bother you with it, but my cleaning lady just canceled and I totally do not know what to do... I also have some holes and nails in the walls... So I probably need to remove and cover it. Leo mentioned that I can ask him about it, but I decided first to write you... Looking forward to your answer. Again, deeply apologize to bother with this...
