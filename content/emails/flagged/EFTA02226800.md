| **Subject** | More Info Re Treadmill Test! Mr. Epstein should wear comfortable clothes and shoes. He should bring his insurance card and a photo ID. There are three components to the testing, so I suspect he will be done around 11:30 AM. Unfortunately, I am with other clients and not able to meet him there. Nevertheless, I will forward the reports to Dr. Moskowitz when available. Please let me know if you need anything going forward. EFTA_R1_00971262 EFTA02226800 |
