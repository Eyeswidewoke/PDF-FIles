Dear Lesley, 
Thank you so very much for your time in looking into this for me. I very much appreciate 
it!! 
After looking at the prices to change I decided to keep it as it is (and depart on the 3rd) as 
it would actually be more expensive to pay for the flight than to stay in my 
accommodation here for the extra days. 
Congratulations on your little Gemma!!! I absolutely love golden doodles!
