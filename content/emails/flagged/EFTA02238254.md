| **CC** | Ka Hello Merwin, Jojo, Sonam, Leo and Marilyn. Jeffrey would like you to please ask Karyna for time off for days owed. Once she approves, she will tell you and me. I will then include in Jeffrey's calendar. When it comes to extended vacation time requests, please clear with Karyna first, but then the request will come to me so Jeffrey can approve the final word. Thank you!
