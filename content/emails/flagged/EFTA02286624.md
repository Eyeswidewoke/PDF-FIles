Good afternoon Lesley. 
I have shown the shade structure at flag pole pool to Elderfield Roberts, 
and John Bedminster, 
Another gentleman, Mr Gumbs was sent out here by Anna, I believe, and was 
shown the shade structure but I did not get contact info from him. He took mine. 
The engineering doors were shown to Mr Bedminster along with the second floor at 
pebble beach, replacing doors and windows at the gym, 5 palms sliders, and 
retiling the master bath shower. 
Elderfield also was shown the pebble beach 2nd floor project. 
As I get others to look at these projects I will let you know. 
Thank you, 
MG.
