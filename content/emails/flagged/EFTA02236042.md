Good morning Lesley, I heard from Dr. Hard, he would like Mr. Epstein to get a MRA. The order has been placed in his chart. If he would like to get it done at Cornell you can call 646-962-3000 to schedule it. I can also call but I would just need some dates and times he is available. We will also be calling the insurance to authorize the exam if it is needed. Let me know, thanks!! Kellie EFTA_R1_00998358 EFTA02236042 |

Good morning Lesley, 
I heard from Dr. Hard, he would like Mr. Epstein to get a MRA. The order has been placed in his chart. 
If he would like to get it done at Cornell you can call 646-962-3000 to schedule it. I can also call but I 
would just need some dates and times he is available. We will also be calling the insurance to 
authorize the exam if it is needed. Let me know, thanks!!
