JE would be horrified if we used pink, even a soft tone. "Beach sand" it is :)

Greetings Lesley, 
I just highlighted the lines that have the word Complete in the description or have a 
completion date filled in. Per Stephanie, when I asked her for the 
completion dates of the items she stated are complete but have no 
completion date, these items were completed before the Punch List 
was created. JE said to put them on the Punch List because he was 
not sure if they were completed or not. 
When Stephanie gives me the completion dates today, I will fill them in. Let me 
know if you see any that I missed.
