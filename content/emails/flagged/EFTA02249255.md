how would you 
retrieve the tickets 
from them? They 
live close enough? 
I have no idea! 
I'm sureit 
spoke to 
she 
could let her 
parents know..but I 
hate to purchase 
until we know for 
sure...I will need 
their home address 
and someone must 
be home to sign for 
them..,they do not 
make it easy and 
the tickets arc close 
to $900.00 each 
now...

the tickets can only be sent to a physical 
address IN Russia (paper tickets not emailed 
tickets!)...we need to know where you will 
stay...do you have a hotel in mind? or do you 
know someone in Kazan who can receive the 
tickets for you?
