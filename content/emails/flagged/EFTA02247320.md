did you speak to the airline baggage 
department before you left the airport and 
report the lost baggage? I assume you 
did...I just looked on the website and it 
appears they only reimburse you for

'necessity purchases'...You should call XL 
Airways and speak to a representative in 
the baggage department + 
...I would hope they would compensate 
for what was lost!? I do think airlines 
normally DO find luggage and get to 
proper owner...did you have a name tag on 
your luggage?
