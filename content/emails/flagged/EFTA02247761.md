Dear 
Many thanks for your last Email. Those 
clarifications give us a better vision on the Main 
Residence project. 
In the way to move forward on the project, we'll 
need the island topographies plan and associated 
documentation and information. 
With those documents we'll be able to start to 
work; on a first preliminary master plan as well as 
first preliminary studies for Main Residence.

Just one more question. Regarding the Main 
Residence could we suggest to you, other 
locations on the island, or do we need absolutely 
to keep the previous one. For the Main 
Residence do there's also any visuals 
requirements or recommendation, weather 
special complementary conditions, etc... Who 
could be architecturally helpful? 
On our side we'll prepare a first proposal for this 
preliminary work mission for the Main Residence, 
who'll include: 
Island Master Plan 
Main house furnished plan 
Main House Main Section & Elevations 
3D View & Rendering 
Thank you for your assistance,
