Hello 
The beat in your apartment is working well. There 
was a repair yesterday done on the heating system. The air 
conditioners where also winterized. The apartment is warm , 
Tomorrow a new dishwasher is being delivered and installed. We will 
also look at the ceiling and repairing that. 
Let me know if you need anything else. 
Thank you Andrew.

Hi Andrew and Anthony, 
Thank you very much for your coordination in 
addressing the heating issue. 
Could you please kindly update us from yesterday what exactly is the issue 
with the heating system in my apartment? 
As of this morning, it still barely works. Cesar was at my apartment on 
Sunday and said that there is a need for additional lattice 
installation to let the heat to come through, is 
that correct?
