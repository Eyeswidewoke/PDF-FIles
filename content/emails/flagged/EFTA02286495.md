| **Subject** | Dr. Friedman Sent copy of Medicare and United Health Care card to Friedman's office to keep on file. Dr. Friedman's office says they can put you in a room when you come back but you will still have to wait like 10 min. for the doctor as he is seeing other patients also. They will try to get him in as quickly as possible to you when you return. (this is why I like first appointment of the day and try to schedule as such!...I asked if they have first appointment available tomorrow or Friday, but they do not) EFTA_R1_01112729 EFTA02286495 |
