Dear Lesley, 
On Frida a ift should arrive for Jeffrey to NY with Fedex, tracking number 
. I would really appreciate if you could arrange that it is received 
when expected. Would be really nice if somebody could take off the first layer of 
packing, so that gift wrapping would be seen and 2 letters that are together with 
the box put on top of the box when giving it to Jeffrey. 
Hope your Christmas were calm and beautiful! Have a lovely day!
