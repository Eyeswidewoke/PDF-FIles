I thought you would like a day to regroup! Same exact flights as before. If not I believe i can still change to Jan 8-11. Re the trip Miami to Moscow on Jan 7, yes it is confirmed and it is premium economy. Best I can do to keep the ticket price within my spending limits. Also, I don't think Biz was even available. This flight was tricky due to it being so close to the travel dates. Many flights sold out completely. Lesley Sent from my iPhone On Dec 31, 2018, at 8:42 AM, sc ). wrote: Hi, Lesley!

About Kaliningrad, sure, I just check if they have same date and same airport Aeroflot su 1006 January 8th And return Su 1001 January 11th May be we can just change those ones that we had on 3-7th? Or it's easier to book a new one? Should I send confirmation number you sent me before?

Morning! I just changed the Kaliningrad trip to Jan 9-13. Will this work for you? I thought you 
would like a day to regroup! Same exact flights as before. If not I believe i can still change to 
Jan 8-11. 
Re the trip Miami to Moscow on Jan 7, yes it is confirmed and it is premium economy. Best I can 
do to keep the ticket price within my spending limits. Also, I don't think Biz was even available. 
This flight was tricky due to it being so close to the travel dates. Many flights sold out 
completely.
