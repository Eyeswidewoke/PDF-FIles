I would really appreciate if you could arrange that it is received when expected. Would be really nice if somebody could take off the first layer of packing, so that gift wrapping would be seen and 2 letters that are together with the box put on top of the box when giving it to Jeffrey. Hope your Christmas were calm and beautiful! Have a lovely day! EFTA_R1_00989375 EFTA02233050 |

On Friday a gift should arrive for Jeffry to NY with Fedex, tracking 
number 
. I would really 
appreciate if you could arrange that it is 
received when expected. Would be really 
nice if somebody could take off the first layer 
of packing, so that gift wrapping would be 
seen and 2 letters that are together with the 
box put on top of the box when giving it to 
Jeffrey. 
Hope your Christmas were calm and beautiful! Have a lovely day!
