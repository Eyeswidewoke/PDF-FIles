I will see if Jeffrey will set up an account but he probably will want it faxed. We can get you the signed letter you need.

If he does not have a Weill Cornell Connect Account yet, I encourage Mr. Epstein to sign up for one as this is a secure electronic messaging system. It is a faster and more reliable way to communicate with your physician, nurse and our office along with requesting refills, appointments, and obtaining your results.

Re: Jeffrey Epstein 
Hi Jessica and thank you so much for your reply. Jeffrey is available today to 
go over his results. Will you or Dr Paduch call him? Can we set a time? I will 
see if Jeffrey will set up an account but he probably will want it faxed. We can 
get you the signed letter you need.
