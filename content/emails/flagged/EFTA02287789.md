Dear Lesley --
I just got home. As Jeffrey might have told you, I am free 
almost all the time. The conference that I go to once a 
year is about the only time I go anywhere. Let me know 
when Jeffrey is free, remind me of the address and those 
infernal door codes, and I'll make sure to be there. 
With best wishes, 
D
