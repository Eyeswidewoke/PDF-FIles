I was told no agent has access to her account) I tried to purchase you a whole new ticket myself on line which YOU must PRINT for yourself at a Kiosk at the station...please give yourself an hour to handle all of this...you may have to go to the window with your new booking number AND your ticket you have. I tried to call Rail Europe all day long and-no one ever answered. We were on hold all day and could not e-chat either.
