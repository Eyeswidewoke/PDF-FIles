Barbro and I will be stand by on Friday (I will fly from DC on Thursday evening), hence we will be able to meet Jeffrey at any time. We are also free on Saturday (if at all convenient?). Unfortunately Barbro will be leaving New York on Monday, hence she cannot meet Jeffrey next week. (However, I am free next week). Again, many thanks for your email, and we hope we will find a time to meet Jeffrey in the end of the week! On The, Nov 27, 2018 at 12:50 PM Lesley Groff ‹ > wrote: Hello and thank you for your mail.

Dear Lesley, 
Thank you very much for your quick reply, I highly appreciate it. 
Barbro and I will be stand by on Friday (I will fly from DC on Thursday evening), hence we will 
be able to meet Jeffrey at any time. We are also free on Saturday (if at all convenient?). 
Unfortunately Barbro will be leaving New York on Monday, hence she cannot meet Jeffrey next 
week. (However, I am free next week). 
Again, many thanks for your email, and we hope we will find a time to meet Jeffrey in the end of 
the week!
