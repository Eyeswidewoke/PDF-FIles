We had to order batteries for your key pad, but we were able to get in with the help of a locksmith. All good for now. We were not able to exterminate the apartment however because the exterminator had to leave before we were able to get the door open. Just keeping you up to date. When the new batteries arrive I will let you know. Take care, Lesley Hi Les, We brought up 24 packages in total. <image Ljpeg> Thanks Merwin Dela Cruz EFTA_R1_01110146 EFTA02285384 |
