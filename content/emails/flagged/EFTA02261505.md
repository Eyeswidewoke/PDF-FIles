I am checkingBut I am not sure that you can 
fly from Chicago to St. Thomas and back in 
one day I would think he needs at least five 
hours on the islands?! Or more? I am getting 
information on an early departure from 
Chicago to Saint Thomas on Thursday and 
early departure back to Chicago Friday 
morning if a direct round-trip on Thursday 
does not exist
