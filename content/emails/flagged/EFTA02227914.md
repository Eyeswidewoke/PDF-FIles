Dear Lesley, 
I bet Jeffrey's schedule is very busy and tight. Fm still in NY until Wednesday 
October 19th in case there's a moment for us to meet. 
But for the meanwhile, could you please make sure he receives this poster for my 
concert at Carnegie? 
The concert is on Friday October 14th at 7;30 PM. 
If Jeffrey would like to come, could you please specify how many tickets he will 
need? I'll take care of them. 
Also, if he thinks of anyone I should invite to that concert, please make a list of 
names and I'll leave them at the box office. 
Thank you and have a great week,
