I am free Saturday, for a window between 4-6. As much as I appreciate the invite to his house; I don't do house visits as first encounters plus I'm coming from the other side of town so that makes it a little bit more challenging. I def am intending to arrange a meet up, so my request would be to meet somewhere in the lower cast side. Could you let me know if that would work for him as well :)?

Hi Lesley, 
thank you for your reply. My schedule filled up a little in the last week, and unfortunately 
that means fix tomorrow I'm not available. 
I am free Saturday, for a window between 4-6. As much as I appreciate the invite to his 
house; I don't do house visits as first encounters plus I'm coming from the other 
side of town so that makes it a little bit more challenging. 
I def am intending to arrange a meet up, so my request would be to meet somewhere in 
the lower cast side. 
Could you let me know if that would work for him as well :)? 
Thank you, 
Warm regards, 
Nath
