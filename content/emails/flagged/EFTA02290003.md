We just finished unloading all shipments from Tropical with the exception of the roller and the flat rack.

Hi Lesley. 
We just finished unloading all shipments from Tropical with the exception of the roller and the flat 
rack. 
The tiki freezer, the new washers and dryers, the solar lights, thatch roofing, the GEI silt barriers 
and the gym doors and windows are on LSJ.

Good morning. 
I just got off the phone with Shay about contacting Stanley who 
owns the big barge, Global Marine. She has, in the recent past been 
able to 
onn on Saturday mornings. 
His #i 
but rarely, if ever, answers. Shay has the 
benefit of knowing where he lives and also being on St John.

Since it appears our barge won't be ready until after June 12 we 
need to see if we can use Global Marine barge again. Who can I 
contact to ask about this? I know Shay Roberts helped. Do I ask 
her? Or who is Stanley? May I co tact him? Would need his 
details. Thx.
