Hi Andrew and Anthony, 
Thank you very much for your coordination in 
addressing the heating issue. 
Could you please kindly update us from yesterday what exactly is the issue 
with the heating system in my apartment? 
As of this morning, it still barely works. Cesar was at my apartment on 
Sunday and said that there is a need for additional 
lattice installation to let the heat to come through, is 
that correct?
