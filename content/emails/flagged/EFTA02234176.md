| **Subject** | [EXTERNAL] Re: Injectable medication Hi Kristine. Thank you so much for this. Let me find out from Jeffrey if he has lab work that includes cholesterol within past 30 days. I don't think he does but he has gone without me knowing before A. I'll call the number below to set up training. Have a good evening.

Before we get started with the process, I need a copy of Mr. Epstein's recent labs including cholesterol with in the past 30 days. Please let me know if he does not have one so I can send an rx to get it done. We will try to get approval for his medication to avoid paying out of pocket and the company is willing to provide samples while working on his approval. Please call 1-844-REPATHA to set up a training session and also $5 copay card if medication approved. Please let me know if you have any questions. Thank you Kristine EFTA_R1_00992534 EFTA02234176 |

Hi Kristine. Thank you so much for this. Let me find out from Jeffrey if he has lab work 
that includes cholesterol within past 30 days. I don't think he does but he has gone 
without me knowing before A. I'll call the number below to set up training. Have a 
good evening. Lesley
