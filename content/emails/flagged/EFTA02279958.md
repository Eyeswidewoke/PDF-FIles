Lesley, could you please email me copies of new passport, old passport and a valid Russian visa? 
Usually the Russia authorities do not transfer visas but rather require to apply for a new visa but we 
can inquire as they made a few exceptions in the past. It will also depend which consulate has issued 
the 2018 visa.
