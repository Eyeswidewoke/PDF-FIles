Hey Lesley -
Unfortunately, you are not able to swap out the SIM card, because there is not a physical SIM

HI Martin...I received the below just this morning...we are trying to figure 
out our next steps. I thought we had a French CC, but 
we do not. Will come back to you. We may just buy 
from you and ship to the receiver. They can still use the 
watch, correct? Just not as a cell phone due to different 
carriers.
