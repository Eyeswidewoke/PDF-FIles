Hi Valdas...I am 
just waiting to hear 
back from 
Jeffrey...I think this 
should be perfect, 
but don't buy your 
ticket yet...I want 
his approval! So 
you have his 
address: 
The address is 22 
avenue Foch 75116 
Paris . The first 
door code is 2512 . 
Then the second 
door you have to 
ring on 2DD 
thanks,
