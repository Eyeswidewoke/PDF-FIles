As a reminder, Governor Richardson asked for Jeffrey's support to his 
Center for Global Engagement. 
Since we last communicated, we helped bring Otto Warmbier back 
from North Korea 
(https://www.vox.com/world/2017/7/3/15 
893426/negotiator-north-korea-mickey-
bergman-otto-warmbier-richarclson-
center); started a robust collaboration 
(first of it's kind) with the FBI Hostage 
Recovery Fusion Cell (FBI, State and 
Defense Department), where we bring out-
of-government assets to help solve cases 
(former CIA Directors, former diplomats 
and business leaders); and have been 
conducting back channel contacts 
between Pyongyang and the White House 
(National Security Advisor McMaster and 
WH Chief of Staff Kelly).

When we communicated earlier in the year Jefferey indicated he will 
support the Center, and asked that we 
reach out in November to follow up. 
I am happy to come up to see you, or mail you some additional 
information, if needed. 
Thank you so much
