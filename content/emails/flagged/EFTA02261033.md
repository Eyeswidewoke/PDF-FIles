| **Subject** | Jeffrey Epstein Good morning Ms. Groff, There is a way Mr. Epstein can look at his lab results, but he would have to sign up to the system and set up an account. If he does not have a Weill Cornell Connect Account yet, I encourage Mr. Epstein to sign up for one as this is a secure electronic messaging system. It is a faster and more reliable way to communicate with your physician, nurse and our office along with requesting refills, appointments, and obtaining your results. I can send the code for Mr. Epstein to sign up. I will also check to see if it is ok to fax them as we usually we will need a letter from Mr. Epstein requesting the lab results and it is to include his name, date of birth, the labs he is requesting and include the information of where he needs those labs sent and then his signature. When is Mr. Epstein available to go over the lab results? Please let me know Thank you Jessica, please note The information contained in this communication is confidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may EFTA_R1_01058530 EFTA02261033 constitute inside information, and is intended only for the use of the addressee.

Good morning Ms. Groff, 
There is a way Mr. Epstein can look at his lab results, but he would have to sign up to the 
system and set up an account. If he does not have a Weill Cornell Connect 
Account yet, I encourage Mr. Epstein to sign up for one as this is a secure 
electronic messaging system. It is a faster and more reliable way to communicate 
with your physician, nurse and our office along with requesting refills, 
appointments, and obtaining your results. I can send the code for Mr. Epstein to 
sign up. 
I will also check to see if it is ok to fax them as we usually we will need a letter from Mr. 
Epstein requesting the lab results and it is to include his name, date of birth, the 
labs he is requesting and include the information of where he needs those labs sent 
and then his signature. 
When is Mr. Epstein available to go over the lab results? 
Please let me know 
Thank you
