Re: Jeffrey Epstein 
Hello Lesley! 
I would like to ask if its possible to meet with Jeffrey in the upcoming days? 
On a separate note, I've cc'ed my personal e-mail, my Columbia e-mail 
automatically forwards all my mail to that address, so it would be convenient for 
me to use the personal one as a primary. 
Hope you are doing well! Thank you! 
Regards, 
Maxim
