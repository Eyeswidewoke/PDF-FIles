Les can you look into options that are on the later side on the 10th, like as close to 
midnight as possible ;) departure and arrival airports not of great concern to me. 
J knows that I am looking into accommodation, but you do what you have to regarding 
letting him know / following up. You can say I told you I am doing it and that I 
would collect options if you need to. I think that it's easier this way because I 
know the transport links to my sister who is just south of the city. So I am looking 
central / south west like Chelsea, South Kensington etc. Close to Victoria station 
which has a direct train to Gatwick and to my sister. 
Thank you so much for your patience and help 000000
