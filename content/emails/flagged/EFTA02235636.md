| **Subject** | LSO investment opportunity EFTA_R1_00998418 EFTA02235636 To Partners: We now seemed well positioned to prosper in 2018. With that, we are looking to complete our final overhang on Jadestone Energy next week. The deal will be back stopped by Jadestone's largest holder(S2B hedge fund Tyrus Capital) and we expect mgmt to take part. The value is so compelling. so I'm very confident we will see a re-rate. I am offering any current LP's the chance to invest further in the fund. Monies would be required next week to take part. My view on JSE's upside is, once this overhang is finally lifted, and based on forward cash flows and free cash flows, the opportunity is great(30perc FCF yield today). So I suspect we will witness a nice move once completed. And even more for those that add. Always looking to provide insight and value to you all. This remains my most compelling investment for us. It will further prove out in the next few years and along with a strong valuation. Let me know if interested. Again, it's a total of $4mm of equity. Fully back stopped. We will be limited on our involved but trying to gain more expose to the block. This legacy seller was 90perc of the stocks selling volume in 2017. Which is amazing enough. At current values, and massive leverage to Brent, Jadestone has a run rate of $30+mm of cash flows and free cash flow and zero net debt(S80mm EV). The company just hedge some of their 2018 production at 64+. Additionally, and per the company's previous press release, they have engaged bankers BMO and Stifel for a listing move to London. All best, David EFTA_R1_00996417 EFTA02235637 |
