| **Subject** | Update on TED Hotel Rooms The Hotels being used by TED are the Pacific Rim, the Waterfront, the Four Seasons, the Pan Pacific and the Rosewood hotel. I am told the Pacific Rim is the most popular by TED attendees, but the hotel has zero availability (rooms are either booked or blocked by TED) The Pacific Rim and Waterfront meeting spaces are completely booked as well...FYI, the TED talks will be held at the Vancouver Convention Centre. I have made you reservations for a suite and second best room available at the Rosewood and Four Seasons for April 11-13 (TED dates are April 10-14, but per your email, booked April 11- 13). Cancellation for both hotels is 24 hours prior to arrival. We are still trying to determine availability of a meeting room with the catering departments of Rosewood and Four Seasons.
