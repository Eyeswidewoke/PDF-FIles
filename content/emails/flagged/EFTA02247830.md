did...I just looked on the website and it 
appears they only reimburse you for 
`necessity purchases'... You should call 
XL Airways and speak to are resentative 
in the baggage department 
...I would hope they would 
compensate for what was lost!? I do 
think airlines normally DO find luggage 
and get to proper owner...did you have a 
name tag on your luggage?
