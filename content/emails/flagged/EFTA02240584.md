Were you a paramedic before you moved or is this a new career path you are 
interested in? My only suggestion is to check some on

which looks good fix the US...

I am trying to find what they have in Hungary (I live now there, 
changed my job), but only paramedics with 
previous experience at the moment. 
Currently also working as an assistant for 
one woman. I am amazed how you handle so

Dear Lesley, 
Hope you are doing good and everything is going as 
planned and 
wonderful! :) I 
talked to Jeffrey 
and he said that I 
could get some 
EFTA_R1_01011852 
EFTA02240586

materials from 
some of his 
assistants that have 
studied the 
paramedic courses, 
maybe you have 
any? Maybe you 
know where they 
usually do these 
trainings because in 
EU they usually ask 
previous experience 
in medicine. 
Would really appreciate that! Thank you :)) Also any other 
of your suggestions 
of what could be 
useful to learn I 
would really 
appreciate since 
you know Jeffrey 
the best. He gave 
me some tips, but
