Jared was surprised with my visit also cause he said someone had just been there last Friday and spoke with Tammy. Once we realized Jared would not be back to the office for hours I spoke to him directly on the phone. I let him know it is time for us to get a refund because we need our generators. He never offered a date of when we would receive his generators he just conceded and said "ok" to getting our money back, but he must speak to Tammy about the books. Jared confirmed he is the owner and makes the decisions. Sent from my iPhone EFTA_R1_01028855 EFTA02248221 |
