HI 
...unfortunatley Jeffrey says you cannot catch a flight from Miami until after 
2pm...the only direct flight after 2pm from Miami to San Francisco is this 6:11pm flight. Even 
if you did a connecting flight around 2pm from Miami you would still probably arrive around 
the same time. I'd rather take a direct flight!

Hi Lesley! How are you? 
Is there a possibility to be in SF earlier than 12pm?
