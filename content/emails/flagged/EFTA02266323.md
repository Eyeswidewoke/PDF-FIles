Hello and thank you for your response Vanessa. We were told 
we must have a French Credit 
Card to place the order...is this 
true? I had decided I would 
send an employee of ours to the 
Paris Apple store to place the 
order for the 3 remaining 
watches (2 for Paris recipients 
and 1 for Moscow recipient) 
once she returns to Paris from 
her travels. She has a French 
credit card of her own. If we 
can use a US credit card, do let
