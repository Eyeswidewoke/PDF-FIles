| **To** | Hello Dr. Chen mentioned to me that Mr. Epstein will be referring a VIP patient to him? I will need their contact information so that I can have them scheduled. Also, is the patient International with International insurance or will they be self-pay? If the patient is international then the appointment will need to go through our International Services Department here at Columbia and they will organize everything. Thanks!

Hello 
Dr. Chen mentioned to me that Mr. Epstein will be referring a VIP patient 
to him? I will need their contact information so that I can have them 
scheduled. Also, is the patient International with International insurance or 
will they be self-pay? If the patient is international then the appointment 
will need to go through our International Services Department here at 
Columbia and they will organize everything. Thanks!
