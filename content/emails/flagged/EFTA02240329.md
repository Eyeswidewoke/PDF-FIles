will no longer go on the trip this weekend...just her 17 year old son, 
will go! 
will meet Jeffrey at the house at 8:30am then they will 
head immediately to Teterboro...so I think my original thought of wheels up at 
9:30am works!...I don't know which assistant will go with Jeffrey as of yet...I asked 
him , but did not hear back...
