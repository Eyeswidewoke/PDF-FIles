I would still need to check with Jeffrey it is ok on his end...

However, I can also be available in two weeks on the 28th to the 30 whether there could be more room into planes. I will have document to give to Jeffrey so I hope he will be there too. Kevin. Le 14 juin 2017 I 15:19 a ecrit Hi Kevin... Unfortunately, there are no direct flights. A lot of flights are sold out, so earliest I can offer you to come to STT will be 7pm: TJ 105 21JUN SBH SJU 255P 402P 9K8331 21JUN SJU STT 624P 700P BB3529 23JUN STT SRI 305P 340P TJ 106 23JUN SJU SBH 445P 551P If this is not enough time for you we can look at a flight on 24th. Availability on the 24 is very limited as well: 9K 8141 STT SJU 1015A 1051A TJ 114 SJU SBH 130P 236P What do you think is best?
