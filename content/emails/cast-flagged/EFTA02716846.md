DEAR FRIEND 
Who Stole the American Dream? 
The promise =f a prosperous middle-class life with decent work, rising living standards, and the potential for a better 
future has lo=g been the foundation of the American dream. And it has been the political, legislative, and corporate 
choices that have pushed the middle class to the brink of disaster. As America continues to struggle to recover from the 
Great Recession, it has become clear that the middle class is in jeopardy -- and many of the polici=s of the last 40 years 
are to blame. In his new book, Who Stole the American Dream? —.C24> Pulitzer Prize- and Emmy Award-winning 
journalist, producer, and bestselling author, Hedrick Smith analyzes how "pro-business=quot; policies dismantled the 
previous American social contract and tells the stories of the people who have been left behi=d. To reclaim the promise 
of a thriving middle class, Mr. Smith proposes a "domestic Marshall Plan" based on infrastructure investment, a program 
to sp=r the revival of manufacturing, corporate tax reform, and renewed support of =ur key social insurance programs.

From 20=9 to 2012 The Top 1% captured 95% of the increase of national income. In other words The Top 1% 
incomes grew by 31.4% while The Bottom 99% incomes grew by 0.4%. 
In his book, Smith says that the Congress of 1978 was the watershed, first by the passing of the 401K legislation, as a 
favor for the executives of Kodak and Xerox because they wanted a new tax shelter for deferred compensation. And 
that it was never intended to be a retirement plan for the mass of Americans.40=A0 And the other major sea change was 
the change of culture in business. Prior to then there were a number of populist movements on the 1960s and 1970s 
representing the sentiments of the middle-class that were co-opted by lobbyist in Washington=on behalf of business 
interest. In 1970 there were 170 businesses in America that had lobbying offices in Washingto=. A decade later there 
were 2025. In 1971 there was no Business Roundtable which today is the most potent political f=rce for Blue Chip 
Businesses in America. By the 95th Congress in 1978 there were 130 registered lobbyist for every memb=r of Congress. 
Corporate lobbyist shifted power away from the populist movements in favor or corporate interest using=Wedge-
Economics. 
=p class="MsoNormal">During this same period the notion of stakeholder cap=talism changed to shareholder 
capitalism. The stakeholder capital notion was, if y=u took care of your workers and paid them well, this not only 
benefited the workers and corporation it benefited the whole economy, which economist lab=led the Virtuous Circle of 
Growth. The essence is that well-paid workers would spend creating consumer demand and = strong economy with 
businesses expanding production, building new plants, buying n=w equipment, hiring more workers to meet increasing 
demand and power the next cycle of growth. 
And this is essentially what happened through the 40s, 50=, 60s, and 70s. This changed with the change in business 
ethos "we=are going to cut back to increase profits." The productivity of American workers rose 97% for the mid-40s 
though the mid-70s and their incomes rose =5%. After that one continued to rise while the other went flat. And the one 
that went flat was the wages and salaries of workers since 1973 while productivity continue to grow to 80% by 2011. 
During this period the average hourly wage grew only 4.2% and corporate profits ri=ing on average by 13% a year, 
resulting with the Middle Class being cut out of =he growth and profitability of American Enterprise. This was the result 
of Wedge-Economics. 
And if this was not enough, there was The Great Burden Shi=t. In 1980 84% of workers in companies of more than 100 
employees had a life-time pension. When they retired their employe= guaranteed them a monthly paycheck as long as 
they lived. Today that =umber is 35%. In 1980 more than 70% of workers in companies of more than 100 employees 
had fully paid health benefits. Today that numbe= if 18%. In 1980 corporations paid 89% of health cost of employees by 
2010 that number had dropped to 49% and the percent th=t employees were paying rose for 11% to 51%. This is The 
Burden Shift. Hundreds of billions of dolla=s a year in costs have been shifted from the corporations to employees at a 
time when w=ges have been flat. The U.S. Census Bureau said that the median wage adjusted for inflation for a male 
worker is lower=today than it was in 1978, while inflation has gone up and cost are going up. Thi= shift has devastated 
the Middle Class as they now have to use more of their incomes to cover these benefits that are no longer being covered 
by corporations. And with less disposable income the economy has stagnated economically.

As for retirees the 401k pl=ns have been a horror. First of all, because the risk has been shifted from companies to the 
employees who for the most part are ill-equip=to manage them, leaving it to Mutual Funds that mostly float with the 
tide.40=A0 But more importantly, is that the average 401k plan only has $18,000 and $85,000 at the time when most 
people retire. This is not nearly enough because one needs at least ten to twelve times their salary as we are now living 
longer. As a result economists say that 45% to 50% of Baby Boomers do not have enough sock away in their 401k plans 
along with Social Security to cover their basic economic needs when t=ey retire. This spells poverty and poverty on a 
mass scale. Think about it roughly half or the Baby Boomers might end up living in poverty. And this is =argely because 
of The Burden Shift. 
Pay For Performance is probably the most egregious practice in business as it is a totally a rigged game in favor of the 
management =E2.4, who often manipulate the numbers and dates to enrich themselves. And one of the=most 
egregious companies abusing this practice was Apple, who under Steve Jobs admitted to falsifyin= more than 4000 cases 
where they falsely changed dates and documents to enable se=ior executives to enrich themselves. In the old days one 
would have considered =his insider trading, as executives not only do things for short-term benefit, i= is a common 
practice to make decisions that gooses the stock price prior to compensation review. Case in point: the top five 
executives of =ear Stearns and Lehman Brothers received more than $2 billion is stock options and cash compensati=n in 
the last two years including settlements when their companies collapsed:40=AD There was no stockholder value yet ten 
executives received $2 billion in compensation. Think about it if this had happen in China these guys would have gone 
to jail and their ill-gotten gains confiscated. 
Yet as bad as the aforementioned ha= been to squeeze the Middle Class, they don't come close to rivaling the housing 
bubble =nd bust which did more to devastate the Middle Class than any other development in American as millions of 
Americans were enticed to tale equity out of their houses to maintain their living standards. There has been a massive 
transfer of wealth from the middle class to the elite of the past 30 years and the most striking element of that is the $6 
=rillion lost by the Middle Class during the housing bubble. Prior to the hous=ng bubble roughly 70% of the assets of the 
housing stock was owned by the homeowner and the other re=aining 30% owed by banks. By 2009 that figure had 
dropped to 40%. Homeowners lost 30% of the value of a $20 trillion housing markets. This was an enormous =rosion of 
Middle Class wealth. Championed by Allan Greenspan, this Equity Stripping pumped $750 billion yearly into the 
economy but it devasta=ed the Middle Class. 
The groundwork for these=things to happen began in the 95th Congress in 1978. Because in 1978 Congress passed a 
federal law that over-ruled all of the states usury laws,=enabling banks and other financial institutions to charge 15%, 
18% and more on peopl= who can least afford it and they know are bad risk. This led to adjus=able mortgages, 100% 
financing, negative amortization enabling borrows to go further into debt every month. And the latest Payday Loans...

Let's remember, it is consumer demand tha= drives the American economy. So when we are being told that we need to 
protect the tax rates of the Super Elite because they are the this is not true. The job creators is actually the Middle Class 
as consumers. And the reaso= why we are having such a terrible time getting out of this long slow jobless recovery is 
because we =ave a weaker and weaker consumer demand which is why as Head of the Federal Res=rve Allan Greenspan 
championed policies that pumped hundreds of billions into t=e economy to sustain a false consumer demand bubble 
that eventually hurt tens=of millions of American families. As a result we as a country have almost no chance in hell to 
dig ourselves in th= mess that we are in until we understand the real problems that we have toda=. The public debate 
that we are having today is removed from reality because we are not talking about the real issues that =re hurting the 
Middle Class. And the only way that we will be able to is fo
