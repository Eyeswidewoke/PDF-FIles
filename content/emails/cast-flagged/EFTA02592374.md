together=/span> in a big way and at the same time share decisions and administratio= , while allowing increased tax 
deductibilty- flexibility =AO A donor advised structure will remove most of the record keeping =esponsibility from the 
family while keeping both the patriarch and the chi=dren in an advisory role for as long as they like. 
=div> Its exciting and you have decided to share your experts. and exp=rience with those that are now really having to 
deal with the burden of Wh=t to do with my wealth.

2. I still think private breakfasts are the way to go =/div> 
3/ I am in the Caribbean but could fly to Boston on Thurs =f you thought productive or if you would like to meet the 
cutting edge of =arvard, MIT . math evolution including cancer fighting game theoretical ap=roaches. George Church 
would be fun for you one on one. anti a=ing, . genetic fabrication.
