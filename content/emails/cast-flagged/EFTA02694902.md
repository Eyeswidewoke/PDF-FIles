Dear Jeffrey, 
I would like to thank you for your generous support of IFP with your contribution of 
$7,000 USD, to be used toward our annual program. the Gotham Independent Film 
AwardsTM. The success of the organization. our programs, and the filmmakers upon 
which we provide support and mentorship would not be possible without kind and 
generous donations such as this. 
After debuting with a program in the 1979 New York Film Festival, the nonprofit IFP has 
evolved into the nation's oldest and largest organization of independent filmmakers, and 
also the premier advocate for them. Since its start, IFP has supported the production of 
7.000 films and provided resources to more than 20,000 filmmakers' voices that 
otherwise might not have been heard. IFP believes that independent films broaden the 
palette of cinema, seeding the global culture with new ideas, kindling awareness, and 
fostering activism. 
Currently, IFP represents a network of 10,000 filmmakers in New York City and around 
the world. Through its workshops, seminars, conferences, mentorships, and Filmmaker 
magazine, IFP schools its members in the art, technology, and business of independent 
filmmaking (there are special programs to promote racial, ethnic, religious, ideological, 
gender, and sexual diversity). IFP builds audiences by hosting screenings, often in 
collaboration with other cultural institutions-and also bestows the Gotham Awardsmi, 
the first honors of the film awards season. When all is said and done, IFP fosters the 
development of 350 feature and documentary films each year. 
Our programs provide filmmakers with access to the tools to develop and present 
their vision, and audiences with the opportunity to discover new work. Our 
signature programs include the Gotham Independent Film AwardsTM, Independent 
Film Week, Filmmaker Magazine, Envision, and IFP's Independent Filmmaker Labs. The 
success of these programs would not be possible without the generous support from 
individuals like you. 
IFP is designated by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) as a tax-exempt organization 
as defined by section 501(c)3 of the IRS code. Therefore, your contribution of 
$7,000 is tax deductible. IFP's Federal Tax Identification number is 13-3118525. 
Please keep this letter as a receipt for tax purposes, and contact your financial 
advisor for proper consultation. 
With warmest regards and sincere thanks, 
Steven Pfeiffer 
IFP Development Manager
