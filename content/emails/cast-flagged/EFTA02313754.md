| **Subject** | =The Bin Hi Karyna I saw your e mail last night and like you I am v=ry disappointed - you are the perfect buyer for this amazing property. Please let me assure y=u Marc has been doing everything possible to get things moving on the sale a=d in the past few days you have received the due diligence, the contr=ct as well as the bankers details and they have spoken so I feel we are alm=st there - the only outstanding document is a letter from your bank showing=were the funds are coming from which will be for money laundering purposes.=/div> The honest truth i= the current owner is very difficult and old and thinks he is about to die a=d is trying to get all his affairs in order.... hence the dramatic reductio= in price and tight time frame... Since the recent price reduction there have been a number o= offers from all over the world including some higher and some lower than y=urs but honestly the seller just wants it sold now and he is not acting rat=onally... however we are doing our best to make sure he sticks with your of=er as we believe you to be the best buyers. I honestly believe if you move ahead you'll=be the owner of this incredible home withiin a month but please try to do i= as quickly as you can (whilst of course doing the due diligence and survey=) I was thinking we could try to get the surveyor to come earlier? As you say it should=be an easy transaction and I really hope you don't throw in the tow=l now when we are so close. I will try to call you later but wanted to also put my thoughts in=writing.
