Tess told me that she will come on Friday, so she will have to call Rail to disarm. Thanks for the appletv - it seems much better, though we haven't yet got all the channels and possibilities. When we come again I will have to get James explain. There is also a problem with the chains of the window shields. It will also wait next time.
