Talking of pics for the wall, in his list of things to do, he mentioned 2 pictures for the temporary office, one above the printer and one above the shelves in between the 2 doors (next to the one door we walk in). Also he would like a rug for the floor. Should we try organise this week? On Mon, Dec 13, 2010 at 9:12 AM, <mailto » wrote: «mailto Is he referring to large photos to hang on the walls?
