Maybe there are miracles, but I think=more prosaic approaches yield rich results in domains like vision (Marr

Marr,
Marr,-try, probabilty, , symmetry. ent=opy. it might look like computation but it is not. it mi=ht look like

it does. it is not an input system, there is not mechanism drivni=g the heads and tails towards equal numbers. , there is 
not nature looking=to see what the previous results were and computing the next result. like =our ug it is more of a 
miracle.

I wouldn't take the term =80 mechanism" too literally. It refers to whatever is taki=g place in the brain. 
For some, as most of those in the Nowak group, it means neural nets. =For Gallistel, it's processes internal to the cell. 
Useful t= look at these matters in terms of Mares three levels: computatio=, algorithm, mechanism.

Not a trivial matter. I'm not the=best person to ask. I'd suggest contacting people 
who =99ve really thought seriously about these issues, like Robert Pollin, a fi=e independent economist at U Mass 
Amherst 
2.=C2 
Sherman's speculation is an interesting exten=ion of recent discoveries about 
conservation, deep homologies, regulatory =ircuits, and other elements of what's sometimes called "the evo-devo 
revolution." It remains to be seen whether a=ything can be done with it. I think you underestimate the contributi=ns of 
Berwick and his students, including Yang. 
3.=C2 
The idea that there is a "ug" for vis=on, language, etc., seems to be essentially what 
Randy Gallistel calls =80 the norm in neuroscience," quoted in the paper on modularity =hat I sent you. And yes, they're

certainly connected, at least a= the level of cells, and presumably well beyond. These are live and =ignificant research 
areas. These "central modules" d= not have input or output, but they are accessed by input systems and in some cases, 
like language, by output systems. That seems a fair p=cture of the rough cognitive architecture. I don't follow th= rest. 
It's true that work on human language uses as evidenc= what is available, namely performance. And much of the work 
unfortunately is fascinated by the droppings, just as in other fields. =AO But there is some work that seeks to discover 
the mechanisms, as discus=ed in the papers I sent you.

It's true that grammars stand=outside of time, a fact that many linguists and

1. dont you have any =uestions about money, . ? ? finance.. =? I owe you some 
knowledge. 
2 .to say the shape c=n be" decribed " by language is redundant. =A0 
the "shape"=is the metaphor for an n•dimentional object, it stands outside of t=me. as 
do grammars, but sentences do not, they require time. = the shape is somewhat like a fitness landscape? contrasted 
with communication which also requires = time dimension and biololgy that needs and uses energy . =AO I suggest 
the mammal Ug is a subcategory of all UG.s = and that as biology prefers redundancy . the other modules, ie vision =A0 
are small distortions of it.

yang is flexible in his use of the term probability.=. for example he in a number 
of papers refers to zipf as a probabiltiy dis=ribution. i have checked a number of his papers after your last remark, I 
think it is a mistake. he m=ans that after empirical measurement . for ex word frequency,=C2 . if ten times out of 100 
the corpus has the word x. =AO then he describes the probablility of finding the word as 10 perc=nt . this is not

m=dels.
