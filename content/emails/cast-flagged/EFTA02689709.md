Turkish Populism Goes to the Polls - The 
Limits of the Country's Regional Resurgence 
Piotr Zalewski 
June 10, 2011 -- On Sunday, Turkey will head to the polls in 
parliamentary elections. Although issues such as the economy, a new 
constitution, and the conflict in the Kurdish-majority southeast have 
featured most prominently in the campaigning, Turkey's foreign 
policy has emerged as a central rallying point for the Justice and 
Development Party (AKP). But the populist streak that has given a 
boost to the party's support over the past years has also had 
consequences for relations with longtime allies. In distancing itself 
from the United States, the European Union, and Israel, the Turkish 
government has done considerable damage to its relations with the 
West. This may be changing, however: Amid the political turmoil 
sweeping the Middle East, there are signs that the populist and anti-
Western strand in Turkey's foreign policy may have run its course. 
Once election season is over, Turkey is likely to rediscover the 
importance of engaging with the United States and the European 
Union. Well into the 1990s, Turkey did not really have a foreign 
policy. Instead, it had an orientation, or what analysts have in mind 
when they speak of "Turkey's turn from the West" or "Turkey's shift 
eastward." With the country's powerful military running the show, the 
lines were fixed. Turkey was a stalwart NATO ally, a Western 
outpost, a country happily divorced from its Ottoman past and, by 
extension, from the entire Arab world. It was also a country removed 
from its citizens. Aside from cases when public opinion had to be 
mobilized -- renewed fighting in Cyprus, say, or tensions with Greece --

foreign policy was rarely up for open discussion. Over the past 
decade, however, the government of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip 
Erdogan has considerably trimmed the military's influence over 
political life, foreign policy included. To meet EU accession criteria, 
Erdogan's AKP stripped the army of its majority on the National 
Security Council, for years the most important body in charge of 
foreign policy. Building on the work of its predecessors, the AKP 
government replaced a foreign policy based on security with one 
focused on engagement, soft power, and trade, in the process 
diffusing tensions with neighboring countries such as Iran, Iraq, and 
Syria (known as the "zero problems" policy). Other changes have 
come from the bottom up. As the domestic political arena expanded 
and democratization took root -- thanks in no small part to the EU 
accession process -- the media, business interests, NGOs, religious 
groups, and other parts of civil society have taken on a much more 
visible stand on issues that had traditionally been the remit of state 
elites and the military establishment. Civil society groups, for 
example, pushed aside traditional concerns of national security to 
pave the way for Turkey's reconciliation with Greece in the late 1990s 
and helped shift the domestic debate on Greek Cyprus in 2003 and 
2004. Never before in Turkey's modern history has foreign policy 
been so directly wedded to domestic politics: The architects of 
Turkey's foreign policy used to answer to the generals; these days, 
policymakers answer to the public. And never before has a Turkish 
government staked so much of its reputation on its international 
accomplishments, real or hypothetical. On the campaign trail, the 
AKP's senior members have consistently championed the party's 
foreign outlook. At a speech in April, Foreign Minister Ahmet 
Davutoglu said, "Our ideal is to make this country a pioneer in the 
world, like our predecessors who carried out their goal of order for 
the whole world." Erdogan has made similarly proud and sweeping

rhetorical gestures, telling supporters last month that "those who want 
democracy, those who want freedom, those who want to be rid of 
tyranny, oppression, and exploitation, now look to Turkey." A few 
days later, he added, "Now it is Turkey that sets the agenda. It's 
Turkey's word that everyone awaits." The AKP, expected to win 
Sunday's vote by a landslide, has reason to trumpet its foreign policy 
accomplishments. Under the "zero problems" policy, Turkey's 
relations with its Middle Eastern neighbors are better than at any time 
since the founding of the republic. Regional trade is booming: 
Turkey's exports to the Middle East more than doubled between 2002 
and 2010 as a share of total exports, now reaching 20 percent. (The 
share of exports to Europe has dropped over the same period by 
about 10 percentage points, to about 45 percent.) Turkish diplomats, 
meanwhile, have taken on a more active role in the region. Some 
Turkish initiatives have been successful (the effort to free four New 
York Times journalists captured in Libya); some were said to have 
almost succeeded (the 2008 talks between Syria and Israel); some 
have been dismissed by allies (including the proposed nuclear swap 
deal with Iran in 2011); and some have been stillborn (a road map for 
Libya that failed to call for Muammar al-Qaddafi's departure). But all 
have been universally seen as evidence of Turkey's growing clout and 
ambitions.As Ziya On4, a professor at Koc University, told me, the 
government "has used its assertive foreign policy and its popularity in 
the Arab world" to build popular support. Indeed, 65 percent of those 
Turks responding to a recent poll by the Turkish think tank TESEV 
back the AKP's foreign policy; around 80 percent of those surveyed 
said that they believe that Turkey can be a model -- cultural, political, 
and economic -- for the countries of the Middle East.Yet the 
populism inherent in the AKP's foreign policy has a hidden danger: 
Fuelling anti-Western and anti-Israeli sentiment may win Erdogan a 
few nationalist or Islamist votes, but it is also costing him some

valuable friends, from European politicians to the U.S. congressional 
representatives. The infamous showdown between Erdogan and 
Israeli President Shimon Peres at the 2009 World Economic Forum 
in Davos is a case in point. Erdogan accused Peres of "knowing well 
how to kill," and then stormed off the stage and boarded a plane to 
Istanbul. He returned to a hero's welcome. The highly publicized spat 
earned the AKP a badly needed boost ahead of local elections in 
March 2009. Erdogan's anti-Israeli rants reached new heights last 
May, when Israeli troops stormed the Mavi Marmara, a Turkish ship 
carrying aid to Gaza, and killed eight Turkish activists and one U.S. 
citizen of Turkish origin. The West's initial sympathy for Turkey 
quickly melted away when Erdogan accused Israeli of "state terror," 
refused to label Hamas a terrorist organization, and claimed that the 
world "now perceived the swastika and the Star of David together." 
The anti-Israeli rhetoric has certainly damaged Turkey's profile in 
Washington. In March 2010, Robert Wexler, the former chairman of 
Congress' Turkey caucus, noted that Erdogan's "outlandish" and 
"bizarre" comments on Israel were doing the Turkish government "far 
greater discredit in America than you can imagine." Over the 
following months, especially in the wake of Turkey's response to the 
Mavi Marmara incident, a number of U.S. congressmen withdrew 
their support for Ankara on important policy issues. For example, 
Anthony Weiner (D-N.Y.) argued that Turkey's membership in 
NATO should be "called into question," while Shelley Berkley (D-
Nev.), threatened to speak "actively" against Turkey's bid to join the 
European Union.In late May, on the eve of the coming elections and 
just before the first anniversary of the storming of the Mavi Marmara, 
Davutoglu dismissed pleas by the United Nations and others to 
prevent a new flotilla from departing for Gaza. (Fifteen ships, 
including the Mavi Marmara, are planning to do so in late June.) 
Instead, he warned that Turkey would give the "necessary response"

to any "act of provocation" by Israel. Erdogan, meanwhile, has 
accused his main opponent, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, the head of the 
Republican People's Party, of being insufficiently tough on Israel. 
Kilicdaroglu had criticized Erdogan's government for letting the 2010 
flotilla go ahead and putting Turkish lives in harm's way. If 
Kilicdaroglu were brave enough, said Erdogan, he would "criticize 
the Mediterranean pirates instead of being a sycophant." 
(Kilicdaroglu has replied in kind, criticizing Erdogan for accepting a 
prize from a U.S.-based Jewish group.) Europe has also been the 
target of much criticism this campaign season. With support for 
joining the European Union among Turks plummeting from 71 
percent in 2004 to 47 percent last year, according to a Eurobarometer 
poll, there are few votes to be won by campaigning in favor of EU 
accession. The AKP has only aggravated the situation with combative 
rhetoric. As much as it has done to advance EU reforms, and as much 
it may still affirm its commitment to working toward membership, the 
AKP has made a habit of accusing the European Union of double 
standards, suggesting that all European opposition to Turkish 
accession is a s
