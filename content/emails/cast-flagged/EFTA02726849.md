VIDEOGRAPHER: Going back on the record.

BY MR. EDWARDS: 
5 
Q. 
Sir, before we move on to the next topic, 
6 
I want to make sure that we have finished the 
7 
previous topic. 
8 
Is there anyone else who gave you 
9 
information about Paul Cassell who you can identify 
10 
at this time and did not otherwise this morning 
11 
identify? 
12 
A. 
Yes. So, immediately upon hearing of the 
13 
false accusation against me, I recall now that I 
14 
Googled Paul Cassell and discovered that he was 
15 
called a zealot at least three times on easily 
16 
accessible published materials. 
17 
So, the term "zealot" in addition to 
18 
coming from individuals -- and you can get them on 
19 
Google as easily as I can --
20 
MR. SCAROLA: The question was, was there 
21 
anyone else. 
22 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
23 
Q. 
I'm asking is there a person's name? 
24 
A. 
These people wrote articles. They have 
25 
names. 
www.phippsreporting.com 
(888)811-3408 
EFTA02726853

787 
1 
Q. 
What are their names? 
2 
A. 
I don't recall them. You can get them. 
3 
You can just Google "Paul Cassell" and you will find 
4 
names of people who call him a zealot. 
5 
Q. 
I think maybe my question wasn't clear, so 
6 
I'm going to make it crystal clear. 
7 
A. 
Yes. 
8 
Q. 
Have you remembered the name of any 
9 
individual who you did not identify by name or 
10 
description this morning that provided you 
11 
personally with information about Paul Cassell? 
12 
A. 
A man named Hobbs, H-O-B-B-S. 
13 
Q. 
Is that a first or last name? 
14 
A. 
That's a last name. And he -- my 
15 
recollection is -- I don't know if he testified 
16 
against Paul Cassell or he just wrote an article, 
17 
but he wrote an article calling him a dangerous 
18 
zealot. 
19 
Q. 
Did you speak with Hobbs? 
20 
A. 
I don't recall if I spoke to him, but I do 
21 
recall reading his article or reading excerpts at 
22 
least from the article. 
23 
And then I remember reading another 
24 
article, may have been on Slate or -- there are a 
25 
number of articles calling Paul Cassell a zealot.

1 
So the name just didn't pop into my head. It was 
2 
something, as I said earlier, that was part of his 
3 
reputation. 
4 
Q. 
Okay. I will break this into two 
5 
questions. One, what information did you have other 
6 
than human interaction that may have included 
7 
articles or other things that you read? 
8 
But before I get to that question, my 
9 
question is, have you recalled the identity of any 
10 
person that you did not tell us about or describe 
11 
earlier this morning that provided you information 
12 
about Paul Cassell? 
13 
A. 
I want to wait for the 
14 
MR. INDYKE: Outside the privilege. 
15 
SPECIAL MASTER POZZUOLI: Excuse me? 
16 
A. 
Not that I can recall at this time. 
17 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
18 
Q. 
Okay. Are there other materials that you 
19 
have not yet disclosed during this deposition that 
20 
you read, that provided you additional bases for 
21 
your opinions about Mr. Cassell? 
22 
A. 
Yes. 
23 
MR. INDYKE: Objection. 
24 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
25 
Q. 
And are these materials that --

(888)811-3408 
EFTA02726855

789 
1 
SPECIAL MASTER POZZUOLI: Hang on one 
2 
second. 
3 
MR. EDWARDS: Outside of the privilege. 
4 
MR. INDYKE: Okay. Sorry. 
5 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
6 
Q. 
Are these materials that have been 
7 
provided already in discovery in this case? 
8 
A. 
I don't know the answer to that. I don't 
9 
know what has been provided and what hasn't. I can 
10 
just tell you that in the course of my career, I had 
11 
read -- I had never met Mr. Cassell, but I had read 
12 
his articles, and they are aptly described as 
13 
zealous. He once -- he was once described as 
14 
somebody who misused -- I think misused or uses 
15 
family values to hide his zealotry. But I was 
16 
familiar with his what are regarded as very extreme 
17 
writings. And that formed part of my opinion about 
18 
his zealotry, yes. 
19 
Q. 
What was the timing of your reading these 
20 
articles that helped to form a part of your opinion 
21 
about Mr. Cassell? 
22 
A. 
Very soon after the allegation was made. 
23 
Not only did I independently read, but people called 
24 
me and alerted me to read this, read that. People 
25 
sent me briefs and asked me to read them.

EFTA02726856

790 
1 
Q. 
So one of the things that you took into 
2 
consideration in assessing the reputation or 
3 
credibility of Paul Cassell were various things that 
4 
he had written or that had been written about him? 
5 
A. 
Yes, and what people had said about him. 
6 
Q. 
Okay. 
7 
A. 
I mean, just to give you an example, if 
8 
you don't mind me just elaborating one second, as I 
9 
was getting lunch today downstairs, three people 
10 
came over to me. One of them said, I can't believe 
11 
those, and then he used the F word, scrupulous --
12 
unscrupulous, unethical lawyers who have done this 
13 
to you, this is horrible, get them, they have to pay 
14 
a price, they ought to be disciplined. 
15 
And I said, do you know me? 
16 
No, but I've been following this story. 
17 
This 
18 
19 
20 
21 
22 
horrible. No decent lawyer would ever do this. 
23 
This happens to me all the time. People 
24 
come over to me all the time and tell me what they 
25 
think of you and Paul Cassell. 
is just unbelievable. 
And then two other people, one of whom 
overheard it, said, I just want to join in on that. 
I don't know you, but I just want you to know that 
the lawyers who did this are beyond -- they're just

EFTA02726857

791 
1 
Q. 
Okay. Where were you eating lunch today? 
2 
A. 
In a Wrap [sic] around restaurant. 
3 
Q. 
Where is it located geographically? 
4 
A. 
Right in the building. In the building. 
5 
Q. 
And are these individuals that spoke to 
6 
you individuals who told you that they know either 
7 
myself or Paul Cassell? 
8 
A. 
I didn't ask that question. It was just 
9 
-- it was quick conversation and one of them said, 
10 
I'll do anything to help. 
11 
Q. 
Okay. What is the identity of the person 
12 
who will do anything to help you? 
13 
A. 
His name is Jeffrey Levy. He is an 
14 
attorney here. 
15 
SPECIAL MASTER POZZUOLI: "Here" meaning 
16 
where? 
17 
A. 
In Fort Lauderdale. He's a family lawyer. 
18 
Just out of the blue, I don't know him from Adam. 
19 
But this happens to me all the time. When I go to 
20 
Miami tomorrow, I'll be walking down Lincoln Road, 
21 
people will come over to me and tell me about you. 
22 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
23 
Q. 
Okay. Can you give me the cards of the 
24 
other people that have given you these cards all the 
25 
time so that we can --
www.phippsreporting.com 
(888)811-3408 
EFTA02726858

792 
1 
A. 
No. The only reason I asked for this card 
2 
today, I asked him for the card because I said, I 
3 
want to be able to mention this if I'm asked about 
4 
it in the deposition. Would you mind giving me the 
5 
card? 
6 
He said, "I'm thrilled." He went to his 
7 
car, he got the card, and he said --
8 
MR. EDWARDS: I would like to attach the 
9 
card of Jeffrey Levy to the deposition as the 
10 
next consecutive exhibit, which I believe is 
11 
26. 
12 
(Thereupon, marked as Plaintiff 
13 
Exhibit 26.) 
14 
MR. EDWARDS: Can I see the exhibit? 
15
