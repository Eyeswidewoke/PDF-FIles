time. Having said that I really enjoy the work on behalf of the UK and I can make a 
real contribution to the UK's economy and prosperity through the activity and 
interventions I make. 
I have to go to Paris this coming weekend, 11th to 14th Sept, and I remember that you 
have an apartment in Paris and was just wondering if I might be allowed to use it for 
the weekend? This is a private weekend and I am already booked into a hotel but 
on the off chance that you would allow me to use your apartment it would be really 
great from a number of perspectives. 
If this is either inappropriate or unavailable then I apologise for asking. 
I look forward to catching up with you personally before too long and in the 
meantime send you my very best wishes. 
Andrew.
