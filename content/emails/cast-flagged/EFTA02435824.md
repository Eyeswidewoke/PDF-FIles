On the sidelines of the big news there are two stories 
making the rounds: Dubai property and Dubai debt. 
In the grand scheme of things, Dubai is a pretty small place 
(the economy is about 45% the size of Singapore's), but it's 
interesting from the perspective of bubbles. 
Now that the initial chaos of the bubble bursting has worn 
EFTA_R1_01508045 
EFTA02435825

off, it's possible (perhaps) to plot what might happen next. 
Property Prices: 
Depending on who you talk to, "freehold" property prices 
either halved or went down 70% between October 2008 and 
March 2009.("Freehold" is property that foreigners can buy, 
which currently accounts for about 30% of the stock in 
Dubai). Here's a chart of who lived where in Dubai 
2008: (Click to enlarge) 
 
The 
point is that there are three markets, all going in different 
directions. 
The main reason for the bubble was that 90% of the 
"foreigners" market is focused on rentals, and less than 20% 
of the residual are "high flyers" with a second home. In 
2005, there was a huge demand for new accommodation 
because of economic growth, plus the start of the freehold 
construction boom; that had to be accommodated by new 
units, and the rents of those went through the roof. 
Existing accommodation lagged, so you could find one 
apartment in a building renting for $25,000 (since it had 
been rented a few years before and there was implicit and 
EFTA_R1_01508046 
EFTA02435826

later explicit rent control for incumbents), and a newly 
vacated one next door being rented for $75,000, and being 
snapped up. 
So the buyers only saw the rents on the (new) stuff on offer, 
and they thought, "OK, I'll buy at a 7% gross yield or so, and 
that's not counting for the "fact" that in Dubai house prices 
will go on going up forever." Whoopee! 
But that price wasn't a true reflection of market reality, and 
as soon as new units started coming on line (plus the 
economic slowdown), reality was restored. Yields didn't 
change, but rents went down. 
The rate of development of "new" accommodation is on the 
right on the chart above. The current situation is that 
construction almost stopped (buildings under construction 
typically got finished, but a lot got cancelled although it's not 
clear how many did). 
The consensus projection in 2008 was for 70,000 new units 
in 2010 (that's not hard, you just need to be able to count 
that far), some are projecting that figure will go down to 
20,000. 
How fast prices recover is an issue that depends mainly on 
the recovery of the Dubai economy, and that may depend on 
the second story in the newspapers. 
Debt: 
The second big story is that Dubai Inc. (i.e. the Government 
of Dubai plus "government-related issuers" (GSI)) owes 
between $80 billion and $160 billion of relatively short-term 
debt; depending on what newspaper stories you believe. 
There are reports that they are having some complications 
rolling that debt over, thanks in part to the worldwide credit 
crunch (they got caught borrowing short and investing long).

Earlier in the year there were concerns that there would be 
defaults, although there was never any question that Dubai's 
"rich relations" in Abu Dhabi would make sure that the 
essential infrastructure of Dubai kept working. 
There have been no defaults so far and Dubai has a long 
tradition of paying its debts, most of the development over 
the past thirty years was paid for with debt. 
Of course, there's always a first time. 
Some of the debt was recently downgraded from A3 to Baal 
by Moody's, this is what they said: 
"Following recent disclosures of increased conditionality 
around when support could be provided to the GRIs" 
In other words, a divide is building between debt that has 
some semblance of a sovereign guarantee, i.e. implicitly or 
explicitly guaranteed by the UAE Federal Government via 
the Dubai Financial Support Fund, and debt that has either a 
personal guarantee or that is collateralized by assets. 
How much of the debt is in the "good debt" camp, and how 
much is in the "not so good" camp is not clear, although 
reports suggest thatperhaps the biggest debtor is the "state-
owned" conglomerate Dubai World (which owns the 
developer Nakheel and Dubai Ports Authority (and which 
recently bought P&O Ports)), according to reports Dubai 
World owes between $40 billion and $60 billion. 
The idea of "state-owned" is also an interesting concept; the 
latest twist that was noticed by Moody's seems to imply that 
that the "state" owns the assets, but not the liabilities. 
What's also uncertain is how much of that was squandered 
buying assets outside of Dubai at the top of the market, 
possibly "double geared."

Starting in 2006, "Dubai Inc." went on a high profile shopping 
spree, investing in projects such as the MGM development 
in Las Vegas, which was a bit of a departure from the tried 
and tested business model of investing every penny in 
Dubai itself. 
That "old idea" was the motto of Sheikh Rashid who is once 
reported to have remarked, "I will build the infrastructure (in 
Dubai); the rest will follow." It was a good idea, and "the 
rest" followed. 
$1.3 trillion backstop? 
Some estimates put the collateral backing up the $80 billion 
to $160 billion of debt, at $1.3 trillion, although there are no 
details on how that was calculated. 
From the National Newspaper: 
It's mere speculation at this point, but according to SJS 
Markets, a Swiss brokerage, the new law could even cause 
Dubai's government-owned companies to sell assets in 
order to pay down debt and reduce its overall borrowings. 
The new law if enacted could limit Dubai's debt financed 
growth as the second largest emirate in the UAE has debt 
load of -$70 bn while its GDP is -$55 bn. However Dubai's 
assets are estimated at $1.3 trillion and we feel the 
government could sell assets to pay down debt. 
It's hard to figure out where that number came from seeing 
as the total amount of GDP declared for the whole of Dubai 
added up over the past twenty years was under $500 billion. 
In a rare report on Dubai and Dubai Inc's finances done in 
2003 by the National Bank of Dubai, the assets were rather 
more modest. Of course, perhaps most of that $1.3 trillion 
was made over the past five years?

Oh well, perhaps the people in the know have a different 
way to do valuations than the "old fashioned" methods, that 
might explain why I read in the newspaper that RBS is in 
town "helping out", they of course know all about doing 
valuations. 
Where Next? 
Dubai is either an economic anomaly or a free-marketer's 
fantasy land, depending on your perspective. 
Twenty years ago the economy was 15% the size of 
Singapore; in 2008 it was 45% ($US 80 billion). And 
Singapore is no slouch when it comes to economic growth. 
Dubai's nominal GDP growth averaged 15% since 1988, 
and that growth was not driven (directly) by oil. 
Why or how, or how much of that was inflation, are 
questions economists can argue about, but the question of 
inflation is rather academic considering that 90% of the labor 
force are foreigners on temporary work visas. 
In any case it's hard to explain that growth away by inflation 
since the currency is tied to the dollar and freely exchanged; 
and there are effectively no constraints on imports, of 
anything, including brains and brawn; Dubai can shop the 
world for the best deals on both of those commodities. 
Details aside, the business model hardly changed since the 
then Ruler((s)) of Dubai signed the Perpetual Maritime 
Treaty in 1835 and declared Dubai a "Free Port" in 1901 
making Dubai one of the first Special Economic Zones 
(SEZ); although arguably the Square Mile City of London 
and Venice preceded Dubai in that regard. 
That's a formula that China adopted so successfully when it 
embraced the "dangerous" path to capitalism, although it 
kept those ideas well segregated from the "mother-land"; 
EFTA_R1_01508050 
EFTA02435830

currently 80% of China's exports are manufactured in such 
zones; often in factories owned by foreigners. 
Regardless, the SEZ idea clearly works and the fact that 
Dubai (which hardly has any oil (left) to speak of), is located 
where it is, is not the secret to its success, that's just 
geography — what's fairly unique is the business model; and 
the main difference from the China model is that in China 
the labor is from the mainland, whereas in Dubai the labor is 
from foreign countries. (And laborers are treated much 
better in Dubai; don't believe what you read in the 
newspapers). 
Whatever happens, the core business model of Dubai is 
driven mainly by foreigners providing local and international 
goods and services, and it's likely that will carry on. 
That's what made Dubai work in the first place; and without 
that Dubai will have not very much but a load of empty real 
estate; Dubai came to be what it is by being an open place 
and safe place with good infrastructure and transportation, 
to do business; that's where the money and the demand for 
real estate comes from. 
So regardless of what happens to the debt that is not 
explicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the sovereign state of 
Dubai, or whatever steps the bond-holders take to liquidate 
whatever assets they collateralized that debt with, (in the 
event that it defaults); it's likely that the essential and very 
efficient infrastructure of Dubai will keep running, and will be 
kept running. 
In which case there will still be demand for real estate.
