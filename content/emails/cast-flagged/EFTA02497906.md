RE: Re: 
I follow up to the point where you write "the organizing principle of the shape is language..." No doubt it can (partially) 
be described in language, but that's not what you mean. 
Zipf's law is a rank-frequency distribution. And also meaningless, as Mandelbrot showed 60 years ago. I hope Yang is 
clear about this. He surely knows.

it is my failing not yours. the old math requires numbers . too limiting. ( we can put a metric overlay on later in the 
chain) imagine a shape in real space. it is readily apparent if a line either fits on the shape or not . how do you know. 
? you compare the line with the shape. your visual system allows the mental shape to either map onto or not onto the 
shape in a coherent manner. the shape is not an input device ,it is an object . the organizing principle of the shape is 
language, the shape is a collection of grammars. lines on the shape are either coherent or not. coherent ones are 
legitimate sentences . 
yang is flexible in his use of the term probability.. for example he in a number of papers refers to zipf as a probabiltiy 
distribution. i have checked a number of his papers after your last remark, I think it is a mistake. he means that after 
empirical measurement . for ex word frequency, . if ten times out of 100 the corpus has the word x. then he 
describes the probablility of finding the word as 10 percent . this is not correct. it is only the probablity of finding the 
word in the frequency list . but he is very accomplished at mathematical models.

Interesting image, but I don't see what it tells us about language. 
The problem looks to me like this, roughly.

Take, say, the human visual system. There's a genetic component that determines that humans will have a 
mammalian and not an insect visual system, and much else. Same with other subsystems of the organism — "organs," 
"modules." Language in particular. The technical name for this component, whatever it turns out to be, is UG. UG 
therefore determines that certain systems are possible I-languages for humans, others are not. I presume that is what 
the "biological organizing principle" for language is. It's plainly not an input system, though it determines possible input 
systems for human languages. I don't see how we improve understanding by looking at it from this perspective. 
A minor technical problem, not serious, has to do with distinguishing digital infinity from continuity, like 
continuous lines on the surface of a hemisphere. 
I think you'll find Yang interesting.

1.1 will wait on valeria. we can craft a fun few days

it appear to me that ""language" can be defined as the biological organizing principle that creates a shape 
space. "coherent sentences " are defined as those that fit on the shape. The projections on the sensory motors, allows 
communication. . There are an infinite digital number of sentences.that do fit on the shape , but orders of magnitude 
more, that do not fit.- to attempt a naive representation, imagine a hemisphere, ( symmetric), any continuous line 
drawn on its surface , is a sentence. there are infinite numbers of lines that can be drawn. however, trying to connect 
two points , directly without traversing the hemishpere is also infinitely possible but most solutions need to leave the 
surface. The principle that organizes the shape is NOT an input device. one can map inputs onto the shape but it is not 
THE shape , ex, a hemisphere bowl in 3 space, analogy, one can put marbles in the bowl and they will map a path to 
the bottom. but the shape of the bowl . determines how fast they move, and in which direction, . the shape of the bowl 
is the language. there is a shape for vision as well. . it exists without input, certain paths are more probable etc.

Valeria's not here right now, so will have to check with her about late September. Really intriguing 
possibilities, and a delightful offer. 
On Yang, I read his work quite differently. He does make use of word frequencies and probability 
distributions, but as far as I am aware in pretty straightforward and innocuous ways. And he's quite sophisticated about 
these matters. Smart and interesting guy. You might want to contact him directly. 
I don't recall his using Zipf's "laws," but it wouldn't matter much. Mandelbrot showed back in the '50s 
that they were a statistical artifact, near meaningless. I was, incidentally, surprised to see how he dealt with this result 
in his autobiography. I think he called it his "Keplerian moment," or something like that.

Would be interested in learning more about your critique of the use of probability in language 
work, mostly by computational cognitive scientists, as far as I know. I've written critiques of it too, but on different

grounds: failure to account for what they are trying to show, or even to understand the issue. There are, I think, some 
notable exceptions, like the recent work of Charles Yang, one of Bob Berwick's students.
