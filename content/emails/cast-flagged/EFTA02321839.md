I need to get a few samples to put up on the wall to =hoose a color on Thursday. The only issue I have right now is that the =oor frame to my terrace is rotting and the building will need to =ix/replace that and I think it should be done first before painting. =lso, I'm having the building's contractor replace the cover for the AC =nd radiator in my apt which had to be torn out before my new wood =loors were put in, which needs to be done before painting as well. I =on't know how long these things will take. I'm meeting with the =ontractor on Thursday morning. Andrew from 301 was meant to have a look =t my rotting door frame yesterday, but never came and hasn't responded =o my emails today about going to have a look. I'm not sure if =t will work out for Michael to do it considering these things should be =one first, and don't know how long each one will =ake! 1 EFTA_R1_01233231 EFTA02321839 |
