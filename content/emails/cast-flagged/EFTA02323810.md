| **Subject** | HI Steve, 2 EFTA_R1_01239092 EFTA02323811 Jeffrey is ready to start looking for a personal chef! He wanted me to touch base with you to see if you had any recommendations for someone for the job. He would like them to be based in New York and willing and able to travel with him to his homes. He'd like someone well versed in California cuisine but also able to do a variety of different types of food; Chinese, Italian, etc.. Any input or recommendations would be greatly appreciated! Thank you for your help, Sarah 3 EFTA_R1_01239093 EFTA02323812 |
