I hope you agree.. If there are aiii•an es you want or need let me know.. otherwise feel free to pass on to Jeffrey, do you think you could do $320K rather than $250K for the 10th anniversary event? That will give me closer to 1/3 of the total I need. No worries if not, but it will ease somewhat the time I need to spend on fundraising. Thanks for considering it.
