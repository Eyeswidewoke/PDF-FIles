Women in our County have been watching this case with great 
concern. I strongly suggest that you do not attack the victim(s). If you feel 
your client is innocent, you can file a libel suit- of course, the truth is an 
absolute defense to libel, and please keep in mind that not knowing the age 
of a child is no defense to statutory rape or any sexual enure committed 
against a child. 
Sincerely, 
Aileen Josephs, Esq.

Lately, Jeffrey Epstein's 
high-flying style has been 
drawing oohs and aahs: the 
bachelor financier lives 
in New York's largest 
private residence, claims to 
take only billionaires as 
clients, and flies celebrities 
including Bill Clinton and 
Kevin Spacey on his Boeing 
727. But pierce his air 
of mystery and the picture 
changes. VICKY WARD

n Manhattan's 
Upper Ely[ Side. home to some of the 
most expehsive real estate on earth, exists 
the crown jewel of the city's residential 
town houses. With its 15-trot-high oak door, 
huge arched windows, and nine floors. it 
sits on—or. rather. commands—the block 
of 71st Street between Fifth and Madison 
Avenues. Almost ludicrously out of pro-
portion with its four- and five-story neigh-
bors. it seems more like an institution than 
a house. This is perhaps not surprising—
until 1989 it was the Birch Wathen private 
school. Now it is said to be Manhattan's 
largest private residence. 
Inside. amid the flurry of menservants 
attired in sober black suits and pristine 
white gloves, you feel you have stumbled 
into someone's private Xanadu. This is 
no mere rich person's home, but a high-
walled. eclectic. imperious fantasy that 
seems to have no boundaries. 
The entrance hall is decorated not with 
paintings but with row upon row of indi-
vidually framed eyeballs: these, the owner 
tells people with relish, were imported from 
England. where they were made for in-
jured soldiers. Nat coma a marble foyer, 
which does have a painting, in the man-
ner of Jean Dubutkt ... but the host coyly 
refuses to tell visitors who painted it. In any 
case. guests are like pygmies next to the 
nearby twice-life-size sculpture of a naked 
African warrior. 
Despite its eccentricity the house is curi-
ously impersonal the statement of someone 
who was to be known for the scale of his 
possessions. Its occupant. financier Jeffrey 
Epstein, 50, admits to friends that he likes it 
when people think of him this way. A good-
looking man. resembling Ralph Lauren. 
with thick gray-white hair and a weathered 
face, he usually dresses in jeans, knit shirts, 
and loafers. He tells people he bought the 
house because he knew he "could newer live 
anywhere bigger." He thinks 51,000 square 
let is an appropriately large space kr some-
one like himself, who deals mostly in large 
concepts—especially large sums of money.

Guests are invited to lunch or dinner at 
the town house—Epstein usually mks to the 
former as "tea: since he likes to eat bite-
size morsels and drink copious quanta's of 
Earl Gory. (He does not touch alcohol or to-
bacco.) Tea is served in the "leather mom:' 
so called because of the cordovan-colored 
fabric on the walls. The chairs are covered 
in a leopard print, and on the wall hangs a 
huge, Oriental fantasy of a woman holding 
an opium pipe and caressing a snarling li-
onskin. Under her gaze, plates of finger 
sandwiches are delivered to Epstein and 
guests by the menservants in white gloves. 
Upstairs, to the right of a spiral stair-
case, is the "office," an enormous gallery 
spanning the width of the house. Strangely. 
it holds no computer. Computers belong in 
the "computer mom" is smaller room at 
the back of the house). Epstein has been 
known to say. The office features a gilded 
desk (which Epstein tells people belonged 
to banker J. P Morgan). 18th-century black 
lacquered Portuguese cabinets. and a nine-
foot ebony Steinway "D" grand. On the 
desk, a paperback copy of the Marquis de 
Sade's The Allsjoesunes of Orme was re-
cently spotted. Covering the floor. Epstein 
has explained. "is the largest Persian rug 
you'll ever see in a private home—so big, it 
must have come from a mosque: Amid 
such splendor, much of which reflects the 
work of the French decorator Alberto Pin-
to. who has worked -err Jacques Chirac and 
the royal families of Jordan and Saudi Ara-
bia, there is one particularly startling oddi-
ty: a stuffed black poodle. standing atop 
the grand piano. -No decorator would ever 
tell you to do that: Epstein brags to visi-
tors. "But I want people to think what it 
means to stuff a dog." People can't help 
but feel it's Epstein's way of saying that he 
always has the last word. 
In addition to the town house. Epstein 
lives in what is reputed to be the largest 
private dwelling in New Mexico. on an 418 
million. 7.500-acre ranch which he named 
"Zeno." "It makes the town house look hire 
a shack," Epstein has said. He also owns 
Little Sr. James. a 70-acre island in the 
U.S. Virgin islands. where the main house 
is currently being renamed by Edward Ma-
de, a designer of the Arnanresons. There is 
also a 56.8 million house in Palm Beach, 
Florida, and a fleet of aircraft: a Gulfstream 
IV, a helicopter. and a Boeing 727. replete 
with trading room. on which Epstein re-
cently flew President Clinton, actors Chris 
Tucker and Kevin Speech supermarket 
magnate Ron Burkle. Lew Wasserman's 
grandson, Casey Waxman, and a kw oth-
ers, on a mission to explore the problems of 
/UOS and economic development in Africa. 
Epstein is chaining_ but he doesn't let 
Pagnzaor 
the charm slip into his eyes. They are steely 
and calculating, giving some hint at the 
steady whir of machinery running behind 
them. "Let's play chess," he said to me, af-
ter refusing to give an interview kr this arti-
cle. "You be white. You get the first move: 
It was an appropriate metaphor for a man 
who seems to feel he can win no matter 
what the advantage of the other side. His 
advantage is that no one really seems to 
know him or his history completely or what 
his arsenal actually consists of. He has care-
fully engineered it so that he remains one 
of the kw truly baffling mysteries among 
New York's moneyed world. People know 
snippets, but kw know the whole. 
"He's wry enigmatic." says Rosa Mond-
ton, the former C.E.O. of Tiffany & Co. in 
the U.K. and a close friend since the early 
1980s. "You think you know him and then 
you peel off another ring of the onion skin 
and there's something else rinaordinary 
underneath. He never reveals his hand.... 
He's a classic iceberg. What you see is not 
what you get.
