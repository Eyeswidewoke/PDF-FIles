| **Subject** | The Bin Hi =aryna I saw your e =ail last night and like you I am very disappointed - you are the =erfect buyer for this amazing property. Please let me assure you Marc has been =oing everything possible to get things moving on the sale and in the =ast few days you have received the due diligence, the contract as =ell as the bankers details and they have spoken so I feel we are almost =here - the only outstanding document is a letter from your bank showing =ere the funds are coming from which will be for money laundering =urposes. The =onest truth is the current owner is very difficult and old and thinks =e is about to die and is trying to get all his affairs in order.... =ence the dramatic reduction in price and tight time frame... Since the recent price =eduction there have been a number of offers from all over the world =ncluding some higher and some lower than yours but honestly the seller =ust wants it sold now and he is not acting rationally... however we are =oing our best to make sure he sticks with your offer as we believe you =o be the best buyers. I honestly believe if you move ahead you'll be the =wner of this incredible home withiin a month but please try to do it as =uickly as you can (whilst of course doing the due diligence and =urveys) I was thinking we could try to get the surveyor to come =arlier? As you say it should be an easy transaction and I really hope =ou don't throw in the towel now when we are so close. I will try to call you =ater but wanted to also put my thoughts in writing.
