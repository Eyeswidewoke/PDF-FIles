We had a power outage, was very hard rain and hail. Checking. Regards, Natalia (Natasha) Molotkova Centurion Relationship Manager Hours: Mon through Friday 9AM-530PM EST Tue, Thur, Fri 9a - 530p EST Hi Natasha. I got on the phone and spoke to a team member. You can see what I did. We split ticket in two. The outbound one way then the second ticket is a round trip through JFK. Jeffrey wants to check if there is a better price through Miami on return. We can look at same thing: try a round trip STT/Miami/Moscow you can choose any date in the future that is cheap for her to return to STT on ! Perhaps it is a better price then going through JFK?. I have plans this evening but should be home around 9pm myself. If we can do this one check would be great. (We will worry about IIII and tomorrow)!
