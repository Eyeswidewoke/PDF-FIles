Dear Prince Andrew, 
13:20 
I am going on board of Aria Petroleum - Central Asia's 2nd largest fuel 
distribution company: $3 b+ in revenue and very profitable. They source and 
distribute fuel all over central asia (Russia, Kazakh, Azerbijian, Turkministan 
etc..) and are the preferred vendor of US DoD Defense Logistics. Company is 
logistics powerhouse. The business is 50/50 commercial/military. 
Fabulous company. Full transparency. Pristine reputation. 
The Company needs a $200 million working capital line due to significantly 
increased business from US DoD. 
Can you put me in touch with the appropriate senior banker at Barclays or RBS to 
discuss? There would likely be significant follow on business for any bank that 
provides the line. 
The Company is ready to engage immediately with banks. 
Warm regards to you and family, 
Ed Scott
