| **Subject** | RE: Sacco Carpet- Jeffrey Epstein Hi Karyna, Great! Did Mr. Epstein like the quality=of the sample we sent yesterday? Do you remember which ones he kept? Keep me posted on what he likes! If you=have any questions please reach out. You can send a messenger for the remain=er of the samples. That would be great Thanks, Dani http://www.saccocarpet.com/> wrote:=/p> Hi Karyna, I hope you are well! I sent the navy blue hand tufted=sample uptown to Jeffrey's apartment yesterday. Was it received? 2 EFTA_R1_01242163 EFTA02325125 This sample is 100% worsted wool, with a loop tip she=r pile. This is one of the most superior carpets for high traffic areas. Marc has agreed this is the product to use, as it is i=credibly durable. I know you had mentioned Jeffrey was looking for somethin= silk like but not silk. We can make the same navy sample with a blend of wool and shiny nylon instead of all w=ol which would add a beautiful sheen, and softness to the carpet while stil= remaining durable. Additionally, this carpet will pass all Fire testing'= and is certified for plane use. Please let me know his thoughts. I would love to cont=nue working with you on this.
