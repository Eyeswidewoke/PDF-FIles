The purchase agreement (e=pected to sign Monday) will allow the contract to be assigned to any affil=ate of Leon.

On what for= will you use the deduction. ? which business. , its structure. differ=nt buisnesses etc. Barry , what you will find is that there is very few answers to be found=on point as people in leons position rarely make cases to tax court. ex=eption being estate issues. . planes owned by farmers salesman, bank=rs. are usually small planes. meaningless to leons issue. large bi= gets are usually owned by corporations. . the facts. there are app=ox 400,000 planes in the states. out of that large number only about 13,=000 total private jets. out of that class only 2000 large jets and=most owned by corporations. how many people have business of leons size= . not including his art work. You asked , me what do we do now. as I told Brad years ago. Fir=t and foremost is accurate numbers presented in an organized fashion. =that is 80 percent of the grunt work. Once all the numbers are in shape = ie materials for the building of the financial architecture. . Leons =goals must be addressed and programatic . this takes hours of discussi=n. . next . plans are drawn up, . modifications are made, issues of=sec regulation, tax, control, succession. mechanics. all need to be plan=ed and adjusted to meet the goals. You need to recognize that there are few , very few examples of the h=use that in leons case needs to be re built. most people with leons we=lth have a serious family office with a huge stock portfolio. , not art.= and of those , few hold dormant assets ie apollo.. Its been ten yea=s since apollo went public. and the house needs total renovation. up=rades in tech, security, and the family has changed all very similar t= architecting a house after the children have grown and left. please note The information contained in this communication is confidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may constitute inside information, and is intended only for the use of the addressee.
