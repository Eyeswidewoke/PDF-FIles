| **Subject** | Russian visas I spoke to an agency who helps with Russian visas. They said the best visa f=r us to get would be a business visa which is good for one year. They can a=ply for the invitation for us which takes 2 weeks to get. Once we have the i=vitation, we have to give our passports to the Russian consulate for 3 days=to process the visa. All we have to give them for the invite is a copy of o=r passports, the company name, address, phone number and your position in t=e company. If we gave them that info today, we would have the invite by Dec=31st, but the Russian Consulate is closed from Jan 1-10, thus we could have=the visas by Jan.13 at the earliest. The cost is $800 Otherwise, if you want to stick with a tourist visa they are only good for o=e month and can be processed in a day. =?xml version=.0" encoding=TF-8"?> <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"> <plist version=.0"> <dict> <key>flags</key> <integer>8590195713</integer> <key>original-mailbox< ce > <string>imapi Sent%20Messages</string> <key>remote-id</key> <string>847</string> </dict> </plist> 1 EFTA_R1_01233120 EFTA02321772 |
