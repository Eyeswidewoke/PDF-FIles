1) Did you get a look at Indian land assembly loi (now called project silver)? Doesn't mean 
much w/o context, but the dd starts this week. Cerberus giving us access to everything they 
did. 
2) CHI project now 75% subscribed, but I am far from finished talking to all traditional members 
of the island investor group. I got strep (believe it or not) and have been down for the count 
for the last 4 days. 
3) Met with citigroup thurs/fri (despite strep) and we are very much on target with them 
regarding restructuring of senior secured. That is a fulcrum security. Assuming we get them, b 
of a, netixis and merrill we will be good to go. 
4) Have now confirmed 9/6 move-in date for new house. Excited about that. 
Hope you're good.
