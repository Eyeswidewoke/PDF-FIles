| **Subject** | Marrakech Propert= Dear Karyna It was a pleasure to meet you and show you some prope=ties during your visit to Marrakech. Below is a brief synopsis of each of t=e 3 properties you saw. Bin Ennakhil • the asking price remains at 55m euros but as discussed=this price is negotiable and we had it under contact last year but due to h=alth reasons the purchaser had to pull out. I now believe an offer circa 35= euros would be acceptable. This property is unique and will never be able t= be recreated, it is a work of art or a monument as much as fabulous proper=y. Dar Olfa - lik= Bin Ennakhil the asking price remains at 65m euros and was also under cont=ct last year but due tax reasons the deal did not go ahead - it is likely a=figure around 40 - 45m euros would be acceptable. The only comparable recen= sale was in this compound known as Bab Atlas and was the sale of the large=t property there for a reputed 100m euros to The Emir of Qatar. Ksar Swan - also located in B=b Atlas with an asking price of 30m euros is less negotiable. This property=is owned by the developer of the whole project and as you saw has some wond=rful workmanship with hand carved cedar ceilings and beautiful gardens. As i= is lived in most of the year it has a much warmer or homely feeling to the=all the others you saw. The very high end property market in Marrakech is as expected a tiny p=rt of the market and there are no comparable sales since the purchase by th= Emir however right now Ali Bongo from Gabon and Al Nahyan family of Abu Dh=bi are both building palaces which will cost over 40m euros each. Normally when purchasing a p=operty in Morocco one should add approximately 10% to the purchase price sp=lt 6% in government taxes, 1% Notaire fees and 3% real estate agency fees h=wever in the case of Bin Ennakhil for example as the property is owned by a=company in Lichtenstein there are no government taxes to be paid in Morocco= = am sending via wetransfer more pictures of Bin Ennakhil, Ksar Swan and Da= Olfa and you have the PDF brochures for each property.
