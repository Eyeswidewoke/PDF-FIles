### Match 1
> rney General why he has dismissed the idea of extradition out of hand?" From: Sent: Monday, June 15, 2020 10:54 AM To: Subject: FOR THE ATTENTION OF GEOFFREY BERMAN FOR THE ATTENTION OF GEOFFREY BERMAN Dear May I offer my congratulations on the way in which your office has been handling the Prince Andrew Affair this past week? My thinking is that it must have been rather interesting, even for a grown man, to learn just how low and dirty and tricky the British can sink when push comes to shove? They make Roger Stone, he who still has a Richard Nixon tattoo on his back, look like an amateur don

### Match 2
> ent someone who is obviously a child-abuser and paedophile from facing justice when the entire English-speaking world has branded him a liar after the car-crash interview. However I am not so certain. Looking at the tactics they have employed this past week, of trying to blame you for all of Prince Andrew's ills when you are in the middle of trying to conduct a professional investigation into EFTA00019112 something as serious as child sex slavery; my thinking is that they are willing to use every dirty trick in the book to keep the pervert Prince out of the FBI's clutches. The UK Tory Party has

### Match 3
> the press that the Prince IS now a target of your investigation due to his obfuscation and blatant stonewalling. Many are they on your side of the pond who have said, quite rightly, that an innocent man does not deflect or hide. And it is for this reason that everyone in Britain now feels that Prince Andrew really should be extradited. The reaction to the latest headline from the Sun newspaper has made this abundantly clear. Everyone is saying that if he were a Plumber or a Bus Driver he would be in handcuffs on a flight bound for New York right now. So don't you think it is high time, and this

### Match 4
> he would be in handcuffs on a flight bound for New York right now. So don't you think it is high time, and this is the second thing I'd like to see you do, to ask your Attorney General why he has dismissed the idea of extradition out of hand? Is it not a slap in the face of Democracy to accord Prince Andrew special privileges simply because of his royal status? What does General William Barr want the world to think? That perhaps there may be people in high places in America who are guilty along with Prince Andrew? And this after Donald Trump himself was filmed next to their close mutual friend J

What does General William Barr want the world to think? That perhaps there may be people in high places in America who are guilty along with Prince Andrew? And this after Donald Trump himself was filmed next to their close mutual friend Jeffrey Epstein yelling "oh yeah, she looks hot!". Journalists all over the globe have been saying the whole world has been watching this affair unfold as if they had telescopic eyeballs. If the United States law
