### Match 1
> 8:59:07 +0000 Hi =, Hope you're doing well! We are presenting an indictment in the Epstein case to the White Plains grand jury on Monday morning, and although the brass are still doing a final review, we hope to be able to send the indictment to you later today for your review. The defendant is Ghislaine Maxwell. Apologies for not giving you more lead time to review — this has moved more quickly than we expected, and the indictment has gone through several rounds of edits. Thanks, Assistant United States Attorney Southern District of New York New York, NY 10007 EFTA00020231
