Mueller's Fruit of the Poisonous Tree 
It makes no difference ho= honorable he is. His investigation is tainted by the bias that attended 
i=s origin in 2016. 
By

Special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation may face = serious legal obstacle: It is tainted by 
antecedent political bias. The J=ne 14 report from Michael Horowitz, the Justice Department's inspector general, 
unearthed a pattern of anti-Trump bias by high-ranking =fficials at the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Some of their 
communicati=ns, the report says, were "not only indicative of a biased state o= mind but imply a willingness to take 
action to impact a presidential candidate's electoral prospects."=Although Mr. Horowitz could not definitively ascertain 
whether this bias =E2fldirectly affected" specific FBI actions in the Hillary Cli=ton email investigation, it nonetheless 
affects the legality of the Trump-Russia collusion inquiry, code-named Crossfire Hurricane.=u> 
Crossfire was launched only months before the 2016 election. Its=FBI progenitors—the same 
ones who had investigated Mrs. Clinton40=804,deployed at least one informant to probe Trump campaign advisers, 
obtained Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court wiretap warrant=, issued national security letters to gather records, and 
unmasked the ide=tities of campaign officials who were surveilled. They also repeatedly lea=ed investigative 
information. 
Mr. Horowitz is separately scrutinizing Crossfire and isn4,=99t expected to finish for months. 
But the current report reveals that FBI=officials displayed not merely an appearance of bias against Donald Trump, but 
animus bordering on hatred. Peter Strzok, who le= both the Clinton and Trump investigations, confidently assuaged a 
colleag=e's fear that Mr. Trump would become president: "No he won=E2nt. We'll stop it." An unnamed FBI lawyer 
assigned to Crossfire told a colleague he was "devastated" and Q=804,numb" after Mr. Trump won, while declaring to 
another FBI att=rney: "Viva le resistance." 
The report highlights the FBI's failure to act promptly =pon discovering that Anthony Weiner's 
laptop contained thousands o= Mrs. Clinton's emails. Investigators justified the delay by citing the "higher priority" of 
Crossfire. But Mr. Horowit= writes: "We did not have confidence that Strzok's decisio= to prioritize the Russia 
investigation over following up on Ethel investi=ative lead discovered on the Weiner laptop was free from bias."=/u> 
Similarly, although Mr. Horowitz found no evidence that then-FBI=Director James Comey was 
trying to influence the election, Mr. Comey did m=ke decisions based on political considerations. He told the inspector 
general that his election-eve decision to reopen the=Clinton email investigation was motivated by a desire to protect her 
assum=d presidency's legitimacy. 
The inspector general wrote that Mr. Strzok's text messa=es "created the appearance that 
investigative decisions were impac=ed by bias or improper considerations." The report adds, important=y, that "most of 
the text messages raising such questions pertained t= the Russia investigation." Given how biases ineluctably shape 
beh=vior, these facts create a strong inference that by squelching the Clinton=investigation and building a narrative of

Trump-Russia collusion, a group of government officials sought to bolster Mrs. Clinton=E2ns electoral chances and, if 
the unthinkable happened, obtain an in=urance policy to cripple the Trump administration with accusations of 
ille=itimacy. 
What does this have to do with Mr. Mueller, who was appointed in=May 2017 after President 
Trump fired Mr. Comey? The inspector general conc=udes that the pervasive bias "cast a cloud over the FBI 
investigations to which these employees were assigned,Q=9D including Crossfire. And if Crossfire was politically 
motivated, then i=s culmination, the appointment of a special counsel, inherited the taint. =11 special-counsel activities—
investigations, plea deals, subpoenas, reports, indictments and convictions—are fr=it of a poisonous tree, byproducts of 
a violation of due process. That Mr.=Mueller and his staff had nothing to do with Crossfire's origin of=ers no cure. 
When the government deprives a person of life, liberty or proper=y, it is required to use 
fundamentally fair processes. The Supreme Court h=s made clear that when governmental action "shocks the 
conscience," it violates due process. Such con=uct includes investigative or prosecutorial efforts that appear, under 
the=totality of the circumstances, to be motivated by corruption, bias or entr=pment. 
In U.S. v. Russell4=A0(1973), the justices observed: "We may someday be presented with a 
situation in which the conduct of law enforcement agents is so outrageou= that due process principles would absolutely 
bar the government from invo=ing judicial processes to obtain a conviction." It didn't =ake long. In Blackledge v. Perry 
(1974), the court concluded that due process was=offended by a prosecutor's "realistic likelihood of 
4>=98vindictiveness' " that tainted the "very in=tiation of proceedings." 
In Young v. U.S. ex rel. Vuitton=C2*(1987), the justices held that because prosecutors have 
"power to employ the full machinery of the state in scrutiniz=ng any given individual ... we must have assurance that 
those who would =ield this power will be guided solely by their sense of public responsibil=ty for the attainment of 
justice." Prosecutors must be "disinterested" and make "dispassionate as=essments," free from any personal bias. 
In Williams v. Pennsylvania=/em> (2016), the court held that a state judge's potential bi=s 
violated due process because he had played a role, a quarter-century earli=r, in prosecuting the death-row inmate 
whose habeas corpus petition he was=hearing. The passage of time and involvement of others do not vitiate the =aint 
but heighten "the need for objective rules preventing the operation of bias that might otherwise be o=scured," the 
justices wrote. A single biased individual "m=ght still have an influence that, while not so visible ... is =evertheless 
significant." 
In addition to the numerous anti-Trump messages uncovered by the=inspector general, there is 
a strong circumstantial case—including=personnel, timing, methods and the absence of evidence—that Crossfire was 
initiated for political, not national-security, purposes.=/u> 
It was initiated in defiance of a longstanding Justice Departmen= presumption against 
investigating campaigns in an election year. And whil= impartiality is always required, a 2012 memo by then-Attorney 
General Eric Holder emphasizes that impartiality is t>=80,particularly important in an election year," and "pol=tics 
must play no role in the decisions of federal prosecutors or investig=tors regarding any investigations.... Law 
enforcement officers and prosecutors may never select the timing of investigative step= or criminal charges for the 
purpose of affecting any election, or for the=purpose of giving an advantage or disadvantage to any candidate or 
politic=l party." 
Strong evidence of a crime can overcome this policy, as was the =ase with the bureau's 
investigation of Mrs. Clinton's priv=te email server, which began more than a year before the 2016 election. But 
Crossfire was not a criminal investigation. It was a counter=ntelligence investigation predicated on the notion that 
Russia could be co=luding with the Trump campaign. There appears to have been no discernible =vidence of Trump-
Russia collusion at the time Crossfire was launched, further reinforcing the notion that it=was initiated "for the purpose" 
of affecting the president=al election.

The chief evidence of collusion is the hacking of the Democratic=National Committee's servers. 
But nothing in the public record sug=ests the Trump campaign aided that effort. The collusion narrative therefore hinges 
on the more generic assertion that Russia aimed=to help Mr. Trump's election, and that the Trump campaign 
reciproc=ted by embracing pro-Russian policies. Yet despite massive surveillance an= investigation, there's still no public 
evidence of any such exchange—only that Russia attempted to sow po=itical discord by undermining Mrs. Clinton and to 
a lesser extent Mr. Trum=. 
Some members of the Trump team interacted with Russians and advo=ated dovish policies. But 
so did numerous American political and academic =lites, including many Clinton advisers. Presidential campaigns 
routinely seek opposition research and interact with foreign pow=rs. The Clinton campaign funded the Steele dossier, 
whose British author p=id Russians to dish anti-Trump dirt. The Podesta Group, led by the brother=of Mrs. Clinton's 
campaign chairman, received millions lobbying for Russia's largest bank and the Europ=an Center for a Modern Ukraine, 
both with deep Kremlin ties. The Clinton F=undation and Bill Clinton took millions from Kremlin-connected 
businesses.=u>
