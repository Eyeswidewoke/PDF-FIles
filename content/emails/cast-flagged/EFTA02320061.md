He keeps changing the configuration of the 3 guest =ooms and wants to see all the furniture in the rooms before he decides =n the sizing of the rugs, which might be a little bit before that =appens.. they are still being painted, etc.. I just wanted to be sure his bathroom rug wasn't being delayed. Also, is there any time frame, quote, etc for the dining room carpet for =he NY house?
