| **Subject** | Artefacto PB cushion project - October 1, 2014 Greetings to Everyone, As promised, the=update on the Artefacto quote: The South Beach li=e from which the PB furniture was purchased is being discontinued. As a result, the cushion forms and covers for our order a=e no longer in stock, so the factory would be creating forms and patterns =or this order specifically. The factory's quo=e came back so high that Eduardo got his manager involved and they are see=ing another quote from a different factory. He did not tell me the n=mbers, just said it was unacceptable, and they have gone on to another fac=ory for a quote. I will call him on Monday to see=if the quote is ready, if I have not heard from him by then. Kind regards, DW 1 EFTA_R1_01264479 EFTA02331406 |
