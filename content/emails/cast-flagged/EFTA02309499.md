So just wanted to send a few=notes and thank you in advance. <=pan style="font-family: ".SFUIText"; font-size: 17pt;"><=r> Bedroom - Anything lying around like s=cks or small items of clothing please throw. Hairdryer, any other hair or=other appliances please also throw. Can you please also look on t=e floor before vacuuming just in case there is any jewellery. EFTA_R1_01192204 EFTA02309499 <=pan style="font-family: ".SFUIText"; font-size: 17pt;"><=r> Bathroom - Throw anything there.=/p> I bought new light bulbs for=all the lights but did not get a chance to clean. The bathroom is clean though=and cleaned the shower, shower door and walls after I used it. <=pan style="font-family: ".SFUIText"; font-size: 17pt;"><=r> Mirrored closet in hallway-<=span> There are some folded up box=s, bubble wrap and packing material in there if you want to take to 71st.</=pan> There is some light machine o= the top shelf that can be thrown. There are about 8 light wood=frames in there that Karyna should look at. He gave them to me once out of h= art room at 71st. <=pan style="font-family: ".SFUIText"; font-size: 17pt;"><=r> Small closet in hallway - There is toilet paper, paper=towel, washing fluid. Any other bits and pieces pl=ase throw away. <=pan style="font-family: ".SFUIText"; font-size: 17pt;"><=r> Living Room There are 5 boxes, my deskto= computer ( with keyboard , mouse and cords ► and two Ralph Lauren clothing=covers in navy blue that I need to keep!! I will send you a photo of them. M= Epstein has said that I can store these in the basement at 71st street. &n=sp;lf you can be careful with them as they still need to be properly sealed= and everything inside is valuable or fragile, except one which is books an= documents. I think they need to be lifted from underneath as they contain g=ass things and could be heavy and I don't want them to fall through= <=pan style="font-family: ".SFUIText"; font-size: 17pt;"><=r> There is another box and a b=g next to the sofa by the sofa side table which I was keeping for Blanca. T=is you can sadly throw because she didn't manage to take it all. Al= else you can throw unless you find anything that looks very valuable. But books, one candle, magaz=ne or papers if you see can be thrown. <=pan style="font-family: ".SFUlText"; font-size: 17pt;"><=r> Kitchen - 2 EFTA_R1_01192205 EFTA02309500 Please throw everything. Foo= in fridge, tea in cupboard, anything else in cupboard. I think karyna will=want to throw everything. There is one blue hermes cup and saucer that I wo=ld love if you could keep for me and put in one box. <=pan style="font-family: ".SFUIText"; font-size: 17pt;"><=r> I'm sorry, I know th=s is long, but I really fell short of time. I should have hired a professio=al moving company. I just did not manage well on my own. <=pan style="font-family: ".SFUIText"; font-size: 17pt;"><=r> I will send the list of ever=thing that is in the boxes to you Les and karyna. <=pan style="font-family: ".SFUlText"; font-size: 17pt;"><=r> Thank you Leo!!!! I really r=ally appreciate this!! Sent fr=m my iPhone 3 EFTA_R1_01192206 EFTA02309501 |
