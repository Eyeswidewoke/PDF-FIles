That get's you al= nine planets. I don't know where the 'keep' came into play. my sleep=schedule was all sorts of screwed up when i was there so that may be t=e explanation. Anyway stranger, the hint stops at N so i believe=it is neptune. Try it without the initial cap first. if that do=sn't work then try the initial cap. Also, I believe the password=is in that binder i left at HBRK with all the passwords to everything. Hope all is well with you and tell everyone i said hello.
