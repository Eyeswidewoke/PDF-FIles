| **Subject** | Re San Antonio. TX trip Hi Sarah, I am sorry to let you know that I cannot go to San Antonio on the the 20th. I just learned that my sister has to leave town for a personal emergency matter. I told a friend of my situation and she said why not visit her (Seattle,WA) instead to make use of my vacation days. I replied that I have to let my employer thru you know about this. Sarah, if you cancel it its alright but if Mr. Epstein approves it can I change my flight to Seattle instead. If he approves it I I like to leave on October 22 , back to WPB on 27th, to meet my other Doctors appointments, for the month. The airport that my friend will meet me is SEATAC. Thank you. 1 EFTA_R1_01209933 EFTA02315353 |
