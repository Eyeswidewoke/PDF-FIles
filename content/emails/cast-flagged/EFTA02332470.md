I KNOW. So shall I consider you my EX for sure? Please tell me it isn't so. gmax allEMI in> wrote: It won't be so easy to replace me! G Original message attached. Wrong! I spoke to a lady over coffee that my sis-in-law introduced me to. She has been through 4 assistants in the past month. As much as she would like to hire me, she can't afford me. She gave me an offer which I told her may be acceptable for 4 days a week, but after she agreed I decided before I settle I have to see what else is out there. (hint hint) So not unfaithful, never ever. Like me, you will also be very hard to replace. Besides, I'm not in a hurry I can still collect unemployment for another 20 weeks so there is no financial pressure to start working just yet. I just know I'm going to begin getting bored so I figured in the next couple weeks I'll dable with some agencies. Hurry up and come out here! And, hurry up and find a way for me to work for you long distance please. By the way, you can even ask Jack, from the beginning I told him that before I accepted anything I would speak to you first. I never went that far with this lady. So I guess you can say I looked but I didn't touch! Yours truly, Cim :) gmax gc s> wrote: Lauren told me that you arc being unfaithful and about to start working EFTA_R1_0 1278358 EFTA02332470 for someone else .
