Should we have J=n the focus or make it so both of you can participate evenly? I think that i= we make Jen the focus, we can have a fairly high level class with you as s=pport. Otherwise, we can try to organize a more "starter" c=urse for both of you. One question, are you comfortable working with raw fi=h?

Neither of us has lear=ed about Japanese cooking, so we would probably need to start with the basi=s, although Jen is a chef, but she has experience only with european/americ=n cuisine. But we do love Japanese food a lot! at least the American versio= of it. »» Other then food, we probably will do lot's of sightseeing, since this i= going to be our first time in Japan. I would love to get to know more abou= traditional Japanese architecture and design. We would also like to see s=mo and kabuki performance, as well as kodo and tea ceremony. So if you may h=ve suggestions on any of the above, it would be amazing. Otherwise, we are o=en to any other recommendations you might have and very much looking forwar= to this trip! »» Thank you both very much! »» Karyna. >>» >»» On Sep 5, 2016, at 5:53 AM, Joi Ito •: [. wrote: >>>» >»» Hi Karyna, >>>» >»» We can try to Skype today or you can tell us what you're looki=g for and we can help.
