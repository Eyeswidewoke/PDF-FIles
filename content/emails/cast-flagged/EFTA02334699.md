NOTICE FROM CARNIVAL CRUISE LINES -- Afghanistan Cruise 
We at Carnival Cruise Lines didn't forget that a lot of entertainers had 
promised to leave the country if George W. Bush became President. 
With that in mind, we have a Special Offer for those who want to keep their 
promise! 
ATTENTION: Would Alec Baldwin, Rosie O'Donnell, Cher, Phil Donahue, 
David Gephin, Barbara Streisand, Pierre Salinger, and anyone else who made 
that promise, please dispose of all US assets and report to Florida for the 
sailing of the Funship Cruise, "Elation," which has been commissioned to 
take you to your new vacation homes in Afghanistan. 
You may opt to be dropped off in Somalia or Iraq. The Florida Supreme 
Court will sponsor a Farewell Parade in your honor through Palm Beach, 
Broward, and Miami-Dade counties prior to your cruise. 
Please pack for an extended stay...at least four years and you should consider 
the possibility of eight years. 
NOTE: Since you advocate strict gun control, you may not bring any. 
Staffing your voyage is Bill Clinton as captain, Al Gore as cruise director, 
Monica Lewinsky as recreation director, Ted Kennedy as lifeguard and 
emergency procedures director, Rev. Jesse Jackson as spiritual advisor and 
marriage counselor, and Congressman Gary Condit as intern coordinator. 
If you have any questions about making arrangements for your homes, 
friends and loved ones, please direct your comments to Senator Hillary 
Clinton. Her village can raise your children while you're gone, and she can 
watch over all your money and your furnishings until you return. 
Bon Voyage! 
Is this a great country or what!
