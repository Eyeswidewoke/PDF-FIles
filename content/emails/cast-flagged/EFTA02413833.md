Prince Andrew mingles with glamorous 
New York ladies 
Last Updated: 1:33 AM, December 3, 2010 
While London is buzzing with royal wedding fever, Prince Andrew has been sizing up 
NYC ladies. The divorced prince mingled with the city's most glamorous including 
Laura Brown, Mary Alice Stephenson, Tatiana von Furstenberg and a bevy of 
models at a party at the townhouse of his pal Ghislaine Maxwell. A source told us, 
"Since Ghislaine recently split up with her partner, this was almost like a singles party. 
The prince seemed to be enchanted with many of the women in the room, especially 
one particular willowy blonde."
