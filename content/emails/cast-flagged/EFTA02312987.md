| **Subject** | Re: today HeMActually, maybe you can help me find something today. I need to ma=e white sweat pants for Jeffrey and need to find some fabric in the garment=district. Maybe you could check out some places and get samples of white fl=ece, sweatpants material or white terry cloth? I've been to Mood and they d=dn't really have anything. Maybe you could check other places? B&J Fabrics a might be a good place to check. Thanks!
