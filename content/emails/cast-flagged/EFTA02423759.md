Dear David, 
What a coincidence 1 was just entering your email address into my 
computer when your email arrived! 
I am now in KL. I managed to get out of London before the Ash cloud 
closed the airspace. 
I am having a series of discussions re The Green Park Group (GPG) when I 
get back and would be delighted to further our discussions especially as 
I know you will have spoken to the GURU.... 
It might be that he and you are the Ghost for me in the up side of this 
entity. 
I am free on Monday 7th from about 1800 in London or RL if either suits 
you? 
Anyway have fun in your bit of Asia.... 
A 
HRH The Duke of York KG
