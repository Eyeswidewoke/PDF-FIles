We would love to reschedule, however Michael is very busy at the moment, so in order to make sure we can get you two full days back to back, it is best to give us 2 weeks notice. Looking forward to working with you, and keep us posted when you return.

Mr. Epstein is asking for $5000 for 50 shots at a rate of $100 per shot. A $100 per shot is tight for me. Would Mr. Epstein be willing to meet me in the middle at $130 per shot for a total of $6500? Also, I will need an assistant for two days at a rate of $300 per day. Thanks, Michael On Wed, May 30, 2012 at 7:49 PM, <mailto » wrote: Thank you Michael. Mr Epstein said he would need 50 shots of each house. They are each quite large and is wondering if you would do the NY house for $5,000 for 50 shots? 2 EFTA_R1_01192363 EFTA02309565 On May 30, 2012, at 6:16 PM, Michael Weinstein < <mailto > wrote: Hi M, Nice talking to you today.
