We then had to find out =f your flight was available for upgrade since there are only a few =eats on each flight available for mileage upgrades. Once it was =onfirmed there was a seat available to upgrade with mileage points, =atasha transferred the Amex points to the account I had set up...yo= want to confirm there is an actual seat first because once the points =re converted to mileage with the airline they are not reversible (they =an't go back to Amex points). The transfer is immediate =owever so that is good. I will say it is easier to upgrade with Amex =oints and just have Natasha do it! We always get 20% of the points =ack in a few billing cycles. We can pay for an economy or premium =conomy seat then upgrade with Amex points. Example goes like this: If =he premium economy seat is $6000 and the Biz/First class seat is =10,000, we pay in real money the $6000 then the difference in price =rom premium economy to biz/first is $4000. The $4000 is converted to =00,000 points (4000x100). Also, we would get money back to our =ccount, not points, if you don't use a ticket...so it is =ctually OK if you don't wind up taking a flight in the end! At =east we get some money back. :) Lesley » To pay with points for upgrade - you book coach ticket and pay =ifference in fare (plus possible change fee) in points. Or you pay for =usiness/first class ticket partially with points (20% back), let's say =ou pay coach value with money and the rest - difference - in points, to =void change fee. » 1.00 = 100 points. » Other option - to transfer American Express points to the airline and =et mileage upgrade (we can transfer points to certain airlines), 1 =oint = 1 miles. But mileage upgrade could be tricky, has to be =vailable, sometimes it is not the lowest fare to be upgradable and =ometimes you have to do it yourself (with certain airlines), but I can =ransfer points. >> <?xml version=.0" encoding=TF-8"?> <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/Propertylist-1.0.dtd"> <plist version=.0"> alict> <key>conversation-idgkey> EFTA_R1_01210431 EFTA02315498 <integer>51177</integer> <key>date-last-viewed</key> <integer>04integer> <key>date-receivedqkey> <integer>1556639134</integer> <key>flagsgkey> <integer>85901957134integen <key>remote-ick/key> <string>90943</string> </dict> </plist> 2 EFTA_R1_01210432 EFTA02315499 |
