Q 
You didn't phony up a flight manifest where 
you added Bill Clinton and Prince Andrew and young 
girls' names to a Jeffrey Epstein flight manifest for 
purposes of showing perspective investors how the 
settlement system worked and why important people might 
want confidentiality in exchange for large sums of money 
to be paid to the plaintiff? 
A 
My best recollection is, is we used -- I think 
I testified to this yesterday or the day before -- we

used real flight manifests during that meeting with 
the -- Mr. Scherer's clients. And I told them about 
fake flight manifests. I don't recall that we created 
one. If you have one, you can show it to me, that would 
refresh my recollection, but I actually don't recall 
that being a document that I created.

BY MR. RABIN: 
Q 
Okay. I want to break these down into groups 
and try and get your best recollection as to what you 
told different people in order to engage them in your 
scheme. And I want to start first with the people in 
your law firm. Okay? 
A 
Sure. 
Q 
All right. Russell Adler, you generally 
described the fact that he helped you round up other 
lawyers to provide false verifications that they were 
either sending business or cases to your firm, correct? 
A 
That is one of the things that he did, yes. 
Q 
And what was the 
what was it that you told 
him was the reason why you needed those lawyers? 
First of all, was it honest or a lie and what 
was the --
A 
No, it was honest. 
Q 
Okay. And what -- it was honest, what you 
told him? 
A 
I told Mr. Adler -- to the best of my 
recollection, I told him that we had the hedge funds 
coming in town and that in order to convince them to 
continue to do business with us, that I needed these 
people to lie about the number of cases we had.

Q 
So, essentially, what you're saying is, you 
honestly told him aspects of the scheme or he already 
knew aspects of the scheme and you told him the honest 
purpose for which you were lining up these lawyers? Is 
that what you're saying? 
MR. SCHERER: Object to form. 
A 
I don't understand the question but you 
have --
BY MR. RABIN: 
Q 
Let me rephrase it. 
MR. SCHERER: Objection to form. 
BY MR. RABIN: 
Q 
I don't want you to answer a question you 
don't understand. 
Is your -- what you just summarized or just 
testified to is that you told Adler that you needed 
these lawyers to provide false information? 
A 
I told Adler -- yes, I told Adler I needed 
these lawyers to lie. 
Q 
Okay. David Boden, generally what was David 
Boden's role? 
A 
He was my general counsel, and he ran a 
sub-Ponzi scheme, as we've come to call it. 
Q 
All right. And what was the lie that you told 
or the honest information that you gave David Boden in

moment, please. 
I think --
MR. SCHERER: I'm going to object to the 
question, Sam, unless you can ask the witness 
to identify who saw him get the cash so he can 
have a complete answer, since I can't have any 
more examination. 
MR. RABIN: I'm happy to ask that 
question. 
MR. SCHERER: Thank you. 
3Y MR. RABIN: 
Q 
Did you hear Mr. Scherer's question? 
A 
I'm sorry, no. 
Q 
Who was the person that witnessed you obtain 
the cash that you claim that you gave to Mr. Weintraub? 
MR. LAVECCHIO: Objection --
MR. RABIN: So much for your question. 
MR. SCHERER: Take all the joy out of 
this. 
MR. LICHTMAN: That seemed like a perfect 
way to end the transcript. 
BY MR. RABIN: 
Q 
One other area, just real fast, two questions. 
You remember the Kroll project you discussed with Ken 
Jenne?

A 
I don't. 
Q 
All right. Did Ken Jenne ever propose to you 
starting a business similar to Kroll's? 
A 
Yes. 
Q , And what he -- what -- explain that to us, 
what he was purposing in that. 
A 
We were hiring a lot of retired law 
enforcement at the time, former ABT agents, FBI agents, 
IRS agents, and he wanted to put together something to 
rival Kroll. 
Q 
And did that go beyond any discussions? 
A 
Other than him and I hiring people to kind of 
get it started up, no. 
Q 
And did Kan Jenne have any role in your 
illegal activities? 
A 
No, sir. 
Q 
Other than, perhaps, that one occasion where 
he carried boxes -- the Epstein boxes into your office 
that people are claiming that he did? 
A 
No, sir. He had no involvement. 
MR. RABIN: I'm going to cede the balance 
of my time to Mr. Rasco.
