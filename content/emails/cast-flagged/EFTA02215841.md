Taylor, • AM PDT: Hello You are free to enter identical personalizations for the kits if you wish. The original personalization on each sample kit is meant to help customers organize multiple kits, but will not necessarily correspond with the name of the person who will be using the kit in question. Until a sample kit has been registered to a 23andMe account, it can be used by anyone. The registration process will allow the sample kit to be associated with the name of the person providing the sample. Please let me know when you have completed your order.

The order was approved for shipment by the appropriate teams, however PayPal prevented us from completing this order as there were insufficient funds in the purchasing account. The message our system received was as follows: PayPal gateway has rejected request. Transaction rejected, please contact the buyer (#10606: Buyer cannot pay) We have been attempting to complete this order for a little over a week in the hopes that the payment response would update. Unfortunately, we received a new message earlier today stating that PayPal will not complete the order. As a result, we have cancelled order #740-627542-142810. If you or the original purchaser would like to place a new order, please reply directly to this message immediately after placing the order so I can approve it at our warehouse. Depending on the routing and/or availability of funds in the original PayPal account, you may wish to instead purchase using a credit card. I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this has caused. Please let me know if there's anything I can answer for you at this time. Best regards, Taylor The 23andMe Team Jun 5, 7:34 AM PDT: e o ay or. would like to help Sultan Bin Sulayem facilitate his order #740-627542-142810 of 30 (thirty) -23 and Me" kits he placed an order for on May 21, 2017. You specifically emailed Sultan on May 23, 2017, to find out the use of the 30 kits (you say due to the size of the order you need to find out the intended use for the kits). He would like to give the kits to his co-workders so they too may enjoy investigating their ancestry. (Sultan participated with his own DNA and found it fascinating...he wants the people he works with to participate as well) The kits are to be delivered to: Jeffrey Epstein 9 East 71st Street NY, NY 10021 The kits are to be delivered to Jeffrey's address for ease. We have ordered many kits ourselves as gifts...indeed, Sultan received his personal kit from Jeffrey as a gift. The kits were paid for by Jim Miller who is Sultan's Personal Assistant. Jim has a supplementary credit card that is linked to Sultan's account so he can make purchases in Sultan's name. Please advise what, if any, other information you would like so we may have the kits shipped as soon as EFTA_R1_00944205 EFTA02215843 possible. If we need to make an entire new order, please let me know so we may do so. sts an o Jeffrey Epstein > Begin forwarded message: > From: Sultan Bin Sulayem > Subject: Fwd: (983918) Act dMe Order #740.627542-142810 > Date.
