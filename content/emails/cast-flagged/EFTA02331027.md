| **CC** | Karyna Shuliak > Hey guys. Just forwarded you a PDF file of the items being delivered so far tomorrow for 811 bathroom. Please disregard the vanity..that is the only thing not coming on the list. Karyna is ordering a different vanity and sink today and will forward details once I have them. We still need to source the medicine cabinet, shower doors and sconces if wanted/needed. I know we want to do a drop ceiling with puck lights, so Karyna needs to decide if she wants a sconce over the med cabinet as well. <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/Propertylist-1.0.dtd"> <plist version="1.0"> <dict> <key>conversation-idgkey> <integer>16684</integer> <key>date-last-viewed</key> <integer>0</integer> <key>date-received</key> <integer>1338814990</integer> <key>flags</key> <integer>8623750145</integer> <key>remote-id</key> <string>S900</string> </dict> </plist> 1 EFTA_R1_01263625 EFTA02331027 |
