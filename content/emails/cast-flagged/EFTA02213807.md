Everything else - I count on you. AAA Sent from my iPhone On 24 May 2017, at 23:35 wrote: Ni Nili!! All good to know...we most definitely can get the chains fixed for you on the windows...would it be ok for me to send in Karyna EFTA_R1_00939286 EFTA02213807 tomorrow or Friday to determine the problem and possibly get them fixed prior to your arrival back? Once you are back we can put you in touch with James or maybe even one of Jeffrey's assistants who live at the apartments could swing by to lend you a hand and a lesson...! I hope Tess will be in on Friday...she will be out tomorrow for medical reasons and let me know she may not be able to come in on Friday...if it is not Friday, we will get her in one day next week (probably more like Wcd, as Monday is Labor Day and Jeffrey's main maid does not return from FL until late Tues...and Jeffrey is returning Tues...Don't worry though ...we will figure it all out)! On May 24, 2017, at 4:28 PM, Nili Priell Barak Hi= We leave today. I arm the alarm. Tess told me that she will come on Friday, so she will have to call Rafi to disarm. EFTA_R1_00939287 EFTA02213808 Thanks for the appletv - it seems much better, though we haven't yet got all the channels and possibilities. When we come again I will have to get James explain. There is also a problem with the chains of the window shields. It will also wait next time. Best regards Nili Sent from my iPhone EFTA_R1_00939288 EFTA02213809 |
