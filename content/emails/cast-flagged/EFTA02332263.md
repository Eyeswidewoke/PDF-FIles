The Band Plays On 
It'/z Last time we checked in with Douglas Band -- former president Bill Clinton's personal aide, who is so 
stern and strapping that he's often mistaken for a Secret Service agent — he was shutting down a C-
SPAN cameraman trying to tape Clinton's remarks at a book party for Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.). 
Now we hear that when Clinton's young protector isn't blocking pesky reporters from bothering his boss at 
a Washington fundraiser, Band is snuggling with a famous supermodel at a trendy Manhattan restaurant. 
First the fundraiser story: Washington Times metro reporter Jabeen Bhatti was assigned to cover the 
party at the home of Beth and Ron Dozoretz for the Daniel Pearl Foundation. Spotting Clinton, Bhatti told 
us yesterday, she walked toward him through the crowd with notebook ready when Band blocked her 
path. "It's inappropriate to ask any questions' she quoted Band as instructing her at an event held to 
celebrate a free and unfettered press. Bhatti regrouped and tried again. "Why do you think it's important 
to be here?" she innocuously asked Clinton — who turned away in response, she said. 
Now the interesting stuff: Monday's New York Daily News reported that Naomi Campbell was seen 
"snuggling' with a new man at Serafina. We have it on good authority that the man was Band. 
Campbell's publicist, Howard Rubenstein, told us the two are "just friends." Unfortunately Band did not 
respond to a message we left yesterday, and there was no comment, none at all, from the Clinton camp.
