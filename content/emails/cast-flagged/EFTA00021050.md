## Match Contexts

### Match 1
> B accounts, some of it going through at least one Russian bank. • DB managers raised concerns after seeing the Miami Herald articles and actually shut down several of Epstein's accounts. • He had dozens of accounts with many beneficiaries who had authority to make disbursements, one of whom was Ghislaine Maxwell. Her account was named "Butterfly," or something like that. • He conducted hundreds of millions of dollars of business on the foreign exchange markets using DB in the last year. Thanks. EFTA00021050
