Re: 
Dubai Inc. Needs Change at the Top

Faced with a continuing financial crisis of savage proportions, Dubai ri=ks retreating into its past rather than facing up to 
its new reality. The Gulf=20 emirate needs to radically overhaul its state-controlled companies if it is=to overcome its 
$80 billion mountain of debt. Yet rather than seize the opport=nity to introduce international standards of governance 
and transparency, the pe=ple whose poor judgment led Dubai to the brink have kept their jobs. For wester= lenders with 
billions of dollars still at stake, that is troubling. 
Take Dubai World, the conglomerate that has just been radically restruct=red after running up almost $60 billion of 
liabilities on an ill-judged acquisi=ion spree. Its deals included buying struggling Madison Avenue retailer Barneys=for 
$800 million, investing in an $8.8 billion Las Vegas casino development and=20 paying $100 million for the Queen 
Elizabeth II liner, which has since spent=most of its time languishing in a Dubai dry dock. 
Dubai World has now cut its work force by 15% in an effort to save $800=20 million over the next three years. 
Surprisingly, its senior managers remain=in place, including Sultan bin Sulayem, the chairman who masterminded the 
expansion. That has disappointed bankers who fear that, unless senior manag=rs are held more accountable, the 
mistakes of the past will be repeated. 
But holding senior Emirati officials like Mr. Sulayem responsible for th=ir decisions will be tricky. The Sulayem family's 
ties to Dubai's ruli=g Maktoums run deep. Mr. Sulayem's father was a key adviser to the family. The sam= is true of 
many other of the emirate's business leaders whose reputations have =een damaged by the crisis. 
Western lenders would rather see experienced and suitably qualified executives running Dubai's companies with proper 
accountability to an=20 independent board and creditors. Yet Dubai's ruler, Sheik Mohammed bin =ashid Al Maktoum, 
appears to be heading in the opposite direction, possibly handing =ore power to his sons after being let down by some 
of his key lieutenants. This=20 could mean a bigger role in Dubai's corporate affairs for the popular b=t inexperienced 
26-year-old Crown Prince Hamdan. 
Long term, this looks unsustainable. The scale of Dubai's financial =oes means painful changes can't be resisted for long. 
If the easy credit of=the past decade allowed officials like Mr. Sulayem to build Dubai World into a truly=20 international 
company, the next 10 years will see banks demanding greater=20 transparency in return for capital.
