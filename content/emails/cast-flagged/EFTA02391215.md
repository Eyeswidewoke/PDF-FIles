Hi Eva, 
Elka and I were in France and were daydreaming about the idea of you guys being in the big house exactly fifty 
meters from our place, maybe closer. 
It occurred to me that today is Jeffrey's birthday, so if you happen to be talking to him, please let him know I 
send my best wishes. I don't have his email address. 
Talk to you soon, 
Ron
