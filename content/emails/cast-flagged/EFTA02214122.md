The ideal dates would be flying out on July 22nd and returning on August 12 or 13th. As airport will be closed for reconstruction works this summer, I will have to depart from and return w airport. Thank you so much and once again sorry for bothering you with this! xoxoxo Justina phone: + EFTA_R1_00940124 EFTA02214122 |
