Defendants Jeffrey Epstein and Sarah Kellen respectfully move for a 
mandatory stay of this action under Title 18, United States Code, Section 3509(k), 
Section 1595(bX1), and alternatively, under this Court's discretionary authority to 
stay civil litigation, based on the existence of a pending federal criminal action. 
Introduction 
This lawsuit arises from a pending federal criminal action concerning, 
among other things, an alleged assault of the plaintiff Jane Doe, who, according to 
her complaint, on "numerous occasions" provided "massages" to Epstein with "no 
credentials to provide massage therapy" and was "sometimes paid . . for the 
`sessions'." Compl., ¶¶ 6, 11. A federal statute directly on point provides that 
when a civil suit alleging damages to a minor victim arises out of the same 
occurrence as a "criminal action," the civil suit "shall be stayed until the end of all 
phases of the criminal action." 18 U.S.C. § 3509(k) (emphasis added).' 
The full text of the mandatory-stay provision reads: 
If, at any time that a cause of action for recovery of compensation for damage or 
injury to the person of a child exists, a criminal action is pending which arises out 
of the same occurrence and in which the child is the victim, the civil action shall 
be stayed until the end of all phases of the criminal action and any mention of the 
civil action during the criminal proceeding is prohibited. As used in this 
subsection, a criminal action is pending until its final adjudication in the trial 
court. 
18 U.S.C. § 3509(k).

Accordingly, a stay of this case is mandatory until the criminal action arising from 
the same allegations is no longer pending. 
The Pending Federal Criminal Action 
In 2006, a Florida state grand jury indicted Jeffrey Epstein on allegations 
similar to those in the instant action (State of Florida v. Jeffrey Epstein, Case No. 
2006 CF 09454A, Fifteenth Judicial Circuit, Palm Beach County) (the "Florida 
Criminal Action"). Shortly thereafter, the United States Attorney's Office for the 
Southern District of Florida (the "USAO") began a federal grand jury investigation 
into allegations arising out of the same incidents alleged in the instant action (Grand 
Jury No. 07-103 (WPB), United States District Court for the Southern District of 
Florida) ("the Federal Criminal Action"). 
In September 2007, the USAO and Mr. Epstein entered into a highly unusual 
and unprecedented deferred-prosecution agreement (the "Agreement"), in which the 
USAO agreed to defer (not dismiss or close) the Federal Criminal Action on the 
condition that Mr. Epstein continue to comply with numerous obligations, the first of 
which was pleading guilty to certain state charges in the Florida Criminal Action. 
The Agreement itself uses the term "deferred" (rather than "dismissed" or "closed") 
to describe the status of the Federal Criminal Action: 
THEREFORE, on the authority of R. Alexander Acosta, United States 
Attorney for the Southern District of Florida prosecution in this 
District, for these offenses shall be deferred in favor of prosecution by

the State of Florida, provided that Epstein abides by the following 
conditions and the requirements of this Agreement . . . . 
Agreement, at 2. 
By no stretch did the USAO finalize, close, complete, dismiss or abandon 
the Federal Criminal Action. 
Indeed, as the lead federal prosecutor recently 
explained, the USAO merely "agreed to defer federal prosecution in favor of 
prosecution by the State of Florida . . . ." 
See In re: Jane Doe, Case No. 08-
80736-CIV-Marra/Johnson (S.D. Fla.) (D.E. 14), Decl. of AUSA Villafana, 
07/09/08, ¶ 5, attached hereto as Exhibit "A" (emphasis added). 
Under the 
Agreement, the USAO presently retains the continuing right to indict Mr. Epstein - 
- or to unseal "any" already-existing federal "charges" that may already have been 
handed up by the federal grand jury and sealed - - should he breach any of its 
provisions. Agreement, at 2. 
The period of the deferral continues until three months after Mr. Epstein 
completes service of his sentence in the Florida Criminal Action. Id. Indeed, the 
final three months of the Agreement's term constitute an extended period during 
which the USAO expressly retains the ability to evaluate whether Epstein 
committed any breaches of his numerous obligations under the agreement while he 
was serving his state sentence, and, if it so determines, reserves the right to indict

(or unseal an existing indictment against) Mr. Epstein - - even after he has 
completed serving his entire state sentence. 
The Agreement further provides that upon Epstein's execution of a plea 
agreement in the State Criminal Case, the Federal Criminal Action "will be 
suspended" and all pending grand-jury subpoenas "will be held in abeyance unless 
and until the defendant violates any term of this agreement." Agreement, at 5 
(emphasis added). The Agreement directs the USAO and Epstein to. "maintain 
their evidence, specifically evidence requested by or directly related to the grand 
jury subpoenas that have been issued," and to maintain such evidence "inviolate." 
Id. (emphasis added). It also expressly provides that the grand-jury subpoenas 
continue to remain "outstanding" until "the successful completion of the terms of 
this agreement." Id. (emphasis added). 
Further, it includes a promise not to prosecute movant/defendant Sarah 
Kellen, only if "Epstein successfully fulfills all of the terms and conditions of th[e] 
agreement." Id 
Finally, the Agreement provides that the USAO's declination of prosecution 
for certain enumerated offenses and dismissal of any existing (sealed) charges will 
not occur until 90 days following the completion of his state sentence: 
If the United States Attorney should determine, based on 
reliable evidence, that, during the period of the Agreement, Epstein 
willfully violated any of the conditions of this Agreement, then the

United States Attorney may, within ninety (90) days following the 
expiration of the term of home confinement discussed below, provide 
Epstein with timely notice specifying the condition(s) of the 
Agreement that he has violated, and shall initiate its prosecution on 
any offense within sixty (60) days' of [sic] giving notice of the 
violation. Any notice provided to Epstein pursuant to this paragraph 
shall be provided within 60 days of the United States learning of facts 
which may provide a basis for a determination of a breach of the 
Agreement. 
After timely fulfilling all the terms and conditions of the 
Agreement, no prosecution for the offenses set out on pages 1 and 2 of 
this Agreement, nor any other offenses that have been the subject of 
the joint investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the 
United States Attorney's Office, nor any offenses that arose from the 
Federal Grand Jury investigation will be instituted in this District, and 
the charges against Epstein, if any, will be dismissed. 
Agreement, at 2. 
Consistent with the Agreement and its position that the Federal Criminal 
Action continues to remain pending, the USAO recently sent letters to attorneys for 
people that the USAO has designated as "victims." In those letters, the USAO 
asked, "[I]f you do file a claim under 18 U.S.C. § 2255 and Mr. Epstein denies that 
your client is a victim of an enumerated offense, please provide notice of that 
denial to the undersigned [AUSA]." See Decl. of AUSA Villafana, Exhs. 6 & 7, at 
2 (July 9, 2008). The clear implication of the USAO's request (by which the 
USAO appears to involve itself in the instant litigation, despite advising the 
recipients that it cannot "take part in or otherwise assist in civil litigation," id. at 2), 
is that the USAO believes that such denial might breach the Agreement.
