| **Subject** | Next <mailto > > > > So for my final test I am going to the island on in first week of may as I am sure he told you. Spoke briefly about pay with JE today as well. Just so we are clear I have already been payed by Steve for all my time up till yesterday so we are all settled up as far as that is concerned. Just curious how the pay works from here on out? I am not being payed for this downtime while he is away, and then start getting payed when we leave for the islands is that correct? I would like to speak to you at some pint in the next few days if possible and pick your brain about what happens there as far as food. Also when we will be leaving and all that info... JE mentioned I will need to bring some stuff with me because produce is limited so I will have to plan accordingly. I would also like to speak to Brice again if that would be ok. Thank you for everything you've been a great help this last week. Francis Francis J. Derby <mailto EFTA_R1_01182552 EFTA02306589 |
