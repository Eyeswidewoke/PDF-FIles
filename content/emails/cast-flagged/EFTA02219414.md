| **Subject** | 70th Birthday Dinner in Southampton Dear Jeffrey, As you know, I am in the South of France finishing up the last leg of my three week trip to London, Capri, Coronis and St. Maxime. Have had an amazing time. Will be home on Friday, July 14th. Going straight to Southampton for the final planning of my 70th birthday party. The party will be at Avie and Gigi Mortimer's in Southampton on Saturday, July 15th. What was originally to be a dinner for 30 I play tennis with, has grown into a mini event for 70 friends. I've been working hard on organizing this for three weeks from Europe with my office, the caterer, and the florist. I think it's going to be sensation and I am very excited. I have enclosed the invitation, the latest guest list, the bill from the caterer and the bill from the florist/party designer. EFTA_R1_00953596 EFTA02219417 As you can see, the total is approx. $30k. What I am planning to do with the rest of your 100k gift (minus the 15k for Elton John) is use it for the renovation of my apartment. Will give you further details on that soon. I cannot thank you enough for your amazing generosity and always making my life that much better. It makes me feel as if my own father is looking down upon both of us and thrilled that such a wonderful person is taking care of his daughter, as he would have, had he lived to be 100! I wish you were able to be there. As you can see, the list is pretty interesting and only you could've made this birthday such a memorable one. I am also updating the best seller "How to Look Like Me at 60" with a sequel called "How to Look Like Me at 70: The Sequel to How to Look Like Mc at 60." Will give you the first signed copy. xoxo, Peggy P.S. Do you want the caterer and the florist to bill you directly? My accountant Josh put down a $6k deposit on the caterer.
