Below are my measurements of the 2 windows behind JE's desk, the 2 doors and the large picture window. I want to order the leather today for the panels and want to make sure I'm ordering the correct amount. The leather comes 55" wide. For the 2 windows behind JE desk, JE wants it to be one solid panel of leather, not divided in two. The doors will need 2 panels each, and of course the picture window will need 4 panels. I calculated 17 yards needed. Could you confirm that for me? Thank you so much! Also, Jeffrey agrees that we need to add the finishing edge to the inside of the panels on the doors and the inside of the 2 middle picture window panels. Please let me know if John can do that. thanks. LSJ,LLC Island Manager 6100 Red Hook Quarters Suite 83 St Thomas USVI 00802 EFTA_R1_01238130 EFTA02323470 2 EFTA_R1_01238131 EFTA02323471 |
