| **Subject** | LSJ Miles and Cathy leave Greetings During his last visit, Mr Epstein told Cathy and Ito take a weeks break before the start of the holidays. Mr Epstein gave us the dates of 19 October to 27 October. He also is allowing us to visit our daughter who has relocated to London to work and study. I have booked the tickets etc. Bruce will be on island during our leave. Trust that this is in order. Many thanks for the oppurtunity to make sure Nikki is properly settled in.
