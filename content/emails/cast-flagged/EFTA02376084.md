I have not been able to get comfortable with buying =roperty in New York City worth something like $11M and letting 
you use it.=o:p> 
Even if I got the appreciation and you covered the e=penses there is no reason to be sure the appreciation would cover 
the cost=of the money. 
The place you looked at is super nice and it is the =ind of place you should aspire to have assuming the 
job/bonus/investment s=uff goes well. 
When you moved over from the foundation I was willin= to increase your salary quite significantly. 
Then when we discussed your financial goals at first=push ng for a pure investing thing I was open to the discussion. 
My main response was being willing to make another b=g increase in your salary which I did. 
Then we continued the investment discussion and I wa= open to that including spending time on the investments to 
make sure they=were ok. 
Normally I would not spend time on smaller investmen=s but I was willing to do so because they were interesting and to 
help you= 
I know you have talked about getting a place in New =ork for a long time. I would be glad to help with some kind of 
place.=/o:p> 
The thing I can't get comfortable with is help=ng with a top end property that would also be somewhat 
complicated.</=:p> 
If there was some borrowing thing now I could loan y=u money in the $2M to $3M range I could see doing that.

I do want you to feel good about your job both in to=ms of impact and compensation. 
We should keep talking to make feel good about the c=rrent piece and the 4+ year piece. 
However I am not comfortable making the current piec= include such a high end property.
