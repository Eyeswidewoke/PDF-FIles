| **Subject** | <br> <br> I am back in New York- it feels like a lifetime later. India can be <br> described as sublime chaos. Loud, swarming, by turns wafts of incense <br> followed by earth mixed with human and animal in equal measure - snake <br> charmers and dentists side by side on the curb. Honking horns followed by <br> an African silence.<br> EFTA_R1_01282444 EFTA02335273 The Taj is beyond - it is simply my most favorite building I have ever seen <br> - is dwarfs the Pyramids, or any other comparable - It is my no. one wonder <br> of the world side by side with the Wall in China. It was definitely worth <br> the effort.<br> It is just as well I did not stay in LA as I think I have returned with <br> with Ebola or Sars or some equally hideous thing. I am in bed miserable - <br> the only positive is I am 5 lbs down and counting. Forget any of those <br> stupid diets - simply go to India and drop like a stone in a matter of days.<br> Hope you have had an equally stimulating time minus, naturally,dnbsp; the deadly <br> virus.<br> <br> Gx </blockquote></html> EFTA_R1_01282445 EFTA02335274 |
