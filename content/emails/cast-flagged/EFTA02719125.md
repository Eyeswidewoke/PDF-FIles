DEAR FRIEND 
The End of White Christian Am=rica is Approaching 
In the on-line news magazine Alternet, Brooklyn writer and journalist Amanda Mancotte recently wrote — The a=d of 
white Christian America is nigh: Why the country's youth are abandoning religious conservatism=— As White Christians 
are now a minority in 19 states and America's growi=g racial diversity only tells part of the story. New data from the 
American Values Atlas shows that while Caucasians continue to be the maj=rity in all but 4 states in the country, white 
Christians are the minority in a whopping 19 states. And, nationwide, Ameri=ans who identify as Protestant are now in 
the minority for the first time ever, clocking in at a mere 47 percent of Americans and falling. 
The most obvious reason for this change is growing racial diversity. Most Americans still identify =s Christian, but 
"Christian" is a group that is less white and less Protestant than it has been at any time in hist=ry. The massive growth in 
Hispanic Catholics, in particular, has been a major factor in this shift in the ethnic and religious identity of this country. 
White Catholics used to outnumber Hispanic Catholics 3 to 1 in the 2000s, b=t now it's only by a 2 to 1 margin. 
=span style="font-size:12pt;line-height:107%;font-family:Georgia,serif"><=r> 
But another major reason religious diversity is outpa=ing the growth of racial/ethnic diversity is largely due to the 
explosive growth in non-belief among Americans. One in five Americans now identifies as religio=sly unaffiliated. In 13 
states, the "nones" are the largest religious group. Non-religious people now equal Catholics i= number, and their 
proportion is likely to grow dramatically, as young peopl= are by far the most non-religious group in the country. This 
isn't =ome kind of side effect of their youth, either. As Adam Lee has noted, the millennial generation is becoming less 
religious as they age.

These changes explain the modern political landscape =s well as any economic indicator. While not all white Christians 
are conservative, these changing numbers definitely suggest that conservative Christians are rapidly losing their grip on 
power. And while some non-white Christians are conservative, their numbers are not mak=ng up for what the Christian 
right is losing. And whether conservative l=aders are aware of the exact numbers or not, it's clear that they sense that 
change is=in the air. Just by speaking to young people, turning on your TV, or reading the Intern=t, you can sense the 
way the country is lurching away from conservative Christ=an values and towards a more liberal, secular outlook. And 
conservative =hristians aren't taking these changes well at all. 
To look at the Christian right now is to see a people=who know they are losing power and are desperately trying to 
reassert dominance befo=e it's lost altogether. The most obvious example of this is the frenzy of anti-abortion activity in 
recent years.Q=A0 Anti-choice forces have controlled the Republican Party since the late '70s, but only in the past few 
year= have they concentrated so singlemindedly on trying to destroy legal abortion in wide swaths of the country. In 
2011 alone, states passed nearly three times as many abortion restrictions as they had =n any previous year. 
None of this is a reaction to any changes in people=E2.4es sexual behavior or reproductive choices. It's not like there 
was a spike i= abortions causing this panic. In fact, the abortion rate has been declining. And despite continuing media 
panic over adolescent sexuality the fact is that teenagers=are waiting longer to have sex, on average, than in the past. 
Despite thi=, not only are you seeing a dramatic increase in attacks on legal abortion, the Christian right has expanded its 
attacks to contraception access, suggesting that something has worked them into a panic they believe can only be 
resolved by trying to reassert their religious and sexual values. 
The fact that these changes in attitude are rising al=ngside the growth of irreligiosity is not a coincidence. More perhaps 
even t=an the 1960s, Americans are in a period of questioning rigid sexual and religious mores, and concluding, in 
increasing numbers, that they are not down with guilt-trippi=g people for victimless behavior and demanding conformity 
for its own sake.=C20 Some of them-now a whopping 22% of Americans! — are leaving religion entirely. Some are 
continuing in their faith but choos=ng to interpret their values differently than Christian conservatives would li=e. 
And so we see Christian conservatives cracking down i= a desperate bid to regain control. They claim that they're being 
oppressed by increasing tolerance for reli=ious diversity. They have latched onto, with some success, the claim that 
"religious freedom" requires giving Christians the right to oppress others= The Republican Party is in complete thrall to 
the religious right, to the point where giving the Christian right one go-nowhere symbolic bill instead of another one 
created a major political crisis. 
The irony is that this panic-based overreach is just =aking the situation worse for the Christian right. One of the biggest 
reaso=s the secularization trend has accelerated in recent years is that young people see the victim complex and the sex

policing of the Christian right and it's turnin= them off. And they're not just rejecting conservative Christianity but the 
entire idea of organized religion altogether. In=other words, the past few years have created a self-perpetuating cycle: 
Christian conservatives, in a panic over changing demographics, start cracking down. In reaction, more people =ive up 
on religion. That causes the Christian right to panic more and crack down more. In the end, Christian conservatives are 
going to haste= their own demise by trying to save themselves. And as Mancotte says, =i>"not that any of us should be 
crying for them."

=span style="font-size:18pt;line-height:107%;font-family:Georgia,serif">T=e Myth of the Mutual Fund 
How Many Mutual Funds Routinely Rout the Market? Zero 
New York Times writer and podcast editor Jeff Sommer made a startlin= discovery based initially on a study last summer 
called "Does=Past Performance Matter? The Persistence Scorecard," conducted by S&P Dow Jones l=dices twice a year. 
The edition of the study that he focused on began in March 2009, the start of the bull market. The bull market in=stocks 
turned six last month, and despite some rocky stretches — it has generally been a v=ry pleasant time for money 
managers, who have often posted good numbers. <=p> 
The study in=luded 2,862 broad, actively managed domestic stock mutual funds that were in operation for the 12 
months through 2010.=C2* The S&P Dow Jones team winnowed the funds based on performance. It selected the 25 
percent of funds with the best returns over those 12 months — and t=en asked how many of those funds actually 
remained in the top quarter in each of the four succeeding 12-month periods through March 2014. The answer =as 
remarkably low: two. 
Just two funds — the Hodges Small Cap fund and t=e AMG SouthernSun Small Cap fund — managed to hold on to their 
berths in =he top quarter every year for five years running. And for the 2,862 funds as a who=e, that record is even a 
little worse than you would have expected from random chance alone. In other words, if all of the managers of the 
2,862 funds hadn't bothered to try to pick stoc=s at all — if they had merely flipped coins — they would, as a group, 
probably=have produced better numbers. Instead of two funds at the end of five years.Q=A0 Basic probability theory 
tells us there should have been at least three.

The study seemed to support the considerable=body of evidence suggesting that most people sshouldn'teven try to beat 
the market: Just pick low-cost index funds, assemble a balanced and appropriate portfolio fo= your specific needs, and 
give up on active fund management. The data in th= study didn't prove that the mutual fund managers lacked talent or 
that you couldn't beat the market. But, as =eith Loggie, the senior director of global research and design at S&P Dow 
Jones Indices, said in an intervi=w last week, the evidence certainly ddidn'tbolster the case for investing with active fund 
managers. "Looking at the numbers, you =an't tell whether there is skill involved in what they do or whether their 
performanc= is just a matter of luck," Mr. Loggie said. "= believe that many of them do have skill. But even if they do 
have it, based on how they've done in the past you really can't =redict how they will perform in the future." 
And although those two funds had manage to perf=rm splendidly during the last study — at the time of the article we 
were two weeks away from the completion of another 12 months since the end of that last study, and up to then it had 
been a mediocre for those two mutual funds, leaving Mr. Sommer to conclude that at the end ther= would be none. 
Here are the dismal statistics: The SouthernSun Small Cap fund has actually lost money for investors over the 12 months 
through Thursday. It was down 3.2 percen=, according to Morningstar, and for the nine months through December, it 
was in the bottom=quartile of funds in the S&P. Dow Jones study. The Hodges Small Cap fund h=s done better, gaining 
almost 6 percent through the middle of March. S.&.P Dow J=nes Indices says that put it in the third quartile — or 
second-to•worst one — =trough December. While it's
