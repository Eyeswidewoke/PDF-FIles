Hi E=a1 
It was purchased from ABC home and was displayed as a wall mir=or there. But I guess you can use it in a different way if 
it works. 
<=iv>Eva, are you back in New York? I have something for you and would like t= meet with you at any place that is 
convenient for you. I won't take more t=en 5 min. Please let me know. 
Thank you.
