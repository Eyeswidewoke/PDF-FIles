DEAR FRIEND 
Which Political Party Has the Best Record on the Economy4=pan> 
=img src="cid:ii_152229896c4dd838" alt="Inline image 2" width="472" h=ight="339"> 
The=graph above is the work of Economist Steven Stoft of40=A0zFacts.com. It shows the average annual rate of private 
sec=or job creation during each spell that a party held the presidency. =r. Stoft created this data by analyzing 72 years' 
worth of jobs da=a from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. 72 years was sele=ted as the time frame because each party has 
controlled the presidency for=36 of those 72 years. During those 36 years each, 58 million jobs ha=e been created under 
Democratic presidents, but only 26 million jobs under=Republican Presidents. That means that for all of modern 
American hi=tory, jobs have been created more than twice as fast when we have elected =emocrats to the highest 
office. 
Another way to look at the same data is to consider job growth i= terms of the percentage change in the number of jobs 
held during the peri=d that each party controls the executive branch: 
As on the first graph, the Democrats are cons=stently outperforming the Republicans. 
Republi=ans like to tell you that they are the true stewards of the economy, excep= that a study from two respected 
academic economists concluded that, since=the late 1940s, the economy has consistently performed better under 
0emocr=tic presidents than under Republican ones. =C2*And the gap is huge and the arithmetic on partisa= 
differences is actually stunning. <=pan style="font-family:Georgia,serif;font-size:12pt;line-
height:17.12000=8392334px">From 1949 to 2013 — a period when the White House was r=ughly split between parties 
— the economy grew at an average annua= rate of 3.33 percent, but growth under Democratic presidents averaged 4.3= 
percent and under Republicans, 2.54 percent. Jobs, stocks and living stan=ards all advanced faster under Democrats. 
<=span>0ver the whole period, the economy was in recession for =9 quarters; Democrats held the White House during 
only eight of those=quarters.

But isn't the story different fo= the Obama years? Not as much as you think. Yes, the recovery =rom the Great 
Recession of 2007/-2009 has been sluggish. Even s=, the Obama record compares favorably on a number of indicators 
with that =f George W. Bush. In particular, despite all the talk about Q=9Cjob-killing" policies, private-sector 
employment is eight million higher than it wa= when Barack Obama took office, six times the job gains achieved unde= 
his predecessor. The same pattern emerge= regardless of whether you look at the stock market, GDP growth, income 
gr=wth, debt as a percentage of GDP or if you compare how the U.S. economy pe=forms under the parties relative to 
our closest economic peers. The econom= simply performs better- much better- under Democratic leadership.<=p> 
Be=ng a Liberal Democrat, I would like to attribute the superior performance =f the economy under Democratic 
Presidents was mostly due to their liberal =olicies. But it is actually not totally true as most economist doubt=presidents 
can control the economy. So if presidents didn't =o it, who or what did? Blinder and Watson (authors of the study) 
march thr=ugh economic studies. Their conclusion: About half of the Democrats0=99 advantage reflected "good luck" 
— favorable out=ide events or trends. Three dominate. 
Globa= "oil shocks" — steep=increases in prices, which depressed economic growth — were the la=gest, because they 
hurt Republicans more than Democrats. They occurred in =973 (Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford), 1979 (Jimmy Carter but 
affecting Rona=d Reagan's first term) and 2008 (George W. Bush). Statistically, t=ey explain slightly more than a quarter 
of the Democratic-Republican gap.<=span>

Since President Barack Obama first took office: 
The economy has added nearly 8.4 million jobs — more than =ix times the number gained under George W. Bush. 
• 0=A0 
The numbe= of job openings doubled, to a record 5.7 million. 
• 0=A0 
Nearly 15=million fewer people lack health insurance coverage. 
• =C20 
Corpor=te profits are at record levels; stock prices have more than doubled. 
However, median household income was down 3 percent as of 2014, a=d the official poverty rate was 1.6 
percentage points higher. 
*0=A0 
The rate of home ownership has dropped to the lowest point in nearly hal= a century. 
=/span>The federal debt owed to the public has more tha= doubled up 107 percent. 
Republicans talk about economic growth all the time. They atta=k Democrats for *job*killing* government regul=tions, 
they promise great things if elected, they predicate their tax plan= on the assumption that growth will soar and raise 
revenues. Democrats are=far more cautious. Yet Mrs. Clinton is completely right about the record: =istorically, the 
economy has indeed done better under Democrats. Thi= contrast raises two big questions. First, why has the economy 
performed b=tter under Democrats? Second, given that record, why are Republicans so mu=h more inclined than 
Democrats to boast about their ability to deliver gro=th? Certainly no Democratic candidate would be justified in 
promisin= dramatically higher growth if elected. And in fact, Democrats never do.=C2' Republicans, however, always 
make such claims: Every candidate with = real chance of getting the G.O.P. nomination is claiming that his tax pla= would 
produce a huge growth surge * a claim that has no basis in =istorical experience. Why? 
For instance ev=ry Republican running for the Presidency talks about the bad Obama economy= except that the U.S. still 
has the #1 economy in the world and it is stro=ger in almost every measure than every other major industrialized 
country,=with the exception of China which is a state-controlled economy that most =mericans abhor. Looking at the 
metrics, (alt=ough the U.S. economy is still limping), it isn't<=span> n=arly as bad as Republicans claim... And here is 
why: 
<=mg src="cid:ii_150ca83c602d41a7" alt="Inline image 2" style="margin-=ight:0px"> 
Part of the a=swer is epistemic closure: modern conservatives generally live in a bubble=into which inconvenient facts 
can't penetrate. One constantl= hears assertions that Ronald Reagan achieved economic and job growth neve= 
matched before or since, when the reality is that Bill Clinton surpassed =im on both measures. Right-wing news media 
trumpet the economic=disappointments of the Obama years, while hardly ever mentioning the good =ews. So the myth 
of conservative economic superiority goes unchallen=ed. Beyond that, however, Republicans need to promise economic 
mirac=es as a way to sell policies that overwhelmingly favor the donor class.

It would be nice, if even one major G.O.P. candidat= would come out against big tax cuts for the 1 percent. And when 
the= suggest that the do, as Trump initially led people to think, we find after reading the small print this is not true. All 
of the major GOP play=rs have called for cuts that would subtract trillions from revenue. To mak= up for this lost 
revenue, it would be necessary to make sharp cuts in big=programs — that is, in Social Security and/or Medicare. But 
=mericans overwhelmingly believe that the wealthy pay less than their fair =hare of taxes, and even Republicans are 
closely divided on the issue.Q=A0 And the public wants to see Social Security expanded, not cut. So=how can a 
politician sell the tax cut agenda? The answer is, by p=omising those miracles, by insisting that tax cuts on high incomes 
would b=th pay for themselves and produce wonderful economic gains.<=p> 
As Paul Krugman wrote last month in a Washington Post op=ed — Hence the asymmetry between the parties. 
Democrats can =fiord to be cautious in their economic promises precisely because their po=icies can be sold on their 
merits. Republicans must sell an essentia=ly unpopular agenda by confidently declaring that they have the ultimate 
r=cipe for prosperity — and hope that nobody points out their histor=cally poor track record. Also what we do know is 
that government pol=cies do matter. Cutting food stamp, after school and programs for th= elderly can hurt tens of 
millions of men, women and children. And almost =very economist is in an agreement that Reagan inspired supply-side 
economi=s tax cuts not only caused the deficit to mushroom it accelerated economic=inequality, as well as squeezed the 
Middle Class. And if this is cal=ed being a strong steward of the country's economy.....Q=A0it ain't so....<=i>
