I spoke with her briefly yesterday and she suggested I send another email with more info on Jeffrey-for ease, .below is the same mail I sent later in the day! let me know if you need more details on exactly what Jeffrey would like to discuss: Hello Mr. Hawkins. Per Terri Fry's suggestion, we wanted to provide you with more details re Jeffrey Epstein. Jeffrey Epstein is great friends with Dr. Jim Watson and suggested the two of you speak. Jeffrey has funded brain work from the early nineties when he was a part of the Harvard Mind Brain Behavior committee. Jeffrey says to please feel free and reach out to Jim or Joit Ito at the Media Lab if you would like more comfort... Jeffrey would love to set up a time to speak whenever convenient. If you have any more questions, please do not hesitate to ask. Thank you, Lesley Assistant to Jeffrey Epstein > On Sep 13, 2017, at 11:38 AM, Jeff Hawkins wrote: > Hi > I didn't get the VM.
