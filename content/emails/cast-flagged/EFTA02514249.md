sor=y sorry I expect this natural disaster of a media shit storm will last the=month. like a hurricane or tsunami, little can 
be done to effe=t it. if you stand up now, it is not without risks, the=press only wants to complete its version of a 
salacious story, not hear t=e truth, so any denials will be met with a stronger wind of allegations&nb=p; . 
Unforrtunatley I think after its over this time , and it =ill be,= again, we will need to assess damage and begin a 
strategy=to rectify, modify, but it will not be the same. y=u are physically fine, as am I. I however recogninze that that 
= is little comfort at the moment. yes sara hirsh security clea=nave did not check , she was trouble and a liar. and I told 
her = in a nice way . the org is a fake,

I get it, just not doing so well today...../div> 
Lost my flying car opportunity, UPM, F=RST asked for no ties, my aviation clothing line partners cancelled our mt=g 
today, Xprize is probably next.. Dean just spent an hour talking to me o= the phone about how he was advised to react 
when press confronts him. He =as told by a crisis manager that it's a matter of time. And everyone is ur=ing me to get a 
lawyer and speak out if the claims are really not true. Ca='t process it at the moment, little overwhelmed watching 
everything spin o=t of control again
