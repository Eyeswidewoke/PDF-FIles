I called Jo Walin1
 today from AYH as I have not heard anything about the 
reduced slip rate from 1.16 to 0.91 as all the other boats pay. He said that he took this to his 
management and they could not make a decision so they forwarded to Andrew Farkas who will be 
calling you on this matter. 
Facts: 
a) Proposed Charge by AYH = 1.16 per foot x 55' x 30 days = 1,914.00 per month 
b) Proposed by RIC /LSJ to conform with all other slips = 0.91 per foot x 55' x 30 days = 
1,501.50 per month 
Net monthly difference = 412.50 per month 
Annualized = 4,950 per annum
