Rich says they are to start Oct. I (which is a Sunday) ...so I could fly them here Sunday Oct. 1 and they start training Oct. 2? He says he assumes they will need an apartment?...have you spoken to Jeffrey about this? Did we want to give them a studio? 8A or 11P? I can certainly ask Jeffrey these questions if you do not know...but I thought I would start with you! Please let me know. EFTA_R1_00958041 EFTA02221429 Thanks, EFTA_R1_00958042 EFTA02221430 |
