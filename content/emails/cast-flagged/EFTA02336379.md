| **Subject** | aup Jeff, Hope you are feeling better. I have found=the perfect solution. I spoke with aup (American Univeristy of Paris) and =hey told me I can transfer to their school in September from Marangoni. Th=y also told me that since I have a French Baccalaureat from my previous sc=ool which is considered very good I can skip a year and enter directlyQ=A0in 2nd year. For the Toefl they told me that with 81 I can enter bu= I should take some English extra classes. However, if I get 88 I don'= need them. I have lots of friends going there and all of them are very ha=py. It is very international and it is fully accredited. What do you think=? https://www.aup.edu <https://www.aup.e=u> 1 EFTA_R1_01296503 EFTA02336379 |
