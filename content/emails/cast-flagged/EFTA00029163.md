### Match 1
> From: To: ' Subject: RE: Draft RTC Date: Fri, 20 Aug 2021 12:41:02 +0000 Attachments: Maxwell RTC v8.docx Thanks! And really, no problem at all. I'm going to be on leave for the next two weeks, so I probably won't send your comments to until I'm back — so no rush at all. I've attached the latest version, just so you have the most recent one. Thank you so much for your help on this case!

### Match 2

From: Sent: Frida Au • ust 6 2021 7:29 PM To: Subject: FW: Draft RTC EFTA00029163 I hope all's well! Draft RTC in Maxwell attached. The team is going to have comments, I'm sure, as will the chiefs. If you like, I can send you wherever we land. And, of course, I'd welcome any comments you might have too, as an expert on this.
