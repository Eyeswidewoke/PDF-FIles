| **Subject** | Re: Artistic Tile Thassos Good afternoon Molly, We would like to order 50 square feet of the white th=ssos tile, that you gave me a sample of (picture below). Could you please k=ndly let me know if you have it in stock and what would be the lead time? 1= would go to the same address as the shower tiles we ordered from you earlier. My colleague Brice, who is managing this project is c=pied on this email and will work with you on this order. I am not sure if 1="x12" configuration would work or if we need a different size, Brice coul= you please advice on that part? Thank you very much!
