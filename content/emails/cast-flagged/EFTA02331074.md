If so, can they give Nobu the new =ead count as late at 5:30 (which is when the reservations are for?)

He will also show them =he front door where the car will be waiting for them at 9pm to take =hem to Treasure Island for the Mystere show. Jason's office number is cell is I know this will be a very =emorable for Mr. Epstein. I am sorry that I will not get a chance to =eet him on this trip.

A quick question for you...not sure if your =ervices would include something like this...but it is possible Jeffrey =ould like to attend the DEF CON conference at the Rio on Saturday =ug.lst ...we are told tickets can be purchased only with cash at the =oor. Tickets are available on Thurs and Fri but we have no one in =egas to go and purchase tickets for us (apparently, the line will be =uite long FYI)...do you have someone on staff that does this sort of =rrand thing? I have not even passed this idea by Jeffrey yet, but =hought it was worth asking you ...if you do, let me know the cost and I =ill pass it along to Jeffrey. » Thanks, » Lesley » Assistant to Jeffrey Epstein SIN >> <?xml version=.0" encoding=TF-8"?> <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"> <pl ist version=.0"> <dict> <key>conversation-id</key> <integer>17045</integer> <key>date-last-viewed</key> <integer>0</integer> <key>date-received</key> <integer>1375468091</integer> 2 EFTA_R1_01263721 EFTA02331075 <key>flags</key> <integer>8623750145</integen <key>remote-id</key> <string>5817</string> </dict> </plist> 3 EFTA_R1_01263722 EFTA02331076 |
