| **To** | Jeffrey Epstein > This ABC rug is still the closest I've found to the color you =ant. They had this floor sample silk rug which was 8x10 which was =10,000 with 20% off that price. They could cut it down to the proper =ize if you want it quickly. Otherwise, we could order the 6x9 size and =ave it cut down to 6x8 which would be the ideal size. The price tag =ays the 6x9 is $6400. Sacco didn't have anything in =tock expect some ugly traditional looking rugs with a bit of blue in =t. We can look into having them do a custom rug if you like to get any =olor and design you would like. The Rug Company had nothing with this =olor =ither. = 1 EFTA_R1_01225114 EFTA02318576 |
