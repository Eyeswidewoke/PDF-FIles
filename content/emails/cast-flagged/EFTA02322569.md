It is in a huge tent with a massive buffet=and tables in the middle surrounded by couch lounge areas where they bring=you hookas and more food and drinks. They stay eating till 2 or 3am. And th=s tent has dinner like this every night during Ramadan. And there are "pray=r rooms" right next to the bathrooms.
