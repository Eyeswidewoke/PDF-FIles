| **Subject** | Re: Jeffrey Epstein Thank you so much for the information, I completely lost the foresight in terms of timing, yes, let's keep the appointment at 4.30 PM on Thursday, I hope there will be nothing scheduled at this time next week. Thank you so much for your help! nr, 25 asr. 2017 r. s 17:15, Thursday Aug 31st is latest they can do stating at 4pm cut with Patrick then Huber will see you for color. Does this work for you? (they can't do a color correction late because they don't know how long it will take until they get a look at you...if you really need later, then you would need to go in one day so they can determine who long you would need...then you can go in on another day to have the correction done possibly later...but they are only open until 8pm , so if your hair will take 3 hours, then the latest you could make an appt for is 5pm) Please let me know if we can keep the 4:30pm on Thur. Aug. 31st. Thanks On Aug 25, 2017, at 3:27 PM, wrote: Dear It's me again :). I have contacted Jeffrey regarding a hair appointment that I wanted to schedule next week and he gave his permission and told me to contact you to organize it. Would you please be so kind to see if there are spots to see Patrick at Fekkai anytime soon (preferably in the evening)? I would like to have a cut and color correction (I'm hoping that the stylist will determine what exactly will be done when I get there, if anything at all). Thank you so much! nr, 25 am-. 2017 r.
