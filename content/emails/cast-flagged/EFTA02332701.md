| **Subject** | is this new? Come listen to a story bout a man named Ted South Dakota boy whose neck was kinda red Had a hippie ponytail and his boots were rather large Went and set up a little bidness in his garage Gateway that is - direct sellin - customer service Well the first thing ya know olc Ted's a billionaire Wall Street said, "Ted, you've really got the flair- Sell em on the web and on the phone from shore to shore But never never never try to open up a store" Nasty overhead - inventory nightmares Well the stock was doin fine, just movin right along Bubble floatin higher, Ted could do no wrong Market share was hummin, cow just waggin its tail And the fateful day arrived - Ted went retail Big cow spots - cute little outfits Well Tcd stepped aside to spend some time on his new boat Called in some city slickers to keep the cow afloat Then pop went the weasel, the stock started to grind And the slickers, it was learned, were robbin him blind Greed indeed. EFTA_IRLO 1278800 EFTA02332701 So he decided Californy was the place he hadda be But he kept most of the workers back home in Sioux City And quarter after quarter after quarter it was found That Dell and HP/Comaq were slappin Ted around. What to do, change in strategy, rebrand The products weren't selling and the marketing was poor They were losin money each and every week in every store Board of directors gasped like they were coming down with asthma So Ted came along and said The Answer Is Plasma Big Ole Teevees, lower prices So they started selling plasmas cameras games and MP3s Camcorders, stereos, DVDs and LCDs Folks got excited, anticipation getting high But when they saw the numbers all the Street could do was sigh Losses piled up, what to do So Ted bought off this Irvine company to step on in With a solid reputation for keeping costs thin Here they come, shareholders, and I'm telling ya now If you can't see it comin, the tail is gonna wag this cow.
