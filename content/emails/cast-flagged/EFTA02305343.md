| **To** | Jeffrey Epstein The black and white LSJ photo for 71st dining room can also be printed =n canvas and stretched. I'm getting quotes for this now from a few =ifferent places. Do you prefer for it to be printed on canvas instead =1 vinyl? So far I have a quote from Duggal which is $1764 to print on canvas, and =2500 to have it stretched. Since it's so large, they will have to =tretch it on wood surrounded by aluminum. I'm waiting on a quote from Coloredge Visual who has done all our large =rints in the past. They should be less expensive than Duggal. <?xml version=.0" encoding=TF-8"?> <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/Propertylist-1.0.dtd"> <plist version=.0"> <dict> <key>date-sent</key> <real>1333138386</real> <key>flags</key> <integer>8590195713</integer> <key>original-mailbox</key> <string>imap://sarahk525@mailmac.com/Sent%20Messages</string> <key>remote-id</key> <string>9735</string> <key>subject</key> <string></string> </dict> </plist> 1 EFTA_R1_01179539 EFTA02305343 |
