The reason I wrote to you is that your "pension" always arrives on the day before the last day or at the latest on the last day of every month yet, we are Friday 2 April and it has not yet reached my bank account which means it will not be there before Monday 5 or Tuesday 6 April. Perhaps you will look into the matter. May be your bank misunderstood your order? Isabel left last evening and Christine did not find my car papers so I had to ask DVLD, the AA etc for duplicates as I just cannot afford to run my car without papers! Because of security, there are constant police barrages and if you have not your papers on you, they give you 3 days to go in an impossible place to show them to the police! In spite of this set back, I loved having them. They are so different, Christine so warm, loving and giving all of herself to you, always giggling and optimistic about her presently dismal future, yet genuinely concerned for others, especially myself and her siblings, but remains slightly disorganised and vaguely scatter- brain. Isabel, on the other hand, so contained, more masculine, slightly aggressive like most people who live on their own and have no one but themselves to count upon, cool headed but also truly loving and efficiently concerned. It is amazing to have had so many children and yet so different, with basically in common their love of each others and of me and the love and respect you all kept for Dad! I'll be spending the week-end at Moulsford with a viree in Oxford where I am meeting the President of the Oxford Centre for Hebrew studies, Peter Oppenheimer who is a friend of mine and hopefully visiting Tilly's digs although I believe she may have 'gone down' for the term has ended! Last Saturday, isabel attended the boat race in the Chancellor's boat (the former minister and governor of HONG KONG, CHRIS PATTEN, and witnessed the disastrous loss by the Oxford crew whose Cox stirred them too close to the Cambridge boat so that their oars touched and almost unseated one of the Oxford crew which lost them the race! I watched it on Television , it was a disaster and Cambridge who was a strong favourite deserved to win anyway! With much love Ta maman EFTA_R1_01278914 EFTA02332741 |
