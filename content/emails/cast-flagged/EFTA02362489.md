Andrew - 
I hope you received my voice mail. 
We need more time to evaluate our ability to finance this deal which is a v=lue proposition you clearly want from us 
before you embrace us. 
We have made no decisions on who to work with until we know we have somethi=g to offer. 
You guys are clearly a key player and we are focused on that. 
I think we can have an answer on confidence around the financing appetite n=xt week. 
I wish I could move it faster. 
Speak early next week. 
Best
