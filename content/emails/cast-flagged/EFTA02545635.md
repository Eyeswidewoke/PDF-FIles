A MAN caught having sex with a donkey told a court the beast was actually a=20 prostitute who turned into an animal 
overnight. 
Zimbabwean Sunday Moyo, 28, was found by police officers performing a sex a=t on the donkey, who was lying on the 
ground tied to a tree, a court heard.=20 
He was arrested Monday in the township of Zvishavane and charged with bestiality, the New Zimbabwe newspaper 
reported. 
Admitting the crime, Moyo told the court: "Your worship, I only came t= know that I was being intimate with a donkey 
when I got arrested. 
"I had hired a prostitute and paid US$20 for the service at Down Town=20 nightclub, and I don't know how she then 
became a donkey."

He also claimed he was in love with the animal, telling the court: "I =hink I am also a donkey. I do not know what 
happened when I left the bar, but I am=20 seriously in love with the donkey." 
Moyo was remanded in custody until tomorrow and will be examined by two government psychiatrists.
