| **Subject** | Epson 9600 - in storage room on 5 The printer turns on perfectly and says "ready". I was unable to get it to w=rk wirelessly so I found a cord and wired my laptop in. I downloaded softwa=e on my laptop and attempted to print from it. Just keeps telling me there i= a communication error even though I have my laptop hard wired into it with=a USB cable. I left the cable I had used to link to my laptop in the printe= so it is clear how and what I tried. I apologise I did not have a better r=sult!
