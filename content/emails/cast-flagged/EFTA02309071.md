| **Subject** | Appliances Hey guys. I went to PC Richards yesterday to pick out new appliances forte I am having trouble finding a refrigerator which will fit t=e current dimensions of what's there. All the current ones are 28" wide by 2=" deep by about 65" high. I can't find anything that's 28" wide that isn't d=eper than 29 inches, in which case it would stick out more than desired fro= the cabinets. I did find one however that's 27.5 wide by 24 deep, but 75" h=gh, which is too high with the cabinet above the (ridge. I didn't have a ch=nce to specifically look, but wondering if it's doable to remove the cabine= over the fridge so we can fit a taller fridge in the space? I'm sort of at=a loss as to what to do about sourcing a fridge with the current dimensions=otherwise. <?xml version=.0" encoding=TF-8"?> <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/Propertylist-1.0.dtd"> <pl ist version=.0"> <dict> <key>date-sent</key> creal>1338817480</real> <key>flags</key> <integer>8590195713</integer> <key>original-mailbox</key> <string>imap://sarahk525@mail.mac.com/Sent%20Messages</string> <key>remote-id</key> <string>11262</string> <key>subject</key> <string>Appliances</string> </dict> </plist> EFTA_R1_01190518 EFTA02309071 |
