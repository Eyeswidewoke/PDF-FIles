| **Subject** | Amy Cassell Please see below and advise which flight Amy should take on Sat. ..the =:04 (this flight will be $200 change fee only) or the 7:40 (this flight =ill cost $200 change fee plus $420) Lesley, My original flights were with United. The last flight that they offer =s at 5:04pm (I would need to leave the city at 3:00pm), it's a $200 =hange fee (no additional cost for the ticket). If I change airlines, I can leave at 7:40pm, on American. Cost is $200 =hange fee for United (I can reuse the ticket on another trip) and $420 =or the ticket from American. I think it's safer to go with this option =o allow the most flexibility for Saturday. Let me know your thoughts.
