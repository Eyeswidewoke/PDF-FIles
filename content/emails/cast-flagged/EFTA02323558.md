These are made on Sago plathe =nd I do have a few pieces. They are not in great shape. However the =anels are easy to get as they still use them. It would just take time =o get them here. A elderly man called David from the village paints =hem. David does good work. I will attach photos of several photos of =avid's panels I put in a show and sale in Berkeley recently. =nfortunately/fortunately they all sold. I could ask David to make 30 =anels. It might be better to give the measurements of the area to be =overed as the panels vary in size.
