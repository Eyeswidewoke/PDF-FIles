## Match Contexts

### Match 1
> eparately because they were prepared by different offices: the hard drive was prepared by the vendor, and the CD was prepared by our paralegals. Because we are planning to put all productions onto a single hard drive, as you requested, the files from the CD will be included on that new drive, so Ms. Maxwell will have those files both on a CD and on a hard drive.

### Match 2
> lease let me know. Also, can you explain the difference between the hard drive and the CD? Did you just need a little more space than what the hard drive offered? Or is there a reason you put certain files on the CD? I note that the laptop does not contain a disk EFTA00017813 drive, so I assume Ms. Maxwell will have to use the prison computer to review the files on the CD?

Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) - discovery production Chris, I have asked MDC staff to provide Ms. Maxwell with the drive containing the November 9th discovery production and will follow up with them again about it. We can certainly make a copy of all productions to date on a single hard drive for Ms. Maxwell to review at the MDC. My apologies, I did not appreciate that you were requesting a full rep

My apologies, I did not appreciate that you were requesting a full reproduction of all past discovery. My understanding was that the reproductions contained on the November 9th drive would address your concerns. If you would prefer to have a single drive containing all prod

> from the MDC is that for security purposes, the laptop will be kept in a locker to which only two lieutenants have access. Those two lieutenants work Monday through Friday 8:30am to 3:30pm, which is when Ms. Maxwell will have access to the laptop. For the remainder of the 13 hours of review time, Ms. Maxwell may review her discovery on the MDC computer. The laptop is being provided to allow Ms. Maxwell to open files that she could not open on the MDC computer. 35 hours per week should be more than sufficient to review any excel files or other file types that cannot be viewed on the MDC computer.

> oduction and that you would verify that the files on that hard drive were readable on the new laptop. That way, we would not have to rely on a patchwork of prior hard drives which had a lot of problems. To be clear, I don't think the laptop solution you have proposed will solve the problems that Ms. Maxwell has been experiencing and is not consistent with what we discussed. If there is no way to load the full discovery on the laptop itself, then please advise if you are able to create a new hard drive that contains the complete production (without the highly confidential materials) that can be made

If there is no way to load the full discovery on the laptop itself, then please advise if you are able to create a new hard drive that contains the complete production (without the highly confidential materials) that can be made available to Ms. Maxwell in the MDC. Also, I have been informed by Ms. Maxwell, that the MDC told her today that she will only be able to use the laptop to review discovery from 8:30am-3:30pm on weekdays. That is only seven hours a day, as opposed to the 13 hours a day (plus weekends) that the BOP had agreed to before.
