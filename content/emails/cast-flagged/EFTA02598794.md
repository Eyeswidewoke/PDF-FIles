This is an outline that goes with Presentation I forwarding shortly 
Will send you my impression of where they are shortly 
> AdFin aims to become the industry's definitive source for programmatic me=ia intelligence and price verification. The 
company is founded on the beli=f that markets thrive with greater access to information...and programmati= media is no 
different. As our name implies, we have developed a platform=that integrates advertising and finance, advancing 
efficiency and bringing=financial-style trading intelligence to the programmatic media markets. Th= result.. advertisers 
spend smarter, publishers price smarter, and outside=players (e.g., financial analysts) participate smarter. And we 
believe thi= participation can extend to the development of derivative offerings and n=w ways to trade, invest and 
hedge risk in the advertising markets. The tan=ible benefits to ad buyers and sellers include: 
> • * Price Discovery: explore market pricing — spot, historical, trends 
> * Price Verification: verify whether prices paid are "fair", in li=e with market 
> * Benchmark Performance: Evaluate buys/sells/trades vs. internal and e=ternal benchmarks 
> * Identify optimal demand and supply partners and direct deal opportun=ties 
> * Build smarter strategies, plans and trading algorithms 
> We are actively working with industry players across the programatic medi= ecosystem. We'd love to demo our 
platform, share our vision and explore w=ys to work together to grow and evolve the programmatic markets into an 
ef=icient and effective financial-style marketplace.
