I've gott=n 2 other quotes from contractors that each came back with $22,000. I'm hop=ng if Penn's is less than this, JE will be OK with us going with him. I thi=k it's alot easier for all involved to use Penn, and we just have to convin=e JE that as long as we have all materials, etc, he can finish in 2 weeks. (=hat's the time frame Penn gave me). Also the tiles I'm ordering for 8H are q=ite large, 12"x35" so he said that will be alot faster to install. >»» I'm having all the materials delivered on Tuesday to the building, the= said curbside delivery. It will be the wall and floor tiles, grout, toilet= vanity, sink fixture and shower fixtures. (still looking for actual sink t=p, med cabinet and towel bar). How should they proceed with delivering the i=ems if they only deliver curbside? Is there someone who can help bring all t=e items up to the apt? We will have our painter in the building as well who=can help. >>>» >»» On Jun 1, 2012, at 11:51 AM, Anthony Barrett wrote: >>>» >>»» Did you meet? >>>>» >>>>» >>»» On Jun 1, 2012, at 9:24 Aawrote: >>>>» EFTA_R1_01189922 EFTA02308912 >>>»» He just responded.
