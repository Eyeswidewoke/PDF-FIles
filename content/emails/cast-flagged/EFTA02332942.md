| **From** | Taken by: HELEN on 04/28/2004 Phone. I decided in the end to sit down with Francis and Sally together re. the "missing" linens. In the end, the only things that Sally agreed are missing from the house are 4 bath mats. She says that it appears that 4 queen sheets are missing but won't admit that there were 9 and now only 5. She says she's not sure. She disputes the 4 missing bath robes and 2 master bedroom linens because she says it doesn't tally with her own list. Re. my clothes, I'm missing t- shirts and we are both missing sweatpants, sweat-tops and jeans. Can not conclusively say it is Sally. Can only tell you that Francis said she saw Sally wearing my vlothes. I can't see anything else missing in the house. In conclusion, she did probably take some linens. Can't see anything else gone from the kitchen or any where else. So really the evidence is inconclusive at best. This is all on Francis' say so and our own visual evidence of sheets in her room.
