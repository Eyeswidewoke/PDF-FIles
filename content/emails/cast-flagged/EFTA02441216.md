All of the numbers are on computer systems and have to be pulled out and organized. We have changed 
systems and revised our charts of accounts during the last 18 months, so the numbers need to be reconciled in 
order to ensure that they foot properly for different periods. Also, the person who is best equipped to do this has 
been on vacation and returns on Monday. 
This is not a huge process and I don't want to overstate the complications, but it does need some manual work 
because of the change in accounting systems and procedures. It would be difficult to have it on Monday 
morning, but we should be able to get it to quickly without a problem.
