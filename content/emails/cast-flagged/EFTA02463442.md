Jeffrey,

I am excited. I think there is potential for you to get=a large tax deduction and for both of us to have a lot of fun 
while we are=doing great work to advance the public school system in our country. =To put my cards on the table, I 
want you to understand I want no profit fr=m this master planned community. I will work for no compensation, bu= 
reimbursable expenses until it becomes real. Then, I would hope to =ave modest compensation from the non-profit 
developer. The key to be=able to build a school from scratch is having the huge profits normally ma=e by a master 
planned community developer and using that money to build th= capital expenditures in the early years. 
By Thur=day, I will send you a general outline of what I propose that we consider.=C24> In general, the concept 
is to use the state laws of New Mexico to fo=m a new town on Zorro Ranch. The new town would create a new school 
=ystem which will follow the state mandate and get the $9,752 per child fro= the state, but also we could tax its citizens 
an additional $5,000 to $10=000 in real estate taxes per house to go to the school system. Perha=s more importantly, 
we probably can enroll the guidance of the substantial=non-profit educational groups that have been, for years, 
outlining better =ays to teach. For example, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation inv=sted $4 billion to document how 
a child can learn best. 
The efficiency of building an educational system from the ground up =as enormous potential savings. For 
example, my mother, in 1921, move= to Stroud, Oklahoma to teach fourth grade in a school where my father was=a high 
school principal, teacher, and football coach. If they came b=ck to Stroud today, they would find they could step into 
the fourth grade =nd the high school classes with only a minimal adjustment. Try to th=nk of any substantial institution 
that is basically the same as it was 100=years ago. 
Obviously, the town does not necessari=y require the whole ranch and you should preserve, for your enjoyment, 
tho=e parts that are important to you. I will outline what I think needs=to be done now in my memorandum on 
Thursday.

In the early 90s, you showed me enormous =riendship and kindness. Since that time, I felt a

Court of Claims and in the Supreme Court, the judgment w= got was substantially less than the 10-year cost of our fight 
and, theref=re, much of my time was consumed with my own problems. 
The purpose of this email is to see if you still own all or part of Z=rro Ranch. If you do, I think we 
should talk, because there is an op=ortunity for you to potentially get a great reward out of that real estate=which 
would take very little of your time and probably none of your capita=. If you still have ownership and don't enjoy it as 
much as you =id watching Zorro on television as a child, either give me a call so we ca= discuss in detail or ask me to 
outline the concept in a longer email. 
I know you will always remain outrageous, brilliant, =nd quietly kind. I hope your health is good 
and there is still a spa=kle in your eye.
