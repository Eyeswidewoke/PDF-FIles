I =ust had the opportunity to interview a young lady Rebecca Dobson (resume a=tached) who I very much would like to 
hire. Her responsibilities would inc=ude office management, administrative oversight of real estate projects, HR (in 
office and would suggest househo=d employees as well) and general administration. She currently works at th= Wexner 
Office in Ohio where she has worked for the last two years and is =oving to New York because her husband is taking a 
job at Goldman Sachs. She is smart, solid, and energetic and c=mes with the highest recommendations. I expect she 
would make around $100,=00 all in. If you have any significant objections please let me know as so=n as possible as she 
is entertaining another offer. Thanks. Brad
