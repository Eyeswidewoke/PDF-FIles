| **To** | Subjec : e: e o r <br> I sent you an e mail right after you left me a message. I have fallen into Blackberry hell - my little faithful friend is corrupt and currently in the emergency ward - your e mail must have fallen victim - if not actually been the first..<br> Regardless here is what I said. I had not spoken to Doug until this morning. We kept missing ec others calls. The bottom line is that he needs to go and talk to his lawyers. The wheels for this type of a deal are going to be quite long I fear. Doug is away until Monday next week so I do not expect to hear much until the end of next week. The sticking point will be how much our partnership makes. I have gone around and around w/Doug on this issue and he feels 1 mill alone will be a hard sell and he thinks that his lawyers will insist on looking at other 'cheaper options' to achieve the same effect. We should talk about this. I will be around from next Tuesday for the whole week and then maybe with you in the middle east???<br> I am currently in Palm Beach where I have just landed. Should I go and see the Emerald guy? Let me know. I am on my phone - however you need to send me your US no. again.<br> Speak to you shortly I hope<br> <br> G<br> At 12:23 AM 3/17/2004 +0100, you wrote:<br> <br> EFTA_R1_01282462 EFTA02335284 <br> <br> <br> <blockquote type=cite class=cite cite>No news..good news"I i i<br> Where are you?<br> You are a virtual partnerl<br> Give me a call when you will have 2 minutes and tell me when you will be<br> free for a dinner.<br> very best<br> <br> Richard</blockquote><br> </blockquote></html> EFTA_R1_01282463 EFTA02335285 |
