| **Subject** | Re: Permit to export Hi =I, I just came back from TNT. I have paid for the Package. Just inform Paul that the consignment No. is GE734848262WW. I forgot his phone number, so I did not include it on the receipt. So he should just use the consignment number to pick up the permits from TNT Wewak. Cheers!
