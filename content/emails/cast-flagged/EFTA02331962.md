| **Subject** | Re: J. Epstein Thank you April! St.Thomas is one hour later than Miami, (they don't do =aylight savings there) so if he leaves tomorrow at 11am, I think that =hould get him into St.Thomas about 2:15p St.Thomas time! But if you =ould confirm that with his pilots, that would be great. Thanks for your =elp!

I don't know the exact time he will be landing, but I =hink that an 11am departure puts him there a little earlier than =:15pm.

Jeffrey forwarded me an email he had sent =o Dr. Merkin saying that is would be best if he could land tomorrow at =:15pm. I wanted to confirm if Dr. Merkin is in fact coming tomorrow, if =e will be landing at 2:15pm, and what the tail number is so I can =rrange for Mr. Epstein's helicopter pilot to meet him upon arrival and =ring him over to the island.
