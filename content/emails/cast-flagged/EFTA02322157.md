| **Subject** | Re: Russian business visas Yes, please proceed with the invitation. Can I decide once the invitation ar=ives at the consulate whether I need to process it in one, two or three bus=ness days? On Jan 4, 2011, at 11:24 AM, visas@rnto.org wrote: > Hi > Perfect! If you are traveling in February, we can go on with your multiple=entry 1-year visas. The process will be complete Feb 1 or 2nd depending if t=e invitation will be in the Consulate on Jan 26 or 27. 1 will know the daterfor sure on Jan 17. > If you need them at the end of Janurary, it is also possible since we can p=ocess the visas withe the Consulate earlier than the normal three business d=ys. It will be an additional $180 if we do it in 2 business days or an addi=ional of $280/each if we do it the next day. If you are good with the 3-day=processing with the Consulate, you don't need to pay anything extra. > Please let me know if I should go ahead with your invitations and visas. > Thank you. > Have a great day! > Visa section > Russian National Group > 224 West 30th.Street, suite 701 > New York, NY 10001 > Phone: (646) 473-2233, Fax: (646) 473--2205 > Original Message |
