What is 
story? Not too pretty. He was wearin a 
le 
knit leisure suit, matching trousers and a soft 
jacket, a black shirt, no socks and black shoes. Maybe 
Prince Andrew can get him to a good tailor. 
That look was tragic amid the palazzo's 14th century treasures. 
The other best friend staying their was Marie Bucellati and her handsome husband, Mr. Bucellati who actually 
designs their line. 
Marie was meant to many Lawrence °raft's son years ago, lost both parents and the Grail's are her surrogate family. 
She is another mid-level ex model and arrives today with her clothing line. 
Than there was a shoe manufacturer Luise Rossi married to Roberta. They gave Peter Brant, Tony Shafazi, Lawrence 
Graff and me a ride in their own boat after Sophia's 'Somewhere" from the Lido. 
He owns many of Warhols gold shoe drawings and I took Peter to their palazzo on the Grand Canal to see them. You 
would not know a shoe mart...but I tell you this as an example of how I will talk to anyone with their own boat (to save 
5100.00) and end up in their living room. 
There is an unspoken international club of NEW rich people. If you are in the same 20 watering holes they all 
frequent and can drop the names of 20 richer people, you are "in." (Of course advance people tell these new people that I 
run New York, and having nerver heard of me or the screenings, adopt me instantly.)
