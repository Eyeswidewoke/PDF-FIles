| **Subject** | Question for my favorite, trusted pilot :) yes he does! thanks for this info... So I have another question for you! Since you are my favorite, trusted pilot and after all... We flew to Orlando and as we were on our decent we experienced going through another planes wake! I have never been on a plane that dipped way left and then way right again...everyone was a bit disturbed by it including me and Ike! The flight attendant (who was standing in the aisle) explained what we went through...I must say it was a slow dip to left and then right...her explanation made sense to us...can you elaborate?!
