Pet=r Thiel's response to urban development. Neat to think about, cool p=ctures anyway. 
$1.25 million investment into this (sketchy) organ=zation on his part is probably too small to even build one of these but 
at=least he's trying! 
What I think would be cool would be to tr= this in Africa. Even cancer cells stop multiplying when you confine 
their=space. :) 
Mission: To=further the establishment and growth of permanent, autonomous ocean commun=ties, enabling innovation 
with new political and social systems.

• 
Ocean state would have no welfare, no minimum wage, and few restr=ctions on weapons 
• 
Platforms would house =70 people and hundreds could eventually join together 
PayPal-founder Pete= Thiel was so inspired by Atlas Shrugged - Ayn Rand's novel about free-mar=et capitalism - that he's 
trying to make its title a reality.4=pan> 
The Silicon Valley bi=lionaire has funnelled $1.25million to the Seasteading Institute, an organ=sation that aspires to 
launch a floating colony into international waters,=freeing them and like-minded thinkers to live by libertarian 
ideals.<=o:p> 
Mr Thiel recen=ly told Details magazine: 'The United States Constitution had things you c=uld do at the beginning that 
you couldn't do later. So the question is, ca= you go back to the beginning of things? How do you start over?' 
Life on the =cean wave: A design for one of the floating cities which Peter Thiel wants=to start constructing next year off 
the coast of San Francisco<=span>

Green land: An aer=al view of the city, complete with landcaped gardens. Mr Thiel believes ma=y of the islands could 
eventually be joined together 
=p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt=auto'> 
Design for living: This island eve= has a high-level helicopter pad. The cities would be constructed on oil-r=g like 
terminals 
The floating sovereign nations that Mr Thiel imagines would be bu=lt on oil-rig-like platforms anchored in areas free of 
regulation, laws, a=d moral conventions. 
The Seasteading Institute says it will 'give people the freedo= to choose the government they want instead of being 
stuck with the govern=ent they get'. 
Mr Theil, the venture capitalist who famously helped Facebook expand=beyond the Harvard campus, called Seasteading 
an 'open frontier for experi=enting with new ideas for government'. 
After making his first investment in the pro=ect in 2008, Mr Thiel said: 'Decades from now, those looking back at the 
s=art of the century will understand that Seasteading was an obvious step to=ards encouraging the development of 
more efficient, practical public recto= models around the world. 
'We're at a fascinating juncture: the nature of go=ernment is about to change at a very fundamental lever=/p> 
<=p> 
Light city: Peter Thiel cal=ed the project, Seasteading, an 'open a frontier for experimenting with ne= ideas for 
government' 
Mr Thiel said: 'the nature of government is about to chang= at a very fundamental level' 
Mr Thiel and his colleagues say their ocean state wou=d have no welfare, looser building codes, no minimum wage, and 
few restric=ions on weapons. 
Aiming to have tens of millions of residents by 2050, the Seastead=ng Institute says architectural plans for a prototype 
involve a movable, d=esel-powered structure with room for 270 residents. 
=p class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt=auto'>The long-term plan would be 
to=have dozens and eventually hundreds of the platforms linked together. 
Patri Friedm=n, a former Google engineer who is working on the project told Details tha= they hope to launch a flotilla 
of offices off the San Francisco coast nex= year. 
=Big ideas start as weird ideas,' Mr Friedman said. 
<= class=MsoNormal style='mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:=uto5He predicted that full-time 
set=lement will follow in about seven years. 
But while some Ayn Rand acolytes may think=the idea is brilliant, it's not without its critics. 
Margaret Crawford, an expert =n urban planning and a professor of architecture at Berkeley, told Details= 'it's a silly idea 
without any urban-planning implications whatsoever.' <=:p>

Mr Thiel told an audie=ce at the Seasteading Institute Conference in 2009 that: 'There are quite = lot of people who 
think it's not possible. 
'That's a good thing. We don't need to really worry=about those people very much, because since they don't think it's 
possible=they won't take us very seriously. And they will not actually try to stop =s until it's too late.'
