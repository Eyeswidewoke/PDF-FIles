**[WORD]:** in <jeevacationaamail.com> Cc: Bella Klein < I just ordered a mattress for Ehud as there was a leek in the ceiling of their apartment right over the bed...No other apartments have a king size bed so I needed to order them a new one. Purchased from Sleepy's and they will deliver same day! I have Andrew (superintendent) and Merwin helping out. Arina will need to purchase new duvet cover as they arc all stained...
