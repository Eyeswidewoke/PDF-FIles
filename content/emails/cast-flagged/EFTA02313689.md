Do you think this is Marc being =bstructive or acting on instructions from a difficult owner? Frankly I =on't understand why they need all this information. If an offer =s on the table they either accept it or ask for more. Once a price is =greed, then it's up to the buyer to perform. Only if the buyer =ails to perform should they start to be difficult. >>> >» Let me know if you want me to talk to him. >» >» As ever, >» Mark >» >» Sent from my iPhone »» On 26 Mar 2019, at 23:17, Karyna Shuliak rote: >>» »» Mark, I thought you should know that after weeks of back and forth = do not believe Marc Leon was serious about selling me the house. He =sked for documents, offers, bank statements. All was sent and each time =ore stories why nothing delivered by them. Anyway I've given up and =ill put an offer in on another house. »» Thank you for your help. >>» »» All the best, >>» »» Karyna >» EFTA_R1_01204236 EFTA02313689 >> <?xml version=.0" encoding=TF-8"?> <IDOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"> cplist version=.0"> <dict> <key>conversation-idgkey> <integer>48389</integer> <key>date-last-viewed</key> <integer>0</integer> <key>date-received</key> <integer>1553705317</integer> <key>flags</key> <integer>8623750145</integer> <kepremote-id</key> <string>15525</string> </dict> </plist> 2 EFTA_R1_01204237 EFTA02313690 |
