This Sunday at noon, C-SPAN ll's "Book TV' will air a sound-only version of Bill Clinton's remarks at a 
party last week in honor of Rep. Peter King's new novel, "Deliver Us From Evil." That's because 
cameraman Richard Hall was prevented from videotaping Clinton at the Dubliner bar. 
Hall told us he started rolling when Clinton showed up unexpectedly. After a few seconds, a King aide 
told Hall that Clinton's people wanted him to stop. Hall continued taping for another 15 seconds, until a 
strapping young man calling himself Doug him to stop. "The president is a private citizen and doesn't 
want cameras on him all the time," Doug barked. Hall assumed he was a Secret Service agent and 
complied. 
After his remarks, Clinton made a beeline for Hall. "Glad you're here!" the former president gushed. "I 
wish you had allowed me to tape your speech' Hall replied. A distressed Clinton asked, "What do you 
mean?" As Hall explained the situation, he heard Doug mutter, "Thanks a lot!" Then an apparently angry 
Clinton gave Doug hell. Nevertheless, Hall said, when he resumed videotaping, Doug came up and shut 
him down again. 
It turns out that Doug Band is Clinton's personal aide, not a Secret Service agent, and had no authority to 
stop C-SPAN's camera. We hear he's now remorseful, but Clinton press secretary Julia Payne declined 
to produce him. "It's well known all over the world," she said, "that Doug has left many a cameraman in 
his wake."
