The=e are a couple of areas where further development is needed...RF communica=ion frequencies change 
when the circuits are stretched, and dead skin and =weat have to be dealt with during long-term use. These aren't 
insurmountable complications, though. </=> 
Am =ttaching two related papers. Both from Science today. One describes in more detail the "electronic=second 
skin" and the other about "epidermal electronics."<=u> 
The=authors acknowledge medical applications but they seem most interested in =aking this into game 
controllers. :)

=emporary tattoos fitted with electronics make flexible, ultrathin sensors<=> 
By =a href="http://arstechnica.com/author/kyle-niemeyer/" target="_blank"> Kyle Niemeyer 
Mod=rn methods of measuring the body's activity, such as electroencephalograph= (EEG), electrocardiography 
(ECG), and electromyography (EMG), use electri=al signals to measure changes in brain, heart, and muscle activity, 
respectively. Unfortunately, they rely on bulk= and uncomfortable electrodes that are mounted using adhesive tape and 
con=uctive gel—or even needles. Because of this, these types of measurements=are limited to research and hospital 
settings and typically used over short periods of time because the contact= can irritate skin. 
The=e limitations may be at an end, however. New research published in Science describes technology that 
allows electrical measurements (an= other measurements, such as temperature and strain) using ultra-thin poly=ers 
with embedded circuit elements. These devices connect to skin without =dhesives, are practically unnoticeable, and can 
even be attached via temporary tattoo. 
All=of the necessary components of the devices, including electrodes, electron=c components, sensors, radio 
frequency communication components, and power=supplies, are set within an extremely thin (about 30 pm) elastic 
polyester sheet. The sheet has a low elastic =odulus (that is, it's flexible) and no noticeable mass (about 0.09 g), so =ou 
have a lightweight, stretchable membrane. 
Cir=uit elements (such as transistors, diodes, resistors) and sensors are cons=ructed with typical materials like 
silicon and gallium arsenide, but are l=nked using nanoribbon and micro/nanomembrane elements to allow extremely 
small but flexible designs. 
The=authors refer to their approach as an "epidermal electronic system&qu=t; (EES), which is basically a fancy 
way of saying that the device matches=the physical properties of the skin (such as stiffness), and its thickness matches 
that of skin features (wrinkles, cre=ses, etc.). In fact, it adheres to skin only using van der Waals forces—=he forces of 
attraction between atoms and molecules—so no adhesive mater=al is required. Between the flexibility and the lack of 
adhesive, you wouldn't really notice one of these attach=d. 
One=of the coolest aspects of this technology is the application method: tempo=ary (transfer) tattoo. Yes, the 
ones you used as a kid, where you hold the=transfer sheet with the design onto your skin then dampen it to dissolve the 
sheet. Here, they used water-solu=le polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) sheets in the same manner. 
For=a power supply, initial designs used silicon photovoltaic cells to generat= electricity, but these are limited to 
microwatts due to the small area. R=searchers also explored wireless inductive power, where an external transmission 
coil matches the resonance frequency=of a small inductive coil in the device (it's the same sort of tech that's=used in 
wireless device chargers). This opens up the door for applications=that need more power than solar can provide, or for 
devices that work in low-light conditions (under cloth=ng, for example). The authors also suggest future electrical 
storage using=capacitors or batteries. 
As =emonstrations, the authors used their devices to measure heartbeats on the=chest (ECG), muscle 
contractions in the leg (EMG), and alpha waves through=the forehead (EEG). The results were all high quality, comparing 
well against traditional electrode/conductive =el measurements in the same locations. In addition, the devices 
continuous=y captured data for six hours, and the devices could be worn for a full 24=hours without any degradation or 
skin irritation.

One=interesting demonstration that also suggests future applications was the m=asuring of throat muscle 
activity during speech. Different words showed di=tinctive signals, and a computer analysis enabled the authors to 
recognize the vocabulary being used.<=p> 
The=team even hooked one of these sensors up to a simple computer game (Sokoban) a=d used throat activity 
as the controller. Identifying each word took about three seconds using a MATLAB program, but=it had a higher than 90 
percent accuracy. While the potential videogame ap=lications are endless, you can also think of other areas, such as 
silent c=mmunications or better voice recognition software.
