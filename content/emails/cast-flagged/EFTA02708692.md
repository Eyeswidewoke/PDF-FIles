June 13, 2014 -- In=a high-profile speech <http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/29/us/politics/obama-foreign-poli=y-
west-point-speech.html> to Army =adets last month, President Obama tried to move beyond America's tumultuous 
adventures in Iraq and Afghanistan w=th a new doctrine all but forswearing the use of military power except in =he most 
dire of circumstances. 
Barely two weeks la=er, Mr. Obama has already found himself in those circumstances and seems o= the verge of 
ordering the American military to intervene once more in Ira=. While ruling out ground troops to save the beleaguered 
Baghdad government from insurgents, Mr. Obama is cons=dering a range of options, including airstrikes by drones and 
piloted airc=aft. 
The possible return=to Iraq, even in limited form, underscores just how much that forlorn land=has shaped Mr. Obama's 
presidency. It defined his first campaign for the=White House, when his opposition to the war powered his candidacy. It 
defined his foreign policy as he resolved to=pull out of Iraq and keep out of places like Syria. And it defined the leg=cy he 
hoped to leave as he imagined history books remembering him for endi=g America's overseas wars. 
Yet as much as he w=nted Iraq in the rearview mirror, the swift march toward Baghdad by Islami=t extremists calling 
themselves the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or IS=S, has forced him to reconsider his approach. As much as he wanted 
to leave the fate of Iraq to the Iraqis the=selves, he concluded that the United States still has a stake in avoiding =he 
collapse of a state it occupied for more than eight years at the cost o= nearly 4,500 American lives. 
"We have an inter=st in making sure that a group like 1.5.1.1., which is a vicious organizat=on and has been able to take 
advantage of the chaos in Syria, that they do='t get a broader foothold," Mr. Obama said on Friday, using an alternative 
name for the group, the Islamic State=in Iraq and the Levant. "There are dangers of fierce sectarian fighting =f, for 
example, the terrorist organizations try to overrun sacred Shia sit=s, which could trigger Shia-Sunni conflicts that could 
be very hard to stamp out." 
Stepping back, he c=ted the United States' own tortured history in Iraq and the desire not t= let American efforts there 
go to waste. "We have enormous interests the=e," he added, "and obviously our troops and the American people and 
the American taxpayers made huge investments a=d sacrifices in order to give the Iraqis the opportunity to chart a 
better=course, a better destiny." 
Still, he insisted =hat Iraq's leaders have to make the sorts of compromises that will bring=stability to their country, and 
stressed that he would not let their probl=ms consume the United States all over again. "We're not going to allow 
ourselves to be dragged back into a s=tuation in which, while we're there, we're keeping a lid on things,"=but Iraq's own 
political leaders are failing to address the underlying f=ssures dividing the society. 
Mr. Obama has long =een criticized by Republicans for pulling troops out of Iraq at the end of=2011 without leaving 
behind a small residual force. That was a timetable o=iginally agreed to by President George W. Bush, and Iraqi leaders 
at the time would not agree to immunity provisi=ns insisted on by the Pentagon, but critics argued that Mr. Obama 
should h=ve tried harder to extend the American presence. 
Moreover, they said=the president has not done enough to pressure Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al=Maliki to reconcile 
with the Sunni minority, and they said Mr. Obama's f=ilure to do more to help moderate rebels in next-door Syria has 
emboldened more radical Islamist forces who have sp=lled over into Iraq. 
Not only has the la=est eruption in Iraq revived those criticisms, but it has also exposed the=president's plan for 
withdrawing from Afghanistan to further questions. =r. Obama announced last month that he would end the combat 
mission there by the end of this year, leaving behind=9,800 troops, all of whom would leave by 2016. 
Republicans on Frid=y urged Mr. Obama to act decisively in Iraq, questioning why he wants to t=ke several days to 
decide. "We shouldn't have boots on the ground, but=we need to be hitting these columns of terrorists marching on

Baghdad with drones now," said Representative Ed =oyce of California, the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs 
Committee.</=pan> 
Representative Howa=d (Buck) McKeon of California, the chairman of the House Armed Services Co=mittee, said the 
president needed a broader strategy for containing the th=eat in the region. "There are no quick-fix solutions to this 
crisis, and I will not support a one-shot strike that lo=ks good for the cameras but has no enduring effect," he said. He 
added t=at the president should consider firing his national security team.=/p> 
From the other side=of the spectrum, Democrats expressed nervousness about becoming entangled =n Iraq just two and 
a half years after leaving. Even former Secretary of S=ate Hillary Rodham Clinton, who voted for the 2003 invasion as a 
senator but is now positioning herself for anot=er run for president, said she opposed the use of American force to help 
s=ve the Iraqi government without assurances from Mr. Maliki. 
"Not at this time= no," she said to the BBC in an interview recorded on Thursday. Mrs. Clinon, who if she ran and won 
would inherit the Iraq situation, said the Whi=e House should continue to reject Mr. Maliki's request for airstrikes until 
he has demonstrated inclusiveness. "That is=not a role for the United States," she said of military force. 
Liberal activists w=re more vehement. "For the last 12 years, Iraq has been Bush and Cheney=92s war," said Becky Bond, 
the political director for an activist group =ailed Credo. "But if the president decides to double down on George W. 
Bush's disastrous decision to invade Iraq by=launching a new round of bombing strikes, Iraq will become Barack 
Obama'= war." 
That would be the l=st thing Mr. Obama would want. For him, Iraq has been the template of ever=thing foreign policy 
should not be. He opposed the invasion as a state sen=tor in Illinois, and many of his decisions as president have been 
measured against the lessons he took from Iraq. To =im, the war proved that military intervention more often than not 
made thi=gs worse, not better. 
When he agreed to s=nd more troops to Afghanistan, he insisted on a timetable for pulling them=out. When he decided 
to intervene in Libya, he used only air power and mad= sure that NATO allies took the lead. When the Syrian civil war 
broke out, he resisted calls to step in even wit= air power or, for a long time, arms for the rebels. The longer he has bee= 
in office, the more skeptical he seems to have grown about the utility of=force as a means of changing the world for the 
better. 
Even as he acknowle=ged on Friday the possibility of using force again in Iraq, he put the onu= on Mr. Maliki and other 
Iraqi leaders to set aside sectarian differences =nd stabilize their country. "The United States will do our part," he said, 
"but understand that ultimately it=92s up to the Iraqis, as a sovereign nation, to solve their problems."</=pan> 
Still, those who ha=e spent time around Mr. Obama heard deep frustration in his voice as he sp=ke about the prospect 
of re-engaging in Iraq. "I can only imagine what=92s going through the president's head," said Julianne Smith, a former 
national security aide to Vice President Jos=ph R. Biden Jr. 
"He was just gett=ng to the point where he felt he could free himself from this agenda and n=t define his foreign policy 
solely on the last guy's," she said. "He=92s been keen not to use Bush as a reference point and get away from that and 
be more forward-looking and have a strate=y. And he was just turning a corner when this hit."

Barack Obama =nd Iraq: Cool calculations 
Jun 13th 2014 -- Av=iding aggressive questions is a hallmark of the White House press corps. S= it should be no surprise 
that reporters watching President Barack Obama m=ke an emergency statement on Iraq on June 13th failed to pelt him 
with the queries that lurk at the centre=of the debate over America's role in the Middle East. Namely: Mr Preside=t, did 
you help to bring these horrors about when you rushed to pull Ameri=an combat troops out of Iraq as quickly as 
possible? And, Mr President, does any part of you regret ignoring pleas=to arm and train non-extreme opposition forces 
across the border in Syria =ver the past two years? 
Instead reporters a=lowed Mr Obama to explain why American involvement in Iraq would be limite=, would take 
"several days" to be sent, would not involve any return o= ground troops and was conditional on Iraq's central 
government coming up with a "sincere" political plan to resolv= sectarian divisions. "We can't do it for them," Mr 
Obama said sever=ly. 
"Nobody has an=interest in seeing terrorists gain a foothold inside of Iraq and nobody is=going to benefit from seeing
