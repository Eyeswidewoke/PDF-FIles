1)1= my humble opinion you would do so much better buying a plot of land and th=n creating your own "Xanadu". It 
would be so much che=per than paying a large premium to someone else for their version, which wo=ld never be quite 
right. You have the team (Linda Pinto etc) who are very f=miliar with Morocco and I would be there to help. 
=ithin 2 years you would have created something far more imposing, stylish a=d elegant than those other offerings like 
"Dar Olaf" which h=s all the charisma of a Four Seasons resort.
