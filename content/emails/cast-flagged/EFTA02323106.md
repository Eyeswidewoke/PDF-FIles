| **Subject** | Re: Christopher Hyland Fabric If we could do one piece 9 yards, and one piece 8 yards that would be great. Can you please let me know what method of shipping you will be using and send a tracking number when you have it? Thank you! n 11:42 AM, Brandon Quattrone <mailto wrote: Hi Our mill has just notified me that the peice that they were going to ship has a cut in it. They do have 2 other peices that are unharmed, the only issue is that one peice is 16.7 yards and the other peice is 13.12 yards. Can you please advise if there is a way you would like your peices to be (i.e. 10 yards from one peice and 7 yards from the other) or if there is a better way you would like it to be broken down. Sorry for this inconvenience. Best, 2 EFTA_R1_01236676 EFTA02323107 Brandon Quattrone Christopher Hyland, Inc. 3 EFTA_R1_01236677 EFTA02323108 |
