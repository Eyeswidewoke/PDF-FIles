THE HASTY PUDDING INSTITUTE OF 1770 
The I lusty Pudding Institute of 1770's philanthropic mission is to provide educational and 
developmental support for all aspects of the performing arts for the underprivileged, to 
encourage satire and comedy, and to cultivate emerging and unrecognized talent around the 
world. The Institute is comprised of The I tasty Pudding Club (the oldest social club in the 
United States), The Hasty Pudding Theatricals (the third oldest theater group in the world, 
after the Comedic Franeaise and the Oberammergau Passion Players) and the l larvard 
Krokodiloes (the foremost collegiate a eappella group in the United States). Over the last two 
centuries, it has grown into a premiere performing arts organization, a patron of the arts and 
comedy, and an advocate for satire and discourse as tools for change worldwide.
