Can you ask him about a gift for Tancredi and Woody Allen? The watch he was t=inking of for Tancredi is clearly worn and used looking. I don't think it's=a very nice thing to give. He thought voice recognition software for woody,=but his assistant says he has never touched a computer, so that won't work.=lt might be easier for you to find something there to ship from Paris to Lo=don(for Tancredi) and Rome for woody.
