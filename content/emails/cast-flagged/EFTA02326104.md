So it should be ok for the =uests. There is a damaged side table there, which would need to be =enlaced with the same one from 11P and an extra table from 3M would go =o 11P. So we need to know when Leo can go to 3M, 11P and 10B at the =ame time to switch those tables. Please let me know. Thanks a lot!
