Most clean boards end up 6 to 9 inches wide, then very select ones go over 10 inches wide. To make them 5" wide, they have to cut them again, then do the tong and groove — this brings up the price around 20%. Your order would be around $1400 more for all same 5" wide. The continental oak is always cheaper because the wood is simply cleaner — no matter the tree location, oak in Europe does not have so many imperfections / knots. The finish is the same, limed satin poly, the wood is simply easier to source and cut.
