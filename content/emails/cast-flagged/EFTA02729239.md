MURKY WORLD OF CLINTON PAL 
New York Post. New York, N.Y.: Oct 20, 2002. pg. 010 
Abstract (Document Summary) 
Leslie Wexner, founder and chair of the Limited clothing-store chain, bought the place in 1989 for $15,000. 
[Jeffrey Epsteinj's mentor and one of his clients, Wexner is rumored to have sold the palatial digs to him for just 
$1. Epstein quickly spent $10 million to gut the place and completely redo the interior. 
SOCIALITE Samantha Boardman ditched her beau, Conde Nast editorial director James Truman, last year for 
man-about-town Todd Meister. According to our spies, Boardman ditched Meister after she caught him in 
flagrant° with a 19-year-old coed. But don't feel too bad for her. Women's Wear Daily reports Boardman has a 
new man - Vanity Fairs Graydon Carter. Truman must not be too pleased. When Boardman dumped him, he 
needed to recuperate at a Buddhist retreat upstate. Editorial meetings at Conde Nast must be a hoot these 
days. 
"DISCO Bloodbath" author James St. James is following up his notorious tell-all about killer club kid Michael Alig 
with another true-crime tome. He's shopping around "Killer Grandpa' his investigation into a lynching that his 
grandfather led in 1935. "My grandfather was a sheriff in Fort Lauderdale, and he lynched a black man that 
allegedly raped a white woman," James told us. "About 100 people gathered to watch, and they passed a gun 
around and everyone took a shot at the body. It became this big town secret, and I write about what really 
happened." James, a 1980s club kid who fell in with Alig's inner circle, is played by Seth Green in "Party 
Monster," the movie adaptation of "Disco Bloodbath." But James said he was "shocked" when he watched a few 
scenes of Green mincing it up with Macaulay Culkin, who plays Alig.

PAGE SIX'S scoop last month that mysterious money manager Jeffrey Epstein had flown Bill Clinton, Chris 
Tucker and Kevin Spacey to Africa on his private 727 has sent journalists all over town trying to find out just who 
Epstein really is. 
Vanity Fair has a reporter on his trail, but New York magazine beats them to the punch with a feature this week 
on Epstein's strange history. 
Epstein, 49, a former Dalton School math teacher from Coney Island, is said to manage $15 billion for super-
wealthy clients he'll only take on if they have at least $1 billion in assets. 
"According to people who know him," New York reports, "if you were worth $700 million and felt the need for the 
services of Epstein & Co., you would receive a not-so-polite no-thank-you." 
Noted mergers/acquisitions lawyer Dennis Block of Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft recalls trying to give 
Epstein a client whose funds were below the $1 billion cutoff. 
"I sent him a $500 million client a few years ago and he wouldn't take him," Block reports. "Said the account was 
too small. Both the client and I were amazed. But that's Jeffrey." 
Most Wall Streeters, however, aren't even certain what Epstein actually does for a living. "My belief is that Jeff 
maintains some sort of money-management firm, though you won't get a straight answer from him' says one 
powerful investor. "He once told me that he has 300 people working for him, and I've also heard he manages 
Rockefeller money. But one never knows. It's like looking at the Wizard of Oz." 
Some say that Epstein once quit his seat on the board of the Rockefeller Institute because he hates wearing a 
suit, supposedly telling a friend, "It feels like wearing a dress."

One power player who doesn't find Epstein to be all that hard to figure is Donald Trump. 
"I've known Jeffrey for 15 years,- The Donald tells the magazine. "Terrific guy. He's a lot of fun to be with. It is 
even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do. and many of them are on the younger side." 
Another thing Epstein - who's said to pocket at least $75 million a year in fees - and Trump have in common is a 
taste for extravagant living. Epstein lives in a 45,000-square-foot, eight-story mansion on East 71st Street.

Epstein quickly spent $10 million to gut the place and completely redo the interior. 
"I don't want to live in another person's house," Epstein told New York. 
Blind dater 
CHRIS Noth wasn't lonely on a recent trip to London. The "Law & Order" hunk was set up on a blind date with 
Rose Keegan, an actress and the daughter of historian Sir John Keegan. The two spent much of the evening at 
the Century Club, and they were chaperoned by Kyle MacLachlan, who is pals with Noth from their days on the 
set of "Sex and the City." MacLachlan is in London co-starring in a play with hemp-happy Woody Harrelson. 
'Rockets' soars 
"ROCKETS Redglare!" - a posthumous tribute to the late East Village actor and downtown icon - won the Grand 
Jury Prize for Best Documentary at the New York International Independent Film and Video Festival. Directed by 
Luis Fernandez De La Reguera, it features interviews with Rockets' pals Willem Dafoe, Matt Dillon, Jim 
Jarmusch, Steve Buscemi and Julian Schnabel. Rockets, the beloved 350-pound former bodyguard of punk 
legend Sid Vicious who appeared in several of 8uscemi's and Jarmusch's movies, died last year after years of 
drug abuse. 
Bizarre union 
BOB Crane was a sex addict, but his second wife, Pat Crane, didn't care. "He treated women like the rest of the 
world treats toilet paper. Who's going to be jealous of toilet paper?" she told "20/20" contributing correspondent 
Chris Connelly. Despite Crane's penchant for seducing other women and documenting his trysts on film and 
videotape, Pat insists: "We had a wonderful sex life. We had a wonderful marriage." Crane was bludgeoned to 
death in 1978 with a camera tripod. 
Plot device 
GAY writers love PAGE SIX. Everyone's favorite gossip column is prominently featured in the new novel 'The 
Night We Met," a romantically swishy comedy by Rob Bymes about a guy and his mafioso boyfriend. After 
making references to this page and The Post throughout the book, Bymes even attempts to replicate one of our 
items in the climax. Bymes' fictional item may lack the flawless prose of a real PAGE SIX scoop, but he does 
have us outsmarting yet another mendacious mouthpiece.

SEAN "Puffy" Combs confirmed our account of how Heath Ledger scuffled with his bodyguards at the 
VH1Nogue Awards after-party Combs threw at Lotus. "Heath is from Australia, and he parties hard now," 
Combs told "Access Hollywood." The two became pals on the set of "Monster's Ball." "He's coming at me, he's 
like. 'Puff, people don't know that we're the best of friends,' so it's like my security held him up for a second . . .
