| **Subject** | Re: OK got it. thank you. JE said of course you can use an apt for your friend. I can leave a =elcome letter for them with the doorman if you like? or I can just give =ou the apt. number and code. We have 4M and 30N free. 10N floors can be started anytime. I'm not sure the best way to deal =ith the furniture while it is being done though. Is there an empty apt =he furniture could be moved into while the floors are being done =erhaps? I'd like both the living room and bedroom to be just the wood =loors. On Aug 11, 2011, at 8:14 PM, A Barrett wrote: > I saw the sketch briefly.

I gave Penn the =esign over a week ago, he's been to see it in person 3 times and I =till have no quote from him or any indication when he can do the work. =effrey is giving me grief for not having it done yet as I also need to =ave my apt painted but can't until this is done. I've attached photos =f what it looks like now and a sketch of what I'd like done. Pretty =imple I think. I want the design from the sketch, but with 3 removable =rates going across so I have the option to cover the AC and shelves if = want. » Any suggestions for a contractor would be great. thank you.. » <DSC03957.jpeg> » <IMG_6172.jpeg> » On Aug 11, 2011, at 7:23 PM, Anthony Barrett wrote: >» Hi sarah, >» >» No problem on 10N -please let me know when this can be done. >>> EFTA_R1_01239175 EFTA02323861 >» On another note, please ask Jeffrey, I need an apartment for a good =riend for the Sept. 6.13, 2011. >» >» Thank you >» >» >» On Aug 11, 2011, at 1:13 PM, Sarah K wrote: >» »» Hey guys.
