RE: Re: 
Interesting perspective. I don't really see how it applies to Yang's work, but best I think would be to contact him 
directly. I presume he'd be most interested in discussing these matters, and I think you'd find him interesting to talk to. 
A smart and competent guy.

lye read ten of yangs recent papers. I firmly believe that his computer science perceptions , limits his breadth. many 
in the past years on probabilistic learning. probabilities in language. . etc. not rigorous to say the least. .. complex 
formulas that ignore that statistics are not probabilities. .. over and over.. to have probability one needs . symmetry, 
entropy, repetition. . the space of probabilities must be defined. the lens into that space needs to be constrained. the 
law of large numbers applies as a miracle formula to test the accuracy of prediction.. IT does not exist in language.. 
one can toy with the statistic generated all they like , but arriving at the structure of the space, using that method is 
hopeless. it is the mathematics of computation. thinking is not computation though it shares many similarities. 
thinking I believe requires exploring fully the space of what is NOT the answer. When the military was trying to better 
their targeting ability , years of trying to hit the bulls eye with missiles became easier when they turned the equation on 
its head , and focused instead of not missing. 1 minus the probability of failure. equals success.. biology seems to 
behave as exploring the space and eliminating what does not work in order to find the solution. computing goes 
directly for the target. all possible combinations minus the nonsense , equals coherent sentences.

I follow up to the point where you write "the organizing principle of the shape is language..." No doubt it can 
(partially) be described in language, but that's not what you mean. 
Zipf's law is a rank-frequency distribution. And also meaningless, as Mandelbrot showed 60 years ago. I hope 
Yang is clear about this. He surely knows.

Subject: Re: Re: 
it is my failing not yours. the old math requires numbers . too limiting. ( we can put a metric overlay on later 
in the chain) imagine a shape in real space. it is readily apparent if a line either fits on the shape or not . how do you 
know. ? you compare the line with the shape. your visual system allows the mental shape to either map onto or not 
onto the shape in a coherent manner. the shape is not an input device ,it is an object . the organizing principle of the 
shape is language, the shape is a collection of grammars. lines on the shape are either coherent or not. coherent ones 
are legitimate sentences . 
yang is flexible in his use of the term probability.. for example he in a number of papers refers to zipf as a 
probabiltiy distribution. i have checked a number of his papers after your last remark, I think it is a mistake. he 
means that after empirical measurement . for ex word frequency, . if ten times out of 100 the corpus has the word x. 
then he describes the probablility of finding the word as 10 percent . this is not correct. it is only the probablity of 
finding the word in the frequency list . but he is very accomplished at mathematical models.

Interesting image, but I don't see what it tells us about language. 
The problem looks to me like this, roughly. 
Take, say, the human visual system. There's a genetic component that determines that humans will 
have a mammalian and not an insect visual system, and much else. Same with other subsystems of the organism — 
"organs," "modules." Language in particular. The technical name for this component, whatever it turns out to be, is UG. 
UG therefore determines that certain systems are possible I-languages for humans, others are not. I presume that is 
what the "biological organizing principle" for language is. It's plainly not an input system, though it determines possible 
input systems for human languages. I don't see how we improve understanding by looking at it from this perspective. 
A minor technical problem, not serious, has to do with distinguishing digital infinity from continuity, like 
continuous lines on the surface of a hemisphere. 
I think you'll find Yang interesting.

1.1 will wait on valeria. we can craft a fun few days 
2, try this on but only if you get a moment , i know you are busy 
it appear to me that ""language" can be defined as the biological organizing principle that creates a 
shape space. "coherent sentences " are defined as those that fit on the shape. The projections on the sensory motors, 
allows communication. . There are an infinite digital number of sentences.that do fit on the shape , but orders of 
magnitude more, that do not fit.- to attempt a naive representation, imagine a hemisphere, ( symmetric), any 
continuous line drawn on its surface , is a sentence. there are infinite numbers of lines that can be drawn. however, 
trying to connect two points , directly without traversing the hemishpere is also infinitely possible but most solutions 
need to leave the surface. The principle that organizes the shape is NOT an input device. one can map inputs onto the 
shape but it is not THE shape , ex, a hemisphere bowl in 3 space, analogy, one can put marbles in the bowl and they 
will map a path to the bottom. but the shape of the bowl . determines how fast they move, and in which direction, . the 
shape of the bowl is the language. there is a shape for vision as well. . it exists without input, certain paths are more 
probable etc. 
3. I will contact Yang

Valeria's not here right now, so will have to check with her about late September. Really 
intriguing possibilities, and a delightful offer. 
On Yang, I read his work quite differently. He does make use of word frequencies and 
probability distributions, but as far as I am aware in pretty straightforward and innocuous ways. And he's quite 
sophisticated about these matters. Smart and interesting guy. You might want to contact him directly. 
I don't recall his using Zipf's "laws," but it wouldn't matter much. Mandelbrot showed back in 
the '50s that they were a statistical artifact, near meaningless. I was, incidentally, surprised to see how he dealt with 
this result in his autobiography. I think he called it his "Keplerian moment," or something like that.

Would be interested in learning more about your critique of the use of probability in 
language work, mostly by computational cognitive scientists, as far as I know. I've written critiques of it too, but on 
different grounds: failure to account for what they are trying to show, or even to understand the issue. There are, I 
think, some notable exceptions, like the recent work of Charles Yang, one of Bob Berwick's students.
