Edwina E-
■ 
Here is the latest plane manifest for the Africa trip. I don't anticipate any 
more changes with respect to President Clinton and his staff. The CBS 60 minutes 
crew and Dan Rather is still not confirmed for the Capetown to Johannesburg leg. 
Let me know if you foresee any problems or concerns with where we now stand. 
Cheers, David
