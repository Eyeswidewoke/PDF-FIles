Trial date set for lawsuit against billionaire sex offender Epstein 
Jane Musgrave Palm Beach Post Staff Writer 
5:08 p.m Thursday, July 6, 2017 Central Palm Beach County 
WEST PALM BEACH 
A trial that promises to offer the first public airing of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein's 
activities with teenage girls at his Palm Beach mansion is to be held in December, a Palm Beach County circuit judge 
agreed Thursday. 
The malicious prosecution lawsuit that attorney Bradley Edwards filed against the Palm Beach 
billionaire has been on hold for years while various appeals were filed. With the issues resolved by the Florida Supreme 
Court last month, Circuit Judge Donald Hafele said the jury trial should begin Dec. 5. 
While attorney Jack Scarola, who represents Edwards, had put President Donald Trump on the 
witness list, he has said he won't need Epstein's fellow part-time Palm Beacher to prove his case. The legal hurdles he 
would face to try to force a sitting president to take the witness stand are unnecessary, he said. 
"We can prove our case without Donald Trump's testimony," Scarola said in May. 
Scarola claims Epstein sued Edwards in 2009 to punish him for representing roughly a half-dozen 
women against Epstein. The women claimed Epstein paid them for sexually charged massages at his mansion when 
some were as young as 14. Epstein eventually dropped his lawsuit against Edwards, but the state Supreme Court 
recently ruled Edwards could still pursue the 64-year-old politically-connected money manager for malicious 
prosecution. 
As part of a plea deal in 2008, Epstein settled the lawsuits that more than two dozen young 
women, including Edwards' clients, had filed against him. The settlement agreements were confidential. 
When he agreed to plea guilty to charges of solicitation of prostitution and soliciting minors to 
engage in prostitution, he also agreed not to contest the women's claims. In what Edwards and others have described as 
a "sweetheart deal," Epstein served 13 months of an 18-month sentence. He was allowed to leave the Palm Beach 
County jail during the day to work, but he has been forced to register as a sexual offender.

That deal is the subject of a separate lawsuit now pending against the U.S. government in 
federal court. Edwards claims the U.S. Attorney's Office violated the federal Crime Victims Rights Act by signing off on 
the deal, which allowed Epstein to plead guilty to minor charges in Palm Beach County Circuit Court. In exchange, federal 
prosecutors said they wouldn't pursue charges against him. 
In court papers, federal prosecutors recently disputed Edwards' claims, insisting they kept 
victim's informed as the nonprosecution agreement took shape. They said many of the victims refused to testify. They 
claimed they negotiated the deal because they wanted to assure that the traumatized young women received money to 
rebuild their lives and that Epstein would be forever branded a sex offender to protect other young women. 
Edwards is to file his response to their claims by the end of the month. 
Details of Epstein's lifestyle were expected to be divulged in a federal courtroom in New York 
City in May. But on the eve of trial, the defamation suit Edwards filed against Epstein's longtime friend, British socialite 
Ghislaine Maxwell, was settled. The terms are confidential. 
Edwards filed the suit on behalf of 
who previously came out of hiding to claim 
that in addition to abusing her, Epstein let his high-placed friends use her as a sex toy. The men 
identified, who 
denied the allegations, included former President Bill Clinton and Great Britain's Prince Andrew, both regular guests on 
Epstein's jet. When Maxwell called 
claims "obvious lies," Edwards sued her. 
While all the dozens of other lawsuits Epstein has faced have been settled, Scarola vows the 
malicious prosecution one will go to trial.
