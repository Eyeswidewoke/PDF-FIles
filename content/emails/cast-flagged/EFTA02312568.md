I am sure you are aware that this "real estate contrac=" is highly irregular for Americans. 1.

We have bought many properties, including through Christies a=d a commission was always paid by seller. 3. The due diligence on a lichtenstein co. will take months.&nb=p; 4. We would have to be indemnifie= for all taxes due to morroccan government on transfer and unknown li=biltiles of the co., especially as you might imagine, this purchase w=uld be very high profile. 5. 1= there a title on file? who would guarantee title transfer?
