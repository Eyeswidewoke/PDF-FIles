## Match Contexts

### Match 1
> From: To: Cc: Subject: RE: delivery of hard drive to MDC for discovery production to inmate Date: Wed, 05 Aug 2020 20:34:33 +0000 We have a hard drive with loaded discovery that we need to deliver to Ghislaine Maxwell at MDC. Could you please let us know what the current protocol is for that? Also, it's our understanding that hard drives with discovery materials for inmates needs to be non-encrypted (and not have a password for access), is that also correct? We're hoping to get these materials to her tomorro
