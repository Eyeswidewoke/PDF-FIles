I removed all emails, but yours, from profile. So no more worries, juts when Bella or Karyna or any other authorized person calling fro travel, they will have to provide their emails. Regards, Natalia (Natasha) Molotkova Centurion Relationship Manager Hours: Mon through Friday 9AM-530PM EST HI Natasha...hope you had a nice vacation... Sorry to bombard you but.... Over the weekend I had to book flights and for some reason, once again, the flight confirmation EFTA_R1_00960378 EFTA02222578 emails were sent to other people besides me!! To, •as sent to Karyna Shuliak and private...he does not want ANY flight confirmations sent to anyone but me (if I am the one that booked the ticket) I realize sometimes Karyna books her own travel and of course, she needs to receive her tickets...BUT she is not to receive any other tickets for anyone whatsoever. Jeffrey was livid about this...I spoke with Raphael this past Saturday about asked to speak to a manager/supervisor and he wouldn't put me through until I told him what it was all about...then I never spoke to the supervisor as he told me it is really you that must help me here. Please can you speak to IT re this glitch..) am petrified that all these tickets we have coming up this week from Russia to Paris will somehow resurface and get emailed to someone in our 'list' of emails... We really need to rectify this issue! Thank you so much as I know you understand this is truly a GIGANTIC issue! Lesley Thank you for your email. I am currently out of the office.
