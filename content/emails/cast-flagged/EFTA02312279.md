To =ake them 5" wide, they have to cut them again, then do the tong and =roove — this brings up the price around 20%. Your =rder would be around $1400 more for all same 5" wide. The =ontinental oak is always cheaper because the wood is simply cleaner — =o matter the tree location, oak in Europe does not have so many =mperfections / knots.
