Please, just let them know that these 2 apartments are slightly unfinished at the moment, and also there are some mirrors left on the floor waiting to be hang. I hope they can excuse that. Also, I believe the apartments might need some vacuum and dusting. Thank you! Both Apartments are studio's codes are: 8A: 11P I will scc if I can ct someone over to vaccuum and dust but not sure I can make it happen! > On Jul 8, 2017, at 1:05 PM, Dave Rodgers M> wrote: > Hi > Do you have two apartments available from Tuesday through Friday morning? > Thanks, > Dave EFTA_R1_00951581 EFTA02218842 |
