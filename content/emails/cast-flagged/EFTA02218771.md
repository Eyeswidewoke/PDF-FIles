I don't have plans at the moment to be in NYC next week (I'm currently in Seattle, just back from a performance in Norway). But I will be in Rockport, MA for a concert on June 25...is there any chance that he might be around the Boston area at that time? If he'd like to meet, I'd be more than happy to get out to NYC next week to see him, though! Thank you! -Charlie wrote: Hello Charlie. Jeffrey Epstein would like to meet with you!
