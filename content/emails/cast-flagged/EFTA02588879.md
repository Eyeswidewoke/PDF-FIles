Jeffrey, 
Not to be missed. Seriously. One of two hot projects fo= September. Second invitation later. Could use some 
help. At farm, check i= over the weekend: 203-266.5930 <tel:203.266-5930> . 
The EDGE Master Class on art for the weekend of September 26-28th is co=ing together. I am pleased to invite 
you to attend as a guest of EDGE. As =ith all EDGE events, there are no charges other than taking care of y=ur hotel 
reservation. The event will be held at Cavallo Point, a hi-end re=ort, 21 miles from SFO in Fort Baker, near Sausalito, 
Californ=a and just across the Golden Gate Bridge from San Francisco. See: =A0http://www.ca=allopoint.com/ 
<http://www.cavallopoint.com/> 
The class will be led by Hans Ulrich Obrist (aka =9CHUO"), co-director of London's Serpentine Gallery in Hyde 
Pa=k, who, in 2009, was ranked #1 in the annual "Power 100" l=st by ART REVIEW Magazine of the most powerful 
people in the art worl=. (He was ranked #2 in 2010, #2 in 2011, #10 in 2012, qnd #5 in 2013). He=E2 s considered to be 
the world's most influential modern art=curator, and certainly "the" most connected person in=the contemporary art 
world. The Serpentine, which just brought on Michael =loomberg as Board Chairman, is the center of London's cultural 
sce=e. 
A number of artists and/architects will accompany HUO. The first to con=irm is the one at the very top of my list: 
Marina Abramovia. the #1 p=rformance artist in the world ("the performance queen") =A0has confirmed that she will 
attend. Do not miss this! I know you are bus=. Get unbusy. Repeat: Do not miss this!!

"In the 21st century," HUO writes, "Silicon Valley co=ld become the home of an ambitious institution, an art 
centre which can bu=ld bridges between art and technology. Today, information and communi=ations technology are 
the world's key growth industries. Now, then= is the time for art to take its rightful place at the heart of the
