On =hu, Apr 19, 2018 at 1:46 AM, Ramon Alonso rote: Dear Je=frey, I would appreciate if you could answer some of these questions in or=er for us to be on the same page and clarify some doubts we have: 1. We understand that master retreat should have a small &=uot;owner's kitchen" nearby for eventual light snacks and light c=oking. Should this kitchen be part of the master retreat (same level) for =our personal use or can the ladies' kitchen service you and them? 2. Should the ladies kitchen be completely enclosed or=can it be open or semi-open into their living/dining room areas? 3. Will you eventually visit the ladies' living areas o= it is exclusively for their use? Seating/Dining in their area should be c=nsidered only for four people? 4. I am aware you =entioned that the master retreat windows will not be opened so we will mak= sure to use fixed panels and nothing sliding but Im a bit confused about =our expectation for this room's facade. Should it be more mass than wi=dows like your current bedroom or should it be more glass and light like t=e image in the presentation? 5. During our =ast visit we discussed about putting the ladies' residence where the e=isting pool deck is; however, as we discussed today, it might still be too=close to the master retreat. We are exploring the possibility to send them=up to where the existing solar panels are, in order to have more privacy b=t to keep the driving distance short. Does this make sense to you? 6. Do you like the concept of having 4 identical rooms su=rounding a new small pool/sunbathing area for the ladies' private use?=Or do you prefer that each room is somewhat unique? 7. We will design much nicer/open bathrooms that the ones you saw drawnr=however, do you want them to have open showers/tubs? Or everything should =e indoors? EFTA_R1_01180994 EFTA02305957 8. One of the four rooms/baths still h=s to be larger, or we should keep them all similar in size? =/div> Tomorrow we will have another team meeting and Im positive that =e will have some more questions but these will help in the mean time. I apologize for the confusion caused by some of the =nfinished images/drawings we sent today; we are sure that shortly we will =e able to show you much better progress. kind reg=rds, R=mon Alonso President <https:=/docs.google.com/a/radyca.com/uc?id=0B0ftZXiu_APTRENONm1WMDZJNTA&exp=rt=download> 1450 Brickell Ave. chttps://maps=google.com/?q=1450+Brickell+Ave.%CrX,A0+Suite+2190+%C2%A0+Miami+FMC2%A0=3131&entry=gma il&source=g> =span style="color:rgb(102,102,102)">Suite 2190 <https://maps.google.com/?==1450+Brickell+Ave.%CrAAO+Suite+2190+%C2%A0+Miami+FL%C2V0A033131&ent=y=gma il&source=g> Miami Fl. 33131 =AO This e-m=il, and any attachments thereto, is intended only for use by the addressee=s) named herein and may contain legally privileged and/or confidential inf=rmation.
