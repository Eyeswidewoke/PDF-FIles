| **Subject** | CHB Engines Dear Ms. Maxwell: Larry V. just informed me that Mr. Epstein will be using the GIl next week for NY. Is he staying on schedule of being there by Sun. (13th) night and staying through Wed (16th)? If this stays true I can have the GIl engine changed Mon (14th) and Tues (15th), back at TEB Tues night. Dalla Airmotive has agreed to Pay for our fuel, rental pilot (2 days, if one our guys is in training), and crew expenses. They think we are doing this to better accomodate their schedule not ours. Please forward this to Mr. Epstein quickly so that we may secure a loaner engine, if he agrees. Your help is greatly appreciated and please call me with any questions. Sincerely: Larry M.
