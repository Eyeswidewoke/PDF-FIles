All of the previous correspondence between nd Helen, Jeffrey's assistant, was private so am not sure they understood each other correctly if the ticket was requested by Jeffrey for Sunday. Just to avoid the inconvenience and confusion, I would like to let you know that she's aiming to go to the island on Saturday morning and come back Monday morning, if that's possible and is still awaiting for the approval. Please let me know if that's okay. <IMG_6968.JPG> Thank you, nu, 21 aur. 2017 r. B 14:09, Hi M. May I please have passport details? Jeffrey would like me to purchase her a ticket to the island for this Sunday Aug. 27th. Thank you, Assistant to Jeffrey Epstein EFTA_R1_00955320 EFTA02220213 |
