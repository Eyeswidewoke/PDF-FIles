She said she can do a trial this Sunday and Monday during her days off and if that goes well she will give 2 weeks of notice to the current family because it'= not fair for the current family not to give notice . Let me know, if you would like her to give a trail this Sunday and Monday. As for the other candidate not sure who it is. I will forward your email to my coworker.
