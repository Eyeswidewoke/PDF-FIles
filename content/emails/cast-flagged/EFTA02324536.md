| **Subject** | Re: Epstein =nvoice Thank you Brad, I'm trying to figure out if it makes more sense to ship them to =1 or NJ. Would it be possible for you to give me the approx. weights and =izes of the rugs when they are rolled up? Would they be rolled up long ways or =hort ways? I'm just going to get a quote from Tropical Shipping to see how =uch they would charge us to have them taken from their NJ location to their =stl:state w:st="on">Florida location. Thank you!
