| **Subject** | Lock your keys in the car? Sgt;&gt:(I haven't tried this, but passing it on anyway, sounds good to me.) .Sgt;&gt: &gt;&gt;If you lock your keys in the car and the spare key is home, call &gt;&gt;someone on your cell phone. Sgt;&gt: &gt;&gt;Hold your cell phone about afoot from your car door and have the other &gt;&gt;person at your home press the unlock button, holding it near the phone &gt;&gt;on their end. Your car will unlock. Saves someone from having to drive agt,&gt:your keys to you. sigt;&gt: Sgt;Sigt:Distance is no object. You could be hundreds of miles away, and if you agt;&gt:can reach someone who has the other &quot;remote&quot; for your car, you can agt;&gt:unlock the doors (or the trunk!) &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Editor's Note * It works fine! We tried it out and it unlocked our car &gt;&gt;over cell phone!) EFTA_R1_01281618 EFTA02334649 |
