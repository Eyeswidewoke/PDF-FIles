So, I issued new one way coach at 1006.20. New ticket number 5558652544230. So she will have to check in again (online). Ticket from yesterday, in business, more expensive, will be voided, just working with Aeroflot to cancel check in status. So, will put on Mr. Jeffrey's account 60 000 points (equivalent of $600.00).
