For several reasons, I prefer the deal=with you. Nothing related with money or fees. =very additional day increases the risk to loose the deal. Did your bank send the requested letter about the origin of the funds ?=l know this is ridiculous due to the quality of the buyer, but it is now re=uested by the banks. Any comments about the document=. Kind regards 1 EFTA_R1_01204675 EFTA02313829 |
