You can go to<br> any of the watch booths in fact you will probably have to go to several to<br> get the 50 I am now after. The shops if I remember rightly were on the 5th<br> floor. If you see any great handbags Gucci. Hermes, Versace, Fendi up to<br> 10/12 you can buy those or great belts, in fact just about anything that<br> you like that looks fun stylish and something that I can give as a gift and<br> have it be appreciated.<br> <br> Thank you again -<br> <br> Gx<br> <br> At 03:49 PM 9/11/2002 +0800, you wrote:<br> &gt;We went to Shanghai and I could not find&nbsp; the watches there.&nbsp; I will go to<br> &gt;Shenzen in the next week or two and will them there.&nbsp; I wish I knew what<br> &gt;shop you went to in the shopping center.anbsp; I asked Carolyn Wu who did the<br> &gt;advance there and she said someone from the consulate in Guandong province<br> EFTA_R1_01282206 EFTA02335091 &gt;took you shopping so I can't find out exactly what shop you went to.&nbsp; There<br> agt;are many of these places in the shopping center so it really should not be<br> &gt;hard at all.&nbsp; You might fed ex me one of the watches so I can see exactly<br> &gt;what it is like.<br> &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't worry about it though as the photos came out quite well.
