I have cooked for two days for Ms Maxwell, mon=ay and tuesday. I spent today getting things ready to send off to LSJ, Stew=and steaks and some equipment. At 71st we have started going through all the old plates=and making room for the new plates in the kitchen. When can we expect to se= the new plates? I would need your help to figure out what s=ays and what goes as far as whats there and maybe find new homes for a few t=ings... some sets are missing alot of peices, some are kind of dated, and s=me are fine to still use. Here are a few things I found that might be good to have=around for snacks and dinners to switch things up a bit. You have the great=eye for this stuff and know what works in the house. To recap our conversation i thought it would be nice to go toward= a classic but modern kind of feel. Elleven Madison Park, Corton, Jean Goer=es all do this really well.
