Dear Fouad, 
Dear Lisa — 
You are invited to join us at Dialog 2014 -- a two-day bipartisan retreat discussing how to change the world. 
There will be no speeches ... just many moderated break-out discussions of 
6.15 people on various topics. And we design the agenda around your ideas and needs. 
Please let us know if you would like to join us, 
/- Peter Thiel and Auren Hoffman/ 
p.s. and yes, we know Dialog 2014 is 16 months away, but we are giving you a chance to sign up now 
*DETAILS*: 
You're invited to join us at the Dialog Retreat ... 150 people to change the world ... a participatory and entrepreneurial 
conversation on changing the world. 
The *Dialog//sparticipants aren't modest. We want to change the world. 
But we don't want to spend our time being in a large audience listening to winded speeches. There are no speakers. No 
panels. All attendees participate in break-out facilitated discussions. And we *limit the discussion to only 150 global 
leaders who can have an impact now and emerging leaders who can help implement the plans we develop. 
*Dates**:*March 13-15, 2014 
*Location:* Sundance Resort, Utah (40 minutes from the Salt Lake City 
airport)
