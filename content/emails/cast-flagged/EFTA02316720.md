Went to design district today and will go back t=morrow. I found this rug in The Rug Company. They stock it in various sizes= If you like it, they can look into having 2 of them bound together to make=the size we need.(15'x17') I will get pricing for which sizes we would need=to do this if you like it. It's really thick and plush and soft, all white m=rino wool. They claim it won't smell if it gets damp. This particular rug i= 12'2" x 9'2" for $12,935 minus 20% for designer discount. 1 EFTA_R1_01216913 EFTA02316720 |
