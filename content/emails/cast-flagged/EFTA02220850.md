| **From** | Jeffrey E. Sent Tue 9/12/2017 5:42:15 AM Update. The island is very very bad. will take 2 years to make decent . infrastructure landscaping structures roads. wiring irrigation etc. . st thomas airport will not be open for another week. people on the island not allowed out of their houses. curfew due to violence. ! surprise Palm Beach , no power yet , no one at all allowed on the island yet, due to power lines down. it will be a mess for a long time. hopefully mostly landscaping. Unfortunately this leaves me no place to get peace and quiet except 71 st and the Ranch. . so starting thurs. 71 street will need to be under new rules. I do not want any construction repairs done while I am there. We need to make the second floor peaceful and the house quiet. the little secret room will be for meetings. I will try to move up from the dining room to the tiger room . I need staff well dressed and quiet. . In that regard the only person in the house from 8- 5 will be lesley and house staff. This is unless specifically required to help with a lunch or a dinner. I expect fewer deliveries no noise and I want the staff to know except for time set aside if nec I prefer little conversation. . package room and things will wait to be sorted on weekends unless urgent. . Dinners can no longer have the gang in the kitchen. we all need to understand PEACE AND QUIET. . I will have to make signifigant changes to many things. The business in the island will be dramatically different , if it survives. finding people to rebuild is very difficult as florida st barts and much of the caribean will all be looking for the same people and material.
