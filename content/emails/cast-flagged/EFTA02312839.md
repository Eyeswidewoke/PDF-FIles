I used Slate for my apt and they did a pretty good job. We shall see if they are consistent.

Karyna may need to come to NY tomorrow and there were no direct flights left. I have the mattress order form somewhere in my email. I will contact them tomorrow and let them know to deliver. I will be atEin the morning as Michael is returning and Andrew is going to come and look at my bathroom for Penn to do. The cleaning lady from today was awful, I cant stand constantly having to babysit and when I went back into the apartment she was sitting on the sofa eating a bag of chips. So I will pop into 8H tomorrow as I would like to see the difference in caliber of Slates people. She was supposed to do my bathroom and kitchen tomorrow but I really want to cancel, I would even rather just get it done myself. Would probably be faster! I may also have to go up to Columbia tomorrow morning to meet someone on Karynas behalf. Karynas says she ordered a sofa from Room and Board.

I'm having 8H cleaned tomorrow by Slate, the new place I'm trying out. All appliances should hopefully be in by Friday. Karyna, have you ordered a couch yet? EFTA_R1_01201841 EFTA02312839 |
