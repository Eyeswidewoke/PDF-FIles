| **From** | G. Max Sent Sat 1/1/4501 5:00:00 AM It is the year 2032, and a father and his son walk the streets of lower Manhattan. Approaching the site where the WTC used to be in the end of the 20th century, the father sighs and comments, "to think that right here usedto be the Twin Towers..." The son, not understanding, asks his father: "What are the Twin Towers?" The father smiles and looks at the son, and explains, "The Twin Towerswere two huge buildings that used to be here until 2001, when the Arabs destroyed them." The son looks up to his father, and asks, "And what are the Arabs?" EFTA_R1_01280798 EFTA02333969 |
