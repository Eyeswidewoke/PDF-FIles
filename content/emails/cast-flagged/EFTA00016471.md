USDC SONY DOCUMENT ELECTRONICALLY FILED DOC 0: DATE FILED: 11/11/21 20-CR-330 (MN) OPINION & ORDER ALISON J.

### Match 3
> t is especially so here where the crux of Dr. Rocchio's expected testimony is the effect that grooming behaviors have on the minor, not the perpetrator's mental state when performing the behaviors. Second, the Court finds that Dr. Rocchio's opinions are relevant to the Government's case against Ms. Maxwell. Two points of law bear mention here. For one, as the Second Circuit has explained, expert testimony cannot "constitute evaluations of witness credibility"—that is, expert testimony is inadmissible if it "comment[s] directly, under the guise of expert opinion, on the credibility of trial testimo

> o the facts before it." Id. (quoting 9 EFTA00016479 United States v. Duncan, 42 F.3d 97, 101 (2d Cir. 1994)). For the reasons already provided, the Court finds that fit is satisfied here. Third, the probative value of Dr. Rocchio's testimony is not substantially outweighed by 403 prejudice to Ms. Maxwell. The Court finds that Dr. Rocchio's testimony would not unduly "'simplify' an otherwise complex case" or mislead jurors by a supposedly infallible expert. Dkt. No. 386 at II. Dr. Rocchio's opinions speak only to concepts and will not (and indeed may not) suggest that the jury find any alleged vi

> stimony would not unduly "'simplify' an otherwise complex case" or mislead jurors by a supposedly infallible expert. Dkt. No. 386 at II. Dr. Rocchio's opinions speak only to concepts and will not (and indeed may not) suggest that the jury find any alleged victim witness to be credible or to find Ms. Maxwell guilty. The more general nature of Dr. Rocchio's opinions, which the Court heard in detail at the Daubert hearing, therefore mitigates its prejudicial effect. Telles, 6 F.4th at 1097. It is the jury's role to determine whether and how Dr. Rocchio's opinions apply to the facts of this case and th

> t unduly prejudicial. As discussed, the jury may extrapolate from the opinions that the presence of a third party creates the atmosphere of trust that can facilitate grooming. Moreover, as the Government explains, Dr. Rocchio's testimony is still relevant because the Government alleges both that Ms. Maxwell "in fact participated in sexual abuse of minors" and that she "conspired with a predator who groomed and sexually abused minors." Dkt. No. 397 at 27. The Court therefore denies the Defense's motion to exclude Dr. Rocchio's testimony except as to the opinion that the presence of a third party ca
