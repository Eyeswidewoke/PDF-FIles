Thank you for the opportunity to review your proposal for a convening of experts to discuss how we can 
most effectively address and prevent pandemics. I asked several colleagues to carefully review your 
proposal, particularly in light of the work we are doing related to Ebola. 
During this process, I learned that many of the groups in IPI's proposal are already in discussions with 
Gates Foundation staff about pandemic preparedness and response in the lead-up to the World Health 
Assembly and G7, where it will be a key topic. For this reason, as well as the number of high-level 
meetings our staff have already committed to, we regret that we cannot provide the requested support. 
However, if IPI moves forward with a convening, please let us know if you would like a Gates 
Foundation representative to attend. If that is the case, we will do our best — but please understand that 
scheduling may be an issue given that our teams involved with Ebola and the larger pandemics issue are 
quite stretched during this time. 
Again, thank you for thinking of us, and for the opportunity to support your proposed convening. We 
deeply appreciate the partnership that the foundation has with IPI overall but specifically in support of our 
polio eradication work.
