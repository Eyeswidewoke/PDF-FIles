Hoping a direct flight would get him in somewhat early on the 21st...he can depart on 23rd on a direct flight anytime this date... Please check pricing on a room at the Mariott as well ...we might not need a room (as Kevin may just stay in one of Jeffrey's bungalows)...but I'd like to know so I can tell JE the price...thanks . • I ._.• the Centuno_nca,c1 web*tte To learn more about e-mail security or report a suspicious e-mail, please visit us at a O 2015 American Express.
