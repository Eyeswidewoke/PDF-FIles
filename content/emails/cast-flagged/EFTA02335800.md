| **Subject** | EFTA_R1_01283310 EFTA02335800 I am back in New York- it feels like a lifetime later. India can be described as sublime chaos. Loud, swarming, by turns wafts of incense followed by earth mixed with human and animal in equal measure - snake charmers and dentists side by side on the curb. Honking horns followed by an African silence. The Taj is beyond - it is simply my most favorite building I have ever seen - is dwarfs the Pyramids, or any other comparable - It is my no. one wonder of the world side by side with the Wall in China. It was definitely worth the effort. It is just as well I did not stay in LA as I think I have returned with with Ebola or Sars or some equally hideous thing. I am in bed miserable - the only positive is I am 5 lbs down and counting. Forget any of those stupid diets - simply go to India and drop like a stone in a matter of days. Hope you have had an equally stimulating time minus, naturally, the deadly virus. Gx EFTA_R1_01283311 EFTA02335801 |
