I'm here. Kahneman is visiting as is Sendhil Mullaination. 
We're selling Sendhil's book (coauthored with Eldar Shafir) next week.

The Packing Problem: Time, Money, and the Science of Scarcity By Sendhil 
Mullainathan & Eldar Shafir 
The economist Sendhil Mullainathan and the psychologist Eldar Shafir 
are stars 
in their respective disciplines, and the combination is 
greater than the sum of 
its parts. Their project has a unique feel to 
it: it is the finest combination of heart and head that I have seen in 
our 
field. Together they manage to merge scientific rigor and a wry 
view of the 
human predicament with a passionate commitment to deepen 
our understanding of 
the psychology and economics of poverty and to 
motivate us all to do better. 
—Daniel Kahneman, Professor of Psychology, Princeton University; 
Recipient, 
2002 Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences 
Sendhil Mullainathan and Eldar Shafir are a powerhouse duo. I 
consider Sendhil 
to be the most interesting young economist in the 
world. He can do anything, 
from abstract theory to field experiments 
in poor, rural India. Eldar Shafir is 
the most brilliant psychologist 
in the field of judgment and decision making to 
come along since 
Kahneman and Tversky. Both of them are amazingly personable 
and 
articulate. You can't ask for a better combination of authors to 
present 
their ideas to the public. 
—Richard Thaler, the father of Behavioral Economics; Director, Center 
for 
Decision Research, University of Chicago Graduate School of 
Business; Coauthor 
(with Cass Sunstein), Nudge: Improving Decisions 
About Health, Wealth, and 
Happiness. 
Sendhil Mullainathan is a brilliant young economist who is tackling 
some of the 
most important questions in economics. Why do poor people 
often make choices 
that keep them poor? Why do some busy people make 
choices that keep them too 
busy? Both questions involve decision 
making under real or perceived scarcity. 
Classical economics assumes 
people are entirely rational actors, and thus has 
no answer to these 
puzzles. Sendhil is expanding the new field of behavior

economics to 
analyze these questions, with profound impact on both our academic 
understanding of economics and public policy.
