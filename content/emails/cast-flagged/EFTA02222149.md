Tha you so much for our email, I just heard back from that she's waiting for the answer from her employer if she can leave from Saturday to Monda basicall over the weekend). All of the previous correspondence between Jeffrey's assistant, was private so am not sure they understood eac of er correctly if the ticket was requested by Jeffrey for Sunday. Just to avoid the inconvenience and confusion, I would like to let you know that she's aiming to go to the island on Saturday morning and come back Monday morning, if that's possible and is still awaiting for the approval. Please let me know if that's okay. <IMQ6968.JPG> nit, 21 am.. 2017 r. s 14:09 Hi May I please have . assport details? Jeffrey would like me • purchase her a ticke o e is an or this Sunday Aug. 27th.
