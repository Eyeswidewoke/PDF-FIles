| **Subject** | Re: appt with Dr. Rosenwaks Thanks Kristin, I've only attached the first 2 pages as I am not married. The reason I'd like to see Dr. Rosenwaks is to freeze my eggs. I'm 33 and unsure if I want kids and would like a back up if I get too old. My boyfriend said he will fertilize the eggs as I've EFTA_R1_01208426 EFTA02314961 heard there is a better success rate if the eggs are fertilized before freezing. Please let me know if there is any other info you need in order to make the appointment. Thank you. 2 EFTA_R1_01208427 EFTA02314962 |
