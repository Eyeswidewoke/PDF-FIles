> the handheld camera, restricting her use of an already small confinement area. Her use of the laptop has been restricted. She is invasively surveilled while showering. Her cell is cold and precipitation accumulates on the concrete block walls. Over the holiday weekend, a third blanket, used by Ms. Maxwell to keep herself warm, was removed leaving her cold; and she now has the onset of a cold. The blanket was returned the next day, after complaint was made by counsel. The open-mouth, wanding, pat-down, and in-and-behind ear searches continue, with more frequently than other inmates are searched.
