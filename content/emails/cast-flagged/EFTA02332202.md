I may be hanging out with Chris, this boy Jive started seeing a few weeks ago. Would love to see ya sometime. I know I won't be going to nuts on Sunday night because I have a job on Monday am. I have to atop going out drinking before i have jobs the next day! (I did that last night). Mattheiu and Micah broke up, so i now have my little trouble maker roommate back! Yeay! We went to Starlight for a bit a few nights ago. I can't imagine having a better time than the last, so it's sort of weird to go there now. The people where not that pretty that night. Superstitious about what? Give me a ring when you like and we can get together sometime either on Sunday or probably better during the week. What have you been up to?
