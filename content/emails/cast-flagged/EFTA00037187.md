## Match Contexts

### Match 1
> some hoops, we will likely be seeking to interview Epstein's attorney, who was responsible for a lot of the transactions, and appears to have made efforts to structure transactions, so as to avoid SAR's etc.. As that time come closer, I will reach out to you. Finally, as mentioned, to the extent Maxwell changes her tune, and seek to be more cooperative, we would love to have you ask some questions for us, regarding her understanding of JE's relationship with Deutsche Bank.
