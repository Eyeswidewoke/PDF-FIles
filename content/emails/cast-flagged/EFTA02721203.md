Heading Into Talks With Iran, 
U.S. Sees Hopeful Signs 
Mark Landler 
May 18, 2012 — American negotiators, heading into a 
crucial round of talks with Iran over its nuclear 
programnext week in Baghdad, are allowing 
themselves a rare emotion after more than a decade of 
fruitless haggling with Tehran: hope. 
With signs that Iran is under more pressure than it has 
been in years to make a deal, senior Obama 
administration officials said the United States and five 
other major powers were prepared to offer a package 
of inducements to obtain a verifiable agreement to 
suspend its efforts to enrich uranium closer to 
weapons grade. 
These gestures, the officials said, could include easing 
restrictions on things like airplane parts and technical 
assistance to Iran's energy industry, but not the 
sweeping sanctions on oil exports, which officials said 
would go into effect on schedule in July. 
The oil sanctions, which the Iranians are seeking 
desperately to avoid, are one of several factors that

EFTA02721204

American officials believe may make Tehran more 
amenable to exploring a diplomatic solution. In 
addition, the recent decline in oil prices has magnified 
the pain of the existing sanctions on Iran; a new 
government coalition in Israel has strengthened the 
hand of its hawkish leader, Prime Minister Benjamin 
Netanyahu; and Americans believe that recent blustery 
statements from Iranian officials are laying the 
groundwork for concessions by Tehran. 
None of this guarantees success. Several officials 
played down the prospect of a major breakthrough 
from the meeting on Wednesday, which will include 
Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China, in 
addition to the United States. Mr. Netanyahu on 
Friday repeated his skepticism that there would be any 
progress. 
But American officials said that at a minimum, the 
Baghdad meeting should be a genuine test of Iran's 
willingness to do more than talk. "They're nervous 
enough to talk," said a senior administration official, 
speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the 
delicacy of the negotiations. "Whether they're nervous 
enough to act, we don't know yet." Another senior 
official said, "We have a tail wind going into this." 
For President Obama, the stakes are huge. A 
successful meeting could prolong the diplomatic dance 
with Tehran, delaying any possible military 
confrontation over the nuclear program until after the 
presidential election. It could also keep a lid on oil 
prices, which fell again this week in part because of 
the decrease in tensions. Lower gasoline prices would 
EFTA_R1_02205125 
EFTA02721205

aid the economic recovery in the United States, and 
Mr. Obama's electoral prospects. 
In a sign of the increased diplomatic efforts, 
the International Atomic Energy Agency said Friday 
that its director general, Yukiya Amano, would travel 
to Tehran on Sunday to try to negotiate access to a 
military site where Iran is suspected of having 
conducted tests on nuclear-weapons triggers. It would 
be the first visit by the agency's head to Iran since 
2009, and it could add to the momentum in Baghdad. 
"The Iranians are in the position of needing to pursue 
diplomacy, if anything, even more than they did 
before," said Dennis B. Ross, one of Mr. Obama's 
senior advisers on Iran until last year and now at the 
Washington Institute for Near East Policy. "It's not 
like they have any other good news right now." 
Moreover, Mr. Ross said, Iran's recent statements 
signal that its leaders are preparing their domestic 
audience for concessions. Iranian officials have 
declared that the West has effectively endorsed Iran's 
right to enrich uranium, a step they portrayed as a 
major strategic coup. American officials insist the 
United States has not done that and has been 
deliberately ambiguous about whether it would ever 
grant Iran the right to enrichment. 
Still, as Mr. Ross said, "if you're looking for a way to 
present a compromise, you want to present it as a 
victory." 
Like other experts, he added a cautionary note. After 
an initial meeting in Istanbul last month that served 
mainly to test if Iran was willing to talk seriously 
EFTA_R 1_02205126 
EFTA02721206

about its nuclear program, the United States and its 
partners must now get into the kinds of nitty-gritty 
issues that torpedoed previous negotiations with Iran. 
The major powers' initial goal is to halt the activity 
that most alarms Israel: the spinning of thousands of 
centrifuges to enrich uranium to 20 percent purity, 
which is within striking distance of the level needed to 
fuel a nuclear weapon. That would buy time for 
negotiations over the ultimate fate of a program that 
Iran claims is for peaceful energy purposes, but that 
the United States and Israel fear is in pursuit of at least 
a nuclear weapons capability. 
In addition to halting enrichment, officials said, Iran 
must agree to ship out its stockpiles of 20 percent 
uranium and to cease operations at an enrichment 
facility buried in a mountainside near the holy city of 
Qum, which Israel says could soon be impregnable to 
an airstrike. 
If Iran agrees to those interim steps, officials said, the 
talks could shift from high-profile meetings once a 
month to more regular meetings, at working levels, 
where officials could delve into technical details, like 
how to ship out the uranium or monitor Iran's 
suspension of operations at the plant near Qum, 
known as Fordo. European Union and Iranian officials 
have already met in Geneva to prepare the agenda for 
the meeting in Baghdad. 
"You could really use the summer to have weekly, if 
not daily, meetings to get to the point where the U.S. 
could say, `We think there is a deal out there to avoid 
war,' " said R. Nicholas Burns, who led talks with Iran 
EFTA_R1_02205127 
EFTA02721207

under President George W. Bush and is now a 
professor at Harvard. But, he added, the Obama 
administration "has also got to be willing to walk 
away from it." 
On Tuesday, the American ambassador to 
Israel, Daniel B. Shapiro, sought to reassure an Israeli 
audience that the United States not only was willing to 
use military force to prevent Iran from acquiring a 
nuclear weapon, but had made preparations to do so. 
And Mr. Netanyahu's public position on the 
negotiations has remain unchanged, while his ability 
to order military action may actually be enhanced by 
his new, broader coalition, analysts said. 
In his comments on Friday, Mr. Netanyahu reiterated 
his demand that Iran cease all enrichment, even to 3.5 
percent purity; ship out all stockpiles of enriched 
uranium; and dismantle, rather than simply switch off, 
the Fordo facility. "When this goal is achieved, I will 
be the first to applaud," he said during a visit to 
Prague. "Until then, count me among the skeptics." 
Analysts said it was hard to gauge what kinds of 
concessions from the Western nations, Russia and 
China would draw a positive response from Iran, 
beyond lifting the oil embargo. European officials 
have suggested that the European Union could 
suspend a ban on insuring oil tankers that has had a far 
swifter effect on Iran's sales elsewhere in the world 
than originally intended. 
The major powers, officials said, are also likely to 
offer a variation on an earlier proposal to enrich 
uranium removed from Iran and ship it back into the

country for use in medical research.

Prospects for Success in the Iran 
Nuclear Negotiations 
Patrick Clawson  and Mehdi Khalaji 
May 18, 2012 -- While Tehran may be preparing the 
ground for an interim agreement on terms the West 
would accept, any deal-in-principle would have to be 
finalized, put into practice, and followed by fuller 
agreements. Both Tehran and Washington are 
downplaying expectations for the May 23 Baghdad 
negotiations between Iran and the P5+1 (the United 
States, Russia, China, Britain, France, and Germany). 
Indeed, the prospects for eventual success are 
uncertain. If Iran is truly prepared to deal, and if the 
parties find appreciable overlap between what they are 
willing to concede, they may be able to forge an 
interim agreement, though the value and durability of 
such a deal may not be clear. 
TEHRAN MAY BE PREPARING IRANIANS FOR 
A DEAL 
To enable serious compromise, Iran must take two 
actions: prepare public opinion and include more-
skilled diplomats in the negotiating team. Regarding 
the first item, Iranian officials consistently deny the 
EFTA_R1_02205129 
EFTA02721209

impact of sanctions on both the nuclear program and 
economy. This fact suggests that if Tehran decides to 
make a concession, it will not want the move to be 
publicly perceived as a capitulation to economic 
pressure. Instead, the regime would need to present 
any nuclear accord as a victory for Iran. On May 9, an 
editorial in Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's newspaper, 
Keyhan, asserted that, for the first time since 2003, the 
P5+1 had agreed to take action if Iran takes action: 
"This means that the West has prepared itself for 
giving up to Iran's demands...This is why the Istanbul
