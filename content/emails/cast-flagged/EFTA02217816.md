I am afraid we must cancel the appointment we made for you, Jeffrey and Mike Abramowitz at Jeffrey's home in NY on July 24th. Unfortunately he will not be here Hoping we can set another date but will need to await Jeffrey's schedule. Could you please pass this along to Mike as well? • Thank ou EFTA_R1_00948286 EFTA02217816 |
