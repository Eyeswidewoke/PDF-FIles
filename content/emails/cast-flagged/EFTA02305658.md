We will be =oving the 2 offices out of 10B and 10F and turning them back into guest =pts. I was wondering if I could get your help in scheduling some of the =ork that needs to be done, especially refinishing wood floors, or =nstalling new wood floors. 10F needs a totally new floor installed. There had been some issues with =arge "bubbles" coming up in the floor and the whole thing is just a =ess. I'd like to use the charcoal gray parquet wood floor you have been =sing for your other apt renovations. 10B needs the carpet taken up and the wood floor refinished in living =oom and bedroom. 8H will need the wood floors refinished in living room and bedroom. Who do you use for this work? Is the gray parquet flooring reasonably =riced? and I'm assuming it's much less expensive to just refinish the =looring in 10B than it would be to replace it? Also, JE told me he wants me to find a different contractor to use =nstead of Penn for my new apt. He says he's unreliable, etc.. Do you =now of anyone else you would recommend? <?xml version=.0" encoding=TF-8"?> <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"> <plist version=.0"> <dict> <key>date-sent</key> <real>1334159382</real> <key>flags</key> <integer>8590195713</integer> <key>original-mailbox</key> <string>imap://sarahk525@mailmac.com/Sent%20Messages</string> <key>remote-id</key> <string>9979</string> <key>subject</key> <string></string> </dict> </plist> EFTA_R1_01180341 EFTA02305658 |
