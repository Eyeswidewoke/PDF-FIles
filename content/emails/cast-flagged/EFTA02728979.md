TOWN OF PALM BEACH 
POLICE DEPARTMENT 
A NATIONAL AND STATE ACCREDITED LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY 
May 1, 2006 
PERSONAL AND CONFIDENTIAL 
Mr. Barry E. Krischer, State Attorney 
Office of the State Attorney 
Fifteenth Judicial Circuit 
401 North Dixie Highway 
West Palm Beach, FL 33401 
Dear Mr. Krischer, 
Please find enclosed the probable cause affidavits and case filing packages thus far 
resulting from the Palm Beach Police Department's investigation of Jeffrey Epstein, Sarah 
Kellen and Haley Robson. The submission of these documents are both in response to 
Assistant State Attorney Lanna Belohlavek's request for them and to serve as the Palm 
Beach Police Department's presentation for prosecution. 
I know that you agree that it is our shared responsibility to seek justice and to serve the 
public interest by discharging our duties with fairness and accountability. I must renew my 
prior observation to you that I continue to find your office's treatment of these cases highly 
unusual. It is regrettable that I am forced to communicate in this manner but my most 
recent telephone calls to you and those of the lead detective to your assigned attorneys 
have been unanswered and messages remain unretumed. 
After giving this much thought and consideration, I must urge you to examine the unusual 
course that your office's handling of this matter has taken and consider if good and 
sufficient reason exists to require your disqualification from the prosecution of these 
cases. 
Sincerely, 
UudtaS 2fburk)
