| **Subject** | Re: His assistant will ask if this week works, but she said it doesn't look good. He has a meeting on the 9th in Santa Fe which should be over at 1pm and could head to ranch after that. If this week doesn't work, do you want to keep it for the 9th, or suggest a different day for next week?
