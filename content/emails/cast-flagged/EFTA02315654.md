It would be great to pay you guys a visit (wherever you may be!!) It would be fun to come to New York although I'm wondering if it is still hard for you to make plans in terms of moving around at a moment's notice. I am thrilled to hear that you have a lovely man in your life. I have only had one boyfriend since I left my husband and he turned out to be slightly odd so I am happy being on my own for the moment. However, I would like to find a soul mate as although I love living on my own, it would be wonderful to have a partner and a family. I guess I'll just have to see what life has to offer. There is always something unexpected waiting round the corner... I am on Skype. I am It would be lovely to chat some time but even better to see you in person! I can't wait to catch up - it has been so long. Much love, xx On Thu, Sep 20, 2012 at 11:12 PM, wrote= > HI darling!! I just saw your email in my Junk folder.. I rarely look at t=e folder.
