| **Subject** | 14G Flooring Attachments: IMG_5533.jpeg Hey guys.. I'm going to be installing new wood floors into my apt. The =aterials should arrive next week on either the 7th or 8th, and then =hey will start the installation on the 11th. It should take about 2-3 =ays. Does this schedule sound OK with you? Where should I have the =ontractors send their insurance information? They will be ripping out the carpet, and the marble tiles and parquet =loor which is currently under the carpet. Apparently half the apt is =hite marble tiles and the other half is parquet. They will be doing =verything except the bedroom, kitchen and bath. The sample of the wood I've chosen is below.. Thank you, 1 EFTA_R1_01239923 EFTA02324219 |
