| **Subject** | Delivery Hi Karyna This is harder than I thought., The company I normally use is out of business recently., I'm having Meridean set up delivery for today, some companies will not deliv=r to NYC large boxes due to TSA issues, you have to have an established acc=unt., So Meridean is setting up delivery for us., They may only deliver to door man at 301, since it's one person doing delive=y, do you think Andrew can have 301 Maintenance people bring up to your apt= The box weighs 300lbs, that's not to terribly heavy for two guys to move., =20 Can you check with Andrew? The building superintendent., Let me know Thx Larry Sent from my iPhone=?xml version=.0" encoding=TF-8"?> <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"> <plist version=.0"> <dict> <key>conversation-id</key> <integer>32819</integer> <key>date-last-viewed</key> <integer>0</integer> <key>date-received</key> <integer>1411490060</integer> <key>flags</key> <integer>8590195717</integer> <key>remote-id</key> <string>16745</string> </dict> </plist> 1 EFTA_R1_01264264 EFTA02331316 |
