We need a little help...lon N=cola is flying from LSJ to NY tomorrow and will need an apt. WE have 7J an= 3M both available but neither are clean.

I am not sure who else to ask? and Marilyn don't arrive until 5:24pm and we have no maids on hand for t=e weekends...I am thinking 3M may be easier to tidy up as it was Larry Viso=ki who stayed there.eas in 7J...Pleaes let me know if you can help=out and change the sheets in apt 3M! thanks...Lesley <?xml version=.0" encoding=TF-8"?> <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"> <plist version=.0"> <clict> <key>date-last-viewed</key> <integer>0</integer> <key>date-received</key> <integer>1480817158</integer> <key>flags</key> <integer>8590195717</integer> <key>gmail-label-ids</key> <array> <integer>5</integer> </array> <key>remote-id</key> <string>668122</string> </dict> </plist> EFTA_R1_01300141 EFTA02338210 |
