Good afternoon Jeffrey, 
I have a growing concern about AYH. The type of people who hang aroun= the property all day are questionable 
at best. During the past year=the managers have leased out the space directly below us to a fairly skank= bar and they 
have been allowed to place their high top tables outside (behind the first floor elevator) so their c=ientele are sitting out 
there drinking. Sammy's, the "convenienc=" store, looks like a hoarder moved in.. Today, someone was stabbe= in front 
of the elevator on the first floor during a fight. And the elevator has not worked since mid May. 
It's getting scary to be around the area. Is there anyway you can s=eak with Mr. Farkas or the NY management 
about their choices in tenants an= the general lack of upkeep of the property? 
With warm regards, 
Cecile
