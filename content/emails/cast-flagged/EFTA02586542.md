update 
Jeffrey, 
Just a quick note to update you on status. We =re working on finalizing the memos. The securities folks at Morgan 
L=wis have a call scheduled on Thursday with your contacts at Paul Weiss to =onfirm that they are thinking along the 
same lines. We have one more call scheduled with the major DAFs and commu=ity foundations, which is providing very 
interesting information from a pr=ctical perspective. As I have mentioned, we are preparing a chart th=t summarizes the 
key points of these call. As you may know, Larry Cohen just got back from being out of the office an= Rob and I are 
working on scheduling a call with him to bring him up to sp=ed and make sure we are coordinating. I will be out of the 
office st=rting August 2nd on vacation, so the packet of materials will be completed before I leave. 
Let me know if you have any questions.
