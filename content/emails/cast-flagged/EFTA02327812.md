| **To** | Rich Khan Hey rich.. quick question.. how is Ion paid? Is he on salary, or do we pay him per =ob, hour? I only ask because he was doing some samples for 71st this =eek, and I mentioned I needed my apt painted and asked when his friend =ichael(the painter) would be back in town. Ion then asked me if I had =onsidered doing venetian plaster, which is something Ion would do. I =on't want to consider it if Ion is much more expensive than Michael for = normal paint job, but if it's not, then I would love to do venetian =taster. can you pls let me know? thanks! <?xml version=.0" encoding=TF-8"?> <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/Propertylist-1.0.dtd"> <plist version=.0"> <dict> <key>date-sent</key> <real>B17411391</real> <key>flags</key> <integer>8590195713</integer> <key>original-mailbox</key> <string>imap://sarahkS25@mailmac.com/Sent%20Messages</string> <key>remote-id</key> <string>5375</string> <key>subject</key> <string></string> </dict> </plist> 1 EFTA_R1_01252525 EFTA02327812 |
