I get it, just n=t doing so well today....

Lost my flying car opportunity, UPM, FIRST asked for =o ties, my aviation clothing line partners cancelled our 
mtng today, Xpriz= is probably next.. 
just spent an hour talking to me on the phone abo=t how he was advised to 
react when press confronts him. He was told by a c=isis manager that it's a matter of time. And everyone is urging me to 
=et a lawyer and speak out if the claims are really not true. Can't pro=ess it at the moment, little overwhelmed watching 
everything spin out of c=ntrol again
