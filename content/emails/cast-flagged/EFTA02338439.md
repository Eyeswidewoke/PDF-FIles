| **Subject** | Thanks! Dear Jeffrey I want to thank you for opening your fabulous ranch to me yesterday -Paula had been there before and I understand it was a very special privilege that I was allowed to see it. What an inspired -and inspiring man you are... I have to say that it was the first time I was into the world of such a visionary. It is not really about the dimension of what all that represents in terms of "material", but about how much taste, sense of proportions, harmony, and desire. There is something totally voluptuous about all what I saw, I was feeling drunk from the beginning to the end, without a drop of alcohol. Like being inside a work of art. The images were following me during my conducting of Tosca and gave me a new impulse. Yes, yesterday my tempi and my desire of the piece were very different, inspired by your desire of all those things, flowing through my mind. Thanks Jeffrey, I feel very blessed to have met you Warmly Frederic <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC eV/Apple/MID KIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/Propertylist-1.0.dtd"> <plist version="1.0"> alict> <key>date-last-viewed</key> <real>0.0</real> <key>date-received</key> <real>1344816366</real> <key>flags</key> <integer>8590195713</integer> <key>original-mailbox</key> <string>imap:Meevacation@imap.gmail.com/%58Gmail%5D/All%20Mail</string> <key>remote-id</key> <string>240031</string> </diet> </plist> EFTA_R1_01300718 EFTA02338439 |
