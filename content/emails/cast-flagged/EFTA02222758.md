| **Subject** | Re: Apt 1OB Details Hello Yoni and Welcome to NY! Regarding your questions, I need to investigate both for you! I know you can purchase a washing machine card but I am not sure where...I have put a call in to the superintendent of the building...hope to be in touch soon on that... we now have Apple Tv and yes, it is different! I do not believe you can watch regular news like ABC, FOX, NBC but I am asking our IT man, James. I know James will be at the apartment building this Friday Sept. 8th at 10am for another guest and I thought when he is finished with this guest, he could then come to your apt and help out with the TV—around 11:30am—would this work for you? Would someone be in the apartment so he could demonstrate things?
