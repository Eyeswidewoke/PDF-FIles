Shall we confirm for 2pm on Wednesday at the 301 lobby? P.S. How are you feeling after the surgery? Are you walking comfortably already?

Lesley and I have been talking about which apartments are available on Oct 28th. It would be so much fun to look together and maybe there is stuff I can help you with. Do you have any time at 2pm or 2:30 on Wed? 2 EFTA_R1_01259978 EFTA02329827 |
