| **To** | Jeffrey Could you help me please? This is a draft of an email to Merwin, Leo and =ojo (Sonam was off). Would you recommend any changes? Good morning Merwin, Leo and Jojo, It has come to my attention, that the catering kitchen was left untidy =ast night. I must admit, I was surprised, since only in April we had =his discussion and you spent a great deal of time cleaning it. Therefore I feel that it is necessary to remind you, that Mr. =pstein's policy is that each one of you is responsible to leave =our workspace clean before you go home, which includes the cellar =loor. Since the problem with the cellar persists despite the multiple attempts =o fix it, I assume we need to come up with a more effective strategy =ow to maintain the place. let's discuss today please. <?xml version=.0" encoding=TF-8"?> <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "4/Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.O.dtd"> <plist version=.0"> <dict> <key>conversation-idgkey> <integer>40177</integer> <key>date-last-viewed</key> <integer>0</integer> <key>date•received</key> <integer>1529556532</integer> <key>flags</key> <integer>8623750145</integer> <key>remote-id</key> <string>1372S</string> </dict> </plist> 1 EFTA_R1_01186654 EFTA02307815 |
