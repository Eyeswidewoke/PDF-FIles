I am delighted to hear from Jeffrey Epstein's office that you are to be the subject of a portrait to be painted by one of our talented young artists. Your Portrait Scholar is Bernard Garcia. He's a very personable and gifted artist who is looking forward to meeting you. We would like to invite you to meet Bernard at the Academy (111 Franklin Street, Tribeca) at a time and day to suit your schedule. You can see some of Bernard's work and discuss the approach to the portrait together. During your visit he will also want to take some photographs and/or sketches. Please let me know when you might be available to visit us, or if you would prefer to discuss date options by phone please call me at We're very much looking forward to meeting you. Best wishes Lisa Lisa Kirk Development Director New York Academy of Art www.nyaa.edu <http://www.nyaa.edu> 2 EFTA_R1_01264385 EFTA02331367 EFTA_R1_0 1264386 EFTA02331368 |
