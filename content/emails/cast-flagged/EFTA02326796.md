| **Subject** | Apt for Ehud's security people IF w= have furniture Hi =Anthony Barrett called to let me know he has an em=ty, newly renovated apartment across the hall from 11J that he could let Eh=d's security people stay in if Jeffrey would like BUT there is no f=rniture in it. Anthony says he would offer this apartment to Ehud40=99s security pp for the same rate they are paying at the hotel they stay in=E2**He thinks it might be easier for all involve as the security pp sta=d in the hall while Ehud is in residence. I would think they need min=mal furniture, but obviously they would need a bed and a TV would be nice (=hich would also mean Time Warner?) kitchen table and chairs...b=fore I even ask JE about this, I wanted to find out if there is even furnit=re that we could put in this apartment for them?... c=span> Please let me know what you think...(sounds like a lot=of effort, but maybe it is worth it...and even if we don't ha=e finished by Sept 10, they could stay in hotel until it was decent enough f=r them to stay) EFTA_R1_01248490 EFTA02326796 |
