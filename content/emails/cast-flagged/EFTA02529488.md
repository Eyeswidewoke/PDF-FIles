Hello Jeff, 
I would like to speak with you about the trafficking charges=whirling around you and Brunel. 
I'm certain your attorney'= are advising you not to speak to media ( I am a writer not a journalist a= you know). 
The downside is that you don't have a voice. 
public opinion in your case might sway in the direction least favorable=to you and will decidedly impact 
investigations if you don't speak. 
no matter how limited that conversation may be it is important at thi= point that you respond to some 
allegations being reported almost on a mon=hly basis. 
There is nothing more enticing to the press and to law enforcement than=to be able to punish a wealthy man for 
allegedly committing improper sexua= acts against financially deprived minors. No matter who the man is or whe=e the 
girl comes form, he looses hands down. 
find someone you trust and speak to them albeit limited and focus only =n the most damaging issues.
