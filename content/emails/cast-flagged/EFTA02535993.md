To capture an image of the Hubble Deep Field, the Hubble telescope is pointed at a small area of space with no 
known outstanding features. Light is collected from the same small field of view for several days, so the faintest glimmer 
can be captured. The resulting image, when compiled, shows a lot of colorful, fuzzy and glimmering lights and spirals, 
which are actually distant galaxies. 
In Celmins's image, she removes the color and spiral forms that would typically be in a Hubble telescope image, 
instead focusing on the patterns created by the repeated gems of light. Rather than focus on the colors and shapes of 
the individual galaxies (which is what the Hubble telescope allows us to do), Celmins refocuses our view of the image as 
the view of an overall pattern — which she of course does in all of her work. The Hubble Deep Field, like Celmins's work, 
makes visible a small portion of something vast and infinite; by taking the field as her subject, Celmins recalibrates our 
perspective and emphasizes the depth of the infinite. Even the most specific of images or smallest of fields can be 
boundless, it just depends on the lens.
