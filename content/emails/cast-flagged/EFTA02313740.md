So this contract was drafted =ears ago and it appears no one was willing to sign, is that correct? Karyna On Feb 15, 2019, at 1:07 PM, Kary=a Shulia > wrote: Dear Alex, Thank you for=your email. I am sure you are aware that this "real e=tate contract" is highly irregular for Americans. 1.=C2* It is not a real estate contract, it is a purchase of an offshore en=ity, creating many complexities for americans. 4=iv> 2= There was never any discussion about real estate fees on top of the=price. We have bought many properties, including through Christies and a c=mmission was always paid by seller. 3. The due diligen=e on a lichtenstein co. will take months. 4. We would h=ve to be indemnified for all taxes due to morroccan government on tr=nsfer and unknown liabiltiles of the co., especially as you might imagine,=this purchase would be very high profile. 5. Is t=ere a title on file? who would guarantee title transfer? If Christies is w=lling that might work. 6. We were hoping for a quick closing= With this structure it is not possible, and money would need to be withhe=d for years to back up the indemnity. It is very disappointing. We a=e told that liabilties would extend approx 7 years, so a payment of 10m da= one and 2 milliion per year for 8 years might work. There clearly is no p=rfect title transfer under your proposed structure. Four jurisdictio=s, real estate and corporate and disclosure rules in each. Can you make a =uggestion? Thank you.
