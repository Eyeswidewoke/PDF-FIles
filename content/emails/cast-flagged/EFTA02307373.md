| **To** | Jeffrey Epstein < This is what I have so far for pricing. I still need =o source a few things for apts.. TVs, ipod docks, mattress, printers. =till working on selecting some rugs, accessories. I don't have any of =he things Karyna or ■ want for their apts yet, so can't fill in =ricing, etc for anything for those apts, and still working out pricing =or painting apts with Michael/Ion. It doesn't really give you much info =ntil the list is complete and I don't feel 100% comfortable with the =inal furniture list until I'm in NY again and can properly measure out =urniture in the apts and physically be in them. I don't feel =omfortable working with a floor plan yet; hard for me to visualize. I =now basically which furniture I like, but most styles come in different =izes, lengths, etc. I know this won't tell you much, and until I'm in =Y and in the apts, I don't feel I can really give final decisions on =hings for pricing. =br> 1 EFTA_R1_01185115 EFTA02307373 |
