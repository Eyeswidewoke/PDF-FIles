Alexander - 
I am much better at reading x-ray= than between the lines, but I'll try. 
My Jeddah t=ip was proposed by the bank. The purpose was as follow-up to help their del=very unit team 
complete the data analysis and launch their own President40=804>s Delivery Unit at the Islamic Development Bank. I 
attach a photo of m= on the billboard in the hallway announcing the event. In addition, a snaps=ot of me at the 
conference. 
I went from Jeddah to meet my 
. The trip as you see from the 
e=ail attachment was approved and thefunding mechanism agree wi 
e an .=n sp; 
Of course I assume many times Jim and I were in a large cafete=ia with many people, sitting only the two of us at 
a table but nothing unto=ard ever transpired. 
I do not believe I have ever=stayed at the Ritz in Manhattan.

Dear Melanie, 
l=appreciated the time you took to talk to me on Monday. Below are some addit=onal questions based 
on our conversation. Please respond to them in writing= if possible, whenever you have a chance to sit down at a 
computer. And tha=k you again for taking the time. I am fully aware of how busy you are with y=ur medical practice. 
I told you that we would not e=dorse salacious rumor. I also told you that we did not intend to publish 
yo=r name. That is and will remain true, unless dramatic evidence comes to lig=t and makes us reconsider. But we are 
interested in how the WBG board handl=d allegations against JYK. Even if you believe those allegations were nothi=g 
more than a smear campaign, they were obviously concerning enough that thy were brought to the ethics committee 
board. Our interest is in how the bo=rd handled those allegations, not whether they can be verified as true. 
As such, it would be very helpful if you helped us und=rstand some details about your travel. Again, this 
is not about whether an i=proper relationship did or did not occur: We make very clear that there is n= evidence to that 
effect, and that it has been roundly denied. We do nothin= to call those denials into question. But we are interested in 
some of the u=derlying questions that led to the allegation in the first place. In fact, t= us, the question of a romantic 
affair between two consenting adults is utt=rly irrelevant. The question that matters is whether JYK exercised proper 
j=dgement and, also, whether he misused funds, or authorized such misuse by o=hers. 
Let's start with the Jeddah trip. 1) C=n you tell me the purpose of the trip 2) Can you tell me how long 
you devot=d to that purpose? 3) When you arrived in Jeddah, you posted a photograph f=om your Instagram account 
that was taken from Flickr. Why did you do that? 3= Did the World Bank know, prior to the trip, that you would be 
traveling to=Southeast Asia from the Arabian Peninsula? 4) You said the trip was approve= by your supervisor. Who was 
that? 
You also told me t=at you did not frequently travel with JYK, but records show that in 2016, y=u travelled 
together on nine separate occasions. 1) If the mission of the P=U involved data transparency and public•facing 
accountability, as you told m= on Monday, what was the purpose of these trips? Can you share your notes f=om any of 
these trips with me? 2) When you travelled to New York on June 26= 2016, why did you decide not to stay at the 
Renaissance in Westchester, mo=ing instead to the Ritz Carlton in Manhattan? 3) On a number of occasions, y=u dined 
alone with JYK. Did you ever feel pressured to do so? Did you ever f=nd him to be inappropriate? Did you ever feel 
uncomfortable traveling with h=m? 
I very much hope these questions do not put you=on a defensive. As I already said, your name does not 
appear in the article= nor any identifying characteristics—your work at the PDU, your rel=tionship to the Gates 
Foundation—that would allow anyone to identif= you in any way. This is an investigation of JYK, not you. And it is an 
inv=stigation of public deeds, not private behavior. As such, you could be trem=ndously helpful in helping to gain more 
clarity about JYK's tenure. 
Thank you again for your willingness to work with me on th=s. It is deeply appreciated.
