| **Subject** | RE: Jim - JE would like you to say something like this if you get a chance - - Africa is a unique economic conundrum. It requires a knights move for a solution. Jeffrey has the ability to craft a credible financial initiative What he is looking for is something that talks about his financial ability rather than his philanthropy - maybe you can send an addition to what they already have - thanks EFTA_R1_01280382 EFTA02333687 |
