Hope you are well...our men just spoke and confirmed Tommy to come see Jeffrey tomorrow morning at 8:30am_but Jeffrey forgot he has an appointment EFTA_R1_00961496 EFTA02223145 out of the house at 8:30am! I wanted to see if Tommy might be available to come at 10am instead tomorrow?! Or I can try to change this other appointment for another day...I just know this other place is difficult...but happy to do it if this is our only option! Please let me know... >>» >>>> Thanks, >» >> EFTA_R1_00961497 EFTA02223146 |
