| **Subject** | Guest apartments notes Hi Welcome back! How was your vacation? I hope you had a great time with =our family!! There are 2 things regarding 301 schedule I need to let you know about: 1. Karen is coming to New York from July 6th till the 14th to help us at =1st. Jeffrey would like her to stay at 301during that time. Which =partment can she stay at? I was thinking 10B if it is not booked? Also =he apartment will need to be cleaned before she arrives. 2. Ching, the painter, is doing some paint work in the guest apartments. =e should be done tomorrow. The apartments will require a quick cleaning =fter that. This is all for now. Thanks so much!
