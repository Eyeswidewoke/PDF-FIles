The order # 826839455058129 Please can you help facilitate the shipping of this order to us? Greatly appreciate your help! Jun 8, 8:54 AM PDT: It appears I cannot use Sultan's credit card he has given me because the country/region of his card is not a given choice: United Arab Emirates. I am going to ask my employer if I may use his cc details instead....I will get back to you as soon as I hear from him... Jun 8, 8:43 AM PDT: EFTA_R1_00945440 EFTA02216346 excellent! I am doing it now! Be in touch shortly Taylor, Jun 8, 8:41 AM PDT: Hell You are free to enter identical personalizations for the kits if you wish. The original personalization on each sample kit is meant to help customers organize multiple kits, but will not necessarily correspond with the name of the person who will be using the kit in question. Until a sample kit has been registered to a 23andMe account, it can be used by anyone. The registration process will allow the sample kit to be associated with the name of the person providing the sample. Please let me know when you have completed your order. Best regards, Taylor The 23andMe Team dun 8, 8:39 AM PDT: Taylor. Sutlan says last time he merely entered his name for all 30 kits...once he receive the kits he would then have each individual person register each individual kit...OK to proceed like this? Jun 8, 8:27 AM PDT: ok, understood...1ml! coordinate with Sultan. Taylor, Jun 8, 8:23 AM PDT: Hello We are unable to process orders over the phone, or place orders on a customer's behalf. If you would like to place an order for 30 kits, you will need to enter a name for each kit at our store cart. You can use the link below to automatically add 30 kits to your cart, which will then need to each have a name or personalization entered: haps: store.23andme.comkart/?kit..., 30 Please let me know when you have completed your order so that I may monitor its fulfillment and ensure the order is completed. EFTA_R1_00945441 EFTA02216347 Best regards, Taylor The 23andMe Team Jun 8, 6:47 AM PDT: Good morning Taylor. May I please call you to place this order for the 30 kits? I can't seem to figure out how to purchase the kits on line without plugging in names for each kit. The website does not allow me to move on from this function...or can you explain to me how to circumvent the addition of names for each kit? I would really like to get this done today. Thank yo' -,tun 7, 4:57 AM PDT: Good morning Taylor. Sultan would like me to place a completely new order. He has provided me his CC details. a picture of the front an back of the card, his security code and address for the code. Might I be able to place the order directly with you? I do not have the names of each individual who will be using the DNA kits.. Jun 6, 3:43 PM PDT: Hi Taylor and thank you so much for getting back to me...Let me alert Sultan and his PA...I am thinking they are not aware the account has insufficient funds..! I will get back to you as soon as possible. Taylor, Jun 6, 3:26 PM PDT: Hello Thank you for following up on this order. The order was approved for shipment by the appropriate teams, however PayPal prevented us from completing this order as there were insufficient funds in the purchasing account. The message our system received was as follows: PayPal gateway has rejected request. Transaction rejected, please contact the buyer (#10606: Buyer cannot pay) We have been attempting to complete this order for a little over a week in the hopes that the payment response would update. Unfortunately, we received a new message earlier today stating that PayPal will not complete the order. As a result, we have cancelled order #740-627542-142810. If you or the original purchaser would like to EFTA_R1_00945442 EFTA02216348 place a new order, please reply directly to this message immediately after placing the order so I can approve it at our warehouse. Depending on the routing and/or availability of funds in the original PayPal account, you may wish to instead purchase using a credit card. I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this has caused. Please let me know if there's anything I can answer for you at this time. Best regards, Taylor The 23andMe Team Jun 5, 7:34 AM PDT: Hello Taylor. I would like to help Sultan Bin Sulayem facilitate his order #740-627542-142810 of 30 (thirty) "23 and Me" kits he placed an order for on May 21, 2017. You specifically emailed Sultan on May 23, 2017, to find out the use of the 30 kits (you say due to the size of the order you need to find out the intended use for the kits). He would like to give the kits to his co-workders so they too may enjoy investigating their ancestry. (Sultan participated with his own DNA and found it fascinating...he wants the people he works with to participate as well) The kits are to be delivered to: Jeffrey Epstein 9 East 71st Street NY, NY 10021 The kits are to be delivered to Jeffrey's address for ease. We have ordered many kits ourselves as gifts...indeed, Sultan received his personal kit from Jeffrey as a gift. The kits were paid for by Jim Miller who is Sultan's Personal Assistant. Jim has a supplementary credit card that is linked to Sultan's account so he can make purchases in Sultan's name. Please advise what, if any, other information you would like so we may have the kits shipped as soon as possible. If we need to make an entire new order, please let me know so we may do so.
