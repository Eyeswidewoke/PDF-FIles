Apparently he was =aiting for you at the Red Hook docks thinking you were coming from the =stand. I am very sorry about this! We are having no luck with your =rrangements getting you to the airport! I take it you must have taken a =axi to the airport instead? I hope you made it home OK. Again I am very =orry this has happened again! <?xml version=.0" encoding=TF-8"?> <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"> <plist version=.0"> <dict> <key>date-sent</key> <real>1318944163</real> <key>flags</key> <integer>8590195713</integer> <key>original-mailbox</key> <string>imap:// <key>remote-id</key> <string>6692</string> <key>subject</key> <string></string> </dict> </plist> /Sent%20Messages</string> 1 EFTA_R1_01262027 EFTA02330394 |
