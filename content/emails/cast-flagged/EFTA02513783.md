Re: 
sorry sorry I expect this natural disaster of a medi= shit storm will last the month. like a hurricane or tsunami, =ittle can 
be done to effect it. if you stand up now , it is no= without risks, the press only wants to complete its version of a 
sa=acious story , not hear the truth, so any denials will be met with a stron=er wind of allegations . Unforrtunatley I 
think after its over=this time , and it will be,= again, we will need to assess d=mage and begin a strategy to rectify, 
modify, but it will not be the=same. you are physically fine, as am 
I however=recogninze that that is little comfort 
at the moment. ye= sara hirsh security clearnave did not check , she was trouble and a liar.=C2. and I told her in a 
nice way . the org is a =ake, 
O= Sat, Jan 10, 2015 at 8:50 PM, 
I get it, =ust not doing so well today.... 
Lost my flying car opportunity, UPM, FIRST aske= for no ties, my aviation clothing line partners cancelled our 
mtng today,=Xprize is probably next.. 
just spent an hour talking to me on the pho=e about how he was advised to 
react when press confronts him. He was told =y a crisis manager that it's a matter of time. And everyone is urging =e to 
get a lawyer and speak out if the claims are really not true. Can'=t process it at the moment, little overwhelmed 
watching everything spin ou= of control again
