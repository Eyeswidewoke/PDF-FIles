I know you need to choose a color stil=, so I won't have him paint over the samples, but he can start setting up a=d working on fabric wall if you want it removed? <?xml version=.0" encoding=TF-8"?> <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "4/APPle//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/Propertylist-1.0.dtd"> <plist version=.0"> <dict> <key>date-sent</key> <real>1341160047</real> <key>flags</key> <integer>8590195713</integer> <key>original-mailbox</key> <string>imap:/ <key>remote-id</key> <string>11851</string> <key>subject</key> <string></string> </dict> </plist> Sent%20Messages</string> EFTA_R1_01191936 EFTA02309408 |
