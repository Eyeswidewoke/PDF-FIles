| **From** | Cimberly Galindo Sent Mon 12/30/2002 4:25:00 PM Happy Birthday, Merry Christmas and Happy New Year! I received the Xmas card you emailed me, too funny. Did you get the scratch and sniff I sent you? I have a feeling it didn't go through. When are you coming out West? As of January 15, we will be living in Irvine CA. Can you believe I've been gone for 5 months already? To me it seems like just yesterday. I can't wait to have a normal life again, hopefully by February. XO Cim :) Do you Yahoo!? Yahoo!
