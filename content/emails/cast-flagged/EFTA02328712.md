| **Subject** | Re: Lunch at noon today Hi Karyna...this is Barnaby Marsh...he specifically told JE =ne time that his assistant (ME) overstepped bounds by asking what he =anted to eat...Jeffrey passed that along to me...l kinda =hink it is 'inappropriate' to ask him (as crazy as that =ounds)! But I basically had my hand slapped for it last time! Did Jeffrey ask you to ask what they want? I know Barnaby comes for =reakfast all the time...I took notes and he ate a cheese omelette =nd bagel ... If Jeffrey wants me to ask I will but otherwise...? wing it? order = few different things? ...and when it comes to Jim Watson, I have no contact info for =im...I believe this will be his first time coming here... long answer for a short question!
