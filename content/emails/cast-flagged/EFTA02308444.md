| **Subject** | Mirrors- Final Edition Palms Mirror Inventory Richard Kahn 3 extra mirrors shipped one of the 3 was scratched 5 mirrors need to be replaced due to bleeding through of glue ( all on bottom row, 5 bad out of 8). The 5h mirror started to bleed this morning. 2 mirrors on 2nd row have a small defect and should be replaced, not sure how the defect got there. Need 5 new panels. Maybe one spare. Do you want-to order or we can call direct. Still no glue, company won't ship to STT, only to states. We just got off phone with them. Trying to resolve. Will update later.
