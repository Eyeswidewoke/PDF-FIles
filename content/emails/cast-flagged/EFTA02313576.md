| **Subject** | Tomorrow Hey scott.. for tomorrow at 71st, the Epson Pro 3800 won't print for =ome reason from my laptop. I plug it into my computer, set up something =o print, then in the print box it says connecting to printer, then just =ays "Error" in the status section. It won't do anything. I've restarted =he printer, my computer, unplugged, replugged, doesn't help. On the Epson Aculaser on 5th floor, it is now putting a lovely yellow =ine down the middle of all my scans; not sure what that's from also on my laptop, the address book is doing that thing again where it =on't allow my to search names. I'd like to look into having a shared calendar with Lesley on our =calendars as well if you can show us how to set up. At 301, I have the 3 airport expresses for apts 11P, 8I1 and 10B to set =p for wireless. <?xml version=.0" encoding=TF-8"?> <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.O.dtd"> <plist version=.0"> <dict> <key>flags</key> <integer>33751041</integer> <key>remote-id</key> <string>12432</string> </dict> </plist> 1 EFTA_R1_01203813 EFTA02313576 |
