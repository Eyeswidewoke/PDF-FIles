Last year while on holidays=traveling in Florida I needed to 
go to the emergency room. N=t wanting to sit there for 4 hours, 
I put on my MAGIC GREEN HAT= When I went into the E. R., 
I noticed that 3/4 of the p=ople got up and left. 
I guess they decided that they weren't that sick after all. 
Cut at least 3 hours off my=waiting time. 
Here's the hat: 
It also works at Dept. of M=tor Vehicles. It saved me 5 hours. 
At the Laundromat, three minutes after entering, I had my=/p> 
choice of any machine, most=still running. 
If you live in Texas , it might cut your wait time at the grocery store. 
But...don't try it at McDonald's. The whole crew&nbs=;ran out 
the back door and I n=ver got my order!
