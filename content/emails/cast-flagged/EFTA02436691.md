Ok. And it's ok if we are both there at the same time on the night of the 11th? We fly from Paris 
to Miami on the morning of the 12.

Dear Jeffrey, 
It has been far too long since we were in contact. Hope 
you are well? I have been following you vicariously through 
various mutual friends... 
Life in my world is as busy as ever and the demands are 
every increasing on my time. Having said that I really 
enjoy the work on behalf of the UK and I can make a real 
contribution to the UK's economy and prosperity through 
the activity and interventions I make. 
I have to go to Paris this coming weekend, 1 l'" to 14th Sept, 
and I remember that you have an apartment in Paris and 
was just wondering if I might be allowed to use it for the 
weekend? This is a private weekend and I am already 
booked into a hotel but on the off chance that you would 
allow me to use your apartment it would be really great 
from a number of perspectives. 
If this is either inappropriate or unavailable then I apologise 
for asking. 
I look forward to catching up with you personally before 
too long and in the meantime send you my very best 
wishes. 
Andrew.
