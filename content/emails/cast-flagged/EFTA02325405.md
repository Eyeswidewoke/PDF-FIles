| **Subject** | Saturday Hi Steve, Jeffrey asked me to touch base with you regarding his plans to come to the Hamptons this Saturday. He is taking a heli from the city at 9am and wondering if you can collect him from the airport in the Hamptons? Should he land in East Hampton or West Hampton? Thanks!
