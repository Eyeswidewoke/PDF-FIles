I went to PC Richards yesterday to pick out new appliances =o lam having trouble finding a refrigerator which =ill fit the current dimensions of what's there. All the current ones =re 28" wide by 26" deep by about 65" high. I can't find anything that's =8" wide that isn't deeper than 29 inches, in which case it would stick =ut more than desired from the cabinets. I did find one however that's =7.5 wide by 24 deep, but 75" high, which is too high with the cabinet =bove the fridge. I didn't have a chance to specifically look, but =ondering if it's doable to remove the cabinet over the fridge so we can =it a taller fridge in the space? I'm sort of at a loss as to what to do =bout sourcing a fridge with the current dimensions otherwise. <?xml version=.0" encoding=TF-8"?> <IDOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "1/AppleHDTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/Propertylist-1.0.dtd"> <plist version=.0"> <dict> <key>date-sent</key> <real>1338820075</real> <key>flags</key> <integer>8590195713</integer> <key>original-mailbox<Ae > <string>imap: ent%20Messages</string> <key>remote-id</key> <string>11271</string> <key>subject</key> <string>Re: Appliances</string> </dict> </plist> EFTA_R1_01190928 EFTA02309196 |
