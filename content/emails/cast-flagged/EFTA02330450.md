| **Subject** | Re: St. Barth's trip We are sending a request to the Tropical Hotel which is where Julia stayed l=st year over Xmas. The only way to get a reservation is through a request f=rm. Working on it. We did find some hotels that will book you for 28 days b=t they all want payment in full, up front, no cancellation. If you cancel t=ey keep all your money.
