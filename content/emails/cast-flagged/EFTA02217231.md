Please let me know if you wish me to call Dr. Chen's office and tell them "Hamad is a good friend of Jeffrey's"...happy to do so...just want to make sure this is correct... Dr. Chen has 2 offices...the office on 51st Street is where he does consultations ...the office at 180 Fort Washington Ave is where he does procedures. I have been coordinating Jeffrey's appointments with Erica Paterson.
