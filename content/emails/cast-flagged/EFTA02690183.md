G. I've read these and the VF article. This could all rebound badly. The reports have names removed and are incomplete. 
They make her look like a poor abused kid. If you have evidence of an open warrant, that could be another thing but I 
suggest you keep your head down. The article is light on you, which indicates our rebuttal worked. Best B

Brain, here are some VR Police reports. There may be more stuff on her but I don't have it. They show drug use, 2 prior 
complaints of sexual abuse, one when she was 13 years old I think..you will have to read to be sure..and her mother who 
was worried that she was into witch craft and drugs according to the same police report! She has I believe a current 
open arrest warrant for theft..) am pretty sure that minor investigation into her will show that she lied on her entry form 
to or application to live in Australia..one question that is on that form is have you ever been arrested and you know she 
will have said no on the form ..and there will be drug related lies and problems too...much like some of the issues they 
are now uncovering with the maid in Strauss Khan arrest.. I have heard rumors, but it is not public, the maid said on tape 
that she will make a lot of money out of this..VR is called un credible the police reports in her harassment suits..this is 
the person people are pillorying Andrew over?? Nothing she has said has ever been taken under oath — everything she 
has said is to gain money..one in the civil suit and one from the press..obviously the juicer what she says the more 
money she gets..) can tell you that nothing I have read that has come out of her mouth resembles one shred of 
truth..she is a liar and a scammer..people like that will have problems all over the place and in all areas of their life..a 
minor look at her from a investigative perspective and one would need to walk away as she simply will not stand up as 
someone who is reliable or probable Over to you Keep me posted and thank you
