| **To** | Francis Derby Hi Francis, Thank you for the dinner last night. I didn't ask you how much your rate is.= I'm very sorry, I should have asked earlier so I could have given it to yo= last night. I can always send a check if that is easier? As far as Saturday is concerned, I think we will wait for you to do a dinner=that we can all attend once Jeffrey is back in town; I'm leaving town tonig=t and he wants me to be there the next time you cook. =?xml version=.0" encoding=TF- 8"?> <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/Propertylist-1.0.dtd"> <plist version=.0"> <dict> <key>date-sent</key> <real>1316785504</real> <key>flags</key> <integer>8590195713</integer> <key>original-mailbox</key> <string>imap://sarahk525@mail.mac.com/Sent%20Messages</string> <key>remote-id</key> <string>6241</string> <key>subject</key> <string></string> </dict> </plist> 1 EFTA_R1_01251792 EFTA02327559 |
