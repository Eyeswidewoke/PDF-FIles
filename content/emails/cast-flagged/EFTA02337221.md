Build a $5-10MM portfolio of hard money real estate loans EFTA_R1_01298428 EFTA02337221 a. 1-2 yrs maturity b. 11-12% IRR c. 50-60% LTV d. Loan size commitment in the$500-1MM range e. Distributions received quarterly f. I think of this as part of the illiquid fixed income portfolio. 2. Defaulted credit card and auto loan debt (they buy paper at 3c on the dollar, obtain judgements and garnish wages; recoveries anywhere between 5c-100c on the dollar) a. Option 1— provide a 3yr loan at 10% against the portfolio b. Option 2 — Provide a 3yr loan at 6% with a 20% equity stake in what gets recovered through years 4-6 (my guess is a 13% IRR over the 6 years) c. Option 3 — No debt, all equity. IRR in the 20%-30% (distributions have very long tails so would negotiate an end date). These are both run by a good friend. I have been doing both for many years. Will call to discuss.
