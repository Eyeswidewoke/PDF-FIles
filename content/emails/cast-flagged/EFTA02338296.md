| **Subject** | intro Jeffrey, I want to introduce you to Fiorenzo. Fiorenzo runs the Sillaab at Tufts =http://ase.tufts.edu/biomedical/unolab/home.html) and he's also a =riend of Joi. I went to visit the lab yesterday and it's quite =mpressive (eg: you can "wrap" bio fluids into silk and they are =reserved for a long time. You can also inject "prisms" made of silk =nto a human/animal body to augment reflection if you're trying to take =n image of that body part - again, quite amazing). Anyway, Fiorenzo is also potentially thinking about starting a company =ased on his work. He's going to be in NYC either from Wednesday night =r Thursday morning and then he's taking off on Friday Fio, Jeffrey is a friend of Joi as well and he loves science. Among other =hings, he runs a foundation that helped a lot of scientists work on =heir research =http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Epstein_VI_Foundation). Even if =is background is in finance, he is pretty well-read on various =cientific fields/topics - so I think he'd love to hear the underlying =etails of your research.
