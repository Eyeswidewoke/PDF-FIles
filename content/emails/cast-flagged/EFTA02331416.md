| **From** | jeffrey E. <jeevacation@gmail.com> |
| **To** | "jeffrey E." <jeevacation@gmail.com <mailto:jeevacation@gmail.com=>> As my career as one of the=best yoga teachers in the US has fallen short... I want to start=a blog on design related things. I am using polyvore to experiment and pla= with ideas and to see how many followers I can get and at what pace, and =lso to create something so that I can show you what I mean. I love being o= it. The concept of going to a store or going to look around physically fo= things seems insane when in one instant you can have access to a thousand=times more online. You can create rooms and when someone moves their mouse=over the furniture, they can see where it is from, the cost of it, and cli=k on a link directly to the website. I never used to buy clothes online an= now it is all I do. It is so tedious and time consuming to physically go =o a store. Your searches are so refined on polyvore or other online platfo=ms. You can type in for eg: white silk blouse with black buttons xs and hu=dreds of options are immediately available to you at different price point=. Imagine how long it would take to search bloomingdales for that exact th=ng and maybe find a couple of options. The idea of going to a store and lo=king around for what one wants seems crazy. People can watch trends =nline and go straight for it in seconds. Complete the whole process in les= time than you would spend in a store even just waiting in line to pay. Also, half the blogs I read aren't even written in proper Engli=h, an advantage I have when doing anything online. Anyway.=. That's what I love doing with my time. ( I don't know if it can =ecome anything more than just a hobby) I want to hav= babies within the next 4 - 5 years and live near the ocean. Sun=hine, flowers, ocean, yoga, beautiful things, babies and love are my plan.=C2 Regarding Gregory: It is a pleasu=e. I showed him everything and gave him print outs of the floor plans, and=corresponding furniture pics sent by artefacto. He liked the wor= Anthony did on the studio and thought that could be a model and standard =or the others. I have been studying all the=rules about driving in the US. It is so much stricter than SA!!! I find it=so interesting Sent from my iPhone On Sep 30, 2014, at 2:00 PM, "jeffrey E." <jeevacation@gmail.com<k» wrote: =hank for meeting gretory, what have you been doing? plan=. please EFTA_R1_01264500 EFTA02331416 =AO please note The information conta=ned in this communication is confidential, may be attorney-client privi=eged, may constitute inside information, and is intended only for th= use of the addressee.
