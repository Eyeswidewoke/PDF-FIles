Re: Wurman's conference 
JE, 
Thanks, but... 
1. I appreciate your thoughtfulness, but, between us and confidentially, =othing I've heard about the conference seems 
to be a reason I would =ant to be there. (Other than your attending). There's no business for =e • most of the people are 
Richard's old friends (and I mean OLD) - =hey don't have books in them; and it's not about cutting edge ideas. =his would 
mean engaging with younger people and also science, which is =ot his forte. Not to mention where are the women? 
And I get tired when = hear that he wants everybody to have mini meetings with each other. =his sounds like work to 
me. Finally, after seeing what's happened to =ED since he sold it, his best shot it to go quietly away. 
2. In any event, there's an exhibition of Benoit's fractal images =pening in NY in the same time period and I promised his 
wide I would be =here and organize a group of Edgies to also come and help celebrate his =ife. (I really do miss him). 
Some nice news ...

Campaign puts Obama in touch with life outside the bubble 
...On Air Force One, which features the best office in the world at =0,00O feet, aides say, he is most often in the 
conference room, door =pen, ESPN's SportsCenter on the television. Many advisers who may not =et past the Oval 
Office gatekeepers are welcome to drop in on what =nsiders say is usually a fairly casual atmosphere. 
But there is always reading material — the i Pad, magazines, a book — =n front of him on the conference table. 
Aides say the most recent book he has read and recommended as pertinent =o the current political and economic 
climate is "Thinking, Fast and =low," by the Nobel economics laureate Daniel Kahneman. According to =escriptions of 
the book, published last year, Kahneman, who works at =he nexus of psychology and economics, examines influences on

I'm working up a new publishing initiative, going deep into "Big Data". =ere's the first bunch. Many more to come. It 
would make an interesting =onference subject: =ttp://edge.org/event/special/-computational-social-science. Frank 
=chirrmacher (Germany's Culture Czar and Publisher of FAZ) writes: "your =big data" debate is essential, but some of 
these people will pay quite = prize for what they are saying...its Orwell of course, but Orwell made =exy by Stewart 
Brand and counter-culture and wired by Google and its =ult-like economy"
