How long should you stay and I'll organize a ticket Sent from my iPhone On Jun 13, 2017, at 9:19 PM, Kevin Ouvrc wrote: Hi I just want to let you know my schedule as Jeffrey wanted me to start on some path and roads on GSJ. I shall be available to come if needed on the 21 for few days whether it's necessary. The last part of my schematic design is taking me longer than I thought, I 'm almost done, but I'll need the week still. Best regards, Kevin.

Please find attached a visual of the basket on LSG. - Bismarckia nobilis (blue latan palm) will handle much more wind) you should get rid of the coconut. - New stone wall will be nicer as all surrounded walls are well shaped. having those boulders makes it too rough today. -Alamanda flower, should get ok. Just change the one that has trouble to grow. Regarding GSJ , I'm putting everything together this week (new idea, new locations, details etc... ) and I shall send you a file at the end of the week. I'll be available in three weeks to make the first road and some path. Best regards, Kevin.
