Frankly this is nonsense. They always ask one more=thing . I told them they had until Monday to agree a price of 15m euro. Th=y said no. They have not provided any useful information to date. No tax a=vice, etc., no bvi to stiftung. An audit that shows 60m value. All s=lly! As you might imagine, I am done with this. ie. banks do not certify f=nd origination. They have no knowledge of it. That is why it is always lef= to the accounting firms. Again, silly. Thanks for your help. look forward to seeing you soon.
