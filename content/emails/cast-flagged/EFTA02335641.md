| **From** | "G. Max" Ms. Maxwell: Please inform Mr. Epstein that I am still working the qoute for changing the 727's shades to the electric style he saw last week. Mr. Epstein requested a quote for doing the Bedroom only. They returned a very vague quote for the office and bedroom combined. They are to have a more accurate price for the bedroom only, the bedroom combined with office, and the entire airplane (three seperate proposals) by early next week. Thank You! Sincerely; Larry M.
