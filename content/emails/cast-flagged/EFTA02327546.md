| **Subject** | Chef Hi Steve, So Francis cooked tonight for a dinner for Jeffrey. Jeffrey wasn't very enth=sed. He thought it was a bit bland. Granted JE told him he wanted very ligh= and healthy, so that's what he got! It definitely could have been kicked u= a notch. I would like him to do another dinner where he just goes for it, n= "light and healthy" restrictions type thing. JE is leaving town on Saturda= night, so it will need to be after he returns to NY. Also, I wasn't sure how to handle compensation for his cooking tonight; how m=ch, etc? Thanks again for your help.=?xml version=.0" encoding=TF-8"?> <IDOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/Propertylist-1.0.dtd"> <plist version=.0"> <dict> <key>date-sent</key> <real>1316748765</real> <key>flags</key> <integer>8590195713</integer> <key>original-mailbox< e > <string>imap:/ <key>remote-id</key> <string>6239</string> <key>subject</key> <string>Chef</string> </dict> </plist> ent%20Messages</string> 1 EFTA_R1_01251640 EFTA02327546 |
