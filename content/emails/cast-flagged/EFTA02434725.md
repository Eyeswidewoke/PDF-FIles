Hi Andrew, 
It was great to see you dancing like a teenager. 
I don't know if your brother works with you but he is also a lot of fun. 
Coming back to business, as you are aware, the transaction can be structured in many ways. 
I. Do you want the tax benefits? ( contract, depreciation, etc...) 
2. Do you want the possibility of taking public later, if so. Initial transaction needs preparation

3. Do you want this to be he hub of a larger acquisition strategy..., i.e. Do you want to buy other 
agencies for paper? 
Call me to let me know how you have finished the evening. I have an idea as the blond girl with short 
hair was all over you, but I have left early. 
Best 
Jean Luc

Hi Jean Luc, 
Amazing last night! I have to tell you how my night ended! 
Regarding your email. Lets talk next week. Would this assume that the new company does not take on 
the IRS liability?

Hi Andrew, 
On an operating basis-yes, However, to recreatethe network,and current "assets",it would take 2-3 years 
and more money than that. The businesses usually are valued at one times revenue. Most recent sales 
have been a small multiple of that. I am aware of the potential, as are you. If you prefer, we can 
structure it as a convertible preferred. I look forward to hearing from you.
