After talking to Larry an' said he remembers dropping the lamp off at the plane, and Larry remembers unloading the lamp in St.Thomas. He says it's highly possible it even went on the heli upon arrival. It was quite heavy and wrapped in a dark blue moving blanket. That was what Larry remembered about it; the moving blanket and the weight of it. If you could do some investigating on your end, that would be great. Thank you!

I haven't seen it since at either location. Anyone seen it? <IMG_4664.jpeg> LSJ,LLC Island Manager 6100 Red Hook Quarters Suite B3 St Thomas USVI 00802 1 EFTA_R1_01259338 EFTA02329749 |
