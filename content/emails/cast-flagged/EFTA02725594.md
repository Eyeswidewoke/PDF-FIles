Thank you Ms. Amos for that lovely introduction. 
I would like to thank Council President Richard Haas for 
the kind invitation. 
I would also like to thank Council member, and Vice 
Chairman of Human Rights Watch, Joel Motley and our 
Mr. Gregory Brown for their assistance with our visit. 
And thanks to all of you for coming here today to join in 
this dialogue, to learn about, and hopefully to support 
Libya in this time of magnificent transformation. 
Ladies and Gentlemen, 
My Libyan colleagues and I have had a wonderful visit 
here over the past few days, highlighted by meetings at 
receptions held by President Obama, Secretary General Ban 
Ki Moon, and bilateral meetings with many distinguished

world leaders, of whom I mention Madam Secretary 
Hillary Clinton, British Prime Minister David Cameron, 
former president Bill Clinton, Senator John McCain, 
Secretary General of Nato, President of the European 
Council, Executive Director of the World bank, and many 
others. And I am delighted to be meeting with all of you 
today. 
We have been heartened by the warm feelings of these 
world leaders for Libya and its revolution, the expressions 
of support, and offers for continued engagement and 
technical assistance. 
The Libyan revolution has captured the world imagination 
since it broke out spontaneously on February 17 2011, and 
the world followed with great interest the heroics of the 
young Libyan Freedom fighters who came from all walks 
of life. They fought against overwhelming odds, sacrificed 
life and limb, and settled for nothing less than victory 
against the regime that oppressed them for 42 years. This 
victory was achieved nearly a year ago. With that, Libya 
3

EFTA02725596

began the hard process of building a true democracy. 
The process culminated on July 7 of this year with an 
election of the General National Congress, an election that 
all observers testified as free and fully transparent, and the 
General National Congress selected me as its first 
President. A new prime minister was elected less than 2 
weeks ago by the Congress to begin the task of forming the 
first legitimate democratic government in Libya. 
We have many difficult tasks ahead on the road to security, 
peace and democracy. We are fully aware of the difficulties 
and the dangers that we face, both within Libya and from 
outside, and I will discuss some of these challenges today. 
One of the dangers came into stark reality on September 11 
with the brutal terrorist attack on the US mission in 
Benghazi, in which Ambassador Christopher Stevens and 3 
of his colleagues were killed. We mourned the death of the 
American victims and a number of their Libyan guards who 
died trying to defend them against overwhelming use of

EFTA02725597

force. We appreciated the measured response of the US 
administration. We shared with the American people in 
this tragic loss, because we too lost a great friend of Libya 
who understood the Libyan cause of freedom, and rendered 
tremendous support for which the Libyan people will 
always be grateful. We will defeat the terrorists who killed 
Ambassador Chris Stevens and who neither represent 
Libya, nor represent Islam; a religion of tolerance, love and 
peace. We will not rest until justice is done and the 
terrorists brought to justice. As President Obama said in 
speaking to the UN earlier this week "our future will be 
determined by people like Chris Stevens, not by his 
killers." 
We will continue undeterred on the road for real 
democracy, by tackling the security situation which 
resulted from the power vacuum which was itself the result 
of the fall of the oppressive Gaddafi regime. We are now 
working hard to integrate the regional militias who kept 
order during our revolution into the new centralized Libyan 
armed forces. We are strengthening these military and 
5 
EFTA_R1_02213121 
EFTA02725598

security forces under central commands. In addition to 
dealing with the security situation we are launching a major 
economic and social development plan, overhauling the 
deteriorated healthcare and educational systems, reforming 
the administrative system, and seeking to diversify our oil-
dependent economy in order to provide meaningful job 
opportunities to all Libyans. 
In a new Libya, we seek not revenge but reconciliation, not 
exclusion but inclusiveness. We will protect civil liberties 
and human rights, especially for women and minorities; we 
will fight corruption and poverty, and we seek a better 
standard of living for our people who have suffered through 
decades of deprivation. 
During the decades of Gadaffi's rule, almost all of our 
government was centralized in Tripoli. In order to make 
our government more responsive and more effective, we 
are decentralizing many activities, including health and 
education, so that government will become less remote and 
more responsive to the needs of all Libyans. Increased 
6 
EFTA_R1_02213122 
EFTA02725599

freedom for local governments is an important element of 
our new democracy, and we hope it would serve as a 
bulwark against any future effort to concentrate power in a 
central tyranny in Libya. 
We seek an open economy and transparent system to 
rebuild our infrastructure, free the private sector to initiate 
projects, to create employment and to encourage 
entrepreneurship. 
The new Libya will respect the United Nations Charter, and 
live in peace with its neighbors and the rest of the world 
community. We will confirm our African identity and 
engage with our African neighbors. We call for respect of 
human rights, including for women and minorities. We call 
for resolving all border conflicts through the international 
legal system. We affirm the role of the International 
Criminal Court and support all international organizations 
that promote the cause of peace, freedom, liberty, fairness, 
human rights and justice

We believe that there can be no durable peace in the world 
unless human and political rights are respected everywhere, 
and until there is justice and opportunity for all. Since 
some of these rights will invariably be viewed differently in 
different countries, moderation and mutual respect is 
crucial to maintaining a civil society. I have an example 
involving the American concept of freedom of speech, 
which I submit must live respectfully among other central 
ideals both in America and abroad. In my country, and for 
Muslims everywhere, mocking the Prophet Mohammed is a 
crime, and it is punished harshly. Even in America, as I 
understand it, the right to freedom of speech does not 
extend to the right to scream "fire" in a crowded theater. 
Recently a movie that was made in America mocked and 
denigrated the Prophet Mohammed in a shameless way, 
and I would suggest, this is not so different from screaming 
fire in a crowded theater. It is crazy, inflammatory, and 
certain to cause mayhem or a brawl, and this has happened 
around the Muslim world in reaction to this film. So, as 
President of a Muslim nation, I would ask Americans to 
please not artificially elevate freedom of speech above all 
8 
EFTA_R1_02213124 
EFTA02725601

other principles and values and to instead exercise 
moderation and respect in the treatment of the Prophet 
Mohammed. Doing this will go far to enable the mutual 
respect and trust between Americans and Muslims on 
which we all rely, and ultimately upon which the future of 
the planet may rely. Thank you for please considering this 
mutually-respectful approach. 
Libya has now turned a new leaf, from being run by a 
dictatorship that used terrorism and murder and blackmail 
as instruments of policy, in which the whims of a dictator 
became the laws of the land, to a country that respects its 
obligations under the United Nations Charter, calls for 
genuine peace based on justice, and cooperates with other 
nations of the world for the common interests of the people, 
but many challenges remain. 
In addition to the physical security issues that I mentioned 
before, we have additional huge challenges: We need to 
create stable meaningful jobs for over 25% of our 
population, primarily young people. We need to create 
9 
EFTA_R1_02213125 
EFTA02725602

housing, roads, power plants, schools, and hospitals, to 
make up for four decades of despotic Gaddafi rule, during 
which period many parts of the country received no 
investment. We need to recover as much as possible of the 
assets that were stolen by the Gaddafi regime or otherwise 
misappropriated, so that these assets are available to 
support the redevelopment of the New Libya. And we need 
to modernize and expand our energy production sector, as 
this is the economic engine that will be essential in 
supporting so much of Libya's development. 
As in all great revolutions, the expectations among the 
people for immediate change far outrun what is actually 
possible in the short term, so there is presently great 
pressure on the young Libyan democracy to perform for 
our people. If we, the democratic government, fail to 
perform for our people, this will be a huge setback for our 
democracy. To successfully and expeditiously tackle the 
many challenges I just listed, Libya will need foreign 
partners, foreign investors, and foreign supporters, and we 
hope that many of these will come from the United States.

Let me close on a personal note. Just one year ago, I was 
living here in United States in Atlanta, in my 30th year in 
exile from Libya. Along with many other Libyans, some of 
whom are here with me in the room today, I was forced
