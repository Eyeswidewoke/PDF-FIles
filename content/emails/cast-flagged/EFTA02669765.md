My sisters perspective from Europe 
I am looking at this from over here in Germany. American politics gets reduc=d in the end to only a few issues: pro-life or 
pro-choice, gun laws, and es=ablishment vs. anti-establishment. Political categories are so wishy washy a=d intermingled 
with what is termed 'liberal' and 'conservative' that one fo=gets what they actually mean. 
Of course, not everybody who voted for Trump is sexist or a racist, but, on s=me level, they didn't care if he is. He knew 
how to gather momentum with th= discourse he chose, and, even if he changes his tone, he has let loose a s=orm. We 
will brace ourselves over here for Putin's eventual takeover of the=Baltic States. Putin has extended his power back into 
Republic of Georgia, t=e Crimea, and Armenia. Trump has said that he would not come to the aid of N=to allies if they 
were attacked. IS is the least of our problems here in Ge=many; Erdogan is a much larger threat, for now. 
I don't see Hillary Clinton as being at fault. I see the growth of nationali=m (all throughout the world, not just in the USA) 
and an underestimation of=the fear that non-Hispanic whites have about the trajectory they are on to b=come a 
minority (in the USA and other European countries). 
Every news show, talk show, etc here is discussing and analysing the fallout=of Trump's win. German politicians are 
hoping to learn from it, to stem the=growth of the right wing AFD party here. As far as I know, Merkel is the on=y leader 
who congratulated Trump with a warning.
