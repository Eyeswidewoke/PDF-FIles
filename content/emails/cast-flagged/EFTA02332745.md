| **Subject** | Air Boat Ride: Steve Weaver is no longer at Pompano Helicopters. They were his contacts. Floyd Maxson who is a freind that flew your B407 from STT-PBI has contacts for a Air Boat ride that you can land a helicopter at. He is availible Sunday or Monday. He flys a B407 in PBI that you may use, but you have to fly from the left seat if we want to use that 8407. If you want to fly from the right seat, you can use Jim's helicopter at Pompano (Flyod also flies for Jim.) Your thoughts? Dave has vaction on April 7-10 Do you know of any flying during that time? would like to use Pete since we will be in the Boeing. Gulf stream will be in maintenance from April 5-15.
