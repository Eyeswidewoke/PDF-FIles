14 The Virgin Islands Daily News 
Prince Andrew a distraction 
as royal wedding approaches 
By CASSANDRA YINOGRAD 
The Associated Press 
LONDON — Less than two 
months before a fairytale wedding 
anticipated by much of the world, 
Britain's royal 
family finds itself 
fighting an incon-
venient distrac-
tion: revelations 
that Prince 
Andrew, the 
queen's second 
son, is friends 
with a convicted 
sex offender, was 
photographed with 
a teenage prosti-
tute, and has been accused of ties to 
Moammar Gadhafi's Libyan regime. 
The Duke of York also hosted the 
son of the Tunisian dictator shortly 
before a popular uprising drove him 
from power — and the buildup of 
embarrassment has sparked calls that 
he be stripped of his role as special 
U.K. trade representative. 
Buckingham Palace is in damage 
control mode as it attempts to keep 
the public's focus on the April 29 
Prince 
Andrew 
wedding between Prince William and 
tabloid favorite Kate Middleton, his 
college sweetheart. 
British officials have rallied to 
Andrew's defense. The foreign secre-
tary expressed his "confidence" in 
Andrew on Sunday, and a U.K. trade 
official voiced support for the prince 
to remain in the position, saying he 
does a "very valuable job." 
But pressure is mounting and there 
is growing speculation over how long 
Andrew can hang on to his post. 
Since becoming a special trade 
representative in 2001, Andrew has 
drawn criticism for reportedly taking 
lavish trips in his role as an unpaid 
trade ambassador. 
The latest revelations in the British 
media have centered on Andrew's 
friendship with convicted pedophile 
Jeffrey Epstein. 
Photos recently published in the 
British media show Andrew strolling 
in a park with Epstein — the New 
York billionaire jailed for soliciting 
underage prostitutes in Florida. Most 
recently, a photograph emerged 
showing Andrew with his arm around 
the waist of the teenage prostitute at 
the center of that case.
