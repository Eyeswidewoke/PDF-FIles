| **Subject** | Re: Dear Karyna, Would you like me to speak with him? Do you think this is Marc being obstruc=ive or acting on instructions from a difficult owner? Frankly I don'= understand why they need all this information. If an offer is on the table=they either accept it or ask for more. Once a price is agreed, then it =99s up to the buyer to perform. Only if the buyer fails to perform should t=ey start to be difficult. Let me know if you want me to talk to him.
