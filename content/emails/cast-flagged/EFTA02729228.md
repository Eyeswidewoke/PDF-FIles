in New Ifork's largest

EFTA02729229

n Manhattan's 
Upper EEaapp Side. home to some of the 
most ezpdtsive real estate on earth, exists 
the crown jewel of the city's residential 
town houses. With its IS-foot-high oak door, 
huge arched windows, and nine floors, it 
sits on—or. rather. commands—the block 
of 71st Street between Fifth and Madison 
Avenues. Almost ludicrously out of pro-
portion with its four- and five-story neigh-
bors, it seems more Like an institution than 
a house. This is perhaps not surprising -
until 1989 it was the Birch Wathen private 
school. Now it is said to be Manhattan's 
largest private residence. 
Inside. amid the flurry of menservants 
attired in sober black suits and pristine 
white gloves. you feel you have stumbled 
into someone's private Xanadu. This is 
no mere rich person's home, but a high-
walled. eclectic. imperious fantasy that 
seems to hint no boundaries. 
The entrance hall is decorated not with 
paintings but with row upon row of indi-
vidually framed eyeballs: these, the owner 
tells people with relish, were imported from 
England. where they were made for in-
jured soldiers. Nen comes a marble foyer, 
which does have a painting, in the man-
ner of Jean Dubutiet ... but the host coyly 
refuses to tell visitors who painted it. In any 
case. guests are like pygmies next to the 
nearby mice-life-size sculpture of a naked 
African warrior. 
Despite its eccentricity the house is curi-
ously impersonal. the statement of someone 
who wants to be known for the scale of his 
possessions. Its occupant, financier Jeffrey 
Epstein, 50, admits to friends that he likes it 
when people think of him this way. A good-
looking man, resembling Ralph Lauren, 
with thick gray-white hair and a weathered 
face, he usually dresses in jeans, knit shins, 
and loafers. He tells people he bought the 
house because he knew he "could never live 
anywhere bigger." He thinks 51.000 square 
ket is an appropriately large space for some. 
one like himself, who deals mostly in large 
concepts—especially large sums of money.

Guests are invited to lunch or dinner at 
the town house—Epstein usually refers to the 
former as "tea," since he likes to eat bite-
size morsels and drink copious quantities of 
Earl Gisy. (He does not touch alcohol or to-
bacco.) Tea is served in the "leather mom," 
so called because of the cordovan-colored 
fabric on the walls. The chairs are covered 
in a leopard print, and on the wall hangs a 
huge, Oriental fantasy of a woman holding 
an opium pipe and caressing a snarling a 
onskin. Under her gaze, plates of finger 
sandwiches are delivered to Epstein and 
guests by the menservants in white gloves. 
Upstairs, to the right of a spiral stair-
case, is the "office." an enormous gallery 
spanning the width of the house. Strangely, 
it holds no computer. Computers belong in 
the "computer room" to smaller mom at 
the back of the house). Epstein has been 
known to say. The office features a gilded 
desk (which Epstein tells people belonged 
to banker J. P. Morgan). 18thwentury black 
lacquered Portuguese cabinets. and a nine-
foot ebony Steinway "D" grand. On the 
desk, a paperback copy of the Marquis de 
Sade's The Miyanunes of Hrwe was it-
cently spotted. Covering the 9oor. Epstein 
has explained. "is the lamest Persian rug 
you'll ever see in a private home—so big. it 
must have come from a mosquc." Amid 
such splendor, much of which reflects the 
work of the French decorator .Alberto Pin-
to. who has worked for Jacques Chirac and 
the royal families of Jordan and Saudi Ara-
bia. there is one particularly startling oddi• 
ty: a stuffed black poodle. standing atop 
the grand piano. "No decorator would ever 
tell you to do that." Epstein brags to visi-
tors. "But I want people to think what it 
means to stuff a dog." People can't help 
but feel it's Epstein's way of saying that he 
always has the last wont. 
In addition to the town house. Epstein 
lives in what is reputed to be the largest 
private dwelling in New Mexico. on an SIB 
million. 7.500-acre ranch which he named 
"Zorro." "It makes the town house look 
a shack." Epstein has said. He also owns 
Little St. James. a 70-acre island in the 
U.S. Virgin Islands. where the main house 
is currently being renovated by Edward Tut-
tle, a designer of the Amanresorts. There is 
also a S6.8 million house in Palm Beach, 
Florida, and a fleet of aircraft: a Gulftutain 
IV, a helicopter. and a Boeing 727. replete 
with trading room, on which Epstein re-
cently flew President Clinton. actors Chris 
Tucker and Kevin Spacey, supermarket 
magnate Ron Bustle. Lew Wasserman's

the charm slip into his eyes. They arc steely 
and calculating. giving some hint at the 
steady whir of machinery running behind 
them. "Let's play chess," he said to me, af-
ter 'reusing to give an interview for this arti-
cle. "You be white. You get the first mow." 
It was an appropriate metaphor for a man 
who seems to feel he can win no matter 
what the advantage of the other side. /lir 
advantage is that no one really seems to 
know him or his history completely or what 
his arsenal actually consists of He has care-
fully engineered it so that he remains one 
of the few truly baffling mysteries among 
New York's moneyed world. People know 
snippets, but few know the whole. 
"He's wry enigmatic." says Rosa Mond-
ton, the former C.E.O. of Tiffany & Co. in 
the U.K. and a dose friend since the early 
1980s. "You think you know him and then 
you peel off another ring of the onion skih 
and there's something else extraordinary 
underneath. He never reveals his hand.... 
He's a classic iceberg. What you see is not 
what you get:' 
ven acquaintances sense a 
curious dichotomy: Yes he 
lives like a "modem ma-
haraja: as Leah Kiernan, 
one of his art dealers. puts 
it. Yet he is fastidiously. al-
most obsessively private—he 
lists himself in the phone book under a 
pseudonym. He rarely attends society gath-
erings or weddings or funerals: he considers 
eating in restaurants like -eating on the sub-
way"—i.e.. something he'd never do. There 
are many women in his r*. mostly young, 
but there is no one of them to whom he 
has been able to commit. He describes his 
most public companion of the last decade, 
Ghislaine Mansell. 41. the daughter of the 
Late, disgraced media baron Robert Max' 
well, as simply his "best friend.' He says 
she is not on his payroll, but she seems 
to organize much of his life—recently she 
was making telephone inquiries to find a 
California-based yoga instructor for him. 
(Epstein is still close to his two other long-
term girlfriends, Paula Heil Fisher. a for-
ma associate of his at the brokerage firm 
Bear Stearns and now an opera producer, 
and Eva Andersson Dubin. a doctor and 
onetime mode/. He tells people that when 
a relationship is over the girlfriend "mows 
up, not down." to friendship status.) 
Some of the businessmen who dine with 
him at his home—they include newspaper 
publisher Mon Zuckerman. banker Louis 
Ranieri. Revlon chairman Ronald Perelman, 
real-estate tycoon Leon Black. former Mi-
crosoft executive Nathan Myhrvold. Tom 
Pritzker (or Hyatt Hotels), and real-estate

personality Donald Trump—sometimes 
seem not all that clear as to what he ac-
tually does to earn his millions. Certainly, 
you won't find Epstein's transactions writ-
ten about on Bloomberg or talked about in 
the trading rooms. "The trading aim don't 
seem to know hurt It's unusual for animals 
that big not to leave any footprints in the 
snow," says a high-laid investment manager. 
Unlike such fund managers as George 
Soros and Stanley Druciceruniller, whose 
client fists and stock maneuverings act as 
their calling cards, Epstein keeps all his 
deals and clients secret. bar one client: bil-
lionaire Leslie Warner, the respected chair-
man of Limited &grids. Epstein insists that 
ever since he left Bear Stearns in 1981 he 
has managed money only for billionaires—
who depend on him for discretion. "I was 
the only person crazy enough, or 
arrogant enough. or misplaced 
enough, to make my limit a bil• 
lion dollars or more," he tells peo-
pk freely. According to him, the 
Bat fees he receives from his clients. 
combined with his skill at playing 
the currency markets - with very 
large sums of money," have afforded 
hint the lifestyle he enjoys today. 
Why do billionaires choose him 
as their trustee? Because the prob-
lems of the mega-rich. he tells peo-
ple. are different from yours and 
mine. and his unique philosophy is 
central to understanding those problems: 
"Very kw people need any more money 
when they have a billion dollars. The key 
is not to have it do harm more than any-
thing else.... You don't want to lose your 
money." 
e has likened his job to 
that of an architect—more 
specific*. one who spe-
cializes in remodeling: -I 
always describe (a billion-
aire) as someone who 
started out in a small 
2 home and as he became wealthier had add-
