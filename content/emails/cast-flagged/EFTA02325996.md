I was going to send Jojo with su=urban with the things for the plane at 8:30am so he can get there around 10=m to load the plane with Larry. It's about 1.5 drive to the plane from the c=ty. Does that sound ok to you? <?xml version=.0" encoding=TF-8"?> <IDOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/Propertylist-1.0.dtd"> <plist version=.0"> <dict> <key>date-sent</key> <real>1315082737</real> <key>flags</key> <integer>8590195713</integer> <key>original-mailbox</key> <string>imap://sarahk525@mail.mac.com/Sent%20Messages</string> <key>remote-id</key> <string>5793</string> <key>subject</key> <string></string> </dict> </plist> 1 EFTA_R1_01246190 EFTA02325996 |
