Hey Kim,&n=sp; 
The only thing that mig=t be useful to us is the wooden plank dining table in this photo. Also not 
s=re if the wooden coffee table is available too? That would be it from the P=lm Beach batch. The issue I have is that 
Janusz is in NY at the moment fill=ng in for the NY staff while they are on vacation. We don't have anyone in P= right 
now who could come pick up the items. Is there anyway we could pick u= the table at a later date?
