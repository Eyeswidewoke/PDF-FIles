| **From** | Nowak, Martin |
| **To** | Jeffrey E. dear Jeffrey it was great to talk. our current lease ends on 30 June 2015. in September 2014 May has to present a finance plan of PED. so it would be good to get something this summer. we could then extend our lease until 2017. (in 2017 the master lease of the kennedy school ends. then the space could be leased directly from the owners of the building.) m <?xml version=.0" encoding=TF-8"?> <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"> <plist version=.0"> <dict> <key>date-last-viewed</key> <real>0.0</real> <key>date-received</key> <real>1399844384</real> <key>flags</key> <integer>8590195713</integer> <key>original-mailbox</key> <string>imap://jeevacation@imap.gmail.com/%5BGmail%5D/All%20Mail</string> <key>remote-id</key> <string>409056</string> </dict> </plist> EFTA_R1_01299463 EFTA02337896 |
