DONOR OF THE DAY I By Laura Landro 
r Survivor's Prescription for Care 
As both cancer survivor and 
physician, Eva Andersson-Du-
bin is all too familiar with the 
lack of access to coordinated, 
seamless patient care for pa-
tients confronting breast can-
cer. 
That's why she and her hus-
band, philanthropist and 
hedge-fund executive Glenn 
Dubin, donated $15 million and 
helped raise another 87.4 mil-
lion to create the Dubin Breast 
Center at the Mount Sinai 
Medical Center, which will be 
completed next week. 
The center, in a L5,000-
square-foot space carved out 
of some old offices on the first 
floor of the Fifth Avenue IGin-
genstein Pavillion, is a compre-
hensive state-of-the-art facility 
that promises integrated care 
for women in one place from 
the time they are diagnosed 
through recovery and after-
care. 
Dr. Andersson-Dubin, a for-
mer Miss Sweden and model 
for the Ford agency, left the 
glamorous life to attend medi-
cal school at the Karolinicsa In-
stitute School of Medicine in 
Stockholm, and then at UCLA 
School of Medicine, where she 
received her MD. She com-
pleted her medical residency at 
Lenox Hill Hospital, then 
worked in corporate medical 
clinics, finding time along the 
way to marry Mr. Dubin, a co-
founder and chief executive of 
Highbridge Capital, the multi-
billion dollar hedge fund 
owned by J.P. Morgan Chase & 
Ca The couple have three chil-
dren. They have been active in 
many charities, and Mr. Dubin 
was a founding board member 
of the Robin Hood Foundation, 
and joined the Mount Sinai 
Board of Trustees in 2004. 
But 31/2 years ago, they 
faced a medical crisis of their 
own when Dr. Andersson-Dubin 
was diagnosed with Stage One 
breast cancer. Despite her pro-
fessional savvy and connec-
tions, she found herself navi-
gating the fragmented world of 
cancer care, dealing with sev-
eral doctors who were rarely 
in communication with each 
other. 
•I had to lug my charts 
around everywhere and be re-
sponsible for everything, and 
everyone taking care of me 
was in a different location," 
she says. 
That won't be the case at 
Mount Sinai, where Dr. Ander-
sson-Dubin was intimately in-
volved in every aspect of the 
new center's design, picking 
out fabrics and photographs in 
the welcoming reception area 
and private chemotherapy in-
fusion rooms, she says. She 
says she chose Mount Sinai be-
cause of its commitment to 
building up its cancer care and 
its recruitment of George Rap-
tis, a top oncologist who came 
from Columbia University Col-
lege of Physicians and Sur-
geons and formerly worked at 
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Can-
cer Center. 
Dr. Andersson-Dubin fre-
quently confers with Dr. Raptis 
and surgeon Elisa Port, who 
will serve as co-directors of 
the center. In addition to pa-
tient care, the center will have 
weekly meetings on transla-
tional medicine—the incorpo-
ration of the latest research 
findings into treatment. 
In addition to clinicians for 
radiology, medical oncology, 
surgery, and radiation, the cen-
ter will provide psychosocial 
support—including holistic 
therapies such as massage, nu-
trition, and patient counseling. 
With doctors, nurses, and so-
cial workers under one roof, 
Dr. Andersson-Dubin expects 
communication and teamwork 
to be easier, making for seam-
less transitions of care. But 
most importantly, she says, 
"the patient's needs are going 
to come first."
