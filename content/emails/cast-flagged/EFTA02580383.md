Re: 
Can you set up Google Chrome an= use Incognito Mode? 
If you search while signed into your Google account i= impacts things, but using Incognito mode will resolve that. 
Chrome h=re ht=ps://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/ 
<https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/> 
Once installed... 
Open an incognito window 
1. 
Click the Chrom= menu <https://storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/SNP=2696434_en_v1> on the 
browser toolbar. 
2. 
Select New incognito window. 
3. 
A new window wi=l open with the incognito icon 
<https://www.google.com/hel=/hc/images/chrome_95464.gif> in the corner. 
You can a=so use the keyboard shortcuts Ctrl+Shift+N (Windows, Linux, and Chrome OS) and=C2QX-Shift-N=/strong> 
(Mac) to open an incognito window.

Mr. Epstein, 
We currently have two negatives on first page in Google but one is at 6th a=d the other at 7th. 
(Universal search, no history applied). Results will b= very different if that PC has been used to click or search any of the

Using Google Chrome + InCognito Mode + Clearing B=owser Cache = only reliable reporting. I can help

Much progress has been made since we spoke - premium placeme=ts are getting secured over next 
week, hundreds of links have been built t= your primary sites and the first movements are kicking in today (NYMag

see it in the scr=enshot above (it reads Cash Advance advertisement in the short-description=. This is something a
