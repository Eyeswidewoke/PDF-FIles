Beat on Revenues and Taxes, =artially Offset by Expense Miss BK reported operating EPS of $0.82, =eat consensus' and 
our estimates of $0.80 on higher fees (4c), lower =axes (2c), lower provision (lc), partially offset by higher expenses =4c) 
and lower NIl (1c). Expense miss disappointing as BK had been an =xpense-save story. Expenses up <1% y/y and gig v. 
our estimates of =% down q/q and y/y. Management has attributed such increase to =egulatory and compliance costs. 
We look to the call for more color. =xpense ratio stood at 69.0%, 80bps lower than our estimate of 68.2%; =till an 
improvement from prior quarters: 47bps improvement q/q, and =30bps improvement y/y. NIM in line with our estimate 
at 1.13%, up 3bps =/q on an adjusted basis (4Q16 had a few one-offs). Earning assets =hrank faster than we expected at 
-2% q/q (v. MSe of flat q/q).Higher =ees primarily driven by clearing services fees (2c beat), asset =anagement fees (lc 
beat) and others (2c), partially offset by FX =rading (lc miss)Tax rate lower at 23.4% v. MSe of 25.0%, primarily =riven by 
new accounting guidance (ASU 2016-09) on stock awards.Volume: =ixed with AUC miss and AUM beat: AUC up 2.3% q/q 
(MSe +3.0%) and up =.2% y/y (MSe +5.8%) AUM up 4.8% gig (MSe +3.5%) and up 5.4% y/y (MSe =4.1%)Key Questions
