When the girl told Epstein, 
"I am 16 years old and just 
want to model," he remied. 
"Don't worry, 1 won't tell any-
body." court papers say. 
Epstein, said by Londe§ 
Mail ON Sunday to be a close 
friend of Engiandk Prince 
Andrew, has been indicted in 
Paint Beach on charges of so-
liciting underage prostitutes. 
That case is pending. 
The girl visited Epstein 
"several times over the sev-
eral months and engaged in 
bizarre and unnatural sex 
acts" while she was a minor, 
the lawsuit says. 
Epstein "repeatedly re-
quested that (the girl) return 
with her 14-, 15-, and 16-
yearold girlfriends, stating. 
'Come by with your friends 
your age next time. Don't 
bring Sherrie (a mutual 
friend in her 40s). I
 girls 
your age.' " 
The young woman, now 
23, kept returning to Epstein 
because she has "mental 
issues," said her lawyer, Wil-
liam 1 Unroch. He refused to 
elaborate, but court papers 
say she was "disabled as a re-
sult of severe mental disease 
and defect." 
Epsteink lawyer in New 
York, Gerald LefLeitul, said, 
'The girl has admitted she 
is insane, but she can read a 
newspaper and recognize the 
word tick'
Lefcourt also said the 
statute of limitations has 
expired for the wornank 
case criminally and civilly, 
and will almost certainly be

TALLAHASSEE — Floridak 
move to shift Medicaid 
patients into managed Lem 
plans has made it hard for 
some patients to get access 
to care, and a planned expan-
sion of the reform should be 
delayed until the pr„ Mans 
are fixed, a review by the 
state Medicaid agency has 
tbund. 
The review of the change 
General, is the first evalua-
tion of how smoothly — or 
not — the shift is going in 
Florida. 
The shift of Medicaid pa-
tients into private managed 
care plans is being tested in 
pilot projects in the Jackson-
ville and Fort. Lauderdale 
areas. 
But AKA inspector Gen-
eral Linda Keen said some 
Medicaid recipients in the 
trial runs have had trouble

dismissed. 
He refused to comment on 
Epsteins Florida charges. 
Meanwhile, Unroch, 51, 
also acknowledged that his 
client was living with him 
and was at the center of a S10 
million lawsuit he filed last 
year against a neighbor who 
said he was having sex with 
underage girls. 1'hat case is 
pending. 
"What she was doing at 
22 is irrelevant to what hap-
pened to her when she was 
16," Unroch said Wednesday. 
He went on the say he hoped 
Epstein would agree to `do 
right" by his client and re-
solve the case out of court.
