We will need Euros as well as dollars to make sure he has=enough cash for the trip. I don't know what kind of money they use in Abu d=abi and Dubai, but maybe you can try and get some..won't need alot, but I a=ways feel more comfortable having some local money before we go. I won't be=back in ny until Sunday, so perhaps someone can take it to the house tomorr=w and have Sue put it in his black bag? Pls let me know.
