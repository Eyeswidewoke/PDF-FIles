| **CC** | I saw 8H. I wouldn't want to keep any of the furniture. The kitchen and bath=oom are in decent condition. I would replace the appliances though. It need= to be painted and ideally the wood floors refinished. 2G closets are in and look great. All door knobs are on, etc. The kitchen also could use a remodel. The cabinets are in good condition, bu= the floor isn't t the nicest. It needs new appliances. I would recommend a= least getting new appliances for now. The shields are still in New Guinea. I spoke to the woman today. She is havi=g issues with her contact there getting them packaged and shipped. She is p=anning on flying there herself to take care of the first 2 weeks of May. I'm having 2 proofs printed of black and white LSJ print for 71st dining roo= on 2 different types of canvas to see which one is best. The proofs will b= ready on Wed. I was hoping to try and make a 10pm flight tonight to Charlotte, and fly bac= to NY Wednesday morning if you are OK with that. If not, no worries I will=stay in NY. I would need to leave for airport by 8pm. <?xml version=.0" encoding=TF-8"?> <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC IV/Apple/MID PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/Propertylist-1.0.dtd"> <plist version=.0"> alict> <key>date-sent</key> <real>1333405776</real> <key>flags</key> <integer>8590195713</integer> <key>original-mailbox</key> <string>imap:/ <key>remote-id</key> <string>9799</string> <key>subject</key> <string></string> </dict> </plist> Sent%20Messages</string> EFTA_R1_01179334 EFTA02305244 |
