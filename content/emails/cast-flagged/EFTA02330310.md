I have spoken to Jeffrey and he says you can come and take back the =onos from the apt. If you'd like to coordinate with Valdson, the house =anager, a time to go to the apt that works for both of you. His number =s 0613014377. I wasn't able to get any further answers regarding the rest of the =uote. I will try! Thank you..
