| **Subject** | Re: trip to Japan Hi Joi and Mizuka, Thank you again so much for your help! Yes, we would love to take some cooking lessons. Neither of us has learned a=out Japanese cooking, so we would probably need to start with the basics, a=though Jen is a chef, but she has experience only with european/american cu=sine. But we do love Japanese food a lot! at least the American version of i=. Other then food, we probably will do lot's of sightseeing, since this is goi=g to be our first time in Japan. I would love to get to know more about tr=ditional Japanese architecture and design. We would also like to see sumo a=d kabuki performance, as well as kodo and tea ceremony. So if you may have s=ggestions on any of the above, it would be amazing. Otherwise, we are open t= any other recommendations you might have and very much looking forward to t=is trip! Thank you both very much! Karyna. > On Sep 5, 2016, at 5:53 AM, Joi Ito •: :• wrote: > Hi Karyna, > We can try to Skype today or you can tell us what you're looking for and=we can help.
