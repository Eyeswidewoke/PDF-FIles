I wanted to confirm Jeffrey's driver, Janusz, will come pick you up on Sat. Feb. 11th from the Four Seasons Hotel in Miami. He will be at the hotel as early as 3:45pm just in case you are able to depart earlier than expected. Janusz will drive you to Jeffrey's home in PB where you are welcome to stay the evening...Janusz can drive you back to Miami on Sunday...what ever is best for you. Below is Jeffrey's home address and Janusz's cell number. Could you please pass along a cell number for yourself? Janusz is cc'd here as well. Janusz cell: Jeffrey's home address: 358 El Brillo Way Palm Beach, FL 33480 If there is anything else I can help you with, please do not hesitate to ask.
