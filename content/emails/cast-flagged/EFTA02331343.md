| **Subject** | Re: Furniture pick up for Eva Hi Kimberly, The address of the building is 301 E 66th street, he probably will need to park at the service entrance from 67th street and use the service elevator. The furniture is currently in apartment 8A. I will check with someone regarding the time and let you know. Is he picking up only the items attached in your email except for the coffee table? Or is he picking up everything I have attached in the previous email as well?

I (along with Amanda D'Cruz — copied here) will be organizing the Dubin's driver (Steven) to pick up the items attached here. Steven is free between 12:00 and 5:00. What time makes the most sense on your end? Also, will he be going to a loading dock of some sort, or just the front entrance of 66th? Thanks.
