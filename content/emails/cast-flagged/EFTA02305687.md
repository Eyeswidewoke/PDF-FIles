| **Subject** | Re: Bathroom looks good, I really love the tile! The grill as Penn explained should look modern, with horizontal parallel st=ipes, but I haven't seen the final look in real. I know Anthony said i='s going to be 1000-1500$, that's why I thought may be to keep the=old ones, the bathroom came out so expensive.. On Jun 22, 2012 8:04 PM, uot; < <mailto -> wrot=: Thanks. How's the bathroom looking? I think you could definitely use some new radiator covers, so now w=uld be the time to do them before painting. I did tell Penn to go ahead, b=t I've asked him to send me a photo of the grill he plans to use becau=e I want it to be modern, not one of the old traditional looking patterns.=A0 Are you happy with him doing the new covers?

Also there is one bookcase from the store called Lazzoni, that I had to can=ell, as they have changed its design, so there should be a full refund on =our credit card. And also Penn said that they should be done on Thursday with the bathroom i= E, so painting can get started on Friday. 1 EFTA_R1_01180386 EFTA02305687 |
