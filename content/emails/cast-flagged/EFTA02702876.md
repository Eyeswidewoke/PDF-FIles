ABSTRACT 
Workers in insect societies are sometimes observed to kill male eggs of other workers, a phenomenon 
known as worker policing. We perform a mathematical analysis of the evolutionary dynamics of policing. 
We investigate the selective forces behind policing for both dominant and recessive mutations for dif-
ferent numbers of matings of the queen. The traditional, relatedness-based argument suggests that 
policing evolves if the queen mates with more than two males, but does not evolve if the queen mates 
with a single male. We derive precise conditions for the invasion and stability of policing alleles. We And 
that the relatedness-based argument is not robust with respect to small changes in colony efficiency 
caused by policing. We also calculate evolutionarily singular strategies and determine when they are 
evolutionarily stable. We use a population genetics approach that applies to dominant or recessive 
mutations of any effect size.

1. Introduction 
In populations with haplodiploid genetics, unfertilized female 
workers are capable of laying male eggs. Thus, in a haplodiploid 
colony, male eggs can in principle originate from the queen or 
from the workers. Worker policing is a phenomenon where female 
workers kill the male eggs of unmated female workers (Ratnieks. 
1988; Ratnieks and Visscher. 1989; Ratnieks et al., 2006; Gadagkar. 
2001; Wenseleers and Ratnieks, 20064. Worker policing is 
observed in many social insects, including ants, bees, and wasps. 
Yet the precise conditions for the evolution of worker policing are 
still unclear. 
Worker policing (Ratnieks. 1988; Ratnieks et al.. 2006; Gadagkar, 
2001; Wenseleers and Ratnieks. 2006a) and worker sterility (Wilson. 
1971; Hamilton. 1972; Olejarz et al., 2015) are two distinct phe-
nomena that are widespread in the eusocial Hymenoptera. In addi-
tion to worker policing, a subset of workers in a colony may forego 
their own reproductive potential to aid in raising their siblings. Prior 
relatedness-based arguments have suggested that queen monogamy 
is important for the evolution of a non-reproductive worker caste

(Hughes et al.. 2008; Cornwallis et al.. 2010; Queller and Strassmann. 
1998; Foster et al.. 2006; Rootnsma, 2007, 2009). In contrast, it is 
believed that polygamy—not monogamy—is important for the evo-
lution of police workers. 
Several papers have studied the evolution of policing. Starr 
(1984) explores various topics in the reproductive biology and 
sociobiology of eusocial Hymenoptera. He defines promiscuity as 
1 firl_ ill ). where n is the number of matings of each queen, and 
J; is the fractional contribution to daughters by the i-th male mate. 
He writes, regarding workers, that "They are on average less 
related to nephews than brothers whenever (promiscuity is 
greater than two) and should prefer that the queen lay all the male 
eggs. Workers would therefore be expected to interfere with each 
other's reproduction." Thus, Starr (1984) was the first to suggest 
that workers should raise their nephews (sons of other workers) if 
the queen mates once, but should only raise their brothers (sons of 
the queen) if the queen mates more than twice. Starr (1984) uses a 
relatedness-based argument. but he does not provide any calcu-
lation of evolutionary dynamics in support of his argument; he 
uses neither population genetics nor inclusive fitness theory. In a 
book on honeybee ecology, Seeley (1985) also proposed, using a 
relatedness-based argument, that worker policing should occur in 
colonies with multiply mated queens, but that worker policing 
should be absent if queens are singly mated.

Woyciechowski and Lomnicki (1987) perform a calculation 
based on population genetics and conclude that workers should 
raise their nephews (sons of other workers) if the queen mates 
once, but should only raise their brothers (sons of the queen) if the 
queen mates more than twice—the case of double mating is neu-
tral with respect to preference. From this result, they claim that, 
under multiple mating of the queen, natural selection should favor 
non-reproductive workers. Woyciechowski and Lomnicki (1987) 
consider both dominant and recessive alleles affecting worker 
behavior, but they do not consider colony efficiency effects. 
Ratnieks (1988, considers the invasion of a dominant allele for 
policing. Using population genetics, he arrives at essentially the 
same conclusion as Woyciechowski and Lomnicki (1987): In the 
absence of efficiency effects, policing evolves with triple mating 
but not with single mating. But Ramieks also considers colony 
efficiency effects, focusing mainly on the case where policing 
improves colony efficiency. Since policing occurs alongside other 
maintenance tasks (such as cleaning of cells. removal of patho-
gens, incubation of brood), and since eating worker-laid eggs 
might allow workers to recycle some of the energy lost from laying 
eggs. Ramieks supposes that policing improves colony efficiency. 
He finds that worker policing with singly mated queens may 
evolve if policing improves colony reproductive efficiency. He also 
finds that worker policing with triply mated queens may not 
evolve if policing reduces colony reproductive efficiency, but he 
considered this case to be unlikely on empirical grounds. Ratnieks 
does not study recessive policing alleles. He also does not calculate 
evolutionary stability conditions. 
Both papers (Woyciechowski and Lomnicki. 1987; Ratnieks, 
1988) offer calculations based on population genetics without 
mentioning or calculating inclusive fitness. These early studies 
(Starr. 1984; Seeley, 1985; Woyciechowski and Lomnicki. 1987; 
Ratnieks. 1988) were instrumental in establishing the field of 
worker policing. 
Testing theoretical predictions on the evolution of worker 
policing in the field or in the lab is difficult Due to the complex-
ities inherent in insect sociality, published empirical results are not 
always easy to interpret. While, so far, winter policing has been 
found in all species with multiple mating that have been studied, it 
has also been found in about 20% of species with singly mated 
queens (I lammond 
and 
Keller. 
2004; 
Wenseleers 
and 
Ratnieks. 2006b; Bonckaert et al.. 2008). Herein lies the difficulty: 
When worker policing is found in multiply mated species and 
found to be absent in singly mated species, this is taken as evi-
dence supporting the relatedness argument, and when worker 
policing is found in singly mated species, it is explained away as 
not being evidence against the theory, but as having evolved for 
other reasons (such as colony efficiency). See, for example, the 
following quotation by Bonckaert et al. (2008): 'Nevertheless. our 
results are important in that they show that V. germanica forms no 
exception to the rule that worker reproduction should be effec-
tively policed in a species where queens mate multiple times 
(Ratnieks, 1988). Indeed, any exception to this pattern would be a 
much bigger challenge to the theory than the occurrence of 
worker policing in species with single mating, which can be 
readily explained (Ratnieks, 1988; Foster and Ratnieks. 2001b)." 
This is precisely why a careful simultaneous consideration of 
relatedness, male parentage, and colony efficiency is important for 
understanding worker policing. 
We do not aim to provide an exhaustive catalog of all species in 
which worker policing has been studied. We merely cite some 
specific examples to add context Policing is rampant in colonies of 
the honeybee (Ratnieks and Visscher. 1989), the wasp Vesputa 
vutgaris (Foster and Ratnieks, 2001c), and the wasp Vespula ger-
manica (Bonckaert et al., 2008), which are all multiply mated. (As 
mentioned above, worker policing has been found in all of the 
studied species to date that are multiply mated.) Worker removal 
of worker-laid eggs is much less prevalent in colonies of the 
bumblebee (Velthuis et al., 2002), the stingless bee, (Peters et al.. 
1999), and the wasp, Vespula rata (Wenseleers et al.. 2005), which 
are predominantly singly mated. (As mentioned above, worker 
policing has been found only in about 20% of the studied species to 
date that are singly mated.) There are some studies based on 
observational evidence that find policing in singly mated species; 
examples of species with single mating and worker policing are 
Vespa crobro (Foster et al.. 2002), Camponotusjlortdanus (Endler et 
al., 2004), Aphaenogaster smythiesi (Wenseleers and
