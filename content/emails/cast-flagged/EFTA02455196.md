From the very =eginning, Due to Mr Epsteins wealth and prominence these reports, pleadings and 
stories have been tabloid fodder rife with exaggeratio=, omission, and outright falsehoods. Though over a decade has 
passed With the passage of time, as the story they told, which is and only ever really was a story about a wealthy Palm

alive in a financially motivated attempted time and againstrategy to br=athe new life into it.. They have fed and 
continue to feed a public accustomed to tabloid hyperbole with ever more salacious and conspiratorial allegations about 
all=ged sex trafficking, power brokering and political corruption. One of the most agrecious=C20 examples in book 
form seprate and apart fr=m allegations of underage sex with princes academics biz people world leaders 
</=pan> 
new book, TrafficKing, =irst published on July 6, 2016, irresponsibly assembles the worst of 
these allegations and fabricates even more inflammatory ones of her own in order to create a false and wildly 
=xaggerated tale, sold as non fiction about Mr. Epstein and the Plaintiffs,. S=e creates a delusion of and=ispan> their 
<=el datetime="2016-08-14106:59"> participa=ion in <=span>SEX trafficking and other detestable criminal behavior, 
that bears absolutely no resemblance whatsoever to the in order to sell books . nothing more =span> truth. 
4,=A0 
So much so that in January 2015, Jean Luc Brunel, a modeling agent,=long time friend of Mr 
Epstein, who is also unfairly and falsely reviled <=pan>portrayed , without any evidence whatsoever, as a sex trafficker 
in Sarnoff's abhorrent creation, sued Epstein for =ailing to publicly renounce these false allegations leveled against 
Epstein and him, including those perpetuated by Sarnoff.ln her book She makes wild accusations against an industry 
that legitimately hires young women to model. And through her distorted lens turn evey modeling agent into a criminal. 
<=h1> 
=C* 
With Epstein's silence<=el datetime="2016.08-14T07:04"> and, for obvious reasons, a 
dearth of individuals willing to risk their own reputations to defend persons and offensive events depicted with ever 
increasing severity<=del>, a vacuum has been created to allow Sarnoff, a shameless and delusional self-promoter, to 
peddle to a voracious but unsuspecting public an infantil= distortion in the name of human rights. Sarnoff's "TrafficKing" 
is a frighteningly irresponsible compilation =f untested fantastical allegations, unsupportable assumptions, shoddily 
pieced togethe= circumstantial evidence and paranoid speculation. It is =oorly researched, carelessly sourced and 
alarmingly inaccurate. Though presented in s tyle that includes fake footnotes in most chapters. Many <=span>of 
which upon researching do not exist. 
=C* 
Pages 94 through 108 of TrafficKing <=pan>clearly establish that Sarnoff, tells a=tale of her 
having r=cently been terrified during an investigation in Mexico into true sex t=afficking and government corruption, 
was already=primed to accept as given a link between sex trafficking and government corruption. =She says she =ead a 
few articles in which the lawyers representing a few women prosecuting in </=ns>civil cases against Epstein where were 
try=ng to create public pressure on Epstein. What is clear from her narrative is that from the beginning she assumed the 
truth of every negativ= statement asserted against Epstein All the research she conducted thereafter was clearly 
informed by this pre-conceivedand her and completely erroneous notion that Epstein's wealth and power were us=d to 
insulate him and his associates from the consequences of a serious criminal activity. 
=C* 
Sarnoff's bias has made her r=cklessly indifferent to the truth in the Epstein case and 
singularly unwilling to exercise even a modic=m of critical analysis or objectivity. She draws her "facts" and conclusions 
from very obviously biase= and unreliable sources without any scrutiny, due diligence or professional journalistic 
objectivity, choosing to accept without question any and all negative allegations against Mr. Epstein and his associates 
and to fully discard any=and all evidence that demonstrates an absence of credibility of her sources or =he implausibility 
of the information they provide. 
=C* 
Consequently, in TrafficKing, Ms. Sar=off has published a fabrication riddled with blatant 
defamation, particularly relating to the P=aintiffs, their relationships with Epstein and their involvement in the matters 
givin= rise to Mr. Epstein's legal problems. In fact, Sarnoff ignored clear warnings about the problems with her book,

conc=ding at page xii-xiv that "publishers were afraid to print my book for f=ar of" libel and legal action and that 6 
different publishers rejected her manuscr=pt. Acting wit= full knowledge of her publishers skepticism and warnings and 
with clear malice i= the face of so many voices saying your story is inaccurate, Sa=noff should have heeded those 
warnings as the numerous defamatory statements in TrafficKing have severely and irreparably damaged the reputations 
of Plaintiffs, two innocents unfairly caught in its destructive wake.

Fa=tual Background 
Investigation by Palm Beach Police Department 
4>=A0 
As has been reported over and over for the past 10 years. In March 2005, t=e Palm Beach 
Police Department opened a criminal investigation of Mr. Epstein when the father and stepmother of Saige Gonzales 
complained to police about=a visit by their 14-year old daughter to Mr. Epstein's Palm Beach hom=. What has not=been 
reported is that ;Mr. and Mrs. Gonzales informed police that they believed inappropriate conduct =ay have occurred 
between Mr. Epstein and their daughter. The police interviewe= Saige Gonzales, who had visited Mr. Epstein's home 
only once, but 
ought no charges after interviewing her, though monitored activity at Mr. Epstein4)=804,s home 
through sporadic surveillance and occasional trash pulls. 
=C2. There are several reasons that ex lain this result.=C24, Saige told the Palm Beach Police on 
more than one occasion that she was instructed by 
= the woman who brought her to Mr. Epstein's home, 
that Saige had to =ell Mr. Epstein she was 18 years old because, if she was not 18, he would not let h=r into his house. 
Saige also informed the Police that she did in fact tell Mr. Epstein that she was 18 years old. She also informed police 
that Mr. Epstein had no sexual contact with her. Mr. Epstein took a lie detector test, the results of which confirmed that 
Saige told hi= she was 18, that he believed Saige when she told him her age, that he never threatened Saige in any way 
and that no sexual contact occurred with Saige. In addition, Saige, who had previous run-ins with the Police, maintained 
a "MySpace page at the=time of the investigation on which she stated that she was 18 years old, posted naked a=d 
provocative photographs, admitted =o having sex . that she was not a virgin, to using drugs, and =o having beaten 
someone up, and to having shoplifted and claimed=to earn $250,000 or more.
