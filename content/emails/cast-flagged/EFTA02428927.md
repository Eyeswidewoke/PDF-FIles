Investment banker Jeffrey Epstein pleads guilty to

WEST PALM BEACH — He lives in a Palm Beach waterfront mansion and once kept

company with the likes of President Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew and Donald Trump, 
but investment banker Jeffrey Epstein will call the Palm Beach County jail home for 
the next 18 months. 
Epstein, 55, pleaded guilty this morning to felony solicitation of prostitution and 
procuring a person under the age of 18 for prostitution. After serving 18 months in jail, 
he will be under house arrest for a year. And he will now have a lifelong obligation to 
register as a sex offender. 
Epstein was arrested two years ago following a lengthy investigation by Palm Beach 
police into allegations that he paid several girls under the age of 18 $200 to $300 
each in return for naked massages at his home on El Brillo Way that sometimes 
became sexual. 
Palm Beach Police Chief Michael Reiter felt that State Attorney Barry Krischer was 
less than diligent in pursuing charges against Epstein and told him so. Epstein, in 
turn, hired a phalanx of high-priced lawyers and public relations specialists who 
questioned Reiter's competence and the victims' truthfulness. 
Epstein arrived in court with at least three attorneys on Monday wearing a blue 
blazer, blue jeans and white and gray sneakers. After Circuit Judge Deborah Dale 
Pucillo accepted the plea, Epstein was fingerprinted. He then removed his coat and 
was handcuffed while his attorneys tried to shield him from photographers' lenses. 
When he eventually is released from jail, Epstein will have to comply with numerous 
conditions of his house arrest. They include observing a 10 p m.to 6 a.m. curfew, 
having no unsupervised contact with anybody under the age of 18 and not owning or 
possession pornographic or sexual materials "that are relevant to your deviant 
behavior," the judge said. 
Epstein's conduct with underage girls doesn't end with today's plea. There are three 
pending federal civil lawsuits and one in state court related to his behavior. At least 
one woman has sued him in New York, where he owns a Manhattan mansion.
