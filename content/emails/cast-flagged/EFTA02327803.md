Ordering=a 3rd in case it is small isn't a bad idea either, but serve only 2 if 3 lo=ks like too much... x2 Scallop Entree &nb=p; (plate) (6 scallops should fit better on a plate than 8, and not lo=k too crowded.) xl Steak entree (not the s=ecial) (Temperature: Medium Rare Push) (plate) — You may have to sl=ce before serving. Set steak knives. xl Fettuccine wfWeal Ragu (small bowl) xl Orecciette w/ b=con, pecorino and spring vegetables (small bowl) x2 Sides of mixed sautéed veggies (small bowl) =span> You know where to get the dessert goodies :) Th=ugh if you wanna change it up (but not the flourless choice cake...) y=u can grab a few from either Masion Kayser and/or Laudree just down the str=et.
