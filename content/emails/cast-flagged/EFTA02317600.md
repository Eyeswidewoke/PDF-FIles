| **Subject** | Fwd: FYI.. =e wants to return the last rug we got from Sacco.. I'm assuming he will =ant a refund because he's saying "it's not like we ordered". It has =pparently faded quite a bit from the sun as it's cotton and the colors =ust haven't held. He said when we first received it it wasn't quite as =ibrant as it should be.. He wants a new one for that room =ow, but different color/type. Do we still have a credit from =acco? Begin forwarded message: |
