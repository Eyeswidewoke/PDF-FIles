Well if not this time, maybe next time on 10/15 in Boston or in Mamaroneck on 10/22, or Philadelphia with the Chamber Orchestra on 11/5 or 11/6! :) Do you think I should I keep two tickets under his name for this weekend in case, or should I release them? -Charlie On Sep 13, 2017, at 7:35 AM, wrote: HI Charlie...I am thinking it may not work out for Jeffrey to attend after all...but am crossing my fingers...he may decide last minute...I'll keep you posted.

Here is the concert site: https://www.gardnermuseu m.org/ealendar/event/charlie- albright-20170917 It's the first of three concerts I'm giving there this season. It starts at 1:30pm on 9/17/2017 and is an hour-long concert. Should be all through by 2:30pm. I'm playing the Chopin Andante Spianato/Grande Polonaise Brilliante, and the Chopin Etudes, Op. 25. I have 2 tickets I've been saving...if Mr. Epstein can come I'd be honored to have him as my guest! Please let me know if he might be in the area that day- -Charlie Hi Charlie...hope you are well. Can you please give me the details of your concert in Boston on Sunday Sept.17? timing? etc...
