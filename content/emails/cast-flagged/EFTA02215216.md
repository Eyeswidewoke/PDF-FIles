**CAST MATCHES:** Jeffrey Epstein, Robert F. Kennedy Jr, Robert Mueller

| **From** | Robert Kuhn |
| **To** | jeffrey E. <jeevacation@gmail.com> Confirmed: June 15 morning. When to Skype? (pre or post needed haircut?) For Breakthrough series, next step, I think, is devising a more refined list of probing topics - expanding / sharpening those I sent (derived from our various communications). Also politics of course (US/China/MiddleEast - lots of fun).

Or prior if you return. What works about a "Radical Breakthroughs" series is the unusual collection of ideas from apparently diverse fields, framed around the organizing principle of deep structural probes of the nature of reality/life/sentient life. Utterly unique. Fallback: Skype / FaceTime? On Jun 3, 2017, at 5:28 AM, jeffrey E. <jeevacation a gmail.com> wrote: i shuld be back aroudn thel5 where are you before and after?
