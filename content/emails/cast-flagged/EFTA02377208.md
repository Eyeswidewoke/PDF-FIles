AD/FIN BOD/Investors - I'm overdue for an update, so please read=the summary below. Happy to discuss. 
Over the past 4-6 weeks, we have seen a clear increase in activity, as=interest and understanding of AD/FIN 
continues to grow. As a result,=we have a strong pipeline of prospects and opportunities for 2017 (see bel=w). 
The sales cycle remains long, so our revenue forecasts are getting pus=ed by a few months. We are still hopeful 
of getting our first paying clien=(s) in 2016, but it is more likely to be Jan/Feb 2017. I am in the process=of re-forecasting 
for 2017, with our current funds projected to last until -Feb 7th. We should of cou=se have discussions asap around 
2017 funding. 
Here's the latest update.. 
ProcureCon Marketing: I am just leaving LA where I spoke on a pa=el at Procurecon marketing which 
was a very target rich event for us. = Lots of interest in AD/FIN and many followups. Top prospects includ=: 
• 
Warner Brothers - already had followup meet at W8 HQ. Stron interest for 2017. 
• 
Johnson & Johnson - Next ste= meetings being coordinated via Accenture 
•

• 
MetLife 
• 
Sony 
• 
Assembly & HX: We continue to get a lot of positive PR and l=ads based on our partnerships with 
Assembly and HX. Our strongest pr=spect for a first paying client via Assembly -- the Truth Initiative -- is very close to 
signing! 
• 
Accenture - we are getting closer to a Global Partnership Agreem=nt. The process is very drawn out and 
complicated based on the innov=tive nature of our offering. But even with the agreement not complet=d, Accenture 
continues to include AD/FIN in multiple pitches and RFP responses, most of which are still outstanding=..so we should 
hear soon on some of them. The top prospects include:=br> 
• 
Unilever 
• 
J&J 
• 
L'Oreal 
• 
a>Toyota 
• 
KraftHeinz 
• 
McDonalds 
In add=tion, Accenture is very interested in raising AD/FIN's profile and the pro=pect of our work 
together, and has set up an call with their leads in Lond=n and Asia to help educate us on those markets...and for us to 
educate them on AD/FIN. 
• 
Multiple Audit/Consulting partnerships in progress. In past=4 weeks alone, have had calls/meetings with 
most of the leading US based M=dia Auditing firms. They are all interested in partnering with Jeffries an= MMI already 
moving fast. 
• 
Jeffries - already presented to Samsung. Followup meeting=in Dec

• 
SQAD - met with CEO at ProcureCon.=..still very interested in working together. 
• 
WhiteOps - working aggressively on joint offering combing our Bi= Log data with their Fraud and 
Viewability signals. Strong interest =rom Accenture to take this to market ...plus in discussions with Bank of A=erica to 
trial. This could be a very powerful incentive for Advertisers to use AD/FIN. 
• 
ANA Study - targeting Jan 2017 to publish joint industry report.=nbsp; We are also trying to convert 
some of the Participants to paying cus=omers in 2017 including,.
