**[ORG]:** eart attack. Stu=f like that! Since you've been out of the loop some interesting stuff has happe=ed to me. I've been writing for the FT style section (under a fake name) a=d friendly with some of the fancy designer types. Good practice for me! </=iv> Still working on Special Initiatives at the Gates Foundation and also =eviewing the very crazy stuff that comes our way. I think you have a much =etter sense of the real vs. fake than Bill does. I manage several different portfolios of Special Projects whose grants=commitments total about $315M. It's crazy to think about the amount of=money. Wow. 

**[WORD]:** tal about $315M. It's crazy to think about the amount of=money. Wow. or a week. I'm excited about that! Also still doing brain surgery and contemplating going back for more t=aining (only because the non- invasive/high tech stuff is making me feel li=e a dinosaur!). I just don't want to leave my Gates job and a little w=rried if I take any more time to be a doc, they will fire me.

i've measured my temperature during yoga and tracked heart rate wi=h an ekg. very interesting. too much to

I know that you are a keen observer and probably took away some intere=ting lessons. 
I'm sorry that you had to go through all this crap - 
Are you still doing science? Some super cool stuff out there. 
I've also got some very crazy ideas of my own that we should talk =bout. Crazy even for me, but 
probably right. I think herpes causes a few t=pes of heart disease and treating it prevents stroke and heart attack. Stu=f 
like that!

s doing fine - we just celebrated being together 10 years. Who =ould've thought? He's way up 
there at 
hese days and pretty m=ch hates his job. 
I discovered hot yoga after all these years. Love it! 
Well, I think that's about it for the past few months that you hav= been away. 
I really have missed you a lot. 
Hope that you are starting to feel back to normal and if there is anyt=ing I can do for you please let me
