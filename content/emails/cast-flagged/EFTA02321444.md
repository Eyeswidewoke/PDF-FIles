Cushions for the island and some tall black things that I think may be speakers for Palm Beach. He told me to liaise with Larry about taking to Teterboro so I will get in touch with him.

All of the boxes should go for LSJ except the 2 boxes from Jado(l have to return them)and I'm not sure about the DVD player..) have to ask Larry where it's for.

If wheels up is at 8, I wonder what time we should leave the house. Jojo suggested 7am or 7.15am. And I am not sure how long in advance he should collect Jen. Maybe half an hour, I am worried she wont be ready. There was also a box that came from Facconable with 2 pairs of corduroys. We are going to put them in the closet here. Lynn has checked the boxes and we have the following: 2 Boxes from Jado 1 box of socks 1 box Sonicare Toothbrush 1 box from Soda Stream Electric Fan 1 Box from middle atlantic products Blue Ray Disc Player Bose speakers/Docking station EFTA_R1_01231907 EFTA02321444 On Sat, Feb 12, 2011 at 5:02 PM, «mailto <mailto <mailto > wrote: OK thanks. If ■s going, then I need to know of she's staying at 301 tonight or 71st so I can tell Jojo if he needs to pick her up in the morning at 301 or not. I have Lyn telling me what's in the boxes at 71st so I can give you the list of things to go to LSJ if thats the plan.

I don't know who is going with you tomorrow, where you are going after Boston, etc. Also, Scott is on LSJ now and was supposed to fly to Miami tomorrow to fix Internet in PB, but it's working now, and he hasn't responded if I should cancel him going to Miami. All things I need to know! On Feb 12, 2011, at 3:00 PM, < <mailto > <mailto > <mailto > <mailto > <mailto > wrote: Ok M, has he responded yet? I heard him telling Gulsum that we were coming back to NY in the evening but dont want to rely on it. I will try check with him soon. We have the robes. Lynn has showed me all the boxes in the oval office, she thinks they all need to go except for the ones that have signs on to be returned. We can go through it together when we know the plans. I will go out this afternoon to get food for the plane tomorrow and we will probably pick up things for tea and lunch in Boston as we did last time.
