| **Subject** | Re: St.Thomas Hello Miss. Maxwell I am Betsy Attaway and am responding to you in Jims behalf as he is at work and hard to contact. I did speak with him and he cannot make it to St. Thomas because of the preparations he must take care of for this prior commitment for the upcoming week. He does want very much want to meet with Mr.Epstein at the first available opportunity which would probably be any time in the weeks of September 9-20th. Thank you and we are sorry for any delay.
