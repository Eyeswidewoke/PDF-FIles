### Match 2
> L] - photobook for Maxwell witnesses Date: Wed, 16 Jun 2021 00:48:38 +0000 Importance: Normal H Following up on my conversation with M I just now, would you please put together a photobook for us to show to trial witnesses with photos and fillers for the following individuals? . Epstein . Maxwell • • As I mentioned to M , I think it would be ideal to get formal photos like from a license or passport from the late 1990s or early 2000s for each of these individuals. That way we can use the NYPD database to find fillers who appear similar. Thanks, EFTA00038687
