Find out if we can keep dental anesthetics on board, which would include: metal syringe, carpules of anesthetics( articaine with epinephrine, lidocaine with epinephrine, mepivocaine) and needles. 2. Please have someone make drawer inserts for the white porcelain set of cups and saucers. 3. Give Mr. Epstein's clothes, that we left out, to the laundry service and have them iron the shirts as well please. EFTA_R1_01258364 EFTA02329479 P.S. We will be leaving the laundry items in a drawer that is marked "laundry" (in the kitchen) if that is convenient? Thanks a lot! Karyna. 2 EFTA_R1_01258365 EFTA02329480 |
