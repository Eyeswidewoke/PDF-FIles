VIDEOGRAPHER: Going on the record. This 
2 
is day two of Alan Dershowitz's deposition. 
3 
The date is October 16, 2015, and the time is 
4 
approximately 9:18 a.m. 
5 
MR. SCAROLA: Would you please reswear the 
6 
witness. 
7 
THE COURT REPORTER: Would you raise your 
8 
right hand, please? 
9 
Do you swear or affirm that the testimony 
10 
you are about to give will be the truth, the 
11 
whole truth, and nothing but the truth? 
12 
THE WITNESS: Yes. 
13 
Thereupon: 
14 
ALAN M. DERSHOWITZ 
15 
having been first duly sworn, was examined and 
16 
testified as follows: 
17 
DIRECT EXAMINATION 
18 
BY MR. SCAROLA: 
19 
Q. 
Mr. Dershowitz, what is rhetorical 
20 
hyperbole? 
21 
A. 
Rhetorical means verbal and hyperbole 
22 
means exaggeration. 
23 
Q. 
Something other than the truth, correct? 
24 
A. 
Truth --
25 
MR. SCOTT: Objection, form, relevancy. 
www.phi sre orting.com 
EFTA02726488

185 
1 
A. 
Truth has many, many meanings and is a 
2 
continuum. The Supreme Court has held that 
3 
rhetorical hyperbole cannot be the basis, for 
4 
example, of perjury prosecutions or generally of a 
5 
defamation prosecution. 
6 
So it depends on the context. You might 
7 
just look at the dictionary and probably get a 
8 
variety of definitions for it. 
9 
BY MR. SCAROLA: 
10 
Q. 
Well, what I'm concerned about, 
11 
Mr. Dershowitz, is not a dictionary definition. I 
12 
want to know what your understanding of rhetorical 
13 
hyperbole is. 
14 
And do you agree that pursuant to your 
15 
understanding of rhetorical hyperbole, it is an 
16 
exaggeration beyond the facts? 
17 
MR. SCOTT: Objection, argumentative and 
18 
compound, three questions. 
19 
A. 
No --
20 
MR. SCOTT: You can answer. 
21 
A. 
-- I would not agree with that definition. 
22 
BY MR. SCAROLA: 
23 
Q. 
Okay. Then define it for us, if you 
24 
would, please. 
25 
A. 
I think I have already. 
www.phi sre orting.com 
EFTA02726489

186 
1 
Q. 
I'm sorry, I missed the definition. Could 
2 
you tell us what rhetorical hyperbole is? 
3 
MR. SCOTT: Objection, repetitious. He's 
4 
done it. 
5 
A. 
Why don't we just read back my answer. 
6 
BY MR. SCAROLA: 
7 
Q. 
Because I didn't understand it, so I would 
8 
like you to try to give us a direct response to that 
9 
question if you're able to. 
10 
A. 
I will repeat exactly what I said. A 
11 
rhetorical means verbal and hyperbole means some 
12 
exaggeration of the facts for political or other 
13 
reasons, but generally it is truthful in a literal 
14 
sense but perhaps -- it all depends on context. 
15 
And if you tell me the context in which I 
16 
used it, I will be happy to describe what I meant in 
17 
that context. But I don't think you can really 
18 
answer a question about what two words put together 
19 
mean without understanding the context. 
20 
Q. 
Okay. Well, we're going to talk about 
21 
some context. 
22 
Do you recall having been interviewed on 
23 
on 
24 
A. 
I have no current recollection of --
25 
MR. SCOTT: Do you have a copy of the 
www.phi sre orting.com 
EFTA02726490

187 
1 
transcript of the interview? We'd like to see 
2 
it. 
3 
MR. SCAROLA: That's exactly what I gave 
4 
you, the photocopy. 
5 
MR. SCOTT: We're doing it right now. 
6 
Maybe we can move on and come back then. 
7 
MR. SCAROLA: No, I would like to proceed. 
8 
MR. SCOTT: Then let's stop until I get a 
9 
copy of it. Because he -- I want --
10 
MR. SCAROLA: I don't think that's 
11 
necessary because your client has told us that 
12 
he has a superb memory and one of the things I 
13 
would like to know is what he's able to recall. 
14 
If he needs to refresh his memory, the 
15 
transcripts will be here in just a moment, but 
16 
I don't want to delay going forward. 
17 
MR. SCOTT: Do you need the transcript to 
18 
refresh your memory? 
19 
THE WITNESS: Well, I have no memory of 
20 
what specifically I said on a particular day in 
21 
a particular interview. 
22 
MR. SCOTT: Since you have a copy in front 
23 
of him, why don't you just show him your copy 
24 
then? Read the -- ask your question and let 
25 
him read it.

188 
1 
BY MR. SCAROLA: 
2 
Q. 
Do you recall having been interviewed on 
3 
by 
4 
A. 
Yes, I do. 
5 
Q. 
Do you recall having been interviewed on 
6 
by 
in early 
7 
where you spoke about matters that have become the 
8 
subject of this litigation? 
9 
A. 
Yes, I do. 
10 
Q. 
Did you make the following statement 
11 
during the course of that interview: "As to the 
12 
airplanes, there are manifests that will prove 
13 
beyond any doubt that I was never on a private 
14 
airplane with this woman or any other underage 
15 
girl"? 
16 
MR. SCOTT: You need to see the 
17 
transcript? 
18 
THE WITNESS: No. No. 
19 
A. 
That is a truthful statement. I would 
20 
repeat it right now. I've reviewed the manifests. 
21 
First, I know I was never on the airplane 
22 
with any underage woman. I know that for a fact. I 
23 
have absolutely no doubt in my mind about that. And 
24 
the records that I have reviewed confirm that. 
25 
They have 
on a number of 
www.phi sre orting.com 
EFTA02726492

189 
1 
airplane flights with Jeffrey Epstein. They have me 
2 
on a number of flights, none -- let me emphasize, 
3 
none within the relevant time period, none within 
4 
the relevant time period. That is, there are no 
5 
manifests that have me on Jeffrey Epstein's airplane 
6 
during the time that 
claims to 
7 
have -- falsely claims to have had sex with me. 
8 
So, yes, not only recall making that 
9 
statement, but I repeat it here today. And it is 
10 
absolutely true. And it just confirms what I know, 
11 
and that is that 
made up the entire 
12 
story. 
13 
BY MR. SCAROLA: 
14 
Q. 
Your statement --
15 
MR. SCOTT: What page are you reading 
16 
from? 
17 
MR. SCAROLA: Page 5. 
18 
Q. 
Your statement was that you were never on 
19 
a private airplane with this woman, which I assume 
20 
was a reference to 
, correct? 
21 
A. 
It is, yes. 
22 
Q. 
Or any other underage girl? 
23 
A. 
That's right. 
24 
Q. 
All right. How many times --
25 
A. 
Well, let me be very clear. I have no 
www.phi sre orting.com 
EFTA02726493

190 
1 
idea who was in the front cabin of the airplane with 
2 
the pilots. Obviously what I intended to say and 
3 
what I say here now is I never saw an underaged 
4 
person on an airplane. 
5 
Now, when I -- when I flew with Jeffrey 
6 
Epstein to the launch, my recollection is that there 
7 
may have been a couple on the plane with their child 
8 
who was going to see the launch. But that was 
9 
certainly not the context in which I made the 
10 
statement. 
11 
I never saw any underage, young person who 
12 
would be the subject or object of any improper 
13 
sexual activities. Had I seen Jeffrey Epstein ever 
14 
in the presence of an underage woman in a context 
15 
that suggested sexuality, I would have, A, left the 
16 
scene; B, reported it; and, C, never had any further 
17 
contact with Jeffrey Epstein. 
18 
Q. 
You have also made the statement that you 
19 
were never on a private airplane with any underage 
20 
women or any young women, correct? 
21 
A. 
The context was underage women in a sexual 
22 
context. If it was a -- you know, a four-year-old 
23 
child being carried by her mother, that would not be 
24
