Re: 
We do - that has always bee= our shared belief. 
Seems like funding 5 scientist= who are pushing w data and 5 who are pushing to GET data would be 10 amazi=g 
opportunities to advance science. 
Three ye=rs total (worry about nothing and focus - so 5350k each) funding plus intro= to VC or whoever for the former 
and three years funding and equipment for t=e latter ($200k each). And a handful Of 100k awards for amazing g=t 
started folks along the way. 
About $6m yea= 
Issues 
- follow on=funding beyond that 
- convening (need a new TED for only sc=ence) 
- fundraising 
- management / operations&nbs=; 
- governance 
Keep it super small=and somewhat secret let the science speak for itself. ANONYMOUS Fo=ndation. Very vocal work. 
Best done through a DAF I think. 
</=iv> 
Seems like that's what googlex or breakthrough prize and ev=n Gates fndn were set up To do and believe they do. 
Stevie is fine, same. Hilarious. Getting bored but not finding optio=s that suit him. He's viewed as an icon rather than 
Kary of a workf=rce I think. And he wants to jump back in to the right opportunity. 
Bill seems ok. Makes me sad for all the reasons we both kn=w. I see him sometimes we talk about science and life. He's 
trapped=but he has no desire to change anything. Never understood that. He'= very flaky. He tells me he's super proud 
of me and what I'=e done and always very curious about endovascular sometimes I bring equipme=t and we talk 
through procedures he has super good questions. His oldest da=ghter going to med school soon maybe. 
Boris a=so ok. He bought a HUGE mansion here in Seattle. Larry Cohen of course got a=1 the info and told bill it was 
biggest house in Seattle. It isn't b=ggest it might be oldest and most beautiful. Location and structure from a 1=ng time 
ago by some railroad magnate. Didn't even know it existed. l='s called SAM HILL. His fund seems to have done well I 
think based o= earlier EDITAS exit and he's on his way to closing second fund. Hi= personal situation (health and 
happiness) maybe not quite perfect yet but h='s amazing and resilient and will get there. He works very very har= and is 
incredibly smart. He will do just fine - just hoping it's n=t at a high personal cost. He says hi by the way and of course 
adores you.&=bsp;

Not much else. I'm done w my fellowsh=p February 2019 and they want me to stay on and are offering for me to do o=ly 
endovascular with no other responsibilities (it's super busy) wh=ch is fine. I just really feel like there's more to do and 
want to.=Being a technician is fine and fun and challenging and the days go by quick=y. 
But i don't really have any dream= anymore. Not sure what or where. Everything has been a dead end so far. Se=ms like 
anywhere there is a woman in charge they love my resume and then se= a picture and say I'm too beautiful or meet me 
and tell others I =80 m too intimidating and hard to work with. Other orgs run by men have v=cious staff or jealous 
insecure wives that think I'm after their hu=bands. Strange being female in a way I cant really explain. 
Opportunities outside neurosurgery that come my way not insp=ring at all ... Corporate middle management for stuff I 
don't care about - m=re politics like IFC or WHO - GoogleX might be an option but it feels a lot=like Gates fndn. And 
projects all getting shut down. Google leadership very=fickle too. Supposedly Reid Hoffman started a brain thing w Ed 
Boyden but E= didn't mention to me and I havent seen anything formalized. Ed is s=per smart but overcommitted for 
sure. Ideally I could do something useful b=t outside the public eye that is committed and not flaky and subject to 
ins=ant cancellation by a jealous or crazy dependent somewhere in the food chai=. 
Neurosurgery not so bad.
