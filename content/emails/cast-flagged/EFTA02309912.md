| **Subject** | Re: Checking in Attachments: Check List and Service Manual.doc; Uniforms.docx Sarah, A few things for today =div> 1) Attached is the first draft of the Training Manual, = think its a good place to start. This will get fine tuned as time goes=on. One thing missing is how the phones here should be answered... If ther= is a standard verbiage you can give me, I will fill it in. 2) I spoke to my plate rep today, Karen Harris. We will=need to purchase plates soon, as you know... I can get catalogues for you =o look at as well as set up an appointment to go look at the showroom if y=u'd like. Going through Karen will give us a larger selection, better =rice and a much higher quality(stronger and lighter) than Crate And Barrel=or other places like that. 3) I will need to order uniforms. I'd just like to =et your approval on them before making the purchase because this is someth=ng i will be wearing everyday in the house and serving the guests in. Atta=hed are pictures of the coats, pants, and aprons. I've always worn the=blue(french laundry style) aprons because white is so difficult to keep wh=te, but they do come in white if you prefer. the jackets are mostly short =leeve because we are approaching summer. 4) Rich is working on accounts for Costco and butcher t=day 5) We placed orders for some gear for the kit=hens today. Pasta machine to make fresh pastas, dehydrator for dried fruit= and house made jerkys, etc... 6) I Planned on taking off this weekend and back to wor= on Monday. I feel like I still have a good amount of things to get done h=re in NY for JEs arrival on Saturday so I would like to spend next week tr=ining and cooking. A few things I am working; Flax Seed Granola- a few different versions that I can =weak and alter to JEs taste. Granola is something you can easily buy but c=n be wonderful if made in house... JE is interest=d in beef and turkey jerkeys- I know one company out of Brooklyn that does=a great grass-fed product, its like high end jerky, great stuff. I plan on=having that here when he arrives as well as some i will be making. Again w= can purchase it, but to make our own is much nicer because we can make it=taste however he would like. Smokey or sweet or even have some asian notes=to it... Sorbets and ice creams Chicken and veggie sto=ks and sauces- the store bought broths are packed with MSG and made from w=o knows what... I have a bunch of new books on California cuisin= and small bites I'm going through and working on new snacks EFTA_R1_01193110 EFTA02309912 I will touch base with the butcher on Monday and ge= some veal to test, hopefully i can get something worth cooking finally.4=iv> 7) Last but not least=AUSTRALIAN WINTER TRUFFLES are coming to the country on the 27th!! We will=need to order some as soon as thy arrive. <=iV> Thank you Francis On Thu, May 17, 2012 at 1:48 PM, Sarah K w=ote: All sounds great! Thanks for keeping me=posted!

I purchased a printer today to print out menus for dinn=rs as well as menus for JE to review and check off things that interest hi= so we can continue to dial in his palate and more of what he enjoys... =idly> Today I am getting account with the local butcher =hat Steve recommends, hopefully we can finally get some veal that JE likes= I'm working on getting a Costco card toda= so we can start purchasing things in bulk. We can have up to 6 cards per =ccount so other people can use as well, like Lyn who does the buying and s=ocking for 71st. I also believe there is a Costco in west palm beach as we=l. Things like dry food items( flour, sugar, salt, soda, water) as well as=cleaning products and paper goods we can buy in bulk here in NY and maybe =ven ship to island and save a bunch of money. Right now all the cleaning p=oducts for 71st are coming from the supermarket... 2 EFTA_R1_01193111 EFTA02309913 We have a quote on the ice machine and I will call arou=d to a few people today and see if they can beat the price. =/div> I still have a good amount of things to do here in NY i will kee= you posted on.
