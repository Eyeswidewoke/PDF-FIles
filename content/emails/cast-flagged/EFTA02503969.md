JE, 
Every couple of decades I come up with a big idea. This time, it's =nspired by you. Three things...

An idea - PRIVATE 
--Last Sunday, La Repubblica, the biggest newspaper in Italy ran a cover =tory about EDGE in their Sunday Magazine. It 
begins..."If the creation =f contemporary culture had a global hero, his name would coincide with =hat of John 
Brockman". http://bit.ly/2HGnlvx. 
This follows similar pattern from Germany to China, where I'm #13 on the =ist of people who have the most influence on 
their culture. And last =eek I made the biggest deal in publishing history for a serious =onfiction book on behalf of 
Kahneman ("The book of the century" =ccording to the Chinese publisher). 
--Your friend in the Middle East is coming to the US tomorrow and is =eportedly going to buy 10% of Endeavor for 
$400m. 
--He may be able do a lot more for his people (while spending less) by =cquiring Brockman, Inc. and gain immediate 
access to the world's great =cientific minds, while doing so in a deep way where, in effect, the =overeign Fund would be 
their agent. (See list below) 
--An interesting ancillary benefit: The net worth of the 40 guests at my =014 "billionaires dinner" was equal to combined 
wealth of 60% of all =mericans. http://bit.ly/2FVcZwN. 
Want to discuss? I'll be in the office tomorrow from 10pm on. 
Best, 
JB
