I'm on a flight at 6:30 AM tomorrow to MIA and then to NYC. If all goes as planned, I'll be in the city by about 4PM tomorrow afternoon. Thank you for making the apartment ready early and I'm so sorry about the ever shifting plans. Please let me know if it's 7B and please remind me of the code (1020, I think).
