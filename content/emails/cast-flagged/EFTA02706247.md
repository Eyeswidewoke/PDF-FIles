Hi Richard, 
You are right, but in the meantime Selana owes us some =oney and got a negative balance on her statement for the 
following : =isa processing fee, Test with photographer, Website fee, courrier, =omcards, appt rent. 
I will have the 20% fee reverse to her account and will =ave that amount applied the negative balance owes to =C2 and 
if any balance due to Selana, I will have a check cut to =er.
