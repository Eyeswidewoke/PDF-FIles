Dear All — 
I am writing to let you know that I have decided to step down as CEO of the=foundation. I will continue to lead the 
organization while Bill and Melind= select a successor, and I look forward to helping the new CEO settle in w=en he or 
she is hired. Bill, Melinda, and I have talked at length about their vision for the future of the organ=zation, and we are 
very confident in the leaders we have and excited about=the direction we're headed. 
When Bill and Melinda approached me about this job in May 2008, we discusse= a five-year commitment. I am proud of 
the work we've all done together =n the past five years. We are having an impact on people's lives every s=ngle day, and 
we are set up to keep on having an even bigger impact in the years to come. 
Now, I'm looking forward to doing some things I haven't had time for, i=cluding my work at the Raikes Foundation, 
which is tackling youth and educ=tion issues. I have learned so much from Bill, Melinda, our grantees and p=rtners, and 
all of you about catalytic philanthropy and specific issues like agriculture and education. I have al=o learned from—and 
been deeply moved by—the people I've met in the f=eld, whether they're Ethiopian farmers trying to grow enough food 
to fee= their children or a teacher in New Orleans helping students make a better future. These lessons will not only 
inspire=me but also serve me day-to-day, because I will continue to invest my time=and energy in these areas. 
It has been a privilege to get to do this urgent, important work with you, =nd it has also been a lot of fun. I'm focused on 
making sure that the tr=nsition to your next leader is as seamless as possible, so that you can co=tinue doing this work 
with the intellect and passion you bring to it every day.

At the Town Square Dialogue later this morning, you'll hear more from Bil=, Melinda, and me, and you'll get a chance to 
ask us any questions you m=ght have. 
Thank you,
