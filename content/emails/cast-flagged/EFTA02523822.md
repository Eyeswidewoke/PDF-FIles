Jeffrey, 
Here are photo's of the 1992 Gulfstream IV that Darren'= guy Luis Beck has under contract for 4.5M, I believe Jack Pruitt 
is brokeri=g the plane,. 
Luis Beck is getting cold feet and is concerned about the cost of get this plane up to speed,. its a former Presidential 
plane of Botswana,. 
-Needs engine overhaul, estimate Darren has received a 1.5M price not =o exceed for both engines,. 
-Needs paint 
-Needs new floor plan, and interior wood etc,. estimate 500k to 1M,. <=div> total time is good at 6400 hours and 5600 
landings,. 
Luis could be into plane for 7M once all is completed,. 
Plane is located at Private Sky in Fort Myers FL, West coast FL,.is wh=t I'm told,. 
In case you wanted to share this with Steve Hansen,. 
Morrison's GIV is on the market for 8.5M asking,. I believe Morrioson's plane is a 1988 HUD / EVS / Direct TV could be a 
deal if purchased for High 7's Million's However, Morrison's plane does not have a FDR, (Flight Data Recorder),. He is 
researching whether or not this is required for this plan=, FDR is required for FAR135 charter operations ,.depending on 
year built,.</=iv> 
thank you, 
Larry
