Re: Confidential: Early detection of Ebola 
ill try, also i started the conversatoin with =ark about splitting up the interest, he is open to the idea,=C240 but wanted 
someone smart to advise. that meanss he does't =ant to pay for advice.

=i Jeffrey, 
Any interest in helping on this. I kno= last time you and Francis did not hit it off. Nevertheless he has been 
su=cessful as a scientist and is really not a "people' person. Q=A0 
He claims he can develop the tools to diagnose=Ebola before it becomes symtomatic.

Dear Anthony, 
I really appreciate your willingness to find a potential pathway to Bi=l Gates and the Gates 
Foundation. 
By way of introduction, I have been a Professor at Weill-Cornell for t=e last 30 years, and am 
best known for having invented the Ligas= Chain Reaction (LCR) and the Universal Array. I hold 46 issued=US patents, a 
number of which have led to commercial tests to diagnose genetic diseases (i.e. cystic fibrosis, MLPA tests, =ANSR for 
NIPD of trisomy), and identify diseases using DNA microarray= and targeted Next-Gen sequencing. Earlier this year, I 
re=eived the IFCC Award for Significant Contributions in Molecular Diagn=stics. 
I have been collaborating with Dr. Linnie Golightly of our Center for =lobal Health/Infectious 
Disease Division for the past decade, wo=king together closely to develop multiplexed PCR-LDR assays for Categ=ry A

Biothreat agents, including all the major viral hemorrhagic fever viruses (VHF; ebolavirus, marburgvirus Crimean Cong= 
hemorrhagic fever virus, Lassa fever virus, Rift Valley fever v=rus, Dengue virus, and Yellow fever virus). (Kindly see 
b=low abstract of manuscript just being submitted). In addition, =n collaboration with Professor Soper at UNC, we have 
been building4)=A0micro-fabricated devices to rapidly detect pathogens. 
Most recently, we have begun designing micro-fabricated devices that w=ll allow for electronic 
detection, obviating the need for expens=ve hardware used in most fluorescent detection schemes (i.e. Taqman a=says). 
As such, we are poised to combine these technologie= for rapidly identifying and providing quantitative viral load fo= all 
the VHF, Variola, Malaria or other Category A pathogens directly=from a drop of blood, with the next level of such 
devices suitab=e for working in developing countries, and may be powered and run by a cell phone or smart device. 
• 
Current CDC approved EZ1-RT-=CR Taqman assay has LOD of 5,000 PFU/ml. This works 
when patient is=C24>febrile, i.e. has overt symptoms and may be contagious. 
• 
Next level of assay needs to=be > 100-fold more sensitive. We know how to address this 
issue. • 
This would allow for identif=cation of individuals with early viral replication in their blood 4>=804,before 
they are contagious, so they may be isolated, and further= early detection may improve outcomes. 
Would your contacts be able to help us, so in turn we may help protect=our country? 
Most appreciated,

ABSTRACT 
CDC designated category A infectious agents pose a major risk to natio=al security and require 
special action for public health pr=paredness. They include viruses that cause viral hemorrhagic fe=er (VHF) syndrome 
as well as variola virus, the agent of smallpo=. VHF is characterized by hemorrhage and fever with multi-
organ=C2*failure leading to high mortality and morbidity. Smallpox,=a prior scourge, has been eradicated for decades 
making it a par=icularly serious threat if released nefariously in the essentially no=-immune world population. Early 
detection of the causative agents =nd ability to distinguish them from other pathogens is essential to=C2Qcontain 
outbreaks, implement proper control measures and prevent=morbidity and mortality. We have developed a multiplex 
det=ction assay that uses several species-specific PCR primers to generate ampl=cons from multiple pathogens; these 
are then targeted in a ligas= detection reaction (LDR). The resultant fluorescently-lab=led ligation products are detected 
on a universal array enabling simultaneous identification of the pathogens. The assay wa= evaluated on 32 different 
isolates associated with VHF (ebolavirus,=C24>marburgvirus Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, Lassa fever =irus, 
Rift Valley fever virus, Dengue virus, and Yellow fever virus) as well as variola virus and vaccinia virus (the agent of 
smal=pox and its vaccine strain, respectively). The assay was a=Ie to detect all viruses tested including 8 sequences 
representative=C24>of different variola virus strains from the CDC repository. It does not cross react with other 
emerging zoonoses such =s monkeypox virus or cowpox virus, or six flaviviruses tested (St. Lo=is encephalitis virus, 
Murray Valley Encephalitis virus, Powassa= virus, Tick-borne encephalitis virus, West Nile virus and Japanese 
encephalitis virus).
