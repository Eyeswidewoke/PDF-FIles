| **Subject** | Zorro Home Jeffrey, Thank you f=r your kind thoughts in regards to Zorro home, as you kno= I and my family cherish this property and the Shangri-La =ou have made it. My thoughts regarding the future of =his property if you sell would be Water rights. Water =has always been an issue for my home, currently water is =upplied from Ranch Central to the property. If you sold Zor=o, I would think offering Zorro Ranch including a Tennis co=rt and guest home would be a plus as you know, If =nother owner took possession I could possibly loose water=20to the house. In 2001 I drilled a 1700 foot w=lI, only to find 200 gallon per day water source on th= 40 acres. I am fine with any decision you ma=e in regards to its future and what ever asset you may =hink it holds for me. thank =ou again for even considering the Zorro home. &nb=p; Respectfully, Larry 1 EFTA_R1_01298530 EFTA02337274 |
