| **Subject** | HI Steve, I asked Jeffrey about doing another tasting with the chef Francis, and JE told me he had found another job already? Also, so you know, Marc is landing at JFK tomorrow at 11:40am, I have a car bringing him to JE's house, and his return flight is at 5pm tomorrow back to PB.. EFTA_R1_01258197 EFTA02329434 |
