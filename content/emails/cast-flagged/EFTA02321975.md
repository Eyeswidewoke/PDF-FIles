How long are you staying in NY that week? I will keep in touch and let you know when I'm back from Paris. Hope you have a great flight and hope to see you soon for a fabulous dinner! : On Mar 30, 2011, at 3:04 AM, Hind Alowais <mailto: > wrote: Hey I would love to see you too!! and have some great food and wine!!
