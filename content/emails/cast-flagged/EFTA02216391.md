Hoping a direct flight would get him in somewhat early on the 21st...he can depart on 23rd on a direct flight anytime this date... Please check pricing on a room at the Marion as well ...we might not need a room (as Kevin may just stay in one of Jeffrey's bungalows)...but I'd like to know so I can tell JE the price...thanks To learn more about e-mail security or report a suspicious email. please visit us at americanexpress comiphishing.
