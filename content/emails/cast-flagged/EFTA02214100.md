Please find attached a visual of the basket on LSG. - Bismarckia nobilis (blue latan palm) will handle much more wind) you should get rid of the coconut. - New stone wall will be nicer as all surrounded walls are well shaped. having those boulders makes it too rough today. -Alamanda flower, should get ok. Just change the one that has trouble to grow. Regarding GSJ , I'm putting everything together this week (new idea, new locations, details etc... ) and I shall send you a file at the end of the week. I'll be available in three weeks to make the first road and some path.
