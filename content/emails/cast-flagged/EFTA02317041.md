| **To** | <mailto Hi Ion, that would be great. I le=ve town on Sunday morning and won't be back until the 28th, but you could w=rk on some samples for me next week. I have a piece of leather which I want=to match the color for the bedroom; a very dark taupe color. I can leave it=with my doorman for you to collect so you can work on a sample. My new apt i= 111. You are welcome to work there is you wish.. it's empty and still a wo=k site... up to you. For the living room I want something v=ry neutral with perhaps a slight design in it kind of like Jeffrey's gym in=NY on the 4th floor.. not sure if you've seen that room or not. The walls a=e an off white color but have a bit of a geometric design with different sh=des of the same color. I can send pics as well I will also I=ave you with the sample of the wood floors which will be going into the liv=ng room so you can work with that coloring. Thanks and welcome back! <=iv> On Oct 18, 2012, at 1:50 AM, ion nicola < > wrote: hi M, ..i will get=in new york tomorrow(friday) so in case you didn't do your apt yet i could s=art it eventually monday. sorry for the long delay.. tha=k you, = ion 2 EFTA_R1_01218451 EFTA02317042 |
