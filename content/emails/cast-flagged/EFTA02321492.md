We aim to make the best keyed stretcher frames available for a reasonable price and keep the =uality consistent year after year. We can certainly help =ou with your large stretcher frame requirements. We have developed a number of special designs for large format stretchers. =o prevent the stretchers from twisting under tension and creating that "rhombus effect", it's important that the bars be strong and the corner joints and braces be designed to withstand the stresses of a tightly stretched canvas. For strength and =traightness we use laminated and finger-jointed pine lumber to build our stretcher =ars. The HD bars we make all have double tongue and groove, friction fitted joints at the corners (see photos on our website). This ensures that the corner joints are strong yet still expandable through the use of our hardwood key system. Flush bolted sectional designs for ease of shipping and =ssembly The only practical way to ship a large stretcher with any =dimension over 8 feet is to make the long bars and braces in shorter sections that are bolted together. We use flush mounted hex-head connector bolts for fastening all splice joints (where short bar or brace lengths overlap) and dado joints (where braces =ntersect). Fully Keyed Bars and Braces =/b>Since large canvases are more prone to sagging over time, it is especially important to have the canvas supported by a stretcher frame which can be "keyed-out" to maintain the required tension. All of our large stretcher frames are made with keyable corner and brace =oints. <x-msg://445/> The custom stretcher you want is priced as =ollows: 2 EFTA_R1_01232182 EFTA02321493 Note that I have quoted you two options.

"I am pleased to provide you a status report on the 13 foot X 8 foot stretcher frame we recently received from Upper Canada Stretchers. We wish to compliment you on the workmanship and precision of the frame. The frame was easy to assemble and the fit was excellent. The completed frame is now mounted on the wall of the Mary Chapel of St. Anthony's church in The Woodlands, the scaffolding is in place, and Dean (artist) has begun to draw and paint. (If you wish some bragging rights I am told this is the largest catholic church in the Houston area Diocese)." Warren Schneider The Woodlands, TX, USA "Your stretchers slid right together and effortlessly squared to perfection. They go together so easily a child could do it! I used the Professional weight to stretch heavy linen and the bars remained flat and straight even though I like the canvas extremely tight. The finished product is very uniform and sturdy. Thank you for the workmanship and pride you put into your product. It shows!" Natasha Isenhour, Artist Socorro, NM, USA "I am a person of very simple tastes. I only like the best. Windsor =amp; Newton paints, Fredrix canvas, and now I happily add Upper Canada Stretchers to my list! Thank you for an outstanding product!" Joseph Kleczynski, Artist 4 EFTA_R1_01232184 EFTA02321495 Rockaway, NJ, USA "My house is 1,100 feet above sea level on the edge of a rain forest. Dampness is a real problem and my stretchers tend to always =arp. Well your stretcher endured eight months up here and reconstruction of my house....and was straight as an arrow. Thank you for a superb =roduct and look forward to using many more Upper Canada's custom =tretchers." Shansi M.
