| **To** | Steve Donnelly <steve.donnelly@coloredge.com <mailto:steve.donnel=y@coloredge.com> > HI Steve.. I've just =ploaded another version of the same photo to your FTP site. I've increased=the contrast in the photo to make the black parts darker. My boss wants th= black areas to be really black. He's comparing them to the print I made which was on a matte paper, so of cours= black is going to look blacker on the matte paper since it's more absorbe=t. Anyways, can we do a proof with the new photo? The photo is called 71staininglblack.jpg Thanks.. 2 EFTA_R1_01184268 EFTA02307075 |
