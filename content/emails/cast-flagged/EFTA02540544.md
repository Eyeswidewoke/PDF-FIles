Rothstein&#=217;s plea related to, AMONGST OTHER THINGS, CREATING AND PROMOTING fake legal settlements AND 
SELLING interests in those settlements TO UNSUSPECTING INVESTORS. Rothstein engaged in these CORRUPT ILLEAGAL 
AND SHAMEL=SS SCHEMES UNDERNEATH THE UMBREALLA OF A LEGAL PRACTICE TO STEAL MONEY. HE,=AND OTHERS 
IN HIS FIRM, DEMONSTRATED AN EXPLOITATION OF THE U.S. LEGAL SYST=M THAT USED AND CREATED FAKE 'VICTIMS' 
TO PROMOTE HIS ILLEGAL A=D LIFE DESTROYING , FAKE SUITS. FBI Investigati=ns continue into the now defunct firm, 
those who worked for the firm, and 84=bsp;many of the ex partners of Rothstein's firm are subject to legal =nd civil 
proceedings. You will be aware that Mr. Edwards himself, faces a pro=essional investigation and serious potential 
charges brought by Mr Epstein.=BR> 
civil suit against Mr Epstein, along with her alleg=tions in it, emerged IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN at the 
time that Scott Roth=tein was creating HIS false claims. If you write a balanced article, you wi=l be bound to record that 
Ms Roberts has made years pReviously sexual harra=ment claims against people other than Mr Epstein and that they 
were thrown =ut of court for her lack of credibility. You will also, presumably, d=aw attention to the fact that, prior to 
filing her civil suit against Mr Ep=tein, and long after she allegedly ceased to be emplo=ed by him as a masseuse, Ms 
Roberts fled the US to avoid being arrested and=presumably be sent to jail for grand theft. Also I think=it is probably 
fair to mention that she has been paid a large sum of =oney by at least one British national newspaper, aside from any 
other monie= that she has received, which represents a further incentive to make any cl=ims that would help keep her 
name in the public domain by attempting to lin= her to Prince Andrew and have what she has to to say be worth any 
money to=those seeking to use her for their own means. All in all, given her record,=which includes a number of other 
highly colourful events, (of which I have =o doubt you will be aware and will reflect) I assume you will treat what sh= 
says with great scepticism. 
TO this point Ms Roberts was I belie=e actually 17 and living with her fiance when Mr Epstein first employed her=as a 
Masseuse. When it comes to Ms Roberts allegations about her time in Lo=don, I can't say I remember being in London 
with her at all and neither can=l remember flying with her. I fly thousands of miles a year all over =he world and would 
be hard pushed to say what plane and with whom I w=s flying even with in the last year.Of course, I've seen the 
photograph=of the Duke of York with 
but I have absolutely no recollec=ion at all of the photograph 
being taken. 
'ye met the Duke=of York on a number of occasions but whenever I've seen him he has been ful=y and properly attired 
and I have no knowledge 
As to my relationship with Mr Epstei=, I can tell you that I do not share any homes anywhere with Mr Epste=n; he does 
not support me in any way at all. For the record I h=d in fact, until very recently, been in a committed and happy 
relationship =or the last seven years with someone else. Mr Epstein's imprisonment =nd the circumstances to which that 
related occurred many years after our re=ationship had ceased.
