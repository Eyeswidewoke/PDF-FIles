All good to know...we most definitely can get the chains fixed for you on the windows...would it be ok for me to send in Karyna tomorrow or Friday to determine the problem and possibly get them fixed prior to your arrival back? Once you are back we can put you in touch with James or maybe even one of Jeffrey's assistants who live at the apartments could swing by to lend you a hand and a lesson...! 1 hope Tess will be in on Friday...she will be out tomorrow for medical EFTA_R1_00939109 EFTA02213732 reasons and let me know she may not be able to come in on Friday...if it is not Friday, we will get her in one day next week (probably more like Wed, as Monday is Labor Day and Jeffrey's main maid does not return from FL until late Tues...and Jeffrey is returning Tues...Don't worry though ...we will figure it all out)!

Thanks for the appletv - it seems much better, though we haven't yet got all the channels and possibilities. When we come again I will have to get James explain. There is also a problem with the chains of the window shields. It will also wait next time. Best regards Nili Sent from my iPhone EFTA_R1_00939110 EFTA02213733 |
