The order was approved for shipment by the appropriate teams, however PayPal prevented us from completing this order as there were insufficient funds in the purchasing account. The message our system received was as follows: PayPal gateway has rejected request. Transaction rejected, please contact the buyer (#10606: Buyer cannot pay) We have been attempting to complete this order for a little over a week in the hopes that the payment response would update. Unfortunately, we received a new message earlier today stating that PayPal will not complete the order. As a result, we have EFTA_R1_00940051 EFTA02214079 cancelled order #740-627542-142810. If you or the original purchaser would like to place a new order, please reply directly to this message immediately after placing the order so I can approve it at our warehouse.

I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this has caused. Please let me know if there's anything I can answer for you at this time. Best regards, Taylor The 23andMe Team Jun 5, 7:34 AM PDT: Hello Taylor. I would like to help Sultan Bin Sulayem facilitate his order #740-627542-142810 of 30 (thirty) -23 and Me" kits he placed an order for on May 21, 2017. You specifically emailed Sultan on May 23, 2017, to find out the use of the 30 kits (you say due to the size of the order you need to find out the intended use for the kits). He would like to give the kits to his co-workders so they too may enjoy investigating their ancestry. (Sultan participated with his own DNA and found it fascinating...he wants the people he works with to participate as well) The kits are to be delivered to: Jeffrey Epstein 9 East 71st Street NY, NY 10021 The kits are to be delivered to Jeffrey's address for ease. We have ordered many kits ourselves as gifts...indeed, Sultan received his personal kit from Jeffrey as a gift. The kits were paid for by Jim Miller who is Sultan's Personal Assistant. Jim has a supplementary credit card that is linked to Sultan's account so he can make purchases in Sultan's name. Please advise what, if any, other information you would like so we may have the kits shipped as soon as possible. If we need to make an entire new order, please let me know so we may do so. > Begin forwarded message: > From: Sultan Bin Sulaye > Subject: Fwd: (983918) Action Required - Your 23andMe Order #740.627542-142810 > Date: June 3 2017 at 1:20:16 AM EDT > To: > Dear > I assumed you have not received my package yet I ordered 30 test kits I received this e mail a while agol answered it as on the following e mail can you chase them in please > Yours EFTA_R1_00940052 EFTA02214080 > Sultan > Sent from my iPhone > Begin forwarded message: » From: customercare(5)23andme.com <mailto:customercarea23andme.com> » Date: May 23, 2017 at 5:07:37 PM GMT+2 >> To: ssulayem » Subject: Re: (983918) Action Required - Your 23andMe Order #740-827542-142810 » Reply-To: customercare(W23andme corn <mailto:customercarea23andme.com> Sultan Bin sulayem, May 23, 9:18 AM PDT: I have purchased one kit 3 months ago and it was iinteresting to see my results I put a large purchase of Ancestry test kits in behalf of many co-workers in my company who wanted to do the same test Once I receive the kits each individual will register and send his kit to your lab to be analyzed Taylor, May 23, 8:07 AM PDT: Hello Jeffery, I am reaching out to you with regards to your recent 23andMe order #74(-627542- 142810.
