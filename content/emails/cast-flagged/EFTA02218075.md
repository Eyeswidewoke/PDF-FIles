Regards, Natalia (Natasha) Molotkova Centurion Relationship Manager Hours: Mon through Friday 9AM-530PM EST Morning! I have been speaking with Solange...Jeffrey changed his mind on the timing of the flights for Elina and Lasma Elina is to depart Paris July 9th Sunday in the morning ...we put on hold a United flight but the price tag is high! I can see on Orbitz flights for less...can you match the price? AA flight round trip, coach with seat choice and bag is $1779.36. Solange quoted me $1934.06 for the United flight we have on hold. Last is to go from Riga to Paris on Sunday July 9th afternoon now. Paris to Barcelona remains the same on Tues. night July 11th... Let me know if you can get better pricing than Solange gave me...thanks!
