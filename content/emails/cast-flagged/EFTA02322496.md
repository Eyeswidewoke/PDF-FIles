Also, do you know of any other contractors who would be able to make the =over for my radiator and AC area in my living room? I gave Penn the =esign over a week ago, he's been to see it in person 3 times and I =till have no quote from him or any indication when he can do the work. =effrey is giving me grief for not having it done yet as I also need to =ave my apt painted but can't until this is done. I've attached photos =f what it looks like now and a sketch of what I'd like done. Pretty =imple I think. I want the design from the sketch, but with 3 removable =rates going across so I have the option to cover the AC and shelves if = want. Any suggestions for a contractor would be great. thank you.. 1 EFTA_R1_01235025 EFTA02322496 |
