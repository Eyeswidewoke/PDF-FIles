I will of course let you =now if it sells or indeed if it falls through but a figure between 1Sm = 20m euros is not of interest to the vendor. If you could come back and have another =ook in the spring should it remain available it would be =reat.

We were told that an offer had been accepted in the low =0s by another buyer. We think a price between 15 and 20 =ould be as high as we would go, and that would include all taxes. We =alcualted that at least 5- 10 months would be needed and 18 months to =inish the guest part, redo plumbing, electrical and infrastructure, =hich frankly appeared quite old. If your other offer falls =hrough, please contact me. Otherwise thank you very much for your time. =e understand sellers can sometimes be stubborn, but there is a reason =hat this has been on the market for so long without a sale. =nbsp; Happy New =ear.

On Dec 23, 2018, at 10:34, Alex Peto a> =rote: Dear Karyna 4 EFTA_R1_01199947 EFTA02312121 It was a pleasure to =eet you and show you some properties during your visit to Marrakech. =elow is a brief synopsis of each of the 3 properties you saw. Bin Ennakhil - the =sking price remains at 55m euros but as discussed this price is =egotiable and we had it under contact last year but due to health =easons the purchaser had to pull out. I now believe an offer circa 35m =uros would be acceptable. This property is unique and will never be =ble to be recreated, it is a work of art or a monument as much as =abulous property. Dar Olfa - like Bin Ennakhil the asking price remains at 65m =uros and was also under contact last year but due tax reasons the deal =id not go ahead - it is likely a figure around 40 - 45m euros would be =cceptable. The only comparable recent sale was in this compound known =s Bab Atlas and was the sale of the largest property there for a =eputed 100m euros to The Emir of Qatar. Ksar Swan - also located in Bab Atlas =ith an asking price of 30m euros is less negotiable. This property is =wned by the developer of the whole project and as you saw has some =onderful workmanship with hand carved cedar ceilings and beautiful =ardens. As it is lived in most of the year it has a much warmer or =omely feeling to the all the others you saw. The very high end property market in =arrakech is as expected a tiny part of the market and there are no =omparable sales since the purchase by the Emir however right now Ali =ongo from Gabon and Al Nahyan family of Abu Dhabi are both building =alaces which will cost over 40m euros each. Normally when purchasing a property in =orocco one should add approximately 10% to the purchase price spilt 6% =n government taxes, 1% Notaire fees and 3% real estate agency fees =owever in the case of Bin Ennakhil for example as the property is owned =y a company in Lichtenstein there are no government taxes to be paid in =orocco. I am sending via wetransfer more pictures of Bin Ennakhil, =sar Swari and Dar Olfa and you have the PDF brochures for each =roperty. I look forward to hearing from you and of course I remain at =our disposal should you have any more questions.
