| **Subject** | Re: tell 'em the end is near. :) Well..= there is ton going on, obviously. BTC itself likely to become a kin= of hedge commodity, but not yet a currency for transactions (which they w=rry about). But... there are ways to manage a decentralized currenc= to keep it's value really stable - basically increase money supply to=peg against USD/EUR. And wallet providers (like coinbase) will become the ne= banks - providing people with security from theft and maybe recourse. 40=A0 So those companies will be the ones the USGov should seek to regulate. =C2* Hope you are doing well. My new virtual world is =oming together very fast and is going to be big.
