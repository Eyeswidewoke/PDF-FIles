CLINTON DIVORCE CRISIS 
Photo by: SPLASH NEWS ONLINE 
Hillary Clinton - fed up with her husband Bill's cheating - secretly met with a top lawyer and drew up 
divorce papers. She also compiled a list of his lovers to use as ammunition in the split! 
"That bombshell disclosure has been dished by divorce lawyers 
<http://www.nationalenquirer.com/sen hillary clinton expresident bill clinton divorce list of women r

<htto://www.nationalenquirer.com/sen hillary clinton expresident bill clinton divorce list of women ra

in the know," a source told The ENQUIRER. When Hillary later decided to run for a Senate seat in New 
York she abandoned her plans to dump Bill. 
"But the list of lovers she drew up in haste and gave to a lawyer is still apparently sitting in that attorney's 
safe in Manhattan." 
The list includes the names of "at least two drop-dead gorgeous Hollywood actresses 
<http://www.nationalenouirer.com/sen hillary clinton expresident bill clinton divorce list of women ra 
oul felder lawyer monica lewinsky senate/celebrity/66497> " along with other names that would be 
"recognizable" to the public, said the source. 
Hillary - who stood by Bill during the Monica Lewinsky scandal - drew up the list after the Clintons left 
the White House, and Bill was linked to several attractive women. 
There were rumors about Bill's involvement with curvy 38-year-old Lisa Belzberg, who'd split from her 
husband Matthew Bronfman, heir to the Seagram liquor fortune. 
He was also linked with actresses Julie Bowen and Saffron Burrows, British socialite Ghislaine 
Maxwell and New York socialite Sale Johnson. 
Sources said Hillary also warned Bill about his friendship 
<http://www.nationalencluirer.com/sen hillary clinton expresident bill clinton divorce list of women ra 
oul felder lawyer monica lewinsky senate/celebrity/66497> with wealthy blonde Canadian divorcee 
Belinda Stronach, once dubbed "the young Hillary." 
The ENQUIRER exclusively revealed Bill's extramarital affair with blonde divorcee Julie Tauber 
McMahon, whose millionaire father was a top Democratic Party fundraiser and a family friend of the 
Clintons. Julie denied the affair yet lived only a few miles away from the Clinton home in Chappaqua,

oul felder lawyer monica lewinsky senate/celebrity/66497> lawyer Raoul Felder - who's not involved 
in the Clinton case - told The ENQUIRER: "If Hillary had divorce papers written up but not filed, the 
lawyer must keep them secure for at least seven years. That is the law. 
"But they will always remain secret. Even if Hillary died, the lawyer can never divulge their contents 
because it falls under privileged information. That would be wholly illegal."
