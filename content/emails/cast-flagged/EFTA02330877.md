| **CC** | Richard Kahn Dear Jeffrey, I am sincerely =orry to have disappointed, and appreciate your recognition of our efforts. To that end, I will not charge for any of the time spent in September, for either myself or my team, or any reimbursable expenses spent in preparation for th= presentation. <1=> The scope of wo=k requested is simply too large for a studio of my size. Thus I agree with your suggestion, that we should not continue to work together. <1=> I will continue to <=font>track the two orders that have been placed, for the throws and the sheeting, and will ensure that they are delivered to you as agreed (the throws will come =o NYC and the sheeting directly to the island, expect=d at the end of the month.) <1=> And certainly, if desired, I can provide all of the CAD drawings produced for your future use. Additionally, I will make arrangements this week to return the hard back suitcase that was used for sending the samples from Santa Fe to the island. </a I trust that the July and August invoice will be paid, and truly hope that our paths will cross in the future. </a Respectfully,</=ont> Amy EFTA_R1_01263269 EFTA02330877 <=ont size="3" color="tt000000" face="Times New Roman"> On M=n, Sep 15, 2014 at 11:52 AM, jeffrey E. <jeevacation@gmail.com>= wrote: amy, Im not sure where to start. as you=know I used to teach and have to give out grades. if i had to grade =our presentation on sat it would be A for effort but either D =r F for results.
