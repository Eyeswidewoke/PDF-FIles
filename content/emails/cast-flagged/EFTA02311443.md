| **Subject** | Re: 10B I'm waiting to hear back from Andrew, the super, to confirm the building will be taking care of the cost of repairs since I'm guessing it was a structural issue that caused the leak. It seems quite expensive to replace the current flooring. Is there perhaps a different alternative that would be less expensive; a different type of wood flooring perhaps? Also, the bedroom doesn't need to be done in this apt..we will be carpeting it.
