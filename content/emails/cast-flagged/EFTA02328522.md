| **Subject** | Re: 23andme kit for Jabor When I verify the email address it takes me to other screens asking if I am u=ing this kit in for myself or someone else. I can click on "someone else". T=en next screen asks me for the persons name... I don't know Jabor's last na=e. I know it starts with a "y". Next screen asks for his birthdate which l=don't know. It seems to me I DO need to fill this stuff out in order for th= kit to be processed. Please let me know if you wish me to merely confirm m= email address or fill out the rest. I have already confirmed my email addr=ss so if this is all you need it is complete. I am heading to Hartford for a=basketball tournament so away from my computer but have my cell. • lesley Sent from my iPhone > On May 6, 2017, at 10:20 AM, Karyna Shuliak < > wro=e: > Hi Lesley, > The 14 digit number on the tube is: > You don't need to fill out anything in his account, just verify the email a=d follow the instructions in the message.
