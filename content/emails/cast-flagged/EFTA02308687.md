| **Subject** | JE's new favorite drink! JE is drinking a new lime drink so I would like to pass on the recipe (which has taken a lot of adjustment to get it as he enjoys it best) below. I squeeze 3 large limes, mix with 3 teaspoons sugar and a few drops vanilla essence. I was at first mixing the sugar with hot water to get it to dissolve but he prefers it just mixed in with the juice from the limes, and no water involved! He likes it served with ice and salt (with a little sugar in it) around the rim of the glass. And preferably in a whisky glass ;) Thank you!! <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.O.dtd"> cplist version="1.0"> <dict> <key>date-sent</key> <real>1338750181</real> <key>flags</key> <integer>8590195713</integer> <key>original-mailbox< e > <string>imap: NBOX4string> <key>remote-i < ey> <string>30113</string> <key>subject</key> <string>JE's new favorite drink!</string> </dict> </plist> EFTA_R1_01188815 EFTA02308687 |
