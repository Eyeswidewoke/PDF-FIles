Jeffrey said you could fly back on Thursday night. There i= an American flight leaving St.T at 7:50pm, through San Juan, leaving SJ =t 9:15pm, arriving JFK at 12am. I think if you were to leave on Thursday,=that makes the most sense to maximize your time here for the day. Does th=t all sound OK to you?
