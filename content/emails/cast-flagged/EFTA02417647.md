I suggested Thursday, Dec. 2nd...but said Friday. Dec. 3 and Sat. Dec. 4 were possibilities. 
I said no press. Maybe we can put a "palace approved item" in the paper after Andrew leaves the country...but not 
imperative. 
There is a private dining room above La Grenouillc, but only seats 30. Or take over the back of the restaurant. (Graydon 
Caner has dinners there.) 3 East 52nd St. 
We just called the Park Ave. screening room at 59th and Park that seats 75 which we don't have to fill. 
The room is not available on Thursday. Dec. 2...so we put on hold for Friday, Dec. 3 and 4th. We are looking into other 
rooms for the 2nd. 
We are looking into the Core Club room that holds 65. 
More to come. Peg
