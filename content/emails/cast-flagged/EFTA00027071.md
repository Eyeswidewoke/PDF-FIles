> 3ny edits to this before it goes out tomorrow? Thanks again, From Sent: Monday, October 19, 2020 4:06 PM To: Cc: Subject: 5th Production cover letters Hi, all! I'm preparing the 5th Production to go out today, and I've attached the cover letter for defense counsel and two cover letters for Maxwell (one main cover letter to be included with the drive sent to MDC, and one letter containing the password to be sent in a separate envelope to MDC). Please review at your convenience; once you approve, I'll have both drives sent out. Thank you very much! Paralegal Specialist U.S. Attorney's Off
