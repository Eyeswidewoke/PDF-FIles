INTELLECTUALVENTURES 
The Global Good Fund is a collaborative effort between Bill Gates and Intellectual Ventures. Our goal 
is to combine the power of invention with innovative business strategies to develop solutions that 
generate sustainable impact in the developing world. 
Our Approach 
Global Good tackles problems in the developing world by using resources and methods normally 
reserved for commercial pursuits. We work closely with the Intellectual Ventures Laboratory (IV Lab) to 
create innovative solutions in Global Health and Development. Guided in part by the expertise of 
partner organizations such as the foundation, Global Good focuses on important problems where 
invention can translate into meaningful impact in developing countries. 
These include Disease 
Modeling, Vaccine Logistics, Vector Management, Malaria and TB Diagnostics, Maternal and Child 
Health and Agricultural Productivity. Our goal is to think big and take on problems with unconventional 
approaches that will hopefully create breakthrough inventions that solve real world problems. To 
maximize the extent of this impact, Global Good partners with key industry players that offer 
unprecedented manufacturing and distribution capacity on a global scale. These partners benefit from 
the inventions generated by IV Lab, and in return, commit to building a dynamic, economically-viable 
business ecosystem around these solutions. 
Global Good is a for-profit entity that subscribes to Global Access principles. This means that our 
partners benefit from royalty-free commercialization of our inventions in the developing world. 
Royalties generated from commercialization of our inventions in the developed world are invested back 
into The Global Good Fund to repeat the cycle. 
Left: We hove developed new computer models that 
calculate not only how diseases spread in a particular port 
of the world, but also how they will respond to deliberate 
suppression efforts. 
Our team of business analysts and IV Lab 
experts evaluates each problem to assess the 
opportunity for invention and impact. We 
encourage the staff at the Bill & Melinda Gates 
Foundation to share problems with our team 
for evaluation and possible research and 
development activity. We have also dedicated 
staff to handle one-off inquires received from 
the staff at the Bill & Melinda 
Gates 
Foundation. In situations where we may have 
limited ability to tackle a problem, Global Good 
could play an advisory role, connecting you to qualified external teams. 
Global Good does not fund externally-driven projects or provide grants to third-parties. We do not refer 
external researchers who are seeking funding for their projects to the foundation. 
What We Offer 
Our biggest resource is IV Lab, a team of more than 130 inventors, scientists and engineers, including 
more than 30 Ph.D.s, operating under the principle of 'invent with intent'. From initial project definition 
to commercial partner handoff, IV Lab plays a pivotal role in Global Good's efforts to invent technologies 
and develop solutions. IV Lab focuses on the very early stages of innovation by conducting proof-of-

concept experiments and building prototypes that establish the validity of its ideas. These invention, 
research, and development activities transform untested ideas into viable solutions that can advance to 
commercialization and deployment. To do this, IV Lab has built expertise and capability around various 
technology platforms that target specific problems in each thematic area. These technology platforms 
include super-insulated containers, advanced thermal management technologies, biological micro-
manipulation, automated microscopic sample preparation and analysis, automated disease diagnostics, 
insect vector targeting and tracking systems, microfluidic systems, and robust electro-mechanical 
devices for use in resource limited settings. As an example, our expertise in super-insulated containers 
and advanced thermal management helped us develop solutions in both vaccine logistics (Passive 
Vaccine Storage Device) and agricultural productivity (Milk Transportation and Storage Device). 
Recent Accomplishments 
Strengthening and Extending the Vaccine Cold 
Chain - Inventions to store and transport 
vaccines can help reduce the nearly one 
million childhood deaths each year from 
vaccine-preventable diseases. One of the 
greatest challenges to reaching children for 
vaccination is preserving the vaccine cold 
chain. We invented the Passive Vaccine 
Storage Device which uses super insulation 
techniques 
to 
store 
vaccines 
at 
safe 
temperatures for months using only ice. 
Vaccines can then be retrieved without 
jeopardizing the remaining vials and the 
insulated container can remain in the field for 
repeated 
use. 
The 
units 
are 
currently 
undergoing field testing in Kenya. Commercial manufacturing and distribution is planned for mid-2014. 
Improving TB diagnostics in developing countries - when dealing with sputum, the standard clinical 
specimen for TB diagnostics, sample preparation and processing presents substantial technical 
challenges. Our team of engineers and chemists are developing a novel method to concentrate and 
capture bacteria from sputum that has the potential to greatly simplify hands-on processing of 
specimens prior to detection. With support from TB experts around the world, IV Lab is developing TB 
diagnostic procedures that may be more sensitive and easier to use than microscopy, while retaining the 
key attributes required within developing world health systems. 
Computer models for eradication and control of infectious diseases - The Institute for Disease 
Modeling (IDM) at IV Lab has developed detailed, geographically-specific, and mechanistic stochastic 
simulations of disease transmission. These modeling and quantitative analysis tools are used as decision-
making tools to determine the combination of health policies and intervention strategies that can lead 
to disease eradication or control of infectious diseases. 
Engage with Global Good 
Global Good invests its own capital in the initial, high-risk phase of invention and R&D. We work 
together with our colleagues at the foundation to ensure the end solution is applicable and 
commercially viable for the developing world. Please contact Ali Arjomand at Global Good 
(aarjomand@intven.com) for more information. 
Together, we invent, develop, and deploy commercially-viable technologies that improve life in 
developing countries.
