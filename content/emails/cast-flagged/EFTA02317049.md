It appears that Mr. Christopher Auge of Ship Antiques was hired to pick up and pack the chandelier. Mr. Auge delivered the chandelier to Ecu Line, who shipped it via boat from Antwerp to Miami. In Miami the chandelier was turned over to Econo Caribe, who forwarded the freight to us on St. Thomas. It was received on St. Thomas by Bob Lynch Trucking, who contacted us when the cargo was available for pick up. The Consignee information should be: Brice Gordon/LSJ, LLC Little St. James Island 6100 Red Hook Quarters B3 St. Thomas, VI 00802-1348 The invoice should state the value in USD, the country of origin. If the value is not in USD, the date of purchase is important because we will have to do the conversion based on that date.

Isn't this how we shipped the pineapple chandelier from France before?
