If you want, we can move all my appliances from 14G =itchen to the new apt and you can replace 14G with Ikea appliances. I have charcoal grey cabinets, but thinking of changing to a natural =ood color; I will confirm the color early next week and choose the =ounter top color, etc. On Jul 3, 2012, at 2:49 PM, Anthony Barrett wrote: > All sounds ok.

We have =een using the IKEA white kitchens ( go see 4H ) and let me know if this =ould work for you? They have numerous other options in stock. We =ould do a W/D as well as a dishwasher ( see 4H) layout. The =efrigerator is 28" deep and 35" wide also from IKEA ( with ice maker =nd water dispenser) Used it a few times and have had no problems. All =his is on IKEAs website. No problem to move the bathroom fixtures from =4G to 111( we may need to order a new shower body however) Will you be =liminating the tub in 11J? > Anthony > On Jul 3, 2012, at 10:52 AM,nrote: » HI Anthony, » The company we used for all the supplies was Porcelanosa.

So I have to check again if you have another =pt we can possibly switch it with?

I want to do the closets properly and well thought out. I'd =ike to use California Closets for the finishing of them. If they aren't =lready built out larger, I will need them to be. I'd like to do the =ame baseboards as 2G. I have all the tiles and finishes in mind for the =athroom and kitchen already. The kitchen I'd like the same layout, but =ossibly different color scheme.l'd like to put in the washer/dryer unit =nstead of a dishwasher. I have a whole list of things I have done to =y apt that I would like to replicate: I have double thick windows in =he bedroom for sound insulation, track lighting on the ceiling in =edroom and living room. If possible, I'd like to put a ceiling fan in =he bedroom. Light plank hardwood floors(l'm sourcing now) venetian =laster on all the walls(' will have the same guy do 11J as did 14G) =isal carpet in bedroom(same as the one I have now), I had my own guy =ake a very nice radiator cover in the living room with drawers which I =ill have him do the same for 11J in living room and bedroom. That would =e great to have the bathroom fixtures moved to new apt; will that work =ith the valves, etc? The brand is Dorn Braht.
