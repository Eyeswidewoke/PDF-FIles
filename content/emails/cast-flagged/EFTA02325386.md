| **Subject** | Re: Chef Hi Steve, I'm not sure yet if I will be in NY at all next week. I should have a better sense on Sunday. I mentioned to Jeffrey you have someone you want to try out, and he suggested that the chef could do a small dinner at his house in New York the week of Sept 19th. He will be having several guests at the house that week and it could be a good opportunity for him to try out as well. If I end up in NY next week, I will let you know! Thank you for your help!

Would you like to be there for the tasting if you are in NY? We will do the tasting and then make sure he is ready to go and then do an interview with you. As it is obviously important for you to meet him and give more color on the details of what the job will be. I have covered about 80% of it but you know the minutia of the needs. Tell me what works best.
