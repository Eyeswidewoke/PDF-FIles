| **Subject** | RE: Max will be relieved - Stephen Shapiro just called and is going to find out what is available in June to rent in the 3 different areas along the beach. I said I would look at all 3 and would make a decision based more on the house than the area probably. Do you have a view? I don't know anything about Malibu or LA for that matter. Anyway, regardless of that, Stephen told me that the weather is normally lousy in June -Is that right? What does lousy mean? Is it just hazy?
