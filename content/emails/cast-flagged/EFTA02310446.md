| **To** | Hi OMR Just want to ask you about radiator covers for 8H, when I spoke with Anthon= I said to him to leave it as it is, as it appeared quite expensive to put=new ones, but the Penn told me today, that he has got your approval to put=the new ones, is that right? Also there is one bookcase from the store called Lazzoni, that I had to can=ell, as they have changed its design, so there should be a full refund on =our credit card. And also Penn said that they should be done on Thursday with the bathroom i= 8H, so painting can get started on Friday. 1 EFTA_R1_01194130 EFTA02310446 |
