Sir 
Please see attached a spread sheet summarising the JOS position. 
Commercial Work to June 2009 
Hourly Salary Rate for Johnny is charged at US$65 per hour. 
We deducted US$31K in expenses from the Commercial Work figure as we regarded them to be 
Hartmoor expenses. Although JOS has also said that even if we added these amounts back in he would 
NOT accept 25 cents in the dollar. 
Huge numbers of expenses put through — lots of restaurants, office supplies etc and a number of 
expenses in the name of Hartmoor (eg email server $1,788). Examples of odd things — Columbia School 
late payment fees $1,155, Gerry Cassanova Health Plan $1,984.. 
In June 2009 once Hartmoor closes, JOS moves all of the costs to the Charity Work... 
NB JOS received US$79,000 in full settlement of his Hartmoor claim in May 2009.... This is not 
shown as off-set on the schedules.. 
Charity Work

EFTA02416148

Again Hourly Salary Rate of US$65 per hour — not sure anyone else has charged the Charity for costs... 
Expenses — Columbia late fees $1,189 (July), $1,736 (June), $818 (December) $398 (July). From April 
2009 seems to be charging 50% of his utility bills 
On both sets of invoices there are monthly storage costs of $223 per month and telephone bills of around 
$400 per month with no explanation.... 
Hope this helps...
