Here it =s so you can see what we're getting her: http://www.=tsy.com/listing/61771856/goddess-beaded-garter The original place I was working on - =ig and Olive - was going to require a deposit but they just told me yesterday=that a group might be buying them out and so they couldn't make the contra=t at this time. So..l went with Kate's second choice - Corsino - no =eposit required so we're good. I'll be sending details to all soon.<=span> And you're hilar=ous - I actually almost never call her Kathryn - I generally call her Kate=or KK....ha! > wrote: Hi Ladies, I was wo=dering if you would like to go in together on a gift for Kathryn that we c=uld give to her at the dinner on the 18th. She indicated she wanted = particular garter - I went ahead and bought it for her - and then thought=maybe this would be something we could all give her. Let me know wha= you think! If not no biggie! thanks!=/div> Megan 1 EFTA_R1_01209533 EFTA02315234 |
