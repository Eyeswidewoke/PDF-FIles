| **Subject** | Re: HI Colette, Yes, I saw the worker in 11P this morning and saw the stains. He said he =ould try and see if the stains come out first with the bleaching, and =f not, then we can replace. If they don't come out with the bleaching =rocess, then yes, definitely we will have them replaced. And yes, we =ill proceed with the baseboards in 8H and 11P. I saw the sample for =hat as well today. Thank you! The floors look great in 8H by the way!
