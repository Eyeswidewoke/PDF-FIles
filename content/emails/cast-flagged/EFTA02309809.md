| **To** | Jeffrey Epstein < =div dir="Itr">Dear Jeffrey, > > Thank you for being here =or and with me, it just makes everything so much better and warmer inside =f me. I now know I cannot stay in London lo=g term or indefinitely but it makes it more palatable to be here if I know=it is temporary and I am working with a plan towards where I want to be. l=don't know that I can work towards this without spending some time her= because any route pursued will be a process. I don't know what a residency program is but I am thinking it is ref=rring to me saying, I would do what it took to be where I wanted to be eve= if that meant a masters? So my options remain th= same really: 1. To do some work here while applying for a progr=m in the US, and then during that, sort out my situation for good 2. To try to develop myself to highly specialized level here (O-1) <=iv>3. To set up a business (E,2) I have ideas for=things I would like to set up but absolutely no knowledge of the business =ide which I have to learn somewhere, somehow and fast. I also wanted to as= you if it would be ok to speak to Arda via skype or phone? =kW> In the interim, Liaigre (London) reached out to me today and wou=d like to meet with me tomorrow. My mom is =oming to London for December and half of January so that will make a very =ery big difference for that period of time. I am thinking to see what Liai=re comes up with tomorrow and then plan South Africa? =div>Another issue here is finding a place and rent. Short term stays seem =o charge around 40% more monthly for the same property than long term stay=. Long term you can request a break clause at 6 months but if you break be=ore you would have to find someone to sublet from you. =br> On=Wed, Oct 3, 2018 at 10:47 PM J < <mailto = target=> wrote: EFTA_R1_01192910 EFTA02309809 paul suggested a short trip to sa =AO and then maybe a full time in residnece program somewhere . is th=t what you want? =C2 please note The information containe= in this communication is confidential, may be attorney-client privileg=d, may constitute inside information, and is intended only for the u=e of the addressee.
