At the same time as correcting this issue in interviews Jeffrey Epstein's lawyer sent me a suggested letter in your name 
which I copied to you — post my request for further information I never heard anything more on this.

James, I am also confused. We have corrected the problem, publicly with People Magazine and The New York Times. 
Although they are not out yet, so were we not waiting for the answers back from Jeffreys team?

It is really orren•ous to •e continua y u • to 
y a •out y t e newspapers. It is beyond any 
words, as you know. 
I know you spoke to James. I of all people understand what it feels like to be castagated by the Tabloids. I know how you 
feel. 
I know you also feel hellaciously let down by me, from what you were either told or read, and I must humbly apologise 
to you and your heart for that. You have always been a steadfast, generous and supreme friend to me and my family. 
As you know I did absolutely not say the P. Word about you. But understand it was reported that I did. 
However, I am apologising to you today for not replying to your email, or reaching out to you when the tabloids were so 
vicious and horrendous... In the weeks leading up to that monday when I made my statement. And then afterwards. 
When they used me to hurt you beyond realms.

As you know, it was and is the worst nightmare for you, but also for me. As you know the whole story did not come 
about because of me. 
However because of my statement they made it worse for you. I understand all this. 
You know me well, and we are steadfast to that. But, I must apologise for not reaching out to you or answering your 
email. It is unlike me. Therefore, you can only deduce, that something else must have been going on, for me to react in 
this way. So in the eye of your storm, which I know is hellacious, may I ask you to accept my apology for not reaching out 
to you, in the eye of MY storm, and accept and understand that I was in fear beyond all totality and I could not move left 
or right because of it, and was close to bed ridden with the fear of what was happening. I was paralysed. I was advised in 
no uncertain terms to having nothing to do with you, and not to speak or email you, and if I did, I would cause more 
problems to both You and The Duke and myself. So I shut down and ran away. I was broken and lost. So please 
understand, as I do about you, that I ws broken and not the strong person you know, and I got completely obliterated 
too, and I saw all my childrens work etc disappearing.. I shut down and everyone out. I was frightened. The Palace 
system is frightening, and each step I turned or each action was wrong and I did not want to hurt Andrew one more 
time. 
So Jeffrey, this email is sent with a hope you accept, and understand a little of my side too. 
We are and have both been in the firing line, both blamed for stuff we have not done, this front line attack has been like 
this for me for 22 years. You would have thought I was thick skinned enough to handle it. I know there are 2 sides to 
every story, I have heard yours, please hear mine. 
I am glad you spoke to James, and James made you aware from the British media standpoint, that all this hellaciousness 
had been going on many days BEFORE my statement. And I was instructed to act with the uptmost speed, from most 
sides, if I was to have any chance at all holding onto my career as a childrens book author etc and a childrens 
philanthropist, and I got terrified. I should have taken advice from you too, before speaking to Geordie, and taken a day 
or two to think of the ramifications of my actions, but for the reasons as stated above, I was in over riding fear. I am 
sorry. I just did not know what or where to turn. 
I know James can send you every single article from the days, weeks, leading up to that Monday of the statement from 
the endless horrendous pages written about You and The Duke. So you can see why I became paralysed. 
I know you and James are going to work on a solution. 
In the meantime, I write this from the truth of my heart.
