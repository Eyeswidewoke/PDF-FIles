» In the summer of 2009, in a talk at the Bristol (UK) Festival of =deas, Freeman Dyson articulated a vision for the 
future. He referenced =The Age Of Wonder", by Richard Holmes, in which the first Romantic Age =escribed by Holmes 
was centered on chemistry and poetry, while Dyson =ointed out that this new age is dominated by computational 
biology. Its =eaders, he noted, include "biology wizards" Kary Mullis, Craig Venter, =edical engineer Dean Kamen; and 
"computer wizards" Larry Page and =ergey Brin, and Charles Simonyi. He pointed out that the nexus for this =ntellectual 
activity — the Lunar Society for the 21st century — is =entered around the activities of EDGE. 
» Dyson continued to articulate his vision for a new age of biology in = related review inNew York Review of Books in 
which he wrote: "...a new =eneration of artists, writing genomes as fluently as Blake and Byron =rote verses, might 
create an abundance of new flowers and fruit and =rees and birds to enrich the ecology of our planet. Most of these 
=rtists would be amateurs, but they would be in close touch with =cience, like the poets of the earlier Age of Wonder. 
The new Age of =onder might bring together wealthy entrepreneurs like Venter and Kamen =.. and a worldwide 
community of gardeners and farmers and breeders, rorking together to make the planet beautiful as well as fertile, 
=ospitable to hummingbirds as well as to humans."

» Scientists' greatest pleasure comes from theories that derive the =olution to some deep puzzle from a small set of 
simple principles in a =urprising way. These explanations are called "beautiful" or "elegant". =istorical examples are 
Kepler's explanation of complex planetary =otions as simple ellipses, Bohr's explanation of the periodic table of =he 
elements in terms of electron shells, and Watson and Crick's double =elix. Einstein famously said that he did not need 
experimental =onfirmation of his general theory of relativity because it "was so =eautiful it had to be true." 
The EDGE Question 2012 
• 
WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE DEEP, ELEGANT, OR BEAUTIFUL =XPLANATION? 
» Since this question is about explanation, answers may embrace =cientific thinking in the broadest sense: as the most 
reliable way of =aining knowledge about anything, including other fields of inquiry such =s philosophy, mathematics, 
economics, history, political theory, =iterary theory, or the human spirit. The only requirement is that some =imple and 
non-obvious idea explain some diverse and complicated set of =henomena.

» Of course, your own explanations are deep, elegant, and beautiful. =ut give it a rest for this exercise and please avoid 
citing your own =heory, idea, explanation. Also, think of examples that are not =ompletely obvious—we don't want a

» Say something new, true, and interesting based on your own =xperience, in 1,000 words or less. 
» Go deeper than the news. Tell us something we don't know. This is not = purely scientific question: this is question 
about our culture and =urselves. The ideas we present on EDGE can offer a new set of metaphors =o describe ourselves, 
our minds, the way we think, the world, and all =f the things we know in it. 
» As usual, no politics ("Democrat" "Republican") or politicians ="Obama" "Romney" "Clinton" "Gingrich", etc.). No 
editorials, Op-eds, =pinion pieces, flippancy. No ad hominem comments. No self-promotion: no =eferencing your books, 
papers, courses. No "selling from the stage", =ushing your well-known agenda. No footnotes, credits, or hyperlinks in 
=he text: stay on the page. No anecdotes about spouses, significant =thers, kids, family pets. Write a stand-alone piece: 
don't respond to =he pieces of other contributors already posted. 
» This is the annual opportunity for the EDGE community to give =omething back, to provide an important public 
service, to make a =tatement by presenting uncompromisingly sophisticated science-minded =hinking to a wide global 
audience. Be imaginative, exciting, =ompelling, inspiring. Tell a great story. Make an argument that makes a =ifference. 
Amaze and delight. Surprise us!

reciprocal =gnorance of literary cultures and sciences of each other. Successfully. =f you take the algorithms developed 
by Larry Page and Sergey Brin, =hich measure the value of links, EDGE'S website ranks seven on a global =cale of ten. 
THE NEW YORK TIMES ranks nine, eBay at eight.
