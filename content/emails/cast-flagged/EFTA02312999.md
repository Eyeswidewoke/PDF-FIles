I stopped by today 12/18 Bathroom looks good, just needs medicine cabinet shelves & doors. Hinges have been changed. Radiator under vanity is not visible so I don't think it needs a cov=r. Only issue now is the bathroom door is warped. They have started painting in bedroom & entry/living area I will stop tomorrow again to talk to Andrew as he was heading out of the burlding today as I was heading in.
