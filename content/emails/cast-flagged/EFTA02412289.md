Title: Re: Andrew/Thurs, Dec. 2 
Well there you go. Her email is: 
Invite her to bring Woody. Then I will also call Woody's office and invite him. 
If you get Woody...you can probably then build to Charlie Rose, 
Fareed Zalcaria, Rick Stengel (editor of Time), 
Cynthia McFadden (Nightline), George Stephanopulous, Chris Cuomo and Cristina Cuomo, she is beautiful and 
smart...Christiane Amanpour....Katie 
If Woody comes, we can ask other film makers...like David Koepp, Tony Gilroy, Stephen Daldrey who is hilarious. We 
can find out where Oliver Stone is. I know all those people. 
Actually Woody is very friendly with Richard LeFrak...the more friends of Woody's you can get, then he will come.

Woody is a great idea. Do you know Woody? I do. 
Could there be any resistance because he had a public issue with Soon-Yi?...just thinking ahead. 
Woody is very friendly with Lorinda Ash. who I think is weird. He may feel better if people he knows arc around. 
On the other hand a royal may intrigue him. 
The other thing we could do...is, I have a dvd of "The King's Speech" and we can show it to him...but we can't tell 
anyone.
