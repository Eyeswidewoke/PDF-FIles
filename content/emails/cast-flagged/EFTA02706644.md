Hi 
Still in Costa Rica. The guy that owes us the money is making excuses and =akes me around without anything 
done.While he was driving me yesterday ,=e got attacked and robbed by two guys with revolvers. I wonder if it was n=t 
a set up to make me quit. 
At least wasn't hurt but it is a strange feeling to have a gun on your face When they left they shot the tire. 
Not a boring life
