RE: Re: 
Forty years ago, Israel was one of the most admired countries in the world. Now it is most disliked. Forty years ago it 
was pretty clear, as I wrote at the time (and I was far from alone), that those who call themselves "supporters of Israel" 
are in fact supporters of its moral degeneration, international isolation, constant conflict and security problems, and 
maybe worse. So it has occurred. Israel even now has an official whose task is to deal with international isolation. 
Israelis like to attribute all this to anti-Semitism, which hasn't changed in the past 40 years. Or to appeal to "we have no 
negotiating partner," which won't wash. The problem is not Netanyahu. The policies and problems are much deeper. 
The crucial question is how long and how far will Israel proceed on the course to self-destruction. 
A lot of work in AI, neural network theory, "Big Data and statistics," etc., is as you describe — mimicking behavior (which I 
don't even find amazing or particularly interesting). But I think you underestimate the theoretical insights and 
explanations, such as the few I mentioned in the papers I sent, the theories that yield explanations for such surprising 
phenomena as rigidity and structure-dependence, with their far-reaching consequences. Those I think are the kinds of 
results that are rarely found outside the hard sciences. They don't mimic behavior, but explain fundamental properties 
of cognitive processes that enter into behavior, of course indirectly. And there's a lot more like it.

I use my coin flip analogy often. ie. . single cell experiments, like looking through a microscope at my coin , measure 
its content it moment, its shape, all trying to figure out why the result after a long while is always the same -equal 
number of tails and heads. a consistent result. no algorithm , no computation . Why i am pushing you on this , is that 
i firmly believe that language needs a theory, cognitive science needs a theory, your minions and intellectual offspring 
are like bio engineers --they will be able to mimic some of the behavior, yes it is amazing but not interesting. you 
have thought long and hard and more importantly have seen what does NOT work. einsteins thought experiments led 
to truly remarkable results in physics. Im hoping that results like that can be achieved for biology

Have a good weekend. I wonder what he thinks about where the state is heading now. 
We'll probably be at the Cape, in Wellfleet, if we can make it. 
Maybe there are miracles, but I think more prosaic approaches yield rich results in domains like vision (Marr's main 
concern) and language. Like some of those I've mentioned. I don't see how to progress in other ways.

Marr, , -try, probabilty, , symmetry. entropy. it might look like computation but it is not. it might look like algorithm 
but it is not. the flip of a coin does not compute, have an algorithm or a mechanism. though it might look as if it does. it 
is not an input system, there is not mechanism drivning the heads and tails towards equal numbers. , there is not nature 
looking to see what the previous results were and computing the next result. like your ug it is more of a miracle.

I wouldn't take the term "mechanism" too literally. It refers to whatever is taking place in the brain. For some, as most 
of those in the Nowak group, it means neural nets. For Gallistel, it's processes internal to the cell. Useful to look at 
these matters in terms of Marr's three levels: computation, algorithm, mechanism.

2. i am willing to be convinced, as always 
3. my admittedly naive point is that "mechanism" ,I believe ,is the wrong concept. driven in error, by the machine -
computer analog since the early 1900s . instead think of probability , it is not a mechanism ,

Not a trivial matter. I'm not the best person to ask. I'd suggest contacting people who've really thought seriously 
about these issues, like Robert Pollin, a fine independent economist at U Mass Amherst 
2. 
Sherman's speculation is an interesting extension of recent discoveries about conservation, deep homologies, 
regulatory circuits, and other elements of what's sometimes called "the evo-devo revolution." It remains to be seen 
whether anything can be done with it. I think you underestimate the contributions of Berwick and his students, 
including Yang. 
3. 
The idea that there is a "ug" for vision, language, etc., seems to be essentially what Randy Gallistel calls "the norm 
in neuroscience," quoted in the paper on modularity that I sent you. And yes, they're certainly connected, at least at the 
level of cells, and presumably well beyond. These are live and significant research areas. These "central modules" do 
not have input or output, but they are accessed by input systems and in some cases, like language, by output systems. 
That seems a fair picture of the rough cognitive architecture. I don't follow the rest. It's true that work on human 
language uses as evidence what is available, namely performance. And much of the work unfortunately is fascinated by 
the droppings, just as in other fields. But there is some work that seeks to discover the mechanisms, as discussed in the 
papers I sent you.

in previous emails I have been referring to "shapes" as a metaphor for those structures. shapes do not have an input 
/output . a failing of the computational analogies. let me try this , a cell membrane, has a shape, it separates inner 
from outer. it is easy to see what is inside or out. the shape of the membrane is determined solely by a probability 
distribution. nothing more. The tons of works on spoken language seem in vain to try to make of the mechanism from 
a minuscule sampling of the combinatorics . silly. in the elephant and the blind man story , they are not even close to

It's true that grammars stand outside of time, a fact that many linguists and psychologists don't understand. There are 
suggestions of something like a "universal UG," though not couched in just these terms. Notably Michael Sherman's 
theory that a universal genome appeared at about the time of the Cambrian explosion, and all forms of life are minor 
variants of it.

1. dont you have any questions about money, . ? ? finance. . ? I owe you some knowledge . 
2 .to say the shape can be" decribed " by language is redundant. 
the "shape" is the metaphor for an n-dimentional object , it stands outside of time. as do grammars , but sentences do 
not, they require time. 
the shape is somewhat like a fitness landscape? contrasted with communication which also 
requires a time dimension and biololgy that needs and uses energy . I suggest the mammal Ug is a subcategory of all 
UG.s . and that as biology prefers redundancy . the other modules, ie vision are small distortions of it. 
3. during that UN period I often give a " money 101 to world leaders who have in many case. . little knowledge of a 
subject to which they give many speeches and policy directives , as they only have experinces such as that of a 
general , a politicitain, in some instancees a disk jockey, before having to run their country. I would love to consider 
some of what you thought was " fair " . with regard. allocations. if you were running the show.
