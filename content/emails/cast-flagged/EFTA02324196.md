| **Subject** | Work in 11P Hi Wanted to let you know, we are starting the project with the curtain =ivider in 11P (same as we are doing in BA), the workers are going to be =here tomorrow, and after that it might take up to 2 months until the =urtains are ready and installed (it is custom and takes a while). So =deally, it would be best to not have guests there until it is finished, =nless we have to (it won't look terrible, just unfinished). We =robably have another 4 to 6 weeks till 8A is done.
