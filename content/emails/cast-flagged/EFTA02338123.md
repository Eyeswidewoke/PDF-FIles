| **Subject** | I will take your word that you share my thick skin for criticism and share a strange pleasure in learning, even if it means having to accept that some formerly closely held beliefs might need strong correction. I have no particular knowledge re politics or history, so l will never offer an opinion. however re mathematics and or money, I feel on strong ground. That being said, thought puzzles in the paper are brilliant and insightful. the mathematical descriptions lack rigor , and the metaphors suffer from the common science limitation of trying to describe things using the engineering metaphors or the tools of the moment.ex. The human or its brain as a computer ., set theory . It was popular in the early 20th as you know to describe the body as an electric machine.. the mathematics used today in quantum show more promise , as it attempts to describe things that appear counter intuitive. or difficult to comprehend , ( your displacement conjecture) your simple X and Y, Merge, is quite naive and unfortunately incorrect. 2. from the paper you sent. ; a much more elegant way of conveying what i had failed to do re sentences and money European structuralism commonly adopted the Saussurean conception of language ( MONEY) (in the relevant sense) as a social entity; as Saussure put it, a storehouse of word images ( values ) in the brains of a collectivity of individuals founded on a "sort of contract." please note The information contained in this communication is 2 EFTA_R1_01299989 EFTA02338124 confidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may constitute inside information, and is intended only for the use of the addressee.
