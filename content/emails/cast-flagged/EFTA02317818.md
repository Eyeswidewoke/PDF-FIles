| **Subject** | Re: Meeting Hi Christian, So for Friday, there are no nonstop flights from NY to St. Thomas. The =arliest flight would be a Jet Blue out of JFK at 6am, arriving San Juan =t 10:38am, then connecting to a Cape Air flight leaving at 12:05pm, =rriving St.Thomas at 12:38pm. These 2 airlines don't have a baggage =greement, so you would have to have carry on luggage only for this =ption. Does that work for you? For the return on Sunday, there is a nonstop flight leaving at 1:40pm =rriving Newark at 5:08pm, or a nonstop leaving at 2:35pm arriving JFK =t 5:55pm. What are your thoughts and preferences for the flights?
