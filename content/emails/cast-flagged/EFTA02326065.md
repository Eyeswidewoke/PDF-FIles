The unspoken rule practiced in the geisha world of not allowing non-=ntroduced customers. A person may come as a guest of a known customer, but h= has to have a proper introduction and in effect prove himself before being=allowed access on his own. There are several reasons for this rule. One is t=at there can be a long gap between the time of a visit to a teahouse and th= time the bill is submitted. Both sides must know and trust one another tha= the bill is fair and that the payment will be made. Another reason is that=the geisha and the mother of the teahouse feel that the service they provid= is totally personalized to the guest. One cannot provide the proper level o= service to a stranger. It is probably also true that the women feel safer i= only dealing with known customers.
