A=tually, as it turns out, the Somalis have pioneered really quite vigorousl= in recent years in forming highly-
active communities-at-sea, ones that su=port extensive entrepreneurial activities great distances from the 
nearest=shore, moreover over prolonged time-intervals. 
</=> 
They've even m=de such communities pay -- sometimes remarkably 'handsomely -- so tha= they've 'naturally 
proliferated both quickly and widely!=/u> 
</=> 
With another hat=on, I've been peripherally involved in detecting the existence-&-loc=tion of — and then 
'interacting' with -- such communities, which as-=s-class have had utterly remarkable impacts on marine insurance rates 
in t=e western Indian Ocean! :):( 
</=> 
Lowell=/u> 
PS. Indeed, these d=rt-poor people have innovated remarkably swiftly — and in a highl=-effective manner! 
Why, they've even attracted significant quantit=es of international venture capital (of a non-too-savory flavor, to be 
sur=!) to enable their building-out!

In the abstract-=amp;-from a great remove, I do admire aspects of their derring-do! [=ut then I was able to find 
a number of features of the Soviet system-of-do=ng-things to likewise admire-out-loud — to the continuing fury-&-
des=air of the far-too-many USG security officers assigned to my case... :):(J 
PPS. If=you were really-&-truly entrepreneurial, you'll pull-togethe= a consortium that'd go out and lease a 
dozen war-surplus deep-sea drill=ng platforms, and deploy them in a line transecting a major marine-shippin= lane in 
the deep ocean at a 24-mile pitch, i.e., just a shade less than t=ice the internationally-recognized "exclusive control of 
offshore seas=94 margins of sovereign nations. 
</=> 
After declaring =hemselves to constitute the Sovereign Archipelago of Francis Drake (or per=aps 'Jeffrey 
Epstein'?), they=could commence to charge tolls on all of the ocean-traffic passing through=their mostly-'offshore' 
territories...which fees would likely accumula=e quickly to a tidy sum (e.g., one supporting the oh-so-swiftly build-out =f 
ever-more 'islands' of the Archipelago, their proliferation across o=her major sea-lanes, etc.). 
These tolls woul= naturally be priced at just a shade less than the total costs (fuel, time=...) of navigating around 
the Archipelago's territory. Correspondingl=, I'd recommend emplacement of the initial Archipelago across either =he 
east-or-west entryway of the Straits of Malacca... titanic 'regrets=92 are involved in avoiding the Straits in making the 
transit between the =ersian Gulf and East Asia! :) 
</=> 
Of course, the i=come derived from licensing fishing, etc. in the "exclusive economic zon=s" of 200 mile radius 
around each such island would be additional...but =hese could be employed to offset the substantial lawyers' bills, 
"Wash=ngton representation" fees, etc., etc. that would be involved in operati=g such an "instant sovereign!" J [And=

Some Libertarians tried to create these new community (with autonomou= structure, no taxation and even own 
currency) — Since islands can, unde= international law, only be claimed if they are at least 30 cm above the h=gh tide 
point, some have even attempted to build sovereign islands, like r=al-estate millionaire Michael Oliver's attempt at 
building a libertari=n city-state called the Republic of Minerva in the southern Pacific Ocean.=A0 Not sure how anyone 
could get significant autonomy.

Floating cities: PayPal billionaire pl=ns to build a whole new libertarian colony off the coast of San 
Francisco<=span> 
• 
Ocean state would have no welfare, no minimum wa=e, and few restrictions on weapons 
• 
Platforms would house 270 people and hundreds could ev=ntually join together 
PayPal-founder Peter Thiel was=so inspired by Atlas Shrugged - Ayn Rand's novel about free-market cap=talism -
that he's trying to make its title a reality. 
The Silicon =alley billionaire has funnelled $1.25million to the Seasteading Institute =an organisation that aspires 
to launch a floating colony into internationa= waters, freeing them and like-minded thinkers to live by libertarian idea=s. 
Mr Thiel rec=ntly told Details magazine: The United States Constitution had things=you could do at the 
beginning that you couldn't do later. So the quest=on is, can you go back to the beginning of things? How do you start 
over?&=39;

Life on the =cean wave: A design for one of the floating cities which Peter Thiel wants=to start constructing next 
year off the coast of San Francisco</=> 
Green land: An aerial view =f the city, complete with landcaped gardens. Mr Thiel believes many of the=islands 
could eventually be joined together 
Design for l=ving: This island even has a high-level helicopter pad. The cities would b= constructed on oil-rig like 
terminals 
The floating sovereign nations that=Mr Thiel imagines would be built on oil-rig-like platforms anchored in are=s 
free of regulation, laws, and moral conventions. 
The Seastead=ng Institute says it will 'give people the freedom to choose the gover=ment they want instead of 
being stuck with the government they get'.</=pan> 
Mr Theil, th= venture capitalist who famously helped Facebook expand beyond the Harvard=campus, called 
Seasteading an 'open frontier for experimenting with ne= ideas for government'. 
After making=his first investment in the project in 2008, Mr Thiel said: 'Decades f=om now, those looking back at 
the start of the century will understand tha= Seasteading was an obvious step towards encouraging the development of 
mo=e efficient, practical public sector models around the world. 
'We're=at a fascinating juncture: the nature of government is about to change at = very fundamental level.'

government'

M= Thiel and his colleagues say their ocean state would have no welfare, loo=er building codes, no minimum 
wage, and few restrictions on weapons. 
Aiming to ha=e tens of millions of residents by 2050, the Seasteading Institute says ar=hitectural plans for a 
prototype involve a movable, diesel-powered structu=e with room for 270 residents. 
The long-ter= plan would be to have dozens and eventually hundreds of the platforms lin=ed together.
