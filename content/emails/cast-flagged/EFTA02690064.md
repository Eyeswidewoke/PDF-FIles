When Gates took over the Pentagon in December 2006, he quickly demonstrated the diplomatic and political acumen he had acquired as he worked his way up through the intelligence community as the first career officer to become CIA director. Take, for instance, his decision to court Hillary Clinton when she took over as secretary of state in 2009. One of the few senior Bush holdovers in the new Obama administration, Gates was keenly aware of the tensions between the State and Defense departments built up during the war in Iraq. He invited Clinton to his Pentagon office, and the two

Building Boom in Gaza's Ruins Belies 
Misery That Remains 
Ethan Bronner 
June 25, 2011 -- GAZA — Two luxury hotels are opening in Gaza 
this month. Thousands of new cars are plying the roads. A second 
shopping mall — with escalators imported from Israel — will open 
next month. Hundreds of homes and two dozen schools are about to 
go up. A Hamas-run farm where Jewish settlements once stood is 
producing enough fruit that Israeli imports are tapering off. 
As pro-Palestinian activists prepare to set sail aboard a flotilla aimed 
at maintaining an international spotlight on Gaza and pressure on 
Israel, this isolated Palestinian coastal enclave is experiencing its first 
real period of economic growth since the siege they are protesting 
began in 2007. 
"Things are better than a year ago," said Jamal El-Khoudary, 
chairman of the board of the Islamic University, who has led Gaza's 
Popular Committee Against the Siege. "The siege on goods is now 60 
to 70 percent over." 
Ala al-Rafati, the economy minister for Hamas, the militant group 
that governs Gaza, said in an interview that nearly 1,000 factories are 
operating here, and he estimated unemployment at no more than 25 
percent after a sharp drop in jobless levels in the first quarter of this 
year. "Yesterday alone, the Gaza municipality launched 12 projects 
for paving roads, digging wells and making gardens," he said. 
So is that the news from Gaza in mid-2011? Yes, but so is this: 
Thousands of homes that were destroyed in the Israeli antirocket 
invasion two and a half years ago have not been rebuilt. Hospitals

have canceled elective surgery for lack of supplies. Electricity 
remains maddeningly irregular. The much-publicized opening of the 
Egyptian border has fizzled, so people remain trapped here. The 
number of residents living on less than $1.60 a day has tripled in four 
years. Three-quarters of the population rely on food aid. 
Areas with as contested a history as this one can choose among 
anniversaries to commemorate. It has been four years since Hamas 
took over, prompting Israel and Egypt to impose a blockade on 
people and most goods. It is a year since a Turkish flotilla challenged 
the siege and Israeli commandos killed nine activists aboard the 
ships, leading to international outrage and an easing of conditions. 
And it is five years since an Israeli soldier, Staff Sgt. Gilad Shalit, 
was abducted and held in captivity without even visits from the Red 
Cross. 
In assessing the condition of the 1.6 million people who live in Gaza, 
there are issues of where to draw the baseline and — often — what 
motivates the discussion. It has never been among the world's 
poorest places. There is near universal literacy and relatively low 
infant mortality, and health conditions remain better than across 
much of the developing world. 
"We have 100 percent vaccination; no polio, measles, diphtheria or 
AIDS," said Mahmoud Daher, a World Health Organization official 
here. "We've never had a cholera outbreak." 
The Israeli government and its defenders use such data to portray 
Gaza as doing just fine and Israeli policy as humane and appropriate: 
no flotillas need set sail. 
Israel's critics say the fact that the conditions in Gaza do not rival the 
problems in sub-Saharan Africa only makes the political and human 
rights crisis here all the more tragic — and solvable. Israel, they note, 
still controls access to sea, air and most land routes, and its security 
policies have consciously strangled development opportunities for an

educated and potentially high-achieving population that is trapped 
with no horizon. Pressure needs to be maintained to end the siege 
entirely, they say, and talk of improvement is counterproductive. 
The recent changes stem from a combination of Israeli policy shifts 
and the chaos in Egypt. The new Egyptian border policy has made 
little difference, but Egypt's revolution and its reduced policing in 
the Sinai have had a profound effect. 
For the past year, Israel has allowed most everything into Gaza but 
cement, steel and other construction material — other than for 
internationally supervised projects — because they are worried that 
such supplies can be used by Hamas for bunkers and bombs. A 
number of international projects are proceeding, but there is an urgent 
need for housing, street paving, schools, factories and public works 
projects, all under Hamas or the private sector, and Israel's policy 
bans access to the goods to move those forward. 
So in recent months, tunnels under the southern border that were 
used to bring in consumer goods have become almost fully devoted 
to smuggling in building materials. 
Sacks of cement and piles of gravel, Turkish in origin and bought 
legally in Egypt, are smuggled through the hundreds of tunnels in 
double shifts, day and night, totaling some 3,000 tons a day. Since 
the overthrow of President Hosni Mubarak, the Egyptian security 
authorities no longer stop the smugglers. Streets are being paved and 
buildings constructed. 
"Mubarak was crushing us before," said Mahmoud Mohammad, a 
subcontractor whose 10-man crew in Gaza City was unloading steel 
bars that were carried through the tunnels and were destined for a 
new restaurant. "Last year we were sitting at home. The contractor I 
work for has three major projects going." 
Nearby, Amer Selmi was supervising the building of a three-story, $2 
million wedding hall. Most of his materials come from the tunnels.

Karim Gharbawi is an architect and building designer with 10 
projects under way, all of them eight- and nine-story residential 
properties. He said there were some 130 engineering and design firms 
in Gaza. Two years ago, none were working. Today, he said, all of 
them are. 
Another result of the regional changes is the many new cars here. 
Israel allows in 20 a week, but that does not meet the need. Hundreds 
of BMWs, pickup trucks and other vehicles have arrived in recent 
months from Libya, driven through Egypt and sold via the 
unmonitored tunnels. Dozens of white Kia Sportage models, 
ubiquitous on the street, are widely thought to have come from the 
same dealership in Benghazi, Libya, that was looted after the uprising 
there began. 
Hamas's control of Gaza appears firmer than ever, and the looser 
tunnel patrols in Egypt mean greater access to weapons as well. But 
opinion surveys show that its more secular rival, Fatah, is more 
popular. That may explain why an attempt at political unity with 
Fatah is moving slowly: the Hamas leaders here are likely to lose 
their jobs. The hospital supply crisis is a direct result of tensions with 
Fatah in the West Bank, which has kept the supplies from being 
shipped here. 
Efforts by fringe Islamist groups to challenge Hamas have had little 
effect. And it has been a year since the government unsuccessfully 
sought to impose tighter religious restrictions by banning women 
from smoking water pipes in public. On a recent afternoon in the new 
Carino's restaurant — with billiards, enormous flat-screen 
televisions, buttery-soft chairs — women without head coverings 
were smoking freely. 
But such places and people represent a wafer-thin slice of Gazan 
society, and focusing on them distorts the broader and grimmer 
picture.

Samah Saleh is a 21-year-old medical student who lives in the 
Jabaliya refugee camp. Her father, an electrician, is adding a second 
story to their house now that material is available from the tunnels. 
Ms. Saleh will get her own room for the first time in her life, but she 
views her good fortune in context. 
"For the vast majority in Gaza, things are not improving," she said. 
"Most people in Gaza remain forgotten."

Buying Into Palestinian Statehood 
Yossi Alpher, Colette Avital, Shlomo Gazit, and Mark Heller 
June 24, 2011— Instead of wasting time and energy trying to revive a 
moribund Israeli-Palestinian peace process, the United States and 
European Union should take another look at the Palestinian initiative 
to seek U.N. recognition in September. What is described in some 
quarters as a recipe for new strife and confrontation can actually be 
leveraged into a win-win situation for Israelis, Palestinians and the 
world. 
The Palestinians under Mahmoud Abbas want the United Nations to 
grant them a sovereign state based on the 1967 boundaries with East 
Jerusalem as its capital. That's all. It is not asking the U.N. to solve 
the refugee /right-of-return issue or to determine who owns the 
Temple Mount in Jerusalem. It is opting to convert an intractable 
conflict between a state and a liberation movement into a state-to-
state conflict with manageable parameters. 
Why not offer the Palestinians what they want, but add elements that 
could render the resolution acceptable to a majority of Israelis? 
Israel wants acceptance as a Jewish state with its recognized capital in 
Jerusalem. It needs assurances regarding the nature and priorities of 
future negotiations, with the truly intractable issues postponed to a 
later pha
