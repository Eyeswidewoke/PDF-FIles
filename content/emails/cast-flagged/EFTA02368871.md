Editorial </=> 
10 February 2013 --=It seems the first foreign visit <http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4341548,00.html> of 
Barack Obama <http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/barac=-obama>'s second term will be to Israel 
chttp://www.guardian.coruk/world/israel> . In making that choice, the president sends an important signal =nd one 
that is long overdue. What is optimistically still referred to as t=e peace process has been stalled for several years. There 
is plenty of bla=e to go around for that. But a small part of it rests with Mr Obama himself. 
In his first term h= didn't visit Israel once, not even, Israelis complain, when he was in the=neighbourhood. That was a 
mistake, limiting the influence he could exert o=er Israel's government and, more importantly perhaps, its people. As Bill 
Clinton, the last US president to come close =o a Middle East breakthrough, advises today's diplomats: Israelis need to 
=now that if the tanks were ever to start rolling in from across the Jordan= you'd be there in the trenches with them. An 
unlikely scenario these days perhaps, but the emotion is rea=. 
Still, an Obama vis=t can do more than offer reassurance of US solidarity. The mere announceme=t of the trip, scheduled 
for 21 March but liable to slip if there are dela=s in the formation of a new Israeli government, can itself have an impact. 
Some have argued <http://www.al-monitor.co=/pulse/originals/2013/02/why-is-obama-in-such-a-rush-to-visit-
israel.html> that the White House published its travel plans now, e=rlier than necessary, in order to remind the parties 
to ongoing coalition =alks in Israel that peace should be a factor in their negotiations. With M= Obama coming, perhaps 
Binyamin Netanyahu and his potential partners will be obliged to think not only of =urrently dominant domestic issues 
but also of relations with their most im=ediate neighbours. If that was indeed the motive, it may be paying off. Is=ael's 
outgoing deputy foreign minister, the hawkish Danny Ayalon, now says Israel should accept the UN's recent up=rade of 
the Palestinians' status — a move he and his government fiercely=rejected last November. 
For Palestinians to=, an Obama visit should be a boost — especially if he visits the West Ba=k cities of Ramallah or, as has 
been mooted, Jericho. The message will be =hat, for all the talk of a Washington foreign policy pivot to Asia, the Middle 
East is still a US priority and t=e Palestinian issue has not been forgotten. The prestige of a presidential=visit will 
strengthen those Palestinians who advocate the path of diplomac= over the path of violence — welcome, given that 
events in recent months have tended to have the reverse effect.=/span> 
Bitter experience s=ggests no one should expect too much of a single visit, even if the speculation 
<http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,1-4342870,00.html> is right and Mr Obama chairs a mini-summit, perhaps 
in =ordan, between Mr Netanyahu and Mahmoud Abbas. But the fact that the presi=ent is coming, and that he has in 
John Kerry a new secretary of state long=engaged in the issue and bitten, says one colleague, by "the peace bug", are 
small grounds for ho=e in a region that does not have many.

Feb 10, 2013 -- In =imes of war, the law is not silent. War is not a moral wilderness: At the =econd Lateran Council in 
1139, the use of the crossbow was banned among Eu=opean knights. Throughout history, there have been codes that 
even the hell of war could not override. 
I own up to being c=nflicted about the use of drone strikes <http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-02-06/drone-war-
needs-clear-r=les-instead-of-more-leaks.html> . Those 19 young Arabs who struck the U.S. on Sept. 11, 20=1, shredded 
the old notions and rules of war, erased the line between comb=tants and noncombatants, brought soot and ruin onto 
American soil. Our cou=try had to be made ready for this new kind of war. 
We waged big milita=y campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq, but the terrorists waged a twilight w=r of their own, bereft of 
scruples and limits. There would be no treaty of=surrender we could enforce, no capital city to be subdued. Chased from 
Afghanistan, they turned up in Yemen and S=malia. They were soldiers of the catacombs, and they thrived in 
ungoverned=spaces. 
Targeted killing wa= the response <http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-01-10/bloomberg-=iew-obama-must-
come-clean-on-drones> of a great military power to the frustrations of this "asymm=trical" war. We didn't know that 
larger world of Islam from which this=war arose. We were sandbagged by regimes and rulers that feigned friendshi= 
with us as they winked at the terror that came our way. 
What was one to mak= of the New Mexico-born radical imam Anwar al-Awlaki

mastered the new means of communication. 
Awlaki's Fate 
In the strict legal=sm of things he was an American citizen, but he bore this country a deadly=animus. No tears need be 
shed for him. The strike that killed him, in Yeme= in September 2011, was a deed of just retribution. Presidential

In truth, the publi= didn't want to look too closely into the doings of our government. We l=ft it to our intelligence
