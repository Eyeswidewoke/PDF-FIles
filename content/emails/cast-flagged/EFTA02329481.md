Neither of us has lea=ned about Japanese cooking, so we would probably need to start with the bas=cs, although Jen is a chef, but she has experience only with european/ameri=an cuisine. But we do love Japanese food a lot! at least the American versi=n of it. >»» Other then food, we probably will do lot's of sightseeing, since this i= going to be our first time in Japan. I would love to get to know more abou= traditional Japanese architecture and design. We would also like to see s=mo and kabuki performance, as well as kodo and tea ceremony. So if you may h=ve suggestions on any of the above, it would be amazing.
