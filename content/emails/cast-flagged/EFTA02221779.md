qiik,STY `PUDDING IWITUTE OF 1770 
Andrew L. Farkas 
Chairman & Grand Sphin. 
Jeffrey Epstein 
9 East 71° Street 
New York, NY 10022 
Dear Jeffrey, 
As you know, I am the Chairman and "Grand Sphinx" of the Hasty Pudding Institute of 
1770, which comprises the Hasty Pudding Theatricals, the Hasty Pudding Club, and the 
Harvard Krokodiloes. For over 200 years, the Hasty Pudding Institute has cultivated 
performing arts education. It is no coincidence that the Pudding's headquarters in 
Farkas Hall, its ancestral home, is today one of the primary performing arts centers at 
Harvard University. In fact, the Hasty Pudding Institute of 1770 is one of the most 
important and well-recognized independent student organizations in the world. Today, a 
completely independently funded 501(c)3 organization (The Hasty Pudding does not 
receive one penny of funding from Harvard), the Pudding and its membership provide 
financial, technical, and artistic support for performing arts oriented, educational 
programs for the underprivileged worldwide. It is a full-fledged artistic, educational, and 
philanthropic organization, where lifelong relationships are formed, talents nurtured, 
and passions discovered. Its impact is real and measurable — as you can read in the 
pamphlet that accompanies this letter. 
However, the Pudding needs help. Funded without any financial support from Harvard, 
initiation fees, dues, ticket sales, and sponsorships do not provide sufficient revenues to 
support our various activities. This includes income needed to fund the hundreds of 
thousands of dollars donated annually by the Pudding to non-affiliated, performing arts 
oriented, educational programs for the underprivileged. Not only does the Pudding 
provide financing for these programs, but the undergraduate membership gives their 
time and talents as well, helping to cultivate a life-long culture of philanthropy within its 
membership. In order to support these programs, we need to look to donors, like you, 
for help. 
In addition to the decades-old Man and Woman of the year awards, for the past four 
years the Hasty Pudding Institute has recognized iconic industry leaders for their 
outstanding achievements and lasting impact in the performing arts. This culminates in a 
fast-paced, fun-filled, and spectacular gala in New York City: The Order of the Golden 
Sphinx. The Order of the Golden Sphinx is the highest honor bestowed by the Pudding 
and the gala serves as the main fundraiser for all of its philanthropic and most of its 
artistic activities.

On April Yd, 2017 at the Diamond Horseshoe in the Paramount Hotel in New York 
City, acclaimed director Paris Barclay will join past honorees Michael Lynton, CEO of 
Sony Entertainment; David Heyman, Producer of Gravity and the Harry Potter films; 
Clive Davis, legendary music producer and Chief Creative Officer of Sony Music; and 
Daryl Roth, ten time Tony Award-winning Broadway producer, as the 6'h Order of the 
Golden Sphinx recipient. The proud winner of two Emmy awards, Paris has directed 
over 240 episodes of television including NYPD Blue, the Wm Wing, and Glee. His recent 
projects include executive producing Sono of Anarchy, as well as executive producing and 
directing last fall's new drama, Pitch. Paris is also currently serving his second term as 
the President of the Directors Guild of America. 
I want to thank you for being a supporter of the Hasty Pudding. I hope that you will 
continue your support and join us as a "Guardian of the Sphinx" in 2017 with a 
contribution of $50,000. As a "Guardian of the Sphinx" you will have a prime table at 
the gala honoring Paris Barclay. You will also receive 12 tickets to HPT 169: Casino 
Evil in the venue of your choice, as well as recognition in our gala program and on our 
website. When you provide funding by supporting our event, all but about $250 per 
person of your contribution is tax deductible, and goes to support the Hasty Pudding's 
philanthropies and educational programs. 
Thank you for your generosity and friendship. I look forward to seeing you on April 
to celebrate our honoree and to support the Hasty Pudding and the performing arts. 
There is no other organization quite like it. Its contributions to the world of the 
performing arts are the stuff of legend. 
Very truly yours, 
Andrew Farkas 
Chairman e? Grand Sphinx
