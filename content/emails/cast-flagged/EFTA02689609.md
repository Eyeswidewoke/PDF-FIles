Article 1. 
The Weekly Standard 
The Illusion of Peace with Syria 
Elliott Abrams 
May 23, 2011 -- The news from Syria grows grimmer by the day—
more peaceful protesters killed, ten thousand arrested in the past 
week, army units shelling residential neighborhoods. 
But the Obama administration's response has not grown grimmer or 
louder. As recently as May 6, Secretary of State Clinton was still 
talking about a "reform agenda" in Syria, as if Bashar al-Assad were 
a slightly misguided bureaucrat rather than the murderer of roughly 
1,000 unarmed demonstrators. As for the president, though the White 
House has issued a couple of statements in his name, he has yet to say 
one word on camera about the bloodletting in Syria. This is not a 
small matter, for a tough statement attacking the regime's repression 
and giving the demonstrators moral support would immediately 
circulate over the Internet. American sanctions against Syria, 
meanwhile, have not named Assad, and there has been no call for him 
to step down. 
Why is the administration appearing to stick with Assad and refusing 
to call for his ouster? A key reason may be the hope that an Israeli-
Syrian peace deal can be arranged. 
From the day it came to office, the Obama administration clearly 
wanted to win an Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement. There has been 
no progress during its two years in office, mostly because the White 
House insisted on a 100 percent construction freeze in the West Bank 
settlements and Jerusalem as a precondition for negotiations. This 
was politically impossible in Israel, and also meant that Palestinian 
president Mahmoud Abbas could not come to the table lest he appear 
to be asking less from Israel than the Americans.

With negotiations frozen, the Palestinians turned to unilateral 
measures: seeking a United Nations vote admitting the State of 
Palestine to membership and getting dozens of countries to recognize 
a Palestinian state. Meanwhile, their delegitimization campaign 
against Israel continued apace, especially in Europe, where calls for 
boycotts and sanctions spread. On the pro-Israel side there was also 
consideration of unilateral measures—steps to head off the 
Palestinians diplomatically (several of which I described and 
supported in the April 11 Weekly Standard). 
Some forlorn hope may still have existed inside the administration 
that a compromise on construction could bring the Palestinians back 
to the table with the government of Israel—until the agreement 
between Hamas and Fatah was signed on April 27. This agreement, 
unless and until it collapses, makes Israeli concessions or new 
flexibility in the West Bank impossible and puts paid to the entire 
"peace process." It brings Hamas into the Palestinian Authority 
government, ending a period of several years when Palestinian 
Security Forces have cooperated with the Israel Defense Forces 
against terrorism and against Hamas in particular. It will also bring 
Hamas—next year and for the first time—into the PLO, the body 
charged with negotiating peace with Israel. Even Yasser Arafat 
resisted that development when he headed the PLO, and it seems 
obvious that Israel cannot negotiate peace with an anti-Semitic 
terrorist group bent on its destruction. 
So where can the White House turn if it wants some kind of peace 
process in the Middle East? Syria. After all, in his first term as prime 
minister, back in 1998, Benjamin Netanyahu did authorize indirect 
negotiations with Syria. And the IDF—and especially Ehud Barak, a 
former head of the IDF, Israel's defense minister, and a close adviser 
to Netanyahu—has long favored such a deal. The IDF theory was that 
if Syria made peace, so would Lebanon, and then Israel would be at

peace with all four neighboring Arab states. And it can be argued 
now that Assad may see negotiations with Israel as a way to climb 
back from the pariah status he is earning, making him at this juncture 
truly open to a new peace process. 
Such thinking, whether in Jerusalem or the White House, is foolish 
and even grotesque. There is no possibility that Assad would 
negotiate seriously and that an agreement could be attained. He is 
now clinging desperately to power, and his only true allies are Iran 
and Hezbollah. Yet Israel's (and, one hopes, our own) key 
precondition to any agreement would necessarily be a clean break in 
those relationships: an end to the Syrian alliance with Hezbollah and 
Iran. Otherwise Israel would be giving the Golan, in effect, to Iran—a 
suicidal act. No Israeli government would do it, which suggests that 
negotiations with Assad would have no purpose. 
Assad may indeed be open to commencing a negotiation as a means 
to escape international isolation, but that's all the more reason not to 
give it to him. Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's 2008 talks with Syria 
(via Turkey) allowed Syria to escape the partial isolation the United 
States had imposed on it in that decade, with zero gain for Israel. This 
is not an experiment worth repeating, for the Assad regime is today 
even more despicable than it was three years ago. 
To react to the murders now taking place all over Syria by embracing 
the Assad regime would be morally indefensible. Whether Assad can 
be overthrown soon by the people of Syria is a fair question to ask. 
Will the army stay with him, or will Sunni units rebel? Will the Sunni 
business elites turn against him? How long can the regime survive? 
We do not yet know the answers. But surely we must avoid any step 
that could help Assad, rehabilitate his regime, or undermine the 
courageous struggle of peaceful demonstrators in the streets of Syria. 
The peace agreements that Israel signed with Egypt and Jordan were 
real achievements, but there will be no such agreements with the

Palestinians or with Syria in the foreseeable future. The Palestinians 
have taken themselves out of the game for now. We cannot turn from 
them to the Syrians while Assad's troops are using howitzers and 
sniper rifles against his people. This is the time not for diplomatic 
engagement with Assad, but for diplomacy aimed at quarantining his 
regime and helping bring it down. The White House should dismiss 
any remaining dreams of a "peace process" with Syria to substitute 
for the Palestinian version and face facts: There will be no peace with 
the butcher who rules Syria today.

A democratic Arab world would welcome 
peace with Israel 
Hamid Alkifaey 
One could reasonably argue that the golden opportunity for peace in 
the Middle East was blown away when Israeli Prime Minister 
Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated on Nov. 4, 1995. 
He was the only Israeli leader capable of making peace with the 
Palestinians, and was about to do so had it not been for the bullets of 
Yigal Amir, the right-wing religious zealot who believed in the 
"winner takes all" principle. 
One could also claim that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and its 
global ramifications are responsible for agitating religious extremism 
in the Muslim world as a whole, and among Palestinians in particular. 
Prior to 1987, there was hardly any Islamic factor in Palestinian 
resistance. The Hamas and Islamic Jihad groups were established 
after the 1987 intifada. From this we deduce that extremism on the 
Israeli side led to the same on the Palestinian side, and consequently 
in other Muslim countries, which manifests in popular opposition to 
traditional and despotic regimes. 
The Arab world is currently going through a social and political 
revolution that has so far claimed two "entrenched" regimes in 
Tunisia and Egypt. At least three other regimes in the region are 
fighting for their lives, and are not expected to survive. There will 
soon be different styles of government in Libya, Yemen and Syria. 
This much is certain. 
Will there be a different policy toward Israel? Certainly. But this will 
take time to take shape, since there are more pressing national

priorities, such as political and economic reforms. Israel has long 
branded the Arab world as tribal and undemocratic, in order to brand 
itself the only democracy in the Middle East. Well, soon enough it 
won't be. Many of its neighbors will soon join the democratic world 
as demands for democracy grow. Democracy will mean more 
development, prosperity and people's power. It means more popular 
participation in decision making and awareness of the possibilities of 
the nation and what it can and cannot do. It may not mean more 
hostility toward Israel if the latter knows how to deal with it. But 
there will be tension if Israel continues to follow extreme policies, 
which it will under the current leadership of Benjamin Netanyahu. 
The Palestinians must achieve their right to establish their own state 
on their land. This right has been recognized by almost everyone 
except a minority of extremists in Israel, led by Netanyahu. Free and 
democratic Arab countries won't shrink from supporting this
