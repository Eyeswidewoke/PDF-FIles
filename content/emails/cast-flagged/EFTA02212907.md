I can not take those tables apart at this late date. They have all been approved by the people sitting at them last week. I will send Jeffrey the table seating so he can see who is coming. > I will call Lincoln Center and see if I can get two more tickets. The show will probably be doable. I don't know about the seated dinner...I will try. > Back to you asap. > xoxo Peggy > Original Message > From: > Sent: Saturday, May 6, 2017 4:09 PM > To: Peggy Siegal > Cc: Peggy Siegal > Subject: Jeffrey Epstein > • Hi Peggy.
