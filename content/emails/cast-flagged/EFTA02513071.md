I've followed the chain and understand the intent : but allowing a=broken security model that 
continues to allow nation states to exercise we=pons of mass economic distraction doesn't serve anyone. 
We can accomplish Maussian gift economies & cultures with cryptocu=rencies; while wiping out

They acquired Dr Stefan Brands (http://idtrail.org/content/view/55/43/

We all made Stefan rich (we contributed $2m but Microsoft gave him $18m= but the technology still hasn't been heard

(Kim Cameron & Brian Arborgast their identities architect's tr=ed to infuse MSFT & 
Passport/ACTIVE directory with this knowledge but =hey didn't listen) 
Anyway, hopefully we piqued their interest and we can help them learn = thing or two about 
fixing MSFT (our co founders include 2 ex Microsofties=& our investors include many more of them)
