Look forward to seeing you soon. <=lockquote type="cite">Karyna EFTA_R1_01201142 EFTA02312589 On Mar 29, 2019, at 10:03 AM, Mark Lloyd < > wrote: Dear Karyna, I h=d a call from Alex Peto earlier today, who is in receipt of the lette= from Alan Dlugash confirming that the funds held in Deutche Bank for Haze T=ust are adequately reported and fully compliant with the US tax autho=ities.
