The flooring people are going to do their work first so that the floors and baseboards are done by the time Ion and Michael begin. They are just going to do a basic painting job in each apartment, no special effects or details. All walls and the ceiling in each apartment will need to be painted. The work will include the following: Compounding the walls where there are cracks/uneven surfaces. (The walls are in relatively good condition) Applying a primer Applying 2 coats of paint Michael is also going to replace the crown molding in one of the apartments (8H). Ion has estimated that it will take them 2-3 days for the studio apartments and approximately 4 days for the 1 bedroom apartments. He says this is an estimate and he will have a better idea after doing the first apartment (He will start in 8H which is a 1 bedroom). I know the fact that it is an estimate unfortunately doesn't make calculating the cost easier. <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.O.dtd"> <plist version="1.0"> <dict> <key>date-sent</key> creal>1337643465</real> <key>flags</key> <integer>8590195713</integer> <key>original-mailbox< ke > <string>imap INBOX</string> <key>remote- < ey> <string>28821</string> <key>subject</key> <string>Scope of work for Ion and Michael</string> </dict> </plist> EFTA_R1_01187943 EFTA02308447 |
