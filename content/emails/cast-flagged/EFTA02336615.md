On the first glance, I believe it can work but it =ill require some re-designing. The 2 generators will have to work in paral=el and it will require a redesign of the switchgear on both islands. Addit=onally some other equipment, like step up transformers, will be needed for=the new scheme to work. This work is outsid= of the agreed upon scope and I will need to send you a proposal to do thi= design. This makes it a good thing that we didn&=39;t order the switchgear. I will also need to submit the new design to WA=A for approval. HH On Mon, May 15, 2017 at 7:19 AM, Hug= Hodge wrote: Good morning All, Amy =s correct. I requested additional information about the generator to deter=ine if there will be issues with it being the backup for both islands.
