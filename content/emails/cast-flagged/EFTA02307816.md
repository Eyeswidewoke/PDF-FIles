| **Subject** | Re: will give Danny a call. Do you know how much it is to reglaze the tubs? For 8H and 10F, I'd like to reglaze the tubs and install sliding glass =oors on both tubs. For 8H, I also need to replace the door jamb on the bathroom door as the =tone is very discolored. If we are going to keep 4M, the bathroom needs a complete gut and =enovation, and ideally 10N bathroom also needs a gut and total redo.

I do have =enn available and as long as we are clear upfront on the scope of work =t can be done immediately. Next week Penn will have guys available and =ould be able to start on 8H ( but again, you really need to be clear =nd have all materials prior to starting. > The glass guy is Danny at > On May 18, 2012, at 8:06 AM,nrote: » Hi Anthony, » JE would like glass shower doors put on the tub of 8H. He seems to =hink there is a door which would be mirrored on the outside, but still =e able to see through the glass from the inside of the tub. » Do you have a shower door company you use that I could speak to about =t? Also, I know you mentioned you can refinish the old tubs that are =here. Is that something easily done? Do they just spray a new =rotective coating on it? I'd like to have it done to 8H and 10F tubs >> > Anthony Barrett > Ossa Properties, Inc. > 301 East 66th St > NY NY 10065 <?xml version=.0" encoding=TF-8"?> <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/Propertylist-1.0.dtd"> <plist version=.0"> alict> <key>date-sent</key> EFTA_R1_01186655 EFTA02307816 creal>1337614959</real> <key>flags</key> <integer>8590195713</integer> <keporiginal-mai ibox</ke > <string>imap:/ ent%20Messages</string> <key>remote-id</key> <string>10875</string> <key>subject</key> <string>Re: </string> </dict> </plist> 2 EFTA_R1_01186656 EFTA02307817 |
