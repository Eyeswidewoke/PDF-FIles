| **Subject** | Mirror in 111 Hi Karyna...when Tess was cleaning the bedroom in 1LI the mirror leaning =n top of the dresser fell and shattered. I don't really know who is =aking care of matters like this anymore...! asked Sue and she says =effrey has removed her from the apartment decorating and suggested I =sk you before bothering Jeffrey with this... -Can you order a replacement? -Maybe it doesn't need to be replaced? (although a mirror on top of a =resser is standard...i would suggest all mirrors be hung on apartment =alls and not just leaned...too much risk there) If this is not something you should be addressing just let me know...
