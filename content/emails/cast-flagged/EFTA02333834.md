Subject: Fwd: Fw: Age old question 
Here are many different answers for the age old question: Why did the 
chicken cross the road? 
GEORGE W. BUSH 
We don't really care why the chicken crossed the road. 
We just want to know if the chicken is on our side of 
the road or not. The chicken is either with us or it 
is against us. There is no middle ground here. 
JACQUES CHIRAC 
The chicken has rights, mais oui? We care not whether 
the chicken crosses the road since we will claim her 
eggs regardless of on which side of the road she lays 
them. n'est pas? Should les Americains succeed in 
seizing them, we shall insist on coq au yin! 
TONY BLAIR 
It is clear to Her Majesty's govemment that the 
chicken has disguised and hidden her eggs, which, 
under extraordinary circumstances, particularly on Ai 
Hallow's E'en, can certainly be used as weapons of 
mass destruction 
COLIN POWELL 
Now at the left of the screen, you clearly see the 
satellite image of the chicken crossing the road. 
HANZ BLIX 
We have reason to believe there is a chicken, but we 
have not yet been allowed access to the other side of 
the road. 
MOHAMMED ALDOURI (Iraq ambassador) 
The chicken did not cross the road. This is a complete 
fabrication. We don't even have a chicken. 
SADDAM HUSSEIN 
This was an unprovoked act of rebellion and we were 
quite justified in dropping 50 tons of nerve gas on 
it.

RALPH NADER 
The chicken's habitat on the original side of the road 
had been polluted by unchecked industrialist greed. 
The chicken did not reach the unspoiled habitat on the 
other side of the road because it was crushed by the wheels 
of a gas-guzzling SUV. 
PAT BUCHANAN 
To steal a job from a decent. hard-working American. 
RUSH LIMBAUGH 
I don't know why the chicken crossed the road, but 
I'll bet it was getting a government grant to cross 
the road, and 
bet someone out there is already 
forming a support group to help chickens with 
crossing-the-road syndrome. Can you believe this? 
How much more of this can real Americans take? 
Chickens crossing the road paid for by their tax 
dollars, and when I say tax dollars. I'm 
talking about your money, money the government took 
from you to build roads for chickens to cross. 
MARTHA STEWART 
No one called to warn me which way that chicken was 
going. I had a standing order at the farmers market 
to sell my eggs when the price dropped to a certain 
level. No little bird gave me any insider information. 
JERRY FALWELL 
Because the chicken was gay! Isn't it obvious? Can't 
you people see the plain truth in front of your face? 
The chicken was going to the "other side." That's what 
they call it —the other side. Yes, my friends, that 
chicken is gay. And, if you eat that chicken, you will 
become gay too. I say we boycott all chickens until we 
sort out this abomination that the liberal media 
whitewashes with seemingly harmless phrases like 
"the other side? 
DR. SEUSS 
Did the chicken cross the road? 
Did he cross it with a toad? 
Yes, The chicken crossed the road, 
But why it crossed. I've not been told!

ERNEST HEMINGWAY 
To die. In the rain. Alone. 
MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. 
I envision a world where all chickens will be free to 
cross roads without having their motives called into 
question. 
GRANDPA 
In my day, we didn't ask why the chicken crossed the 
road. Someone told us that the chicken crossed the 
road, and that was good enough for us. 
BARBARA WALTERS 
Isn't that interesting? In a few moments we will be 
listening to the chicken tell, for the first time, the 
heart-warming story of how it experienced a serious case 
of molting and went on to accomplish its life-long dream of 
crossing the road. 
JOHN LENNON 
Imagine all the chickens crossing roads in peace. 
ARISTOTLE 
It is the nature of chickens to cross the road. 
KARL MARX 
It was an historical inevitability. 
VOLTAIRE 
I may not agree with what the chicken did, but I will 
defend to the death its right to do it. 
RONALD REAGAN 
What chicken? 
CAPTAIN KIRK 
To boldly go where no chicken has gone before.

FOX MULDER 
You saw it cross the road with your own eyes! How many 
more chickens have to cross before you believe it? 
SIGMUND FREUD 
The fact that you are at all concerned that the 
chicken crossed the road reveals your underlying 
sexual insecurity. 
BILL GATES 
I have just released eChicken 2003, which will not 
only cross roads, but will lay eggs, file your 
important documents, and balance your checkbook -
and Internet Explorer is an inextricable part of 
eChicken. 
ALBERT EINSTEIN 
Did the chicken really cross the road or did the road 
move beneath the chicken? 
COLONEL SANDERS 
I missed one?
