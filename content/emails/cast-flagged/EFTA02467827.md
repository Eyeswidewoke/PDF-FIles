i do think so and with a little lead-up time i can always concentrate on those areas of most interest to them 
in my Self-deception book i record with amusement Bill Gates' statement a number of years back when spam first 
appeared that it will be a thing of the past within six months—this because he could easily see how to protect from the 
then 3 spam methods but could not see that the spammers could easily and quickly overcome all three of his firewalls 
while inventing new methods—there was an initial modest decrease in spam of less than a year and then a dramatic 
increase and it has been growing ever since 
it is typical that those most devoted to the truth, Gates scientists etc are often those most naive about the power of 
deception—once deception appears it always leads in evolution with truth playing catch-up 
BTW where are you ?
