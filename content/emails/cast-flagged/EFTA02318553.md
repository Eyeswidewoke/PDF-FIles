It has a new bathroom, kitchen, wood floors have been =efinished, etc.. Do you want her to stay in 3M and let her pick out new =urniture, repaint if she wants, etc? <?xml version=.0" encoding=TF-8"?> <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"> <plist version=.0"> <dict> <key>date-sent</key> <real>1351112470</real> <key>flags</key> <integer>8623750145</integer> <key>original-mailbox</key> <string>imap: <key>remote-i <string>14181</string> <key>subject</key> <string></string> </dict> </plist> .< ey> 1 EFTA_R1_01225083 EFTA02318553 |
