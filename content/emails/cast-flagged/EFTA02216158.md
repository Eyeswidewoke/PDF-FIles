Once I have fixed my altimetric points the machine can Stan to make the road so depending how fast people on GSJ goes, I think It will be good whether I can have two days so the 21th the 22th and returns on the 23rd late afternoon just in case. If it goes well and we achieved the work faster than I thought, there is another place I would like to open up in order to have a better sight of the area. Kevin.

I shall be available to come if needed on the 21 for few days whether it's necessary. The last part of my schematic design is taking me longer than I thought, I 'm almost done, but I'll need the week still. Best regards, Kevin.

Please find attached a visual of the basket on LSG. - Bismarckia nobilis (blue latan palm) will handle much more wind) you should get rid of the coconut. - New stone wall will be nicer as all surrounded walls are well shaped. having those boulders makes it too rough today. -Alamanda flower, should get ok. Just change the one that has trouble to grow. Regarding GSJ , I'm putting everything together this week (new idea, new locations, details etc... ) and I shall send you a file at the end of the week. I'll be available in three weeks to make the first road and some path. Best regards, Kevin. <BASKET.jpeg> <Capture d'ecran 2016-03-11 i 15.51.11.png> SAS KO CONCEPT Anse des Cayes. 97133 Saint-Barthelemy <Capture d'ocran 2016-03-11 i 15.51.11.png> SAS KO CONCEPT Anse des Cayes, 97133 Saint-Barthelem EFTA_R1_00944911 EFTA02216159 <Capture d'ecran 2016-03-11 i 15.51.11.png> MS KO CONCEPT Anse des Cayes, EFTA R1_00944912 EFTA02216160 |
