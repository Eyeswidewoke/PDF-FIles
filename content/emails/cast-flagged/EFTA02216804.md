I have two questions for you: Larry has asked that Jojo bring the captains chair to you in Islip. I Want to make sure you know about this. Jojo was going to deliver this to you tomorrow morning. Question number 2: did Jeffrey want you to see his new Bentley? Did he say anything to you about this? >> >> >> >> Sent from my iPhone EFTA_R1_00946151 EFTA02216805 |
