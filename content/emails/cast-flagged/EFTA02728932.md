ALAN M. DERSHOWITZ 
1575 MASSACHUSETTS AVENUE 
CAMBRIDGE • MASSACHUSETTS • 02B8 
April 19, 2006 
Ms. Emma Belohlavek 
Assistant State Attorney 
40! North Dixie Highway 
West Palm Beach, FL 33401 
Dear Lanna: 
Guy has asked me to provide you with the research on why it makes a difference whether Mr. 
Epstein pleads "nob contendere" or "guilty". As you can see front the enclosed statute, a plea of 
"nob contendere" is not admissible as an "admission against interest" in a subsequent civil case. 
A plea of guilty — even a so-called "best interest" plea of guilty — is admissible. That is the only 
real legal difference. If you need anything further, please do not hesitate to call me or Guy. 
Sincerely, 
Enclosure: FL ST § 90.410 
09112/2019
