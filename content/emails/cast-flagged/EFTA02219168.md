The car is fabulous, and Jojo is such a love. I was so shocked to hear that Lynn died. I just saw her last summer in your office. So sad. Jeffrey kindly called to check in in the midst of our day and I appreciate you touching base to make sure all went well. I planned to go by and see you and give your shoulders some attention, but Jojo said you weren't at the house. Sorry to have missed you. I actually got out of the car for a quick meeting and let go alone with Jojo to her favorite grocery store, Fairway, and then be dropped back at the apartment. She felt like such align! All made for a very memorable day. Many thanks Lesley, On Jul 17, 2017, at 6:00 PM, Lesley Groff -c :> wrote: Hi !! Just checkisin!
