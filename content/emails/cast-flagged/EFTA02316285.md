Lyn said you would need to commute back and forth everyday from to NYC due to you having a 13 year old daughter at home. Do you kn=w how you would get back and forth? By bus, train? and how long the commut= would be for you? If you are willing to do this, it doesn't bother us. I =anted to get your thoughts on this and maybe we could try and see if it wo=ld work for you to work with us? So I have the correct inf=rmation, you and your husband both work for the currentl=?
