| **Subject** | Re: FW: The apartments still obviously have the old paint on the walls so they will have to prepare them for the new paint. I don't know what this process involves or if they simply just paint over them as they are. Then it will just be a regular paint job, obviously good quality (which I know Ion and Michael will do in any case), but no special effects or details. We will also have to paint all the doors, trim, and ceiling. am I correct? can you think of anything else?
