| **Subject** | available couple SALAZAR.ALMIRIA and ROBERTO.doc Hi there. I am sending you with this email a resume of a couple whom I have known for many years ("Marvy" and Robert Salazar). They currently are working in Washington, DC: however, they have asked me to find them positions in a warmer climate. Clearly, New Mexico and Florida, etc. fall into that category. Let me know what you think once you have the opportunity to peruse their resume. Also, I will fax it to your office just in case there is an issue with the download. I am working with the filipino butler on his immigration status. He went to the attorney yesterday and the outlook appears to be positive. He has a good bit of embassy experience and is very interested in relocating. Just in case you did not receive it, I also am faxing his resume again to your office. Please let me hear from you. Hope you are wel. Stay safe, EFTA_R1_01280632 EFTA02333848 |
