| **Subject** | Apt for Ehud's security people IF we have furniture Hi Karyna...Anthony Barrett called to let me know he has an empty, newly =enovated apartment across the hall from 111 that he could let Ehud's =ecurity people stay in if Jeffrey would like BUT there is no furniture =n it. Anthony says he would offer this apartment to Ehud's security =p for the same rate they are paying at the hotel they stay in...He =hinks it might be easier for all involve as the security pp stand in =he hall while Ehud is in residence. I would think they need minimal =urniture, but obviously they would need a bed and a TV would be nice =which would also mean Time Warner?) kitchen table and chairs...before = even ask JE about this, I wanted to find out if there is even =urniture that we could put in this apartment for them?... Please let me know what you think...(sounds like a lot of effort, but =aybe it is worth it...and even if we don't have finished by Sept 10, =hey could stay in hotel until it was decent enough for them to stay) =?xml version=.0" encoding=TF-8"?> <IDOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList- 1.0.dtd"> <plist version=.0"> <dict> <key>conversation-idgkey> <integer>14038</integer> <key>date-last-viewed</key> <integer>0</integer> <key>date-received</key> <integer>1441739691</integer> <key>flags</key> <integer>8623750405</integer> <key>remote-id</key> <string>28762</string> </dict> </plist> 1 EFTA_R1_01260568 EFTA02330082 |
