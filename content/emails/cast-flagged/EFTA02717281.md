October_, 2014 
Gates Ventures, LLC 
2365 Carillon Point 
Kirkland, WA 98033 
Re: Biosys Capital Partners, LP 
Ladies and Gentlemen: 
Reference is hereby made to the Agreement of Limited Partnership of Biosys Capital 
Partners, LP, a Delaware limited partnership (the "Partnership"), dated as of [date] (as 
amended from time to time, the "Partnership Agreement") by and among Biosys Capital 
Management, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, as the general partner (the 
"General Partner") and the Limited Partners party thereto, including, without limitation, 
Gates Ventures, LLC (the "Investor"). Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise 
defined shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Partnership Agreement. 
In 
consideration of the investment by the Investor in the Partnership, the General Partner and 
the Investor agree, upon the admission of the Investor to the Partnership as a Limited 
Partner, to the provisions set forth herein: 
1. 
Most Favored Nations. Neither the Partnership, any Parallel Fund or any 
Feeder Fund (each, a "Parallel Vehicle"), the General Partner nor any of their respective 
Affiliates has entered into, or will enter into, any side letter or similar agreement (each, a 
"Side Letter") with any existing or future investor in connection with the admission of 
such investor to the Partnership as a Limited Partner or a Parallel Vehicle as a limited 
partner (or other comparable role) before, on or after the date hereof that has the effect of 
establishing rights or otherwise benefiting such investor in any manner more favorable in 
any material respect to such investor than the rights and benefits established in favor of the 
Investor by the Partnership Agreement or pursuant to this letter agreement unless, in any 
such case and except as provided below, within 30 days of entering into such Side Letter, 
the General Partner shall offer to the Investor in writing the opportunity to receive the 
same rights and benefits granted under such Side Letters. The Investor shall notify the 
Partnership in writing, within thirty (30) days after the date it has been offered the 
opportunity to receive such rights and benefits, of its election to receive any such rights or 
benefits so offered. Notwithstanding the foregoing, duplicative Side Letter provisions are 
not required to be re-circulated to the Investor pursuant to this Section 1. The Investor 
acknowledges that it will not, solely by reason of this Section 1, (i) receive any rights or 
benefits established in favor of another Limited Partner or any limited partner or other 
investor in a Parallel Vehicle (each a "Subject Party") by reason of the fact that such 
46093276 2

EFTA02717281

Subject Party is subject to any laws, rules or regulations to which the Investor is not also 
subject; (ii) receive any rights or benefits which are personal to such Subject Party based 
solely on the place of organization or headquarters, organizational form of, or other 
particular restrictions applicable to, such Subject Party; (iii) receive any rights or benefits 
established in favor of a Subject Party with respect to such Subject Party's right to appoint 
one or more persons to the Advisory Committee (or similar body with regard to any 
Parallel Vehicle); or (iv) receive any rights or benefits granted to the General Partner, the 
Advisor, any general partner or similar functionary with regard to a Parallel Vehicle or 
their respective Affiliates, partners, members, stockholders, owners or employees. 
2. 
3. 
Further Information. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the 
Partnership Agreement or the Investor's Subscription Agreement, the General Partner 
agrees that the Investor will not be required to provide (i) any personal or financial 
information regarding its members, managers, settlors, trustees, agents, employees, other 
representatives or beneficial owners, or (ii) any of the information or documentation set 
forth in Section 6.2(b) of the Partnership Agreement, other than information that has 
previously been provided in the Investor's Subscription Agreement. 
4. 
Advisory Committee Materials: Observer Rights. The General Partner 
shall, as soon as reasonably practicable, forward to the Investor all materials provided to 
the members of the Advisory Committee if also offered to all limited partners. 
5. 
Alternative Investment Vehicles: Parallel Vehicles. The General Partner 
agrees that the Investor shall not be required to participate in any investment through any 
Alternative Investment Vehicle or Parallel Vehicle without the Investor's prior written 
consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld). If the General Partner intends to 
form an Alternative Investment Vehicle in which the General Partner will request that the 
Investor participate, the General Partner will provide the Investor with drafts of the 
governing documents of such Alternative Investment Vehicle as soon as reasonably 
practicable and in advance of the date that the Investor would become a participant in 
such Alternative Investment Vehicle. 
6. 
Application to Alternative Investment Vehicles and Parallel Vehicles. 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Partnership Agreement, the General 
Partner hereby agrees that the provisions of this letter agreement shall apply, to the extent 
relevant, to any investment holding company, Parallel Vehicle and/or Alternative 
Investment Vehicle used by the General Partner or the Partnership in relation to the 
Investments made by the Partnership. 
7. 
Opinion of the Investor's In-House Counsel. The General Partner agrees 
that, in connection with any opinion of the Investor's counsel, in-house counsel shall be 
deemed by the General Partner to be reasonably acceptable counsel for the Investor.

8. 
Transfers. Notwithstanding anything in the Partnership Agreement to the 
contrary, the General Partner hereby agrees that it shall request consent to the transfer of 
all or any portion of Investor's interest in the Partnership to any charitable organization 
designated by Investor; provided that such Transfer otherwise complies with the 
requirements of the Partnership Agreement and applicable law. Consent will not be 
unreasonably withheld. 
9. 
Representations. Warranties and Covenants. 
(a) 
The General Partner, on behalf of itself and the Partnership, 
represents, warrants and covenants to the Investor on the date hereof and at the 
time the Investor makes a Capital Contribution to the Partnership that: 
(i) 
there is no litigation, investigation or other proceeding 
pending against the Partnership, the General Partner or any of their 
Affiliates which, if adversely determined, would materially adversely affect 
the business or financial condition of the Partnership or the General Partner 
or the ability of either to perform its respective obligations under the 
Partnership Agreement or this letter agreement. The execution, delivery 
and performance of the Partnership Agreement by the General Partner does 
not violate or constitute a default or breach of any contract, indenture, 
agreement, commitment or mortgage applicable to the General Partner or 
the Partnership. 
(b) 
The General Partner, on behalf of itself and the Partnership, 
represents, warrants and covenants to the Investor on the date hereof and on the 
date that the Investor makes its first Capital Contribution to the Partnership that: 
(i) 
Assuming the Investor's due authorization, execution and 
delivery of the Subscription Agreement (1) the interest to be acquired by 
the Investor represents a duly and validly issued interest in the Partnership 
and (ii) the Investor is a Limited Partner under the Partnership Agreement 
and the laws of the State of Delaware; and 
(ii) 
There are no debts of the Partnership other than with regard 
to expenses described as Partnership Expenses, Organizational Expenses or 
Management Fees in the Partnership Agreement. 
10. 
Percentage Ownership Interest. As of the date of this letter agreement, the 
Investor has made a Capital Commitment to the Partnership in the sum of $20,000,000.

For purposes of this provision, the term "Material Regulatory
