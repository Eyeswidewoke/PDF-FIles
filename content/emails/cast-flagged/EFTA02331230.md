| **Subject** | Your apt. michael the painter is going to start in your bedroom as well today. He =aid Penn did not install baseboards in the bedroom. I'm assuming this =hould have been done as well? I just wanted to make sure you are good with Michael starting in =edroom, cause that means you won't be able to stay there when you =eturn. 10N is free until the 22nd, so you can stay there until your =pt. is done. does that sound OK?=?xml version=.0" encoding=TF-8"?> <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/Propertylist-1.0.dtd"> <plist version=.0"> <dict> <key>date-sent</key> creal>1321387875</real> <key>flags</key> <integer>8590195713</integer> <key>remote-id</key> <string>7181</string> <key>subject</key> <string>Your apt.</string> </dict> </plist> 1 EFTA_R1_01264059 EFTA02331230 |
