Trust me,...it only gets better! :) Jeffrey and his people are all fine! thank goodness...that is most important...however lots of rebuilidng is required! Palm Beach was spared for the most part...trees down and a little other stuff...but the island ...wow...that is going to be awhile. I will let Jeffrey know you are thinking about him! Ike, and I are all good. started 7th grade...he loves it! and it's football season so our house is very happy right now! Ike still coaches for team and will until 9th grade...then it moves to the high school and paid coaches.. Take care and send the pies! Lesley On Sep 11, 2017, at 10:33 AM, wrote: Hi Lesley!
