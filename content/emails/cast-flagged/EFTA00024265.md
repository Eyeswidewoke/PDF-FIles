Those active participants might very

### Match 2
> the active participants within the deceased Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking saga. Those active participants might very well be high-ranking wealthy politicians and government officials and, socialites typically associated with Hollywood and the wealthy circles throughout America and, the world. Ghislaine Maxwell's health and well-being should be extremely important to all women -young and old, in order to help ensure injustice is not a continuous practice as in the past while justice is upheld even against those who have thus far been shielded due to political power and/or wealth. Such is the reason bai

### Match 3
> g should be extremely important to all women -young and old, in order to help ensure injustice is not a continuous practice as in the past while justice is upheld even against those who have thus far been shielded due to political power and/or wealth. Such is the reason bail should be granted to Ghislaine Maxwell in order to help ensure her appearance before the Court and, before the Nation does not end prior in such an ill-manner of injustice to which befall upon Jeffrey Epstein to which many question the government's ruling of death based upon questioning any cover-up by those in positions of power. H

### Match 4
> . Having an individual alive for justice to be rendered -guilty or innocent within a Court of Law, is a far more demanding form of Law than having an individual confined behind bars -with a great risk of death for silence, until their day in court... perhaps eventually for the political elite if Ghislaine Maxwell is alive and well while finally accepting, her voice must be spoken in truth and honesty... including a forthrightness even at this point in time in order to prevent the freedom of those within political power and wealthy socialite houses to continue abusing their positions of power based upon w

### Match 5
> even at this point in time in order to prevent the freedom of those within political power and wealthy socialite houses to continue abusing their positions of power based upon wealth against young girls and, young women of all ages. Again, I petition America and, the Courts of Manhattan to grant Ghislaine Maxwell bail for the security of her voice... hopefully her forthright voice to be heard in court. Plenty of stories have been revealed around media and former contestants, Donny Trump had employees attempting to groom underage girls for him during Miss Teen USA pageants... as have Donny Trump and Billy

### Match 6
> ILOdany.nyc.gov <FOILadanymc.gov> Subject: For the Prosecutor's Office and/or US District Judge Alison Nathan... For the Prosecutor's Office and/or US District Judge Alison Nathan to deny Bail Request, denial could potentially place the weight of injustice upon all women -both young and old, if Ghislaine Maxwell becomes another Jeffrey Epstein jail statistic based upon any possibility of any high-ranking politicians/government officials around the world and wealthy socialites seeking her silence. I encourage both the Prosecutor's Office and the Court to grant Ghislaine Maxwell Bail -based upon stipulat

### Match 7
> en -both young and old, if Ghislaine Maxwell becomes another Jeffrey Epstein jail statistic based upon any possibility of any high-ranking politicians/government officials around the world and wealthy socialites seeking her silence. I encourage both the Prosecutor's Office and the Court to grant Ghislaine Maxwell Bail -based upon stipulations I have noted within previous email (included below], in order for Ghislaine Maxwell to be given the opportunity to take the stand -not only in defense of the charges filed against Ms. Maxwell, also those whom were 'protected' by the death of Jeffrey Epstein. Jails

### Match 8
> lity of any high-ranking politicians/government officials around the world and wealthy socialites seeking her silence. I encourage both the Prosecutor's Office and the Court to grant Ghislaine Maxwell Bail -based upon stipulations I have noted within previous email (included below], in order for Ghislaine Maxwell to be given the opportunity to take the stand -not only in defense of the charges filed against Ms. Maxwell, also those whom were 'protected' by the death of Jeffrey Epstein. Jails simply do not provide healthy environments for those Innocent Until Proven Guilty in a Court of Law... especially

### Match 9
> ose Innocent Until Proven Guilty in a Court of Law... especially a Court Case of such magnitude which stands possibly for any and all youth deemed 'underage' by U.S. Law. Any possibly Flight Risk can be avoided based upon Bail Agreement. Requesting Bail be granted for the health & well-being of Ghislaine Maxwell in order for Court to be upheld in Truth and Justice.
