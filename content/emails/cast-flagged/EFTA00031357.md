### Match 3
> I knew Ghislaine Maxwell for over 10 years. It was her calculating and sadistic manipulation that anaesthetized me, in order to deliver me, with full knowledge of the heinous and dehumanizing abuse that awaited me, straight to the hands of Jeffrey Epstein. Without Ghislaine, Jeffrey could not have done what he did. She was in charge. She egged him on and encouraged him. She told me of others she recruited, and she thought it was funny.

The sociopathic manner in which she nurtured our relationship, abused my trust and took advantage of my vulnerability, makes it clear to me that she would have done anything to get what she wanted, to satisfy Mr. Epstein.

EFTA00031357 I have fear speaking here today, even anonymously. However, I have chosen to implore the court not grant bond for Ms. Maxwell because I know the truth. I know what she has done, I know how many lives she has ruined and because I know this, I know she has nothing to lose, has no remorse and will never admit what she has done. Please do not let us down by allowing her the opportunity to further hurt her victims, or eva
