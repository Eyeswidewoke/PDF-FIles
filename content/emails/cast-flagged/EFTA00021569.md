### Match 1
> PM To: Christian Everdell; Mark S. Cohen Cc: Subject: RE: SDNY investigation (re: Epstein) Chris, Mark, EFTA00021569 Following up on my very brief conversation with Chris earlier this afternoon, and the voicemail you left earlier, thanks for getting in touch regarding your representation of Ms. Maxwell. I understand you'll be in our neighborhood tomorrow afternoon; we can make ourselves available to meet, but will that have been enough time for you to speak with your client? Let us know what you think would be best to proceed, and we'll figure out next steps. thanks, M Assistant U.S. Attorne
