| **To** | Jeffrey Epstein mentioned you tolcIMshe could renovate her apt at 301. She is =urrently staying in 4M which we are switching out next week for apt 3M. =M has a renovated bathroom and kitchen that Anthony did, so that's all =ice and new. The paint job is good, just an off whitish slightly cream =olor, and the floors are a brown parquet with a gloss finish which look =ike they've been recently refinished. I would defiantly replace most of =he furniture from 4M. Is that something you want to let ■choose, or =hould I take care of? <?xml version=.0" encoding=TF-8"?> <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"> <plist version=.0"> <clict> <key>date-sent</key> <real>1350492310</real> <key>flags</key> <integer>8623750145</integer> <key>original-mailbox</ke > <string>imap: <key>remote-i < cey> <string>14099</string> <key>subject</key> <string></string> </dict> </plist> 1 EFTA_R1_01224653 EFTA02318362 |
