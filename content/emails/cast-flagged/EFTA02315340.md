It looks =ike it opens from the front panel, verse from the top like the 2 in =his email. We were hoping we could use one of these as a media center =n LSJ, thus would need it to open from the front. Can you have a look =hen you're there today and see if you can find the one which opens from =he front and take the measurements of that one and also see if it can =pen with the front panel coming outwards, versus inwards like the photo =hows.
