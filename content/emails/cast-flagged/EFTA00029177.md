> ng massages for Mr. Epstein The fact that she has to spell it strongly suggests the name also didn't come up during whatever preamble the AUSA provided. But either way, that's it. As you know, she is not mentioned in the NPA and, according the lawyer at OPR who is running the NPA investigation, Maxwell does not come up much, if at all, in the documents they have reviewed in connection with that issue. There were no federal search warrants, so there would be no applications in which target subjects would be identified. There was a local search warrant, but we don't have a copy because we don't h

There was a local search warrant, but we don't have a copy because we don't have the SDFL file and we haven't asked Palm Beach county for theirs. Presumably we will get that at some point. Maxwell was added to the caption of the FBI file at some point, and she does come up in some of the 302s (including the and gl nterviews in a manner we're now familiar with).
