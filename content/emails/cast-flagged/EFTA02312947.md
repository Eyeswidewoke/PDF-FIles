| **To** | Jeffrey Dear =arc, Can you please =rovide the due diligence package details. It is very complex as you are =ware. We understand that the owner may be ill? We wonder if there is a =ay to close for say 10m plus your fee, with a delayed payment of the 15 =ntil after all has been cleaned and verified. There are four separate jurisdictions: United States, =VI, Lichtenstein, Morocco. Disclosure requirements, tax requirements, =ermits employment issues, etc. The =nly way is to guarantee no liabilities we are told is to publish , =otice. , for months , asking if there is any claim. as =here is no indemnity and it turns out there is an undisclosed =iability, either in the BVI or Parmur co. There is no redress. I =ind it hard to believe that any person would buy shares in a company =ither in the BVI or Lichtenstein with only the signature of a trustee. =hould there be a problem, a lawsuit for misrepresentation or fraud =ould take a decade or more. 1 EFTA_R1_01202094 EFTA02312947 |
