| **Subject** | Re: <no subject> Thanks. I'm booked on same out going and have a 4pm to Cali. I was speaking with Rich B today, and he mentioned he has a cousin that is living in santa Fe who just moved back there recently and doesn't have a job yet. She lived in Santa Fe before and has alot of contacts, etc there. Might be worth meeting her while we're there. I can run it by je and get her resume On Jun 19, 2012, at 7:42 PM, Richard Kahn > wrote: Changed flight info so now have a 3pm departure from ABQ and both flights from AA Flight Depart Arrive AMERICAN AIRLINES 705 New York (WA) June 21, 2012 06:05 AM Travel Time : 3 h 35 m Cabin Class : Economy Seat : unassigned Dallas/ Fort Worth (DFW) June 21, 2012 08:40 AM Booking Code : G Plane Type : S80 Choose Seats <https://www.aa.com/seatmap/selectSeatAccess.do?flightNumber=705&originAirport=LGA&destinationAirport=DFW& departureMonth=6&departureDay=21&bookingPathStateld=1340148646799- 832&afterSeatMap=reviewPay&firstAccessToPayment=true> AMERICAN AIRLINES 1691 Dallas/ Fort Worth (DFW) EFTA_R1_01194714 EFTA02310641 June 21, 2012 09:20 AM Travel Time : 1 h 40 m Cabin Class : Economy Seat : unassigned Albuquerque (ABQ) June 21, 2012 10:00 AM Booking Code : G Plane Type : S80 Choose Seats <https://www.aa.com/seatmaphelectSeatAccess.do?flightNumber=1691&originAirport=DFW&destinationAirportrABQ RalepartureMonth=6&departureDay=21&bookingPathStateld=1340148646799- 832&afterSeatMap=reviewPay&firstAccessToPayment=true> Flight Depart Arrive AMERICAN AIRLINES 3763 Operated by American Eagle Albuquerque (ABQ) June 21, 2012 03:05 PM Travel Time : 2 h 50 m Cabin Class : First Seat : unassigned Chicago (ORD) June 21, 2012 06:55 PM Booking Code : P Plane Type : CR7 Choose Seats chttps://www.aa.com/seatmap/selectSeatAccess.do?flightNumber=3763&originAirport=ABQ&destinationAirport=ORD &departureMonth=6&departureDay=21&bookingPathStateld=1340148646799- 832&afterSeatMap=reviewPay&firstAccessToPayment=true> AMERICAN AIRLINES 346 Chicago (ORD) June 21, 2012 07:55 PM Travel Time : 2 h 10 m 2 EFTA_R1_01194715 EFTA02310642 Cabin Class : First Seat : unassigned New York (LGA) June 21, 2012 11:05 PM Booking Code : P Plane Type : S80 3 EFTA_R1_01194716 EFTA02310643 |
