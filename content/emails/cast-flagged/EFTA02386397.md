DAF 
Next week I start Monday in Washington DC mostly seeing Executive branch people including the President on the 
budget and Ebola. 
I spend Tuesday in New York — the morning touring educational stuff and the afternoon with Robin Hood doing a session 
on measurement in Philanthropy. 
Then I have a dinner with a bunch of people. I can easily talk about the DAF approach at the dinner. 
Ray Dalio and Paul Tudor Jones and others will be at both events. 
Wednesday I am in Ithaca at Cornell and then Thursday in Boston before I head home.
