| **Subject** | Re: CAD for =pstein HI Brad. Rendering looks great. We can go ahead and proceed with =he order for this rug. What do I need to sign to send back to you to get =his going? Also, the color in the rendering doesn't look right, but I'm =ure that's a non issue. As long as it's the aqua color I chose from the tuft samples I sent back to you guys. Thanks..
