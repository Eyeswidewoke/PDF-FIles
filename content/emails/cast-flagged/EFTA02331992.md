| **Subject** | Jeffrey Epstein Good morning Patty... A quick question for you...not sure if your =ervices would include something like this...but it is possible Jeffrey would =ike to attend the DEF CON conference at the Rio on Saturday Aug.lst ...we are =old tickets can be purchased only with cash at the door. Tickets are available on Thurs and Fri but we have no one in Vegas to go and =urchase tickets for us (apparently, the line will be quite long FYI)...do you have =omeone on staff that does this sort of errand thing? I have not even passed =his idea by Jeffrey yet, but thought it was worth asking you ...if you do, =et me know the cost and I will pass it along to Jeffrey.
