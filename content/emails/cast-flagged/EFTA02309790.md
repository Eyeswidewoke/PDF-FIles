| **To** | The floors in 10B will be done by Monday, so I've told Michael he can =tart painting Monday. I gave him the colors and he is asking about the =oors and trims. I think the doors should be the same color as the =ails, and the trim and baseboards in white? Does that sound good?=?xml version=.0" encoding=TF-8"?> <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "- //Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/Propertylist-1.0.dtd"> <plist version=.0"> <dict> <key>date-sent</key> <real>1339682210</real> <key>flags</key> <integer>8590195713</integer> <key>original-mailbox<Ae > <string>imap <key>remote-id</key> <string>11513</string> <key>subject</key> <string></string> </dict> </plist> /Sent%20Messages</string> 1 EFTA_R1_01192865 EFTA02309790 |
