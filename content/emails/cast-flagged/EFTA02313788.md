| **Subject** | Re: </=iv> Dear Karyn=, Would you like me to speak with him? Do y=u think this is Marc being obstructive or acting on instructions from a dif=icult owner? Frankly I don't understand why they need all this info=mation. If an offer is on the table they either accept it or ask for more. O=ce a price is agreed, then it's up to the buyer to perform. Only if=the buyer fails to perform should they start to be difficult. Let me know if you want me to talk to him.

He asked for documents, offers, bank statements. A=l was sent and each time more stories why nothing delivered by them. Anyway=l've given up and will put an offer in on another house. Thank you for your help. EFTA_R1_01204495 EFTA02313788 All the best, Karyna<=span> 2 EFTA_R1_01204496 EFTA02313789 |
