This was sent to John John, Attached is the AutoCAD DWG file as requested as well as a PDF of our prior survey and an aerial view. The contours were derived via aerial mapping and, therefore, have a limited accuracy. They also do not reflect any changes in topography since Mr. Epstein's purchase of the island. Also include in the CAD file are a roadway scheme we developed at his request. (Please let me know if the architect is using Revit or Civil3D and we can provide that file as well. I would foresee the necessity of site specific topographic survey for any building design that goes beyond a conceptual stage. Sincerely, Ryan C. Wischart, PLS President BRIAN MOSELEY & ASSOCIATES, INC. 4003 Rathune Hill Road Suite #606 St. Thomas, VI 00802 EFTA_R1_00956889 EFTA02220859 |
