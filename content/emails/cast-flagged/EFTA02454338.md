Fwd: New York Post: Titan falls for Harvard babe 
I thought you might be interested in this story from the New Yor= Post. 
Billionaire real estate titan A=drew Farkas has divorced his stunning second wife, Sandi<Atrong>, and has taken 
up with a 22-year-old Harvard senior. 
Sources said megayacht lover and Gov. Andrew Cuomo c=ony Farkas, who is 56, is cavorting around the 
Hamptons with a busty senior=from his alma mater. 
Farkas is a big Harvard benefactor and is the "chairman and G=and Sphinx" of the university's Hasty Pudding 
Institute of 1=70, the famed social club that cultivates talent in the performing arts, sa=ire and comedy. There's even a 
Farkas Hall on campus. 
A source sniffed, "His new girlfriend is still at Harvard and=younger than his daughter from his first marriage. He 
has rented a house in=the North Haven area for the girlfriend, who is from Pakistan, and they are=partying it up with her 
friends." Farkas also owns the fancy Montau= Yacht Club. 
But another source insisted that the new romance didn't bloss=m at the Hasty Pudding Club, and things are 
going well despite the 34-year a=e gap. "She isn't affiliated with the club," the so=rce said. 
Farkas, the founder of real estate merchant bank Island Capital Group= divorced willowy blonde Sandi, with 
whom he has two young sons, earlier th=s year. We're told he offered Sandi — who is a playwright, s=reenwriter and 
founder of Playwrights of New York — a very generous=settlement. A third source said, "He paid her about three times 
as m=ch as he needed to. The divorce was quick and super-amicable." 
They have put their gorgeous Upper East Side townhouse on the market f=r $42.5 million. The five-story 
neoclassical limestone house on 73rd Street=measures nearly 11,000 square feet with five bedrooms, plus staff quarters 
a=d three kitchens. 
He also owns a stunning waterfront mansion in North Haven that sits o= 11 acres. Sandi recently purchased her 
own home in Sag Harbor. 
Andrew, when reached through a spokesperson, de=lined to comment, as did Sandi.
