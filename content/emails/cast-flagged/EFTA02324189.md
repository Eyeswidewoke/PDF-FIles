These are made on Sago plathe and I do have=a few pieces. They are not in great shape. However the panels are easy to=get as they still use them. It would just take time to get them here. A e=derly man called David from the village paints them. David does good work.= I will attach photos of several photos of David's panels I put in a show a=d sale in Berkeley recently. Unfortunately/fortunately they all sold. I c=uld ask David to make 30 panels. It might be better to give the measuremen=s of the area to be covered as the panels vary in size. » There is also a younger man call Nanias who does beautiful painting and l=will include a few pictures of his that he painted on cardboard. He can a=so do the panels. Nanias knows all the stories behind the paintings and ca= write them down. >> » It would take about 6 months to get the panels to the USA. They would co=t you approx $200 each depending on the freight. » I hope this is of help. » Best > <P1040475_resize.jpg> > <P1040476_resize.jpg> > <P1040477_resize.jpg> > <P1040478_resize.jpg> > <P1040479_resize.jpg> > <P1040480_resize.jpg> > <P1040481_resize.jpg> > <P1040482_resize.jpg> > <nanias 1_resize.JPG> > <nanias 2_resize.JPG> > <nanias 3_resize.JPG> > <stock panels_resize.JPG> <?xml version=.0" encoding=TF-8"?> EFTA_R1_01239814 EFTA02324189 <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/Propertylist-1.0.dtd"> <plist version=.0"> <dict> <key>flags</key> <integer>8590195713</integer> <keporiginal-mailbox</key> 10 / <ey> <string>4220</string> </dict> </plist> 2 EFTA_R1_01239815 EFTA02324190 |
