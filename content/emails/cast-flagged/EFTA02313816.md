| **Subject** | Re: The Bin Dear Marc, I am very disappointed, I have spent a great deal of time and energy, includ=ng but not limited to hiring lawyers, finding a surveyor, transmitting offe=s, bank statements and organizing my bank. This transaction should have bee= easily accomplished, i.e., purchase of an expensive property, but each tim= I ask for something I am met with more requests. I have with finality dete=mined, that I will no longer play this game, so please feel free to inform m= so- called "competitor" that I have revoked, rescinded, an= hereby void all offers previously submitted. I wish you luck. Sincerely, Karyna > On Mar 26, 2019, at 2:29 PM, Marc.Kensington wro=e: > Dear Karyna, > I understand that you want to do this survey. But, on another hand, there i= still a competitor. For several reasons, I prefer the deal with you.

I k=ow this is ridiculous due to the quality of the buyer, but it is now reques=ed by the banks. > Any comments about the documents. > Kind regards <?xml version=.0" encoding=TF-8"?> <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"> <plist version=.0"> <dict> <key>conversation-id</key> <integer>48330</integer> <key>date-last-viewed</key> <integer>0</integer> <key>date-received</key> <integer>1553627832</integer> <key>flags</key> <integer>8590195713</integer> <key>remote-id</key> <string>15510</string> </dict> </plist> EFTA_R1_01204547 EFTA02313816 |
