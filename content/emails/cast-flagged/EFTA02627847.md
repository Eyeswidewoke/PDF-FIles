HI=M, 
Unfortunately it looks likely tha= Yahoo story is going to go ahead and publish a story and we think they wil= 
likely name you. 
Up until now we have we=have given you communications advice you in the best way we can, as we woul= with 
any current or former staff number. At this point we'd sugges= you consider taking independent advice - especially 
before considering com=enting or responding to Yahoo or any other media. 
The press office is following this closely and we will keep you info=med if we have any additional information we 
can share.

Best, Jeremy
