What You Can Do to Transform Education 
When Jack Hidary told me about National Lab Day, I got chills. The 
tag line for National Lab Day is: A National Barn-Raising for Hands-
On Learning. Using the internet and social computing technologies, 
with the support of the White House and the business and scientific 
communities, National Lab Day reaches out to the education 
community, providing a tool set that brings context, community, and 
passion, and that has the potential to transform our educational 
system into a true learning community. 
How does this work exactly? 
1. Teachers, scientists, organizations, and individual volunteers 
are invited to go to: National Lab Day 
2. Then, there's an opportunity to follow the track that best 
identifies how you would like to contribute. Or, you can simply 
browse existing projects. 
As you browse, you might come across the teacher in Couer D'Alene, 
Idaho, wanting to build a working model of a river watershed. Or, the 
Levittown, New York, teacher wanting help with a project on 
Superconductivity. You might come across the teacher in Chicago, 
Illinois, working with students to design, build and test bridges, and 
seeking engineers and Department of Transportation contacts. 
Why is this one of the most important movements in education today? 
Research shows that hands-on learning is powerful and effective. In 
the well-meaning efforts to create standards in education -- context, 
creativity, and our natural inclinations to explore and play, have been 
replaced with a mountains of homework and a curriculum that may not 
effectively prepare youth for the 21st century. 
In schools, failure is stigmatized, emotionally disabling, and has 
become a label and a measure rather than part of a feedback system 
supporting iteration and exploration. The most productive scientists 
and inventors will tell you that they fail constantly, all day long. Each 
failure informs them, guides them toward a new direction, a new 
hunch, a new possibility. With hands-on learning, failure is iteration, in 
the spirit of how the most accomplished scientists work.

In the somewhat misguided efforts to "teacher proof" the educational 
system, we have lost what good teachers bring to the system: 
passion, curiosity, love of learning, and an ability to create a learning 
ecosystem in a classroom, a school and a community. Think about 
what touched you most in school. At a dinner, discussing education 
with a number of Silicon Valley CEO's, to a person, the most 
significant memories were those of passionate teachers as role 
models. 
We don't find our passions. They find us. Not through hours of 
homework and standardized tests; rather, through engagement, 
exploration and in context learning. According to Stuart Brown, MD, 
author of Play: How it Shapes the Brain, Opens the Imagination, and 
Invigorates the Soul, highly successful people have a rich play life. 
Brown further suggests that play is a "biological necessity, contributing 
to the learning of emotional control, social competency, personal 
resiliency and continuing curiosity....(many) other life benefits accrue 
largely through rich developmentally appropriate play experiences. 
An adult who has "lost" what was a playful youth and doesn't play will 
demonstrate social, emotional and cognitive narrowing, be less able to 
handle stress, and often experience a smoldering depression." 
Brown talks about the value of recalling your play history. You can 
take time to do that here. 
National Lab Day has the potential to revitalize a national learning 
community by offering an infrastructure to facilitate the spirit of play 
and exploration in our classrooms, schools and communities. 
While there have been efforts in the past to encourage hands-on 
learning, the sheer scale of the consortium gathering around National 
Lab Day gives it the potential to have a profound transformational 
impact on education and learning. Respected scientific communities 
and organizations, including: ACS, IEEE, AAAS and 100+ other 
scientific societies will be promoting this effort to their members. 
The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation 
have kicked in the capital to get the project going.

Education, the National Institutes of Health and the National Science 
Foundation. 
The National Science Teachers Association and the National 
Education Association are supporting this effort as are a growing 
number of companies, including Microsoft and Texas Instruments. 
O'Reilly and Make have contributed project guides to National Lab 
Day.
