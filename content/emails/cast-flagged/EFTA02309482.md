I have been hounding Andrew, the super intendant for an answer about us chan=ing the dishwasher for the washer/dryer unit as he seemed to have concerns a=out the plumbing. I'm waiting for an answer on that so I can schedule the a=pliances all at once. I've sent about 5 emails about it now and will keep c=lling him till I get an answer.
