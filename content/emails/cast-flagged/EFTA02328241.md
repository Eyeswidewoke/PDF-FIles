| **Subject** | Re: Question for Kevin HI Everyone, As Philipe said we did have a safe flight back, regarding the =lanter pictured it looked that those oleander have been burned by =omething... Could be salt but I will much more think about some =ort of chemical product... In that case washing them with =reshwater will then help them to get back to heath. however, the =roduct could have already penetrated roots system or leaves system and =n that case it is too late to save them. In order to get something more =olorful it could be interesting to play with leaves texture. Indeed, =ometimes it's easier to use colorful bushes ( looks picture =ttached) although there might be some other species that could work in =hat bed listed below: Costus =peciosus Cordilyne fructicosa Gardenia tahisensis I hope it helps you for =ow, but I'll keep this area in mind and think about it =recisely. Karyna, here is my contact: SAS KO CONCEPT Kevin =uvrE Anse des Cayes, 97133 Saint-Barthelem Tel mail: kevin@koconcept.fr <mailto:kevin@koconcept.fr> Best regards to all, Kevin.
