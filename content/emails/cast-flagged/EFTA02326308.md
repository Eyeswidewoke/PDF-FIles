Not only is the price =ignificantly discounted, but the only measurable difference between it =nd a new machine is that the warranty is five instead of seven =ears. I checked with customer =ervice and was told no matter where the blender is purchased the =xtended warranty (an additional 3 years for a total of 8 years) can be =dded from their website for seventy-five dollars if done within 30 days =f purchase. The serial number and a copy of the receipt are necessary. =dditionally, the original warranty can be extended anytime before it =xpires but the price is increased to one hundred and twenty dollars. I struggled with a basic blender and extractor =uicer trying to healthy green smoothies but neither would properly =iquefy tough greens, something this machine does effortlessly. I spent =lose to two hundred dollars on a juice extractor, and faithfully used =t for about a month before I finally donated it to charity. Between the =ost of the large quantities of produce needed to create a small glass =f juice, refrigerator space appropriated for storage, the waste and the =lean-up time it had to go. There is no =omparison between this machine and that one. Cleaning alone (fill the =ontainer half full with hot water and add a drop or two of dish =etergent and run for a minute, rinse and drain to dry) is effortless. =here is little waste because nothing is being extracted. The machine is =owerful enough to pulverize fruits and vegetables so by simply adding a =ittle water or ice to thin and cool the concoction the beverage is =eady. There is virtually no waste =ecause where a pound of carrots were required to produce a small glass =f juice, now one or two will do the same job.Read more =E2 5 =omments 137 people found this =elpful. Was this review helpful to you? Yes Report =buse 5.0 out of 5 =tarsYou can't go wrong with this machine, but no need to =pgrade from earlier models. By Jennifer VINE =OICE on June 27, =014 Color: Platinum Vine Customer Review of Free =roduct ( What's =his? I was very interested in trying this =odel Vitamix as I currently own an older model (the 5000) and have been =rooling over the newer features. No, there was nothing at all wrong =ith my 5000 and it still 12 EFTA_R1_01247398 EFTA02326319 worked perfectly but I really liked the newer =ontainer with the better handle grip...and the grass is always greener, =ight? The short version? If you have an older model that still works, =here really is no need to spend the money to upgrade. There are slight =ifferences between the two, but each gives you the same results. If =ou've never had a Vitamix and are tempted, you would not go wrong with =his model. THE MINOR DIFFERENCES: 50O0: Nothing happens when you plug it in. 6300: When you plug it in, = blue light comes on (see photos). 5000: The =id is a bit hard to get on. 6300: The lid style changed and it's much easier to get =n/off. 5000: The container has a =imple plastic handle. 6300: The container style has changed and it has a more =olded hand grip (see photos) which makes it easier to handle. 5000: There are two toggle switches--one to =witch from variable to high speed and one to turn the machine =n/off. 6300: There are =wo toggle switches--one for pulse and one to start/stop the machine =the machine is ON when you plug it in). 5000: When making a smoothie (juice, yogurt, protein powder, =rozen whole strawberries), I just use high speed and it works fine. 6300: When making a =moothie, there's a smoothie setting. It wasn't as powerful as the high =peed setting on the 5000 but it did get it mixed it just took a bit =anger. Overall, it's a great =achine. That said, I personally don't see the need for the specific =ettings (smoothie, frozen desserts, soup) but they don't hurt anything. ='ve also never had a need for the pulse setting, but now that I have =t, I will try it.

You will know this as this 5200 Vitamix =lender By InfoFish on June 24, =014 Color: Black Vine Customer Review of Free =roduct ( What's =his? ) Okay, I am so ready to start the war - =itamix vs Blendtec vs Ninja vs Bullet (any bullet, nutribullet, baby =ullet). NOBODY rocks a blender like Vitamix. This will be my FIFTH =itamix (and I own the nutribullets and the Ninja and I SCOFF loudly at =lendtec). Here's the story... My family owned the stainless steel =tiamix blenders - from the Danbury Fair days! YES - the early 70's back =hen there was a REVERSE and the stainless steel container had a spigot! =hen I moved, I got to take that. A year later I picked up ANOTHER =tainless steel 70's Vitamix at a church fair - for - wait for it - 50 =ents!! When I had my first baby 10 years ago, I sold both Vitamixes on =bay to generate the cash to get a brand new Vitamix 4000 series. And we =ade EVERY single serving of baby food that our two kids ate. At $1++ a =iny serving for organic food - we blended the heck out of every organic =quash, rice, banana, apple, cherry, broccoli, YOU NAME IT - we blended =t - froze it into cubes and saved THOUSANDS of dollars in baby food. =an I just tell you that my kids are still on p. 1 of their =ediatricians booklet - NEVER SICK - food was the key! 13 EFTA_R1_01247399 EFTA02326320 Anyhoo - this 5200 Vitamix Blender is a step up =rom the previous 4000 series I have. It is more powerful, quieter and =H SO COOL. Now the comparisons: Vitamix v. Ninja - Ninja is a kick-butt blender =or the price - $110 at Costco on sale - and they do have the single =erving thing going on that I have always thought that Vitamix should =NCLUDE in their blender offering (they do have that now - but it is an =dd on). BUT - the Ninja is NO VITAMIX. The true test - peanut butter. =o comparison. 90 seconds to smooth, consistent AMAZING peanutbutter in =he 5200.Read more =E2 12 =omments 110 people found this =elpful.
