With another hat on, I've been peripherally involved in detectin= the existence-&-location of — and then 'interacting'=

western Indian Ocean! =span style=lont-family:Wingdings;color:R1F497D51L

PS. Indeed, these dirt-poor people have innovated remarkab=y swiftly — and in a highly-effective manner! Why= 
they've even attracted significant quantities of international vent=re capital (of a non-too-savory flavor, to be sure!) to 
enable their build=ng-out! :) 
In the abstract-&=-from a great remove, I do admire aspects of their derring-do! =(But then I was able to find a number 
of features of the Soviet system-of-=oing-things to likewise admire-out-loud — to the continuing fury-&am=;-despair of 
the far-too-many USG security officers assigned to my case...=:):0 
If you were really-&-truly entrepreneurial, y=u'll pull-together a consortium that'd go out and lease a doze= war-surplus 
deep-sea drilling platforms, and deploy them in a line transe=ting a major marine-shipping lane in the deep ocean at a 
24-mile pitch, 
just a shade less than twice the internationally-recognized "excl=sive control of offshore seas" 
margins of sovereign nations.<=:p> 
=/p> 
After declaring themselves to cons=itute the Sovereign Archipelago of Francis Drake (or perhaps 'Jeffrey Epstein'?), they 
could com=ence to charge tolls on all of the ocean-traffic passing through their mos=ly-'offshore' territories...which fees 
would likely accumulate=quickly to a tidy sum (e.g., one supporting the oh-so-swiftly build-out of=ever-more 'islands' of 
the Archipelago, their proliferation ac=oss other major sea-lanes, etc.). 
These tolls would naturally be priced at just a shade =ess than the total costs (fuel, time,...) of navigating around the 
Archipe=ago's territory. Correspondingly, I'd recommend em=lacement of the initial Archipelago across either the east-
or-west entrywa= of the Straits of Malacca... titanic 'regrets' are involved i= avoiding the Straits in making the transit 
between the Persian Gulf and E=st Asia! * 
Of course, the income der=ved from licensing fishing, etc. in the "exclusive economic zones=21; of 200 mile radius 
around each such island would be additional...but t=ese could be employed to offset the substantial lawyers' bills, 
R=0;Washington representation" fees, etc., etc. that would be involved=in operating such an "instant sovereign!"

Floating cities: PayPal billionaire =tans to build a whole new libertarian colony off the coast of San Francisc= 
• 
Ocean state would have no w=lfare, no minimum wage, and few restrictions on weapons </=:p> 
• 
Platforms would house 270 people and hundreds could eventuall= join together 
PayPal-founder Peter Thiel was so inspired by Atlas Shru=ged - Ayn Rand's novel about free-market capitalism - that he's 
trying to =ake its title a reality. 
The Silicon Valley billionaire has funnelled $1.25millio= to the Seasteading Institute, an organisation that aspires to 
launch a fl=ating colony into international waters, freeing them and like-minded think=rs to live by libertarian ideals. 
Mr Thiel recently told Details magazine: 'The U=ited States Constitution had things you could do at the beginning that 
you=couldn't do later. So the question is, can you go back to the beginning of=things? How do you start over?' 
Life on the ocean wave: A design for one of the floating cities which=Peter Thiel wants to start constructing next year off 
the coast of San Fra=cisco 
Gr=en land: An aerial view of the city, complete with landcaped gardens. Mr T=iel believes many of the islands could 
eventually be joined together 
Design for living: This island even has a high-level helicopter pa=. The cities would be constructed on oil-rig like terminals 
<frp> 
The floating sovereign=nations that Mr Thiel imagines would be built on oil-rig-like platforms an=hored in areas free of 
regulation, laws, and moral conventions. 
The Seasteading Ins=itute says it will 'give people the freedom to choose the government they =ant instead of being 
stuck with the government they get'. 
Mr Theil, the venture cap=talist who famously helped Facebook expand beyond the Harvard campus, call=d Seasteading 
an 'open frontier for experimenting with new ideas for gover=ment'. 
A=ter making his first investment in the project in 2008, Mr Thiel said: 'De=ades from now, those looking back at the 
start of the century will underst=nd that Seasteading was an obvious step towards encouraging the developmen= of 
more efficient, practical public sector models around the world. 
'We're a= a fascinating juncture: the nature of government is about to change at a =ery fundamental level.'

'Big ideas start as weird ideas,' Mr Friedman said. 
He predicted t=at full-time settlement will follow in about seven years. 
But while some Ayn Rand a=olytes may think the idea is brilliant, it's not without its critics. 
Margaret Cra=ford, an expert on urban planning and a professor of architecture at Berke=ey, told Details: 'it's a silly idea 
without any urban-planning implicatio=s whatsoever.' 
Mr Thiel told an audience at the Seasteading Institute C=nference in 2009 that: 'There are quite a lot of people who 
think it's not=possible.
