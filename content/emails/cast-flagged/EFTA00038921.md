### Match 2

It's been a very long 3 years for us since we opened the case, but we're glad it's over. We've been getting many calls of congratulations tonight, largely from victims of Maxwell and Epstein. It's a great end to the case and closure for everyone involved. Hope for a large sentence for her to come soon. a > On Dec 29, 2021, at 19:31 wrote: Excellent job.
