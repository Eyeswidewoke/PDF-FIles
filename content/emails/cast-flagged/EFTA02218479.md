This will be a very near term opportunity. So thought it maybe of interest. EFTA_R1_00950627 EFTA02218479 See attached info. We are forming what will become the next Reliance Energy. Most of Reliance was sold to CXO late in 2016 for $1.6B. We will use the company's remaining 40k acreage and add them to a newco with the addition of the Riverstone asset(3Rock). So in total we will have 100k of acreage w 5000boe of production and midstream operations. There is also an option to increase the acreage to 137k by Fall. Total deal metrics are $1.7-1.96. With the Riverstone deal alone around $1.3-1.5B. We plan to add cash and use mezz debt. So today only in need of appx $400-600mm of equity. The plan would be to have this as a private newco with a path towards an IPO within a year. We see a 3X opp here. Similar to Reliance's past deals. Josh Fink(Larry's son) and I are leading the new group re financing and strategy. Gary McKinney and his team will be running to show. Gary will be investing $100mm into the co. Please keep in confidence. Would be great to have you involved and continue to reflect what opportunities Livermore sources, structures, and invests in.
