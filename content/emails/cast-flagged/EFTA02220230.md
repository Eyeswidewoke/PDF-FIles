All of the previous correspondence between Jeffrey's assistant, was private so am not sure they understood each other correctly if the ticket was requested by Jeffrey for Sunday. Just to avoid the inconvenience and confusion, I would like to let you know that she's aiming to go to the island on Saturday morning and come back Monday morning, if that's possible and is still awaiting for the approval. Please let me know if that's okay. <IMQ6968.JPG> Thank you, nn, 21 asr. 2017 r. a 14:09, Hi May I please have 's passport details?
