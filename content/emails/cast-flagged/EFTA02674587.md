**[FULL]:** come back. You're also going to see some executive actions, we're already beginning to see them, to make sure that people who shouldn't have access to guns have to go through a process to make it happen. So it's not only that, this meme in the press: "Why can't he be like Lyndon Johnson or like Bill Clinton?" As if all the schmoozing that Bill Clinton did got him a single Republican vote for his economic plan. And it took seven months to get the Democrats helped his health care plan, or kept him from being impeached. BILL MOYERS: Yeah, I'm not impressed when people say, well, Barack Obama's no

Norman Ornstein and Thomas Mann 
Explain Why Congress is Failing Us 
As most of you know, I am a big fan of Bill Moyers and last week on Moyers & Company, 
political scholars Norman Ornstein and Thomas Mann told Bill that Congress' failure to 
make progress on gun control last week — despite support for background checks from 
90% of the American public — is symptomatic of a legislative branch reduced to 
dysfunction, partisan ravings and obstruction.

Producer: Gina Kim. Editor: Sikay Tang. Associate Producer: Reniqua Allen. 
BILL MOYERS: Even if the threat of terrorists went away, none of those bold projects Glenn Greenwald 
described as defining American greatness would happen today. Our government is paralyzed and 
dysfunctional, and it's getting worse than ever. Just ask Norman Ornstein and Thomas Mann. as I'm 
about to do. 
For decades, these two political scientists were on the go-to list for Beltway pundits and reporters seeking 
wisdom on the curious ways of governance. But then, almost exactly a year ago to this day. they 
published an op-ed piece in The Washington Post headlined, "Let's just say it: The Republicans are the 
problem." Mann and Ornstein argued that democracy and the economy are in a crash dive, and that 
congressional gridlock was largely the fault of the Republican Party and its takeover by right wing 
radicals. What's more, they said, the mainstream media was adding to the problem by resorting to false 
equivalency," pretending that both parties were equally at fault. 
The article was based on their book, It's Even Worse than It Looks: How the American Constitutional 
System Collided with the New Politics of Extremism. A paperback edition, with a new preface and 
afterword, will be out later this year. 
Thomas Mann is the W. Averell Harriman Chair and a senior fellow in Governance Studies at the 
Brookings Institution. Norman Ornstein is resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. In their 
book, It's Even Worse than It Looks, they predicted. "If President Obama gets reelected but faces either a 
continuing divided Congress or a Congress with Republicans in charge of both houses, there is little 
reason to expect a new modus vivendi in which the president and GOP leaders are able to find 
reasonable compromises in areas like budget policy, health reform and financial regulation' 
Welcome to the both of you. 
NORMAN ORNSTEIN: Great to be with you, Bill.

THOMAS MANN: Thank you, Bill. 
BILL MOYERS: Okay, the election's come and gone and the deep dysfunction that has gripped our 
government for so many years now is still with us. What are you thinking today? 
THOMAS MANN: You know, the election was even more stunning, in a way, in its sweep than we might 
have imagined. So you would have thought things would be different. Maybe in an issue or two, like 
immigration, it will be. But if you look at the gun issue, the background check, so much of the focus has 
been on the four Democrat apostates who drifted away from their party. 
Forty-one of 45 Republicans voted no. That includes people from states that wouldn't naturally be a part 
of a big gun culture. What's the reason? It's the tribalism we described in the book that continues. If he's 
for it, we're against it. We're not going to give him a victory, even if we were for it yesterday. And I'm 
afraid that pathology is still a driving force, dramatically so in the House; a little bit less in the Senate. But 
as we saw with background checks, not quite enough. 
THOMAS MANN: Sadly, divided party government, which we have because of the Republican House, in 
a time of extreme partisan polarization, is a formula for inaction and absolutist opposition politics, not for 
problem solving. 
You know, it wasn't that long ago when you could actually get something done under divided government. 
There'd be enough members of the opposition party who want to legislate, not simply to engage in what 
we used to call the permanent campaign is now a permanent war. But that doesn't happen anymore now. 
It's Republicans are unified in their oppositions, or beholden to a "no new tax" pledge that really keeps the 
country, the Congress, and its political system from dealing honestly and seriously with the problems we 
face. 
BILL MOYERS: Well, take the gun vote again. It occurred to me that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid 
may have made a fatal blunder when he caved earlier in the year and didn't go for the end of the 
filibuster, as he could have. Do you agree with that? 
NORMAN ORNSTEIN: I have mixed feelings about that, Bill. The difficulty that Harry Reid faced was to 
do this would cause a lot of turmoil in the Senate. There are so many other ways that a minority party can 
bollix up the works. And it's worth a price, if it's going to lead to legislative outcomes. But with a 
Republican House, all those bills passed would have met a graveyard. 
BILL MOYERS: They could have still blocked it over in the... 
NORMAN ORNSTEIN: Could have still... 
BILL MOYERS: Anything that... 
NORMAN ORNSTEIN: ...blocked it. 
BILL MOYERS: ...passed in the Senate. 
NORMAN ORNSTEIN: So he went for a deal with Mitch McConnell which makes it easier, if the two 
leaders want to do something, to overcome individual rogue senators, like a Ted Cruz or a Rand Paul. 
But it didn't bank on, he didn't bank on the Republican leader basically going back to where he had been 
for the first four years of the Obama administration on nominations for judges and top administration 
officials, and on a whole host of bills, and once again raising the bar to 60 routinely. 
BILL MOYERS: You really surprised me last year, because I know how hard you both have worked to be 
bipartisan and to work with Democrats and Republicans, but you were very blunt in the way you came out 
and finally, you know.

THOMAS MANN: Yeah 
BILL MOYERS: ...named names and pointed fingers. You wrote, "The two parties are not equally to 
blame because the Republicans have become extreme both in," quoting you, "in terms of policy and 
process." And you're saying here today, a year later, that's still the case? 
THOMAS MANN: It's very much the case. Bill. We had no choice but to say it. It was in some ways, it 
was obvious if you if you look at the situation, and there is a body of scholarly research that has 
demonstrated this rightward march of the party, both among elected officials, but also rank-and-file 
Republicans. And the strongest, most extreme of those, the Tea Party people, have pulled the others 
back toward them. It's a reality, and it's not just ideological difference either. They begin with those 
differences, but then it's the strategic hyper-partisanship. what Norm referred to earlier: If Barack Obama 
is for something, we have to be against it because he's not a real American. 
NORMAN ORNSTEIN: Let me just offer a bit of a caveat here on two fronts. First, we're not saying 
Democrats are angels here. Plenty of flaws there. But I also hold out still some hope for the Senate. You 
have a number of Republicans in the Senate. and this has less to do with ideology than with focus. Are 
you there to solve problems, or are you there either to pursue a radical agenda or to gain political 
advantage? Everybody's going to look for political advantage. 
There are problem-solvers in the Senate. They are flawed ones, as we saw with the gun bill. You know, 
people like Lamar Alexander or Bob Corker, who joined with most of their colleagues. But I've talked to 
them when it comes to either reforming the nomination process, doing something in a larger fiscal sense 
that will include revenues, acting on immigration. I think you've got some opportunities here. Those 
opportunities will go to the House, and the only way they'll pass is with far more Democrats than 
Republicans. And they may not make it through. But we don't have a lost cause yet in the Senate. 
Now, the recent evidence is not great on that front. And the fundamental pathologies that we wrote about 
and talked about and we just felt an obligation that we'd built up some capital over the years. What's it for 
if you're not going to spend it now? 
BILL MOYERS: You riled the Republicans but you riled the press by talking about false equivalency. 
Their evenhanded treatment of decidedly uneven behavior on the part of the two parties, the equal 
treatment for true and false statements by advocates, equal weight to competing spin between opposing 
politicians and pundits without regard to the accuracy of either. You didn't get invited on the Sunday talk 
shows after that, did you? 
NOMAN ORNSTEIN: And still haven't been. 
THOMAS MANN: You noticed that? It's because those programs are predicated upon having spin from 
one side and then the other side. We're not the first to point out the, this artificial balance. I mean, 
reporters, good reporters do it partly out of a sense of professionalism, to be fair. To be wary of allowing 
your own personal political views to influence your writing. All of that is good. 
But now it's a safety valve. It keeps you from being charged as a partisan. It satisfies your producers, 
worried about advertising. And frankly, it's become really quite pernicious. We point out example after 
example in the book where they treat clearly unequal behavior as equivalent. 
NORMAN ORNSTEIN: You know it's not even that we weren't invited on the Sunday shows, it's the radio 
silence on the topic. So you mention 'The Washington Post" piece that appeared at right at the time that 
the book was published. And it just exploded on the scene, frankly; partly because of the title. which was 
"Let's Just Say It: Republicans Are the Problem". 
You know, within less than 24 hours a
