| **Subject** | Aspen! Darling! Lovely to talk to you - and thank you for sharing your dear friends with me. I hope you are having a lovely time on the island - you lucky thing! Meanwhile it is pretty tropical here in London - 20 degrees here today - beautifully sunny - and I am off to Aspen next week - don't suppose you know any wonderful people there? I know a few and am so excited about skiing in the States for the first time! When are you heading back over here? I can't believe I was so sniffly when I saw you - that was about the trough of my cold! I said to Sarah - nothing else would have enticed me out but I so didn't want to miss you on one of your rare visits. I had taken the day off work that day as I was feeling so awful but I was so happy to see you. Hope all is well with you all - please send my love to Jeffrey - hope to see you again soon - on better form!! Loads of love, xxxxxx EFTA_R1_01280314 EFTA02333642 |
