We are going to try and do lunch tues or wed as he is going to make it town for the dinner tues. We were fretting over our women troubles. I told him I was working on brenda and that we would maybe go out later since dinner is early and be he is bringing the brit to je's, he was going to help get me out of trouble with a late drink. We figured you would come as well, maybe a late night burgerfest again </blockquote></html> EFTA_R1_01282409 EFTA02335262 |
