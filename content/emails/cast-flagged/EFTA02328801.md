| **Subject** | guy from last night Next Steps: I am so happy I m=t you. Best part of it was, I walked out of your house thinking OOPS! I brought a college level game to the Olympics and got my ass handed to me. I am motivated now. You are definitely the guy I need to come back and=20 see when I can set up a falsifiable experiment that passes the Olympics test. If I can convince you, you will get the medical establishment to pay attention. I am starting my clinic in India in a couple of weeks, with a partner who is an M.D in Pharmacology with a strong bullshit meter that usually is the preserve of epistemologists. =C2 please note The information contained in t=is communication is confidential, may be attorney-client privileged, ma= constitute inside information, and is intended only for the use of =he addressee.
