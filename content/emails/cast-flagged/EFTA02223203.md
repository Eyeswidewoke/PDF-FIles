This is just nuts. I'm getting on a private charter today to PR. I'm on a flight at 6:30 AM tomorrow to MIA and then to NYC. If all goes as planned, I'll be in the city by about 4PM tomorrow afternoon. > Thank you for making the apartment ready early and I'm so sorry about the ever shifting plans. Please let me know if it's 78 and please remind me of the code (1020, I think). > • With warm regards, > • Cecile > • Sent from my iPhone and misspellings courtesy of iPhone. > On Sep 18, 2017, at 7:37 AM, wrote: > Morning!
