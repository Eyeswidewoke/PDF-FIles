> still are not fixed. It is now over five weeks since the August 21 discovery deadline set by the court and the government still has not met its discovery obligations. That is simply not acceptable. In our previous letter, dated September 21, 2020, we outlined for you the numerous problems that Ms. Maxwell had been having with unreadable discovery files since she first began receiving the government's productions in the MDC in August 2020. This was a continuation of the same problem we identified for you in our letter, dated August 27, 2020, when we requested a new set of the discovery materials t

### Match 5
> scuss these issues. On that call, you stated that you were trying to address the readability problems, but that in the meantime, defense counsel could, among other things, create a laptop computer with a full copy of the discovery saved locally that defense counsel could bring to the MDC so that Ms. Maxwell could use it to review the unreadable discovery. You also notified us that there were approximately 40,000 non- nude photographs and images, and thousands of nude or partially nude images, which had been seized from Jeffrey Epstein's residences in New York and the Virgin Islands pursuant to searc

> warrants, and which you had referenced in your August 21, 2020 production cover letter. You further advised that you were in the process of scanning those images so that you could produce any documents not marked Highly Confidential in electronic format. Finally, in response to our request that Ms. Maxwell be given access to the Highly Confidential documents "at the earliest EFTA00013222 October 1, Page 2 possible convenience," you explained that due to COVID-19 restrictions, the U.S. Marshals are not producing pretrial detainees to proffer rooms to review discovery and therefore an FBI agent w

> ments "at the earliest EFTA00013222 October 1, Page 2 possible convenience," you explained that due to COVID-19 restrictions, the U.S. Marshals are not producing pretrial detainees to proffer rooms to review discovery and therefore an FBI agent would have to bring the materials to the MDC for Ms. Maxwell and defense counsel to review, but did not propose a date when that could happen.' On September 29, 2020, we had another conference call to further discuss the discovery. We advised you that while we planned to create a laptop that we could use to review discovery with Ms. Maxwell, it was the g

We advised you that while we planned to create a laptop that we could use to review discovery with Ms. Maxwell, it was the government's burden, not the defense's burden, to ensure that Ms. Maxwell had a complete, readable copy of the discovery. Moreover, this did not solve the problem, as the laptop could only be used during counsel visits and Ms. Maxwell needed a complete set of the discovery in the MDC

Moreover, this did not solve the problem, as the laptop could only be used during counsel visits and Ms. Maxwell needed a complete set of the discovery in the MDC that she could review on her own when defense counsel was not visiting. We further notified you that we did not believe that making the thousands of images seized from Epstein's residences available for inspection at the FBI's offices satisfied

### Match 10
> MDC that she could review on her own when defense counsel was not visiting. We further notified you that we did not believe that making the thousands of images seized from Epstein's residences available for inspection at the FBI's offices satisfied the government's discovery obligations because Ms. Maxwell could not be produced to the FBI's offices to review them. You responded that defense counsel could make a request to have the FBI deliver those images to Ms. Maxwell in the MDC. In fact, we had made such a request in our September 22, 2020 letter, when we asked to schedule a time for Ms. Maxwel
