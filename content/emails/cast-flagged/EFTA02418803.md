Rachel Uchitel Is Not a Madam 
And the bottle girls who work at clubs are not prostitutes. As Tiger Woods's very public escapades 
through the 21st-century courtesan economy suggest, it's all much more complicated than that.

The sexiest part of an affair is where it begins. 
You know what the middle looks like, hotel-sheeted and ultimately routine, and you know the way it will 
end, but where and how it began is always a little surprising. 
Historically, powerful men with slavering appetites have mainly acquired their girlfriends the way a pair 
of pants gathers lintrather incidentally. Bill Clinton and his intern. JFK and his secretaries, his 
stewardess. Collecting a mistress in this way seems, as everything does in the past, more 
innocent. An abundant young woman wears a daring dress to the office party, and catches the 
president's eye. 
At the other end of the infidelity spectrum, there is the escort, the call girl. From Charlie Sheen to Eliot 
Spitzer, famous men since the dawn of arousal have valued the sex professional. She is discreet 
and it is a transaction and there is the added benefit of selection. The office intern might have 
caught your eye, but if you'd had it your way, you might have requested her trimmer around 
the center. 
Within the unblushing batch of Tiger Woods's alleged mistresses, about whom we now know nearly 
every freckled detail, there exist both extremes: ladies of convenience, like Mindy Lawton, the 
waitress who served Woods and his wife breakfast at a diner near their home, and high-priced 
call girls like Loredana Jolie Ferriolo, who had to Google the player to find out who he was. 
Both methods of slaking the hunger have their pros and cons. Men like to hunt, and there is no need to 
hunt a prostitute. Men like to cheat without strings, and you can't stop a civilian from falling in 
love. But Woods found a way to enjoy the best of both worlds in one type of woman, a Venn 
diagram of sexual satisfaction. Most of his mistresses lived in a nebulous in-between world. Not 
prostitutes, no, but just about halfway there. As surely as he has changed the game of golf, so 
too has Woods exposed the grazing ground of the halfway-hooker, and her natural habitat, the 
nightclub.

He met at least nine of the fifteen women in or around nightclubs: Kalika Moquin was a marketing 
manager at the Bank in Las Vegas, which is also where he met onetime cocktail waitress and full-
time clubgoer Jamie Jungers. He met Julie Postle when she was a cocktail waitress in Orlando. 
Cod Rist at a nightclub in Manhattan. Holly Sampson met him through a mutual friend who is 
also a club promoter. These are not cases of eyes locking across a crowded dance floor. That's 
not the way someone like Tiger Woods goes out. Instead, special introductions are made. Girls 
are brought into his orbit by nightclub managers and directors of marketing and promoters and 
waitresses and owners. They are selected and then delivered. 
The most famous of Woods's alleged mistresses is Rachel Uchitel, who occupies a position of power in 
this strobe network of girls and money and celebrity. As VIP concierge and director of VIP 
hospitality at Tao in Vegas and at Dune in Southampton and at the Griffin, Marquee, Stanton 
Social, and Pink Elephant in Manhattan, she was the ambassador of client desire. 
Her job was born out of the culture of bottle service. The concept of paying for a whole bottle of alcohol 
and sitting at a table originated in Europe and grew a tail in the States in the early nineties, at 
New York clubs Life and Chaos. But it didn't stick until 2001, when bottle service became the 
new way of gaining entry into a world that had previously not been for sale. You no longer had 
to be an Andy Warhol descendant to party at a place like Bungalow 8; you could be Joe Banker 
or Joe Banker's son with his father's credit card. And the staffers changed, too. Cocktail 
waitresses evolved from out-of-work actresses into Penthouse Petlevel creatures who sparred 
with their co-workers for client gratuities by expanding their breadth of service. Their take-
home pay skyrocketed from $300 a night to $3,000 banner shifts. With the volume of VIP clients 
growing and the number of tables quadrupling, the need for organization spawned the creation 
of the VIP host, someone who could be trusted with the biggest clients. 
In Las Vegas, at the Bank, Woods's club of choice, a host would meet him at the door and walk him to his 
table on the second or third floor. From his perch high above the dance floor and flanked by 
superstar friends like Michael Jordan, Woods could look over the balcony and say, Oh, that 
table of pretty girls there, bring them up. The nightclub has become a smorgasbord. All you 
have to do is point and ask. 
Next: Rachel, how does it feel to be a home-wrecker?

This world was splayed open when Woods crashed his SUV last Thanksgiving weekend. And it does not 
close because Tiger Woods has (for now) left it, returning to public life this week to play in the 
Masters, a chastened man. There are still rich VIPs in the premium corners of clubs from New 
York to Miami to Las Vegas, being introduced to girls who are not Woods's girls but who are 
exactly like most of Woods's girls. In most cases, there is an exchange, gifts or help for 
sexthough with celebrities, what the girls receive is often just the privilege of being with a 
storied name. The Woods scandal has upset the rhythm of this world, upping the stakes and 
rattling the locals. But you can't keep wealthy men and pretty girls apart for long. 
Rachel Uchitel is long and skinny and buoyantly breasted. Her lips are a fat heart. On television and on 
the Internet, she is the aviatored one moving serenely through airports as camera-headed men 
coo, Rachel, how does it feel to be a home-wrecker? Rachel?

She has not gone out since the National Enquirer broke the story about her alleged affair with Woods. 
That Thanksgiving weekend, there were 50 people with cameras banging on the windows of her 
Manhattan brownstone. She's since been staying in Las Vegas, in the condo she owns at 
Turnberry Place, where the security is state-of-the-art. 
This new persona is the opposite of who I am, she says. I was alone every night. My life was my work. 
But people took my job and made it a scandalous, negative thing. 
Before nightlife, Uchitel was a segment producer at Bloomberg News and engaged to a man who died in 
the 9/11 attacks. In 2005, she drove across the country to Las Vegas, not knowing what she was 
going to do. Before she'd even arrived, a friend got her a hosting gig at Tao. 
When you lose your whole future, she says, it's something that changes you. 
On one of the online memorial guest books for her deceased fiancé, several people have lately written 
in, consoling his parents that the woman their son loved is not the same Rachel Uchitel in the 
mediashe doesn't even look like the same person. They're talking about an AP shot from 
Bellevue Hospital in the days following 9/11. In the picture, she is crying and blonde and 
holding his image. Comparing it with recent pictures, one can't help but notice a Jessica Rabbit 
effect. 
I have big breasts, she says, yes. But I'm really offended by the notion that I used my sexuality. 
It's a cool Las Vegas night in March at the new tapas place in the Aria hotel. Uchitel is wearing an orange 
cardigan and black leather pants, her thin legs balancing on top of high heels with some girlish 
platform to them. She's picking at her tuna tartare but mainly she is out of cigarettes. She bums 
a few from the waiter and stands outside the place, a giraffe on stilts. She's 35 years old, too old 
for being a VIP host anymore, she says. 
People say, Oh, Rachel, she's such a starfucker,' that I hang out with only celebs. No. I hang out with 
successful people. I hang out with people who matter, andshe says the next in the way an 
assistant might speak about a boss she deeply admiresl'm honored to. 
A source in the business estimates that she made more than any other VIP host. At my best, Uchitel says, 
I made $250,000 base, plus a guaranteed $250,000 from the tip pool. Half a million a year, paid 
by a single clubprobably Tao, though Uchitel will not confirm it. (She also says she has never 
been kept on retainer or paid by a client directly.) This does not include the extracurricular 
trips, on yachts in Saint-Tropez and to Monte Carlo. What she did on those trips, she says, was 
protect her clients and get them what they needed. 
But she really hates the accusation that she set up sex for any of her clients. She is not a pimp or a 
madam, she says. It's not our job to get anybody laid. 
What the hosts do is more like placement. They are puzzle-doe
