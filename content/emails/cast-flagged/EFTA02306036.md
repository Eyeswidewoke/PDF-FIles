| **Subject** | 2G Hi Leo, Sophie, the guest who was staying in 2G, came by yesterday. She said =hey found the sheets, but there was no duvet. Luckily Sonam had an =xtra one and we gave it to her. To avoid this happening in the future, if you are asked to set up an air =attress and have extra bedding for it, that means you need a full set, =hich is: top and bottom sheets, duvet and duvet cover, pillows and =illowcases. Think of it as setting up a separate bed. Please confirm. Thank you.=?xml version=.0" encoding=TF-8"?> <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"> <plist version=.0"> alict> <key>conversation-idgkey> <integer>36518</integer> <key>date-last-viewed</key> <integer>04integer> <key>date-receivedgkey> <integer>1523676957c/integer> <key>flagsgkey> <integer>8623750145</integer> <key>remote-ick/key> <string>13269</string> </dict> </plist> EFTA_R1_01181222 EFTA02306036 |
