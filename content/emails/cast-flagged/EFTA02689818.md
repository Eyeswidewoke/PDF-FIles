President Assad's Bloody Hands 
Editorial 
June 3, 2011 -- Syrians have shown extraordinary courage, standing 
up to President Bashar al-Assad's reign of terror. We wish we could 
say that about the international community. So long as Mr. Assad 
escapes strong condemnation and real punishment, he will keep 
turning his tanks and troops on his people. 
Human rights groups believe that more than 1,000 protesters have 
been killed in a three-month crackdown and that 10,000 more have 
been arrested. Hamza Ali al-Khateeb, the 13-year-old boy whose 
tortured body was shown in an online video, has become a 
heartbreaking symbol of the regime's brutality. According to 
activists, he was arrested at a protest on April 29 and not seen again 
until his broken body was delivered to his family almost a month 
later. 
His murder and that of at least 30 other children who joined the 
protests show the depths to which Mr. Assad and his thugs have 
sunk. 
On Friday, in some of the biggest demonstrations yet, thousands of 
people again returned to the streets to demand political freedoms. 
Activists said dozens of protesters were killed in Hama after troops 
and regime loyalists opened fire. Independent journalists are barred 
from the country, so the full extent of the violence is unclear. What 
we do know is that the Syrian government has unleashed a wave of 
repression, perhaps the most vicious counterattack of the Arab spring. 
After the killing began, the United States and Europe imposed 
sanctions — mostly travel bans and asset freezes — on certain key 
regime officials while exempting Mr. Assad. Only later did they add

his name to the list. The rhetoric is stiffening. On Thursday Secretary 
of State Hillary Rodham Clinton declared that Mr. Assad's legitimacy 
is "if not gone, nearly run out." But some American and European 
officials still buy the fantasy that Mr. Assad could yet implement 
reforms. 
Most appalling, the United Nations Security Council is unable to 
muster the votes to condemn the bloodshed much less impose 
sanctions. Russia, cynically protecting longstanding ties with 
Damascus, is blocking meaningful action and China has fallen in 
lockstep. India is also reluctant to act — a shameful stance for a 
democracy that has been bidding for a permanent seat on the Council. 
If Russia and China, which have veto power, can't be won over, the 
United States and Europe must push a robust sanctions resolution and 
dare Moscow and the others to side with Mr. Assad over the Syrian 
people. 
We do not know how this will turn out. But arguments that Mr. 
Assad is the best guarantor of stability and the best way to avoid 
extremism have lost all credibility.

The Washington Post 
Egypt's revolutionary justice 
Editorial 
June 4 -- LET'S STIPULATE: There are very likely good grounds to 
prosecute deposed Egyptian ruler Hosni Mubarak. In nearly 30 years 
in power, the strongman appears to have amassed a considerable 
fortune, including the luxurious beach estate to which he retreated 
after his overthrow. More than 800 people were killed during the 18-
day revolution, and prosectors allege that Mr. Mubarak approved 
plans to use force against peaceful demonstrators. 
The decision by Egypt's ruling military council and state prosecutors 
to begin a trial of the former strongman on Aug. 3 — before the 
country holds its first democratic elections — is nevertheless a 
mistake, one that could push Egypt off the path to establishing a 
stable democracy and reviving its economy. Mr. Mubarak, who is 83 
and in failing health, is not entitled to impunity; nor are his family 
and former ministers. But the approach of the interim regime, which 
has jailed dozens of former officials and two of Mr. Mubarak's sons, 
is deeply flawed. The trouble starts with the speed and timing of the 
prosecutions. Anxious to prevent further mass protests, the interim 
military council has appeared to time steps against the former regime 
just ahead of threatened demonstrations. The announcement that Mr. 
Mubarak would be put on trial came May 24, three days ahead of a 
planned opposition gathering in Cairo's Tahrir Square. Three of Mr. 
Mubarak's former ministers have already been convicted of crimes, 
and other trials are moving forward quickly. There are serious 
questions about the evidence in at least one — a case brought against 
the energy minister and five associates over alleged fraud in gas sales 
to Israel. The legal system handling these cases, oddly, is that of Mr.

Mubarak — and was justly renowned under his tenure for its lack of 
independence and its politicized rulings. There's good reason for 
concern that former members of the regime are now victims of that 
politicization. The judge hearing a murder case against former 
interior minister Habib el-Adly, for example, was involved in one-
sided rulings against political dissidents during Mr. Mubarak's reign. 
That's particularly worrisome because Mr. Adly has become the 
focus of populist calls for retribution, with some opposition 
sloganeers demanding that he be hanged. 
Egypt cannot bury a half century of authoritarianism; there must be a 
reckoning. But the right authority to oversee it is not a temporary 
military authority attempting to keep crowds out of the streets, but a 
democratically elected government. Investigations and trials must be 
conducted by prosecutors and judges who are neutral, professional 
and untainted by the previous regime. One leading Egyptian human 
rights activist, Hossam Bahgat, has suggested that Egypt follow the 
example of other countries emerging from dictatorship and establish a 
formal process of investigation and exposure of past crimes — a 
process that could include reparations for victims and prosecution of 
the most significant cases. Such an initiative could help to bolster a 
new democratic order in Egypt, but the rush to judgment now 
underway could seriously undermine it.

Egypt: In search of a foreign policy 
Mohamed Anis Salem 
2 - 8 June 2011 -- Sooner or later, the question of reviewing Egypt's 
foreign policy was going to crop up. In the early days of Tahrir, 
observers noted that the uprising did not occupy itself with 
international affairs. When Israel voiced concerns about the future of 
its relations with Cairo, Egypt's Higher Council of the Armed Forces 
(HCAF) reaffirmed the country's commitment to all international 
agreements, inter alia the Egyptian- Israeli Peace Treaty. Later, 
criticism of the two Egyptian governments formed after the 
revolution (one led by Ahmed Shafik, the next by Essam Sharaf) 
focussed, amongst other things, on retaining a number of the ancien 
regime ministers in office, including foreign minister Ahmed Abul-
Gheit. Abul-Gheit had irritated his critics -- some would say the 
general public as well -- by his statements on the Egyptian uprising, 
as well as his earlier positions on Palestinians crossing over from 
Gaza into Egypt, Hamas and Iran. His replacement, Nabil El-Arabi, a 
seasoned diplomat with legal expertise, positioned himself as part of 
Egypt's new outlook to the world. He signalled that relations with 
Iran would be upgraded, Gaza's Rafah Crossings would be opened, 
and relations with Israel would be managed on a tit-for-tat basis. If 
the peace treaty with Israel required revision, there were clauses that 
allowed for that. Egypt would join the Rome Statute (the legal basis 
of the International Criminal Court) and other human rights 
instruments. The Iranian aspect did not rest there. While Tehran 
responded positively, several Arab countries in the Gulf, already in 
bitter confrontation with Iran over Bahrain, felt that the new 
minister's timing was off. In Cairo, experts supported an opening with

Iran, as it would allow Egyptian diplomacy to exercise more 
influence over issues like the Arab-Israeli conflict, Lebanon, Gulf 
security and establishing a regional nuclear free zone. But, at the 
same time, several voices expressed concern at the style of handling 
this issue. It seemed that no prior coordination or consultation was 
undertaken with Gulf countries. Why now? Was this a response to 
discreet Gulf suggestions that ex-president Hosni Mubarak should be 
treated more leniently? In a hastily arranged Gulf trip, Prime Minister 
Sharaf reassured his hosts that "Gulf security was a red line for 
Egypt" and that the opening with Tehran would not be at the expense 
of relations with Gulf Arabs. But these reassurances seemed to have 
limited effect as the Gulf Cooperation Council moved to expand its 
membership to include Jordan and Morocco. The new regional order 
aligned Arab royal regimes in a cluster that left out countries 
experiencing uprisings (Egypt, Libya, Syria, Tunisia and Yemen) or 
facing instability (Iraq, Somalia and Sudan) or extreme poverty 
(Djibouti and Mauritania) -- hardly a winning hand. 
Enter the Palestinian issue. The previous year had not ended well for 
the Palestinians. While Israel continued with its settlement policy, the 
mediation efforts of the US a
