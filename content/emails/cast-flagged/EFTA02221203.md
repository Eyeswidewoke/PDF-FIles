Well, I asked Jeffrey and all he came back with was: Black I looked at the Prada website and found the below I personally think is nice: https://store.orada.cornienlpradausiwomaniwoman-bags/IBG041- 2BBE-F0002-V-NOM What do you think? I sent it to him, but he did not respond...As long as you get a gift receipt she could always exchange it...but if it were me, I would love to receive this tote...I believe they have this at Bloomingdales and Prada at 841 Madison Ave...
