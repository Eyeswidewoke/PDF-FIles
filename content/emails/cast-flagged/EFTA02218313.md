Would another day next week work better and could you go around with James to each apartment? Perhaps keep Tues for you and then a different day for Karyna and MI? Or if doesn't go to ranch we can have her do another day. Here is what I need: if you don't go to ranch what day next week would you have an hour or so to spend with james in yours and Karyna's apt? if leaves next week what other day besides Tues would work for you to spend an hour or so with James in and Karyna's apartments? Thanks. Lesley Sent from my iPhone On Aug 10, 2017, at 12:04 PM, Hi Lesley, B sc. > wrote: I can't either. I might be at the runch as well but if not I have to attend to the External Relations meeting at IPI from 10am4pm. If it is not a rush, I would suggest to do it later this month as it seems no one is here this coming week.
