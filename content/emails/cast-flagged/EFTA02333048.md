Mach 1.6 twinjet that it said could enter service by 2011. pushing aside assumptions by established business aircraft manufacturers that its not yet economically and technically feasible to launch a supersonic business jet (SSBJ). The company, led by business aviation veteran Brian Barents. believes the key elements to making the project a success are its efficient wing design and its powerplant selection— a pair of Pratt & Whitney JTSD-219 engines, which currently power one-third of the world's airliners. Aerion is engaged in advanced development and has completed flight testing of a supersonic natural laminar flow (NLF) wing section (four years ago aboard a NASA jet fighter). Leading the startup company's venture group funding development is billionaire Robert Bass. Dr. Richard Tracy. Aerion's chief technology officer, is an aerodynamicist whose extensive research on supersonic NLF led to the present wing concept that he patented in 1994. The airplane will be fuel efficient at cruise speeds just below the speed of sound, according to Aerion, allowing it to perform short- and long-haul overland missions with the same economies as today's large business jets. A maximum range of 4,000 nm is roughly the same at both subsonic and supersonic speeds. Because of these attributes. the Aerion project won't hinge on whether the FAA can be persuaded to change FAR 91.187, which now prevents supersonic flight over the continental U.S. Over the next year and a half the company will have discussions with major airframe manufacturers and first-tier suppliers to establish risk-sharing partnerships for the 90,000-pound-mtow airplane. Estimated price is under $80 million. Tomorrow, another startup company is scheduled to reveal its SSBJ program. Delivery Forecast Sees Blues Skies Ahead Honeywell Aerospace's 13th annual business aviation outlook released yesterday projects increasing demand for new business jets, with customers expecting to purchase more than 8,300 jets valued at more than $131 billion from 2004 through 2014. Improved order rates, established new model backlogs, continuing expansion in fractional ownership in North America and Europe and sustained economic recovery are key factors supporting a longer-term outlook for growth, said Honeywell. After a record peak in 2001 when business jet manufacturers shipped 750 aircraft, deliveries declined more than 30 percent over the next two years and reached a low of 506 last year. First-half deliveries of 238 turbofan aircraft this year represented a 2.6-percent increase over levels recorded in the first half of last year. Honeywell expects operators to take delivery of approximately 525 to 550 new traditional business jets this year, compared with 506 a year ago. and increasing to more than 650 in 2005. Deliveries in 2006 are expected to be in the range of 650 to 700 jets. A look back on how the annual Honeywell business jet outlooks correlate actual delivery numbers indicates a remarkable level of accuracy—within about plus or minus 2 percent over the history of the survey. Learjet 40XR to Enter Service in 2006 Bombardier announced today at NBAA the Learjet 40XR, an enhanced performance version of the Model 40 that is scheduled to enter service in 2006. The new version of the Learjet 40 series will have improved hot-and-high performance, faster time-to-climb speeds and reduced flight time en-route. For example. according to Bombardier, taking off from Jackson Hole, Wyo., at 28 degrees C, carrying six passengers and with full fuel, the Learjet 40XR will be able to fly an additional 936 nm compared with the Learjet 40. The new aircraft will also require just 23 minutes to reach FL430 after takeoff from a hot and high airfield, the company said. These improvements will be enabled by powering the Learjet 40XR with the TFE731-20-BR, the same turbofan that has been in service on the Learjet 45XR light business jet since Junc. Bombardier said the Learjet 40XR will cost $400,000 more than a comparably equipped Learjet 40, which will remain in production. Meanwhile, Bombardier reported that the Learjet 45 family has demonstrated its ability to perform the steep descent angle required for approval to fly into London City Airport. The London City approval came as Bombardier delivered its 250th 1.earjet 45. Higher-performance Avanti H in Flight Test Piaggio Aero Industries will introduce next year a higher-performance version of its Avanti twin-turboprop pusher. The $5.97 million Avanti 11 will offer enhanced avionics, speed, payload and cabin comfort over the current model, which it will supercede. The cockpit will include the Rockwell Collins Pro Line 21 avionics suite featuring three 8- by 10-inch EFTA_R1_01279415 EFTA02333049 FMS 3000 flight management system and Ails 3000 attitude heading reference system. Maximum operating speed will be Mach 0.70. In 2006 the Avanti will start being delivered with an upgraded Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6 engine. The Avanti II will also have increased zero fuel weight (9,500 pounds to 9,800 pounds) and mtow (11,550 pounds to 12,050 pounds), and reduced empty weight. These improvements will increase useful load by one or two passengers. Piaggio said. Passengers will also enjoy updated cabin amenities, including a remodeled lavatory and an optional in-flight entertainment system. Some Avanti II enhancements will eventually be made available for retrofit on the existing fleet. according to Piaggio. Eclipse Commits To Moving Up VIJ Delivery Dates Eclipse Aviation, which says it is on schedule to receive certification and to start deliveries of the Eclipse 500 twin- engine very light jet in March 2006, is promising to accelerate production to the degree that this will move 99 percent of current orders [said to be 2.1261 forward, and move delivery positions for new aircraft orders forward seven months, from September 2008 to February 2008. Although planned certification is still more than 17 months away. Eclipse said it will deliver 260 aircraft in the first 12 months of production, 880 aircraft over the second 12 months and up to four aircraft per day thereafter. Also at the NBAA Convention this week. Eclipse disclosed details of its service and support program. The company plans to have a network of seven factory-direct service centers in the U.S., the first two opening in 2006 and located at the company headquarters in Albuquerque. N.M., and at Gainesville. Ha. By 2008 Eclipse anticipates having a factory service center within 1.5 hours' flying time for virtually all customers in the continental U.S. AIN Alerts welcomes your opinion.
