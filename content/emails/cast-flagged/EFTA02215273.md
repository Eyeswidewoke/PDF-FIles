| **Subject** | Alarm going off at 120 Oak Fri 6/2/2017 2:44:30 PM Scott!! Donald opened a window to work and the alarm is going off. Can Celmi go turn it off? It will not go off I don't think until the code is put in. I called new Canaan alarm and they do not show the alarm going off so I don't think police will be dispatched (?). This being said, you may need to check why the central station is not getting the alarm notice? Do you still have a land line? You will need to call them and figure out. I have Gloriana our housekeeper on the way to 120 Oak to see if she can help. I am in NY city today so can't help out. New Canaan Alarm Sent from my iPhone EFTA_R1_00943123 EFTA02215273 |
