I have attached another link to the dropbox file titled EFTA_R1_01217184 EFTA02316757 specify on the quote that this is the case? It doesn't read that way to me. Also, do you think 2 extra inches in each side is enough to properly stretch the canvas? I think it may need more extra considering it's size. Can we go up to 4" extra blank material all the way around? Thank you very much! https://dl.dropbox.com/u/72701817/5PalmsFINAL.jpg On Oct 22, 2012, at 8:34 AM, Bill Duerr < <mailto > wrote: <http://www.hatterascpc.com/images/Quoteletter/Quote_Ittr_hdr.jpg> Kensiington Attn: • Dear Thank you for this opportunity to submit the following quotation: Project Name: Stretch Canvas Description: 74" x 90" Print on Artist Canvas Estimate #: 126623 Flat Size: 74" x 90" Finished Size: 74" x 90" Number of Pages: 1 Epson Qty: Proof on Job Stock Digital Blueprint Qty: Additional Proof: Bleeds: Yes Stock: UltraFlex UltraCanvas c325 - comes in Rolls of 98" x 164" Inks: Full Color Bindery/Finishing: Trim to Size Packaging: Conveniently Shipping: FOB Hatteras Quantity Pricing (1) Proof on Canvas (10 x 12) $715.
