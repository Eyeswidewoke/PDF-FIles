i spoke with Andrew Linsey, Anna and Will =rom Code Advisors as Hosain was unavailable last week 
only=5,000,000 of investment would be covered as this can only apply to =referred shares 
our investment in Series 5 was as follows: 
Preferred 695,301 x =.19113 = 5,000,000 
Common 1,260,233 x 3.96792 = =,000,000 
EFTA_R1_01307150 
EFTA02341470

I =as told on call that valuation of company at time of Series 5 was =,650,000 post 
Series 6, 7, 8 and Blackrock =ote have further diluted our investment and although they would not =ive me an 
exact figure our new breakeven without Series 8 participation =ppears to be 3,250,000 
With Series 8 investment of 833,000 i believe believe we =ould receive the following on a sale of company post 
April 28 =016 
1,000,000 7,500,000 from preferred and 0 =rom common (0 received without Series 8) 
2,000,000 =nbsp; =/span>7,500,000 from preferred and 0 from common (0 received without =eries 8) 
3,000,000 7,500,000 =rom preferred and 0 from common (0 received without Series 8) 
3,250,000 7,500,000 from preferred and =,000,000 from common (10,000,000 received without Series 8) 
it appears Series 8 =rotection provides protection from 1,000,000 to 3,250,000 on =iquidation 
April 28 2016 is key date as it is 1 year anniversary of =lackrock investment and if company sold before that date 
they have a 3x =iquidation preference 
As of last friday they have raised 33,000,000 =f the 35,000,000 needed for Blackrock to release final =0,000,000 
If that is achieved they =ould have raised since April 28 2015: 
220,000,000 Blackrock original =ote 
40,000,000 Series 8 JPM (34) and Sequia =6) 
50,000,000 Blackrock =dditional 
35,000,000 Series 8 (33mm raised =0 date) 
50,000,000 =nbsp; Blackrock final 
395,000,000 =nbsp;Total raised 
As of Sep 11, 2015 there =ash flow was as follows: 
30,000,000 in cash 
85,000,000 (Series 8 and final Blackrock) 
115,000,000 potential cash 
Once 85,000,000 is secured they will =inalize deal for an ABL credit line in the amount of 50,000,000 that =ill be 
collateralized by AR and Inventory 
They mentioned that 44 would be cash =low positive however they did not elaborate on what their loss for 
2015 =r 2016 would be.. 
When i pressed them and said i =hought they would would be out of money by mid 2016 and we again may be 
=urther diluted with a Series 9 or 10 they responded that they had new =anagement that would not allow this 
They said Jason Child, new CFO, has =lready run analysis to ensure that they remain cash flow positive in =016 
Not sure that is so realistic as they also =entioned that Fitbit already has market share and that they will not 
=hase market share via lower pricing or marketing 
In =ddition they will not build large inventories with vendors if they need =o conserve cash 
Andrew stated that Hosain made =oor non financially focused decisions and new CFO will not allow that =oving 
forward 
Jawbone believes it will be =he leader in the next phase which will evolve from basic wellness to =ealth and 
medical (blood pressure, respiration and oxidation) 
2 
EFTA_R1_01307151 
EFTA02341471

Analogy was used that basic wellness market is similar to =martphones in the early 2000's and Symbian who was 
leader =isappeared 
My concerns are as follows: 
a) Jawbone =s always one step behind and they keep jumping to the next Hot =dea.. 
b) There will inevitably be a Series 9 / 10 =ound as i believe they will again run out of cash middle of next year 
=ausing further dilution to Series 8 they are asking us to participate =n 
Andrew also sent email with codes for free UP 2 or UP 3 =roduct 
I will order and have for you on your next =isit (do you have a color preference - black, silver, indigo and =ed?)

Please advise how you =ant to proceed with Series 8 proposed investment of 833,000 
Thank you
