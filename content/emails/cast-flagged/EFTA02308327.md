Started working on the manuals and side duty sheets for the house first draft should be done by monday/tues.... These manuals will be able to carry over to all the houses with small changes for each house. They include- stock items to have in fridge and dry storage, daily routines such as morning muffin and coffee(with specifics on flatware and what to put with the place settings, as well as recipes etc..), basic steps of service when guests are eating and things like this. I purchased a printer today to print out menus for dinners as well as menus for JE to review and check off things that interest him so we can continue to dial in his palate and more of what he enjoys... Today I am getting account with the local butcher that Steve recommends, hopefully we can finally get some veal that JE likes. I'm working on getting a Costco card today so we can start purchasing things in bulk. We can have up to 6 cards per account so other people can use as well, like Lyn who does the buying and stocking for 71st. I also believe there is a Costco in west palm beach as well. Things like dry food items( flour, sugar, salt, soda, water) as well as cleaning products and paper goods we can buy in bulk here in NY and maybe even ship to island and save a bunch of money. Right now all the cleaning products for 71st are coming from the supermarket... We have a quote on the ice machine and I will call around to a few people today and see if they can beat the price. I still have a good amount of things to do here in NY i will keep you posted on. Thank you Francis Francis J. Derb EFTA_R1_01187629 EFTA02308327 2 EFTA_R1_01187630 EFTA02308328 |
