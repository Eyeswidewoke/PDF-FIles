| **Subject** | update on 10F Karyna- I met with Andrew yesterday as no work had been done on Monday 2/S as he =ad promised. He told me that he had found out that the guys had been =cheduled for vacation time, so he confirmed they would be back in apt =oday but this morning he texted me to say they wont be back in until =onday 2/11 - I will go there again on Monday and hopefully they can =inish up, I think there is about 3 - 4 days work left. Honestly I have =ever worked in a building that has such a poor response to getting work =one.
