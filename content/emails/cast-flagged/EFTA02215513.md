I will be in Europe all of July and might be back in NY a bit early august; that's the closest date I think I will be there I'm afraid. Has he planned a trip to Europe this summer? As we could meet around here if he wants? Best, Jude EFTA_R1_00943641 EFTA02215515 On Jun 15 2017 at 9:52 PM, wrote: Hello Jude...hope you are well.
