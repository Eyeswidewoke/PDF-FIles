RE: 
Jeffrey, 
I plan to continue to consult with Morgan Lewis as counsel for the foundation. You are of course, free to use whoever 
you want as your counsel. I am interested in talking with JPM and Paul Weiss to get their perspectives and insights from 
the conversations you have had with them to date. Please provide me with their contact information. Also, Bill said 
there is a memo that was prepared by counsel that you shared with him during your meeting in June that he expected 
we would have read. Larry doesn't have a copy, so it would be helpful if you could send me a copy. Thanks, 
Connie R. Collingsworth

connie, while the morgan lewis people seemed nice, I think it late in the process to bring them up to speed. Bill and I 
made changes to liras chart on June 3rd.. I suggest tax expert at JPM new york, securities expertise at Paul weiss. 
The woman in charge of NPT has thought through some of these issues, but again not at scale which has its own 
complications. I like you am confident that we can navigate through, Id greatly prefer to use people with who I can 
speak shorthand.. As I told Larry I m considering using Cathy Ruemmler to be the point legal person on this coast. 
Someone will have to coordinate with the counsels of the various donors who will have many questions I m sure.
