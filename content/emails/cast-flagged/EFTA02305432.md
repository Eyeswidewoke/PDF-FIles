(Is there a big difference between the stainless steel and aluminum for the grill? I just want to make sure the aluminum will still be a good quality for this application) I would also like to go with the option with 4 panels and 4 drawers. For the desk counter top, I've ordered some samples of caesar stone to see which color will best match my desktop material. I will let you know what I'd like to do there as soon as I get the samples. come back and measure again, etc? wrote: In the meantime, I'd like to go ahead with the radiator cover.
