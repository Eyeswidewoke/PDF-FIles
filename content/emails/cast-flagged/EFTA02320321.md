| **Subject** | Jeffrey Epstein Hi Vlad, Jeffrey has me researching the best Russian visa for us to get. He wants one=that is valid for more than a month. I spoke to an agency in NY, and they t=ld me the best visa to get would be a business visa which is good for one y=ar. They say it will take 2 weeks to get an invitation, then 3 days process=ng time at the consulate once we have the invite. I have given this info to=Jeffrey, and he told me to "ask you". Does this info seem right? Perhaps th=re is a quicker way to get the invitation for a business visa? Any insight/=nput you may have would be much appreciated.
