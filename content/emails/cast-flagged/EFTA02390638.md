Theme=1: USD Extends Drop - Aug 1st 
Products 
• 
The week started =ith mild risk-off tone on North Korea headlines, but market quickly =hrugged off the concerns 
with risk rallied across the board. Political =ncertainty in Washington continues to drive the USD weakness with the =UR 
benefiting most, decoupling from rates and yields differentials 
• 
Sentiment on EUR =s still positive with narratives focused on good EMU economic prints, =eeper reform 
momentum and fiscal integration 
• 
It is worth =oting that position for USD short remains crowded (see latest =SFX =osition Tracker) and there is still 
potential risk of position =riven adjustment 
(i) 
&nb=p; 2-month EURUSD 1.2000 / 1.2200 call spread =0.40% of EUR notional 
4.1x =ay-out ratio 
(ii) 
&nb=p; 2-month EURUSD 1.2000 call with RKO at 1.24 5/0.21% of EUR notional 
Vanilla offered at 0.78% 
(iii) 
2-month USDJPY 109.00 put with RKO at =05.50 a/0.17% of USD notional 
Vanilla offered at =.00% 
&nb=p; 
= 
Ref: EURUSD 1.1800, USDJPY =10.52 
Theme 2: CHF Under =potlight — Aug 1st 
Products 
• 
CHF has been under spotlight after =ordan's comments on plan of balance sheet expansion. EURCHF =ent 3.5% 
higher and option pricing gets very bid with 1-month =mplied vol moved from 4.5 to 7.5 in short order and risk reversals 
=lipping to favor EURCHF calls for the first time since =014. 
The liquidity in CHF options has =een extremely limited in recent years as market makers have less =apability to 
warehouse risk and investors tend to avoid selling =ptionality in EURCHF. Given the wide spread, structures with 
=imited/neutral vega exposure looks appealing 
(i) 
&nb=p; 3-month EURCHF 1.1550 / 1.19001x2 ratio call =pread / 0.33% of EUR notional 
8.9x max pay-out ratio when spot expires =t 1.1900 
(ii) 
&nb=p; 3-month EURCHF 1.1550 / 1.1850 / 1.2150 lx2xl =all fly a/ 0.37% of EUR notional

6.8x =ax pay-out ratio when spot expires at 1.1850 
&nb=p; 
= 
Ref: EURCHF 1.1405 
Theme=3: EM FX Holds Well - Aug 1st 
Products 
EM assets =ontinued the rally as core government bond yields remain soft. MS =esearch believes the rally could 
extend further (link), noting that Inflows into EM fixed income =unds remain strong registering the 26th consecutive 
week of =nflows 
(i) 
&nb=p; Long 3-month USDMXN 17.50 put, short 18.81 =all a/ Zero cost 
&nb=p; 1-year USDTRY 3.50 put, RKO at 3.30 a/0.13% USD notional 
Vanilla offered at =.06% 
&nb=p; 
= 
Ref: USDMXN 17.77, =SDTRY 3.5225 
Other Option =deas* 
(i) 
&nb=p; Long CNH vs. SGD 
Idea from our Asian HE =ales: SGD has outperformed most Asian currencies over the past month on =he broad-based 
USD selloff, but with SNEER getting to elevated levels =n its trading band, the time to fade could be nigh. RMB on the 
other =and remains - 2% weaker against the CFETS basket compared to the start =f the year, while policy makers would 
likely welcome more strength. To =xpress the idea, investor could short SGD / long CNH 6mth forward or =uy USDCNH 
put spread vs. selling USDSGD put spread to play the China =atch-up story while SGD gains will likely be stifled by policy 
=onstraint 
(ii) 
&nb=p; EUR Tail Risk Hedge 
With short USD position =ecoming crowded and ECB tapering getting priced in, probably it is time =ooking at Euro zone 
tail risk hedge ideas to prepare for the upcoming =he Italian election. Current low vol low skew environment is in favor 
=f outright optionality. Long forward volatility via FVA is also a good =lternative to take advantage of the flat curve
