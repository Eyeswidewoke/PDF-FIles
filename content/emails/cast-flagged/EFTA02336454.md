| **Subject** | Questions for you Jeffrey The following questions have arisen from FO meeting today A. Art Partnership (1) Based on Heather and Rich J's meeting with Leon last Thursday, we believe there are issues of control, at least as far as Leon is concerned. If that is an issue, it raises question as to finalization of partnership documents (2) Use of Phaidon name - is this still a consideration? If so, to what extent? For the partnership itself? B. Note to APO1 agreement - as Ada has previously mentioned, the August 15, 2013 Note still lists the 2006 Trust as the Noteholder. I believe she is looking for guidance on how to proceed - whether to restate the Noteholder or other direction. C. FTLOA - further to my memo, time is of greater concern as deadlines approach next month D. Ada has mentioned that the trustees are calling her with questions and she is not sure to what extent you want her to assist them. Such questions include (1) Guidance/assistance on trustee liability insurance (2) Assistance with Crummey Letter (3) Assistance on split dollar life insurance Larry Delson International, Inc. P.O.
