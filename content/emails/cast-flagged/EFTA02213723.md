Got in very late - had a midnight dinner at UVA down the street and going to Friars for lunch and then the THREE HOUR Hamilton. When you coming back? Leaving Weds but possibly Thursday if they can fit us on the Skechers corporate jet. I see why you can't fly commercial now. I'm spoiled after ONE trip. Would love you to meet Dominique.
