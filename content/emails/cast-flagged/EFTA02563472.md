Hi Richard, 
You are right, but in the meantime Selana owes us some money and got a nega=ive balance on her statement 
for the following : Visa processing fee, Test=with photographer, Website fee, courrier, comcards, appt rent.</=> 
<=div> 
I will have the 20% fee reverse to her account and will have that amo=nt applied the negative balance owes to 
MC2 and if any balance due to S=lana, I will have a check cut to her.
