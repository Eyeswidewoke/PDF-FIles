> andy instead. Our hope is to get this to Judge Gorenstein this afternoon and swear it out tomorrow. Whichever of you will be the affiant, would you please call me with any corrections/edits to the affidavit? You'll see there's one question in there from Ted about whether we've seen any photos of Maxwell on the discs seized from the NY residence that I'm hoping you can help me answer. Thanks, Assistant United States Attorney Southern District of New York 1 St. Andrew's Plaza New York. NY 10007 EFTA00020232
