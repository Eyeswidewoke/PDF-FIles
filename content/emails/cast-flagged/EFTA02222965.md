In addition, we receive compensation from suppliers when customers use the American Express Card or other American Express products to pay for supplier products and services. From time to time we may enter into other business relationships with suppliers and these arrangements, including levels and types of compensation and incentives we receive, are subject to change. In identifying suppliers and recommending itineraries, we may consider a number of factors, including supplier availability and your preferences. The relationships we have with suppliers may also influence the suppliers we identify and the itineraries we recommend. California State Seller of Travel Registration Number: 1022318.
