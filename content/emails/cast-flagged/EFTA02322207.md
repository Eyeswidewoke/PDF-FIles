Can you please let me know what method of shipping you will be using and send a tracking number when you have it? Thank you!

They do have 2 other peices that are unharmed, the only issue is that one peice is 16.7 yards and the other peice is 13.12 yards. Can you please advise if there is a way you would like your peices to be (i.e. 10 yards from one peice and 7 yards from the other) or if there is a better way you would like it to be broken down. Sorry for this inconvenience. Best, Brandon Quattrone Christopher Hyland, Inc. 212.688.6121 <mailto <mailto EFTA_R1_01233815 EFTA02322207 |
