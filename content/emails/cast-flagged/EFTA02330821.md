All (more information) 2 EFTA_R1_01263128 EFTA02330822 If you will be visiting an area of Cote d'Ivoire with =alaria, you will need to discuss with your doctor the best ways for you =o avoid getting sick with malaria. Ways to prevent malaria include the =ollowing: • Taking a prescription =ntimalarial drug • Using =nsect repellent and wearing long pants and sleeves to prevent mosquito =ites ▪ Sleeping =n air-conditioned or well-screened rooms or using bednets All of the following antimalarial drugs are equal options for =reventing malaria in Cote d'Ivoire:Atovaquone-proguanil, doxycycline, or mefloquine. For =etailed information about each of these drugs, see Table =-11: Drugs used in the prophylaxis of malaria. For information that =an help you and your doctor decide which of these drugs would be best =or you, please see Choosing a Drug to Prevent Malaria. Note: Chloroquine is NOT =n effective antimalarial drug in Cote d'Ivoire and should not be =aken to prevent malaria in this region. To find out more information on malaria throughout the world, =ou can use the interactive CDC malaria map <http://www.cdc.gov/malaria/map/index.html> . You can search or =rowse countries, cities, and place names for more specific malaria risk =nformation and the recommended prevention medicines for that =rea. Malaria Contact for =ealth-Care Providers For =ssistance with the diagnosis or management of suspected cases of =alaria, call the CDC Malaria Hotline: 770-488-7788 (M-F, 9 am-5 pm, =astern time►. For emergency consultation after hours, call 770.488- 7100 =nd ask to speak with a CDC Malaria Branch clinician. A Special Note about =ntimalarial Drugs You should =urchase your antimalarial drugs before travel. Drugs purchased overseas =ay not be manufactured according to United States standards and may not =e effective. They also may be dangerous, contain counterfeit =edications or contaminants, or be combinations of drugs that are not =afe to use. Halofantrine (marketed as =alfan) is widely used overseas to treat malaria. CDC recommends that =ou do NOT use =alofantrine because of serious heart-related side effects, including =eaths. You should avoid using antimalarial drugs that are not =ecommended unless you =ave been diagnosed with life-threatening malaria and no other options =re immediately available. For detailed information =bout these antimalarial drugs, see Choosing a Drug to Prevent Malaria. More Information About Malaria Malaria is =lways a serious disease and may be a deadly illness. Humans get malaria =rom the bite of a mosquito infected with the parasite. Prevent this =erious disease by seeing your health-care provider for a prescription =ntimalarial drug and by protecting yourself against mosquito bites (see below). Travelers to =alaria risk-areas in °Ste d'Ivoire, including infants, children, =nd former residents of Cote d'Ivoire, should take one of the =ntimalarial drugs listed in the box above. 3 EFTA_R1_01263129 EFTA02330823 Symptoms Malaria symptoms may include • chills • headache • body =ches * nausea and =omiting * Plasmodium falciparum, if not promptly treated, may cause kidney =ailure, coma, and death. Despite using the protective measures outlined =bove, travelers may still develop malaria up to a year after returning =rom a malarious area. You should see a doctor immediately if you =evelop a fever anytime during the year following your return and tell =he physician of your travel. Items to Bring With You Medicines you may need: • The prescription =edicines you take every day. Make sure you have enough to =ast during your trip. Keep them in their original prescription bottles =nd always in your carry-on luggage. Be =ure to follow security =uidelines<icon_out.png> <http://www.tsa.govk , if the medicines =re liquids. * malaria-risk area in C6te d'Ivoire and prescribed by =our doctor. * Medicine for diarrhea, usually =ver-the-counter. Note: Some drugs available =y prescription in the US are illegal in other countries. Check the US =epartment of State Consular Information =heets<icon_out.png> for the =ountry(s) you intend to visit or the embassy or consulate for that =ountry(s). If your medication is not allowed in the country you will be =isiting, ask your health-care provider to write a letter on office =tationery stating the medication has been prescribed for you. Other items you may need: • Iodine tablets and portable water filters to purify water if =ottled water is not available. See A Guide to Commercially-Bottled Water and Other Beverages, =nd Basic Information about Skin Cancer <http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/safe-food-water.htm> for more =nformation. • Lightweight long-sleeved shirts, long pants, and a hat to wear =utside, whenever possible. • Flying-insect spray to help clear rooms of mosquitoes. The =roduct should contain a pyrethroid insecticide; these insecticides =uickly kill flying insects, including mosquitoes. • Bed nets treated with =ermethrin, if you will not be sleeping in an air- conditioned or =ell-screened room and will be in malaria-risk areas. For use and =urchasing information, seelnsecticide Treated Bed Nets on the CDC malaria site. =verseas, permethrin or another insecticide, deltamethrin, may be =urchased to treat bed nets and clothes.

The following are disease risks =hat might affect travelers; this is not a complete list of diseases =hat can be present. Environmental conditions may also change, and up to =ate information about risk by regions within a country may also not =lways be available. filariasis, leishmaniasis, and onchocerciasis (river blindness) are other =iseases carried by insects that also occur in West Africa. African trypanosomiasis (African sleeping =ickness) has increased in Africa (it is epidemic in Angola, =emocratic Republic of the Congo, and the Sudan; and highly endemic in =ameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Congo, Cote d'Ivoire, =uinea, Mozambique, Uganda, and Tanzania; low levels are found in most =f the other countries), and an increase in travelers has been noted =ince 2000. Most had exposures in Tanzania and Kenya, reflecting =ommon tourist routes. Protecting yourself against insect =ites will help to prevent these diseases. Schistosomiasis, a parasitic infection, can be =ontracted in fresh water in this region. Do not swim in fresh water =except in well-chlorinated swimming pools) in these countries. Polio outbreaks were reported in several =reviously polio-free countries in Central, Eastern, and Western Africa =eginning in 2003. Polio is still endemic in Nigeria. Travelers to rural areas of West Africa may be exposed =o Lassa virus, which is spread through contact =ith rat urine or droppings. People can be exposed to Lassa virus by =nhaling tiny particles of these excretions in the air, especially if =hey stay in traditional dwellings. Travelers should avoid contact with =ats and should not stay in dwellings that may be infested with rats. =uman-to-human transmission of the disease has been described. Proper safety precautions should be =ollowed to prevent human-to-human transmission from infected =eople. Highly pathogenic avian =nfluenza (H5N1) has been found in poultry populations in several =ountries in Africa. Avoid all direct contact with birds, including =omestic poultry (such as chickens and ducks) and wild birds, and avoid =laces such as poultry farms and bird markets where live birds are =aised or kept. For a current list of countries reporting =utbreaks of H5N1 among poultry and/or wild birds, view updates from the =orld Organization for Animal Health =OlE)<icon_out.png>, and for total numbers =f confirmed human cases of H5N1 virus by country see the World Health Organization (WHO) Avian Influenza =ebsite<icon_out.png>. Many countries in this region have high incidence rates =f tuberculosis <http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowBookCh4-TB.aspx> and high HIV prevalence rates. Top of =age Staying Healthy During Your Trip 5 EFTA_R1_01263131 EFTA02330825 Prevent Insect Bites Many diseases, like malaria and dengue, are spread through insect bites. One of =he best protections is to prevent insect bites by: • Using insect repellent (bug spray) with 3CPA-50% DEET. Picaridin, =vailable in 7% and 15% concentrations, needs more frequent application. =here is less information available on how effective picaridin is at =rotecting against all of the types of mosquitoes that transmit ralaria. • Wearing =ong-sleeved shirts, long pants, and a hat outdoors. • Remaining indoors in a =creened or air-conditioned area during the peak biting period for =alaria (dusk and dawn). • Sleeping in beds covered by nets treated with permethrin, if not =leeping in an air- conditioned or well-screened room. • Spraying rooms with products =ffective against flying insects, such as those containing =yrethroid. For detailed information about =nsect repellent use, see Insect and Arthropod Protection. Prevent Animal Bites and Scratches Direct contact with animals can spread diseases like rabies or rause serious injury or illness. It is important to prevent animal bites =nd scratches. • Be sure you are up to date =ith tetanus vaccination. • Do not touch or feed any animals, including dogs and cats. Even =nimals that look like healthy pets can have rabies or other =iseases. • Help =hildren stay safe by supervising them carefully around all =nimals. • If you are =itten or scratched, wash the wound well with soap and water and go to a doctor right away. • After your trip, be sure to =ell your doctor or state health department if you were bitten or =cratched during travel. For more =nformation about rabies and travel, see the Rabies chapter of the Yellow Book or CDC's =abies homepage. For more information about how to protect yourself =rom other risks related to animals, seeAnimal-Associated Hazards. Be Careful about Food and Water Diseases =rom food and water are the leading cause of illness in travelers. =ollow these tips for safe eating and drinking: • Wash your hands often with soap and water, especially before =ating. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based =and gel (with at least 60% alcohol). • Drink only bottled or boiled water, or carbonated (bubbly) drinks =n cans or bottles. Avoid tap water, fountain drinks, and ice rubes. If this is not possible, learn how to make water safer to drink. 6 EFTA_R1_01263132 EFTA02330826 " Do not eat food purchased from street vendors. " Make sure food is fully =ooked. " Avoid =airy products, unless you know they have been pasteurized. Diseases from food and water often cause vomiting and diarrhea. =ake sure to bring diarrhea medicine with you so that you can treat mild =ases yourself. Avoid Injuries Car crashes are a leading cause of injury among travelers. Protect yourself =rom these injuries by: • Not =rinking and driving. " Wearing =our seat belt and using car seats or booster seats in the backseat for =hildren. " Following =ocal traffic laws. " Wearing =elmets when you ride bikes, motorcycles, and motor bikes. " Not getting on an overloaded =us or mini-bus. • Hiring a =ocal driver, when possible. • Avoiding night driving. Other Health Tips • To avoid =nfections such as HIV and viral hepatitis do not share needles for =attoos, body piercing, or injections. " To reduce the risk of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases =lways use latex condoms. • To prevent fungal and parasitic infections, keep feet clean and =ry, and do not go barefoot, especially on beaches where animals may =ave defecated. Top of =age After =ou Return Home If you are not feeling well, =ou should see your doctor and mention that you have recently traveled. =Iso tell your doctor if you were bitten or scratched by an animal while =raveling. If you have visited a =alaria-risk area, continue taking your antimalarial drug for 4 weeks =doxycycline or mefloquine) or seven days (atovaquone/proguanil) after =eaving the risk area. Malaria is always a serious disease and may be a deadly =Ilness. If you become ill with a fever or flu-like illness =ither while traveling in a malaria-risk area or after you return home =for up to 1 year), you should seek immediate medical attention and should tell the =hysician your travel history. 7 EFTA_R1_01263133 EFTA02330827 Important =ote: This document is not a complete medical guide for =ravelers to this region.
