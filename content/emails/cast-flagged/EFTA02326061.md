| **To** | Jeffrey Jeffrey, we just realized that we did not pay at all at the tea house last night, were we supposed to? There were lots of moment when they could have brought us a check, and it was a long good buy, but also it did not even cross our mind to ask for it, and I don't know if it would be rude to do so... now I am paranoid! 1 EFTA_R1_01246468 EFTA02326061 |
