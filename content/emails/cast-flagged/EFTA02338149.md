| **From** | =/b>james I personal geniu |
| **To** | =/b>Richard Kahn Hi, I was thinking, if the boss is =nterested, I could reach out to some of my hac... er, I mean "network =ecurity professional" friends in Seattle and see if they'd be available = could recommend someone local to do a risk analysis and fortification =ecommendation for the organization. Their company is http://lOActive.com & =ho some of them are less social-skilled than others, I trust the ones I =now. (The=group I worked with split into two factions, IOActive does consulting, =he other "Coco Communications" does mostly military contracting.) Thank you, EFTA_R1_01300024 EFTA02338149 2 EFTA_R1_01300025 EFTA02338150 |
