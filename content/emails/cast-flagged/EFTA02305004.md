| **To** | Steve Donnelly HI Steve.. I've just uploaded another =ersion of the same photo to your FTP site. I've increased the contrast =n the photo to make the black parts darker. My boss wants the black =reas to be really black. He's comparing them to the print I made which =as on a matte paper, so of course black is going to look blacker on the =atte paper since it's more absorbent. Anyways, can we do a proof with =he new photo? The photo is called =lstdininglblack.jpg Thanks.. EFTA_R1_01178572 EFTA02305004 |
