| **Subject** | 2G Hi Andrew, I had 3 stoves delivered today, one was for 2G. when the guys =ent to install it, they said the emergency shut off valve for the gas =tove was behind the dishwasher, thus they would not install it due to =t not being up to code. they said we need to have the shut off valve =oved to behind the stove before they will install the new one. I'm =aving 3 microwaves delivered by PC Richards on Tuesday and it would be =ood if they could install the stove for 2G the same day. do you think =t would be possible to get this fixed by Monday? Pls let me know so I know whether to schedule delivery of 2G stove for =uesday as well. thanks.. and have a great weekend. <?xml version=.0" encoding=TF-8"?> <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.O.dtd"> <plist version=.0"> <dict> <key>date-sent</key> <real>1342836454</real> <key>flags</key> <integer>8623750145</integer> <key>original-mailbox< e > <string>imap:/ <key>remote-id</key> <string>12305</string> <key>subject</key> <string>26</string> </dict> </plist> Sent%20Messages</string> 1 EFTA_R1_01200905 EFTA02312466 |
