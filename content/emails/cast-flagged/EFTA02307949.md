| **To** | Jean luc Brunel Hi hi! Jeffrey wanted me to let you know that we spoke to Woody Allen's audi=logist about you. They said they will give you a very good deal on the hear=ng aids since you area friend of Woody's..around $1,000. I spoke with Ann M=rie at Dr. Janet Shalley's office at 69 E 76th St. Her number is so if you want to deal with her she knows the story.
