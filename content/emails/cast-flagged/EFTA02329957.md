The flight will depart from Palm Beach Airport. The FBO is called Signature Aviation, and the tail # of the plane is 
N101PV. I will let you know when a confirmed departure time is set, so you know when to be at the airport on Sunday.

We are counting on leaving at around 2pm on Sunday. Make sure you have government issued ID with 
you (preferably a passport). I'm going to check if there is anything you need in regards to the cat. Unfortunately, we only 
have our small car (a Range Rover that seats 5) at the airport so you need to asl 
to pick you up. Amanda will send 
you all the details.
