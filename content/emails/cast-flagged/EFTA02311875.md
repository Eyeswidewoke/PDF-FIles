I'm not sure if he touched base with you yet or not, but Mr Epstein w=uld like for you two to work at the house with Brice and Karen next time M= Epstein is there, which will be at the end of this month. The dates aren'= set yet, but I think that's the best way to move forward so he can meet y=u and you can get a real sense of what it's like with him in residence. I =ill touch base as soon as I have confirmed dates, but wanted you to know w=at we are thinking. Have a great July 4th and we will talk soon!
