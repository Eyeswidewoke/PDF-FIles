I am coming Friday moming....staying at Carol and Earle Mack's...going to David's 70th at the Everglades on 
Saturday, some lunch on Sunday 
and flying back with the Taubman's on Sunday night after dinner. There are 250 
people coming from all over the country and Europe for the weekend. I do not know the exact schedule....but will have 
plenty of time to come see you. 
I just got up...1 will call you in a hour... 
Going to LA on morning of April 28th to see "Wall Street:Money Never Sleeps" that night and back the next 
morning to go to Koch's other 70th for CEOs at Museum of Natural History the night of the 29th. 
Cannes - Lv May 12 - 24...more to come...

Can you check out a guy- Jim Harpel...lives on North County, PB...1 had a "blind date" lunch with him 
yesterday...not pretty, not interesting, not young....and of course thinks I am just fabulous...Auld I am not interested. He has 
an investment company...Palm Beach Capital? Also has duplex penthouse at 941 Fifth and house in Washington, Conn. 
He did not know one billionaire or millionaire or social person I am friendly with....that was sort of the kiss of death for 
him.
