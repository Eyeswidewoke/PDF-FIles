I have a large rug being sent from ny to LSJ, maybe we can use that one for the time being once it arrives On Jan 31, 2011, at 4:03 PM, wrote: Hi Update on rug, cleaners were here today, we all have reviewed the rug and everyone agrees that given the amount of mould on the underside of the rug, it is very unlikely that cleaning would remove the smell. It was cleaned prior to the AC being turned off in the master Bedroom and it has been stored in a AC container. It has taken 4 cleanings of the master Bedroom furniture to remove the smell and the rug is the worst of all the items, hence unless JE is really in love with this and is prepared to put up with the smell I would not place it is the Master As of time construction is not finished in the master or for that matter anywhere, but we have moved bed/desk/closets into bedroom area, we are hoping to get in by Thursday Mirror from Zorro was shipped out today, it took a little bit of time as it weights over 500lb - all being equal it should be in FL by the end of the week and will arrange to get it on the 1st boat out Hoping all is well Warmest regards On Sat, Jan 29, 2011 at 6:49 AM, No problems, rug, not really in good shape, but will review and get back with you K On Fri, Jan 28, 2011 at 5:59 PM, JE would like the arm chair, ottoman, bench and desk which is in the kite house to be moved back to the master bedroom. He said the heavy stone table can go between the 2 canon balls under the TV. Is the old bedroom carpet good enough to have cleaned and put back in the mater bed only temporarily until we get something new?
