You then told me that I should stand down and Ellen had everythin= under control. However after spending hours with her. She didn't even =now the basis in your billion dollars notes. you then asked me to come se= you with Terje , and agreed and shook hands with both terje and i a fee =f 21 million dollars and argued for Terje to receive a million of it. Thi= is roughly half the fee I told you is my standard. I hired two people = had many meetings, some with Chris to revivew all your documents . agai= though you had my contracts since september told me that now as the dail= news would be merged the post. I should wait another week. I have tol= you all along that a performance based fee would be a percentage of tax s=viings and cost a lot more money. I told you that your trust statements=were problematic as they had notes due form the daily news. the statement=givein to the bank to support your loans was an issue.. I have repeatedl= said there are ways to deal with all these issues. , but this is what I d= for a liviing. you are my very good friend and I have given you great ad=ice. I then recievd a call from LEon Black , telling me that you had =sked to find a sophisticated tax person, and he also pointed you to me. = am aware of the difficutly you have in paying real money for real advice.= I am surprised as when it comes to real esate you have always been the to= bidder for A qualtiy property. paying more that others though reasonsobl= and with great results.
