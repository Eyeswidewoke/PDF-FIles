Based on that representation, Ms. Maxwell accepted a July 12, 2021 trial date and her lawyers planned accordingly, postponing trials in other cases to preserve this high-priority date. It was only after considerable judicial and defense resources were expended that the government belatedly superseded, again, with no justifiable reason g

The government may be entitled to supersede but not when its decision disrupts the schedule set by the Court and relied on by Ms. Maxwell. This delay has a prejudicial effect on counsel's readiness for trial and Ms. Maxwell's prolonged detention. This is no longer the "two-week" trial as represented by the government. By adding charges that encompass dozens of additional witnesses, the government has unilaterally destroyed the po
