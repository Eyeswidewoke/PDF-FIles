I am afraid we must cancel the appointment we made for you, Jeffrey and Mike Abramowitz at Jeffrey's home in NY on July 24th. Unfortunately he will not be here. Hoping we can set another date but will need to await Jeffrey's schedule. Could you please pass this along to Mike as well? Thank you EFTA_R1_00948241 EFTA02217795 |
