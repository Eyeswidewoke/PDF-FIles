It is really horrendous to be continually used to hurt people you care deep=y about by the newspapers. It is 
beyond any words, as you know. 
I know you spoke to James. I of all people understand what it feels like to=be castagated by the Tabloids. I know 
how you feel. 
I know you also feel hellaciously let down by me, from what you were either=told or read, and I must humbly 
apologise to you and your heart for that. =ou have always been a steadfast, generous and supreme friend to me and my 
=amily. 
As you know I did absolutely not say the P. Word about you. But understand =t was reported that I did. 
However, I am apologising to you today for not replying to your email, or r=aching out to you when the tabloids 
were so vicious and horrendous... In t=e weeks leading up to that monday when I made my statement. And then 
after=ards. When they used me to hurt you beyond realms. 
As you know, it was and is the worst nightmare for you, but also for me. As=you know the whole story did not 
come about because of me. 
However because of my statement they made it worse for you. I understand=all this. 
You know me well, and we are steadfast to that. But, I must apologise for n=t reaching out to you or answering 
your email. It is unlike me. Therefore,=you can only deduce, that something else must have been going on, for me t= 
react in this way. So in the eye of your storm, which I know is hellaciou=, may I ask you to accept my apology for not 
reaching out to you, in the e=e of MY storm, and accept and understand that I was in fear beyond all tot=lity and I could 
not move left or right because of it, and was close to be= ridden with the fear of what was happening. I was paralysed. I

was advise= in no uncertain terms to having nothing to do with you, and not to speak =r email you, and if I did, I would 
cause more problems to both You and The=Duke and myself. So I shut down and ran away. I was broken and lost. 
So=please understand, as I do about you, that I ws broken and not the strong =erson you know, and I got completely 
obliterated too, and I saw all my chi=drens work etc disappearing.. I shut down and everyone out. I was frighten=d. The 
Palace system is frightening, and each step I turned or each action=was wrong and I did not want to hurt Andrew one 
more time. 
So Jeffrey, this email is sent with a hope you accept, and understand a lit=le of my side too. 
We are and have both been in the firing line, both blamed for stuff we have=not done, this front line attack has 
been like this for me for 22 years. Y=u would have thought I was thick skinned enough to handle it. I know there=are 2 
sides to every story, I have heard yours, please hear mine. 
I am glad you spoke to James, and James made you aware from the British med=a standpoint, that all this 
hellaciousness had been going on many days =EFORE my statement. And I was instructed to act with the uptmost speed, 
fr=m most sides, if I was to have any chance at all holding onto my career as=a childrens book author etc and a childrens 
philanthropist, and I got terr=fied. I should have taken advice from you too, before speaking to Geordie,=and taken a day 
or two to think of the ramifications of my actions, but =A0for the reasons as stated above, I was in over riding fear. I am 
sorr=. I just did not know what or where to turn. 
I know James can send you every single article from the days, weeks, lea=ing up to that Monday of the 
statement from the endless horrendous page= written about You and The Duke. So you can see why I became paralysed. 
I know you and James are going to work on a solution. 
In the meantime, I write this from the truth of my heart.
