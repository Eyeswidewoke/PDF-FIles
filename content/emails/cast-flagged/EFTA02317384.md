It was suggested to him by his doctors here to go to both Sheer and the other professor and show them the CT results for their opinions. He can come to NY for a day either on the 10/19 or on the 10/24. Is it possible=to fix both meeting for one of those dates? Thanks a lot, Nili 2 EFTA_R1_01219508 EFTA02317385 |
