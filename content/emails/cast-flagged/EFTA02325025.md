| **Subject** | Re: Vacation schedules .Perhaps that would be better. Carluz and Arlene definitely were unhappy with only 2 weeks for the first 5 y=ars. Arline mentioned, that it could be less then required by law? I did tell them however that Mr. Epstein has usually been quite generous wit= vacation times in the past. In the end I said that I would have to check with Rich before I give them an=answer. Please advice...
