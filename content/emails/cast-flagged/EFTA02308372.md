We can have =p to 6 cards per account so other people can use as well, like Lyn who roes the buying and stocking for 71st. I also believe there is a Costco =n west palm beach as well. Things like dry food items( flour, sugar, =alt, soda, water) as well as cleaning products and paper goods we can =uy in bulk here in NY and maybe even ship to island and save a bunch of =oney. Right now all the cleaning products for 71st are coming from the =upermarket... We have a quote on the ice machine and I will call =round to a few people today and see if they can beat the =rice.
