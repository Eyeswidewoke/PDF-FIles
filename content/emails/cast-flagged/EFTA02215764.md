With warm regards to Professor Parncutt, Mark On Fri, Jun 9, 2017 at 2:49 AM, jims, ZSMW Dear Professor Mark Tramo, wrote: I am writing on behalf of Richard Parncutt at the Centre for Systematic Musicology in Graz. We would like to thank you for your continuing support of the Journal of Interdisciplinary Music Studies (JIMS) as a member of the Advisory Board. The last few years have been quiet, but we recently published a Special Issue entitled 'Cognition of Early Polyphony', edited by Frans Wiering and Barbara Tillmann. We also renewed our homepage at http://www.musicstudies.org, so please take a look and download one of the latest articles if you like (open access). We will advertise the journal at conferences over the summer (see attached flyer) and expect to receive more submissions in the coming academic year. We are also updating the editorial boards and would like to continue to list you as a member of the Advisory Board. Please let us know if that is appropriate for you. You will not be required to do anything in return for having your name listed, but we may ask you to be action editor or anonymous reviewer for a future submission. Thank you very much and best wishes, Maximilian Burkard (student assistant) p.s. In case it is appropriate for you to continue as a member of the Advisory Board and if you EFTA_R1_00944085 EFTA02215764 have time, could you check the list at http://musicstudies.org/editorial-board/ and let us know in case what is written as your affiliation/institution is wrong (and what should be written there)? Thanks a lot!
