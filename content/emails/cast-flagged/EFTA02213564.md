Second, I came home to my apartment mid-afternoon and now have an emergency conference call with a client at 5:30. I won't be able to make it uptown to Jeffrey's this evening. Is he leaving early tomorrow? If not, I could come by in the morning. Sorry for the late notice! These clients have no boundaries and never let up!
