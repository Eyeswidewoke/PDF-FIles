Their contact person is Cesar, I just =ent an email to you and him, so that you can coordinate. Looks like there are very limited flight options. Can you see if you can =ook them a flight from Miami to STT on Tuesday late afternoon, they =ould have to stay at the hotel in SIT (the Ritz I guess) and fly back =o Miami Wednesday late afternoon or evening. Thank you very much!
