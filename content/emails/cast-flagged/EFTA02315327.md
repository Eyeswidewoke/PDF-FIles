Hey Kim, 
The only thing that might be useful to us is the wooden plank dining table in this photo. Also not sure if the wooden 
coffee table is available too? That would be it from the Palm Beach batch. The issue I have is that Janusz is in NY at the 
moment filling in for the NY staff while they are on vacation. We don't have anyone in PB right now who could come pick 
up the items. Is there anyway we could pick up the table at a later date?
