Dear Eva, 
I hope that you are enjoying your summer so far. I am involved with this year's Childhood Gala, 
and hope that you can make it to this year's event. The World Childhood Foundation Thank You Gala dinner will be held 
at the Plaza Hotel on September 24th, and is hosted by Her Majesty Queen Silvia of Sweden as well as Princess 
Madeleine. 
I have spent some time with Childhood's new CEO, Joanna Rubenstein, and am so impressed 
with her plan to help eliminate childhood abuse and be a voice for all the children in this world. Nothing is more 
important than making sure that our children are safe and happy so they can one day become leaders.

Attached are reservation and information forms as well as a letter from Childhood's new CEO, 
Joanna Rubenstein. 
Enjoy the rest of your summer, and I am looking forward to seeing you at the Plaza in 
September. 
Stor Kram och Glad Sommar! 
Christine Mack
