When able please let us know if you have any trip details for ops CYUL. Also on your previous Canadian ETA question officially no ETA required until Sept but Universal is able to arrange ETAS for you on your behalf. We were able to do this starting mid March. We would just need a passport copy for the passenger. On a recent trip for another client I was advised that customs gave a passenger a hard time on arrival and forced the passenger to go into the customs office and complete the ETA application online so I would recommend to be safe and have us or you arrange in advance.
