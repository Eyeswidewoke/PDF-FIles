He has a =culpture of an archer on his island which over looks the sea and he =ants to put a laser in it's bow to have a laser beam going out from the =ow across the sky. He wanted to see if you could recommend a good type =f laser to use for this? I tried to do some research on lasers, but =t's quite confusing! Any input would be greatly appreciated!
