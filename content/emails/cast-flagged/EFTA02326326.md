You just need to give her your receipts, or I guess in the case of farmers market, just write down what it was for, etc.. I will be in touch about Wed. as soon as I know something concrete!

When purchasing product is there a petty cash system in place? I like to go to the farmers market as much as possible and thats a cash only situation. I would say that for the next week we will only need the blender. If the week works out and everyone is happy with my food, then I would like to go ahead and get a couple knives to have in the kitchen and the rice cooker. The kitchen seems pretty well stocked with the exception of those few items. There may be a couple things we will need from time to time, but to get started what is there now seems more than sufficient. Does that sound like a good plan? This is the blender they have it at Williams Sonoma, i believe its out of stock at JB Prince. http://www.williams-sonoma.com/products/vitamix-blender-professional- 200/?pkey=e%7Cvitamix%2Bprofessional%2Bseries%2/3200%2Bblender%7C1%7Cbest%7C0%7C1%7C24%7C%7Cl&cm_s rc=PRODUCTSEARCH I I NoFacet-_-NoFacet-_-NoMerchRules-_- Thanks for showing me around today, looking forward to cooking on weds.
