If you could be ready to come to 71st with it around 1pm today that would be good so we have time to go buy something else if need be. For tomorrow, Karyna will start at the studio at 9am and do some individual shots. I will have the rest of you guys come a little later to do hair and makeup and then the Helmut shot together. We need to have the shot finished before 1:30pm which is when Karyna will need to leave to meet The rest of you guys will be doing your individual shots another day.. you will only be doing the one group shot tomorrow. Please let me know you got this and can make it this afternoon with your clothing options for the shoot. If you have a suit, white button down with dress pants, trench coat, blazer sort of things.. Thanks girls! <images.jpeg> 1 EFTA_R1_01205657 EFTA02314167 |
