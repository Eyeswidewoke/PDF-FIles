You could stay until Tues June 20th then go back to NY, meet up with Elina at JFK and go on to Turkey for your fun trip. Might this be something you would be interested in doing? Or if you prefer, you can just fly from paris to Istanbul where you meet up with Elina on June 21 and go to Turkey from there. Please let me know!! Thanks. Lesley.
