Another Syria Peace Conference 
Editorial 
JAN. 21, 2014 -- Few peace conferences have been set up amid 
the unrelenting pessimism that surrounds the talks involving 
Syria that open Wednesday in Switzerland. But while a peace 
agreement is unlikely to be reached anytime soon, the meeting 
can still produce useful results. That has to be the approach of 
the conveners, including the United States, Russia and the 
United Nations. Crucial early goals should include a cease-fire 
and the delivery of humanitarian assistance to millions of 
desperate civilians. 
There were some shaky moments before the conference, which 
has taken months to arrange, even got started, not least when the 
United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, issued a last-
minute invitation for Iran to attend, then rescinded it after strong 
EFTA_R1_02206834 
EFTA02722138

objections from America; from Saudi Arabia, Iran's regional 
rival; and from the Syrian opposition. The United States has said 
that Iran could not participate without publicly accepting a 2012 
communiqué that is the basis of the conference and stipulates 
that the goal is a transitional administration by "mutual consent" 
of the Assad government and the opposition. 
In the view of the United States, this means that President 
Bashar al-Assad would be replaced, although Assad government 
officials and his Alawite sect could be part of the new structure. 
Iran has refused to accept any preconditions. 
Just how the invitation from the United Nations was fumbled is 
unclear, but it is unfortunate that some diplomatic solution could 
not have been found to include Iran, which along with Russia is 
Syria's main ally, providing President Assad with arms and 
other military support. In an interview with The New York 
Times and Time magazine last month, the Iranian foreign 
minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, said Iran would not be an 
impediment to a political settlement. "We have every interest in 
helping the process in a peaceful direction," he said. "We are 
satisfied, totally satisfied, convinced that there is no military 
solution in Syria and that there is a need to find a political 
solution in Syria." 
The deaths of thousands of civilians have not persuaded Russia 
and Iran to break with Mr. Assad or at least pressure him to end 
the slaughter and cruelty against civilians. Iran might have 
ensured itself a seat at the peace conference if it had promised to 
suspend arms deliveries while negotiations were underway or 
persuaded Mr. Assad to call a cease-fire. And there are good 
reasons for Russia and Iran to play a constructive role. The civil 
EFTA_R1_02206835 
EFTA02722139

war has drawn affiliates of Al Qaeda and other Sunni extremists 
to the Syrian battlefield, and these could eventually be a threat 
to Shiite-led Iran as well as Russia, which is fighting extremists 
in the Caucasus and worrying about attacks during the Winter 
Olympics in Sochi next month. 
Mr. Zarif acknowledged this problem generally, asserting that 
"the continuation of this tragedy in Syria can only provide the 
best breeding ground for extremists who use this basically as a 
justification, as a recruiting climate, in order to wage the same 
type of activity in other parts of this region." 
The peace conference is already providing a service by 
refocusing attention on the savagery of the war, now in its third 
year. On Monday, a team of legal and forensic experts 
commissioned by the government of Qatar, a main sponsor of 
the Syrian opposition, said that thousands of photographs —
apparently smuggled out of Syria by a defecting military police 
photographer — showed scarred, emaciated corpses that offered 
"direct evidence" of mass torture by Syrian government forces. 
Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have also 
accused opposition forces, as well as the government, of human 
rights abuses. In all, more than 100,000 Syrians are believed to 
have been killed in the war, many by government forces that 
have bombed cities and deprived civilians of food and other 
essential needs. It is well past time to say "enough" to more 
civilian deaths — and exactly the right time for a cease-fire and 
secure deliveries of humanitarian supplies.

WikiLeaks, Drought and Syria 
Thomas L. Friedman 
JAN. 21, 2014 -- In the 1970s, I got both my bachelor's and 
master's degrees in modern Middle East studies, and I can 
assure you that at no time did environmental or climate issues 
appear anywhere in the syllabi of my courses. Today, you can't 
understand the Arab awakenings — or their solutions — without 
considering climate, environment and population stresses. 
I've been reporting on the connection between the Syrian 
drought and the uprising there for a Showtime documentary that 
will air in April, but recently our researchers came across a 
WikiLeaks cable that brilliantly foreshadowed how 
environmental stresses would fuel the uprising. Sent on Nov. 8, 
2008, from the U.S. Embassy in Damascus to the State 
Department, the cable details how, in light of what was a 
devastating Syrian drought — it lasted from 2006-10 — Syria's 
U.N. food and agriculture representative, Abdullah bin Yehia, 
was seeking drought assistance from the U.N. and wanted the 
U.S. to contribute. Here are some key lines: 
■ "The U.N. Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs 
launched an appeal on September 29 requesting roughly $20.23 
million to assist an estimated one million people impacted by 
what the U.N. describes as the country's worst drought in four 
EFTA_R1_02206837 
EFTA02722141

decades." 
■ "Yehia proposes to use money from the appeal to provide seed 
and technical assistance to 15,000 small-holding farmers in 
northeast Syria in an effort to preserve the social and economic 
fabric of this rural, agricultural community. If UNFAO efforts 
fail, Yehia predicts mass migration from the northeast, which 
could act as a multiplier on social and economic pressures 
already at play and undermine stability." 
■ "Yehia does not believe that the [government of Bashar al-
Assad] will allow any Syrian citizen to starve. ... However, 
Yehia told us that the Syrian minister of agriculture ... stated 
publicly that economic and social fallout from the drought was 
`beyond our capacity as a country to deal with.' What the U.N. 
is trying to combat through this appeal, Yehia says, is the 
potential for `social destruction' that would accompany erosion 
of the agricultural industry in rural Syria. This social destruction 
would lead to political instability." 
■ "Without direct assistance, Yehia predicts that most of these 
15,000 small-holding farmers would be forced to depart Al 
Hasakah Province to seek work in larger cities in western Syria. 
Approximately 100,000 dependents — women, children and the 
elderly or infirm — would be left behind to live in poverty, he 
said. Children would be likely to be pulled from school, he 
warned, in order to seek a source of income for families left 
behind. In addition, the migration of 15,000 unskilled laborers 
would add to the social and economic pressures presently at play 
in major Syrian cities. A system already burdened by a large 
Iraqi refugee population may not be able to absorb another 
influx of displaced persons, Yehia explained, particularly at this 
EFTA_R1_02206838 
EFTA02722142

time of rising costs, growing dissatisfaction of the middle class, 
and a perceived weakening of the social fabric and security 
structures that Syrians have come to expect and — in some cases 
— rely on." 
Yehia was prophetic. By 2010, roughly one million Syrian 
farmers, herders and their families were forced off the land into 
already overpopulated and underserved cities. These climate 
refugees were crowded together with one million Iraqi war 
refugees. The Assad regime failed to effectively help any of 
them, so when the Arab awakenings erupted in Tunisia and 
Egypt, Syrian democrats followed suit and quickly found many 
willing recruits from all those dislocated by the drought. 
But also consider this: Last May 9, The Times of Israel quoted 
Israeli geographer Arnon Soffer as observing that in the past 60 
years, the population in the Middle East has twice doubled. 
"There is no example of this anywhere else on earth." 
And this: Last March, the International Journal of Climatology 
published a study, "Changes in extreme temperature and 
precipitation in the Arab region," that found "consistent 
warming trends since the middle of the 20th century across the 
region," manifested in "increasing frequencies of warm nights, 
fewer cool days and cool nights." 
And then consider this: Syria's government couldn't respond to 
a prolonged drought when there was a Syrian government. So 
imagine what could happen if Syria is faced by another drought 
after much of its infrastructure has been ravaged by civil war. 
And, finally, consider this: "In the future, who will help a 
country like Syria when it gets devastated by its next drought if
