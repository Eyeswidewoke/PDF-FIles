Jeffrey Epstein: International Moneyman of 
Mystery 
He's pals with a passel of Nobel Prize—winning scientists, 
CEOs like Leslie Wexner of the Limited, socialite Ghislaine 
Maxwell, even Donald Trump. But it wasn't until he flew Bill 
Clinton, Kevin Spacey, and Chris Tucker to Africa on his 
private Boeing 727 that the world began to wonder who he 
is. 
By Landon Thomas Jr 
He comes with cash to bum, a fleet of 
airplanes, and a keen eye for the ladies -
to say nothing of a relentless brain that 
challenges Nobel Prize-winning scientists 
across the country - and for financial 
markets around the world. Ever since the

THE CITY POLITIC 
The Speech 
Hillary Won't 
Give About 
2008 
By Chris 
Smith 
Finally, Hillary Clinton, the 
most careful of politicians, 
says what she really 
thinks. 
open bids for il. Soros. Wasserstein. Kravis. Weill. The Sturm and Drang of 
their successes and failures has been played out in public. Epstein breaks the 
mold. Most everyone on the Street has heard of him, but nobody seems to 
know what the hell he is up to. Which is just the way ho likes it. 
Everything guide to (Pea tic 
'My belief is that Joff maintains some sort of money-management ram, though 
you won't get a straight answer from him,' says one well-known investor. 'He 
once told me he had 300 people working for him, and I've also heard that he 
manages Rockefeller money. But one never knows. It's like looking at the 
Wizard of Oz — there may be less there than meets the eye.' 
Says another prominent Wall Streeter: 'He Is this mysterious, Gatsbyesque 
figure. Ho likes people to think that he is very rich, and he cultivates this air of 
aloofness. The whole thing Is weird.' 
The wizard that meets the eye is spare and fit; with a long jaw and a carefully 
coiffed head of silver hair, he looks like a taller, younger Ralph Lauren. A 
raspy Brooklyn accent betrays his Coney Island origins. He spends an hour 
and fifteen minutes every day doing advanced yoga with his personal 
instructor, who travels with him wherever he goes. Fie is an enthusiastic 
member of the Trilateral Commission and the Council on Foreign Relations. 
He dreaans casualty 
jeans, open-necked shirts, and sneakers -- and is 
rarely seen in a tie. Indeed, those close to him say the reason he quit his 
board seat at the Rockefeller Institute was that he hated wearing a suit. 'It 
feels like a dress,' he told ono friend. 
Epstein likes to tell people that he's a loner, a man who's never touched 
alcohol or chugs, and one whose nightlife is far from energetic. And yet if you 
talk to Donald Trump, a different Epstein emerges. 'I've known Jeff for fifteen 
years. Terrific guy- Trump booms from a speakerphone. 'He's a lot of fun to 
be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and 
many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it — Jeffrey enjoys his 
social fie.' 
But beautiful women are only a part of it. Because here's the thing about 
Epstein: As some collect butterflies, he collects beautiful minds. 'I Invest In 
people ben politics or science. Its what I do; he has said to friends. And 
his latest prize addition is the former president. In his eyes, Clinton as a

species represents the highest evolutionary form of the political animal. To be 
up close to him, as he was during the African journey, is akin to seeing the 
rarest of beasts on a safari. As he put it to a friend upon his return from Africa, 
'If you were a boxer at the downtown gymnasium at 14th Street and Mike 
Tyson walked in, your face would have the same look as these foreign 
leaders had when Clinton entered the room. lie is the worlds greatest 
politician.' 
'Jeffrey is both a highly successful financier and a committed philanthropist 
with a keen sense of global markets and an in-depth knowledge of twenty-
first-century science,' Clinton says through a spokesman. 'I especially 
appreciated his insights and generosity during the recent trip to Africa to work 
on democratization, en-powering the poor, citizen service, and combating 
HIV/AIDS.' 
Before Clinton, Epstein's rare appearances in the gossip columns tended to 
be speculation as to the true nature of his relationship with Ghislaino Maxwell. 
While they are still friends, the English tabloids have postulated that Maxwell 
has longed for a more permanent pairing and that for undetermined reasons 
Epstein has not reciprocated in kind. 'It's a mysterious relationship that they 
have,' says society journalist David Patrick Columbia. 'In one way, they are 
soul mates, yet they are hardly companions anymore. Ifs a nice conventional 
relationship, where they serve each others purposes.' 
Friends of the two say that Maxwell, whose social life has always been higher-
octane than Epstein's, lent a tittle pizzazz to the lower-profile Epstein. Indeed, 
at a party at Maxwell's house, her friends say, one is just as apt to see 
Russian ladies of the night as one is to see Prince Andrew. The Oxford-
educated Maxwell, described by many as a man-eater (she flies her own 
helicopter and was recently seen dining with Clinton at Nello's on Madison 
Avenue), lives In her own townhouse a few blocks away. Epstein Is frequently 
seen around town with a bevy of comely young women but there has been no 
boldfaced name to replace Maxwell. 'You may read about Jeffrey in the social 
columns, but there is much more to him than that; says Jeffrey T. Leeds of 
the private equity firm Leeds Weld ei Co. 'He's a talented money manager 
and an extremely hardworking person with broad interests. Most unusual, 
though, is that in this media-obsessed age he is not in any sense a self-
promoter.' 
Born in 1953 and raised in Coney Island, Epstein went to Lafayette High 
School. According to his bio, he took some classes In physics at Cooper 
Union from 1969 to 1971. He left Cooper Union in 1971 and attended NYU's 
Courant Institute, where he took courses in mathematical physiology of the 
heart, leaving that school, too, without a degree. Between 1973 and 1975, 
Epstein taught calculus and physics at the Dalton School. 
By most accounts, he was something of a Robin Williams-in-Dead Poets 
Socktrytype of figure, wowing his high-school classes with passionate 
mathematical offs. So impressed was one Wall Street father of a student that 
he said to Epstein point-blank: 'What are you doing leaching math at Dalton? 
You should be working on Wal Street -- why don't you give my friend Ace 
Greenberg a call'
