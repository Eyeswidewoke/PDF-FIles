> From To Subject: GPS for apprehension Date: Fri, 23 Oct 2020 21:39:11 +0000 Attachments: Maxwell_GPS_Combo_v3.docx; 2018-05-10,_PAC,_GPS_for_2_Target_Phones.docx The most recent one I have is for Maxwell, attached — you may want to just check the forms library to see if there has been any update since this version (2019.07.24), but I assume it's up to date since it's just from the summer. From a little further back, but possibly simpler, also attached is one I got for a PAC case to make arrests.
