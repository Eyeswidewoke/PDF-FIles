A lot of work in AI, neural network t=eory, "Big Data and statistics," etc., is as you describe =E2 mimicking

Marr, , -try, probabilty, , symmetry. ent=opy. it might look like computation but it is not. it mi=ht look

I wouldn't take the term =80 mechanism" too literally. It refers to whatever is taki=g place in 
the brain. For some, as most of those in the Nowak group, it means neural nets. =For Gallistel, it's processes internal to 
the cell. Useful t= look at these matters in terms of Marrs three levels: computatio=, algorithm, mechanism.

Not a trivial matter. I'm not the=best person to ask. I'd suggest contacting 
people who =99ve really thought seriously about these issues, like Robert Pollin, a fi=e independent economist at U 
Mass Amherst 
2.=C2 
Sherman's speculation is an interesting exten=ion of recent discoveries about 
conservation, deep homologies, regulatory =ircuits, and other elements of what's sometimes called "the evo-devo 
revolution." It remains to be seen whether a=ything can be done with it. I think you underestimate the contributi=ns of 
Berwick and his students, including Yang. 
3.=C2 
The idea that there is a "ug" for vis=on, language, etc., seems to be essentially 
what Randy Gallistel calls =80 the norm in neuroscience," quoted in the paper on modularity =hat I sent you. And yes, 
they're certainly connected, at least a= the level of cells, and presumably well beyond. These are live and =ignificant 
research areas. These "central modules" d= not have input or output, but they are accessed by input systems and in 
some cases, like language, by output systems. That seems a fair p=cture of the rough cognitive architecture. I don't 
follow th= rest. It's true that work on human language uses as evidenc= what is available, namely performance. And 
much of the work unfortunately is fascinated by the droppings, just as in other fields. =AO But there is some work that 
seeks to discover the mechanisms, as discus=ed in the papers I sent you.

It's true that grammars stand=outside of time, a fact that many linguists and

1. dont you have any =uestions about money, . ? ? finance.. =? I owe you 
some knowledge . 
2 .to say the shape c=n be" decribed " by language is redundant. =A0 
the "shape"=is the metaphor for an n-dimentional object , it stands outside of 
t=me. as do grammars , but sentences do not, they require time. = the shape is somewhat like a fitness landscape? 
contrasted with communication which also requires = time dimension and biololgy that needs and uses energy . =AO I 
suggest the mammal Ug is a subcategory of all UG.s = and that as biology prefers redundancy . the other modules, ie 
vision =AO are small distortions of it. 
3. during that UN period I often give a "=C2 money 101 to world leaders who
