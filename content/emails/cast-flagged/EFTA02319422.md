| **Subject** | Re: Russian business visas We would like to apply for a tourist visa good from Jan.25-Feb. 25th. How long does this take to process? I can bring in whatever you need on =onday the 3rd. We will then proceed with the business visas after we return with our =pcoming trip to Europe and Russia. What do you require for the tourist visa?
