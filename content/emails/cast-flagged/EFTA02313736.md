Do you think this is Marc being =bstructive or acting on instructions from a difficult owner? Frankly I =on't understand why they need all this information. If an offer =s on the table they either accept it or ask for more. Once a price is =greed, then it's up to the buyer to perform. Only if the buyer =ails to perform should they start to be difficult. > Let me know if you want me to talk to him. > As ever, > Mark > Sent from my iPhone » On 26 Mar 2019, at 23:17, Karyna Shuliak < > =rote: » Mark, I thought you should know that after weeks of back and forth I =o not believe Marc Leon was serious about selling me the house.
