This is the toothpaste I was telling you about! Karen should try using this to ease her pain. You should be able to find at Walgreens or CVS. It is usually on the bottom shelf cause it is not a popular brand. It is a little more expensive but worth it! Buy a small tube! I thought I had a trial tube but I don't! I hope she feels better soon. >> <IMG_4872.JPG> >> >> Sent from my iPhone EFTA_R1_00950062 EFTA02218276 |
