If you could be rea=y to come to 71st with it around 1pm today that would be good so we have t=me to go buy something else if need be. For tomorrow, Karyna will start at the studio at 9am and do some indiv=dual shots. I will have the rest of you guys come a little later to do hai= and makeup and then the Helmut shot together. We need to have the shot fi=ished before 1:30pm which is when Karyna will need to leave to meet JE. The rest of you guys will be doing your individual shots another day..=you will only be doing the one group shot tomorrow. Please le= me know you got this and can make it this afternoon with your clothing op=ions for the shoot. If you have a suit, white button down with dress pants= trench coat, blazer sort of things..
