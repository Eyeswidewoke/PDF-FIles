| **Subject** | 71st basement flooring I have gotten a rough estimate to replace the basement flooring =ith Armstrong black and white checkered sheet vinyl flooring. To do the =allway and catering kitchen for material and installation would be =bout $4800. This excludes the laundry room. (I'm going off the sizing =rom a quote I found in Doug's papers when the current flooring was =nstalled in 1996; it only included the hallway and kitchen which is =100 sq.feet) I have included photos of the hall, kitchen and laundry =oom. If you would like to have it changed out, I can schedule them to =ome do a proper measure and give a final quote. Here is =he link to the Armstrong sheet =inyl: http://www.armstrong.com/flooring/vinyl-sheet/blackwell-e=ony-white-resilient-vinyl-sheet-G6300/floor-120627.asp </=iv> 1 EFTA_R1_01250423 EFTA02327263 |
