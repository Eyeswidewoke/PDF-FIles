Jeffrey is probably trying to remember me as it's been so long so I can try to help; remind him he had loaned me his place in the desert in New Mexico when I was going through a bit of a tough time, I went there for 3 days. Also if he googles me he might remember what I look like, although it was around 23 years ago, and I looked younger, by still... same person. :) or, if need be, I can email you a picture quite simply; he might recall then? > Best, > Jude » On May 30, 2017, at 3:49 PM, wrote: > > >> Hello Jude...Hope you are well.. just following up...can you please remind me who it is that initially introduced you to Jeffrey way back when....? >> Thank you, >> EFTA_R1_00939380 EFTA02213850 |
