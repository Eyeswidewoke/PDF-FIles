I've increased the contrast in the photo to make the black =arts darker. My boss wants the black areas to be really black. He's =omparing them to the print I made which was on a matte paper, so of =ourse black is going to look blacker on the matte paper since it's more =bsorbent. Anyways, can we do a proof with the new photo? The photo is =ailed 7lstdininglblack.jpg Thanks.. <?xml version=.0" encoding=TF•8"b <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//ApplefiDTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList•1.0.dtd"> <plist version=.0"> <dict> <key>date-sent</key> <real>1334337808</real> <key>flags</key> <integer>8590195713</integer> <key>original-mailbox</key> <string>imap://sarahk525@mail.mac.com/Sent%20Messages</string> <key>remote-id</key> <string>10058</string> <key>subject</key> <string></string> </dict> </plist> 1 EFTA_R1_01179255 EFTA02305206 |
