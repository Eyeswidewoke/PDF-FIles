> The Foreign Minister briefed the Secretary-General on his discussions with President 
Assad and a number of other Governments about the situation in Syria. 
­ He asked the Secretary-General to call President Assad to encourage him to publicly 
announce on Wednesday the measures they had agreed to. 
• 
The Foreign Minister informed the Secretary-General that there had been an 
agreement with Israel on the flotilla for a month, but that some were blocking it in the 
Israeli Government. If the Cabinet meeting of Wednesday didn't approve the 
agreement, Turkey would take the next steps once the Palmer report would be 
published on Monday. 
Discussion: 
The Secretary-General thanked the Foreign Minister for taking his call. He knew he 
had been very busy and he wanted to talk to him about two things: Syria and the flotilla panel 
report. 
On Syria, the Secretary-General expressed his concern that the Syrian authorities 
continue to ignore calls of the international community to halt violence. Following the 
Security Council presidential statement on 3 August, he took note of the strong statements 
from the King of Saudi Arabia and other states in the region. He had noted with great interest 
the Minister's extensive discussions with President Assad and Foreign Minister Mouallem 
the previous week, and his statement yesterday. He asked whether the Minister could tell him 
more about these meetings. Prime Minister Erdogan had mentioned a deadline for progress 
within 10-15 days. He enquired about the Foreign Minister's assessment of the situation on 
the ground and of the thinking and strategy of the Syrian Government. The Secretary-General 
further asked what the Minister saw as the next steps and what the international community 
could do to stop violence in Syria and advance reform that would meet the legitimate 
demands of the Syrian people. He indicated that he had talked to the President also, and that 
just the day before, the Syrian authorities had agreed to allow access to a UN humanitarian 
team. He hoped the team would be granted access to all areas affected by violence and would 
be able to assess the humanitarian needs of the Syrian people and provide assistance as 
needed. He regretted that the human rights mission had still not been agreed to, although it 
had been mandated by the Human Rights Council. The human rights team had nonetheless 
met with refugees and witnesses in third countries. Their findings are extremely worrying

and could suggest that the scale and nature of the abuses over the past months may be 
tantamount to crimes against humanity. Through public statements and in his latest phone 
call with President Assad, the Secretary-General had reminded the Government of Syria that 
it was accountable under international human rights law for all acts of violence perpetrated 
by its security forces against the civilian population. The High Commissioner for Human 
Rights would brief the Security Council on the following Thursday [18 August]. This was a 
situation of mutual concern, and he therefore wanted to talk to the Foreign Minister. 
Foreign Minister Davutoglu replied that he was very happy to talk to the Secretary-
General, and that his call was very timely. He had intended to call him after his recent trip to 
Syria. He believed the Secretary-General could play an important role and the crisis was 
becoming more internationalized. The Foreign Minister recalled that in January, he had gone 
to Syria with the Prime Minister and that they had predicted what would happen. They had 
urged President Assad to implement reforms. Assad had agreed, but had not done anything. 
In April, Davutoglu had gone again to Syria and had given Assad a list of reforms that he 
needed to implement immediately. The President had agreed, and had even made a public 
speech describing the reforms he would take. But again, he had done nothing. 
During his last visit the previous week, the Foreign Minister had met with President 
Assad for six hours, three and a half of which were spent in tete-I-tete. Davutoglu had told 
Assad that the reforms were too slow and that this had created mistrust in the Syrian people, 
in the region and in the international community. He had made promises that he had not 
fulfilled and Davutoglu intimated to Assad that the time to act was now. He also underlined 
that there was no more patience in the region or in the international community. He also 
mentioned that the pressure in the Security Council was rising. Davutoglu said that nobody 
could understand why Assad would launch a military operation on llama, a densely 
populated town, during the holy Muslim month. When Assad explained that the operation 
was in response to armed groups operations that had killed several police officers, Davutoglu 
had replied that it was fine to take measures to protect the police, but that he needed to 
choose more appropriate means of doing it. He reminded Assad that today, the humanitarian 
and human rights situation were not matter of national sovereignty. He also pointed out that 
nobody believed Assad's narrative on the Hama attack and that the only way for him to 
regain credibility was to let in an international commission. 
During the tete-it-tete, the Foreign Minister had told the President that he had been 
worried for a while, but that he was even more worried then. He told Assad he had two 
alternatives: The first alternative was to implement reforms that he needed to announce 
immediately, with a strict timetable. The Turkish Government was ready to support such a 
process — not the President but the process — and to talk to the opposition. The second 
alternative was to continue like this, but that this would lead to the international community 
isolating him, like Saddam Hussein and Colonel ICaddafi were isolated. The Security Council 
was worried. Several members had been calling Turkey seeking their advice. So far, they had 
been told to hold off, but there was a limit and Turkey would not tell them to wait anymore. 
Turkey could not tolerate such violence right next door. Davutoglu specified measures that 
Assad would need to take: withdraw tanks from Hama — Assad agreed; let international 
media in — Assad agreed, but Turkish media first. At this point, the Foreign Minister objected 
EFTA_R1_02036874 
EFTA02693330

to the idea of Turkish media being allowed first and insisted that all the international media 
should be allowed at the same time. Mr. Davutoglu also suggested that the President 
undertake significant legal reforms, based on a draft that Turkey would provide; conduct 
elections for a new Parliament that would draft a new constitution. At the end of the process, 
a referendum would be held. Assad would need to be ready to leave power. He also reiterated 
that Assad would need to make a public speech very soon explaining these measures and 
committing to a specific timeframe. Assad agreed, but asked that Turkey refrain from making 
any announcement before he had a chance to talk to the Beath part and to the opposition. He 
didn't want to look like he was making these reforms under pressure from Turkey. Davutoglu 
and Assad had then agreed on clear roadmap along these lines. The Turks had then been in 
touch with a number of countries, such as US, France, Russia and Egypt, to tell them about 
the agreement and to hold off further measures for a few days. 
For the first few days, Assad had implemented the measures they had agreed to. He 
withdrew the tanks from Hama (the Turkish Ambassador had been able to go and witness it 
for himself); and the media had been allowed in Syria, even to Hama. This had led him to 
make a positive statement. However, since then, there had been reports of tanks being 
deployed to llama again, and of a new operation in Latakia that was even worse than the one 
in Hama. Secretary Clinton and President Obama had been in contact with the Turkish 
Government to inform them that President Obama was about to make a speech on Thursday 
in which he would call for Assad's departure. Prime Minister Erdogan had called President 
Assad to express his concerns about the situation and to encourage him to make his speech as 
soon as possible. Assad said he would talk to Beath on Thursday and make his speech on 
Sunday. The Prime Minister had indicated that Sunday was too late, and that he would not 
have any credibility after Obama had made his speech. 
Foreign Minister Davutoglu said that it would be good if the Secretary-General could 
talk to President Assad to encourage him to make his speech tomorrow [Wednesday). He 
could tell Assad that he had been briefed on the agreed roadmap by Davutoglu, and that the 
pressure in the international community was rising. Davutoglu indicated that if Assad didn't 
make his speech and didn't implement the roadmap, he was worried. Turkey would not stay 
silent anymore. The credibility of the international community was on the line, the Syrian 
people was suffering. Their Ambassador had heard very sad stories when he had visited 
Hama. The human rights situation was very serious throughout Syria. He was also very 
concerned about the attack on Latakia, as it was apparently even worst than the attack on 
Hama (Turkey had sent people there). Davutoglu said he didn't believe any statement or 
information that came out of Syria anymore, as they issued contradictory information. He 
also didn't believe that President Assad knew all the details of all the operations. Davutoglu 
reiterated his concern about the human rights situation throughout the country and 
encouraged the UN to send a mis
