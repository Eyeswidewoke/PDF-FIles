Just wanted you to understand my fee structure, which is very transp=rent. You pay bills from vendors directly, net price plus tax. <=iv classe"> For my fees on all paid invoices: I charge 30% on invoices up to 50k= 20% on invoices over 50k. For all antiques I charge a flat 10% on all paid=invoices. I don0=800t charge for time but as there is much research and legwork to begin I=have a flat engagement fee of $35,000. Judging from your recent acquisitions for the li=ing room I feel that some Brazilian 1950s style pieces could seem organic i= the rooms with the right textiles and colors; could be quite chic and fres= with the existing architecture. qdiv> I should have the proposal from Budd Woodworking soon a=d am very confident that they will execute the soundproof door to perfectio=. Yours tru=y, Stephen <=div> EFTA_R1_01208534 EFTA02314996 2 EFTA_R1_0 1208535 EFTA02314997 |
