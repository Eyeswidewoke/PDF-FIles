When love begins to sicken and decay it uses an enforced ceremony. [Julius Caesar) Christmas waves a magic wand over this world, and behold, everything is softer and more beautiful. The primary use of conversation is to satisfy the impulse to talk. For virtue's self may too much zeal be had the worst of madmen is a saint run mad. The poor man who enters into a partnership with one who is rich makes a risky venture. I do not believe in a fate that falls on men however they act but I do believe in a fate that falls on them unless they act. To give pain is the tyranny to make happy, the true empire of beauty. Eschew the monumental. Shun the Epic. All the guys who can paint great big pictures can paint great small ones. Study men, not historians. It is more shameful to distrust our friends than to be deceived by them. EFTA_R1_01278945 EFTA02332761 |
