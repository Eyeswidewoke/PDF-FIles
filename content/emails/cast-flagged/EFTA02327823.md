Ok...that is what I thought... all went just fine yesterday! we did not get the sushi in house until =2:15, but it gave JE and Peter time to talk before having =unch....Jeffrey was totally happy!

Unfortunately most of those sushi places =ou see on seamless, like Ko sushi and others are very different quality =nd I would not be comfortable serving it to Jeffrey or his guests. =tlantic grill and Kappo Masa are some of the few better option open for =unch time in our neighborhood, Tao also opens at 11:30. There are some =ery good sushi places like Sushi of Gari, Tanoshi, Sushi Ishikawa, =ushi Seki that are only open for dinner, and out of these place only =ushi of Gari and Sushi Seki actually accept take out orders. With that =aid, I would love to have more good quality take out options for lunch, =nd if I find something else, I will definitely let you know. > How did it go with the lunch yesterday?
