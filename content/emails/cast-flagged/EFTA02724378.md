Why Iran's presence in Geneva II is 
critical for any progress 
Rami G. Ithouri 
21 Jan 2014 -- The fierce diplomatic controversy that erupted 
Monday over UN Secretary-General Ban-ki Moon's 
announcement that he had invited - and subsequently disinvited -
Iran to attend this week's Geneva II talks on exploring ways to 
end the Syrian conflict, highlights the contradictory regional and 
international complexities that define this situation: Foreign 
interventions in Syria have helped bring this war to its terrible 
EFTA_R1_02211 206 
EFTA02724379

current situation, and yet only robust international engagement 
can offer any hope of winding it down. 
The easy answer to the question of whether Iran should attend 
the Geneva meetings is a straightforward and emphatic "yes", 
because Iran's assistance to the Syrian government headed by 
President Bashar al-Assad is crucial for keeping the Damascus 
government in place. Yet nothing is easy when it comes to 
finding a diplomatic solution to the war in Syria, because the 
matter of Iranian involvement raises more vexing issues related 
to regional and international confrontations that bind the United 
States, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Israel, Hizbullah and others 
in an intense ideological struggle to define the character and 
condition of the region. 
A sub-plot of the debate about whether Iran should be invited to 
Geneva without preconditions, or only after it accepts the 
conditions laid down by the US and its allies, revives long-
standing Iranian determination to be treated with respect and not 
to have its sovereign rights mangled by foreign powers. 
The Iranian government logically must participate in the Geneva 
talks because its role in Syria is central to developments in that 
war; and what happens in Syria is deeply linked to, and will 
influence, future developments across much of the Middle East, 
which in turn will shape the influence of the US, Russia and 
Saudi Arabia across the region. Iran's central role in Syria 
mirrors, and is part of, its wider positioning and influence across 
the Middle East, so it is deeply invested in the current and future 
condition of the Assad government. 
Iran has shown beyond doubt that it is prepared to go to great 
EFTA_R1_02211 207 
EFTA02724380

lengths and expend much money, arms, troops, and political 
support to maintain Assad's incumbency, even if only over half a 
country that will emerge from the war deeply wounded and 
polarised. Iran's relations with Syria and Hizbullah in Lebanon 
are the most tangible and lasting regional successes of the 
Islamic revolution that overthrew the Shah in 1979. A strong 
political relationship with Damascus is critical for Iran's 
continued tight alliance with Hizbullah. 
These three actors form the "Deterrence and Resistance Front" 
that seeks to check or roll back the influence of the US and 
Israel in the region, while also assisting local actors in other 
countries that join it in confronting the policies of Saudi Arabia 
across the region. The overthrow of the Assad government 
would be a major blow to Iran's regional network of allies and 
would seriously weaken its stature and influence across the 
Middle East. It would probably also embolden Saudi Arabia and 
others, who fear Tehran's links with Shiite Arab populations, to 
step up their political confrontations with Iran in countries like 
Lebanon, Iraq, Yemen and Bahrain. 
It seems naive to think that a political agreement can be reached 
to establish a post-Assad transitional process in Syria without 
Iran's active involvement or assent, which is not likely to happen 
now. Iran's continued robust support to fortify the Assad 
government - directly and via its close ally Hizbullah - indicates 
that it is not willing today to sacrifice Assad's rule as part of a 
peace agreement in Syria. 
Iranian policy, like Syria's and Hizbullah's, is based on the 
principle of active resistance and sacrifice in the face of what it 
sees as American-Israeli-Saudi desires to smash the Syrian-
EFTA_R1_02211 208 
EFTA02724381

Iranian-Hizbullah alliance and re-order the region according to 
the interests of the US and its allies. 
So Tehran seems willing to continue supporting Assad at almost 
any cost, which is why a Geneva process that excludes it is 
bound to fail. Like Russia, Iran says that the future of the 
governance system in Syria must be decided by the Syrian 
people, not by American or Arab convictions that the Assad 
government has lost its legitimacy and must be brought down. 
Should American and other support for anti-Assad rebels 
succeed in further weakening and toppling the government in 
Damascus, Iran would join Russia and others in fearing that this 
would open the path to Washington unilaterally deciding the 
fate of other Arab or Iranian governments or non-governmental 
groups such as Hizbullah and Hamas. 
It is not clear what positions Iran would take at the Geneva talks, 
but it is fair to assume that its acceptance of any transitional 
governing arrangements in Syria would expect that Assad and 
his co-rulers in the country would be part of that process, and 
not its first discarded political relics. This is based on the 
assumption in Tehran that Assad will not be overthrown by 
force. The wider question that remains actively discussed around 
the region is how Iran would react should Assad start to lose 
ground militarily to strengthened opposition forces, and reach a 
point in the year ahead where his demise appeared imminent. 
Would Iran cut its losses, drop Assad as a lost cause and focus 
instead on maintaining Hizbullah's strength and influence in 
Lebanon? Would Iran eventually sacrifice Assad gracefully for 
the bigger prize of the US and Saudi Arabia accepting it as an 
equal strategic player and even a partner in the Gulf region, 
especially in the wake of a successful Iranian nuclear

EFTA02724382

power/sanctions lifting process? 
We will have to wait for answers to these hypothetical questions, 
but there is no doubt that Iran's substantial influence in Syria, 
Lebanon and Iraq is vital for any successful outcomes in Geneva -
and, more importantly, that its influence across much of the 
region could sabotage any moves on Syria that it does not 
explicitly approve and help define.

Obama's Foreign Policy to Nowhere 
James Jay Carafano 
January 21, 2014 -- Sir Hew Strachan, an advisor to the Chief of 
the British Defense Staff, made some ripples across the pond 
with his judgment [3] on the U.S. president's foreign policy. 
"Obama has no sense of what he wants to do in the world," 
Strachan said. 
Coming from a world-class military historian, it was a stunning 
EFTA_R1_02211210 
EFTA02724383

rebuke. 
Strachan gives Mr. Obama's Middle East policy, specifically his 
muddled approach to Syria, two thumbs down. Obama's 
initiative there, he says, has taken the situation on the ground 
"backwards instead of forwards." That's just one conclusion he 
delivers in his forthcoming book, The Direction of War, which 
evaluates how modern political leaders utilize strategy. 
Portraying Obama as the Inspector Clouseau of foreign policy 
may pump Strachan's book sales. (After all, it worked for Gates.) 
But his assessment seems a bit off the mark. 
Since the start of his second term, Mr. Obama has exhibited a 
pretty clear idea of what he wants to do in the world—and that is 
to have as little as possible to do with it until he gets out of 
office. The President's primary objective appears to be "no more 
Benghazis"—just ride out the second term, go build a library, 
and then mimic the line of his first former defense secretary: 
"Hey, everything was fine when I left!" 
A penchant for risk-aversion seems to be the chief hallmark of 
U.S. foreign policy today. The "red line" over Syria's use of 
chemical weapons, a particular target of Strachan's academic 
scorn, is a case in point. It was a way of doing nothing [4] about 
that nation's spiraling civil war. No one appeared more 
unprepared than the president when it turned out that the red 
line would actually require the U.S. to get engaged. Likewise, 
leaping at the chemical weapons deal was all too predictable. It 
offered the White House a quick exit from getting drawn more 
deeply into the conflict. 
But Obama faces an enduring dilemma. As Syria showed, while 
EFTA_R1_02211211 
EFTA02724384

he might want to leave the world alone, the world doesn't seem 
to feel the same way about the United States. There is just too 
much time left in office to coast till the end, pack up the Nobel 
Prize, and move back to Hawaii. The Oval Office has found it 
has to do something to fill the vacuum, opening space for other 
influences to drive foreign affairs—as long as they don't push 
the president too far from his chosen path. 
So a second vector has sprouted up to drive the direction of U.S. 
foreign policy, o
