A quick question for you...not sure if your =ervices would include something like this...but it is possible Jeffrey =ould like to attend the DEF CON conference at the Rio on Saturday =ug.lst ...we are told tickets can be purchased only with cash at the =oor. Tickets are available on Thurs and Fri but we have no one in =egas to go and purchase tickets for us (apparently, the line will be =uite long FYI)...do you have someone on staff that does this sort of =rrand thing?
