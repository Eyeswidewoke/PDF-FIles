| **To** | Karina Shuliak Dear group leader,, =/div>thank you for taking the time yesterday to discuss with me an issue=C2 that I have been trying to understand now for weeks,- namely the gra=uation requirement that is referred to as the "encounter rate&q=ot;. I am still perplexed as to how this number is calcu=ated and would appreciate a written explanation of its formula so that i m=y adjust my schedule as needed. I understood from our conversation t=at it is a computer generated number , but without the details find =t difficult to make the necessary course correction. With your=help, I would like to map out a schedule to enable me to comply with all g=aduation requirements so that I may be certain to meet them on time.=At the least , it seems highly questionable that If patients cancel =heir appointments , especially at the last minute , that their irresponsib=lity should in any way have a negative impact on my performance rating. =AO I look forward to receiving your response a=d am willing to meet at any time convenient for you. pleas= note The information contained in this communication is confid=ntial, may be attorney-client privileged, may constitute inside informa=ion, and is intended only for the use of the addressee.
