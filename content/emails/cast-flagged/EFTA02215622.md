You specifically emailed Sultan on May 23, 2017, to find out the use of the 30 kits (you say due to the size of the order you need to find out the intended use foe the kits). He would like to give the kits to his co-workders so they too may enjoy investigating their ancestry (Sultan participated with his own DNA and found it fascinating...he wants the people he works with to participate as well) The kits are to be delivered to: EFTA_R1_00943828 EFTA02215623 Jeffrey Epstein 9 East 71st Street NY, NY 10021 The kits are to be delivered to Jeffreys address for ease. We have ordered many kits ourselves as gifts...indeed, Sultan received his personal kit from Jeffrey as a gift. The kits were paid for by Jim Miller who is Sultan's Personal Assistant. Jim has a supplementary credit carc that is linked to Sultan's account so he can make purchases in Sultan's name. Please advise what, if any, other information you would like so we may have the kits shipped as soon as possible. If we need to make an entire new order, please let me know so we may do so.
