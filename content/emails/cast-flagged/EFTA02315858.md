I appreciate it, it is ve=y helpful! > On Apr 30, 2019, at 10:33 AM, wrote: > Hi Karyna...below is from Natasha when I requested she explain to me=how it all works re Amex points and Mileage upgrades. > When I booked your AF flights and Jeffrey wanted me to upgrade I had to fi=st create an account with AF for Jeffrey. We then had to find out if your f=ight was available for upgrade since there are only a few seats on each fli=ht available for mileage upgrades. Once it was confirmed there was a seat a=ailable to upgrade with mileage points, Natasha transferred the Amex points=to the account I had set up...you want to confirm there is an actual s=at first because once the points are converted to mileage with the airline t=ey are not reversible (they can't go back to Amex points). The tra=sfer is immediate however so that is good. I will say it is easier to upgr=de with Amex points and just have Natasha do it! We always get 20% of the p=ints back in a few billing cycles. We can pay for an economy or premium ec=nomy seat then upgrade with Amex points. Example goes like this: If the p=emium economy seat is $6000 and the Biz/First class seat is $10,000, we pay=in real money the $6000 then the difference in price from premium economy t= biz/first is $4000. The $4000 is converted to 400,000 points (4000x100). =Also, we would get money back to our account, not points, if you don'= use a ticket...so it is actually OK if you don't wind up tak=ng a flight in the end! At least we get some money back. :) Lesley > To pay with points for upgrade - you book coach ticket and pay difference i= fare (plus possible change fee) in points. Or you pay for business/first c=ass ticket partially with points (20% back), let's say you pay coach value w=th money and the rest - difference - in points, to avoid change fee. > 1.00 = 100 points. > Other option - to transfer American Express points to the airline and get m=leage upgrade (we can transfer points to certain airlines), 1 point = 1 m=les. But mileage upgrade could be tricky, has to be available, sometimes it=is not the lowest fare to be upgradable and sometimes you have to do it you=self (with certain airlines), but I can transfer points. <?xml version=.0" encoding=TF-8"?> <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"> <plist version=.0"> <dict> <key>conversation-idgkey> <integer>51177</integer> <key>date-last-viewed</key> <integer>0</integer> <key>date-received</key> <integer>1556639044</integer> <key>flags</key> <integer>8590195713</integer> EFTA_R1_01212519 EFTA02315858 <key>remote-ick/key> <string>15787</string> </dict> </plist> 2 EFTA_R1_01212520 EFTA02315859 |
