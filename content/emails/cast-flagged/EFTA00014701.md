As the Court explained, "[t]he length of the investigation, the investigative techniques used, and the fact that the defendant was not initially a target of the 4 EFTA00014704 investigation are all irrelevant" to Ms. Maxwell's guilt. Id. at 19 (quoting United States v. Duncan, No. 18-CR-289, 2019 WL 2210663 (S.D.N.Y. 2019)).

The Court concludes that the expected topics of Gershman's testimony—investigation, witness preparation, media contact, being neutral and accurate, and relationships with victims-all fall within the rubric of attacking the thoroughness of the investigation rather than being probative of Ms. Maxwell's guilt of the crimes charged.

> gative techniques are relevant to guilt, it would conflict with the Court's anticipated jury instruction that the Government is not on trial, it would substantially delay the trial, and it would, at most, be cumulative of the Defense's arguments that there is inadequate evidence on which to find Ms. Maxwell guilty. Indeed, placing an expert imprimatur on these arguments would only enhance the Rule 403 prejudice. Third, apart from Rule 401 and 403, the Defense's disclosure of Gershman does not satisfy Rule 16. The Defense has listed only the general topics on which Gershman will testify, like "inve
