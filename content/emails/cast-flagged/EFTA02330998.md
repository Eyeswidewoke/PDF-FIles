So you are not taking the white lacquer cabinet and the blinds? Thank you, Karyna.

Steven (our drive who went with her last time) could come pick them up late morning on Friday. Would that be a convenient time for him to come? If you feel you don't need to be there (like last time) he could just go up and get the stuff. Just let me know what you are most comfortable with. Thanks. Kim 2 EFTA_R1_01263544 EFTA02330999 |
