The =awyers dont know where to begin as well, as the date in the contract =efers to August of 2017. So this contract was =rafted years ago and it appears no one was willing to sign, is that =orrect?

I am sure you are aware that this "real estate =ontract" is highly irregular for Americans. =. It is not a real estate contract, it is a purchase of an =ffshore entity, creating many complexities for americans. =nbsp; 2. =here was never any discussion about real estate fees on top of the =rice. We have bought many properties, including through Christies and a =ommission was always paid by seller. 3. The due diligence on a lichtenstein co. will =ake months. 2 EFTA_R1_01204555 EFTA02313818 4. We =ould have to be indemnified for all taxes due to morroccan =overnment on transfer and unknown liabiltiles of the co., especially as =ou might imagine, this purchase would be very high =rofile. 5. Is =here a title on file? who would guarantee title transfer? If Christies =s willing that might work. 6. We were hoping for a quick closing. With this structure it =s not possible, and money would need to be withheld for years to back =p the indemnity. It is very disappointing. We are told that =iabilties would extend approx 7 years, so a payment of 10m day one and = milliion per year for 8 years might work. There clearly is no perfect =itle transfer under your proposed structure. Four jurisdictions, =eal estate and corporate and disclosure rules in each. Can you make a =uggestion? Thank =ou.

We=have a list of what items he intends to remove - it is not much but for =xample there is a Gauguin in the bedroom which of course he will remove = I will get this list and sent it to you. It is not possible to only buy the =sset and it does save you 7% in government taxes - your lawyers can =heck the company has no liabilities but I assure you anyway it =oesn't.
