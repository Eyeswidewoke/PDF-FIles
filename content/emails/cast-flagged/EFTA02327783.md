| **Subject** | Re: sushi for lunch-where do you order from?! Hi Karyna...l think when you return we should work on a sushi =estaurant that opens at 11am around here. The 11:30am start time is =ard to have something here at noon...I see KO Sushi opens at 11am =70th and 2nd Ave)...perhaps you could have a look at menu and =est it out. I would hate to order from here and it be lousy! Just =omething to think about... I pulled up the menu for KO Sushi on Seemless web... Hope you are having fun with your parents! > On Nov 27, 2017, at 10:13 AM, Karyna Shuliak > wrote: > Hi Lesley, > Yes, 12pm is a tricky time for sushi. I don't know of any =ther decent sushi around that opens earlier then Atlantic grill. =ometimes we did Kappo Masa for lunch, but they open at 12pm. Atlantic =rill usually takes 30 min to get the order ready, meaning they would =ave it ready for pick up around 12pm... > In regards to the list, you mean other restaurants to order from, it =o you need a list for Atlantic Grill? » On Nov 27, 2017, at 9:49 AM, Lesley Groff < > =rote: » Hi Karyna...we need to order some sushi for a 12pm lunch =oday....do you still order from Atlantic Grill? or where does JE =ike sushi from these days? Atlantic Grill kitchen doesn't open =ntil 11:30am which makes getting sushi here for noon difficult... >> » Also, if you could provide me a list of what he is liking these days =hat would be helpful also. <?xml version=.0" encoding=TF-8"?> <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/Propertylist-1.0.dtd"> <plist version=.0"> <dict> <key>conversation-id</key> <integer>6196</integer> <key>date-last-viewed</key> <integer>0</integer> <key>date-received</key> <integer>1511883392</integer> <key>flags</key> <integer>8590195717</integer> <key>remote-id</key> <string>65442</string> EFTA_R1_01252458 EFTA02327783 </dict> </plist> 2 EFTA_R1_01252459 EFTA02327784 |
