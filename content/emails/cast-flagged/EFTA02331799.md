Attached is a photo of what I need done. I =eed a new unit made to cover the radiator and AC in my living room. I =ave the design idea already. I'd like to lift the height of this so it =omes out at the same level as the window sill, it will need to have 3 =rates going across to let in the heat that are removable to access the =adiator and AC. I would like the AC to have a nicer enclosure because =hen I use the AC, I have to take the grate off for the air to circulate =etter and I'd like it to look decent when the grate is off as well. I =ant to use a white Caesar stone(or white Zodiaq) for the top piece and =he rest just a white lacquer. I also thought perhaps there could be =mall drawers on the top part above the radiator and AC to utilize the =mpty space there. I also have a friend in the same building as mine who wants her cover =eplaced as well. Her apt is just like mine, so perhaps you could have a =ook at hers as well when you come over. My address i n the corner of am in the city all weekend and next week, so please =et me know when a good time to meet is. Thanks! 1 EFTA_R1_01265582 EFTA02331799 |
