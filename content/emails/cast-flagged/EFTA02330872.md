Hi Karyna...I have spoken with Natasha and our plan is to actually =urchase your round trip ticket to St. Barth's tomorrow (Friday) then =ave it voided on Monday after your embassy appointment...as I had =iscussed with you, since the weekend doesn't count for tickets, Monday =e can simply VOID the ticket and nothing will be charged... I will be sure to circle back to Natasha tomorrow to 'book' the ticket, =hen again on monday to 'void' the ticket <?xml version=.0" encoding=TF-8"?> <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "I/Apple/MTh KIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/Propertylist-1.0.dtd"> <plist version=.0"> <dict> <key>conversation-id</key> <integer>14475</integer> <key>date-last-viewed</key> <integer>0</integer> <key>date-received</key> <integer>1440690255</integer> <key>flags</key> <integer>8590195713</integer> <key>remote-id</key> <string>28148</string> </dict> </plist> 1 EFTA_R1_01263257 EFTA02330872 |
