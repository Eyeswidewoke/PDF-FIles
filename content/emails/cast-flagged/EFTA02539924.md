I need help steering a path 
Hi, 
on behalf of David Grosof 
I am still wowed -- and a bit cowed -- by the amazing favor you did in engaging Bill Gates' attention to OptiOpia and the 
challenge of providing corrective lenses to those who need it, profitably, sustainable and at scale. 
I have been quite distracted by the need to provision myself with a plan B, but am now steeling myself to go balls-out 
for a few months to raise money for OptiOpia and make this a successful enterprise. 
I'd love to talk with you soon. I could use some advice and encouragement, though I don't have anything very specific 
to ask. 
Good times to connect for me are: 
(times in Eastern Daylight Time): 
5:30 pm to 9 today, Friday 
noon to 4 pm (at least) Saturday, in and out anytime Sunday after noon most of the time from noon to 7:30 pm Monday 
When's a good time to call you, if you are in this hemisphere? 
And I've not been following science research headlines for the last few months: what's excited you recently? 
Cheers, 
David
