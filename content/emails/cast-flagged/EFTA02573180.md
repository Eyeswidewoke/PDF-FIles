FW: Connecting you 
PLEASE CALL ME ASAP 
Sorry - I sent last email before I was done with my writing. 
Last three weeks it bothered me that you/Larry might be under an impression=that it was not me that found Foundation 
Medicine but rather we all saw it=at KPBC at the same time. 
The reason that I knew about Foundation Medicine before KPBC summit is that=l was working with them on getting 
cancer sample sequenced. Also Eric Land=r told me a while ago. I was updating you and Nathan re their sequencing 
=fforts (email below) 
It was me that suggested Larry and Lila that we should also meet FM at KPBC=summit and even pushed for it before and 
after our meeting. 
I have a number of emails prior and after that summit. I am happy to forwa=d them to Larry/you if you would like. 
Perhaps it does not matter right now but I just wanted to clarify. 
Thank you 
Boris

HI Nathan, 
I just checked whether Foundation Medicine (FM) received tumor tissue for a=alysis, but as of today it still did not (see 
below). 
They tried everything to speed up but because some (unknown to me) reason, =t is going very slow.

You can see part of emails trails below • it has been weeks/months that we =re trying to obtain this tissue. 
I am just afraid that time is not on our side and that a critical window is=closing. 
Broad people tried to push Kaplan but there is a limit what they can do. 
Also as I do not know Kaplan and am not involved in her care, it would be g=eat if you can GENTLY see what else can be 
done that her tumor tissue is f=nally send out. 
Thank you!

I just checked, and the team (including CEO of Foundation Medicine) is on t=e lookout for the sample, but it's not yet 
arrived. I don't think there's =ore we can do. I've already pressed as hard as I feel comfortable.
