## Match Contexts

### Match 1
> h, I expect we'll want to talk through some additional specifics on travel, we'll talk more about other steps we'll be looking to take in our investigation for corroboration and what the appropriate timing and format of that would be, and to start to talk about specific conduct by Epstein and/or Maxwell to whatever extent is comfortable with that at this stage. And we'll also likely refresh on some other topics as well, but just to flag some of the more immediate areas we'll expect to cover. Let us know if it's useful to chat again before Monday, otherwise we'll see you then. >>> >>> thanks a
