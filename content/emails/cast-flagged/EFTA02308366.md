They muffin and coffee(with specifics on of service when guests are eating I purchased a printer today to print out menus for dinners as well as menus for JE to review and check off things that interest him so we can continue to dial in his palate and more of what he enjoys... Today I am getting account with the local butcher that Steve recommends, hopefully we can finally get some veal that JE likes. EFTA_R1_01187700 EFTA02308366 I'm working on getting a Costco card today so we can start purchasing things in bulk. We can have up to 6 cards per account so other people can use as well, like Lyn who does the buying and stocking for 71st. I also believe there is a Costco in west palm beach as well. Things like dry food items( flour, sugar, salt, soda, water) as well as cleaning products and paper goods we can buy in bulk here in NY and maybe even ship to island and save a bunch of money. Right now all the cleaning products for 71st are coming from the supermarket... We have a quote on the ice machine and I will call around to a few people today and see if they can beat the price. I still have a good amount of things to do here in NY i will keep you posted on. Thank you Francis Francis.l. Derby <mailto 2 EFTA_R1_01187701 EFTA02308367 |
