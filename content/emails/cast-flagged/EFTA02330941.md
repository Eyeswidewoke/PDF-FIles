I've scheduled Antoine Verglas the photographer for Monday the 20th. JE wants you guys to do a group shot that day to mimic the Helmut Newton photo below: <images.jpeg> If you have any similar clothes that will work for the shoot, let me know; suit, blazers, shoes, trench coat, etc.. otherwise I will need to source some things this weekend. Please let me know your schedule on Monday so I can figure out what time we should schedule this shot. Please all confirm!! thanks EFTA_R1_01263425 EFTA02330941 |
