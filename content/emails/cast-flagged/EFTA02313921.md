| **Subject** | Re: Bin Ennakhil Dear =arc, I sincerely appreciate your kind =esponse. 1. The authorities in Rabat told me the =ame thing and said they would reserve the right to charge me the =apital gains as well as the transfer tax. They said that the vendor is =rying to avoid tax and as it was I that was helping him I should pay =hat he owes. They said that many purchases happen as you suggest but =ot of such a substantial property. 2 The directors do not own the co the shareholder does, =o a change in directors is meaningless. 3. AML can be done at the last moment not the first. That is =illy. I have bought other properties and am intimately familiar with =he regulations. Your vendor transferred shares from a BVI co to a =tiftung with no paperwork shown to us. The values were obviously =ncorrect. I don't know what the cost basis of the house was so it was =ifficult to gauge capital gains on profits. I could buy the property =nd loan the owner the balance on day one to be repaid over four years =s the government allows. Thanks for =ou kindness.
