No need to put a cover sheet as the fax machine is on the desk of Dr. Scher's assistant Barbara and she will be expecting the fax. She is also asking if he will be bringing a glass pathology slide? <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/Propertylist-1.O.dtd"> <plist version="1.0"> <dict> <key>date-sent</key> <real>1350490411</real> <key>flags</key> <integer>862375014S</integer> <key>original-mailbox</key> <string>imap://sarahk525@mail.mac.com/INBOX</string> <key>remote-id</key> <string>4S050</string> <key>subject</key> <string>RE:</string> </diet> </plist> EFTA_R1_01210380 EFTA02315476 |
