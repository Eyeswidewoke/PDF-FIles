| **Subject** | Re: Jeffrey Epstein No problem! I hope to see Mr. Epstein very soon! Please let me know where/when would be most convenient for him. I'd be happy to come out to New York to see him if that's best. Or, if he's in the Boston area, I'd be sure to get him tickets to my next concert there! :) -Charlie > On Jun 8, 2017, at 10:29 AM, wrote: > > got it! thank you!
