Hi Rich, 
It was great chatting =ith you this morning. As I noted, Mort can make an investment in Ser=es 8 to have 
enough liquidation preference to cover both its common and pr=ferred investments. With an investment of just $1.25M 
in Series 8 wi=l result in Mort having a resulting total liquidation preference of $11.25=, to cover the previous $5M of 
common, $5M of preferred and new $1.25M inv=stments. 
In addition to the increased liquidation=preference, for the $1.25M, Mort will also receive an incremental 
677,244 =hares with all the upside of Jawbone equity. That equates to $1.85 p=r share. 
Detail of the structure is included in t=e attached document.

I've also include= a summary of the successful launch of our recent UP2 and UP3 products...AO It's been very

i spoke with Andrew Linsey, =nna and Will from Code Advisors as Hosain was unavailable last week 
on=y 5,000,000 of investment would be covered as this can only apply to prefe=red shares 
our investment in Series 5 was as foll=ws: 
Preferred 695,301 x 7.19113 = 5,000,000 
Common 1,260,233 x 3.96792 = 5,000,000 
I =as told on call that valuation of company at time of Series 5 was 1,650,00= post 
Series 6, 7, 8 and Blackrock note have further dilut=d our investment and although they would not give me an 
exact figure our n=w breakeven without Series 8 participation appears to be 3,250,000 
With Series 8 investment of 833,000 i believe believe we =ould receive the following on a sale of company post 
April 28 2016 
1,000,000 7,5=0,000 from preferred and 0 from common (0 received without Series 8) 
=div>2,000,000 7,500,000=from preferred and 0 from common (0 received without Series 8) 
3=000,000 7,500,000 from =referred and 0 from common (0 received without Series 8) 
3,250,0=0 7,500,000 from preferr=d and 5,000,000 from common (10,000,000 received without Series 8) 
it appears Series 8 protection provides protection from 1=000,000 to 3,250,000 on liquidation 
April 28 2016 is key date as =t is 1 year anniversary of Blackrock investment and if company sold before=that 
date they have a 3x liquidation preference 
<=iv>As of last friday they have raised 33,000,000 of the 35,000,000 needed =or Blackrock to release final 
50,000,000 
If that is =chieved they would have raised since April 28 2015: 
220,000,000 Blackrock original note 
40,000,000 Series 8=1PM (34) and Sequia (6) 
50,000,000 Blackrock additional<Aiv> 
35,000,000 Series 8 (33mm raised to date) 
50,0=0,000 Blackrock final 
395,000,000 To=al raised

EFTA02486997

As of Sep 11, 2015 there=cash flow was as follows: 
30,000,000 in cash40=A0 
85,000,000 (Series 8 and final Blackrock) 
115,000,000 potential cash 
Once 85,000,000 is s=cured they will finalize deal for an ABL credit line in the amount of 50,0=0,000 that will be 
collateralized by AR and Inventory 
=div>They mentioned that Q4 would be cash flow positive however they did no= elaborate on what their loss for 
2015 or 2016 would be.. 
When i=pressed them and said i thought they would would be out of money by mid 20=6 and we again may be 
further diluted with a Series 9 or 10 they responded=that they had new management that would not allow this 
They said Jason Child, new CFO, has already run analysis to ensure th=t they remain cash flow positive in 2016 
Not sure that is so rea=istic as they also mentioned that Fitbit already has market share and that=they will not 
chase market share via lower pricing or marketing 
=n addition they will not build large inventories with vendors if they need=to conserve cash 
Andrew stated that Hosain made poor non financi=lly focused decisions and new CFO will not allow that moving 
forward =/div> 
Jawbone believes it will be the leader in the next phase which w=ll evolve from basic wellness to health and 
medical (blood pressure, respi=ation and oxidation) 
Analogy was used that basic wellness market=is similar to Smartphones in the early 2000's and Symbian who 
was =eader disappeared 
My concerns are as follo=s: 
a) Jawbone is always one step behind and they keep jumping to=the next Hot idea.. 
b) There will inevitably be a Series 9 / 10 =ound as i believe they will again run out of cash middle of next year 
caus=ng further dilution to Series 8 they are asking us to participate in 
=div> 
Andrew also sent email with codes for free UP 2 or=UP 3 product 
I will order and have for you on your next visit (d= you have a color preference - black, silver, indigo and red?)

Please advise how you want to proceed with Series 8 proposed investm=nt of 833,000 
Thank you
