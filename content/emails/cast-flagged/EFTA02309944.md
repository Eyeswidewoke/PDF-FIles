The standing lamp in th= living room, that is closer to the large artwork, is working if you manual=y turn on the switch, but is not connected to the wall switch. I left that l=mp on for you to see. The second standing lamp close to the entra=ce door is connected to the wall dimmer switch, but one of the light bulbs i= off. Also one of the bedside lamps is not working. </=iv> Merwin, could you please kindly address these three issues tomorrow=along with the internet issue: 1. Replace the non-working light b=lb in the standing lamp close to the entry 2. Connect the second s=anding lamp, so that it is controlled from the dimmer switch, like the othe= one. 3. Check on the non-working bedside lamp Thank you very much!
