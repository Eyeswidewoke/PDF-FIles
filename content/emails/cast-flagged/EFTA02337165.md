| **Subject** | Re: I tried Richardson again this afternoo= since I did not get a return call but no answer. I'm not entirely su=e that having Randy involved will help rather than hinder the cause at this=point in the process. I would prefer that we wait to get confirmation=that there is absolutely nothing left to do with her file. Randy is=not exactly a light touch or diplomatic and I don't want the board members t= feel that they are threatened into approving Karyna. I will call everyday a=d I will call Donald as well. Please note that the board members are n=t Gov't employees. With that said, it's obviously your decision re c=lling Randy. With warm regards, Cecile Sent from my iPhone and misspellings courtesy of i=hone.
