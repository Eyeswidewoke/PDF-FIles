In particular, this passage: 
A major shift is underway in the developing world, in which deaths fro= communicable diseases like malaria 
<http://health.nytimes.comThealthiguides/disease/malaria/over=iew.html?inline=nyt-classifier> and tuberculosis have 
declined sharply, and chronic diseases like cancer 
<http://health.nytimes.coghealthiguides/disease/cancer/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier> and diabetes are on the 
rise. The pattern is linked to economic improvement an= more people living longer, but it has left governments in 
developing coun=ries scrambling to deal with new and often more expensive ways to treat il=nesses. 
The study, led by the Inst=tute for Health Metrics and Evaluation <http://www.healthdata.orgh, , a research group, was 
funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. It is the largest analysis of glo=al disability data to date, drawing on 
more than 35,000 data sources in 18= countries. 
Given that (1) BMGF funds this and i= obviously aware of this shift, and (2) that the influx of western diets i=to 
developing worlds is 99.9% likely the driver of this phenomenon, do you think Bill G would be interested in our work? 
I have never put much effort into this, assuming there was no chance given =ack of overlap. 
But...this has me wondering.
