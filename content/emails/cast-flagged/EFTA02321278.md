He is asking me for an estimate as to when they wi=I arrive the Virgin Islands. Also, I know I gave you a shipping address for=Florida. Are the rugs coming from overseas? If so, i think it makes more se=se to have them shipped straight to St. Thomas, USVI. Please let me know! T=ank you! !=?xml version=.0" encoding=IF-8"?> <IDOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/Propertylist-1.0.dtd"> <plist version=.0"> <dict> <key>flags</key> <integer>8590195713</integer> <key>original-mailboxgkey> <string>imap:amail.mac.com/Sent%20Messagesgstring> <key>remote-id</key> <string>3665</string> </dict> </plist> EFTA_R1_01231373 EFTA02321278 |
