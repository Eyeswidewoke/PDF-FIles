As pan of the plea deal, federal investigators agreed to drop their 
pending investigation of Epstein, which they had taken to a grand jury, 
two law enforcement sources said. 
Epstein was indicted two yeast ago following an I I -month investigation 
by Palm Beach poke after they received a complaint from the relative 
of a 14-year-old girl who had given him a naked massage at his five-
bedmom, 7234-square-foot, 58.5 million Intracoastal home. 
Police concluded that there were several other young girls brought in 
2004 and 2005 to an upstairs room at the home for similar massages and 
sexual touching. 
The indictment charged Epstein only with felony solicitation of 
prostitution. The stale attorney's office late added the addaional charge 
of procuring underage girls for that purpose. 
Prosecutor henna Bebhlavek said of the plea: 1 took into consideration 
the length the trial would have been and witnesses having to testify" 
about sometimes embarrassing incidents 
On the beat, behind the agenda: Post reporters cover your area in city P,ulse, Epstein may have made a serious mistake soon after he was charged. He 
was offered and accepted, then rejected, an offer to plead guilty to one 
count of aggravated assault with intent to commit a felony, according to 
police documents. He would have gotten five years' probation, had no 
criminal record and not been a registered sex offender, the documents 
indicate.

The foundation was incorporated in November and lists its address as Goldbetger's West Palm Beachoffice. Epstein said he already has awarded 
money to Harvard and MIT. 
When he is released from jail. there is a chance that Epstein will be forced to move. Sex offenders are not allowed to live within 1.000 feet of a 
school park or other areas where children may gather. No determination has been made as to whether Epstem's home complies, but attorneys said it 
likely does. 
Sex offenders also typically must attend couwel ins sessions. Belohla vek said that was waived for Epstein because his private psychiatrist is working 
with him. Judge Pao go was skeptical, but agreed to it. 
Epstein's conduct with underage girls doesn't end with today's plea. There are four pending federal civil lawsuits and one in state court related to his 
behavior. At least one woman has sued him in Ncw York. where he owns a 51,000 sq uare-foot Manhattan mansion. 
"We think this is an extremely important event that will help the civil cases: said Miami attorney Jeffrey Herman, who represents the alleged victims 
in the federal lawsuits. ifs validation of what we're saying in the eivi cases? 
West Palm Beach attorney Ted Leopold represents one alleged victim in a civil suit in state court. He said he anticipates amending that lawsuit to add 
"a few other clients' as well. 
In the criminal case, police went so far as to scour Epstein's trash and conduct surveillance at Palm Beach International Airport, where they watched 
for his private jet so they would know when he was in town. They concluded that Epstein paid girls $200 to 5300 each after the massage session 
"fm like a Heidi Fleiss," Haley Robson, now 22. told police about her efforts in recruiting teenage girls for Epstein. 
There was probable cause to charge Epstein with unlawful sex acts with a minor and lewd and lascivious molestation, police concluded. They also 
wanted charges brought against Robson and a woman who was Epstein's personal assistant. They were not charged. 
The state attorneys office said that questions about the girls' credibility led it to take the unprecedented step of presenting the evidence against 
Epstein to a grand jury. rather than directly charging him. 
Palm Beach Police Chief Michael Reiter was furious with Slate Attorney Barry Krischer, saying in a May 2006 letter that the prosecutor should 
disqualify himself. "I continue to find your office's treatment of these cases highly unusual." he wrote. He then asked for and got a federal 
investigation. He did not maniacal' asking for comment 
Epstein hired a phalanx of high-priced lawyers • including Harvard law professor and author Alan Dershowits - and public relations people who 
questioned Rciteds competence and the victims' truthfulness. 
In addition to mansions in Palm Beach and Manhattan, Epstein owns homes in New Mexico and the Virgin Lslands lies a frequent comnbutor to 
Democratic Party canditioes. He also donated 530 million to Harvard University in 2003. 
Former New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer returned a 550,000 campaign contribution Rom Epstein after his indictment, then resigned this year amidst his 
own sex scandal And the same Palm Beach Poke Department that vigorously investigated Epstein returned his S90,000 donation for the purchase of 
a firers. simulator.
