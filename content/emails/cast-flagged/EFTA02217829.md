I was searching my Levitin emails for a manuscript invitation/guidelines Dan sent and am so glad I found this - I JUST had a conversation with a colleague in the Center for Music Innovation about this very topic! Imagine if you are admitted to the Ambulatory SurgiCenter for an epidural injection for intractable Sciatica and thinking it meant a virtual trip to Tahiti instead of days if high anxiety waiting to be called for the puncture?! I would love to get together and talk if you might still be interested. In general, I'm on the UCLA camps most Wednesdays and some Thursdays. Perhaps a lunch or tea at the Faculty Club one afternoon? Cheers, Mark On Wed, Oct 26, 2016 at 9:11 PM, Hi Daniel, Thanks so much for the intro! Hi Mark, wrote: Great to e-meet you and sorry for the delay in answering. It seems the Jewish holidays (and guests) made for a very fast few weeks! I would love to meet for a coffee and learn about your work. How does next week work for you? Thanks!!

I've just purchased your book on music and look forward to diving in. You mentioned introducing me to the music research group at UCLA. That would be terrific: my company, Maestro SPC, is developing an interactive Virtual Reality platform of conducting the orchestra - primarily for use in the education and health and wellness space. We arc keen to partner with neuroscience programs involved in both classical music and Virtual Reality therapy.
