Update 
Hi Jeffrey-
We're making progress refining the design and details, here's what I'm 
focusing on: 
1. Storm windows and shutters on east end, either side of east 
cabana. I think the original design we did had too much glass, 
I'm studying a few large windows & shutters instead of 
continuous glass. 
2. Developing window head detail with exposed beam at 
perimeter windows, a modern expression of structure and 
strength, instead of applied carved window head detail. 
3. Ceiling design at sitting areas on east end, both sides of 
cabana. Vaulted wood slat ceilings with soffits at ends (for 
more volume, dramatic lighting, ceiling fans), flat for rest of 
covered walkway. Guest pavilions will have similar ceilings and 
soffits, for lighting and mechanical ductwork requirements. 
4. Refining entry courtyard design, looking at paving patterns. I'm 
making the north-south axis stronger than in the SD package, 
and adding textures & paving 
5. Studying pool tile patterns and paving, how it will look from the 
air. 
6. Refining planters throughout, studying column base details 
connections/transitions 
7. Screening room interiors-refining acoustical wall panel design 
on back and side walls, refining millwork details 
8. Stair down-refining downward journey, arrival sequence and 
procession to screening room 
Overall I'm looking at every column, window , door, planter etc. to push 
the design further.

We will soon have an updated materials palette for you to review (samples 
and colored interior 3d renderings). 
We started consultant coordination, with structural, MEP, landscape and 
lighting. 
I'm meeting our AV consultant next week, we have been talking about the 
equipment and room design. His client list includes Oprah, Bill Gates, 
George Lucas and Joel Silver. I'll ask him to put together a preliminary 
equipment list with specs and cut sheets for you to review. 
I need another few days to update the 3d model with this information, I'll 
send you new images next week by Thursday at the latest. 
I'd also like to start personalizing the space for you, so if you have any 
large sculptures/artwork you'd like to feature (interior or exterior), let me 
know and we can work it into the design. 
Regards 
Bob
