First and most importantly, thank you for =lways supporting me. We usually disagree but in the end the right thing 
seems to happen and usually even with positive results. 
=br> 
I've got 2 more months on my C3 contract and=l've completed all the deliverables requested by Larry and the team. 
While there's=a lot to do and tons of projects they are tackling, I sense that they would prefer to k=ep me at a bit of 
distance and I understand. You understand too. I'm s= grateful to be at C3 and the quiet time to transition away from 
the Bank has been awesome, but it feels like a bunch of reports and recommendations aren..80fet enough and also 
perhaps more importantly that the staff/team want to own their wor= without my help. I suspect this is what Boris was 
facing. And also one of t=e reasons Lowell says he keeps a bit of distance. Either way - there'= much cooler and more 
important stuff to do. While there will always be politics =nd sensitivities, I want to minimize them. 
There are two things I'd like to pursue next=— the first as you know is to be the #goat ( :) 
But I need your help on the second part of "=ext." We have been discussing some of my crazy brain science ideas a lot of 
the last few years. One of the ideas has generated a lot of interest and I'm fee=ing a little overwhelmed at what to do 
next. Instead of jumping too early or selling out=too soon, I want to very quietly create and incubate the idea over a 9-
12 month period. Sort like Tony Pan did with his energy project, Modern Electron. 
Specifically, I'd like to create and incubat= a concept-driven company called Modern Neuron (J) over a 9-12 month 
period to file the intellectual property, create the appropriate legal framework(s), and begin to push a little deeper into

the science. The science is being performed elsewhere in the body (heart, liver= muscle) and I want to act quickly to own 
the neuro applications. My adviser= for the effort would and do include 2 Nobel laureates (Dr. Watson an= Dr. Buck), 
former NIMH director (Dr. Insel), former NCI director (Klausner), fo=mer DARPA director (Dr. Ling), and director of 
Focused Ultrasound Org (Dr. Kass=l). Another Nobel Laureate Dr. Greengard supports but is just too old now =2... The 
concept is very simple and with multiple applications but it does=require a bit more thinking on which immediate 
directions to take and what is require= to go to scale by leveraging what others are doing. Not yet how much mon=y I 
would need — not a lot since this is mostly administrative and early — but I would put=in my own resources and find 
others to pitch in alongside you — but my prefer=nce would be to keep this very small and quiet until the IP is secure. 
In 9-12 months (maybe sooner) there would be a go/no=go decision as to scale up, formalize, sell - or close down. It's 
impo=tant to me that great ideas get support, but also that there are role models for women in science= Never really 
wanted to be one but I keep standing in the background helping others. I want to try but I am still a big baby and don't 
want to t=y in a super public way quite yet - partly my own insecurity but also because if w= get this right it's gonna be 
important. That's why I am askin= you because I know you believe the same stuff (especially scale) but can also help me 
do this quie=ly, with tons of integrity and lots of support. I want to stay close and maybe even do great things. I love the 
way you helped Tony's idea come to life with Mod=rn Electron and I think we can do something similar as Modern 
Neuron. I want to talk to=you about the idea and all the science. Happy to check in with Larry after and =ee how he 
might incubate or extubate. 
I will send an email to you and Larry in a bit askin= for 1:1 time later month maybe also include an agenda. I know UNGA 
etc schedule gross and also that you are seeing Steven on Monday. Paul Allen stuff so awesome too you would have 
loved it. And Israel. And Dubai. 
Thank you ... and see you soon </a
