Therefore, I cannot show up this night as agreed with Peter and Jeffrey. Please express my deep apologies to JEFFREY and I look forward to meet him. I am really keen to do that. I will also report to Jean-Yves Ollivier and Peter Mandelson about this appointment cancellation. Sorry. Best regards Ri rR r N ELY 1 EFTA_R1_01236585 EFTA02323048 |
