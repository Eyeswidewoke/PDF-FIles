Here is the concert site: https://www.gardnermuseum.orgicalendadevent/charlie-albright- 20170917 It's the first of three concerts I'm giving there this season. It starts at 1:30pm on 9/17/2017 and is an hour-long concert. Should be all through by 2:30pm. I'm playing the Chopin Andante Spianato/Grande Polonaise Brilliants, and the Chopin Etudes, Op. 25. I have 2 tickets I've been saving...if Mr. Epstein can come I'd be honored to have him as my guest! Please let me know if he might be in the area that day- -Charlie On Sep 11, 2017, at 9:44 AM, wrote: Hi Charlie...hope you are well.
