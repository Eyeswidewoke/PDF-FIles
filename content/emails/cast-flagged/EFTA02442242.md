Dubai's Economic Woes Just Got Worse 
• By ANDREW CRITCHLOW 
Green shoots in the desert? Not so fast. Hopes that Dubai's economy was starting to recover have been 
dashed by Standard & Poor's, which has put six of the Gulf emirate's major government-related entities 
on negative watch ahead of a possible downgrade to junk. That creates fresh doubts about Dubai's 
ability to raise funds on the international markets, raising the possibility it will need another bailout from 
Abu Dhabi. 
S&P's move comes as a shock since it follows a barrage of recent reassuring statements from Dubai 
officials — including ruler Sheik Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum — that the emirate had its financial 
difficulties now under control. Earlier this year, Dubai secured a $20 billion emergency bailout program 
underwritten by the Abu Dhabi-based central bank. Abu Dhabi has already stumped up the first $10 
billion, with international investors expected to provide the rest. That no longer looks so likely. 
The S&P action suggests Dubai's economic problems could be much worse than initially thought. What 
prompted the effective downgrade was confirmation that real-estate developer Nakheel and parent 
company Dubai World, whose other investments include port operator DP World, may have to 
restructure their debts amid plummeting revenues. Foreign contractors have also complained of delays 
in payment. 
Bankers say that S&P's action was already priced into the market on Nakheel's debt and credit default 
swaps on Dubai's debt moved little after the downgrade threat. But this latest blow to confidence is 
bound to make intemational investors wary of subscribing to the second half of the $20 billion 
emergency bond program. 
That would leave Dubai with no option but to go back to Abu Dhabi for the rest of the money. But that 
won't be easy. Its larger neighbor has its own economic problems. Its sovereign wealth funds are losing 
money. Last week, Mubadala Development Co. acknowledged it lost more than $3 billion last year. And 
with oil prices rooted around $50 a barrel, Abu Dhabi will have to dip into its foreign reserves to help its 
federal partners. 
In the desert, green shoots often tum out to be mirages.
