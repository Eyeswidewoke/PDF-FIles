I finally got to speak to him about this matter. Yes, he did invest in the 
settlement fnd, but it was in a pooled context and it was brought to him by a 
third party money manager. He did not recall who. He did not know what 
settlements, specifically, he was investing in or anything about any nexus to 
you. Yes, JP invested too, but sr did not think that he had any specific 
knowledge that the money was earmarked for investment in specific settlements. To 
his knowledge there was diversification of risk as it was a pool of settlements. 
This was far from in the forefront of his mind and I did not want to push. I will 
if you want.
