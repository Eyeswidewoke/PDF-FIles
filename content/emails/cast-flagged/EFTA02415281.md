David Stern has given me your contact details. I am sorry to disturb you during 
the Thanksgiving Holiday. 
Basically, I was wondering if you had the address of the house that The Duke of 
York will be staying in next week. Also are you able to confirm whether there is 
room for both of his Protection Officers at the house? Julian Phillips one of 
the Protection Officers will arrive in the US on Sunday. 
Many thanks.
