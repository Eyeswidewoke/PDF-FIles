All of the previous correspondence between and Jeffrey's assistant, was private so am not sure they understood each other correctly if the ticket was requested by Jeffrey for Sunday. Just to avoid the inconvenience and confusion, I would like to let you know that she's aiming to go to the island on Saturday morning and come back Monday morning, if that's possible and is stilt awaiting for the approval. Please let me know if that's okay. <IMQ6968.JPG> Thank nH, 21 arsr. 2017 r. H 14:09, Hi May I please have passport details? Jeffrey would like me to purchase her a ticket to the island for this Sunday Aug. 27th. Thank you, EFTA_R1_00960048 EFTA02222422 |
