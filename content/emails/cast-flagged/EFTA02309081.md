| **Subject** | Re: Artistic Tile Thassos Good afternoon Molly, We would like to order 50 square feet of the white t=assos tile, that you gave me a sample of (picture below). Could you please=kindly let me know if you have it in stock and what would be the lead time= It would go to the same address as the shower tiles we ordered from you earlier. My colleague Brice, who is managing this project is =opied on this email and will work with you on this order. I am not sure if=12"x12" configuration would work or if we need a differe=t size, Brice could you please advice on that part? 3 EFTA_R1_01190560 EFTA02309083 Thank you very much!
