I would ask Lynn, she probably put them away I guess..

They look like they are made of rubber and were in their original packaging made of clear plastic...the bands count how many steps you take in a day...did you see them? They are no longer on the DR table and Jeffrey wants to send one to somebody...just thought I would check to see if you might know anything?... Thanks, 1 EFTA_R1_01263704 EFTA02331067 |
