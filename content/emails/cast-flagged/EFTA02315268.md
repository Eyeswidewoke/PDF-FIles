| **Subject** | Re: RE: Fwd: It makes no sense at all! I=don't appreciate him saying clearly my focus is no longer on his needs or r=quirements. So unfair. Just because I don't want to play the role of wife a=ymore and be at his side 24/7. I'm not sure how, or if,' should respond.&nb=p; I'm always making sure everything is set for him. He traveled y=sterday and I basically coordinated everyone, told them what they needed to=do to prepare, what they needed to send with him, etc..from Bahrain! And, t=e part about last week being "the toughest" of the year. For last weekend, I=asked him if he needed me..he said no. So I went to New Hampshire for the r=ce. I even said I'm happy to stay if he needed anything. And on Tuesday, I d=dn't bring it up or ask to go on Tuesday..he did and insisted on it! I was t=e one being hesitant to leave. But I'm sure it will do no good reminding hi= of these things. So frustrating. On Sep 28, 2012, at 1=:37 PM, Kathryn Kucka > wrote: It doesn =99t really make much sense.
