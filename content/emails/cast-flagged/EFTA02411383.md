**[WORD]:** unsustainable. Drastic measures are necessary to check the rapid growth of current and future liabilities of governments and reduce their adverse consequences for long-term growth and monetary stability." Countries that decide to embark on deficit reduction may face another problem. According to Andrew Smithers of Smithers & Co, a consultancy, a debt-cutting policy will make it harder for the government to bail out the private sector in times of need, as well as reducing companies' cashflow by imposing higher taxes. An even bigger problem may be the unfunded liabilities that government face fr

My apologies, there was no Global P last week. Below, please find an interesting read on debt which was in a special section of the 
Economist. Also attached is an editorial from Mohamed EI-Erian that might be of interest. Regards, Andy 
Repent at leisure 
Borrowing has been the answer to all economic troubles in the past 25 years. Now debt itself has 
become the problem, says Philip Coggan 
km 24th 2010 
MAN is born free but is everywhere in debt. In the rich world, getting hold of your first credit card is a rite of 
passage far more important for your daily life than casting your first vote. Buying your first home normally 
requires taking on a debt several times the size of your annual income. And even if you shun the temptation of 
borrowing to indulge yourself, you are still saddled with your portion of the national debt. 
Throughout the 1980s and 1990s a rise in debt levels accompanied what economists called the "great 
moderation", when growth was steady and unemployment and inflation remained low. No longer did Western 
banks have to raise rates to halt consumer booms. By the early 2000s a vast international scheme of vendor 
financing had been created. China and the oil exporters amassed current-account surpluses and then lent the 
money back to the developed world so it could keep buying their goods. 
Those who cautioned against rising debt levels were dismissed as doom-mongers; after all, asset prices were 
rising even faster, so balance-sheets looked healthy. And with the economy buoyant, debtors could afford to meet 
their interest payments without defaulting. In short, it paid to borrow and it paid to lend. 
Like alcohol, a debt boom tends to induce euphoria. Traders and investors saw the asset-price rises it brought 
with it as proof of their brilliance; central banks and governments thought that rising markets and higher tax 
revenues attested to the soundness of their policies.

The answer to all problems seemed to be more debt. Depressed? Use your credit card for a shopping spree 
"because you're worth it". Want to get rich quick? Work for a private-equity or hedge-fund firm, using borrowed 
money to enhance returns. Looking for faster growth for your company? Borrow money and make an acquisition. 
And if the economy is in recession, let the government go into deficit to bolster spending. When the European 
Union countries met in May to deal with the Greek crisis, they proposed a €750 billion ($900 billion) rescue 
programme largely consisting of even more borrowed money. 
Debt increased at every level, from consumers to companies to banks to whole countries. The effect varied from 
country to country, but a survey by the McKinsey Global Institute found that average total debt (private and 
public sector combined) in ten mature economies rose from 200% of GDP in 1995 to 300% in 2008 (see chart 1 
for a breakdown by country). There were even more startling rises in Iceland and Ireland, where debt-to-GDP 
ratios reached 1,200% and 700% respectively. The burdens proved too much for those two countries, plunging 
them into financial crisis. Such turmoil is a sign that debt is not the instant solution it was made out to be. The 
market cheer that greeted the EU package for Greece lasted just one day before the doubts resurfaced. 
From early 2007 onwards there were signs that economies were reaching the limit of their ability to absorb more 
borrowing. The growth-boosting potential of debt seemed to peter out. According to Leigh Skene of Lombard 
Street Research, each additional dollar of debt was associated with less and less growth (see chart 2). 
Stopping the debt supercycle 
The big question is whether this rapid build-up of debt—a phenomenon which Martin Barnes of the Bank Credit 
Analyst, a research group, has dubbed the "debt supercycle"—has now come to an end. Debt reduction has 
become a hot political issue. Rioters on the streets of Athens have been protesting against the "junta of the 
markets" that is imposing austerity on the Greek economy, and tea-party activists in America, angry about trillion-
dollar deficits and growing government involvement in the economy, have been upsetting the calculations of both 
the Democratic and Republican party leaderships. 
To understand why debt may have become a burden rather than a boon, it is necessary to go back to first 
principles. Why do people, companies and countries borrow? One obvious answer is that it is the only way they 
can maintain their desired level of spending. Another reason is optimism; they believe the return on the borrowed 
money will be greater than the cost of servicing the debt. Crucially, creditors must believe that debtors' incomes 
will rise; otherwise how would they be able to pay the interest and repay the capital? 
But in parts of the rich world such optimism may now be misplaced. With ageing populations and shrinking 
workforces, their economies may grow more slowly than they have done in the past. They may have borrowed 
from the future, using debt to enjoy a standard of living that is unsustainable. Greece provides a stark example. 
Standard & Poor's, a rating agency, estimates that its GDP will not regain its 2008 level until 2017. 
Rising government debt is a Ponzi scheme that requires an ever-growing population to assume the

burden—unless some deus ex machina, such as a technological breakthrough, can boost growth. As Roland 
Nash, head of research at Renaissance Capital, an investment bank, puts it: "Can the West, with its regulated 
industry, uncompetitive labour and large government, afford its borrowing-funded living standards and 
increasingly expensive public sectors?" 
Sovereign default is far from inconceivable. Many people are forecasting that Greece, despite its bail-out package 
from the EU and the IMF, will be unable to repay its debts in full and on time. Faced with the choice between 
punishing their populations with austerity programmes and letting down foreign creditors, countries may find it 
easier to disappoint the foreigners. Defaults have been common in the past, as Carmen Reinhart and Ken Rogoff 
showed in their book, "This Time is Different". Adam Smith, a founding father of economics, noted in "The Wealth 
of Nations" that "when national debts have once been accumulated to a certain degree, there is scarce, I believe, 
a single instance of their having being fairly and completely paid." 
Governments now face a tricky period when they have to deal with the debt overhang, decide how quickly to cut 
their deficits (and risk undermining growth), and try to distribute the pain of doing so as equitably as possible. 
Debt is often treated as a moral issue as well as an economic one. Margaret Atwood, in her book of essays, 
"Payback: Debt and the Shadow Side of Wealth", notes that the Aramaic words for debt and sin are the same. And 
some versions of the Lord's Prayer say "Forgive us our debts" rather than "Forgive us our trespasses". 
The Live 8 campaign in 2005 tried to shame developed nations into forgiving the debts of poor countries, 
particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Economists have developed the concept of "odious debt" in which citizens 
should not be forced to repay money borrowed by tyrannical or kleptocratic rulers. Interest payments on debt are 
often regarded as an onerous burden placed on the poor; interest is seen as an unjustified reward for capital, a 
concept that goes back to Aristotle and is implicit in the Christian idea of usury. Islam forbids it altogether. The 
book of Deuteronomy suggested a debt amnesty every seven years, which survived into later Jewish custom. 
But conventional morality has not always been on the side of the borrowers. Some regard debt as the road to ruin 
and the failure to repay as a breach of trust. In the 18th and 19th century debtors in Britain were often thrown 
into jail (as in Charles Dickens's "Little Dorrit"), though Samuel Johnson spotted the flaws of the practice: "We 
have now imprisoned one generation of debtors after another, but we do not find that their numbers lessen. We 
have now learned that rashness and imprudence will not be deterred from taking credit; let us try whether fraud 
and avarice may be more easily restrained from giving it." 
Movable morals 
In the past 100 years the moral battle has moved in favour of the debtors. Bankruptcy is no longer stigmatised 
but simply regarded as bad luck. When consumers borrow beyond their means, the blame is laid on lax lending 
practices rather than irresponsible borrowing. Governments have encouraged more people to become homeowners 
and thus to take on debt. And defaulting on one's debts has become much less cumbersome; in the current 
housing slump many American homeowners have resorted to "jingle mail", dropping their keys through the 
lender's letterbox and walking away from their property. 
In business, a few failed directorships are a sign of entrepreneurship rather than incompetence. America's Chapter 
11 process allows the managers of companies to remain in place and the business to be protected from its 
creditors. The number of companies with safe AAA credit ratings has collapsed as more have acted on the theory 
that a debt-laden balance-sheet is more efficient (because interest payments are tax-deductible in most 
countries). 
The recent crisis has also diminished belief in the judgment of the financial markets. The role of banks in the 
credit crunch and the cost of the financial sector bail-out has undermined the idea that the markets assess risk 
fairly and rationally. Instead, higher borrowing costs are seen as the result of unscrupulous speculation. 
The role of sovereign credit-default swaps (CDS), a way of betting on the likelihood of a country's failure to repay 
the money it has borrowed, has proved particularly controversial. Southern European nations, which have been at
