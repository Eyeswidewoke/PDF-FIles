| **Subject** | RE: We went to Shanghai and I could not find the watches there. I will go to Shenzen in the next week or two and will them there. I wish I knew what shop you went to in the shopping center. I asked Carolyn Wu who did the advance there and she said someone from the consulate in Guandong province took you shopping so I can't find out exactly what shop you went to. There are many of these places in the shopping center so it really should not be hard at all. You might fed ex me one of the watches so I can see exactly what it is like. Don't worry about it though as the photos came out quite well. I'll keep you informed. EFTA_R1_01280335 EFTA02333655 |
