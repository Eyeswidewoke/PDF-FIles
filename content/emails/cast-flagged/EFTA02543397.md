There =re a couple of areas where further development is needed...RF commun=cation 
frequencies change when the circuits are stretched, and dead skin a=d sweat have to be dealt with during long-term use. 
These aren't insurmountable complications, though. =/u> 
Am att=ching two related papers. Both from Science today. One describes in more detail the 
"elec=ronic second skin" and the other about "epidermal electron=cs." 
The au=hors acknowledge medical applications but they seem most interested in mak=ng this 
into game controllers. :) 
Tem=orary tattoos fitted with electronics make flexible, ultrathin sensors<=u> 
By Kyle Niemeyer 
Modern=methods of measuring the body's activity, such as electroencephalograp=y (EEG), 
electrocardiography (ECG), and electromyography (EMG), use electr=cal signals to measure changes in brain, heart, and 
muscle activity, respectively. Unfortunately, they rely on bulk= and uncomfortable electrodes that are mounted using 
adhesive tape and con=uctive gel—or even needles. Because of this, these types of measur=ments are limited to 
research and hospital settings and typically used over short periods of time because the contact= can irritate skin. 
These =imitations may be at an end, however. New research published in Science describes 
technology that allows electrical measurements (an= other measurements, such as temperature and strain) using ultra-
thin poly=ers with embedded circuit elements. These devices connect to skin without =dhesives, are practically 
unnoticeable, and can even be attached via temporary tattoo. 
All of=the necessary components of the devices, including electrodes, electronic =omponents, 
sensors, radio frequency communication components, and power su=plies, are set within an extremely thin (about 30 
µm) elastic polyester sheet. The sheet has a low elast=c modulus (that is, it's flexible) and no noticeable mass (about 
0.09 =), so you have a lightweight, stretchable membrane. 
Circui= elements (such as transistors, diodes, resistors) and sensors are constru=ted with typical 
materials like silicon and gallium arsenide, but are link=d using nanoribbon and micro/nanomembrane elements to allow 
extremely small but flexible designs.

The au=hors refer to their approach as an "epidermal electronic system"=(EES), which is 
basically a fancy way of saying that the device matches th= physical properties of the skin (such as stiffness), and its 
thickness matches that of skin features (wrinkles, creases, etc.).=ln fact, it adheres to skin only using van der Waals 
forces—the fo=ces of attraction between atoms and molecules—so no adhesive mater=al is required. Between the 
flexibility and the lack of adhesive, you wouldn't really notice one of these attached= 
One of=the coolest aspects of this technology is the application method: temporar= (transfer) 
tattoo. Yes, the ones you used as a kid, where you hold the tr=nsfer sheet with the design onto your skin then dampen it 
to dissolve the sheet. Here, they used water-soluble p=lyvinyl alcohol (PVA) sheets in the same manner. 
For a =ower supply, initial designs used silicon photovoltaic cells to generate e=ectricity, but 
these are limited to microwatts due to the small area. Rese=rchers also explored wireless inductive power, where an 
external transmission coil matches the resonance frequency=of a small inductive coil in the device (it's the same sort of 
tech th=t's used in wireless device chargers). This opens up the door for appl=cations that need more power than solar 
can provide, or for devices that work in low-light conditions (under cloth=ng, for example). The authors also suggest 
future electrical storage using=capacitors or batteries. 
As dem=nstrations, the authors used their devices to measure heartbeats on the ch=st (ECG), 
muscle contractions in the leg (EMG), and alpha waves through th= forehead (EEG). The results were all high quality, 
comparing well against traditional electrode/conductive gel =easurements in the same locations. In addition, the devices 
continuously c=ptured data for six hours, and the devices could be worn for a full 24 hou=s without any degradation or 
skin irritation. 
One in=eresting demonstration that also suggests future applications was the meas=ring of 
throat muscle activity during speech. Different words showed disti=ctive signals, and a computer analysis enabled the 
authors to recognize the vocabulary being used.<=p> 
The to=m even hooked one of these sensors up to a simple computer game (Sokoban) an= used 
throat activity as the controller. Identifying each word took about three seconds using a MATLAB program, but=it had a 
higher than 90 percent accuracy. While the potential videogame ap=lications are endless, you can also think of other 
areas, such as silent c=mmunications or better voice recognition software.
