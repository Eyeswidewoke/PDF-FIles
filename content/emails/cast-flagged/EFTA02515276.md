On 7 March 2011 you first published alle=ations under the heading "Epstein's Girl Friday 'fixer =99: dead tycoon's 
daughter Ghislaine Maxwell and the girl sh= hired for paedophile stable". 
• 
On 4 April 2014 you published basically the same allegations again under the heading 'The bombshell court=20 
document that claims Prince Andrew knew about billionaire friend's =buse of underage girls". 
More recently on 4 January 2015 you published a "world exclusive" under the heading "Th= first full account of the 
masseuse at the centre of the explosive Prince Andrew 'sex s=ave' drama... but is she telling the truth?" 
It should have been readily apparent to you from the content of your article on 4 January 2015 that 
is 
not telling the truth. 
Your stated sources for the article on 4 January 2015 are "the court documents Ms 
lodge= in Florida last week" 
and "we spoke to Ms 
twice, the l=st time just 12 months ago". The other occasion was obviously prior to 
publication on 7 March 2011. 
There is a glaring inconsistency, which you have ignored, between the versions of events you put forward in your article 
dated 7 March 2011 and what you now say is "the most complete story yet". 
The central allegation made by=20 
in your article published on 7 March 2011 is that she was recruited 
by our client who the same day, took her to Mr Epstein =99s mansion, where she met and then had sex with Mr Epstein 
whilst our client was present. Our client emphatically denies that this ever happened. 
We wrote to you following publication of these allegations in 2011 and 2014 and you stood by them.<=p> 
It now emerges that this is not=20 
not our client who is alleged to have led 
claims to have had sex with Mr Epstein.<=p> 
case at all. Rather, that it was somebody e=se, who is unnamed, and 
to Mr Epstein's bedroom and who was then present whilst Ms M' 
This is an entirely different=20 version of events. It cannot, or should not, have escaped your notice=20 that the story 
you published this Sunday was so materially different from the allegations previously published that both versions of 
events cannot be reconciled. As both versions are=20 based on interviews with Ms M, 
she has clearly lied. You 
should=20 have reported this prominently, and drawn the conclusion that her testimony is unreliable. 
Further, you should have conducted a professional investigation, in which you would have spoken to, amongst others, 
her family and you would then have learnt that her father states that Ms 
told him she met the Queen when she 
came to London. You could have checked that with Buckingham Palace and would have found it to be untrue. This 
shows Ms=20 
makes up stories. 
Further, you ought to have established that 
was employed in a burger bar which is wholly inconsistent 
with her sex slave account. We understand that Ms=20 
left America shortly after her then employer reported 
that she had stolen money. 
We have previously drawn to you= attention that Brad Edwards the lawyer fiiing these claims was the p=rtner of Scott 
Rothstein who was sentence to 50 years in prison for in par= selling fake epstein sex settlement cases. in part for forging 
a ju=ges signature,

EFTA_R1_01649569 
EFTA02515277

As you know, Brad Edwards, 
current counsel was Rothsteins partner. 
Despite the fact that Rothstein=20 was convicted of serious criminal offences of fraud relating to his conduct in 
generating false claims, that is a matter that you have ignored within your reporting. Any balanced journalism would 
have looked at the circumstances of the origin of the claim, have investigated its voracity and then taken a view as to 
whether or not it was accurate before reporting it. 
Your reporting has failed to address the material inaccuracies in 
account and =ou have used Ms 
MI 
obviously false allegations to denigrate our=20 client, who as Robert Maxwell's daughter YOU VIEWED AS an 
easy target. 
Ms 
claims are =antasy fuelled including the suggestion that she had sex with a famous prime minister. You 
have not challenged her to name this person as you shou=d have done, as this is yet another fantasy. 
It should be apparent to you that Scott Rothstein'S FIRM ORIGINALLY GOT get together=20 to make FALSE AND 
DEFAMATORY false claims. Had these been properly investigated you would have reported them as such, if you 
reported them at all. 
FURTHER AS YOU ARE FULLY AWARE =ON OF HER CLAIMS HAVE BEEN TAKEN UNDER OATH AND THEREFORE NOT 
TESTED TO AN= STANDARD OF PROBITY 
The above calls for an apology ..ro our client, RETRACTIONS IN PRINT and a detailed explanation. 
Yours faithfully
