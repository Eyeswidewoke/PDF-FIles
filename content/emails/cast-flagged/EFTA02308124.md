I'm just approximating the time..but=it might be faster..or longer? we will see after first apt. su= said that you want to change the crown molding in one apt... and i sugges=ed to change the base-board too, eventually in all apts. if you =and all the floors then would be much nicer with new base-boards... i told=sue that maybe michael can do that.. instead of getting an contractor. mic=ael is good in that, he might need only to rent from home depot a machin= for cutting corners.. so sue said wednesday they will sand the floors so maybe thursday we =an start painting ( prime, and then two coats of paint on everything) &=bsp; &nbs=; ion > From: > Subject: > Date: Mon, 21 May 2012 21:14:=7 +0200 > To: ionnicola@hotmail.com > HI lon,= > I know you saw the apts we wish to paint today.
