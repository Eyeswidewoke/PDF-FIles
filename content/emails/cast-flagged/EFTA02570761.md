Island Global Yachting (IGY), one of the world's premier owners, developers and managers of luxury marinas and 
yachting lifestyle destinations, announced that it has closed on its acquisition of Sun Resorts International (SRI) and its 
subsidiary Sun Resorts Management (SRM). SRI and SRM own and manage many of the top marinas in North America. 
"We are pleased to bring the marinas of Sun Resorts International into the global collection of IGY," said Andrew L. 
Farkas, CEO of Island Global Yachting. "The strategic positioning of these properties in the Caribbean definitely 
complements our existing assets and affords us even greater opportunities to serve our yachting clientele. With this 
addition, boaters can travel throughout the region from St. Lucia, through the Dutch Antilles, into the British Virgin 
Islands, and on to St. Thomas and always have the premier experience of an IGY marina." 
IGY developments are not only enhancing and revitalizing their local areas, but the network of properties is setting new 
standards for service and quality at marinas across the globe. IGY's signature marina, Yacht Haven Grande, has just 
opened in St. Thomas, USVI and can accommodate yachts ranging in size from 60 to 500 feet. Its facilities are considered 
by the industry to be the most technologically advanced and are complemented by its upland development of world-
class shopping, restaurants, entertainment and recreational amenities, as well as residential units. Since its opening, the 
marina has attracted some of the world's most spectacular private yachts. 
Charles Garner, president of IGY, said, "Bringing the Sun Resorts'=20 team and its portfolio of properties into the IGY 
family not only gives us the leading position throughout the Caribbean, but also adds dynamic leadership across the 
company. With now over 5,000 slips, existing or in development, and another 36,000 being planned, we are one of the 
largest managers and developers of berths in the world." 
Through its acquisition of SRM, IGY has now assumed management of an additional 11 marinas — seven in Texas and 
four in the Caribbean. The=20 Caribbean facilities are: American Yacht Harbor, St. Thomas, USVI; Simpson Bay Yacht 
Club, St. Maarten, NA; Virgin Gorda Yacht Harbor, Virgin Gorda, BVI; and Village Cay Marina, Tortola, BVI. As a part of 
the transaction, IGY acquired American Yacht Harbor in St. Thomas outright and all of SRI's interest in the three other 
Caribbean=20 facilities. The Sun Resorts acquisition adds 442 more berths to IGY's =20 Caribbean offerings alone.
