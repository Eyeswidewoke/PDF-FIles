> In the summer of 2009, in a talk at the Bristol (UK) Festival of Ideas, Fre=man Dyson articulated a vision for the future. 
He referenced "The Age Of Wo=der", by Richard Holmes, in which the first Romantic Age described by Holme= was 
centered on chemistry and poetry, while Dyson pointed out that this ne= age is dominated by computational biology. Its 
leaders, he noted, include "=iology wizards" Kary Mullis, Craig Venter, medical engineer Dean Kamen; and="computer 
wizards" Larry Page and Sergey Brin, and Charles Simonyi. He poin=ed out that the nexus for this intellectual activity —
the Lunar So=iety for the 21st century — is centered around the activities of ED=E. 
> Dyson continued to articulate his vision for a new age of biology in a rel=ted review inNew York Review of Books in 
which he wrote: "...a new generati=n of artists, writing genomes as fluently as Blake and Byron wrote verses, m=ght 
create an abundance of new flowers and fruit and trees and birds to enr=ch the ecology of our planet. Most of these 
artists would be amateurs, but trey would be in close touch with science, like the poets of the earlier Age o= Wonder. 
The new Age of Wonder might bring together wealthy entrepreneurs l=ke Venter and Kamen ... and a worldwide 
community of gardeners and farmers a=d breeders, working together to make the planet beautiful as well as fertil=, 
hospitable to hummingbirds as well as to humans."

> Scientists' greatest pleasure comes from theories that derive the solution=to some deep puzzle from a small set of 
simple principles in a surprising w=y. These explanations are called "beautiful" or "elegant". Historical examp=es are 
Kepler's explanation of complex planetary motions as simple ellipses= Bohr's explanation of the periodic table of the 
elements in terms of electron shells, and Watson and Crick's double helix. Einstein famously said that=he did not need 
experimental confirmation of his general theory of relativi=y because it "was so beautiful it had to be true." 
The EDGE Question 2012 
• 
WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE DEEP, ELEGANT, OR BEAUTIFUL EXPLANATION? 
> Since this question is about explanation, answers may embrace scientific t=inking in the broadest sense: as the most 
reliable way of gaining knowledge=about anything, including other fields of inquiry such as philosophy, mathe=atics, 
economics, history, political theory, literary theory, or the human s=irit. The only requirement is that some simple and 
non-obvious idea explain=some diverse and complicated set of phenomena.

> Of course, your own explanations are deep, elegant, and beautiful. But giv= it a rest for this exercise and please avoid 
citing your own theory, idea,=explanation. Also, think of examples that are not completely obvious—=e don't want a 
hundred people nominating natural selection, or relativity, o= Turing machines. 
> Say something new, true, and interesting based on your own experience, in 1=000 words or less. 
> Go deeper than the news. Tell us something we don't know. This is not a pu=ely scientific question: this is question 
about our culture and ourselves. T=e ideas we present on EDGE can offer a new set of metaphors to describe our=elves, 
our minds, the way we think, the world, and all of the things we kno= in it. 
> As usual, no politics ("Democrat" "Republican") or politicians ("Obama" "R=mney" "Clinton" "Gingrich", etc.). No 
editorials, Op-eds, opinion pieces, f=ippancy. No ad hominem comments. No self-promotion: no referencing your boo=s, 
papers, courses. No "selling from the stage", pushing your well-known ag=nda. No footnotes, credits, or hyperlinks in the 
text: stay on the page. No=anecdotes about spouses, significant others, kids, family pets. Write a sta=d-alone piece: 
don't respond to the pieces of other contributors already po=ted. 
> This is the annual opportunity for the EDGE community to give something ba=k, to provide an important public service, 
to make a statement by presentin= uncompromisingly sophisticated science-minded thinking to a wide global au=ience. 
Be imaginative, exciting, compelling, inspiring. Tell a great story.=Make an argument that makes a difference. Amaze and 
delight. Surprise us!
