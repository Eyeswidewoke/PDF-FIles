His thought is to get rid of the sea of remotes in each one and streamline playing content from their computers. Apple TV has a "conference room" mode that presents clear airplay instructions when you power it on, so it should be rather elegant. These won't have his iTunes ID saved on them, so they won't be able to purchase movies on his account. Thank you, On May 10, 2017, at 9:20 AM, wrote: Morning!
