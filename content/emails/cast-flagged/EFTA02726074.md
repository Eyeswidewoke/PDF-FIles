- Payment of My Debttand of Taxes and Expenses 
My Trustee shall pay from the principal of the Trust Estate (a) my debts, funeral and 
burial expenses and the administration expenses of my probate estate which are not paid by the 
Personal Representative of my probate estate, and (b) the federal and state estate, inheritance, 
succession, generation skipping and similar taxes imposed by reason of my death which are the 
obligations of my Trustee (including any of such taxes which the Personal Representative of my 
probate estate directs my Trustee to pay by written direction delivered to my Trustee). For 
purposes of this Section 2.1, the principal of the Trust Estate shall not include (a) any assets 
which are not included in my Gross Estate or (b) any assets which are not subject to, or available 
to creditors for the payment of, my debts, my funeral and burial expenses or the administration 
expenses of my probate estate.

in cash or in kind in the discretion of the Personal Representative of my probate estate) provided 
in my Will, my Trustee shall pay such unpaid bequests from the principal of the Trust Estate. If
