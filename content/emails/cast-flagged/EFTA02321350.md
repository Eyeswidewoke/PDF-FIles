If wheels up is at 8, I wonder what time we should leave the house. Jojo suggested 7am or 7.15am. And I am not sure how long in advance he should collect Jen. Maybe half an hour, I am worried she wont be ready. Lynn has checked the boxes and we have the following: 2 Boxes from Jado 1 box of socks 1 box Sonicare Toothbrush 1 box from Soda Stream Electric Fan 1 Box from middle atlantic products Blue Ray Disc Player Bose speakers/Docking station There was also a box that came from Facconable with 2 pairs of corduroys. We are going to put them in the closet here. <mailto On Sat, Feb 12, 2011 at 5:02 PM, » wrote: «mailto OK thanks.

I heard him telling Gulsum that we were coming back to NY in the evening but dont want to rely on it. I will try check with him soon. We have the robes. Lynn has showed me all the boxes in the oval office, she thinks they all need to go except for the ones that have signs on to be returned. We can go through it together when we know the plans. I will go out this afternoon to get food for the plane tomorrow and we will probably pick up things for tea and lunch in Boston as we did last time.
