The only thing I think that needs to be done is the dark recessed wall in the living room I think should have burnished wax. Also, if it's possible to move the large mirror in the bedroom more to the left so it's centered above the dresser. You are welcome to let yourself into my apt tomorrow..I need to leave by 9am. Thanks again!
