| **Subject** | Re: Jeffrey Epstein Dear It's me again : . I have contacted Jeffrey regarding a hair appointment that I wanted to schedule next week and he gave his permission and told me to contact you to organize it. Would you please be so kind to see if there are spots to see Patrick at Fekkai anytime soon (preferably in the evening)? I would like to have a cut and color correction (I'm hoping that the stylist will determine what exactly will be done when I get there, if anything at all). Thank you so much! in, 25 aar. 2017 T.
