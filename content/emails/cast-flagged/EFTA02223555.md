| **Subject** | Interview with Jeffrey Epstein • Hi Jeffrey agreed to take in person interview in New York with Dylan who's writing for TNW and Business Insider. Could you please coordinate the time directly with Dylan, keeping me in cc? They'd need 1 h but I'd reserve 1.5 h, based on my previous experience they can run out of time. DylanMpis Jeffrey's assistant. She'd help to find some time to meet Jeffrey. I guess Sept 24; 26-27 would be the best days for Dylan.
