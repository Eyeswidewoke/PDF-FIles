## Match Contexts

### Match 1
> ld it be possible to include a sentence on pointing to Judge Nathan to whatever the article(s) in which she has made comments about Epstein that are far more limited than what she will say in court? 2. On the sealing letter — I think we should add a sentence explaining why we think the claim of Maxwell abuse will cause prejudicial publicity. Namely, to air that issue in a public filing when there may well be no good faith basis for it would potentially taint the jury pool.
