Dear Eva, 
I heard from Steve that we are moving forward regarding DigniCap at Dubin Breast Center, great. 
Included is a presentation regarding the Dignitana AB rights issue. We will be asking for 50-60 MSEK (USD 6-7 
million). Approximately 40 MSEK will be a private placement and the rest a rights issue to current shareholders. 
If you would be interested or know someone that would be interested to invest in a small but quite interesting 
Swedish medtech company, please let me know. 
I will be in New York April 20-21 to meet with potential investors. 
Kind regards,
