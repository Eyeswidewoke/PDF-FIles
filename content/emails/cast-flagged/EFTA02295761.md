It was purchased from ABC home and was displayed as a wall=mirror there. But I guess you can use it in 
a different way if it works.

Was this really supposed to b= a mirror? It is very, very thick and almost a=foot wide. To me it seems 
like it could be a table top because there were lots of other tables with that material. It doesn't seem to be something 
that would hang on a wall. 
Best,
