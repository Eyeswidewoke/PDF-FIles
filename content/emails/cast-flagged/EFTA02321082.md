| **Subject** | photo on vinyl Hi Steve, Sorry this took so long, but the last panoramic photo of the ocean I =ent to you was approved for printing! The only thing is, the large size =lice of the photo you had printed, the photo was only 54" tall in the =ample, when the actual photo needs to be printed 57" x 530" and there =eeds to be about a 4" border of blank canvas around the photo to help =ith the mounting process. So overall the complete piece of material =ould be 65" x 538". Thank you! <?xml version=.0" encoding=TF-8"?> <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"> <plist version=.0"> <clict> <key>date-sent</key> <real>1308006036</real> <key>flags</key> <integer>196609</integer> <key>remote-id</key> <string>3864</string> <key>subject</key> <string>photo on vinyl</string> </dict> </plist> 1 EFTA_R1_01230879 EFTA02321082 |
