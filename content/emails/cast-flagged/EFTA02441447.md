**[WORD]:** progress. I hope that's ok w/ you, but people are often touchy about such things. Much more so than are you or I. As for the amounts every 10% of seedco is $1.5mm and every 10% of holdco (the actual acquisition entity) will approximate $11.5mm. Is this helpful?

Oh. Truth is I don't usually share that because historically people have asked me to maintain their privacy. For 
example, I would not tell people that you were an investor nor how much you owned unless you specifically 
permitted me to do so. It's a practice I've had for almost 20 years. I do, however, know that milstein does not 
care about such things and their bank (ny private bank and trust) has asked for 20%. Scoggin capital has asked 
for 10% and the ruben family has asked for 10%. The others are more particular about being identified. 
Blackstone, for example, actually makes us sign confis specifically precluding us from even indicating whether or 
not discussions are in progress. I hope that's ok w/ you, but people are often touchy about such things. Much 
more so than are you or I. As for the amounts every 10% of seedco is $1.5mm and every 10% of holdco (the 
actual acquisition entity) will approximate $11.5mm. Is this helpful?

2) CHI project now 75% subscribed, but I am far from finished talking to all traditional members 
of the island investor group. I got strep (believe it or not) and have been down for the count 
for the last 4 days. 
3) Met with citigroup thurs/fri (despite strep) and we are very much on target with them 
regarding restructuring of senior secured. That is a fulcrum security. Assuming we get them, 
b of a, netixis and merrill we will be good to go. 
4) Have now confirmed 9/6 move-in date for new house. Excited about that.
