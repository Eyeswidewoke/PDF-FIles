HBO now has a thing called HBO Go, where you can sign up for it and watch all the HBO shows online on your computer. there are a few shows JE wants to watch, and I'm trying to sign up for this, but first, I need to sign on to Direct N to manage the account online. Do we already have an online account for Direct N? If not, it's asking for the last name, phone number at the installation address and the zip code for the account in order to sign up for an online account. Can anyone help me with this? thanks.
