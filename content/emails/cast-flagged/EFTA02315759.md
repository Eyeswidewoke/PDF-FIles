| **CC** | Hey miss bella.. Would you be able to set up an appointment with Time Warner for them to =ome sort out the cable and internet in apt 8A? When they did the floors =nd painting in there, it messed everything up. There is currently a =uge pile of cable wire all wrapped up sitting in the hallway which =eeds to be brought around to the living room and hooked up to the TV. =his will require them to have to attach the wire up and over the closet =nd a few doorways, around to the living room to reach the TV.. Also, do you remember the outcome with 11P internet? I know they had to =eturn to fix it before.. do we need Scott to go in to set up the =ireless? I don't remember what happened in the end <?xml version=.0" encoding=TF-8"?> <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"> <plist version=.0"> <clict> <key>date-sent</key> <real>1346860615</real> <key>flags</key> <integer>8623750145</integer> <key>original-mailbox</key> <string>imap. <key>remote-id</key> <string>13211</string> <key>subject</key> <string></string> </diet> </plist> /Sent%20Messages</string> 1 EFTA_R1_01212264 EFTA02315759 |
