| **Subject** | 23 and Me Kits/Jeffrey Epstein Hello Sultan...I regret to tell you the 23 and Mc kits we worked so hard to receive and then ship out to you have been rendered invalid...plcase see below email from Taylor in the Customer Care department at 23 and Me. I'm so very sorry. If you sent Jeffrey the wire for the kits we will be sure to wire back to you: Hello The 23andMe Personal Genome Service that may be purchased through our US online store is only available for purchase in the United States and must be used in, and returned for analysis from within, the United States in order for us to comply with applicable laws. I apologize if this was unclear to you at the time of your purchase. This is specifically addressed in the 23andMe Terms of Service, which customers must agree to in placing an order. Section 10 states: "You may not use the Services outside of the country to which your sample collection kit was shipped from 23andMe." You can find the full text of our Terms of Service here: https:j/www.23andme.comjubout ftos! At this time, I am required to invalidate all sample kits in your recent order as we cannot provide the US version of the Personal Genome Service outside of the United States. I have processed a full refund for your kits to the purchasing payment method. You should see this refund reflected on your statement within 7-10 business days. We do not currently offer our services in the United Arab Emirates, and cannot support the use of our service in your region at this time. I apologize for any inconvenience and appreciate your understanding that these policies are in place to ensure we are complying with applicable laws. Regards, Taylor The 23andMe Team EFTA_R1_00947882 EFTA02217620 |
