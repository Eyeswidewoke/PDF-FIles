Good to hear that no one was hurt but sad to hear of the destruction. I saw photos of St Thomas and I immediately thought of Jeffrey's island. I will be on the lookout for his call tomorrow.... Thank you!! Xo On Tue, Sep 12, 2017 at 4:40 PM, Lesley Groff ote: Hi Hope you are well! Sorry I missed your call today but it was received! I let Jeffrey know you were checking in and he says he will call you Friday! All of Jeffrey's people on his island and PB are ok, which is most important...homes will definitely need some work! roads...trees...infrastructure, etc...will need to be rebuilt and planted... Take care, Lesley Assistant to Jeffrey Epstein EFTA_R1_00980000 EFTA02222377 |
