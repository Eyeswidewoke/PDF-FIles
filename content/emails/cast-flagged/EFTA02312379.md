He said PR because if you are leaving at night that is the only option.. there won't be any nonstop at night most likely, but will check for sure On Jul 18, 2012, at 7:03 PM, francis derby wrote: Sarah, JE would like me to fly out tmrw night through puerto rico.. not sure what that means, but either way i will need a new flight booked and a car to pick me up. i am in the garden with Josephine till 1 tmrw so a flight in the evening would be best thank you. I wil be in to check in on Friday to check in with Lyn about Sundays breakfast. Also i will get some shopping done friday so I'm not scrabbling for food on Sunday. Francis Francis J.
