Below is a brief synopsis of each of the 3 properties you saw. Bin Ennakhil - the ask=ng price remains at 55m euros but as discussed this price is negotiable and=we had it under contact last year but due to health reasons the purchaser h=d to pull out. I now believe an offer circa 35m euros would be acceptable. This property is unique and will never be able to be recreated, it is a work o= art or a monument as much as fabulous property. Dar Olfa - like Bin Ennakhil the asking pric= remains at 65m euros and was also under contact last year but due tax reas=ns the deal did not go ahead - it is likely a figure around 40 - 45m euros w=uld be acceptable. The only comparable recent sale was in this compound kno=n as Bab Atlas and was the sale of the largest property there for a reputed=100m euros to The Emir of Qatar. =div class="">Ksar Swari - also located in Bab Atlas with an asking price o= 30m euros is less negotiable. This property is owned by the developer of t=e whole project and as you saw has some wonderful workmanship with hand car=ed cedar ceilings and beautiful gardens. As it is lived in most of the year=it has a much warmer or homely feeling to the all the others you saw. =div class=""> The very high end prope=ty market in Marrakech is as expected a tiny part of the market and there a=e no comparable sales since the purchase by the Emir however right now Ali B=ngo from Gabon and Al Nahyan family of Abu Dhabi are both building palaces w=ich will cost over 40m euros each. Normally when purchasing a property in Morocco one should a=d approximately 10% to the purchase price spilt 6% in government taxes, 1% N=taire fees and 3% real estate agency fees however in the case of Bin Ennakh=l for example as the property is owned by a company in Lichtenstein there a=e no government taxes to be paid in Morocco. I am sending via wetransfer more=pictures of Bin Ennakhil, Ksar Swari and Dar Olfa and you have the PDF broc=ures for each property. I look forward to hearing from you and of course I remain at yo=r disposal should you have any more questions.
