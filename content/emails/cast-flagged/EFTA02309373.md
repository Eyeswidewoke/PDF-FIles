I've =otten 2 other quotes from contractors that each came back with $22,000..'m hoping if Penn's is less than this, JE will be OK with us going with =im. I think it's alot easier for all involved to use Penn, and we just =ave to convince JE that as long as we have all materials, etc, he can =inish in 2 weeks. (that's the time frame Penn gave me). Also the tiles ='m ordering for 8H are quite large, 12"x35" so he said that will be =lot faster to install. >» I'm having all the materials delivered on Tuesday to the building, =hey said curbside delivery. It will be the wall and floor tiles, grout, =oilet, vanity, sink fixture and shower fixtures. (still looking for =ctual sink top, med cabinet and towel bar). How should they proceed =ith delivering the items if they only deliver curbside? Is there =omeone who can help bring all the items up to the apt? We will have our =ainter in the building as well who can help. >» >» On Jun 1, 2012, at 11:51 AM, Anthony Barrett wrote: >» »» Did you meet? >>» >>» »» On Jun 1, 2012, at 9:24 AM,nrote: >>» >»» He just responded.
