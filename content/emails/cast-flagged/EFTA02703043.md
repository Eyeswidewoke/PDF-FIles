Robert Reich: America is headed full speed back to the 19th century 
=p class="MsoNormal" align="center">

I recently ran across an artic=e in Salon Magazine by Former labor secretary Robert Reich =E244, America is headed 
full speed back to the 19th century — on the dangers of on-demand jobs and our growing intolerance for labor unions. 
The growth of on-demand jobs like Uber is making life less predictable and secu=e for workers. The problem is that 
these new jobs are low-paying with much less security. On the other side, a Forbes Magazine contributor, for example, 
writes that jobs ex=st only "when both employer and employee are happy with the deal being made." So if the new jobs 
are minimum wage and irregular, too bad. 
As Robert Reich points out =hat much the same argument was voiced in the late nineteenth century over alleged 
"freedom of c=ntract." Any deal between employers and workers was assumed to be fine if both sides voluntarily 
agreed to it. It was an era when many workers were "happy" to toil twelve-hour days in =weat shops for lack of any 
better alternative. It was also a time of great wealth for a few and squalor for many. And of corruption, as =he lackeys 
of robber barons deposited sacks of cash on the desks of pliant legislators. Finally, after decades of labor strife and 
political tumult, the twentieth century brought an understanding that capitalism requires minimum standards of 
decency and fairness — workplace safety, a minimum wage, maximum hours (and tim=-and-a-half for overtime), and a 
ban on child labor. 
We also learned that capita=ism needs a fair balance of power between big corporations and workers. We achieved 
that through antitrust laws that reduced the capacity of giant corporations to impose their will, and labor laws that 
allowed workers to organize and bargain collectively. By the 1950s, when 35 percent of private-sector workers belonged 
to a labor un=on, they were able to negotiate higher wages and better working conditions than employers would 
otherwise have been "happy" to provide..=A0 And as Robert Reich points out again.... now we seem to be heading 
back to nineteenth century.

Corporations are shifting f=ll-time work onto temps, free-lancers, and contract workers who fall outside the labor 
protections established decades ago. The nation's biggest corporations and Wall Street banks are larger and more 
potent than ever. And labor union membership has shrunk to less than 6 percent of the private-sector workforce. So 
it*=99s not surprising we're once again hearing that workers are worth no more =han what they can get in the market. 
But as we should have learn=d a century ago, markets don't exist in nature. They're created by human beings. The real 
question=is how they're organized and for whose benefit. In the late nineteenth century they were organized for the 
benefit of a few at the top. But by the middle of the twentieth century they were organized for the vast majority. 
During t=e thirty years after the end of World War II, as the economy doubled in size, so did the wages of most 
Amer=cans — along with improved hours and working conditions. 
Yet since around 1980, even=though the economy has doubled once again (the Great Recession notwithstanding), the 
wages most Americans =ave stagnated. And their benefits and working conditions have deteriorated.Q=A0 This isn't 
because most Americans are worth less. In fact, worker productivity is higher than ever. It's because big corporations, 
Wall Street, and some enormously rich individuals have gained political power to organize the market in ways that have 
enhanced their wea=th while leaving most Americans behind. 
That includes trade agreeme=ts protecting the intellectual property of large corporations and Wall Street's financial 
assets, =ut not American jobs and wages. Bailouts of big Wall Street banks and their executives and shareholders when 
they can4,=99t pay what they owe, but not of homeowners who can't meet their mortgage =ayments. Bankruptcy 
protection for big corporations, allowing them to shed their debts, including labor contracts. But no =ankruptcy 
protection for college graduates over-burdened with student debts. Antitrust leniency toward a vast swathe of 
American industry — incl=ding Big Cable (Comcast, AT&T, Time-Warner), Big Tech (Amazon, Google), Big Pharma, the 
largest Wall Street banks, and giant retailers (Walmart). 
With less tolerance toward =abor unions — as workers trying to form unions are fired with impunity, and more states 
adopt so-called 40=804oright-to-work" laws that undermine unions. We seem to be heading full speed back to the late 
nineteenth century. Robert Reich, "So what will be the galvanizing force for change this time?"

Twenty-five years ago last month, the New York Times<A> ran its first profile of Barack Obama. On February 6, 1990, it 
ann=unced (in a headline that's now pretty dated), "First Black Elected to H=ad Harvard's Law Review," and explained 
that the 28-year-old's new role=was considered the "highest student position" at the school. Of course, no one was 
using the term back them, but Obama went out of his way =o make clear that his election shouldn't be interpreted as 
ushering in a post-racial era on the law review staff or in the country. '&#=9;The fact that I've been elected shows a lot 
of progress," he t=ld the Times. "It's encouraging." But, he added, "it's important that stories like mine aren't u=ed to 
say that everything is O.K. for blacks. You have to remember that for ev=ry one of me, there are hundreds or thousands 
of black students with at least equal talent who don't get a chance." 
"IT'S IMPORTANT THAT STORIES LIKE MINE AREN'T USED TO SAY THAT EVERYTHING IS =.K. FOR BLACKS." 
Barack Obama 
There's a hint in the piece that the news was=fraught with tension over whether Obama truly deserved his new role. 
The Times quo=es former law review president Peter Yu, who says Obama's election "was a choice on the merits, but 
others may read something into it." =C2*For anyone who was around in 2008, that should sound familiar. And 
although a lot has change, in many ways little has changed. In America we are yet to live in a post-racial society and 
almost every person of color will agree with me.4>=A0 Attached please find the original New York Times article if it is

In a recent article in The New Republic, Elizabeth Stoker Bruenig pointed out t=e newest lunacy of the Right After 
President Barack Obama noted du=ing the last National Prayer Bre=kfast that Christians have commi=ted acts of 
violence in the name of Christianity, there are a lot of direc=ions conservatives could have gone. The sanest direction 
would have been to accept that Christians=have done terrible things under the banner of faith — even religio=s we find 
familiar and comforting can be contorted under the right conditi=ns. This was undoubtedl= the point the president was 
attempting to make, in an effort to maintain =ome semblance of fairness as he addressed the problem of Islamic 
terrorism= 
Instead, a number of conservatives tried to defend =he Crusades 
herein lies the lunacy.... At National Review Onlin=, 
a popular conservative blogging platform, Jonah Goldberg argued that the=Crusades were essentially justified in the 
context of what he identifies a= Muslim aggression. "For starters," the Crusades—despite their terrible o=ganized 
cruelties — were a defensive war." Note t=at the plural "Crusades" transforms by th= end of the sentence into the 
singular "a ... war*=800: Goldberg was closer to the mark at the start of the senten=e than at the end, as there were 
multiple Crusades, and each of them were =istinct affairs. Some, for example, were initiated by the papacy; others w=re 
initiated by kings against the wishes of the Church, and some, like the=C24>Children's Crusade, now appear to be at 
least somewhat myt=ological. More slippery is the tantalizingly italicized word Q=800defensive," which conservatives 
also periodically ap=Iy to the Civil War with similar intentions of historical whitewashing.Q=A0 
As David Perry points out at The Guardian, a ho=t of other conservative defenses of the Crusades have accompanied 
Goldberg=E244>s: from spirited justifications to softer arguments. Louisiana Gov=rnor Bobby Jindal's claim, for 
instance, was that the Crusades hap=ened so long ago as to be irrelevant in all modern contexts, and that the =ime 
spent discussing them in Obama's speech could have been put to bet=er use combatting ISIS. 
One =ould interpret these bizarre defenses as evidence that, for a certain bran= of Christian, the fact that Christians can 
and do pervert religion in the=service of evil deeds is literally unbelievable. But this would=seem a remarkable stretch, 
given that even Judas Iscariot has a place in t=e Christian economy of salvation. In other words, Christians ca= usually 
fathom, when thinking rationally, the idea that terrible things a=e a part of our collective history. 
Perhaps conserva=ives merely found the criticisms of the Crusades cynical, given that their=historical distance makes 
any genuinely felt implication on the president=E244s behalf unlikely. In this case, the defense of the Cru=ades reads 
as a reflexive measure, meant to press Obama into more compromi=ing territory, where he might have the courage to 
remark o
