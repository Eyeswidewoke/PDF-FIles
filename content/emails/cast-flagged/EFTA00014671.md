### Match 6
> 1(photographs). Specifically, the Court directed the government "to notify the Court of its views as to Requests 9 through 11." Dkt. 252. The government's position is consistent with its general approach to evidence in this case which is to blindly accept information it considers unfavorable to Ms. Maxwell, begrudgingly EFTA00014671 The Honorable Alison J. Nathan May 12, 2021 Page 2 produce Brady material with various disclaimers such as "although the government is not obligated to do so" (Dkt. 269 pp. 8, 9), and obfuscate the importance of legitimate defense requests for discovery.

> pt a journal for a period in 1996 in which she described various events, including her interactions with Jeffrey Epstein. Seven (7) photocopied pages of this journal, two of which are the front and back covers, were selectively produced by BSF in discovery during civil litigation to counsel for Ms. Maxwell, apparently as support for her claims against Epstein. The civil litigation was stayed and ultimately dismissed prior to resolution of questions related to the failure to produce the entire journal. Accuser-2 relied on select portions of the journal in public discussions with various representat

> earlier where the government represented that Accuser-2 "stopped writing in her journal about a month after" her meeting with Epstein, Dkt. 100, p.11 n.2. Incredibly, the government has never examined or taken possession of the journal and is relying on the representations of lawyers adverse to Ms. Maxwell in multiple civil litigations, the same lawyers who have taken an active role in providing the government with selective pieces of evidence and who regularly bash Ms. Maxwell in the media, hardly a reliable source.'

### Match 10
> l, or refresh recollection, or as a past-recollection recorded, or as a prior-consistent statement, and at the same time ignore the remainder of the writing. The government should know what is in the remainder of the journal; it simply chooses selective ignorance and relies on lawyers adverse to Ms. Maxwell for cover. This type of selective disclosure of information is routinely rejected by courts, including the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. Known as the "fairness doctrine," when one party makes assertions about parts of a communication or writing the entire communication loses protected status
