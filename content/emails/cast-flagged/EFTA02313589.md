Is your vendor willing to provide a tax opinion that no tax is owed on t=ansfer or capital gains and there is no obligation or disclosure of money b=ing received outside of Morocco when the only asset is Moroccan? 3. Is your firm or Christies willing to stand behind the transaction, re tit=e, or tax guarantees, employment, agriculture or any local or state claim? =4. If not, what structure can you propose that doesn't obligate us t= accept a property and a company with unknown claims and virtually unlimite= liability? S. The property title deed you sent only shows no liablities as of 6 years a=o? 6. Where do you expect the money to be sent?and to what entity? BVI, Lichte=stein, who signs on behalf of this transaction? 7. I assume you are aware that under new intl banking regulations, the ultim=te owner, ie your vendors name will most likely be required to be disclosed=(anti money laundering, sanctions, tax disclosure ). The world financial sy=tem has changed since your vendor built this property. Look forward to your=suggestions and answers. Your fees would be paid to the company or to your f=rm directly? Thank you.
