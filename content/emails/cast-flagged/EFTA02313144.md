| **Subject** | Re: Bin Ennakhil Dear Alex, We assume we are not the first to be surprised at a Christi=s Broker suggesting payment to a trust in the BVI re shares in a Lich=enstein co with no due diligence, no guarantees, no insurance, no title, re=ating to property in Morocco and bank accounts in the United States in an a=tempt to avoid both capital gains and transfer tax. The lawyers dont know w=ere to begin as well, as the date in the contract refers to August of 2017.= So this contract was drafted years ago and it appears n= one was willing to sign, is that correct? Thank=you.

It is not a real e=tate contract, it is a purchase of an offshore entity, creating many c=mplexities for americans. 2. There was never a=y discussion about real estate fees on top of the price. We have bought man= properties, including through Christies and a commission was always paid b= seller. 3. The due diligence on a lichtenstein co.=will take months. 4. We would have to be indemnified=for all taxes due to morroccan government on transfer and unknown lia=iltiles of the co., especially as you might imagine, this purchase wo=ld be very high profile. 5. Is there a title on file= who would guarantee title transfer? If Christies is willing that mi=ht work. 6. We were hoping for a quick closing. With this struct=re it is not possible, and money would need to be withheld for years to bac= up the indemnity. It is very disappointing. We are told that liabilt=es would extend approx 7 years, so a payment of 10m day one and 2 milliion p=r year for 8 years might work. There clearly is no perfect title transfer u=der your proposed structure. Four jurisdictions, real estate and corp=rate and disclosure rules in each. Can you make a suggestion? <=iv dir="ltr"> Thank you.
