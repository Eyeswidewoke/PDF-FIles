Island Global Yachting (IGY), one of the world's premier owner=, developers and managers of luxury marinas and 
yachting lifestyle destina=ions, announced that it has closed on its acquisition of Sun Resorts Inter=ational (SRI) and its 
subsidiary Sun Resorts Management (SRM). SRI and SRM=own and manage many of the top marinas in North America. 
"We are pleased to bring the marinas of Sun Resorts Internatio=al into the global collection of IGY," said Andrew 
L. Farkas, CEO =f Island Global Yachting. "The strategic positioning of these prop=rties in the Caribbean definitely 
complements our existing assets and affo=ds us even greater opportunities to serve our yachting clientele. With thi= 
addition, boaters can travel throughout the region from St. Lucia, throug= the Dutch Antilles, into the British Virgin 
Islands, and on to St. Thomas=and always have the premier experience of an IGY marina." 
IGY developments are not only enhancing and revitalizing their local a=eas, but the network of properties is 
setting new standards for service an= quality at marinas across the globe. IGY's signature marina, Yach= Haven Grande, 
has just opened in St. Thomas, USVI and can accommodate yac=ts ranging in size from 60 to 500 feet. Its facilities are 
considered by t=e industry to be the most technologically advanced and are complemented by=its upland development 
of world-class shopping, restaurants, entertainment=and recreational amenities, as well as residential units. Since its 
openin=, the marina has attracted some of the world's most spectacular pr=vate yachts.

Charles Garner, president of IGY, said, "Bringing the Sun Reso=ts' team and its portfolio of properties into the 
IGY family not o=ly gives us the leading position throughout the Caribbean, but also adds d=namic leadership across the 
company. With now over 5,000 slips, existing o= in development, and another 36,000 being planned, we are one of the 
large=t managers and developers of berths in the world." 
Through its acquisition of SRM, IGY has now assumed management of an a=ditional 11 marinas — seven in Texas 
and four in the Caribbean. Th= Caribbean facilities are: American Yacht Harbor, St. Thomas, USVI; Simpso= Bay Yacht 
Club, St. Maarten, NA; Virgin Gorda Yacht Harbor, Virgin Gorda,=BVI; and Village Cay Marina, Tortola, BVI. As a part of 
the transaction, IGY acquired American Yacht=Harbor in St. Thomas outright and all of SRI's interest in =he three other 
Caribbean facilities. The Sun Resorts acquisition adds 442 =ore berths to IGY's Caribbean offerings alone.
