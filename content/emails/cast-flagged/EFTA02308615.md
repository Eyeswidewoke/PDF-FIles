| **CC** | I would like your approval to use Penn to do 8H bathroom. I have gotten =uotes from 3 other contractors to do the work, and they have all come =ack with a quote of $21,000-22,000 with the work taking 2-3 weeks. Penn has given me a quote of $12,500 to do the work with a 2 week =stimate. He can start the demo on Monday. All of the materials will be =elivered to the apt on Tuesday. He said as long as he has all materials =n hand, then he can be quick about doing the work. Also, since our =iles are quite large, that will save alot on time. He said the reason =en's took so long was we didn't have all the materials at once, and the =ubway tiles take much longer to install than larger tiles. All of the bathrooms he has done for us in the past has had a very good =esult, the building knows him, his workers are already here, and his =uote is almost half of other contractors. Is it OK to proceed with =sing him? <?xml version=.0" encoding=TF-8"?> <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "4/Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"> <plist version=.0"> <clict> <key>date-sent</key> <real>1338570408</real> <key>flags</key> <integer>8590195713</integer> <key>original-mailbox</key> <string>imap: ent%20Messages</string> <key>remote-i < cey> <string>11180</string> <key>subject</key> <string></string> </dict> </plist> 1 EFTA_R1_01188368 EFTA02308615 |
