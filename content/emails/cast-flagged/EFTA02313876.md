I prefer to refer to it as EIS (electrolytically isolated silver) to dissociate it from home-brewed colloidal silver of Blue Man fame thx to Oprah, Mercola, People mag, etc...misinformation at best, bordering on disinformation, as EIS actually will help reverse the argyria caused by excessive use of poorly manufactured colloidal silver. (for more on this see the att'd Colloidal Silver Facts article & website) H Here are just a few tidbits of info on Silver Shield (the totally new, patented , nano form of the old colloidal silver formulation) now known as EIS: • for credibility w your medical doctor, etc the att'd patent excerpt details 57 diseases against which Silver Shield has been proven more effective than any known antibiotic. (including MRSA, Anthrax, 17 kinds of Staph, Malaria, Bubonic, and many others) It works well w most Chemo treatments, unless they are salt-based, in which case the charge of the salt is the opposite of the silver and cancels effectiveness when taken in close sequence. (less than two hours) • Wounds heal in roughly half the time, with topical application. This includes burns. Sunburn pain goes away instantly, tho the redness does not. Excellent effects at many pain receptors. • A topical gel is available as well for skin and other conditions. A three to six minute application is sufficient to do its work, some issues take longer and you repeat in that case five times per day. EFTA_R1_01204777 EFTA02313876 Stronger is not better. A 10-15 ppm formulation works as well as or better than 30 parts per million. Can be taken as a preventive, or as pathogen (virus, bacteria, fungus) killer for cure. • A small amount in dirty water purifies it. NASA has used similar silver tech for years on the shuttle and swimming pool mfgs as a substitute for chlorine. • Other disinfectant uses like carpets, etc., Fogging a Boeing 747 for 22 minutes was successful in completely disinfecting interior without leaving toxic residue • A small amount (4 oz. bottle) in a 55 gal barrel of water has shown to keep it pure for at least four years. • Method Of Action (actually four distinct MOAs) does not produce metabolites (toxic or other), so there is much less Herxheimer effect. (die-off) • MOA is quite different from the old (single missing electron) colloidal silver. (see third attachment above for detail) • Allows dental root canal procedure to be all completed on the same day rather than over weeks or months. In use in Canada, awaiting ADA blessing in US. • Will not cause skin discoloration such as has been reported of an eccentric individual (via daily over-use of a home-brewed product ) that caused Paul Kerason's skin to turn grey. This case has been highly publicized recently, doubtless due to mass media's "both sides of an issue" policy. There have been no adverse reports from use of the EIS-formulated product. • You can pull down Silver Shield product sheets from Nature's Sunshine website by clicking on http://www.naturessunshine.com/us/products/catalog/product/default.aspx?stocknum=4074 <http://www.naturessunshine.com/us/products/catalog/product/default.aspx?stocknum=4074> or open the last attachment to this email for a .pdf version. Or you can Google US Pat 7135195, and you'll find the patent holder, Bio Tech Labs or the primary researcher at Penn State, Rustum Roy who has done a lot with it, and published articles in medical journals.
