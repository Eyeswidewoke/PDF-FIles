| **Subject** | animal update Good morning Mr. Epstein I am taking all the goats, sheep, mini horses and even pigs to their new home today(they will all be together). I will also be taking Max to his new home and Spock to someone that will sell him for us. I have a few contacts and feelers out for Diablo. I am confident I will find him a good home very soon. Have a good day Wendy 1 EFTA_R1_01233915 EFTA02322264 |
