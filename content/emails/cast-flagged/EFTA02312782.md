Below is a brief synopsis =f each of the 3 properties you saw. Bin Ennakhil = the asking price remains at 55m euros but as discussed this price is nego=iable and we had it under contact last year but due to health reasons the =urchaser had to pull out. I now believe an offer circa 35m euros would be =cceptable. This property is unique and will never be able to be recreated,=it is a work of art or a monument as much as fabulous property. =br> Dar Olfa - like Bin Ennakhil the asking price remains at 65m=euros and was also under contact last year but due tax reasons the deal di= not go ahead - it is likely a figure around 40 - 45m euros would be accep=able. The only comparable recent sale was in this compound known as Bab At=as and was the sale of the largest property there for a reputed 100m euros=to The Emir of Qatar. Ksar Swari - also located i= Bab Atlas with an asking price of 30m euros is less negotiable. This prop=rty is owned by the developer of the whole project and as you saw has some=wonderful workmanship with hand carved cedar ceilings and beautiful garden=. As it is lived in most of the year it has a much warmer or homely feelin= to the all the others you saw. The very high end=property market in Marrakech is as expected a tiny part of the market and =here are no comparable sales since the purchase by the Emir however right =ow AU Bongo from Gabon and Al Nahyan family of Abu Dhabi are both buildin= palaces which will cost over 40m euros each. Nor=ally when purchasing a property in Morocco one should add approximately 10= to the purchase price spilt 6% in government taxes, 1% Notaire fees and 3= real estate agency fees however in the case of Bin Ennakhil for example a= the property is owned by a company in Lichtenstein there are no governmen= taxes to be paid in Morocco. 2 EFTA_R1_01201690 EFTA02312783 I am sending v=a wetransfer more pictures of Bin Ennakhil, Ksar Swari and Dar Olfa and yo= have the PDF brochures for each property. = look forward to hearing from you and of course I remain at your disposal =hould you have any more questions.
