| **Subject** | Track Lighting I realized today we painted 11 P and didnt notice to replace the track lighting, now with everything new and clean in there, it looks old and grubby. I am going to look into which lighting places are standard for those sorts of things and get options tomorrow. Then Michael will just have to do a touch up. Karyna and I also want track lighting in 8H and 10F. what do you think about 10B? I will check 8A as well and see if there is currently in there, but I dont think so. I think it is always better to overlight than under. <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.O.dtd"> <pl ist version="1.0"> <dict> <key>date-sent</key> creal>1339602746</real> <key>flags</key> <integer>8590195713</integer> <key>original-mailbox</key> <string>imap: <key>remote-id</key> <string>31327</string> <key>subject</key> <string>Track Lighting</string> </dict> </plist> /INBOX</string> 1 EFTA_R1_01192432 EFTA02309620 |
