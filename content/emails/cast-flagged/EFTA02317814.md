On Nov 7, 2012, at 11:12 PM, =rancis derby <fa =rote: Hi Just wanted to touch =ase on where i am at with things this week. I have cooked for two days =or Ms Maxwell, monday and tuesday. I spent today getting things ready =o send off to LS1, Stew and steaks and some equipment. At 71st we have started going through all the old =fates and making room for the new plates in the kitchen. When can we =xpect to see the new plates? I would need your help to =igure out what stays and what goes as far as whats there and maybe find =ew homes for a few things... some sets are missing alot of peices, some =re kind of dated, and some are fine to still use. Here are a few things I found that might be good to =ave around for snacks and dinners to switch things up a bit. You have =he great eye for this stuff and know what works in the =ouse. To recap our conversation i thought it would be nice to go =owards a classic but modern kind of feel. Elleven Madison Park, Corton, =ean Goerges all do this really well. =nbsp; Bernardaud has this line i thought =ooked interesting (the fruit dish, gravy boat, Sugar bowl and =reamer) http://www.bernardaud.fr/index.php?id=us26&categor=e=us0l&decor=0479 Ice cream set =or a possible lunch buffet http://www.potterybarn.com/products/dempsey-ice-crea=-service-set/?cm_src=AutoCatRel Slate =oards (2- Small and 2-medium) for canape and snacks http://www.crat=andbarrel.com/slate-boards/f 13629 Soy =auce pot but maybe not for soy but for a broth or jus that gets poured =t the table http://korin.com/Hakuji-Round-White-Soy-Sauce-Pot?sc=29&a=p;category=2814SS large Glass bowl for =alad (buffet or family style) Or the small' ones for a small app or =muse http://korin.com/Glass-Bowl-with-Gold-Flake?sc=29&category==81458 http://korin.com/Steep-Clear-Glass-Bowl-with-Gold-Fla=e?sc=29&category=2814S8 1 EFTA_R1_01221601 EFTA02317814 Mini dessert serving glass for ice creams or =orbets, or i can see them used for butter, jam and cream cheese at =reakfast http://kor=n.com/Mini-Clear-Glass-Dessert-Serving-Dome this Christofle flatware also has =erving size spoons and forks.
