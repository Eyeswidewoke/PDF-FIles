Thank=you for the comprehensive feedback Steven. 
For me the main value is that the system=is an order of magnitude cheaper than existing 
technologies, premised on le=eraging data to help users see what daily elements are affecting their bloo= sugar, and 
predicting dangerous highs and lows before they happen so they c=n take actions beforehand. To date, their beta app 
has lowered blood sugar averages in=over 55% of users 2x better than the world's most prescribed diabetes 
drug,=Metformin. Which means that with the help of the date diabetes would need t= use less drugs. However I'd agree 
on complexity of regulations and saturation on the m=rket.

Greetings Masha, 
I apologi=e for the delay. I was at some events in in UK where I did not have

EFTA02398723

I have worked on a related portfolio c=mpany so I will have to be a bit abstract on the 
specifics of this opportun=ty. So please excuse these brief thoughts. Also, the only information=l had was what was 
provided in your mail which was limited relative to any d=tailed analysis. 
* In general the challenge with g=ucose measurement is the finger prick. Any device 
that relies on this will o=ly be marginally better than any other device, whether or not there is soft=are or a slightly more 
convenient measuring device. This is a statement abo=t the inconvenience of a prick (and long term challenges) but also 
the medi=al challenges on relying on that point in time. 
* My sense is tha= going down the path of an innovation, that still has a prick, but 
requires=a level of FDA approval is a difficult one to approach. 
* This is=a very crowded space. There are a lot of apps, a lot of measuring devices, a=lot 
of mixtures of app and measuring devices. It is very difficult to avoid=appearing as a commodity to consumers. 
" While I understand there=is potential to see innovation using novel approaches to 
analysis of data, i= is not clear to me how much better the approach can be for an individual w=th data. 
* The real opportunity I might see is around measuring g=ucose or some related 
telemetry to assist in compliance that is outside the=scope of a finger prick and measuring glucose directly. It seems like 
we sh=uld have some other data point upon which to apply machine learning.

I hope this helps...any friend of JE is a friend of mine.=/div>
