| **Subject** | Explanation of Points/Mileage Upgrade Hi Karyna...below is from Natasha when I requested she explain to =e how it all works re Amex points and Mileage upgrades. When I booked your AF flights and Jeffrey wanted me to upgrade I had to =irst create an account with AF for Jeffrey. We then had to find out if =our flight was available for upgrade since there are only a few seats =n each flight available for mileage upgrades. Once it was confirmed =here was a seat available to upgrade with mileage points, Natasha =ransferred the Amex points to the account I had set up...you want =o confirm there is an actual seat first because once the points are =onverted to mileage with the airline they are not reversible (they =an't go back to Amex points). The transfer is immediate =owever so that is good. I will say it is easier to upgrade with Amex =oints and just have Natasha do it! We always get 20% of the points =ack in a few billing cycles. We can pay for an economy or premium =conomy seat then upgrade with Amex points. Example goes like this: If =he premium economy seat is $6000 and the Biz/First class seat is =10,000, we pay in real money the $6000 then the difference in price =rom premium economy to biz/first is $4000. The $4000 is converted to =00,000 points (4000x100). Also, we would get money back to our =ccount, not points, if you don't use a ticket...so it is =ctually OK if you don't wind up taking a flight in the end! At =east we get some money back. :_ To pay with points for upgrade - you book coach ticket and pay =ifference in fare (plus possible change fee) in points. Or you pay for =usiness/first class ticket partially with points (20% back), let's say =ou pay coach value with money and the rest - difference - in points, to =void change fee. 1.00 = 100 points. Other option - to transfer American Express points to the airline and =et mileage upgrade (we can transfer points to certain airlines), 1 =oint = 1 miles. But mileage upgrade could be tricky, has to be =vailable, sometimes it is not the lowest fare to be upgradable and =ometimes you have to do it yourself (with certain airlines), but I can =ransfer points. <?xml version=.0" encoding=TF-8"?> <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.O.dtd"> <plist version=.0"> <dict> <key>conversation-idgkey> <integer>51122</integer> <key>date-last-viewed</key> <integer>0</integer> <key>date-received</key> <integer>1556634830</integer> <key>flags</key> <integer>8590195717</integer> <key>remote-id</key> <string>90933</string> </dict> </plist> EFTA_R1_01210840 EFTA02315550 |
