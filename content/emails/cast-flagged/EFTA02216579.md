I shall be available to come if needed on the 21 for few days whether it's necessary. The last pan of my schematic design is taking me longer than I thought, I `m almost done, but I'll need the week still. Best regards, Kevin. Le 29 mai 2017 A 17:17, Kevin Ouvre <a a Colt : Hi Jeffrey, Thank you for the trip It was really helpful to stay on the island once again, in order to precise more the project. Please find attached a visual of the basket on LSG. - Bismarckia nobilis (blue latan palm) will handle much more wind) you should get rid of the coconut. - New stone wall will be nicer as all surrounded walls are well shaped. having those boulders makes it too rough today. -Alamanda flower, should get ok. Just change the one that has trouble to grow. Regarding GSJ , I'm putting everything together this week (new idea, new locations, details etc... ) and I shall send you a file at the end of the week. I'll be available in three weeks to make the first road and some path. Best regards, Kevin.
