Noted James. Would my offer of a formal undertaking not to release letter to any party without prior consent not cover 
the expressed concerns?

I have included the Duchess and the Duke's office in this email. I understand you have also been in touch with Schillings 
today expressing your and Mr Epstein's concern on this issue. 
From the Duchesses perspective she is awaiting instruction from Mr Epstein - she was happy to help and has sought to 
speak supportively of him wherever she can - however with the letter she is unable to send a letter over which she then 
has no on going control. 
Would welcome some suggestions from you re this.

James, the problem is that nothing tangible has been forthcoming from your client, her solicitor or yourself. I had 
understood from Rod CM that your client was going to liase direct with my client in relation to the letter, but this has 
not happened. 
I had proposed that the letter be forwarded to me in first instance on my undertaking not to release without your 
client's express permission in each case. Would this be acceptable? 
Paul.

James, 
Unfortunately my client has heard nothing back from your client notwithstanding assurances that steps would be taken 
to resolve this issue. Can I ask you to follow-up before I take further instructions from my client? 
Thanks
