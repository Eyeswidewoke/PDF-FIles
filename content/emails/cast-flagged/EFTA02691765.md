As U.S. Steps Back, Europe Takes Bigger 
Role in Mideast Peace Push 
Mark Landler 
July 20, 2011 - It is a truism of Middle East peacemaking that the 
United States is the pivotal player — the most credible broker 
between the Israelis and the Palestinians. But with talks at a 
standstill, the Obama administration now finds itself on the sidelines, 
and Europe is emerging as the key diplomatic actor. 
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and the Palestinian 
president, Mahmoud Abbas, have crisscrossed the Continent in recent 
weeks, trying to woo leaders who are weighing whether to support a 
Palestinian bid for statehood at the United Nations in September. 
Neither man has visited Washington since the spring. 
That may suit the administration just fine. The White House, several 
officials said, has deliberately kept a low profile since President 
Obama's speech on the Middle East in May, in which he tried 
unsuccessfully to break the stalemate by proposing a starting 
point for negotiating the contours of a Palestinian state. 
Europe's rising role stems not only from American fatigue with a 
seemingly intractable problem, but also from the peculiar dynamics 
of the Palestinian campaign at the United Nations. With more than 
100 countries, most in the developing world, expected to support 
Palestinian recognition — and the United States almost certain to 
oppose it — Britain, France and Germany are viewed as influential 
swing votes.

"Rarely has Europe been so courted when it comes to Middle East 
diplomacy," said David Makovsky, a senior fellow at the Washington 
Institute for Near East Policy. "Europe is the prize this summer." 
For the Europeans, who have also taken a lead role in the NATO 
military campaign in Libya, the chance to play Middle East power 
broker is gratifying. But it comes with a risk, said Martin S. Indyk, 
director of foreign policy at the Brookings Institution and a former 
American ambassador to Israel. "The action in the United Nations is 
a bigger problem for them than for us," he said. "It has the potential 
of splitting the E.U., with some siding with us and Israel and some 
siding with the Palestinians." 
A rift is the last thing the European Union needs, at a time when the 
bloc is being strained by the debt crisis in Greece. Already, the major 
countries appear divided, with Germany and Italy rejecting the 
Palestinian campaign, France and Spain receptive, and Britain on the 
fence. 
For some Europeans, leaving the door open to Palestinian recognition 
is a handy way to pressure Israel to return to negotiations, which have 
been on ice since last fall. To break that deadlock, Mr. Obama 
proposed using the prevailing borders before the 1967 Arab-Israeli 
war, adjusted to account for Jewish settlements in the West Bank, as 
the basis for negotiating a new Palestinian state. Mr. Netanyahu 
initially rejected that formula, saying it would render Israel 
indefensible. But an Israeli official said that in recent weeks, Mr. 
Netanyahu had moved much closer to accepting the idea, provided 
that the Palestinians agreed to recognition of Israel as a Jewish state, 
something they have long refused. 
Last week, the United States tried to build support for such a quid pro 
quo from the Quartet, a Middle East peacemaking group that also 
includes the European Union, the United Nations and Russia. 
Winning the Quartet's endorsement would have put pressure on both

sides to resume negotiations and taken much of the steam out of the 
Palestinian march to the United Nations. 
While European countries have publicly backed Mr. Obama's 
proposal for restarting the talks, several of them, as well as Russia, 
balked at the Jewish-state provision, officials briefed on the meeting 
said. Rather than issue an anodyne statement, as it often does, the 
Quartet chose to say nothing at all. 
The Palestinian date with the United Nations looms large, though no 
one is exactly sure what will happen after it. Israel's defense minister, 
Ehud Barak, warned that his country faced a "diplomatic tsunami." 
Others worry that it will kick off a third intifada, given the political 
ferment elsewhere in the region. 
"The conditions for massive public reaction are ripe," Ghaith al-
Omani, the executive director of the American Task Force on 
Palestine, said. "If things go down that path, it would be highly 
destabilizing." 
The United States continues to work on European allies and the 
Palestinians to point out the downsides of going for recognition, 
including the threat that Congress could vote to cut off aid to the 
Palestinian Authority. 
Still, the administration has opted for what one Middle East diplomat 
called a "tactical withdrawal," leaving it to Tony Blair, the former 
British prime minister who is the special envoy to the Quartet, to try 
to close the gaps. While the United States does not want to be 
isolated by vetoing a Palestinian resolution, which Mr. Obama has 
signaled he will do, the administration appears less agitated by this 
prospect than it was a few months ago. 
"The U.S. is frustrated, but ultimately an outcome where it vetoes a 
resolution is not the end of the world," said Robert Malley, the 
Middle East and North Africa program director at the International 
Crisis Group.

Palestinian leaders insist they are determined to go through with the 
drive for recognition, but it could take less aggressive forms: 
petitioning the General Assembly, rather than the Security Council, 
for nonmember status, thus sidestepping an American veto. The 
Palestinians could even propose a resolution that echoes Mr. 
Obama's formula for talks. This is where Europe plays an important 
role. Without support from big countries like Britain and France, the 
Palestinians may opt to hold off or pursue a softer resolution. And if 
they go ahead at the Security Council, the Europeans could introduce 
an alternative resolution embracing Mr. Obama's principles. 
"The United States has put its cards on the table, but Europe has not 
yet done that," said Robert Danin, a senior fellow at the Council on 
Foreign Relations who used to run the Jerusalem office of the 
Quartet. "The run-up to September is not about numbers. It's about: 
Where does the West stand?"

What Explains Fashionable Hostility 
Toward Israel? 
Martin Peretz 
July 20, 2011 -- We live in a world in which the contagion of anti-
Semitism is spreading once again. Indeed, the profusion of hostility 
to Israel is the proof that hatred of Jews is now quite alright, thank 
you. But, whatever individual and isolated wrongs Israel commits, 
there are comparisons to be drawn. And the comparisons are to the 
Arab states and to Palestinian Arab society, in which oppression has 
flourished since the early years of the last century. And has not 
stopped flourishing yet. 
There must be a certain frisson that attaches to the loathing of Jews 
and of Israel by the chic folk who express it and cotton to it, like 
those who carried around Mao's "Little Red Book" in a previous 
generation or wore a Che Guevara sweatshirt long after everyone 
knew he was a murderer. In the last few months and around the 
Cannes movie festival season, the world was treated to notable 
outbursts of malignance targeting the Jewish people and its polity. 
From the first generation of the new cinema to its most recent 
fashionable eminence came declarations of revulsion against the 
nation designated for hate: the first from Jean-Luc Godard and the 
last from Lars von Trier. At just about the same time, the idolized 
Greek composer Mikis Theodorakis pronounced his wisdom: 
"Everything that happens in the world today has to do with the 
Zionists," including the Greek financial catastrophe. And, of course, 
John Galliano, poor John Galliano who worked in the schmata trade. 
This is actually something of an epidemic. In Europe, the epidemic

has also infected both the political and journalistic congregations—
although in somewhat, but only somewhat, less hateful language. 
Western Europe does not especially like Jews or Israelis, but it also 
doesn't want Arabs or Muslims as neighbors. 
America is not alone in the world in its friendship for Israel or in its 
historical hospitality to Jews. Already, in the days of the early Jewish 
migration to the United States, the new arrivals grasped that this was 
di goldene medinah, the golden country. The American people are 
allies of the state of Israel, however much its prime minister irritates 
Barack Obama. More to the point: The relationship between America 
and Israel is about historic and strategic ties, not about whether 
Obama is offended by Bibi's rhetorical style. But why is he so 
offended? Is he as offended by President Chavez of Venezuela? 
Right-wing anti-Semitism in the country is now fundamentally a bad 
memory. Yes, of course, Pat Buchanan! And who else? But left-wing 
anti-Semitism is now an advancing reality, one that traces its past to 
the scheissjuden of Karl Marx. Still, essential anti-Semitism is hard 
to express except in jokes about the garish Jewish rich, which itself is 
an expiring phenomenon. The timorous Jew no longer exists: He has 
been
