| **Subject** | Re: Dining =oom HI Kim, Thank you for this updated quote. I'm wondering if you =ould have someone come over to the house to do a proper measure of the =oom before we submit this order for production? If I remember =orrectly, I don't think anyone EFTA_R1_01193042 EFTA02309874 has measured the room, but we were just =oing off of the floor plans. Is it possible to set up a measurement =his week, then we can finalize the =rder? Thank =ou! Marc leaves for Nepal this Friday and I will make sure he =iscusses expediting this order with our production =anager. I have worked very successfully with Sarah over the past =even years, and value Jeffrey's business. In these =ifficult times, we cannot afford to lose a very good customer =hrough bad service and =iscommunication. Please call me if you have any other =uestions.
