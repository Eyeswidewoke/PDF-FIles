Thank you so much for checking on the flight, I am currently booked for is Japan airlines flight #6 departing from Tokyo Narita airport at 11:00am on Fri, but I am also on the waitlist for 7:30pm flight in case they release any seats. So at the moment I would have to be at the airport at 9:00am I think, how much time approximately do you think it should take to get there from the hotel? Thank you! And have a wonderful day! Karyna On Feb 22, 2017, at 9:29 AM, Good morning Karyna! I hope this finds you GENKI!! Karyna, do you have your return flight on the 24th fixed? No rush but thought to check if you have that fixed by now. Have a lovely day ahead!
