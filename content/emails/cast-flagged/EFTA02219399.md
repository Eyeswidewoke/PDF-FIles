| **From** | Nili Priell Barak |
| **To** | Jeff Epstein Arrived to an Israeli kind of weather. Very hot. But we always like to complain. NY is beautiful. The apartment is beautiful and the flowers are great, as well as the fruit. Thanks a lot. Concerning the window shades. They repaired only one widow in the bedroom. The other one, the small one - both shades don't work! Could you please ask him/them to arrange the other one too? thanks Nili EFTA_R1_00953568 EFTA02219399 |
