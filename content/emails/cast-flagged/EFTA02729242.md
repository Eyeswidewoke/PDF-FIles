Jeffrey Epstein - a self-proclaimed billionaire who hobnobs with moguls and pledged 525 million to Harvard - is 
actually a small potatoes ex-bounty hunter with a questionable financial background, says a report. 
Epstein, a 50-year-old Ralph Lauren lookalike who claims to manage a billionaires-only fund, has made 
headlines for his high- society lifestyle; among his attention-grabbing moves was flying President Clinton and 
Kevin Spacey to Africa on a private jet. 
But a report in the March issue of Vanity Fair, on newsstands this week, unmasks Epstein's mystery image. 
Epstein wasn't exactly the top gun at Bear Steams, as he claims - and left the firm amid a swirl of rumors and an 
SEC violation, the article said. 
His mentor in high finance was Steve Hoffenberg, the bill collector turned hustler now serving 20 years in prison 
for running the nation's costliest Ponzi scheme, the report says. 
The article says that when Epstein worked for Hoffenberg, he cooked up some of Hoffenberg's questionable 
financing deals - a claim Epstein has denied. 
Epstein has also been involved in numerous lawsuits, including one in which Citibank is suing him for defaulting 
on 520 million in loans from its private banking arm. 
Epstein and his lawyer, Jeffrey Schantz, couldn't be reached for comment on the article. 
The article said that Epstein keeps all his deals and clients secret, except for one - retail magnate Leslie 
Wexner, who calls Epstein "smart . . . (with) high standards . . . and a loyal friend."

SOCIETY GIRL AT TWITS' END 
Neal Travis. New York Post. New York, N.Y.: Dec 1, 2000. pg. 009 
Abstract (Document Summary) 
THINGS may be turning sour for gal-about-town Ghislaine Maxwell. daughter of the fat and fraudulent former 
owner of the Daily News, the late Robert Maxwell. I hear that some of the 39-year-old Ghislaine's friends on the 
Manhattan and London party circuit are cutting her because she's had so much adverse press over her 
relationship with Prince Andrew. Fergie's ex, with whom she recently attended a downtown S8M-themed party. 
Her relationship with "Randy Andy" is said to be platonic, but the socially prominent women in Ghislaine's "set" 
have recently sworn off any kind of publicity.

THINGS may be turning sour for gal-about-town Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of the fat and fraudulent former 
owner of the Daily News, the late Robert Maxwell. I hear that some of the 39-year-old Ghislaine's friends on the 
Manhattan and London party circuit are cutting her because she's had so much adverse press over her 
relationship with Prince Andrew, Fergie's ex, with whom she recently attended a downtown S&M-themed party. 
Her relationship with "Randy Andy" is said to be platonic, but the socially prominent women in Ghislaine's "set" 
have recently swom off any kind of publicity. A series of lacerating articles - and the publication of the vapid 
"Bright Young Things? written by one of their own, Brooke de Ocampo - has portrayed this crowd as a bunch of 
twits living off their trust funds. 
Ghislaine's own funds are something of a mystery. Her father lavished money on her and set her up in at least 
one business in New York. But Maxwell's own ill-gotten gains were seized after he took a dive off his yacht, 
which was named for her. There are plenty of British pensioners who lost their only means of support in the 
crash of Maxwell's house of cards and who find it obscene that Ghislaine manages to own an apartment on the 
Upper East Side and a mews house in London. 
She is said to be on some kind of retainer from mysterious New York financier Jeffrey Epstein, who reportedly 
has holdings in several major companies. Epstein also likes the company of attractive young women, and it's 
said that Ghislaine has been very good about introducing him to some of her pals. 
Ghislaine and her two elder sisters don't talk about where their money is coming from, but they are said to be 
heavily involved in some kind of Internet company. It would be awful luck for Ghislaine if her social standing 
were diminished at the same time as tech stocks are going down the toilet.
