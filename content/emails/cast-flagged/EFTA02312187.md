He told me that he had found out that t=e guys had been scheduled for vacation time, so he confirmed they would be b=ck in apt today but this morning he texted me to say they wont be back in u=til Monday 2/11 • I will go there again on Monday and hopefully they can fi=ish up, I think there is about 3 - 4 days work left.
