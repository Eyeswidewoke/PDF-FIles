I will give you the full itinerary as soon as it shapes up...lt will include the cell numbers and email addresses of all the guests so you will be prepared. I know Sue and Sarah have both done this Harvard trip before and can help you with any questions you might have...does she need a key? Do one of you still have a key? I know there will be a lunch on Sunday at 12:30 so food will need to be ordered...can you suggest to karyna something...also, Henry Rosovsky hopes Jeffrey has a drink for him at his 5:00 appt on Sat...not sure what kind of drink he means??! perhaps coffee? Anyway, I'm sure y'all can clue Karyna in on what to do/expect...(or maybe you have been before Karyna? I'm not sure) Larry is organizing a car to pick you up from the airport on Sat. and take you to martin's institute. the Charles Hotel is right near by...Larry should be coordinating a car to take you back to the airport as well on Sunday. I will forward you the confirmation to the Charles Hotel now... EFTA_R1_01265857 EFTA02331878 |
