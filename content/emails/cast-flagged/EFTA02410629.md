After talking with Melinda I have decided to leave New York City after the Pete Peterson 
meeting. 
So this means I won't have time to do another meeting and I won't be able to do the dinner with 
Jeff Epstein. 
I was looking forward to the dinner. Nathan had agreed with you that I would enjoy meeting with 
him and that it is a fine thing to do so on another trip I will try and do it.
