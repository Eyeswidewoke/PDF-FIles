| **From** | Sent :19 PM Subject Admission Decision harvard As we talked before i promised to let you know as soon as i got my letter from harvard, the only bad thing is that is was not an aceptancy letter. But i guess it is know too late to do anything... laura >April 1, 2004 >Ms >Dear Ms. >I am very sorry to inform you that it is not possible to offer you >admission to the Class of 2008. I wish I were writing to report a >different decision, but the competition was so rigorous this year >that there were many outstanding young men and women to whom we >could not offer places in the class. >Nearly twenty thousand students applied for the sixteen hundred and >fifty places in the freshman class. The great majority of the >applicants could certainly have been successful here academically, >and most candidates presented strong personal and extracurricular >credentials as well. The Committee was, therefore, faced with the >necessity of choosing a class from a great many more talented and >highly qualified students than it had room to admit. >We wish it were possible for us to admit more of our fine >applicants, and we understand how difficult the college application >process can be for students and their families. While the Committee >conducted its deliberations with the utmost care, we know that no >one can predict with certainty what an individual will accomplish >during college or beyond. Past experience suggests that the >particular college a student attends is far less important than what >the student does to develop his or her strengths and talents over >the next four years. >We very much appreciate the interest you have shown in Harvard >College. We hope that you will accept the best wishes of the >Committee for success in all your future endeavors. >Sincerely, >William R.
