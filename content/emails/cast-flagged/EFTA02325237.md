| **Subject** | Small change in cleaning schedule Hello ladies, We need to make a small change in the cleaning schedule of your =partments. It would be better for Sonam to clean all three of your =laces on Tuesdays, so that she can spend a full day at 301, and then =he would do mine on Wednesday morning and go back to 71st after she is =one. And thank you again to our wonderful Sonam for keeping our places so =lean!!
