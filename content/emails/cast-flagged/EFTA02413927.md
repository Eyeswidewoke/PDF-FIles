Britain's Prince Andrew regaled a bevy of media heavyweights at billionaire Jeffrey Epstein's 
Upper East Side townhouse the other night when he told of the royal family's joy over Prince 
William's upcoming wedding to Kate Middleton -- and the glamorous guests asked for 
invitations. 
Andrew was quizzed by guests including Katie Couric, George Stephanopoulos, Charlie Rose, 
Woody Allen and Chelsea Handler at the dinner thrown by Epstein, who is old friends with 
Prince Andrew. 
Our source said, "Most of the talk started off about trade and industry, but by dessert, everybody 
couldn't hold back and asked him about the wedding. 
"Andrew said the Queen and the royal family are delighted, Kate is a terrific girl, but they were 
all expecting the announcement since she and William have been together for so long," the witness 
said. 
"While marveling at the massive interest the wedding has sparked in the US and among his 
companions, Andrew also compared himself to Prince Harry. He laughed, 'Like Harry, I'm just 
the younger brother.' " 
Andrew, brother to Prince Charles, was dubbed the "Playboy Prince" and was undergoing pilot 
training in the Royal Air Force when Charles married Diana Spencer in 1981. 
Our spy said, "He was amused that his dinner companions were so interested in every detail. What 
would Kate wear, what would the Queen wear, would his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson be invited? 
But he politely batted it away and said, 'I don't know, I've been out of [Britain] on business.' But 
he did say he'd be involved in planning the wedding. 
"Everyone at the table, including Woody Allen, jokingly asked him for an invite to the wedding, 
but he just smiled." CBS anchor Couric told him she'll be broadcasting live from outside 
Westminster Abbey and asked, "If I c-mail your BlackBerry, will you give me the details on what 
is happening inside?" 
Epstein, who recently finished a jail term for soliciting prostitutes, and Prince Andrew have been 
close friends for years. Epstein has stayed at Sandringham and vacationed with the prince in 
Thailand, while Andrew has visited his Manhattan home many times.
