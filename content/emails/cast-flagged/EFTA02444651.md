Microfluidics 
The Whitesides Group is very active in microfluidics. Our 
previous accomplishments in the field include work on 
laminar flow in microchannels (Figures 1,2), fabrication of 
three-dimensional channel topologies (Figures 3) and 
mixing by chaotic advection (Figure 4). We have also 
applied microfluidics to fabricate monodisperse polymer, 
hydrogel, and metal microparticles coated with thin, nylon-
coated membranes (Figure 5). Currently, we are working on 
several projects related to microfluidics, including 
exploiting the behavior of bubbles and droplets for mixing 
and other applications, manipulating samples 
electrokinetically and probing the use of solder as electrodes 
in microchannels. 
Bubbles and Droplets in Microchannels 
Our recent experiments in microfluidics include 
investigations into the behavior of bubbles and droplets in 
microchannels. Specifically, we are interested in four sub-
areas: (I) enhanced mixing in microfluidic systems using 
bubbles; (2) the paths from monodisperse to chaotic 
bubbling in flow-focusing devices; (3) the production of 
bubbles with uniquely high periodicities in modified flow-
focusing systems; (4) the path-selection process that bubbles 
demonstrate as they move through a network. Mixing in 
microchannels, in particular, is an important challenge in 
the microfluidics subgroup of our laboratory (the other areas 
introduced here are described further in the complexity 
section of the website). 
Mixing between streams of fluid that flow in a laminar 
fashion is difficult to achieve. Previously, we have 
introduced a method to enhance mixing involving multiple 
lithographic steps. Our current work uses bubbles to 
facilitate the folding over of streams of fluid as they proceed 
through a network of microchannels (Movie 6). The bubbles 
partially block the channels in which they move, causing a 
portion of a stream of bulk fluid to cross over into the 
SIMMS

channel in which the other stream moves. This process is 
repeated several times before the streams are mixed fully, 
with the final mixing device occupying an area of only a 
square millimeter on the chip. 
Electrokinetic Flow in Microfluidic Channels 
We are exploring electrokinetically-driven microfluidic 
systems for separation of complex biological samples. Our 
ultimate goal is to provide a new sample handling method 
(femtomole/nL) for proteomic analysis and high-throughput 
biochemical assays. Currently, we are investigating 
geometrical designs, surface coatings and concentration 
techniques such as isotachophoresis. 
TWIST Valves 
We have developed a new approach for controlling the flow 
of fluids in microfluidic channels. TWIST valves consist of 
small machine screws (500 um diameter) embedded in a 
layer of polyurethane cast above microfluidic channels 
fabricated in poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS). The 
polyurethane is cured photochemically with the screws in 
place; on curing, it bonds to the surrounding layer of PDMS 
and forms a stiff layer that retains an impression of the 
threads of the screws (Figure 7). The valves are separated 
from the ceiling of microfluidic channels by a layer of 
PDMS, and are integrated into channels using a simple 
procedure compatible with rapid prototyping. Turning the 
screws actuates the valves by collapsing the PDMS layer 
between the valve and channel, controlling the flow of 
fluids in the underlying channels. These valves have the 
useful characteristic that they do not require power to retain 
their setting (on/off). They also allow settings between "on" 
and "off', resist large back pressures (>350 kPa) without 
failure, and can be integrated into portable, disposable 
microfluidic devices for carrying out biological assays 
(Figure 8). 
TWIST Pumps 
We have designed a system for storing and pumping fluids 
in microfluidic devices fabricated in poly(dimethylsiloxane) 
(PDMS) using TWIST valves. The method uses valves to 
isolate microfluidic reservoirs that are filled with solutions 
of reagents under pressure; the fluid is released, and the 
flow rate controlled, by opening one of the valves. Figure 9 
shows a microfluidic pump fabricated using this approach.

Fluidic Optics 
Photonics deals with photons as a medium for transmitting 
information. Typically, photonic circuits either rely on 
passive devices with pre-designed optical functions, or use 
active components where application of external fields 
changes the optical properties of the materials (e.g. in 
electro-optical devices). Our projects in fluidic optics 
explore alternatives to application of external fields - in 
these projects we demonstrate the generation and 
reconfiguration of photonic devices in real time by 
manipulating flowing liquids. 
Fluid Optical Waveguides 
We take advantage of laminar flow in microscopic channels 
(i.e. microfluidic systems) and of diffusion. In the simplest 
demonstration, we sandwich a fluid of higher index of 
refraction between two streams of liquid with lower index 
of refraction (Figuire 1). In microchannels, the liquids 
flowing through the channel will not mix except by 
molecular diffusion; thus, the flow is laminar and the two 
liquids flowing side-by-side form an optically smooth 
interface [1,2]. This system acts as a waveguide (we call it a 
"liquid-liquid" or L2 waveguide). 
Fluid optical waveguides are fabricated easily and rapidly in 
organic polymers using the convenient techniques for rapid 
prototyping developed in our group. The L2 waveguides are 
dynamic their structure and function depend on a continuous 
flow of the core and cladding liquids. They can be 
reconfigured, renewed (if damaged), and continuously 
adapted in ways that are not possible with solid-state 
waveguides. Manipulation of the rate of flow and the 
composition of the liquids (thus the optical properties) tunes 
the characteristics of these optical systems in real time. 
Currently, we are studying the design and operation of fluid 
analogs of several common optical elements: single- and 
multi-mode waveguides, optical switches, and evanescent 
couplers [3].

Generation of Light in Microchannels 
We have also demonstrated that fluid waveguides can 
generate light in microchannels, thus simplifying the 
coupling of light from external sources to these fluidic 
devices [4]. When laminar streams of fluorescent organic 
dyes are separated by a low index fluid and illuminated by 
an incandescent light source (Figure 2), they each produce 
fluorescence of specific color that can be collected and 
propagated by a fluid waveguide. One can tune the 
wavelength (color), position, shape and intensity of these 
microfluidic light sources by making adjustments of the rate 
of flow or composition of individual streams. Such simple 
fluidic light sources could be important, for example, for 
microanalysis "on-chip" in integrated biophotonic 
microsystems. 
Microfluidic Dye Laser 
We used microfluidic technology to design a miniaturized 
waveguide dye laser, in which the laser cavity contained a 
liquid core-liquid cladding waveguide (Figure 3). The key 
feature of the laser is a long optical path length along the 
waveguide axis that allows us to achieve high gain in one 
pass and thus lower the threshold for lasing. By adding thin 
gold coatings on the surfaces of the T-junctions, we built the 
laser mirrors into flouresent L2 waveguide light source. 
Rhodamine 640 perchlorate dissolved in methanol served as 
the core stream, and pure methanol worked as the cladding 
stream. Optical pumping of the microlaser with a 532-nm 
frequency-doubled Nd:YAG laser at 50 Hz results in the 
bandwidth decrease by an order of magnitude at laser 
threshold (Figure 4). The fluid waveguide laser is readily 
tunable by continuously varying the composition of the 
mixed solvent (methanol-dimethylsulfoxide) while using the 
same concentration of the dye. The ability to easily change 
wavelength is critical for applications in spectroscopy and 
for various types of optical detection requiring different 
wavelengths.
