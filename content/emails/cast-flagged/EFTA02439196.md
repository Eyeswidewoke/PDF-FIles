Meeting 
Jeffrey, 
I had a nice meeting with Andrew. He treats your friends very well. He thought there was a substantive

President of IGY. Andrew left and I talked with Charles and his associate and they mutually had sufficient 
interest. We set up another meeting at 11:30 a.m. at their offices in New York on July 1st.
