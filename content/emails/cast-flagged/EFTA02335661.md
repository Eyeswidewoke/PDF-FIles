| **Subject** | RE: We did not actually go to a shop, but we went to a large building (mall like) that had literally hundreds of shops that sold fake watches fake handbags and just about anything else that you can imagine. You can go to any of the watch booths in fact you will probably have to go to several to get the 50 I am now after. The shops if I remember rightly were on the 5th floor. If you see any great handbags Gucci. Hermes, Versace, Fendi up to 10/12 you can buy those or great belts, in fact just about anything that you like that looks fun stylish and something that I can give as a gift and have it be appreciated.
