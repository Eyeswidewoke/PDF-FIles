| **Subject** | Re: G, Thanks so much for all your help. I will do my best. I desperately need the galley which Carole kindly offered to provide, but I don't know if she got my e-response. We're under the gun, time-wise, so I wonder if u cl ring her or give me her weekend number (I'm in Hamptons) so pub can messenger to NYC or fedex to Hamptons. Also need to meet w carole asap. Thanks so much! Lunch next week? Again, I will try my very best-the excerpt is amazingly written-and will pass on photo info. Have a lovely holiday, Jeffrey x Fedex: Original Message |
