If you click on the PDF file below you can see all the custom size options of this cabinet.. plain white, very simple, good quality. Below are examples of different items within the same collection so you can see the simple white design of it. You can get both 16" or 20" deep shelves in numerous combos of lengths and heights, and choose whatever door you want, solid, glass, single, double, with adjustable shelves inside as well as drawers. I think it's a winner.. thoughts? 1 EFTA_R1_01225846 EFTA02318852 |
