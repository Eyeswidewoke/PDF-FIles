The third problem can be posed =93 though few will understand it. The first two can be posed but the=e is no known 
way to address them — the first for reasons that Dick Lewontin explained in his important paper on evolution of 
cognit=on (which those who write about the topic refuse to read), the second beca=se it reaches to issues that are total 
mysteries even in much simpler doma=ns — perhaps, though many don't to contemplate the fact, because of limits of 
human cognitive capacity. =AO Puppet and puppeteer, again. 
There are lots of narrower problems that can be posed, but there are issues=of general import. 
What was very special, maybe unique, about Hilbert in 1900 was the advances=in the field had reached the point so that 
questions had that miraculous c=mbination of being (1) potentially within reach and (2) of very great impo=t for the field 
of mathematics. That's hard to achieve. 
Will think more about it — re=eating the Hebrew words to myself. Did you learn them as a kid in He=rew school?

The main questions that interest me a=e about origin of the language faculty, which, I think, created modern 
humans, the most unusual, nutty, and remarkable of all biological p=enomena. There are two problems that seem 
beyond reach: the origin o= elementary human concepts, which appear to be radically different from an=thing in the 
animal world; and the "creative aspect of language use," the phenomenon that astonished Galileo, D=scartes, and other 
leading figures since. The third problem has to d= with what we've been calling "the Basic Property"=of language: a 
recursive procedure that generates an infinite array of hierarchically structured expressions interpreted at the 
interfaces, pr=marily the conceptual-intentional interface, providing a "language=of thought." The most fundamental 
question here is to what extent =he Strong Minimalist Thesis (SMT) holds, that is, to what extent has nature produced a 
perfect solution to the Basic Propert=, which underlies our creative capacities in language (and probably much e=se). 
That problem can be addressed, and has been, I think with some succes=. 
Very generous proposal. Made go=d sense for Hilbert in 1900, given the advances of the past century. These 
enabled him to formulate problems of deep mathematical significance =n a form that was not too far from 
contemporary understanding.</=> 
But my feeling is that the cognitive =ciences is nowhere near that stage. It's possible to pose ma=y narrower 
problems, and that's in fact what people work on from gra= school on to the limits of research. But understanding, I 
think, ha= probably not reached the stage where one can sensibly do what Hilbert did= 
Others incidentally disagree =93 as is usually the case.

Forty years ago, Israel was one of th= most admired countries in the world. Now it is most disliked. 
Forty years ago it was pretty clear, as I wrote at the time (and I was far=from alone), that those who call themselves 
"supporters of Israel=E2 are in fact supporters of its moral degeneration, international i=olation, constant conflict and

security problems, and maybe worse. So it has occurred. Israel even now has an of=icial whose task is to deal with 
international isolation.=/u> 
Israelis like to attribute all this to anti-Semitism, which hasn't =hanged in the past 40 years. Or to appeal 
to "we have no neg=tiating partner," which won't wash. The problem is n=t Netanyahu. The policies and problems are 
much deeper. The cr=cial question is how long and how far will Israel proceed on the course to self-destruct=on. 
A lot of work in AI, neural network t=eory, "Big Data and statistics," etc., is as you describe =E2 
mimicking behavior (which I don't even find amazing or particularly interest=ng). But I think you underestimate the 
theoretical insights and expl=nations, such as the few I mentioned in the papers I sent, the theories th=t yield 
explanations for such surprising phenomena as rigidity and structure-dependence, with their far-reaching 
consequences= Those I think are the kinds of results that are rarely found outsid= the hard sciences. They don't mimic 
behavior, but explain f=ndamental properties of cognitive processes that enter into behavior, of course indirectly. And 
there's a lot=more like it.

We'll probably be at the Cape= in Wellfleet, if we can make it. 
Maybe there are miracles, but I think=more prosaic approaches yield rich results in domains like 
vision (Marr's main concern) and language. Like some of those I =80 ye mentioned. I don't see how to progress in other

Marr, , -try, probabilty, , symmetry. ent=opy. it might look like computation but it is not. it

I wouldn't take the term =80 mechanism" too literally. It refers to whatever is taki=g 
place in the brain. For some, as most of those in the Nowak group, it means neural nets. =For Gallistel, it's processes 
internal to the cell. Useful t= look at these matters in terms of Marr's three levels: computatio=, algorithm, mechanism.

Not a trivial matter. I'm not the=best person to ask. I'd suggest 
contacting people who =99ve really thought seriously about these issues, like Robert Pollin, a fi=e independent 
economist at U Mass Amherst 
2.=C2 
Sherman's speculation is an interesting exten=ion of recent discoveries 
about conservation, deep homologies, regulatory =ircuits, and other elements of what's sometimes called "the evo-devo 
revolution." It remains to be seen whether a=ything can be done with it. I think you underestimate the contributi=ns of 
Berwick and his students, including Yang.
