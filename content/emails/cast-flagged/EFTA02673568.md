At the moment, the best way to communicate with another person on the information highway is to exchange 
electronic mail: to write a message on a computer and send it =through the telephone lines into someone else's 
computer. In the future, people will send each other sound and pictures as well as text, and do =it in real time, and 
improved technology will make it possible to have =rich, human electronic exchanges, but at present E-mail is the 
closest =thing we have to that. Even now, E-mail allows you to meet and communicate with people in a way that would

Dear Bill, 
I am the guy who is writing the article about you for The New =orker. It occurs to me that we ought to be able to

You could begin by telling me what you think is unique about e-mail =s a form of communication.

E-mail is a unique communication vehicle for a lot of reasons. =owever email is not a substitute for direct 
interaction.... 
There are people who I have corresponded with on email for months before actually meeting them--people at 
work and otherwise. If someone isn't saying something of interest its easier to =not respond to their mail than it is not to 
answer the phone. In fact I =give out my home phone number to almost no one but my email address is =known very 
broadly. I am the only person who reads my email so no one has to worry about embarrassing themselves or going 
around people when =they send a message. Our email is completely secure. ...

Email helps out with other types of communication. It allows you to exchange a lot of information in advance of 
a meeting =and make the meeting far far more valuable... 
Email is not a good way to get mad at someone since you can't interact. You can send friendly messages very 
easily since those are harder to misinterpret. 
We began to E-mail each other three or four times a week. I would have a question about something and say to myself, 
"I'm going to E-mail Bill about that," and I'd write him a message and get a =one- or two-page message back within 
twenty-four hours, sometimes much =sooner. At the beginning of our electronic relationship, I would wake up in the 
middle of the night and lie in bed wondering if I had E-mail from Bill. Generally, he seemed to write messages at night, 
sleep (maybe), then send them the next morning. We were intimate in a curious =way, in the sense of being wired into 
each other's minds, but our contact was elaborately stylized, like ballroom dancing. 
In some ways, my E-mail relationship with Bill was like an ongoing, monthlong conversation, except that there was a 
pause =after each response to think; it was like football players huddling up =after each play. There was no beginning or 
end to Gates' messages--no time wasted on stuff like "Dear" and "Yours"--and I quickly corrected this etiquette breach in 
my own messages. Nor were there any fifth-grade-composition-book standards like "It may have come to your attention 
that" and "Looking forward to hearing from you." Social niceties are not what Bill Gates is about. Good spelling is not 
what Bill Gates is about, either. He never signed his messages to me, but sometimes he put an "&" at the end, which, I 
learned, means "Write =back" in E-mail language. After a while, he stopped putting the "&," but I wrote back anyway. He

For years after the telephone was invented, in 1876, people thought it was a device that would transmit news, 
drama, and music: the idea that the telephone was a way to talk to other people took about twenty years to sink in 
here, and about thirty years in Europe. Similarly, today one hears about shopping, banking, and renting =movies on the 
information highway. These are all possible ways of making money, of course, but the point of the information highway, 
it seems to me, is that it offers a new way of talking to other people. The trouble people have understanding this simple 
point is the same trouble people =in the nineteenth century had understanding the telephone. 
Bill Gates, aged thirty-eight, is one of the richest men in the country--the richest in 1992, and the second richest, after 
the investor Warren Buffett, in 1993, with a fortune of =six billion one hundred and sixty million dollars, according to 
Forbes. =Last March, when he announced his engagement to Melinda French, a twenty-nine-year-old manager at 
Microsoft, the news made the front page =of the Wall Street Journal. Gates controls the computer industry to an 
=extent matched by no other person in any other major industry. The Justice Department is currently trying to 
determine whether his control =constitutes a monopoly. 
Microsoft now supplies eighty per cent of all the personal-computer operating-system software in the world--that is, the 
=layer of software that translates your commands so that the computer can act on them--and fifty per cent of all the 
application software, which =is the tools, like Microsoft Word (writing) and Excel (accounting), that run on top of the 
operating system. Microsoft uses its leverage in the =operating-system market as a competitive advantage in the 
applications =market--a practice that is not nice but is not necessarily illegal. "You could say, as I have said to Bill, that 
having achieved this much power you should turn your attention to being magnanimous," a rival software =executive 
told me. "But Bill believes that now is not the time for statesmanship. Now is the time to conquer new foes, plunder new 
lands. =He doesn't like being compared to John D. Rockefeller--he goes, 'Hey, I'm not a grasping monopolist, am l?'--but 
he doesn't know how to behave any other way. To hold war councils and to design strategies with the =explicit aim of

crushing an opponent--this is very American. You know, =Mother Teresa is not going to build the broadband network of 
the future." 
Recently, the wife of a software developer was listening to her husband describe for me what it was like to be in the 
=same industry as Bill Gates: he was saying, in a pained but stoical way, that maybe Gates didn't have to be quite so 
competitive now that he had achieved great power, and that it might be better for the computer industry as a whole if 
he behaved in a more benevolent way, when his wife interrupted and said to me, "No. You don't understand. We talk 
about Bill Gates every night at home. We think about Bill Gates all the =time. It's like Bill Gates lives with us." This 
enveloping sense of Bill Gates is hard for someone outside the computer industry to fathom. To =people who are 
unfamiliar with computers, Gates is just a nerd, and if =you try to get them to square the negative connotation of the 
word "nerd" with Gates' incredible success, and with the fact that, far from =being on the margin of society, Gates is 
now in a position to determine =what society is like, they're likely to say, "Well, I guess it really is the revenge of the 
nerds." Actually, Gates probably represents the end =of the word "nerd" as we know it. 
But all Gates' influence and success are small potatoes compared with the influence he could have and with the 
opportunity that now lies before him. The computer, which in twenty-five years has evolved from a room-size 
mainframe into a laptop device, appears to be turning into a new kind of machine. The new machine will =be a 
communications device that connects people to the information highway. It will penetrate far beyond the fifteen per 
cent of American =households that now own a computer, and it will control, or absorb, other communications machines 
now in people's homes--the phone, the fax, the television. It will sit in the living room, not in the study. The =problem of 
getting people to feel comfortable with such a powerful machine will be partly solved by putting it inside one of the 
most unobtrusive objects in the house--the set-top converter, which is the featureless black box on top of a cable-
connected TV set (the one the cat likes to sit on if the VCR is occupied). 
Gates would like to have his software inside that box. Microsoft's ambition is to supply the standard operating-system 
software for the information-highway machine, ju
