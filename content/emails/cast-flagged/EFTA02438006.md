Hi Andrew, 
Tomorrow, I am flying to Paris. I am not sure if I am staying in Europe scouting or coming back to NY, I 
should know in a couple of days. 
I am back for sure at the end of the month. In two days, I should be able to tell you. 
Best

Hello Andrew, 
It was a pleasure to speak with you. 
I have asked an updated financial report of MC2, New York, Miami, I shall send it to you within 2 
weeks. 
From there, if you are still interested, I can prepare a 5 years plan with 2 options

In any case, I am looking forward to meet you.
