Jeffrey: 
I talked to Gary and he will be contacting Andrew and will be available to interview potential 
general contractors on your behalf. 
I have been studying the Gensler plans for your home expansion and I wanted to make sure that 
you arc aware that much of the house expansion that is under roof is not air conditioned. If you 
look at page 37 of their plans, note that the only air conditioned spaces on the main level are the 
north & south pavilions and the east & west cabanas. I know you love your a/c so I wanted to 
make 
sure you realize this. Let me know if you have any questions.
