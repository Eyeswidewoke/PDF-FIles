| **Subject** | Jeffrey Epstein Hi Ian, I wanted to touch base with you to see if you are still planning on =oming to Jeffrey's island this Friday or Saturday. If you are, will you =e coming with anyone, and where will you be flying from? I'm trying to =ort out my own schedule with flying down to St. Thomas, and I thought =erhaps if you were going and flying from NY, we could fly together. Please let me know what you are thinking.
