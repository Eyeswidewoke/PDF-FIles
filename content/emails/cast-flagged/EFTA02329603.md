I suggest that this be done immediately (Monday) as I am=sure that nothing will get done in the government offices the week of Than=sgiving. Ms. Hendricks is set to process your paper work for the mal=ractice insurance but I am more concerned about the Bureau of Internal Rev=nue re your tax clearance letter. That being said, Ms. Hendricks' la=t day in the office is Tuesday, November 30th so we need to get the applic=ble form into her soon as well.
