Can I have the address of the ranch please? i would like to do some research on supermarkets and possibly farms in that area as well.

If you want to send some things ahead to the ranch if that's easier too, you can do that. On Jul 10, 2012, at 2:55 PM, wrote: I'm not sure what that means for me? Does that mean I go from LSJ to PB to NM along with him? Please let me know when you get more info. I will need to pack accordingly... This will be my first time to Ranch and i will need to bring a few things there. On Tue, Jul 10, 2012 at 2:47 PM, wrote: 1< <mailto > > Just a heads up to you..
