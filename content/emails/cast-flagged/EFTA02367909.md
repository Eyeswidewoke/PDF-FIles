DEAR FRIEND 
</a 
<=p> 
Consider This 
</=pan> 
Trying to come to terms with=President Trump's proposal to increase the US military budget by an additional $54 billion 
I ran across a 2015 article in ProPublica — We Blew $17 Billion in Afghanistan. How Would You Have Spent It? —=/b> And 
boy did it blow my mind. It is estimated that the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq will eventually cost American taxpaye=s 
$4 to $6 trillion, if not more. The truth is that everything we spent in these unnecessary wars is a waste but =he $17 
billion that fell through the cracks is unconscionable, especially when=the President wants to cut programs for the poor, 
children and elderly to give =he military an additional $54 billion. 
The U.S. government has wasted b=llions of dollars in Afghanistan, but until ProPublica in 2015, no one has added it all 
up.40=A0 Project after project blundered ahead ignoring history, culture and warnings of failure. And Congress has 
barely bli=ked as the financial toll has mounted. Here's just what the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan 
Reconstruction found.Q=A0 ProPublica listed all of the US programs in Afghanistan and their waste and across the page 
government programs where the money wou=d have been better spent. See for yourself how that money could have 
been use= at home as well as the actual ProPublica article in its entirety via the web t=nk below. 
Web Link: Behold, American taxpayer, what happened to nearly a half billion of your dollars i= Afghanistan:

=p class="MsoNormal">One example of the many: In 2008, the Pentagon bought 20 refurbished cargo planes for the 
Afghan Air Force, but as one top U.S. officer put it, "just about everythi=g you can think of was wrong." No spare parts, 
for example. The planes were a=so "a death trap," according to the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan 
Reconstruction. So $486 million was spent on worthless planes that no one c=uld fly. We did recoup some of the 
investment. Sixteen of the planes were sold =s scrap for the grand sum of $32,000. That's six cents a pound.=/span> 
And what a bill it is. There4,=99s a widely held idea of "just" as in "just a few million." Like the military officer who 
wrot= that the $25 million blown on a fancy headquarters nobody used was "probably not=bad in the grand scheme of 
things." But those millions add up. To billions. 
The problem, contrary to popular=assumptions, is not unscrupulous contractors. Follow the long trail of waste and 
you'll=be standing at the doors of the military, the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International 
Development. It's their bad decisions, bad purchases =nd bad programs that are consistently to blame. 
ProPublica examined more th=n 200 audits, special projects and inspections done by SIGAR since 2009 and built a 
database to add up the tot=l cost of failed reconstruction projects. Looking at the botched projects collectively — rather 
than as one-off headlines — reveals a=grim picture of the overall reconstruction effort and a repeated cycle of mistakes. 
• 
In just six years, the IG has tallied at least $17 billion in questionable spending. This includes $3.6 billion in 
outright wa=te, projects teetering on the brink of waste, or projects that can't =E2404) or won't — be sustained by the 
Afghans, as well as an additional $13.5 billion that th= average taxpayer might easily judge to be waste. Exhibit A for 
"=ou be the judge": $8.4 billion was spent on counter-narcotics programs that were so ineffective that Afghanist=n has 
produced record levels of heroin — more than it did before the =ar started. 
• 
Often the programs' ambitions were o=t of whack with the reality of life in Afghanistan. After the invasion, the 
U.S. rushe= forward with bold plans to create a democratic, fiscally secure, ethical go=ernment and society — out of 
whole cloth. It was the same country-building =ravado that had earlier tripped up the U.S. in Iraq when it dismissed the 
local culture=and ignored corruption. 
• 
"Pie in the sky" projects, as one USAID worker called them, were routinely =aunched without any thought to the 
financial and technological ability of the Afgha=s to maintain them. It turned out that the Afghans couldn't afford mo=t 
of them, so even the best programs could end up becoming waste.

• 
<=pan style="font-size:12ptline-height:107%;font-family:georgia,serif">No=e of the programs were required to 
prove they had even limited success. Officials tracked dollars spent, not impact. For instance, no one evaluated whether 
Afghan security forces actually learned =o read and write after going through a $200 million literacy program.<=r> 
• 
Those who signed off on the failed projects appeared to suffer no consequences. As head of SIGAR John Sopko 
puts it: Reconstruction efforts are "like a child sports game where everyone=gets a trophy." 
If this a=counting wasn't bad enough, consider this: SIGAR has only examined a small percentage of the $110 billion 
effort to rebuild and remodel Afghanistan. The waste totals are likely much higher. Still, =t's often hard to grasp what 
this kind of money means to the average American. Perhaps the most meaningful wa= to underscore what has been lost 
is to look at what the money could have paid =or at home. 
To set the scene, in 2010, as the U.S. was drastically increasing its investment in Afghanistan, a quarter of America's 
ho=eowners — more than 11 million — were underwater on their mortgages, and the =ountry hovered near a 10 
percent unemployment rate. Congress was routinely gutting federal programs. 
• 
The $14.7 million spent=on a storage facility the military never used? That could have paid for about 9,800 rape 
kits to be tested — enough to clear the backlog for the entire state of Tennes=ee. 
• 
The $456,000 police-training facility that was=so poorly constructed it literally melted in the rain? That could 
have funded =ore than 180,000 dinners for low-income kids, enough for an entire summer. 
• 
The $335 million spent on a power plant that the Afghans don't use? That could have paid for permanent 
housing for 3=,000 homeless Americans and $250,000 grants to 20 small-business owners to help =hem commercialize 
new technologies. 
Take the money wasted on those worthless planes, plus that spent on an unused consulate, and fixing the buildings 
constructed with hazardous materials. That could have restored the $714 million cut from the National Institute of 
Health's budget, which funds scientific resea=ch into new treatments for disease. Despite such trade-offs, there's been 
little collective outrage from either the =ublic or Congress about the massive waste in Afghanistan. 
The military, the S=ate Department and USAID provided detailed public responses to the findings in each of SIGAR's 
reports, sometimes disputing the conclusions and recommendations. The reports and their =esponses can be read here. 
This week a Defense Department spokesman told ProPublica that the Pentagon "disagrees with the ass=rtion that $17B 
in projects are 'questionable.'" Often those responsible for t=e failed projects treat SIGAR's findings like unnecessary 
niggling. Their rejoinder, in essence: "Hey, it's a war zone, what do you e=pect?" There's little time spent on pondering 
the bigger question: If it's a war zone, why were we pouring billions i=to reconstruction?

attention of the insurgency. "Very frequently on those PowerPoints you would see this pipeline t=at already had been

worked as director of the Iraq Reconstructio= Management Office from 2004 to 2005. "That led us to several lessons in 
Iraq that have general applicability, which ar=: Smaller projects at the local level, by and large, are to be

That didn't stop the U.S. years later from trying to =uild a nationwide electricity system in Afghanistan that crossed 
through Taliban strongholds at the height of fighting. Or sinking billions into roads that spanned the country and were 
routinely blown up by insurgents. Offici=ls also identified over-gifting as a problem in Iraq. Iraqis would give a "head 
nod" to whatever the U.S. offered, because they weren't=footing the bill, former U.S. Ambassador Ryan Crocker told 
Iraq's inspector general. =nce the projects were built, the Iraqis couldn't pay to operate or maintain=them. And yet in 
Afghanistan, the military, the State Department and USAID repeatedly defended unsustainable projects by sa=ing that 
the Afghans had agreed to them. 
Corruption also prominently und=rmined the security forces in Iraq and many efforts at governance. SIGAR, however, 
said the U.S. moved forward for years in Afghanistan with no strategy in place to deal with corruption, a failure 
investigators found baffling. "Somethin= that quite's pertinent to Afghanistan that we could have learned in Iraq is the 
problem of the local culture of corruption," said Charles Tiefer, who investigated recon=truction on the Commission for 
Wartime Contracting in Iraq and Afghanistan. Then =here was the military, the State Department and USAID's frequent
