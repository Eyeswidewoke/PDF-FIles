We like to watch live news and the news channels we have as apps, give us the possibility to watch fragments of old news. I thought that one must be a paying member for each channel (as I pay monthly for Netflix). But if there is an option, I'll be glad to try. We can fix for James to come as from September 8.

If so, we can set up a time to come and see you when you are here next. Please let me know! Thanks, Lesley EFTA_R1_00957434 EFTA02221106 |
