Grateful Deod in 1970. Left to right: Bill Kreutzmann, Ron "Pigpen" McKernon, Jerry Garcia, Bob Weir, Mickey Hart, Phil Lesh. 
The Grateful Dead was an American rock band formed in 1965 in Palo Alto, California. 
The band was known for its unique and eclectic style, which fused elements of rock, folk, 
bluegrass, blues, reggae, country, improvisational jazz, psychedelia, and space rock, and for live 
performances of long musical improvisation. 'Their music," writes Lenny Kaye, "touches on 
ground that most other groups don't even know exists." These various influences were distilled 
into a diverse and psychedelic whole that made the Grateful Dead "the pioneering Godfathers of 
the jam band world". They were ranked 57th in the issue The Greatest Artists of all Time by 
Rolling Stone magazine. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994 and 
their Barton Hall Concert at Cornell University (May 8, 1977) was added to the Library of 
Congress's National Recording Registry. The Grateful Dead have sold more than 35 million 
albums worldwide. 
The Grateful Dead was founded in the San Francisco Bay Area amid the rise of counterculture of 
the 196os. The founding members were Jerry Garcia (guitar, vocals), Bob Weir (guitar, vocals), 
Ron "Pigpen" McKernan (keyboards, harmonica, vocals), Phil Lesh (bass, vocals), and Bill 
Kreutzmann (drums). Members of the Grateful Dead had played together in various San 
Francisco bands, including Mother McCree's Uptown Jug Champions and the Warlocks. Lesh 
was the last member to join the Warlocks before they became the Grateful Dead; he replaced 
Dana Morgan Jr., who had played bass for a few gigs. With the exception of McKernan, who 
died in 1973, the core of the band stayed together for its entire 30-year history. Other longtime 
members of the band include Mickey Hart (drums 1967-1971, 1974-1995), Keith Godchaux 
(keyboards 1971-1979), Donna Godchaux (vocals 1972-1979), Brent Mydland (keyboards, 
vocals 1979—mo), and Vince Welnick (keyboards 199o-1995).

The fans of the Grateful Dead, some of whom followed the band from concert to concert for 
years, are known as "Deadheads" and are known for their dedication to the band's music. The 
band and its following (Deadheads) are closely associated with the hippie movement and were 
seen as a form of institution in the culture of America for many years. Former members of the 
Grateful Dead, along with other musicians, toured as the Dead in 2003, 2004, and 2009 after 
touring as the Other Ones in 1998, 2OOO, and 2OO2. There are many contemporary incarnations 
of the Dead, with the most prominent touring acts being Furthur, Phil Lesh & Friends, Bob Weir 
& Ratdog, and the Rhythm Devils with drummers Mickey Hart and Bill Kreutzmann. 
Formation (1965-1966) 
Phil Lesh and Jerry Garcia were brought together by Gert Chiarito in 1964 to perform on The 
Midnight Special, her Saturday night radio program on KPFA, Berkeley. 
The Grateful Dead began their career as the Warlocks, a group formed in early 1965 from the 
remnants of a Palo Alto, California jug band called Mother McCree's Uptown Jug Champions. 
The band's first show was at Magoo's Pizza located at 639 Santa Cruz Avenue in suburban Menlo 
Park, California on May 5, 1965. They were known as the Warlocks although at the same time 
the Velvet Underground was also using that name on the east coast. The show was not recorded 
and not even the set list has been preserved. The band quickly changed its name after finding 
out that another band of the same name had signed a recording contract (not the Velvet 
Underground, who by then had also changed their name). The first show under the new name 
Grateful Dead was in San Jose, California on December 4, 1965, at one of Ken Kesey's Acid 
Tests. Earlier demo tapes have survived, but the first of over 2,OOO concerts known to have 
been recorded by the band's fans was a show at the Fillmore Auditorium in San Francisco on 
January 8, 1966. Later that month, the Grateful Dead played at the Trips Festival, an early 
psychedelic rock show. 
The name "Grateful Dead" was chosen from a dictionary. According to Phil Lesh, in his 
autobiography (pp. 62), "... Perry Garcia] picked up an old Britannica World Language 
Dictionary...(and]...In that silvery elf-voice he said to me, 'Hey, man, how about the Grateful 
Dead?'" The definition there was "the soul of a dead person, or his angel, showing gratitude to 
someone who, as an act of charity, arranged their burial." According to Alan Trist, director of 
the Grateful Dead's music publisher company Ice Nine, Garcia found the name in the Funk & 
Wagnalls Folklore Dictionary, when his finger landed on that phrase while playing a game of 
Fictionary. In the Garcia biography, Captain Trips, author Sandy Troy states that the band was 
smoking the psychedelic DMT at the time. The term "grateful dead" appears in folktales of a 
variety of cultures. In mid-1969, Phil Lesh told another version of the story to Carol Maw, a 
young Texan visiting with the band in Marin County who also ended up going on the road with 
them to the Fillmore East and Woodstock. In this version, Phil said, "Jerry found the name 
spontaneously when he picked up a dictionary and the pages fell open. The words 'grateful' and 
'dead' appeared straight opposite each other across the crack between the pages in unrelated 
text." 
Other supporting personnel who signed on early included Rock Scully, who heard of the band 
from Kesey and signed on as manager after meeting them at the Big Beat Acid Test; Stewart 
Brand, "with his side show of taped music and slides of Indian life, a multimedia presentation" 
at the Big Beat and then, expanded, at the Trips Festival; and Owsley Stanley, the "Acid King" 
whose LSD supplied the tests and who, in early 1966, became the band's financial backer,

renting them a house on the fringes of Watts and buying them sound equipment. "We were 
living solely off of Owsley's good graces at that time.... [His] trip was he wanted to design 
equipment for us, and we were going to have to be in sort of a lab situation for him to do it," said 
Garcia. 
Main career (1967-1995) 
One of the group's earliest major performances in 1967 was the Mantra-Rock Dance — a musical 
event held on January 29, 1967, at the Avalon Ballroom by the San Francisco Hare Krishna 
temple. The Grateful Dead performed at the event along with the Hare Krishna founder 
Bhaktivedanta Swami, poet Allen Ginsberg, bands Moby Grape and Big Brother and the Holding 
Company with Janis Joplin, donating proceeds to the Krishna temple. The band's first LP, The 
Grateful Dead, was released on Warner Brothers in 1967. 
Classically trained trumpeter Phil Lesh played bass guitar. Bob Weir, the youngest original 
member of the group, played rhythm guitar. Ron "Pigpen" McKernan played keyboards and 
harmonica until shortly before his death in 1973 at the age of 27. Garcia, Weir, and McKernan 
shared the lead vocal duties more or less equally; Lesh only sang a few leads but his tenor was a 
key part of the band's three-part vocal harmonies. Bill Kreutzmann played drums, and in 
September 1967 was joined by a second drummer, New York native Mickey Hart, who also 
played a wide variety of other percussion instruments. 
1970 included tour dates in New Orleans, Louisiana, where the band performed at The 
Warehouse for two nights. On January 31, 1970, the local police raided their hotel on Bourbon 
Street, and arrested and charged a total of 19 people with possession of various drugs. The 
second night's concert was performed as scheduled after bail was posted. Eventually the charges 
were dismissed, with the exception of those against sound engineer Owsley Stanley, who was 
already facing charges in California for manufacturing LSD. This event was later memorialized 
in the lyrics of the song "Truckle', a single from American Beauty which reached number 64 on 
the charts. 
Mickey Hart quit the Grateful Dead in February 1971, leaving Kreutzmann once again as the sole 
percussionist. Hart rejoined the Grateful Dead for good in October 1974. Tom "TC" Constanten 
was added as a second keyboardist from 1968 to 1970, while Pigpen also played various 
percussion instruments and sang. 
After Constanten's departure, Pigpen reclaimed his position as sole organist Less than two 
years later, in late 1971, Pigpen was joined by another keyboardist, Keith Godchaux, who played 
grand piano alongside Pigpen's Hammond B-3 organ. In early 1972, Keith's wife, Donna Jean 
Godchaux, joined the Grateful Dead as a backing vocalist. 
Following the Grateful Dead's "Europe '72" tour, Pigpen's health had deteriorated to the point 
that he could no longer tour with the band. His final concert appearance was June 17, 1972 at 
the Hollywood Bowl, in Los Angelesa3o] he died in March, 1973 of complications from alcohol 
abuse. 
The death of Pigpen did not slow the band down, and they continued with their new members. 
They soon formed their own record group, Grateful Dead Records. Later that year, they 
released their next studio album, the jazz influenced Wake of the Flood. It became their biggest 
commercial success thus far. Meanwhile, capitalizing on Flood's success, the band soon went

back to the studio, and the next year, 1974, released another album, From the Mars Hotel. Not 
long after that album's release however, the Dead decided to take a hiatus from live touring. 
In September 1975 the Dead released their eighth studio album, Blues for Allah. Their hiatus 
was short-lived, though, as they resumed touring in June 1976. That same year, they re-signed 
with Arista Records. Their new contract soon produced Terrapin Station in 1977. Although
