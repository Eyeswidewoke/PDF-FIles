corruption and s=x trafficking, immediately assumed similar conduct taking place in the Epstei= case. All the research

Factual Background<A> 
Investigation by Palm Beach Police Department 
As has been reported over and over for the past 10 years. In March 2005, t=e Palm Beach Police Department 
opened a criminal investigation of Mr. Epstein when the father and stepmother of

about=a visit by their 14-year old daughter to Mr. Epstein's Palm Beach hom=. What has not be=n reported is that 
informed police that they believed inappropriate conduct =ay have occurred between Mr. Epstein 
and their daughter. The police interviewe= 
who had visited Mr. Epstein's home only once, but b=ought 
no charges after interviewing her, though monitored activity at Mr. Epstein =80 s home through sporadic surveillance 
and occasional trash pulls.

that she was instructed by 
= the woman who brought her to Mr. Epstein's home, that 
had to =ell Mr. 
Epstein she was 18 years old because, if she was not 18, he would not let h=r into his house. 
also in=ormed the 
Police that she did in fact tell Mr. Epstein that she was 18 years old. She also informed police that Mr= Epstein had no 
sexual contact with her. M=. Epstein took a lie detector test, the results of which confirmed that 
told hi= she was

18, that he believed 
when she told him her age, that he never threatened 
M
 
in any way and that no sexual 
contact occurred with 
In addition, IM, wh= had previous run-ins with the Police, maintained a "MySpace page 
at the=time of the investigation on which she stated that she was 18 years old, posted naked a=d provocative 
photographs, admitted to having sex . <=pan class="">that she was not a virgin, to using drugs, and to having beaten 
someone up, and to having shoplifted and claimed=to earn $250,000 or more.

=99s father and stepmother, both had criminal 
records.=C2 The father had served 21 months in federal rison for bank fraud, an= the stepmother had a state
