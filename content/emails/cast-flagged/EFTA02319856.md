| **Subject** | Tomorrow.. Hi Terje, I spoke to Jeffrey's pilot and he said he will meet you at the main =erminal of Punta Cana airport at 11am tomorrow. His name is Larry =isoski and his cell Apparently the airport is quite =mall, so he shouldn't be hard to find! Jeffrey's plane is a black =ulfstream with tail number N909JE. I always have my cell on me if there are any issues. We look forward to =eeing you all tomorrow!
