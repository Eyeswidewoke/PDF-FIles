| **From** | Simon Vaughan-Edwards < Dear G. Just a belated note of thanks for a wonderful lime in NY. It was great to escape the kids for week. If I could only ditch the wife as well for the next visit Once again your generosity was overwhelming. Great apartment. wonderful dinner, fantastic hair (- the wife's not mine!!!) and of course Joseph. If it wasn't for the kids I think Katie and I would emigrate. As a small token of my gratitude I hope you will accept James Diggines - one of my junior consultants. I have attached a bad brochure photo but he conies up a lot better in the flesh. lie is bright. funny and athletic !! Of course if you don't want him please pass him on to the beautiful Hannah - he has a degree in politics which should be a comfort as she was concerned about intellect !! He will be in town first week in April playing in a tournament at the tennis and rackets club on Park . Perhaps a telephone interview in the first case would be appropriate !!!! Once again many thanks. I look forward to cashing in my rain check with Bill !! <<alert_OA4311_1047653235_TIMMY_3#JamesDig.jpg.txt» PS. Katie - traditional as ever has written to you snail mail !!
