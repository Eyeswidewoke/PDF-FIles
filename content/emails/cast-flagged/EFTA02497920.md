1. dont you have any questions about money,=. ? ? finance.. ? I owe you som= knowledge .

the "shape" is the metaphor for an n-dimenti=nal object , it stands outside of time. as do grammars , but sentences do 
=ot, they require time. 
the shape is somewh=t like a fitness landscape? contrasted with communicati=n which also 
requires a time dimension and biololgy that need= and uses energy . I suggest the mammal Ug is a subcategory of=C2 
all UG.s . and that as biology prefers redundancy . the other =odules, ie vision are small distortions of it.

it is my failing not =ours. the old math requires numbers . too li=iting. ( we can put a metric overlay on later 
in the chain) i=agine a shape in real space. it is readily apparent if a line=either fits on the shape or not . how do you 
know. ? =AO you compare the line with the shape. your visual system all=ws the mental shape to either map onto or 
not onto the shape in a co=erent manner. the shape is not an input device ,it is an objec= . the organizing principle of 
the shape is language, the shape is =AO a collection of grammars. lines on the shape are either coherent =r not. 
coherent ones are legitimate sentences . 
yang is flexible in his use of the term probability.=. for example he in a number of papers refers to zipf as a 
probabiltiy dis=ribution. i have checked a number of his papers after your last rema=k, I think it is a mistake. he 
means that after empirical measurement . for ex word frequency, =AO. if ten times out of 100 the corpus has the 
word x. =hen he describes the probablility of finding the word as 10 percent=C2 . this is not correct. it is only the 
probablity of find=ng the word in the frequency list . but he is very accomplished at mathema=ical models.

Interesting image, but I don'= see what it tells us about language. 
The problem looks to me like this, ro=ghly. 
Take, say, the human visual system.=C2 There's a genetic component that determines that humans 
will=have a mammalian and not an insect visual system, and much else. Same wit= other subsystems of the organism —
"organs," =80 modules." Language in particular. The technical name fo= this component, whatever it turns out to be, is 
UG. UG therefore de=ermines that certain systems are possible I-languages for humans, others are not. =1 presume that 
is what the "biological organizing principle =9D for language is. It's plainly not an input system, though=it determines 
possible input systems for human languages. I don =80 t see how we improve understanding by looking at it from this 
perspective.</=pan> 
A minor technical problem, not serious, has to do with distinguishing digit=l infinity from continuity, like 
continuous lines on the surface of a hemi=phere. 
I think you'll find Yang inte=esting.

1.1 will wait on vale=ia. we can craft a fun few days 
2, try this on but only if you get a moment , i know you =re busy 
it appear to me that ""language" can be defined as the=C2 biological organizing principle that creates a 
shape spa=e. "coherent sentences " are defined as those that f=t on the shape. The projections on the sensory motors, 
allows commun=cation. . There are an infinite digital number of sentences.that do fit on the shape , but=orders of 
magnitude more, that do not fit.- to attempt a naive=representation, imagine a hemisphere, ( symmetric), =AO any 
continuous line drawn on its surface , is a sentence. =C2 there are infinite numbers of lines that can be drawn. however 
, try=ng to connect two points , directly without traversing the hemishpere =AO is also infinitely possible but most 
solutions need to leav= the surface. The principle that organizes the shape is NOT an input device. one can map inputs 
onto the shap= but it is not THE shape , ex, a hemisphere bowl in 3 =pace, analogy, one can put marbles in the bowl 
and they will map a p=th to the bottom. but the shape of the bowl . determines how f=st they move, and in which 
direction, . the shape of the bowl is the language= there is a shape for vision as well. = it exists without input, certain 
paths are more probable etc. 
3. I will contact Yang

Valeria's not here right now,=so will have to check with her about late September. Really 
intrigui=g possibilities, and a delightful offer. 
On Yang, I read his work quite differ=ntly. He does make use of word frequencies and 
probability distribut=ons, but as far as I am aware in pretty straightforward and innocuous ways. =AO And he's quite 
sophisticated about these matters. Smart and int=resting guy. You might want to contact him directly. 
I don't recall his using Zipf=E2 s "laws," but it wouldn't matter much. =AO Mandelbrot showed 
back in the '50s that they were a statistical artifact, near meaningless. =AO I was, incidentally, surprised to see how he 
dealt with this result in =is autobiography. I think he called it his "Keplerian moment=" or something like that.
