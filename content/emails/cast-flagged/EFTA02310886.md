| **Subject** | Hi Marc and Kim, I apologize for the delay in getting in touch, have been traveling out of the country. I was wondering if you could send me a photo and dimensions of the turquoise color rug with a wave pattern in it that Jeffrey was interested when last in the showroom. It was one of the new rugs you had recently gotten. Thank you! <?xml version=.0" encoding=TF-8"?> <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"> <plist version=.0"> <dict> <key>date-sent</key> <real>1339096085</real> <key>flags</key> <integer>8590195717</integer> <key>original-mailbox</key> <string>imap://sarahk525@mail.mac.com/INBOX</string> <key>remote-id</key> <string>3075S</string> <key>subject</key> <string>RE:</string> EFTA_R1_01195635 EFTA02310886 </dict> </plist> 2 EFTA_R1_01195636 EFTA02310887 |
