| **Subject** | Re: Christopher Hyland Fabric If we could do one piece 9 yards, and one piece 8 yards that would be great. Can you please let me know what method of shipping you will be using and send a tracking number when you have it? Thank you!

They do have 2 other peices that are unharmed, the only issue is that one peice is 16.7 yards and the other peice is 13.12 yards. Can you please advise if there is a way you would like your peices to be (i.e. 10 yards from one peice and 7 yards from the other) or if there is a better way you would like it to be broken down. Sorry for this inconvenience. Best, Brandon Quattrone ChristopherHlnd, Inc. <mailto <mailto: 2 EFTA_R1_01233505 EFTA02321991 |
