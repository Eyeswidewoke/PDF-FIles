I will forward the phone line to STC on June 25th (thank you!) If Jeffrey comes back to NY (which I think he will come Wed. June 28) Bebe will forward the phone to the house. Bebe will also sit in for me in my absence (thank you!) I will be on a cruise with my husbands entire family June 25-30. I will most likely be unreachable! I have set up a `cruise plan' and international coverage with AT&T but I really don't know how well it will work. If you truly need me, try and text (917.749.2025) I am flying to Boston on June 30th for M's LAX tournament...renting car and driving home July 2. I'm sure all will be just fine!! Thanks so much, MS :) EFTA_R1_00947232 EFTA02217297 |
