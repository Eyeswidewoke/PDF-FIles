| **Subject** | Re: 108. Thanks.. Has Andrew Lasso, the super intendant for the building gotten in touch with you regarding working on the floors in 10F? We had some issues in the flooring there where there was a leak and it caused the floor to swell with huge mounds, so they had to remove alot of the flooring to flatten it down again. It's a bit of a mess. That's the apt we want worked on next after 10B and I asked Andrew to schedule this with you and just wanted to see if he has?
