My friend, Annika, who has been battling breast cancer and who takes care of my boat in 
Sweden, is planning a trip to New York to celebrate the end of her chemo. Can she possibly 
stay in one of the apartments? I trust her 150%. She was planning to come around May 6• and 
stay for a few days, maximum a week, but probably less. I am going to tell her not to buy the 
ticket until I hear back from you guys. 0
