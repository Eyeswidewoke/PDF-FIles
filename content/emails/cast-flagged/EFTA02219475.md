| **CC** | Merwin Dela Kah Richard Okay, I compiled a list of the most common stations and their corresponding AppleTV apps' requirements. Sounds like fun, I know. The list is below, but the short version is that MOST apps require signing in with a cable provider account that has that channel purchased. We just discontinued all the cable tv accounts for the apartments, so that doesn't help & TimeWarner's logins tend to reset themselves repeatedly anyway (I couldn't just "set it and forget it the guest would need the account EFTA_R1_00953742 EFTA02219475 credentials). If you're wondering if we could sign them all in under the 71st St cable account... No, there's a hard limit of 5 devices per account. There are a handful of mostly free Apps that we could pre-install on each AppleTV: ABC Bloomberg (free financial news) The Cartoon Network CBS News CBS Sports CNN (free live stream) CW (teen melodrama) PBS Weather channel These apps require individual subscriptions, but most people will recognize that they need to sign in with their account: Hulu Netflix Pandora Amazon Video when it releases I could write up something that says "hey enjoy any of the mostly free channels (list the above in a nice table format) or sign into your account on any of the subscription channels. If you'd like to install other apps, you'll need to sign in with your Apple ID / iTunes account and sign into the app as required. Please remember to sign out of your accounts when you depart." Make it pretty, and put it in some nice display plexiglass to sit next to the TVs in the non-residential guest apartments. These plexiglass-frames are not too cheesy: https://www.amazon.com/Fixture-Displays-Acrylic-Magnets-T-style/dp/B0llUSZCT2/ $16 https://www.amazon.com/Fixture-Displays-Acrylic-Plexiglass-100840- FBA/dp/B01M7O9GCT/ $26 Gory details below: Channel Apple TV App App Requirements ABC https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/abc-watch-live-tv- Some free content: stream-full-eoisocles/id3641918197mt=8 requires cable EFTA_R1_00953743 EFTA02219476 subscription for full content BBC America https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bbc- Cable Subscription americatid1089249069?mt=8 Bloomberg https.Mtunes.apole com/us/app/bloomberand281941097 Free ?mt=8 Bravo httos:Mtunes.aoole.com/us/aop/bravo- Cable Subscription nowhd383925190?mt=8 The Cartoon Network https.Mtunes.apole.com/us/aoo/carloon-network- Some free content; requires cable subscription for full content a op/ id404593641?mt=8 CBS https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cbs-full-episodes-and- Some free content; requires CBS All Access subscription for full access live-tvhd530168168?mt=8 CBS News https://itunes.aoole.com/us/anv/cbs-news-watch-free- Free(?) live-breaking-news/id334256223?mt=8 CBS Sports https:Mtunes.apple.corrt/us/apD/cbs-sports-app-scores- Some free content; requires cable subscription for full content news-stats-watch-live/id307184892?mt=8 CNBC Can't find link for it, but I know it exists!

On Jul 12, 2017, at 8:30 PM, jamcs cc wrote: Yeah, this is a tough situation. Channels on AppleTV are apps. Anyone can install apps on the AppleTV by logging in with their Apple IDs (and remember to sign out after), but how each channel handles content licensing is up to them -- some have subscription services that you can buy, others require you sign in with a partnered cable account, etc. For example: • for HBO Go (or CNN Go) you have to sign in with a cable account that has the HBO channel on the account. EFTA_R1_00953746 EFTA02219479 • for HBO Now, you have to subscribe for $X per month, billed to your Apple ID. • for Disney's channels, you have to sign in with an authorized cable account, BUT TimeWamer is not one of the options. So it's a bit of a mess. For Nilli & Ehud I signed into one of the news channels as the account connected to 9 E 71st, but each cable account can only be on 5 devices at once (and Jeffrey has A LOT of devices he uses personally). I'm not sure what the solution is here. I'll think on it, but I may need some guidance from Rich & JEE on how they want this to work. Thank you, On Jul 12, 2017, at 3:21 PM Could we get a "cheat sheet" for how to use the Apple TV in the apartments. Guests are questioning! I just had Dr Bard ask if he can get ESPN. (?). I googled and I don't think so. Another guest just wanted to watch news ... ?
