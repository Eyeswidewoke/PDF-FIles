Should we have=len the focus or make it so both of you can participate evenly? I think tha= if we make Jen the focus, we can have a fairly high level class with you a= support.

Neither of us has le=rned about Japanese cooking, so we would probably need to start with the ba=ics, although Jen is a chef, but she has experience only with european/amer=can cuisine. But we do love Japanese food a lot! at least the American vers=on of it. >>»» Other then food, we probably will do lot's of sightseeing, since this=is going to be our first time in Japan. I would love to get to know more ab=ut traditional Japanese architecture and design. We would also like to see=sumo and kabuki performance, as well as kodo and tea ceremony. So if you ma= have suggestions on any of the above, it would be amazing. Otherwise, we a=e open to any other recommendations you might have and very much looking fo=ward to this trip! >>»» Thank you both very much! >>»» Karyna. >>>>» >>>»» On Sep 5, 2016, at 5:53 AM, Joi Ito < > wrote: >>>>>» >>>»» Hi Karyna, >>>>>» >>>>>» We can try to Skype today or you can tell us what you're loo=ing for and we can help.
