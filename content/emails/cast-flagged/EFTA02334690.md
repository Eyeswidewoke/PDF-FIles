I'd write more and be funny and witty and really show you my stuff but we have to go to this bbq at the nipps down the road (i made pasta salad!) ... julie, the wife, drinks wine coolers and wants to sleep with my husband and steve has had food poisoning for a month and it's all they talk about ... but they pick the kids up from school so i have to suck up ...
