| **Subject** | Re: Vanity sink The top for the bathroom vanity should be Caesarstone Pure White 1141. I =ill choose the sink on Thursday unless you can send a photo of the =arger sink and tell me how much room would be left on the sides of the =anity top if I were to use this one? Just checking on the glass shower door. I marked what height the handle =hould be with blue tape. I also want to make sure the handle is =orizontal and as long as possible that will fit on the door.. I'm =uessing it can be 18"-24"? It should be just the standard chrome shower =oor handle. I'm not sure about the saddle. I will need to have a look =hen I'm there on Thursday. Thanks!

Do =ou want the same stone like the kitchen? Since we are doing same stone =or your shower shelves like the kitchen, we can use the same stone for =he top. Then also the saddle we can use the same. Please advise. > Penn Original Message > From: > To: Penn baluyut > Subject: Re: Vanity sink > Sent: Jan 7, 2013 5:07 PM M ill be taking the sink over to 111. I'm not sure yet which =athroom sink I will be using, I need to see them in person first. The =ights I also need to see first. I ordered them just so I can see if I =ike them, and which one I like; not sure that I will even use them, but =anted to see them in the space as an option.
