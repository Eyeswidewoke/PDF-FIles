There has been quite a bit of news in the UK about FBUDOJ interest in Prince Andrew. Right now I have open afternoons today and tomorrow, but have events both nights. So if there is a time that works between 1:30 and 5 pm GMT (8:30-noon EDT), let me know. I have some time late in my day on Thursday. Friday is pretty much flat out. Thanks, US Department ofjustice Attaché Unite
