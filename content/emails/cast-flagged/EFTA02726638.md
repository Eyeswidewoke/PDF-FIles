Thereupon, the following proceedings were had: 
MR. RASCO: Ready to go? 
THE WITNESS: I'm ready. 
You represent who again? 
MR. RASCO: I represent Frank Preve. 
MR. CUSICK: Counsel, before you begin, 
I'm just going to put an objection on the 
record. 
On behalf of Emess Capital, as to not 
being permitted time in this deposition to 
depose Mr. Rothstein, I object to the counsel 
for the trustee's violation of the protocol 
orders, an order permitting Emess to depose 
Mr. Rothstein at this deposition by trying to 
shut us out of the deposition. 
THE COURT REPORTER: I'm having trouble 
hearing you, sir. Maybe you move closer. 
MR. CUSICK: We object to counsel for the 
trustee's violation of the various protocol 
orders in trying to shut us out of the 
deposition by refusing us time to depose Mr. 
Rothstein, by failing to timely send over his 
exhibits, in accordance with the protocol 
orders. 
On the same basis, we move to strike the

testimony taken by the Trustee and also the 
testimony taken by TD Bank, based upon the 
inability to cross-examine Mr. Rothstein as to 
that testimony, also the failure to abide by 
the court order by sending over exhibits 
timely. 
We reserve the right to depose 
Mr. Rothstein at a future date, and we reserve 
all rights against the Trustee and TD Bank. 
We further object on behalf of all other 
entities which are represented by the Law Firm 
of Kluger Kaplan to the extent that the 
Trustee served notices of taking deposition 
that were filed in those cases prior to those 
entities being served with the complaint; and 
we move to strike those notices of taking 
deposition. 
Thank you very much. Sorry to eat into 
your time. 
MR. LICHTMAN: Let the record reflect in 
the underlying Rothstein, Rosenfeldt & Adler 
case pending before Judge Cohn, as well as in 
the protocol orders, neither of them afforded 
Emess Capital any entitlement whatsoever to 
take or participate in the questioning of
