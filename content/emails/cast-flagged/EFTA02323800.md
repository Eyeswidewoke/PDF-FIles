I was going over the plan for my window unit with Mr Epstein, and h= suggests I should also have 2 grates in front of the AC unit and shelves, b=t have them able to slide on a track so I have the choice of having those s=ctions exposed, or covering them if I don't want to see the AC in the winte=, etc. Is this doable? I'm not sure the best way to think about the design.=l will give you a call tomorrow to discuss. Thanks! Sarah 1 EFTA_R1_01239078 EFTA02323800 |
