We were previously interested in meeting with the second victim represented by her attorney after the Maxwell trial. Based on our last conversation, I believe you had met with her already. If you are still pursuing an investigation encompassing both victims, we are not likely to open an other investigation. If anything changes or my understanding is incorrect, please let me know. Thank you, On Jan 21,
