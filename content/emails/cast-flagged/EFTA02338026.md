| **Subject** | Artefacto Dear Jeffrey, Sorry to bother you with this but we have a issue with Artefacto that I =eel you need to be abreast of. Yesterday the delivery company was able to deliver two sofas, one to 10F =nd 2G in the elevator as I suspected was possible originally but the =eliver company insisted they wouldn't fit. They also delivered a mirror to 3M which is the wrong color which they =ill have to be picked up at another time because the packing that it =ame in was destroyed. They need to come back with new packing material =ecause it's a mirror. The only remaining piece in this delivery was a Jenson sofa for 3M. The =riginal idea, which we spoke about back in November was for this to be =elivered to 3M and the sofa there was to go to 11J. Svetlana does not =ant to give up her existing sofa so I tried to have that delivered to =LI as an alternative but there is a beam obstruction in the stairwell =etween the 5th and 6th floor that does not allow this to happen and it =oes not fit into the elevator. I wanted them to attempt to deliver this =o yesterday but Svetlana insisted that we wait until she spoke to you. = Arttefacto would normally charge a 25% restocking fee but I just spoke =o Eduardo just now to clarify and he said he would talk to the manager, =osana to wave the fee but we would most likely have to pay the shipping =harge. He will let me know on Monday. Should we return the sofa or try to deliver it to 3M when they pick up =he mirror? Please advise.
