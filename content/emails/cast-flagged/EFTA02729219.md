You want to say 'What's going on here?' and he gives you that Cheshire smile." Epstein likes to say he's private, but you don't fly Bill Clinton to Africa without wanting attention. One friend says the Africa trip was Epstein's Icarus moment There was tremendous risk that the natural forces of resentment would bring the too-smart, too-rich spirit back to earth. This is the friends' theory of the Palm Beach case: an overzealous poli

Jeffrey Epstein is under indictment for sex crimes in Palm Beach, Florida, and I'd expected that when he 
came into the office of PR guru Howard Rubenstein, he would be sober and reserved. Quite the 
opposite. He was sparkling and ingenuous, apologizing for the half-hour lateness with a charming line--
"I never realized bow many one-way streets and no-right-turns there am in midtown. I finally got out 
and walked"—end as we went down the corridor to Rubenstein's office, he asked, "Have you managed 
to talk to many of my friends?" Epstein bad been supplying me the phone numbers of important 
scientists and financiers and media figures. "Do you understand what an extraordinary group of people

they are, what they have accomplished in their fields?" 
One of the accusers—a girl of I4—had put his age at 45, not in his fifties, and you could see why. His 
walk was youthful, and his face was ruddy with health. He had none of the round-shouldered, burdened 
qualities of middle age. There was nothing in his hands, not a paper, a book, or a phone. Epstein had on 
his signature outfit: new blue jeans and a powder-blue sweater. "I've only ever seen him in jeans," his 
friend the publicist Pew Siegal had reported, saying there was a hint of arrogance in that, Epstein's 
signal that he doesn't have to wear a uniform like the rest of us. 
I told Epstein and Rubenstein the sort of story New York wanted to do, and Epstein seemed to find ironic 
delight in every word. "A secretive genius." I'd said. "Not secretive, private," he corrected in his warm 
Brooklyn accent. "And if I was a genius I wouldn't be sitting here." "A guy with sex issues." A smile 
funned on Epstein's bow-shaped lips. "What do you mean by sex issues?" Well ... He was 54, had 
never married—I didn't finish. "Are you channeling my mother?" 
When I said we were interested in the agony of his ordeal, Rubenstein wrote out the word agony in 
capital letters on his pad. But agony seemed the last thing on Epstein's soul. "It's the leans story, 
someone who flies too close to the sun," I said. "Did Icarus like massages? Epstein asked. 
Two years before, he had tried to explain himself to the Palm Beach police in the same way. After they 
came into his mansion with a search warrant and carted off massage tables and photos of naked girls and 
soaps shaped like genitalia, Epstein conveyed an urgent message to the detectives through his attorney. 
"Mr. Epstein is very passionate about massages ... The massages are therapeutic and spiritually sound 
for him; that is why he has had many massages." Epstein had even given 5100,000 to Ballet Florida's 
massage fund, so that the dancers might also be treated. 
I never got to interview Epstein at length. His dream team of lawyers led by Gerald Lefeourt was 
negotiating a plea with Florida state prosecutors in advance of a January 7 trial date. It is expected that 
Epstein will plead guilty to soliciting prostitution and get an eighteen-month sentence—not that there's 
likely to be a shameful admission. He has always had the confidence that comes with the power to 
dazzle and, though accused of "doing everything in Sodom and Gomorrah," as one friend put it; seemed 
to believe that he could convince any halfway sophisticated person that he wasn't the least hit tawdry.
"He lives in a different environment,- says Siegal. "He's of this world. But he mates this different 
environment. Ile lives like a pasha. the most magnificent townhouse I've ever been in, and I've been in 
everything. I've seen a model of the house in Santa Fe .. a stone fortress. A model of the house in the 
Caribbean—it is not to be believed. I've seen photographs of the apartment in Paris ... HO.NV did he 
himself into that pickle? Thais the mystery- of Jeffrey Epstein. Ile's very mysterious. Not that many 
people get close to bin Not that many people know him." 
The descriptions of Epstein's character veer between visionary and big talker. His world seems to be at 
• -mid distance from nonnai humanity. Ile lives in what is described as the largest private resident in 
about 50.000 square feet in nine stories between Fifth and Madison on 71st Visitors report a

of the charmingly inevitable accidents of Epstein's rise. Greenberg was a senior partner of the house; 
Bear Steams CEO Jimmy Cayne later told New York that Epstein's forte was dealing with wealthier 
clients, helping them with their overall portfolios. Leslie Wexner, founder of Limited Brands, reportedly 
made Epstein his financial adviser and was instrumental in building his fortune. Epstein was no 
footman; he loved luxury and. in his own words, saw himself as a financial architect, someone who 
could show the rich how to live with their money. "I want people to understand the power, the 
responsibility, and the burden of their money," he once wrote. At limes, his powers seemed magical. "I 
think it's all done with mirrors," says Michael Stroll, a Chicago businessman who sued Epstein (and 
lost) when an oil deal didn't work out. 
Next: Epstein's Icarus moment.

Stroll says he could never get a straight line from Epstein. "Everybody who's his friend thinks he's so 
dam brilliant because he's so darn wealthy. I never saw any brilliance, I never saw him work. Anybody I 
know that is that wealthy works 26 hours a day. This guy plays 26 hours a day." 
Those who believe in Epstein say that his intelligence works in a lofty and synthetic manner. "His mind 
goes through a cross section of descriptions," says Joe Pagano, a financier. "He can go from 
mathematics to psychology to biology. He takes the smallest amount of information and gets the correct 
answer in the shortest period of time. That's my definition of lQ." 
A Columbia University geneticist says Epstein has that insight in science, too. "He has the ability to 
make connections that other minds can't make," says Richard Axel, a Nobel Prize winner. "He is 
extremely smart and probing. Ile can very quickly acquire information to think about a problem and also 
to identify biological problems without having all the data that a scientist would have ... He also has an 
extremely short attention span. Why?—it's not that he's bored. He has enough information after fifteen

minutes so that you can see his mind thrashing about, as if in a labyrinth. And even to doubt an expert's 
statements." 
Epstein has been a munificent supporter of cutting-edge research. Axel met Epstein during the early 
biotech days of the eighties. Vanity Fair columnist Michael Wolff met him in the Internet bubble, in the 
late nineties, when Epstein invited him and a group of scientists and media types to fly to a conference 
on the West Coast in his beautiful 727. 
"it was all a little giddy," Wolff says. "There's a little food out, lovely hors d'oeuvre. And then after 
fifteen to twenty minutes, Jeffrey arrives. This guy comes onboard: He was my age, late forties, and he 
had a kind of Ralph Lauren look to him, a good-looking Jewish guy in casual attire. Jeans, no socks, 
loafers, a button-down shirt, shimails out. And he was followed onto the plane by—how shall i say 
this?--by three teenage girls not his daughters. Not adolescent girls. These are young, 18, 19, 20, who 
knows? They were model-like. They towered over Jeffrey. And they immediately began serving things. 
You didn't know what to make of this ... Who is this man with this very large airplane and these very 
tall girls?" 
Soon after, Wolff was invited to tea at the house on East 7Ist Street. He understood that there was a 
purpose to the cultivation. Epstein was shifting his view to media, in his Ober-way. "What does the 
media mean, where does he fit into it?" Then Epstein began to show up in the press. in 2002, he flew 
Bill Clinton and Kevin Spacey to Africa on his plane to discuss aids policy, and suddenly he was being 
written about. In 2003. he became a discreet confidant to Wolff during the period when Wolff was 
involved in a bid for New York Magazine. Sometime after that, Wolff saw the financial architect in his 
office at 457 Madison Avenue, the Villard House, where Random House once had its offices. "His 
literal office is where Ben
