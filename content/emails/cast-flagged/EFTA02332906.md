| **Subject** | Ranch Just an FYI, here's a shot of the ranch I looked at yesterday. It's about 10 miles inland from the ocean, and about 30 miles north of where I live now. One of the few large ranches left reasonably close to civilization in So. Cal. Weather virtually perfect all year round. It's about 2000 acres, and you can see the landing strip on the right which could actually be turned into a real strip to accommodate anything. Currently a serious horse operation, about 300 total horses, and 130 mares with foals. If you zoom in the bldgs in the center are the horse operation which anything could be done with. Good topography as it has a combination of flat usable land, mountains, lakes, a river, mature trees, good ground water, etc. Prettier than in looks in the picture, and with a little money could be really good. Not bad anyway. Flew around and saw some really interesting pieces that we are trying to track down. Supposedly the best ranch in Ca is in Malibu and I might look at that while we are there much more manicured, but not as large as this one. None of these things are on the market, but they are all for sale in a way. WE could pick up some tents and camp out there if you wish. Plenty of mountain lions and rattlesnakes.
