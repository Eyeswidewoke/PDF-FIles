PALM BEACH POST'S MOTION TO INTERVENE : 274
AND PETITION FOR ACCESS 
11 14 
rn
r 
Palm Beach Newspapers, Inc., d/b/a The Palm Beach Post (the "Post") moves to 
intervene in this action for the limited purpose of seeking access to documents filed under seal. 
The documents relate directly to the Defendant's guilty plea and sentence. Thus, the sealed 
documents go to the heart of the disposition of this case. But in requesting that Judge Pucillo 
seal these documents, the parties failed to comply with Florida's strict procedural and substantive 
requirements for sealing judicial records. In addition, continued sealing of these documents is 
pointless, because these documents have been discussed repeatedly in open court records. For all 
of these reasons, the documents must be unsealed. As grounds for this Motion, the Post states: 
1. 
The Post is a daily newspaper that has covered this matter and related 
7,32,)
proceedings. In an effort to inform its readers concerning these matters, the Post relieiWon;.: 
(among other things) law enforcement records and judicial records.

2. 
As a member of the news media, the Post has a right to intervene in cnnunalze 
proceedings for the limited purpose of seeking acrecs to proceedings and records. Warm v. 
Florida Freedom Nerawers. Inc. 531 So. 2d 113, 118 (Fla. 1988) (news media have standing 
to challenge any closure order); Miami Herald Publ'R Co. v I swic 426 So. 2d 1, 7 (Fla. 1982) 
(news media must be given an opportunity to be heard on question of closure).

3. 
The particular documents under seal in this case arc a non-prosecution agreement 
that was docketed on July 2, 2008, and an addendum docketed on August 25, 2008. Together, 
these documents apparently restrict any federal prosecution of the Defendant for offenses related 
to the conduct to which he pleaded guilty in this case. Judge Pucillo accepted the agreement for 
filing during a bench conference on June 30, 2008. The agreement, Judge Pucillo found, was "a 
significant inducement in accepting this plea." Such agreements and related documents typically 
arc public record. See Oregonian Publishing Co. v. United States District Court, 920 F.2d 1462, 
1465 (9th Cir. 1990) ("plea agreements have typically been open to the public"). United States v 
KOOiStrit 796 F.3d 1390, 1390-91 (I 1th Cir. 1986) (documents relating to defendant's change of 
plea and sentencing could be scaled only upon finding of a compelling interest that justified 
denial of public access). 
4. 
The Florida Constitution provides that judicial branch records generally must be 
open for public inspection. See Art. I, § 24(a), Fla. Const. Closure of such records is allowed 
only under narrow circumstances, such as to "prevent a serious and imminent threat to the fair, 
impartial and orderly administration of justice," or to protect a compelling governmental interest. 
See Fla. R. Jud. Admin. 2.420(c)(9XA). Additionally, closure must be effective and no broader 
than necessary to accomplish the desired purpose, and is lawful only if no less restrictive 
measures will accomplish that purpose. See Fla. R. Jud. Admin. 2. 420(c)(9XB) & (C); Lewis
426 So. 2d at 3. 
5. 
In this case, the non-prosecution agreement and, later, the addendum were sealed 
without any of the requisite findings. Rather, it appears from the record, the documents were 
sealed merely because the Defendant's counsel represented to Judge Pucillo that the non-
prosecution agreement "is a confidential document." See Plea Conference Transcript page 38

(June 30, 2008). Such a representation falls well short of demonstrating a compelling interest, a 
genuine necessity, narrow tailoring, and that no less restrictive measures will suffice. 
Consequently, the sealing was improper and ought to be set aside. 
6. 
In addition, at this time good cause exists for unsealing the documents because of 
their public significance. Since the Defendant pleaded guilty to soliciting a minor for 
prostitution, he has been named in at least 12 civil lawsuits that — like the charges in this case — 
allege he brought and paid teenage girls to come his home for sex and/or "massages."' At least 
I1 cases are pending. In another lawsuit, one of the Defendant's accusers has alleged that 
federal prosecutors failed to consult with her regarding the disposition of possible charges 
against the Defendant.2 State prosecutors also have been criticized: The Palm Beach Police 
Chief has faulted the State Attorney's handing of these cases as "highly unusual" and called for 
the State Attorney's disqualification. Consequently, this case — and particularly the Defendant's 
agreements with prosecutors — arc of considerable public interest and concern. 
7. 
The Defendant's non-prosecution agreement with federal prosecutors also was 
important to Judge Pucillo. As she noted in the June 2008 plea conference, "1 would view [the 
non-prosecution agreement] as a significant inducement in accepting this plea."
