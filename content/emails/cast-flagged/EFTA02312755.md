The lawyers dont know where to begin as well,=as the date in the contract refers to August of 2017. S= this contract was drafted years ago and it appears no one was willing to s=gn, is that correct?

I am sure you are aware that this "real estate contract..90 is highly irregular for Americans. 1. It is not a rea= estate contract, it is a purchase of an offshore entity, creating ma=y complexities for americans. 3. The due diligence on a lichtenstein co. will take months. &nb=p; 4. We would have to be indemnified for a=l taxes due to morroccan government on transfer and unknown liabiltil=s of the co., especially as you might imagine, this purchase would be=very high profile. S. Is there=a title on file? who would guarantee title transfer? If Christies is willin= that might work. 6. We were hoping=for a quick closing. With this structure it is not possible, and money woul= need to be withheld for years to back up the indemnity. It is very d=sappointing. We are told that liabilties would extend approx 7 years, so a p=yment of 10m day one and 2 milliion per year for 8 years might work. There c=early is no perfect title transfer under your proposed structure. Fou= jurisdictions, real estate and corporate and disclosure rules in each. Can=you make a suggestion? Thank you.
