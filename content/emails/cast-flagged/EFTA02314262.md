| **To** | <jeevacation@gmail.com> Dear Jeffrey, Marc Leon just called me to say that he is 99.9% certain that you are the b=yer behind Karyna, which I neither confirmed or denied. He went on to say that the seller is now so keen to finalise, that he actua=ly doesn't mind anymore whom the buyer is. To that end, Marc suggested if you are so inclined, that you give him a cal= and hopefully after this he can get closure on the whole matter. Incidentally, if you prefer to remain anonymous, then I came up with an ide= that the bank's (Deutche and LGT) disclose the names of the ultim=te beneficiaries of the two trusts to each other, without passing on the i=formation to their respective clients. However, given Marc has put 2 + 2 and made 4, it might just be simpler to c=ll him As ever, Mark Sent from my iPad =C2 please note The information contained in t=is communication is confidential, may be attorney-client privileged, ma= constitute inside information, and is intended only for the use of =he addressee.
