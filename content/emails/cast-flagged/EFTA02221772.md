I forgot to tell her to take the towels for the laundry. But as she will change the linen, I hope she will take also the towels. If you happen to talk to her, please - just remind her. Waiting to know concerning a possible meeting. Thanks, Nili Nil! Priell Barak Nili Priell Barak wrote: EFTA_R1_00958778 EFTA02221772 |
