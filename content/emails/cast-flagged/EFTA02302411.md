Thank a Allison! I am sorry, turns out I was misinformed about the second mirror, so we only have one to give to 
you guys.

Hi Allison, 
Just wanted to check if Steven is still going to pick up the mirror tomorrow? 
Also, it turned out we have another extra mirror like the one Steven is going to pick up. 
And we also have quite a lot of extra tableware (dishes, glasses, etc.) Would it be possible for you to find out if Eva 
would like to take that as well? 
Thanks a lot,

Hi Karyna, 
Can we have Steven pick it up next week? Is there a specific date that works 
best for him to pick it up? Late morning might work best or early afternoon.
