If you want to send some things ahead to the ranch if that's easier too, you can do that. On Jul 10, 2012, at 2:55 PM, francis derby wrote: I'm not sure what that means for me? Does that mean I go from ISJ to PB to NM along with him? Please let me know when you get more info. I will need to pack accordingly... This will be my first time to Ranch and i will need to bring a few things there. Francis On Tue, Jul 10, 2012 at 2:47 PM, K< <mailto -> wrote: Just a heads up to you.. I know JE's schedule isn't set in stone, and I'm not sure if he is certain if he will be going to Palm Beach yet or not, but if he does there is a chance he may go straight to the ranch from PB..
