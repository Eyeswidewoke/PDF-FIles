But I will update you. Can you please organize a "cleaning session" immediately after our departure, but as close to it as possible, so it will wait clean while we are away (I have already "fought" alone a cockroach in the kitchen and washed away a tick in the bathroom). Maybe there is a need for a disinfection while we are away? thanks a lot, Nili EFTA_R1_00951195 EFTA02218689 |
