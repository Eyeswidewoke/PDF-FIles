Since leaving the dental school, I have been at the =ailman School of Public Health, which has been a terrific experience.</=> As you recall, you were kind enough to provide me wi=h an unrestricted gift when I began my work at the School of Public Health= This support was invaluable, and contributed to advancing discussion about the future of the dental profession, and the im=ortance of oral findings in persons with diabetes mellitus. This resulted =n the publication of 1 book, 2 monographs, 2 other book chapters and=numerous papers in refereed journals. After 28 years, however, I have decided to leave Col=mbia and explore some other opportunities. I will be taking a part- time fa=ulty appointment at the Stony Brook University School of Dental Medicine, with a focus on developing their global oral health pr=gram. Here is my request: some of the money you provided w=ll remain in my gift account at the end of June, when I will be leaving Co=umbia. I would like to move those funds to Stony Brook to support my work there, but need the permission of the donor, mean=ng you. If those funds are not moved, they will revert to Columbia.=u> Please let me know if you agree to this request</=> Thanks, and look forward to hearing from you.=u> Ira Ira B.
