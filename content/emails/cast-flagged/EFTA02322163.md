I wanted to see if you could help me organize this? I hope all is well and look forward to hearing from you! EFTA_R1_01233747 EFTA02322163 2 EFTA_R1_01233748 EFTA02322164 |

If I can't, I will call and arrange to meet him there tomorrow. Can you give me his cell number? I will also send a set of floor plans. Assuming they would arrive Wednesday, where should I send them. Thanks. Paul Ori inal Messa e |
