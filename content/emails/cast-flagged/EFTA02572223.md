For me the main value is that the=system is an order of magnitude cheaper than existing technologies, 
premis=d on leveraging data to help users see what daily elements are affecting t=eir blood sugar, and predicting 
dangerous highs and lows before they happe= so they can take actions beforehand. To date, their beta app has lowered 
blood suga= averages in over 55% of users 2x better than the world's most prescri=ed diabetes drug, Metformin. Which 
means that with the help of the date di=betes would need to use less drugs. However I'd agree on complexity of 
regulatio=s and saturation on the market. 
I ru= Day One Ventures fund and based in San Francisco. I'd be happy to con=ect in person sometime to 
learn about about your experience and tell about=our investments and opportunities I see.

* In general the challenge with glucose measurement is the tinge= prick. Any device that relies 
on this will only be marginally better than=any other device, whether or not there is software or a slightly more 
conv=nient measuring device. This is a statement about the inconvenience of a p=ick (and long term challenges) but also 
the medical challenges on relying =n that point in time. 
* My sense is that going down the path of =n innovation, that still has a prick, but requires a 
level of FDA approval=is a difficult one to approach. 
* This is a very crowded space. =here are a lot of apps, a lot of measuring devices, a lot of 
mixtures of a=p and measuring devices. It is very difficult to avoid appearing as a comm=dity to consumers. 
* While I understand there is potential to se= innovation using novel approaches to analysis of 
data, it is not clear to=me how much better the approach can be for an individual with data.

<=iv>' The real opportunity I might see is around measuring glucose or some =elated telemetry 
to assist in compliance that is outside the scope of a fi=ger prick and measuring glucose directly. It seems like we should 
have som= other data point upon which to apply machine learning. 
I hope this helps...any friend of JE is a friend of mine

Center Health is building a= AI-based glucose monitoring system for the 1 in 11 
Americans who suf=er from diabetes, based on machine learning and their personalized Al,Q=A0Aria. Users subscribe 
to their disposable test strips, a $14B/yr US mark=t, which are delivered monthly, as Aria learns about their diabetes and 
pr=mpts behavioral changes to lower blood sugar. The system is an o=der of magnitude cheaper than existing 
technologies, premised on leveragin= data to help users see what daily elements are affecting their blood=sugar, and 
predicting dangerous highs and lows before they happen. </=ont>

Pros 
— Existing glucometers f=om big companies are very old-fashioned and 
outdated, those companies make=their revenue from overpriced strips 
— Direct compet=tors, such as iHealth and Dario have negative customer 
reviews=and minor 
— Uses FDA-approved circuits to get the approval i= an automated manner 
<=> 
Cons<f=pan> 
— Enormous pressure both from the industry players and compan=es such as 
Apple and Google that try to develop non-invasive glucose monit=ring that will wipe out test strip products 
— Hardw=re startup without a product to sell yet, finalizing the development 
— Young team
