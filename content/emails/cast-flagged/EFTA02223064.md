Jeffrey has an 8:30am out of the house and I want to make sure he is back in time. Jeffreys home address is 9 East 71st street between 5th and Madison.

They'd need 1 h but I'd reserve 1.5 h, based on my previous experience they can run out of time. > • Dylan, Lesley is Jeffrey's assistant. She'd help to find some time to meet Jeffrey. I guess Sept 24; 26-27 would be the best days for Dylan. > • Masha EFTA_R1_00961266 EFTA02223065 |
