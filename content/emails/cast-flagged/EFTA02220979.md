If your travel plans change, call us before departure to change your reservation. If you do not board your train, your entire reservation from that point will be canceled. If you board a different train without notifying us, you will have to pay for it separately; the conductor cannot apply the money paid for your prior reservation. For most Acela Express Business class reservations and Reserved Coach class reservations, you must cancel your reservation at least 48 hours prior to the train's departure in order to be eligible for a full refund. If the reservation is not canceled prior to scheduled departure ("no show"), the entire amount paid for the reservation will be forfeited. See the refund/exchange policy at Amtrak.com/refund. • Summary of Conditions of Contract: Ticket valid for carriage or refund (subject to the refund rules of the fare purchased) for twelve months after day of issue unless otherwise specified. Amtrak tickets may only be sold or issued by Amtrak or an authorized travel agent/tour operator. Tickets sold or issued by an unauthorized third party will be voided by Amtrak. This ticket is a contract of carriage between Amtrak and the ticket holder, which is subject to specific terms and conditions, which are available for inspection at Amtrak ticket counters, on the Amtrak website at Amtrak.comiconditionsofcontract, or by calling 1-800-USA-RAIL. Tickets sold for non-Amtrak service are subject to the tariffs of the providing carrier. • Questions?
