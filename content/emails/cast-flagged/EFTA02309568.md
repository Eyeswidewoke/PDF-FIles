Don't get me wrong, I had my handful of silhouettes d=wn: a small stable of brands and styles that worked, but that was it—=ot unlucky in denim love, exactly, but aware of my limitations, every chang=ng room experience a battlefield strewn with pairs of ill-fitting, unflatte=ing, totally depressing denim that often left me uninspired, empty-handed, a=d endlessly covetous of the ideal-fitting jeans that seemed utterly beyond m= grasp. Re/Done chttp://shopredone.com/pages/discover-your-perfect-pair>'s denim came close, but no two pairs=fit alike, which, when you find a pair that fits perfectly, is something of=an anticlimax. Like a series of really great dates with a guy who's=leaving the country in a month, it feels like more of a tease than anything= I'm in it for the long-term. <http://www.vogue.com/tag/misc/denim=intcid=inline_amp> <http://www.vogue.com/tag/misc/denim?intcid=i=line_amp> And then a colleague took pity on me. Vogue, you see, is perhaps unsurprisingly full o= these perfect-jeans-wearers, and rather than a specific brand or site or s=ore, the universal explanation all came down to one idea: tailoring. Oh, co=e on, I'd say, you really tailo= your jeans? Who has the time? Who want= to spend the money? Well, my friends, i= turns out I have enough of the former to investigate. And what I found may=shock you: No one, actually, has a perfect jeans-body. We are all jeans-bodies: We just need to help our jeans alon=. Which is where tailoring comes in. Here, your guide to finding your ideal=pair—chances are that they've been in your closet all along= Here's what you need to know. 1. Proportion is key. Be aware of pockets and z=ppers; neither will be moved without a fight. Beware of too-long zippers (o=ten on men's vintage styles picked up at the flea market) or too-bi=, unflatteringly placed pockets: If these are relocated, the denim undernea=h will be a different color.

It4e=99s always easier for a tailor to take things a size smaller than the oppos=te. (Though denim panels can be added to give you some additional wiggle ro=m, it's not ideal.) You want the jeans to fit comfortably over your=largest body part (thigh, waist, hip)— everything else can be taken=in to your liking. 3. Be honest with yourself. Some things will n=ver be what you want them to be. Admit defeat and open your mind to other p=ssibilities—we are almost in cut-off season, after all! 4. Shockingly easy (and really quite inexpensi=e) fixes: Do your jeans fit well, other than that waistband gap? That4>=99s the easiest adjustment of all. Crave the new crop <http://www.vogue.com/85=5393/cropped-pant-trend-spring- 2015/?intcid=inline_amp> ? Have those suckers hemmed. Inner thighs worn through o= your skinnies? They're an inset panel away from a totally restruct=red (and stronger for it!) pair. The options are, if not endless, surprisin=ly varied. 5. Really, everyone looks better when their cl=thes are tailored. "It's addictive," says tailor Erin Hogan-Braker. "Once y=ur clothes fit really well, you never look back."
