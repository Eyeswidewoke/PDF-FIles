I am asking all chapter iii participants to reaffirm their orders for allocation by thursday of this 
week so we can allocate friday and close monday. So far the largest 'order' is 100% and the 
smallest is 3.5%. Assuming you want to stay where we discussed that would be 25% but it is 
clear now that there will be cutbacks. As promised I am coming back to you with that news so 
you can give me a real indication of greater or less than the 25% we discussed last time or you 
can tell me that you want to stay there. At this juncture I am estimating that cutbacks will 
approximate 50%, but for some it could be more and some less. Just let me know where you 
would like to end up in a perfect world (assuming you still wish to play). Thx.
