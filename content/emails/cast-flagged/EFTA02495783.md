yang is flexible in his use of the term probability... for example he in a number of papers refers to zipf as a 
probabiltiy dis=ribution. i have checked a number of his papers after your last rema=k, I think it is a mistake. he 
means that after empirical measurement . for ex word frequency, =AO. if ten times out of 100 the corpus has the 
word x. =hen he describes the probablility of finding the word as 10 percent=C2 . this is not correct. it is only the 
probablity of find=ng the word in the frequency list . but he is very accomplished at mathema=ical models.

Interesting image, but I don'= see what it tells us about language. 
The problem looks to me like this, ro=ghly. 
Take, say, the human visual system.=C2 There's a genetic component that determines that humans 
will=have a mammalian and not an insect visual system, and much else. Same wit= other subsystems of the organism —
"organs," =80 modules." Language in particular. The technical name fo= this component, whatever it turns out to be, is 
UG. UG therefore de=ermines that certain systems are possible I-languages for humans, others are not. =1 presume that 
is what the "biological organizing principle =9D for language is. It's plainly not an input system, though=it determines 
possible input systems for human languages. I don =80 t see how we improve understanding by looking at it from this 
perspective.</=pan> 
A minor technical problem, not serious, has to do with distinguishing digit=1 infinity from continuity, like 
continuous lines on the surface of a hemi=phere. 
I think you'll find Yang inte=esting.

it appear to me that ""language" can be defined as the=C2 biological organizing principle that creates a 
shape spa=e. "coherent sentences " are defined as those that f=t on the shape. The projections on the sensory motors, 
allows commun=cation. . There are an infinite digital number of sentences.that do fit on the shape , but=orders of 
magnitude more, that do not fit.- to attempt a naive=representation, imagine a hemisphere, ( symmetric), =AO any 
continuous line drawn on its surface , is a sentence. =C2 there are infinite numbers of lines that can be drawn. however 
, try=ng to connect two points , directly without traversing the hemishpere =AO is also infinitely possible but most 
solutions need to leav= the surface. The principle that organizes the shape is NOT an input device. one can map inputs 
onto the shap= but it is not THE shape , ex, a hemisphere bowl in 3 =pace, analogy, one can put marbles in the bowl 
and they will map a p=th to the bottom. but the shape of the bowl . determines how f=st they move, and in which 
direction, . the shape of the bowl is the language= there is a shape for vision as well. = it exists without input, certain 
paths are more probable etc.

On Yang, I read his work quite differ=ntly. He does make use of word frequencies and

I don't recall his using Zipf=E2 s "laws," but it wouldn't matter much. =AO Mandelbrot showed
