We like to watch live news and the news channels we have as apps, give us the possibility to watch fragments of old news. I thought that one must be a paying member for each channel (as I pay monthly for Netflix). But if there is an option, I'll be glad to try. We can fix for James to come as from September 8.

Wondering if you would like James, our IT man, to come and set up your Apple TV with about 15 apps to make watching TV easy...he has set up our other apartments this way and we thought you might like this as well. If so, we can set up a time to come and see you when you are here next. Please let me know! Thank EFTA_R1_00957484 EFTA02221138 |
