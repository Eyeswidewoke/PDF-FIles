HI Kim, 
I was just curious if you have a time frame when we will have access to =H? I wanted to try and start scheduling some 
work to be done in a few =f the apts and want to schedule to have the floors redone and the apt =ainted in 8H. If you're 
not sure yet, that's fine, just thought I'd =sk! Thanks
