The suspense is killing me. You're the last guy from whom I'm waiting to hear and, while I 
understand what you're saying, there are not degrees of pregnancy. I'm already pregnant. If I 
was that kind of guy I would not be the reliable and loyal friend I am. If that stuff worried me I 
would not have been with dubai, not have had the political affiliations I have, not have had the 
family dynamics I've had(!!), and would not have made regular pilgrimages to palm beach to 
visit a dear friend. Can you get over this please and let us all get back to having some fun in 
the business world?
