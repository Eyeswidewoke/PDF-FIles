The MIT Media Lab is an unusual Lab at MIT which is a research laboratory as well as a academic program under the 
school of Architecture and Planning called the Program in Media Arts and Sciences. We were founded in 1985 focusing 
on art, design, media and communications technology by a very diverse group of faculty to explore areas that traditional 
disciplines could not explore. The Lab is founded on a "constructionist" model of learning that focuses on=20 learning 
through doing with a strong emphasis and making and "practice=quot; in addition to theory. (See the two page 
description of the Lab attached for more details.) 
Recently, the Media Lab has been working in the life sciences broadening the research at the Lab beyond it's traditional 
boundaries connecting=20 to the hard sciences and leading the way to integrating them into a kind of "one science." 
As we tackle a kind of "head in the clouds and feet on the ground"= approach to questioning and coming up with new 
fundamental mathematical and scientific theories, we are also deeply practical, groundtruthing our theories and testing 
ideas through the development of new tools and experiments. 
We propose a new program for "One Science" to bring faculty, stud=nts and researchers from many disciplines and 
institutions together to develop a new meta-discipline that breaks the boundaries created by the traditional constraints 
of academic disciplines and government funding.
