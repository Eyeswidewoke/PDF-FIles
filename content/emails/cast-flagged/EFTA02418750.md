J, 
Had a really good dinner with DR last night. He was suitably modest when I told 
him of your compliment! 
1 for you he is actively seeking high net worth individuals for his Private Bank. 
Perhaps this is an avenue for your undecided Chinese? 
And he agrees that the concentration should be on who pays whom and when! 
Great to see you hope Paris is fun....
