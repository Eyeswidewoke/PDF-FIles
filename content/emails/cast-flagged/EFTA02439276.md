Epstein pleaded guilty last year to procuring teen girls for 
prostitution, ending his lifestyle with the rich and famous in 
a Palm Beach, Florida scandal that reverberated through 
high-profile society. He received an 18-month sentence 
and was slated to be incarcerated until the end of this year. 
But now, says the source, the jail door is about to swing 
open because Epstein has been secretly helping the feds 
unravel a suspected Ponzi scheme. He had inside 
knowledge of the scheme because he was one of its 
victims, losing $67 million. 
The source says it s all tied to the indictment of former 
managers of Bear Stearns Mortgage Investment Fund, and 
in that case Epstein is the person who is identified only as 
Victim # 1. 
Meanwhile, Epstein s life behind bars hasn t been too 
rough 
in fact he s allowed to spend most days at his 
attorney s office. He was supposedly working on a 
charity venture but the source says he was actually busy 
helping the feds with the Ponzi scheme. One source says 
that he s been guarded by men in suits with earphones.
