Hi Kathy and Stuart, 
You may have already seen this article, but sharing it ju=t in case you haven't. Please let us know if we can be of 
any help c=ordinating with the client's PR firm, which Stuart mentioned that y=u were doing yesterday. 
According to Wikip=dia, "Heat Street is a libertarian conservative news, opinion and c=mmentary website. 
Launched in February 2016, the website is headed by U.S. b=sed British writer and former politician Louise Mensch. It is 
owned by News=Corp under Dow Jones & Company."

The mystery s=rrounding a would-be media magnate — who owns surveillance and secu=ity firms working for 
repressive regimes — is growing. 
The questions about Matania (Mati) Kochavi were sparked=again this weekend when Kathryn Ruemmler, who 
until recently was President O=ama's White House Counsel, showed up on Saturday morning in local W=shington DC 
court to represent one of the 217 people arrested for rioting o= Inauguration Day. 
(http://heatst.com/wp-co=tent/uploads/2017/01/ruemmler-obama.jpg?w=300JKathryn chttp://heatst.com/wp-
content=uploads/2017/01/ruemmler-obama.jpg?w=300)Kathryn> Ruemmler and cl=ent. 
Ms. Ruemmler said she was there to re=resent a journalist, on assignment for the media company 
Vocativ<http://www.vocativ.comk, who'd g=tten swept up with the protesters in the arrests. 
Vocativ is owned by Kochavi. Reporters at the courthouse asked why a=big gun like Ruemmler, who has long 
been a specialist in corporate crime, w=uld show up for what would seem to be a misunderstanding involving a 
journa=ist doing his job. 
Ms. Ruemmler told Buzzf=ed that Vocativ is a client of her 
firm,<https://www.buzzfeed.com/zoetillman/prose=utors-pursue-rioting-charges-over-inauguration-day-
pro?utm_term..gtPej4zo=#.cgyzaBvG2 <https://www.buzzfeed=com/zoetillman/prosecutors-pursue-rioting-charges-
over-inauguration-day-pro=utm_term=.gtPej4zon#.cgyzaBvG2» Latham & Watkins. The firm is one of the most 
prest=gious law shops in New York and Washington with partners such as 
Ruemmler&I=;https://www.lw.com/p=ople/kathrynruemmler <https://www.lw.com/people/kathrynruemmler» 
charging thousands of dollars an hour.<=r> 
She did look somewhat out of place among the lawye=s there to defend anarchists and other alleged 
troublemakers who are charge= with rioting, burning a limo and smashing up stores on the streets of the c=pital. "The 
individuals charged were generally brought in front of t=e judge in groups of 10 and were represented by a cadre of 
2 
EFTA_R1_01346828 
EFTA02358900

public defenders=and other court-appointed lawyers," according to Buzzfeed. That was=not the case when it came to 
Vocativ. 
Base= in New York and Tel Aviv, Vocativ publishes mostly reprints of health stud=es, aggregated videos for 
Facebook, and female focused feature pieces. The c=mpany which employs a large team of US journalists and ex-Israeli 
intellige=ce operatives, claims to use technology from the intelligence world to sour=e its stories. Indeed its founder, 
Kochavi, has a background in Israeli int=lligence, having made his fortune providing security and military grade pub=ic 
safety solutions to the superrich Emirate of Abu Dhabi through an entity=called AGT. 
(http://heatst.com/wp-content/upl=ads/2017/01/abu-dhabi-mosque.jpg?w=300)The <http://heatst.com/wp-
content/upload=/2017/01/abu-dhabi-mosque.jpg?w=3001The> Grand Mosque of Abu Dhabi<=span> 
AGT was responsible for installing a 40=9Cunique civil surveillance network in Abu Dhabi that means 'every 
p=rson is monitored from the moment they leave their doorstep to the moment trey return to it,— according to the 
noted security publicat=on MiddleEastEye.<http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/uae-israel-surv=illance-2104952769 
<http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/uae-israe=-surveillance-2104952769» The invasive system is dubbed "Falcon 
Ey=". 
Kochavi also owns Israeli secur=ty and private intelligence firms 3iMind and Logic Industries. Like Vocativ= 
3iMind claims to use "the deep web" to mine information, t=ough in 3i Mind's case it provides spy services, not 
journalistic on=s. 3i Mind even advertises online that it will spy on "the planning a=d execution of violent civil unrest" for 
clients.<https://www.3i-mind=com/use_cases/political-social-unrest/> 
<=pan>The website for Kochavi's mother companychttps://www.agtinternational.com/about/ 
<https://=ww.agtinternational.com/about/> =gt;, AGT, claims its current business is using "Internet of Things*=804, 
technology for entertainment and "fashion" applicatio=s in partnership with the giant talent agency WME-IMG ... though 
it40.804>s unclear what any of these applications really are<http://www.euroleague.net/final-four/=erlin-
2016/news/i/6vokoibj5fsgqg4q/heed-the-event-platform-based-joint-vent=re-between-wme-img-and-agt-international-
makes-first-official-foray-into-sp=rts>, and certainly what value they provide for entertainment. Secur=ty experts say 
Internet of Things type sensors could be tied together to mo=itor crowds for security purposes. 
Accordi=g to Israeli and U.S. Jewish publications, the lines within Kochavi'= companies can blur, with Vocativ 
employees doing work for 3iMind and Logic= and vice versa. So who was this "journalist" arrested amid=the unrest on 
Inauguration Day? Was he actually doing journalism? Or, as so=e journalists around town have been asking, could he 
also have been doing s=rveillance of anti-Trump demonstrators on behalf of an Arab or Israeli clie=t, possibly a foreign 
government?

A call to Ruemmler was returned by someone identifyi=g himself as a Vocativ spokesperson. He told Heat Street 
that the arrested e=ployee, Evan Engel, was doing purely journalistic work at the time he was d=tained. 
"The arrest, detainment an= rioting charge against journalist Evan Engel who was covering the protests=for 
Vocativ are an affront to the First Amendment and journalistic freedom,=E24* the spokesperson said. "Vocativ will 
vigorously cont=st this unfounded and outrageous charge." 
Kochavi has taken pains to put a different face, unrelated to spying=and surveillance, on his American activities. 
Vocativ acts like a news orga=ization, though it's made little splash (and gets remarkably little=web 
traffic<http:/=www.alexa.com/siteinfo/vocativ.com <http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/vocativ.com») for an operation 
so large and e=pensive.

Kochavi has also shown little hes=tation to pay top dollar for access to the most powerful figures in America=to 
provide legitimacy for his American activities. Last fall's Wiki=edia data dump revealed that he and his longtime business
