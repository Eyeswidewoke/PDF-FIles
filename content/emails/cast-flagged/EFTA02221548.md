I think having you up for the Newport boat show is by far the best way to fully experience what SEALEGS has to offer. You'll not only be able to see all of our models (both new and pre-owned) but also have the chance to demo each. We would love to have you and can arrange tickets accordingly. Our Sealegs craft are very special amphibious craft which will transform your boating experience and bring you and your family considerable enjoyment. The ability to launch and land in places with ease and visit places you never thought possible will revolutionize your EFTA_R1_00958270 EFTA02221549 boating. One of the greatest benefits of Sealegs over traditional vessels is the ease and safety of launching - no trailer - no tractor - no concern about the tide - no assistance required. You will use your Sealegs far more often than a traditional boat. Statistically, Sealegs owners use their Sealegs 4-5 times more than if they were using a traditional boat and trailer. Accordingly, your investment in a Sealegs amphibious craft represents excellent value. Sealegs are high performance craft whose performance is not compromised by its amphibious capabilities. There are 8 different models of Sealegs craft available: http://www.sealegsrecreational.coml 6.1m, available in a RIB or an aluminum D-tube 7.1m, available in a RIB 7.7m, available in a full width console RIB or as a Cabin RIB. 2100ST Stabicraft Amphibious by Sealegs 9.0, Interceptor I have attached some Brochures for your information including a Pricelist link which shows all the different options available, such as biminis, storage covers etc. http://www.sealegsrecreational.com/sealegs-pricing- USDa.html If you would like to view further information, photos and videos of Sealegs craft in action please visit our website www.sealegs.com or at our YouTube page (https://www.youtube.comiuser/Sea legsAmphibious) Thanks again for your interest in Sealegs, and I hope to hear from you soon.
