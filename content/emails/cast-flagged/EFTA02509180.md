Exch=nge offer 
For eac= new share of Series 6 preferred purchased, Mort gets to take a share of c=mmon stock and convert it to 
3.5 shares of Series 6 preferred. 
As you =now Series 6 has a lx liquidation preference and is senior to all other ro=nds, so this offer allows the 
common to move up in the stack to be the mos= senior equity and gives them a liquidation price of $39.44 a share 
($11.26 x 3.5). 
It is a= amazing offer for shareholders that own common. 
aspan> 
See =elow — if they invest $14mm now they end up with $64mm (5.7mm shar=s x $11.26) of Series 6 Liquidation
