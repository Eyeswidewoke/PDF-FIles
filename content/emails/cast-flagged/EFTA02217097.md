I hope this does not happen when I am gone! I had people flying on planes 2 with super hours long delays and needed to get them changed this morning!! Please please if Jeffrey has anyone flying in and out you must check on their flight status prior to their departure and make sure that flights are on time not canceled not delayed etc. If something like this occurs, you must alert Jeffrey and find options. Like I said, I hope Jeffrey is not flying people in and out next week! >>>> »» Sent from my iPhone >» EFTA_R1_00946820 EFTA02217097 |
