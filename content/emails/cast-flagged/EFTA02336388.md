| **To** | Richard Kahn Su=ject: Re: Library </=iv> Dear Richard, =div>the samples are ready for approval. I finished one column about 95%, as=l want to put some accents on it but after I discuss it with Mr. Epstein. l=also finished upper section above the blackboard. I also finished some othe= columns, not completely, because I need the approval. My feeling is that s=meone was already working in the Library, as I can see a lot of waxing done= I finished one column so it will correspond with the rest of the deco=. You can not remove the whitish color completely. There are some "bald" co=umns, which in my opinion do not sort of belong to the Library any more as t=ey are completely brown. Everything has to have at least an shadow of what i= around. The top carving, moldings columns and other elements in the Librar=, have to "bond" together. The upper small carvings, have to be finished in=ividually, as a play between the whitish color and natural brown color of o=k wood. I sort of model the shapes of the crabs, snails and other creatures=and they come alive. I think I did good work but Mr. Epstein needs to appro=e it so I can go ahead and finish the project. Kindly, wrote: Dear Rich=rd, I am not sure whether the photos depict the column right. I l=oked at it and does not do the justice to what you have on the column. I ho=e you can see the details like even changing the white areas into rubbed on=s and emphasising crabs. Making the rope "wet" looking. contrasting the rub=ed areas with white, and looking at the entire column as a whole. EFTA_R1_01296521 EFTA02336388 All the columns are looking different, as somebody would work previously o= them, and some of them are over-rubbed, some of them are not rub=ed at all. The upper part also, I prepared a sample, so Mr. Epstein can see=the difference.

I did the same with "whites"= Then I emphasized certain elements even more, like rope, net, crabs. This w=rk requires more than finisher to do it. I have high hopes, than this time M=. Epstein will like the work. If he accepts finishing this way, I will fini=h it may be even this coming week, providing, I can work 10-12 hours a day.=I do not want to work even longer hours, because you are not sharp and stil= you can spoil delicate balance required for this finish. > Do you want me to send you some photos?
