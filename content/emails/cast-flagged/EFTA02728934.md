Re: 
Jeffrey Epstein 
Dear Lanna: 
I am In receipt of your letter, of today's date, confirming the offer of 
settlement in the Jeffrey Epstein matter. Please allow this response to 
serve as my acceptance with the following clarifications: 
1) 
You have agreed to allow Mr. Epstein to enter a Guilty Best Interest 
Plea. 
Additionally, you have agreed to review authority I provide 
concerning the effect a "guilty" plea has on a civil matter and in good faith 
consider allowing Mr. Epstein to plea "No contest" 
2) 
Regarding, the supervised contact, your letter refers to an 
"approved" adult In our meeting today, you did not mention that the 
supervisor had to be approved. I agree that the supervision must be by an 
adult, other than 
 
with knowledge of the 
underlying facts. Additionally, I need to confirm that Mr. Epstein may be 
with his gocklaughter-without-supervision. 
3) 
You agreed not to object to my selecting a duly licensed and.
experienced psychologist to conduct the evaluation. 
4) 
I accept the provision for payment of the cost of investigation for the 
Palm Beach Police Department as long as the cost is reasonable. 
6) 
Although your correspondence does not mention travel, I am 
confirming your agreement to allow Mr. Epstein to travel for business 
purposes. In line with our discussions, I request that you agree to allow 
Mr. Epstein to travel for philanthropy as well.
