Kimbal said that Jeffrey is good on his end, but I want to double check with someone who is really in the know. I can't get him out on a later flight. He departs at 3pm out of LGA. Let me know.

That sounds wonderful, if everyone can swing it. Kimbal has a flight out of LGA at 3pm, would it be possible for an early lunch? Thanks!
