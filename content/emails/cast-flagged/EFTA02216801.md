| **Subject** | Re: Jeffrey Epstein no I'm in paris and in the next 2 weeks I'll be in london during the week for the auctions, and Berlin at an event for the Berggruen museum in between. I will be in Europe all of July and might be back in NY a bit early august; that's the closest date I think I will be there I'm afraid. Has he planned a trip to Europe this summer? As we could meet around here if he wants? Best, Jude > On Jun 15, 2017, at 9:52 PM, wrote: > Hello Jude...hope you are well.
