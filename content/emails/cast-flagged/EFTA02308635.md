I've gotten 2=other quotes from contractors that each came back with $22,000. I'm hoping i= Penn's is less than this, JE will be OK with us going with him. I think it=s alot easier for all involved to use Penn, and we just have to convince JE=that as long as we have all materials, etc, he can finish in 2 weeks. (that=s the time frame Penn gave me). Also the tiles I'm ordering for 8H are quit= large, 12"x35" so he said that will be alot faster to install. » I'm having all the materials delivered on Tuesday to the building, they s=id curbside delivery. It will be the wall and floor tiles, grout, toilet, v=nity, sink fixture and shower fixtures. (still looking for actual sink top,=med cabinet and towel bar). How should they proceed with delivering the ite=s if they only deliver curbside? Is there someone who can help bring all th= items up to the apt? We will have our painter in the building as well who c=n help. » On Jun 1, 2012, at 11:51 AM, Anthony Barrett wrote: >» Did you meet? >» >» >» On Jun 1, 2012, at 9:24 AM, wrote: »» He just responded.
