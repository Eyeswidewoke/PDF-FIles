1. I am in receipt of the document you sent as w=11 as the email that you proposed that Bill send out. 
2. Can you confirm Bill's invitation to me on August 8=h. I will need the details. time place etc. 
3. Bill has previously sent an email to me authorizing=you to talk about employment issues„ I would like a 
broader author=zation as some of the issues at hand you have previously described as outside of Boris's employment. 
. I would appreciate an =mail or call from Bill acknowledging his full understanding . 
some simple preliminary housekeeping items first; 
I thought there was to be deal points before document drafting but=.. 
1.Shouldn't most covenants be mutual, 
Melinda and Bi=l signing . . . 
2. The new severance payment in the agreement ha= been reduced to only one year? is that Bills and 
Melinda's&n=sp; new position? 
3, I assume Bill is aware that Boris would be required=to keep some emails to sustain his tax position , ( I will 
discuss d=rectly with Bill ) 
4 the document you sent , makes no mention of th= already existing agreement with re Boris's investment 
override = 
5. the document changes "at will" to another type =f employment, ( why ?). , 
6. it makes no mention of Bills commitment to help&nbs=; Boris find another position. 
7 If Melinda wants a divorce , how does Boris protect =imself. 
8 documents that support your authorization to sign on behalf of b=3. , manager binding? if that is the 
eventual position.&=bsp; 
I cannot stress enough that Boris is emotionally very fragile.very=1 I mentioned this in both of our telephone 
calls. Can =ill send him an email or something that calms him.?
