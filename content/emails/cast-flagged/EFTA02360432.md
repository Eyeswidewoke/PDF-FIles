This, after all, was what former Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak (currently Israel's defense minister) and former US president Bill Clinton had offered Arafat in December 2000 (the Clinton "Parameters") and this is what former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert offered Abbas in 2008—and this is what both Palestinian leaders rejected.

The Arab Spring and The Palestine 
Distraction 
Josef Joffe 
APRIL 26, 2011 -- In politics, shoddy theories never die. In the 
Middle East, one of the oldest is that Palestine is the "core" regional 
issue. This zombie should have been interred at the beginning of the 
Arab Spring, which has highlighted the real core conflict: the 
oppressed vs. their oppressors. But the dead keep walking. 
"The plight of the Palestinians has been a root cause of unrest and 
conflict in the region," insisted Turkish President Abdullah Gul in the 
New York Times last week. "Whether these [recent] uprisings lead to 
democracy and peace or to tyranny and conflict will depend on 
forging a lasting Israeli-Palestinian peace." Naturally, "the U.S. has a 
long overdue responsibility" to forge that peace. 
Writing in the Financial Times, former U.S. National Security 
Adviser Brent Scowcroft intoned: "The nature of the new Middle 
East cannot be known until the festering sore of the occupied 
territories is removed." Read: The fate of democracy hinges on 
Palestine. 
So do "Iran's hegemonic ambitions," he insinuated. This is why 
Tehran reaches for the bomb? Syria, too, will remain a threat "as long 
as there is no regional peace agreement." The Assad regime is 
slaughtering its own people for the sake of Palestine? And unless 
Riyadh "saw the U.S. as moving in a serious manner" on Palestine, 
Mr. Scowcroft warned, the Saudis might really sour on their great 
protector from across the sea. So when they sent troops into Bahrain, 
were they heading for Jerusalem by way of Manama?

Shoddy political theories—ideologies, really—never die because they 
are immune to the facts. The most glaring is this: These revolutions 
have unfolded without the usual anti-American and anti-Israeli 
screaming. It's not that the demonstrators had run out of Stars and 
Stripes to trample, or were too concerned about the environment to 
burn Benjamin Netanyahu in effigy. It's that their targets were Hosni 
Mubarak, Zine el Abidine Ben-Ali, Moammar Gadhafi and the others—
no stooges of Zionism they. In Benghazi, the slogan was: "America is 
our friend!" 
The men and women of the Arab Spring are not risking their lives for 
a "core" issue, but for the freedom of Egypt, Tunisia, Libya and 
Syria. And of Iran, as the Green revolutionaries did in Tehran in 
2009. 
Every "Palestine-first" doctrine in the end comes down to that 
fiendish "Arab Street": The restless monster must be fed with Israeli 
concessions lest he rise and sweep away our good friends—all those 
dictators and despots who pretended to stand between us and 
Armageddon. Free Palestine, the dogma goes, and even Iran and 
Syria will turn from rabid to responsible. The truth is that the 
American and Israeli flags were handed out for burning by those 
regimes themselves. 
This is how our good friends have stayed in power: Divert attention 
and energy from oppression and misery at home by rousing the 
masses against the enemy abroad. How can we have free elections, 
runs a classic line, as long as they despoil our sacred Islamic lands? 
This is why anti-Americanism and anti-Semitism are as rampant 
among our Saudi and Egyptian allies as among the hostile leaders of 
Iran and Syria. 
The Palestinians do deserve their own state. But the Palestine-first 
strategy reverses cause and effect. It is not the core conflict that feeds 
the despotism; it is the despots who fan the conflict, even as they

fondle their U.S.-made F-16s and quietly work with Israel. Their 
peoples are the victims of this power ploy, not its drivers. This is 
what the demonstrators of Tahrir Square and the rebels of Benghazi 
have told us with their silence on the Palestine issue. 
So Palestine has nothing to do with it? It does, though not in the 
ways insisted by Messrs. Gul and Scowcroft. The sounds of silence 
carry a different message: "It's democracy, stupid!" Freedom does not 
need the enemy at the gate. Despots do, which is why they happily let 
the Palestinian sore fester for generations. 
Israel, which has reacted in utter confusion to the fall of Mubarak, 
might listen up as well. If democracies don't have to "busy giddy 
minds with foreign quarrels," as Shakespeare has it in Henry IV, then 
Israel's reformed neighbors might at last be ready for real, not just 
cold peace. Mr. Mubarak was not. Nor is Mr. Assad of Syria, who 
has refused every Israeli offer to hand back the Golan Heights. If you 
rule at the head of a tiny Alawite minority, why take the Heights and 
give away a conflict that keeps you in power? Peace at home—
justice, jobs and consent—makes for peace abroad. 
Still, don't hold your breath. Yes, democracy is where history is 
going, but it is a long, perilous journey even from Tunis to Tripoli, let 
alone all the way to Tehran.

International Studies and a fellow at the Hoover Institution, both at 
Stanford.

The Israel-Palestine Vote Igniting the 
Mideast 
Leslie H. Gelb 
April 24, 2011 -- Almost certainly, the United Nations General 
Assembly will vote in September to grant statehood to Palestine, thus 
legally removing it from Israeli authority. Almost every U.N. member 
will vote "aye." Israel will reject the vote because such a Palestinian 
state would include half a million Israeli settlers living there 
unprotected. The United States cannot void the statehood resolution 
because its veto applies only to U.N. Security Council decisions. 
This story of a vote foretold should not be dismissed as the usual 
diplomatic gamesmanship with little or no consequences. The stage is 
being set for calamity: The high risk of Palestinian riots to fully claim 
their state, followed by very tough Israeli crackdowns—adding fire to 
the unexpected and unpredictable popular upheavals across the 
Middle East. According to American, Israeli, and Palestinian 
officials, the tales within counter tales begin with an invitation from 
House Speaker John Boehner to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin 
Netanyahu to address a joint session of the U.S. Congress on May 24. 
Boehner acts as if the idea of inviting "Bibi," as the prime minister is 
universally known, was his own. But the facts indicate that this most-
sought-after event was initiated at Bibi's behest. Now, the White 
House couldn't say no and risk an open rupture with Israel's 
supporters, so officials there unhappily went along. The Obama 
administration saw the "invitation" as a power play by Bibi to head 
off new and tough U.S. demands on Israel, and particularly to try to 
corner the White House into backing Israel in the September U.N.

vote. That seems to be precisely what Bibi had in mind as well, but—
and here's one of the many new twists in this saga—he had no clear 
idea of what he would say to Congress. Indeed, the U.S. side can't 
seem to figure out what to say either, or what strategy to adopt overall 
at this time. The only ones who appear to know their hand are the 
Palestinian leaders. They intend to stand pat, hoping that the pending 
U.N. vote will force critical Israeli concessions without the 
Palestinians having to lift a compromising finger. Mind you, the 
Israeli and American governments are talking to each other behind 
the scenes constantly, trying to discover the other's thinking without 
divulging their own. At this moment, however, there doesn't seem to 
be much to discover. 
Back in Jerusalem, Bibi is planning how to generate such a strong 
embrace by Congress in his address that President Obama will fear 
abandoning him. At the same time, he doesn't wish to publicly 
confront and thus alienate Obama. Israelis feel they've offered major 
compromises over the years, with nothing in return from the 
Palestinian Authority headed by President Abbas. Bibi seems 
inclined, contrary to his right-wing coalition partners, to speak of a 
return to the 1967 borders with land swaps to protect Israeli 
settlements. He won't give a Palestinian capital in Jerusalem, and he 
wants the PA to accept Israel as a Jewish state with a very limited 
right of Palestinian return to Israel. Further, Israel believes it must 
have security agreements to limit sharply the armaments and military 
activities of a Palestinian state. But Bibi is unlikely to showcase all 
this to Congress. Present thinking is to do some peace talk, plus 
words of caution about Iran, plus a welcome and a wariness about the 
new popular awakenings among Arabs. The aim is to capture as much 
U.S. support as possible at the U.N. and maybe add two or three 
states like Germany to the tiny list of nations voting against

Palestinian statehood. Bibi realizes he faces substantial isolation at 
the U.N., but he doesn't want total isolation. 
As for the Obama team at the moment, it has many choices and no 
answers. It can't decide whether Obama should give a speech before 
or after Bibi's congressional oration. After would look like a rebuttal 
rather than a White House initiative. Going first, however, is hard 
without a message. Some official
