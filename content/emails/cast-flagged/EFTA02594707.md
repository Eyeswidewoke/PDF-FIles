introductions 
Jeff, 
I think it would be worthwhile for you to meet with Andrew and James, two g=ys that are scouring the world for me to 
look for terrific early-stage VC =nvestments. We've scored two terrific hits in the last four years (Xero i= New Zealand 
and Transferwise in the UK), and are in the process of pullin= together a second fund for Valar Ventures (the name of 
this platform). 
It would make sense for you to put in $10-20MM here -- and I'd be happy to =iscuss some more when I see you next in 
person. 
Trust all is well,
