I'm not sure if he touched base with you yet or not, but Mr Epstein would like for you two to work at the house with and next time Mr Epstein is there, which will be at the end of this month. The dates aren't set yet, but I think that's the best way to move forward so he can meet you and you can get a real sense of what it's like with him in residence. I will touch base as soon as I have confirmed dates, but wanted you to know what we are thinking. Have a great July 4th and we will talk soon!
