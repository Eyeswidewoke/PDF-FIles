Touching base re your trip! I show you are to arrive on July 12 and stay to July 17th! You will stay in apt 108. The new code (in case I gave you a code before) is now 1074. The address to the apartments is 301 East 66th street (corner of 2nd Ave and 66th). Jeffrey will be in town and would like Dr Bard to come see him. Might he have time in the 12th or 13th? Jeffrey leaves 13th evening. Please let me know! Thanks, Lesley >>>> »» Sent from my iPhone >» >> EFTA_R1_00948958 EFTA02218031 |
