I have a piece of leather which I want to match the color for the =edroom; a very dark taupe color. I can leave it with my doorman for you =o collect so you can work on a sample. My new apt is 11J. You are =elcome to work there is you wish.. it's empty and still a work site... =p to you. For the living room I want something very neutral =ith perhaps a slight design in it kind of like Jeffrey's gym in NY on =he 4th floor.. not sure if you've seen that room or not. The walls are =n off white color but have a bit of a geometric design with different =hades of the same color. I can send pics as well I will =lso leave you with the sample of the wood floors which will be going =nto the living room so you can work with that coloring. Thanks and =elcome back! =onday.
