We can do some powerful deals when partnering with China to co-invest abroad, but we need to 
start the process soon. 
People are starting to talk about this now... 
Writing in the Financial Times of London, Yu Qiao, a professor of economics in the School of 
Public Policy and Management at Tsighua University in Beijing, proposed a plan for the U.S. 
government to guarantee foreign investments in the United States. While Secretary Clinton may 
not have pledged American homes to China under eminent domain rights, the Obama 
administration may well be willing grant a financial guarantee as an inducement for China to 
convert U.S. debt into Chinese direct equity investment to establish Chinese ownership in U.S. 
successful corporations and potentially profitable infrastructure projects. 
Is the Obama administration is willing to put the U.S. for sale to China in order to induce China to 
keep financing U.S. government deficit spending? 
The U.S. Treasury is preparing to borrow $2.5 trillion in 2009 and another $4 trillion in 2010, an 
amount that would increase by 65 percent in two years the $10 trillion in national debt 
accumulated since George Washington was president. As noted in the same chapter, the U.S. 
government faces over $65 trillion in unfunded Social Security and Medicare benefits scheduled 
to be paid out largely to baby boomer retirees in the coming decades. Yu Qiao observed that 
foreign nations now hold $1.6 trillion of U.S. government debt, with Asians including China and 
Japan holding half of the outstanding public-owned U.S. Treasury bonds. He also noted China 
directly or indirectly holds more than $1.2 billion of U.S. treasury bonds. 
If the U.S. dollar collapsed under the weight of proposed Obama administration trillion dollar 
budget deficits into the foreseeable future, holders of U.S. debt would face substantial losses that 
the Financial Times estimated "would devastate Asians' hard-earned wealth and terminate 
economic globalization." 
"The basic idea is to turn Asian savings, China's in particular, into real business interests rather 
than let them be used to support U.S. over-consumption," Yu Qiao wrote, reflecting themes 
commonly suggested by Chinese government officials. "While fixed-income securities are 
vulnerable to any fall in the value of the dollar, equity claims on sound corporations and 
infrastructure projects are at less risk from a currency default." 
The problem is that China does not want to trade Chinese investment in U.S. Treasury debt 
securities, with their inherent risk of dollar devaluation, for equally risky investments in U.S. 
corporations and infrastructure projects, where a struggling U.S. economy could risk the 
depreciation of those assets. 
"But Asians do not want to bear the risk of this investment because of market turbulence and a 
lack of knowledge of cultural, legal and regulatory issues in U.S. businesses," he stressed.

"However if a guarantee scheme were created, Asian savers could be willing to invest directly in 
capital-hungry U.S. industries." 
Yu Qiao's plan included four components: 
I. Asian countries would negotiate with the U.S. government to create a "crisis relief facility," or 
CRF. The CRF "would be used alongside U.S. federal efforts to stabilize the banking system and 
to invest in capital-intensive infrastructure projects such as high-speed railroad from Boston to 
Washington, D.C. 
2. Asian nations and especially China would pool a portion of their holdings of Treasury bonds 
under the CFR umbrella to convert sovereign debt into equity. Any CFR funds that were 
designated for investment in U.S. corporations would still be owned and managed by U.S. equity 
holders, with the Asians holding minority equity shares "that would, like preferred stock, be 
convertible." 
3. The U.S. government would act as a guarantor, "providing a sovereign guarantee scheme to 
assure the investment principal of the CRF against possible default of targeted companies or 
projects. 
4. The Federal Reserve would set up a special account to supply the liquidity the CRF would 
require to swap sovereign debt into industrial investment in the United States. 
"The CRF would lessen Asians' concern about implicit default of sovereign debts caused by a 
collapsing dollar," Yu Qiao concluded. "It would cost little and help the U.S. by channeling funds 
to business investment." 
This plan to convert Chinese debt to equity investments in the United States could easily add 
another $1 trillion to outstanding Obama administration guarantees issued in the current economic 
crisis.
