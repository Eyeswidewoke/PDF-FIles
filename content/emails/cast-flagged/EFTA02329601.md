| **Subject** | Next Steps 4=iv> Good after=oon Karyna, Please let me know when you plan o= completing and submitting the forms. I suggest that this be done im=ediately (Monday) as I am sure that nothing will get done in the governmen= offices the week of Thanksgiving. Ms. Hendricks is set to process y=ur paper work for the malpractice insurance but I am more concerned about =he Bureau of Internal Revenue re your tax clearance letter. That bei=g said, Ms. Hendricks' last day in the office is Tuesday, November 30th so=we need to get the applicable form into her soon as well. With warm=regards, Cecile EFTA_R1_01258817 EFTA02329601 |
