Not sure how long it will take to arrive at Tropical If you could send me the size of the large frame which came down on the plane so I know what size photo will need to go in it once he chooses something as well. I told the framers for Zorro Steve will call him directly and I've given him my credit card info for payment On Jul 10, 2012, at 11:18 AM,IIIIIIMIllwrote: Hi Just want to give you an update on info etc that happened with JE meeting this morning Confirming that you will be purchasing a piano bench with adjustable height option, will need to be black to match the piano and have storage for sheet music Do you have a delivery time for the sofas for 5 Palms? He agreed to move the Restoration furniture from 5 Palms to the Kite once they are on site Would like to look at a different desk for the pool cabana and new furniture - want more like the furniture in the pool cabana in RI, hence orange sofa will move back to Media Room Wooden/Gold frame brought down on the plane - looking at placing a canvas/picture and framing for S Palms Can we review the white piece of furniture you suggested for the Relax Room - possibly comes in different sizes I think you mentioned! Blue Rugs - Relax bathroom & vanity area - bedroom Sam's Place Unable to get punching bag etc delivered to USVI, hence JE wants me to forward details to Rich B to buy in NYC and get to LSJ On the Zorro front he wants a punch list on things which I will put together over the next few days Carlos & Norma are to be hired<330.gif> Estancia Curtains were stored away wet - hence really moldy, will get new made from Sunbrella locally One thing I have no idea about - a canvas which is in the cross room - was suppose to be framed!!!! I did see some traffic thru Manoilto and when I asked him about it he said he was working with JE on this!!! - sorry I have added Zorro items to LSJ E Mail, but you get the idea Please review and let me know what does not make sense Thanks est regards LSJ,ILC Island Manager 6100 Red Hook Quarters Suite B3 St Thomas EFTA_R1_01199131 EFTA02311906 USVI 00802 2 EFTA_R1_01199132 EFTA02311907 |
