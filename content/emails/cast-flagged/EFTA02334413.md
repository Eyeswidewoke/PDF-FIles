update 
I was just wondering how things were progressing - if that's the right word! -
with the Vanity Fair story; I hope it will end up better than expected (we did 
have such luck with a Gail Sheehy profile of Senator Clinton in Vanity Fair, but 
we never felt comfortable about it until we saw it in print; and even then would 
have preferred nothing at all).
