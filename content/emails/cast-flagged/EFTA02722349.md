After Meeting With Clinton, Egypt's 
Military Chief Steps Up Political Feud 
Kareem Fahim 
July 15, 2012 -- CAIRO - Egypt's top military official stepped 
up his feud with the Muslim Brotherhood on Sunday, saying the 
army would prevent Egypt from falling to a "certain group," 
according to the state news agency. 
The remarks by the official, Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein 
Tantawi, did not mention the Brotherhood by name but were 
EFTA_R1_02207139 
EFTA02722350

widely seen as a reference to the group and to Mohamed Morsi, 
Egypt's newly elected president and a former Brotherhood 
leader. And they came just hours after Secretary of State Hillary 
Rodham Clinton met with the field marshal in Cairo in an effort 
to prod Egypt's military to hand its power to civilians. 
The accelerating dispute between the military and the 
Brotherhood marked the latest unpredictable turn in Egypt's 
chaotic transition, and underscored the challenges Mrs. Clinton 
faced on her two-day visit to Egypt. 
Constrained by an almost complete mistrust of the United 
States' motives, Mrs. Clinton was forced to avoid strong calls 
for a quick end to military rule, favoring language instead that 
called for Egyptian solutions along with respect for minority 
rights. 
And with little leverage except a promise of economic 
assistance, she struggled to coax the military and Mr. Morsi to 
resolve their rift. 
She also faced anger from Christian leaders, including some 
who boycotted a meeting with her on Sunday, objecting to what 
they said was interference by the United States in Egypt's 
politics in order to aid an Islamist rise to power. 
Though there is little evidence that the Islamists needed 
American help in gaining power — or indeed, received it — the 
complaints reflected the country's anxious politics and growing 
concerns among many Christians and secular-minded Egyptians 
about Islamist rule. 
After meeting Mr. Morsi on Saturday, Mrs. Clinton sat down on 
EFTA_R1_02207140 
EFTA02722351

Sunday morning with Field Marshal Tantawi, whose military 
council took power after President Hosni Mubarak was deposed 
last year. The military still retains broad legislative and 
executive authority, having seized further powers before the 
presidential election in June. 
After the meeting, which lasted a little over an hour, a senior 
State Department official said Field Marshal Tantawi and Mrs. 
Clinton had discussed the economy, regional security, "the 
political transition" and the military's "ongoing dialogue with 
President Morsi." 
Field Marshal Tantawi emphasized that Egyptians needed "help 
getting the economy back on track," the official said. "The 
secretary stressed the importance of protecting the rights of all 
Egyptians, including women and minorities." 
But just hours after the meeting, Mrs. Clinton appeared to have 
achieved little reconciliation between the two sides. "Egypt will 
not fall," Field Marshal Tantawi said at a military ceremony. "It 
is for all Egyptians, not for a certain group — the armed forces 
will not allow that." 
Mrs. Clinton's afternoon meeting with leaders of Egypt's 
Christian minority touched on one of the transition's rawest 
nerves: the fear that Mr. Morsi and his allies would move swiftly 
to lay the foundations of a pious, Muslim state. 
Those anxieties have caused some liberals and Coptic leaders to 
support the military in its feud with the Brotherhood, and even 
to call on the generals to keep power until new elections for 
Parliament can be held. 
EFTA_R1_022071 41 
EFTA02722352

In trying to ease the Islamists' grip on government, liberals have 
also been accused of being content to subvert the will of 
Egyptians, who voted a majority of Islamists into Parliament. 
And despite the Brotherhood's repeated successes at the ballot 
box, some have continued to implicate the United States. 
Youssef Sidhom, who attended the round-table afternoon 
meeting with Mrs. Clinton at the American Embassy here, said 
some of the discomfort was rooted in the timing of American 
statements on Egypt, which seemed to "bless democracy" just as 
Islamists were winning. 
"She kept repeating and assuring us that she has no intention to 
take sides," said Mr. Sidhom, who edits a newspaper that deals 
with Coptic concerns. He said that Mrs. Clinton, noting the 
Brotherhood's political skills, spoke to the Christian leaders 
about becoming a more organized political force. 
A senior State Department official, speaking of meetings on 
Sunday with entrepreneurs, women's groups and Christian 
leaders, said Mrs. Clinton was trying "to make absolutely clear 
where we stand on this political transition, which is that we 
support a full transition to civilian democratic rule and a 
constitution that protects the human rights and freedoms of all 
Egyptians." 
In Egypt's current muddled politics, though, those goals are 
hard to reconcile. Revolutionary groups and human rights 
activists have warned that continued involvement by the 
military, which many people here accuse of staging a de facto 
coup, would undermine the Constitution's legitimacy. But 
others, including Christian leaders Mrs. Clinton met with on 
EFTA_R1_02207142 
EFTA02722353

Sunday, see the military as the only guarantor of a constitution 
that protects minority rights. 
"She can say what she wants concerning the issue," said Emad 
Gad, a former member of Parliament who said he had refused to 
attend the meeting with Mrs. Clinton. 
"We are living in an unstable period. If the SCAF goes back to 
its barracks," he said, referring to the military council by its 
initials, "the Brotherhood will control everything." 
Mr. Gad added: "It's an Egyptian issue. It's not for the secretary 
of state."

Obama Lets the U.N. Tie His Hands 
on Syria 
Douglas J. Feith 
July 15, 2012 -- To retain power in the face of a popular revolt, 
Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has killed nearly 15,000 
civilians. From a humanitarian point of view, this is a crisis. 
From a national-interest point of view, it is an opportunity to 
undermine enemies of the United States in both Damascus and 
E FTA_R 1 _02207 1 4 3 
EFTA02722354

Tehran. But President Obama has treated the bloody turmoil, 
first and foremost, as an opportunity to strengthen the idea that 
America should subject itself to the United Nations Security 
Council. 
In the 16 months since the revolt began, the Obama 
administration has neither promoted humanitarian "safe zones" 
on Syria's Turkish border, nor provided arms to the rebels. It has 
not helped establish a no-fly zone, nor has it supported NATO 
military strikes against Assad's forces. 
At first, Mr. Obama vainly called for Assad to behave humanely. 
Eventually, he vainly exhorted Assad to relinquish power. 
All the while, Mr. Obama has looked to the U.N. for answers. 
The latest: Secretary of State Hillary Clinton worked with the 
five permanent Security Council members and U.N. envoy Kofi 
Annan on a June 30 accord calling for Syrians to devise a 
political transition for their own country—and strangely 
suggesting that Assad's regime may cooperate in the effort. 
The accord's vacuity is a sign of the support Assad enjoys from 
Russia and China, each of which has a veto on the Security 
Council. Obama administration officials complain about that 
support, but Russian President Vladimir Putin shrugs them off. 
Why is Russia able to shield Assad, harm the Syrian people, and 
frustrate U.S. diplomacy? Because Mr. Obama has made the 
Security Council the focus of U.S. policy on Syria. This was not 
inevitable, nor was it necessary. 
Asked why they have not done more against the Syrian despot, 
Obama administration officials talk resignedly about the need 
EFTA_R1_02207144 
EFTA02722355

for multinational approval. "We need to have a clear legal basis 
for any action we take," Defense Secretary Leon Panetta testified 
to the Senate in March. "Our goal would be to seek international 
permission." U.S. Ambassador to NATO No Daalder told a 
British audience in May that NATO lacked "clear regional 
support" and "a sound legal basis" to act in Syria. The legal 
justification, he noted, would "most likely" have to be a Security 
Council resolution. 
This legalism is both bad law and bad policy. The Security 
Council is not a judicial forum. The U.N. Charter gives the 
Security Council the power to make "decisions" (special 
resolutions that U.N. countries are committed "to accept and 
carry out"), but it is precisely such mandatory resolutions that 
are subject to veto by any of the five permanent Security 
Council members. The council can be a source of useful 
diplomatic support and of legislative-type authority, but the 
charter does not say that council approval is a prerequisite in all 
cases for a country's military or other action abroad. Especially 
murky is how the charter should govern humanitarian 
interventions. 
History shows that the Security Council is no touchstone of 
international legality. President John Kennedy "quarantined" 
Cuba during the 1962 missile crisis without any permission from 
the Security Council. Likewise without such permission, 
President Bill Clinton helped lead NATO's bombing campaign 
to defend Se
