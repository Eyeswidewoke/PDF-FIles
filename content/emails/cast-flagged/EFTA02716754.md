On Tuesday the Senate Intelligence Committee rel=ased the highly anticipated 500-page summary of its report on the 
CIA's <=>post-9/11 torture program, providing a sobering glimpse into one of the darke=t chapters in the U.S. 
government's history. In the report, a product of a 5=year investigation, Senate investigators reveal sordid details of the 
systemic a=d individual failures by the agency personnel who ran the "enhanced i=terrogation program" -- the 
government's euphemism for systematic torture -- during the George W. Bush administratio=. The program involved 
capturing terrorism suspects and shipping them to secret overseas prisons, where they were subjected to techniques 
such as waterboarding. 
The CIA's program has long bee= criticized as un-American and a chilling departure from the nation's values. Opponents 
alle=e that it resulted in gross abuses and inhumane treatment of detainees, some of whom =ere eventually revealed 
not to have been involved in terror organizations:0=A° The 6,300-page report may be the most unsanitized official 
accou=t to date of the agency's program, which the Senate investigators say was misman=ged, poorly conducted and 
characterized by abuses far more widespread than the CIA previously conveyed to lawmakers. The newly released 
EFTA_R1_02157300 
EFTA02716754

document tears apart the CIA's past claims that only a s=all number of detainees were subjected to the harsh 
interrogation techniques.=C240 
But Senate investigators found that the CIA had actually kept 119 detainees in custody= 26 of whom were illegally held. 
And despite CIA insistence that the program was limited in scope, Senate investigators conclude that the use of torture 
was much more widespread than previ=usly thought. 
The study reveals several gruesome instances of torture by mid-level CIA officers who participated in the program, 
including threats o= sexual violence using a broomstick and the use of "rectal hydration=quot; in instances of harsh 
interrogations that lasted for days or weeks on end. And, contrary to the agency'=s prior insistence that only three 
detainees were subject to waterboarding, the Senate =eport suggests it was likely used on more detainees. The report 
cites the p=esence of materials typically used for waterboarding being present at certain =i>"blacksites," or secret 
prisons, where the agency had previously said waterboarding was not used.q=pan> 
Rather =han wrestling with the morality of the agency's torture program or the operation's damaging effect on the 
U.S.'=international credibility, Senate investigators instead weighed whether the agency's =attics were effective. 
Through narrative examinations of 20 separate detainee cases, the panel attempted to make the case that the use of 
harsh interrogation techniques such as waterboarding d=d not yield valuable intelligence. "The committee reviewed 20 
o= the most frequent and prominent examples of purported counterterrorism 'successe=' that the CIA has attributed to 
the use of its enhanced interrogation techniques,=quot; Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), chair of the intelligence panel, 
said in = statement Tuesday. "Each of those examples was found to be wrong in fundamental respects." 
<=yan style="font-size:12ptline-height:107%;font-family:Georgia,serir> 
In some instances, the study find=, the information acquired proved irrelevant to stopping terror threats. In others, the 
use of the techniques resulted in detainees providing fabricated or inaccurate information, and in still other cases, the 
information obtained through interrogating the detainees had already been acquired through other techniq=es. Given 
that the techniques were ineffective, the study says, the agency routinely misled Congress and the White House wh=n it 
claimed that the use of torture did in fact contribute to intelligence victories. For instance, the Senate report pushes 
back against the CIA's argument that torture provided the information about Osama bin Laden's courier that helped the 
U.S. kill t=e al Qaeda leader in 2011. In a 10-page discussion on the subject, Senate investigators say the information that 
led the U.S. to bin Laden was obtain=d from a detainee while he was in foreign custody, prior to being subjected t= 
torture. 
The CIA, however, refutes these conclusions. In a roughly 100-page official response released alongside the intelligence 
panel4o=99s summary, the agency contends that harsh interrogation techniques were effective.=C240 "The sum total of 
information provided from detainees in CIA custody substantial=y advanced the Agency's strategic and tactical 
understanding of the e=emy in ways that continue to inform counterterrorism efforts to this day," the agency said in its 
rebuttal. The response argues that it's not clear whether the valuable information co=ld have been acquired by means 
2 
EFTA_R1_02157301 
EFTA02716755

other than harsh interrogation techniques, although =he agency concedes that it's possible. "It is impossible =o imagine 
how CIA could have achieved the same results in terms of disrupting plots, capturing othe= terrorists, and degrading al-
Qa'ida without any information from de=ainees, but it is unknowable whether, without enhanced interrogation 
techniques, CIA or non-CIA interrogators could have acquired the same information from those detainees," the rebuttal 
said. 
Still, the CIA is not advocating a return=to the use of torture during interrogations. Rather, it is most concerned with 
defe=ding itself against charges that it misled Congress and the White House about th= extent and value of the program. 
The official response vehemently cha=lenges the Senate's allegation that the spies acted outside the limits of what=the 
White House had allowed the agency to do. The agency has said that th= enhanced interrogations were part of a 
government-approved program carried out under express orders from within the Bush administration. 
<= class="MsoNormal">"The image portrayed in the Study of an organization that — on an institutional scale—
intentionally=misled and routinely resisted oversight from the White House, the Congress, the Department of Justice, 
and its own OIG simply does not comport with the record," =he agency's response said. 
Among the Senate report's 20 main conclusions are tha= the CIA misled Congress, the White House and the Department 
of Justice, that the ag=ncy ignored internal critiques of the program, and that the CIA's use of th= techniques went far 
beyond the legal authority bestowed upon it by the Bush White House. In a statement Tuesday, President Barack Obama 
said, "=he report documents a troubling program involving enhanced interrogation techniques on terrorism suspects i= 
secret facilities outside the United States, and it reinforces my long-held view that these harsh methods were not only 
inconsistent with our values as nation, they did not serve our broader counterterrorism efforts or our nati=nal security 
interests." "That is why I will continue to use my autho=ity as President to make sure we never resort to those methods 
again," Obama added. 
"In carryi=g out that program, we did not always live up to the high standards that we set for ourselves and that the 
American people expec= of us," CIA Director John Brennan said Tuesday in his official respon=e. "As an Agency, we have 
learned from these mistakes, which is why my predecessors and I have implemented various remedial measures over 
the years to address institutional deficiencies.&quo=; 
The agency says it has no intention of revamping the current version of its interrogation program, which was curbed as a 
result of directives from Obama. "It is Director Brennan's resolute intention to ensure that Agency officer= scrupulously 
adhere to these directives, which the Director fully supports," the statement continued. "CIA has owned up to these 
mistakes, learned from them, and taken numerous corrective actions over the years. Further improvements to CIA 
practices continue to be made today as a result of our review of the SSCI Study," the agency's response=noted, referring 
to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, the intelligence panel's full name. 
The document's release marks the conclusion of an =xplosive, high-stakes feud that played out between the White 
House's chief sp=ing agency and its powerful Senate overseers about how much of the report to release publicly. The

feud revolved around the executive branch's insistence that the committee redact the pseudonyms =sed to identify the 
mid-level CIA officers involved in the program. Despite = month's long fight, Feinstein was ultimately forced to relent 
and allow the pseudonyms to remain blacked out =n order to get her study's summary out the door before the panel's
