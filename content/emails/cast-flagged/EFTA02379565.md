=Will Crouch is Assistant Director and Head of Research at the=Uehiro Centre for Practical Ethics at Oxford 
University. He writes in res=onse to the Financial Times' article "Donors give=vaccine fund $4.3bn boost." 
• 
=The Financial Times has rightly flagged up the debate=about whether this is the best use of their funds because of 
the high pri=e that GAVI pays for vaccinations, and the problems GAVI faces with imple=enting its immunization 
programs. 
• 
=But it's important that "cost-effectiveness=E2 is properly understood. The UK's Department for Internat=onal 
Development refers to "value for money" when describ=ng its priorities. But it doesn't have a sensible metric for 
what=counts as "value." 
• 
=But health economists do: namely, the Disability Adjusted Lif= Year, or DALY. This represents one lost year of 
healthy life: averting=one DALY is equivalent in value to giving one person one year of life at=very high quality health. 
• 
=Research using this metric shows that what we should be most=concerned about is not whether the GAVI gets a 
good price for its vaccine=, but whether immunization is the right program to fund at all. By fundin= the rotavirus and 
pneumococcal vaccines, it is paying $100 for every DAL= averted. This is a very good deal compared with many other 
uses of the=money, but surprisingly we can do much better again. </=PAN>

• 
=A whole range of commodity markets have spent the last six months flirting with multiyear hig=s. One reason is 
the surging demand in emerging economies such as China=and India. Worse, a jump in the cost of food=is a matter of 
life and death for the world's lbn chronica=ly hungry. 
• 
=On Tuesday, Nicolas Sarkozy set out a three-pronged approach:=boosting production; increasing transparency in 
commodities derivatives=markets by standardizing contracts and forcing more deals on to exchanges=(most are 
currently bilateral); and setting a minimum amount of collatera= that parties must post when they enter into a 
derivatives transaction. 
• 
=Reforming derivatives markets should not be a cover for a cru=ade on non-physical trading. It would be impossible 
— and undesir=ble — to completely reverse the "financialization =9D of commodities markets which Mr Sarkozy so 
abhors. <=SPAN>

-In food markets, for example, it is useful to smooth over the-period of a year prices that would otherwise swing 
wildly either side of=a harvest. The liquidity provided by numerous non-physical traders makes=this easier.
