DRAFT STATEMENT 
The allegations made against me bee 
lies. I have consistently stated that they are untrue and I have 
waited for an o ortunity to prove this in a court of law. 
or has she ever sworn to the truth of the allegations she makes. She is engaged in a campaign of 
media harassment with the objective of selling her memoirs to the highest bidder. The salacious claims she makes are 
untrue and made purely for financial gain. 
The relentless media harassment to which I, Alan Dershowitz and Prince Andrew have been subjected to over the last 
week has become intolerable and breaches any justifiable sense of natural justice. I am therefore left with no choice but 
to refer both the harassment and the unfair and untrue allegations to the press complaints commission with immediate 
effect. 
I have never been engaged in any sexual conduct, as is alleged by 
have never abused anyone, let 
alone a child and I find such conduct repugnant. I find the allegations offensive and deeply hurtful . 
I nie
Nhen she was working at the Mar-A-Largo Country Club. I understood that she was at least 18 
and was a masseuse not least because of her talking about her 67 year old girlfriend. Mr Epstein was at that time 
looking for a part-time masseuse. I asked if she would be interested in a 
l in for the job and she was. She 
subsequently came to Mr Epstein's house with her mother and brother. 
was interviewed by Mr Epstein. I 
was not present as I remained with her mother chatting until the interview concluded. 
I did not go upstairs wit
l did not take my clothes off and her allegations are a tissue of lies. I have 
ver asked anyone to have sex with Mr Epstein and have never ever witnessed anyone having sex with him. 
had an interview with Mr Epstein and then left with her mother. Nothing untoward happened. 
Thereafter I do not recall seeing 
or a considerable period of time after that. I did not always 
accompany Mr Epstein when he travelled which was usually to do with his work. When I was in Palm Beach he was 
often not there. 
In 1999 
began to travel with Mr Epstein as his masseuse. I had no dealings with 
as she 
was employed by Mr Epstein. I saw her from time to time and at no time did she ever make any allegation or suggestion 
of any sexual contact between her and Mr Epstein. 
In 2001 I was in London when 
met a number of friends of mine including Prince Andrew. A photograph 
was taken as I ima ine she wanted to show it to friends and family. 
I never asked 
o give him a massage. 
Mr Epstein was arrested about two years after I stopped working for him. I do not know the truth of what went on. I 
have not seen US proceedings and the depositions which are referred to the in the press. All I can say is that I was not 
aware of any improper conduct with minors. 
When Mr Epstein pleaded guilty, he stated that he would compensate any of his victims. This led to Scott Rothstein, an 
infamous US Attorne now disbarred and serving 50 years in jail) creating false claims against Mr Epstein — this is fad. 
Brad Edward 
lawyer, worked in Scott Rothstein's firm. 
I am not going to engage in trial by media. 
I will now report this matter to the press regulator as numerous offensive and untrue stories have been published about 
me without any prior warnin . It seems that each week passes the allegations become ever more extreme and to date 
the press have failed to hold 
and her advisors to account and I call upon them to do so. 
claims to have had sexual relations with many unnamed prominent business leaders, politicians and 
others. I believe these stories are also false and I call upon 
to name the people and provide evidence 
that can be tested in a court of law.

It is deeply regrettable that Mr Epstein abused minors but that does not give 
.he right to make 
accusations against people who knew Jeffrey Epstein but had no knowledge of his crimes such as Alan Dershowitz and 
Prince Andrew both of whom deny the allegations made against them. 
Finally 
claims she was a sex slave for the rich and famous, however the reality is that
