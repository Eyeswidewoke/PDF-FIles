Hi Andrew 
Further details on our last conversation. Do you currently have a corp that you 
would use for the acquisition? , or would you want to form a new Ilc, if the going public option is viable, 
maybe a corp makes more sense. ( all the normal add- ons anti) dilution,tag along drag along etc ) - If 
you want to buy other agencies for paper , a higher valuation may be in our interest. , otherwise you 
might consider assuming debt ( lc and irs ) and putting up smaller amount of cash. 1.S-2m. With the 
economic crisis not yet in its springtime. there are many things to buy. 
I shall be back in NY on Thursday and will speak with Megane. I don't know 
her enough to do it on the phone 
Take care 
Jean luc
