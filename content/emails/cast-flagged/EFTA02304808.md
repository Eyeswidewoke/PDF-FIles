Not really NY style, but if he wants to use them, I guess we can try and match furniture On Apr 4, 2012, at 6:04 PM Great thanks On Wed, Apr 4, 2012 at 11:43 AM, wrote: <mailto wrote: > > The 3 apts are all one bedrooms. One isMis apt which shes moving out all the stuff in there by mid May, and the other 2 are the 2 offices. Looks like he will be getting an office now in NY. None are furnished, thus need everything. I have my old couch I can use in one of them and a possible arm chair. I'd rather not furnish then mix and match style. Would like to start fresh and do them right.
