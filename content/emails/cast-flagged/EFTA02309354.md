I'm hoping i= Penn's is less than this, JE will be OK with us going with him. I think it=s alot easier for all involved to use Penn, and we just have to convince JE=that as long as we have all materials, etc, he can finish in 2 weeks. (that=s the time frame Penn gave me). Also the tiles I'm ordering for 8H are quit= large, 12"x35" so he said that will be alot faster to install. > I'm having all the materials delivered on Tuesday to the building, they sa=d curbside delivery. It will be the wall and floor tiles, grout, toilet, va=ity, sink fixture and shower fixtures. (still looking for actual sink top, m=d cabinet and towel bar). How should they proceed with delivering the items=if they only deliver curbside? Is there someone who can help bring all the i=ems up to the apt? We will have our painter in the building as well who can=help. > On Jun 1, 2012, at 11:51 AM, Anthony Barrett wrote: » Did you meet? » On Jun 1, 2012, at 9:24 AM, Wrote: >» He just responded.

I'm getting quotes from contractors to do 8H bathroom and asked h=m for a quote, but haven't heard back yet.
