**[TITLE]:** nt shutdown as politic=lly unwise. The federal 2013 fiscal y=ar ends Sept. 30. New money must be appropriated by then to avoid a shutdo=n of countless government offices and agencies. Voters chiefly blamed con=ressional Republicans for the mid-1990s shutdowns, and the fallout boosted=Democratic President Clinton. Ever since, many establishment Republicans have urged the party to avoid using shutdown threats as a barg=ining tool. But a new generation of t=a-party-backed conservatives rejects the advice. They say "Obamacare" =97 officially the Affordable Care Act — is so unpopular and unworkable

Nuclear Operator Raises Alarm on Crisis <http://www.nyt=mes.com/2013/08/24/world/asia/nuclear-operator-raises-
alarm-on-crisis.htmla 
Hiroko Tabuchi — New York Times 
The operator of Japan's=tsunami-hit nuclear power plant sounded the alarm on the gravity of the de=pening crisis of 
containment at the coastal site on Friday, saying that there are more than 200,000 tons of radioactive water in 
makes=ift tanks vulnerable to leaks, with no reliable way to check on them or an=where to transfer the water.

The latest disclosures ad= to a long list of recent accidents, leaks and breakdowns that have unders=ored grave 
vulnerabilities at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant site more than two years after a powerful earthquake and 
tsuna=i set off meltdowns at three reactors. 
They come two weeks after=the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, promised that his government would take a =ore active role 
in the site's cleanup, raising questions over how seriously he has taken that pledge. Mr. Abe's government has co=tinued 
to push for a restart of the country's nuclear power program, and=he heads to the Middle East on Saturday to promote 
Japanese exports to the=region, including nuclear technology. 
Mr. Abe also plans to lea= Tokyo's delegation to Argentina for the International Olympic Committee=92s final vote, set 
for Sept. 7, on the host city for the 2020 Olympics. Tokyo, 150 miles south of the stricken nuclear power plant, is ore of 
three finalists competing to host the games. The others are Istanbul =nd Madrid. 
Opposition lawmakers here=have demanded that Mr. Abe stay home and declare a state of emergency. 
"The nuclear crisis is =eal and ongoing, yet the government continues to look the other way," sa=d Yoshiko Kira of the 
opposition Japan Communist Party, which made significant gains in parliamentary elections last month. 
"The government should =eclare a state of emergency right now, and intervene to stop the outflow o= contaminated 
water," Ms. Kira said at an anti-nuclear rally outside Mr. Abe's office in Tokyo. 
Mr. Abe remains popular, =nd it is uncertain how large a liability the crisis at the Fukushima plant=will become for him. 
But it has become increas=ngly clear that the latest problems may be too large for the plant's ope=ator, the Tokyo 
Electric Power Company, or Tepco, to handle. 
Tepco has built nearly 1,=00 tanks at the sprawling complex to store as many as 335,000 tons of cont=minated water, 
the product of coolant pumped into the reactors to keep their cores from overheating, and groundwater pouring into 
their b=eached basements at a rate of 400 tons a day. This week, Tepco said one ta=k had sprung a huge leak. 
On Friday, Tepco presente= an even starker view of the situation, acknowledging that as much as 220,=00 tons of that 
water is stored in makeshift steel tanks similar to the one that is leaking. The operator said the 36-foot-tall cyl=ndrical 
tanks, meant as a temporary repository for the growing amount of r=diated water at the complex, used vulnerable 
rubber sealing and that their=ability to withstand radiation was not tested.

EFTA02574052

The tanks are susceptible=to leaks at the seams and through their concrete base, said Noriyuki Imaiz=mi, the acting 
general manager of Tepco's nuclear power division. A nearby drain can carry any leaked water to the sea, Mr. Imaizumi 
said, a=d high radiation readings along a section suggest that water has already t=aveled through the drain to the ocean. 
The makeshift tanks also =ack water level gauges, making it difficult to detect leaks. Only two work=rs are assigned to 
checking nearly 1,000 tanks on two-hour patrols twice a day, Mr. Imaizumi said. 
The Nuclear Regulation Au=hority, which the Japanese government ordered to more actively advise and =onitor Tepco's 
activities at the plant, had told the company to begin transferring the water from the makeshift tanks to better-built 
v=ssels. But after visiting the plant on Friday, an authority commissioner, =oyoshi Fuketa, said the vast quantities made 
doing so quickly "unrealist=c." 
A series of pits Tepco du= to store some of the water also began leaking earlier this year, forcing =orkers to transfer the 
water into the steel tanks. 
Experts have said they su=pect that more contaminated water is seeping out from under the melted-dow= reactors into 
the groundwater and the Pacific. Elevated levels of radioactive cesium in surrounding waters seem to confirm those 
s=spicions. 
Tepco has said those leak= are not directly from beneath the reactors, but from maintenance tunnels =hat run along the 
coast and remain contaminated from the early days of the disaster. 
But it also acknowledges =hat the water beneath the reactors is extremely contaminated, and experts =ay that if it does 
get into the ocean, it will surpass even the leaks that occurred in the disaster's early days. 
"That prospect scares m.," Michio Aoyama, a senior scientist in the Oceanography and Geochemistr= Research 
Department at the government-affiliated Meteorological Research Institute, said in an interview this month. 
"It's the ultimate, w=rst-case scenario," Professor Aoyama said.

The New Nuclear C=aze <http://opinion=tor.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/08/23/the-new-nuclear-crazek 
Mark Bittman - New York Times 
There is a new discussion=about nuclear energy, prompted by well-founded concerns about carbon emiss=ons and 
fueled by a pro-nuclear documentary called "Pandora's Promise." Add a statement by James E. Hansen — who famously 
sounded th= alarm on climate change — and, of course, industry propaganda, and pres=o: We Love Nukes. 
Before we all become pro-=uclear greens, however, you've got to ask three questions: Is
