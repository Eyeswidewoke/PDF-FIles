| **CC** | Andrew Lasso http://www.Ig.com/us/washer-dryer-combosfig-WM3455HS-washer-dryer-combo I was going to change out my dishwasher for the above all in one washer =ryer. I was also going to put one in 8H to replace the dishwasher. Do you see any reason it won't work? Just want to make sure before I =chedule it to be delivered and installed. Also, Andrew, if you can pls let me know when the fridge can be =elivered for 8H; if the cabinet above the existing refrigerator has =een taken down so the 75" tall one will fit. I'd like to get the new appliances installed in 8H before the apt gets =ainted.
