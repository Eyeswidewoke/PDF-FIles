| **From** | Steve Busby Sent Fri 6/23/2017 4:31:33 PM Subject June 29 Event for Steve Obsitnik Dear Friends, On Thursday, June 29, Nicole and I are co-hosting a cocktail party at the Country Club of New Canaan for our friend Steve Obsitnik, who is considering a run for Governor of Connecticut. As you know, our state is in serious economic trouble - some would even characterize it as a financial crisis. At this critical time, we believe we need an experienced business executive with sound judgment to lead the turnaround of our state. Steve offers these credentials, as a successful business owner and experienced executive. Steve has a plan to fix the state's financial problems, including its grossly underfunded pensions. He has the passion to turn Connecticut into a job creator rather than a job exporter and the compassion to create a government that supports all its citizens in an efficient and effective way. There is no cost to attend and of course beverages will be served. Please look for a Paperless Post invitation with the details and consider attending or stopping by to meet Steve and hear his message. We hope to see you there! Thank you!
