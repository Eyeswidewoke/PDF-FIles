I need to=make white sweat pants for Jeffrey and need to find some fabric in the garm=nt district. Maybe you could check out some places and get samples of white=fleece, sweatpants material or white terry cloth? I've been to Mood and the= didn't really have anything. Maybe you could check other places? B&J Fabri=s at 525 7th Ave might be a good place to check.
