| **Subject** | Re: Bin<=r> Dear Marc,=div> I am presently in London, though leaving this afternoon f=r Paris. I assume that both parties are keen to maintain a degree of s=crecy about ultimate ownership of their trusts. Indeed that is why these tr=sts were created In the first place. However= as we both know, the ONLY criteria that matters under law is that the fund= are "clean" and free of any tax obligations. There is no r=quirement for ultimate ownership to be given on either side. My suggestion i= they don't push for this and remain satisfied with what they have.=/div> By all means feel free to call, as I won't=be back in Morocco until after Easter. As ever, Mark Sent fr=m my iPad On 12 Apr 2019, at 09:20, Marc.Kensingt= Good morning Mark, I hope you are doing well. Please read the last Karyna's email. I can't s=ow this really message to the vendor. It seems really that the buyer is afr=id to send the name of the economical beneficiary of Haze Trust.
