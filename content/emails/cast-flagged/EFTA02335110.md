| **Subject** | Re: Eres un de <html> I am replying to you. I have been out. + you sent 2 of I am a disaster e mails. Not only am I going to have to spank you very very hard when I next see you, but I will have to do something even more vile. I am seriously thinking. Regarding my good friends in London - my best friend is in Dubai and not back until Wed and I really want to make sure that next time I introduce you to someone that it is done in a proper and respectful manner. I would be very upset if there was a repetition of Monza. I am sorry that I did not get your e mail, or at least register that you were going to London. Blame Jeffrey my favorite punching bagl<br> Kisses<br> <br> Gx<br> <br> At 11:24 AM 10/14/2002 -0400, you wrote:<br> <blockquote type=cite class=cite cite>tu eres un desastre.
