1. I am in receipt of the document you sent as=AO well as the email that you proposed that Bill send out. 
2. Can you confirm Bill's invitation to me =on August 8th. I will need the details. time place etc. 
3. Bill has previously sent an email to me aut=orizing you to talk about employment issues„ I would like a 
broader a=thorization as some of the issues at hand you have previously des=ribed as outside of Boris's employment. . 
I would appreciate an email or call from Bill acknowledging his full u=derstanding . 
some simple preliminary housekeeping items fir=t; 
I thought there was to be deal points before documen= drafting but... 
1.Shouldn't most covenants be mutual, 
Me=inda and Bill signing . . . 
2. The new severance payment in the agreeme=t has been reduced to only one year? is that Bills and 
Melinda'= new position? 
3, I assume Bill is aware that Boris would be =equired to keep some emails to sustain his tax position , ( I will 
disc=ss directly with Bill ) 
4 the document you sent , makes no mention =f the already existing agreement with re Boris's investment 
overrid= 
S. the document changes "at will" to an=ther type of employment, ( why ?). , 
6. it makes no mention of Bills commitment to =elp Boris find another position. 
7 If Melinda wants a divorce , how does Boris =rotect himself. 
8 documents that s=pport your authorization to sign on behalf of bg3. , manager binding= if that is the 
eventual position. 
I cannot stress enough that Boris is emotionally ver= fragile.very ! I mentioned this in both of our telephone 
calls. =Can Bill send him an email or something that calms him.?
