The=unspoken rule practiced in the geisha world of not allowing non- introduced=customers. A person may come as a guest of a known customer, but he has to=have a proper introduction and in effect prove himself before being allowe= access on his own. There are several reasons for this rule. One is that t=ere can be a long gap between the time of a visit to a teahouse and the ti=e the bill is submitted. Both sides must know and trust one another that t=e bill is fair and that the payment will be made. Another reason is that t=e geisha and the mother of the teahouse feel that the service they provide=is totally personalized to the guest. One cannot provide the proper level =f service to a stranger. It is probably also true that the women feel safe= in only dealing with known customers.
