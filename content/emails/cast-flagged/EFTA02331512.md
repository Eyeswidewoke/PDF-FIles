| **Subject** | furniture at 66th Hi ladies, Eva took almost everything last time , but there wer= 2 items that she couldn't fit - a large mirror and a carpet.&=bsp; Steven (our drive who went with her last time) could come pick =hem up late morning on Friday. Would that be a convenient time for him to come? If you feel you don't need to be there (=ike last time) he could just go up and get the stuff. Just let me kn=w what you are most comfortable with. Thanks. Kim 1 EFTA_R1_01264731 EFTA02331512 |
