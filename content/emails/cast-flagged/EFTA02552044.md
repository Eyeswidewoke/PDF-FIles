RE: Introduction 
Hi Nina,<=:p> 
</=> 
My role with regard to Ivory Coast was actual=y at Geneva Global, the consulting firm where I still work. Up until 
about=1.8 months ago, I managed a PEPFAR grant that Geneva Global administered in=Cdl. I'm now seconded to the 
Gates Foundation (though still employed=by Geneva Global), and working on private donor engagement (partnering 
wit= other private donors who want to support foundation priorities). 
We actually don't have anyone at the foundatio= who is on point for Ivory Coast. Instead, program officers are 
responsibl= for the various strategies that support foundation priorities (ie, polio,=malaria, TB, US secondary education, 
etc...). If you go to the website= www.gatesfoundation.org <http://www.gatesfoundation.org> , a=d click on "topics" at 
the right, you will see all of the foun=ation's strategies. This is a very useful starting point, as these a=e the only areas 
that the foundation currently funds. Then, if you see a t=pic that is of particular interest, you can click on it to read 
further ab=ut what the foundation is currently supporting. You'll notice that a=lot of the funding is weighted toward 
research and development, as this is=a particular interest of Bill and Melinda, and they believe that this is a= area where 
the foundation can have a unique impact. 
So, my advice would be for Mr. Tanoh to start there and the= to let me know if there is a particular interest, and I can 
look for the =ight point person for an introduction, but it's very much based on t=e specific topic, as program officers 
work on a strategy-basis rather than=a geography-basis. Feel free to pass this email along to him.4=pan> 
Hope that is helpful! 
All=the best, 
Jenna

Thank you Jeffrey!

Dear Miss Brereton, 
I was =eferred to you by Jeffrey Epstein who told me you were in charge of the Iv=ry Coast at the Gates Foundation. 
I recently spoke with Mr. Marcel =mon Tanoh, Minister and Chief of Staff of the Presidence of Ivory Coast, a=d he is very 
interested in discussing opportunities for the Gates Fou=dation to fund health and education initiatives in the Ivory 
Coa=t. 
Jeffrey mentioned that you were the best point person and I woul= like to know if I could share your contact information 
with Mr. Tanoh so =hat he can reach out to you directly? 
Please=let me know if that would be appropriate.
