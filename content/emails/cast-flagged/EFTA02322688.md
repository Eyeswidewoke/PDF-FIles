I like the ones with the more modern arms, like the shelter and the track arm. Also I like that we know we can get it in the same linen as the bed.

If you choose the couch in the "stock" color, then it could be in stock and ready to ship. chttp://www.crateandbarrel.com/furniture/sleeper-sofas/1> http://www.crateandbarrel.com/furniture/sleeper-sofas/1 The willow queen sleeper is in stock in white and ready to ship, FYI.. If you wanted another color option, we could always order the couch in white(if you like this couch) and then order another slip cover in a different color and switch it out when the slip cover arrives. At least we could have the couch on island much sooner than any others.
