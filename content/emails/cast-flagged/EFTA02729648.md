IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIFTEENTH JUDICIAL CIRCUIT 
IN AND FOR PALM BEACH COUNTY, FLORIDA 
CRIMINAL DIVISION 
STATE OF FLORIDA 
vs. 
Case Nos.: 2006-CF9454-AXX & 
2008-938ICF-AX X 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN 
PALM BEACH POST'S MOTION TO INTERVENE 
AND PETITION FOR ACCESS 
Palm Beach Newspapers, Inc., d/bla The Palm Beach Post (the "Post") moves to 
intervene in this action for the limited purpose of seeking access to documents filed under seal. 
The documents relate directly to the Defendant's guilty plea and sentence. Thus, the sealed 
documents go to the heart of the disposition of this case. But in requesting that Judge Pucillo 
seal these documents, the parties failed to comply with Florida's strict procedural and substantive 
requirements for sealing judicial records. In addition, continued sealing of these documents is 
pointless, because these documents have been discussed repeatedly in open court records. For all 
of these reasons, the documents must be unsealed. As grounds for this Motion, the Post states: 
1. 
The Post is a daily newspaper that has covered this matter and related 
proceedings. In an effort to inform its readers concerning these matters, the Post relies upon 
(among other things) law enforcement records and judicial records. 
2. 
As a member of the news media, the Post has a right to intervene in criminal 
proceedings for the limited purpose of seeking access to proceedings and records. See Barron v. 
Florida Freedom Newspapers, Inc., 531 So. 2d 113, 118 (Fla. 1988) (news media have standing 
to challenge any closure order); Miami Herald Publ'a Co. v. Lewis, 426 So. 2d I, 7 (Fla. 1982) 
(news media must be given an opportunity to be heard on question of closure).

3. 
The particular documents under seal in this case are a non-prosecution agreement 
that was docketed on July 2, 2008, and an addendum docketed on August 25, 2008. Together, 
these documents apparently restrict any federal prosecution of the Defendant for offenses related 
to the conduct to which he pleaded guilty in this case. Judge Pucillo accepted the agreement for 
filing during a bench conference on June 30, 2008. The agreement, Judge Pucillo found, was "a 
significant inducement in accepting this plea." Such agreements and related documents typically 
are public record. Sec QrggsmianimbliakingCa.tUnitesLaSiairaDistria Court, 920 F.2d 1462, 
1465 (9th Cir. 199O) ("plea agreements have typically been open to the public"). I Inked States v 
Kooislca, 796 F.3d 1390, 1390-91 (11th Cir. 1986) (documents relating to defendant's change of 
plea and sentencing could be sealed only upon finding of a compelling interest that justified 
denial of public access). 
4. 
The Florida Constitution provides that judicial branch records generally must be 
open for public inspection. See Art. I, § 24(a), Fla. Const. Closure of such records is allowed 
only under narrow circumstances, such as to "prevent a serious and imminent threat to the fair, 
impartial and orderly administration ofjustice," or to protect a compelling governmental interest. 
See Fla. R. Jud. Admin. 2.420(cX9)(A). Additionally, closure must be effective and no broader 
than necessary to accomplish the desired purpose, and is lawful only if no less restrictive 
measures will accomplish that purpose. See Fla. R. Jud. Admin. 2. 420(c)(9)(B) & (C); Lewis,
426 So. 2d at 3. 
5. 
In this case, the non-prosecution agreement and, later, the addendum were sealed 
without any of the requisite findings. Rather, it appears from the record, the documents were 
scaled merely because the Defendant's counsel represented to Judge Pucillo that the non-
prosecution agreement "is a confidential document." See Plea Conference Transcript page 38

(June 30, 2008). Such a representation falls well short of demonstrating a compelling interest, a 
genuine necessity, narrow tailoring, and that no less restrictive measures will suffice. 
Consequently, the sealing was improper and ought to be set aside. 
6. 
In addition, at this time good cause exists for unsealing the documents because of 
their public significance. Since the Defendant pleaded guilty to soliciting a minor for 
prostitution, he has been named in at least 12 civil lawsuits that — like the charges in this case — 
allege he brought and paid teenage girls to come his home for sex and/or "massages."' At least 
I I cases are pending. In another lawsuit, one of the Defendant's accusers has alleged that 
federal prosecutors failed to consult with her regarding the disposition of possible charges 
against the Defendant.2 State prosecutors also have been criticized: The Palm Beach Police 
Chief has faulted the State Attorney's handing of these cases as "highly unusual" and called for 
the State Attorney's disqualification. Consequently, this case — and particularly the Defendant's 
agreements with prosecutors - are of considerable public interest and concern. 
7. 
The Defendant's non-prosecution agreement with federal prosecutors also was 
important to Judge Pucillo. As she noted in the June 2008 plea conference, "1 would view [the 
non-prosecution agreement] as a significant inducement in accepting this plea." See Plea 
Conference Transcript page 39. Florida law recognizes a strong public right of access to 
documents a court considers in connection with sentencing. Sec Sarasota Herald Tribune, Div.

of the New York Times Co. v. Holtzendorf, 507 So. 2d 667, 668 (Fla. 2d DCA 1987) ("While a 
judge may impose whatever legal sentence he chooses, if such sentence is based on a tangible 
proceeding or document, it is within the public domain unless otherwise privileged."). In this 
case, no interest justifies continued sealing of these "significant" documents that Judge Pucillo 
considered in accepting the plea and sentencing the Defendant. The lack of any such 
compelling interest —as well as the parties' failure to comply with the standards for sealing 
documents initially —provide good cause for unsealing the documents at this time. 
8. 
Finally, continued closure of these documents is pointless, because many portions 
of the sealed documents already have been made public. For example, court papers quoting 
excerpts of the agreement have been made public in related federal proceedings.3 As the Florida 
Supreme Court has noted, "there would be little justification for closing a pretrial hearing in 
order to prevent only the disclosure of details which had already been publicized." Lewis 426 
So. 2d at 8. Similarly, in this case, to the extent that information already has been made public, 
continued closure is pointless and, therefore, unconstitutional. 
9. 
The Post has no objection to the redaction of victims' names (if any) that appear 
in the sealed documents. In addition, insofar as the Defendant or State Attorney seek continued 
closure, the Post requests that the Court inspect the documents in camera in order to assess 
whether, in fact, continued closure is proper.
