## Match Contexts

### Match 1
> mber? 3) Is there any date set aside for the perjury trial? 4) What does this mean for the maximum sentence that Maxwell can now receive? I think we previously talked settled on up to 80 years behind bars. 5) Is the investigation into Maxwell and Epstein's network still ongoing? 6) If so, does Prince Andrew remain a person of interest? Have US prosecutors managed to get a statement from him yet or are there any arrangements in the pipeline to do so? I'd be grateful if you could drop me line with some responses within the next 48 hours if at possible please. Many thanks EFTA00010139 All the best
