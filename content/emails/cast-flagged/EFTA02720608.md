Yet, in a quirk of history, a reelected Obama could suddenly find his best historical opportunity thrust upon him. Here the arc of Obama's Presidency begins to resemble that of Bill Clinton's. Both pursued bold domestic agendas in their first two years before Republicans made large midterm gains in Congress, which led to repeated clashes over fiscal issues.

Obama's Iran and Syria muddle 
Jackson Diehl 
June 11 -- From one point of view the connection between our 
troubles with Syria and Iran is pretty straightforward. The Syrian 
regime of Bashar al-Assad is Iran's closest ally, and its link to 
the Arab Middle East. Syria has provided the land bridge for the 
transport of Iranian weapons and militants to Lebanon and the 
Gaza Strip. Without Syria, Iran's pretensions to regional 
hegemony, and its ability to challenge Israel, would be crippled. 
It follows that, as the U.S. Central Command chief Gen. James 
N. Mattis testified to Congress in March, the downfall of Assad 
would be "the biggest strategic setback for Iran in 25 years."

Making it happen is not just a humanitarian imperative after the 
slaughter of more than 10,000 civilians, but a prime strategic 
interest of Israel and the United States. 
So why are both the Obama administration and the government 
of Benjamin Netanyahu unethusiastic — to say the least —
about even indirect military intervention to topple Assad? In part 
it's because of worry about what would follow the dictator. In 
Obama's case, the U.S. presidential campaign, and his claim that 
"the tide of war is receding" in the Middle East, is a big factor. 
But the calculus about Syria and Iran is also more complicated 
than it looks at first. The two are not just linked by their alliance, 
but also by the fact that the United States and its allies have 
defined a distinct and urgent goal for each of them. In Syria, it is 
to remove Assad and replace him with a democracy; in Iran it is 
to prevent a nuclear weapon. It turns out that the steps that 
might achieve success in one theater only complicate Western 
strategy in the other. 
Take military action — a prime concern of Israel. Syria 
interventionists (such as myself) have been arguing that the 
United States and allies like Turkey should join in setting up 
safe zones for civilians and anti-Assad forces along Syria's 
borders, which would require air cover and maybe some 
(Turkish) troops. But if the United States gets involved in a 
military operation in Syria, would it still be feasible to carry out 
an air attack on Iran's nuclear facilities? What if Israel were to 
launch one while a Syria operation was still ongoing? 
The obvious answer is that the result could be an unmanageable 
mess — which is why, when I recently asked a senior Israeli 
E FTA_R 1_02204139 
EFTA02720610

official about a Western intervention in Syria, I got this answer: 
"We are concentrated on Iran. Anything that can create a 
distraction from Iran is not for the best." 
Obama, of course, is eager to avoid military action in Iran in any 
case. But his strategy — striking a diplomatic bargain to stop the 
nuclear program — also narrows his options in Syria. A deal 
with Tehran will require the support of Russia, which happens 
to be hosting the next round of negotiations. Russia, in turn, is 
opposed to forcing Assad, a longtime client, from power by any 
means. 
If Obama wants the support of Vladi-mir Putin on Iran, he may 
have to stick to Putin-approved measures on Syria. That leaves 
the administration at the mercy of Moscow: Obama is reduced to 
pleading with a stone-faced Putin to support a Syrian 
democracy, or angrily warning a cynically smirking Putin that 
Moscow is paving the way for a catastrophic sectarian war. 
At the root of this trouble are confused and conflicting U.S. aims 
in the Middle East. Does Washington want to overthrow the 
brutal, hostile and closely allied dictatorships of Assad and 
Iran's Ali Khamenei — or strike bargains that contain the threats 
they pose? The answer is neither, and both: The Obama 
administration says it is seeking regime change in Syria, but in 
Iran it has defined the goal as rapproachment with the mullahs in 
exchange for nuclear arms control. 
Obama tries to square this circle by pursuing a multilateral 
diplomatic approach to both countries. But if regime change in 
Syria is the goal, Security Council resolutions and six-point 
plans from the likes of Kofi Annan are doomed to failure. Only a 
E FTA_R1_02204140 
EFTA02720611

combination of economic and military pressure, by Assad's 
opposition or outsiders, will cause his regime to fold. 
A collapse, in turn, could undermine the same Iranian regime 
with which Obama is seeking a bargain. So it's no wonder 
Tehran sought to add Syria to the topics for discussion at the last 
session of negotiations — or that Annan wants to include Iran in 
a new "contact group" to broker a settlement in Syria. 
The Obama administration rejected both proposals — because 
they are at odds with Syrian regime change. This muddle may 
delight Vladi-mir Putin, but it's not likely to achieve much else.

How Europe Could Cost Obama the 
Election 
Niall Ferguson 
June 11, 2012 -- Could Europe cost Barack Obama the 
presidency? At first sight, that seems like a crazy question. Isn't 
November's election supposed to be decided in key swing states 
like Florida and Ohio, not foreign countries like Greece and 
Spain? And don't left-leaning Europeans love Obama and loathe 
Republicans?

Sure. But the possibility is now very real that a double-dip 
recession in Europe could kill off hopes of a sustained recovery 
in the United States. As the president showed in his anxious 
press conference last Friday, he well understands the danger 
emanating from across the pond. Slower growth and higher 
unemployment can only hurt his chances in an already very tight 
race with Mitt Romney. 
Most Americans are bored or baffled by Europe. Try explaining 
the latest news about Greek politics or Spanish banks, and their 
eyelids begin to droop. So, at the end of a four-week road trip 
round Europe, let me try putting this in familiar American terms. 
Imagine that the United States had never ratified the 
Constitution and was still working with the 1781 Articles of 
Confederation. Imagine a tiny federal government with almost 
no revenue. Only the states get to tax and borrow. Now imagine 
that Nevada has a debt in excess of 150 percent of the state's 
gross domestic product. Imagine, too, the beginning of a 
massive bank run in California. And imagine that unemployment 
in these states is above 20 percent, with youth unemployment 
twice as high. Picture riots in Las Vegas and a general strike in 
Los Angeles. 
Now imagine that the only way to deal with these problems is 
for Nevada and California to go cap in hand to Virginia or 
Texas—where unemployment today really is half what it is in 
Nevada. Imagine negotiations between the governors of all 50 
states about the terms and conditions of the bailout. Imagine the 
International Monetary Fund arriving in Sacramento to negotiate 
an austerity program.

This is pretty much where Europe finds itself today. Whereas the 
United States, with its federal system, has—almost without 
discussion—shared the burden of the financial crisis between 
the states of the Union, Europe has almost none of the 
institutions that would make that possible. 
The revenues of the European central institutions are trivially 
small: less than 1 percent of EU GDP. There is no central 
European Treasury. There is no federal European debt. All the 
Europeans have is a European Central Bank. And today they are 
discovering the hard way what some of us pointed out more than 
13 years ago, when the single European currency came into 
existence: that's not enough. 
Indeed, having a monetary union without any of the other 
institutions of a federal state is proving to be a disastrously 
unstable combination. The paradox is that monetary union is 
causing Europe to disintegrate—the opposite of what was 
intended. According to the IMF, GDP will contract this year by 
4.7 percent in Greece, 3.3 percent in Portugal, 1.9 percent in 
Italy, and 1.8 percent in Spain. The unemployment rate in Spain 
is 24 percent, in Greece 22 percent, and in Portugal 14 percent. 
Public debt exceeds 100 percent of GDP in Greece, Ireland, 
Italy, and Portugal. These countries' long-term interest rates are 
four or more times higher than Germany's. 
Perhaps the most shocking symptom of the crisis on the so-
called periphery is youth unemployment. In Greece and Spain, 
more than half of all young people are out of work. That's right: 
one in two young Greeks and Spaniards are unemployed, eking 
out an existence on doles, cash-only gray-market jobs, and rent-
free accommodations with mama and papa.

In the north European "core" of the euro zone, however, the 
picture is completely different. Unemployment in Germany is 
5.4 percent. In the Netherlands and Austria it is even lower. 
These economies are growing. Their governments have no 
difficulty borrowing. The phrase "two-speed Europe" hardly 
does justice to the bifurcation. There are in fact now two 
Europes: a Teutonic core and a Latin periphery. 
Privately, senior politicians and businessmen now admit that 
Europe would be in a much better position today if the monetary 
union had never happened. If there had been no euro, there 
would have been no borrowing bonanza on the periphery and no 
property bubble in Spain. And if they
