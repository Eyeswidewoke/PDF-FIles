Dear Mr.X., 
Thanks for informing me in advance on your trip's change...Based on it, I 
have re-confirmed new dates/days of your future possible stay at The 
National hotel week of June 24th and managed to keep for you the same rooms 
I rates at it which incurred some of my cash-outs this time and during the 
preliminary reservation as well which, based on Mr.L.Dubin's approval, will 
be reimbursed to me by Athena, as usual...Please, be also noted that at the 
end of next month there will be "An International Movie Festival" in Moscow 
and if your trip will be postponed again, then, it'll be hard for us to keep 
these hotel rooms indefinetely,even when all of them are guaranteed with my 
Athena's AMEX Card...Please, advise me as soon as you can on your Moscow 
visit in June'01...Thanks... 
Looking forward to hear and see you in Russia very soon...
