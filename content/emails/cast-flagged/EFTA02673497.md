Hi Boris,</=pan> 
The lock-up agreement =hat we negotiated in connection with the proposed public offering is attac=ed. This will 
become effective once the company files its preliminar= prospectus (they will give us notice) and continue for 180 days 
after the public offering. 
In the meantime, the private company securities we hold ha=e restrictions on transfer— you can see the language in 
section 2.8=and 2.10 of the Investor Rights Agreement — so we would need to run some traps with the company in order 
to se=l shares before the company goes public and the lock-up expiration.=span style="color:#1F497D"> 
What do you have in mi=d / how can we help?
