The boarding is on all inclusive system, meaning that almost every food and beverage consumption is included in the rate. There are always extra service with payment such as laundry, spa, hairdressers, some a la carte restaurants and premium quality alcoholic beverages etc. My colleague Ms. Elif Ceylan who is copied to this mail is in charge of the reservation department and I was told that American express is the only credit card we cannot accept the remote payment with. However, she'll send you a link where the cardholder logs in and makes the payment unless you'd like to provide Elif with EFTA_R1_00946949 EFTA02217162 another credit card such as master or visa. In regards with payment I kindly ask you please to liaise directly with Elif. Room and airport pick up is confirmed and as of morning of the 21" of June also the training at the Spa of The Land of Legends. Thank you.
