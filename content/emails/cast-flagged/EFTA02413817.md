**[WORD]:** ct: FYI Lloyd Grove from the Daily Beast just called me for "background" on Andrew's visit to NYC. Ugh. I said I wasn't allowed to talk to media without going through Bazaar PR. But geez, he was pushy. So I blew him away with an o0'the-record, "Ghislaine's a dear friend, the night was lovely and Andrew was charming." Yuck. xx EFTA_R1_01476465 EFTA02413817
