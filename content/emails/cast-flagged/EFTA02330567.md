| **To** | Jeff Epstein ca href=urnailto:jeevacation@gmail.com">jeevacation@gmail.com> <=r> Jeffery, I took a long bike ride through the hills south of town on Saturday, a=d I couldn't get your ranch off of my mind. It's truly one of the =ost remarkable properties in the world! Everything about it inside and out= and all around make it unique. Architecture, landscape, design, construction, finishing, decor, art, materials, all sta=gering! I'll never forget the moment of silence on the front porch of the =abin, and that expansive view. Of course I took the wrong road left and wo=nd up at the train car. Instead of just flipping a u-turn and driving out.=.l sat in my car in the rain and just took in the 'devil's spine' again. What an amazing spot. =/div> Thanks for the offer to bring my family out with you, but I'm gonn= keep them on the Wednesday travel schedule because of how much work I hav= early this week. This Tuesday morning is the biggest piece of the shootout sometime bet=een 9 & noon, or if it's latter, I'll call you. Defiantly try =o come by, so let's make sure we talk that morning. The phone that wor=s best when I'm at the ranch is (505) 660-1949 <tel:%28505%29%20660-1949> . Thank you for the experience of being on the Zorro property, and as al=ays...great to hang with you anytime. I hope you have a enjoyable trip west today!
