| **Subject** | Fwd: RE: Attachments: flag appliances.pdf; Untitled attachment 00043.htm These are the appliances for the flag pole cabana Brice and Karen picked out that they can get locally at home depot. I agree it makes sense to buy locally for these in case they are delivered damaged, it's much easier to deal with. I also think they all look good. Only question is if you are ok with the fridge having a water and ice dispenser? I think it might be a good thing to have Begin forwarded message: attached are the GE units we are looking at. the prices are from home depot here ,emad priced them out from the states for 570 less but I would spend the difference .buying local eliminates us being responsible for damage. our last shipment had the refrigerator,2 dryers and the icemaker all damaged. the dryer needs to be 208 volt ,every thing else is standard |
