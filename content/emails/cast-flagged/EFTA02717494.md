Global Good FAQ

What is Global Good? 
Global Good is a collaboration between Intellectual Ventures (IV) and Bill Gates to invent technology 
that improves lives in developing countries. With support from a coalition of NGO, government and 
business partners, we conceive, develop and deploy inventions for the poorest parts of the world. 
How is Bill Gates involved? 
The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust is the sole investor in Global Good and Mr. Gates helps direct 
the focus of the work through regular meetings with IV scientists and Global Good staff. 
How is Global Good funded? 
Global Good is funded by an investment from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust to the Global 
Good Fund, which is managed by IV. 
Can individuals invest in Global Good? 
Not at this time. 
How much money has been invested in the fund to-date? 
We don't reveal specific financial details about the fund. 
What is the lifespan of the Global Good Fund? 
Global Good is an evergreen fund and is not constrained by a predetermined lifespan. 
Is IV making money off of Global Good? 
IV won't profit from Global Good inventions used in developing countries, which we define as countries 
eligible for assistance from the GAVI Alliance. 
What does Global Good do with any profit made from its inventions? 
It is not the aim of Global Good to achieve a financial return on investment for profit. Royalties 
generated from commercialization of our inventions in the developed world are invested back into The 
Global Good Fund to repeat the cycle. 
Do Global Good's commercialization partners make money? 
Global Good's partners may make money by commercializing our inventions in developed or developing 
countries. For the latter, our licensing agreements provide the necessary incentives and restrictions to 
ensure that our technology is affordable and accessible in these markets. 
Why does Global Good file patents on its inventions? 
Intellectual property helps provide the protection and incentives needed to ensure our technology is 
affordable and accessible in developing countries. Although many developing countries don't have 
functioning patent systems, this is changing rapidly and, in the interim, our technology may also have 
commercial applications in developed countries that could generate profit to support Global Good.

How is Global Good connected to the Gates Foundation? 
Global Good's investor, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust, is an entity separate from the Bill & 
Melinda Gates Foundation. Global Good works closely with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and 
other leading global health and development organizations. We are not a Gates Foundation program or 
grantee, but are guided by similar priorities because of Mr. Gates' involvement. 
What is Global Good currently working on? 
Global Good's work currently includes projects across six areas: vaccine logistics, disease modeling, 
agricultural productivity, malaria and tuberculosis diagnostics, maternal and child health, and vector 
management. 
Are any Global Good inventions currently being used in the field? 
Global Good's disease models are currently being used by public health organizations to inform disease 
eradication strategies. Several other Global Good inventions are being tested in the field and are nearing 
commercial deployment. Science takes time, and Global Good will not release any new technology until 
it is confident that it can safely and reliably meet the challenges it is designed for. 
How is Global Good different from other organizations working on global health technologies? 
Unlike non-profit organizations working on technology for developing countries, Global Good invests its 
own capital in R&D and deployment strategies. Unlike companies working in the space, Global Good is 
driven by impact rather than profit. 
Why is a for-profit company like IV doing this? 
As the leader in the business of invention, IV sees an opportunity to apply its unique business 
capabilities toward problems in developing countries. We believe inventions hold the power to improve 
lives anywhere in the world — even in areas where traditional market forces don't attract them. We also 
are uniquely positioned to leverage our knowledge of IP and the resources of our laboratory to support 
Global Good's mission. 
Is IV paying for this with money from their other investment funds? 
No. Global Good is financed separately from IV's other funds. 
How is Global Good different from IV's previous work to fight malaria? 
Global Good builds on the early progress of IV's Malaria Project and applies the same invention-based 
approach to address other challenges in developing countries. Our malaria prevention and detection 
projects are now a part of Global Good, which provides the additional resources and leadership to 
ensure any effective solutions find their way into the field. 
IV doesn't make products, so how does it plan to take Global Good inventions beyond their lab? 
Once an invention has been sufficiently developed with support from IV Laboratory Global Good's 
coalition of partners, it is licensed to a commercial partner to make it accessible and affordable in 
developing countries. 
Is Global Good a spin-off or part of IV? 
Similar to other IV funds, Global Good is a fund managed by Intellectual Ventures. Unlike IV's other 
funds, Global Good isn't motivated by profit.

Will IV sue people they feel are infringing on Global Good's inventions? 
We will protect our IP against infringement that undermines our goal to improve life in developing 
countries. 
Who owns the IP generated by Global Good's collaboration with the Gates Foundation? 
The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has agreed to assign to Global Good any Foundation-generated IP 
resulting from its collaborations with Global Good. 
How do I contact Global Good about partnering or to submit an invention? 
Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation staff can submit ideas or areas of interest to either Fil Randazzo at 
BMGF, or directly to Ali Arjomand at Global Good (aarjomand@intven.com).
Partner inquiries and invention submissions can be sent to globalgood@intven.com, but please include 
only public information such as patent numbers or published patent applications. Because of the high 
volume of inquiries we receive, we are not able to respond to every one individually.
