| **To** | Jeffrey <jeevacation@gmail.com <mailto:jeevacation@gmail.com» Could you check please: Sorry, Mark. Frankly this is nonsense. They always ask one more thing . I told them they had until Monday to agree a price of 15m euro. They said no. They have not provided any useful information to date. No tax advice, etc., no bvi to stiftung. An audit that shows 60m value. All silly! As you might imagine, I am done with this. ie. banks do not certify fund origination. They have no knowledge of it. That is why it is always left to the accounting firms. Again, silly. Thanks for your help. Look forward to seeing you soon.
