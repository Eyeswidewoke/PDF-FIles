We went t= a hotel sultan owns with all these amazing restaurants; an Italian one, Ch=nese one, morracan, a French bakery looking sweet place. And there was no o=e in them. We saw like 4 people by the pool and maybe 4 people in the lobby=near all the restaurants. We ate in the Chinese one for lunch and the food w=s amazing.
