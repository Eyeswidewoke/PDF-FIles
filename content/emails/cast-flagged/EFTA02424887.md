Jeffrey told me to contact you about Monday. 
If anyone drops dead, the dog dies or the nanny elopes....and you have an empty seat I will fill in. (Just spare me from 
amusing the walking dead.) No stress. I can always go to Liz Smith's Literacy Partners dinner. 
Thanks so much for any and all your efforts. 
xoxo Peggy
