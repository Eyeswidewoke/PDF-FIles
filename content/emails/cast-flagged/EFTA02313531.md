The old one is rectangular: 22" x 15 3/4" x 15 3/=". Also Du=son made some requests: (3) 21 feet pole saw, 3 -extension and (12) hand pr=ners please? See attached photos. Also, could you please work with Mr. Epstein on selecting fa=ric for the banquette since he didn't care for the last fabric. Als=, he instructed us to take the Pinto rods down in the Cabanas. He didn*=99t care for them because they were black. Would you like us to paint them w=ite? He had also instructed us to take down the curtains prior to that. Cou=d you confirm what he or you will want to go in their place? This is all I can think of in the=moment. If any of these items are not suitable for the plane, we'll=see about ordering them.
