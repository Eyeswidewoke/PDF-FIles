| **CC** | Hi Ion, I just want to confirm your schedule for beginning work on the pool cabana. I=m not sure if Jeffrey mentioned his idea for painting an Italian fresco on t=e walls with you, but wondering if you have some ideas for the design and w=lI be able to do some samples before? I know you mentioned you can start work on it Sept 15. Does that mean you wi=l plan on flying to St Thomas on Sept 14? And will Sept 15 be the day you begin working on samples? Sorry to be such a=pain, but JE is asking for a schedule and was asking about samples, so I wa=t to be able to let him know about both. Thanks!!
