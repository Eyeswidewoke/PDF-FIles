Seventeen More U.S. Families Take Giving Pledge 
Additional Billionaires Pledge Majority of Wealth to Philanthropy 
SEATTLE — Dec. 8, 2010 — Seventeen more of America's wealthiest families have committed to returning 
the majority of their wealth to charitable causes by taking the Giving Pledge. The announcement of a 
second group of pledgers follows news in August of this year when 40 families took the pledge, a long-
term charitable project launched by Warren Buffett and Bill and Melinda Gates. 
"People wait until late in their career to give back. But why wait when there is so much to be done?" 
said Mark Zuckerberg, co-founder, CEO and president of Facebook. "With a generation of younger folks 
who have thrived on the success of their companies, there is a big opportunity for many of us to give 
back earlier in our lifetime and see the impact of our philanthropic efforts." 
"I'm delighted to welcome these 17 families into the Giving Pledge community," said Warren Buffett, 
pledge co-founder and chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway. "In just a few short months we've 
made good progress. The Giving Pledge has re-energized people thinking about philanthropy and doing 
things in philanthropy and I look forward to many more conversations with families who are truly 
fortunate, and whose generosity can and will change lives." 
Announced in June, the Giving Pledge now includes 57 families from across the United States. 
Additionally, both Buffett and the Gateses have begun conversations with billionaires from other 
countries to learn about their philanthropy efforts and what has worked in their countries. 
"The Giving Pledge is about changing the culture of giving," said Peter Singer, professor of bioethics in 
the University Center for Human Values at Princeton University and author of "The Life You Can Save." 
"Research shows that when people know that others are giving, they are themselves more likely to give. 
So publicly pledging to give will encourage others to give. This holds true for billionaires and for those of 
us who aren't anywhere near that level of wealth. We can all make a difference, and play our part in 
making the world a better place." 
A full list of those taking the pledge and personal letters by many of these pledgers outlining their 
commitment to give is available online at 
zivingplecige org. 
The Giving Pledge is an effort to help address society's most pressing problems by inviting the wealthiest 
American families and individuals to commit to giving more than half of their wealth to philanthropy or 
charitable causes. The pledge is a moral commitment to give, not a legal contract, and it does not 
involve pooling money or supporting a particular set of causes or organizations. While it is specifically 
focused on billionaires or those who would be billionaires if not for their giving, the idea takes its 
inspiration from other efforts that encourage and recognize givers of all financial means and 
backgrounds.

Select Pledge Letter Excerpts: 
• 
Nicolas Berggruen 
Everyone is dealt a group of cords at birth. With them come possibilities and responsibilities. 
What one does with them is up to each one of us, and the sum of those chokes, constitute our 
lives. I have been blessed with the chance to build the Nicolas Berggruen Charitable Trust. 
• 
Steve and Jean Case 
We share the view that those to whom much is given, much is expected. We realize we have 
been given a unique platform and opportunity, and we are committed to doing the best we can 
with it...We also look forward to working with the dozens of others who hove made the Giving 
Pledge commitment to share lessons, perspectives and best practices. 
• 
Lee and Toby Cooperman: 
fWej feel it is our moral imperative to give others the opportunity to pursue the American Dream 
by sharing our financial success...In the 1930's, Sir Winston Churchill observed that "We make a 
living by what we get, but we make a life by what we give."...lt is in this spirit that we 
enthusiastically agree to take the Giving Pledge.

David and Barbara Green 
Like my parents and their parents before them, you don't have to be wealthy to give. You can 
give your time, your talents and your passion. We congratulate those who have taken on this 
wonderful pledge.

I wish to make the world a better place by advancing solutions to medical and environmental 
issues through investments in and donations to science.

Carl Icahn 
Until Bill, Melinda and Warren started this project, I never considered going public with my 
intentions. However, I certainly see the value of a project that encourages wealthy individuals to 
step forward and commit to use their wealth for the common good. I hope that by adding my 
voice with those who are supporting this project, we will all encourage others to participate. 
• 
Sidney Kimmel 
My thinking is rather simple: I learned as a young boy that shoring with others is the right thing 
to do, a lesson I observed from my father's willingness to shore even our meager means with 
those less fortunate. Ever since, it has never been difficult for me to continue to do the right 
thing. 
• 
Duncan and Nancy MacMillan 
We very much believe that the accumulation of wealth gets us nowhere. Money has the most 
value when it's used for others and the greater good, for sustaining and enriching our world. In 
our minds, foundational areas like education and health are the most critical. 
• 
George P. Mitchell 
Throughout my life I've seen firsthand how even a little financial assistance could mean a chance 
for struggling students, dedicated scientists, and families to reach their goals.
