| **Subject** | Bullet Train ...Now that we have your Kyoto hotel reservations confirmed we can =uy your bullet train tickets...I suggest you look at this =ebsite: =ttps://www.govoyagin.com/activities/japan-tokyo-get-shinkansen-bullet-tra=n-tickets-between-tokyo-and-kyoto/4176 They are a travel type agency ...I read they will deliver your =ickets to your hotel (should be done 3 days in advance of travel...=he more advance notice the better I'm sure) and they can also =ick you up I think in Kyoto and get you to the Tawaraya (as long as it =s a concierge hotel (?) The trains depart on the hour...I would think you want a 10am or =lam departure on Sept 26th and then again on Oct. 1st? Looks to me the =rain takes close to 3 hours to get from Tokyo to Kyoto (or like 2 hours =5 min) Perhaps you want to speak to Joi's wife about the train? maybe =he know a better place to book it through...just wanted to throw =his out there. I do think the sooner it is booked the better. <?xml version=.0" encoding=TF-8"b <IDOCTYPE plist PUBLIC eV/Apple/MID PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/Propertylist-1.0.dtd"> <plist version=.0"> alict> <key>conversation-idgkey> <integer>11358</integer> <key>date-last-viewed</key> <integer>0</integer> <key>date-received</key> <integer>1473947829</integer> <key>flags</key> <integer>8623750149</integer> <key>remote-id</key> <string>44755</string> </diet> </plist> 1 EFTA_R1_01258560 EFTA02329556 |
