IPI PROPOSAL: POLIO ERADICATION AND THE 
CONNECTION BETWEEN PEACE & HEALTH 
I. Proposal Overview: 
IPI's proposal to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMFG) consists of two parts: an initial, model 
project aimed at reducing the security threats related to polio eradication in the few specific localities 
where it is still prevalent (Afghanistan, Pakistan, Nigeria, and Somalia); and a longer-term, overarching 
initiative on peace and health designed to reduce vulnerability and increase resilience related to the 
peace-and-health nexus by alleviating the disease and poor health that conributes to instability, and 
conversely, mitigating the sources of instability that threaten health. 
Polio Eradication 
A primary goal of the BMGF is to eradicate polio worldwide. Thanks to a highly successful global 
campaign over the past decade, polio has been successfully eradicated in 99.9 percent of the world. 
However, polio remains endemic in three locations: Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Nigeria. In fact, 100% of 
the polio cases in 2012 were found in 54 districts in these three countries. Recently, new cases have been 
identified in Somalia. Therefore, eradicating polio globally and permanently has come down to the last 
"golden millimeter"—reaching a few thousand children in a handful of isolated, unstable, inaccessible, 
and inhospitable communities. 
The areas in which polio is still a problem are geographically dispersed, but they share some significant 
characteristics: they are comparatively small and difficult to access due to insecurity, insurgency, or 
conflict; and the lack of state authority or control has enabled local power brokers to shape the 
discourse. 
In all of these regions, public health is being used as a tool in misinformation campaigns, whether 
intentionally or as a by-product of a broader political or ideological agenda, which has put the health of 
children at risk. Health workers are also at risk. Several health workers involved in the polio eradication 
campaign were recently killed in Nigeria and Pakistan. In August 2013 Medecins Sans Frontieres 
announced it is closing all its programs in Somalia after a 22-year presence due to attacks on its staff. 
IPI therefore proposes to assist the BMGF to better understand the local conditions, identify the drivers 
that (or who) can turn the situation around, and provide advice on what steps can be taken to improve 
the chances of eradicating polio in the remaining few localities where it is still present. IPI's work will 
involve, inter alia, providing situation assessments of the vulnerable communities, carrying out and/or 
analyzing quantitative surveys of the affected communities, facilitating access to these communities, and 
(based on the knowledge of the local conditions) assisting in the development of communications 
strategies to eradicate polio.

IPI's work on polio eradication is the first step in a broader, long-term initiative on peace and health. As 
stated in the World Health Organization's Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion (1986), peace is a 
primary condition for health. Instability makes people and communities more vulnerable to disease, and 
prevents them from living healthy and productive lives. For example, polio is proving hardest to 
eradicate in regions of some of the world's most unstable countries: Afghanistan, Pakistan, Nigeria, and 
Somalia. Conversely, stability fosters an environment conducive to providing humanitarian and 
development assistance. Therefore, IPI is launching a peace and health initiative to better understand 
the links between peace and health, and to generate policy support to reduce vulnerability and increase 
resilience to health-related problems that contribute to instability, and conversely, to mitigate sources of 
instability that threaten health. 
The initiative aims to become a thought and policy leader on the connection between health and 
stability— understanding the links and their negative aspects, and promoting remedial solutions. This is 
vital since peace and health interact in many different ways. The most significant, and malign, link is the 
fact that people are killed, injured, disabled, abused, or traumatized due to armed conflict. Conflict 
prevention, mediation, and peacebuilding are therefore vital for saving lives. In addition, armed conflict 
has indirect effects on global health. These include: 
1) impeding access of health professionals and humanitarian agencies to populations in need 
(conflict-affected countries have on average less than one health professional per 10,000 
people); 
2) "flight" of health professionals from conflict zones for safety issues (health workers are 
often targeted by government security forces as well) as we are currently witnessing in 
Syria and Somalia; 
3) lack of supplies and basic equipment in hospitals and clinics in conflict zones, as well as 
difficult and unsafe access to health facilities for populations in need, also due to 
deterioration of infrastructure and transportation; 
4) decrease in government expenditure on healthcare; 
5) food shortages due to damaged agricultural structures, collapse of the economy, aid 
deliberately withheld, and disruption of the family unit; 
6) three to four times higher under-5 child mortality rates in conflict zones than in the rest of 
the world; 
7) sharp decline in basic childhood immunization in conflict zones; 
8) highest rates of maternal deaths due to childbirth complications and other debilitating 
conditions in conflict-ridden or post-conflict states; 
9) increased incidents of sexual violence towards women and children, with greater numbers 
of sexually transmitted diseases, as well physical and psychological trauma; and 
10) increased incidence of infectious diseases (malaria, cholera, measles) during conflict due 
to malnutrition, unsanitary conditions, lack of clean water, etc. 
These factors create a vicious cycle. Greater instability endangers health, while greater vulnerability 
(including disease) breeds instability. Indeed, states characterized as fragile or failed (including those 
that have high rates of polio) tend to have far worse population health indicators than states at 
comparable levels of development. As of today, for example, no low-income fragile or conflict-affected 
country has yet achieved a single Millennium Development Goal (MDGs). Poor health indicators are a 
product of inadequate governance and service development. Moreover, fragile states tend to be affected 
by humanitarian crises that endure for years. In other words, a context of continuing crises and 
emergencies, combined with weak or non-existent local and national institutions, can undermine health 
improvements or nullify health investments and programs in the long-term.

While armed conflict and instability undermine health goals, the opposite is also true. Investments in 
health, conflict resolution, and statebuilding can be mutually reinforcing. Conflict resolution and 
peacebuilding measures can help prevent or lessen the impact of the above negative outcomes of armed 
conflict on public health. At the same time, the position of medical professionals in society, given their 
neutrality, credibility, and equality, can be a precious resource during negotiations, as are health-related 
cease-fires. The fact that health issues are of interest to all warring parties can contribute to this 
advantage. 
Moreover, health investment can contribute to statebuilding and legitimacy of institutions. In the long 
term, stronger healthcare systems can improve the health of the population, leading to greater 
productivity, stronger economies, less violence, and state stability. Evidence also indicates that improved 
health services can increase trust in state institutions, thus contributing to the authority and legitimacy of 
the government. 
In short, while poor health and instability have a negative impact on each other, peace and health are 
mutually beneficial. It is therefore necessary to promote peace as a primary condition for health, and to 
improve health as a way of promoting peace and development. That is the objective of IPI's work on 
peace and health. Since this is an ambitious objective that will require significant time, money, and 
knowledge, IPI intends to mobilize resources to 
develop proposals for how it could be possible to 
monitoring globally the nexus among peace, security, and health. The link between instability and 
disease is st
