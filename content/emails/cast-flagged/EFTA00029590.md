> ernment's letter dated August 18, 2021, Dkt. 320, which raises two issues.' Identities of Co-Conspirators The government first attempts to walk back its multiple concessions regarding disclosure of the identities of the unnamed co-conspirators alleged in the S2 indictment. As this Court noted, Ms. Maxwell has on at least two occasions requested such disclosure. Dkt. 317 at 12 n.1 (citing Dkt. 291 and Dkt. 293). Only after this Court ordered disclosure of the identities of the unnamed co-conspirators alleged in the S2 indictment did the government finally object. The government's objection comes t

> order is an `extraordinary remedy to be employed in the interests of finality and conservation of scarce judicial resources.' Montanile v. Nat '1 Broad. Co., 216 F. Supp. 2d 341, 342 (S.D.N.Y. 2002). The government cannot show extraordinary circumstances here. The government twice had notice of Ms. Maxwell's request for disclosure, and the government twice chose not to object. The government cannot use a motion to reconsider to save itself from the consequences of its deliberate decisions. "[A] losing party" is not permitted to "examin[e] a decision and then plug[] in the gaps of a lost motion wit

> iberate decisions. "[A] losing party" is not permitted to "examin[e] a decision and then plug[] in the gaps of a lost motion with additional matters." Berger, 188 F. Supp. 2d at 339. Because that is exactly what the government is attempting to do, this Court should deny the government's request. Ms. Maxwell is entitled to the disclosure this Court ordered.

> onal co-conspirators." Id. Both in its August 18 letter and during an August 24 conferral call, the government took the position that it has no obligation to identify the specific statements it intends to offer under Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(2)(E). The government told defense counsel that Ms. Maxwell could glean what statements might be offered from the government's witness list and exhibit list, once those lists are disclosed on October 11. This Court has already resolved this matter, and the government's position is another improper attempt to obtain reconsideration. After conferral, the

If the government does not disclose what co-conspirator statements it intends to offer, as this Court already ordered the government to do by October 11, then Ms. Maxwell will be unable to file a motion in limine by October 18 challenging the admissibility of the co-conspirator statements and thereby put the government to its burden of proof and ensure this Court is able to discharge its gatekeeping function. See Bourjaily, 483 U.S. at 175-76. Although the govern

See Bourjaily, 483 U.S. at 175-76. Although the government may not wish to give Ms. Maxwell the required notice, this Court has already entered its order. The government's letter offers no reason, much less a compelling reason, for this Court to reconsider its order. The government has not even attempted to identify "controlling law or factual matters which it believes the court overlo

Conclusion Ms. Maxwell asks this Court to confirm what it already ordered: (1) that the government disclose the identities of the unnamed co-conspirators charged in the S2 indictment at the same time it discloses Jenks Act material; and (2) that, no later than October I I, the government disclose the specific co-consp

Nathan August 30, 2021 Page 4 If disclosure of the witness and exhibit lists were by themselves sufficient to give Ms. Maxwell notice of the specific co-conspirator statements the government intends to admit at trial, this Court would not have separately ordered the government to disclose "co-conspirator statements." Id. But that's not what the Court did. There are very good reasons for this. This Court serves as a gate
