I'll be modify, the project I gave to Jeffrey according to what he discussed and send him some new ideas real soon. We've been talking once about an art sculpture which could be implanted at « dead end » and I `m working on it. Also, I wonder EFTA_R1_00948425 EFTA02217896 whether some of you guys can send me picture of the bay without the tennis court that might have been destroy now. It will be very helpful to re-interpreted the entire landscape project without it. I also wanted to let you know that I'll be travelling from the 8th to the 20th, but still going to be reachable by mail and phone. Thank you very much, Regards, Kevin. <Capture d'ecran 2016-03-11 i 15.51.11.png> SAS KO CONCEPT Anse des Cayes, 97133 Saint-Barthillem <Capture d'ecran 2016-03-11 a 15.51.11.png> SAS KO CONCEPT Anse des Cayes, 97133 Saint-Barthelem EFTA_R1_00948426 EFTA02217897 |
