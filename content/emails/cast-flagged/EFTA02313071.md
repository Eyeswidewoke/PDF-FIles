| **To** | S=bject: Bin Ennakhil Dear Karyna, I had a call from Alex Peto earlier today, who is in receipt of t=e letter from Alan Dlugash confirming that the funds held in Deutche Bank =or Haze Trust are adequately reported and fully compliant with the U= tax authorities. This is a GREAT step fo=ward, however it seems that the bankers on the other side still require th=t this letter emanates from Deutche Bank themselves (ie Bank to Bank) to f=lly comply with money laundering requirements. Therefore, would it be possible for you to ask Deutche Bank to=send a simple confirmation of the above directly to the vendors bankers, a= this should unblock the proceedings and let the deal move forward.=br> Kensington Properties have assured me they are d=ing their level best to make this happen but at the same time are anxious =ot to aggravate you further with this additional request, hence my interve=tion. But there doesn't seem to be any other away around this.
