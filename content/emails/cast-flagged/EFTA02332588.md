| **Subject** | [Fwd: Update] Tue 6/17/2003 11:07:02 AM Dear Miss Maxwell, Good day. In response to Norman Luxenburgs message below, I will explain Stephen's departure and tell him that the Director of Development position is still in the recruitment stage. I will tell him that we should have a sense of his status by the end of the week. So, hopefully you will be able to give a sense of Norman's status in a few days. Thank you and good luck with the interviews scheduled so far.
