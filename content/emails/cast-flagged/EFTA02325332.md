K On Thu, Aug 18, 2011 at 11:24 AM, Can we put a few of the Olive jars from crate and barrel at the end of this wall and take some photos. It might be a good place to use all of them. Maybe if you put one large and one small together so he can get a sense of what size they are. Thanks Begin forwarded message: |
