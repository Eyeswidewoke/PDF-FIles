As I mentioned I have alway= generated a list over the holiday period (Thanksgiving thru New Year) this=had been especially important for Construction on LSJ. Darren requested=early this year that I track Lafayette, Gary considers William Rowles as se=ior personal, hence oversees his time off, but provided me with his informa=ion Please note all employees who work full time on LSJ clock into the Time=lock except Emad who is not happy to do so, but when he is on Island I cloc= him in manually. Very helpful to know who is on Island especially if you n=ed to get everyone off in a hurry and an excellent way to track time off Warmest regards <=r>LSJ,LLC Island Manager =/html>= 1 EFTA_R1_01226282 EFTA02319041 |
