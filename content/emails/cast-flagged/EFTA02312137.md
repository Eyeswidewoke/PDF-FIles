If you could come back and have a=other look in the spring should it remain available it would be great.

We understand sellers can s=metimes be stubborn, but there is a reason that this has been on the market=for so long without a sale. <=r class=""> Happy New Year. =div dir="ltr" class=""> Karyna =n Jan 2, 2019, at 10:17 AM, Alex Peto < class=» wrote: Happy New=Year.

I now believe an offer circa 35m euros would be acce=table. This property is unique and will never be able to be recreated, it i= a work of art or a monument as much as fabulous property. Dar Olfa - like Bin Ennakhil the ask=ng price remains at 65m euros and was also under contact last year but due t=x reasons the deal did not go ahead - it is likely a figure around 40 - 45m=euros would be acceptable. The only comparable recent sale was in this comp=und known as Bab Atlas and was the sale of the largest property there for a=reputed 10Om euros to The Emir of Qatar. Ksar Swari - also located in Bab Atlas with an askin= price of 30m euros is less negotiable. This property is owned by the devel=per of the whole project and as you saw has some wonderful workmanship with=hand carved cedar ceilings and beautiful gardens. As it is lived in most of=the year it has a much warmer or homely feeling to the all the others you s=w. The very high a=d property market in Marrakech is as expected a tiny part of the market and=there are no comparable sales since the purchase by the Emir however right n=w Ali Bongo from Gabon and Al Nahyan family of Abu Dhabi are both building p=laces which will cost over 40m euros each. 3 EFTA_R1_01200004 EFTA02312139 Normally when purchasing a property in Morocco one s=ould add approximately 10% to the purchase price spilt 6% in government tax=s, 1% Notaire fees and 3% real estate agency fees however in the case of Bi= Ennakhil for example as the property is owned by a company in Lichtenstein=there are no government taxes to be paid in Morocco. <=r class=""> I am sending via wetrans=er more pictures of Bin Ennakhil, Ksar Swan and Dar Olfa and you have the P=F brochures for each property. </=iv> I look forward to hearing from you and of course I remai= at your disposal should you have any more questions. =br class=""> Kind regards Alex Alex Peto Partner <=pan lang= FR-MA class= ""> www.kensingtonmorocco.com <http://www.kens=ngtonmorocco.com/> Find us on Facebook <https://www.facebo=k.com/kensingtonmorocco/> Instagram=/span> I Twitter</=:p> <=span> Private Office M=rrakech </=pan> 1st Flo=r, Imm El Pacha 67 Rue Ibn Khaldoun, 40000 Marrakech Morocco cunknown.png> Please consider t=e environment before printing this email. <=span>=his e-mail may contain confidential and/or privileged information.
