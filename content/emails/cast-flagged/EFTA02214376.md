Yes, I lived in New York at the Watsons' apartment for five years, but they are now preparing to sell it, so have moved out to the Seattle area as a `home base' for my performance travels (I have to fly everywhere regardless of if I'm in New York or Seattle). :) -Charlie > On Jun 8, 2017, at 9:24 AM, wrote: > ah!
