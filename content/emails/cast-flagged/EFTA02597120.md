As discussed a few weeks ago, but with a little refinement, here's the proposed agenda for tomorrow. 
I've not been included in the much of the work done by Bose or Jonah so if you'd like to invite them maybe Larry 
could propose which topics below are appropriate - otherwise I'd ask that we keep it to us and Larry can later delegate 
any issues for followup. All of my reports and summaries have been circulated to the teams already. 
1. 
Paul's Bioscience Summit 
2. 
Financial products to reduce cost of medications and care 
3. 
University of Washington Brain Initiative 
4. 
Follow up from your questions on uses of physical energy : focused ultrasound, hyperbarics, 
MRelastography, transcranial magnetic stimulation 
5. 
: my proposed project or 
6. 
Any questions on Israel trip 
7. 
Any questions on Alzheimer outside or beyond your McKinsey effort 
8. 
My next steps
