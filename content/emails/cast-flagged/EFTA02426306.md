Not exactly on point, but I hear she's interesting!

Amateurs are trying genetic engineering at home

SAN FRANCISCO - The Apple computer was invented in a garage. Same with the Google search 
engine. Now, tinkerers are working at home with the basic building blocks of life itself. 
Using homemade lab equipment and the wealth of scientific knowledge available online, these hobbyists 
are trying to create new life forms through genetic engineering — a field long dominated by Ph.D.s toiling 
in university and corporate laboratories. 
In her San Francisco dining room lab, for example, 31-year-old computer programmer Meredith L. 
Patterson is trying to develop genetically altered yogurt bacteria that will glow green to signal the 
presence of melamine, the chemical that turned Chinese-made baby formula and pet food deadly. 
"People can really work on projects for the good of humanity while learning about something they want to 
learn about in the process," she said. 
So far, no major gene-splicing discoveries have come out anybody's kitchen or garage.

But critics of the movement worry that these amateurs could one day unleash an environmental or 
medical disaster. Defenders say the future Bill Gates of biotech could be developing a cure for cancer in 
the garage. 
Many of these amateurs may have studied biology in college but have no advanced degrees and are not 
earning a living in the biotechnology field. Some proudly call themselves "biohackers" — innovators who 
push technological boundaries and put the spread of knowledge before profits. 
In Cambridge, Mass., a group called DlYbio is setting up a community lab where the public could use 
chemicals and lab equipment, including a used freezer, scored for free off Craigslist, that drops to 80 
degrees below zero, the temperature needed to keep many kinds of bacteria alive. 
Co-founder Mackenzie Cowell, a 24-year-old who majored in biology in college, said amateurs will 
probably pursue serious work such as new vaccines and super-efficient biofuels, but they might also try, 
for example, to use squid genes to create tattoos that glow. 
Cowell said such unfettered creativity could produce important discoveries. 
"We should try to make science more sexy and more fun and more like a game," he said. 
Patterson, the computer programmer, wants to insert the gene for fluorescence into yogurt bacteria, 
applying techniques developed in the 1970s. 
She learned about genetic engineering by reading scientific papers and getting tips from online forums. 
She ordered jellyfish DNA for a green fluorescent protein from a biological supply company for less than 
$100. And she built her own lab equipment, including a gel electrophoresis chamber, or DNA analyzer, 
which she constructed for less than $25, versus more than $200 for a low-end off-the-shelf model. 
Jim Thomas of ETC Group, a biotechnology watchdog organization, warned that synthetic organisms in 
the hands of amateurs could escape and cause outbreaks of incurable diseases or unpredictable 
environmental damage. 
"Once you move to people working in their garage or other informal location, there's no safety process in 
place," he said. 
Some also fear that terrorists might attempt do-it-yourself genetic engineering. But Patterson said: "A 
terrorist doesn't need to go to the DlYbio community. They can just enroll in their local community 
college."
