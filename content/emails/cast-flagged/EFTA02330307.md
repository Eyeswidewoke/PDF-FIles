She now told me it might be better to do the surgery later=2C instead of December, since she feels that the heeling process after h=r myomectomy is taking longer then she though. I am sorry if I wasted your=time asking for December dates. Also I explained to her what you told me a=out the 3D nipple tattoo and she agreed on that. > P.S.= hope your leg will recover soon and you will be able to wear dresses, e=pecially with such beautiful legs! <=body> 1 EFTA_R1_01261799 EFTA02330307 |
