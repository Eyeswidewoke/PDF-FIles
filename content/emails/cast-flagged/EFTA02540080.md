3. According to 
Ghislaine Maxwell recruited her as Epstein's "sex slave" when she was 15 years old and 
arran=ed for her to see Andrew three times—at Jeffrey Epstein's homes in London =nd New York and on his private 
Caribbean island, Little Saint James—where, 
said, she'd been "sexually exploited by Epstein'= adult male peers, 
including royalty." Would Ghislaine please comment on this assertion by 
MS MAXWELL MET MS 
WHEN SHE BELIEVES SHE WAS 17 AND SHE WAS LIVING &=bsp;WITH HER FIANCE. MS 
WAS HIRED BY MR EPSTEIN AS A MASSUSE. =MS 
HAD A PRIOR SEXUAL HASSARASSMENT SUIT 
AGAINST OTHER INDIVIDUALS =HAT WAS THROWN OUT FOR LACK OF HER CREDABILITY PRIOR TO HER FILING A CIVIL 
=ASE AGAINST MR EPSTEIN.that It Should be noted thatc/=ONT> MS II
, PRIOR TO FILING HER SUIT, HAD FLED 
THE US TO AVOID BEING =RRESTED and possibly put in jail FOR grand THEFT. I THINK GIVEN THIS AND OTHER HIGHLY 
INDICAT=VE EVENTS IN HER LIFE (IT IS ) one should view what s=e says and her stories with more than just a healthy 
dose of sckepisim (IMPOSSIBLE TO BELIEVE ONE WORD OUT OF HER MOUTH). FURTHER THE INCENTIVE =F A LARGE 
AMOUNT OF MONEY PAID BY A NEWSPAPER AND OTHERS NO DOUBT ADDED TO =ER COLOURFUL AND UNTURE 
STORIES WHICH IN FACT ARE LAREGELY NOTHING BUT MALI=IOUS FOR HIRE MADE UP STORIES. In addition it i= clear 
that the US lawyers are trying to exploit her to sensationalize thei= profiles and to keep interest in an otherwise old 
story in an attempt to g=me the system as anyone can file a civil suit for anything with a view to t=ying to make a quick 
buck whether their is merit or not in the case. It sho=ld also be noted that at least one of the "lawyers" involved in=this 
unattractive scheme was a partner to a man recently arrested and hasti=y jailed for 50 years for amongst other things 
creating and promoting false=cases and selling them and stealing millions and millions of dollars by sel=ing them to 
unsuspecting investors..he did this by using ex policeman=to create fake cases and faked judges signatures to sign off 
on them amongs= other corrupt illegal and shameless schemes and demonstrated an exploitati=n of the US legal system 
that also used and created fake tvictimsR=7; to promote his illegal and and life destroying fantastical fake untrue s=its. 
4. The Mail on Sunday and other newspapers ran the story about Andrew's rendezvous with 
in Ghislaine 
Maxwell'= London home. These reports said that Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell left the Duke of York and 
alone for several hours, and that the next morning Ghislaine Maxwell told 
that the Duke had a 
good time. Would Ghislaine please comment on this story. What did the Duke tell Ghislaine about his rendezvous with 
SEE ABOVE 
5. The Mail on Sunday said it had evidence to support 
story—flight logs from Jeffrey Epstein's 
Boeing=727 and Gulfstream jet. Was Ghislaine Maxwell on these airplanes and who else was onboard?

TO REMEMBER ANY SPECIFIC FLIGHT GOING TO ANY GIVEN PLACE AND WHO WAS ON BOA=D OR NOT ON ANY GIVEN 
PLANE AT ANY GIVEN TIME FOR FLIGHTS THAT ALEDEG=DLY TOOK PLACE OVER 10 YEARS AGO IS SIMPLY UNREALISITC 
6. According to a sworn deposition by Juan Alessi, a former employee at Jeffrey Epstein's Palm Beach estate, Prince 
Andrew attended naked<=R> pool parties and was treated to massages by a harem of adolescent girls.

That's it for now. 
I hope that you can arrange for me to speak directly to Ghislaine. 
All the best,
