Might it be possible to use the kits, have the kits brought back to the US and shipped to you from the US for processing.... would that work?

You will receive email notifications on all updates to the request. Reply to this email to add a comment to the request. Taylor, Jun 28, 2:51 PM PDT: Hello_ The 23andMe Personal Genome Service that may be purchased through our US online store is only available for purchase in the United States and must be used in, and returned for analysis from within, the United States in order for us to comply with applicable laws. I apologize if this was unclear to you at the time of your purchase. This is specifically addressed in the 23andMe Terms of Service, which customers must agree to in placing an order. Section 10 states: "You may not use the Services outside of the country to which your sample collection kit was shipped from 23andMe." You can find the full text of our Terms of Service here: https://www.23andme.com/about/tos/ At this time, I am required to invalidate all sample kits in your recent order as we cannot provide the US version of the Personal Genome Service outside of the United States. I have processed a full refund for your kits to the purchasing payment method. You should see this refund reflected on your statement within 7-10 business days. We do not currently offer our services in the United Arab Emirates, and cannot support the use of our service in your region at this time. I apologize for any inconvenience EFTA_R1_00948973 EFTA02218040 and appreciate your understanding that these policies are in place to ensure we are complying with applicable laws. Regards, Taylor The 23andMe Team Jun 21, 10:28 AM PDT: Hello Taylor. Sultan had been waiting already for the kits so he did not want to wait any longer...I had them loaded on a Emirates plane and flown to Dubai upon the arrival of the kits...so we cannot return them! I don't ir really know what else to do from here. Unless there . l a discount you could offer per a kit for the mistake? ...but the kits are hopefully in use already! Taylor, Jun 21, 10:06 AM PDT: Hello My sincere apologies for the delayed response. In the event you are still interested in receiving a refund for your Health + Ancestry kit order, please let me know and I can follow-up with your @gmail.com email in a separate ticket. My apologies if the previous link did not load your preferred kit type into the order page. You'll be able to purchase 30 new Ancestry Service kits at the online store through the following link: https://store.23andme.cornicart/?ancestrykit 30 Let me know if you have any additional questions, or if you would like to proceed with a refund for your Health + Ancestry kit order. Best regards, Taylor The 23andMe Team Jun 9, 9:44 AM PDT: to know the order has shipped! Thank you so much for your help... ...in the link you sent me however it was for the dual kit so I assumed that was what the order was originally EFTA_R1_00948974 EFTA02218041 placed for...I have told Sultan the new order was placed for Health and Ancestry at $199 per kit...Sultan said he really only wanted ancestry at $99 per kit...I am not sure what to do here... I know Sultan would like these kits as soon as possible since we have been going back and forth for a few weeks... I hate to ask, but is it possible for me to place an order for the 30 ancestry kits only at $99 each and when we receive the 30 Health + Ancestry kits we send them back? Can you issue a call tag? Taylor, Jun 9, 9:34 AM PDT: I'm happy to confirm that your new order has shipped, and you can track its status via USPS here: Your order includes 30 Health + Ancestry Service kits for use in the United States.

I am going to ask my employer if I may use his cc details instead....I will get back to you as soon as I hear from him... Jun 8, 8:43 AM PDT: excellent! I am doing it now! Be in touch shortly Taylor, Jun 8, 8:41 AM PDT: Hello You are free to enter identical personalizations for the kits if you wish. The original personalization on each sample kit is meant to help customers organize multiple kits, but will not necessarily correspond with the name of the person who will be using the kit in question. Until a sample kit has been registered to a 23andMe account, it can be used by anyone. The registration process will allow the sample kit to be associated with the name of the person providing the sample. Please let me know when you have completed your order. EFTA_R1_00948976 EFTA02218043 Best regards, Taylor The 23andMe Team Jun 8, 8:39 AM PDT: Taylor, Sutlan says last time he merely entered his name for all 30 kits...once he receive the kits he would then have each individual person register each individual kit...OK to proceed like this? Jun 8, 8:27 AM PDT: ok, understood...I will coordinate with Sultan. Taylor, Jun 8, 8:23 AM PDT: Hello We are unable to process orders over the phone, or place orders on a customer's behalf. If you would like to place an order for 30 kits, you will need to enter a name for each kit at our store cart. You can use the link below to automatically add 30 kits to your cart, which will then need to each have a name or personalization entered: https://store.23andme.com/cart/?kit=30 Please let me know when you have completed your order so that I may monitor its fulfillment and ensure the order is completed. Best regards, Taylor The 23andMe Team Jun 8, 6:47 AM PDT: o morning Taylor. May I please call you to place this order for the 30 kits? I can't seem to figure out how to purchase the kits on line without plugging in names for each kit. The website does not allow me to move on from this function...or can you explain to me how to circumvent the addition of names for each kit? I would really like to get this done today. Thank you, Jun 7, 4:57 AM PDT: EFTA_R1_00948977 EFTA02218044 Good morning Taylor. Sultan would like me to place a completely new order. He has provided me his CC details, a picture of the front an back of the card, his security code and address for the code. Might I be able to place the order directly with you? I do not have the names of each individual who will be using the DNA kits... Jun 6, 3:43 PM PDT: i ay or an thank you so much for getting back to me...Let me alert Sultan and his PA ...I am thinking they are not aware the account has insufficient funds..! I will get back to you as soon as possible. Taylor, Jun 6 3:26 PM PDT: Hello Thank you for following up on this order. The order was approved for shipment by the appropriate teams, however PayPal prevented us from completing this order as there were insufficient funds in the purchasing account. The message our system received was as follows: PayPal gateway has rejected request. Transaction rejected, please contact the buyer (#10606: Buyer cannot pay) We have been attempting to complete this order for a little over a week in the hopes that the payment response would update. Unfortunately, we received a new message earlier today stating that PayPal will not complete the order. As a result, we have cancelled order If you or the original purchaser would like to place a new order, please reply directly to this message immediately after placing the order so I can approve it at our warehouse. Depending on the routing and/or availability of funds in the original PayPal account, you may wish to instead purchase using a credit card. I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this has caused. Please let me know if there's anything I can answer for you at this time. Best regards, Taylor The 23andMe Team EFTA_R1_00948978 EFTA02218045 a Jun 5, 7:34 AM PDT: Hello Taylor. I would like to help Sultan Bin Sulayem facilitate his order of 30 (thirty) "23 and Me" kits he placed an order for on May 21, 2017. You specifically emailed Sultan on May 23, 2017, to find out the use of the 30 kits (you say due to the size of the order you need to find out the intended use for the kits). He would like to give the kits to his co-workders so they too may enjoy investigating their ancestry. (Sultan participated with his own DNA and found it fascinating...he wants the people he works with to participate as well) The kits are to be delivered to: Jeffrey Epstein 9 East 71st Street NY, NY 10021 The kits are to be delivered to Jeffrey's address for ease. We have ordered many kits ourselves as gifts...indeed, Sultan received his personal kit from Jeffrey as a gift. The kits were paid for by Jim Miller who is Sultan's Personal Assistant. Jim has a supplementary credit card that is linked to Sultan's account so he can make purchases in Sultan's name. Please advise what. if any, other information you would like so we may have the kits shipped as soon as possible. If we need to make an entire new order, please let me know so we may do so.
