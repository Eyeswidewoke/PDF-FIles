Actually packing now to get it over with! By the way - lock seems fine now but it was "acting up" the first day. Very odd. Hope your vacation was relaxing and hope to be able to enjoy Chez Slay again soon. Preferably when JE is around!!! > Sent from my iPhone » On Aug 9, 2017, at 7:57 AM, wrote: >> >> Morning!
