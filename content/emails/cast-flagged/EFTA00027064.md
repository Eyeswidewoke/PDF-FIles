> this I will have sen me an email saying Something like this. Edit it for me. The SDNY requests approval for travel by AUSA to the U.K. from October xx to October Yu, 2020. This travel is required at this time as Ms. will be conducting an interview of victim/witness in the case against Glaine Maxwell. The victim was a victim of Jeffrey Epstein. She will only talk to us person and it is necessary for us to get her statement on the record to preserve the government's right to use her at trial. Please approve her travel to the U.K. Acting United States Attorney. Sent from my iPad On Oct 16,
