Samples of each what? As I say, the goal is for the output, say for the trust presentation, to appear in the Elysium-
designated format. We have a format that we and Leon are happy with. Our goal is to have each system replicate that 
report, more or less, in a convenient way. We show the vendor a report format and ask them to demonstrate that they 
can replicate it. 
Also, we have dozens of report types. 
So while we can ask our vendors to send us a sample, off the shelf balance sheet, it's not something we would likely ever 
look at. Once we pick the vendor, we would customize it into our format. 
Would you like to see the formats that we currently use? 
Feel free to call me if I'm not understanding you.

financial statements and be appropriately tagged in a database for future retrieval and slicing/dicing type analyses.

We are working with a consultant to upgrade our accounting system, which is currently Quickbooks. So we are seeing a 
wide variety. 
Our approach is mostly the following: "We like our presentations. How can we automate them?" 
I think you are saying the same thing on the second point. Are you also saying that you think the presentation formats 
can be improved? If so, it would be helpful to know which ones, so we can get examples of alternative styles. We have 
numerous formats for various types of reports.
