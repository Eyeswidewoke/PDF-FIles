Despite China's rhetoric, ASEAN nations are genuinely alarmed and are looking to the United States for succor and support. The U.S. — having confronted China and injected itself into the issue via U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's speech at the ARF Foreign Minister's meeting in Hanoi in July 2010 — is only too happy to help — at least verbally and with signals that militaries understand. The great irony is that none of this was necessary for China. Its problem with the U.S., or vice versa, concerns the intellige

Setting Sail on Gaza's Sea of Spin 
Ethan Bronner 
July 2, 2011 -- SOME see a parallel with the Exodus, the ship filled 
with Jewish refugees that tried to break the British blockade of 
Palestine in 1947 and helped sway world opinion toward Zionism. 
Others are struck by the insistence on transporting basic aid — food 
and cement — when it is no longer needed. Still others note the way 
the Israeli authorities portray the organizers as violent Islamists when 
most are middle-aged European pacifists. 
Almost everything about the flotilla stuck in Greece and waiting to 
challenge Israel's blockade of Gaza seems to be a parable for 
something else, part of an unstated effort to recast the Israeli-
Palestinian narrative in extreme terms. Instead of helping to clarify 
what Gaza needs and how it might build a future, the saga has merely 
brought out the public relations demons on all sides. 
Ostensibly the 10 or so boats, with several hundred advocates from 
more than a dozen countries, are trying to take goods to Gaza because 
of a siege imposed by Israel and Egypt to pressure Hamas, the 
Islamist ruler there. A year ago a similar flotilla was stopped by the 
Israeli Navy, and after commandos boarded and scuffles ensued, nine 
activists were killed. 
The international outrage that followed helped force an easing of the 
siege. One result, largely unacknowledged by the flotilla leaders: far 
more goods have gone into Gaza over the past year, and while the 1.6 
million people there still need many things, basic supplies are not 
among them. 
Israel is therefore quick to say that Gaza is well provided for and does 
not need any flotilla. If it still wants to bring in aid, it should take it

to either Israel or Egypt and it will be delivered by truck. Sea access 
must remain blocked to prevent weapons smuggling. 
The Israeli position defies a brutal truth: last year's flotilla made a big 
difference for the people of Gaza — at a terrible cost in lives — by 
refocusing international attention on their plight and forcing a change 
in Israeli policy. Today, twice as many goods enter from Israel as 
before. Nonetheless, Gaza remains a deeply sad and deprived place. 
"The focus on humanitarian aid by both flotilla organizers and the 
Israeli government is infuriating and misleading," Gisha, an Israeli 
human rights group focused on Gaza, said in a statement. "There is 
no shortage of food in Gaza, but economic recovery is blocked by 
sweeping restrictions." 
The Exodus analogy supports a certain political and public relations 
strategy. In July 1947, when Britain ruled Palestine and the number 
of Jews allowed in was severely limited, the ship, with 4,500 Jewish 
refugees from Europe, tried to get through. British forces boarded it, 
killed three people, wounded dozens and essentially destroyed the 
ship as it listed in Haifa harbor. 
The British ultimately sent the passengers to Hamburg. The sight of 
thousands of Jewish refugees shipped to Germany soon after the 
Holocaust sparked international outrage and sympathy for the Zionist 
cause, a key goal of the trip. "The Exodus showed that if the British 
are callous enough to send Jews back to Germany, the only ones who 
should be in charge of the fate of the Jews are the Jews themselves," 
observed M. M. Silver, an Israeli historian and the author of "Our 
Exodus." "Palestinian forces are trying to make the same point 
through the flotilla, that Israel has no right to control the fate of 
Palestinians." 
Several months after the Exodus, the United Nations General 
Assembly voted for the establishment of two states in Palestine, 
Jewish and Arab, the key diplomatic moment in Israel's history. The

Palestinian leadership rejected that resolution, but this September 
plans to ask the United Nations for recognition of its statehood with 
the 1967 lines, a move strongly opposed by Israel. 
Israel, for its part, has been campaigning against the flotilla and 
perhaps doing more — some of the boats have suffered sabotage. 
Israel says the Exodus is the wrong analogy; the flotilla is aimed at 
delegitimizing Israel and killing its soldiers. 
"The flotilla is entirely designed to attack Israel's image around the 
world," said Yuli Edelstein, minister for public diplomacy. "We 
know that there are representatives of different terror groups on their 
way to join the flotilla." 
Israeli military officials have told newspapers that some flotilla 
participants plan to pour sacks of sulfur on Israeli commandos and set 
them afire. The flotilla organizers have denied it. 
A government news release noted that Mr. Edelstein had participated 
in a simulation exercise for the flotilla in which Israeli forces were 
attacked. The description of the simulation indicates how the 
government expects the harsh information war to play out: "As the 
events were taking place, the media — with emphasis on the Internet, 
Facebook and Twitter — were flooded with mendacious reports (by 
private users, Hamas and others among Israel's enemies)." 
Mendacity has already reared its head. An Israeli actor put up a 
YouTube clip saying that he was a gay activist rejected by the flotilla 
because of his sexual orientation. The video was exposed as a fake. 
Israeli officials, who had promoted the clip on Twitter and Facebook, 
said they had been duped. But suspicions remained since the clip's 
production quality was high and officials had long used the talking 
point that Hamas and other Islamist groups were intolerant of 
homosexuality. 
The Turkish group I.H.H., which helps sponsor the flotillas, has ties 
to Hamas, and Israeli and Western concern that violence could occur

if the flotilla sets sail does not seem far-fetched, despite the 
organizers' vows to the contrary. 
So the flotilla has virtually no support in Israel. Still, some are 
uncomfortable with the way the project has been criticized as an 
attack on Israel itself. 
Shlomo Avineri, a historian and onetime director general of Israel's 
foreign ministry, wrote in the Haaretz newspaper last week that when 
the flotilla is described as aimed at delegitimizing Israel, he recalls 
the Soviet Union's reaction to any criticism as an assault on its right 
to exist. Opposition to Israeli policy is not the same as an attack on its 
existence, he said, and the government's approach damages Israel. 
His argument about the flotilla points to the larger dynamic: the 
Israeli-Palestinian dispute is increasingly disintegrating from a debate 
over borders and security into a battle between those claiming that 
Israel is a genocidal machine and those who dismiss every attack on 
its policy as an assault on its essence.

5 Lessons of the DSK Affair 
Bernard-Henri Levy 
July 2, 2011 -- The Strauss-Kahn affair is not over. 
For it to be over, the American system of justice must pursue its 
investigation and work to the very end. 
If it's truly to be over, Dominique Strauss-Kahn must be granted not 
only his freedom, but—even more importantly—restoration of his 
honor. 
In other words, "the Strauss-Kahn affair" will continue to be regarded 
as such as long as it hasn't been clearly established that there never 
was any affair at all—and that the plaintiff, not content to have lied 
about this or that aspect of her past, also lied in accusing the former 
head of the IMF of having raped her. 
And yet, given recent revelations, we can already draw a few lessons 
from what will ultimately—no doubt very soon—be known as the 
Strauss-Kahn non-affair. 
1. The cannibalisation of Justice by the Sideshow. 
This cannibalisation is not exclusively an American phenomenon, of 
course, and we have witnessed myriad examples of it in Europe and 
France. But it must be said that, with this affair, it has reached the 
heights of obscenity. The improvised press conference by the 
woman's lawyer on the steps of a courthouse normally dedicated to 
the sober discernment of the truth was obscene. The "shame on 
you's" that greeted Dominique Strauss-Kahn as he arrived for the 
hearing on June 6th, shouted by battalions of hotel chambermaids 
who knew nothing of the actual case and whose protest had been 
orchestrated and scripted, were obscene. And so, too, though in 
another manner, was the famous "perp walk" which, I'm aware, is the

lot of all those charged with a crime, but which, given the identity of 
the accused in question, could only degenerate into globally observed 
torture—high punishment for a crime, which no one, at that point, 
knew whether or not he had committed. 
This vision of Dominique Strauss-Kahn humiliated in chains, 
dragged lower than the gutter—this degradation of a man whose 
silent dignity couldn't be touched, was not just cruel, it was 
pornographic. And it was at least as pornographic (because, I repeat, 
it's the same thing) as attorney Kenneth Thompson's visible glee in 
expounding on the state of his client's "vagina" [sic] before the entire 
world. 
2. The Robespierrism of this judicial sideshow. 
What is Robespierrism? It's a word taken from the French 
Revolution,
