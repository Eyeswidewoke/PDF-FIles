This gallery and tattoo studio is a reflection of my lifelong interest in diverse modes of artistic expression, and my conviction that art is not a luxury but a sublime human need. I hope this space speaks to you on an aesthetic, visceral, and personal level. I created this space to bring together the different strands of my life as an artist. Born and raised in Texas, I moved to New York to attend The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art. Since graduating, I have cultivated my fine art while simultaneously working as a tattoo artist in NYC anda€" abroad. For 16 years I have worked closely with clients to create personal and intimate works of art that they will carry with them on their skin throughout their lives. I am continually struck by the transformative power of the tattoo, an art form that seems to address the spiritual as well as the aesthetic realms. My fine artwork is created with a technique of drawing by burning marks on paper with fireworks and other volatile materials. These techniques are rooted in one of humankinda€Th's earliest technologies: fire, and as such they speak to something elemental in the human condition. Inspired by cosmology and the interconnection between terrestrial and celestial fires, my drawings become a record of their creation, a map pointing to the reason for human existence, or rather the outer limits, the infinite, the space not yet grasped. These two means of creating 6€" tattooing and burning-- have a unique synergy, as they both entail physical and ritualistic processes of mark-making while transforming matter/people. Senaspace is a unified platform in which both are presented and accomplished, and will also regularly feature expositions, projects and guest spots by local and international artists in all mediums. 2 EFTA_R1_01231856 EFTA02321412 David Sena Click to view this email in a browser If you no longer wish to receive these emails, please reply to this message with "Unsubscribe" in the subject line or simply click on the following link: Unsubscribe Senaspace Fine Art Gallery & Private Tattoo Studio Read the VerticalResponse marketing policy. 3 EFTA_R1_01231857 EFTA02321413 4 EFTA_R1_01231858 EFTA02321414 |
