In the meantime, Jeffrey would like you to redo the walls in my office =n the 5th floor at his NY house. I'm not sure what the design should be =et, perhaps you can suggest a few things? we can touch base once your =ack in NY. thanks and see you soon.. sarah=?xml version=.0" encoding=TF-8"?> <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"> <plist version=.0"> <dict> <key>date-sent</key> <real>1315846233</real> <key>flags</key> <integer>196609</integer> <key>remote-id</key> <string>5955</string> <key>subject</key> <string></string> </dict> </plist> 1 EFTA_R1_01243494 EFTA02325297 |
