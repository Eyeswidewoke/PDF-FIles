Jock will send us a full report on Monday 4/11. Notes from Jock =isted below G51 Generator: -WARNING- Poor condition- severe corrosion Need to be =orked on asap. Main issues with SDMO/Kohler products are that they =lways have electrical issues. Corrosion to any electrical lines and =lugs can cause it to catch on fire or melt. GSJ Generator has a fuel =eak, coolant leak, exhaust leak and it needs a oil sensor. The filters =re already bad and all the lines to and from need to be ran through =onduits. This type of generator should not be outside 1st LS1 Generator: Great Generators but poor =aintenance. We need all new air/oil filters, it has an =il leak, coolant leak & exhaust leak. We need Insulation and =entilation ducks replaced 2nd LSJ =enerator: Running good but could be great after New air =amp; oil filters are changed 2 EFTA_R1_01298234 EFTA02337131 Fuel Truck: =br class="">Desperately needs a shed. The salt air is =ating up everything and causing more damage than we think. Needs bi =onthly service or every 250hrs Fuel =tation: Looks good. No real issues but we need to stick =ith a maintenance plan because of the salt air 3 EFTA_R1_01298235 EFTA02337132 4 EFTA_R1_0 1298236 EFTA02337133 Ann =.
