She is very good and attentive. She will come on Thursday at 2 PM. I forgot to tell her to take the towels for the laundry. But as she will change the linen, I hope she will take also the towels. If you happen to talk to her, please - just remind her. Waiting to know concerning a possible meeting. Thanks, Nili Nib Priell Barak EFTA_R1_00958831 EFTA02221726 |
