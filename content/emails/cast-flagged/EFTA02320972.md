I had the same idea as Jeffrey and am trying to arrange to get a video this afternoon. If I can't, I will call Janusz and arrange to meet him there tomorrow. Can you give me his cell number? I will also send a set of floor plans. Assuming they would arrive Wednesday, where should I send them. Thanks. Paul Ori inal Messa e |
