PRINCE ANDREW 
Tense yesterday. 
I took $$ 
from perv: 
Fergie 
. Duchess of York Sarah 
Ferguson yesterday ad-
mitted she took cash from 
pervert billionaire Jeffrey 
Epstein in a mini-bailout 
brokered through Prince 
Andrew's office. 
Fergie said Epstein — a 
longtime personal pal of 
Andrew's — coughed up 
$24,000 to pay off money 
owed to a former Sarah as-
sistant. 
Epstein offered his help 
after speaking to her ex-
hubby, who "sorted out 
my debts," Ferguson said. 
Prince Andrew is under 
pressure in Britain to stop 
palling around with Ep-
stein, a Level 3 sex of-
fender who was recently 
sprung from jail. 
Epstein copped to solic-
iting sex from girls as 
young as 14 and has paid 
millions to settle lawsuits. 
Fergie 
apologized 
for 
taking Epstein's cash infu-
sion, calling it "a gigantic 
error of judgment."

WAITING: Officers Franklin Mata (left) ant
Rape case 
By LAURA ITALIAN° 
Manhattan prosecutors yester-
day admitted that they failed to 
present a key piece of evidence 
to grand jurors in the case of two 
cops 
accused 
of 
raping 
a 
dninken female cluhgoer they 
had escorted home. 
The embarrassing revelation 
came as jury selection was about 
to begin in the case against Offi-
cers Kenneth Moreno and Frank-
lin Mata and was met by a stern 
rebuke from Manhattan Supreme 
Court Justice Gregory Carte, 
who was clearly annoyed that 
prosecutors had waited until the 
very last minute to admit their 
blunder and ask for a two-week 
delay so they could re-present 
the case to a new grand jury. 
jury selection had been. sch.ed7 
tiled to begin rod.
