| **Sent** | June 27, 2011 3:45:12 PM EDT To Dear Br=an, I am assuming your clients are after the panels that are o= the ceiling in the Haus Tambaran at the Met. These are made on Sago p=athe and I do have a few pieces. They are not in great shape. H=wever the panels are easy to get as they still use them. It would jus= take time to get them here. A elderly man called David from th= village paints them. David does good work. I will attach photo= of several photos of David's panels I put in a show and sale in Berkeley r=cently. Unfortunately/fortunately they all sold. I could ask Da=id to make 30 panels. It might be better to give the measurements of t=e area to be covered as the panels vary in size. There is also a younger man call Nanias who does beautiful painting=and I will include a few pictures of his that he painted on cardboard. &nbs=; He can also do the panels. Nanias knows all the stories behind=the paintings and can write them down. 1= would take about 6 months to get the panels to the USA. They would c=st you approx $200 each depending on the freight. EFTA_R1_01239710 EFTA02324156 I hope this is of help. Best 2 EFTA_R1_01239711 EFTA02324157 |
