| **Subject** | Re: Bin Ennakhil Dear Alex, I am sure you are aware that thi= "real estate contract" is highly irregular for Americans. &=bsp; 1. It is not a real estate contract, it is a purchase of a= offshore entity, creating many complexities for americans. &nb=p; 2. There was never any discussion about real estate fees=on top of the price. We have bought many properties, including through Chri=ties and a commission was always paid by seller. <=iv dir="ltr">3.=The due diligence on a lichtenstein co. will take months. 4. We would have to be indemnified for all taxes due to morrocca= government on transfer and unknown liabiltiles of the co., especially as y=u might imagine, this purchase would be very high profile. = 5. Is there a title on file? who would guarantee title transfer= If Christies is willing that might work. 6. We were hopi=g for a quick closing. With this structure it is not possible, and money wo=ld need to be withheld for years to back up the indemnity. It is very=disappointing. We are told that liabilties would extend approx 7 years, so a=payment of 10m day one and 2 milliion per year for 8 years might work. Ther= clearly is no perfect title transfer under your proposed structure. =our jurisdictions, real estate and corporate and disclosure rules in each. C=n you make a suggestion? Thank you. =div dir="ltr")<=r> Best regards, Karyna On Feb 15, 2019, at 9:36 AM, Alex Peto rote: The vendor will not accept less than 25m euros net to him -=our agency fees can either be paid by you or by the vendor but if he pays t=en the price would need to be 26m euros. We have a list of what items he intends to remove - i= is not much but for example there is a Gauguin in the bedroom which of cou=se he will remove - I will get this list and sent it to you. It is not possible to only buy t=e asset and it does save you 7% in government taxes - your lawyers can chec= the company has no liabilities but I assure you anyway it doesn't.=/div> you.
