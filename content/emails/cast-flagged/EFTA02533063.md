Duchess of debt: Fergie's ultimatum to her creditors... Accept a quarte= of what I owe you or risk getting NOTHING

Much as it pains the Royal Family - in this of all months - the cameras are=once more turning on the Duchess of York. 
She is beginning, yet again, the=process of dragging herself up from that place where she says she has been=residing in 
recent times - 'the gutter'. 
As it happens, in Fergie's case the '=utter' remains the sumptuously comfortable Royal Lodge in Windsor =reat Park, of 
which she is said to be still 'very much the mistres=' after four years lodging there with ex-husband Prince Andrew. Mi=d 
you, these days she has to make do without the dozen or so personal staf= who used to be at her beck and call. 
With Windsor Castle looming ominously in the backgrou=d, Fergie has been filming the six-part documentary examining 
her downfall= Finding Sarah, which she is contracted to make for Oprah Winfrey'= new TV network in America. 
Pleasant debt? Fergie, pictured here for America's Harper's Bazaar,=remains 'very much the mistress' of the Royal Lodge 
in Windsor Gre=t Park 
Whether this turns out to be a personal sto=y of downfall and dishonour, or survival and redemption, we must wait and 
=ee. But at 51, the trampoline life of the Duchess does seem to have her bo=ncing skywards once more, though where 
she will land is anyone's g=ess. 
Fergie has been working hard on the television series= in which she will examine her own battles with those who have 
been closes= to her, with her weight and, of course, with money. She is currently livi=g 'quietly — no big nights out' 
according to someo=e who sees her regularly. 
Most people would consider this highly sensible, in v=ew of the tricky and at times bitter negotiations that have been 
going on =ith the Duchess's creditors. Debts of almost £2 million remai=ed even after Prince Andrew initially bailed her 
out with £1.5 millio= of his own money earlier this year.

Now, as the Mail revealed this week, the Duchess, in an extraordinary move,=seems to have managed to sidestep the 
bankruptcy proceedings, which would =ave been an unsavoury diversion in royal wedding year, given that her two 
=aughters will be sitting on the family pews at Westminster Abbey on April =9. So just how has she done it? 
We understand that Fergie's creditors have be=n made an audacious offer of just 25 per cent in settlement of the 
money t=ey are owed - in other words, 25p in every pound. 
The offer was sent to them in letters and emails on behalf =f the hard-nosed City accountant Price WaterhouseCoopers, 
who were engaged=by Prince Andrew to get to grips with his ex-wife's finances. It s=t a deadline for acceptance of 
October 20 this year. 
What's more, it was conditional on all of the= accepting it. Indeed, the letter spelled out that in the event of there n=t 
being universal acceptance, the Duchess might have to recourse to an =80 individual voluntary arrangement' to pay 
what she can over a =eriod of five years. This could mean, the letter warned, that creditors mi=ht receive less than they 
were being offered now. 
The offer of a mere quarter of what they were owed di=mayed some creditors. In the event, most have accepted the 
deal, but two h=ve refused to settle. The amount they were owed is understood to total aro=nd £150,000, and this debt 
could still derail the entire process and =lunge Fergie back into bankruptcy proceedings. 
Ironically, the two dissenters, we have learned, were=not the swanky Mayfair lawyers Davenport Lyons (£204,000) or 
Selfridg=s in Oxford Street (£51,000) that featured high on the list of credit=rs — but are from among the Duchess's 
most intimate circle= One of them, we understand, is Kate Waddington, the Duchess's close=friend for nearly 20 years 
and her long-time public relations consultant u=til they parted company over the humiliating tabloid sting in which 
Fergie=attempted to sell access to 
Prince Andrew in exchange for £500,000. 
The other is Johnny O'Sullivan, a 42-year-old bachelor who worked f=r the Duchess as a personal assistant for 14 years 
until last year, and no= lives in the U.S. Like Ms Waddington, he counted the Duchess as a friend.=/div> 
Likely dissenter: Kate Waddington (left), who was Sarah Ferguson's clos=st friend for nearly 20 years Indeed, O'Sullivan 
was the person whom Fergie referred to when she =as filmed accepting a £27,000 down payment from the undercover 
newspa=er reporter posing as a businessman anxious to get alongside government tr=de envoy Andrew. When her 
desperate ploy was exposed, the Duchess explaine= she wanted the money to help O'Sullivan meet the fees for a 
postg=aduate course at a New York university he had enrolled on. 
What did not emerge at that time was that O'S=Ilivan was among Fergie's biggest private creditors. 
She is thought to have owed him more than £70,00., made up of unpaid salary and fees as well as cash, which he 
invested in =artmoor, the company she founded to control her business interests in the =S. and which folded with debts 
of £650,000. 
O'Sullivan refuses to talk about the matter, =ut according to friends he is 'very hurt' that he has been=offered so little, 
especially as the money he used to help Fergie'= business was his life savings.

Kate Waddington is equally adamant that she will not =iscuss what is clearly a distressing situation for her on a personal 
level=and a financial one. She has had a ringside seat for most of the turbulent=events in Sarah's life, from her 
separation and her affairs to the=rollercoaster of her financial crises. She was at first on Fergie'= private staff before 
leaving to set up her own PR company, Soho-based Spu=nik Communications, in 1998 which then represented Sarah as a 
client. =A0 
And in recent times she also took on the Duchess =80 s socially energetic daughters, Princess Beatrice, 22, and 20-year-
ol= Princess Eugenie. We understand Ms Waddington is owed upwards of £70=000. If she accepted the offer from 
Fergie's advisers, she would r=ceive a mere £18,000. 
All the same, Miss Waddington does not consider her d=spute is with the Duchess, who is her daughter Flora's 
godmother. =ccording to a Buckingham Palace source intimately involved in the negotiat=ons, her fury is directed at 
Prince Andrew. 
This source says Ms Waddington has made it plain she =eels Andrew has not recognised all the work she has done for his 
two daugh=ers. 
For several years, Sputnik employed someone virtually=full-time on the Duchess's account, when much of the work 
involved=the princesses, whose activities required constant organising and public r=lations guidance. 
'Nine times out of ten, Andrew's offi=e would ask Kate's firm to handle things,' says the Palace=insider. 
Meanwhile, Fergie's advisers are trying to br=ng the overall debt down by scrutinising and challenging some bills from 
c=rtain creditors. 
But these are relatively small fry. 'Without =artmoor, she would not have been in this situation; says one advi=er. 
For Prince Andrew, who drily describes himself as a m=n 'with three children' to look after, this is a tense per=od. He put 
his hand into his own pocket to help the woman from whom he has=been divorced for 14 years after ten years of 
marriage, because he knew hi= daughters expected him to help out their mother. 
'Beatrice and Eugenie would have been very up=et if he hadn't helped out their mother - and so would the Queen,=E2 
says a courtier. 
'It is still a source of some concern, and a =istraction for the girls who are both at university. The general feeling i= that 
the sooner this mess is cleared up, the better for everyone. =99 
Andrew's contribution helped pay off her doze= 'personal staff' who were made redundant in the spring wh=n Fergie's 
finances finally spiralled out of control. 
The way they were: Prince Andrew and Fergie together at Upton House in 1992=to see their daughter Beatrice, four, in a 
nativity play Fergie can no longer employ her own staff - but, as ever, friends continue =o ride to her rescue. One is John 
Caudwell, the mobile phone tycoon and on= of Britain's richest men. His daughter Libby has, we understand, =een 
helping the Duchess with her charities. 
Also still on the scene is Geir Frantzen, the Norwegi=n frozen food magnate who gave Fergie the £160,000 Bentley she 
can st=lI be seen being driven in. He is understood to have offered her a bolthol= for Christmas. 
Fergie is dreaming now that her Oprah series will ope= doors to a new television career. And she is still hoping her Little 
Red =hildren's book about a red-headed girl will be made into a series =f money-spinning cartoons.

She also plans to kick-start herself on the lucrative=after-dinner speaking circuit. 
Certainly, she will have to go into high-earning mode if she is to continue=not only flying first class but routinely arriving 
at airports with 25 pie=es of luggage. 
But even Fergie has her standards. She was offered, we can reveal, a =98monster' sum - believed to be 'well to the 
north of =A3200,000' - to join the so-called celebs in ITV's I =99m A Celebrity ... Get Me Out Of Here! =he declined. 
She also declined lucrative offers from American tele=ision networks to join the commentary team for the wedding of 
Prince Willi=m to Kate Middleton, a job for which you might think she is eminently qual=fied. She is, of course, unlikely 
to be on the guest list. 
But beca
