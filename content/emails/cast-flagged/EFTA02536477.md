The long list of women is punctuated by regular references to =b>Epstein's celebrity friends including the 
business magnate Donald =rump, film producer Harvey Weinstein, magician David Copperfield, referred=to as 'Magic 
David'. 
The sheer volume of phone traffic shows the frequency of Ep=tein's massages, many of which were 'erotic' and 
allegedly invol=ed the abused girls. 
The evidence is f=om documents confiscated by police during a criminal investigation into and seen yesterday by 
the Mail. 
One message left for Epstein reads: 'She is wondering=if 2.30 ok cuz she needs to stay in school.' 
It was left in February 2005 — the same=year that the mother of a 14-year-old girl alerted police to Epstein 
Another note shows that 'Colleen' p=oned to tell Epstein: 'Going into class —will be out in 45 min=' 
Someone called Tatum is mentioned regularly in the logs. A not= for Epstein from her says: 'Has girl for tonight.' 
<= class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"> Caroline rang to say: 'I need work. I d=n't have money. Do 
you have some work for me?' 
=nd Amanda phoned to ask Epstein 'if she should bring her friend H=Ily with tonight'. 
Some of the messages appear to show the girls' affection for=Epstein, such as Tatyana called to say goodnight'. 
<= class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"> Last night the Daily Mail tried to contac= the people whose 
names and telephone numbers are included in the logs. 
One girl named Jenny, who had left her number, hung =p immediately when asked about Epstein. 
A man listed only as Darren said: 'Ma'am, I have no commen= to make on that.' 
Another number left by someone=called Aria was answered by a girl who spoke only Turkish.
