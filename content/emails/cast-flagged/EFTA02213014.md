Who ordered the 30 kits and I will ask them? I merely received the phone call from Mike at the airport stating "a acka c from Jeffrey to Al Maktoum" can be put on a plane today. Mike said he was to call before sending. I didn't want to say yes to sending a pkg until I cleared this with you? Karyna? I was not aware of any package and don't want to send things out under your name without asking first! Please advise if I should call Mike/Igor back and tell then yes to putting in the direct flight to Dubai today.
