I =eave town on Sunday morning and won't be back until the 28th, but you =ould work on some samples for me next week. I have a piece of leather =hich I want to match the color for the bedroom; a very dark taupe =olor. I can leave it with my doorman for you to collect so you can work =n a sample. My new apt is DJ. You are welcome to work there is you =ish.. it's empty and still a work site... up to you. For the =iving room I want something very neutral with perhaps a slight design =n it kind of like Jeffrey's gym in NY on the 4th floor.. not sure if =ou've seen that room or not. The walls are an off white color but have = bit of a geometric design with different shades of the same color. I =an send pics as well I will also leave you with the =ample of the wood floors which will be going into the living room so =ou can work with that coloring. Thanks and welcome =ack!
