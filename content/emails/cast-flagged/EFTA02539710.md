we stick to written responses rather than engage via 'phone. Klein has form for story-twisting re Hillary Clinton. Written 
responses at least give us an audit trail of what was said. 
A lot of this is Mail on Sunday rehash. Klein has our statement, but is offering the chance for further clarification...I get 
the feeling he's likely to make unflattering assumptions if we don't give him on the record answers. 
Please advise on those questions which you feel you more comfortable answering. We can head him off at the pass on 
those and put legal frighteners on him elsewhere. 
Just a caveat - we should be aware that there is a chance that anything other than fully robust answers might be 
construed as inadvertent admissions of wrongdoing, so we will need legal team to advise on precise wording. Do you 
want me to pass this on to Devonshires if you have not already done so...?

Dear Ross, 
Here are some fact-checking questions for Ghislaine Maxwell to comment on and answer: 
1. Do Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell share a home in London or anywhere else? Do they still see each other? 
Does Epstein help support Ghislaine? Her friends tell me that Ghislaine once loved Epstein. Does she still love him? 
MS MAXWELL DOES NO SHARE ANY HOMES WITH MR EPSTEIN. MR EPSTEIN DOES NOT SUP=ORT MS MAXWELL IN 
ANYWAY. MS MAXWELL HAD INFACT BEEN IN COMMITTED RELATIONS=IP WITH SOMEONE ELSE FOR THE PAST 7 YEARS 
2. The Mail on Sunday published a photograph showing the Duke of York with his arm around 
Standing 
off to one side in the=BR> photo was Ghislaine Maxwell. The newspaper said that this photo taken in Ghislaine's London 
home. Was it? Did Jeffrey Epstein take the photo? If not, who did? 
MS MAXWELL HAS NO RECOLECTION OF THE PHOTO BEING EVEN TAKEN GIVEN WE ARE TA=KING AN EVENT THAT 
ALLEDGEDLY TOOK PLACE OVER 10 YEARS AGO IT WOULD BE SURP=ISING 
3. According to 
Ghislaine Maxwell recruited her as Epstein's "sex slave" when she was 15 years old and 
arran=ed for her to see Andrew three times—at Jeffrey Epstein's homes in London =nd New York and on his private 
Caribbean island, Little Saint James—where, 
said, she'd been "sexually exploited by Epstein'= adult male peers, 
including royalty." Would Ghislaine please comment on this assertion by 
MS MAXWELL MET MS 
TIME WITH HER FIANCE. MS 
HAS A PRIOR S=XUAL HASSARASSMENT SUIT AGAINST OTHER INDIVIDUALS THAT 
WAS THROWN OUT FOR L=CK OF HER CREDABILITY AND DRUG USE. MS 
FINALLY FLED THE US TO 
AVOID=ARREST FOR THEFT. I THINK GIVEN THIS AND OTHER HIGHLY INDICATIVE EVENTS IN =ER LIFE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO 
WHEN SHE WAS 17 AND WAS HIRED AS A MASSUSE.=MS 
WAS LIVING AT THE 
EFTA_R1_01688278 
EFTA02539710

BELIEVE ONE WORD OUT OF HER MOUTH. FURTHER THE =NCENTIVE OF A LARGE AMOUNT OF MONEY PAID BY A 
NEWSPAPER NO DOUBT ADDED TO H=R COLOURFUL 'MEMORIES' WHICH IN FACT ARE NOTHING BUT MADE UP ST=RIES. 
4. The Mail on Sunday and other newspapers ran the story about Andrew's rendezvous with 
in Ghislaine 
Maxwell'= London home. These reports said that Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell left the Duke of York and 
alone for several hours, and that the next morning Ghislaine Maxwell told 
that the Duke had a 
good time. Would Ghislaine please comment on this story. What did the Duke tell Ghislaine about his rendezvous with 
5. The Mail on Sunday said it had evidence to support 
story—flight logs from Jeffrey Epstein's 
Boeing=727 and Gulfstream jet. Was Ghislaine Maxwell on these airplanes and who else was onboard? 
AGAIN TO REMEMBER ANY SPECIFIC FLIGHT AND WHO WAS ON BOARD A PLANE FOR EVEN=S THAT ALEDEGEDLY TOOK 
PLACE OVER 10 YEARS AGO IS SIMPLY UNREALISITC 
6. According to a sworn deposition by Juan Alessi, a former employee at Jeffrey Epstein's Palm Beach estate, Prince 
Andrew attended nakedc=R> pool parties and was treated to massages by a harem of adolescent girls. 
MS MAXWELL CANNOT COMMENT ON WHAT MR ALESSI ALLEDEGDLY SAW OR DID NOT SEE B=T MS MAXWELL NEVER 
SAW THE DUKE IN ANY STATE OF UNDRESS AND HE WAS INDEED A=WAYS PROPERLY ATTIRED. 
That's it for now. 
I hope that you can arrange for me to speak directly to Ghislaine. 
All the best, 
Ed
