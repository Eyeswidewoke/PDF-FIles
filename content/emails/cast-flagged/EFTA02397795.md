Hi Nina, 
My role with regard =o Ivory Coast was actually at Geneva Global, the consulting firm where I=still work. Up until about 
18 months ago, I managed a PEPFAR grant that =eneva Global administered in Cdl. I'm now seconded to the Gates 
Foundati=n (though still employed by Geneva Global), and working on private donor=engagement (partnering with 
other private donors who want to support found=tion priorities). 
We actually don't have anyone at the fou=dation who is on point for Ivory Coast. Instead, program officers are 
re=ponsible for the various strategies that support foundation priorities (ie=2C polio, malaria, TB, US secondary 
education, etc...). If you go =o the website, www.gatesfoundation.org <http://www.gatesfoundation.org>, and click on 
"topics" at the right=2C you will see all of the foundation's strategies. This is a very usefu= starting point, as these are 
the only areas that the foundation current=y funds. Then, if you see a topic that is of particular interest, you =an click on 
it to read further about what the foundation is currently supp=rting. You'll notice that a lot of the funding is weighted 
toward resear=h and development, as this is a particular interest of Bill and Melinda=2C and they believe that this is an 
area where the foundation can have a u=ique impact.

So, my advice would be for Mr. Tanoh =0 start there and then to let me know if there is a particular interest,=and I can 
look for the right point person for an introduction, but it'= very much based on the specific topic, as program officers 
work on a st=ategy-basis rather than a geography-basis. Feel free to pass this email al=ng to him. 
Hope that is helpful! 
All the best=2C

I recently s=oke with Mr. Marcel Amon Tanoh, Minister and Chief of Staff of the Presi=ence of Ivory Coast, and he is very 
interested in discussing opportuniti=s for the Gates Foundation to fund health and education init=atives in the Ivory 
Coast. 
Jeffrey mentioned that you were t=e best point person and I would like to know if I could share your 
contact=information with Mr. Tanoh so that he can reach out to you directly? =3B 
Please let me know if that would be appropriate. <=p> 
I look forward to hearing from you.=/p>
