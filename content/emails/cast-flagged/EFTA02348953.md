RE: Re: 
The third problem can be posed — though few will understand it. The first two can be posed but there is no known way 
to address them — the first for reasons that Dick Lewontin explained in his important paper on evolution of cognition 
(which those who write about the topic refuse to read), the second because it reaches to issues that are total mysteries 
even in much simpler domains — perhaps, though many don't to contemplate the fact, because of limits of human 
cognitive capacity. Puppet and puppeteer, again. 
There are lots of narrower problems that can be posed, but there are issues of general import. 
What was very special, maybe unique, about Hilbert in 1900 was the advances in the field had reached the point so that 
questions had that miraculous combination of being (1) potentially within reach and (2) of very great import for the field 
of mathematics. That's hard to achieve. 
Will think more about it — repeating the Hebrew words to myself. Did you learn them as a kid in Hebrew school?

The main questions that interest me are about origin of the language faculty, which, I think, created modern 
humans, the most unusual, nutty, and remarkable of all biological phenomena. There are two problems that seem 
beyond reach: the origin of elementary human concepts, which appear to be radically different from anything in the 
animal world; and the "creative aspect of language use," the phenomenon that astonished Galileo, Descartes, and other 
leading figures since. The third problem has to do with what we've been calling "the Basic Property" of language: a 
EFTA_R1_01323488 
EFTA02348953

recursive procedure that generates an infinite array of hierarchically structured expressions interpreted at the 
interfaces, primarily the conceptual-intentional interface, providing a "language of thought." The most fundamental 
question here is to what extent the Strong Minimalist Thesis (SMT) holds, that is, to what extent has nature produced a 
perfect solution to the Basic Property, which underlies our creative capacities in language (and probably much else). 
That problem can be addressed, and has been, I think with some success. 
Very generous proposal. Made good sense for Hilbert in 1900, given the advances of the past century. These 
enabled him to formulate problems of deep mathematical significance in a form that was not too far from contemporary 
understanding. 
But my feeling is that the cognitive sciences is nowhere near that stage. It's possible to pose many narrower 
problems, and that's in fact what people work on from grad school on to the limits of research. But understanding, I 
think, has probably not reached the stage where one can sensibly do what Hilbert did. 
Others incidentally disagree — as is usually the case.

Forty years ago, Israel was one of the most admired countries in the world. Now it is most disliked. 
Forty years ago it was pretty clear, as I wrote at the time (and I was far from alone), that those who call themselves 
"supporters of Israel" are in fact supporters of its moral degeneration, international isolation, constant conflict and 
security problems, and maybe worse. So it has occurred. Israel even now has an official whose task is to deal with 
international isolation.

Israelis like to attribute all this to anti-Semitism, which hasn't changed in the past 40 years. Or to appeal 
to "we have no negotiating partner," which won't wash. The problem is not Netanyahu. The policies and problems are 
much deeper. The crucial question is how long and how far will Israel proceed on the course to self-destruction. 
A lot of work in Al, neural network theory, "Big Data and statistics," etc., is as you describe — mimicking 
behavior (which I don't even find amazing or particularly interesting). But I think you underestimate the theoretical 
insights and explanations, such as the few I mentioned in the papers I sent, the theories that yield explanations for such 
surprising phenomena as rigidity and structure-dependence, with their far-reaching consequences. Those I think are the 
kinds of results that are rarely found outside the hard sciences. They don't mimic behavior, but explain fundamental 
properties of cognitive processes that enter into behavior, of course indirectly. And there's a lot more like it.

I use my coin flip analogy often. ie. . single cell experiments, like looking through a microscope at my 
coin , measure its content it moment, its shape , all trying to figure out why the result after a long while is always the 
same -equal number of tails and heads. a consistent result. no algorithm , no computation . Why i am pushing you 
on this, is that i firmly believe that language needs a theory, cognitive science needs a theory, your minions and 
intellectual offspring are like bio engineers --they will be able to mimic some of the behavior, yes it is amazing but not 
interesting, you have thought long and hard and more importantly have seen what does NOT work. einsteins thought 
experiments led to truly remarkable results in physics. Im hoping that results like that can be achieved for biology

Maybe there are miracles, but I think more prosaic approaches yield rich results in domains like 
vision (Marr's main concern) and language. Like some of those I've mentioned. I don't see how to progress in other 
ways.

Marr, , -try, probabilty, , symmetry. entropy. it might look like computation but it is not. it 
might look like algorithm but it is not. the flip of a coin does not compute, have an algorithm or a mechanism. though it 
might look as if it does. it is not an input system, there is not mechanism drivning the heads and tails towards equal 
numbers. , there is not nature looking to see what the previous results were and computing the next result. like your ug 
it is more of a miracle.

I wouldn't take the term "mechanism" too literally. It refers to whatever is taking place 
in the brain. For some, as most of those in the Nowak group, it means neural nets. For Gallistel, it's processes internal 
to the cell. Useful to look at these matters in terms of Marr's three levels: computation, algorithm, mechanism.

Not a trivial matter. I'm not the best person to ask. I'd suggest contacting 
people who've really thought seriously about these issues, like Robert Pollin, a fine independent economist at U Mass 
Amherst 
2. 
Sherman's speculation is an interesting extension of recent discoveries 
about conservation, deep homologies, regulatory circuits, and other elements of what's sometimes called "the evo-devo 
revolution." It remains to be seen whether anything can be done with it. I think you underestimate the contributions of 
Berwick and his students, including Yang. 
3. 
The idea that there is a "ug" for vision, language, etc., seems to be 
essentially what Randy Gallistel calls "the norm in neuroscience," quoted in the paper on modularity that I sent you. 
And yes, they're certainly connected, at least at the level of cells, and presumably well beyond. These are live and 
significant research areas. These "central modules" do not have input or output, but they are accessed by input systems 
and in some cases, like language, by output systems. That seems a fair picture of the rough cognitiv
