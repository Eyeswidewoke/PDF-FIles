Attached is the photo of the small tuft of carpet that I have which the carpet place is matching the rug to. As you can see, I matched the carpet sample to Benjamin Moore paint color Cool Aqua, which there is a large painted panel in this color on island. I am happy to send this tuft down, but I'm not sure it will be much more help than the actual paint sample. <photo.jpeg> 1 EFTA_R1_01262271 EFTA02330488 |
