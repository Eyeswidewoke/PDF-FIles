Glenn, 
Jeffery may be referring to the dispute between Zwirn and Corbin which was partially resolved a few 
weeks ago. Zwirn sued Corbin seeking payment of his partnership distributions. In settling, we did 
concede on the partnership distributions relating to the non-forfeitable shares and made a partial 
payment. However, the settlement was without prejudice as to the treatment of the portion of Dan's 
shares that are subject to forfeiture. We are waiting to see how the SEC finally deals with Dan before 
proceeding on the forfeiture process. 
Please let me know if you would like any further information. 
Thanks, 
Noah
