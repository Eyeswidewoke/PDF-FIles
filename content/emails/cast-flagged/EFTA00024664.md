### Match 7
> email explained our reasons for firmly pressing the 11/8 trial date, but as an accommodation, we would consider starting on 11/15, but no later. For now, we will not agree to exclusion of speedy trial time beyond 11/8. These scheduling conflicts can be easily eliminated by consenting to bail for Ms. Maxwell. It is unclear why the scheduling order, which contemplated a continuance, should be altered. As previously discussed and raised with the Court, we need to review of 3500 material and exhibits before determining the need to call any experts. Enjoy the day. Bobbi BOBBI C. STERNHEIM, ESQ. Law
