| **Subject** | Re: Jeffrey Epstein can recall who had introduced us; it may have been Rick Salomon maybe but I'm really unsure... Jeffrey is probably trying to remember me as it's been so long so I can try to help; remind him he had loaned me his place in the desert in New Mexico when I was going through a bit of a tough time, I went there for 3 days. Also if he googles me he might remember what I look like, although it was around 23 years ago, and I looked younger, by still... same person. :) or, if need be, I can email you a picture quite simply; he might recall then?
