| **Sent** | Jul 16, 2012 1:17 PM Original Message Hi girls, I will need your help tomorrow please, there will be 2 deliveries for apt.8H between 8:00am and 1:15pm(separate time for each). I need someone of you to be at the building and open the apartment for delivery people. The doorcode for 8H is 12345. I left Sarah's and Svet's phones and apt. numbers with the doorman as contact people, and also Sue's phone in case there will be any issues with other two. Could you please confirm if you guys can do it? Thanks so much, Karyna.
