Andrew — 
You may recall that Jeffrey Epstein was looking for a lease renewal at AYH. Joe Walling (the GM at 
AYH) has been negotiating with Esptein's team and there are two issues that require your input, as 
follows: 
1. 
Epstein is looking for 10 free parking spaces. Currently, he has five free spaces and pays 
for five additional spaces. Giving him the five additional spaces for free would cost AYH 
$9,000 in revenue per year — with no real cost of sales attached. 
2. 
He is looking for no escalations on a five year lease. Their current lease provides for 3% 
escalation each year. Based upon current rent, this would cost $37,000 over five years. 
AYH would not ordinarily offer these concessions to tenants — and it is not suffering from excess space 
inventory. Can we discuss this when you have a moment? 
Thanks.
