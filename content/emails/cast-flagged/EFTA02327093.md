| **Subject** | 71st basement flooring I have gotten a rough estimate to replace the basement flooring =ith Armstrong black and white checkered sheet vinyl flooring. To do the =allway and catering kitchen for material and installation would be =bout $4800. This excludes the laundry room. (I'm going off the sizing =rom a quote I found in Doug's papers when the current flooring was =nstalled in 1996; it only included the hallway and kitchen which is =100 sq.feet) I have included photos of the hall, kitchen and laundry =oom. The hallway is in OK condition, but the kitchen definitely needs =o be =eplaced. 1 EFTA_R1_01249725 EFTA02327093 |
