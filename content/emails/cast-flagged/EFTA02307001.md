Mr. Epstein is asking for $5000 for 50 shots at a rate of $100 per shot. A $100 per shot is tight for me. Would Mr. Epstein be willing to meet me in the middle at $130 per shot for a total of $6500? Also, I will need an assistant for two days at a rate of $300 per day. Thanks, Michael On Wed, May 30, 2012 at 7:49 PM, wrote: <mailto > > Thank you Michael. Mr Epstein said he would need 50 shots of each house. They are each quite large and is wondering if you would do the NY house for $5,000 for 50 shots?
