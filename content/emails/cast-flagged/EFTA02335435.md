| **From** | Subject Re: (no subject) Tom, Of course I will let JE know. It never rains but it pours. Regarding the Mayo, actually Flavio sd he would organise but I am not sure if it is better he does or you do. Regardless, what Flavio sd was that we should all go beofre the Indianapolis race which is the 28/29/30 Sept. So that means Mayo 24/25/26/27 any of those dates. Let me know what you think I wish there was something I could do for you. Love you Gx At 05:40 PM 8/2/2001 -0500, you wrote: Please tell Je y that this is the reason I haven't been prompt in returning his call. I will check in as soon as stuff settles down. I need full name for Flavio and preferred dates for appointment at Mayo. My instructions, as I understand it, are to get appts for the three of you (Jeffrey, Flavio and you). tip EFTA_R1_0 1282803 EFTA02335435 |
