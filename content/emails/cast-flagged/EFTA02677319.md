Credits: 4 
CRN 6981 Sec A 
The intimate and the economic are often imagined as two separate, or even hostile. spheres of 
social life. If mixed, conventional wisdom holds, love and money will corrupt each other 
sentiments will get in the way of business, and calculation will poison passion. Our very ideals of 
intimacy and economic activity both rely on constantly drawing boundaries between the two. 
However, ethnographic evidence gathered by anthropologists and sociologists suggests that in the 
practice of everyday life, love and money intermingle constantly in the practices of of individuals. 
couples, and households and often with good results. This course serves as an introduction to 
social and cultural analysis of money in everyday life by way of exploring a series of messy 
'intimate transactions? How does money circulate between spouses, friends, lovers, relatives, 
parents and children? What pleasures and profits. divisions and attachments do these exchanges 
produce? The course explores, among other themes: compensated and uncompensated 
household labor, inheritance, informal loans, remittances from those overseas, college funds. and

2100 Postcolonial Africa 
Faculty: Reitman. Janet 
TR 
10:00 AM - 11:40 AM 
Credits: 4 
CRN 4993 Sec A 
Postosionial Africa is typically represented as a marginal place in the world: a place of disorder 
and war. How does anthropology help us to consider Africa's place in our world? Do 
anthropological accounts of postcolonial Africa confirm that it is a place of chaos and violence? Or 
does anthropology allow us to better understand how we came to think about Africa as prone to 
violence and marginality? This seminar will consider these questions. We will examine some of 
the key concepts and debates that are central to the anthropology of postcolonial Africa with an 
aim to developing a aitical perspective on representations of this vast continent and the diversity 
of practices that make Africa more than a continent. The seminar will take a thematic approach. 
covering topics such as kinship and ethnicity, religion and witchcraft. and economics and 
globalization. We will use both ethnographies and novels as the basis for discussion and debate.

Faculty: Rao, VyJayanthi

12:10 PM 02:50 PM 
Credits: 4 
CRN 7070 Sec AX 
For the first time in world history, more people live in urban rather than rural settlements. The 
scale, complexity and dynamism of contemporary urbanization and the tendency toward disorder 
or entropy in contemporary cites is historically unprecedented. This momentous and global 
transformation has great social, cultural, economic and political implications and numerous 
causes. In this seminar course, we will examine the specific relationship between the 
contemporary urban revolution and globalization or the recent post-cold war integration of 
economic and political institutions at the global scale and we will explore their implications for our 
collective future. The seminar is structured around core topics such as infrastructure and urban 
ecology, urban inequality and uneven development and the question of urban visions and futures. 
Case studies are drawn from across the world and we will use several channels of analysis, 
including documentary films and television broadcasts, the internet. reports prepared by 
multilateral organizations and think tanks and, finally, your own field researches in and around 
New York City. Ideas will be snared in class through interactive Journals and shared reports. 
Students must have taken at least one prior anthropology course at the 200 level.

Credits: 4 
CRN 6398 Sec A 
'This course introduces the principles and practices of human rights and humanitarianism in 
interdisciplinary perspective. We will inquire into the notions of "'humanity" imagined and 
protected by each of these. as well as how each are bounded by national and colonial histories. 
The readings will help students explore how these hegemonic discourses and practices are 
culturally contextualited and mediated: arid while trying to understand how claims of resistance 
and struggle are being re-articulated in legal languages of nghts and entitlements and/or in a 
moral language of humanitarianism, we will pay particular attention to how these claims often 
have unintended consequences. Using gender, race and class as focal points. we will think about 
•who• benefits from these discourses and practices and what alternatives we may have. This 
course satisfies requirements in Reading and Writing?
