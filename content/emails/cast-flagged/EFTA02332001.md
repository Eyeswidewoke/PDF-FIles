| **Subject** | Re: J. Epstein Thank you so much for clarifying arrival time! I might be wanting to catch a ride with Dr Merkin to Miami on Thursday. Do y=u know what time he is planning on flying that day? I'm going to try and fly out on a Wed night flight, but if I'm unable to, I w=uld catch a ride with Dr Merkin depending on what time he leaves on Thursda=. My full name The other possible passenger that would have flown with him actually needs t= go to NY, not Miami, so it would only be me.

St.Thomas is one hour later than Miami, (they don't do da=light savings there) so if he leaves tomorrow at 11am, I think that should g=t him into St.Thomas about 2:15p St.Thomas time! But if you could confirm t=at with his pilots, that would be great.
