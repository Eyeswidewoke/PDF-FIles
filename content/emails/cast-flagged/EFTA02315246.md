I am sure she will be a great asset in another household. If you have any other candidates, please let me know. In the meantime we wil= see how a trial with Nangsal and Maria will go. Thank you very much. Karyna > On May 17, 2019, at 3:32 PM, Tsering Dolma wrote: > Hi Karyna, how did the interview went with Tsering? She told me that it we=t very well. Did you like her?
