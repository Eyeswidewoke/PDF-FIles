I'll be taking Sunday off for my birthday, but otherwise I'm available. Upcoming Apple news that will likely be of interest: Upcoming iPhone announcement within the next two weeks: iPhone Pro (expect screen of the Plus phones in the size of the 7; wireless charging; facial recognition; 5-tap quick lock to disable Touch ID / facial recognition) Apple TV 4K -- I know Paris & NY have 4K projectors already. Apple Watch 3 -- maybe they get it right this time? In December, Apple releases iMac Pro and Home Pod wireless speakers.
