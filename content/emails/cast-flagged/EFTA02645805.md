Trial date set for lawsuit against billionaire se= offender Epstein

A trial that promises to offer the first public airi=g of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein's activities with 
teen=ge girls at his Palm Beach mansion is to be held in December, a Palm Beach=County circuit judge agreed Thursday.

The malicious prosecution lawsuit that attorney Brad=ey Edwards filed against the Palm Beach billionaire has 
been on hold for y=ars while various appeals were filed. With the issues resolved by the Flor=da Supreme Court last 
month, Circuit Judge Donald Hafele said the jury trial should begin Dec. 5.=/p> 
While attorney Jack Scarola, who represents Edwards,=had put President Donald Trump on the witness list, he 
has said he won =80 t need Epstein's fellow part-time Palm Beacher to prove his c=se. The legal hurdles he would face to 
try to force a sitting president to take the witness stand are unnecessary, he said.=/u> 
"We can prove our case without Donald Trump=E2 s testimony," Scarola said in May. 
Scarola claims Epstein sued Edwards in 2009 to punis= him for representing roughly a half-dozen women against 
Epstein. The wome= claimed Epstein paid them for sexually charged massages at his mansion wh=n some were as young 
as 14. Epstein eventually dropped his lawsuit against Edwards, but the state Supreme Cour= recently ruled Edwards 
could still pursue the 64-year-old politically-con=ected money manager for malicious prosecution. 
As part of a plea deal in 2008, Epstein settled the =awsuits that more than two dozen young women, including 
Edwards' c=ients, had filed against him. The settlement agreements were confidential.=u> 
When he agreed to plea guilty to charges of solicita=ion of prostitution and soliciting minors to engage in 
prostitution, he al=o agreed not to contest the women's claims. In what Edwards and ot=ers have described as a 
"sweetheart deal," Epstein served 13 months of an 18-month sentence. He was allowed to leave =he Palm Beach County 
jail during the day to work, but he has been forced t= register as a sexual offender. 
That deal is the subject of a separate lawsuit now p=nding against the U.S. government in federal court. Edwards 
claims the U.S= Attorney's Office violated the federal Crime Victims Rights Act b= signing off on the deal, which allowed 
Epstein to plead guilty to minor charges in Palm Beach County Circuit Court. In ex=hange, federal prosecutors said they 
wouldn't pursue charges again=t him. 
In court papers, federal prosecutors recently disput=d Edwards' claims, insisting they kept victim's informed a= 
the nonprosecution agreement took shape. They said many of the victims re=used to testify. They claimed they 
negotiated the deal because they wanted to assure that the traumatized young women receiv=d money to rebuild their 
lives and that Epstein would be forever branded a=sex offender to protect other young women. 
Edwards is to file his response to their claims by t=e end of the month.

Details of Epstein's lifestyle were expected=to be divulged in a federal courtroom in New York City in May. But 
on the =ve of trial, the defamation suit Edwards filed against Epstein's l=ngtime friend, British socialite Ghislaine 
Maxwell, was settled. The terms are confidential. 
Edwards filed the suit on behalf of 
= who previously came out of hiding to claim that in addition 
to abusing he=, Epstein let his high-placed friends use her as a sex toy. The men 
= identified, who denied the 
allegations, included former President Bill Clinton and Great Britain's Prince =ndrew, both regular guests on Epstein's jet. 
When Maxwell called 
claims "obvious lies," Edwards sued her. 
While all the dozens of other lawsuits Epstein has f=ced have been settled, Scarola vows the malicious 
prosecution one will go =o trial.
