I need to c=nceptualise, work on space planning, and select furniture simultaneously. =hey all develop together and develop each other. I like to do work marathons in quiet, not be distracted and not break. This=enables me to maintain focus, follow a sequence of steps, and work with so=tware relevant to the work in a decent amount of time. So that I can produ=e - •Cad drawings and elevations with options for space planning •furniture selections and options with costing. The way we were working ( sitting together choosing things), I feel suppres=es my skills and basically just makes me another person with good taste ch=osing furniture. I will move forward with this.
