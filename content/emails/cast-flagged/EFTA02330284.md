| **Subject** | Apartment Cleaning to be done by Hi all! Jeffrey would like your apartment cleaning to be done by =nd Leo once a week. We would like to come up with a schedule that =orks for everyone, knowing that guest apartments will need to be =leaned on an 'as needed' basis. Because of this, as well as when =effrey is in town and MILeo are needed at the house, your day/time =or cleaning could change from time to time (hopefully not too often) Please send me an email with your 2 choices for day/time of cleaning =on-Fri. I will then put together a schedule... FYI-. will be leaving on holiday from Oct. 6-Nov. 13...during this =ime if you would like your apartment cleaned you may hire someone to do =t. Please get back to me by end of today with the best day/times for you to =ave. and Leo clean for you.
