Invisible Forces and Unseen Powers: 
Gravity, Gods, and Minds 
Preface 
1. Invisible Forces Operating on Human 
Bodies 
Gravity is an invisible force that holds us 
to the surface of the earth, and the fact 
that gravity is invisible does not place it 
beyond scientific scrutiny. Similarly, 
humans arc a quintessentially social 
species whose need for social connection 
produces invisible forces on our brain, 
behavior, and biology that are subject to 
scientific investigation. Among these are 
forces that compel us to seek trusting and 
meaningful connections with others and 
to seek meaning and connection with 
something bigger than ourselves. The 
story of these invisible forces speaks to 
who we are as a species. 
From Selfish Genes to Social Brains 
2. The Social Nature of Humankind 
The human brain has evolved under the 
guidance of selfish genes to produce 
more than a brain that is capable of 
powerful, isolated information 
processing operations. The human brain 
also evolved with inherent capacities for 
social cognition, compassion, empathy. 
bonding, coordination, cooperation, 
values, mortality and a need for social 
connection that extends beyond kin and 
even other individuals. 
From Inclusive Fitness to Spiritual 
Striving 
3. Science, Religion, and a Revised 
Religious Humanism 
The dialogue between science and 
religion, if properly pursued, can usher in 
a new era of religious humanism in the 
leading world religions. Their central 
beliefs and practices largely would 
remain intact, but their views of nature 
and their concerns with health and well-
being would be refined through their 
conversations with the sciences. How 
this model would work is discussed in 
terms of the relation between love and 
health in Christian theology - especially 
the tension between the agape, caritas. 
and eros models of Christian love. 
The Status of the Body Politic and the 
Status of the Body Itself 
4. Health by Connection: From Social 
Brains to Resilient Bodies 
Most people feel socially connected most 
of the time. Felt connectedness is 
typically taken for granted. but the 
effects of its absence, as experienced in 
feelings of isolation, demonstrate that 
our evolutionary heritage as a social 
species has potent implications for health 
and well-being. 
From Relationships to People and 
Groups to Relationships with God 
5. Psychosomatic Relations: From 
Superstition to Mortality 
It has long been recognized that mental 
states can impact health and well being. 
but the causal pathways have only 
recently begun to be understood. 
Thoughts, beliefs and attitudes can have 
powerful effects on physiological 
functions, health and disease. Examples 
range from superstitious beliefs 
associated with voodoo, bone pointing, 
or other black rituals to the more positive 
states associated with spirituality. The 
present essay considers these disparate 
psychological states and how they might 
translate into physiological effects 
having real health implications.

actions that imply particular timing 
patterns such as synchrony or rhythmic 
turn taking such as applauding in unison 
or the 'wave' that is produced by 
thousands of individual sports fans in a 
stadium. A model to explain such 
synchronized behavior is proposed in 
terms of the neural processes that are 
jointly recruited. One of the main 
implications suggested by this model is 
that taking part in or being part of a 
synchronized social interaction gives rise 
to a qualitative shift in subjective 
experience due to the difficulty of 
applying an individual centered 
explanation to collectively produced 
spontaneous co-action. 
You and I as One 
7. Action at a Distance: The Invisible 
Force of Language 
Language forms the fabric of our social 
institutions and makes tangible the nature 
of our relationships. Although the 
function of language is typically viewed 
in terms of the information content that it 
provides, some of the social function of 
language may depend on the way it 
affects us. The idea of language impact 
- how language directly affects our 
emotions and social connections - may 
be fundamental to the way the social 
brain functions to connect people. 
Systems and Signals for Social 
Coordination 
8. Hidden Forces in Understanding 
Others: Mirror Neurons and 
Neurobiological Underpinnings 
Specific brain regions in the monkey 
contain individual brain cells, or neurons, 
that respond to both observation and 
execution of identical hand and mouth 
actions. Brain imaging in humans has 
demonstrated that our brains have 
similarly localized regions with similar 
properties. These areas respond to 
execution of goal-directed actions of the 
hand and mouth and during observation 
of the same or similar actions. 
Interestingly, these brain regions in the 
human are also responsive to observation 
and imitation of facial movements, and 
appear to be sensitive to their emotional 
content. 
Connecting and Binding Social Brains 
and Minds 
9. Empathy and Interpersonal Sensitivity 
Empathy is thought to play a key role in 
motivating prosocial behavior, guiding 
our preferences and behavioral 
responses, and providing the affective 
and motivational base for moral 
development. While folk conceptions of 
empathy view it as the capacity to share, 
understand and respond with care to the 
affective states of others, neuroscience 
research demonstrates that these 
components can be dissociated. Empathy 
is not a unique characteristic of human 
consciousness, but it is an important 
adaptive behavior that evolved with the 
mammalian brain. However, humans arc 
special in the sense that high-level 
cognitive abilities (language, theory of 
mind, executive functions) are layered on 
top of phylogenetically older social and 
emotional capacities. These higher level 
cognitive and social capacities expand 
the range of behaviors that can be driven 
by empathy. 
Seeing into My Mind and Other Minds 
10. Seeing Invisible Minds 
Other minds are inherently invisible. 
Being able to "see" them requires 
learning about other minds, attending to 
other minds, and projecting one's own 
mind onto others, and seeing minds in 
other agents can mean the difference 
between treating others as humans versus 
as objects.

Seen 
11. Anthropomorphism: Human 
Connection to a Universal Society

I' age 14 
The human motivation for social 
connection extends beyond the boundary 
of the human in the (often 
misunderstood) religious language of 
anthropomorphism. In this chapter, an 
infamous sermon from colonial 
America—"Sinners in the Hands of an 
Angry God"—is used to illustrate the 
way anthropomorphic language works to 
incorporate human society in a web of 
ethical obligations that connect to the 
natural environment and, by imaginative 
extension, to the universe as a whole. 
Personifications of God 
12. How Does God Become Real 
Becoming a person of faith is not so 
much about acquiring certain beliefs 
but about learning to use one's mind 
in particular ways; the often intensely 
private experience of God is built 
through a profoundly social learning 
process. 
Belief and Connection 
13. Theological Perspectives on God as 
an Invisible Force 
The beliefs that religious individuals 
hold about the way God operates in 
human life are potential factors affecting 
perceived social isolation. My paper 
discusses a specific type of such belief 
that is common in the history of 
Christian thought: the belief that God is 
an invisible force of a rather impersonal 
sort working for the good in everything 
that happens. The paper argues that this 
sort of belief has as great or greater 
potential than belief in God as a personal 
friend to give one the sense that one is 
never alone, but the conception of God 
as pervasive can also lead to inattention 
and disconnection. 
The Elusiveness of Meaningful 
Connection 
14. Visible Efforts to Change Invisible 
Connections 
Despite the human need for social 
connection, many individuals are lonely 
because they are unable to create 
meaningful social bonds. Interventions 
designed to reduce loneliness have not 
been successful, suggesting that a better 
understanding of loneliness, social 
connection, and the obstacles to forming 
meaningful connections with others is 
needed. 
Reflections on Invisible Connections 
15. Social Brain, Spiritual Medicine? 
Science and religion are inextricably 
intertwined in the practice of medicine. 
Science has provided modern medicine 
with extraordinary diagnostic and 
therapeutic capacities that can be 
employed to care for patients. Religions 
provide a fuller vision for the worthiness 
of caring for the sick, a framework to 
guide the application of medical science 
in that endeavor, and practices that 
strengthen the human capacity for 
treating patients as the mindful persons 
they are. 
Invisible Forces 
16. Epilogue 
Invisible forces that connect individuals 
to society, or to each other, have effects 
at both ends of the connection. As 
humans we are fundame
