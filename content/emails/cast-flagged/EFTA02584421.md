Catherine, 
My =usiness partner and principal of the company visited the South Beach =ranch last week and spoke to 
someone there about replacing I-IBRK and =ssociates as the guarantor of our LC. It seems little =ction has resulted 
unless something is going on administratively that I am unaware of at this =ime. 
Jean Luc =runel, who is copied on this email, would like to replace the funds =uaranteeing the LC with his own 
and release the full amount back to =BRK. Can you please let us know what needs to occur =n order to do this in a 
timely and expedited manner. Please advise.
