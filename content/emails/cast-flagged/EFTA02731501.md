### Match 1
> ck, photos with JE ; Meredith Firetog Meredith Firetog The original photo was taken at a distance. Attached are photos where we try to zoom in - JE at the side of the boat with a young woman with EFTA02731505 blond hair (pink arrow pointing to him in first photo). Our client said that it was Maxwell who took these four photos. She said they stayed ovemight just one night. We believe this is summer- It is clearly Oak Bluffs harbor on MV. Some of the houses in the last 3 photos are still there today and this can be confirmed. Jeanne Jeanne M. Christensen Partner 85 Avenue New York, NY 10
