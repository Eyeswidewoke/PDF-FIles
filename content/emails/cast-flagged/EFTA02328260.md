Please see below. Let m= know if I need to get a flight for her for earlier tomorrow or tonight. Hi Karyna called me awhile ago if I could be able to fly back today and told he= I'm still waiting for my denture till tonight. If I really need to fly back as soon as possible i could fly the last flight=or whatever earliest possible flight tomorrow.
