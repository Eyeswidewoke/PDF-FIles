## 🔴 TIER 1: CRITICAL EVIDENCE

### EXHIBIT A — "This is a good one, right?" (EFTA00019103)
**Source:** Complaint for Damages, Panish Shea & Boyle LLP
> "During one of Doe's encounters with Epstein, he took her to Mar-a-Lago where he introduced her to its owner, Donald J. Trump. Introducing 14-year-old Doe to Donald J. Trump, Epstein elbowed Trump playfully asking him, referring to Doe, 'This is a good one, right?' Trump smiled and nodded in agreement. They both chuckled and Doe felt uncomfortable, but, at the time, was too young to understand why."

**Significance:** Direct witness testimony of Trump interacting with a 14-year-old Epstein victim at Mar-a-Lago. This is a formal legal complaint.

---

### EXHIBIT B — "I've known Jeff for fifteen years" (EFTA~00013639)
**Source:** New York Magazine profile of Jeffrey Epstein
> "And yet if you talk to Donald Trump, a different Epstein emerges. 'I've known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy,' Trump booms from a speakerphone. 'He's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it -- Jeffrey enjoys his social life.'"

**Significance:** Trump's own words acknowledging 15-year friendship AND knowledge that Epstein liked "younger" women.

---

### EXHIBIT C — "Him and Epstein and 28 Girls" (EFTA00030188)
**Source:** Vanity Fair / SDNY internal email forwarding news article
> "Just 'Him and Epstein' and '28 Girls': Florida Man Drops a Dime on Trump — Florida businessman George Houraney told the New York Times that the president's relationship with Jeffrey Epstein involved at least one 'calendar girl' party at Mar-a-Lago."

**Significance:** Third-party witness account of private Trump-Epstein party with 28 women at Mar-a-Lago.

---

### EXHIBIT D — Michael Cohen "has heard Trump say things about Epstein" (EFTA00016170)
**Source:** SDNY internal memo — Note to file re: call with Mike Monico
> "Mike Monico and Barry Spevack called on behalf of Cohen. They asked whether we would file a Rule 35, and requested a meeting to discuss it. I asked what had changed since we told them, on April 17, that we did not intend to file such a motion. They said that Cohen 'has heard Trump say things about Epstein,' but would not get into detail at this time about what those were."

**Significance:** SDNY prosecutors documented that Michael Cohen claimed to have direct knowledge of Trump statements about Epstein. This is internal DOJ documentation.

## 🟠 TIER 2: MAR-A-LAGO AS EPSTEIN RECRUITMENT HUB

### Victim Recruited from Mar-a-Lago (Multiple EFTA sources)
**Source:** DS12 prosecution memo + DS6 grand jury testimony + COMBINED OCR
> "Maxwell recruited [victim] from her job in Mar-a-Lago to massage Epstein. Flight records confirm [victim] traveled with Epstein and Maxwell."

> "He recalls driving Maxwell to a massage appointment at Mar-a-Lago. He was told to wait in the car while she got her massage."

> "During the summer of 1999, when she was 16 years old and working as a towel girl at Trump's Palm Beach resort Mar-a-Lago, Maxwell recruited her to serve as Epstein's massage therapist."

**Significance:** Multiple independent sources confirm Mar-a-Lago was a recruitment location for Epstein's victims. Maxwell specifically used Trump's property to identify and recruit minors.

### Epstein Banned from Mar-a-Lago (EFTA00037155)
> "The Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach last night confirmed a Web site report that Epstein has been banned there. 'He would use the spa to try to procure girls. But one of them, a masseuse about 18 years old, he tried to get her to do things,' a source told us."

**Significance:** Even the "banned" narrative confirms Epstein was actively procuring victims on Trump's property.

### Court Subpoena to Mar-a-Lago (EFTA00000671)
> "Court Subpoena — United States District Court SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK — TO: The Mar-a-Lago Club, 1100 South Ocean Boulevard, Palm Beach, Florida 33480"

**Significance:** SDNY formally subpoenaed Mar-a-Lago records in the Epstein/Maxwell case.

### Mar-a-Lago Records as Trial Evidence
> "GX-821: Human Resources Correspondence Regarding Minor Victim-5's Records — SDNY_GM_00120681"
> "GX-822: Mar-A-Lago Termination List — SDNY_00120686-SDNY_00120702"

**Significance:** Mar-a-Lago employment records were Government Trial Exhibits in the Maxwell trial.

## 🟡 TIER 3: ACOSTA / PLEA DEAL / COVER-UP

### Trump Nominated Acosta Despite Epstein Plea Deal (EFTA~DS8)
> "In 2017, President Donald Trump nominated Acosta to be Secretary of Labor. At his March 2017 confirmation hearing, Acosta was questioned only briefly about the Epstein case. On April 17, 2017, the Senate confirmed Acosta's appointment as Labor Secretary."

### Media Firestorm Over Acosta's Role
Multiple news citations document the controversy:
- "Stunning new report details Trump's labor secretary's role in plea deal for billionaire sex abuser" (Business Insider)
- "New Focus on Trump Labor Secretary's role in unusual plea deal for billionaire accused of sexual abuse" (NBC)
- "Trump labor secretary out of running for attorney general after Miami Herald report" (McClatchy)
- "How Trump's Labor Secretary Covered For A Millionaire Sex Abuser" (HuffPost)
