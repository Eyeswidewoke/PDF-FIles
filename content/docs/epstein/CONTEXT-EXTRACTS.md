remained pending for more than a year. 
In 2017, President Donald Trump nominated Acosta to be Secretary of Labor. At his 
March 2017 confirmation hearing, Acosta was questioned only briefly about the Epstein case. On 
April 17, 2017, the Senate confirmed Acosta's appointment as Labor Secretary.

The SEC is not only obstructing an investigation, they are aiding and abetting the activity. These are not far flung

DOJ at the influence of President Obama and Hillary Clinton entered into the UBS DPA based on just 4400. 
What is so egregious is the activity continues un abated today.

$1 million at a recent Clinton event. This fall, when the California governor asked his

Jeffrey Epstein: International Moneyman of Mystery 

He's pals with a passel of Nobel Prize-winning scientists, CEOs like Leslie 
Wexner of the Limited, socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, even Donald Trump. 
But it wasn't until he flew Bill Clinton, Kevin Spacey, and Chris Tucker to 
Africa on his private Boeing 727 that the world began to wonder who he is. 

e By Landon Thomas Jr. 

He comes with cash to burn, a fleet of airplanes, and a keen 
eye for the ladies -- to say nothing of a relentless brain that 
challenges Nobel Prize-winning scientists across the 
country -- and for financial markets around the world. Ever

many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it -- 
Jeffrey enjoys his social life." 

But beautiful women are only a part of it. Because here's the thing about Epstein: As 
some collect butterflies, he collects beautiful minds. "I invest in people -- be it politics or 
science. It's what I do," he has said to friends. And his latest prize addition is the former 
president. In his eyes, Clinton as a species represents the highest evolutionary form of the 
political animal. To be up close to him, as he was during the African journey, is akin to 
seeing the rarest of beasts on a safari. As he put it to a friend upon his return from Africa,

one is to see Prince Andrew. The Oxford-educated Maxwell, described by many as a 
man-eater (she flies her own helicopter and was recently seen dining with Clinton at 
Nello's on Madison Avenue), lives in her own townhouse a few blocks away. Epstein is 
frequently seen around town with a bevy of comely young women but there has been no 
boldfaced name to replace Maxwell. "You may read about Jeffrey in the social columns, 
but there is much more to him than that," says Jeffrey T. Leeds of the private equity firm

After careful consideration of the record, and as much as it pains me to say this, I simply 
do not believe federal prosecutors would have been involved at all in this matter if not for Mr.

Epstein had socialized with the prince and other high-profile figures including U.S. President Donald Trump and former

Epstein’s suicide in Manhattan's Metropolitan Correctional Center in August, at age 66, occurred little over a month 

after he was arrested and charged with trafficking dozens of underage girls as young as 14 from at least 2002 to 2005. 
Prosecutors said he recruited girls to give him massages, which became sexual in nature. Epstein had pleaded not guilty.

that the federal government failed to confer with the victims in advance of the deal. Marra is now considering the 
possible remedies for the violation, which could potentially include tearing up the non-prosecutions agreement. 

Epstein, 66 -- who at one time socialized with former President Bill Clinton, Great Britain's Prince Andrew and President

on sex trafficking charges, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern 
District of Florida shelved the charges and allowed Epstein to plead guilty to minor charges in state court. That’s how 
Epstein ended up in the Palm Beach County Jail — and then on work release approved by Sheriff Bradshaw. 

A fixture on the high-society social circuit, he was known to associate with figures such as Bill Clinton, Donald Trump and 
Prince Andrew of Britain. He owns homes around the world, including a mansion in Palm Beach. His lawyers pegged his 
wealth at $559 million in court documents.

era, his case has been held up as a prime example of insulated, powerful men avoiding 
accountability. 

For more than a decade, Mr. Epstein, a hedge fund manager, avoided a lengthy prison sentence, largely 
because of the agreement his lawyers struck with federal prosecutors in 2008. 

Mr. Epstein’s social circle is filled with other high-profile connections, including to former President Bill Clinton, Prince 
Andrew of Britain and a host of others. 

In 2002, Mr. Trump described Mr. Epstein as “a terrific guy.”

Jeffrey Epstein: International Moneyman of Mystery 

He's pals with a passel of Nobel Prize-winning scientists, CEOs like Leslie 
Wexner of the Limited, socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, even Donald Trump. 
But it wasn't until he flew Bill Clinton, Kevin Spacey, and Chris Tucker to 
Africa on his private Boeing 727 that the world began to wonder who he is.

Leslie Wexner, his client list is a closely held secret. A

ound for some alternative Jeffrey Epstein stories -- the most bizarre of which has 
him playing the piano (he is classically trained) for high rollers in a Manhattan piano bar 
in the mid-eighties. 

Another focus of curiosity is the relationship that Epstein has with his patron and mentor 
Leslie Wexner, founder and chairman of the Columbus, Ohio—based Limited chain of 
women's-clothing stores. Wexner, who is said to be worth more than $2.5 billion by 
Forbes, became an Epstein client in 1987. "It's a weird relationship," says another Wall

all of a sudden give his money to some guy most people have never heard of." The 
Wexner-Epstein relationship is indeed a multifaceted one.

The 
Wexner-Epstein relationship is indeed a multifaceted one. 

Given the secrecy that envelops Epstein's client list, some have speculated that Wexner is 
the primary source of Epstein's lavish life -- but friends leap to his defense. "Let me tell 
you: Jeffrey Epstein has other clients besides Wexner. I know because some of them are 
my clients,” says noted m&a lawyer Dennis Block of Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft. 
"I sent him a $500 million client a few years ago and he wouldn't take him. Said the

account was too small. Both the client and I were amazed. But that's Jeffrey." 

Epstein’ s current residence in Manhattan -- a 45,000-square-foot eight-story mansion on 
East 71st Street -- was originally bought by Wexner for $13 million in 1989. Wexner 
poured many millions into a full gut renovation, then turned it over to Epstein in 1995 
after he got married. One story has Epstein paying only a dollar for it, though others say 
he paid full market price, which would have been in the neighborhood of $20 million.

found himself spending there, talking elementary particle physics with his friend Murray

the center of the Limited magnate's high-end housing development in New Albany, Ohio.

New Albany was a lush spraw] of farmland on the outskirts of Columbus that Wexner, 
starting in 1988, turned into a rich village of multimillion-dollar Georgian homes 
surrounding a Jack Nicklaus—designed golf course. It was a massive development project, 
financed largely by Wexner himself. Epstein was a general partner in the real-estate

"Before Epstein came along in 1988, the financial preparations and groundwork for the 
New Albany development were a total mess," says Bob Fitrakis, a Columbus-based 
investigative journalist who has written extensively on Wexner and his finances. "Epstein 
cleaned everything up, as well as serving Wexner in other capacities -- such as

Over the years, though Epstein was never employed by L Brands, he corresponded and met with company executives. He attended 
Victoria’s Secret fashion shows; some of the models were guests on his private island, according to a former Epstein employee.

billionaire L Brands founder and Chairman Les Wexner was trying to distance himself from the

Epstein is back in the news after his arrest Saturday on an indictment filed by the U.S. Attorney’s 
Office for the Southern District of New York which charged him with trafficking dozens of 
underage girls. 

Some of the alleged crimes took place in a New York townhouse once owned by Wexner. He is 
currently being held without bail. Wexner was known to be one of the money manager’s few 
clients.

On Wednesday Sen. Chuck Schumer, D.- 
N.Y., said he would donate $7,000 in contributions from Epstein to charity. Stacey Plaskett, 
Democratic U.S. Virgin Islands congresswoman, has also decided to give her Epstein 
contributions to two different charities. 

Epstein provided initial financing to Wexner’s YLK Charitable Fund more than 10 years ago, 
even as Wexner and his wife started to break away from the financier after the initial accusations 
surfaced, according to someone in their inner circle.

them extremely uncomfortable and then he eventually pleaded guilty to those offenses,” the 
person said. 

When asked about Epstein’s behemoth donations to the foundation before going to jail, this 
person refused to comment. It is unclear whether the Wexners will give the money away. 

Just before Epstein began a 13-month jail term, his firm, the Financial Trust Co., based in the

This is interesting. The mansion was the home of a school until Leslie Wexner bought it in 1989 — at least according to a 
number of public reports. He remodeled it, and it was featured (as Wexner’s house) in Architectural Digest in 1995. As 
of 1996, Epstein told the New York Times that the house was his.

1989 is to “Nine East 71st Street Corporation.” Then 13 years later, that corporation, with Epstein as the president, 
transfers title to another Epstein entity. So did he own it that entire time, rather than Wexner, as had been 
advertised?? Or did Wexner own it through a corporation for which Epstein was the president until 2012? 

Can we pull the equivalent documents to these for the 1989 title transfer?

On October 10, 2007, Lefkowitz sent a letter to U.S. Attorney Alex Acosta stating, in

U.S. Attorney Acosta then met with Lefkowitz for breakfast and Lefkowitz followed up with

On November 29, 2007, Lefkowitz sent a letter to U.S. Attorney Acosta objecting to the

The FBI brought the matter to an Assistant U.S. Attorney (AUSA), who opened a file with 
her supervisor’s approval and with the knowledge of then U.S. Attorney R. Alexander Acosta. 
She worked with two FBI case agents to develop a federal case against Epstein and, in the course

On October 10, 2007, Lefkowitz sent a letter to U.S. Attorney Alex Acosta stating, in

that the attorney representative for the victims be instructed that "[t]he details regarding the 
United States's investigation of this matter and its resolution with Mr. Epstein is confidential. 
You may not make public statements regarding this matter." (DE 407 at ¶ 61.) 
U.S. Attorney Acosta then met with Lefkowitz for breakfast and Lefkowitz followed up with 
a letter stating, "I also want to thank you for the commitment you made to me during our October

Epstein's defense team complained. (DE 407 at ¶ 77.) 
On about November 27, 2007, AUSA 
sent an e-mail to Lefkowitz, (with a

about Epstein's plea to state charges that was part of the NPA:

On November 29, 2007, Lefkowitz sent a letter to U.S. Attorney Acosta objecting to the 
proposed victim notification letter, stating that it is inappropriate for any letter to be sent to the 
victims before Epstein entered his plea or had been sentenced. Lefkowitz also told the Government

While OPR did not find that Department attorneys engaged in professional

that former U.S. Attorney Acosta exercised poor judgment by deciding to resolve

failed to make certain that the state of Florida intended to and would notify 
victims identified through the federal investigation about the state plea hearing.

The FBI brought the matter to an Assistant U.S. Attorney (AUSA), who opened a file with 
her supervisor's approval and with the knowledge of then U.S. Attorney R. Alexander Acosta. 
She worked with two FBI case agents to develop a federal case against Epstein and, in the course

supervisors a draft 60-count indictment outlining charges against Epstein. She also provided a

March 2017 confirmation hearing, Acosta was questioned only briefly about the Epstein case. On 
April 17, 2017, the Senate confirmed Acosta's appointment as Labor Secretary.

NPA. On July 10, 2019, Acosta held a televised press conference to defend his and the USAO's

My meeting on Brunel went well this afternoon. Here is the quick read out:

General Points 

e There are three investigating judges assigned to this case, which is pretty unusual...and suggests its importance for 
them.

years while the investigation continues.

they are 
interested to know how to best formulate search terms to take advantage of the platform the records are on (i.e, 
can they do proximity searches, is facial recognition available to identify Brunel, etc.). The idea was also proposed 
of potentially doing a more narrow search now, followed by a potentially more expansive search for relevant data 
after your trial...when the SDNY/FBI bandwith mig

onfidentiality concerns might be less acute. 

e In addition to the database, they wonder if there are transcripts or reports of witness interviews that you would be 
willing to provide, that bear on Brunel. 

« Inthe same vein, they were interested to know if Maxwell talked to FBI post-arrest and if she said anything of 
potential interest to them (/ told them | doubt it, but said | would ask you).

This looks accurate to me, thanks very much. One point you might want to add regarding our searches is that we also 
gathered a large number of photographs, including photos that feature Brunel. Again, if they can narrow their request, we 
would be open to sharing certain images if that would be useful to them. 

Thanks,

purchased Great St. James. 

6. Epstein registered as a sex offender in the Virgin Islands in 2010. He was a Tier |

Epstein Enterprise described below.

the unlawful acts described in this Complaint.

which Epstein trafficked and sexually abused women and underage girls. Epstein owned and

of the Virgin Islands. It was incorporated on November 22, 2011. 

22. According to records of the Virgin Islands Recorder of Deeds, Nautilus, Inc. owns 
Little St. James, a/k/a Parcel Number 109803010100, a parcel of 3.1 million square feet valued at 

$3.2 million, with buildings and improvements valued at $4 million.

treasurer of Nautilus, Inc., respectively. The Estate values Epstein’s holdings of Nautilus, Inc., 
which holds title to Little St. James at $63.9 million.

leaving freely and escaping the abuse. 

26. Thus, Nautilus, Inc. participated in carrying out, facilitating and concealing 
Epstein’s crimes, hence Little St. James became an instrumentality of those crimes.

organized under the laws of the Virgin Islands. Great St. Jim, LLC was

**[17]** *term: Little St. James*
```
Jim, LLC and the nature of 
its business is described as “holding assets.” 

29. Upon information and belief, Epstein purchased these Great St. James properties— 
the island with closest proximity to Little St. James—to further shield his conduct on Little St. 
James from view, prevent his detection by law enforcement or the public, and allow him to 
continue and conceal his criminal enterprise. Epstein’s signifi

B. The “Epstein Enterprise” Abused Privileges of Residency to Carry out its 

Criminal Scheme

the perfect hideaway and haven for trafficking young women and underage girls for sexual 
servitude, child abuse and sexual assault. Little St. James is a secluded, private

no public or commercial transportation is available to carry persons on or off the island, and no 
bridge connects the island to St. Thomas. Epstein had easy access to Little St. James from the 
private airfield on St. Thomas, only 10 minutes away by his private helicopter, but the women and 
children he trafficked, abused, and held there were not able to leave without his permissi

dangerous to swim to St. Thomas. 

67. In 2016, upon information and belief, using a straw purchaser to hide Epstein’s 
identity, the Epstein Enterprise acquired Great St. James the nearest island to Little St. James. By 
then, Epstein was a convicted sex offender. Upon information and belief, the Epstein Enterprise 
purchased the island for more than $20 million because its participants wanted to ensure that the

beyond this statutory requirement, the Virgin Islands periodically visited—or attempted to visit—

81. At his last verification in July 2018, Epstein refused to permit Virgin Islands 
Department of Justice Investigators, assisted by United States Marshals, to enter Little St. James 
beyond its dock, claiming that the dock was his “front door.” Instead, Epstein arranged to be met 
at his office on St. Thomas.

That was certainly not in the original draft

the United States agrees, "That it will not institute any

different than trivializing the case.

process and fundamental fairness. 

(Id. at 55). 

The same principle applies to Ms. Maxwell’s case. As in Cosby, the government is trying 
to renege on its agreement and prosecute Ms. Maxwell over 25 years later for the exact same 
offenses for which she was granted immunity in the NPA. Indeed, the principle applies even more 
strongly in Ms. Maxwell’s case because the NPA was a formal written agreement, as opposed to 
an informal promise like the one in Cosby. This is not consistent with principles of fundamental 
fairness.

Epstein would not contest the jurisdiction of the United States District Court and waived his right 
to contest liability and damages. (NPA, DE 361-62.) 

Among other provisions, the NPA expanded immunity to any “potential coconspirator™

The government's recent effort to confer with victims has established that 
eliminating the immunity provisions would benefit certain victims and harm 
others. The government contacted all attorneys representing victims known to

friends, or the public. Several victims previously expressed, during the 
investigation of Epstein, that they suffered emotional distress and were troubled 
by the prospect of any involvement in the government's investigation. Doc. 403- 
18 { 12. For these victims, setting aside the immunity provisions in a partial 
rescission could only undermine their desire to stay anonymous more than ten 
years after obtaining settlements from Epstein. 

The passage of more than ten years since the NPA was entered only

66 So. 2d at 822 (quotation marks omitted). 

Here, excising the “immunity” or non-prosecution provisions plainly would 
eliminate the essence of the “Non-Prosecution Agreement.” The three sentences

expressly states that its provisions were indivisible, noting that “each of these 
terms is material to this agreement and is supported by independent 
consideration,” and a breach of any condition allowed the government to 
terminate the entire agreement. Id. at 7. Accordingly, omitting the immunity 
provisions “eliminates the essence of the contracting parties’ agreement,” and the 
NPA is thus an indivisible agreement not subject to partial rescission. Wilderness 
Country Club Partnership, 458 So. 2d at 771. Petitioners’ request thus must be 
denied as a matter of law. 

Petitioners point to

the CVRA, 18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(8), while rewarding the government for what the 
Court determined was a violation of the CVRA. The parties appear to have 
agreed for the purposes of this litigation that Epstein has fully performed his 
obligations under the NPA. By eliminating the immunity provisions of the 
agreement, Petitioners’ proposal would thus allow the government to enjoy all 
the benefits of Epstein’s compliance without binding it to its commitments under

reimbursed, they must be made through the government’s approved agency on the approved carriers. 

Regarding the immunity, at this point, without a written proffer from you regarding the substance of her

limits of her Fifth Amendment exposure and, if necessary, to apply to the Court at that time. If you provide

Mr. Epstein of being a sexual predator. But those charges were shelved in 2008 after an eleventh-hour deal 
was reached between the United States attorney’s office in Miami and Mr. Epstein’s lawyers. 

The plea agreement granted Mr. Epstein immunity from federal prosecution and let him plead guilty to two 
prostitution charges in state court. Federal prosecutors arranged for the plea deal to be kept secret from Mr.

vant legal analysis. 
1. 
Overview 
The Scheme 
For a period of years, from at least 2002 through approximately 2005, Epstein engaged 
in a pattern of enticing minor girls to engage in paid sex acts.' This conduct was in part revealed 
through a previous federal investigation into Epstein by the U.S. Attorney's Office and FBI in the 
Southern District of Florida ("SDFL"), which resulted in a 2007 non-prosecution agreement,2 and 
was further investigated and revealed thorough our investigation, which began in late 2018. 
As detailed below, the SDNY is not bound by the SDFL non-prosecution agreement; moreover, 
while our investigation and charges cover some conduct and victims initially identified by the 
SDFL investigation, our charges also include conduct and victims who were not interviewed 
during that
```

**[8]** *term: non-prosecution*
```
tely 2005, after the parents of a victim reported to law enforcement 
that Epstein had abused their daughter. Those investigations spanned approximately two years 
and included, among other things, interviews with approximately 35 victims; a search warrant 
executed on Epstein's Florida residence; and detailed analysis of various phone and flight records. 
As detailed below, the terms of the 2007 non-prosecution agreement required Epstein to plead 
guilty in Florida state court to soliciting prostitution, which he did in 2008. He was sentenced to 
18 months in jail, was permitted to serve his sentence in a facility where he was released during 
the day to work, and was released from his sentence after serving approximately 13 months.

I .eflal Context 
Separate from anticipated defenses, which are addressed further below, we expect there 
are two legal issues that might be raised in connection with a prosecution of Epstein in SDNY. 
A. 
The Florida Non-Prosecution Agreement 
Prior to opening our investigation, we examined the question whether Epstein's prior 
non-prosecution agreement with the SDFL would bar prosecution against Epstein or his 
co-conspirators in the SDNY, including for conduct that occurred in part in SDFL. For the reasons 
set forth below, we believe that it would not. In particular, we believe that the Agreement—which 
was signed only by
```

**[10]** *term: non-prosecution*
```
rticular, we believe that the Agreement—which 
was signed only by representatives of SDFL and spoke, in relevant part, only to binding that 
Office—would not preclude another federal district from bringing properly-venued charges based 
on the same conduct. 
Background 
Following the SDFL and state investigations into Epstein's conduct from 
approximately 2005 through 2007, Epstein entered into a non-prosecution agreement (the "NPA," 
a copy of which is attached) with the SDFL in September 2007. II As discussed further below, the 
terms of the NPA required, among other things, that Epstein plead guilty to state charges of 
soliciting prostitution from a single victim. In exchange, the SDFL agreed not to prosecute Epstein 
for "any offenses that arose" from the SDFL investigation, including trafficking an

Q 
In the final NPA on page five, there's a series of 
things that are included at the bottom of that page, in that 
long paragraph, and the one that I want to focus on is the

19

20

17

18 
Q 
-- potential coconspirators. People who, even in

A 
Not to my recollection. I -- I do think there was

a concern as to how the victims would present in court, given 
11 
impeachment, and given contradictory statements, but that's 
12 
different than trivializing the case. 
13 
Q 
All right. Okay. Back to the immunity provision.

Were you aware that none of the four named coconspirators had

I was not. To my recollection.

and a general matter, I did not discuss the --

to my level, it was -- the 
2 
focus was on who the prime, you know, target is, and not on

what we would do with the coconspirators. And so, I don't

recall, but that doesn't mean it didn't happen. That's just 
5 
not typically something that I got involved with.

Q 
And likewise, non -- immunity being given to non-

something that was done in your office?

would you have insisted it come out?

Yes, they did.

hopefully clarified, and as the U.S. Attorney previously 
11 
explained in an earlier conference call, such promises equate 
12 
to the imposition of a gag order. Our office cannot and will 
13 
not agree to this. It is the intent of this office to treat 
14 
this matter like any other case. 
15 
Thus, as is typical, we do not desire or intend to 
16 
"intervene" the state attorney's office. The non-prosecution 
17 
agreement provides sufficient mechanisms to achieve the goals 
18 
of the federal investigation. You should understand, 
19 
however, that there are some communications that are typical 
20 
in these matters.

And so, I go on, and so my point is this was

So, the -- the -- again, this is -- this is based

15 
Q 
All right. Thank you. Mr. Acosta, OPR is 
16 
investigating two things. As you know, one, whether one or 
17 
more federal prosecutors in the Southern District of Florida 
18 
U.S. Attorney's Office may have committed professional 
19 
misconduct by entering into the non-prosecution agreement, or 
20 
NPA, in 2007 with Jeffrey Epstein, who at the time was under 
21 
investigation by that office, and the FBI, for engaging in 
22 
widespread sexual misconduct involving underage females. 
23 
The second thing we're investigating is Judge 
24 
Marra's finding of February of this year, 2019, that the 
25 
government may have violated -- or, actually, he found the

is, doesn't it appear that the -- that by going -- sending 
21 
this matter back to the state, there's more federal 
22 
interference, more federal involvement in the state process 
23 
than there would have been if you had just kept the case? 
24 
A 
So in hindsight, one of the issues I think in this 
25 
case is after the agreement, and you know, we keep calling it

a non-prosecution agreement, and I kept saying call it an

agreement to defer in favor of state prosecution.

A

Petitioners nonetheless have appeared to contend throughout these proceedings that the 
many opportunities that they have been given to consult with the attorneys for the government 
about Epstein's offenses and the potential charges against Epstein — opportunities which continue 
to be available to Petitioners — are not meaningful under the CVRA due to the existence of the 
Non-Prosecution Agreement. According to Petitioners, the Non-Prosecution Agreement has 
given Epstein a "free pass" on federal criminal charges for the offenses he committed against 
Petitioners and others. See, e.g., DE 9 at 15 (characterizing Non-Prosecution Agreement as "a

Prosecution Agreement about which Petitioners complain disposes of Eq federal criminal

criminal charges against Epstein. Instead, when addressing potential federal criminal charges 
against Epstein, the USAO-SDFL merely agreed in the Non-Prosecution Agreement that: 
on the authority of R. Alexander Acosta, United States Attorney for the Southern 
District of Florida, prosecution in this District for these offenses shall be deferred 
in favor of prosecution by the State of Florida, provided that Epstein abides by the

Heaton 458 F. Supp. 2d at 1273 (the right to confer is "not limited to particular proceedings" but

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
The Department of Justice (Department) Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) 
investigated allegations that in 2007-2008, prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the 
Southern District of Florida (USAO) improperly resolved a federal investigation into the criminal 
conduct of Jeffrey Epstein by negotiating and executing a federal non-prosecution agreement 
(NPA). The NPA was intended to end a federal investigation into allegations that Epstein engaged 
in illegal sexual activity with girls.' OPR also investigated whether USAO prosecutors committed 
professional misconduct by failing to consult with victims of Epstein's crimes before the NPA was 
signed or by misleading victims regarding the status of the federal investigation after the s

**[48]** *term: non-prosecution*

ting whether any of the subjects committed professional misconduct, OPR 
considered whether any of the NPA's provisions violated a clear or unambiguous statute, 
professional responsibility rule or standard, or Department regulation or policy. In particular, OPR 
considered whether the NPA violated standards relating to (1) charging decisions, (2) declination 
of criminal charges, (3) deferred or non-prosecution agreements, (4) plea agreements, (5) grants 
9 
28 C.F.R. § 0.39a(aX I). OPR has authority to investigate the professional conduct of attorneys occurring 
during their employment by the Department, regardless of whether the attorney left the Department before or during 
OPR's investigation. Over its 45-year history, OPR has routinely investigated the conduct of former Department 
attorneys. Altho

Methamphetamine, produced by Mexican cartels and smuggled over the southwestern border, killed 10,333 Americans in 
2017, more than in any previous year. Worse, preliminary statistics show an increase to more than 12,000 in the year

U.S. Lawmakers Aim To Curtail Face Recognition Even As The Technology IDs Capitol Attackers [Reuters] 
WFO/Multiple Field Offices 

e U.S. lawmakers are moving ahead with efforts to ban facial recognition software even as the technology 
helps identify supporters of President Donald Trump who ransacked their workplace and forced them to

Jeffrey Epstein: International Moneyman of Mystery 

He's pals with a passel of Nobel Prize-winning scientists, CEOs like Leslie 
Wexner of the Limited, socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, even Donald Trump. 
But it wasn't until he flew Bill Clinton, Kevin Spacey, and Chris Tucker to 
Africa on his private Boeing 727 that the world began to wonder who he is. 

e By Landon Thomas Jr. 

He comes with cash to burn, a fleet of airplanes, and a keen 
eye for the ladies -- to say nothing of a relentless brain that

hirts, and sneakers -- and is rarely seen in a 
tie. Indeed, those close to him say the reason he quit his board seat at the Rockefeller 
Institute was that he hated wearing a suit. "It feels like a dress," he told one friend. 

Epstein likes to tell people that he's a loner, a man who's never touched alcohol or drugs, 
and one whose nightlife is far from energetic. And yet if you talk to Donald Trump, a 
different Epstein emerges. "I've known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy," Trump booms 
from a speakerphone. "He's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful 
women as much as | do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it -- 
Jeffrey enjoys his social life." 

But beautiful women are only a part of it. Because here's the thing about Epstein: As

A U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation probe is focusing on British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, a longtime associate of

sources told Reuters in December. 

Epstein had socialized with the prince and other high-profile figures including U.S. President Donald Trump and former 
president Bill Clinton. 

Epstein’s suicide in Manhattan's Metropolitan Correctional Center in August, at age 66, occurred little over a month 

after he was arrested and charged with trafficking dozens of underage girls as young as 14 from at least 2002 to 2005.

and other Epstein accusers, finding 
that the federal government failed to confer with the victims in advance of the deal. Marra is now considering the 
possible remedies for the violation, which could potentially include tearing up the non-prosecutions agreement. 

Epstein, 66 -- who at one time socialized with former President Bill Clinton, Great Britain's Prince Andrew and President 

Donald Trump -- was arrested on July 6 for alleged sex trafficking of minor girls in Florida and New York. Some of the 
charges date back to the early 2000s.

Bradshaw, who is running for his fifth term, wields tremendous power in Palm Beach, where the agency has also been the 
lead law enforcement detail assisting the Secret Service during President Donald Trump's visits to Mar-a-Lago. The Palm 
Beach Sheriff's Office spent $5.6 million for Trump’s 2017-2018 trips, the Palm Beach Post reported in April. The 
department is reimbursed for the work. 

Epstein was found on the floor of his jail cell with injuries to his neck, according to a report from NBC New York late 
Wednesday.

District of Florida shelved the charges and allowed Epstein to plead guilty to minor charges in state court. That’s how 
Epstein ended up in the Palm Beach County Jail — and then on work release approved by Sheriff Bradshaw. 

A fixture on the high-society social circuit, he was known to associate with figures such as Bill Clinton, Donald Trump and 
Prince Andrew of Britain. He owns homes around the world, including a mansion in Palm Beach. His lawyers pegged his 
wealth at $559 million in court documents. 

In an email, the Bureau of Prisons said Epstein was currently at the federal jail Thursday morning, not a hospital, but did

Allowing certain people to not face the law's consequences is but a

ultimately ordered that substantial records relating to the USAO's resolution of the Epstein case

In 2017, President Donald Trump nominated Acosta to be Secretary of Labor. At his 
March 2017 confirmation hearing, Acosta was questioned only briefly about the Epstein case. On 
April 17, 2017, the Senate confirmed Acosta's appointment as Labor Secretary.

nd of his tenure, Maxwell asked Mr. Alessi to compile a list of all hotels 
and spas around the area of Palm Beach. After Mr. Alessi compiled the list, Maxwell instructed 
him to drive her around to each location. Maxwell would enter each location, then return with 
business cards of massage therapists. Mr. Alessi recalls one such incident in or around the 
summer of 2002 when he drove Maxwell to Mar-a-Lago and waited for her to receive a massage 
there. After Maxwell returned to the car, she observed a young girl, whom Mr. Alessi later 
learned was named 
and instructed Mr. Alessi to stop the car. Maxwell got out 
of the car and went to speak with
