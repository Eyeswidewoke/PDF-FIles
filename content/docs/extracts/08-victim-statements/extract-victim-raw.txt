need it. For example, if a trial is taking place without the presence of the victim, a victim might 
require immediate relief, as otherwise any opportunity for the victim to attend might permanently 
disappear. Cf. 18 U.S.C. § 3771(d)(5) (a victim cannot obtain the remedy of a “new trial”).

The Government expects Minor Victim-3 to testify, in substance and in part, that she met 
defendant, at the defendant’s invitation, Minor Victim-3 went to the defendant's townhouse in 
London for tea. The defendant expressed an interest in Minor Victim-3, talked with Minor Victim- 
3 about Minor Victim-3’s life and interests, and told Minor Victim-3 about her boyfriend Jeffrey 
Epstein, who she wanted Minor Victim-3 to meet. Shortly after, the defendant invited Minor 
Victim-3 to her home. During that first visit, the defendant introduced Minor Victim-3 to Epstein 
and encouraged her to give Epstein a foot massage. Epstein instructed Minor Victim-3 to massage 
his shoulders. Minor Victim-3 left the townhouse after she was excused. 
Shortly thereafter, the defendant invited Minor Victim-3 to her home again and encouraged 
Minor Victim-3 to provide Epstein with a massage. The defendant showed Minor Victim-3 to a 
and was naked. The defendant handed Minor Victim-3 oil and closed the door. After the massage, 
the defendant was outside the room and asked if Minor Victim-3 had fun and whether Epstein 
liked the massage. The defendant subsequently told Minor Victim-3 that Epstein was impressed 
with her and asked her to come back to her townhouse. The defendant encouraged Minor Victim- 
3 to provide a massage to Epstein. The defendant thanked Minor Victim-3, indicating that if it 
wasn’t Minor Victim-3 or someone else, it would all fall to her (the defendant). The defendant 
again showed Minor Victim-3 to a room with a massage table where Epstein was naked. Both 
massages involved at least one sex act with Minor Victim-3. 
Following those two encounters, the defendant and Epstein invited Minor Victim-3 to 
travel with them to Florida, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and New York. Minor Victim-3 eventually

Minor Victim-3 if she knew any other young females to bring to Epstein and made comments to 
Minor Victim-3 about Epstein’s significant sexual needs. 
On one occasion in Palm Beach, the defendant provided Minor Victim-3 with a schoolgirl
