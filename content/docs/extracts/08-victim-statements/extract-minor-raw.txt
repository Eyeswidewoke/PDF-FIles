announced that GHISLANE MAXWELL was arrested this morning and charged with enticing a minor to travel 
to engage in criminal sexual activity, transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity,

MAXWELL played a critical role in the grooming and abuse of minor victims that took place in locations 
participated in acts of sexual abuse of minors. Maxwell enticed minor girls, got them to trust her, and then 
in Jeffrey Epstein’s abuse of minor girls by, among other things, helping Jeffrey Epstein to recruit, groom, and 
that their victims were in fact minors. As a part and in furtherance of their scheme to abuse minor victims, 
MAXWELL and Epstein enticed and caused minor victims to travel to Epstein’s residences in different states, 
As alleged, MAXWELL enticed and groomed minor girls to be abused in multiple ways. For example, 
As MAXWELL and Epstein intended, these grooming behaviors left minor victims vulnerable and 
minor victims and Epstein, such as interactions where a minor victim was undressed, and ultimately MAXWELL 
was present for sex acts perpetrated by Epstein on minor victims. That abuse included sexualized massages 
during which a minor victim was fully or partially nude, as well as group sexualized massages of Epstein 
involving a minor victim where MAXWELL was present. 
As alleged, minor victims were subjected to sexual abuse that included, among other things, the touching

Epstein, who she wanted Minor Victim-3 to meet. Shortly after, the defendant invited Minor 
Victim-3 to her home. During that first visit, the defendant introduced Minor Victim-3 to Epstein 
and encouraged her to give Epstein a foot massage. Epstein instructed Minor Victim-3 to massage 
his shoulders. Minor Victim-3 left the townhouse after she was excused. 
Shortly thereafter, the defendant invited Minor Victim-3 to her home again and encouraged 
Minor Victim-3 to provide Epstein with a massage. The defendant showed Minor Victim-3 to a 
and was naked. The defendant handed Minor Victim-3 oil and closed the door. After the massage, 
the defendant was outside the room and asked if Minor Victim-3 had fun and whether Epstein 
liked the massage. The defendant subsequently told Minor Victim-3 that Epstein was impressed 
with her and asked her to come back to her townhouse. The defendant encouraged Minor Victim- 
3 to provide a massage to Epstein. The defendant thanked Minor Victim-3, indicating that if it 
wasn’t Minor Victim-3 or someone else, it would all fall to her (the defendant). The defendant 
again showed Minor Victim-3 to a room with a massage table where Epstein was naked. Both 
massages involved at least one sex act with Minor Victim-3.
