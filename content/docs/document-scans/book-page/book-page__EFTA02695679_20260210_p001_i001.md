ANNALS OF SCIENCE 
THE POWER OF NOTHING 
Could studying the placebo effect change the way we think about medscine? 
BY MICHAEL SPECTER 
F
or years, Ted Kaptchuk performed 
acupuncture at a tiny clinic in Cam-
bridge, a few miles from his current 
office, at the Harvard Medical School. 
He opened for business in 1976, on a 
street so packed with alternative healers 
that it was commonly referred to as 
"quack row." Kaptchuk had just returned 
from Asia, where, as an exiled alumnus 
of the turbulent sixties, he had spent four 
years honing his craft. "There were lots 
of alternatives on that street in those 
days, but no practitioners of Chinese 
medicine," Kaptchuk, who is sixty-four 
and still lives in the neighborhood, told 
me recently as we sipped (Chinese) tea 
in the study of his house. "The area is a 
little too L L. Bean for my taste now," 
he said. "It was a different place then." 
Not long after Kaptchuk arrived in 
Boston, he treated an Armenian woman 
for chronic bronchitis. A few weeks later, 
she showed up in his office with her hut 
band, who had a Persian rug slung over 
his shoulder. He nodded to Kaptchuk and 
said, 'This is for you." Kaptchuk accepted 
the rug, which he still owns, but had no 
idea what he had done to earn it. "Oh, 
doctor, you have been so wonderful," the 
woman told him. "You cured me. I was 
about to have an operation on my ovaries 
and the pain went away the day you saw 
me." Kaptchuk never spoke to the woman 
again, but he has been unable to get her 
out of his mind. 'There was no flicking 
way needles or herbs did anything for that 
Scientists are now seriously investigating—and debating—our response to sugar pills. 
woman's ovaries: he told me, still looking 
mystified, thirty-five years later. "It had to 
be some kind of placebo, but I had never 
given the idea of a placebo effect much a 
tention. I had great respect for shamans—
and I still do. I have always believed there 
is an important component of medicine 
that involves suggestion, ritual, and be-
lief—all ideas that make scientists sacam. 
Still, I asked myself; Could I have cured 
her? How? I mean, what could possibly 
have been the mechanism?" 
At the time, few serious scientists 
would have entertained such questions, 
let alone allowed words like "ritual" and 
"belief" to seep into a conversation about 
medicine. Placebos had a bad name, 
which is not surprising, since they have 
been used primarily to deceive people. In 
clinical trials, if a drug and a sugar pill 
produce similar results, the drug has gem 
erally been considered worthless. But the 
definition of medical treatment is chang 
ing, and so arc attitudes about placebos. 
This year, Harvard created an institute 
dedicated wholly to their study, the Pro-
gram in Placebo Studies and the Thera-
peutic Encounter. It is based at the Beth 
Israel Deaconess Medical Center and 
Kaptchuk was named its director. He 
has already recruited leading researchers 
from around the world, in disciplines as 
diverse as neuroanatomy and semiotics. 
The program was formed to explore an 
idea that even twenty years ago would 
have seemed preposterous: that place-
bos—given deliberately—might be de-
ployed in clinical practice. As medicine. 
Kaptchuk has no shortage of critics. 
They acknowledge the power of the 
mind to influence health but question 
the rigor of studies suggesting that pla-
cebos could possibly prove as valuable as 
drugs. Indeed, the idea of dispensing 
sugar pills is jarring even to those who, 
like Kaptchuk, are enthusiastic about it. 
After all, placebos have almost always 
been defined as exactly what medicine 
is not. "I realized long ago that at least 
some people respond even to the sug-
gestion of treatment," Kaptchuk said. 
"We know that. We have for centuries. 
But unless we figured out how that pro-
cess worked, and unless we did it with 
data that other researchers would con-
sider valid, nobody would pay attention
to a word we said."
