uly 3rd kicked off the summertime festivities in Illinois, 
with the 4TH of .. ..y weekend and the 2005 Miss Nude 
USA Pageant in full swing. This year's location for the 
show of shows was the fabulous Gallery Showbar in Desoto, 
IL. Which has been deemed one of the wildest strip clubs in 
the state. One of the largest pageants on the circuit today, 
the USA's usually attracts some pretty big name features 
from the stage and screen. This vear was no exception, with 
entertainers from all over the U.5. converging on the great 
state of Illinois, for a shot at a very coveted title. The only 
other titles in this league are: Miss Nude Galaxy. Miss Nude 
World, Deja Vu's Showgirl of the Year, Miss Nude 
International and Miss Nude Universe. That's the ceiling. 
You can't get any higher than that in a performance 
pageant. Why are these carnal cavalcades of confusion. 
comedy and curvy contortionist's so important to feature 
entertainers in the adult business? The answer can be 
summed up in one word: "Credits." Credits are the claim to 
fame of every feature entertainer and porn star. Feature cir-
cuit entertainers need exposure to become a household 
word, whether it is magazine credits, pageant credits or 
(nowadays) television credits. (I.E. Springer, Geraldo, Jenny 
Jones etc.) Porn stars collect movie credits, box cover 
credits, stage, magazine and TV credits as well. It's all 
about "What you've won and what youve done.' And as 
they say in the business: "You're only as good as your last 
picture," which invokes constantly accumulating new cred-
its to stay in the industry spotlight. This is how the booking 
agents gauge your popJlarity, as well as your show price 
and movie prices. The more credits, the more cash, simple. 
Hardly so... titles, magazine covers and box cover's are 
sought out by all, and can take years to gather. But many 
performers work at it every day, and move up fast. Others 
a-e not so lucky. So the bottom line is obviously 
"Competitive. When you are competing for careers and 
cash, it is a serious business. But, the sweetest kittens usual-
ly have the sharpest claws, and nobody enters a pageant to 
be a runner-up. But, that drama and dedication is what 
feeds competition. 
Meanwhile at the hotel, the early birds that drove, lazed 
around the pool discussing strategies, but never revealing 
what their last and biggest show would be. The trust factor 
is very low in the competitive racks of stardom. It seems 
that one never boast's about an up coming performance. 
Not only is it bad luck, but also it is also like tipping your 
hand at poker... you must never give an opponent the edge, 
or you're fucked. 
Night one produced a standing room only 
audience down at the Gallery, with a line of patrons milling 
about out the door. They knew why they were here. It was 
going to be a melee of mammaries and a barrage of buxom 
booty, and probably the biggest pageant of feature enter-
tainers ever to hit town. Backstage, contestants ran amok 
getting ready for their shows. At least a dozen flavors of 
perfume clouded the air in the performer dressing room. 
Props were inspected, music was selected and high-fives 
were eagerly accepted. On stage, the competition heated 
up, with shows gaining more momentum throughout the 
entire week.
