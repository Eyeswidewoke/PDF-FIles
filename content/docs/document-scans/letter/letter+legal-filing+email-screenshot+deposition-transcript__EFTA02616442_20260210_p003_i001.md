I =ill digest this at length.. but let me be clear about today's =isit. I received a request this week from a collaborator and 
=riend of mine who was coming to campus to give a talk to meet and talk =ome physics. I decided I would fly down for 
the day to meet him rs it would save meeting him in Boston later this fall. I did not =now or plan this last week before 
our correspondence, and again, as I =ad written to you about possible visits and not received a response, I =ssumed 
coming down to see him and begin to look at the situation in my =ffice and get a better first hand assessment of what 
was necessary vis = vis packing and moving in May was not unreasonable. Dean =onzalez concurred with this 
assessment when we met today.

Dear Lawrence, 
rote: 
The settlement =greement unequivocally states that between now and your retirement date =f May 16, 2019, 
you remain "on leave with pay" and =E2 have no authority to act for or on behalf of ASU and shall make =o statements, 
including in any online profiles or social media websites =r in speaking engagements that misrepresent [your] status or 
=uthority." (Agreement at 9 1). Leave with pay, per =BOR6.201(3)(a), means that the faculty member is not to be on 
campus. =ou have been repeatedly reminded not to be on campus, most recently in =y email of November 1, which was 
unequivocal. 
Nor is your explanation =hat you assumed you could come to campus because I had not yet =esponded to your 
email of the same date a reasonable one. When we =orresponded only last week about the plan for removing your 
personal =roperty from your office, you indicated that you were not available to =ake an appointment to come to 
campus to pick up your property in the =ext two months and referenced a plan to attend a meeting on campus in 
=ebruary of next year and to clean out your office by May of next =ear. 
If you had today'= trip planned last week, you did not mention it, and if you planned it =fter our 
correspondence, you failed to advise me of your plans. Had you =one so, I would have reiterated the direction I 
previously provided =93 you are not to be on campus for any reason, unless we schedule a =pecific appointment for you 
to be here. Because you had not advised me =f your plans to be on campus today, I was in the process of preparing a 
=esponse to your emails, which necessarily included making inquiries =bout alternative methods of clearing out your 
office, given your =ndication that you were not able to make an appointment to do so this =alendar year. 
Here is that plan, which is not subject to negotiation. You =ill not return to campus, for any reason, without my 
express written =ermission obtained in advance. If you request permission, and I do not =espond, the absence of a 
response does not constitute permission. The =ersonal property in your office will be packed and shipped to you by =he
