The Insurance Act (The Act) will apply to all new insurances, renewals =nd any changes to insurance requirements 
effective on or after the 12th August 2016. The Act requires that a=fair presentation of the risk is made as failure to do 
so could result in =voidance of the policy and retention of the premium (if failure to make a =air presentation is 
deliberate or reckless), or of different terms being adopted to consider how the risk would have be=n underwritten had 
fair presentation been made, which could result in only=partial payment of any relevant claim. As your Broker we have 
a key =ole in ensuring that you are aware of and comply with the updated requirements. 
Insurance Law for contrac=s subject to the laws of England & Wales has changed since your last r=newal and, in order 
that you may comply with your obligations please be advised of the undernoted requirements, which differ=to those 
previously in place: 
Duty of Disclosure 
You have a duty to make a=fair presentation of the risk to the insurer, via Sturge Taylor & Asso=, of every material 
circumstance which you ( or a member of your organisation, employee, Captain, Crew, manageme=t team etc ► know 
or ought to know in relation to the risk placed and this=duty is applicable before the cover is placed, when it is renewed 
and at a=y time throughout the contract if the risk changes. A circumstance is material if it would influence the 
judgem=nt of an Insurer / Reinsurer in determining whether to take the risk and, =f so, on what terms. If you are in any 
doubt whether a circumstance =s material we recommend that it should be disclosed. 
Disclosure will be consid=red fair if it is made in a manner that is reasonably clear and accessible=and the facts 
represented are correct and made in good faith. Failure to disclose a material circumstance may entit=e an insurer to 
impose different terms on your cover or proportionately re=uce the amount of any claim payable. In the event that 
non-disclosur= was deliberate or reckless an insurer will be entitled to avoid the policy from inception and retain the 
premium paid= This would result in any claims under the policy not being paid. 
Conditions Precedent</=pan> 
You must also take partic=lar note of any conditions precedent that appear in the policy. If a=condition precedent to the 
validity of this policy or to the commencement of the risk is not complied with, the insurer will =ot come on risk. If a 
condition precedent to the Insurers liability =nder this policy is not complied with, the insurer may not be liable for t=e 
loss in question. A condition precedent may exist in the policy using other terminology and without reference to t=e 
words 'condition precedent'. 
It is very important that=you read the full policy carefully when it is received and, if you are uns=re of, or are unable to 
comply with any provisions therein, please let Sturge Taylor & Assoc know immediately.=/span> 
<=p> 
Contracting Out</=:p> 
Some Insurers have exerci=ed their right to opt out of the requirements of the new act. In the event=that this effects the 
insurances we have placed for you we will advise you accordingly.
