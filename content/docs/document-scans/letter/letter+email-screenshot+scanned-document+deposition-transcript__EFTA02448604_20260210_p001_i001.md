Hi Both, 
Yesterday, I spoke to Ray on skype. I don't know if =ou know his paper url below, 
http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/metrics?id=10.1371%2Fjou=nal.pone.0121791 
but he is =truggling with the same. questions that we are. What is the =hannel for these experiences. He feels that we 
are both at the =utting edge of Neuroscience and would very much like to work with us. =lena, since you are the fMRI 
guru of the group, would you be =appy to include Ray in the team? He is outstanding and I am =ure could take us a leap 
forward. I have looked him up on the internet =nd he is the main fMRI guy for Princeton. 
I described our experiment to Ray and he was =ery excited. He has been doing some work on communication in fMRI 
=canners in which there are two people, and is essentially =efining two channels of information between two people. 
One =hannel carries conventional information and the other does not. =is concept is of a representation of the external 
world within the =rain which limits the transfer of information and which is not involved =ith the second channel. 
People who are exceptional can make =nbsp;a limited area of their cortex work while others use the Cartesian 
=epresentation of their world with the severe limitations that this has =n activating cortical areas directly. It is as if this 
=epresentation is removed in people like Alain. Of course this =ight represent awakening, so a more direct view to an 
alternative =hannel becomes available. This of course is in line with the =ransmissional view of consciousness. 
He has published =ne paper on this subject for which I have given you the url. We =eed new words for energy. He 
argues that the light we see from =lain is travelling down this alternative pathway and is not directly =elated to photons. 
Remember the goggles attenuated some brain =unction but did not alter the gamma and people could still 'see' 
=omething. 
We could =rgue for one channel carrying information about the energy people feel =nd some of the light but not all. He 
is wanting to complete his =ew paper with his new ideas on which he has been working for two years =nd hopes to 
publish soon. He describes the enormous problem =nyone has when trying to publish radically new =ata. 
I would =ery much like to pursue this further. If you would like Ray to be =n board (Elena this is your call), Alain has 
agreed to go to =rinceton so Ray can look at him (I have not mentioned this to Ray until = know what you both think). 
Lena, one of the structures which =ights up in the alternative channel is the precuneus (he didn't tell =e the other ones) 
but with a 2-3% increase only. Would you be =ble to look at this and we can discuss this later. 
Joy, =e will need to get the paper published asap or submitted for its first =ejection (he'd had many), but we must decide 
exactly what we are =oing for. I suggest a longer paper with input from the results of =ocial functioning. If we do 
decide to go forward I would be =appy to go to Paris when Jeffrey comes across to try and get =oney for a more 
advanced study. If you're happy to include Ray =n the team then I will ask him if he could do one or two experiments on 
=lain but I don't want to do this till Elena decides if she =nbsp;want's to go forward on this exciting =roject. 
Yours in hope for an =xciting study!
