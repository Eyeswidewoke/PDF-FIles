questioning to be humiliating or prying - she assumes it is the terms of the trust and the trustees are just doing their 
jobs. 
In Harry's case, at one point in the mid-1990s he unexpectedly owed $60=000 due to the Alternative Minimum 
Tax as a result of receiving stock options.=C2 He discussed this with Mommoy and her accountant, and they decided she 
would lend him the money to pay the taxes and he would pay her back once he had a chance to exercise and liquidate 
the stock options, several months later. 
In the current situation, the reason we are asking you questions now (and never before) is that now we are 
hearing from you repeatedly that your financial situation is dire. We decided to ask you about your financi=l 
circumstances - not lightly, as we said in one of our many emails, but after much thought, given that we could see that 
your concern about it was causing you a great deal of stress and was leading to you taking import=nt and possibly 
unnecessarily radical decisions. We continue to feel that you are misinterpreting your financial situation, and that this is 
causing you considerable anguish. It pains us greatly to see this, as we've sai= before. 
We can tell from your tax requests that you have been spending many hundred= of thousands of dollars every 
year on personal expenses, even after having successfully eliminated the extra costs that you have mentioned as a drain 
on your resources (the Cape house, the gifts, Anthony's salary, etc). T=is is far out of alignment with what we know 
about your lifestyle. You and Valeria should live in comfo=t together -- no need to adhere to your old, fairly austere 
living conditions -- but your expenditures seem to go far beyond that, and seem to keep rising. This makes us worry and 
makes us want to intervene to try to help. It also makes the trustees worry that you are not managing your finances 
with attention to your possible lifelong needs. Nothing in the long and detailed letters you've s=nt us can begin to 
explain why your personal spending has shot up the way it has. We can see only little pieces of your situation, because 
of the secretive posture you've adopted in recent years, but the pieces we do see suggest a set of problems very 
different from the ones you've descr=bed. 
We hope this helps to explain our position and our real concern. You are right that in our last emails (and in this 
one) we haven't gone point b= point through your affirmations, explaining our different understanding of the basic facts, 
but as we said at the beginning of this email, we tried to do that in the past and it didn't work. We truly hope we can find 
a way to talk openly about the situation. 
Love, Avi, Diane and Harry

Re: Fwd: Marital Trusts 
I just don't understand this. I've explained the facts in det=il, repeatedly, with no response. You've told me that 
you have a diff=rent understanding of the basic facts, but haven't told me what it is, or wh=t are the questions to which 
you want answers other than what I have told you. That is why communication cannot proceed. So, yes, frustra=ing. 
Evidently you regard this as an adversarial proceeding, requiring a mediato=. I don't understand this either. I 
thought we were a family discus=ing matters relating to us. I have no idea what a mediator would before.=C2 
Mediating what? Another reason for my frustration.
