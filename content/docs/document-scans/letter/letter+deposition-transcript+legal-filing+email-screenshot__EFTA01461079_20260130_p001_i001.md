Special Report: Euroglut here to stay: trillions of outflows to go 
current account shows that despite two decades of large surpluses. Finland never 
turned into a mature credit economy. The peak NIIP of 15% in 2010 failed to 
generate considerable investment income to stabilize the current account against 
trade deficits. If Europe is to live off its foreign assets one day, it will probably 
need to accumulate a much larger NIIP, similar to Japan, Norway, or Switzerland. 
Conclusion 
Since we first introduced our Euroglut thesis last September the European current 
account surplus has reached a new record high, while EUR/USD has had its 
biggest yearly drop since 1985. We view the two developments as entirely 
consistent: the Eurozone's current account surplus is a symptom of a large pool of 
excess savings looking for investable assets abroad. Negative rates and 
quantitative easing from the ECB have engineered an acute problem of asset 
shortage in Europe, in turn initiating a process of large-scale capital flight. Over the 
last few months, more than 8300bn worth of capital has left Europe. 
In this paper we take our analysis a step further, and attempt to estimate the scale 
of likely future outflows. We argue that, like Japan, Europeans will need to turn 
into net creditors to the rest of the world to mirror structurally higher saving 
preferences. In turn this means that Europe's negative net international investment 
position needs to turn positive. Europeans will need to own more foreign assets 
than foreigners do in Europe. We estimate that this new equilibrium will require at 
least 4 trillion EUR of additional outflows from Europe over the next few years. 
The investment implications of our Euroglut thesis therefore remain intact. 
First, we continue to expect broad-based euro weakness. European outflows have 
been even bigger than our initial (high) expectations over the last six months, so 
we are revising our EUR/USD forecasts lower. We now foresee a move down to 
1.00 by the end of the year and a new cycle low of 85cents by 2017. 
Second, we expect continued European inflows into foreign assets, particularly 
fixed income. Our earlier work demonstrated that the primary destination of 
European outflows will be core fixed income markets in the rest of the world. and 
evidence over the last few months supports these trends: most European 
outflows have gone to the US, UK and Canada. 
Finally, we see Euroglut as continuing to constrain monetary policy across the 
European continent for the foreseeable future. Since our paper in September 
central banks in Switzerland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, the Czech Republic and 
Poland have all cut rates (most to negative), intervened in FX markets or started 
QE. All these countries run large current account surpluses. Through a unique mix 
of large excess savings and structurally low yields, the entire European continent 
will continue to be a major source of global imbalances for the rest of this decade.
