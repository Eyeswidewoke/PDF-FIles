The drivers of our full S&P 500 intrinsic value model 
Most of our valuation model inputs are fairly straightforward and typical of any intrinsic 
value model; such as interest rates, risk premiums, retained earnings ratio, return on 
reinvestment, etc. But our normalized EPS input tends to require additional explanation. 
Understanding our normalized EPS estimates 
We assess EPS normality or sustainability by evaluating the ability of current year EPS 
to grow at a healthy rate over the next several years. If EPS cannot grow at a healthy 
rate, which we approximate as the nominal cost of equity less the expected dividend 
yield, then current year EPS must be considered cyclically peaked. It is not enough for 
EPS to merely grow; in order to be considered normal or sustainable, EPS must grow at 
a rate that yields a return equal to the cost of equity on any additionally retained EPS. 
Let us explain further using our S&P 500 EPS estimates. Although our 2015E S&P 500 
EPS is $119, we think $122 better represents normalized S&P 500 EPS for 2015. Apart 
from Energy and Managed Health Care, we think 2015 earnings generally represent 
normal mid-cycle earning for most sectors. We think Energy is under earnings in 2015 
and parts of Health Care and some other industries over earnings. We think Managed 
Health Care (HMOs) profits could drift lower on higher industry taxes, limits to premium 
hikes and the mix of new enrollees weighted towards elderly or with pre-existing 
conditions. Our $122 normalized EPS estimate for 2015 captures the outlook for 
improving profitability at Energy and weakness to come at HMOs. We consider our 
2016E EPS of $125 to be roughly $2 shy of fully normalized mid-cycle earnings. 
Comparing EPS growth expected over the next several years to a value neutral hurdle 
rate is how we capture the magnitude of current cyclical EPS distortions and the time it 
should take to return to healthy long-term growth in our normalized EPS estimates. 
ki'Vhy an accounting quality adjustment to normalized EPS' 
We deduct $12 from our normalized S&P 500 EPS estimate for accounting quality. Pro 
forma or non-GAAP EPS tends to overstate and GAAP EPS tends to understate true 
EPS. A good measure of EPS should capture what FCF per share would be when no 
investments are made for growth. At steady-state EPS = FCF/sh = DPS. 
An EPS discount model versus a dividend discount model e<plained 
In a dividend growth or free cash flow discount model, future flows can be discounted 
directly because earlier period flows should be reduced by investments that fed growth. 
However, earnings growth cannot be discounted directly because earnings growth fails 
to account for what portion of prior period earnings were retained to feed growth. Thus. 
an EPS discount model must separate EPS growth into two parts: 1) growth from 
reinvestment at returns equal to the cost of equity, 2) growth from returns in excess of 
the cost of equity or economic profit growth. Our EPS discount model calculates value 
by taking the present value of growth in economic profits (not ordinary profits) and 
adds this to the capitalized value of current normalized EPS. 
DCF: Value = PV of all future free cash flows 
DDM: Value = PV of all future dividends 
Economic Profit Model: Value = book value plus all future economic profits 
Incremental EP Model: Value = capitalized EPS plus all future economic profit growth 
Once economic profit growth stops, equity value is simply EPS capitalized at the real 
cost of equity. This is because EPS growth only adds to steady-state value (EPS/real

Intrinsic value drivers: 
I) Normalized EPS 
2) Accounting adjustments 
3) Long-term real interest rate 
4) Equity risk premium 
61 Growth premium 
Inflation affects EPS quality, 
and the risk premium. 
We reduce our pro tonna 
normalized EPS est to ensure 
that it represents steady-state 
FCF per share and DPS. 
Our normalized S&P 500 EPS 
estimate is the main driver of 
our intrinsic value model. 
The mechanics of our model 
are equivalent to a DDM.
