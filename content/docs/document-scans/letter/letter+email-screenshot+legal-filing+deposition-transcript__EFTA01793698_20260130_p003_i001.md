grid cells.) But processes such as cloud formation, turbulence and rain all happen on much smaller scales. These critical 
processes then appear in the model only through adjustable assumptions that specify, for example, how the average 
cloud cover depends on a grid box's average temperature and humidity. In a given model, dozens of such assumptions 
must be adjusted ("tuned," in the jargon of modelers) to reproduce both current observations and imperfectly known 
historical records. 
We often hear that there is a "scientific consensus" about climate change. But as far as the computer models go, there 
isn't a useful consensus at the level of detail relevant to assessing human influences. Since 1990, the United Nations 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC, has periodically surveyed the state of climate science. Each 
successive report from that endeavor, with contributions from thousands of scientists around the world, has come to be 
seen as the definitive assessment of climate science at the time of its issue.

There is little doubt in the scientific community that continually growing amounts of greenhouse gases in the 
atmosphere, due largely to carbon-dioxide emissions from the conventional use of fossil fuels, are influencing the 
climate. Pictured, an estuary in Patgonia. Gallery Stock 
For the latest IPCC report (September 2013), its Working Group I, which focuses on physical science, uses an ensemble 
of some 55 different models. Although most of these models are tuned to reproduce the gross features of the Earth's 
climate, the marked differences in their details and projections reflect all of the limitations that I have described. For 
example: 
• The models differ in their descriptions of the past century's global average surface temperature by more than three 
times the entire warming recorded during that time. Such mismatches are also present in many other basic climate 
factors, including rainfall, which is fundamental to the atmosphere's energy balance. As a result, the models give widely 
varying descriptions of the climate's inner workings. Since they disagree so markedly, no more than one of them can be 
right. 
• Although the Earth's average surface temperature rose sharply by 0.9 degree Fahrenheit during the last quarter of the 
20th century, it has increased much more slowly for the past 16 years, even as the human contribution to atmospheric 
carbon dioxide has risen by some 25%. This surprising fact demonstrates directly that natural influences and variability 
are powerful enough to counteract the present warming influence exerted by human activity. 
Yet the models famously fail to capture this slowing in the temperature rise. Several dozen different explanations for 
this failure have been offered, with ocean variability most likely playing a major role. But the whole episode continues to 
highlight the limits of our modeling. 
• The models roughly describe the shrinking extent of Arctic sea ice observed over the past two decades, but they fail to 
describe the comparable growth of Antarctic sea ice, which is now at a record high. 
• The models predict that the lower atmosphere in the tropics will absorb much of the heat of the warming atmosphere. 
But that "hot spot" has not been confidently observed, casting doubt on our understanding of the crucial feedback of 
water vapor on temperature. 
• Even though the human influence on climate was much smaller in the past, the models do not account for the fact that 
the rate of global sea-level rise 70 years ago was as large as what we observe today—about one foot per century. 
• A crucial measure of our knowledge of feedbacks is climate sensitivity—that is, the warming induced by a hypothetical 
doubling of carbon-dioxide concentration. Today's best estimate of the sensitivity (between 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit and
