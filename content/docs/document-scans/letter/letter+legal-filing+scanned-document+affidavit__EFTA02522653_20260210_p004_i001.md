reasons for the staffer leaving. Ms. Beauchamp remained an employee of CFI (and went on the Galapagos cruise with 
Krauss). 
=ou mentioned also the comments that were made to me in March 2012 by Melody 
Hensley. Let me give you the background for that. CFI was holding an event prior to the 2012 Reason Rally in DC. Richard 
Dawkins, Jessica Alquist, Jamie Raskin, and Lawrence Krauss were scheduled to speak at the event. Melody Hensley was 
heavily involved in the planning for the event and in fact was tapped to make introductions for the speakers, including 
Krauss. (At the time she was in charge of the DC local branch.) During the planning for the event she gave no indication 
whatsoever that she had any hesitation about introducing or dealing with Krauss. (I will forward you some email 
correspondence confirming this.) 
=s I recall, Krauss's schedule resulted in his planned arrival being a little later than the 
others. As it turned out, he was even further delayed. At some point when it became clear that Krauss was going to be 
late, Hensley turned to me and said, "I know why Kra=ss isn't coming; he's embarrassed to see me." I asked Hensley 
what she mea=t by this. She said Krauss had made a pass at her several years earlier and she had rebuffed him. I asked 
for some details. She said she was in a hotel room with him (I can't recall whether she said it was Krauss's hotel room, 
but I t=ink it was), and that Krauss tried to kiss her. She pushed him away and said she wasn't interested. I asked if 
Krauss persisted; she said he did not. Thinking out loud, I believe I said something to the effect of 'well, if you want t= 
make a complaint you probably can, although I'm not sure our policy at that time w=uld cover that.' Ms. Hensley said 
she was not interested in making a formal complaint. 
=s. Hensley's statement that I "responded to her with silence" is absolutely false and I 
categorically and= unqualifiedly deny it. We talked about her concern, as indicated. Ms. Hensley= recall must be failing 
her. 
=iven the passage of time (six years), the fact that Hensley did not want to pursue the 
matter, the fact that Krauss desisted when Hensley indicated she wasn't interested, the fact th=t Hensley didn't even 
seem very bothered by the incident (as indicated, she had expressed no hesitation in seeing Krauss), and the fact that 
we had no policy covering conduct by nonemployees back in 2006 (in fact, CFI's zero-toler=nce policy covering 
employees themselves was not implemented until 2007, I believe -- I was just hired as the attorney in July 2006), I 
decided not to do any further about this particular incident. However, the incident, along with observations I heard at 
the Women in Secularism conference which we held later in the spring of 2012 (observations which did not mention 
Krauss, but rather some speakers at non-CFI events), was a factor in my thinking about the need for a policy covering 
conduct by invited speakers and guests at CFI conferences. 
=s. Hensley made no other complaint to me about Krauss, nor did she ever express to 
me her belief that we should not invite Krauss to events. 
=n closing, let me state that any accusations stating that I neglected to take harassment 
complaints seriously are false. Furthermore, I would regard them as a malicious attack on my character and my 
professional reputation. 
=incerely, 
=onald A. Lindsay
