half was spent in taxes and management fees for the entire estate. Cape house, Alex&=39;s medical expenses and other 
gifts, Anthony's salary, etc., were from nec=ssary withdrawals over and above the mandatory withdrawal, hence subject 
to exorb=tant taxes, requiring additional withdrawal. That is before we even get to ordinary living expenses. The 
request had nothing at all to do with personal expenses, as you can see by just looking at my letters and running through 
the arithmetic. So the one case you now mention is flatly incorrect. 
But this tells us how to proceed: tell me explicitly what you have in mind, and then we can proceed in a reasonable 
fashion. 
There's a simple way out of this impasse -- not by setting up an advers=ry proceeding with a mediator, as you suggest, 
but by you telling me what you disagree with in what i have outlined to you and what your reasons are. You have not 
yet done that in a single letter. So, simply, why not do it right now, and then we can proceed. 
Again, I've repeatedly spelled out the circumstances in extensive detai=. So, simply, tell me what you disagree with and 
why. No mediators are necessary, just a direct response. Or if you feel that you have already done so, then re-send the 
letter in which you responded to my detai=ed account, telling me what you disagree with and why. 
Meanwhile, while the impasse continues, I'm compelled to face constant aggravating and painful circumstances, not to 
speak of humiliating demands and by now significant costs. That can end if we simply resolve these matters quickly in a 
straightforward and simple way. 
I haven't responded to the last part of your letter because it doesni=;t relate to the matter at hand. I was referring to 
Max's radical sh=ft in stand, not to how affairs were managed in the past. To repeat, when distributions were made to 
family from the IRA, and taxes and manageme=t fees for the entire estate were drawn from the IRA -- exhausting the 
mandat=ry withdrawal -- Max, my lawyer, raised no question about the financial circum=tances of the beneficiaries, nor 
should he have done so. But when i am requesting tax payments from the marital trust that was set up for M and me 
and the survivor for our lifetimes, all of a sudden he is making exorbitant and humiliating demands. What you describe 
below has nothing to do with this simple matter.

Dear Doddoy, 
, Harry Chomsky 
We've tried to talk to you about your financial situation several times over the past couple of years, in person, by phone, 
and by e-mail. The process has been extremely unpleasant for us, and we presume for you as well. More importantly, it 
has not led to any enlightenment on any of our parts. Much of what we've tried to say you have flatly denied; some of it 
we think you simply haven't understood. You se=m absolutely convinced that your beliefs are correct and absolutely 
uninteres=ed in trying to look at the situation in other ways, to the extent that you can't even remember these 
exchanges. Much of what you've said=to us conflicts directly with our personal knowledge of your history and with legal 
and financial advice from every source we've heard from. So the conversations lead only to more stress and heartache. 
We are not willing to continue trying to discuss this with you unless somet=ing changes. One change would be to 
include a professional in the convers=tion who can resolve our differences in belief about basic facts. However, you 
have apparently decided that because you disapprove of some of the suggestions made by your former lawyer and
