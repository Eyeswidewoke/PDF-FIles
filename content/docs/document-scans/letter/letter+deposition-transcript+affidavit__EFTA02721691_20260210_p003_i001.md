4. After December, I met w/ Rick Smith again in January 2014 in Brazil and had a very 
honest conversation about the entire situation. He asked me to send evidence which I did 
in February (the ppt you have). But when I met Dick Cashin in feb, he said he was not the 
person to discuss this, and threw the decision back to Rick. However, Dick Cashin stated 
that we made "too much money" over the years and that this needed to end as things 
changed in JPM. In early March 2014 I asked Rick if he had reviewed the evidence, and to 
date he said he has not had time. I am supposed to follow up this Friday. Other people 
internally aware of this are their internal legal counsel, Judah Shechter, Kathy Bryan, the 
CFO (an ex-JPM) and Fritz Hobbs, a close friend to Cashin who is on our side and knows 
how bad the Brazil OEP'ers behaved. 
5. My plan is to (i) drop out of the 3 boards I sit in at the Brazil portfolio companies they/I 
invested in; (ii) Get paid the fee for Cless deal (hair products) 
that was signed in February 2014 and has a closing next week (they said they would pay), 
and (iii) right after get a lawyer to press them to pay for Unicoba. While they offered to 
pay 2 more months of retainer (260k) as a "recognition of good work" but in fact to be a 
cut of the 1M due, I did not accept as I said we did do work and they need to fulfill the 
agreement. 
6. OEP's situation is pretty critical - they were for sale until now. I know that the JPM top 
exec supervising them - Matt Zames - has been very much on top of their business, costs, 
selling, pulling back etc and making their life difficult. So part of what they say is that 
"things changed", that they need to figure out what will be of OEP, that these are new 
times and paying anything needs to be much justified etc. 
A top lawyer very close to me here suggested to connect mew/ litigation attorney 
Michael Carlinsky. I just want OEP to pay what they owe me as that is the right thing, and 
if getting the lawyer is the most effective way (even if just to put pressure) I will do that. If 
going through another path is worthwhile (like asking some big clients to complain or 
speaking to someone who can influence), ready to learn what that would be. Its important 
to say that we still have equity in two other deals here (so we are their partners), that are 
worth at least 10x what they owe us in the unicoba fee. So I don't want to put that at risk, 
even though we have contracts there. 
They are a firm run by men who do not think very highly of women. No women partners 
on the investment side. So they really look at me thinking I will bend and do nothing. I can 
be very patient. 
thoughts?
