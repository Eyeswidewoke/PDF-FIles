Re: 
Hi =effrey, I apologize for not getting back to you earlier with more =nformation about our dinochicken summit, as I left 
immediately on a =ouple lecture trips, one of which was to Madrid, from which I returned =ome early this morning. In 
Madrid I did a TED like talk and then =y wife Vanessa and I did a couple of joint lectures on the Dinochicken =roject to 
the National Museum (of natural History) developmental =iology folks and a high school genetics class, both in Madrid. 
It =as fun! 
The summit was very interesting, and =ertainly helped the different groups get a handle on what each group is =p too. 
Of course, only two of our groups are actually working on =he project, as the Georgia group is simply proposing to help 
out. =nbsp;The first talk was by Hans Larsson and he discussed the different =rocesses he and his post docs had 
attempted, one of which was very =nteresting. They had stuck a tiny tube around the developing tail =f an early embryo 
to confine the the area in which the vertebral =omites form with the hope that the tubing would direct cell growth in a 
=ong linear direction rather than expanding laterally. Their =ope was that extra somites might form. Interestingly it 
appears =rom their initial experiments that that happened, but now they have to =etermine if extra somites formed or 
whether instead, it pushed the =elvic girdle forward simply exposing more somites. Either way, it =as an interesting 
experiment showing that simple modifications could =Iter the morphology in pretty extreme =ays. 
The Georgia group talked about a variety =f things including creating transgenic chickens, enameling teeth, =hanging 
limb proportions, and changing mouth shape for inclusion of =eeth. Brian Conde, who has worked on multi-site, =ulti-
investigator projects discussed systems for data sharing and =nalysis. Basically how we would go about text mining and 
data =haring and storage. 
Susan Chapman of Clemson =niversity, who I brought in at the last minute, and who studies chicken =ails, talked about 
her research on a chicken called and arucana which =s rumpless, missing its tail. 
At the end my =ost docs talked about their current gene screens to determine timing of =evelopment and apoptosis of 
the hands and =ail. 
I would very much like to share the =ideos with you, but am not sure how to proceed as they are quite large =iles. 
Everyone was really happy with the =ummit, and the group has put together their proposal of which they have =n their 
dropbox site which I would like to share with you if there is a =ay to do so. I will also send it once I have evaluated it. 
=nbsp;it was completed while I was away, and I need to explain a few =hings about it that they as a group would not 
know, particularly about =ome portions which would not be tax deductible. =nbsp; 
As for my personal life, I just =sked Vanessa how she thought it was going and she said that since we =ad just spent a 
week together in another country and she had not given =ny thought to killing me, it was a good sign. : ) She and I get 
=long just great, but then we are both dino nerds and work virtually all =he time. 
Hope you are doing great as well!! =nbsp;Please give my best to the girls. 
All the =est, 
Jack
