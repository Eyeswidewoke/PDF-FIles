Day 7 
Our current position is N 15.52 and W 48.29, winds are 14 to 16 knots, and =e are reaching under spinnaker, main, and 
mizzen. We have 780 miles to An=igua. The engine has not ben turned on since the Cape Verdes. 
Not much to write today, save for the recent, frequent visits from "man on = boats— best friend, the dolphin. Since last 
night, a couple of dolphins=have come by every two hours or so for a bit of play time. I do not know =Fly, but dolphins 
always look so darn carefree and happy. 
I want to write a quick "shout out" for Jon Barrett, the manager of Bequia.= When you build a custom yacht, you need to 
be very aware, that delivery o= your new boat just means you need to start immediately to renovate (and = don't care 
who builds her). Under Jon's guidance, Bequia has changed pum=s, hydraulics, and remounted much of her mechanics. 
Jon has suggested many=other improvements. In addition to finding Seumas and handling the boats f=nances, Jon has 
made Bequia a better boat, and has made her pure pleasure =or the owner. 
Jon has also been part of rebuilding, not once but twice, the greatest sail=ng yacht on the water, Endeavor. And he was 
navigator on Bequia's success=ul run at the Loro Piana Cup. 
Looks like tomorrow night might be the only possible bad weather between us=and the Carribean. The forecast is for 
fairly high seas. We will see. 
In a good sign, I forgot what day it was today. The ocean is all around al= day, and an explosion of stars each night 
begins to warp time, I guess.
