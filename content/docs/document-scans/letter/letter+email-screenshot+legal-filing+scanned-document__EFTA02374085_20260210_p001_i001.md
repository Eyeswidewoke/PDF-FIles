Re: 
I am meeting Swanson again on Thursday. H=re is the state of play. 
In our meeting Saturday he was ok with 18% for 1 year (to dovetail wi=h theextended term of the first) with such 
security arrangements beside th= mortgage (new LLC or amended LLC operating agreement) as were acceptable =o you 
and TD. 
I also mentioned a point or point and a half. If you agree, I t=ought this could fund an upfront fee for me. 
He said he was concerned about renegotiating the existing subordination agr=ement between TD and Kosoy (it evidently 
took a long time) and wanted some=time to think through it and perhaps talk to TD. (The team dealing with hi= is in 
transition in part because TD is moving out the old Mercantile peop=e.) He also was agreeable to sharing a percentage 
of the profit which I l=kened to the deals he does with backers who earn a guaranteed return and S=%. He noted that he 
had put all the capital up and seemed to suggest a pro=rata alloocation based on your $10M compared to the amount 
he has in =net of what he borrowed out (We'll see what that looks like.) I tied that =o adding me or an entity as a 
member of the LLC which is also necessary gi=en the operating agreement provisions which we are considering. 
He asked for some time to think things through and we are to meet again on =hursday late afternoon. I am sure he is 
considering his alternatives (if a=y) too. 
He also wanted time to think about the issues I raised about the 11.0 operat=ng agreement (whether a new LLC or 
amending the existing operating agreeme=t.). These were requiring unanimous consent for: seeking bankruptcy 
protec=ion, adding new members, creating new debt, refinancing existing debt, or =urther amendment. The OA would 
also provide for his removal as a man=ger on default under either mortgage. An open point is whether unani=ity should 
be required to agree to a sale of the house. I was thinking set=ing an agreed value range. An entity (trust or other LLC) 
would beco=e a member with that percentage still under negotiation. 
I am sure he is also thinking about the percentage of the LLC interest to o=fer. 
I asked about the existing LLC. He confirmed it was a single asset, single =ember LLC with no significant other debt 
outside of the ordinary course (m=intenance). The member is a trust fbo him and his wife. As you know, taxes= 
insurance and interest are reserved and TD would require the same for any=extended term. Dan expects some increase 
in real estate taxes next year (a=sessments come out over the summer).The 2010 tax appraisal is $7,497,000 v= 
$13,611,000 in 2008. He paid $20,800,000 in August 2007 (plus commission =ay $21,600,000.) He says he has had good 
results working with the appraise=s office. We'll see. 
I asked him to involve his accountant about the income tax consequences of =ransferring the house to a new LLC or 
adding a member and also the outstan=ing liabilities and payables of the LLC. 
I have a follow up call with a bankruptcy lawyer today on the enforceabilit= of the protections we are discussing. 
Swanson wants to close by the end of June. 
Please let me know what you are thinking.
