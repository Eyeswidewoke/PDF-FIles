The recent=tragedy in Paris has triggered a strong emotional response as events of this grisly nature usually do. The 
depth of feeling across a wide range of person= and cultures owes much to its being an act of terror in an age that has 
bec=me largely defined as the "terrorism era." Si=ce 9/11 Western societies have lived in a state of anticipatory fear and 
that dread has been kept alive by occasional acts of terrorism, as in London, Ma=rid and Boston. The rise of ISIL has 
been accompanied by a spate of anxious speculation that residents of Western cou=tries who have been drawn to the 
new theater of jihad could return home dedicated=to committing mayhem. In this context, the Paris killings have made 
tangible otherwise abstract fears. Emotional release follows - emotions of anger (revenge for some), sympathy for the 
victims, a bond of solidarity across religious lines in an affirmation of shared humanity as reflected in the march in Paris 
last week and other sympathetic events around the world. 
Concurrent=y it is evident that a number of these heinous events in Western Europe, North Amer=ca, Middle East and 
elsewhere are the acts of home grown terrorist who after go=ng abroad where they were proselytized and trained 
radical clerics and seasone= harden fighter in Syria, Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia, Afghanistan and elsewhere. Herein lies 
the dilemma of how should governments dea= with returning jihadists if they want to prevent more acts like the recent 
massacre in Paris and the bombing of the Boston Marathon several years ago?=/span> 
Although the media and others try ignore, terrorism in a number of Western countries has roots=in racism -- as well as 
the cultural distance reinforced by the inescapable callousness that comes with the repetition of nothingness. It is 
easy=to understand how a young unemployed person living in an ethic ghetto with little or no prospects in a world of 
abundan=e that he is not a part of — and then he is told that not only is he inferior but so is his religion to that of the 
=ominant culture —can be seduced by jihad 
=s a result are seeing a growing influx of Europeans returning from Syria and Iraq having joined terrorist organizations. 
This is a heterogeneous group: Some a=e highly traumatized and disillusioned. Others return from a few months of 
"terror tourism" and post pictures of themselves online, armed with guns and little more =C24>The dangerous 
individuals are those who return tasked with carrying out acts of terror. They come back to recruit fighters or to spread 
propagan=a; some have military experience and want to live out their violent fantasies =n Europe. 
<=pan style="font-size:l2pt;font-family:Georgia,serif"> 
One of the things that we know is that the terror attacks in Paris highlight are a growing tr=nd: Young Western Muslims 
who enlisted for jihad in the Middle East are coming home. Denmark is trying to rehabilitate them. In much=of Europe, 
prosecutors have put them in prison, where they have found kindred spirits. But sometimes, as with the Paris killers, 
they fall thr=ugh the cracks. 
< / = > 
At the same time we should remember that for generations, Americans have decamped to fight in orher people's wars, 
whether as freedom fighters, terrorists, colonists, or mercenaries. Sometimes the U.S. Government supports these 
mostly young idealists or turns a blind eye. No one kept Americans from volunteering to fight In the Lincoln Brigade 
against Franco or today stop Americans from joining the Israeli army or the Western-favoring Syrian opposition groups.

Some decisions in life are irrevocable. Joining ISIS or Al Qaeda is one of them.=C24, Most people would say that joining 
such terrorist organizations should be ground= for losing your citizenship which would invalidate your passport.
