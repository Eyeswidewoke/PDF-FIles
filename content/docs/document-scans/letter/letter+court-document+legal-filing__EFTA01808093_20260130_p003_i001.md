Subject: RE: Te Manu - Myla Trestiza = 16/237 
Dear Allan 
Following =n from my email below, I have now received confirmation from CEGA that =he Makati Medical 
Centre is chasing for payment of an outstanding =nvoice totalling PHP 121,972.73. I understand that the clinic are now 
=hasing frequently for payment and therefore insurers are being pressed =or settlement as soon as possible. I 
understand that Myla has herself =ncurred some expenses directly and also covered some costs incurred at =his clinic, 
but the majority of the treatment costs at this clinic =emain unpaid. 
I understand from CEGA that there is mention of treatment =ithin the outstanding invoice for a condition which 
is possibly not =elated to the subject matter of this claim. CEGA have been trying to =btain further information from 
Myla directly to assess cover for this =dditional treatment but regrettably, I understand that information has =ot been 
forthcoming. Unless Myla can provide the additional information =o CEGA that is requested, it is likely that the costs 
associated for =his additional condition, totalling PHP 7,245.00 will not be able to be =onsidered by insurers and will 
therefore be for the Insured's / =yla's account. 
With this in mind, if the Insured would like the outstanding =linic costs to be settled directly by Insurers as part 
of this claim, I =ould be most grateful if you could please urgently arrange for the =nsured to completed and return the 
attached claim form. Unfortunately, =nderwriters cannot process any settlement under the policy until a =ompleted 
claim form has been received. I would also be most grateful if =yla could please respond to CEGA with the additional 
information =equested by them so that the secondary treatment can be assessed. 
If Myla / =he Insured have incurred additional medical expenses that they would =ike to submit for 
consideration, I look forward to receiving copies of =he expenses including the original invoices detailing the treatment 
in =uestion, in due course. Please note that the claim will be subject =nbsp;to the policy excess of the first USD 200.00. 
Conversely,=if the Insured no longer wish to pursue this matter as a claim under =he policy, please advise and I 
can arrange for the outstanding clinic =nvoice to be forwarded for the Insured to settle directly. 
I trust =hat you find this to be in order and await your advices as to how you =ish to proceed. 
Kind regards
