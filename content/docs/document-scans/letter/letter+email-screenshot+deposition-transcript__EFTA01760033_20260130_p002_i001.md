the conflict. News agencies reported that more than 100 we=e killed (some activists claim the death toll was much 
higher), many of wh=m were civilians. As the death toll rises, the humanitarian situation cont=nues to worsen to the 
extent that the UN high commissioner for refugees an=ounced last week that approximately 8,000 Syrians flee the 
country every d=y. 
&n=sp; 
Jorda=: While there are conflicting reports, it appears that Jordan may =ave given the Israeli government a green light to 
send drones into Syria t=rough Jordanian airspace. The drones are intended to collect information a=d conduct 
reconnaissance missions but are also capable of carrying missile=. If this is true, it could indicate a willingness by Jordan 
to counter th= spillover risks more actively, particularly after the April 18th announcement that the Pentagon would be 
sending about 200 troops and arm= planners to Jordan. 
Palestinians: International support for Hamas will get=another boost during the Turkish prime minster's upcoming visit 
to G=za. While the visit was discouraged by US Secretary of State John Kerry, T=rkish Prime Minister Erdogan remains set 
on visiting at the end of May. Th= visit, as well as a recent trip by Palestinian Authority President Mahmou= Abbas to 
Turkey, has led to press speculation that Turkey is positioning =tself to assume what has been Egypt's role as an honest 
broker in of=-discussed reconciliation talks between Hamas and Fatah. Alternatively, th= Turkish prime minister may be 
trying to balance his recent acceptance of =n apology from Israel's Prime Minister Netanyahu for Israeli Defense=Forces' 
stopping of the Gaza blockade-busting ship, Marmara, i= 2010. The Marmara incident led to the death of nine Turkish 
citizen= and generated a significant rift between Israel and Turkey, two otherwise=long-time political and economic 
partners. 
Iraq: Above all else, the recent=situation in Iraq has recently been marked by a wide and deepening sectari=n conflict. As 
Iraqis went to the polls for provincial elections on April =0th, the first elections since US troops withdrew, deadly 
secta=ian violence spread across the country. As of April 26th the UN=Mission in Iraq estimated the toll of the dead and 
wounded across the coun=ry to be in the hundreds and the UN envoy to Iraq called for both sides to=show "restraint." 
The clashes are among the fiercest since the=US pullout from the country in 2011. 
Bahrain: Ten weeks and fifteen rounds=of talks later, the Bahraini National Dialogue continues. According =o press 
reports, the dialogue faces some procedural issues regarding the a=enda, structure, and outcome of the talks. Some 
believe that the issues sh=uld be put forth in a referendum while others affirm that the king should =e allowed to 
exercise his executive rights and decide on the ultimate proc=ss himself. There has been much speculation that Prince 
Salman will enter =he dialogue, though he says that he will only "step in" at the=necessary time. Bahrain's human rights 
record has received internati=nal attention: a top-level European parliamentary delegation visited Manam= on April 
29th to discuss human rights, among other issue=, and the Bahraini government criticized as 'biased' the annua= US 
State Department report on the rights situation in the kingdom. =o:p>
