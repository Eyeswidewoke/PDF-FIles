VNS will continue to provide you with updated case scheduling and event information. 
The sentencing hearing for defendant(s), Jonathan Colon, has been set for November 30, 2021, 11:30 
AM at Courtroom 18C, 500 Pearl Street, New York, NY 10007 before Judge Mary Vyskocil. You are 
welcome to attend this proceeding; however, unless you have received a subpoena, your attendance 
is not required by the Court. If you plan on attending, you may want to verify the date and time by 
using the VNS Call Center or website. If you are a victim of the charged offense(s) and wish to speak 
at sentencing, please call our office well in advance of the scheduled hearing date. 
A United States Probation Officer prepares a report for the Court and may contact you to discuss the 
impact the crime had on you financially, physically, and/or emotionally. If you are contacted, please 
make every effort to provide accurate and detailed information. 
Because of the Court's schedule, hearing dates could change on very short notice. If you plan on 
attending, you may want to call the VNS Call Center or check the website to confirm the date and time. 
Please note, there is a 24-hour delay in information transfer to the website. 
Through the Victim Notification System (VNS) we will continue to provide you with updated scheduling 
and event information as the case proceeds through the criminal justice system. You may obtain 
current information about this case on the VNS website at https://www.notify.usdoj.gov or from the 
VNS Call Center at 1-866-DOJ-4YOU (1-866-365-4968) (TDD/TTY: 1-866-228-4619) (International: 1-
502-213-2767). In addition, you may use the Call Center or Internet to update your contact information 
and/or change your decision about participation in the notification program. 
You will use your Victim Identification Number (VIN) '3652' and Personal Identification Number (PIN) 
'9999' anytime you contact the Call Center and the first time you log into VNS on the website. If you 
are receiving notifications with multiple victim ID/PIN codes please contact the VNS Call Center. In 
addition, the first time you access the VNS website, you will be prompted to enter your last name (or
