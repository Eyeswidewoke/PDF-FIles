Starting Week 6 
Dear Jeffrey epstein, 
As usual, I extend a welcome to the new students joining the class. You ca= most definitely catch up. 
For those of you who are finishing up with Week 5, you know that this past =et of presentations stressed the rise of 
national industrial states betwee= 1830 and 1871, culminating in civil wars and the birth of new states arou=d the world, 
especially between about 1854 and 1871. India was more firml= unified under British state control with an imperial 
Indian Civil Service=to run it. The cling Empire, having barely survived a huge civil war, fran=ically engaged in "self-
strengthening." Japan had its own violent upheava= followed by an intense period of political and social change. The 
wars o= unification in Europe created powerful new national states, as the civil =ar did in the re-United States. I could 
also have discussed other cases, =uch as the creation of a new, large dominion called Canada with substantia= self-rule 
over the old provinces of British North America (1867). 
Week 6 will discuss how several of these national industrial entities then =ought to become national industrial empires, 
ushering in a new and acceler=ted age of global imperialism. This phase really took off during the 1880= and had 
reached its peak by the end of the century. A subtext for this w=ek could be "varieties of imperialism." Many motives, 
approaches, circums=ances, and outcomes. Some laudable, some horrific. 
One unusual feature of my approach is the time I spend on one particular ca=e: China, especially between 1898 and the 
end of 1900. The case is obvio=sly important in its own right. We will try out on you now-seasonsed stud=nts an 
additional level of complexity. This case offers a concrete illust=ation of the mixture of motives, the available options 
perceived on all si=es, and brings out some choices that I think have not received enough atte=tion in the general 
literature on this period. A Chinese nationalist shou=d look back on this as a period in which China was lucky to have 
survived =t all as a relatively intact political entity. 
The scramble for empire around the world became part of a "great accelerati=n" felt by many observers around the 
world during the 1890s and beyond. T=is "great acceleration" had deep roots in how societies that experienced t=e 'first' 
industrial revolution responded to that new situation and engend=red another, even more powerful, 'second' industrial 
revolution with many =olitical and cultural associations. But, first, the age of imperialism =E2 . 
Best wishes, 
Philip Zelikow
