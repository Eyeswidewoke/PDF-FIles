Karen and Hasan spent some of January with his sister Nayyar and her family in Karachi. It was fun to see 
everyone there, although the situation continues to deteriorate in the country and the city, with no end in sight. 
There was only occasional gunfire at night, and only one shooting that closed the bazaars. Momentous changes 
elsewhere in the Middle East, which we follow with intense interest. 
Hasan is back teaching and writing as usual — his book on the Pakistani architect Habib Fida Ali came out this 
spring. He travelled to Egypt in March to judge an ongoing urban design competition —just after the Arab Spring —
and was asked while there to speak at a hastily arranged public forum to look at options for Tahrir Square. He 
went back there for the month of July, leading a group of university and high school teachers on a Fulbright-Hays 
grant aimed at improving teaching about Middle-Eastern cultures. A tiring but enriching experience. Besides that 
he was in Istanbul (one of his favorite places), New York City, North Carolina and Florida. But perhaps his big news 
is that he became an American citizen after having had a 'green card' for 34 years! It must be some sort of a 
record for procrastination. 
Karen continues her landscaping work, which includes a medium-long list of pro bono stuff along with a short list 
of paid work. She took a week in Idaho in July, with Zehra, to visit her mother, and J. & Chase, Beverli, Shirley, 
Kristin & Bob, Lisa & Iver, Torrey & Hunter & Lane, and Kelli. She surprised everyone by 'letting her hair go' white 
and cutting it short! Her vegetable garden had its best year ever and supplied produce into November. 
Since the summer we had a slew of guests and caught up with old friends. Ayesha Heble visited us, as did Rudi 
and Azra Lemp, Ron and Tonda Gillespie, Nick and Sybille Bulloch, and Mona Ahmed from Egypt. In November, 
four other friends from the UK, Vimal and Gill Khosla and Niki Gardner and Richard Jennings, visited us to go 'leaf 
peeping' up in Vermont, where we all crashed at the most hospitable Doug Archard and Jean Kennedy's. The 
colors were somewhat subdued due to a late, warm autumn (read: still hopelessly green) but we enjoyed sight-
seeing together. 
The weather in Massachusetts has been somewhat dramatic this year with an earthquake, a tornado, Hurricane 
Irene, and the "Snowtober Surprise" which wrought havoc in the Northeast — wet snow fell on fully-leafed trees, 
then gravity did its work. We were lucky we lost power for just 12 hours. But unluckily, we lost a number of up-
and-coming trees in the garden much to Karen's chagrin, although she is gleefully planning their replacements. 
As the year ended Hasan underwent cataract surgery, replacing lenses in both eyes. His sight correction is now 
reversed, so he sees at a distance very well but must use cheaters for reading. We had Thanksgiving dinner at 
home, joined by friends and Omer (Hasan's nephew) who is studying piano technology for a year in Chicago. All 
four of us, joined by Gary and Suzi Graham, are looking forward to being with Vimal and Gill in Scotland over the 
winter break. 
May you all have a good 2012 and please join us in hoping that the world calms down a titch or two. 
With warm thoughts and best wishes, 
I a Sari and Karen
