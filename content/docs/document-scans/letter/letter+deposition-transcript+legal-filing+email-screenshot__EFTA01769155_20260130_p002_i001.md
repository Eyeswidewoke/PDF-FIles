in Khartoum in mid-June and q=ickly spread to surrounding parts of the city joined by other groups inclu=ing lawyers, 
human rights defenders, and opposition members. The demonstra=ions have continued for three weeks, despite clashes 
with the riot police.=While comparing this situation to the Arab Spring may be premature, in the=last fifty years, popular 
revolutions have overthrown the Sudanese governm=nt, first in 1964 and again in 1985. Calls have multiplied for 
internal re=orms, which would aim both at reversing some of the austerity measures tha= angered the population, and 
initiate collaboration with the political opp=sition. The ability of the ruling National Congress Party to heed these ca=ls 
will determine whether Khartoum is willing to appease internal tensions= while also continuing to negotiate complex 
post-referendum issues with So=th Sudan.

Mexico: Enrique Pena Nieto, t=e candidate of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), was elected pr=sident on July 1, 
bringing back the PRI—which ran Mexico as a one-pa=ty state for seventy years—after twelve years of the National 
Action=Party's (PAN) hold on the presidency. While a partial vote recoun= confirmed Pena Nieto's win, protests by 
students claiming fraud t=rough vote-buying continue in Mexico City. The electoral tribunal has unti= September to 
investigate allegations of overspending and voter fraud. The=second place candidate, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador of 
the far left, h=s threatened to file a legal challenge. Pena Nieto campaigned on a platf=rm to refocus the war on drugs 
and to combat the drug-fuelled violence res=onsible for the deaths of more than 50,000 Mexicans. Pena Nieto also 
pro=ised to implement economic reforms, such as opening the state-owned oil co=pany Pemex to private investment, 
which would help reinvigorate Latin Amer=ca's second largest economy. The PRI has a minority in both houses o= 
Congress, which could impede progress on its reform agenda. <1=> 
Paraguay: On =une 22, President Fernando Lugo was impeached just one week after land cla=hes between police and 
squatters left seventeen dead. Vice President Feder=co Franco was immediately sworn in as president to serve the 
remainder of =ugo's term ending August 2013. Labeling the abrupt impeachment a par=iamentary coup, both Mercosur 
(the regional economic alliance) and UNASUR =the regional organization integrating South =merican countries on issues 
including democracy, education, energy, and th= environment) have suspended Paraguay's membership until the =ext 
presidential election. Mercosur's decision to not impose sanctio=s against Paraguay averted potentially disastrous 
consequences for the lan=locked nation's economy, which is heavily reliant on trade within th= bloc. Jose Miguel Insulza, 
Secretary-General of the Organization of Ameri=an States (OAS), having completed a fact-finding mission to Paraguay, 
reco=mended against suspending Paraguay from the OAS and instead advised a grea=er commitment to avoid further 
isolating Paraguay and creating more proble=s. 
<=>Colombia: On June 14, Congress overwhelmingly ratified a const=tutional amendment that provides a Legal 
Framework for Peace talks between=the government and the left-wing guerrilla groups the Revolutionary Armed =orces 
of Colombia (FARC) and the National Liberation Army (ELN). The Frame=ork calls for soft sentences for rebels if they 
confess to their crimes, c=mpensate victims, and lay down their arms. Rebel leaders have given mixed =ignals that they 
are interested in talks. This controversial policy has be=n criticized by human rights groups and right-wing politicians for 
being t=o lenient and allowing crimes against humanity to go unpunished. In order =o become law, the bill must pass a 
final vote in a congressional commissio= and be signed by President Juan Manuel Santos. Passing this law would mar= a
