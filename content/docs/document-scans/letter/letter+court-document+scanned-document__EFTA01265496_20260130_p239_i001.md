Dear Jeffrey: 
Thank you for your contribution of $1,500 received 2/19/98 for Interlochen's Restricted 
Fund. Our goal is to produce quality and excellence in arts education. However, long-term 
success depends on those of you who provide financial assistance for us to carry out this 
mission. The seed of "a little camp in the woods," planted by Dr. Joseph E. Maddy in 1927 
has grown throughout the years. Historical decades in a time capsule of the Camp's growth 
follows: 
The 20's--The National High School Orchestra Association Camp is established and considered a success 
and an artistic haven for young musicians. 
The 30's--CBS and NBC networks broadcast concerts to thousands of listeners spreading the word of 
Joseph Maddy's treasure in the woods. 
The 40's—Growth increases as a Dance Department is added, Fine Ans Building is dedicated, Kresge is 
completed, and Junior and huennediate Divisions are established. The Camp became affiliated with the 
University of Michigan, By-laws were revised, and The National High School Orchestra Association 
officially became the National Music Camp 
The 50's—Construction included a new radio budding, the Joseph E. Maddy Administration Building, 
Lochaven and Pinecrest (dining areas), all-in-all 104 buildings to-date. The Chamber Music Festival became 
part of the post-Camp offerings. 
The 60's—Like a flower blooming, the physical campus continued its steady growth with the addition of 
scholarship lodges and WIAA Public Radio. The Academy was established and classrooms were built to 
provide a proper educational environment. 
The 70's—Construction virtually came to a halt. Growth came through performances, as 139 concerts, 
programs and exhibitions were presented off-campus in 73 Michigan cities through the first -Interlochen 
Outreach" program. The National Music Camp celebrated its 50th season in 1977. 
The 80's--Presentations continued to grow in number and stature. Both on- and off-campus, international 
guest artists and ensembles performed. Academic excellence continued as the Academy celebrated its 25th 
year and the Camp, its 60th. 
The 90's—Repair and renovation of existing buildings and construction of a Music Building Complex is 
underway. Began in 1995, The Campaign for Inter:ocher' included four elements: construction, renovation, 
scholarships and endowment, a plan designed to ensure the future of young artists attending Interlochen. 
From the beginning a can-do spirit prevailed, allowing Interlochen Center for the Arts to 
grow into one of America's true cultural treasures. One that touches the lives of thousands of 
young people who assume worldwide leadership positions in the arts, education, business, and 
industry. Thank you for helping to make the impossible, possible! As a contributor, your gift 
will be counted toward the $45 million Campaign for Interloc
