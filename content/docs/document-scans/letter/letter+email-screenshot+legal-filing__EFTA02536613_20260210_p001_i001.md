Dear Jeffrey, 
I hope this one will be an inspiring, healthy and in every way worth =ile year to you! 
I don't know what your mind is up too these days and I always interested =o hear about it. I just thought a bit about 
time, this weird thing...= Subjective time can be abstracted into the mentally represented events, =hich are partially 
ordered by relations that encode (in degrees of =ncreasing distinction) non-simultaneity, succession, interval and 
=emporal distribution, and anchored to temporal events by co-occurence =elations. Subjective time spans that are not 
anchored to neural clock =enerators tend to reflect the density of novel elements we experienced, =ecause these are 
disproportionally stored in the temporal protocol of =ur attention that we remember as our stream of consciousness. It 
seems =hat due to a decreasing frequency of novelty in the course of our life, =he subjective middle of the life of an 90 
year old would be around 18, =erhaps echoing the ubiquitous law of Pareto. 
Our physical time is relativistic, of course: the rate of change an =bserver witnesses in its environment, which is relative 
to the rate of =hange in the observer itself. Particles that don't undergo state change =on't witness relativistic time, and 
from my computationalist =erspective, that corresponds to all underlying computation being =pplied to their 
momentum, i.e. the rate at which they are copied along =he computational graph of the universe. The higher the rate of 
state =hanges in a particle, the slower the rate at which it propagates =elative to its environment. 
Time is crucial, because it captures change, and without change, =nformation has no meaning. Nothing has a discernible 
property unless =his property can be compared to something: information is discernible =ifference, and all discernment 
requires a computable function that =equires a change of state. The meaning of information is its relationship to 
changes in other information. 
Computationalist time may be just this: elementary state change of a =omputational substrate. From the perspective of 
an embedded observer, =e won't be able to discern the nature of that change itself, because =rom the perspective of 
the emergent patterns that form the causal =tructures of our own dynamics, they are functionally the same. Yet its 
=ascinating to speculate about the ground truth of change. 
In eternalist time, all time points are simultaneously instantiated (yet =s embedded observers only see one of them, or 
rather, we are =onstituted in the relation between adjacent states). 
If a universe has multiple possible timelines, these might be =nstantiated in parallel; let's call it "fat time". Embedded 
observers =on't know about the other parts of the instantiated space of =ossibilities, but only about the parts looping 
back to its trajectory =n the computational graph. 
Dual state time may be an implementation of a universe where only input =tate and output state if the universe 
transition function exist. 
There might also be a just a global single state time, where the =niverse transition function alters the present state in-
place all at =nce, and only a single time slice of the universe does actually exist. 
And of course, there could be also a local single state time, a giant =ubstrate graph, in which a single read/write head 
only ever changes one =it at a time.
