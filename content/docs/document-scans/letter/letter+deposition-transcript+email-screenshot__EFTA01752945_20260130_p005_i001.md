single step will have no meaningful impact on Iran's capacity to produ=e a nuclear weapon within weeks or months. 
There will be no "rollback,=94 merely a "slow down;" but that slow down is fine with Iran, because it already has 
EVERYTHING IT NEEDS FOR A NUCLEAR WEAP=N, or even several. 
How about the "step by step" process that is the new word for "sequen=ing?" The administration isn't being clear with 
Iran about what its bottom line is, because Obama has no bottom line. What was once a demand to a=d the entire 
nuclear weapons program has become a demand to make it smaller and hide it better. The Iranians are pl=ying out the 
string, and won't agree to anything more substantial down t=e road, because they're getting what they need up front. 
They are well a=are that if they hold out long enough (and that's not too long), Obama will offer them a better deal: 
more con=essions in return for less. 
Finally, there's the question of Iran's secret nuclear facilities. That=92s right, pretty much every western state believes 
Iran has moved many of=its weapons activities somewhere. I have no clue where, but believe the Ob=ma team has some 
suspicions. Imagine this: The president reports to Congress he has achieved a "rollback" o= the Iranian nuclear program, 
and in turn granted Tehran valuable concessi=ns. But all the while he knew that Iran was progressing actively, 
elsewher=. He concealed that information from the Congress, our allies and the American people. Incredible? Not 
re=lly. 
As the vice pres=dent for foreign and defense policy studies at AEI, Pletka writes on natio=al security matters with a 
focus on Iran and weapons proliferation, the Mi=dle East, Syria, Israel and the Arab Spring. Her most recent study, 
"Iranian influence in the Levant, Egypt, =raq, and Afghanistan," was published in May 2012.

How Netanyahu=could kill a nuclear deal with Iran 
Max Fisher</=> 
November 8 -- This =as been a bad week for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. His rela=ionship with the United 
States is frosting over, and the world is inching =loser to an Iranian nuclear agreement that he sees as foolhardy and 
dangerous. But while he may be increasingly =solated on the world stage, the Israeli leader still has substantial lever=ge 
in Washington, which he may be able to use to undermine U.S.-Iran talks=or possibly kill them outright. 
The trouble for Net=nyahu started Wednesday, when Secretary of State John Kerry took some shot= at the expansion of 
Israeli settlements in the West Bank -- long criticiz=d by the United States as a threat to peace talks between Israel and 
the Palestinians. 
"We consider n=w and have always considered the settlements to be illegitimate," . European leaders are bullish on 
finding a deal with Iran and are also i=creasingly wary of the Netanyahu government's role in the Israeli-Palestin=an 
peace talks, seeing it as intransigent and counterproductive. They might be willing to tolerate their disagreemen=s with 
Netanyahu on one of those issues, but on both? <http://www.state.gov/secretary/remarks/2013/11/217272.htm=
