biopsy done for the pgp. Induced pluripotent stem cells (adult stem cells) can be 
made from these. They can also be induced to differentiate into various cell types 
including neurons (which would otherwise, of course, be difficult to obtain and 
study in a specific individual). Pm getting itemized costs but getting to iPS cells 
costs around S 1 0k and the process takes about 6 months (because of the multiple 
cell passages needed in the protocol). (Success of course isn't guaranteed either.) 
All this work should fall within or just a bit over the $30k or so Jeffrey mentioned 
over the phone. Payment can be made by your group directly to the various 
vendors once you have that info. As I discussed with Jeffrey on the phone, I won't 
personally accept money and any effort I contribute to this will be pro bono. And, 
this goes without saying, but with respect to the vendors, these are just 
suggestions so Jeffrey should feel free to use other vendors if he has other 
preferences. 
I'm happy to go through his genome pro bono using the analyses tools his genomic 
data from illumina will get loaded onto once it's available. I'm also happy to 
reassess as well in a year to try and incorporate any new data that may be available 
relevant to his genome. At that time, there may also be additional data to generate 
and analyze from studying his iPS or other cell lines. On that front, it may also be 
interesting to do a genome on his fibroblast cells (which we currently have unlike 
the iPS cells). I wouldn't expect to get additional medical info from that but it 
helps give a handle on mutations that are present in the fibros and not him - and 
later in the iPS cells but not native cells. (And, therefore, give you a handle on bow 
accurately these cells will reflect normal physiology when further studied.) At 
some point we can compare his white blood cell genome to fibroblast cells to iPS 
cells and other derived cells. 
Some of this hassle, such as needing multiple vendors for sequencing and analyses, 
just comes with the territory of being an early adopter. This will get cheaper and 
the process should be more straightforward over time. And while no one can 
guarantee benefit from genome sequencing, especially in someone relatively 
healthy, there is the possibility of reaping benefit as an early adopter before others 
if something medically actionable is discovered in his data. (We'll also concentrate 
our analyses on those 56 genes the ACMG recommended checking even in healthy 
individuals). 
More to follow and apologies for the delay on the invoice. You can see I've been 
looking into it though and there are still a few moving pieces. rm sorry about the 
news on funding patient sequences. Jeffrey sounded excited about that possibility. 
His genomic data should be interesting though and even if it's of limited use now, 
he'll be able to go back and reanalyze the data in the future as more is collectively 
learned in this field. 
Best,
