Almost 200 nations are working on a U.N. pact, due to=be agreed in Paris in late 2015, to rein in rising greenhouse gas 
emissions. Progress to combat global warming has been slow despite two decades of work= "How the world's largest 
and fastest-growing cities develop will be critical=to the future path of the global economy and climate," the report said, 
recommending a shift to "compact cities" that used less energ= and invested in public transport. Cities are home to half 
of the planet's 7.2 billion people, generate 80 percen= of global economic growth and account for about 70 percent of 
energy-related greenhouse gas emissions, it said. But many urban areas are sprawling out o= control. 
TIME SHORT 
The report said =he next 15 years were vital because, in that time, "the global economy will grow by more than half, a 
billion =ore people will come to live in cities" and new technology will change businesses and lives. A U.N. panel of 
experts says swift action is needed to avert more heatwaves, floods, drough=s and rising seas. It says it is at least 95 
percent probable that human activities, rather than natural swings in the climate, are the main cause o= warming. 
Overall, the Commission said that $90 trillion in investments were needed in the next 15 years to keep a high-carbon 
model of infrastructure for cities, transport, energy and water systems, or an avera=e $6 trillion a year. A shift to low-
carbon energy, such as wind or solar power, and greener cities would co=t a further $270 billion a year - a 4.5 percent 
increase in the bill that could=be offset by other savings, for instance on fuel. "Investing in a low-carbon economy is a 
cost-effective form of insurance against climate risk," it said. 
Among drawbacks with the existing economy, the report=said air pollution cost 4.4 percent of world gross domestic 
product, with a high=of more than 10 percent of GDP in China. Jeremy Oppenheim, director of the report, said China 
and other emerging nations ha= grown aware of the risks of coal-based growth and fast-expanding cities. "Things are 
very different even compared with five years ago," he told Reuters. In rich nations, inefficiencies still abounded in cities 
such as New York, London or Paris. "Twenty percent of fuel costs in cities are spent looking for parking spots," he said. 
Unlike past climate change studies which have focused on the risks of inaction, the rep=rt seeks to show economic 
benefits of investments which could also help the environment, he said. 
The report urged governments to phase out fossil fuel subsidies totaling more than $600 billion a year, far more than 
$100 billio= in annual support given to renewable energy. And it urged better use of farmland. "Restoring just 12 
percent of the world's degraded agricultural la=d could feed 200 million people by 2030, while also strengthening 
climate resilienc= and reducing emissions," it said. In April, a report drawing on the work of 1,000 experts said that a 
shift to low-carbon energy would trim about 0.06 percent a year off world economic growth. It did not compare costs 
and benefits as starkly as Tuesday's report.
