There is further background which = discovered when I began looking into these matters instead of just 
taking=everything on trust and paying little attention. It was my mistake, =ow rectified. 
The background I discovered is sketche= below •• in part, there is actually more, which is disturbing, but l'=I put it aside. 
First, although I was teachin= at MIT for 60 years, I have almost no pension; less than Social Security..C2* The reason is 
that when MIT restructured the pension system, M and l=took an option that provided us with an IRA, which we placed 
in a trust. 
My only regular source of income, therefore, is an IRA= apart from a trickle of royalties from current books. The 
laws=require that about $300,000 be withdrawn every year. That sounds like a lo=, until you look at what was 
happening. First, until last year, when.' learned about it, Bainco was paying out about half of the withdra=al in 
distributions to the family. About a third goes to taxes..C240 The rest went to payments on the Wellfleet house. That 
exhausts the =bligatory withdrawal. 
=div class="gmail_quote"> 
In addition, I was paying the man=gement fees for the entire estate. And there were of course addition.' substantial 
expenses, like Alex's medical bills and payment to Antho=y for the work that he is doing. All of that carries the total well 
=ver the required withdrawal. Worse, anything beyond the required wit=drawal is taxed at an exorbitant rate, which is 
why I suggested that taxes=come instead from the marital trust; no need to go over the fate of that i=ea. The arithmetic 
is simple. It's now far over the limit../div> 
All of this is before I take one penny for living expens=s. Again, the arithmetic is straightforward. In the manner tha= 
things were being handled, in two or three years the IRA would be exhaust=d, and we'd be down pretty much to a very 
small pension and Social Sec=rity -- which do not go to Valeria after my death. Furthermore, it=C240goes without saying 
that I want to guarantee that after my death Vale=ia will have our home, unencumbered. That would clearly be 
impossibl= the way things were being handled. In fact, she would have nothing =t all. 
I shouldn't have to explain that providing fo= Valeria after my death is a serious concern for me. We are very hap=y 
together. Our being together added immeasurably to my life. = took for granted that friends and family would be very 
pleased about that= and those we see regularly are, very much so. 
I'm glad that all of you will be free from any financial concerns, th=nks to substantial investments from my salary and 
other income over the ye=rs, now in trusts of which you the beneficiaries. But that doesn'=t happen to be the case for 
me. I didn't really think about it i= the past, but I never expected to have to spend my later years concerned =bout how 
to make ends meet. 
cdiv> 
aiv class="gmail_quote"> 
As for the trusts, M and I of course ar=anged that after our deaths, they would all go to you. But we both n=turally took 
for granted that while we were alive, we would have direct ac=ess to them, to use at our discretion. We also took=for 
granted that I would die first, so when the trusts were established, I=suppose about 20 years ago, they were in her 
name. But the intention=was of course obvious. 
That's how things stand.Q=A0 I think it's important for you to be aware of them.
