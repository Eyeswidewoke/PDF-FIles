Follow up to our call 
Thanks so much for talking with me about the current state of politics at ho=e and in DC. 
Locally, I'm very concerned with our financial state and the unwillingness o= our elected officials to seek real counsel 
and take the mature "grown up" s=eps necessary to put us on the right path to some economic viability. While=Puerto 
Rico has a debt problem, the Virgin Islands aside from the debt has a= even greater problem of economic stagnation (no 
plans for the new paradigm=of financial growth). The individual in the position of governor and the co=position of 
senators which make up the majority are critical to recovery. A=governor with an obstructionist senate majority get no 
plans done (Delonghs=last term) or a governor with a rubber stamps senate can take the territory=barreling over a cliff 
(Mapps first term►. 
I have spoken at length with McGee and 2 older advisors to DeJongh who playe= critical roles in his first and second win 
about the need to create a new v=ter file. Delongh's file was never updated after the first win and is now s=ale. This 
would be an almost one year project of developing the list of Vir=in Islanders who have voted in several prior elections 
(segregating primary=and general), current phone, email and physical addresses. This is the most=important group to 
poll for messaging and later phone banking for support a=d get to the polls. (Others poll by phone book or on the street. 
Not accura=e). 
I, along with the 2-3 individuals who assist in financing this project, will=then use the information to make rational data 
driven decisions about local=election (who for what positions, along with messaging and campaign work). M=Gee will 
also advice the candidates chosen from the group. 
I'd like to launch by the next month and would appreciate your partnership t= make this happen. This project would 
allow us to completely outperform any=ne in any race. 
On the DC front, I will be meeting Schumer the week of May 16. That same we=k I'm having a strategy dinner with 3 DC 
operatives with 70+ yrs combined e=perience representing convergent sectors of Dems (1 Blue Dog/Tues Rep lobby=st, 
an old Tip ONeilI,Gephardt Rostenkowski guy and a progressive Clinton w=man) to discuss path forward. 
Also in my discussion with McGee we discussed the impression you had that th= USVI was in the PROMESA bill. We are 
absolutely not in the bill. I was abl= to negotiate with Treasury, gain the support of a block of Dems who held v=te until 
the USVI and smaller territories were satisfied with the bill, and=got a Moderate Rep to offer the amendment to remove 
the small territories f=om the bill. The original VI strategy was to have us removed and immediatel= the Gov and his 
team would quietly inform Jeffries and others of our staun=h conservatism and unwillingness to request the same 
provisions. Because th= Gov and his team "didn't believe Plaskett could get it done" (the lobbyist=direct quote to me) 
they never activated their portion of the plan and so t=e street never knew we were excluded. 
Jeffrey, would really appreciate your support in the project and thoughts on=our home and national scene. 
Look forward to hearing back.
