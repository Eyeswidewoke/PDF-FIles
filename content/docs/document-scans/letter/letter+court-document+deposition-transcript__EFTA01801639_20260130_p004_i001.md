the most significant political a=d regulatory outcome from these events will be to renew the debate about u=iversal 
banking. Where this debate has to this point focused on scale, imp=icit subsidy and systemic risk, it will now focus on 
culture, personal character and contamination from the values of the trading floor to the rest of a=banking institution. 
Because these things cannot be regulated, the probability is that politicians will=focus on their political proxies, 
especially pay. 
The return of Vic=ers 
The link between what has happened at Barclays and the un=versal banking argument is trust. 
Preserving the universal bank model reli=s on public trust that the core retail functions of a bank and its 
trading=activities can be properly and completely segregated. The UK Independent Commission on Banking chaired by 
Sir John V=ckers proposed in 2011 that they could be preserved in a single institutio= but in separate entities, with the 
retail functions ringfenced with their=own higher capital levels. The Vickers Commission recommended that all 
derivatives services should be kep= outside this ringfence. 
The UK government accepted the argument that retail banks=should be able to maintain some simple 
derivatives functions such as produ=ts for hedging currency risk for business clients. The Barclays experience=is already 
leading politicians and commentators in the UK to argue that simple derivatives may be an oxymoron= Trying to define 
them may be a futile exercise, and one that will inevita=ly be gamed by banks. 
The UK government shows some reluctance to revisit its in=erpretation of the Vickers proposals. But if 
the British Parliamentary enq=iry into the LIBOR issue now concludes that the government has erred on th= side of 
trusting banks, then the pressure for an outcome closer to the original Vickers recommendation, to =e written into next 
year's Banking Act, will be intense. 
The universal banking debate will take another serious tw=st if the new leadership of Barclays ultimately 
decides to break the bank =p into a retail bank and an investment bank and broker/dealer. As extreme =s this sounds, 
the intangible costs in political and regulatory animus Barclays now attracts could suggest tha= a clean break makes 
sense. An arrangement that gave existing shareholders=a stake in both new institutions might be acceptable. 
Barclays would no doubt sell such a split as a smart comm=rcial move. But the political and regulatory 
subtext would be to undermine=the case that such banking agglomerations are both necessary and useful. A=though the 
French and German commitment to their own universal banking systems is very strong, such a split would =ertainly 
empower critics of the universal banking model in the EU and the =S. The Liikanen Group inquiry is due to report to the 
European Commission =n bank structure later this year. The Commission itself is then expected to issue its own 
recommendations on=bank structure. Both will certainly draw on the Barclays experience. 
The culture quest=on 
This bigger issue about the values of the trading floor i= going to prove hard to shake off. The role of 
securities divisions in dri=ing investment bank profits over the last two decades has predictably seen=a generation of 
securities managers rise to the leadership of investment and universal banks. While it is perh=ps unwise to generalise 
too much, most of these men have brought with them=the directness and self-belief that comes with surviving a career 
on the t=ading floor. 
They also bring with them a view of the market and of mar=et-making that is often at odds with the way 
most politicians understand t=em. Watching Lloyd Blankfein of Goldman Sachs trying to explain to the US =enate in 2010 
why it was legitimate for Goldman Sachs as a market maker to be both long and short in the US pr=perty market at the
