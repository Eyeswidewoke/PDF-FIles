'Our job was about =iscretion. We have a clear conscience that we didn't witness =nything untoward. Whatever went on 
at the other houses — and yes, =e heard things from other members of staff — it didn't, to =y knowledge, happen at our 
property.' =/span> 
Miles also says that on several =ccasions he refused Epstein's requests to smuggle female guests =n by boat, to 
circumvent the strict immigration policies of St Thomas, =he island with authority over Little St James, which would have 
meant =ogging names and passport numbers. 
But he was aware that =pstein found others to do his bidding. For as the couple were told when =hey were hired: 'What 
Jeffrey wants, Jeffrey gets.' ./span> 
The words came from Ghislaine =axwell, who was then Epstein's girlfriend. She flew to South =frica with Andrew 
Shannon, a lawyer, to interview the Alexanders in =998, after they had replied to a small ad for 'management couple 
=ought to run private island'. 
After apparently =assing the interview, they were invited to meet Epstein in New York. =/span> 
'It was very =trange,' said Miles. 'We were taken by a driver to an =ffice near Madison Square Garden. A gentleman 
wearing a polo shirt and =eans stepped out of the lift, asked if we had a good trip, shook our =ands and left. That was it. 
Then Miss Maxwell came back and said we had =he job.' 
Ghislaine then took them to =g8216;the big house' in Manhattan, which is said to have been the =cene of sex parties 
and where young girls were allegedly hired as =laythings for Epstein's wealthy male friends. =/span> 
'We spent five days there =hadowing the staff to see how they did things,' says Cathy. =/span> 
'A dinner party was held on =he fourth night, but it was very formal and businesslike. I saw no =iris — young or otherwise 
— at the time. We would never =ave willingly put ourselves in that kind of situation.' =/span> 
The following day they were flown =o St Thomas and transferred by boat to Epstein's island house, a =prawling single-
storey complex with white walls and a blue roof, =aintained by several gardeners, two boat captains, two laundry ladies 
=nd two other women who cared for the house. =/span> 
Again the couple were there to =bserve, but after three days they were woken in the night by a phone =all telling them 
they had to leave the island because a VIP was making =n unexpected visit. They were later told by staff that the guest 
had =een Prince Andrew. 
More... 
• 
Prince Andrew used 'shady' ex Tory =reasurer to pay Fergie debt in secret deal =/a> 
• 
Paedophile Jeffrey Epstein's weekend at the =ueen's most cherished hideaway =/a> 
They went back to New York, where =hislaine explained more of their duties. 
'She said we had =o keep quiet about what we saw or heard on the island,' Cathy =ecalls. 
'She told us that although =r Epstein and she were a couple, we would see lots of beautiful girls =assing in and out, but 
that was his nature. =/span>
