the trustee of the trusts needs to know before making decisions ab=ut distributions. Likewise, if my successor will be 
identified soon =t might make sense for me to hold off on any distributions and leave it to the new trustee to work with 
you on figuring all of this o=t. In this regard I'm kind of a "lame duck" =rustee, wouldn't you say? 
4. =C2 To the extent that you want to push forward wh=Ie I remain the trustee, let me again state the basis for 
financial disclo=ure by you. It is that, as trustee, I owe a duty to you and I owe a duty to your children (as the =emainder 
beneficiaries of the trusts). For the present my primary du=y is to you and it is to distribute to you all income earned by 
the trusts= net of expenses, 
=/span> 
Until I asked about the ma=ter recently, I am aware of no income distributed to me earned from the tr=sts. I cannot be 
sure, because I also do not recall having received =ny accounting of what is happening to the trusts, including 
distributions =rom them to others (or as required, to me). Could you then please se=d me the records on these matters. 
</=iv> 
and to distribute to you (or pay on your behalf) additional monies as reasonably needed t= the extent that your income 
from other sources is not sufficient to suppo=t your reasonable expenses. 
c=pan style="font-size:11ptfont-family:Calibri,sans-seritcolorrgb(31,73=125)"> 
Notwithstanding=your statement that "As for the claim about concern for my later year=, that has been thoroughly 
refuted" it has not been refuted in the context of my trusteeship and it remains my=duty to consider distributions in 
light of the possibility that you will h=ve a reasonable need for distributions from the trust for many more years,=and 
perhaps in increasing amounts, depending on your circumstances in the future. 
I am=approaching 90. I'm not going to live forever. You know ho= much money is in the trust. How could there possibly 
be a concern a=out it being depleted? You know my lifestyle very well. Perhap= you recall the meeting in my office 
when you explained to me that I was g=ing to have to cut back on expenses, specifically to sell my boat, as I di=. None of 
this makes any sense. 
</=iv> 
5. 
As for the specifics=of disclosure, what I need to consider is (a) what your income was in 2017= since that was the 
basis for the tax payments you seek to have reimbursed, (b) what your income is likely to be this year an= going forward, 
(c) what your expenses were in 2017 and are likely to be i= 2018, and (d) whether any of your income (or other 
resources) are being u=ed for purposes that the trust cannot support (such as gifts to third parties). =AOSo far, Rich has 
provided me with some rough information about your 2017=expenses. There are some gaps in that information, but 
nothing that =an't be cleared up pretty easily (I think). Rich has also as=ured me that you have not made any gifts that
