The trap is in the concept acelanguage.a Whatever is happening can be considered perfectly well without ever using the 
conceptual framework of acelanguage,a which by its nature makes it difficult to consider the transaction, the process. We are 
not concerned with the linear system of iceman and manaThis language,a but with experience on the neural level, the only 
direct experience. Words are not directly experienced. Man never experienced words. He experienced another man talking, 
radios, books, televisions, telephones, etc. The experience was never that of language. We move from the relationship of man-
man talking, man-radio, man-book, man-man thinking, to a study of the transacting process that can be considered in 
unambiguous, numerical terms when dealt with on the level of operant, neural activity. Yet this exercise uses words. aceWhen 
we talk about reality we never start at the beginning and we use concepts more accurately defined only by their applicationr 
ItaTms part of the process. The author is aware that for every system capable of producing a logical truth, there is a truism 
proving the system which cannot be shown to be true within the system. 
Reality is not words, not the construct of language. Reality is in the nonlinear fimction of neural activity. The only real 
phenomena are operant and nonlinear. Words can be considered only in terms of the illusory past. Man thought the choice 
was between ideas that were expressed through language. The choice for man really concerned information, how the usage of 
various language patterns would change the way the brain worked. Since man could never be aware of the activity of his 
brain, there was no choice. Silence. 
Real control had nothing to do with the kind of control exercised by national governments. Control is through the process of 
information. ManaTMs technologies, viewed as communication, as feedback extensions, relayed back signals telling the brain 
what to do. While governments exercised their traditional prerogatives, the process continued unnoticed. No democratic 
populace, no legislative body, ever indicated by choice, by vote, what kind of information was desired. Nobody ever voted for 
the telephone. Nobody ever voted for the automobile. Nobody ever voted for printing. Nobody ever voted for television. 
Nobody ever voted for space travel. Nobody ever voted for electricity. Nobody ever voted for nuclear power. 
There are only nonlinear phenomena. The communication of direct neural experience is an invention more important than the 
wheel, the steam engine, nuclear energy. The trip through the internal mappings of the nervous system is far more exciting, 
far more important, and far more dangerous than the journey to the moon, and the farthest reaches of outer space. 
It is a question of searching for questions. This exercise is not setting forth rules or formulating dogma. It is an attempt to 
create a working model, not with an eye to truth but to convenience. The only rules applicable are those that are convenient 
to use. In this system there is no interest in, there is no possibility of, truth. There is no longer a solid base, a substantial 
reality, from which to make pronouncements. We move toward an always inferred, unknowable reality with the symbols, the 
frames of reference, available to us. What we find is only a model. Man was such a model. Man, the model, is dead. 
It is no longer necessary to say yes to life, No one is there to listen; no one is interested in you, no one is interested in your 
words.
