"Back then we cou=d get maybe 300 or 400 people out on the street, and we had an aggressive =egime targeting us," 
the activist said. "But at least we knew that the=majority of the people, though afraid to join us, supported us. I'm here

The democrats being=singled out have been relentless opponents of military rule and the Mubara=-era civilian 
establishment. Nour's Ghad party briefly joined with anoth=r secular party in an electoral alliance with the Muslim

These activists broke with Morsi a year ago, a=ter he suspended the rule of law in order to force through a

those opposed to the Brotherhood should work to defeat the party in the parliame=tary elections that were to be held

Part of the persecu=ion of these democrats is payback by the generals and the state intelligen=e service, which blames

October 11 (Video T=anscript): 
George Friedman<=span>: My name's George Friedman. I'm=here with my colleague Robert Kaplan. And we want to talk 
about one of the=most ubiquitous things in the human condition: war. War is not a subject people like to think of as 
insoluble, they don't=like to think of it as natural. But the fact of the matter is there's very=few things -- family, 
economics -- as commonplace as war. We don't want to=talk so much about why there's war -- that is a long and endless 
discussion -- we want to talk about what=s happening to war. Where we're going today. Everybody's talking about 
rev=lutions in warfare, the end of peer-to-peer conflict, a whole range of thi=gs. So what we'd like to do today is talk 
about what's happening to war, and what the future of war looks li=e. Robert?
