Unfortunately, this is not a recent problem. Long delays, unexpected closures of the facility and lockdowns 
have all occurred frequently since Mr. Tartaglione was first arrested, over 3 years ago and have significantly 
hampered our ability to communicate with our client, who is facing the death penalty. 
Because the BOP has chosen to monitor emails and phone calls between Lawyers and their clients, we are 
forced to meet with Nick to discuss every aspect of the case, even relatively benign things that typically 
could be handled with a quick call or a short email. 
As you know, I have been writing about these problems, speaking to you and bringing the issues to the 
attention of Judge Karas over the course of the years of Nick's Pretrial detention. 
On a personal note, this was a particularly frustrating day because I again took time away from my family on 
a Sunday to drive into NYC with anticipation that would be able to leave at 9:30. Today's trip, as you know, 
was necessary because Ms. Leisenring and I arrived on Thursday at 7:55 but were not permitted to see our 
client until 9:30. 
These obstacles to meeting with our client are systemic and do not appear to be correctable without 
significant changes in how the BOP operates the faculty. The rooms for visiting have computers that are 
frequently broken, there are not enough rooms to accommodate the number of lawyers attempting to see 
their clients (several hours of delays are routine for any lawyer who doesn't arrive before 8:00), the staff 
frequently delays the opening of legal visiting but never extends the closing time, once in a room, a lawyer 
can expect to wait for their client to be produced from 10-15 minutes to hours and of course at times the 
facility simply closes and refuses visits all together. 
The USA's office has advised that the Marshal's have refused our request to transfer Mr. Tartaglione to 
Nassau County and despite my inquiry about other options, have not offered any alternative. 
The conditions under which Mr. Tartaglione Are being held continue to be problematic, to say the least. 
There is again water in his cell and the other issues, which I have written about a number of times but won't 
detail again here, persist. 
I don't think anyone understands what it is like to be locked in a windowless box all day, everyday with 
limited human contact and virtually no contact with family or friends. People can't survive like that for very 
long. Cell phone or not, the conditions in SHU are deplorable. Discussing the issues surrounding his 
complex death penalty case has become nearly impossible. Whether intentional or accidental, the MCC is 
breaking Mr. Tartaglione's ability to defend the charges and prepare for trial. 
I am open to any solution
