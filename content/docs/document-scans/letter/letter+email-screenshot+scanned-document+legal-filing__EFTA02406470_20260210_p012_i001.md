But Peres is irrepressible as always. He says the setbacks are blip= on a graph line that has mostly ascended since the 
'70s and '80s, whe= Israel and the PLO refused to even recognize each other. And he believes there's no real alternative 
to the two-state=solution if Israel wants to maintain its democratic character. Peres recen=ly co-wrote a book with 
Landau about his mentor, Ben-Gurion. It concludes =hat Ben-Gurion's greatest decision was accepting the United 
Nations partition plan, which gave Israel a state=but much less territory than it sought. The book is a historical 
accountin= from a man who worked under him for decades. But Landau says Peres also t=inks of it as a contemporary 
tract. "He's trying to deliver a message to people here and now that nothing =as changed since Ben-Gurion's decision," 
Landau said. "In order to m=intain a democratic country, Israel needs to forgo part of the territory.=94

Fearful of a =uclear Iran? The real WMD nightmare is Syria 
Charles P. Blair 
1 March 2012 -- As =ossible military action against Iran's suspected nuclear weapons program Iroms large in the public 
arena, far more international concern should be di=ected toward Syria and its weapons of mass destruction. When the 
Syrian uprising began more than a year ago, =ew predicted the regime of President Bashar al-Assad would ever teeter 
tow=rd collapse. Now, though, the demise of Damascus's current leadership appe=rs inevitable, and Syria's revolution 
will likely be an unpredictable, protracted, and grim affair. Some see sim=larities with Libya's civil war, during which 
persistent fears revolved ar=und terrorist seizure of Libyan chemical weapons, or the Qaddafi regime's =se of them 
against insurgents. Those fears turned out to be unfounded. 
But the Libyan chem=cal stockpile consisted of several tons of aging mustard gas leaking from = half-dozen canisters that 
would have been impossible to utilize as weapon=. Syria likely has one of the largest and most sophisticated chemical 
weapon programs in the world. Moreover, Sy=ia may also possess an offensive biological weapons capability that Libya 
=id not. 
While it is uncerta=n whether the Syrian regime would consider using WMD against its domestic =pponents, Syrian 
insurgents, unlike many of their Libyan counterparts, are=increasingly sectarian and radicalized; indeed, many observers 
fear the uprising is being "hijacked" by =ihadists. Terrorist groups active in the Syrian uprising have already 
demo=strated little compunction about the acquisition and use of WMD. In short,=should Syria devolve into full-blown 
civil-war, the security of its WMD should be of profound concern, as sectarian insurg=nts and Islamist terrorist groups 
may stand poised to seize chemical and p=rhaps even biological weapons.
