Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu waves as he steps to the lectern prior to speaking befor= a joint meeting of 
Congress on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, March 3, 2015. House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio, left, and Sen. 
Orrin Hatch (R-Uta=) applaud. 
Over the past almost 30 years I have traveled the world extensively, first, as a Uni=ed States Marine and then later as a 
private businessman. On numerous occasion=, especially while traveling through Europe, the Middle East and North 
Africa= I have had multiple heated arguments over the years with people regarding the actions and policies of the 
United States government. Whether it was Pres. =ill Clinton, George W Bush or Barack Obama, whether I supported the 
respective =olicy or not, I constantly defended the actions and policies of my government and pushed back against any 
foreigner criticizing the leader of my country. It =id not matter if the person was a private citizen on the street, a 
diplomat, a government official or a Head of State, there was no way I could ever allow=an "Outsider" to criticize or 
insult my government without getting b=th barrels from me. I've always believed that as Americans we don't ai= our 
dirty laundry in public. We can debate these issues amongst ourselves privately a=d respectfully. But we must show a 
united front to the world. Don't ask m= why I'm this way, I just am. What I witnessed today inside the US Congress =as 
anathema to all I believe. Shameful in fact. Allowing the leader of a forei=n country to openly criticize our president's 
foreign policy in front of =ur Congress is an open insult to all Americans and not just Pres. Obama. I pla=e this 
dishonorable act squarely on the shoulders of our congressional legislators many of whom I know to be honorable 
people. As Americans we sho=ld expect and demand better from our elected leaders. The eyes of the world ar= upon us 
and we should conduct ourselves accordingly.

Like ThomasQ=A0Col=man and many o=her Americans, I was appalled this week at the reception that Israeli Prime 
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu received by t=e Republicans when he spoke in front of a joint session of Congress on 
Tuesda=. As Chris Mathews bluntly said, "This was a takeover=attempt by Netanyahu with his complying American 
partners to take American foreign pol=cy out of the hands of the president." 
Chris Matthews, HARDBALL host: Well,=that's -- you know, I'll get to the heart of this speech now. This man from a 
foreign government waked into the United States legislative chamber and tried to take over U.S. fore=gn policy. He 
said, 'You should trust me, not your president on this. I am the man you should trust, I'm your tru= leader on this 
question of U.S. geopolitics. To protect yourself you must listen t= me and not this president.' 
Let's be honest here Netanyah= is not interested in peace. He is not interested in peace with Iran and he is not 
interested in peace with the Palestinians. Th=s is the same person who along with the necons pushed America into an 
unprovoked war in Iraq, claiming that Saddam Hussein was destine to use Weapons of Mass Destruction (which he knew 
wa= not true because Mossad interrogated Saddam son-in-law who had run =he program and defected to Jordan before
