The O4. 6 drone was intended to signal Israel that both Iran and Hizbullah see =imona as an attractive target for missile 
attacks if Iran is attacked. 
=/a>Hizbullah=followed up the cyberattack with a drone mission on Oct. 6. An Iranian-bui=t surveillance drone dubbed 
Ayoub flew from Lebanon into southern Israel before being shot down by t=e Israeli air force 
<http://www.thedailyb=ast.com/cheats/2012/10/08/drone-shows-israel-penetrable.html> . Officials from the Iranian 
Revolutionary Guard Force told the Al Arabiya n=wspaper that the target was the Israeli nuclear reactor at Dimona, the 
cen=erpiece of Israel's nuclear program. Hizbullah's leader, Hassan Nasral=ah, later gave a speech taking credit for the 
drone flight and warned Israel that more would follow. 
=/a>Again the=timing was no accident. It was the 39th anniversary of the start of the 19=3 war, the devastating Arab-
Israeli conflict in which 10,000 Israelis were killed or wounded. It was also a stunning fa=lure for Israeli intelligence, 
which failed to see the attack coming until=just hours before Egypt and Syria struck. Hizbullah was warning it, too, 
m=ght surprise Israel. At the Israel Defense Forces, Major General Aviv Kochavi, director of military intellige=ce, 
estimates that Hizbullah today has some 80,000 rockets and missiles ai=ed at Israel from Lebanon. The Oct. 6 drone was 
intended to signal Israel =hat both Iran and Hizbullah see Dimona as an attractive target for missile attacks if Iran is 
attacked. 
=/a>Iran's =apabilities to inflict substantial damage on the Saudi and other gulf-stat= oil industries by cyberwarfare are 
difficult for outsiders to assess. Iran is a relative newcomer; until now, it has be=n mostly a victim. Iranian and Hizbullah 
abilities to penetrate Israers=anti-missile defenses are also hard to estimate. Those defenses are among =he best in the 
world, thanks to years of U.S. military assistance and Israeli ingenuity. So it is hard to know h=w hard Iran can really 
strike back if it is attacked. Bluffing and chest-t=umping are a big part of the Iranian game plan. But the virus and the 
dron= together sent a signal, don't underestimate Iran.

=hy Is Qatar Mucking Around in Gaza? 
David B. Roberts 
October 25, 2012 -- A deeply contrar=an streak has taken hold in Qatar these days. Insulated by U.S. security g=arantees, 
eager to use its burgeoning fiscal reserves, and propelled by its elites' reformist zeal, Doha continues to e=ert a 
disproportionate influence on regional politics. Emir Hamad bin Khal=fah Al Thani's latest move was a dramatic vis=t 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/24/world/middleeast/pledgi=g-400-million-qatari-emir-makes-historic-visit-to-
gaza-strip.html> to the Gaza Strip, becoming the first head of state to visit the Palestini=n territory since Hamas wrested 
control of it in 2007. 
Unlike some of its less imaginative =rab rivals, Qatar saw Hamas's regional isolation as an opportunity rather =han a 
problem. Despite its alliance with the United States, Doha has been nurturing its ties with the Palestinian I=lamist group
