There is great disa=pointment. Syria is definitely an issue where American policy has been wro=g. That's my opinion. 
That is also the opinion of much of the public in =rab countries. How you fix that is by showing that you can correct it. If 
Obama supports Kerry on the Palestinia= issue and we get an agreement between Israel and Palestine — that will =e 
something for President Obama to take credit for. If he can convince the=Iranians to stop building a nuclear weapon, 
that will be something he can show the rest of us. The Palestinian=issue is the core issue. 
But if you solve= it today, it would not stop the Iranians from building a bomb.=span style="font-size:18.0pt"> 
What it would do is=decrease what Iran can do to interfere in Arab affairs because Iran portra=s itself as the liberator of 
the Palestinians and the Syrians. That's wh=re Russia and China and Iran are not just cynical in how they are supporting 
Assad but downright insidious.

Making the Mo=t of the U.S. Energy Boom 
George P. Shultz an= Frederick W. Smith 
Nov. 4, 2013 -- In =ovember 1973, members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Count=ies implemented an 
oil embargo against the United States that imperiled th= nation's prosperity and international influence. Forty years 
later, de-linking America's economy and security fr=m high and volatile global oil prices is even more essential to 
protecting=our domestic and international interests. And the U.S. now has the means t= achieve true energy security. 
The 1973 embargo, w=ich effectively began Nov. 5 with the announcement of a 25% cut in product=on, occurred at 
defining moments of our lives. One of us was secretary of =he Treasury, and the rise of OPEC and its "oil weapon" 
profoundly shifted the geopolitical paradigm an= drove the U.S. into a severe recession. The other had just turned an 
idea=to improve the airfreight industry into a new company—today's FedEx <http://quotes.wsj.com/F0X> 
Cor=oration—that was nearly destroyed in its infancy by the spike in fuel pr=ces. 
Although America en=ured and ultimately recovered from the events of 1973, the embargo marked =nly the beginning 
of OPEC's manipulation of the global oil market. By tail=ring oil production and investment strategies to keep markets 
tight and fearful, OPEC members have actively w=rked in the past decade to engineer expensive oil. As a consequence, 
price= have reached levels that would have seemed impossible even at the height =f the oil crises of the 1970s. OPEC 
annual export revenue has exceeded $1 trillion in each of the last tw= years, which ranks among the greatest wealth 
transfers in human history.<=span> 
While OPEC members =re surely hoping to prolong this dynamic, America's energy revolution—wh=ch is taking place on 
both the supply and demand sides—has the potential=to disrupt the status quo to the nation's considerable economic 
and foreign-policy advantage. 
On the supply side,=the domestic energy boom has reestablished the U.S. as a production powerh=use. In fact, the 
increase in U.S. crude oil production during the past fi=e years equates to adding another Kuwait to the global oil 
system. According to the International Energy Agency, th= U.S. will surpass Russia in total liquid fuels production
