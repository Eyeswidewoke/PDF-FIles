"Are you sitti=g down?" Amidror asked. 
"I'm standing =n my neglected garden," Ben-Zeev replied. 
"Netanyahu has=one more request," Amidror told him. "Germany is ready to sign t=e submarine deal. You need to get 
on the next flight to Berlin." 
Ultimately, Ben-Zee= and Heusgen agreed on the final details over the phone, and the contract =as signed on March 20, 
2012, at the Israeli ambassador's residence in Berl=n. Defense Minister Barak flew in especially for the meeting and 
RUcliger Wolf, a state secretary in the Federal Defen=e Ministry, signed on behalf of the German government. Since the 
Israeli g=vernment had financial problems once again, Germany made further concessio=s, agreeing to pay €135 million 
($170 million), a third of the submarine's cost, and to allow Israel to defer pa=ment of its part until 2015. Netanyahu 
dutifully expressed his thanks with=a hand-written letter. 
Still, disappointme=t within the Chancellery is running high, as Netanyahu has simply ignored =erkel's requests. Israel's 
policy of settlement continues unabated and no =urther progress has been made on the sewage treatment plant. The 
Israeli government only released the Palestini=n tax money. Merkel has apparently reached the conclusion that there's 
no =oint in saying anything further to Netanyahu, since he's sure not to liste= in any case. 
Missed an Opportuni=y 
But should the Germ=n government take this as cause to halt submarine production? That would s=nd Israel a signal 
that German support comes with certain stipulations -- =ut it would also amount to showing less solidarity, and that's 
something Merkel doesn't want. 
The chancellor has =issed an opportunity to use one of the few sources of leverage the German =overnment has at its 
disposal to exercise influence on the Israeli governm=nt, which behaves like an occupying power on Palestinian territory. 
The fourth submarine, known as Tannin, was=first launched in early May and its delivery is set for early 2013. 
Submar=ne number five will follow in 2014 and number six by 2017. 
These latest submar=nes are especially important for Israel, because they come equipped with a=technological 
revolution: fuel cell propulsion that allows the ships to wo=k even more quietly and for longer periods of time. Earlier 
Dolphin class submarines had to surface every cou=le days to start up the diesel engine and power their batteries for 
contin=ed underwater travel. The new propulsion system, which doesn't require the=e surface breaks, vastly improves 
the submarines' possible applications. They will be able to travel underwa=er at least four times as long as the previous 
Dolphins, their fuel cells =flowing them to stay below the surface at least 18 days at a time. The Per=ian Gulf off the 
coast of Iran is no longer out of the operating range of the Israeli fleet, all thanks t= quality engineering from Germany. 
In the Haifa harbor= the Tekumah's diesel engines growl loudly enough that conversation is jus= barely possible. Out at 
sea, though, when the submarine is in true operat=on and all systems are functioning cleanly, "you can barely hear the 
motors at all," says the naval=officer in charge of the boat. The Tekumah can plow through the water at s=eeds of 20 
knots and above, a sleek and powerful predator. But the real sk=ll, says the officer, comes in the low-speed operations 
carried out near enemy coasts, places where the Israeli Navy wo=ks covertly, where the Tekumah and the other 
submarines have to approach t=eir targets with great care, moving as if on tiptoe. 
'Everything Possibl.' 
The naval officer s=es his submarine as "one of the places where Israel is being defended=quot; and his determined tone 
leaves no doubt he will take whatever action=necessary if he considers his homeland to be under attack. "The Israeli 
Navy needed this boat," he says.
