There's a simple way out of this impasse -- not by setting up an advers=ry proceeding with a mediator, as you suggest, 
but by you telling me what you disagree with in what i have outlined to you and what your reasons are. You have not 
yet done that in a single letter. So, simply, why not do it right now, and then we can proceed. 
Again, I've repeatedly spelled out the circumstances in extensive detai=. So, simply, tell me what you disagree with and 
why. No mediators are necessary, just a direct response. Or if you feel that you have already done so, then re-send the 
letter in which you responded to my detai=ed account, telling me what you disagree with and why. 
Meanwhile, while the impasse continues, I'm compelled to face constant aggravating and painful circumstances, not to 
speak of humiliating demands and by now significant costs. That can end if we simply resolve these matters quickly in a 
straightforward and simple way. 
I haven't responded to the last part of your letter because it doesn I-=;t relate to the matter at hand. I was referring to 
Max's radical sh=ft in stand, not to how affairs were managed in the past. To repeat, when distributions were made to 
family from the IRA, and taxes and manageme=t fees for the entire estate were drawn from the IRA -- exhausting the 
mandat=ry withdrawal -- Max, my lawyer, raised no question about the financial circum=tances of the beneficiaries, nor 
should he have done so. But when i am requesting tax payments from the marital trust that was set up for M and me 
and the survivor for our lifetimes, all of a sudden he is making exorbitant and humiliating demands. What you describe 
below has nothing to do with this simple matter.

Dear Doddoy, 
We've tried to talk to you about your financial situation several times over the past couple of years, in person, by phone, 
and by e-mail. The process has been extremely unpleasant for us, and we presume for you as well. More importantly, it 
has not led to any enlightenment on any of our parts. Much of what we've tried to say you have flatly denied; some of it 
we think you simply haven't understood. You se=m absolutely convinced that your beliefs are correct and absolutely 
uninteres=ed in trying to look at the situation in other ways, to the extent that you can't even remember these 
exchanges. Much of what you've said=to us conflicts directly with our personal knowledge of your history and with legal 
and financial advice from every source we've heard from. So the conversations lead only to more stress and heartache. 
We are not willing to continue trying to discuss this with you unless somet=ing changes. One change would be to 
include a professional in the convers=tion who can resolve our differences in belief about basic facts. However, you 
have apparently decided that because you disapprove of some of the suggestions made by your former lawyer and 
financial managers -- many of which were based on choices you and Mommoy had made previously -- you will now not 
believe anything they tell you. That leaves us with no recour=e to determine the truth about anything that happened 
between 2007 and 2016.<=r> 
We have suggested a mediator as a last resort. Perhaps with a mediato= we can at least listen to each other's beliefs 
and perspectives, even i= we can't come to agreement on key points. Perhaps a mediator coul= even help us find a way 
to investigate the questions of fact and come to some conclusions that we could all accept. <=ont size="2" face="Arial">
