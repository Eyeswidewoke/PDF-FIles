"carry trade", borrowing at low rates to invest in higher-yielding but riskier assets. In theory this trade should not 
be sustainable in the longer term; the higher yields should merely compensate investors for the default risk. In 
practice, however, a long period of economic growth and falling interest rates meant that for a while the trade 
paid off—until the debacle of 2007-08. 
Carry on regardless 
While those good times lasted, hedge funds thrived. They found it easier than conventional fund managers to play 
the arbitrage game because as well as going long on cheap securities they could go short (bet on a falling price) 
on expensive ones. Sometimes these arbitrage opportunities were small, so borrowed money was needed to 
enhance returns. And hedge funds could impose higher annual charges than conventional managers, with 
performance fees on top. 
But many of these strategies were variants of the carry trade, which changed the face of the finance sector. Banks 
have always borrowed short and lent long. But the fact that bank deposits were guaranteed by the government, 
allied to the implicit guarantees offered when central banks cut rates at times of financial crisis, lowered the 
banks' cost of capital and made leverage more attractive. 
Investment and commercial banks became integrated as the old division imposed by the Glass-Steagall act was 
abolished. Investment banking was no longer just about broking (conducting transactions in return for 
commissions) or giving advice; it was about using the banks' balance-sheets to help clients or manage risks. This 
generated some fat fees but increased the size of the banks' balance-sheets. 
In America, the non-financial corporate sector increased its debt-to-GDP ratio from 58% in 1985 to 76% in 2009, 
whereas the financial sector went from 26% to 108% over the same period. It was that leverage that made the 
banks so vulnerable when the subprime market collapsed in 2008; the assets they ended up owning were illiquid, 
difficult to value and even harder to sell. Banks such as Bear Stearns and Lehman made the fatal mistake of 
assuming that the markets (often their fellow banks) would always be willing to roll over their debts, but they 
suffered a bank run. The only difference was that the charge was led by institutions instead of small depositors. 
In turn, the collapse of the finance sector had a huge impact on the rest of the economy and created a dilemma 
for governments. They want to increase banks' capital ratios to avoid future financial crises. But that will cause 
bank lending to grow more slowly or even contract, an outcome they are equally wary of. 
After the crisis struck the banks needed the governments to rescue them, but now the governments need the 
banks to buy their bonds. One reason why EU governments eventually rescued Greece was that a default would 
have threatened the member countries' banking systems. As debtors and creditors, banks and governments are 
locked in a tight embrace. 
A better bust? 
Bankruptcy is becoming less calamitous 
Jun 24th 2010 
GOING bankrupt used to be the worst thing that could happen to a company. The term stems from the Italian 
habit of conducting banking on wooden benches in marketplaces—banca rupta means broken bench. 
Traditionally, it spelled ruin. 
Slowly but surely, however, bankruptcy law has changed in favour of the corporate debtor. The main driver has 
been American law, which has always tended to favour debtors (farmers in the mid-West and South) against 
creditors (eastern money men). In the 19th century the financial problems of some of the railroad companies 
made lenders more determined to keep the businesses going; the value of an operational railroad was clearly 
higher than that of the steel rails and wooden ties that made up its physical capital. 
In modern America that approach has morphed into Chapter 11, a structure that allows companies to continue 
operating and prevents creditors from foreclosing on the business. Chapter 11 has allowed some companies to
