AYH - P-dock 
Jeffrey - 
Respectfully, I don't think you should get involved without us. The issue =round the CZM permit is VERY binary - at least 
in the sole context of look=ng at protecting AYH. Hoffman has to yield and go east no more than 26 fe=t east (he 
currently is at 10 feet) in order to maintain a minimum safe na=igable waterway such that AYH can continue to dock 
vessels up to 70 feet w=ich (a) is what we pay for under our permit (b) consistent with historical=use and (c) protects the 
long term value of AYH. This compromise has been =ffered to Hoffman at least three times verbally and in writing. He 
and Al=ert rejected it every time. We offered the compromise to CZM committee at =he objection hearing on the record 
as a win win settlement because it allo=s him to expand his existing foot print by 150% and he isn't precluded fro= 
expanding westward as far as he wants. If AYH agrees to anything more th=n a 26 foot boundary, it is of no value to AYH 
and so its better to dig in=for the long haul and appeal whatever CZM gives him until we get to an imp=rtial arbiter —
which we eventually will after CZM makes a ruling. Our =trategy was to get a fair compromise offer on the record along 
with highli=hting the questionable nature of his application the deficiencies of the a=plication, the inaccuracies about 
AYH in the application and the safety an= economic implications of his request — we did this verbally, in writing=and with 
visual aids etc. Also, he is asking for so much more water that =e feel we can get the Army Corps involved which is 
outside his influence (=e doesn't know this yet). Also, to agree to him having more than 26 feet =uts him in the driver 
seat of any negotiation about AYH managing P dock wh=ch is exactly what he wants — the ability to dictate rent terms 
forever. 
I am concerned that, if you get involved now Paul will mislead you in some =ay (which is what he tried to do to me last 
summer), we will not reach an =greement, our position will possibly be prejudiced (as you are an owner of=the asset 
Hoffman will seek to use anything that you say to him as a state=ent against the interest of the owner) and somehow 
Hoffman will make you t=ink we are idiots. This is what we were concerned about months ago, which =s why we 
mapped out our position and strategy with Cecile to solicit her i=put and see if she felt like we were headed in the wrong 
direction (she fe=t good about what we were doing). The management agreement terms have not=been in our favor 
ever and I offered Paul modified terms in the context of=an agreement around the permit. So long as the permit issue is 
handled =96 i.e. He expands to 26 feet, we won't have a gun to our head and we can =egotiate fair terms for him and 
AYH which of course would include managing=the sewage discharge and other issues he is concerned about for the long 
t=rm. He knows this as well. It should be noted that with regards to the t=rmination of the management agreement he 
has retained a lawyer to represen= him, and has threatened to sue us. 
I have been a complete gentleman with Paul. AYH has been more than accommo=ating having paid his entity over 
$500,000 in fees (on time) over the past=7 years - somehow this has been lost by him. He (Paul) should have no 
pro=lem dealing with me or Casner directly to settle this. I can even go down=next week and deal with him together 
with you if he is insistent on you be=ng part of a settlement or if you would like to be part of the resolution.=lf I am not 
dealing with all the background here let me know — maybe we =issed something on our end. 
I am almost certain that Paul isn't entirely ready to give in — which is =hy he called you and not us — so I am hesitant for 
you to get involved w=thout us. At this point he is mainly worried about his slip tenants calli=g him in a few weeks, 
moving his sewer line (we moved ours) and not gettin= his $8500 a month to fund his efforts. I left you a message you 
can reac= me at 
if you want to talk, again — if you think I am m=ssing something here — I am happy to 
listen etc.
