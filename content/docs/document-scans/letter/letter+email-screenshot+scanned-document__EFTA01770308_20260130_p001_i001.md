Request for Support for Caitlin Merrell's Crohn's and Colitis Foundation Walk Team 
Team Young=NYC at the 2011 Take Steps Walk. 
Dear Friends and Family, 
We were delighted last year when Caitlin's frien=s came out in force to support her team Young NYC at the Crohn's and 
Colitis Foundat=on of America "Take Steps, Be Heard" Walk. And we are equally thrilled for he= that she will lead the 
team again this year on May 17 at the South Street Seapor= Pier 17, where we will walk over the Brooklyn Bridge to 
raise awareness and celebrate the courage of patients living with Inflammatory Bowel Disease. <=p> 
This has got to be a good luck year for her team b=cause Caitlin also happens to be 17 years old, and she is the "Honored 
Hero" =or the New York walk, having been a top fund raiser for last years' walk, even w=ile working from her hospital 
bed at New York Hospital during a Crohn's flare. Caitli= was diagnosed with Crohn's when she was 13, in 2008, and has 
been managing wi=h incredible grace and resilience ever since. 
In addition to her many academic and extra-curricu=ar involvements as a junior in high school, Caitlin is committed to 
helping ra=se money for research into these diseases, which affect 1.4 million people in =he U.S. Perhaps even more 
troubling than the numbers of people who have Crohn's o= Colitis is the fact that children under the age of 8 are the 
fastest growin= segment of the population being diagnosed with Inflammatory Bowel Disease.=A0 Crohn's and 
Ulcerative Colitis are chronic, autoimmune diseases that can be incredibly painful and debilitating. 
Caitlin receives a monthly infusion of a powerful =ew drug called Remicade, which suppresses one part of her immune 
system that is cau=ing the damage to her digestive tract. She also undergoes a weekly shot of a se=ond immune 
suppressing agent, called Methotrexate, which stops her immune syste= from rejecting Remicade. The CCFA is 
particularly close to Caitlin's hear= because it helped develop these therapeutic advances that are currently hel=ing to 
keep her in remission. But there are not a lot of therapeutic options fo= people with IBD, and Caitlin is hoping that 
someday the CCFA's work will =elp lead to new and gentler therapies, and perhaps even a cure. 
There are two ways to get involved and show support for Caitlin and the CCFA: 
(First make sure your email server does not clas=ify this email as "junk.") 
1) Donate to Caitlin: Click on the red "Support Me" button below. Your internet =rowser will open up to Caitlin's 
personal walk page, and you can click "Donate=to Caitlin!" No amount is too small....or too big! 
2) Walk with us, join the team and start fundraising: Click on the red "Support Me=94 button below. Your internet 
browser will open up to Caitlin's personal wa=k page, and you can click "Join Young NYC!" Once you join you can donate 
=nd start reaching out to all of your friends and family, and to people you know who =ay be affected by IBD. (Note: If 
you plan on walking with us, please join Caitlin's team and donate ANY amount to y=urself.) 
With Much Love, Appreciation and Hope for a Heal=hy Future for Caitlin,
