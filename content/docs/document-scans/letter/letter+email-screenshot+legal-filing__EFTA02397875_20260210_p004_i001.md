Added Michael Dell, founder of D=ll Inc.: "I always remind people that 96 percent of our potential new cu=tomers today 
live outside of America." That's the rest of the world. And if companies like Dell want to sell to them, he=added, it needs 
to design and manufacture some parts of its products in th=ir countries. 
This is the world we are living =n. It is not going away. But America can thrive in this world, explained Y=ssi Sheffi, the 
M.I.T. logistics expert, if it empowers "as many of our workers as possible to participate" in =ifferent links of these global 
supply chains — either imagining products= designing products, marketing products, orchestrating the supply chain fo= 
products, manufacturing high-end products and retailing products. If we get our share, we'll do fine. 
And here's the good news: We h=ve a huge natural advantage to compete in this kind of world, if we just g=t our act 
together. 
In a world where the biggest ret=rns go to those who imagine and design a product, there is no higher imagi=ation-
enabling society than America. In a world where talent is the most important competitive advantage, there is=no 
country that historically welcomed talented immigrants more than Americ=. In a world in which protection for 
intellectual property and secure capi=al markets is highly prized by innovators and investors alike, there is no country 
safer than America. In=a world in which the returns on innovation are staggering, our government =unding of 
bioscience, new technology and clean energy is a great advantage= In a world where logistics will be the source of a 
huge number of middle-class jobs, we have FedEx and U.P=S. 
If only — if only — we could=come together on a national strategy to enhance and expand all of our natu=al advantages: 
more immigration, most post-secondary education, better infrastructure, more government research, smart incentiv=s 
for spurring millions of start-ups — and a long-term plan to really fi= our long-term debt problems — nobody could 
touch us. We're that close=

The Arab Spring is an oppo=tunity for Israel 
Natalia Simanovsky=/p> 
28 January 2012 - The Israeli go=ernment and security establishment are viewing the sweeping changes in the=Middle 
East and North African region with apprehension. While it is human nature to fear the unknown, the recent 
dev=lopments represent a window of opportunity for reshaping the region. 
That is not to say that the dangers facing Israel are imagined; Israel must=now contend with the consequences of the 
removal of its biggest ally in th= region, Hosni Mubarak, and face a newly-elected government whose position=on 
matters relating to the Jewish state are uncertain at best. 
While not underestimating the challenges facing Israel as it tries to navig=te its way through uncharted territory, the 
new regional order could prese=t Israel with interesting strategic opportunities. Israel, however, has to=be cognisant of 
the nuances being presented. 
The Arab Spring and the new landscape that has emerged in its wake have led=to a number of developments, including 
genuine free elections in Tunisia. =et many in Israel see the rise of the Islamic political party Al Nanda as =he precursor 
to strong anti-Western and anti-Israel sentiment, viewing Al Nanda as an ideological ally with th= Egyptian Muslim
