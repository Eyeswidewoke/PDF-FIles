Day 4 
We are 38.29 N, 29.19 W. 
Yesterday held a little more excitement than the tuna. As we were cutting =p the big fish, a crew member took a deep 
cut along his hand. It was a bl=ody day. 
We have two, suitcase size, medical kits that could supply a field hospital= and Seumas pays for a medical team in the UK 
to be on call for us. So wi=h a doctor's guidance, we cleansed the cuts, poured on the antiseptics, th= iodine, gave the 
shots of anesthetic, and sewed up ten stitches. 
On the cell phone, when the doctor asked where we were, it was a little uns=ttling at the moment to say "about six 
hundred miles out in the Atlantic". 
But all is well, and the hand looks good and is healing. 
The Crew. 
Seumas has brought along some of his British friends. Combined, they have =rossed the Atlantic 43 times. (CI 
 Gareth 
sailed with you on the Bear=of Britain if you remember). Anna, the cook, has sailed across as many ti=es as the rest, and 
doubles as a nurse. Tristen played doctor yesterday, =nd with our mighty first mate, Tim, we have an excellent crew. 
The dynami=s are great. 
The winds are holding in. We jibed to take the winds over our port rather =han starboard as they are beginning to shift 
to the south, and we are a li=tle north of the straight line (the rhumb line) to Antigua. We added the =taysail to the 
mizzen, main and yankee (Bequia's full suite) and are doing=9 to 10 knots. 
Water tanks are full, fuel is good, and yes, tuna for dinner.
