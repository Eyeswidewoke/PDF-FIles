The study seemed to support the considerable=body of evidence suggesting that most people sshouldn'teven try to beat 
the market: Just pick low-cost index funds, assemble a balanced and appropriate portfolio fo= your specific needs, and 
give up on active fund management. The data in th= study didn't prove that the mutual fund managers lacked talent or 
that you couldn't beat the market. But, as =eith Loggie, the senior director of global research and design at S&P Dow 
Jones Indices, said in an intervi=w last week, the evidence certainly ddidn'tbolster the case for investing with active fund 
managers. "Looking at the numbers, you =an't tell whether there is skill involved in what they do or whether their 
performanc= is just a matter of luck," Mr. Loggie said. "= believe that many of them do have skill. But even if they do 
have it, based on how they've done in the past you really can't =redict how they will perform in the future." 
And although those two funds had manage to perf=rm splendidly during the last study — at the time of the article we 
were two weeks away from the completion of another 12 months since the end of that last study, and up to then it had 
been a mediocre for those two mutual funds, leaving Mr. Sommer to conclude that at the end ther= would be none. 
Here are the dismal statistics: The SouthernSun Small Cap fund has actually lost money for investors over the 12 months 
through Thursday. It was down 3.2 percen=, according to Morningstar, and for the nine months through December, it 
was in the bottom=quartile of funds in the S&P. Dow Jones study. The Hodges Small Cap fund h=s done better, gaining 
almost 6 percent through the middle of March. S.&.P Dow J=nes Indices says that put it in the third quartile — or 
second-to•worst one — =trough December. While it's mathematically possible, it is highly unlikely that either will climb 
to th= top quartile in the next few weeks, Mr. Loggie said. 
This is an i=dication that one can never use past performance to predict future returns. Yes It is always possible that any 
one of these funds will beat the market over the l=ng term and some of them will. But the problem is that we don't 
know which of them will do that in advance= And that, in a nutshell, is the kernel of the argument for buying index 
funds. As much as mutual funds will tell you that their strategies employ science, it is a science that is less predictable 
than the weather forecast on your local television station's news program. So why are so many Americans not realizing 
that almost all Mutual Funds underp=rforms the market and continue to pay them millions and billions of =ollars in 
fees? 
A Tale of Two States 
=/p> 
It's hard to compare states so I found Ra=di Weingarten recent article in The Washington Post — It's a tal= of two states —
as both sit side by side along sharing the shoreline with Lake Superior =heir economies both grew from foundations in 
manufacturing, farming and mining, and they each boast a strong history of organized labor. And in 2010, still reeling 
from the recession, they electe= new governors. Except that the governors took these two states -- Minnesota and
