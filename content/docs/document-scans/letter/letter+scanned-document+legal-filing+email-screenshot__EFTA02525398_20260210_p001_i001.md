Yes, our universe is reversible, i.e. each state seems to have exactly =ne possible preceding state, and history is being 
preserved. 
This means that it is probably deterministic, because it is hard to =ecover reversibility from probabilistic computation. 
(Conversely, there =re many ways in which we can get apparent stochasticity from a =eterministic universe.) 
We can implement reversible computation on an irreversible computer, but =ach operation that deletes a bit will have 
to store it somewhere: there =s going to be an accumulation of entropy, of garbage bits. We can also =mplement 
reversibility on an irreversible computer by simply not =erforming any of the operations that delete bits (if we want to, 
we can =eep an undo history). 
It is possible to build reversible Turing complete automata. 
On the other hand, if you take an irreversible finite deterministic =utomaton (like Game of Life) and let it run for long 
enough, it will =lways become periodic. In the worst case, the period is 1, i.e. every =ynamic structure is dead, but the 
period can also be extremely long. =nce the automaton has entered a loop, it is reversible. 
I don't hold a strong ontological belief in computationalism. I am just =urprised that it seems to work so well as a 
possible candidate theory =f everyhing, and it seems to work much better than all the competitors, =ike string theory. 
Both are stubs that cannot yet recover our =bservables, but as far as I can see they hold the promise of doing so. 
=heories based on computation have one big burden: I don't know how they =ould explain what process leads to the 
emergence of the primary =utomaton. This first automaton can be extremely simple, as long as it =s Turing complete, 
but it is not nothing, and it cannot bring itself =nto existence. 
Theories based on classical math are much more liberal when it comes to =reation, because they can postulate the 
existence of things that have =ot been computed. Their burdens are that they are computationally =often even 
uncountably) infinitely more expensive, i.e. God needs to =uy an infinitely or even uncountable infinitely more expensive 
computer =o run what amounts to be the same universe. And perhaps more dooming, =omputationalists can tell God 
how to make a computer, but =ypercomputationalists cannot tell how to make a hypercomputer, because 
=ypercomputation is not constructive. 
If there are metacomputational operators, they are outside the realm of =nalytical description, because all analytical 
description ultimately =elies on computational languages and tools. Contrary to what Penrose =opes, our mathematical 
creativity seems to rely entirely on Turing =omputable functionality. This does not mean that such a =etacomputational 
operator as he intuits does not exist, but it means =hat we probably cannot discover its existence. I will give a talk about 
=he idea of metacomputational operators at the Science of Consciousness =onference; perhaps James Tagg will get 
something out of it :) 
I am not aware of fudge btw., and will appreciate if you point it out.
