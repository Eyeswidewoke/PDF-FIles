Deutsche Bank 
Compliance 
Dodd-Frank Title VII Regulation: Annual Notice of Right to CFTC Segregation 
of Initial Margin for Uncleared Swaps ("IM") 
Dear Collateral Officer':
Deutsche Bank AG ("Deutsche Bank") is provisionally registered as a swap dealer with the Commodity Futures Trading 
Commission (CFTC) under The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd- Frank"). This 
communication is to remind you that if you are a U.S. Person or a Guaranteed Affiliate or Affiliate Conduit of a U.S. 
Person (each as defined by the CFTC), you have a right to segregate any initial margin that you post in respect of 
CFTC-regulated uncleared swaps. 
In accordance with CFTC rule 23.701, we are notifying you that, to the extent you post IM in respect of any CFTC-
regulated uncleared swap with us that is executed on or subsequent to the applicable compliance date, you have the 
right to elect that IM be segregated in accordance with the requirements set forth in CFTC rules 23.702 and 23.703 
(the 'CFTC Segregation Regime"). Unless you wish to change the election you previously made (or were deemed to 
have made), your existing segregation arrangements, if any, will remain in effect and will apply to future CFTC-
regulated uncleared swap transactions. You may change your election at any time by delivering written notice to us. 
If you elect to require the CFTC Segregation Regime, certain documentation, including a tri-party custodial agreement 
that meets the requirements of the CFTC Segregation Regime, must be put in place. Choosing this election might 
prevent us from entering into new CFTC-regulated uncleared swaps with you until such documentation is in place.2
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you choose to enter into an Uncleared Swap with us prior to executing such 
documentation, you will be deemed to have made an election not to require CFTC IM Segregation for that particular 
transaction. 
Unless your most recent election with us is to require the CFTC Segregation Regime, if you do not respond within 
twenty (20) business days of receipt of this Notice of Right to CFTC Segregation of Initial Margin, we will deem 
you to have confirmed receipt of this notice by your Collateral Officer and to have made an election to not 
require the CFTC Segregation Regime. In the event you execute an Uncleared Swap with us after receipt of this 
notice but prior to the expiration of the above period, and we have not otherwise obtained your election, we will deem 
you to have confirmed receipt of this Notice of Right to CFTC Segregation of Initial Margin by your Collateral Officer 
and to have made an election to not require the CFTC Segregation Regime. You may change your election at any 
time in writing. If you do not elect CFTC Segregation, you remain free to make or retain other arrangements with us 
for the segregation of initial margin. 
A non-exclusive list of custodians that are currently considered acceptable to us for the CFTC Segregation Regime, 
indicative pricing information, CFTC Segregation Election Form, and Frequently Asked Questions are provided in the
