information, the FBI can neither confirm nor deny the existence of any records responsive to your request, 
which, if they were to exist, would be exempt from disclosure pursuant to FOIA Exemptions (b)(6) and

Express authorization and consent. If you seek disclosure of any existing records on this basis,

and then sign it. Alternatively, the subject may prepare a document containing the required descriptive data

demonstrate that the public interest in disclosure outweighs personal privacy interests. In this regard, you
