of the shares of the Common Stock issued upon conversion of the Debenture pursuant to 
a Registration Statement exceeds the amount of damages which the Investor has 
otherwise been required to pay be reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or

The Investor, upon receipt of notice from the Company that an 
event has occurred which requires a Post-Effective Amendment to the Registration 
Statement or a supplement to the prospectus included therein, shall promptly discontinue 
the sale of Registrable Securities until the Investor receives a copy of a supplemented or 
amended prospectus from the Company, which the Company shall provide as soon as 
practicable after such notice. 
(h) 
If the Company fails to keep the Registration Statement referred to 
above continuously effective during the requisite period, then the Company shall, 
promptly upon the request of the Investor, use its best efforts to update the Registration 
Statement or file a new registration statement covering the Registrable Securities 
remaining unsold, subject to the terms and provisions hereof. 
(i) 
The Investor agrees to provide the Company with any information 
or undertakings reasonably requested by the Company in order for the Company to 
include any appropriate information concerning the Issuer in the Registration Statement 
or in order to promote compliance by the Company or the Issuers with the Securities Act. 
(j) 
With a view to making available to the Investor the benefits of Rule 
144 and Rule 144A promulgated under the Securities Act and other rules and regulations 
of the Commission that may at any time permit the Investor to sell securities of the 
Company to the public without registration, the Company covenants that it shall use 
commercially reasonable efforts to (i) file in a timely manner all reports and other 
documents required to be filed by it under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and 
the rules and regulations adopted by the Commission thereunder and (ii) take such 
further action as the Investor may reasonably request (including providing any 
information necessary to comply with Rule 144 and Rule 144A, if available with respect 
to resales of the Registrable Securities under the Securities Act), at all times, all to the 
extent required from time to time to enable the Investor to sell Registrable Securities 
without registration under the Securities Act within the limitation of the exemptions 
provided by (x) Rule 144 and Rule 144A (if available with respect to resales of the 
Registrable Securities) under the Securities Act, as such rules may be amended from time 
to time, or (y) any other rules or regulations now existing or hereafter adopted by the 
Commission
