Definition of Term Retirement. The term "retirement" with respect to the 
General Partner shall include cessation of the status of the General Partner as a result of 
dissolution, death, insanity, bankruptcy, or voluntary or involuntary withdrawal as provided for 
in this Agreement, other than termination of the Partnership. The term "retirement" with respect 
to a Limited Partner shall include a voluntary or involuntary withdrawal from the status of a 
Partner pursuant to the provisions of this ARTICLE V. 
5.2 
Retirement of a Limited Partner. In the event of the death, disability, 
incapacity, incompetency, termination, bankruptcy, insolvency or dissolution of a Limited 
Partner, the interest of such Limited Partner will continue at the risk of the Partnership business. 
Subject to Section 5.7 below, a Limited Partner may voluntarily retire from the Partnership as of 
any Withdrawal Date as of which he is eligible to withdraw all of his capital from the Partnership 
by giving notice of retirement in writing to the General Partner at least forty-five (45) days prior 
to such Withdrawal Date. A retirement notice will be irrevocable by a Limited Partner, unless 
the General Partner, in its sole discretion, determines otherwise. A retiring Limited Partner shall 
continue as a Partner until the applicable Withdrawal Date. Subject to Sections 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4 
above, the retiring Limited Partner will be paid an amount equal to at least ninety percent (90%) 
of his Liquidating Share (as defined in Section 5.4 below), net of any Incentive Allocation, Early 
Withdrawal Charges and accrued expenses through the Withdrawal Date and subject to the 
reserve referred to in Section 5.5 below, within thirty (30) days after the Withdrawal Date, with 
the balance, if any, settled without interest no later than thirty (30) days after completion of the 
audit of the Partnership's financial statements for the year during which the retirement took 
place, subject to the reserve referred to in Section 5.5 below. Distributions may be made in cash 
and/or in Securities, in the sole discretion of the General Partner, in the manner described in 
Section 4.2(c) above. Any of these conditions may be waived in full or in part by the General 
Partner from time to time in its sole discretion with respect to one or more Limited Partners, 
without notice to or the consent of the other Limited Partners.
