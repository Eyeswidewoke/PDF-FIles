the Partnership's trade or business (including investments, if any, in partnerships that are not 
managed by the General Partner or its affiliates, such as certain Third-Party Ventures). 
The consequences of these limitations will vary depending upon the particular tax situation 
of each taxpayer. Accordingly, noncorporate Limited Partners should consult their tax advisers 
with respect to the application of these limitations. 
Application of Rules for Income and Losses from Passive Activities. The Code restricts 
the deductibility of losses from a "passive activity" against certain income which is not derived 
from a passive activity. This restriction applies to individuals, personal service corporations and 
certain closely held corporations. Income or loss from investments in master limited partnerships 
("MLPs") will generally be passive income or loss and is applied separately with respect to each 
publicly traded partnership. Accordingly, losses recognized by the Partnership from one MLP 
may not be available to offset income from other MLPs owned by the Partnership. Pursuant to 
Temporary Regulations issued by the Treasury Department, income or loss from the Partnership's 
investment and trading activity generally will not constitute income or loss from a passive activity, 
except as provided below. Therefore, passive losses from other sources generally could not be 
deducted against a Limited Partner's share of such income and gain from the Partnership. Income 
or loss attributable to certain activities of the Partnership, including investments in other 
partnerships engaged in certain trades or businesses or real estate, may constitute passive activity 
income or loss. 
Pursuant to Temporary Regulations issued by the Treasury Department, all or a portion of 
the Partnership's net income from an "equity-financed lending activity",II if any, will be 
characterized as nonpassive. The Partnership may be treated as engaged in the business of lending 
money, and, accordingly, all or a portion of the net income from such business may constitute 
income from an "equity-financed lending activity" that is treated as nonpassive. However, a net 
loss from such business is generally expected to constitute a passive activity loss that is subject to 
the deductibility limitations described above. 
Limitation on Deductibility of Net Losses. In the case of a noncorporate taxpayer, any net 
business loss for any taxable year beginning during the period 2018 through 2025 may not be used 
to offset nonbusiness income in excess of $250,000 ($500,000 in the case of a married couple 
filing jointly). To the extent the Partnership is considered to be a trader in securities, as it expects 
to be, any net loss from the Partnership may, therefore, be unavailable to offset investment income 
earned by a Limited Partner, including investment income earned outside of the Partnership. Any 
disallowed loss will carry forward and may, subject to certain limitations, be used to reduce taxable 
income earned by such Limited Partner in future years. Any trading losses incurred by a 
partnership in which the Partnership invests will be subject to the same limitations when allocated 
to a noncorporate Limited Partner.

An equity-financed lending activity is generally defined as an activity that involves a trade or business of 
lending money what, for the taxable year. the average outstanding balance of the liabilities incurred in such activity 
does not exceed 80% of the average outstanding balance of the interest-bearing assets held with respect to such
