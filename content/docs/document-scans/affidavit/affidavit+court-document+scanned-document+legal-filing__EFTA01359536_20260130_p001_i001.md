Section 2 -- By Directors: 
The Board of Directors shall have power to make and adopt Bylaws of the Corporation, except that 
the Board of Directors shall have no power to effectively change the quorum for meetings of 
shareholders or of the Board of Directors, or to effectively change any provisions of the Bylaws 
with respect to the removal of directors or the filling of vacancies in the Board resulting from 
removal by the shareholders; provided, however, that the shareholders entitled to vote with respect 
thereto as in this Article IX above-provided may alter, amend or repeal Bylaws made by the Board 
of Directors. If any bylaw regulating an impending election of Directors is adopted by the Board of 
Directors, which effectively amends or repeals a regulation concerning the method, notice, quorum 
necessary or otherwise substantially affecting the means for conducting an impending election of 
the Board of Directors, there shall be set forth in the notice of the next meeting of shareholders for 
the election of Directors, the bylaw so made and adopted together with a concise statement of the 
changes made. 
ARTICLE X - INDEMNITY 
Any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or 
completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative by 
reason of the fact that he is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or 
was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another 
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, may be indemnified by the 
Corporation against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in 
settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with such action, suit or 
proceeding if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed 
to the best interests of the Corporation, and with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, he 
had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. 
The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or 
upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the 
person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not 
opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and with respect to any criminal action or 
proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful. 
Any indemnification under the foregoing provisions shall be made by the Corporation only as 
authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of a director, officer, 
employee or agent is proper in the circumstances because he had met the applicable standard of 
conduct set forth above. Such determination shall be made by the Board of Directors by a majority 
vote of a quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, or 
if such a quorum is not obtainable, or even if obtainable and the quorum of disinterested directors so
