Leon<=span>, 
As you are well aware, There is little I won't do for you, or at least try to do as a fr=end, and a great deal that I have 
already done ( both known an= some things that will need to remain unknown.) Our arrangement was for me to 
architect sophisticated structures that would be beneficial to you. that =s what I have done and will continue do in 
order to fulfill myrobligations under our agreement. 
The discovered fact tha= you in reality need an entire family 
office built from scratch has been trying I =ave already agreed de- facto to try to help. I would suggest that 
Phai=ons payroll and attention pales in importance to your personal structure,=hich has taken a back seat, Some of 
my suggestions regarding the Eysium office a=e as follows you will need a budget of 3- 5 million per year. CEO 1 
million,4>=A0 new tax person to work with rich, 250. new bookkeeper ,200 =ew paralegal to work with ADA Alan etc, 
coordinating with Apollo, Akin , paul weiss , new acct openings, sec filings , sales tax review, etc. 4>=A0 $150. art 
point person. loan , inventory, purchasing support, $?? softw=re servers. video conferencing, tax oversight. 
=C24> I believe You should rapidly address trustees , gift trust, success=on, wills of Debra and children„ 
monetization events, cash flow.=etc 
I can of course share my experiences with you on each issue. 
=C24> With regard the more pressing issue I am uncertain of just how to proceed. I am torn, as my very strong 
inclination is not to be=20 involved at all. It is extremely time consuming, delicate, fraught w=th many pitfall many that 
will make you very upset and a major pain in the ass.Q.A0 I wrote you months ago that the quality of the people 
involved need to =e upgraded. ( lucky for me these last issues arose way before the begi=ning of my involvement ) I 
am also aware however of my overar=hing friendship obligations of ok, -given all the complexities =who else can do 
it? problem. 
Your family office needs a daddy. child=en with good intentions are running around , sniping , nitpicking with little 
direction. As a stopgap measure I am suggesting , we put in Larry Delson to take charge Everyone would report to him. 
eilee= included. He would however work for me. this is not, by a long shot=C2* my first choice as I prefer only being 
responsible and standing behind =y own personal work ( ie the word DONE will no longer be transmi=ted to reflect 
status stated by others ) 
=With no commitment on my part whatsoever, to do it. So far as I have failed in my attempt in trying to think 
through the problem creatively=. My organizations handling of the more complex issues I believe you might find very 
costly, very ! ( however many structures available some risk sharing,=maybe risk caps ,etc ) but would require my teams 
doing the work , not your=. Ada should be only a trust, grat administrator. not sure what role you prefer for=Eileen as 
you hired her initially to oversee investments. whether Ric= your controller stays or not, is not urgent. having Tom 
report to a =ew person,- is. coordination with Suydam Kathy gregory, I wo=ld suggest limiting to one person. The 
increasing public profile needs to be tak=n into consideration.
