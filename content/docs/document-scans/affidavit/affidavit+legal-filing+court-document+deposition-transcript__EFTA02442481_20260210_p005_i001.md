that offering homes in a good golf course community from $135,000 up will be in the heart 
of the baby boomers retirement plan. 
Apes Hill Club is 470 acres that overlooks both the west coast of the Caribbean and the 
east cost of the Atlantic. It has been the most successful and highest quality development I 
have ever been associated with. While at the present time, with the pound low against the 
dollar and the financial crisis in England and Ireland at its zenith, our sales are slow, last 
year Apes Hill Club made $33 million net profit. However, because the cash flow was 
needed for continued development in Apes Hill, none of the money was brought back to 
Landmark. 
Obviously, if we have a completely integrated management staff and presently no income 
from our two major developments, we have a cash flow problem. A year ago I believed 
that recession was on us, things would be bad, and Landmark would be (if I could keep the 
team together) in an ideal position to take advantage of the greatest financial crisis in my 
lifetime. Therefore, I made the decision not to cut management back to what was 
necessary for Barbados and South Padre, but to use it to look for new opportunities and to 
be prepared to become a major player when the market foreclosed on what I knew would 
be billions of dollars of distressed assets. 
This year we have entered into a contract for the development of a distressed golf project in 
St. Lucia. We have reached agreement with the government of St. Kitts to start up, again, 
a resort project on the west coast of St. Kitts that had been abandoned because of 
mismanagement and corruption, and we are at the contact stage of entering into agreement 
on a 5,000 acre development in North Carolina where the owners need management and 
they need the ability to attract some money on a last-in, first-out basis, and we are closely 
following a half dozen other distressed properties. 
In order to meet our negative cash requirements, we have exhausted our cash reserve, we 
have scrambled where possible, and I have borrowed over $1 million personally and put it 
into the company. A few months ago, a government bank for the eastern Caribbean, 
originally started by the World Bank, agreed to loan Landmark $5 million. The security for 
the loan would be the 100% of the St. Lucia company that owns one-third of Apes Hill 
Club in Barbados. That one-third interest is worth somewhere between $20 million and 
$50 million; however, it is not the type of security that you can leverage in the U.S. I am 
told that this loan has been approved by the Board of Directors and I will be able to draw 
funds the first of June; however, since I have received no written confirmation of this to-
date, I am naturally concerned. 
How I Would Like to Use Your Mind — If Allowed 
I. If I obtain the $5 million loan the question before the house is how to position 
Landmark to create the maximum value from its reputation, its management 
team, and its $153 million tax loss. While I am a real estate man and know little of 
financial posturing, the best idea I have heard is to use Landmark as a platform 
company to become a leader in the management and resurrection of a few of these 
foreclosed assets, and in 5 to 7 years when the profits can be realized from this financial 
disaster, with the tax loss used and the reputation enhanced, to go public as a branded
