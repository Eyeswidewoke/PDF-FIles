instructions of the Debtor with respect to the Securities Account (or, if applicable, the specific 
security entitlements so identified in such notice). In the event that a Notice of Sole Control

and/or a Notice of Sole Control irrespective of any knowledge of the Intermediary whether or not 
an event of default shall exist or the Secured Party shall have any agreement with the Debtor 
limiting or conditioning its right to give such Entitlement Orders or Notice of Sole Control. The 
Intermediary shall have no duty to investigate the circumstances wider which the Secured Party 
is entitled to give any Entitlement Orders or Notice of Sole Control.

item of property, including cash, credited to the Securities Account on or after the date of the 
Agreement shall be treated as a "financial asset" within the meaning of Section 8-102(a)(9) of the 
UCC. 
2.9 
Statements. The Intermediary will send copies of all monthly statements 
concerning the Securities Account and/or any financial assets credited thereto simultaneously to 
both the Debtor and the Secured Party. Such statements shall be sent to the Debtor and the 
Secured Party at the address for each set forth in this Agreement.
