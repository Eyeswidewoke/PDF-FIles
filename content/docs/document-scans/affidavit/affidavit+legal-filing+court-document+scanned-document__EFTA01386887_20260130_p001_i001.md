RIN II • 094 Alpha Group Capital LLC 
concession grantor will not legislate, impose regulations or change applicable laws or act contrary to the law in a way that 
would materially and adversely affect an Obligor's ability to operate the infrastructure asset or the revenue or taxation status 
of the Obligor, and accordingly, the ability of the Obligor to service its debt under the related Collateral Obligation. 
Obligor Insolvency Considerations 
Various laws enacted for the protection of creditors may apply to the Issuer or others and may affect the Collateral 
Obligations. The information in this and the following paragraph applies to U.S. Obligors. Insolvency considerations will 
differ with respect to non-U.S. Obligors. If a court in a lawsuit brought by an unpaid creditor or a representative of an 
Obligor's creditors, such as a trustee in bankruptcy, were to find that the Obligor did not receive fair consideration or 
reasonably equivalent value for incurring the indebtedness constituting such Collateral Obligation and, after giving effect to 
such indebtedness, the Obligor (i) was insolvent, (ii) was engaged in a business for which the remaining assets of such 
Obligor constituted unreasonably small capital, or (iii) intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its 
ability to pay such debts as they mature, such court could determine to invalidate, in whole or in part, such indebtedness as 
a fraudulent conveyance, to subordinate such indebtedness to existing or future creditors of the Obligor or to recover 
amounts previously paid by the Obligor in satisfaction of such indebtedness. In addition, in the event of the insolvency of an 
Obligor of a Collateral Obligation, payments made on such Collateral Obligations could be subject to avoidance as a 
"preference" if made within a certain period of time (which may be as long as one year under federal bankruptcy law or even 
longer under state laws) before insolvency. 
In general, if payments on Collateral Obligations were to be avoidable, whether as fraudulent conveyances or preferences, 
such payments could be recaptured, either from the initial recipient, such as the Issuer, or from subsequent transferees of 
such payments, such as the holders of the Securities. To the extent that any such payments are recaptured from the Issuer, 
the resulting loss will be borne by the holders of the Securities, starting with the Preferred Shareholders. However, a court 
in a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding would be able to direct the recapture of any such payment from a holder of 
Securities only to the extent that such court has jurisdiction over such holder or its assets. Moreover, it is likely that 
avoidable payments could not be recaptured directly from a holder that has given value in exchange for its Securities, in 
good faith and without knowledge that the payments were avoidable. Nevertheless, since there is no judicial precedent 
addressing the recapture of available payments from holders of securities issued in structured transactions such as the 
Securities, there can be no assurance that a holder of Preferred Shares will be able to avoid recapture on this or any other 
basis.

RISKS RELATED TO AN INVESTMENT IN THE PREFERRED SHARES. EACH POTENTIAL INVESTOR SHOULD READ 
THIS MEMORANDUM IN ITS ENTIRETY AND IS URGED TO CONSULT ITS PROFESSIONAL ADVISERS BEFORE
