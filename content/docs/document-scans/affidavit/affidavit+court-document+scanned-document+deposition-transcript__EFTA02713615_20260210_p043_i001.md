OUTLINE OF LIMITED PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT 
The following outline summarizes the material provisions of the Limited Partnership 
Agreement that are not discussed elsewhere in this Memorandum. This outline is not definitive, 
and each prospective Limited Partner should carefully read the Limited Partnership Agreement, 
annexed hereto as Exhibit A, in its entirety. 
Limited Liability. A Limited Partner is liable for debts and obligations of the Partnership 
only to the extent of his Interest in the Partnership in the fiscal year (or portion thereof) to which 
such debts and obligations are attributable. In order to meet a particular debt or obligation, a 
Limited Partner or former Limited Partner will, in the discretion of the General Partner, be 
required to make additional contributions or payments up to, but in no event in excess of, the 
aggregate amount of returns of capital and other amounts actually received by him from the 
Partnership during or after the fiscal year to which such debt or obligation is attributable. 
Term. The Partnership will have a perpetual life, unless a determination is made by the 
General Partner that the Partnership should be dissolved. The General Partner may elect to 
dissolve the Partnership at any time in its discretion. 
Capital Accounts. Upon admission to the Partnership, each Partner will have a Capital 
Account established on the books of the Partnership. Each capital contribution made by a 
Partner shall be deemed to generate a separate Capital Account. At the end of each accounting 
period, each Partner's Capital Account will be (i) increased or decreased by its share of any net 
capital appreciation or depreciation for such accounting period (determined after taking all 
Partnership expenses into account); and (ii) decreased by any withdrawals made by, or 
distributions made from, such Capital Account as of the end of such accounting period. At the 
end of each fiscal year, each Capital Account will be adjusted by any net capital appreciation 
which is not allocated to the General Partner as an Incentive Allocation. (See "Allocation of 
Gains and Losses.. New Issues.") 
A partnership percentage will be determined for each Capital Account for each 
accounting period, by dividing such Capital Account as of the beginning of such accounting 
period by the aggregate value of all Capital Accounts as of the beginning of such accounting 
period ("Partnership Percentage"). 
Additional Capital Contributions. 
With the prior approval of the General Partner, 
Limited Partners may make additional capital contributions to the Partnership as of the first day 
of any calendar month in an amount of at least $100,000, subject to the discretion of the General 
Partner to accept lesser amounts or to accept contributions at other times. The General Partner 
may, in its discretion, decline to accept any additional contributions for any reason. 
Management. The management of the Partnership is vested exclusively in the General 
Partner and the Investment Manager. The Limited Partners will have no part in the management 
of the Partnership and will have no authority or right to act on behalf of the Partnership in 
connection with any matter. The General Partner, and its principals, affiliates, members, 
managers and officers, may engage in any other business venture, whether or not such business
