2014 V.I. LEXIS 45, *; 61 V.I. 13, ** 
expressly define a marital homestead, both the United States Court of Appeals for the 
Third Circuit and the Appellate Division of the United States District Court for the Virgin 
Islands have interpreted § 2305(a), (c) to hold that a "marital homestead" is any 
homestead in which a husband and wife both reside during the marriage and that is owned 
by one or both of the spouses.

[HN3] The court may distribute personal property in accordance with V.I. Code Ann. tit. 16, 
§ 109(4). However, the statute does not define marital property. Whether an asset is 
marital property or separate property for purposes of distribution of the marital estate is a 
matter reserved to the sound discretion of the trial court. Once these distinctions have 
been made, the trial judge has broad equitable powers in disposing of marital property.

[HN5] Considering the tremendous statutory examples and case law from other 
jurisdictions holding pension funds as marital property, the Virgin Islands has determined

divorce. To the extent earned during the marriage, the pension benefits represent 
compensation for marital effort and are substitutes for current earnings which would have 
increased the marital standard of living or would have been converted into other assets 
divisible at dissolution. Subjecting the benefits to division is just, because in most cases 
the retirement benefits constitute the most valuable asset the couple has acquired and 
they both have relied upon their pension payments for security in their older years.

[HN6] Most states hold that an educational degree is not marital property. Courts have 
consistently considered whether one spouse had postponed his or her own career and 
educational goals to support and contribute to the career and educational goals of the 
other spouse. They also acknowledge the injustice that occurs after a couple collectively 
works towards the attainment of an advanced educational degree or career goal, the
