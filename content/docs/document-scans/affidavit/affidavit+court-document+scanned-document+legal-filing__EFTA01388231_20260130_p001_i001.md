INTRODUCTION TO THE 
2006 ISDA DEFINITIONS 
The 2006 ISDA Definitions (the "2006 Definitions") are intended for use in confirmations of 
individual transactions ("Confirmations") governed by agreements such as the 1992 ISDA Master 
Agreements and the 2002 ISDA Master Agreement (the "ISDA Master Agreements") published by the 
International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (`ISDA"). Copies of the ISDA Master Agreements 
arc available from the executive offices of ISDA and on the ISDA wcbsitc, www.isda.org. A sample 
form of document constituting a Confirmation is attached as Exhibit I. Exhibits 1I-A to 11-H set out 
sample forms of specific provisions for inclusion in a Confirmation to document particular types of 
transactions. 
The 2006 Definitions are an update of the 2000 ISDA Definitions (the "2000 Definitions"), which 
many panics to privately negotiated derivative transactions have incorporated into existing Confirmations 
or other documents. The 2006 Definitions can be incorporated into future Confirmations or other 
documents. Existing Confirmations or other documents that incorporate the 2000 Definitions will not, 
without further action by the parties, be affected by the use of the 2006 Definitions for subsequent 
transactions. 
The purpose of the 2006 Definitions is to provide the basic framework for the documentation of 
privately negotiated interest rate and currency derivative transactions. Although the 2006 Definitions 
were drafted with this purpose in mind, ISDA recognizes that parties documenting other types of privately 
negotiated derivative transactions might find it helpful to incorporate the 2006 Definitions into 
Confirmations for those transactions. For example, when documenting an equity swap transaction using 
the 2002 ISDA Equity Derivatives Definitions or a commodity swap using the 2005 ISDA Commodity 
Derivatives Definitions, parties may wish to incorporate the 2006 Definitions into the relevant 
Confirmation in order to document mom easily floating or fixed payments arising under those 
transactions. 
As in the case of other product-specific sets of definitions published by ISDA, parties using the 
2006 Definitions to document a transaction may adapt or supplement the standard provisions set out in the 
2006 Definitions in accordance with the specific economic terms agreed between them. 
The 2006 Definitions may be updated in the future to include additional definitions and 
provisions, and it is anticipated that currency and floating rate option definitions (and related definitions 
and provisions) will be added or changed from time to time as transactions involving rates and currencies 
not included in the 2006 Definitions become more prevalent or as necessary to reflect market practice. 
ISDA anticipates that it will publish amendments and supplements to the 2006 Definitions from time to 
time (including on its website, www.isda.org). At any time a copy of the then-current version of the 2006 
Definitions can be obtained from the executive offices of ISDA and also from the ISDA website. 
Unless otherwise agreed, where parties incorporate the 2006 Definitions into a 
Confirmation, they will incorporate the 2006 Definitions as amended and supplemented through 
the date on which they enter into the relevant transaction. Amendments and supplements to the 2006 
Definitions will be deemed to have been made when published by ISDA. If parties want to exclude one 
or more amendments or supplements made to the 2006 Definitions, they should, in the relevant 
Confirmation, specify the amendment(s) or supplement(s) that they want to exclude or specify an "as 
amended and supplemented through" date (e.g., "as amended and supplemented through January I, 
2008").
