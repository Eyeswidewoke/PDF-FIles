SAFEWAY INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
The Company also has a 49% ownership interest in Casa Ley, S.A. de C.V. ("Casa Ley"), which operates 206 food and general 
merchandise stores in Western Mexico. See Note V. 
Basis of Presentation The consolidated financial statements include Safeway Inc., a Delaware corporation, and all majority-
owned subsidiaries and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of 
America. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company's investment in Casa Ley is 
reported using the equity method. Safeway's equity in earnings of Casa Ley is based on financial information prepared in accordance 
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and is recorded on a one-month delay basis because financial 
information for the latest month is not available from Casa Ley in time to be included in Safeway's consolidated results until the following 
reporting period. 
Fiscal Year The Company's fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest December 31. The last three fiscal years consist of the 53-
week period ended January 3, 2015 ("fiscal 201C or "2014"), the 52-week period ended December 28, 2013 ("fiscal 2013" or '2013") and 
the 52-week period ended December 29, 2012 ("fiscal 2012" or "2012"). 
Correction to Cash Flow Classification Subsequent to the issuance of the fiscal 2013 consolidated financial statements, the 
Company determined that the $57.4 million loss on foreign currency translation within the 2013 consolidated statement of cash flows was 
reflected as a reduction in net cash flow from operating activities, and should not have reduced operating cash flow for U.S. GAAP 
purposes. As a result, the 2013 presentation has been corrected to increase cash flows from operating activities—continuing operations 
by $57.4 million with an offset to the line item Effect of changes in exchange rates on cash. Safeway assessed the materiality of this 
adjustment on previously issued financial statements in accordance with the SEC's Staff Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") No. 99 and 
concluded that the correction was not material. This correction results in no other changes to the consolidated financial statements and 
had no effect on the change in cash or ending cash. 
Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United 
States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, 
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
Translation of Foreign Currencies Assets and liabilities of the Company's foreign subsidiaries and Casa Ley are translated into 
U.S. dollars at year-end rates of exchange, and income and expenses are translated at average rates during the year. Adjustments 
resulting from translating financial statements into U.S. dollars, net of applicable income taxes, are included as a separate component in 
the statement of comprehensive income, within accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheets and within 
the consolidated statements of stockholders' equity. 
After the net asset sale of Canadian operations (-Sale of Canadian Operations"), the adjustments resulting from translation of 
retained assets and liabilities denominated in Canadian dollars are included in the statement of income as a foreign currency gain or 
loss. Foreign currency loss was $131.2 million in fiscal 2014 and $57.4 million in fiscal 2013. The Company made a reclassification on 
the 2013 consolidated statement of cash flows to correct the classification of the loss on foreign currency.
