Table of Contra's 
will have the effect, ova time, of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of Class B common stock who retain their shams in the long 
term. For a description of the dual class structure, see "Description of Capital Stock—Common Stock—Voting Rights." 
KAI? controls us and its interests may conflict with ours or yours in the future. 
Immediately following this offering of Class A common stock. KKR will not hold any of our Class A common stock, but will 
beneficially own 61% of our common stock through its beneficial ownership of our Class B common stock and, consequently, 73% of the 
combined voting power of our common stock. Each sham of our Class 13 common stock will have ten votes per share, and our Class A common 
stock, which is the stock we are selling in this offering, will have one vote per share. As a malt. KKR will have the ability to elect all of the 
members of our Board and thereby control our policies and operations, including the appointment of management, future issuances of our Class A 
common stock or other securities, the payment of dividends, if any, on our Class A common stock, the incurrence of debt by us, amendments to our 
amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws. and the entering into of extraordinary transactions and the 
interests of KKR may not in all cams be aligned with your interests. 
In addition. KKR may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures and other transactions that, in its judgment, could enhance 
its investment, even though such transactions might involve risks to you. For example, KKR could cause us to make acquisitions that increase our 
indebtedness or cause us to sell revenue-generating assets. KKR is in the business of making investments in companies and may from time to time 
acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will 
provide that none of KKR or any director who is not employed by us (including any non-employee director who serves as one of our officers in 
both his or her director and officer capacities) or his or her affiliates will have any duty to refrain from engaging. directly or indirectly, in the same 
business activities or similar business activities or lines of business in which we operate. KKR also may pursue acquisition opportunities that may 
be complementary to our business, and, as a result. those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. 
So long as KKR continues to beneficially own a sufficient number of shares of Class B common stock, even if it beneficially owns 
significantly less than 50% of the shares of our outstanding common stock, it will continue to be able to effectively control our decisions. For 
example, if our Class B common stock amounted to 15% of our outstanding common stock, beneficial owners of our Class B common stock 
(including KKR), would collectively control 64% of the voting power of our common stock. The shares of our Class B common stock beneficially 
owned by KKR may be transferred to an unrelated third party if the holders of a majority of the shares of Class B common stock have consented to 
such transfer in writing in advance. 
In addition. KKR will be able to determine the outcome of all matters requiring stockholder approval and will be able to cause or 
prevent a change of control of our Company or a change in the composition of our Board and could preclude any acquisition of our Company. This 
concentration of voting control could deprive you of an opportunity to receive a premium for your shares of Class A common stock as part of a sale 
of our Company and ultimately might affect the market price of our Class A common stock. 
Certain provisions of Delaware law and anti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents could delay or prevent a change of control 
Certain provisions of Delaware law and our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may 
have an anti-takeover effect and may delay, defer, or prevent a maga, acquisition. tender offer, takeover attempt. or other change of control 
transaction that a stockholder might consider in its best interest, including those attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for 
the shares held by our stockholders.
