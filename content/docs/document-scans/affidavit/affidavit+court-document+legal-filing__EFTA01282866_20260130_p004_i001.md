Special Statement for 
Uncovered Option Writers

There are special risks associated with uncovered option writing which expose the investor to potentially significant loss. I understand 
that this type of strategy may not be suitable for all customers approved for options transactions. I also understand each of the 
following 
1. The potential loss of uncovered can writing is unlimited, since there is no upper limit on a stock's price and the loss to a writer of 
an uncovered call equals the stock price minus the exercise price. The writer of an uncovered call is in an extremely risky 
position, and may incur large losses if the value of the underlying instrument increases above the exercise price. Such a loss can 
exceed the equity in the call writer's account. 
2. The potential loss from writing uncovered put options is also substantial. The writer of an uncovered put option bears a risk of 
loss if the value of the underlying instrument declines below the exercise price. However. since stock prices cannot be lower than 
zero, the maximum loss is equal to the strike price of the put sold less the premium received for that put. Such toss could be 
substantial if there is a significant decline in the value of the underlying instrument and can exceed the equity in the put writer's 
account. 
3. For combination writing, where the investor wntes both a put and a call on the same underlying instrument, the potential risk is 
unlimited and can exceed the equity in the option writer's account. 
4. Uncovered option writing is thus suitable only for the knowledgeable investor who understands the risks, has the financial capacity 
and willingness to incur potentially substantial losses, and has sufficient liquid assets to meet applicable margin requirements. In 
this regard. if the value of the underlying instrument moves against an uncovered writer's options position, the investor's broker 
may request significant additional margin payments. It an investor does not make such margin payments, the broker may liquidate 
stock or options positions in the investor's account, with little or no prior notice in accordance with the investor's margin 
agreement. 
b. The option writer may not be able to rely on the secondary market. If a secondary market in options were to become unavailable, 
investors could not engage in closing transactions, and an option writer would remain obligated until expiration or assignment. 
6. The writer of an American-style option is subject to being assigned an exercise at any time after fie has written the option until 
the option expires. By contrast, the writer of a European-style option is subject to exercise assignment only during the exercise 
period.
