calendar year end you were able to withdraw 25% of a particular tranche whose soft lock had 
expired in that calendar year, rather than being able to withdraw the remainder of this investment 
tranche over the next three quarters, the reset provisions allows the partnership to further limit 
your withdrawals of the balance of that tranche, so that you can then only withdraw 25% of that 
balance per quarter over the next 4 quarters. Thus, it appears that the reset turns a 100% 
withdrawal of your investment tranche, which would occur over 4 quarters, to one which will 
take 5 quarters to complete. It is a little unclear in the PPM, so I would need to read the limited 
partnership Agreement to make sure. 
In addition to the foregoing limitations, the PPM states that withdrawals or payments 
of withdrawals may be suspended or postponed by the General Partner of the 
Partnership during the times when the Master Fund is not permitting withdrawals by 
Feeder Funds, which can occur under a broad set of circumstances. The Master Fund 
may suspend withdrawals by Feeder Funds or postpone the payment date of those 
withdrawals for any period during which: (1) any stock exchange or over-the-counter 
market on which a substantial part of the investments of the Master Fund are traded is 
closed or trading is restricted or suspended, (2) there is a state of affairs that 
constitutes a state of emergency as a result of which disposal of the Master Fund's 
investments is not reasonably practicable, or it is not reasonable practicable to 
determine fairly the value of the Master Fund's assets, (3) a breakdown occurs in any of 
the means normally employed in ascertaining the value of a substantial part of the 
Master Fund's assets or when for any other reason the value of such assets cannot 
reasonably be ascertained, or (4) there exist such other extraordinary circumstances, 
as determined in good faith by the Master Fund's General Partner, that cause 
withdrawals or such payments to be impracticable under existing economic or market 
conditions or conditions relating to the Master Fund. As you can see, this is a fairly 
broad power granted to the Master Fund (reminiscent of the DB Zwirn investment). 
Subject to the limitations above, payments of withdrawals of less than 80% of a 
particular sub-capital account generally will be paid in full within 30 days after the 
withdrawal date. If a withdrawal is satisfied through the liquidation of a representative 
pool of the Master Fund's positions, the proceeds of such liquidation will generally be 
paid in full within 30 days following the completion of the liquidation of such pool. 
Where there is a request to withdraw 80% or more of a sub-capital account, there is a 
holdback pending the completion of the Partnership's annual audit. The holdback is up 
to 10% of the withdrawal proceeds, which will ultimately be paid within 30 days 
following delivery to the Partnership of the audit for the year in which the withdrawal 
occurs. 
Any assignment of Class S Interests requires the General Partner's prior consent. 
The following reports are to be provided to the limited partners: (1) a weekly estimate 
of the Partnership's Net Asset Value, "generally within two (2) days of the end of each 
week", (2) a monthly estimate of the Partnership's Net Asset Value, "generally within 
five (5) business days of the end of each month", (3) a final monthly Net Asset Value,
