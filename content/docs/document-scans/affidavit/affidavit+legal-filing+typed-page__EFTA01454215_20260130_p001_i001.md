carrier's platform. 
A disadvantage is that the advisor would have to get 
the IDF added to the carrier's platform. In addition, the 
administrative costs of the custom 1DF usually make this 
approach feasible only at levels over $20 million. And, if 
the investor elects to allow others to invest in his IDF, it 
could limit his ability to change the mandate. 
As with any discussion of private placement, we 
should pause to consider the investor control doctrine. 
While an investor can design the broad allocation. 
select specific asset classes or themes for focus and 
even hire a specific manager, the investor should be 
certain not to participate (directly or indirectly) in 
security selection. 
Bottom Line 
It's broadly accepted in the wealth management and 
financial planning communities that certain asset class-
es offer a greater benefit from the tax deferral or 
tax-exemption features of private placement insurance 
vehicles. We've explored how best to measure the rela-
tive long-term tax deferral benefit of various asset classes 
and, in the process, have debunked some broadly held 
misconceptions. 
The TDM or TEM, is perhaps the best measure of 
tax deferral benefit. It incorporates return, turnover and 
the compounding effect of tax deferral when comparing 
asset classes. It can be used to execute a variety of asset 
location strategies, each of which has its own advantages 
and disadvantages. 
As with all investments, execution is key. We
 shown 
several ways to build and execute an optimal private place-
ment portfolio. In all cases, it's essential that an investor 
partner with an advisor with specific expertise in private 
placement structures, asset location and proven invest-
ment acumen to ensure that the portfolio is constructed 
with the goal of achieving the maximum future value.
