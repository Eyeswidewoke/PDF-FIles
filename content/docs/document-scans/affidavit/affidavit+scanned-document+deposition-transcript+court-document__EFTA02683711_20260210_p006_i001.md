or other immediately available account in a bank or similar financial institution on the date the 
redemption notice is sent to Holder.

however that the Company shall not be obligated to deliver any portion of such redemption 
price unless either the certificates evidencing the Debentures redeemed are delivered to the 
Company or its transfer agent as provided in Section 3(b), or the Holder notifies the Company or 
its transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and executes an 
agreement satisfactory to the Company to indemnify the Company from any loss incurred by it in 
connection with such certificates.
