We may experience software defects, computer viruses, and development delays, which could damage client relations, our potential profitability 
and expose us to liability. 
Our products are based on sophisticated software and computing systems that often encounter development delays. and the underlying 
software may contain undetected errors, viruses, or defects. Defects in our software products and errors or delays in our processing of electronic 
transactions could result in additional development costs, diversion of technical and other resources from our other development efforts, loss of 
credibility with current or potential clients, harm to our reputation, fines imposed by card networks, or exposure to liability claims. In addition, we 
rely on technologies supplied to us by third parties that may also contain undetected errors. viruses or defects that could have a material adverse 
effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Although we attempt to limit our potential liability for warranty claims through 
disclaimers in our software documentation and limitation-of-liability provisions in our license and other agreements with our clients, we cannot 
assure that these measures will be successful in limiting our liability. 
Our merchants may be unable to satisfy obligations for which we may also be liable. 
We are subject to the risk of our merchants being unable to sandy obligations for which we may also be liable. For example. we and 
our merchants acquiring alliances may be subject to contingent liability for transactions originally acquired by us that are disputed by the 
cardholder and charged back to the merchants. If we or the alliance is unable to collect this amount from the merchant because of the merchant's 
insolvency or other reasons, we or the alliance will bear the loss for the amount of the refund paid to the cardholder. We have an active program to 
manage our credit risk and often mitigate our risk by obtaining collateral. it is possible, however, that a default on such obligations by one or more 
of our merchants could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
Fraud by merchants or others could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
We may be subject to potential liability for fraudulent electronic payment transactions or credits initiated by merchants or others. 
Examples of merchant fraud include when a merchant or other party knowingly uses a stolen or counterfeit credit, debit or prepaid card, card 
number, or other credentials to record a false sales transaction. processes an invalid card. or intentionally fails to deliver the merchandise or 
services sold in an otherwise valid transaction. Criminals are using increasingly sophisticated methods to engage in illegal activities such as 
counterfeiting and fraud. It is possible that incidents of fraud could increase in the future. Failure to effectively manage risk and prevent fraud 
would increase our chargeback liability or other liability. Increases in chargebacks or other liability could have a material adverse effmt on our 
business. financial condition. and results of operations. 
Future consolidation offinancial institution clients or other client groups may adversely affed our financial condition. 
In recent years. we have been negatively affected by the substantial consolidation in the bank industry. Bank industry consolidation 
affects existing and potential clients in our service areas, primarily in Global Business Solutions and Global Financial Solutions. Our alliance 
strategy could also be negatively affected by consolidations, especially where the banks involved are committed to their internal merchant 
processing businesses that compete with us. Bank consolidation has led to an increasingly concentrated client base, resulting in a changing client 
mix for Global Financial Solutions as well as increased price compression. Further consolidation in the bank industry or other client base could 
have a negative impact on us. including a loss of revenue and price compression.
