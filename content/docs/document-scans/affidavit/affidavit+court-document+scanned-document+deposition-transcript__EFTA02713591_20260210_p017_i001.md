5.3 
Retirement of a General Partner. 
(a) 
Retirement of a General Partner shall not dissolve the Partnership, unless 
such General Partner was the sole remaining General Partner, in which case, the Partnership shall 
be dissolved as of the effective date of such retirement. Retirement of a General Partner shall not 
relieve it of any obligations or liabilities incurred as a General Partner during the term of its 
membership in the Partnership as a General Partner. 
(b) 
The General Partner may voluntarily retire from the Partnership at any 
time by the giving of at least thirty (30) days prior written notice of retirement to the Partnership 
(subject to the waiver or reduction of such notice requirement). The Partnership interest of the 
retiring General Partner shall remain at the risk of the Partnership's business and the business of 
the Partnership shall be conducted until the effective date thereof as though no such event had 
occurred. Subject to Section 4.4 above, within thirty (30) days following the effective date 
thereof there shall be paid to such General Partner, or the legal representatives of such General 
Partner, an amount equal to (i) at least ninety percent (90%) of the Liquidating Share of such 
General Partner, net of any accrued expenses through the Withdrawal Date, with the balance 
settled no later than thirty (30) days after completion of the next audit of the Partnership's books, 
subject to the reserve referred to in Section 5.5 below; and (ii) any unallocated or undistributed 
Incentive Allocation due to the General Partner. 
5.4 
Liquidating Share. The term "Liquidating Share", when used with respect 
to any retiring Partner as of a Withdrawal Date, shall mean the closing Capital Account of such 
Partner as of such Withdrawal Date. 
5.5 
Reserve Against Withdrawal and Liquidating Share. The General Partner 
may withhold, as a reserve, from any distribution to be payable to a withdrawing or retiring 
Partner, such Partner's pro rata share of any liabilities or contingencies (whether or not such 
reserve is required under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles), as well as any amounts 
payable to taxing authorities (which have not been previously charged as liabilities). Any such 
reserve shall be held in a separate account and shall be adjusted from time to time as the General 
Partner considers reasonable, until the General Partner determines that such reserve (or the 
balance thereof) is no longer advisable or required, and at such time, the remaining balance in 
such account shall be forwarded to the withdrawing or retiring Partner. 
5.6 
Involuntary Withdrawal or Retirement. The General Partner may, in its 
sole discretion, terminate the interest of any Limited Partner in the Partnership in whole or in 
part for any reason and at any time upon at least two (2) days' prior written notice. Such 
involuntarily withdrawing or retiring Partner shall receive at least ninety percent (90%) of his 
Liquidating Share pursuant to the provisions of this ARTICLE V (or portion thereof 
involuntarily withdrawn) no later than thirty (30) days after the date of withdrawal or retirement 
(as applicable) net of any Incentive Allocation and any accrued expenses through the Withdrawal 
Date and subject to the reserve referred to in Section 5.5 above, with the balance settled without 
interest within thirty (30) days after completion of the audit of the Partnership's books for the 
year during which such withdrawal or retirement took place, subject to the reserve referred to in 
Section 5.5 above; and, in the case of a retirement, such involuntarily retiring Partner shall be 
deemed to have retired from the Partnership as of such date of retirement. Distributions may be
