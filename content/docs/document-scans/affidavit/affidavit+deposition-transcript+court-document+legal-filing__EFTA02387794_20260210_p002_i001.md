Hi George, 
Here's some background on the company, for yo= and your advisers. When we started in January of 2010, we 
raised $100,000 =rom three investors for Acron Cell LLC. As you may recall, I dissolved the =riginal company, Acron Cell 
LLC, and sold the assets to a new Florida compa=y called Androcyte LLC, in 2011. Parijata "Jata" Mackey and I took over 
tha= company's management, although Jata is no longer involved. We had 3 origin=l investors in Acron Cell which were 
allowed to move their ownership percen=ages to Androcyte. One of those investors, Life Extension Foundation, has p=t 
$215,000 in total into the Company, and Zasis LLC (owned/managed by Gary Hirst) has put about=$340,000 into 
Androcyte, since the beginning. For about one year, Jata and = each had a salary of about $60,000 each, but that ended 
in October of 2012=and there have been no salaries since then, only living expenses (modest ho=sing, food, utilities, and 
travel) The bulk of the funding was used in 2011=- 2012 to pay for travel to Europe to collect blood samples and to 
negotiat= a grant and loan from the Spanish government to move the business to their=Andalusian biotechnology center 
at Isla de la Ca=tuja <http://www.archdaily.com/428600/andalusian-institute-of-biotechnol=gy-sol89/> , outside Seville. 
Setting up the Spanish subsidiary and applying f=r the grants/loans took about three months, and cost us about $30,000. 
Alth=ugh we were told we'd get both, the collapse of the Spanish economy fouled =his from happening. We then 
sequenced the first three genomes for $20,000 a=iece, and in 2012 sequenced another 12 genomes for $8,000 apiece 
(both sets=were contracted through Knome). I spent the Summer of 2013 in Arlington, MA=working on analyzing this 
genomic data on both Knome's and Ingenuity's Vari=nt Analysis platforms. 
I'll pull together ou= existing shareholder list, if you'd like it. You were given 2% of the comp=ny's initial stock 
and the other four advisers were given 1 percent each.1=ta now is a 2% "adviser" rather than an employee/manager. 
Everyone, i=cluding these investors and myself, all have dilutable ownership units</=> of Androcyte Lit. All investments 
have been made on a Pre-money Valuation<=a> basis and represent whatever valuation we've agreed to with the 
investor= Previously (2012 and 2013) our valuation has been $2,500,000. That's also =he amount I quoted the potential 
investor with whom I've been negotiating r=cently. Because there's much more to be gained by having you as an 
investor= I promised you a valuation of $2,000,000. If we receive your investment, t=en I'll tell the other guy that we're 
no longer seeking funds, but I'll kee= in touch with him regarding future investment opportunities. Hopefully wit= the 
new analysis and adding to our samples and genomic data, our valuation=will increase significantly. As previously 
offered, I'm happy to have you h=lp make such decisions in the future. chttp://en.=ikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-
money_valuation> 
Please let m= know if you have any questions. I attaching copies of our 2011 and 2012 ta= returns, but the 2013 
tax return hasn't been completed yet. One of the use= of new funds is to pay about $4,000 to have them done. 
Best regards, 
James
