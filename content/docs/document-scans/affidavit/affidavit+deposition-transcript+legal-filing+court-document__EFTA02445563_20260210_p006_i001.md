granting parole," 18 U.S.C. § 4203(bX2), and because actions of the Parole Commission taken 
pursuant to this authorization are "committed to agency discretion for purposes of 5 U.S.C. § 
70I(aX2)," 18 U.S.C. § 4218(d), they arc insulated from judicial review.' See Garcia v. Neagle, 
660 F.2d 983, 988-89 (4th Cir.1981); Hackett v. U.S. Parole Comm'n, 851 F.2d 127, 129 (6th 
Cir.I987) ("The federal court's scope of review over a decision by the Parole Commission is 
extremely limited"). "In general, [however,] even where action is committed to absolute agency 
discretion by law, courts have assumed the power to review allegations that an agency exceeded 
its legal authority, acted unconstitutionally, or failed to follow its own regulations." Garcia, 660 
F.2d at 988. Thus, our review of actions of the Parole Commission is limited to claims that it has 
violated "constitutional, statutory, regulatory, or other restrictions, [and we] may not review 
[Commission] action where the challenge is only to the decision itself." Id. 
Recognizing that the Parole Commission has broad authority to impose reasonable conditions on 
his parole, Kennedy argues nevertheless that the Parole Commission's order for him to register 
as a sex offender was unreasonable because (I) the order was premised on an incorrect 
interpretation of SORNA; (2) "Mr. Kennedy was unable to lawfully register under the terms of 
the Maryland state registry, and in turn, unable to lawfully comply with the Parole Commission's 
Order"; and (3) the order "violated the Tenth Amendment by commandeering the State of 
Maryland to register Mr. Kennedy in violation of its own state law."' We address these 
arguments in order. 
A 
To begin, although Kennedy contends that the special parole condition requiring him to register in 
Maryland was based on an incorrect interpretation of SORNA, it is unclear whether this claim 
even falls within the scope of review permitted by 5 U.S.C. § 701(aX2). See Garcia, 660 F.2d at 
988. Moreover, even if this claim were reviewable, it would fail on the merits, as it remains clear 
that SORNA imposes a federal duty on sex offenders to register "in each jurisdiction where the 
offender resides, where the offender is an employee, and where the offender is a student." 42 
U.S.C. § 16913(a); see also Applicability of the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act, 
72 Fed.Reg. 8894, 8895 (Feb. 28, 2007) ("SORNA directly imposes registration obligations on 
sex offenders as a matter of federal law ."). SORNA further vests the Attorney General with 
"the authority to specify the applicability of the requirements of this subchapter to sex offenders 
convicted before July 27, 2006 or its implementation in a particular jurisdiction," 42 U.S.C. § 
16913(d), and the Attorney General has done so, specifying that SORNA applies "to all sex 
offenders, including sex offenders convicted of the offense for which registration is required 
prior to the enactment of that Act," 28 C.F.R. § 72.3. As Kennedy was convicted of rape and 
murder in 1980, he qualifies as a sex offender under 42 U.S.C. § 16911(1), (5), and thus he was 
required by SORNA to register in Maryland, his state of residence. 
Notwithstanding this unambiguous directive of federal law, Kennedy contends that because he 
was unable to "initially register," consistent with 42 U.S.C. § 169 I3(b)(1), a provision that 
requires sex offenders to "initially register . before completing a sentence of imprisonment with 
respect to the offense giving rise to the registration requirement," he is relieved of any duty to 
comply with SORNA until the Act is implemented in Maryland. As support for this proposition, 
he relies on guidelines published by the Department of Justice, sec The National Guidelines for 
Sex Offender Registration and Notification ("National Guidelines"), 73 Fed.Reg. 38,030, 38,063
