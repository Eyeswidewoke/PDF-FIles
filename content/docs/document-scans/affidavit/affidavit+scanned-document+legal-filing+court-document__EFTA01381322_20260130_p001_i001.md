Form S-I 
Table of Contrail 
Conflicts of Interest 
Delaware law permits corporations to adopt provisions renouncing any interest or expectancy in certain opportunities that are presented to 
the corporation or its officers, directors or stockholder. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will, to the maximum extent 
permitted from time to time by Delaware law. renounce any interest or expectancy that we have in, or right to be offered an opportunity to 
participate in. specified business opportunities that arc from time to time presented to our officers, directors or stockholders or their respective 
affiliates, other than those officers, directors, stockholders or affiliates who are our or our subsidiaries' employees. Our amended and restated 
certificate of incorporation will provide that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, none of our Sponsor or any of its affiliates or any director who 
is not employed by us (including any non-employee director who serves as one of our officers in both his director and officer capacities) or his or 
her affiliates will have any duty to refrain from (1) engaging in a corporate opportunity in the same or similar lints of business in which we or our 
affiliates now engage or propose to engage or (2) otherwise competing with us or our affiliates. In addition, to the fullest extent permitted by law, in 
the event that our Sponsor or any non-employee director acquires knowledge of a potential transaction or other business opportunity which may be 
a corporate opportunity for itself or himself or its or his affiliates or for us or our affiliates, such person will have no duty to communicate or offer 
such transaction or business opportunity to us or any of our affiliates and they may take any such opportunity for themselves or offer it to another 
person or entity. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will not renounce our interest in any business opportunity that is expressly 
offered to a non-employee director solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the Company. To the fullest extent permitted by law, no 
business opportunity will be deemed to be a potential corporate opportunity for us unless we would be permitted. to undertake the opportunity 
under our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, we have sufficient financial resources to undertake the opportunity and the opportunity 
would be in line with our business. 
Limitations on Liability and Indemnification of Officers and Directors 
The DGCL authorizes corporations to limit or eliminate the personal liability of directors to corporations and their stockholders for 
monetary damages for breaches of directors' fiduciary duties. subject to certain exceptions. Our amen dal and restated certificate of incorporation 
will include a provision that eliminates the personal liability of directors for monetary damages for any breach of fiduciary duty as a director, 
except to the extent such exemption from liability or limitation thereof is not permitted under the DGCL. The effect of these provisions will be to 
eliminate the rights of us and our stockholder. through stockholders' derivative suits on our behalf, to recover monetary damages from a director 
for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, including breaches resulting from grossly negligent behavior. However, exculpation will not apply to any 
director if the director has acted in bad faith, knowingly or intentionally violated the law, authorized illegal dividends or redemptions or derived an 
improper benefit from his or her actions as a director. 
Our amended and restated bylaws will provide that we must indemnify and advance expenses to our directors and officers to the fullest 
extent authorized by the DGCL. We also will be expressly authorized to carry directors' and officers' liability insurance providing indemnification 
for our directors. officers and certain employees for some liabilities. We believe that these indemnification and advancement provisions and 
insurance will be useful to attract and retain qualified directors and officers. 
The limitation of liability, indemnification and advancement provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and 
amended and restated bylaws may discourage stockholders from bringing a lawsuit against directors for breach of their fiduciary duty. These 
provisions also may have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against directors and officers, even though such an action, if 
successful, might otherwise benefit us and our stockholders. In addition, your investment may be adversely affected to the extent we pay the ends 
of settlement and damage awards against directors and officers pursuant to these indemnification provisions. 
There is currently no pending material litigation or proceeding involving any of our directors, officers or employees for which 
indemnification is sought.
