Amendment No. 3 to Form S-1 
Table of Contents 
However, dividends that are effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business by the non-U.S. holder within the United 
States are generally not subject to the United States federal withholding tax, provided certain certification and disclosure requirements 
are satisfied. Instead, such dividends are subject to United States federal income tax on a net income basis in generally the same 
manner as if the non-U.S. holder were a United States person as defined under the Code, unless an applicable income tax treaty 
provides otherwise. Any such effectively connected dividends received by a foreign corporation may be subject to an additional 'branch 
profits tax" at a 30% rate or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty, on its effectively connected earnings 
and profits, subject to adjustments. 
A non-U.S. holder of our common stock who wishes to claim the benefit of an applicable treaty rate and avoid backup withholding, 
as discussed below, for dividends will be required (a) to complete the applicable Internal Revenue Service Form W-8 and certify under 
penalty of perjury that such holder is not a United States person as defined under the Code and is eligible for treaty benefits or (b) if our 
common stock is held through certain foreign intermediaries, to satisfy the relevant certification requirements of applicable United States 
Treasury regulations. Special certification and other requirements apply to certain non-U.S. holders that are pass-through entities rather 
than corporations or individuals. 
A non-U.S. holder of our common stock eligible for a reduced rate of United States withholding tax pursuant to an income tax 
treaty may obtain a refund of any excess amounts withheld by timely filing an appropriate claim for refund with the Internal Revenue 
Service. 
Gain on Disposition of Common Stock 
Subject to the discussion of backup withholding and FATCA below, any gain realized on the sale, exchange or other taxable 
disposition of our common stock generally will not be subject to United States federal income or withholding tax unless: 
• the gain is effectively connected with a trade or business of the non-U.S. holder in the United States: 
• the non-U.S. holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of that 
disposition, and certain other conditions are met: or 
• we are or have been a "United States real property holding corporation" for United States federal income tax purposes. 
A non-U.S. holder described in the first bullet point immediately above will be subject to United States federal income tax on the 
net gain derived from the disposition on a net income basis in generally the same manner as if the non-U.S. holder were a United States 
person as defined under the Code, unless an applicable income tax treaty provides otherwise. If a non-U.S. holder that is a foreign 
corporation falls under the first bullet point immediately above, it may also be subject to the branch profits tax equal to 30% (or such 
lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty) of its effectively connected earnings and profits, subject to 
adjustments. 
Unless an applicable income tax treaty provides otherwise, an individual non-U.S. holder described in the second bullet point 
immediately above will be subject to a flat 30% United States federal income tax on the gain derived from the disposition, which may be 
offset by United States source capital losses, even though the individual is not considered a resident of the United States. 
We believe we are not and do not anticipate becoming a "United States real property holding corporation" for United States federal 
income tax purposes. However, even if we become a "United States real property holding corporation: if our common stock is 
considered to be regularly traded on
