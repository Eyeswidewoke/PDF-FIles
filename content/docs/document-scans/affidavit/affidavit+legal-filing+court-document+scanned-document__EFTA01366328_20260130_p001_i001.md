with entities engaged in business activities similar to those intended to be conducted by us and, accordingly, 
may have conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be 
presented. 
Following the completion of this offering and until we consummate our initial business combination, we 
intend to engage in the business of identifying and combining with one or more businesses. Our sponsor and 
executive officers and directors are, or may in the future become, affiliated with entities that arc engaged in a 
similar business. 
Our officers, directors and director nominees also may become aware of business opportunities which may be 
appropriate for presentation to us and the other entities to which they owe certain fiduciary or contractual duties. 
Accordingly, they may have conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity 
should be presented. These conflicts may not be resolved in our favor and a potential target business may be 
presented to another entity prior to its presentation to us Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation 
will provide that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director unless such 
opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company 
and such opportunity is one we arc legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be 
reasonable for us to pursue.

engaging for their own account in business activities of the types conducted by us. Accordingly, such persons or 
entities may have a conflict between their interests and ours.

entities that may be affiliated with our executive officers, directors or existing holders which may raise 
potential conflicts of interest. 
In light of the involvement of our sponsor. execur 
officers and directors with other entities. we may decide 
to acquire one or more businesses affiliated with our sponsor. executive officers and directors. Our directors also 
serve as officers and board members for other entities, including, without limitation, those described under 
"Management—Conflicts of Interest" Such entities may compete with us for business combination opportunities.

business combination with any entities with which they are affiliated, and there have been no preliminary 
discussions concerning a business combination with any such entity or entities. Although we will not be
