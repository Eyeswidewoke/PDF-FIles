HUBUS133 Alpha Group Capital 
However, there are no material limitations on the instruments, strategies, markets or 
countries in which the Multi-Strategy Funds may invest. The strategies in which the 
Multi-Strat Funds invest are constantly evolving and new strategies may appear within 
the Multi-Strat Funds' portfolio with some regularity. 
Side Letters 
The Multi-Strat Funds and, in certain cases, Hudson Bay Capital, have the discretion to 
waive or modify the application of, or grant special or more favorable rights with respect 
to, the terms or provisions applicable to investment in the Multi-Strat Funds to the extent 
permitted by applicable law and have done so. Such terms may relate to certain 
withdrawal rights, fees, portfolio level information rights or different participation in 
profits and losses of certain securities ("Favorable Terms"), or other matters. To effect 
such waivers or modifications or the grant of any special or more Favorable Terms or any 
other terms, the Multi-Strat Funds or Hudson Bay Capital, as applicable, may create 
additional classes, sub-classes, tranches or series of interests and enter into side letter 
agreements without notice to, or consent of, other investors that provide for these 
differing rights. Although certain investors may invest with different material terms, the 
Multi-Strat Funds and Hudson Bay Capital will only offer such terms if they believe 
other investors will not be materially disadvantaged. Favorable Terms granted to certain 
investors (other than current and former members and employees of Hudson Bay Capital, 
their family members and/or related entities) will be offered to all existing investors with 
an equal or greater investment in the Multi-Strat Funds; provided that (i) such terms or 
conditions were not offered based on an investor's special regulatory, tax or other 
particular status; and (ii) an investor electing to accept such favorable terms or conditions 
also agrees to be bound by any conditions, restrictions, limitations or obligations imposed 
on an investor in connection with its investment in the Multi-Strat Funds. Other rights 
and investment terms that do not constitute Favorable Terms may not be offered to such 
other existing investors. 
Individual Investor Investment Restrictions 
Certain investors ("SRI Investors") that are subject to a "socially responsible" or similar 
investment mandate which precludes them from participating in profits or losses 
attributable to certain securities and other instruments ("Restricted Investments") of 
companies ("Restricted Companies") have entered into side letter agreements with the 
Offshore Fund and Hudson Bay Capital (and may enter into similar relationships in the 
future with the other Feeder Funds, including the Offshore Fund) whereby Hudson Bay 
Capital uses what it believes to be reasonable efforts to allocate profits and losses 
attributable to such Restricted Companies away from the SRI Investors' shares (the "SRI 
Shares") and to other investors ("non-SRI Investors") who are not SRI Investors (the 
"Restricted Investment Reallocation"). In cases where a single investment thesis or idea 
is manifested through a group of positions, including related hedges, one of which is an 
investment in a Restricted Company, as a general matter, Hudson Bay Capital will treat 
the entire group of investments as a Restricted Investment even if certain of the positions 
in the group are not securities or other instruments of Restricted Companies. In certain 
cases, where this general rule results in outcomes Hudson Bay Capital deems suboptimal,
