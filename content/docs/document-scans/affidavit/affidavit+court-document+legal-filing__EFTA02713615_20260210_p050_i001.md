Classification of the Partnership 
Under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and the 
Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Regulations"), as in effect on the date of 
this Memorandum, including the "check the box" entity classification Regulations, so long as the 
Partnership complies with the Limited Partnership Agreement, the Partnership should be 
classified for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a partnership and not as an association taxable 
as a corporation. If it were determined that the Partnership should be classified as an association 
taxable as a corporation (as a result of changed interpretations or administrative positions by the 
Internal Revenue Service (the "Service") or otherwise), the taxable income of the Partnership 
would be subject to corporate income taxation when recognized by the Partnership, and 
distributions from the Partnership to the Partners, other than in certain redemptions of Interests in 
the Partnership, would be treated as dividend income when received by the Partners to the extent 
of the current or accumulated earnings and profits of the Partnership. 
Even with the "check the box" Regulations, certain partnerships may be taxable as 
corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes under the publicly traded partnership ("PTP") 
rules set forth in the Code and the Regulations. Interests in the Partnership will not be traded on 
an established securities market and will be offered only in transactions that are not required to 
be registered under the Securities Act. Under the private placement safe harbor set forth in the 
PTP Regulations, Interests in the Partnership will not be considered to be readily tradable on a 
secondary market or the substantial equivalent of a secondary market and thus the Partnership 
will not be classified as a PTP if: 
all Interests in the Partnership are issued in a transaction (or transactions) that is 
not required to be registered under the Securities Act; and 
the Partnership does not have more than 100 partners at any time during the 
taxable year of the Partnership (counting each beneficial owner of a partnership, grantor 
trust or S corporation (a "flow-through entity") as a partner if substantially all of the 
value of such owner's interest in the flow-through entity is attributable to the flow-
through entity's interest (direct or indirect) in the Partnership and a "principal purpose" 
of the use of a tiered arrangement is to permit the Partnership to satisfy the above-
mentioned 100-partner limitation). 
In the event that the Partnership has more than 100 partners it will not satisfy the 100-
partner safe harbor. The Partnership believes that, even if it does not satisfy a safe harbor, it 
would not be determined to be publicly traded under a facts and circumstances test and that even 
it were determined that the Partnership was a publicly traded partnership, the Partnership might 
be entitled to rely upon an exemption from treatment as a corporation for federal income tax 
purposes if 90% or more of the Partnership's gross income consisted of passive type "qualifying 
income." There can be no assurance, however, that the Partnership will be able to meet the 
conditions of an exemption. 
It is assumed in the following discussion of tax considerations that the Partnership will be 
taxed as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
