(a) 
In connection with any registration filed pursuant hereto, the 
Company shall use its best efforts to cause the Registration Statement to become effective 
as promptly as possible. Following the effective date of a Registration Statement, the 
Company shall, upon the request of the Investor, forthwith supply such reasonable 
number of copies of the Registration Statement (including, without limitation, the 
exhibits and schedules thereto), preliminary prospectus and prospectus meeting the 
requirements of the Securities Act (including, without limitation, any and all 
amendments or supplements thereto), and other documents necessary or incidental to 
the public offering of the Registrable Securities, as shall be reasonably requested by the 
Investor to permit the Investor to sell, distribute or otherwise dispose of the Investor's 
Registrable Securities. The obligations of the Company hereunder with respect to the 
Investor's beneficially owned Registrable Securities are subject to the Investor's 
furnishing to the Company such appropriate information concerning the Investor, the 
Investor's Registrable Securities and the terms of the Investor's offering of such 
Registrable Securities as the Company may reasonably request in writing. 
(b) 
The Company shall provide the Investor, any underwriter 
participating in any disposition pursuant to a Registration Statement, and any attorney, 
accountant or other agent retained by the Investor or underwriter (each, an "Inspector"
and, collectively, the "Inspectors"), the opportunity to review and comment (including 
reviewing and commenting on relevant documents and agreements) in the preparation of 
such Registration Statement, each prospectus included therein or filed with the 
Commission and each amendment or supplement thereto. 
(c) 
For a reasonable period prior to the filing of any Registration 
Statement pursuant to this Agreement, the Company shall make available for inspection 
at the Company's offices and copying by the Inspectors such financial and other 
information and books and records, pertinent corporate documents and properties of the 
Company and its subsidiaries and cause the officers, directors, employees, counsel and 
independent certified public accountants of the Company and its subsidiaries to respond 
to such inquiries and to supply all information reasonably requested by any such 
Inspector in connection with such Registration Statement, as shall be reasonably 
necessary, in the judgment of the respective counsel, to conduct a reasonable 
investigation within the meaning of the Securities Act. 
(d) 
The Company shall promptly notify in writing the Investor, the 
sales or placement agent, if any, therefor and the managing underwriter of the securities 
being sold, (i) when such Registration Statement or the prospectus included therein or 
any prospectus amendment or supplement or post-effective amendment has been filed, 
and, with respect to any such Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment, 
when the same has become effective, (ii) when the Commission notifies the Company 
whether there will be a "review" of such Registration Statement, (iii) of any comments 
(oral or written) by the Commission and by the blue sky or securities commissioner or 
regulator of any state with respect thereto or (iv) of any request by the Commission for 
any amendments or supplements to such Registration Statement or the prospectus or for 
additional information.
