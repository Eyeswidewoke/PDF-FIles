Important information 
ANNUAL MARGIN DISCLOSURE 
Securities purchased on margin are the firm's collateral for the loan to you. If the securities in your account decline in value, so does the value of the collateral supporting your loan. As a 
result, the firm can take action, such as issuing a margin call and/or selling securities or other assets in any of your accounts held with TD Ameritrade, in order to maintain the required 
equity in the account. 
It is important that you fully understand the risks involved in trading securities on margin. These risks include the following: You can lose more funds than you deposit in 
the margin account. The firm can force the sale of securities or other assets in your account(s). The firm can sell your securities or other assets without contacting you. 
You are not entitled to choose which securities or other assets in your account(s) are liquidated or sold to meet a margin call. The firm can increase its "house" 
maintenance requirements at any time and is not required to provide you advance written notice. You are not entitled to an extension of time on a margin call.

ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING REQUIREMENTS 
The USA PATRIOT Act is designed to detect, deter, and punish terrorists and/or terrorist groups in the United States and abroad. The Act requires U.S. financial institutions and 
brokerage firms to implement comprehensive anti-money laundering programs. 
What is money laundering? 
Money laundering is the process of disguising illegally obtained funds so that they appear to come from legitimate sources or activities. Money laundering occurs in connection with a 
wide variety of crimes, including (but not limited to) illegal arms sales, drug trafficking, fraud, terrorism, embezzlement, and political corruption. 
How big is the problem and why is it important? 
According to the U.S. Department of State. one recent estimate puts the amount of worldwide money laundering activity at roughly $1 trillion per year. The use of the U.S. financial 
system by criminals to facilitate terrorism or other crimes could taint our financial markets.
