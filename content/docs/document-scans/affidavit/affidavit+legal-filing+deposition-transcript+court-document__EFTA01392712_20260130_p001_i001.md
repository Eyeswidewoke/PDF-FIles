Important Information 
To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities. Federal law requires all financial 
institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who establishes an account, investment or 
other business relationship with a financial institution. This means that we will ask for your name, address. and other 
information that will allow us to identify you. We may also ask to see identifying documents such as a certificate of 
formation or good standing (legal entities) or a passport or other photo identification (individuals). 
3rd EU Notice 
Governmental rules have also broadened the scope of the Bank's obligations to aid in the fight against money laundering 
and tenorist financing; these rules call for an active involvement of both asset management firms and their clients. For 
new and existing clients we currently have a legal obligation to ask our customers questions regarding their identities. 
addresses, source of funds and, if necessary. legal representatives, authorized signatories. beneficial owners or control 
structures and to collect requisite documentation to substantiate the information. Also, enhanced anti-money laundering 
requirements require that should any of the above personal or institutional information change. our clients would be 
obliged to immediately notify us of the change(s) and provide us with relevant documentation to verify these changes.
