questions are compatible with the victim's current mental image. For instance, if the interviewer 
needs to learn about the rapist's knife, but the victim is currently thinking about the rapist's odor, 
then the interviewer should defer asking about the knife until the victim is thinking about the 
knife. 
Witness-compatible questioning is probably the most difficult aspect of the CI to learn, as it 
requires the interviewer to defer to the victim and to be aware of the victim's changing thoughts 
during the course of the interview. Sensitivity to the victim's thoughts, however, should make 
the task easier for the victim, and in the process also confer more control to the victim, since 
her/his thoughts will direct the course of the interview rather than be subjugated to the 
interviewer's needs. Structuring the interview around the victim's recollections, rather than 
proceeding in a predetermined sequence, should also confer a sense of dignity to the victim, as it 
makes clear that the interviewer is listening to the victim and that the victim plays a more central 
role in the interview process. 
Multiple Retrieval. The more often people search through their memories about an event, the 
more new details they will recall. Interviewers can enhance witness recollection by asking 
witnesses to describe the critical event several times within the interview, and interviewing them 
more than once. Interviewers should make use of the fact that victims will continue to think 
about the crime even after the interview has terminated—and thereby recall new details—by 
contacting the victim after the interview to learn about any such post-interview recollections and 
to inquire about the victim's emotional health. Such a post-interview follow-up should help to 
reassure the victim of the interviewer's concern about the victim as a person and not merely as a 
fact generator, which should help contribute toward the victim's perceived dignity. These post-
interview contacts are particularly important to combat victims' feelings of isolation, and 
especially for victims who do not have well formed social networks to rely on. 
Accuracy of Responding. Witnesses will recall more accurately if they communicate only those 
recollections they are certain of and refrain from guessing (Koriat & Goldsmith, 1996). 
Interviewers should therefore explicitly instruct witnesses not to guess, but, instead, to indicate 
that they "don't know." Similarly, interviewers should refrain from applying social pressure on 
witnesses or otherwise encouraging them to answer questions they are uncertain of. These 
principles are particularly important when interviewing children, who may defer to an adult 
interviewer's authority. 
Recall accuracy is also influenced by the question format: Responses to open-ended requests 
(e.g., Describe the rapist's appearance) are more accurate than to closed questions (e.g., Did the 
rapist have dark or light hair?). An over-riding principle of the CI then is to conduct the 
interview primarily by asking open-ended questions. Closed questions should be used only 
sparingly, when witnesses do not provide a complete response to the open-ended question. A 
second benefit of asking primarily open-ended questions is that they typically elicit longer, 
richer, narrative responses than the abbreviated responses to closed questions. Such long 
narrative responses should also foster a sense of control as they allow victims to tell their own 
story.
