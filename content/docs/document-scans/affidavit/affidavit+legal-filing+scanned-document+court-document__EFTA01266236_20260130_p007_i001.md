Executors shall be empowered to make such decision. If no Executor is empowered to 
participate in such decision, then the first successor Executor of my estate designated in 
Paragraph A of Article THIRD and able and willing to act shall be empowered to make such 
decision. If no Executor or successor Executor is empowered to participate in such decision, my 
Executor may designate a successor Executor to serve as Executor of my estate who shall be

Such designation shall be by written notice delivered to such successor Executor.

Except as otherwise specifically provided 
herein and except as provided in Paragraph G(2) of this Article, my Executor shall allocate 
receipts and disbursements in accordance with sound trust accounting principles and shall have 
discretion to allocate receipts and disbursements when the treatment is uncertain under 
applicable laws or generally accepted accounting principles in the judgment of my Executor. 
(2) 
Except as otherwise specifically provided in 
this Will, my Executor shall not treat any part of the principal amount of the proceeds of sale of 
any asset of my estate as income distributable to or for the benefit of any beneficiary entitled to 
distributions of income; provided, however, that my Executor shall treat a portion of any 
proceeds of sale of any financial instrument originally issued or acquired at a discount equal to 
the amount which (a) has previously been characterized as ordinary income for income tax 
purposes or (b) will be characterized as ordinary income for income tax purposes in the year of 
such sale, as income for trust accounting purposes. 
FIFTH: 
Where a party to any proceeding with respect to my estate has the 
same interest as a person under a disability, it shall not be necessary to serve legal process on the 
person under a disability. 
SIXTH: 
If any beneficiary under The Jeffrey E. Epstein 2001 Trust One

or to the validity of any disposition or provision of my Will or of the trust or (b) institute or 
prosecute, or be in any way directly or indirectly instrumental in the institution or prosecution 
of, any action, proceeding, contest, objection or claim for the purpose of setting aside or 
invalidating my Will or the trust or any disposition therein or provision thereof, then I direct that 
(a) any and all provisions in the trust for such beneficiary and his issue in any degree shall be 
null and void and (b) my estate, whether passing under my Will or the trust or pursuant to the 
laws of intestacy, shall be disposed of as if such beneficiary and his issue in any degree had all 
failed to survive me.
