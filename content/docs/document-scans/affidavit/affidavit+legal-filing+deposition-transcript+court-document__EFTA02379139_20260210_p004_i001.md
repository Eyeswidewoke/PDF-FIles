Richard, 
Not funny at all, just factual. 
I think if we are to ultimately agree on =alue it will be important we agree on a 
set of facts: 
1. 
TTM EBITDA is $6.7Million. If you disagree, please let us know =recisely 
what items you disagree with in the number and we can =iscuss. 
2. 
The current cash balance for the company is $13.1 Million. 
3. 
The past three comparable transactions for companies in this market 
average =n enterprise value at - 10x multiple of EBITDA 
a. 
Wilhelmina: 7x (average meaningful trading multiple since 2010) 
b. 
Creative Artists Agency: 10x (TPG acquisition, 2014) 
c. 
IMG: 13x (WME acquisition, 2013) 
4. 
We invested $18 million for a 42% stake in the business, implying an 
=nterprise value of $42.9 million. 
5. 
We received a bona fide offer from OpenGate Capital which would have 
=esulted in $18 million in proceeds for us (and in fact a $17 million =istribution to Faith and Joel), and while they were, 
as you point out, =nbsp;contemplating leverage in the <3x EBITDA range, it is in fact a relevant data point and an 
independent look at =alue. 
6. 
One other note that is relevant to us, is that when Elite Models in Europe 
=ontacted us with an interest in buying the company, Faith told me to =elay to them that they would not contemplate 
selling to Elite for less =han $100 million (which at the time was a +10x synergy-adjusted EBITDA value). Ultimately they 
walked based =n that value requirement. 
I would hope you agree that the following =s a commonly agreed upon formula 
for value: 
a. 
Enterprise value = EBITDA x Market Multiple 
b. 
Equity Value = Enterprise Value + net cash (or — net debt). 
One matter of judgment is what of the cash =alance is "excess cash". Joel has 
said he =elieves all the cash is due to the models. The facts show that in =he ordinary course of business the collection 
of receivables offsets the =ayables and in the past three years, the cash balance has only =luctuated at most by $3 
million, meaning anywhere from $8-10 million on =he balance sheet should be considered to be "excess cash", not 
needed for day-to-day operations. I have =ttached both a three year cash balance tracker and a current balance =heet 
for your review. 
Using the above, a very modest calculation =f value would be $6.7 million of 
EBITDA x 5 multiple (a 50% discount to =he market) or an enterprise value of $33.5 million and if we took a conservative 
view of what excess cash is at =he moment of $8 million, would result in a total equity value of $41.5 =illion. Our 42% 
would equate to $17.4 million of proceeds to =s. That is at a multiple that has been deeply discounted to the market 
comps that were actually paid for companies in the same =usiness. 
We are, however, willing to take much less =han this very discounted value 
calculation, as I have mentioned to you =efore. However, your proposal of $5 million of proceeds to us represents an 
equity value of $11.9 million ($51.42), =n enterprise value of $3.9 million ($11.9 million - $8 million of =xcess cash) or an 
EBITDA multiple of 0.58x ($6.7 x 0.58 = $3.9 =nterprise value), a level that is far too low for us to accept. 
I look forward to our discussion tomorrow =orning. 
Neale
