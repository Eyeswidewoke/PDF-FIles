that the fisting options market deems to be suitable for spec-
ifying as successor reference obligations. The option will 
cease trading on the confirmation date, and its expiration 
date will be accelerated. If no credit event is confirmed to 
have occurred within the covered period. the option will 
expire worthless. 
Adjustment of credit default basket options for a com-
plete redemption. In the case of a single or multiple payout 
credit default basket option. if a complete redemption event 
occurs with respect to one of the reference entities in the 
basket and no credit event is confirmed. pursuant to the 
rules of the listing options market, to have occurred prior to 
the effective date of such redemption event, the options will 
be adjusted by removing the affected reference entity from 
the basket of reference entitles. When a reference entity is 
deleted from the basket of reference entities because of a 
redemption event the cash settlement amount of the option 
will be reduced by an amount reflecting the weight of the 
deleted reference entity in the basket. The relative weights of 
the other components in the basket will remain unchanged, 
although each will represent a proportionally larger percent-
age of the adjusted cash settlement amount. 
EXAMPLE: Company XYZ is one of ten reference enti-
ties for a class of multiple payout credit default option con-
tracts and its 8% May 15.2022 bond issue is specified as its 
only reference obligation. Company XYZ was assigned a 
weight of 15% when the credit default option was opened for 
trading. During the life of the option• Company XYZ redeems 
the 8% May 15. 2022 bond issue. No reference obligations 
remain and the listing options market determines that there 
are no other outstanding debt obligations of the issuer suita-
ble for specification as reference obligations. The basket 
component will be removed from the credit default basket, 
and the cash settlement amount will be reduced by t5%. 
Succession Event Adjustments. A succession event 
occurs when one or more new entities assume one or more 
reference obligations of a reference entity or become the 
obligor with respect to any obligation that is substituted for 
the original reference obligations. This may occur, for exam-
ple, when a reference entity Is merged into a new entity or 
spins off a pert of its business into a new entity. If, as the 
result of a succession event, more than one entity is the 
obligor of the original reference obligations. or obligations 
that were substituted for the original reference obligations. 
all of those obligors• including, as the case may be, the 
original reference entity, are referred to as successor refer-
ence entities. 
Adjustment of credit default options after a succession 
event. Where a succession event results in assumption of all 
reference obligations by a single entity, the listing options 
market will ordinarily adjust the option by substituting the 
entity that assumes the reference obligation(s) as the new 
reference entity. Where a succession event results in more 
than one successor reference entity, the credit default option 
may be adjusted by dividing it into two or more options. 
EXAMPLE: Company XYZ is the reference entity for a 
credit default option contract, and its 8% May 15, 2022 bond 
issue is the only reference obligation. During the life of the
