ownership for such policy or annuity, including, without limitation, any decision to continue, 
assign, terminate or convert such policy or annuity or to name the beneficiary of such policy or 
annuity. 
E. 
An Executor hereunder may by a written notice 
delivered to the other Executor (or Executors) decline to participate in the decision to exercise or 
not exercise any fiduciary power granted by this Will or by law. 
F. 
If an Executor is not empowered (because of a 
conflict of interest, declination to act or otherwise) to participate in the decision to exercise or 
not exercise any fiduciary power granted by this Will or by law, then the remaining Executor or 
Executors shall be empowered to make such decision. If no Executor is empowered to 
participate in such decision, then the successor Executor of my estate designated in Paragraph A 
of Article THIRD and able and willing to act shall be empowered to make such decision. If no 
Executor or successor Executor is empowered to participate in such decision, my Executor may 
designate a successor Executor to serve as Executor of my estate who shall be empowered to 
make such decision but shall have no other power or authority of my Executor. Such designation 
shall be by written notice delivered to such successor Executor. 
G. 
(1) 
Except as otherwise specifically provided 
herein and except as provided in Paragraph G(2) of this Article, my Executor shall allocate 
receipts and disbursements in accordance with sound trust accounting principles and shall have 
discretion to allocate receipts and disbursements when the treatment is uncertain under 
applicable laws or generally accepted accounting principles in the judgment of my Executor. 
(2) 
Except as otherwise specifically provided in 
this Will, my Executor shall not treat any part of the principal amount of the proceeds of sale of 
any asset of my estate as income distributable to or for the benefit of any beneficiary entitled to 
distributions of income; provided, however, that my Executor shall treat a portion of any 
proceeds of sale of any financial instrument originally issued or acquired at a discount equal to 
the amount which (a) has previously been characterized as ordinary income for income tax 
purposes or (b) will be characterized as ordinary income for income tax purposes in the year of 
such sale, as income for trust accounting purposes. 
FIFTH: 
Where a party to any proceeding with respect to my estate has the 
same interest as a person under a disability, it shall not be necessary to serve legal process on the 
person under a disability. 
SIXTH: 
If any beneficiary under the Trust shall in any way directly or 
indirectly (a) contest or object to the probate of my Will or to the validity of any disposition or 
provision of my Will or of the Trust or (b) institute or prosecute, or be in any way directly or 
indirectly instrumental in the institution or prosecution of, any action, proceeding, contest, 
objection or claim for the purpose of setting aside or invalidating my Will or the Trust or any 
disposition therein or provision thereof, then I direct that (a) any and all provisions in the Trust 
for such beneficiary and his issue in any degree shall be null and void and (b) my estate, whether 
passing under my Will or the Trust or pursuant to the laws of intestacy, shall be disposed of as if 
such beneficiary and his issue in any degree had all failed to survive me.
