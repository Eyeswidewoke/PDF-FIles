CM, we would acquire a 100% interest in the target. However, as a remit of the issuance of a substantial number 
of new shares of common stock, our stockholders immediately prior to such transaction could own less than a 
majority of our outstanding shares of common stock subsequent to such transaction. In addition, other minority 
stockholders may subsequently combine their holdings resulting in a single person or group obtaining a larger 
share of the company's stock than we initially acquired. Accordingly, this may make it more likely that our 
management will not be able to maintain our control of the target business. 
We do not have a specified maximum redemption threshold. The absence of such a redemption threshold 
may make it possible for us to complete a business combination with which a substantial majority of our 
stockholders do not agree. 
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation does not provide a specified maximum redemption 
threshold, except that in no event will we redeem ow' public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible 
assets to be less than $5,000,001 (such that we are not subject to the SEC's "penny stock" rules) or any greater 
net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the apt-email relating to our initial business 
combination. As a result, we may be able to complete our business combination even though a substantial 
majority of our public stockholders do not agree with the transaction and have redeemed their shares or, if we 
seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and do not conduct redemptions in connection with 
our business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, have enteral into privately negotiated agreements to 
sell their shares to our symbol-, officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates. In the event the aggregate cash 
consideration we would be required to pay for all shares of common stock that arc validly submitted for 
redemption plus any amount requital to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business 
combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the business combination 
or redeem any shares, all shares of common stock submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders 
thereof, and we instead may search for an alternate business combination.

The exercise price for the public warrants is higher than in many similar blank check company offerings in 
the past, and, accordingly, the warrants are more likely to expire worthless. 
The exercise price of the public warrants is higher than is typical in many similar blank check companies in 
the past. Historically, the exercise price of a warrant was generally a fraction of the purchase price of the units in 
the initial public offering. The exercise price for our public warrants is $5.75 per half share, or $11.50 per whole 
share. As a result, the warrants are less likely to ever be in the money and more likely to expire worthless. 
In order to effectuate an initial business combination, blank check companies have, in the recent past, 
amended various provisions of their charters and modified governing instruments. We cannot assure you 
that we will not seek to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or governing 
instruments in a manner that will make it easier for us to complete our initial business combination that 
our stockholders may not support. 
In order to effectuate a business combination, blank check companies have, in the recent past. amended 
various provisions of their charters and modified governing instruments. For example, blank check companies 
have amended the definition of business combination, increase) redemption thresholds and changed industry 
focus. We cannot assure you that we will not seek to amend our charter or governing instruments in order to 
effectuate our initial business combination. 
The provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation that relate to our pre-business 
combination activity (and corresponding provisions of the agreement governing the release of funds from 
our trust account) may be amended with the approval of holders of 65% of our common stock, which is a 
lower amendment threshold than that of some other blank check companies. It may be easier for us, 
therefore, to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to facilitate the completion of an 
initial business combination that some of our stockholders may not support. 
Some other blank check companies have a provision in their charter which prohibits the amendment of 
certain of its provisions, including those which relate to a company's pre-business combination activity, without 
approval by a certain percentage of the company's stockholders. In those companies. amendment of these 
provisions requires approval by between 90% and 100% of the company's public stockholders. Our amended and 
restated certificate of incorporation will provide that any of its provisions related to pre-business combination 
activity (including the requirement to deposit proceeds of this offering and the private placement of warrants into 
the trust account and not release such amounts except in specified circumstances. and to provide redemption rights 
to public stockholders as described herein) may be amended if approved by holders of 65% of our common stock, 
and corresponding provisions of the trust agreement governing the release of funds from our trust account may be 
amended if approved by holders of 65% of our common stock. In all other instances. our amended and restated 
certificate of incorporation may be amended by holders of a majority of our common stock, subject to applicable 
provisions of the DGCL or applicable stock exchange rules. Our initial stockholder, who will beneficially own 
20.0% of our common stock upon the closing of this offering (assuming it dots not purchase any units in this
