(b) 
the rights, powers, duties and obligations hereby conferred or imposed upon the 
Trustee in respect of any property covered by the appointment of a co-trustee shall be conferred 
or imposed upon and exercised or performed by the Trustee or by the Trustee and such co-trustee 
jointly, as shall be provided in the instrument appointing such co-trustee, except to the extent that 
under any law of any jurisdiction in which any particular act is to be performed, the Trustee shall 
be incompetent or unqualified to perform such act, in which event, such rights, powers, duties 
and obligations shall be exercised and performed by a co-trustee; 
(c) 
the Trustee at any time, by an instrument in writing executed by it, with the 
concurrence of the Issuer evidenced by an Issuer Order, may accept the resignation of or remove 
any co-trustee appointed under this Section 6.13, and in case an Event of Default has occurred 
and is continuing, the Trustee shall have the power to accept the resignation of, or remove, any 
such co-trustee without the concurrence of the Issuer. A successor to any co-trustee so resigned 
or removed may be appointed in the manner provided in this Section 6.13; 
(d) 
no co-trustee hereunder shall be personally liable by reason of any act or omission 
of the Trustee or any other co-trustee hereunder; 
(e) 
the Trustee shall not be liable by reason of any act or omission of a co-trustee; and 
(t) 
any Act of Holders delivered to the Trustee shall be deemed to have been 
delivered to each co-trustee. 
Section 6.14. Certain Duties Related to Delayed Payment of Proceeds. 
In the event that in any month the Trustee shall not have received a payment with respect 
to any Pledged Obligation on its Due Date (unless otherwise directed by the Investment 
Manager), (a) the Trustee shall promptly notify the Investment Manager in writing and (b) unless 
within three Business Days (or the end of the applicable grace period for such payment, if 
longer) after such notice (i) such payment shall have been received by the Trustee, or (ii) the 
Issuer, in its absolute discretion (but only to the extent permitted by Section 10.2(a)), shall have 
made provision for such payment satisfactory to the Trustee in accordance with Section 10.2(a), 
then the Trustee shall request the obligor of such Pledged Obligation, the trustee under the 
related Underlying Instrument or paying agent designated by either of them, as the case may be, 
to make such payment as soon as practicable after such request but in no event later than three 
Business Days after the date of such request. In the event that such payment is not made within 
such time period, the Trustee, subject to the provisions of clause (iv) of Section 6.8(a), shall take 
such action as the Investment Manager shall reasonably direct in writing. Any such action shall 
be without prejudice to any right to claim a Default or Event of Default under this Indenture. In 
the event that the Issuer or the Investment Manager requests a release of a Pledged Obligation 
and/or delivers a Collateral Obligation in connection with any such action under the Investment 
Management Agreement, such release and/or substitution shall be subject to Section 10.7 and 
Article XII of this Indenture, as the case may be. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, 
the Trustee shall deliver to the Issuer or its designee any payment with respect to any Pledged 
Obligation received after the Due Date thereof to the extent the Issuer previously made 
provisions for such payment satisfactory to the Trustee in accordance with this Section 6.14 and 
Section 10.2(a) and such payment shall not be deemed part of the Collateral.
