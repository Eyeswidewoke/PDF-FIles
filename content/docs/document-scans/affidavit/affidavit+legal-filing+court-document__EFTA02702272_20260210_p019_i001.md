DTC holds securities that its participants deposit with DTC. DTC also facilitates the settlement among its 
participants of securities transactions, including transfers and pledges, in deposited securities through electronic 
computerized book-entry changes in participants' accounts, which eliminates the need for physical movement of 
securities certificates. "Direct participants" in DTC include securities brokers and dealers, including 
underwriters, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and other organizations. DTC is owned by a number 
of its direct participants and by the New York Stock Exchange, Inc., the NYSE MKT LLC and the Financial 
Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. Access to the DTC system is also available to others, which we sometimes 
refer to as "indirect participants," that clear transactions through or maintain a custodial relationship with a direct 
participant either directly or indirectly. The rules applicable to DTC and its participants are on file with the SEC. 
Purchases of debentures within the DTC system must be made by or through direct participants, which will 
receive a credit for those debentures on DTC's records. The ownership interest of the actual purchaser of 
debentures, which we sometimes refer to as a "beneficial owner," is in turn recorded on the direct and indirect 
participants' records. Beneficial owners of debentures will not receive written confirmation from DTC of their 
purchases. However, beneficial owners are expected to receive written confirmations providing details of their 
transactions, as well as periodic statements of their holdings, from the direct or indirect participants through 
which they purchased debentures. Transfers of ownership interests in global debentures are to be accomplished 
by entries made on the books of participants acting on behalf of beneficial owners. Beneficial owners will not 
receive certificates representing their ownership interests in the global debentures except under the limited 
circumstances described below. 
To facilitate subsequent transfers, all global debentures deposited with DTC will be registered in the name 
of DTC's nominee. Cede & Co. The deposit of debentures with DTC and their registration in the name of 
Cede & Co. will not change the beneficial ownership of the debentures. DTC has no knowledge of the actual 
beneficial owners of the debentures. DTC's records reflect only the identity of the direct participants to whose 
accounts the debentures are credited, which may or may not be the beneficial owners. The participants are 
responsible for keeping account of their holdings on behalf of their customers. 
Conveyance of notices and other communications by DTC to direct participants, by direct participants to 
indirect participants and by direct participants and indirect participants to beneficial owners will be governed by 
arrangements among them, subject to any legal requirements in effect from time to time. 
Redemption notices will be sent to DTC or its nominee. If less than all of the debentures are being 
redeemed, the amount of the interest of each direct participant in the debentures to be redeemed will be 
determined in accordance with DTC's procedures or as the trustee may deem fair and appropriate. 
In any case where a vote may be required with respect to the debentures. neither DTC nor Cede & Co. will 
give consents for or vote the global debentures. Under its usual procedures. DTC will mail an omnibus proxy to 
us as soon as possible after the record date. The omnibus proxy assigns the consenting or voting rights of 
Cede & Co. to those direct participants to whose accounts the debentures are credited on the record date 
identified in a listing attached to the omnibus proxy. 
Principal and interest payments on the debentures will be made to Cede & Co.. as nominee of DTC. 
DTC's practice is to credit direct participants' accounts on the relevant payment date unless DTC has reason 
to believe that it will not receive payment on the payment date. Payments by direct and indirect participants to 
beneficial owners will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices. as is the case with 
securities held for the account of customers in bearer form or registered in "strut name." Those payments will be 
the responsibility of participants and not of DTC or us, subject to any legal requirements in effect from time to 
time. Payment of principal and interest to Cede & Co. is our responsibility, disbursement of payments to direct 
participants is the responsibility of DTC. and disbursement of payments to the beneficial owners is the 
responsibility of direct and indirect participants.
