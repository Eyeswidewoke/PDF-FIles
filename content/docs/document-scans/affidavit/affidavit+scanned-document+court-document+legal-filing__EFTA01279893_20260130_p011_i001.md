Condominium Act, the obligation for maintenance, repair, or replacement of any portions of the 
heating, ventilating, and air conditioning systems that are Limited Common Elements shall be the 
sole responsibility of the Owners of the Units to which such Limited Common Elements are 
allocated. References in this Declaration to "Common Elements" shall include Limited Common 
Elements unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.. . The allocation of use of Limited 
Common Elements to the Units as provided for in this Declaration shall not be altered without the 
unanimous consent of the Owners whose Units are affected. The Condominium Parking Facility 
shall be maintained by the owner of the Parking Facility in conjunction with maintenance of the 
remainder of the Parking Facility. The Association shall be responsible for a proportional share of 
the costs of maintenance of the Parking Facility as described in the ROA, which costs shall be part

Section 5.3 
Undivided Interests of Owners in Common Elements. The percentage 
interest in the Common Elements allocated to each Unit shall be the Common Elements Interest 
for that Unit as set forth on exhibit B attached hereto. Except as set forth in Section 9.5(a) and 
Section 6.3, the Common Elements Interest allocated to each Unit shall not be changed except 
with the unanimous consent of all the Owners of all the Units and with the consent of all the 
Mortgagees. In particular, if Declarant exercises its development right to subdivide Units and 
create additional Units and Limited Common Elements, Declarant shall have the right to adjust 
the Common Elements Interest for each Unit in accordance with the following formula: the 
Common Elements Interest allocated to each Unit is based on the heated square footage of that 
Unit, as shown on the Plans, calculated by dividing the heated square footage of that Unit by the 
total heated square footage of all Units, and by multiplying the quotient so calculated by one 
hundred (100). These Supplementary Declarations required by Section 6.3 of this Declaration 
shall contain a new allocation of Common Elements Interest calculated in accordance with the 
foregoing formula which shall be substituted for Exhibit B attached to this Declaration in the 
event that Declarant exercises this development right.
