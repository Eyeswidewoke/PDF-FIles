TIA's role in territorial policy making also extends to advocating positions with other federal 
agencies, and with Congress, which are favorable to the territories. TIA's success in such efforts 
with other agencies usually depends on the significance of the issue involved and the relative 
political power of TIA or the Department of Interior as compared to that of the other agency 
involved. Of course, as the territories have gained political maturity, and particularly since they 
began electing governors in the 1970's, they have come to rely less and less on TIA's assistance 
with other agencies and have undertaken the responsibility to advocate their own positions directly 
with the agencies as well as with Congress. Again, the extent of a territory's self reliance (and 
success) in such areas can vary widely from issue to issue and from territory to territory. 
In the area of territorial tax policy, however, the relatively powerful Department of the Treasury 
(specifically the Assistant Secretary for Tax Policy) usually has the final say on the administration 
position. As a result, neither TIA nor the territories themselves have had substantial influence in 
this area, at least with respect to influencing the administration position. TIA's views are rarely 
expressed on tax policy matters, and, if they are expressed, they generally do not differ 
substantially from those of Treasury. While the territories themselves have, particularly in recent 
years, conducted a dialogue on territorial tax policy issues with the Assistant Secretary for Tax 
Policy, as will be seen below, their success, where it has come at all, has usually resulted from 
their direct contact with Congress. 
The Tax Reform Act of 1986 
The Tax Reform Act of 1986 contained several provisions making significant changes in the 
income tax systems of the U.S. territories other than Puerto Rico. With a few exceptions, .934(b) 
being one of them, these provisions largely reflected the administration's tax policy toward the 
territories in the mid- 1970's to the mid-1980's, as expressed by the Treasury Department. This 
policy consisted of three main elements: maintaining or increasing territorial income tax revenues 
so as to reduce reliance on federal funding sources, elimination of fraud and abuse, and 
elimination of the so-called "mirror systems" of territorial taxation. All three of these elements are 
reflected in the Tax Reform Act of 1986 provisions relating to Guam, American Samoa, and the 
Northern Marianas, as well as the U.S. Virgin Islands, but the provisions relating to the U.S. Virgin 
Islands are substantially different from those which apply to the other three territories. In short, the 
Virgin Islands has retained the mirror system but has enacted special provisions allowing the 
elimination of tax on companies that meet certain relatively simple requirements, while the other 
territories are considering enactment of entirely new tax systems. 
The 1986 legislation relating to Guam, American Samoa, and the Northern Marianas was almost 
solely a reflection of Treasurys tax policy toward the territories and was both proposed and 
enacted without a substantial amount of either support or objection from these territories. The 
difference in treatment for the Virgin Islands is primarily a result of that territory's mostly 
successful effort in the early 1980's to influence the federal formulation of territorial tax policy 
relating to the Virgin Islands. So that the Tax Reform Act of 1986 provisions relating Virgin 
Islands, and particularly to Virgin Islands exempt companies, may be put in the proper historical 
and policy context, a brief outline of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 provisions applying to the other 
three territories follows.
