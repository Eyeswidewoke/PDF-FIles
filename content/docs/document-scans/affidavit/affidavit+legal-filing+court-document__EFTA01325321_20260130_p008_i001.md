FBI FACT SHEET 
• 
The primary functions of the FBI are national security and law enforcement. 
• 
The FBI does not keep a file on every citizen of the United States. 
• 
The FBI was not established until 1908 and we have very few records prior to the 1920s. 
• 
FBI files generally contain reports of FBI investigations of a wide range of matters, including counterterrorism, 
counter-intelligence, cyber crime, public corruption, civil rights, organized crime, white collar crime, major thefts. 
violent crime, and applicants. 
• 
The FBI does not issue clearances or non-clearances for anyone other than its own personnel or persons 
having access to FBI facilities. Background investigations for security clearances are conducted by many 
different Government agencies. Persons who received a clearance while in the military or employed with some 
other government agency should contact that entity. Most government agencies have websites which are 
accessible on the internet which have their contact information. 
• 
An identity history summary check or "rap sheet" is NOT the same as an "FBI file." It is a listing of 
information taken from fingerprint cards and related documents submitted to the FBI in connection with arrests, 
federal employment, naturalization or military service. The subject of a "rap sheet" may obtain a copy by 
submitting a written request to FBI CJIS Division — Summary Request. 1000 Custer Hollow Road. Clarksburg. WV 
26306. Along with a specific written request, the individual must submit a new full set of his/her fingerprints in 
order to locate the record, establish positive identification, and ensure that an individual's records are not 
disseminated to an unauthorized person. The fingerprint submission must include the subject's name, date and 
place of birth. There is a required fee of $18 for this service, which must be submitted by money order or 
certified check made payable to the Treasury of the United States. A credit card payment option is also 
available. Forms for this option and additional directions may be obtained by accessing the FBI Web site at 
www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/identity-history-summary-checks. 
• 
The National Name Check Program (NNCP) conducts a search of the FBI's Universal Index (UNI) to identify 
any information contained in FBI records that may be associated with an individual and provides the results of that 
search to a requesting federal, state or local agency. Names are searched in a multitude of combinations and 
phonetic spellings to ensure all records are located. The NNCP also searches for both -main" and -cross 
reference" files. A main file is an entry that carries the name corresponding to the subject of a file, while a cross 
reference is merely a mention of an individual contained in a file. The results from a search of this magnitude 
can result in several "hits" and "idents" on an individual. In each instance where UNI has identified a name 
variation or reference, information must be reviewed to determine if it is applicable to the individual in question. 
• 
The Record/Information Dissemination Section (RIDS) searches for records and provides copies of FBI files 
responsive to Freedom of Information or Privacy Act (FOIPA) requests for information. RIDS provides 
responsive documents to requesters seeking 'reasonably described information." For a FOIPA search, the 
subject's name, event, activity, or business is searched to determine whether there is an associated investigative 
file. This is called a "main file search" and differs from the NNCP search.
