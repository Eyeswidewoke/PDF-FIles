Our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation 
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will contain certain requirements and restrictions 
relating to this offering that will apply to us until the completion of our initial business combination. These 
provisions cannot be amended without the approval of the holders of at least 65% of our common stock. Our 
initial stockholder, who will beneficially own 20.0% of our common stock upon the closing of this offering 
(assuming it does not purchase any units in this offering), will participate in any vote to amend our amended and 
restated certificate of incorporation and will have the discretion to vote in any manner it chooses. Specifically, our 
amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide, among other things, that: 
if we are unable to complete ow initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of this 
offering, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up. (ii) as promptly as 
reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, subject to lawfully available funds 
therefor, redeem 100% of the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash. equal to the aggregate 
amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable 
and less up to $50,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses) divided by the number of then outstanding 
public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders' rights as stockholders 
(including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as 
promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining 
stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under 
Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law; 
prior to our initial business combination, we may not issue additional shares of capital stock that would 
entitle the holders thereof to (i) receive funds from the trust account or (ii) vote on any initial business 
combination; 
although we do not intend to enter into a business combination with a target business that is affiliated with 
our management team or their affiliates, we arc not prohibited from doing so. In the event we enter into 
such a transaction, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent 
accounting firm or an investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA that such a business 
combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view; 
• if a stockholder vote on our initial business combination is not required by law and we do not decide to hold 
a stockholder vote for business or other legal reasons, we will offer to Seem our public shares pursuant to 
Rule I3e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, and will file tender offer documents with the SEC 
prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same fmancial and 
other information about our initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under 
Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act; 
• Our initial business combination must occur with one or inure target businesses that together have an 
aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of our assets held in the trust account (excluding the deferred 
underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the income carnal on the rust account) at the time of the 
agreement to enter into the initial business combination; 
If our stockholders approve an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation that 
would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not 
complete our business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering, we will provide our 
public stockholders with the opportunity to Seem all or a portion of their shares of common stock upon 
such approval at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the 
128 
trust account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable) divided by the number of then 
outstanding public shares; and 
• we will not effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar 
company with nominal operations. 
In addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that under no circumstances 
will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than 
$5,000,001. 
Certain Anti-Takeover Provisions of Delaware Law and our Amended and Restated Certificate of 
Incorporation and Bylaws 
We will be subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL regulating corporate takeovers upon
