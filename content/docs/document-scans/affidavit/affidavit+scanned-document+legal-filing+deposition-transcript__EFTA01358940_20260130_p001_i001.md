confidential information related to potential financing for the ADT acquisition. In addition, 
the information was considered confidential by its source.At the time of each trade 
identified herein, John Afriyie was in possession of material information. The relevant 
information was material because it would have been important to a reasonable investor in

the funds under circumstances in which it is not just, equitable, or conscionable for her to
