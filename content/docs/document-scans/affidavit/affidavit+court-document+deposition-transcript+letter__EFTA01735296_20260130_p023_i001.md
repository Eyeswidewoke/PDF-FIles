intercourse with her without her knowledge". The obvious and straightforward way of reading that allegation is 
that the complainant had made it clear that she would not consent to unprotected sex, and yet it occurred 
without her knowledge and therefore without her consent. Mr Assange was aware of this. Unprotected sex is 
wholly different from protected sex in that its potential repercussions arc not confined to disease and include 
pregnancy. Again this meets the criteria for section 64(3) set out above. In addition the terms "molested" and 
"violated" are inconsistent with consent (see below). 
Offence 3, also set out in full above, alleges that Mr Assange "deliberately molested the injured party by acting 
in a manner designed to violate her sexual integrity, by lying next to her and pressing his naked, erect penis to her 
body". Deliberately molesting someone so as to violate their sexual integrity is not language that is consistent 
with consent or belief in consent. Molest means to cause trouble to; to vex, annoy, to inconvenience. A 
secondary meaning is to meddle with (a person) injuriously or with hostile intent. (Shorter Oxford English 
Dictionary: Third Edition.) Among the various meanings attributed to "violate" in the OED is to ravish or 
outrage a woman; to do violence to; to treat irreverently; to desecrate, dishonour, profane or defile. A secondary 
meaning is to destroy a person's chastity by force. There arc other definitions, many of which have at their core 
the use of violence. If this conduct is attributed its ordinary meaning, then if proved it would amount to sexual 
assault in this country. Again section 64(3) applies. 
The position with offence 4 is different. This is an allegation of rape. The framework list is ticked for rapt. 
The defence accepts that normally the ticking of a framework list offence box on an EAW would require very 
little analysis by the court. However they then developed a sophisticated argument that the conduct alleged here 
would not amount to rape in most European countries. However, what is alleged here is that Mr Assange 
"deliberately consummated sexual intercourse with her by improperly exploiting that she, due to sleep, was in a 
helpless state". In this country that would amount to rape. 
I have not thought it necessary or desirable to consider extraneous material. I have looked only at the language 
used in the warrant. The parties have taken me to some further information in the bundle. This appears to 
consist of an interview with the complainants. I am not sure if this information provides the full extent of the 
allegation. Even if it does, however, it is unnecessary to consider this material in this context. Section 64(2) 
applies. 
As I am satisfied that the specified offences arc extradition offences I must go on to consider whether any of the 
bars to extradition specified in section I I arc applicable. No bars are raised and none is found. 
It is convenient here to consider the abuse of process allegation.
