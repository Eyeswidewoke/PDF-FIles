held by brokers are generally not held in the Partnership's name, a failure of any such broker is 
likely to have a greater adverse impact on the Partnership than if such securities were registered 
in the Partnership's name. 
Neither the Investment Manager nor the General Partner is currently registered as an 
investment adviser with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") or with any other 
jurisdiction or as a commodity trading advisor or commodity pool operator with the Commodity 
Futures Trading Commission ("CFTC"), although either entity may do so in the future. Many of 
the Portfolio Managers with which the Partnership invests will also not be registered as 
investment advisers with the SEC or with any other jurisdiction or as commodity trading 
advisors or commodity pool operators with the CFTC. Consequently, some of the protections 
that would otherwise be available to investors if the Investment Manager, the General Partner 
and/or the Portfolio Managers were subject to more comprehensive regulatory oversight may not 
be available with respect to investments in the Partnership. 
Quantitative Strategies. As part of their trading strategies, certain Portfolio Managers 
will utilize techniques that rely, at least primarily on quantitative analysis to identify potential 
investments. Quantitative analysis produces positive results only to the extent that the market 
prices of securities revert toward the value which the Portfolio Manager's calculations suggest. 
No assurance can be given that the trading systems employed by a Portfolio Manager will be 
successful in a given set of market conditions, or that such trading system is the most successful 
available system. In addition, if numerous traders employ a similar system, this may impede the 
ability of the Portfolio Manager to execute these trades at attractive prices. The use of a 
computer in collating information or in developing and operating a trading method does not 
assure the success of the method because a computer is merely an aid in compiling and 
organizing price information. Accordingly, no assurance is given that the decisions based on the 
any Portfolio Manager's trading program will produce profits for the Partnership. 
Derivative Contracts. The Partnership may acquire interests in contracts commonly 
known or referred to as "derivatives." Such contracts may include interest rate or other swap 
contracts and other notional principal amount agreements. In addition to ordinary investment 
risk, such contracts may involve certain additional risks, including counterparty risk (i.e., the risk 
that the other party to the contract will not perform its obligations), and liquidity risk (since there 
may not be a liquid market within which to close outstanding derivatives contracts). 
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank 
Act") enables the CFTC and the SEC to enact new regulations on certain over-the-counter 
derivatives. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, certain over-the-counter derivatives contracts will be 
regulated through regulated clearing houses and subject to regulation by the SEC and the CFTC. 
The type and number of derivatives contracts subject to the clearing requirement, the regulations 
governing swaps clearing organizations and exchanges, the scope of the swaps dealer and major 
swap participant definitions, and the capital and margin requirements imposed on such entities, 
await regulatory action. The ultimate impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on the derivatives market is 
unclear and will depend in large part on future government regulations. 
Risks Associated With Investments in Mortgage-Back Securities (MBS). A mortgage 
comes equipped with a repayment schedule which establishes a sequence of monthly payments
