For ex , my disccusions with other=clients are a give and take , of laws mecahnisms. 
tactic= strategys.. audit prep. . case law.. a joint composition of high level pla=ning . reporting. analyisis, 
alternatives. =nbsp; hearing about an article that your guy might have read in his =entitst office. that turns out to be 
bogus. is emblematic of the off=ce. I am confient that you will grow into the job, . re clats = only asked if any of your

art will be sold quickly. and t=at there is a chapter in lerners book about it , the same book that leon relied on to his 
detrim=nt before. ( 1031 ) . was suprising, . if the art =s to be sold quickly ( not sure leon would sign on. )&nb=p; , DO 
it before he dies. not after. art delays the cl=sing of the estate.
