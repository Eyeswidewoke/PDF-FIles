ASVAB SCORE AND TEST DESCRIPTIONS 
Verbal Skills is a general measure of language and reading skills which 
combines the Word Knowledge and Paragraph Comprehension tests. People 
with high scores tend to do well in tasks that require good language or 
reading skills, while people with low scores have more difficulty with such 
tasks. 
Math Skills is a general measure of mathematics skills which combines the 
Mathematics Knowledge and Arithmetic Reasoning tests. People with high 
scores tend to do well in tasks that require a knowledge of mathematics, 
while people with low scores have more difficulty with these kinds of tasks. 
Science and Technical Skills is a general measure of science and technical 
skills which combines the General Science, Electronics Information, and 
Mechanical Comprehension tests. People with high scores tend to do well in 
tasks that require scientific thinking or technical skills, while people with low 
scores have more difficulty with such tasks. 
General Science tests the ability to answer questions on a variety of science 
topics drawn from courses taught in most high schools. The life science items 
cover botany, zoology, anatomy and physiology, and ecology. The earth and 
space science items are based on astronomy, geology, meteorology, and 
oceanography. The physical science items measure force and motion me-
chanics, energy, fluids, atomic structure, and chemistry. 
Arithmetic Reasoning tests the ability to solve basic arithmetic problems 
one encounters in everyday life. One-step and multi-step word problems 
require addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and choosing the 
correct order of operations when more than one step is necessary. The items 
include operations with whole numbers, operations with rational numbers, 
ratio and proportion, interest and percentage, and measurement. Arithmetic 
reasoning is one factor that helps characterize mathematics comprehension 
and it also assesses logical thinking. 
Word Knowledge tests the ability to understand the meaning of words 
through synonyms - words having the same or nearly the same meaning as 
other words. The test is a measure of one component of reading comprehen-
sion since vocabulary is one of many factors that characterize reading 
comprehension. 
Paragraph Comprehension tests the ability to obtain information from 
written material. Students read different types of passages of varying lengths 
and respond to questions based on information presented in each passage. 
Concepts include identifying stated and reworded facts, determining a 
sequence of events, drawing conclusions, identifying main ideas, determin-
ing the author's purpose and tone, and identifying style and technique. 
Mathematics Knowledge tests the ability to solve problems by applying 
knowledge of mathematical concepts and. applications. The problems focus 
on concepts and algorithms and involve number theory, numeration, alge-
braic operations and equations, geometry and measurement, and probabil-
ity. Mathematics knowledge is one factor that characterizes mathematics 
comprehension; it also assesses logical thinking. 
Electronics Information tests understanding of electrical current, circuits, 
devices, and systems. Electronics information topics include electrical cir-
cuits, electrical and electronic systems, electrical currents, electrical tools, 
symbols, devices, and materials. 
Auto and Shop Information tests aptitude for automotive maintenance and 
repair and wood and metal shop practices. The test covers several areas 
commonly included in most high school auto and shop courses such as 
automotive components, automotive systems, automotive tools, trouble-
shooting and repair, shop tools, building materials, and building and con-
struction procedures. 
Mechanical Comprehension tests understanding of the principles of me-
chanical devices, structural support, and properties of materials. Mechanical 
comprehension topics include simple machines, compound machines, me-
chanical motion, and fluid dynamics. 
Military Careers Score is a composite of the verbal, math, Mechanical 
Comprehension, and Electronics Information tests. It compares your skills in 
these areas to the skills of military personnel currently employed in a number 
of occupations. The score is used with the publication MilitaryCareerswhich 
highlights and describes a number of military occupations. 
Military Entrance Score (AFQT) is the score used if an individual decides to 
enter any of the armed services. See your local recruiter for details.
