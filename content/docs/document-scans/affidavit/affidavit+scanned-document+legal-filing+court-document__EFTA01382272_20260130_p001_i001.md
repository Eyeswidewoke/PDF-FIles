Amendment No. 3 to Form S-I 
Table of Contents 
Fuel prices and availability may adversely affect our results of operations. 
We currently operate 378 fuel centers that are adjacent to many of our store locations. As a result, we sell a significant amount of 
gasoline. Increased regulation or significant increases in wholesale fuel costs could result in lower gross profit on fuel sales, and demand 
could be affected by retail price increases as well as by concerns about the effect of emissions on the environment. We are unable to 
predict future regulations, environmental effects, political unrest, acts of terrorism and other matters that may affect the cost and 
availability of fuel, and how our customers will react, which could adversely affect our results of operations. 
Our stores rely heavily on sales of perishable products, and product supply disruptions may have an adverse effect on our 
profitability and operating results. 
Reflecting consumer preferences, we have a significant focus on perishable products. Sales of perishable products accounted for 
approximately 40.6% of our total sales in fiscal 2014. We rely on various suppliers and vendors to provide and deliver our perishable 
product inventory on a continuous basis. We could suffer significant perishable product inventory losses and significant lost revenue in 
the event of the loss of a major supplier or vendor, disruption of our distribution network, extended power outages, natural disasters or 
other catastrophic occurrences. 
Severe weather and natural disasters may adversely affect our business. 
Severe weather conditions such as hurricanes, earthquakes, floods, extended winter storms, heat waves or tornadoes, as well as 
other natural disasters, in areas in which we have stores or distribution centers or from which we source or obtain products may cause 
physical damage to our properties, closure of one or more of our stores, manufacturing facilities or distribution centers, lack of an 
adequate work force in a market, temporary disruption in the manufacture of products, temporary disruption in the supply of products. 
disruption in the transport of goods, delays in the delivery of goods to our distribution centers or stores, a reduction in customer traffic 
and a reduction in the availability of products in our stores. In addition, adverse climate conditions and adverse weather patterns, such as 
drought or flood, that impact growing conditions and the quantity and quality of crops yielded by food producers may adversely affect the 
availability or cost of certain products within the grocery supply chain. Any of these factors may disrupt our business and adversely affect 
our business. 
Threats or potential threats to security of food and drug safety, the occurrence of a widespread health epidemic or regulatory 
concerns in our supply chain may adversely affect our business. 
Acts or threats, whether perceived or real, of war or terror or other criminal activity directed at the food or drug store industry or the 
transportation industry, whether or not directly involving our stores, could increase our operating costs and operations, or impact general 
consumer behavior and consumer spending. Other events that give rise to actual or potential food contamination, drug contamination or 
food-borne illnesses, or a widespread regional, national or global health epidemic, such as pandemic flu, could have an adverse effect 
on our operating results or disrupt production and delivery of our products, our ability to appropriately staff our stores and potentially 
cause customers to avoid public gathering places or otherwise change their shopping behaviors. 
We source our products from vendors and suppliers and related networks across the globe who may be subject to regulatory 
actions or face criticism due to actual or perceived social injustices, including human trafficking, child labor or environmental, health and 
safety violations. A disruption in our supply chain due to any regulatory action or social injustice could have an adverse impact on our 
supply chain and ultimately our business. including potential harm to our reputation.
