Table of Contra' 
accounting policy criteria and requires management judgment as to the appropriate time to initiate capitalization. Capitalization of initial payments 
for contracts and conversion costs only occurs when management is satisfied that such costs arc recoverable through future operations. contractual 
minimums, and/or penalties in case of early termination. 
We develop software that is used in providing processing sen-ices to clients. To a much lesser extent, we also develop software to be 
sold or licensed to clients. Capitalization of internally developed software, primarily associated with operating platforms. occurs only upon 
management's estimation that the likelihood of successful development and implementation reaches a probable level. Currently unforeseen 
circumstances in software development could require us to implement alternative plans with respect to a particular effort, which could result in the 
impairment of previously capitalized software development costs. 
In addition to the internally generated intangible assets discussed above, we also record intangible assets as a result of business 
combinations and asset acquisitions. In these transactions, we typically acquire and recognize intangible assets such as client relationships, 
software, and trade names. In a business combination, each intangible asset is recorded at its fair value. In an asset acquisition. the cost of the 
acquisition is allocated among the acquired assets. generally by their relative fair values. We generally estimate the fair value of acquired intangible 
assets using the excess earnings method, royalty savings method, or urn savings method, all of which are a form of a discounted cash flow 
analysis. These estimates require various assumptions about the future cash flows associated with the assets, appropriate costs of capital, and other 
inputs such as an appropriate royalty rate. Changes to these estimates would materially impact the value assigned to the assets as well as the 
amounts subsequently recorded as amortization expense. 
We test contract and conversion costs for recoverability on an annual basis by comparing the remaining expected undiscounted cash 
flows under the contract to the net book value. Any assets that arc determined to be unrecoverable arc written down to fair value. This analysis 
requires significant assumptions regarding the future profitability of the client contract during its remaining term. Additionally, contracts. 
conversion costs, and all other long lived assets (including client relationships) are tested for impairment upon an indicator of potential impairment. 
Such indicators include, but are not limited to: a current period operating or cash flow loss associated with the use of an asset or asset group. 
combined with a history of such losses and/or a forecast anticipating continued losses; a significant adverse change in the business, legal climate. 
market price of an asset or manner in which an asset is being used; an accumulation of costs for a project significantly in excess of the amount 
originally expected; or an expectation that an asset will be sold or otherwise disposal of at a loss. 
The carrying value of the First Data trade name is $604 million as of December 31, 2014. Upon consideration of many factors, including 
the determination that there are no legal, regulatory or contractual provisions that limit the useful life of the First Data trade name, we determined 
that the First Data trade name had an indefinite useful life. As an indefinite lived asset, the First Data trade name is not amortized but is reviewed 
annually for impairment until such time as it is determined to have a finite life. For 2014, we elected not to begin the process with a qualitative 
assessment due to the significance of the Elm Data trade name to our financial statements. In step one of the impairment test, we estimate the fair 
value of the First Data trade namc using a relief from royalty methodology in which a royalty rate is applied to our revenue streams to be reliant 
upon the First Data trade name in order to estimate the rent that we save by owning rather than leasing the asset. As of October 1, 2014, the most 
recent impairment analysis date, the fair value of the First Data trade name exceeded its carrying value. 
Reserve for merchant credit losses and check guarantees. With respect to the merchant acquiring business, our merchant clients (or 
those of our unconsolidated alliances) have the liability for any charges properly reversed by the cardholder. In the event, however, that we arc not 
able to collect such amounts from the merchants due to merchant fraud, insolvency. bankruptcy or another reasin, we may be liable for any such 
reversed charges. Our risk in this area primarily relates to situations where the cardholder has purchased goods or services to be delivered in the 
future such as airline tickets.
