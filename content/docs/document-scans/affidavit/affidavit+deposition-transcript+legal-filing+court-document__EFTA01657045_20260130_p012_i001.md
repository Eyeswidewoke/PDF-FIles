the investigative process, in which case, victims may be more willing to participate in later 
police interviews and to appear as a witness in court. 
Increased Reliance On Narrative Responding. Conventional police interviews rely heavily on 
asking many closed questions, relegating the victim to the role of question-answerer. In 
comparison, the CI relies more heavily on eliciting information via open-ended questions, gently 
guiding victims to narrate about the topics of investigative interest. (Several people have 
commented to us that the CI does not seem like an interview at all, because the interviewer asks 
so few questions, and the witness seems merely to be telling a story.) By allowing victims to talk 
more, and especially in the form of a narration, the CI has an enabling effect by affording more 
control to victims to give voice to their stories. Equally important to the tenets of Therapeutic 
Jurisprudence, the free narrative format allows victims to relate their stories in a non-coercive 
fashion. In support of this idea, Fisher. Mello, and McCauley (1999) found that CI interviews 
were rated as being less manipulative and less coercive than interviews conducted in a more 
typical police fashion. 
A second benefit of the CI's asking primarily open-ended questions is that victims can almost 
always provide some information in response to open-ended questions (e.g., "What happened?") 
and so they experience some degree of success when answering such questions. In contrast, 
when participating in a conventional interview, victims may be unable to answer some of the 
specific questions ("Was the gun a revolver or an automatic?"), and experience memory failure 
frequently. Similarly, victims should be more successful in communicating their knowledge 
within a CI than in a typical police interview, because the CI allows for more response options 
(e.g., non-verbal responding). Experiencing greater success and less failure in the CI should 
increase victims' feelings of self-efficacy. 
Previewing the Interview. Victims and witnesses often will be anxious about the interview 
process because they are uncertain about what is expected of them and how the process will 
transpire (Sydeman, Cascardi, Poythress, & Ritterbrand, 1997). CI interviewers attempt to reduce 
that uncertainty by previewing the structure of the interview, and especially by explaining the 
"ground rules" of the interview. Furthermore, victims are encouraged to ask questions about the 
process. Foreshadowing the interview should reduce victims' anxiety about the process as it 
reduces uncertainty. 
Interviewer Understanding: A survey of crime victims conducted by the Federal Law 
Enforcement Training Center found that the primary concern of victims was that someone should 
understand their plight. They were more concerned that the investigator understand their 
personal experience than for the investigator to solve the crime—presumably the investigator's 
primary concern. This concern is likely thwarted by the typical police interviewer who spends 
only minimal time developing rapport and proceeds through the interview by asking many short-
answer factual details (Fisher et al, 1987). By comparison, CI interviewers make a more 
concerted effort throughout the interview and in follow-up sessions to develop a strong sense of 
personal concern. Following such a humane policy ought to promote a sense of dignity for the 
victim and a belief that the interviewer is concerned about the victim's plight and is not merely 
fulfilling his/her official responsibility as a criminal investigator. We expect this victim-as-a-
