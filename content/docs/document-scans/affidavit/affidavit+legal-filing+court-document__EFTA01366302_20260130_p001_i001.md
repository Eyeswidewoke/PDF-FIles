• 12 months from the closing of this offering; 
provided in each case that we have an effective registration statement 
under the Securities Act covering the shares of common stock 
Suable upon exercise of the warrants and a current prospectus 
relating to them is available (or we permit holders to exercise their 
warrants on a cashless basis under the circumstances specified in the 
warrant agreement). 
We are not registering the shares of common stock issuable upon 
exercise of the warrants at this time. However, we have agreed that as 
soon as practicable, but in no event later than fifteen (15) business 
days after the closing of our initial business combination, we will use 
our best efforts to file with the SEC and have an effective registration 
statement coveting the shares of common stock issuable upon 
exercise of the warrants, and to maintain a current prospectus relating 
to those shares of common stock until the warrants expire or arc 
redeemed; provided. that if our common stock is at the time of any 
exercise of a warrant not listed on a national securities exchange such 
that it satisfies the definition of a "covered security" under Section 
18(bX I) of the Securities Act, we may, at our option, require holders 
of public warrants who exercise their warrants to do so on a "cashless 
basis" in accordance with Section 3(aX9) of the Securities Act and. 
in the event we so elect, we will not be required to file or maintain in 
effect a registration statement. 
The warrants will expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, five 
yews after the completion of our initial business combination or 
earlier upon redemption or liquidation. On the exercise of any 
warrant. the warrant exercise price will be paid directly to us and not 
placed in the trust account. 
Redemption of warrants 
Once the warrants become exercisable, we may redeem the 
outstanding warrants (except as described herein with respect to the 
private placement warrants): 
• in whole and not in part; 
• at a price of $0.01 per warrant: 
II 
• upon a minimum of 30 days' prior written notice of redemption. 
which we refer to as the 30-day redemption period; and 
• if. and only if, the last sale price of our common stock equals or 
exceeds $24.00 per share for any 20 trading days within a 30-
trading day period ending on the thin.' trading day prior to the date 
on which we send the notice of redemption to the warrant holders. 
We will not redeem the warrants unless an effective registration 
statement under the Securities Act covering the shares of common 
stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants is effective and a current 
prospectus relating to those shares of common stock is available 
throughout the 30-day redemption period, except if the warrants may 
be exercised on a cashless basis and such cashless exercise is exempt 
from registration under the Securities Act. If and when the warrants 
become redeemable by us. we may exercise our redemption right
