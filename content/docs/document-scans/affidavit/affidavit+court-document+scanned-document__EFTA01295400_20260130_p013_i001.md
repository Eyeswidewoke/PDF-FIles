directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or by the shareholders. 
Expenses incurred in defending a civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding may be paid by the 
Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding as authorized by 
the Board of Directors in the specific case upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the 
director, officer, employee or agent to repay such amounts unless it shall ultimately be determined 
that he is entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as herein authorized. 
The indemnification herein provided by this Section shall not be deemed exclusive of any other 
rights to which those seeking indemnification may be entitled under any By-law, agreement, vote of 
shareholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity and as 
to action in another capacity while holding such office, and shall continue as to a person who has 
ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of his heirs, 
executors and administrators of such person. 
The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a 
director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the 
Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint 
venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against him and incurred by him in 
any such capacity, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have 
the power to indemnify him against such liability under the provisions above set forth. 
For purposes of this Article, references to "the Corporation" shall include, in addition to the 
resulting corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a constituent) 
absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate existence had continued, would have 
had power and authority to indemnify its directors, officers, and employees or agents, so that any 
person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of such constituent corporation, or is or 
was serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of 
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, shall stand in the same 
position under the provisions of this Section with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as 
he would have with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate existence had continued. 
The amount of indemnity to which any officer or Director may be entitled shall be fixed by 
the Board of Directors, except that in any case where there is no disinterested majority of the Board 
available, the amount shall be fixed by arbitration pursuant to the then existing rules of the 
American Arbitration Association.
