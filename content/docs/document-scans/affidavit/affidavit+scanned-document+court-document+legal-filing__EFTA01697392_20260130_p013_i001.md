• 
Expert search warrants describing highly predictable offender characteristics should only be used 
for subjects exhibiting preferential sexual behavior patterns. The characteristics, dynamics, and 
techniques (i.e., expert search warrant, etc.) discussed concerning preferential sex offenders 
should be considered with any of the preferential types of computer offenders (i.e., pedophile, 
diverse or latent). It is usually unnertscary to distinguish which type of preferential offender is 
involved. 
Whenever possible, affidavits for search warrants should be based on reliable, case-specific facts. 
Because of legal uncertainties, expert search warrants should be used only when absolutely 
necessary. They should not be a replacement for reasonable investigation. When such warrants 
are used, the affidavit must reflect the specific facts and details of the case in question. 
Boilerplate warrants or "go-bys" should be avoided. It is also best if the expert used is part of the 
investigation or from the local area. Regional or national experts should be used only when a 
local expert is unavailable.

Staleness of Probable Cause 
Because of delays in communicating details from proactive investigations, staleness is a common 
problem in computer exploitation cases. It may take weeks or months for the details learned from 
an undercover Internet investigation in one part of the country to be disseminated to investigators 
with jurisdiction over the target computer in another part of the country. Obviously, the best way 
to address the staleness of probable cause is to "freshen" it up with current investigation and 
information. 
As stated above, staleness can also be addressed with an "expert" search warrant. Before doing 
so, prosecutors should do legal research and be aware of appellate decisions that support this 
approach. They should also be aware of Congressional "Finding" #12 in the Child Pornography 
Prevention Act (CPPA) of 1996 that states, "prohibiting the possession and viewing of child 
pornography will encourage the possessors of such material to rid themselves of or destroy the 
material..." I am not sure what this "finding" is based on, but it is contrary to my many years of 
experience studying preferential sex offenders, and contrary to what is usually stated in such 
expert search warrants. 
Another way to address staleness is to recognize that the information in question may not be stale. 
It is a matter of differing opinion as to when the informational basis for probable cause becomes 
stale. Some prosecutors say in days. Others say weeks, most say months. I believe that the time 
interval varies based on the type of information. Because of characteristics of technology and 
human behavior, probable cause about information on a computer should not even be considered 
stale for at least one year. It is not easy to effectively delete the information on a computer, even 
when you try. Furthermore, most people do not delete the information on a regular basis. Such 
editing of a computer is likely to occur less often than cleaning out the garage, attic, or basement. 
Because this is a common human characteristic, it should not require the opinion of an expert.
