will have four "independent directors". Messrs. Kerr. DiCamillo. Anthos and Wein, as defined in the NASDAQ 
listing standards and applicable SEC rules. Our independent directors will have regularly scheduled meetings at 
which only independent directors are present

Executive Officer and Director Compensation 
None of our executive officers, directors or director nominees have received any cash (or non-cash) 
compensation for services rendered to us. Commencing on the date that our securities are first listed on the 
NASDAQ through the earlier of consummation of our initial business combination and our liquidation, we will 
pay our sponsor a total of $10,000 per month for office space, utilities and administrative support. Our sponsor, 
executive officers and directors, or any of their iespxtive affiliates, will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket 
expenses incurred in connection with activities on our behalf such as identify ing potential target businesses and 
performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. Our independent directors will review on a quarterly 
basis all payments that were made to our sponsor, officers, directors or our or their affiliates. 
We may pay a member of our combined team (or an entity affiliated with a member of our combined team) a 
fee for financial advisory services rendered in connection with our identification, negotiation and consummation 
of our initial business combination. The fee will only be payable upon closing of our initial business combination, 
and may be paid out of the offering proceeds deposited in the trust account. The per-share amount distributed to 
any redeeming stockholders upon the completion of our initial business combination will not be reduced as a 
result of such fee. A majority of disinterested directors will determine the nature and amount of such fee, which 
will be based upon the prevailing market rate for similar services negotiated at aims' length for such transactions 
at such time, but will in no event exceed $3,000,000 in the aggregate. Any such foe will also be subject to the 
review of our audit committee pursuant to the audit committee's policies and procedures relating to transactions 
that may present conflicts of interest. No such fee will be payable to our Chief Executive Officer. 
After the completion of our initial business combination, directors or members of our management team who 
remain with us may be paid consulting, management or other fees from the combined company. All of these fees 
will be fully disclosed to stockholders, to the extent then known, in the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation 
materials furnished to our stockholders in connection with a proposed business combination. It is unlikely the 
amount of such compensation will be known at the time, because the directors of the post-combination business 
will be responsible for determining executive and director compensation. Any compensation to be paid to our 
officers will be determined by a compensation committee constituted solely by independent directors. 
We do not intend to take any action to ensure that members of our management team maintain their positions 
with us after the consummation of our initial business combination, although it is possible that some or all of our 
executive officers and directors may negotiate employment or consulting arrangements to remain with us after the 
initial business combination. The existence or terms of any such employment or consulting arrangements to retain 
their positions with us may influence our management's motivation in identifying or selecting a target business 
but we do not believe that the ability of our management to remain with us after the consummation of our initial 
business combination will be a determining factor in our decision to proceed with any potential business 
combination. We arc not party to any agreements with our executive officers and directors that provide for 
benefits upon termination of employment. 
Committees of the Board of Directors 
Upon the effective date of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms part, our board of 
directors will have two standing committees: an audit committee and a compensation committcc. Our audit 
committee will be composed of three independent directors and our compensation committee will be composed 
solely of independent directors. 
Audit Committee 
Upon the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part, we will establish an 
audit committee of the board of directors. Messrs. DiCamillo. Kerr and 
106 
Weiss will serve as members of our audit committee. Mr. DiCamillo will serve as chairman of the audit 
committee. Under the NASDAQ listing standards and applicable SEC rules, we are required to have three 
members of the audit committee. The rules of NASDAQ and Rule I0A-3 of the Exchange Act require that the 
audit committee of a listed company be comprised solely of independent directors. All members named inin this 
committee are independent.
