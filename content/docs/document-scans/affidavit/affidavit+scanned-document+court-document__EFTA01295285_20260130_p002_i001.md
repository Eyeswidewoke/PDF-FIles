SECTION If 
CAPITAL STRUCTURE: MEMBERSHIP UNITS AND 
CONTRIBUTIONS/TRANSFER OF MEMBERSHIP UNITS 
A. Capital Contribution by the Sole Member, Initial Issuance. The Sole Member's 
ownership rights in the Company shall be reflected in "Membership Units," as recorded in the 
Company's records. Upon the formation of the Company, the Sole Member shall make a capital 
contribution to the capital of the Company in the amount of cash, or of the property-in-kind, or both, 
set forth opposite the Sole Member's name on the Schedule of Capital Contributions attached 
hereto. The Company shall thereupon issue to the Sole Member that number of Membership Units 
so subscribed and contributed for as reflected on said Schedule. The Sole Member may make 
additional capital contributions from time to time and at any time and in any amounts that he may 
desire. 
B. 
Transfer of Membership Units. Subject to the provisions of this Section, a Member 
may transfer and assign any or all of his Membership Units to any one or more persons or entities, 
at any time and from time to time. The transfer and assignment of a Membership Unit does not, 
in and of itself, entitle the assignee to participate in the management and affairs of the Company 
or to become a member. Such assignee is only entitled to receive, to the extent assigned, the 
distributions the assigning Member would otherwise be entitled to, and such assignee shall only 
become an assignee of a Membership Unit and not a substitute Member. An assignee of a 
Membership Unit shall be admitted as a substitute Member and shall be entitled to all the rights 
and powers of the assignor only if all the Members consent. If admitted, the substitute Member, 
has to the extent assigned, all of the rights and powers, and is subject to all of the restrictions and 
liabilities, of a Member of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of 
any other Member, the Sole Member may, by a duly executed agreement with the assignee, 
assign any or all of the Membership Units and any or all of the Membership Interest then held by 
the Sole Member, together with the Sole Member's management and voting rights in the 
Company with respect to the Membership Units and Membership Interest so assigned, and, upon 
the consummation of such assignment, the assignee thereof shall be automatically admitted as a 
substitute member, with all of the rights and powers held by, and subject to all of the restrictions 
and liabilities imposed upon, the Sole Member immediately prior to such assignment, to the full 
extent of the Membership Units and Membership Interest so assigned. 
C. 
No Interest; No Return of Capital. Capital contributions to the Company shall not 
earn interest, except as otherwise expressly provided for in this Agreement. Except as otherwise 
provided in this Agreement, a Member shall not be entitled to withdraw, or to receive a return of, a 
capital contribution or any portion thereof; provided, however, that, subject to the provisions of 
Section IV hereof, the Sole Member shall from time to time and at any time, in the Sole Member's 
discretion, be entitled to withdraw, and receive a return of, all or any part of the Sole Member's 
capital contribution.
