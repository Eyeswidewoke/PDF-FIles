Sending state: W35755 Receiving state#: 
I, JEFFREY E. EPSTEIN, am applying for transfer of my parole/probation/other supervision from FLORIDA (sending 
state) to US VIRGIN ISLAND (receiving state). I understand that this transfer of supervision will be subject to the rules of the 
Interstate Commission for Adult Offender Supervision. 
I understand that my supervision in another state may be different than the supervision I would be subject to in this state. I agree 
to accept any differences that may exist because I believe that transferring my supervision to FLORIDA (receiving state) will 
improve my chances for making a good adjustment in the community. I ask that the authorities to whom this application is 
made recognize this fact and grant my request for transfer of supervision. 
In support of my application for transfer, I make the following statements: 
I . If I am allowed to transfer my supervision to US VIRGIN ISLAND (receiving state), I plan to live with CURTIS 
AND SILVINA ROYSTONcat (full address/telybon? #) (340)M8100 uptil I 
all wed by the supervismisof.....2
authorities to change my residence. Lel Itfr er• James -s-wana

2. 
I will comply with the terms and conditions of my supervision that have been placed on me, or that will be placed on 
me by FLORIDA (sending state) and US VIRGIN ISLAND (receiving state). 
3. I understand that if I do not comply with all the terms and conditions that the sending state or the receiving state, or 
both, placed on me, that it will be considered a violation and I may be returned to the sending state. 
4. I agree to the release of any drug or alcohol treatment information from FLORIDA (sending state) to any authorized 
person in US VIRGIN ISLAND (receiving state) for the purpose of transferring my supervision. This consent 
remains in effect from this date 6/1/2009 (today's date) until I revoke this consent. 
5. I agree to return to FLORIDA (sending state) at any time I am directed to by the sending state or the receiving state. I 
know that I may have a constitutional right to insist that the sending state extradite me from the receiving state or any 
other state where I may be found. This is commonly called the right to extradition. But I also understand and 
acknowledge that I have agreed to return to the sending state when ordered to do so either by the sending or receiving 
state. Therefore, I agree that I will not resist or fight any effort by any state to return me to the sending state and I 
AGREE TO WAIVE ANY RIGHT I MAY HAVE TO EXTRADITION. I WAIVE THIS RIGHT FREELY, 
VOLUNTARILY AND INTELLIGENTLY.
