into letter agreements with us. pursuant to which they have agreed to 
waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and 
public shares in connection with the completion of our initial 
business combination. 
Manner of conducting redemptions 
We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to 
redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of 
our initial business combination either (i) in connection with a 
stockholder meeting called to approve the business combination or 
(ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will 
seek stockholder approval of a proposed business combination or 
conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, 
and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the 
transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us 
to seek stockholder approval under the law or stock exchange listing 
requirement. Asset acquisitions and stock purchases would not 
typically require stockholder approval while direct mergers with our 
company where we do not survive and any transactions where we 
issue more than 20.0% of our outstanding common stock or seek to 
amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation would 
require stockholder approval. We intend to conduct redemptions 
without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the 
SEC unless stockholder approval is required by law or stock 
exchange listing requirement or we choose to seek stockholder 
approval for business or other legal reasons. 
If a stockholder vote is not required and we do not decide to hold a 
stockholder vote for business or other legal reasons, we will, 
pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation 
• conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 130-4 and Regulation 
14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers, and 
18 
• file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our 
initial business combination which contain substantially the same 
financial and other information about the initial business 
combination and the nxlemption rights as is required under 
Regulation I4A of the Exchange Act. which regulates the 
solicitation of proxies. 
Upon the public announcement of our business combination, if we 
elect to conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, we or 
our sponsor will terminate any plan established in accordance with 
Rule 10b5-1 to purchase shares of our common stock in the open 
market, in order to comply with Rule 14e-S under the Exchange Act. 
In the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer 
rules, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business 
days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act. and 
we will not be permitted to complete our initial business combination 
until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender 
offer will be conditioned on public stockholders not tendering more 
than a specified number of public shares. which number will be basal 
on the requirement that we may not redeem public shares in an 
amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than 
$5,000.001 (so that we arc not subject to the SEC's "penny taock-
