ADPT's weak :1O /:pc.,.->es several key issues related to the overall business 
Adeptus Health Inc (ADPT: DB not rated), MPW's 6th largest tenant at -5% of 
Vlad Fludnyl,kv 
revenue (pro-forma for post 2Q acquisitions) postponed yesterday morning's 
stock and likely the major contributor to MPW's -6.2% decline (RMZ -2.2%). 
Once the results were out, the shares dropped another -50% in after hours 
planned earnings release to aftermarket hours, driving an 11% sell-off in the 
trading as ADPT reported weak 3O results with several significant issues 
affecting the company, and announced an emergency infusion of capital by 
insiders. While some of the significant decline in EBITDA was tied to the 
transitional nature of ADPT's recent strategic shift, we were surprised by the 
weakened balance sheet as well as the liquidity issues caused by significant 
mismanagement of bill collections and the capital intensive nature of recent 
hospital openings. ADPT also cut their adjusted EBITDA guidance by -34% at 
the midpoint on lower-than-expected patient volumes in non-hospital 
outpatient markets, higher-than-expected cash outlays for its three recent 
hospital openings, and a substantial increase in days sales outstanding. 
Worst case scenario 5.:t8;ciest 
cio,,c013840 Li; 2017 FAD. dividend covered 
Assuming a worst case scenario in which Adeptus ceases to exist, we estimate 
a roughly 11% hit (-14c) to our current 2017 FAD estimate. Our downside 
estimate assumes a total loss of all in-place ADPT revenue ($8.2MM in 2O) and 
the elimination of all developments tied to ADPT. Importantly, the FAD payout 
ratio would still be a manageable 80%. We think a total loss of ADPT income is 
extremely bearish given healthy rent coverage of 2.85x and MPW's geographic 
exposure within the ADPT portfolio which is skewed toward Dallas, Houston, 
and Colorado, whereas the weakest volumes for ADPT appear to have been in 
the San Antonio and Austin markets where MPW has 7 assets in development. 
Disk:reward remains attractive despite significant headline 
We have been assuming about a 3.5x FAD multiple discount to MPW's small 
cap healthcare REIT peers to account for heightened risks associated with the 
hospital industry, equating to a 12.3x multiple. Should a worst case scenario 
for ADPT unfold we could easily see MPW trade even lower in the near term. 
We think another 1.5x haircut to our 12.3x baseline multiple could be 
reasonable in such a scenario equating to a 1 standard deviation drop to our 
baseline. 10.8x on our worst case 2017 FAD estimate of $1.15 would equate to 
$12.42/sh or another 5% decline in the stock. Contrast this with our new target 
price of $15/sh and we continue to believe the risk/reward is favorable for 
MPW despite obvious and serious headline risks. 
1.0vv,‘JiEng IP to reflect heightened ADM' risk. Inaintain Buy 
To reflect the heightened risks tied to Adeptus, we are increasing our FAD 
discount to peers by 0.5x to 4.0x, which combined with the recent REIT sell-off 
equates to 11.8x our 2017 FAD estimate & moves our TP for MPW to $15 from 
$17. Key risks include the ongoing DoJ investigation of top tenant Prime 
Healthcare, 
continued 
pressure on Adeptus, 
above-avg government 
reimbursement risk, and rate sensitivity.
