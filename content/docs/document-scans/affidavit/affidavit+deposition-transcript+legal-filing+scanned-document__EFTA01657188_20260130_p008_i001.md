Domestic Investigations and Operations Guide 
§ 14 
appropriate case or division file(s). FBI employees cannot report allegations to their 
FO/FBIHQ division heads or designee in lieu of properly disseminating information pursuant 
to DIOG subsections 14.8.2 and 14.8.3, nor are they permitted to ask their FO/FBIHQ 
division heads or designee to make such reports on their behalf. It is the responsibility of the 
reporting FBI employee to disseminate information to SLIT LE agencies and to document 
both the information itself and the dissemination thereof. FO/FBIHQ division heads are 
responsible for ensuring employees take appropriate action to protect the safety of children 
and comply with this policy. 
14.8.9 
(U) DOCUMENTATION OF CHILD VICTIM INFORMATION 
(U) Child victims are a particularly vulnerable subset of victims, and should be given the utmost 
consideration in regards to protection of their privacy. Child sexual abuse material (CSAM) and 
identifying information of a child victim may only be transmitted to those with a need to know 
the information while in the performance of official duties related to an investigation or 
prosecution. Refer to the AGG-VWA  and 18 U.S.C. § 3509 for additional information regarding 
child victims' and child witnesses' rights. 
(U//FOUO) All documentation in FBI systems of record (i.e., Sentinel) made pursuant to the 
subsection above involving the identity of a child victim must include the "Child Victim and 
Child Witness Identity Information" legal caveat. It is best practice for documents in Sentinel to 
include a child victim's full identifying information (name and date of birth) the first time the 
child is mentioned in a document, followed by the designation "(Minor — Protect Identity)" and a 
subsequent anonymization of the victim's identity (e.g., Minor Victim 1, MV I, etc.). It is no 
longer best practice to use a victim's initials as a method of anonymization. 
14.9 
(U) SUSPECTED ABUSE OF THE ELDERLY OR OTHERWISE VULNERABLE 
INDIVIDUALS - DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION 
14.9.1 
(U) OVERVIEW AND APPLICABILITY 
(U) Consistent with The Attorney General Guidelines for Victim and Witness Assistance all FBI 
employees—regardless of job function, position, or title—are mandatory reporters of suspected 
abuse against the elderly and otherwise vulnerable individuals. As defined in DIOG Appendix Q, 
this includes, but is not limited to, operational or administrative professional staff employees, 
IAs, SAs, TFOs, TFMs, TFPs, detailees, and contractors. See DIOG Appendix Q for further 
relevant definitions. 
(U) As used throughout DIOG subsection 14.9, "suspected abuse against the elderly and 
otherwise vulnerable individuals" is defined as the willful affliction of physical, psychological, 
or pecuniary harm to elderly or otherwise vulnerable individuals. The AGG-VWA specifically 
states that the grounds for reporting abuse may include "physical evidence of abuse, sudden 
personality changes, disinterest in old habits, and signs of caregiver neglect." Allegations of 
fraud or swindle in which elderly or otherwise vulnerable individuals are deceived by criminal 
actors (e.g., reports of investment scams, tech support scams, business email compromise, 
confidence or romance scams, government impersonation scams, and other scams) are not 
reportable abuse under this policy. 
(U) FBI employees do not need to personally witness or observe (i.e., hear or see) specific 
activities in order to suspect abuse. Rather, the requirements under DIOG subsection 14.9 apply 
when FBI employees learn of facts during the course of their official duties that give them reason
