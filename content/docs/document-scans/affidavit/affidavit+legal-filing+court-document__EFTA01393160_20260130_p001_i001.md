Credit Default Options and 
Credit Default Basket Options 
Credit default options are based on debt securities of 
one or more issuers or guarantors other than the U.S. Trea-
sury. A significant difference between such debt secunties 
and Treasury securities is the non-negligible risk that an 
issuer or guarantor of debt securities other than Treasury 
securities may default on its obligations. For example, the 
issuer might not pay the full interest and face amount of the 
securities when due or might file lor bankruptcy, thereby 
making it nearly certain that it will not make timely payment 
of the full interest and face amount. Financial market partici-
pants call this credit risk. Credit risk is an important compo-
nent of the value of most debt securities. 
Credit default options relate to the credit risk presented 
by one or more specified debt securities. called reference 
obligation(s), of one or more specified issuers or guarantors, 
each of which Is called a reference entity. The reference 
obligation(s) and each reference entity for a class of credit 
default options are selected by the listing options market. 
When a credit default option is based on reference obliga-
tion(s) of more than one issuer or guarantor it is referred to 
as a credit default basket option. There are further variations 
on credit default basket options as described below. 
A credit default option is automatically exercised and 
pays a fixed cash settlement amount if a credit event is 
confirmed for one or more reference obligations of a refer-
ence entity prior to expiration of the option. The reference 
obligations of a reference entity may include all of the out-
standing debt securities constituting general obligations of 
the reference entity or direct claims on the reference entities 
(excluding any non-recourse debt). A credit event includes a 
failure to make a payment on a reference obligation as well 
as certain other events that the listing options market may 
secretly at the time a class ol Credit default options is listed. 
The specified credit events will be defined in accordance 
with the terms of the reference obligation(s). However, not 
every event that might constitute an event of default by the 
reference entity under the terms of the reference obligations 
will necessanly be specified by the listing options market as 
a credit event. Investors should be certain that they under-
stand the various possible events that will or will not consti-
tute credit events. The determination of whether a particular 
event meets the criteria of a credit event, however defined. 
for a specific credit default option is within the sole discretion 
of the listing options market. 
In order to result In automatic exercise of the option, a 
credit event must be confirmed to have occurred during the 
covered period (i.e., the period between the initial listing of 
the series of options and the time specified by the options 
market as the last day of trading of the option series prior to 
the expiration date). An event that would otherwise be 
deemed a credit event will not result in an exercise of the 
option it it occurs either before or after this period. A series of 
credit default options ordinarily does not expire until a speci-
fied number of business days following the end of the cov-
ered period in order to provide the listing options market an 
opportunity to confirm whether or not a credit event
