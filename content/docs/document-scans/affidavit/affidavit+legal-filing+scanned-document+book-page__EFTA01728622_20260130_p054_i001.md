Acquaintance-Exploitation Cases 
This chapter, formerly titled "Child Sex Rings," discusses cases in which multiple 
children are sexually exploited by acquaintances. The majority of offenders who 
simultaneously sexually victimize multiple children are acquaintance child 
molesters, and most acquaintance child molesters who victimize multiple chil-
dren are preferential sex offenders. Recognizing, understanding, and managing 
these dynamics are crucial to the proper investigation and prosecution of these 
cases. Cases involving multiple child victims are sometimes referred to as child 
sex rings. Many people have extreme and stereotypical ideas of what a child sex 
ring is. They believe it must involve organized groups buying and selling children 
and shipping them around the country or the world for sexual purposes. In 
this publication the term child sex ring is simply defined as one or more offend-
ers simultaneously involved sexually with several child victims. Because of 
the stereotypical images conjured up by the term, however, its use will be kept to 
a minimum. 
Acquaintance-exploitation cases with multiple victims need not have a com-
mercial component or mean group sex. Although that has happened in some 
cases, it is more likely that the offender is sexually interacting with the children 
one at a time. The offender more than likely has sex with other children before 
terminating the sexual relationship with prior victims. The activity can involve 
any of the wide range of "sexual" behaviors discussed in this publication. The 
various child victims being molested during a certain period of time usually know 
each other but may or may not know that the offender is having sex with the 
other children. Some may believe they are the only ones having a "special" rela-
tionship with the offender. Other victims may actually witness the sexual activity 
of the offender with other children. Offenders may have favorite victims that 
they treat differently than the other victims. 
Acquaintance-exploitation cases with multiple victims need not involve highly 
structured or organized groups such as organized crime, satanic cults, or pedo-
phile organizations. In Child Pornography and Sex Rings, Dr. Ann W. Burgess set 
forth the dynamics of child sex rings (Burgess, 1984). Dr. Burgess's research iden-
tified three types of child sex rings. They are solo, transition, and syndicated. In 
the solo ring the offender keeps the activity and photographs completely secret. 
Each ring involves one offender and multiple victims. In the transition ring 
offenders begin to share their experiences, pornography, or victims. Photographs 
and letters are traded, and victims may be tested by other offenders and eventu-
ally traded for their sexual services. In the syndicated ring a more structured 
organization recruits children, produces pornography, delivers direct sexual ser-
vices, and establishes an extensive network of customers. In the United States 
even the syndicated-type rings rarely have a hierarchical structure with a clear 
chain of command. They are more likely to be informal networks of individuals 
who share a common sexual interest and will betray each other in a minute if it 
helps their criminal case.
