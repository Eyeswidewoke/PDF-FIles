and, therefore, is in violation of their right to Equal Protection of the laws under the Fourteenth 
Amendment to the United States Constitution. Finally, in their complaint, the plaintiffs request 
that this Court: photograph, fingerprints, palm prints, a DNA sample, telephone numbers, a 
description of every vehicle registered to or operated by the registrant, a copy of the driver's 
license, social security number, date of birth, a description of physical characteristics, email 
addresses and other online identifiers, temporary lodging information regarding any place the 
registrant plans to stay for seven or more days; (3) pay an annual registration fee of $60.00 to 
every law enforcement agency with which she or he is registered; failure to do so subjects the 
registrant to prosecution; (4) disclose the fact of their sex offender registration to all members of 
the communities in which they live, work, study and worship; school principals must post notices 
in conspicuous areas in schools with the registrant's name, address, and crime of conviction; (5) 
notify landlords, the superintendent of any park or playground near the registrant's home; the 
registrant's name, address, and crime of conviction must be posted in a conspicuous area in the 
park or playground; (6) carry a special identification card issued by the Department of Public 
Safety and Corrections that includes the words "SEX OFFENDER" in bright orange capital 
letters at all time; failure to obtain and renew this card annually constitutes a misdemeanor; (7) 
obtain a driver's license or non-driver's state identification card that features the words "SEX 
OFFENDER" in bright orange capital letters; (8) contact the sheriff's office or police 
department if they change residences or are absent for more than 30 days; (9) appear in person at 
the sheriff's office three days prior to leaving the registered residence to provide information 
regarding temporary lodging information if the registrant plans to stay somewhere other than his 
or her registered address for seven or more days; (10) register, renew, and update registration 
and comply with all requirements of the registry law or face prosecution for failure to do so, 
which may include incarceration for up to 20 years at hard labor; criminal liability attaches 
irrespective of the reason for failure to comply, such as inability to pay for registration or 
delivery of notification postcards, or homelessness. 8 a. b. c. d. e. f. g. certify this case as a class 
action; declare that La.R.S. § 15:542(A)(1)(a) violates the Equal Protection Clause of the 
Fourteenth Amendment insofar as it requires all individuals convicted of Crime Against Nature 
by Solicitation to register as sex offenders; order defendants to permanently remove the named 
plaintiffs and class members from the sex offender registry; order defendants to expunge all state 
records that document in any fashion that plaintiffs were ever registered as sex offenders; order 
defendants to alert all agencies who were provided information regarding the registration of 
plaintiffs and all members of the plaintiff class as sex offenders that this information is no longer 
valid; grant plaintiffs authority to monitor defendants' compliance with any injunctive relief 
ordered by the Court; award attorneys' fees and costs. The defendants now seek dismissal of the 
plaintiffs' lawsuit, invoking the doctrine of sovereign immunity; arguing that the plaintiffs have 
failed to adequately allege standing; and, in the alternative, contending that the plaintiffs fail to 
state a claim for relief because they have not pleaded a violation of the Constitution. The 
plaintiffs, on the other hand, now request that this Court certify a class of persons consisting of 
all persons who were convicted under the Louisiana Crime Against Nature by Solicitation 
Statute, La.R.S. § 14:89(A)(2) or 14:89.2(A), for solicitation of oral or anal sex for 
compensation prior to August 15, 2011 and, as a result, have been or will be subject to sex 
offender registration requirements under Louisiana's Registration of Sex Offender Law, La.R.S. 
§§ 15:540-15:553. The plaintiffs also seek summary judgment in their favor. The only issues that 
have been adequately briefed to the Court deal with the motion to dismiss. 9 I. A. Motions filed 
under Rule 12(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure allow a party to challenge the
