Table of Contents 
Safeway ABL Facility exceed (i) the aggregate commitments or (ii) the then-current borrowing base, and (b) in an amount equal to 100% 
of the net cash proceeds of certain asset sales, casualty events and other dispositions of ABS/Safeway ABL Priority Collateral (to the 
extent of the type included in the borrowing base) (or under certain circumstances, the amount advanced or available to be advanced 
against the ABS/Safeway ABL Priority Collateral subject to the sale, casualty or other disposition). 
Interest. Amounts outstanding under the ABS/Safeway ABL Agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at our option 
(a) the base rate, plus an applicable margin equal to (i) 0.50% (if daily average excess availability during the most recently ended fiscal 
quarter is greater than 66% of the aggregate commitments), (ii) 0.75% (if daily average excess availability during the most recently 
ended fiscal quarter is less than or equal to 66% of the aggregate commitments, but greater than or equal to 20% of the aggregate 
commitments), or (iii) 1.00% (if daily average excess availability during the most recently ended fiscal quarter is less than 20% of the 
aggregate commitments), or (b) the LIBOR rate, plus an applicable margin equal to (i) 1.50% (if daily average excess availability during 
the most recently ended fiscal quarter is greater than 66% of the aggregate commitments), (ii) 1.75% (if daily average excess availability 
during the most recently ended fiscal quarter is less than or equal to 66% of the aggregate commitments, but greater than or equal to 
20% of the aggregate commitments), or (iii) 2.00% (if daily average excess availability during the most recently ended fiscal quarter is 
less than 20% of the aggregate commitments). If not paid when due, the ABS/Safeway ABL Facility bears interest at the rate otherwise 
applicable to such loans at such time plus an additional 2% per annum during the continuance of such payment event of default and the 
letter of credit fees increase by 2%. Other overdue amounts bear interest at a rate equal to the rate otherwise applicable to such 
revolving loans bearing interest at the base rate at such time, plus 2% until such amounts are paid in full. 
Guarantees. Subject to certain exceptions, the amounts outstanding under the ABS/Safeway ABL Agreement are guaranteed by 
Albertson's Holdings and each of its existing and future direct and indirect wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries that are not borrowers. 
Security. Subject to certain exceptions, the obligations under the ABS/Safeway ABL Agreement are secured by (a) a first-priority 
security interest in and lien on ABS/Safeway ABL Priority Collateral and (b) a third-priority security interest in and lien on substantially all 
other assets (other than real property). 
Fees. Certain customary fees are payable to the lenders and the agents under the ABS/Safeway ABL Agreement, including a 
commitment fee on the average daily unused amount of the ABS/Safeway ABL Facility, in an amount equal to (a) 0.25% per annum if 
such average daily excess availability amount during the most recently ended fiscal quarter is less than 50% of the aggregate 
commitments and (b) 0.375% per annum if such average daily excess availability amount during the most recently ended fiscal quarter is 
greater than or equal to 50% of the aggregate commitments. 
Affirmative and Negative Covenants.
