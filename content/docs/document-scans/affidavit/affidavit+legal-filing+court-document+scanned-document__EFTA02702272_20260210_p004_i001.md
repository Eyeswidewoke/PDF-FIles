RISK FACTORS 
Before you invest in the debentures, you should carefully consider the risks involved. Accordingly, you 
should carefully, consider the information contained in or incorporated by reference into this prospectus 
supplement and the accompanying prospectus, including the risk factors listed below and in our Annual Report 
on Form 10 -K for the year ended December 31,2015 and in the other documents incorporated by reference in 
this prospectus supplement. 
Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our 
obligations under the debentures. 
We have now and, after the offering, will continue to have a significant amount of indebtedness. On 
March 31, 2016. before giving effect to this offering, we had total indebtedness of approximately $2.3 billion, 
including our existing subordinated debentures. 
We may incur additional indebtedness that may adversely affect our ability to meet our financial 
obligations under the debentures. 
The terms of the indenture and the debentures do not impose any limitation on our or our subsidiaries' 
ability to incur additional debt. We may incur additional indebtedness in the future, which could have important 
consequences to holders of the debentures, including the following: 
• we could have insufficient cash to meet our financial obligations, including our obligations under the 
debentures; 
• our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital. capital expenditures or general corporate 
purposes may be impaired; and 
• a significant degree of debt could make us more vulnerable to changes in general economic conditions 
and also could affect the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries. 
We are an insurance holding company and, therefore, may not be able to receive dividends in amounts 
needed to service our debt. 
As an insurance holding company, our principal assets are the shares of capital stock of our insurance 
company subsidiaries. We have to rely on dividends from our insurance company subsidiaries to meet our 
obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations and for paying corporate expenses. 
The payment of dividends by our insurance company subsidiaries is subject to regulatory restrictions and will 
depend on the surplus and future earnings of these subsidiaries, as well as the regulatory restrictions. For 2016. 
the maximum amount of dividends that can be paid without regulatory approval is approximately $684 million, 
of which approximately $584 million has been paid to date. As a result, we may not be able to receive dividends 
from these subsidiaries at times and in amounts necessary to meet our obligations under the debentures. 
Our obligations under the debentures will be subordinated. 
Our payment obligation under the debentures will be unsecured and will rank junior in right of payment and 
upon our liquidation to all of our Senior Indebtedness on the terms set forth in the indenture pursuant to which 
the debentures will be issued. We, therefore, cannot make any payments on the debentures, if (i) we have 
defaulted on the payment of any of our Senior Indebtedness and the default is continuing, (ii) the maturity of any 
Senior Indebtedness has been or would be permitted upon notice or the passage of time to be accelerated as a 
result of a default and the default is continuing and such acceleration has not been rescinded or annulled or 
(iii) we have filed for bankruptcy or are liquidating, dissolving or winding-up or in receivership, and our Senior 
Indebtedness has not been repaid in full.
