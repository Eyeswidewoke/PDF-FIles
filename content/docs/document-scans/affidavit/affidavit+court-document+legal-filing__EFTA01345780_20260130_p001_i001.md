IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR THE AGENT: 
When you accept the authority granted under this Power of Attorney, a special legal relationship is created between you and 
the principal. This relationship imposes on you legal responsibilities that continue until you resign or the Power of Attorney 
Is terminated or revoked. You must 
(1) act according to any instructions from the principal, or, where there are no Instructions, in the principal's best 
interest 
(2) avoid conflicts that would impair your ability to act in the principal' best interest. 
(3) keep the principal's property separate and distinct from any assets you own or control, unless otherwise permitted by 
law; 
(4) keep a record of all receipts, payments, and transactions conducted for the principal; and 
(5) disclose your identity as an agent whenever you act for the principal by writing or printing the principal's name and 
signing your own name as 'agent" in either of the following manner: (Principal's Name) by 
(Your Signature) as 
Agent or (Your Signature) as Agent for (Principal's Name). 
You may not use the principal's assets to benefit yourself or give major gifts to yourself or anyone else unless the principal 
has specifically granted you that authority In this Power of Attorney or in a Statutory Major Gifts Rider attached to this Power 
of Attorney. If you have that authority, you must act according to any instructions of the principal or, where there are no such 
instructions, in the principal's best interest. You may resign by giving written notice to the principal and to any co-agent, 
successor agent, monitor if one has been named in this document or the principal's guardian if one has been appointed. If 
there is anything about this document or your responsibilities that you do not understand, you should seek legal advice. 
Liability of Agent: The meaning of the authority given to you Is defined in New York's General Obligations Law, Article S. Title

may be liable under the law for your violation.
