SOF III - 1081 Southern Financial LLC 
to comply with an exception to the look-through provisions of the Plan Asset Provisions, 
the assets of the Onshore Feeder Fund may be treated as plan assets for purposes of ERISA 
or Section 4975 of the Code, in which event the General Partner and the Investment 
Manager (and any other person with discretionary authority with respect to the assets of the 
Onshore Feeder Fund) could be treated as a fiduciary with respect to the portion of the 
assets of the Onshore Feeder Fund deemed to be plan assets and all transactions of the 
Onshore Feeder Fund would be subject to the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA 
and/or Section 4975 of the Code, which may restrict the Onshore Feeder Fund from 
engaging in certain transactions that may otherwise be beneficial to the Onshore Feeder 
Fund. 
Additional Considerations for Investments Through the Offshore Feeder Fund 
In addition to the considerations set forth in the previous section, which Investors investing 
through the Offshore Feeder Fund should consider, there are additional ERISA 
implications for Investors investing in the Onshore Feeder Fund through the Offshore 
Feeder Fund. Unlike the Onshore Feeder Fund, the Offshore Feeder Fund may be 
considered an ERISA plan asset entity within the meaning of ERISA. However, because 
the Offshore Feeder Fund's sole purpose is to invest in the Onshore Feeder Fund, and no 
discretion is being exercised by the General Partner or the Offshore Feeder Administrator 
with respect to the assets invested in the Offshore Feeder Fund, neither the General Partner 
of the Offshore Feeder Fund nor the Offshore Feeder Administrator will be considered a 
fiduciary to the ERISA plans invested through the Offshore Feeder Fund. Each investor in 
the Offshore Feeder Fund will be required to make certain representations to confirm its 
understanding and agreement with respect to the foregoing. 
The U.S. Department of Labor may disagree with this position, in which event the General 
Partner of the Offshore Feeder Fund (and any other person deemed to have discretionary 
authority with respect to the assets of the Offshore Feeder Fund) could be treated as a 
fiduciary with respect to the portion of the assets of the Offshore Feeder Fund deemed to be 
plan assets and all transactions of the Feeder Funds could be subject to the prohibited 
transaction provisions of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, which may restrict the 
Feeder Funds from engaging in certain transactions that may otherwise be beneficial to the 
Feeder Funds. 
Governmental Plans 
Although federal, state and local governmental pension plans are not subject to ERISA, 
applicable provisions of federal and state law may restrict the type of investments such a 
plan may make or otherwise have an impact on such a plan's ability to invest in the 
Onshore Feeder Fund or the Offshore Feeder Fund. Accordingly, state and local 
governmental pension plans considering an investment in the Onshore Feeder Fund or the 
Offshore Feeder Fund should consult with their counsel regarding their proposed 
investment in the Onshore Feeder Fund or the Offshore Feeder Fund. 
THE FOREGOING DISCUSSION OF ERISA AND CODE ISSUES SHOULD NOT BE 
CONSTRUED AS LEGAL ADVICE. FIDUCIARIES OF PLANS SHOULD CONSULT
