ARTICLE VI 
MEMBERS 
Section 6.1 
Admission of Members. The Managing Member shall hold the 
Closing upon the Managing Member's receipt of Commitments representing not less than $15 
million, which amount may be reduced or waived by the Managing Member in its sole discretion. 
The Managing Member may, at the Closing, and without advance notice to or consent from the 
Members, admit any person, in its sole discretion, who shall agree to be bound by all of the terms 
of this Agreement as a Member. No person shall be admitted as a Member if such person fails to 
pay, when due, the full amount of such Member's Commitment that is accepted by the Managing 
Member, in accordance with Section 2.2. The Managing Member shall have the absolute 
discretion to refuse admission to any person. The Company shall at all times maintain a current 
record of the names and addresses of the Members, the aggregate Capital Contributions of the 
Members and the respective Investment Percentages of the Members. Except as otherwise 
provided in this Agreement (with respect to direct transfers of Interests), after the Closing (i) any 
additional Members may be admitted to the Company only with the consent of all Members, and 
(ii) any such admission of an additional Member shall be evidenced by a written modification to 
this Agreement executed by all then current Members and such additional Member. 
Section 6.2 
Limited Liability. The Members will not be personally liable for any 
obligations of the Company and will have no obligation (including with respect to a deficit balance 
in their Capital Account) to make contributions to the Company, except to the extent required 
under Section 6.6 and the LLC Act. Except to the extent provided in this Agreement, the 
Members will take no part in the control, direction or operation of the affairs of the Company and 
will have no power to bind the Company. 
Section 6.3 
Transfer of Interests. (a) A Member may not sell, exchange, assign, 
transfer, pledge, mortgage or otherwise encumber any or all of its Interest without providing 
proof to the Managing Member's satisfaction of compliance of such action with ERISA, the 
Investment Company Act, the Securities Act, the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, 
and any similar legislation and any policies which the Company and its service providers may 
adopt, including any anti-money laundering policies and unless the Managing Member has 
consented in writing to such sale, exchange, assignment, transfer, pledge, mortgage or other 
encumbrance, provided that, with regard to an assignment by a Member to an Affiliate of such 
Member, such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. 
(b) 
A Member which is a trust under an employee benefit plan may, upon prior 
written notice to the Managing Member, assign a beneficial interest in all or a portion of its 
Interest to any other trust under such employee benefit plan or to any other employee benefit plan 
having the same sponsor (provided that income and loss allocable to the Member of the Company 
will continue to be included in the same filings under the same employer identification number 
with the Internal Revenue Service). Such assignment to another trust under such employee 
benefit plan or to any other employee benefit plan having the same sponsor will not be deemed to 
be an assignment or transfer of an Interest for purposes of this Agreement (and therefore will not 
require the Managing Member's consent pursuant to Section 6.3(a)). In addition, a change in any 
trustee or fiduciary of a Member will not be deemed to be an assignment or transfer of an Interest
