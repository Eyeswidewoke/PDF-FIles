LIBOR rate in effect as of such date (or, if the documentation for such Collateral Obligation 
specifies a designated spread to LIBOR and such spread is less than such difference, such 
spread), (ii) summing the amounts determined pursuant to clause (i), (iii) dividing such sum by 
the Aggregate Principal Balance for all such Collateral Obligations and (iv) adding to such 
percentage the fraction (expressed as a percentage) obtained by dividing (a) the Gross Excess 
Coupon, if any, as of such date by (b) the Aggregate Principal Balance for all such Collateral 
Obligations. With respect to each Collateral Obligation that is a Revolving Loan, the amount 
determined for purposes of clause (i) above will be the sum of the amount calculated as 
described in (iXx) or (y) above for the funded portion of such Collateral Obligation and the 
unfunded principal balance thereof multiplied by the applicable commitment fee rate or spread 
payable with respect to such unfunded portion. With respect to a Partial PIK Obligation, only 
the portion thereof currently paying interest shall be included in clause (i) above. 
"Weighted Average Life Test": A test that will be deemed satisfied as of any date 
of determination if the remaining weighted average life of the Collateral Obligations (other than 
Defaulted Obligations and Deferring P1K Obligations) as of such date is less than or equal to the 
number of years (including any fraction of a year) between such date and January 18, 2017. 
"Weighted Average Rating": 
As of any date of determination, the number 
obtained by (i) multiplying the Aggregate Principal Balance of each Collateral Obligation (other 
than Defaulted Obligations and Deferring PIK Obligations) by the applicable Moody's Rating 
Factor for the related Obligor, (ii) summing the product obtained in clause (i) for all Collateral 
Obligations (other than Defaulted Obligations and Deferring PIK Obligations) and (iii) dividing 
the sum obtained in clause (ii) by the Aggregate Principal Balance of all Collateral Obligations 
(other than Defaulted Obligations and Deferring PIK Obligations). 
"Zero-Coupon Obligation": A debt obligation that, based on its terms at the time 
of determination, does not make periodic payments of interest. A Zero-Coupon Obligation will 
not include an obligation that is a PIK Obligation.

with respect to Scheduled Distributions on any Pledged Obligation, or any payments on any

such Pledged Obligations and on any other amounts that may be received for deposit in the 
Collection Account, the provisions set forth in this Section 1.2 shall be applied. 
(a) 
All calculations with respect to Scheduled Distributions on the Pledged 
Obligations securing the Notes shall be made on the basis of information as to the terms of each 
such Pledged Obligation and upon report of payments, if any, received on such Pledged 
Obligation that are furnished by or on behalf of the issuer of such Pledged Obligation and, to the 
extent they are not manifestly in error, such information or report may be conclusively relied 
upon in making such calculations.
