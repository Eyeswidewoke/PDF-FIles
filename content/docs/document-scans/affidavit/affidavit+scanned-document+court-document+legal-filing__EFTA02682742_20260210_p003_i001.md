This suggests they do not feel safe in the last loyalist stronghold, the oasis of Sebha. Some of the 
tribes there have a history of hostility to the colonel, while the rugged Tuareg people who 
populate a swathe of the Sahara desert from Libya to Mali, and were long favored by the Libyan 
leader with jobs and guns, seem to be abandoning him. Tuareg elders in Mali and Niger, fearing 
an influx of armed brethren, are telling the colonel's soldiers to stay in Libya and join the new 
regime's forces. 
NATO aircraft are continuing their patrols but are less needed, since the rebels now far outgun 
Colonel Qaddafi's forces. Western aircraft have refrained from targeting fleeing loyalists. This 
would fall outside their UN mandate to protect civilians, which in any case ends on September 
27th. Libyans largely praise NATO pilots for their accuracy, dismissing tales of civilian 
casualties as propaganda. Yet government officials say they do not want Libya now to be 
overrun by foreign do-gooders. They want to rebuild the country by themselves. 
The NTC has provisional plans to elect a "national congress" within eight months and draft a 
constitution in its first 60 days. This process, Libyans recognize, is fraught with obstacles. The 
country has little experience of democracy, no political parties, a fragile justice system and 
fledgling free media. The rebel army, made up of some 50 regionally based katibas (brigades) 
with remnants of the professional armed forces, is loosely organized and ill-disciplined. 
Weapons proliferate, including explosives and rockets in unguarded piles. Decades of shambolic 
administration have left a legacy of shoddy infrastructure, tangled bureaucracy and 
administrative incompetence. Tensions persist between regions, between Islamists and 
secularists, and between those demanding a purge of former officials and those counselling 
pragmatic accommodation. 
So far, pragmatism and dialogue seem to have prevailed. Mainstream Islamists, such as the 
economy minister, Abdullah Shamia, speak not of imposing Islamic law but of respecting 
contracts with foreign oil companies, diversifying the economy away from oil dependence, 
wooing investment, and regulating the labor market to block a new influx of migrant workers 
seeking passage to Europe. Most Libyans scoff at the notion that al-Qaeda may gain a foothold. 
Libyan society is already conservative and tradition-bound, they note, as well as religiously 
uniform, observing just one of the four accepted Sunni rites. 
Abdel Hakim Belhaj, Tripoli's new military commander, a veteran of the Libyan Islamic 
Fighting Group denounced by Western governments for having links to al-Qaeda, is widely 
respected. Despite his arrest in Malaysia back in 2004, his alleged torture by the CIA and his 
dispatch to a Libyan prison, he now categorically denies having any ties to al-Qaeda or animosity 
to the West. "We want a civil state that respects the law and rights, a state that applies justice," 
he told Le Monde, a French newspaper. "We will give back our weapons; we are not here to 
establish a Taliban-like regime through a coup." 
Libya has a lot going for it. Even if, as some experts suggest, it takes many months to restore oil 
production to pre-revolution levels, the country may draw on a stash of sovereign foreign assets 
estimated by Mr. Shamia at more than $170 billion. Libya's large and talented exile community, 
which contributed greatly to the revolution, is eager to return and invest. In the eyes of Libyans
