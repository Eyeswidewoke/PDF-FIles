affected by a challenging economic climate, including adverse changes in interest rates, volatile commodity markets and inflation, contraction in 
the availability of credit in the market and reductions in consumer spending. In addition. a slow-down in the general economy or a shift in 
consumer preferences for economic reasons or otherwise to regional, local or Private Label products or other less expensive products may result in 
reduced demand for our products which may affect our profitability. The keeping of pets and the purchase of pet-related products may constitute 
discretionary spending for some of our consumers and any material decline in the amount of consumer discretionary spending may reduce overall 
levels of pet ownership or spending on pets. As a result, a challenging economic climate may cause a decline in demand fa• our products which 
could be disproportionate as compared to competing pet food brands since our products command a price premium. In addition, we cannot predict 
how current or worsening economic conditions will affect our retail partners. suppliers and distributors If economic conditions result in decreased 
spending on pets and have a negative impact on our retail partners. suppliers or distributors, our business, financial condition and results of 
operations may be materially adversely affected. 
Our business depends, in part, on the sufficiency and effectiveness of our marketing and trade promotion programs. 
Due to the highly competitive nature of our induvy, we must effectively and efficiently promote and market our products through 
television. intemet and print advertisements as well as trade promotions and incentives to sustain our competitive position in our market. Marketing 
investments may be costly. In addition, we may, from time to time, change our marketing strategies and spending. including the timing or nature of 
our trade promotions and incentives. We may also change our marketing strategies and spending in response to actions by our competitors and 
other pct food companies. For instance, starting in the second half of 2013. the largest pet food company in the United States initiated a significant 
increase in its promotional spending. which resulted in other pet food companies. including us, increasing their own promotional spending. The 
sufficiency and effectiveness of our marketing and trade promotions and incentives are important to our ability to retain and/or improve our market 
share and margins. If our marketing and trade promotions and incentives are not successful or if we fail to implement sufficient and effective 
marketing and trade promotions and incentives or adequately respond to changes in our competitors' marketing strategies, our business, fmancial 
condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. 
If we are unable to maintain or increase prices, our margins may decrease. 
Our suu s.ss depends in part upon our ability to persuade consumers to purchase our branded products, which generally command a price 
premium as compared to prices of Engineered and Private Label products. Some products in the Engine red market segment may be labeled as 
"natural" in accordance with the AAR:O regulatory definition even though they do not satisfy all the requirements of the Wholesome Natural 
market segment. These products are often priced lower than ours and even if we do not increase prices, consumers may choose to purchase such 
products instead of ours, based on the fact that such products cost less but yet are still labeled as "natural." 
We rely in part on price increases to offset cost increases and improve the profitability of our business. Our ability to maintain prices or 
effectively implement price increases may be affected by a number of factors, including competition, effectiveness of our marketing programs, the 
continuing strength of our brand, market demand and general economic conditions, including inflationary pressures. In particular, in response to 
increased promotional activity by' other pet food companies, we have increased our promotional spending. which has resulted in a lower average 
price per pound for our products and has adversely impacted our gross margins. During challenging economic times, consumers may be less 
willing or able to pay a price premium for our branded products and may shift purchases to lower-priced or other value offerings, making it more 
difficult for us to maintain prices and/or effectively implement price increases. In addition, our retail partners and distributors may pressure us to 
rescind price increases that we have announced or already implemented, whether through a change in list price or increased promotional activity. If 
we are unable to maintain or increase pries for our
