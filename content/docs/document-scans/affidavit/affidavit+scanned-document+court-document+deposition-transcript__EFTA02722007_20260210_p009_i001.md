Al Qaeda's own vision of the Iranian neighbour. Al Qaeda opposed any official relations with 
Tehran, an 'enemy' to be opposed all the time. The goal of Osama bin Laden's organisation 
was to have its own routes out of Afghanistan, independent of the Iranian authorities' 
influence.40 At the end of 1990s, Tehran had more than enough proof that the 'Afghan 
Emirate', whatever the circumstances, would never be a safe neighbour for Iran. 
Contrary to the issues presented above, on this matter, the Iranians had a chance to have a 
critical impact before 9/11. And they did so, as a rational actor eager to protect its interest and 
its security. Such a positive influence was possible because, between the end of 1990s and 
2001, the US and Iran were converging politically on their respective analyses of the Afghan 
situation. At first, American and Iranian diplomats were working together through the six-
plus-two talks, the forum dedicated to find a regional solution to the Afghan issue. And in 
fact, Tehran was much more implacable than Washington in opposing Mullah Omar's 
regime. Before 2001, however worrisome the situation in Afghanistan was, the US did not 
see Afghanistan as a top priority. As for Iran, already by the end of the 1990s, its goal was 
clearly to make sure that this neighbour would be neither a 'rogue' state nor a 'failed' entity. 
Tehran aimed at making sure that the chaos in Afghanistan and its harmful consequences for 
the region would be eradicated once and for all. Of course, after 1998, the Americans already 
began to understand the Iranian approach. After all, summer1998 witnessed not just the 
massacre at Mazar-e Sharif. For the Americans, it was precisely the period when Al Qaeda 
became a serious issue, after the bombings of the US Embassies in Dar es-Salaam and 
Nairobi. After having been ambivalent towards the 'Afghan Emirate', the Americans began 
to understand that Afghanistan was becoming a threat for its own interests. After 9/11, the US 
and Iran grew 'closer', reducing the six-plus-two talks to de facto bilateral consultations via 
what has been called the 'Geneva Contact Group'. 
The Iranians were particularly important for the Americans then. And in that sense, they were 
for a quick victory that could have meant a better future for Afghanistan, especially if the 
idea of stabilising that country had been the primary goal of the US from the beginning of the 
'War on Terror'. 
For the US, the Iranians were, at first, the main bridge with the Northern Alliance in 
Afghanistan. For sure, Teheran was then the only external actor to have had true influence 
over this anti-Taliban coalition inside Afghanistan. After all, Iran had been the main backer 
of this anti-Taliban organisation after the events of 1998. Already, during the winter of 1999, 
Tehran was said to have given millions of US dollars worth of weapons to warlord Ahmad 
Shah Masud. Iran also helped to keep together a group that was highly divided. The Iranians
