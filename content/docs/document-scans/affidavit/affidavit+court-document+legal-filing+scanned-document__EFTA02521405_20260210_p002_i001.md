He's the man who said that "The best way to pred=ct the future is to invent it" and that "Technology is 
anything that w=sn't around when you were born" and that "If you don't fail at lea=t 90 percent of the time, you're not 
aiming high enough." And when I f=rst saw Microsoft's Surface tablet last June, a Kay maxim helped me unde=stand it: 
"People who are really serious about software should make thei= own hardware." 
Above all, however, Kay is known for the Dynabook =97 his decades-old vision of a portable suite of 
hardware, software, progr=mming tools and services which would add up to the ultimate creative envir=nment for kids 
of all ages. Every modern portable computer reflects elemen=s of the Dynabook concept — the One Laptop Per Child 
project's XO abov= all others — and yet none of them have fully realized the concept which=Kay was writing about in 
the early 1970s. 
Actually, Kay says that some gadgets with superficia= Dynabook-like qualities, such as the iPad, have not 
only failed to realiz= the Dynabook dream, but have in some senses betrayed it. That's one of =he points he makes in 
this interview, conducted by computer historian Davi= Greelish, proprietor of the Classic Computing Blog and organizer 
of this =onth's Vintage Computer Festival Southeast in Atlanta. (The Festival wit= feature a pop-up Apple museum 
featuring Xerox's groundbreaking Alto wor=station, which Kay worked on, as well as devices which deeply reflected hi= 
influence, including the Lisa, the original Macintosh and the Newton.) 
Kay and Greelish also discuss Kay's experiences at=some of the big outfits where he's worked, including 
Xerox's fabled PA=C labs, Apple, Disney and HP. Today, Kay continues his research about chil=ren and technology at his 
own organization, the Viewpoints Research Instit=te.

=avid Greelish: Do you agree that we now essentially have the Dynabook, as =xpressed in the three tiers 
of modern personal computing; the notebook, ta=let and smartphone? If not, what critical features do you see missing 
from=these? Have they delivered on the promise of improving education? 
Alan Kay: I have been asked versions of this questio= for the last twenty years or so. Ninety-five percent 
of the Dynabook idea=was a "service conception," and five percent had to do with physical f=rms, of which only one —
the slim notebook — is generally in the publi= view. (The other two were an extrapolated version of Ivan Sutherland's 
=ead mounted display, and an extrapolated version of Nicholas Negroponte'= ideas about ubiquitous computers 
embedded and networked everywhere.)
