Amendment No. 3 to Form S-1 
Table of Contents 
added locations and adopted a multi-channel approach to marketing and advertising. Our responses to competitive pressures, such as 
additional promotions, increased advertising, additional capital investment and the development of our internet offerings, could adversely 
affect our profitability and cash flow. We cannot guarantee that our competitive response will succeed in increasing or maintaining our 
share of retail food sales. 
An increasingly competitive industry and a low level of inflation in food prices have made it difficult for food retailers to achieve 
positive identical store sales growth on a consistent basis. Our competitors have attempted to maintain or grow their share of retail food 
sales through capital and price investment, increased promotional activity and new store growth, creating a more difficult environment to 
consistently increase year-over-year sales. Several of our primary competitors are larger than we are or have greater financial resources 
available to them and, therefore, may be able to devote greater resources to invest in price, promotional activity and new or remodeled 
stores in order to grow their share of retail food sales. Price investment by our competitors has also, from time to time, adversely affected 
our operating margins. In recent years, we have invested in price in order to remain competitive and generate sales growth; however, 
there can be no assurance this strategy will continue to be successful. 
Because we face intense competition, we need to anticipate and respond to changing consumer preferences and demands more 
effectively than our competitors. We devote significant resources to differentiating our banners in the local markets where we operate 
and invest in loyalty programs to drive traffic. Our local merchandising teams spend considerable time working with store directors to 
make sure we are satisfying consumer preferences. In addition, we strive to achieve and maintain favorable recognition of our own 
brands and offerings, and market these offerings to consumers and maintain and enhance a perception of value for consumers. While 
we seek to continuously respond to changing consumer preferences, there is no assurances that our responses will be successful. 
Our continued success is dependent upon our ability to control operating expenses, including managing health care and pension 
costs stipulated by our collective bargaining agreements to effectively compete in the food retail industry. Several of our primary 
competitors are larger than we are, or are not subject to collective bargaining agreements, allowing them to more effectively leverage 
their fixed costs or more easily reduce operating expenses. Finally, we need to source, market and merchandise efficiently. Changes in 
our product mix also may negatively affect our profitability. Failure to accomplish our objectives could impair our ability to compete 
successfully and adversely affect our profitability. 
Profit margins in the food retail industry are low. In order to increase or maintain our profit margins, we develop operating 
strategies to increase revenues, increase gross margins and reduce costs, such as new marketing programs, new advertising 
campaigns, productivity improvements, shrink reduction initiatives, distribution center efficiencies, manufacturing efficiencies, energy 
efficiency programs and other similar strategies. Our failure to achieve forecasted revenue growth, gross margin improvement or cost 
reductions could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and operating results. 
Increased commodity prices may adversely impact our profitability. 
Many of our own and sourced products include ingredients such as wheat, corn, oils, milk, sugar, proteins, cocoa and other 
commodities. Commodity prices worldwide have been volatile. Any increase in commodity prices may cause an increase in our input 
costs or the prices our vendors seek from us. Although we typically are able to pass on modest commodity price increases or mitigate 
vendor efforts to increase our costs, we may be unable to continue to do so, either in whole or in part, if commodity prices increase 
materially. If we are forced to increase prices, our customers may reduce their purchases at our stores or trade down to less profitable 
products. Both may adversely impact our profitability as a result of reduced revenue or reduced margins.
