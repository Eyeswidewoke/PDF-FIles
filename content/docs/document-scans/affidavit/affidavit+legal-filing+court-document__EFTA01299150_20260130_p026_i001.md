likely have a substantial and adverse effect upon interstate commerce. Hospital Building 
Company v. Trustees of Rex Hospital, 425 U.S. 738, 96 S. Ct. 1848, 48 L. Ed. 2d 338 
(1976); Gulf Oil Corp. v. Copp Paving Co., 419 U.S. 186, 95 S. Ct. 392, 42 L. Ed. 2d 378 
(1974); Burke v. Ford, 389 U.S. 320, 88 S. Ct. 443, 19 L. Ed. 2d 554 (1967). If so, [HN6] 
even a wholly intrastate activity may be regulated by the Sherman Act where that activity 
would place an unreasonable burden on the "free and uninterrupted flow of interstate 
commerce." Rex Hospital, supra, 96 S. Ct. at 1853. As one commentator described the 
jurisdictional test to be applied in determining the sufficiency of a Sherman Act complaint: 
(The) test applies when the chalenged conduct is not "in commerce:" it will nevertheless be subject to the Act if it 
materially affects interstate commerce. In deciding r10) these issues. quantitative factors become pertinent. It is 
necessary not only that there be a logical causal connection between the activity and the flow of commerce, it is also 
necessary that the flow of commerce be affected in some substantial way: if the impact is trivial, the Sherman Act does 
not apply. Thus. the oNy commercial activities beyond the reach of the Sherman Ad are those which are local in the 
double sense that they are neither within nor have any sigrrficant effect on the flow of interstate commerce. (footnotes

L. Sullivan, The Law of Antitrust (1977), § 233 at 710. 
Plaintiffs allegations respecting interstate commerce are contained in paragraphs 24 
through 28 of the Amended Complaint: 
24. A significant number of patients, actual and potential of the plaintiff and defendant doctors and hospitals, are 
covered by the Federal Medicare and State Medicaid Programs. Treatment of those patients generates millions of 
dollars of interstate revenue. 
rinoi 25. Defendant hospitals annually receive millions of dollars from insurance companies located outside of 
Florida for medical and surgical services provided by defendant I-, hospitals and doctors to non permanent 
nonresident patients. 
26. Defendant doctors and hospitals purchase millions of dollars of supplies and equipment from sons outside of the 
state. 
27. Rules and regulations promulgated by defendant doctors and hospitals to control the practice of Podiatrists. by 
limiting the privileges, refusing admittance, came from out of state sources (sic), as in the instance of defendant 
Jackson Memorial Hospital. whose GUIDELINES FOR PODIATRY came from THE DEPARTMENT OF ORTHOPEDIC 
SURGERY at the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. Mass. 
28. Cessation and interruption of Podiatry Clinics and Training programs in defendant hospitals deried to out of state 
Podiatrists essential surgical training necessary to compete for surgical patients in their home States. Elimination of 
said training programs by defendant hospitals and orthopedic surgeons prevented out of slate Podiatrists from coming 
to Florida specifically for such surgical training programs. 
Plaintiffs first jurisdictional hurdle is to establish the required nexus between the 
defendants' challenged activity and interstate commerce. It is this Court's ("12] 
determination that plaintiff has met this burden and properly invokes the Court's jurisdiction 
under the Sherman Act. 
The restraint that plaintiff opposes in his action is that involving an alleged conspiracy by 
the defendants to deny podiatrists in general, s and the plaintiff in particular, a certain kind 
of access to hospital facilities, that access accorded members of the hospital's medical 
staff. Membership in the medical staff is usually limited to licensed physicians.
