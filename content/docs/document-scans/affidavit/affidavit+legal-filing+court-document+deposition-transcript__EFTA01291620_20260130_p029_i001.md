Estimated Annual Figures 
The estimated annual income (EAI) and estimated annual yield (FAY) figures are estimates and for informational purposes only. These figures are not considered to be a forecast or 
guarantee of future results. These figures are computed using information from providers believed to be reliable; however, no assurance can be made as to the accuracy. Since interest 
and dividend rates are subject to change at any time. and may be affected by current and future economic, political, and business conditions, they should not be relied on for making 
investment, trading, or tax decisions. These figures assume that the position quantities, interest and dividend rates. and prices remain constant. A capital gain or return of principal 
may be included in the figures for certain securities, thereby overstating them. Refer to www pershing.coml disclosures for specific details as to formulas used to calculate the figures. 
Accrued interest represents interest earned but not yet received. 
Foreign Currency Transactions 
Pershing will execute foreign currency transactions as principal for your account. Pershing may automatically convert foreign currency to or from U.S. dollars for dividends and similar 
corporate action transactions unless you instruct your financial organization otherwise. Pershing's currency conversion rate w ill not exceed the highest interbank conversion rate 
identified from customary banking sources on the conversion date or the prior business day, increased by up to t%, unless a particular rate is required by applicable law. Your financial 
organization may also increase the currency conversion rate. This conversion rate may differ from rates in effect on the date you executed a transaction. incurred a charge, or 
received a credit. Transactions converted by agents (such as depositories) will be billed at the rates such agents use.

Securities not fully paid for in your margin account may be lent by Pershing to itself or others in accordance with the terms outlined in the Margin Agreement. The right to vote your 
shares held on margin may be reduced by the amount of shares on loan. The Proxy Voting Instruction Form sent to you may reflect a smaller number of shares entitled to vote than 
the number of shares in your margin account. 
Messages 
Although a money market mutual fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in a money market mutual fund. Shares 
of a money market mutual fund or the balance of a bank deposit product held in your brokerage account may be liquidated upon request with the proceeds credited to your brokerage
