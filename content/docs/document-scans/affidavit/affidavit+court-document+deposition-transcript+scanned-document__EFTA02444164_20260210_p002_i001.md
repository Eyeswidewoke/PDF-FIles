patients who will call or otherwise contact the Company for a referral to qualified 
physicians who will provide the appropriate medical services or procedures. 
To the Company's knowledge, no one has previously attempted to develop a business 
with the Company's planned purpose or concept (although similar business plans have been used 
by other companies to provide other services, including medical treatments, such as hair 
transplants and mini face lifts). The concepts behind the Company are sufficiently unique and 
novel that its success cannot be guaranteed, particularly since no existing company is fully 
comparable to it. More particularly, (although, upon completion of the purchase of the business 
and assets of an affi►iated entity as described below, the Company believes it will have sufficient 
Physician Members to commence marketing its services in limited geographic areas) no assurance 
can be given that the Company will be able to attract as members sufficient qualified physicians to 
enable the Company to have a sufficient pool of qualified physicians to whom it can refer potential 
patients or that its infomercials or other marketing efforts will generate sufficient referrals of 
potential patients that would justify or support the payment of applicable fees for membership in 
the Company's group of recommended physicians. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that 
the products and services that the Company intends to offer will have any market or public appeal 
or will provide a basis for a commercially successful enterprise. 
In the event the Company is unable to achieve success with its initial efforts, it is expected 
that management will seek to modify its initial business model or adopt a different business model. 
However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to do so or otherwise achieve 
any success. 
Further, if the Company is successful, competitive businesses may gain acceptance and 
prevail in the marketplace to such an extent that the Company cannot achieve or sustain 
profitability. 
No assurance can be given that there will be adequate sources of revenues for the 
Company. 
The Company plans on obtaining revenues from membership, licensing or similar fees paid 
by physicians who are members of the Company's group of recommended physicians. However, 
there can be no assurance that any such revenues will be forthcoming or that, even if forthcoming, 
will be sufficient to fund the Company's development, marketing and operations. 
The Offering may not yield sufficient funding to permit the Company to implement an of 
its business plans. 
The Offering is being made by the Company as "an any-or-none" offering. Accordingly, 
there is no requirement on the Company's part to sell a minimum number of Units or receive 
minimum proceeds. Even if the Offering is fully subscribed for and sold, the Company may be 
unable to implement any portion of its business plans or to otherwise proceed, and if the Company 
sells only a limited number of Units as pan of the Offering, the risks of the Company being unable 
to implement any portion of its business plans will be increased. 
The initial $1 million raised in the Offering will be paid to an entity affiliated with the 
founder for certain business and assets of such entity. 
To date, expenses related to the initial stages of the Company's business plan have been 
funded through Victor Products, Inc. ("VPf'), a separate corporation formed and controlled by 
Steven A. Victor, M.D., the Company's founder, and certain of his affiliates. As soon as at least
