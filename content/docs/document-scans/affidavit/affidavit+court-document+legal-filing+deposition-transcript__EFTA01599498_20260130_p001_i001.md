Advanced Parole 
The 1-512 endorsement on your EAD card is proof that, while your Form 1-485 is pending. you may travel abroad without abandoning your Form 1-485. 
Show your unexpired EAD card with the 1-512 endorsement to the ship or airline, and it can let you on board to travel to the United States. As long as your 
FAD card has not expired, you may use it multiple times to request parole into the United States. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) can parole you 
into the U.S. for up to one (1) year. 
Before you leave the United States, please note the following information: 
• Parole into the United States is not guaranteed. In all cases, a CBP officer must still inspect you at a port of entry to determine whether you are 
eligible to come into the United States according to the terms of this advance parole. Even though USCIS approved your advance parole, CBP may 
still refuse to parole you into the United States. 
• Parole into the United States is not an "admission" into the U.S. If we deny your Form 1-485, you may be subject to removal proceedings for being 
inadmissible to the U.S. 
• Unlawful Presence. If you leave the United States after being unlawfully present in the United States, you may be barred from admission even if 
you obtained advance parole. If you were unlawfully present in the United States for more than 180 days but less than one year and you leave the 
U.S. voluntarily before the start of removal proceedings. you are inadmissible for three years; if you were unlawfully present for one year or more. 
you are inadmissible for ten years. 
If you have concerns about how traveling abroad with your EAD card may affect your legal rights, admissibility, or waivers. you should contact an 
immigration attorney or an immigrant assistance organization accredited by the Board of Immigration Appeals before making foreign travel plans. 
If You Have a Pending Form 1-485 
If you have a pending or approved Form 1-140 and a pending Form 1-485, you may request to change employers if your Form 1-485 has been pending 
for at least 180 days. In order to do so, you need to submit documentation about your new job offer. For more information on how to request a change of 
employers and what information you must submit, please visit the USCIS website at www.uscis.gov.
