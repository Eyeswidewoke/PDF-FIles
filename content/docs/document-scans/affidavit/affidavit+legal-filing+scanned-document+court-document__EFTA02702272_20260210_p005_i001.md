As of March 31, 2016, we had approximately $1,828 million in outstanding Senior Indebtedness and $460 
million of Indebtedness Ranking on a Parity with the Debentures. The indenture pursuant to which the debentures 
will be issued does not place any limit on the amount of liabilities that we may issue. guarantee or otherwise 
incur or the amount of liabilities, including debt or preferred stock, that our subsidiaries may issue, guarantee or 
otherwise incur. We expect from time to time to incur additional indebtedness and other liabilities and to 
guarantee indebtedness that will be senior to the debentures. 
The debentures will be effectively subordinated to the liabilities of our subsidiaries. 
We have limited operations of our own and derive substantially all of our revenue and cash flow from our 
subsidiaries. None of our subsidiaries will guarantee the debentures. Creditors of our subsidiaries (including 
policyholders and trade creditors) will generally be entitled to payment from the assets of those subsidiaries 
before those assets can be distributed to us. As a result, the debentures will effectively be subordinated to the 
liabilities of our subsidiaries. As of March 31. 2016. our subsidiaries had approximately $61 million in 
outstanding debt and our insurance subsidiaries had gross reserves for losses and loss expenses of approximately 
$10.8 billion. 
We can defer interest payments on the debentures for one or more periods of up to five years each. This 
may affect the market price of the debentures. 
So lung as there is no event of default with respect to the debentures, we may defer interest payments on the 
debentures, from time to time, for one or more optional deferral periods of up to five consecutive years. At the 
end of an optional deferral period, if all amounts due are paid. we could start a new optional deferral period of up 
to five consecutive years. During any optional deferral period, interest on the debentures would be deferred but 
would accrue additional interest at a rate equal to the interest rate on the debentures, to the extent permitted by 
applicable law. No optional deferral period may extend beyond the maturity date of the debentures. See 
"Description of Debentures—Option to Defer Interest Payments." 
If we exercise our right to defer interest payments, the debentures may trade at a price that does not fully 
reflect the value of accrued and unpaid interest on the debentures or that is otherwise less than the price at which 
the debentures may have been traded if we had not exercised such right. ►n addition, as a result of our right to 
defer interest payments, the market price of the debentures is likely to be affected and may be more volatile than 
other securities that do not have these rights. 
If we do defer interest on the debentures and you sell your debentures during the period of that deferral, you 
may not receive the same return on your investment as a holder that continues to hold its debentures until we pay 
the deferred interest at the end of the applicable deferral period. 
A holder of the debentures will not have rights of acceleration in the case of payment defaults or other 
breaches of covenants. 
The only event of default under the indenture consists of specific events of our bankruptcy. insolvency or 
receivership. There is no right of acceleration in the case of payment defaults or other breaches of covenants 
under the indenture. 
If we defer interest payments on the debentures, there will be U.S. federal income tax consequences to 
holders of the debentures. 
If we were to defer interest payments on the debentures, the debentures would be treated as issued with 
original issue discount ("OID") at the time of such deferral, and all stated interest due after such deferral would 
be treated as OID. In such case, a United States holder would be required to include such stated interest in 
income as it accrues, regardless of such United States holder's regular method of accounting. using a constant 
yield method, before such holder received any payment attributable to such income, and would not separately 
report the actual payments of interest on the debentures as taxable income.
