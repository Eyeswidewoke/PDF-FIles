except for the withdrawal of interest to pay taxes. Based upon current 
interest rates. we expect the trust account to generate approximately 
$25,000 of interest annually (assuming an interest rate of 0.02% per 
year). Unless and until we complete our initial business combination. 
we may pay our expenses only from: 
Is 
• the net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust account, 
which will be approximately $1,000,000 in working capital after 
the payment of approximately $750,000 in expenses relating to this 
offering; and 
any loans or additional investments from our sponsor, members of 
our management team or their affiliates or other third parties, 
although they arc under no obligation to advance funds or invest in 
us. and provides! any such loans will not have any claim on the 
proceeds held in the trust account unless such proceeds arc 
released to us upon completion of a business combination. 
Conditions to completing our initial 
business combination 
There is no limitation on our ability to raid: funds privately or 
through loans in connection with our initial business combination. 
The NASDAQ rules require that our initial business combination 
must be with one or more target businesses that together have a fair 
market value equal to at least 80% of the balance in the tam account 
(less any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on 
interest earned) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in 
connection with our initial business combination. We do not intend 
to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in connection 
with our initial business combination. 
If our board of directors is not able to independently deteminic the 
fair market value of the target business or businases, we will obtain 
an opinion from an independent amounting firm or an independent 
investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA. We will 
complete our initial business combination only if the post-transaction 
company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or 
acquire 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target 
or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for 
it not to be required to register as an investment company under the 
Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company 
owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target 
our stockholders prior to the business combination may collectivch 
own a minority interest in the post-transaction company. depending 
on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business 
combination transaction. If less than 100% of the equity interests or 
assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the 
post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses 
that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 
80% of net assets test, provided that in the event that the business 
combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net 
assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target 
businesses.
