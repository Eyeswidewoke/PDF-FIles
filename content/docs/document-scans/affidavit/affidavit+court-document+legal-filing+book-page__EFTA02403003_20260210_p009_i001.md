requires that the alleged splitting of very distant events into two is an artifact of a coordinitization 
procedure that has become ambiguous. 
I will support this in the next section, where I will discuss how a coordinate ambiguity arises 
from the attempt to apply Einstein's procedure for synchronizing clocks to the case of K— Minkowski 
spacetime. The result is that, unlike Minkowski spacetime, inertial frames cannot be extended in-
definitely without running into coordinate ambiguities. 
4 Synchronization of distant clocks 
Let us recall Einstein's operational construction of coordinates for an inertial observer's measurements[271. 
According to Einstein, events are defined by the physical coincidence of elementary particles, which 
in classical physics means by the intersection of the worldlines of those particles. Coordinates are 
assigned to those events by physical operations which involve exchanges of light signals between 
those events and the observer at the origin, who is also presumed to carry a clock. They have no 
other meaning. It is assumed that the observer has no access to distant events which would enable 
her to assign them coordinates except by the exchange of light signals. 
Thus, in Einstein's procedure, you start with an observer, Alice, who has a clock next to her. 
Events on the world line of the observer are parameterized by the reading of the clock, t. Events off 
the worldline are given time and spatial coordinates by using light signals bounced between the 
observer and those events. The only measurements that are made are of the readings of the dock 
when the light signals leave and return, t1 and t2, having bounced back off of the distant event. 
An event, e is assigned a value of the time coordinate, to = (ti + 12)/2. The event is assigned a 
space coordinate (simplifying to 1 + 1 dimensions) of xe = (t2 — t )c/2. A consequence of this is 
that the observer is by definition at the event x = 0. 
A by product of this construction is that it allows the synchronization of distant clocks with 
the observer's clock. Another consequence is that, when applied to moving clocks, this leads to 
the relativity of simultaneity. 
In special relativity this procedure can be applied to events arbitrarily far from the observer. 
In general relativity there is a limitation to how large x and t can be before the procedure becomes 
ambiguous, which is given by the radius of curvature. The curvature limits the region of space 
and time over which clocks can be synchronized. 
The results we have discussed raise the question of whether in DSR, or quantum gravity gen-
erally, this procedure can be unambiguously extended to arbitrarily large x and t, or whether there 
are quantum effects, even in the absence of classical curvature, which limit the applicability of this 
procedure to arbitrarily large values of the coordinates. 
Here I would like to point out that there is in fact a limit to how large of a region of space 
and time may be unambiguously be assigned coordinates in an inertial frame. This limit arises 
because any clock has an accuracy within which one like to synchronize it. We will call this coo. 
To see how this introduces a limit to how far away two clocks can be and be synchronized with 
each other, let us recall from [26J that a massless particle propagating in ,c-Minkowski spacetime 
(in the commuting coordinates) is subject to an anomolous spreading of the wavepacket. An 
initially Gaussian wavepacket, with initial width I1x has a width that evolves according to (eq. 61
