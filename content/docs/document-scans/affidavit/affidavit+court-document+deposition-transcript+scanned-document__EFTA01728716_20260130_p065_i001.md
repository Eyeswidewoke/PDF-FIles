Issues About Age of Consent 
• 
• 
In the early 1980s, an infamous case involved a judge who sentenced an adult convicted of 
child molestation to a minimal sentence because the judge felt the 5-year-old victim was "sexually 
promiscuous." Society and professionals were outraged and demanded that the judge be removed 
from the bench. The sad reality is that most people were outraged for the wrong reason—because 
they thought it was impossible for a 5-year-old child to be sexually promiscuous. 
Although not typical or probable, it is possible. Of course, this is more likely the result of 
some maltreatment, not the cause. Instead, we should have been outraged because it makes no 
difference whether or not the 5-year-old child was sexually promiscuous, a fact that in no way 
lessens the offender's crime of responsibility. If you change the case slightly and make the victim 
9 years old, does that make a difference? Most people would probably say no. If you change it again 
and make the victim 12 years old, many people would still say it makes no difference, but might 
want to see a picture of the victim. If you change it again and make the victim 13, 14, 15, or 16 years 
old, the response of society and the law would vary greatly. For example, those interested in 
minimizing such sexual activity might emphasize referring to the victims as minors rather than as 
children. 
In sex crimes, the fundamental legal difference between victimization of an adult and a child 
is the issue of consent. In cases of sexual activity between adults, with a few rare exceptions, a lack 
of consent must be established for there to be a crime. In sexual activity between children and 
adults, a crime can exist even if the child cooperates or "consents." But the reality of age of consent 
is not so simple. 
Age of consent can vary depending on the type of sexual activity and individual involved. 
At what age can a child do the following: consent to get married; engage in sexual activity; appear 
in sexually explicit visual images; or leave home to have sex with an unrelated adult without parental 
permission? Federal case law seems to suggest that the consent of a 14-year-old who crosses state 
lines after running off and having sex with a 40-year-old man she met on the Internet is a valid 
defense for the kidnapping charge, but not for the sexual assault charge. At what age can an 
adolescent consent to have sex with a relative, a teacher, a coach, an employer, or a 21-year-old 
boyfriend or girlfriend? 
In the United States, society and criminal investigators and prosecutors seem to have a 
preference for sexual victimization cases where the victim, adult or child, clearly does not consent. 
Among lack of consent cases, the least preferred are cases where the victim could not consent 
because of self-induced use of drugs or alcohol. Cases where the victim was just verbally threatened 
are next, followed by cases where a weapon was displayed. For purposes of ease of proof, the most 
preferred lack-of-consent cases are those where the victim has visible physical injuries or is, sad to 
say, dead. Many compliant child victims may inaccurately claim they were asleep, drink, drugged, 
or abducted in part to meet these lack of consent criteria and in part to avoid embarrassment.
