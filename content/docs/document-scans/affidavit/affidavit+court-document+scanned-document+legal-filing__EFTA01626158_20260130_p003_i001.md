Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 361-68 Entered on FLSD Docket 02/10/2016 Page 3 of 4 
Attorney's Office and in the Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section of the Justice Department. 
Defense attorneys next requested a meeting with me to challenge the prosecution and the terms 
previously presented by the prosecutors in their meeting with Mr. Black. The prosecution team 
and I met with defense counsel in Fall 2007, and I reaffirmed the office's position: two years, 
registration and restitution, or trial. 
Over the next several months, the defense team presented argument after argument claiming that 
felony criminal proceedings against Epstein were unsupported by the evidence and lacked a basis 
in law, and that the office's insistence on jail-time was motivated by a zeal to overcharge a man 
merely because he is wealthy. They bolstered their arguments with legal opinions from well-
known legal experts. One member of the defense team warned me that the office's excess zeal in 
forcing a good man to serve time in jail might be the subject of a book if we continued to 
proceed with this matter. My office systematically considered and rejected each argument, and 
when we did, my office's decisions were appealed to Washington. As to the warning, I ignored 
it. 
The defense strategy was not limited to legal issues. Defense counsel investigated individual 
prosecutors and their families, looking for personal peccadilloes that may provide a basis for 
disqualification. Disqualifying a prosecutor is an effective (though rarely used) strategy, as 
eliminating the individuals most familiar with the facts and thus most qualified to take a case to 
trial harms likelihood for success. Defense counsel tried to disqualify at least two prosecutors. I 
carefully reviewed, and then rejected, these arguments. 
Despite this army of attorneys, the office held firm to the terms first presented to Mr. Black in 
the original meeting. On June 30, 2008, after yet another last minute appeal to Washington D.C. 
was rejected, Epstein pled guilty in state court. He was to serve 18 months imprisonment, 
register as a sexual offender for life and provide restitution to the victims. 
Some may feel that the prosecution should have been tougher. Evidence that has come to light 
since 2007 may encourage that view. Many victims have since spoken out, filing detailed 
statements in civil cases seeking damages. Physical evidence has since been discovered. Had 
these additional statements and evidence been known, the outcome may have been different. But 
they were not known to us at the time. 
A prosecution decision must be based on admissible facts known at the time. In cases of this 
type, those arc unusually difficult because victims are frightened and often decline to testify or if 
they do speak, they give contradictory statements. Our judgment in this case, based on the 
evidence known at the time, was that it was better to have a billionaire serve time in jail, register 
as a sex offender and pay his victims restitution than risk a trial with a reduced likelihood of 
success. I supported that judgment then, and based on the state of the law as it then stood and the 
evidence known at that time, I would support that judgment again. 
Epstein's treatment, while in state custody, likewise may encourage the view that the office 
should have been tougher. Epstein appears to have received highly unusual treatment while in 
jail. Although the terms of confinement in a state prison are a matter appropriately left to the
