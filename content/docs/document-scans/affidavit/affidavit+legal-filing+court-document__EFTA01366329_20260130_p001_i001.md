12,815,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full) private placement warrants, each exercisable for one-
half of one share of our common stock at $5.75 per half share, for a purchase price of $5,800,000 (or $6,407,500

The founder's shares are identical to the shares of common stock included in the units being sold in this 
offering. However, the holders have agreed (A) to vote any shares owned by them in favor of any proposed 
business combination and (B) not to redeem any shares in connection with a stockholder vote to approve a 
proposed initial business combination. 
The personal and financial interests of our executive officers and directors may influence their motivation in 
identifying and selecting a target business combination, completing an initial business combination and 
influencing the operation of the business following the initial business combination. 
Since our sponsor, executive officers and directors will not be eligible to be reimbursed for their out-of-
pocket expenses if our business combination is not completed, a conflict of interest may arise in determining 
whether a particular business combination target is appropriate for our initial business combination. 
At the closing of our initial business combination, our sponsor, executive officers and dins:tors, or any of 
their respective affiliates, will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with activities 
on our behalf such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business 
combinations. There is no cap or ceiling on the reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection 
with activities on our behalf. These financial interests of our sponsor, executive officers and directors may 
influence their motivation in identifying and selecting a target business combination and completing an initial 
business combination. 
We may Issue notes or other debt securities, or otherwise incur substantial debt, to complete a business 
combination, which may adversely affect our leverage and financial condition and thus negatively impact 
the value of our stockholders' investment in us. 
Although we have no commitments as of the date of this prospectus to issue any notes or other debt securities. 
or to otherwise incur outstanding debt, we may choose to incur substantial debt to complete our business 
combination. We have agreed that we will not incur any indebtedness unless we have obtained from the lender a 
waiver of any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to the monies held in the trust account. As such, no 
issuance of debt will affect the per-sham amount available for redemption from the trust account. Nevertheless, 
the incurrence of debt could have a variety of negative effects, including: 
• default and foreclosure on our assets if our operating revenues after an initial business combination am 
insufficient to repay our debt obligations; 
• acceleration of our obligations to repay the indebtedness even if we make all principal and interest 
payments when due if we breach certain covenants that require the maintenance of certain financial ratios or 
reserves without a waiver or renegotiation of that covenant; 
• our immediate payment of all principal and accrued interest. if any. if the debt security is payable on 
demand; 
• our inability to obtain necessary additional financing if the debt security contains covenants restricting our 
ability to obtain such financing while the debt security is outstanding; 
• our inability to pay dividends on our common stock; 
• using a substantial portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on our debt, which will reduce the 
funds available for dividends on our common stock if declared, expenses. capital expenditures, acquisitions 
and other general corporate purposes; 
• limitations on our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business and in the industry in 
which we operate:

• increased vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic. indusuy and competitive conditions and 
adverse changes in government regulation; and 
• limitations on our ability' to borrow additional amounts for expenses. capital expenditures. acquisitions, 
debt service requirements, execution of our strategy and other purposes and other disadvantages compared 
to our competitors who have less debt.
