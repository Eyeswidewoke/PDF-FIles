Amendment No. 3 to Form S-1 
Tabk of Contents 
SAFEWAY INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
presented below using appropriate valuation methodologies and market information available as of year end. Considerable judgment is 
required to develop estimates of fair value, and the estimates presented are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the Company 
could realize in a current market exchange. The use of different market assumptions or estimation methodologies could have a material 
effect on the estimated fair values. Additionally, the fair values were estimated at year end, and current estimates of fair value may differ 
significantly from the amounts presented. 
The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments: 
Cash and equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable. 
The carrying amount of these items approximates fair value. 
Short-term investments. 
These investments are readily convertible to cash, and the carrying amount of these items approximates 
fair value. 
Notes receivables. 
The Company's notes receivables, included in other assets, are comprised primarily of notes receivable 
resulting from the sale of real estate. The fair value of note receivables is estimated by discounting expected future cash flows using 
interest rates, adjusted for credit risk, at which similar loans could be made under current market conditions. The carrying value of notes 
receivables, which approximates fair value, was $108.0 million at January 3, 2015 and $101.0 million at December 28, 2013. 
Approximately $27.7 million of the notes receivables at January 3, 2015 were Safeway advances to Blackhawk. These advances funded 
Blackhawk's estimated tax payments on the distribution of Blackhawk shares which are explained in Note B under the caption 
"Blackhawk'. With the closing of the Merger on January 30, 2015, Blackhawk is not required to repay these advances. 
Long-term debt, including current maturities. 
Market values quoted in public markets are used to estimate the fair value of 
publicly traded debt. To estimate the fair value of debt issues that are not quoted in public markets, the Company uses those interest 
rates that are currently available to it for issuance of debt with similar terms and remaining maturities as a discount rate for the remaining 
principal payments. 
Store Lease Exit Costs and Impairment Charges Safeway regularly reviews its stores' operating performance and assesses the 
Company's plans for certain store and plant closures. Losses related to the impairment of long-lived assets are recognized when 
expected future cash flows are less than the asset's carrying value. The Company evaluates the carrying value of the assets in relation 
to its expected future cash flows. If the carrying value is greater than the future cash flows, a provision is made for the impairment of the 
assets to write the assets down to estimated fair value. Fair value is determined by estimating net future cash flows, discounted using a 
risk-adjusted rate of return. The Company calculates impairment on a store-by-store basis. These provisions are recorded as a 
component of operating and administrative expense. 
When stores that are under long-term leases close, the Company records a liability for the future minimum lease payments and 
related ancillary costs, net of estimated cost recoveries that may be achieved through subletting properties or through favorable lease 
terminations, discounted using a risk-adjusted rate of interest. This liability is recorded at the time the store is closed. Activity included in 
the reserve for store lease exit costs is disclosed in Note E.
