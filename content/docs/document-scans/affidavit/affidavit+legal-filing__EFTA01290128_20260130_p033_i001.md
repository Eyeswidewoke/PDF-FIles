Important Information and Disclosures 
Pricing 
This section includes the net market value of the securities in your account on a settlement date basis, including short positions, at the close of the statement period. The market prices have been obtained from

not available are marked 'N/A' and are omitted from the Total.

The estimated annual income (EAI) and estimated annual yield (EAY) figures are estimates and for informational purposes only. These figures are not considered to be a forecast or guarantee of future results. 
These figures are computed using information from providers believed to be reliable; however, no assurance can be made as to the accuracy. Since interest and dividend rates are subject to change at any time, 
and may be affected by current and future economic, political, and business conditions, they should not be relied on for making investment, trading, or tax decisions. These figures assume that the position
