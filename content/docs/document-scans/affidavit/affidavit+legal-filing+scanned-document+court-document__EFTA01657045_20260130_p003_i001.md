terms of content: Fire marshals ask specific questions related to combustion, physicians ask 
specific questions related to biochemistry and bodily functions, safety inspectors ask specific 
questions about safety equipment, etc. So, for instance, the typical police interview opens with a 
series of questions aimed at eliciting demographic information (e.g. witness's name, address, 
telephone, time available). This is followed by a perfunctory open-ended question about "What 
happened?" Shortly after the witness begins to provide a narrative response—usually on the 
order of a few seconds— the interviewer interrupts and asks in a staccato fashion a barrage of 
short-answer questions: How old was the robber? Was he Black or White? How tall was he? Did 
he have a gun? How much money did he take? Interwoven among these questions may even be 
some leading or suggestive questions: Was he wearing a red shirt? This line of specific, short-
answer questions continues until the police investigator has exhausted the list of crime-relevant 
factors. Finally, the interview terminates with the pro forma, Is there anything else?—which 
invariably yields no new information (see Fisher, Geiselman, & Raymond, 1987, for a 
description of American police, and George & Clifford, 1992, for a similar description of British 
police). 
What are the consequences of this commonly used, evidence-driven style of interviewing? We 
examine this issue with respect to the two goals of investigative interviewing: eliciting extensive, 
accurate information and promoting victims' psychological health. In short, the above style of 
interviewing accomplishes neither of the goals: It elicits less information than is available and it 
does not contribute to therapeutic jurisprudence—if anything, it may harm victims' 
psychological health. We examine why the typical police interviewing strategy is dysfunctional 
and then we describe an alternative interview protocol that enhances the amount and quality of 
information gathered and also likely promotes victims' well being. 
First, let us describe the interview itself, and then explore the implications for eliciting witness 
information and promoting Therapeutic Jurisprudence. The typical police interview is dominated 
by the police interviewer—with the witness playing a subordinate role—and it revolves around 
the evidence needed by the investigator. These two principles give rise to a host of undesirable 
results, including: (a) the interviewer does most of the talking (in the form of asking questions), 
and the witness merely "helps out" by answering the questions, (b) the question are very specific, 
often in the form of True/False or forced choice (e.g. Was he Black or White?), (c) witnesses are 
discouraged from providing information unrelated to the specific question, (d) the sequence of 
the interview is determined by the interviewer, often adhering to a pre-determined written 
checklist of questions, (e) the interview opens with a set of formal questions (e.g. witness's 
name, contact information) to allow the interviewer to fill out his/her crime report, (t) the 
interviewer frequently interrupts the witness to ask follow-up questions, and (g) the interviewer 
often asks leading or suggestive questions to confirm his/her hypothesis about the crime. 
These unsalutary practices have the adverse effects of reducing the amount of information 
witnesses provide and increasing inaccurate responses. This is because these practices entice 
witnesses to (a) withhold information, (b) not provide any unsolicited information, (c) give 
abbreviated answers, and (d) volunteer answers they are unsure of. Furthermore, they disrupt the 
natural process of searching through memory, thereby making memory retrieval inefficient.
