(e) 
in all other circumstances, in accordance with the terms and conditions set out in the subscription 
document, these Articles and the Memorandum. 
9. 
ARTICLE 9. - CONVERSION OF SHARES 
9.1 
Subject each time to the approval of the General Partner (which may be withheld at the General Partner's 
absolute discretion) and such terms and conditions as set out in the Memorandum, a shareholder may. if so 
provided in the Memorandum, convert all or part of its shares of a particular Class of shares of a Compartment 
into another Class of shares within the same Compartment or another Compartment. 
9.2 
If conversions are authorised in the Memorandum, a process determined by the General Partner and described in 
the Memorandum shall govern the chronology of the conversion of shares in a Compartment or from one 
Compartment to another Compartment. The General Partner may impose conditions on the conversion of shares 
which will be detailed in the Memorandum. A conversion application will be considered as an application to 
redeem the shares held by the shareholder and as an application for the simultaneous acquisition (issue) of the 
shares to be acquired. A conversion fee may be incurred. Additional fees may be incurred if distributors and 
paying agents are involved in a transaction. The prices of the conversion may be rounded up or down to the 
nearest unit of the currency in which they are to be paid, as determined by the General Partner. The General 
Partner may determine that balances of less than a reasonable amount to be set by the General Partner, resulting 
from conversions, will not be paid out to shareholders. 
9.3 
As a rule, unless otherwise provided for in the Memorandum, both the redemption and the acquisition pans of 
the conversion application should be calculated on the basis of the net asset value per share prevailing on the 
dealing date in respect of which the redemption part of the relevant conversion request is undertaken by the 
relevant Compartment. 
9.4 
Conversions may only be effected if, at the time, both the redemption of the shares to be convened and the issue 
of the shares to be acquired are simultaneously possible: there will be no partial execution of the application 
unless the possibility of issuing the shares to be acquired ceases after the shares to be convened have been 
redeemed. 
9.5 
All applications for the conversion of shares are irrevocable, unless otherwise provided for in the Memorandum. 
9.6 
If as a result of a conversion application, the number or the value of the shares held by any shareholder in any 
Class of shares falls below the minimum number or value that is then - if the rights provided for in this sentence 
are applicable - specified by the General Partner in the Memorandum, the Company may decide to treat the 
purchase pan of the conversion application as a request for redemption for all of the shareholder's shares in the 
given Class of shares; the acquisition part of the conversion application will remain unaffected by any additional 
redemption of shares. 
9.7 
Shares that arc convened to shares of another Class of shares will be cancelled. 
10. 
ARTICLE 10. - TRANSFER OF SHARES - TRANSFER OF COMMITMENTS 
10.1 
The General Partner shall not sale, assign, transfer, exchange, pledge, grant a participation in, hypothecate. 
encumber or otherwise dispose of (each a Transfer) all or any part of its Management Shares or voluntarily 
withdraw as the general partner of the Company. 
10.2 
The Transfer of all or any part of any investor's shares or undrawn commitment (to the exclusion of the 
Management Shares) in any Compartment is subject to the provisions of this article and of the Memorandum. 
10.3 
No Transfer of all or any pan of any investor's shares or undrawn commitment in any Compartment, whether 
direct or indirect, voluntary or involuntary:
