prior to the redemption date for any preferred securities called for redemption shall be payable to the holders of 
such preferred securities on the relevant record dates for the related distribution dates. If notice of redemption 
shall have been given and funds deposited as required, then immediately prior to the close of business on the date 
of such deposit, all rights of the holders of such preferred securities so called for redemption will cease, except 
the right of the holders of such preferred securities to receive the redemption price, but without interest, and such 
preferred securities will cease to be outstanding. In the event that any date on which any redemption price is 
payable is not a Business Day, then payment of the redemption price payable on such date will be made on the 
next succeeding day which is a Business Day, and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such 
delay, except that, if such Business Day falls in the next calendar year, such payment will be made on the 
immediately preceding Business Day, in each case with the same force and effect as if made on such date. In the 
event that payment of the redemption price in respect of preferred securities called for redemption is improperly 
withheld or refused and not paid either by the related trust or by us pursuant to the preferred securities guarantee 
as described under "Description of Preferred Securities Guarantee", distributions on such preferred securities will 
continue to accumulate at the then applicable rate, from the redemption date originally established by the trust for 
such preferred securities to the date such redemption price is actually paid, in which case the actual payment date 
will be the date fixed for redemption for purposes of calculating the redemption price. 
Subject to applicable law, including, without limitation. United States Federal securities law, we or our 
subsidiaries may at any time and from time to time purchase outstanding preferred securities by tender, in the 
open market or by private agreement. 
Payment of the redemption price on the preferred securities shall be made to the applicable recordholders as 
they appear on the register for such preferred securities on the relevant record date, which shall be one Business 
Day prior to the relevant redemption date; provided, however, that in the event that any preferred securities are 
not in book•entry form, the relevant record date for such preferred securities shall be a date at least 15 days prior 
to the redemption date, as specified in the applicable prospectus supplement. 
If less than all of the preferred securities and common securities issued by the trust are to be redeemed on a 
redemption date, then the aggregate liquidation amount of such preferred securities and common securities to be 
redeemed shall be allocated pro rata to the preferred securities and the common securities based upon the relative 
liquidation amounts of such classes. The particular preferred securities to be redeemed shall be selected from the 
outstanding preferred securities not previously called for redemption, in accordance with the procedures of the 
depositary. For all purposes of the restated trust agreement, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions 
relating to the redemption of preferred securities shall relate, in the case of any preferred securities redeemed or 
to be redeemed only in part, to the portion of the liquidation amount of preferred securities which has been or is 
to be redeemed. 
Notice of any redemption will be transmitted at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the 
redemption date to each holder of trust securities to be redeemed at its registered address. Unless we default in 
payment of the redemption price on the corresponding subordinated debt securities, on and after the redemption 
date interest will cease to accrue on such subordinated debt securities or portions thereof called for redemption 
and distributions will cease to accrue on the related preferred securities or portions thereof. (Section 4.2) 
Subordination of Common Securities 
Payment of distributions on, and the redemption price of, the mist's preferred securities and common securities, 
as applicable, shall be made pro rata based on the liquidation amount of such preferred securities and common 
securities: provided, however, that if on any distribution date or redemption date an event of default under the 
corresponding subordinated debt securities shall have occurred and be continuing, no payment of any distribution on, 
or redemption price of, any of the trust's common securities, and no other payment on account of the redemption, 
liquidation or other acquisition of such common securities, shall be made unless payment in full in cash of all 
accumulated and unpaid distributions on all of the trust's outstanding preferred securities for all distribution periods 
terminating on or prior thereto, or in the case of payment of the redemption price the full amount of such redemption
