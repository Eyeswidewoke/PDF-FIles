ARTICLE 14 - BYLAWS 
The Board of Director(s) of the Corporation shall have power, without the assent or 
vote of the shareholders, to make, alter, amend or repeal the Bylaws of the Corporation, 
but the affirmative vote of a number of Directors equal to a majority of the number who 
would constitute a full Board of Director(s) at the time of such action shall be necessary 
to take any action for the making, alteration, amendment or repeal of the Bylaws. 
ARTICLE 15 - EFFECTIVE DATE 
These Articles of Incorporation shall be effective immediately upon approval of the 
Secretary of State, State of Florida. 
ARTICLE 16 - INDEMNIFICATION 
The Corporation shall indemnify a director or officer of the Corporation who was 
wholly successful, on the merits or otherwise, in the defense of any proceeding to which 
the director or officer was a party because the director or officer is or was a director or 
officer of the Corporation against reasonable attorney fees and expenses incurred by the 
director or officer in connection with the proceeding. The Corporation may indemnify an 
individual made a party to a proceeding because the individual is or was a director, officer, 
employee or agent of the Corporation against liability if authorized in the specific case after 
determination, in the manner required by the Board of Directors, that indemnification of the 
director, officer, employee or agent, as the case may be, is permissible in the 
circumstances because the director, officer, employee or agent has met the standard of 
conduct set forth by the Board of Directors. The indemnification and advancement of 
attorney fees and expenses for directors, officers, employees and agents of the 
Corporation shall apply when such persons are serving at the Corporation's request while

or not for profit, as well as in their official capacity with the Corporation. The Corporation

director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation who is a party to a proceeding in 
advance of final disposition of the proceeding. The Corporation also may purchase and 
maintain insurance on behalf of an individual arising from the individual's status as a 
director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, whether or not the Corporation 
would have power to indemnify the individual against the same liability under the law. All 
references in these Articles of Incorporation are deemed to include any amendment or 
successor thereto. Nothing contained in these Articles of Incorporation shall limit or 
preclude the exercise of any right relating to indemnification or advance of attorney fees 
and expenses to any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the 
Corporation or the ability of the Corporation otherwise to indemnify or advance expenses 
to any such person by contract or in any other manner. If any word, clause or sentence 
of the foregoing provisions regarding indemnification or advancement of the attorney fees 
cr expenses shall be held invalid as contrary to law or public policy, it shall be severable
