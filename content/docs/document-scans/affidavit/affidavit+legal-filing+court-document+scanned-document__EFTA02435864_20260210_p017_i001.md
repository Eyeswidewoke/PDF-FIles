Section 5.4 
Indemnification of Indemnified Parties. (a) Any person who was or 
is a Member, including the Managing Member, or a member, officer, employee, or other agent of 
the Company, or was or is serving at the request of the Company as an officer, employee, or other 
agent of another limited liability company, corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other 
enterprise (each, an "Indemnified Party", and collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") shall, in 
accordance with this Section 5.4, be indemnified and held harmless by the Company from and 
against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, expenses (including reasonable legal and 
other professional fees and disbursements), judgments, fines, settlements, and other amounts 
incurred (collectively, "Indemnifiable Losses") in connection with any and all claims, demands, 
actions, suits or proceedings (civil, criminal, administrative or investigative), actual or threatened, 
in which such Indemnified Party may be involved, as a party or otherwise, by reason of such 
Indemnified Party's service to, or on behalf of, or management of the affairs of, the Company, or 
rendering of advice or consultation with respect thereto, whether or not the Indemnified Party 
continues to be serving in the above-described capacity at the time any such Indemnification 
Obligation is paid or incurred; provided, however, that no Indemnified Party shall be entitled to 
indemnification under this Section 5.4 to the extent it is finally determined by a court of 
competent jurisdiction that (i) the Indemnified Party's acts or omissions were not in good faith or 
involved intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law or (ii) the Indemnified Party 
derived an improper personal benefit. 
(b) 
To the extent an Indemnified Party acted in good faith and in a manner 
reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Company, the Company 
shall advance expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party upon the receipt by the Company of 
the signed statement of such Indemnified Party agreeing to reimburse the Company for such 
advance in the event it is ultimately determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that such 
Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified by the Company for such expenses. 
(c) 
The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted 
pursuant to, this Section 5.4 shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those 
seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any agreement, 
approval of the Members or otherwise. 
(d) 
The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted 
pursuant to, this Section 5.4 shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a Member, 
officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors, administrators, 
successors and assigns of such person. 
Section 5.5 
No Waiver. Notwithstanding Sections 5.3 and 5.4, nothing 
contained in this Agreement shall constitute a waiver by any Member of any of such Member's 
legal rights under applicable U.S. federal securities laws or any other laws whose applicability is 
not permitted to be contractually waived.
