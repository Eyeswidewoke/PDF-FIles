recover upon the security or indemnity provided therefor to the extent of any loss, damage, cost 
or expense incurred by the Applicable Issuers, the Trustee and the Transfer Agent in connection 
therewith. 
In case any such mutilated, defaced, destroyed, lost or stolen Security has become 
due and payable, the Applicable Issuers in their discretion may, instead of issuing a new 
Security, pay such Security without requiring surrender thereof except that any mutilated or 
defaced Security shall be surrendered. 
Upon the issuance of any new Security under this Section 2.7, the Applicable 
Issuers may require the payment by the Holder thereof of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or 
other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses 
(including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith. 
Every new Security issued pursuant to this Section 2.7 in lieu of any mutilated, 
defaced, destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall constitute an original additional contractual 
obligation of the Applicable Issuers and such new Security shall be entitled, subject to the second 
paragraph of this Section 2.7, to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately 
with any and all other Securities of the same Class duly issued hereunder. 
The provisions of this Section 2.7 are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent 
lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, 
defaced, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities. 
Section 2.8 
Payment of Principal and Interest and Other Amounts; Principal 
and Interest Rights Preserved. 
(a) 
The Senior Notes of each Class shall accrue interest during each Periodic 
Interest Accrual Period at the applicable Note Interest Rate and such interest will be payable in 
arrears on each Payment Date, except as otherwise set forth below. The Income Notes shall not 
bear a stated rate of interest but will be entitled to receive distributions out of Interest Proceeds 
and Principal Proceeds on each Payment Date if and to the extent funds are available for such 
purpose and to the extent provided by the Priority of Payments. Payment of interest on each 
Class of Senior Notes will be subordinated to the payments of interest on the related Priority 
Classes, if any. So long as any Priority Classes are Outstanding with respect to any Class of 
Deferred Interest Notes, any payment of interest due on such Class of Deferred Interest Notes 
which is not available to be paid ("Deferred Interest" with respect thereto) in accordance with the 
Priority of Payments on any Payment Date shall not be considered "due and payable" for the 
purposes of Section 5.1(a) (and the failure to pay such interest shall not be an Event of Default) 
until the earlier of (i) the Payment Date on which such interest is available to be paid in 
accordance with the Priority of Payments and (ii) the Maturity Date or the date of redemption in 
full of such Class of Notes. Deferred Interest on any Class of Deferred Interest Notes shall be 
payable on the first Payment Date on which funds are available to be used for such purpose in 
accordance with the Priority of Payments. Interest will cease to accrue on each Senior Note, or 
in the case of a partial repayment, on such part, from the date of repayment or the respective 
Maturity Date unless payment of principal is improperly withheld or unless default is otherwise 
made with respect to such payments of principal. To the extent lawful and enforceable, interest
