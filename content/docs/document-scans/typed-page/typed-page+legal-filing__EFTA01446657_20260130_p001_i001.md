FX Blueprint: Thin end of the wedge 
Hard to See FUR Story Gut Any Better 
The EUR was the star performer in 2013, despite a 
strong dollar elsewhere. The Euro-area's large current 
account surplus has helped, which has pushed the 
basic balance into positive territory and in the past has 
been associated with broad-based EUR-appreciation. It 
is for this reason that we expect the EUR to continue to 
hold up relatively well against many GIO FX. Looking at 
drivers more relevant to EUR/USD however, the 
positive factors that have driven strength versus the 
dollar have peaked. 
First, interest rate differentials should turn lower over 
2014. Looking across different tenors as well as bond 
versus implied forward yields, we find that the euro is 
most sensitive to short-dated forward-implied yields. 
Last year short-end European yields moved higher not 
only on the back of ECB LTRO liquidity withdrawal, but 
as the cross-currency basis also moved back to flat for 
the first time since 2008 (chart 1). For this year, the 
risks are skewed the other way. There is less than 
200bn EUR of excess liquidity left, EONIA is back to the 
ref i rate and cross-currency basis is flat, so there is no 
room left for higher short-end European yields. In 
contrast, the ECB retains a strong easing bias and 
negative rates or additional liquidity injections remain a 
strong possibility. 
On the flow side, the best is behind us as well. Portfolio 
inflows into the Euro-area have been dominated by 
equity, but cumulative purchases are now back to 
trend and on a relative valuation basis Euro-area 
equities are at a 10-year high. On the outflows side, 
European offshore investment remains very pro-cyclical, 
so an improving cycle should lead to a pick-up in Euro-
area outflows (chart 2). Add to that the peak in the 
current account surplus on the back of recovering 
domestic demand and the risk of additional ECB easing, 
and we like buying a 1 .42p/1.34c EUR/USD risk 
reversal for zero cost. 
(a) Other Dollar Crosses to Short 
Looking outside of EUR/USD, NZD. SOD, and CHF are 
our top shorts. The Swiss franc is a higher beta version 
of EUR/USD, with valuations more stretched and 
greater potential for capital outflows. NZD and SGD are 
the most over-valued currencies in the world, having 
lagged all other FX in the USD appreciation that has 
materialized so far. We therefore like buying USD vs. 
NZD, CHF and SGD. This basket has a steady -80% 
correlation with both the narrow and broad USD trade-
weighted indices over the last ten years.
