OBS Client Relationship Agreement 
Institutional Sweep Funds and Automatic Exchanges 
We may offer Institutional Sweep Funds as Sweep Options or Secondary Sweep Options 
for clients (except for Plans and IRAs in investment advisory programs) who meet certain 
minimum asset thresholds. Current eligibility criteria may be obtained from your Financial 
Advisor. UBS may change the eligibility criteria at any time in its discretion without notice 
to you. Institutional Sweep Funds will generally offer a higher yield than other Sweep 
Funds, though there is no guarantee that the yield will be, or will remain, higher. 
If you are eligible for an Institutional Sweep Fund as either your Sweep Fund or your 
Secondary Sweep Option for one of the Bank Sweep Programs, we will liquidate your 
shares in your current Sweep Fund or your Secondary Sweep Option, as applicable, and 
purchase shares in the Institutional Sweep Fund with the same investment objectives 
without direction from you. Thereafter, your Sweep Fund or Secondary Sweep Option, as 
applicable, will be the Institutional Sweep Fund. Once an Account's Sweep Option or 
Secondary Sweep Option, as applicable, is an Institutional Sweep Fund and a first purchase 
has been made into the Fund, that Institutional Sweep Fund will remain the Account's 
Sweep Option or Secondary Sweep Option even if the Account's Marketing Relationship 
assets cease to meet the minimum asset thresholds for that Institutional Sweep Fund. 
Clients other than Mans and Plan Participants 
Your eligibility for the Institutional Sweep Funds will be determined at the end of each 
month, based on the value of your Marketing Relationship assets as determined in the sole 
discretion of UBS. If the value of your Marketing Relationship assets reaches the minimum 
asset threshold at any time other than the end of the month, you will not be eligible for an 
Institutional Sweep Fund. 
Plans and Plan Participants 
A Plan's eligibility for the Institutional Sweep Funds will be determined at the end of each 
month, based on the value of the Plan's QP Relationship assets, as determined in the sole 
discretion of UBS. A Plan Participant's eligibility for the Institutional Sweep Funds will be 
determined at the end of each month, based on the greater of the value of the Plan's QP 
Relationship assets and the Plan Participant's Marketing Relationship assets, both as 
determined in the sole discretion of UBS. If the value of a Plan's QP Relationship assets or a 
Plan Participant's Marketing Relationship assets reaches the minimum asset threshold at 
any time other than the end of the month, the Plan or Plan Participant will not be eligible 
for an Institutional Sweep Fund. 
Check Writing 
Many UBS accounts incorporate a check writing feature. If you choose this feature for your 
account, you authorize us and our Check Provider to honor checks that bear your 
signature(s) and unsigned drafts that are presented on the basis of separate written 
authorization from you to the payee. These checks may be used only in conjunction with 
your accounts and only up to the account's "Withdrawal Limit' as defined in the General 
Terms and Conditions in the Agreements and Disclosures booklet. We will deduct funds 
from your Accounts and reimburse the Check Provider in federal funds when checks or 
drafts are presented to the Check Provider. We may delay or deny payment if there are 
insufficient available assets in your Account to cover payment on the day you write the 
check or authorize the draft through the day on which we deduct funds from your 
accounts to pay the check or draft.
