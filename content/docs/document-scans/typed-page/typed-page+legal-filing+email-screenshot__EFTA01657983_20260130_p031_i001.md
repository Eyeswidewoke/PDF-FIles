coalition of a dozen urban teachers' unions and the Democratic Socialists of America, offered 
Monday a taste of things to come by holding multiple events across the nation in opposition to 
local reopening plans as part of a National Day of Resistance." 
Reuters (8/3, O'Brien) reports teachers and staff at "more than 35 school districts across 
the United States on Monday staged protests over plans to resume in-class instruction." The 
protesters are demanding schools delay reopening "until scientific data supports such a move." 
They are also calling for districts" to wait until safety protocols such as lower class sizes and 
virus testing are established, and schools are staffed with an adequate number of counselors 
and nurses, according to a website set up for the demonstrations." 
A Wall Street Journal (8/3, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) editorial criticizes the 
American Federation of Teachers for supporting the strikes. The Journal also argues that 
teachers unions should not call for the closure of private schools in districts that are remote-
only. Instead, the Journal says parents should be given their taxpayer dollars to decide where 
and how to educate their children. 
NYTimes Analysis: Guidelines On School Closures Due To Coronavirus Vague. 
The New York Times (8/3, Mervosh, Hubler, 18.61M) reports that "with the first schools open 
barely a week, one question is quickly arising: How many positive cases should it take to close 
down again?" According to the limes, it is a question "to which education leaders have received 
vague, sometimes conflicting answers from state and local officials, with widely varying 
standards in different parts of the country." Federal recommendations "leave the decisions 
largely up to schools," but "the uncertainty means that superintendents and other 
administrators are being asked to make decisions for which they are often ill-equipped, said 
Noelle Ellerson Ng, an associate executive director at AASA, the School Superintendents 
Association." 
Congress Demands Universities Provide Records Of Foreign Donations. 
The New York Post (8/3, Bowden, 4.57M) reports Congress wrote to "the nation's top 
universities on Monday demanding they hand over all records of donations they have accepted 
from foreign governments and rogue regimes, citing concerns that the multimillion-dollar gifts 
are a growing national security threat." The letters "obtained by The Post were sent to the 
presidents of six of the country's leading colleges - including Harvard, NYU and Yale - after a 
Department of Education investigation this year found American universities had accepted $6.4 
billion of hidden foreign donations." The schools - which also include the University of Chicago, 
the University of Delaware, and the University of Pennsylvania - "now have one week to 
produce all unredacted records of gifts, contracts and agreements with foreign governments 
since January 2015." 
Trump Seeks To Replace TVA Chair Over Hiring Of Foreign Workers. 
The AP (8/3, Miller) reports that on Monday, President Trump "said...that he had fired the chair 
of the Tennessee Valley Authority, criticizing the federal-owned corporation for hiring foreign 
workers." Trump "told reporters at the White House that he was formally removing chair Skip 
Thompson and another member of the board, and he threatened to remove other board 
members if they continued to hire foreign labor." The AP adds that Trump "also said the TVA 
board must immediately hire a new chief executive officer who `puts the interests of Americans 
first.' According to Trump, the CEO, Jeff Lyash, earns $8 million a year." Trump is quoted as 
saying, "The new CEO must be paid no more than $500,000 a year. ... Let this serve as a 
warning to any federally appointed board: If you betray American workers, you will hear two 
words: `You're fired." 
The New York Times (8/3, Shear, 18.61M) recounts that "after reading from a note 
handed to him by an aide, the president said that Mr. Lyash had called the White House and had 
`indicated a very strong willingness to reverse course." The Times adds that "attendees at the
