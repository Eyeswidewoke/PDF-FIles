Special Report: EMFX Outlook 2018: Growth'led Revaluation 
kRV: The currency goes into next year with tailwinds 
from strong data and expectations of further policy 
tightening. The current account should benefit from 
improvement in shipbuilding orders, and the impact of 
relations normalizing with China on the services deficit 
- and while the overall surplus might decline, the 
adjustment would likely be gradual. Equity valuations 
are still supportive and trade policy related pressures 
continue to keep the authorities from intervening in any 
significant manner in the revaluation of the currency. 
Geopolitics remains a key risk, but the market appears 
fatigued with the headlines, and are likely to be averse 
to trading the noise.

yr, ,; The main appeal is its cheapness on fundamental 
valuation metrics (earlier chart). Foreign positioning in 
bonds is light from a historical perspective (chart 
below), and inflows are returning. Therefore, it is a rare 
case where both 'stock' factors (valuation, positioning) 
and 'flow' factors (portfolio inflows) are supportive. 
Further, the absence of an active NDF market has 
tamed both speculation and USD betas.

On the fundamental front, growth has surprised to the 
upside (therefore providing an attractive growth-
valuations mix), the central bank has turned more 
hawkish (BNM could well be the next central bank in 
the region to hike rates), and higher oil prices should 
also provide a boost to Mr% (Malaysia is the only net 
oil exporter in Asia). There is a clear need to 
accumulate 
reserves, 
but 
authorities 
appear 
comfortable with a stronger MYR, perhaps given the 
boost that entails to confidence ahead of an election.

d 1' 1.)". Both PLN and HUF are within a handful 
of currencies that are undervalued on all three of our 
fundamental valuation approaches (PPP, DBeer, FEER) 
on steady depreciation over the past 5 years despite 
improving fundamentals. Consequently, on a REER 
basis, PLN and HUF have depreciated significantly vs. 
Asian manufacturing currencies among others enabling 
them to gain market share in global trade. This has led 
to vast improvements in current account balances -
from deep deficits in 2008, current accounts are in 
surplus for Hungary and close to flat for Poland. 
Meanwhile, growth is strong (well above trend) and 
broad-based (the growth-valuations mix is attractive), 
and labor markets are tight.

Technically,

past 15 months is an attractive entry level. Further, we 
believe the NBH is comfortable with a stronger HUF on 
rising inflation and current account in surplus. Once the 
elections are completed in Q2 2018 there is a 
possibility that the NBH becomes even taxer with 
respect to the currency, opening up more room for
