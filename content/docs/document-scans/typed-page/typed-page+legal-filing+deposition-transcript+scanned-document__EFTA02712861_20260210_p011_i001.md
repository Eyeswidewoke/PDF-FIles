4) The rise of Federica Mogherini. In November, Mogherini will replace Catherine Ashton as the European Union's high 
representative for foreign affa=rs and security policy, the continent's top foreign-policy job. In that po=ition, the 41-year 
old Mogherini, who was appointed in August, will negotiate the peri=ous situations in Russia, Ukraine, Iran, North Africa, 
the Middle East, and Chi=a. She will also preside over the Foreign Affairs Council, which is comprised =f Europe's 27 
foreign ministers, and direct the European External Act=on Service, a fiendishly complicated bureaucracy of 3,500 
diplomats scattered throughou= the world. And what is Mogherini's main qualification? Six months a= Italy's foreign 
minister. Most experts agree that she is woefully unprepared for su=h an important post. For example, Paola Subacchi of 
London's Chatham =ouse writes: 
<=span> 
No one doubts that Mogherini will try her best to learn the nitty-gritty of her new job, but it will be =ike learning to fly by 
piloting a jumbo jet. Most of the time, an inexperienced pilot can avoid serious problems by relying on her more 
experienced crew an= various technologies. But in the event of severe turbulence, only a pilot w=th sufficient skill and 
practice will be able to maintain control of the aircr=ft and keep the passengers calm. 
So it is disturbing, to say th= least, that with Ukraine at war with Russia, and the Middle East in a spira=ing crisis of 
fanaticism, Europe's leaders did not seek a candidate wit= a proven ability to forge an effective foreign policy from 
different—and oft=n opposite—positions. EU foreign policy is now being piloted by an ap=rentice. 
Most observers also agree that by tapping Mogherini for this role, Europe has sent a clear message that it's not really 
interest=d in having a common foreign policy and instead prefers a weak official who will let ea=h foreign minister 
pursue his or her country's own agenda. European l=aders, it seems, do not take seriously the idea that their continent's 
weight=in the world depends on the ability of its member nations to act together.<=p> 
5) =he other airplane accident. Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 =asn't this summer's only geopolitically significant 
aviation tragedy. On Augus= 13, the Brazilian presidential candidate Eduardo Campos was flying in a private jet when it 
crashed in poor weather conditions as it was landing at an airport =ear Sao Paulo. Up until then, the reelection of 
President Dilma Rousseff i= October elections seemed a near certainty that would guarantee four more years in office 
for the political elite that has governed Brazil since 2003. But the polls have tightened since Marina Silva, who had been 
Campos's vice-presidential candidate, replaced him in the race. She now has a real chance of beating Dilma. If that 
happens, it could bring about many changes=in Brazil, including the reflexive solidarity that its leaders have offered 
La=in American governments with awful human-rights records. Democracy may have a better chance in countries like 
Bolivia, Ecuador, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, where for the past decade human rights, freedom of expression, and 
politica= liberties have been severely and systematically curtailed with the silent a=quiescence of the region's largest 
country.
