FILTER CONTROLS 
Most speakers are not designed to reproduce 
the full range of frequencies audible by the human 
ear. For this reason, most speaker systems are 
comprised of multiple speakers, each dedicated 
to reproducing a specific frequency range. Filters 
are used to select which frequency range is sent 
to each section of a speaker system. The division 
of frequency ranges to different speakers can be 
done with passive filters (coils and/or capacitors 
between the amplifier outputs and the speakers). 
which are acceptable and commonly used 
for filtering between mid-range speakers and 
tweeters. Filtering between subwoofer systems 
and satellite speaker systems is best done with 
active filters, which cut off frequency content at 
the input to the amplifier. Active filters are more 
stable than passive filters and do not introduce 
extraneous resistance, which can degrade 
subwoofer performance. 
The active filter built into each channel section 
of the M600!6 can be used to eliminate potentially 
harmful and/or undesired frequencies from 
making their way through the amplifier sections 
to the speaker(s). This serves to improve tonal 
balance and to avoid distortion and possible 
speaker failure. Correct use of these filters can 
substantially increase the longevity and fidelity of 
your audio system.

I) "Filter Mode' Control: The M600/6 employs a 
12dB per octave filter for each pair of channels 
(one filter for channels l&2, another filter for 
channels 3/361 and a third filter for channels 
S&6). Each of these filters can be configured 
independently into one of two filter types 
or defeated completely by way of the three. 
position "Filter Mode' switches: 
'Ofr: Defeats the filter completely. allowing 
the full range of frequencies present at the 
inputs to feed the amplifier. This is useful for 
systems utilizing outboard active crossovers or 
requiring full rangc reproduction from one or 
more of the M600/6's channel pain. 
"LP" (Low•Pass): Configures the filter to 
attenuate frequencies above the selected filter 
frequency at a rate of 12dB per octave. This is 
useful for connection of subwookr(s) to one 
or more of the M600/6's channel pairs in a 
bi-amplified system. 
"HP* (High-Pass): Configures the filter to 
attenuate frequencies below the selected filter 
frequency at a rate of 12dB per octave. This is 
useful for connection of component speakers to 
one or more of the M600/6's channel pairs in a 
14-amplified system. 
2) 'Filter Freq. (In)" The filter frequency 
markings surrounding this rotary control 
are for reference purposes and are generally 
accurate to within 1/3 octave or better. If you 
would like to select the filter cutoff frequency 
with a higher level of precision, consult the 
chart in Appendix B (page 15). 
Toning Hint: If you are using the M60O/6 
to drive a subwoofer system ("LP" mode). a 
component satellite speaker system ("HP" mode) 
or both, 80 Hz is a good baseline "Filter Freq. 
war setting. After properly adjusting the 'Input 
Sens.; as outlined In Appendix A (page 14). you 
can fine tune the "Filter Freq. (Hz)* control to 
achieve the desired system frequency response. 
REMOTE LEVEL CONTROL (OPTIONAL) 
p la f 
017 t: 
With the addition of the optional Remote 
Level Control (HD-RIC), you can control the 
volume of one, two or all three channel pairs of 
the M600/6 from a location of your choosing. 
This is useful for subwoofer level control, cabin 
speaker level control, zone volume control or 
even as a master volume control for the entire 
system. 
The HD-RIC connects to the jack labeled 
"Remote Level Control" on the Connection Panel 
of the amplifier using a standard tekphone cable 
(supplied with the HD-RLC). If desired, multiple 
XD (and HD) amplifiers can be controlled from 
a single HD-RLC controller suing a simple phone 
line "splitter" and multiple phone cables. 
When connected to the amplifier, the 
HD-RIC operates as follows. At full counter-
clockwise rotation, the audio will mute 
completely. At full clockwise rotation the level 
will be the same as If the IlD.RIC was not 
connected at all. In other words, it operates 
strictly as a level alternator.

"Remote Level Mode" Switch: This switch 
allows you to assign the operation of the 
HD-RIC to one, two or all three pairs of 
channels. In the "AU* position, the HD-RIC 
knob will affect all three channel pairs equally. 
In the '3-61* (middle) position, only the level 
of channels 3, 4, 5 and 6 will be affected by the 
HD-R LC knob (channels 1 & 2 will not). 
In the "5&C position. only the level of 
channels 5 and 6 will be affected by the HD.RLC 
knob (channels 1.2. 3 and 4 will not).
