II December 2013 
GEM Equity Strategy Outlook 2014 
• 
Much of the relative value resides in the financial sector, where EM 
price-to-book valuations appear very low relative to ROE both in 
absolute terms and relative to their historical relationship. We believe 
that this shift is due mainly to a very high level of investor scepticism 
about the level of potential NPLs in the BRIC markets in particular, 
which is entirely rational in our view. By contrast, DM financials are 
trading in line with their historic valuation/return relationship. 
• 
The majority of non-financial sectors within GEM have margins which 
have underperformed their DM peers; the overall ROE for EM non-
financial stocks is now below the level of DM non-financials, based on 
an aggregate margin which has now almost converged with DM, 
having historically been much higher. 
• 
There is a pronounced polarisation of valuations within the EM 
universe on an ROE versus P/BV basis between sectors both in 
absolute terms (Figure 2) and relative to DM (Figure 3). where 
valuations and returns are more closely correlated. Financials and 
Energy stocks have extremely low valuations, while the Healthcare 
and Consumer Staples sectors appear very expensive. We identified 
this gap as the biggest reason to be bearish EM one year ago because 
it is driven by aversion towards those sectors which face the most 
severe structural challenges, and nothing has changed in the past 
twelve months.

Bette, governance and For growth necessary to unlock yalue. in EM equities 
Given the extremely high level of valuations for the better governed higher ROE 
sectors, the prospects for an upwards re-rating of EM in either absolute or 
relative terms depends on prospects improving for the value-related markets 
and sectors in our view. There are two potential catalysts. First is faster global 
growth, which would revive the more cyclical and commodity-related sectors -
China is an especially important source of demand but one which would 
benefit from an acceleration of economic activity in developed economies via 
increased export demand. Second is that the markets may begin to detect a 
marginal improvement in governance within EM, at either the sovereign and/or 
the corporate level. We are sceptical that DM growth will come to the rescue 
as in 2002-07, whilst there is very little indication of an incrementally positive 
shift in governance across most emerging markets in our view, with the partial 
exception of Mexico. (Rhetoric versus reality; governance drivers still mainly 
negative, 6 November 2013).
