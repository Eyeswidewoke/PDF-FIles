FX Blueprint: Dashing Buck 
Meanwhile in Sweden imported deflation is dragging 
headline CPI further below the Riksbank's projection (in 
April -0.5% YoY vs the -0.2% projection). For the 
inflation targeting Riksbank this should mean further 
policy easing, and it might result in further cuts. 
However, as the majority on the board has made clear, 
they are not entirely comfortable reducing rates further 
in response to external disinflation when house prices 
are edging higher and households take on more debt. 
Also, further rate reductions would not necessarily 
support demand since the slowdown was/is due to 
weak sentiment and a poor external environment. 
Meanwhile in the real economy, data is generally a 
mixed bag, with a few very early indications of a 
turnaround. Retail sales are largely stable, and 
consumer sentiment is back in the positives, backed up 
by higher property prices and surging equities. In the 
manufacturing sector the PMI remains just below the 
50 benchmark line, but hard industrial data has 
improved significantly of late, with industrial output up 
0.8% on the month in March for a flat YoY reading, 
while the more forward looking new orders component 
rose a sharp 10.5% MoM and 11.2% YoY, the highest 
YoY outturn for 2 years. 
So where does this leave the krona? On the back of the 
CPI report the rates market is almost fully priced for a 
further 25bp rate cut over the next two meetings. This 
to us seems about right, as even given the reluctance 
of the Riksbank neutrals to solely focus on the CPI, 
they can also not ignore headline CPI when it is 
running so much below target. However, at current 
levels (8.65) we also see limited downside in the SEK 
vs the EUR. In the current environment and at current 
policy rate levels, policy expectations can only impact 
on the SEK to a degree, with positive flows dynamics 
(C/A surplus a solid/steady 7-7.5%. of GDP), attractive 
valuations (see DB's BEER, FEER and PPPs), and more 
near-term a lack of positioning (SEK a net short on 
dbSelect, investors have not been this short the krone 
for almost a year). Therefore we believe the probability 
of further rate reductions in the SEK is best captured in 
short SEK vs the NOK, where the CPI gap will continue 
to underpin expectations for a wider policy rate gap. 
Look for a return to the highs from late last year. Our 
initial target is 1.1775, with a stop just below 1.12.
