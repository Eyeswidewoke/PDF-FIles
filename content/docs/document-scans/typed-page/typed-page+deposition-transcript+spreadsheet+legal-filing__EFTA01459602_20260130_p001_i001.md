FX Blueprint: Forever Young 
Theme#6: Don't Toshin the towel — buy USD/JPY 
It's too early to turn bearish USD/JPY. Japanese 
dip-buying and BoJ alertness should support 
USD/JPY around 118 though offer limited upside. 
Buy USD/JPY but take profit at 125. 
Japan's current account: The force awakens not 
Japan's balance of payments continues to support 
USD/JPY and has not turned bearish. On the trade side, 
although the trade deficit has shrunk to close to zero, 
this is largely because falling energy import prices have 
offset the export drag from stuttering growth and 
depreciation in developing Asia. As oil prices approach 
rock-bottom, the windfall should peter out, while 
export headwinds from Asia persist. On the hedging 
side, the recent widening of the cross-currency basis 
acts as a new deterrent to currency hedging which 
corporates have been foregoing over the last year even 
in the face of a stalling USD/JPY uptrend. 
Even without a contribution from trade, the current 
account posts a comfortable surplus thanks to vast 
investment income. Yet the entire current account 
surplus is used up by net FDI abroad. Indeed, retained 
earnings comprise a large chunk of both the current 
account surplus and FDI outflows. These are offsetting 
accounting entries rather than cross-border flows, and 
their sheer size stabilizes the CA/FDI ratio. For now, 
Japanese corporates enjoy the earnings power to keep 
investing. Hence, FDI flows will give little impetus to 
the yen in either direction. 
GPIF. The empire can strike back 
Portfolio flows therefore are the potential swing factor 
on Japan's BoP. Although monthly volatility has picked 
up, the quarterly trend of large net outflows is intact. 
Dollar demand from the GPIF and other institutional 
investors is less consistent and price-sensitive than in 
the halcyon days of the re-allocation trade. The GPIF is 
soon to reach its benchmark allocations to foreign 
assets, 
completing 
the 
mechanical 
rotation. 
Nonetheless, it retains some firepower, and the 
discretionary bands around the benchmarks allow for 
tactical trading. Other institutional investors also 
continue to buy dips in the cross, and retail demand 
through toshins has become more than a secondary 
force. The contrarian tactic of Japanese investors also 
means, however, that they tend to take profit on 
squeezes. This underpins our view that USD/JPY will 
stay range-bound over the next four months, though 
short-term volatility could remain high. Japanese 
investors continue to buy USD assets at the expense of 
other currencies, especially in fixed income. Hedging 
ratios remain low. One reason is the widening basis. 
Indeed the flipside is that foreigners have liked 
synthetic exposure to JGBs funded in yen. These 
inflows have at times offset Japanese portfolio 
outflows on the BoP but are in fact FX-neutral.
