Global Climate Change, a NASA website, says 97 percent of climate scienti=ts agree that warming trends over the past 
century are very likely due to =uman activities. Yet the American public isn't as convinced. A y=ar-old survey by Pew 
Research showed 67 percent of Americans believed glob=l warming is occurring and 44 percent said the earth is 
warming mostly bec=use of human activity. More recently, a New York Times poll said 42 =ercent of Republicans say 
global warming won't have a serious impact, = view held by 12 percent of Democrats and 22 percent of independents. 
The rift between developed and developing countries in th= U.N. talks opened up in Copenhagen over a passage on 
what levels of warmi=g could be considered dangerous. After a protracted battle, the text=was dropped from a key 
summary for policy-makers — to the disappoi=tment of some scientists. "If the governments are going=to expect the 
IPCC to do their job," said Princeton professo= Michael Oppenheimer, a lead author of the IPCC's second report, 
they=C24>shouldn't "get caught up in fights that have nothing to d= with the IPCC." The omission meant the word 
&qu=t;dangerous" disappeared from the summary altogether.O=A0 It appeared only twice in a longer underlying report 
compared to seven =imes in a draft produced before the Copenhagen session. In its place=the less loaded word "risk" 
was mentioned 65 ti=es in the final 40-page summary. "Rising rates and magn=tudes of warming and other changes in 
the climate system, accompanied by o=ean acidification, increase the risk of severe, pervasive, and in some cas=s 
irreversible detrimental impacts," the report said.=/p> 
World governments in 2009 set a goal of keeping the tempera=ure rise below 2 degrees C (3.6 F) compared to before 
the industrial revol=tion. Temperatures have gone up about 0.8 C (1.4 F) since the 19th c=ntury. Emissions have risen 
so fast in recent years that the world h=s used up two-thirds of its carbon budget, the maximum amount of CO2 that =an 
be emitted to have a likely chance of avoiding 2 degrees of warming, th= IPCC report said. "This report makes it clear 
that if =ou are serious about the 2-degree goal ... there is nowhere to hide,"=C2t>said Alden Meyer of the Union of 
Concerned Scientists, an advocac= group. "You can't wait several decades to address this =ssue."

U.S. Secretary of State John =erry said the report demands "ambitious, decisive and immedia=e action." "Those who 
choose to ignore or dispute the science so=clearly laid out in this report do so at great risk for all of us and for =ur kids 
and grandkids," Kerry said in a statement. The=IPCC said the cost of actions such as shifting to solar and wind power 
and=other renewable sources and improving energy efficiency would reduce econo=ic growth only by 0.06 percent 
annually. Pachauri said that should b= measured against the implications of doing nothing, putting "=all species that live 
on this planet" at peril. 
Bob Ward, policy director at the LSE's Grantham Research =nstitute on Climate Change, said the report made clear it 
was 4>=804>still technically possible to avoid dangerous climate change"= but that required emissions reductions would 
"on=y be possible if action starts immediately". "If str=ng action is not well underway by 2020, the chance of avoiding 
dangerous c=imate change will be very small, if indeed possible at all," =/i>he said. "I think there will be an international 
=greement in Paris next year, but the commitments by individual countries t= cut emissions will not be consistent with 
the goal of avoiding global war=ing of more than 2C." "World leaders may wait until =here is even more evidence of the 
damaging impacts of climate change befor= they accelerate action to cut emissions, but any further delay will incre=se 
the magnitude of the risks the world faces."
