"Sweetheart deal!" =o goes the attack on the resolution of a long-ago federal 
investigation in=olving our former client -- and now-friend -- Jeffrey Epstein. The a=tack is profoundly misplaced, 
supported neither by the law or the facts, n=r by the structure of our constitutional republic. To the contrary, =effrey 
was subjected to an aggressive federal intrusion into what would ty=ically be considered a quintessentially local criminal 
matter in south Flo=ida. His offense — at its core, sexual favors for =ire — has long been treated as a matter entrusted 
to law= of the several States, not the federal government. His conduct =AO— while clearly unlawful and for which he 
has accepted full=C2 responsibility — was a classic state offense and was bei=g treated exactly that way by able, honest 
prosecutors in Palm Beach Count=. Nevertheless, far from going "soft" on the =A0matter and without invitation from 
the state, the federal government int=rvened. Ironically, now many for their own opportunistic reasons are=criticizing 
the federal decision-makers at the time, including now-Secreta=y of Labor Alex Acosta (then the United States Attorney 
in south Florida),=for not going far enough. 
The critics are wrong on the facts and the =aw. 
<=ont size="4">Here are the true key facts: Jeffrey Epstein, a succe=sful self-
made businessman with no prior criminal history whatsoever, enga=ed in illegal conduct that amounts to solicitation of 
prostitution. =is conduct was wrong and a violation of Florida state law. Although =o coercion, violence, alcohol, drugs 
or the like were involved, some of th= women he paid were under the age of 18. Those facts were carefully assessed by 
experienced state prosecut=rs who aggressively enforce state criminal laws. No one turned a bli=d eye to potential 
offenses to the public order. To the contrary, th= Palm Beach State Attorney's Office conducted an extensive 15-month 
in=estigation, led by the chief of the Sex Crimes Division. Mr. Epstein=was then indicted by a state grand jury on a single 
felony count of soliciration of prostitution. 
During that intense investigation, the =tate prosecutors extensively gathered 
and analyzed the evidence, met face-to-face with many of the asserted vict=ms, considered their credibility -- or lack 
thereof -- and considered the =xtent of exculpatory evidence. After months of negotiations, the sta=e prosecutors 
believed they had reached a reasoned resolution of the matte= that vindicated the public interest -- a resolution entirely 
consistent w=th that of cases involving other similarly-situated defendants. The =ystem worked as it should. 
Then, in came the feds. The U=ited States Attorney's Office extensively and 
aggressively investigate= whether Mr. Epstein had engaged in a commercial human trafficking ring, t=rgeting minors. 
But that's not what this was, and the f=deral authorities ultimately acknowledged that, deferring prosecution to t=e 
state. But not without conditions. The federal prosecutors i=sisted on many unorthodox requirements that Mr. 
Epstein's experien=ed defense team had never seen imposed on any defendant anywhere. </=ont>Under the federally-
forced deal, Jeffrey was =A0required to request that the state prosecutors demand the imposition of = jail sentence and 
lifetime sex-offender registration, which would no= have otherwise been required under the previously agreed-upon 
state dispo=ition of this prostitution charge. Jeffrey accepted full r=sponsibility for his conduct, complied with the feds' 
demands= served his sentence, and in the process was treated exactly the same as o=her state-incarcerated individuals. 
His conduct while in custody was=exemplary, and so characterized by the state custodial authorities. =/font> 
Our friend Jeffrey Epstein has paid his debt to society. He ha= also paid out 
millions of dollars to the asserted victims and their lawye=s. For over ten years, he has lived a good and law-abiding life,
