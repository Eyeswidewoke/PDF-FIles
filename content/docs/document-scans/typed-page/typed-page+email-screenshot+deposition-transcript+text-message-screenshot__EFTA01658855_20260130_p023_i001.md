12% of these patients are expected to be hospitalized." The San Francisco Chronicle (11/30, 
Koseff, 2.67M) reports hospitalizations "increased by 89% over the past two weeks to 7,787, 
the governor said. At the current rate, that number could double or triple in the next month." 
Meanwhile, Politico (11/30, Colliver, 4.29M) also reports Newsom on Monday "highlighted 
what the state was doing to support its small businesses as he signaled the possibility of a stay-
at-home order in the coming weeks - and acknowledged the inevitable economic toll of such 
measures." According to Politico, Newsom "said he would direct the Department of Tax and Fee 
Administration to make automatic a three-month sales tax extension that he first unveiled in 
April for businesses with less than $1 million in sales on their tax returns and to expand 
interest-free payment options for larger businesses suffering from public health restrictions," 
and he "announced a $500 million COVID Relief Grant run by the California Office of the Small 
Business Advocate at GO-Biz, which he said will distribute grants of up to $25,000 to small 
businesses and nonprofit organizations by early next year." 
Cuomo Announces Five-Pronged "Winter Plan" For COVID Surge. 
The New York Times (11/30, McKinley, Ferre-Sadurni, 18.61M) reports New York Gov. Andrew 
Cuomo (D) on Monday "said...the state will implement a barrage of new emergency actions, 
some of which echo the strict measures taken this spring, to stem a rising tide of infections and 
deaths." Cuomo "said that the strength of the virus's second wave has forced the state to rely 
less on test positivity rates as the determinant for restrictions, and focus more on hospital 
capacity." He "said if hospitals become overwhelmed, he could impose a regionally based 
shutdown, or `pause' order," and "asked hospitals to begin identifying retired doctors and nurses 
to help staff medical facilities." 
CNN (11/30, Jorgensen, 83.16M) reports on its website that Cuomo said, "We are now 
worried about overwhelming the hospital system." He added, "We want to know where they are 
today with their capacity, with their PPE, et cetera." According to Cuomo, "We learned this 
lesson the hard way. We have about 54,000 hospital beds in this state, we were told we would 
need about 120,000. We lived this nightmare. We learned from this nightmare, and we're going 
to correct for the lessons we learned during this nightmare." The Washington Post (11/30, 
Farzan, Noack, Iati, Taylor, Shammas, Telford, 14.2M) reports New York officials "are directing 
hospitals to initiate emergency measures, including identifying retired health-care workers who 
could return to duty, as officials try to beat back a rise in hospitalizations statewide." 
Politico New York (11/30, Young, Gronewold, 4.29M) reports Cuomo "announced the 
actions as part of a new five-pronged `winter plan' that seeks to combat Covid-19 through a 
new Department of Health initiative on hospital capacity, enhanced testing, K-8 in-person 
learning, a public education campaign on small gatherings and vaccine distribution." Meanwhile, 
the New York Daily News (11/30, Slattery, Skolnik, 2.52M) says that while New York "has been 
relying on the number of reported positive coronavirus cases in geographic areas to impose 
limited restrictions meant to curb the spread," it will begin using "new metrics including 
hospitalization rates, death rates, and hospital capacity...to tweak the state's current color-
coded microcluster strategy." 
However, the New York Post (11/30, Hogan, Campanile, Sheehy, 4.57M) says that while 
Cuomo "crowed to reporters that his push for mask-wearing helped curb New York's COVID-19 
cases," his aides "sat in the closed room without ever putting theirs on." According to the Post, 
Cuomo "wasn't wearing a mask at the time, nor were his five top aides on the dais, including 
state Health Commissioner Howard Zucker and SUNY Chancellor Jim Malatras." 
New York City To Allow Younger Grades, Students With Special Needs To Return 
To In-Person Classes. The Washington Post (11/30, Balingit, 14.2M) reports New York City 
Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) on Sunday "announced...that he would begin to allow the city's 
youngest students and those with special needs to return to classrooms beginning next week, 
abandoning a previous plan that forced the entire school system to close 10 days ago and 
marking another disruption in an already challenging school year." Of the families "who have
