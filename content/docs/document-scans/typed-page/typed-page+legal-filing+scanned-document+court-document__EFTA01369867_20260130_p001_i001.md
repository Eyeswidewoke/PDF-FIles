owned by Intel or its affiliates. represents at least 67% of Mobileye's issued capital (geplaarst kapiraal) (or 80%, 
if the Mobileye shareholders have not approved the Pre-Wired Asset Sale Resolutions and the Conversion 
Resolutions). then the cash consideration paid by Purchaser to Mobikye in the Asset Sale would be an aggregate 
amount equal to the Offer Consideration multiplied by the total number of Shares held by non-tendering 
Mobileye shareholders as of the expiration of the Subsequent Offering Period and, upon consummation of the 
Asset Sale. (a) Mobileye will hold only the cash received in the Asset Sale: (b) Purchaser (or an affiliate of 
Purchaser) would (i) own all of Mobileye's business operations and (ii) be the principal shareholder in Mobileye: 
and (c) the non-tendering Mobileye shareholders would continue to own Shares representing, in the aggregate, a 
minority of the Shares then outstanding. As soon as practicable following consummation of the Asset Sale. 
Purchaser (or an affiliate of Purchaser) would then complete the Post-Offer Reorganization by causing Mobileye 
to be liquidated in accordance with applicable Dutch procedures (the "Liquidation"), with Purchaser (or an 
affiliate of Purchaser) providing an indemnity or guarantee to the liquidator in respect of the Liquidation for any 
deficit in the estate of Mobileye to enable the liquidator to make an immediate advance distribution in cash (the 
"Second Step Distribution') to a depositary on behalf of each non-tendering Mobileye shareholder in an amount 
equal to the Offer Consideration, without interest and less applicable withholding taxes, for each Share then 
owned. 
If the number of Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer and not properly withdrawn (including Shares validly 
tendered during the Subsequent Offering Period. as it may be extended by the Minority Exit Offering Period). 
together with the Shares then owned by Intel or its affiliates, represents less than 100% but at least 95% of 
Mobileye's issued capital (geplaata kapiraap, and Purchaser and Intel elect to have Purchaser commence the 
Compulsory Acquisition, Purchaser would then complete the Post-Offer Reorganization by commencing a 
statutory proceeding before the Dutch Court for the Compulsory Acquisition. While Intel and Purchaser will use 
their reasonable best efforts to cause the per Share price paid in the Compulsory Acquisition to be equal to the 
Offer Consideration, the Dutch Court has sole discretion to determine the per Share price, which may be greater 
than, equal to, or less than the Offer Consideration (with such price potentially being increased by Dutch 
Statutory Interest). Upon execution (tenuinvierlegging) of the Dutch Court's ruling in the Compulsory 
Acquisition, each non-tendering Mobileye shareholder will receive the Dutch Court-determined per Share price 
and Purchaser will become the sole shareholder of Mobileye. 
The applicable withholding taxes (including Israeli dividend withholding taxes) and other taxes, if 
any, imposed on Mobileye shareholders who do not tender their Shares pursuant to the Offer (including 
during the Subsequent Offering Period, as it may be extended by the Minority Exit Offering Period) may 
he different from, and greater than, the taxes imposed upon such Mobileye shareholders had they 
tendered their Shares pursuant to the Offer (including during the Subsequent Offering Period, as it may 
be extended by the Minority Exit Offering Period). 
The Offer is conditioned upon, among other things, (a) the absence of the termination of the Purchase 
Agreement in accordance with its terms and (b) the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted by the 
Purchase Agreement and applicable law) of the following as of the scheduled Expiration Time: (i) the Minimum 
Condition (as its threshold may be lowered pursuant to the Purchase Agreement); (ii) the Antitrust Clearance 
Condition: (iii) the Restraints Condition; (iv) the Governance Resolutions Condition; and (v) the Material 
Adverse Effect Condition, each as defined below. 
The "Minimum Condition" requires that there have been validly tendered pursuant to the Offer and not 
properly withdrawn a number of Shares (excluding Shares tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures 
that have not yet been delivered in settlement or satisfaction of such guarantee prior to the Expiration lime) that. 
together with the Shares then owned by huel or its affiliates, represents at least 95% of Mobikye's issued capital 
(gephials: kapiwal) immediately prior to the Expiration Time, provided that this threshold (a) may be lowered by 
Intel. in its sole discretion. to a percentage not less than 80%, (b) will be lowered to 80% if the ITA issues the 
Pre-Wired Asset Sale Ruling, and (c) will be lowered to 67% if (1) the ITA issues the Pre-Wired Asset Sale 
Ruling and (2) the Pre-Wired Asset Sale Resolutions and Conversion Resolutions are adopted at the EGM. 
The "Antitrust Clearance Condition" requires (a) the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting 
period (and extensions thereof) applicable to the Offer and the other transactions contemplated by the Purchase
