Continued Reporting: FBI Warns iPhone And Android Users—Do Not Share These Texts 
Forbes (07/31, Doffman) reported that the FBI is warning iPhone and Android users to be cautious of fraudulent 
texts and voice messages sent by "malicious actors" who aim to gain access to personal accounts, and users should 
never reply to messages from unknown senders. The article added that the bureau advises users to set up two-
factor authentication (2FA) on any account that allows it and never disable it, but notes that most 2FA codes are 
delivered by text, which can be sent to others, and users should never share these codes with anyone. According to 
the FBI, malicious actors may use social engineering techniques to convince users to disclose their 2FA codes, which 
can allow attackers to compromise and take over accounts, and even if the request comes from someone the user 
knows, they should never provide a 2FA code over email, SMS/MMS, or encrypted messaging.
