SOF III - 1081 Southern Financial LLC 
Secondary Opportunities Fund III, LP 
that both the Manager (on behalf of the Fund) and one of the other business lines within Deutsche Bank (as principal or 
on behalf of clients) seek to acquire (or to assist a client to acquire) the same private equity asset, neither will be 
prevented from doing so. 
Deutsche Bank relationships in the private equity market and impact on the Fund 
Deutsche Bank has relationships with a significant number of governments, Fund Sponsors, investment managers, 
portfolio companies, institutions and corporations and provides, and will in the future provide, advisory and/or lending 
services to its clients, which may include portfolio companies held by underlying funds that the Fund is invested in and 
their affiliates. In the course of advising with respect to a particular transaction on behalf of the Fund, the Manager may 
consider those relationships and may decline to recommend an investment in view of such relationships. There may be 
occasions when (notwithstanding the separation of areas of confidentiality and the implementation of information 
barriers), as a result of a conflict of interest, the Manager has to withdraw from acting on a particular transaction on 
behalf of the Fund. In providing services to its clients, Deutsche Bank may recommend activities that would compete 
with, or otherwise adversely affect, the Fund. In connection with the foregoing activities, Deutsche Bank may from time 
to time come into possession of information that limits its ability to make an investment, and the Fund's investment ability 
may be constrained as a consequence of the Manager's inability to use such information for advisory or management 
purposes. Deutsche Bank may also receive information that could preclude the Manager from taking actions that would 
be in the best interests of the Fund. 
Deutsche Bank as sponsor of other private equity funds or accounts 
Deutsche Bank has in the past sponsored, and in the future may sponsor, other funds, pooled investment vehicles, 
separate accounts or similar investment platforms that may acquire interests in, provide financing to or otherwise deal 
with private equity assets that may be suitable investments for the Fund. Deutsche Bank may also underwrite or place 
private equity assets that may be suitable investments for the Fund. Such actions may compete, perhaps significantly, 
with those of the Fund. 
Moreover, in certain circumstances, Deutsche Bank may be selling an investment in 
circumstances in which the Fund is acquiring, or retaining, an investment. Such activities by Deutsche Bank may 
materially and adversely affect the value of the Fund's investments. 
The Fund may invest in funds that are managed by affiliates of Deutsche Bank. Such funds may impose management 
and/or administration costs, expenses and performance allocations on their investors, and the Fund would be subject to 
its share of such costs, expenses and allocations. 
Information barriers 
The Manager and other business lines within Deutsche Bank have established, and intend to rely upon, information 
barriers. Reliance on information barriers is intended to reduce the opportunity for misuse of information to the detriment 
of the Fund or other business lines within Deutsche Bank: however, such barriers are not intended to prevent competition 
between the Fund and such business lines, which may operate to the detriment of the Fund. See Appendix 2: Privacy 
Notice for a description of the circumstances in which information about an Investor may be shared between the 
Manager, the General Partner and other entities in the Deutsche Bank Group. 
Allocation of investment opportunities and co-investments with Deutsche Bank affiliates 
Subject to the Fund Partnership Agreement, the Manager and DB PE intend to (and other divisions of the Deutsche Bank 
Group may) sponsor, manage or advise other private equity portfolios and (in the case of the Manager and DB PE) other 
investment platforms during the lifetime of the Fund with objectives and an investment focus that may have similarities to 
those of the Fund and overlapping investment committee members. As a result there may be potential for conflicts of 
interest in allocating potential investments which could result in suitable investments being allocated away from the Fund. 
The Manager will not be able to control the activities of its affiliates, which may compete directly with the Fund for 
potential investment opportunities, and which could affect the Fund's investments and investment activity. No assurance 
can be given that potentially suitable investments of which the Manager, DB PE, and other divisions of the Deutsche
