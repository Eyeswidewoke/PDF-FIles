Fig. 14. Several simple examples of functions F(2) and 11(2) are shown. For single mating the corresponding dynamics of policing Intensity with gradual evolution are also 
shown. We use the forms Pat= 1 - P +P7 and 2(21= I +Ca+ (1/2)C222. For eadi of the four panels. we set: (a) F" = 0.5. C. =0.2. Co =O. corresponding to Zs = I: (b)

branching may occur; Gen tz et al.. 1998) To determine if (17) is an 
ESS. we must look at second-order terms in (12) and (14). 
For a dominant police allele, we return to (12) with the sub-
stitutions (11). We focus on a singular strategy given by (17). For a 
singular strategy, Cam, is zero to first order in w. To second order in 
w. we get

+ 8nPR'2 + 2012 + n2P+ 4001 +OW) 
16n2R2 
We may alternatively write (18) by substituting for ir using (17): 
[ 
Can,_ w2 (2 + n + nP)2I(n2 — 4),R + 20r2 + n2P+4fle]

For a recessive police allele, we return to (14) with the sub-
stitutions (11). We focus on a singular strategy given by (17). For a 
singular strategy. Cm is zero to first order in w. To second order in 
w, we get

Inspection of (18) and (20) allows us to determine if a singular 
strategy is an ESS. If the bracketed quantity multiplying 14,2 is 
negative, then mutations that change policing in either direction 
are disfavored. If the bracketed quantity multiplying w2 is positive, 
then mutations that change policing in either direction are 
favored. Thus, for a dominant allele that affects intensity of 
(18) 
policing, the singular strategy (17) represents a local ESS if 
(n2 - 4)1'R2+2(n2+ 4n-4) YR'R+8nPRI2 +2(n2 +n2P+4)/eR <0 
(21) 
We may alternatively write (21) by substituting for /11 using (17): 
(2 +n+nP)21(n2 — 4), 12+2(r,2 +rr2P+4),I 
— (n2 —4)(n2+ n2P+4n —4)122R < 0 
(22) 
Similarly, for a recessive allele that affects intensity of policing, the 
singular strategy (17) represents a local ESS if 
(n-2X2+n+nPfR—(n— 2)2112R +2(2 +n+nP)211 <0 
(23) 
Here. R P, P, R. fe. and le are all functions of the intensity of 
policing, Z. The local ESS conditions (22) and (23) are quite opaque 
and do not allow for simple analysis. Notice that, although the 
locations of evolutionarily singular strategies are the same for 
dominant and recessive mutations that influence policing, the 
conditions for a singular strategy to be a local ESS are different. 
9. Policing and inclusive fitness theory 
It has been claimed that policing is a test case of inclusive fit-
ness theory (Abbot et .11.. 2011). But the first two papers to theo-
retically establish the phenomenon (Woyciechowski and Lomnicki. 
1987: Ratnicks. 1988) use standard population genetics; they do 
not mention the term "inclusive fitness", and they do not calculate 
inclusive fitness. Therefore, the claims that theoretical investiga-
tions of worker policing emerge from inclusive fitness theory or 
that empirical studies of policing test predictions of inclusive fit-
ness theory are incorrect. 
In light of known and mathematically proven limitations of 
inclusive fitness theory (Nowak et al.. 2010; Allen et al.. 2013), it is 
unlikely that inclusive fitness theory can be used to study general
