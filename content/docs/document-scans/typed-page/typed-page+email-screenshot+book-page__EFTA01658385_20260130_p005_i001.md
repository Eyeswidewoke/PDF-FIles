Media Analyses: Protests "Peaceful" In Kenosha After Arrest Of 17-Year-Old In 
Shootings. NBC Nightly NewsVi (8/27, story 4, 1:55, Gabe Gutierrez, 5.69M) reported, "After 
days of unrest, now National Guard troops from Arizona, Michigan and Alabama are heading to 
Kenosha, Wisconsin, even though" Wednesday night's "protests here were peaceful." The CBS 
Evening NewsVi (8/27, story 3, 2:05, Mola Lenghi, 4.26M) similarly said that "here in Kenosha, 
you can hear a peaceful rally going on behind me, but the three nights of unrest here left many 
small businesses damaged or destroyed." CBS added that the mayor of Kenosha said "he's 
turning to state and federal officials to help get those business owners some financial relief." 
The AP (8/27, Groves, Bauer) reports that "protests in Kenosha...were mostly peaceful" 
on Wednesday and Thursday and "there were no groups patrolling with long guns as there were 
during previous nights of protests" and "protesters also stayed away from a courthouse that 
had been the site of standoffs with law enforcement." Kyle Rittenhouse, 17, of Antioch, Illinois, 
"was taken into custody on Wednesday." 
Reuters (8/27, McDermid, Maturen) says "relative calm returned to Kenosha...after 
multiple nights of looting and two deaths," and USA Today (8/27, Miller, Torres, Yancey-Bragg, 
10.31M), among other news outlets, runs a similar analysis. 
Elderly Man Brutally Assaulted By Looters Monday Night. The Kenosha (WI) News 
(8/27, Tatge-Rozell, 63K) reported, "In a brutal assault, a 71-year-old Kenosha man who was 
trying to fend off looters in Uptown Monday night with a fire extinguisher was hit in the head 
with a plastic bottle filled with concrete, breaking his jaw in two places." The News adds that "in 
addition to breaking his jaw, the blow caused lacerations to" Robert Cobb's "head and split his 
nose."

Rioting Breaks Out In Minneapolis After False Rumor About Police Shooting. 
The Minneapolis Star Tribune (8/27, Hyatt, Simon, Walsh, 1.04M) reports "residents and 
workers in downtown Minneapolis grappled with shattered peace, broken glass, looted shops 
and personal trepidation Thursday morning after a suicide of a homicide suspect on Nicollet Mall 
ignited waves of rioting." The Star Tribune adds "the destruction recalled the damage done in 
the wake of George Floyd's death," and that "fire officials are investigating the apparent 
torching of four retail outlets overnight that expanded the destruction well beyond the city's 
core." Moreover, "fire crews rescued two residents from above the China Wok restaurant, one 
off the roof and the other from a second-floor window using ladders." The Star Tribune also 
reports that "by the time calm was restored, dozens had been arrested." The Minneapolis Star 
Tribune (8/27, Sinner, 1.04M) also runs a "map of Minneapolis businesses damaged" or "looted 
after night of unrest," and explains the rioting took place "in response to a false rumor that a 
man who killed himself had been shot by police." 
Fox News (8/27, Casiano, 27.59M) reports on its website, "Videos posted to social media 
appeared to show people smashing windows and breaking into businesses to steal 
merchandise," and the Washington Free Beacon (8/27, Nester, 78K) that "another wave of 
rioting and looting" erupted "as misinformation spread that police had killed" a Black man.

will not be tolerated. The State Patrol is headed to Minneapolis to help restore order. I remain in 
close contact with the city and every state resource stands ready to help bring peace."
