President Trump announced Thursday that he has decided to cancel the Republican National 
Convention in Jacksonville due to the recent spike in COVID-19 infections in Florida. Media 
coverage remained unfavorable toward Trump, with reports casting his decision as both a 
surprising reversal and an acknowledgment that his original plans were never tenable. NBC 
Nightly NewsVi (7/23, story 2, 1:05, Holt, 5.52M) referred to "a rare retreat from...Trump" and 
the CNBC (7/23, Dzhanova, 3.62M) website as a "staggering turnaround," while Jonathan Karl 
of ABC World News TonightVi (7/23, story 2, 0:40, Muir, 6.89M) described him as "recognizing 
a reality he had tried to avoid," and showed him saying, "So, I told my team, it's time to cancel 
the Jacksonville, Florida component of the GOP convention. And I'll still do a convention speech 
in a different form, but we won't do a big crowded convention, per se. Just not the right time 
for that." 
Weijia Jiang of the CBS Evening NewsVi (7/23, story 3, 1:00, O'Donnell, 3.92M) 
recounted that "as cases continue to surge, so did a list of Republican leaders who said they 
would not attend the event due to safety concerns," and "earlier this week, the city sheriff 
doubted he could provide enough security for the convention." CNN (7/23, Liptak, Bradner, 
83.16M), in an online report, says it was "a striking turnaround for Trump," who "has now 
upended convention plans in two key swing states he must win to have a shot at reelection." 
Trump said on Fox News' Hannity (7/23, 535K) last night, "We are setting an example and 
we don't want people so close together. We have such enthusiasm, and you know we went to 
North Carolina we wanted to do it there. It was all set. We would build a beautiful facility. They 
got hit hard, and then the governor really, he could have treated us better. The Democrat 
governor, but we are actually opening up there. Then we will make our way. It won't be your 
typical convention, I will tell you that." 
To the Palm Beach Post (7/23, Fins, 223K), "the decision to back away from even a more 
limited gathering in Florida is a mixture of reality and defeat for Trump," which came "as doubts 
about the safety of holding the event in Jacksonville continued to grow." Along those lines, 
Reuters (7/23, Holland, Holland, Lewis) points out that according to its tally, "Florida is now 
among the states with the highest number of new coronavirus cases and has seen more nearly 
390,000 cases of the virus and more than 5,600 deaths." 
Politico (7/23, Oprysko, 4.29M) reports that "still, Republicans insisted the event would be 
safe, and as recently as Tuesday the Trump campaign's communications director was 
expressing confidence that the convention 'will be a great...series of events over the course of 
four days and it will be safe." The New York Times (7/23, Haberman, Mazzei, Karni, 18.61M) 
indicates, meanwhile, that "the convention efforts in both Jacksonville and Charlotte, NC, which 
have preoccupied some GOP officials and donors for months, now stand as an object lesson in 
chaotic planning for a party that prizes its ability to raise money and execute splashy displays." 
The Fox News (7/23, O'Reilly, 27.59M) website reports, on the other hand, that 
Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel on Thursday tweeted that "she supported 
the president's announcement, calling it a 'difficult decision," while "Bill Stepien, Trump's re-
election campaign manager, said in a statement: 'Leading by example, President Trump has put 
the health and safety of the American people first with his decision on the Jacksonville 
convention." Meanwhile, "the Republican Party of Florida tweeted that Trump 'made a selfless 
decision by cancelling the FL component of @GOP Convention." Reporting on Trump's "major 
turnabout," meanwhile, the Washington Times (7/23, Howell, 492K) also notes Stepien's 
statement. 
Florida Politics (7/23, Gankarski) similarly reports Trump "said he 'had to protect the 
American people; which led him to cancel the event," and quotes him as saying, "It's hard for 
us to say we want to have a lot of people packed in a room and tell people not to do it," and 
"there's nothing more important in our country than keeping our people safe, whether it's the 
China virus or the radical left mob." The Florida Times-Union (7/23, Pantazi, 203K) points out 
the President "praised Mayor Lenny Curry, who had been boosting the event even as a majority 
of Jacksonville residents polled said they didn't want the event here," and "said he would still
