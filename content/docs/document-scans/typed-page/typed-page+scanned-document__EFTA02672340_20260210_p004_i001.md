feelings of guilt). 
Stroop Task 
To test the possible effect of cathodal tDCS on executive prefrontal 
functkm (i.e.. the ability to inhibit a prepotern response), participants 
performed the Snoop task during sham and cathodal tDCS of the aPFC. 
respectively. The task was conducted with a color-coxed 4-button 
keyboard. Participants were presented with color wonts printed in 
colored Ink and asked to name the color of the ink as quickly as possible. 
Color words printed in an incongruent color (i.e., "red- printed in Noe 
Ink) produces slower RT known as Swoop interference (Swoop 1935). 
Ibe task consisted of 66 practice trials to minimize the emw rate. 
followed by 66 experimental trials (33 congruent and 33 fiwontntwm in 
randomized order). The stimulus words were: "red; "green; *bluer and 
-yellow: Color names appeared on the screen in I of the 4 colons 
Preceding each trial, a fixation cross was shown Inc 2s. The trial interval 
was constant with a duration of 2 s. After the participants resistive, the 
screen became black fox• the n-st of tlw trial interval. 
Results 
Experiment 1 
Interestingly, if only the number of lies was compared between 
cathodal and sham tlX:S. no significant difference was found 
between the 2 conditions (1 = 1.768, P = 0.092). However, 
concerning the I.Q. subjects achieved in the stimulation 
condition a significantly higher LQ than in the sham condition 
(f = 2.254, P = 0.035), meaning that the answers given in the 
interrogation during cathodal tIXS were less likely to reveal 
their guilt, than the answers given during slum stimulation

Posthoc ttest revealed that in the sham 
condition, the SCR for lying was significantly higher than for 
saying the truth (I . 3.029. P

stimulation condition, this difference in SCR between lies and 
truthful responses disappeared (I= 0.626, P= 0.539; Fig. 2b). 
To further investigate the effect of cathodal tDCS of the 
aPFC, on the subjective experience of guilt, subjects were 
asked at the end of the interrogation to rate their feelings of 
guilt, which they might have experienced during the in-
terrogation, on a scale from 0 (no feelings of guilt) to 5 
(maximum feelings of guilt). Wilcoxon signed-rank test 
revealed that cathodal tIX'S of the aPR: led to significantly 
lower feelings of guilt than in the sham condition (r. -1.986,

analyses revealed a significantly negative correlation between 
the change of feelings of guilt (cathodal condition minus sham 
condition) and the change of the LQ (t = -0.386, P= 0.023), 
indicating that the less feelings of guilt subjects perceived, the 
better could they deceive during the interrogation. 
Experiment 2 
In order to exclude the possibility that the observed effects 
were only due to nonspecific effects of the electrical 
stimulation and not specific to the inhibition of the aPR: by 
"cathodal" DC stimulation, we conducted a second experiment 
in which the experimental design was identical to the first 
experiment but the stimulation polarity was reversed. In 
contrast to the first experiment, anodal ti)CS of the aPFC did 
not lead to a significant change of the LQ
