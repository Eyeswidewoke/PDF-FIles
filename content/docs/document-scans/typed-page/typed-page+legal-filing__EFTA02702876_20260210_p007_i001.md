we can have: (blue) policing invades but is unstable. a= 0.0005. D=-0.0004: 
(green) policing invades and is stable. 0=0.000l. /3=0: (red) policing does not

the r, curve which results in policing being dominated by non-policing 
(red, second from bottom). This phenomenon arises in a similar way: if 
r, .2 is too small relative tor,, then the non-police allele cannot invade 
a resident policing population, and there is bistability. 
4. Double mating 
For double mating. n=2. the Invasion condition fora dominant 
police allele is given by 
r1,2 > 1 
(5) 
Thus, policing can invade if there is an infinitesimal increase in 
colony efficiency when half of all workers police. Policing cannot 
invade if there is an infinitesimal decrease in colony efficiency 
when half of all workers police. 
The stability condition for policing is given by 
r, > r314 
(61 
Therefore, the policing allele is stable if the colony efficiency is 
greater for z=1 (when all workers police) than for z = 3/4 (when 
only three quarters of the workers police). 
Four possible efficiency curves r, and the corresponding 
behavior of the police allele are shown in Fig. 9. 
5. Triple mating 
For triple mating. n=3. the invasion condition for a dominant 
police allele is given by

As a numerical example, let us consider p1„.3 = 0.98 and 
pia =0.99.11x=1/3 of workers police. then 98% of males come 
from the queen. If z = 1/2 of workers police, then 99% of males 
come from the queen. In this case, policing cannot invade if ri,3 
=0.9990 and ria =0.9979. In principle, arbitrarily small reduc-
tions in colony efficiency can prevent evolution of policing for 
triple mating.

Fts.10. Possible r, efficiency curves forn-3 matings which demonstrate different 
behaviors. For this plot we set p,r, =0.986. pe, = 0.99. Ps,. = 0996. and pi = 1. 
Here, each curie has the functional form r, = I -,a-par. For example. we can have: 
(blue) policing invades but is unstable. a= - 0.0006..d -0.0006: (green) policing 
invades and is stable, a--0.0012. D-0: (red) policing does not invade and is 
unstable. a= -00015. 0=0: (black) policing does not invade but is stable. 
• 0.0021. A-now& Note that the value r2,1 affects the population dynamics but 
does not appear in the conditions for invasion and stability of the police allele. hence 
the parentheses on the horizontal axis. (For interpretation of the references to color 
in this figure caption. the reader is referred to the web version of this paper.) 
Just as for single mating, we observe the intriguing feature that 
increases in colony efficiency due to policing do not necessarily result 
in a higher frequency of police workers at equilibrium. Fig. 10 illus-
trates this phenomenon. Four possibilities for the efficiency function 
I-, are shown. Notice that the r, curve which results in coexistence of 
police workers and non-police workers (blue, top) is strictly greater 
than the r, curve which results in all workers policing (green, second 
from top). Also notice that the r, curve which results in bistability of 
police workers and non-police workers (black, bottom) is strictly less 
than the r; curve which results in policing being dominated by non-
policing (red, second from bottom). 
6. Recessive police allele 
We have also derived the conditions for the emergence and evo-
lutionary stability of worker policing if the police allele is fully reces-
sive. In this case, AA and Aa workers are phenotypically identical and 
do not police, while aa workers do police. (Alternatively. AA and M 
workers police with intensity ZA4=Zed. while no workers police with 
intensity Ze, =4,4+w = 4„ + w. We consider this case in Section 8.) 
6.1. Emergence of worker policing 
The invasion condition for a recessive police allele, a, is given by 
rya., >  
2(2+n +npo) 
(9) 
r0 
(2 + n)(2+po)+Tho2,0(n — 2) 
Note that Eq. (9) for invasion of a recessive police allele has the same 
mathematical form as Eq. (2) for evolutionary stability of a dominant 
police allele. Starting from Eq.:2'n making the substitution z—. 1—z, 
and reversing the inequality, we recover Eq. (9). The intuition behind 
this correspondence is described in Appendix A.
