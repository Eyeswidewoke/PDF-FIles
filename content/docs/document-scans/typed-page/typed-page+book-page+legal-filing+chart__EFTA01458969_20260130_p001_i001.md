World Outlook 2016: Managing with less liquidity 
Little hope for en export recovery 
We do not carry high hopes for exports to recover due to Japan-specific 
factors (continued outward foreign direct investment, low price elasticity for 
luxury goods exports, an exclusion of Japanese manufacturers from the global 
supply chain since the Greet East Japan Earthquake) as well as a global factor, 
namely the shift to a closed economy regime (disappearance of growth 
frontiers: decline in benefits of international trade). 
CPI inflation to comerps at around I 
The level of CPI excluding energy clearly turned around in HI 2013 after 15 
years of declines up to 2012, and has maintained an upward trend of around 
1% annualized since then. Deflation has clearly ended. mainly as the result of 
GE that started at a cautious pace under former-BoJ Governor Shirakawa in 
2012. There is an argument that inflation will slow from now on due to a stable 
JPY exchange rate and a weak rise in wages: however, the fact that the 
Japanese economy is moving from the flat section on the Phillips curve to the 
steeper section indicates that an economic expansion will have larger impact 
on inflation than before. This regime shift should fully offset possible drags on 
inflation from a stable JPY exchange rate and slow wage growth. 
Not predicting additional monetary easing 
Based on the facts that the BoJ at present is promising an almost open-ended 
easing with no set limit on the timeline and that the scale of the monetary base 
increase is an annual JPY80trn (16% of GDP), an overwhelming scale 
compared to other countries, we forecast monetary policy is likely to maintain 
the current easing stance (no more rounds of easing). Were the BoJ to enact 
additional monetary easing reluctantly, we believe this would only occur in the 
case of a sharp slowdown in the global economy, JPY appreciation, and a 
slump in share prices. 
Japanese economy almost reaches its new steady state 
We have reiterated several times that the new steady state of the Japanese 
economy since the introduction of QQE in April 2013 is 2% nominal GDP 
growth, 1% CPI inflation. 1% 10-year JGB yield, and 5% M2 growth. The 
Japanese economy has been in the transition process and seems to be very 
close to this new steady state.
