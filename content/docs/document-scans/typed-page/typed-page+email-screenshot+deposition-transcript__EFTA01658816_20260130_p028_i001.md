not enforce 'any health or emergency orders related to curfews, staying at home, Thanksgiving 
or other social gatherings inside or outside the home, maximum occupancy, or mask 
mandates." 
The Hill (11/19, Choi, 2.98M) reports California "reported nearly 200,000 on Nov. 12, the 
most it has recorded in a single day since the pandemic was declared in March." The Wall Street 
Journal (11/19, Subscription Publication, 7.57M), the San Jose Mercury News (11/19, 456K), 
and Axios (11/19, Chen, Perano, 521K) also have reports. 
Ohio Legislature Passes Bill To Limit DeWine's Emergency Powers. 
The Cleveland Plain Dealer (11/19, 895K) reports that Ohio legislators passed Thursday a bill to 
strip Gov. Mike DeWine (R) "of the authority to issue statewide coronavirus orders, even though 
the governor said the measure would be 'a disaster' and vowed to veto it." The measure would 
"ban the Ohio Department of Health from issuing mandatory quarantine orders enforced against 
people who are not diagnosed as sick or directly exposed to disease." However, the bill "would 
not void existing statewide orders, including the three-week 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew 
announced by the governor earlier this week, a renewed statewide mask mandate, and a 'stay-
at-home' order like the one DeWine ordered the state health director to issue last spring." 
New York City Parents Protest School Closures. 
The CBS Evening NewsVI (11/19, story 5, 2:10, O'Donnell, 4.28M) reported, "Thousands of 
parents of New York City schoolchildren sent a petition to the city's mayor and the state's 
governor demanding that the nation's largest school system reopen immediately for in-person 
learning." CBS' Meg Oliver said that the abrupt shutdown "sent parents of some 300,000 
students scrambling Wednesday night." Oliver interviewed New York City emergency medicine 
physician Uche Blackstock, who argued against the shutdown, saying, "I do think right now it is 
safe. They are going back in smaller cohorts. They are wearing masks as are the teachers." The 
New York Times (11/19, McKinley, Ferre-Sadurni, 18.61M) reports that the school closures 
come as thousands of new cases "are emerging every day statewide," and hospitalizations 
"have more than quintupled since early September, topping 2,200 on Wednesday." 
The New York Times (11/19, Shapiro, Kim, 18.61M) reports New York City Mayor Bill de 
Blasio (D) "defended his decision" to shut down the school district on Thursday, "saying it was 
justified by the steady increase in test positivity, which again topped 3 percent on Thursday." 
He said, "We see a gathering storm, and we're fighting back the second wave." He "vowed to 
reopen the city's schools, but warned that it would require 'even more stringent rules," which 
could "include expanding coronavirus testing in school buildings and possibly mandating that all 
students who want to take in-person classes provide written consent to receive a coronavirus 
test." 
Smithsonian Shuts Down All Facilities Indefinitely. 
The AP (11/19, Khalil) reports, "In response to rising COVID-19 infection numbers, the 
Smithsonian Institution is indefinitely shutting down operations at all its facilities, effective 
Monday and affecting seven museums, plus the National Zoo." The Washington Post (11/19, 
Hedgpeth, 14.2M) reports Smithsonian Secretary Lonnie G. Bunch III "said the decision to close 
the museums and National Zoo was a precaution, adding that caseloads are projected to rise 
after Thanksgiving, typically a busy time for the museums." The New York Times (11/19, Bahr, 
18.61M) reports that the Smithsonian's "New York City museums, the Cooper Hewitt, 
Smithsonian Design Museum and the National Museum of the American Indian George Gustav 
Heye Center, have been closed to the public since March 14."
