World Outlook 2016: Managing with less liquidity 
Inflation is expected to rebound sharply in 2016 and rise modestly further in 
2017. The initial acceleration is driven primarily by the stabilization of energy 
price, removing what has been a considerable downward force on broad price 
indexes. Hence, the gap between headline and core inflation will close in the 
coming year. In addition, core inflation rates in the G3 economies have already 
begun to rise gently, and our expectation is that even after the commodity 
price effect lifts headline inflation, the underlying rising trend in core inflation 
will continue to push inflation higher. Advanced economy inflation is projected 
to rise by 1 percentage point next year and 0.6 percentage points in 2017. On 
the other hand, inflation in emerging market economies - less influenced in 
most cases by energy prices -- is expected to rise modestly next year and 
remain stable in 2017. Upside risks to inflation from food prices are a concern--
this year has seen the most pronounced El Nino cycle on record and weather 
patterns may be equally disruptive next year. As yet, however, food prices 
globally are not showing any upward momentum.

Our inflation forecasts have undergone significant revisions since the June 
update. Global inflation expectations have been revised up by 0.1 and 0,2 
percentage points for 2015 and 2016. The impetus for this revision is higher 
inflation in emerging market economies resulting from greater-than-expected 
currency depreciation. This is most pronounced in Latin America, where 
forecast inflation has been revised up by 2.2 and 6.2 percentage points for 
2015 and 2016, respectively. Inflation has been marked down broadly across 
advanced economies and emerging Asia, with forecasts falling by a few tenths 
for 2015 and by about one-half of a percentage point for next year.
