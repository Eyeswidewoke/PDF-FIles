what is already a serious economic crisis within the European Union," the Post says, "but if the 
blackmail by Hungary and Poland succeeds, Europe's commitment to democracy will be fatally 
compromised." 
Corruption Trial For Former French President Sarkozy Opens. 
The Wall Street Journal (11/23, Bisserbe, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) reports the trial into 
whether former French President Nicolas Sarkozy attempted to bribe a magistrate for 
confidential information regarding a police probe into his 2007 campaign's finances began on 
Monday. The trial was suspended immediately, however, when the court ordered Gilbert Azibert, 
the magistrate, to undergo a medical evaluation because he was not present in the courtroom. 
The New York Times (11/23, Breeden, 18.61M) reports Sarkozy "appeared in a Paris 
courtroom on Monday to face charges of corruption and influence-peddling, as years of drawn-
out legal entanglements came to a head despite his enduring influence and popularity on the 
right." Nicolas Roussellier, "a political historian at Sciences Po in Paris who has studied the 
evolution of France's executive branch, noted that it had been historically rare for heads of state 
to stand trial or even face charges in France because of an `old tradition' that sees the 
executive branch as a `sacred' office, separate from the turmoil of the political arena and 
shielded from a judge's reach." However, "the French have become increasingly impatient with 
the financial improprieties of their political elites, and journalists and prosecutors have become 
increasingly assertive in poking their noses where, several decades ago, none would have dared 
- including the presidency." 
Pope Hosts NBA Players To Discuss Social Justice Activism. 
The Washington Post (11/23, Harlan, 14.2M) reports that, "in a meeting initiated by the 
Vatican, Pope Francis on Monday hosted a group of NBA players to hear about their social 
justice activism at a time of deep polarization in the United States." The meeting included "five 
players who have been vocal on such matters as White privilege and police violence" - Kyle 
Korver, Sterling Brown, Marco Belinelli, Anthony Tolliver, and Jonathan Isaac - and, according to 
the Post, "offers a glimpse into what aspects of US society the pontiff thinks are most 
important." The meeting "also shows the reach of sports activism in the United States, where 
athletes, many of them Black, have become some of the highest-profile proponents for social 
change." 
The New York Times (11/23, Abrams, 18.61M) reports the players "took turns addressing 
the pope and offered him a book documenting many of their community and social initiatives in 
the last few months as well as jerseys and a Black Lives Matter T-shirt." Korver said the Pope 
"said sport is such an opportunity to unify, and he compared it to a team, where you have a 
common goal and you're working together, but you all use your own personalities." According to 
the Times, "For the players, the meeting provided an opportunity to expand global awareness of 
the efforts to promote social justice after the deaths of several Black Americans at the hands of 
the police, including George Floyd in Minnesota, and the police shooting of Jacob Blake in 
Wisconsin." 
Armenian Troops In Nagorno-Karabakh Feel Loss Of Azerbaijan Territory. 
The Washington Post (11/22, Cookman, Dixon, 14.2M) reports, "For Armenian soldiers on the 
losing side of the short but brutal Nagorno-Karabakh war, the loss of territory to Azerbaijan 
remains so bitter that some say they would have preferred to fight on." The "sting of the 
Moscow-brokered peace deal was acute at a military outpost in Stepanakert, the main city in 
the enclave governed by a pro-Armenian government but within the internationally recognized 
borders of Azerbaijan." This "also reflected the wider outrage at the cease-fire in Armenia and 
among ethnic Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh, raising further questions about whether the 
pact can hold despite nearly 2,000 Russian peacekeepers deployed to enforce it."
