IG Commodity Bonds: Value in the Vol? 
Whilst EUR HY has very limited exposure to commodity related issuers, the 
EUR IG credit market has a more material exposure, albeit still notably less 
than the USD credit market. Here we take a look at the impact of the selloff 
on these EUR IG commodity related names and potential opportunities. 
C; oornroodIty hen d: during the coromociily 
ofl 
Amid generally weak performance in the EUR IG credit market over the past 
few months, bonds issued by basic materials and oil and gas issuers have 
been amongst the worst performers. 
The sell-off has been driven by the resumption of steep declines in commodity 
values. The tight relationship between the sell-off in commodity markets and of 
commodity companies' bonds can be seen in Figure 21 and Figure 22.

Single-A and especially BBB commodity bonds trading as If already 
downgraded 
For this analysis we focus on non-financial, non-subordinated bonds only. 
What is clear is that IG basic resource and oil and gas bonds are trading much 
wider than the rest of the market now, especially in single-As and BBBs (Figure 
231. Single-A commodity bonds are quite wide vs. other single-As whilst oil 
and gas and especially basic resource BBB bonds are trading very wide vs. the 
rest of the BBB market.

The market is clearly trading with a palpable fear of downgrades, especially in 
BBBs where the potential downgrade to HY is particularly stark. You can see
