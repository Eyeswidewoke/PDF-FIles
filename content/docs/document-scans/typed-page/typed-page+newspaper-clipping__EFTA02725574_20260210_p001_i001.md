Brockman (1969), taking information 
theory - the mathematical theory 
of communications - as a model for 
regarding all human experience. 
A main theme has continued to 
inform my work over the years: new 
technologies r new perceptions-
An incident from those years stands 
out. During an evening at dinner. Cage 
reached across the table and handed 
me a copy of Cybernetics by Norbert 
Wiener. Fast forwani two years. 
Around 1967,1 spent two days with 
Stewart Brand while he was assembling 
the first edition of the Whole Earth 
Catalog and we sat and read the book 
together, underlining as we went Montt 
Central to our interest was the notion of 
"feedback", the non-linear relationship 
of input to output. It was apparent that 
the ideas in cybernetic theory were far 
more important than the applications 
for which the mathematical 
descriptions were designed. 
Stewart and I have been in touch 
regularly since then - a 45-year 
connection. 
.IN Was it difficult to come up with Edge's 
2010 quorion, about the interne? 
18 Every August. I begin a conversation 
with three of the original members 
of Edge - Stewart, Kevin Kelly and 
George Dyson. Eventually. I came 
up with the idea of asking how the 
Internet is affecting the scientific 
work. lives, minds and reality of the 
contributors. A big consideration 
of this question is the difference 
between "we" and "you". When 
people respond to "we" questions, 
their words tend to resemble expert 
papers public pronouncements or 
talks delivered from a stage. "You" 
leads us to share specifics of our lived 
experience. The challenge then is not 
to let responses slip into life's more 
banal details. 
IN I was struck by something that one 
respondent. Esgeny Morozov, said 
about his fear of a chasm opening 
"between the disengaged masses and 
the overengaged elites". The elites, 
he goes on, "continue thriving in the 
new environment, exploiting superb 
online tools for scientific research 
and collaboration" etc. Actually, it's 
clear that many - most? - of your 
respondents are, par excellence. 
members of those elites. That's not 
a criticism, but it might mean that 
a casual reader could come away 
from the book thinking that public 
engagement with the intemet and its 
significance is rather more elevated 
and intelligent than is actually the case. 
18 The problem with a discussion 
that uses the word "elites" is that the 
word is automatically perceived as a 
pejorative. But that's not how I feel 
about it at all. Elites area problem if 
they're closed and exclusive. Elites 
that are open, inclusive and based on 
merit can be nurturing. Also, members 
*Achim give one another permission to 
be great. One example is the Beat poets. 
Another example is the mix of people 
who created Silicon Valley. 
While Edge is a read-only site, the 
cast of characters contributing to the 
various projects is ever-changing and 
inclusion is by recommendation of 
members of the community. That said, 
Edge is not for everybody. It helps 
to know some stuff, But one thing 
you won't find in the responses is 
arrogance. The site stands or falls on 
the quality of the questions it asks. 
In terms of this particular question 
- "Is the Internet changing the way 
you think?" - there's the question of 
people having skin in the game. The 
contributors to Edge are what I call 
third-culture thinkers or intellectuals. 
Not only arc they focused on science-
minded pursuits based on evidence 
and empiricism, they are also public 
communicators, reaching out to 
the public by means of their books, 
lectures, etc. They live by their wits, 
and doing so in the changing times 
of the digital age is a challenge. Their 
concerns are very different than, say, 
the casual user, who has signed up 
for a social network and by default 
becomes the product whose private 
information is sold to advertisers. 
Min a way, the shadow of Marshall 
McLuhan looms over the conversation. 
INsv of his aphorisms in particular -
"The medium is the message" and "We 
shape our tools and later they shape 
us" - seem particularly apposite. The 
first captured the thought that what's 
important about a medium is not the 
content of the messages it carries but 
what the medium isdoing to those who 
use it. That seemed to me to emerge 
from lots of the responses (and not just 
Nick Carr's, either). And the meme 
about our tools shaping us surfaced 
again and again in the essays. 
18 McLuhan is certainly central to

The tternet enables far wider participation
 
In ront-line science it levels the paying 
field between researchersin major centres 
and those in relative isolation, hitherto 
handicapped by Inefficient communication. 
It has transformed the way science 
is communicated and debated. More 
fundamentally. it changes how research is 
done, what might be discovered and how 
students learn.

When I first used an Internet seach engine 
n the early 1990s. I imagined myself 
dipping into a vast. universal library. a 
museum vault filled with accumulated 
knowledge. The tact that I shared this 
museum vault with other visitors was 
something that I knew In principle, but 
could not directly perceive. 
When Igo online today. all those 
rooms and hallways are teeming. What 
strikes me is the human texture of the 
information. I've come to appreciate the 
way the event and thecrewed in fact live 
In symbiosis, each dependent on the 
other — the people all talking at once 
about the event, but the event only fully

human reaction to it. The cacophony 
might make sense, and it might not.
