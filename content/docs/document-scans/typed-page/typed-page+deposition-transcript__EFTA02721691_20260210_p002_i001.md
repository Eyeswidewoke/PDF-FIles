execute as we had too much of a deal flow to handle alone. One of the guys stayed in our 
offices for 2 months learning everything we did. As months went by, these 2 guys 
(http://www.oneequity.com/Team/location/Sao-Paulo) started taking the deals and 
running - going to meetings on their own and not acting as team members, literally by-
passing on deals we sourced. At that time, I renegotiated my deal w/ OEP and included 
the clause that we would participate in everything they did. Rick Smith, whom I dealt with 
clearly stated we would be in every deal, sourcing it or not, and the contract reflects that. 
Over time, to make sure the guys in NY knew what we were up to, I flew up there every 
quarter and presented what we sourced and what deals we were working on, boards and 
added value, including for their portfolio's that were not based in Brazil but wanted to do 
business here. But the reality is that the OEP guys in Brazil were jealous and wanted to 
show they could live w/o us, or, needed to justify their presence. Some things made this 
worse, for example, when jamie dimon came to brazil, for the small exclusive reception, 
the JPM CEO invited only me and not them ( because they were junior, and because I 
helped the bank bring in a dozen of new private banking clients every year as he said), or, 
the portfolio companies and partners of One Equity elsewhere, when coming to Brazil, 
asked me for help, and not them, as the two could not get them into the owners of the 
companies/clients or decision makers that would generate real business. So thats how 
things got worse. 
3. The fee for the deal in question is Unicoba, an industrial battery-component and led 
company. I did not like the deal, but worked on it and it closed in late september of 2013. 
Pacific did not co-invest, it was our option not to and we elected that our fee be paid in 
cash. Key reason was that they sell to government and I have in my contract that I do not 
deal w/ government. When we sent the invoice, they asked us for additional info (what 
exactly we did for the deal) which they had never asked for previously. On top, they said 
this was due to new JPM requirements. Then, after we sent the info, Rick Smith, senior 
guy, said he would speak w/ me personally in his next trip to Brazil, which happened in 
early December. In August of last year Rick said OEP would cut all of their outside advisors 
and consultants, except for Pacific. In December he said they would no longer renew our 
agreement at current terms and that he was told by the Brazil OEP guys that the fee for 
the Unicoba deal was not merited because we did not do the work as expected. They 
never, ever, sent any email or complained about our work or quality during the process. 
On the contrary, we have a ton of praising emails over time and thank you emails to the 
team on this deal. But the Brazil guys, in December, cut us off from the MMM (weekly 
partners' meeting), took our names out of the investment memo sent to the Investment 
Committee, and started selectively cutting us off everything we were working on. In 
December they gave us a new version of the agreement that they wanted to sign w/ us 
which basically pays a zero fixed fee and only a variable 2% fee. I did not want to renew 
anyway, but did not say anything as we wanted to get paid on the deals that were still 
active in our pipeline, under the terms of the expiring agreement which had a tail. So I said 
"lets solve the open issues and then we work on discussing the new agreement" (which 
BTW, cancels off all the rights we have on the expiring contract).
