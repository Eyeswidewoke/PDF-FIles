Until such point as oil prices start to rebound, pension 
funds have little incentive to change their hedging 
ratios. When they eventually do shift their policy, the 
positive impact on the CAD should be considerable. 
Val 
As the Canadian dollar is driven lower by falling oil 
prices, its external and internal position deteriorated. 
Demand for external goods remains sticky while oil 
exports collapse driving fair value lower. Over time, a 
weak CAD should help Canada export more non-energy 
products to the US helping the FEER to improve with a 
lag. USD/CAD has rarely exceeded its FEER fair value 
for long suggesting that ex ante a greater collapse in oil 
prices, it is already at stretched levels. 
Buy CADNOK 
One way to express a moderately constructive view on 
CAD is via CADNOK. The cross has historically tracked 
the broad USD index closely, which suggests it is 
cheap (Figure 4). Given the more diversified nature of 
the Canadian economy, and its close ties to the US 
cycle, there is much more potential for policy to remain 
on hold in Canada than in Norway, where the Norges is 
likely to cut at least once in the first half of this year. 
Finally, the lower oil breakeven rate in Norway (at 38 
versus 49 for Canada tar sands) should mean that 
further falls in oil or stable prices hurt the NOK more on 
a marginal basis. 
Sell USDCAD 1.50 strike 
There is only a 5% probability of USD/CAD exceeding 
1.50 based on the past history of monetary divergence 
between the US and Canada (Figure 6). Using the past 
history of the two year sovereign rate divergence and a 
valuation model we can calculate this probability. The 
parameters as always will prove unstable in line with 
the Lucas critique of Keynesian econometric models. 
This is in addition to model error with CAD somewhat 
of a dicey currency to work with. Option prices attach 
by definition a higher risk neutral probability to 
crossing the rubicon of 1.50.

The risk is that getting the 1.50 level wrong could prove 
exceedingly expensive. Tail events are brutal and

history shows 1.60 as the top level.
