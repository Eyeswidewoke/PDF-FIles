and overseas voters, could change election outcomes. Mr. Krebs's organization said relatively 
few are cast, so they are not likely to be able to swing an election. And if there were a spike in 
their use, it 'would be detected as anomalous." 
More broadly, NPR (10/21, Ewing, 3.12M) reports that since 2016, Ratcliffe and Wray 
"said American officials have worked to toughen U.S. election infrastructure and become more 
vigilant about election security — work they said has paid off with the awareness demonstrated 
Wednesday night." The FBI and CISA "have kept up a drumbeat of regular bulletins about what 
they call the latest intelligence about prospective election cyber-threats." CNN (10/21, Herb, 
Cohen, 83.16M) reports that Ratcliffe said, "We are prepared for the possibility of actions by 
those hostile to democracy." Business Insider (10/21, Sheth, 3.67M) reports Russia, Iran, and 
China "have been at the top of national security officials' radars as foreign adversaries looking 
to meddle in the US election. Over the summer, the US intelligence community concluded that 
Russia does not want Biden to win the election, while China does." 
Meanwhile, NBC News (10/22, Dilanian, 6.14M) reports that Trustwave, a global 
cybersecurity firm, "says it has found a hacker selling personally identifying information from 
more than 200 million Americans, including the voter registration data of 148 million." However, 
"much of the data" is "publicly available, and almost all of it is the kind that is regularly bought 
and sold by legitimate businesses." 
Also reporting on the announcement are Bloomberg (10/21, Strohm, 4.73M), Reuters 
(10/21), ABC News (10/21, Mallin, Barr, 2.97M), Courthouse News (10/21, Solis, 2K), the Daily 
Beast (10/21, Quinn, 1.39M), the Daily Caller (10/21, Hagstrom, 716K), The Verge (10/21, 
Peters, Kelly, 2.05M), and Axios (10/21, Knutson, 521K), among others. 
Rubio, Warner Stress Elections Are Secure. CBS News (10/21, Watson, Hymes, 
Quinn, 3.68M) reports that shortly before the announcement, Acting SSCI Chair Marco Rubio 
and Vice Chair Mark Warner "emphasized that U.S. elections are secure." They said in a joint 
statement, "As we enter the last weeks before the election, we urge every American - including 
members of the media - to be cautious about believing or spreading unverified, sensational 
claims related to votes and voting. State and local election officials are in regular contact with 
federal law enforcement and cyber security professionals, and they are all working around the 
clock to ensure that Election 2020 is safe, secure, and free from outside interference." 
Democrats, Clapper Question Ratcliffe's Announcement. MSNBC (10/22, 7.86M) 
reports that House Intel Chair Adam Schiff "says voters should be cautious about information 
announced" by Ratcliffe "on election interference because of his history of providing 'campaign 
fodder for the president." Schiff told "Lawrence O'Donnell the information about Russian and 
Iranian interference must be further investigated to determine whether it's 'Ratcliffe spin or the 
assessment of the analysts." 
MSNBC (10/21, 7.86M) reports that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer "points out to 
Rachel Maddow that even though DNI John Ratcliffe said at his press conference that Iran was 
trying to damage Donald Trump, that was not conveyed in the classified briefing he received, 
which emphasized a goal of general chaos." 
CNN (10/22, 83.16M) reports that in an appearance, former DNI James Clapper 
questioned the time of Ratcliffe's news conference.

NYTimes Analysis: Meaning Of "Militia" Has Broadened. 
The New York Times (10/21, MacFarquhar, 18.61M) looks at the evolution of the term "militia," 
writing that "the term has taken on new meaning as makeshift vigilante groups have popped up 
with increasing frequency in the months leading up to a contentious election. Once limited to 
the far-right fringe, the term 'militia' now encompasses a far wider spectrum, representing 
everything from armed-to-the-teeth neighborhood watch organizations to an all-Black 
paramilitary group that marches to protest police violence."
