History of Academic Medicine 
centralized training of associates within 
the unique atmosphere of the NIH campus 
and laid the groundwork for future 
networking related to research funding. 
Although the ATP created opportunities 
for many future academic medicine 
leaders, its selective admission process 
may have had unintended consequences 
for women and minorities. As noted 
earlier, women were minimally 
represented in the ATP during the 
Doctor Draft and were not accepted into 
the PHS because those positions seemed 
to be reserved for draft-eligible men"; we 
identified only seven female associates, 
four of whom were included in our 
analysis. Also, the NIH did not collect 
information on minorities during the 
Doctor Draft. Lack of support for 
research and effective mentoring, both 
important strengths of the ATP, have 
been noted as possible limitations on 
women and minorities.202' The selective 
admission during the Doctor Draft may 
have precluded women and minorities 
from the networking opportunities for 
research funding, which may have 
contributed to their underrepresentation 
in the higher echelons of academic 
medicine. 
limitations 
Our comparison group included 
physicians who were not involved in the 
ATP but who attained academic 
positions. They represent only a small 
subset of medical school graduates during 
the study period. An AAMC analysis of 
medical school graduates from the classes 
of 1967 through 1974 found that 
approximately 15% of the graduates of 
these classes attained a medical school 
faculty appointment within nine years of 
graduation.3° It is not clear whether such 
a select group of academic physicians 
represents a fair control group for 
academic and leadership success, given 
both the ATP's stringent selection process 
and its rigorous training. Another 
possible comparison group would be 
those applicants who were not accepted 
into the ATP, but such a list of applicants 
was not available. 
Also, although we attempted to identify 
all applicants accepted into the ATP 
before the end of the Doctor Draft, the 
NIH database may not include some, 
especially those accepted during the 
program's early years. Additionally, our 
matching of the list of associates to other 
lists may have been imperfect. We were 
able to match 1,577 of the 2,791 
identified associates (56.6%) to names in 
the AAMC Faculty Roster database. We 
may have missed some; others may have 
not pursued full-time academic careers, 
may have turned to private enterprises, or 
may have stayed at the NIH. We have no 
easy means to identify the career paths of 
these other associates. 
Conclusions 
Some may have referred to NIH 
associates during and soon after the 
Doctor Draft as "Yellow Berets," a label 
that implies cowardice and avoidance of 
patriotic duties and that dismisses their 
valuable contributions. Barry Kimball," 
a 1964 NIH associate and former 
president of the American Board of 
Internal Medicine, felt that active duty 
military personnel were resentful. "We 
were doing our service obligation in a 
way which maximally enhanced our own 
careers. Why wouldn't they resent us?" 
After the war, though, many NIH 
associates used the term as a badge of 
pride with the understanding that they 
also had served their country. "I think the 
Public Health Service serves the country 
as well as any organization including the 
Department of Defense," noted Fauci." 
"If you look historically over a number of 
years, peace and war, the Public Health 
Service makes clearly as much 
contribution." In the case of the ATP, 
medial research proved to be an 
enormous part of the national effort well 
beyond the war. 
As scientific training programs grew 
across the country, supported in large 
part by the NIH extramural grant 
programs, and the Doctor Draft ended in 
1973, the size and popularity of the ATP 
dropped considerably (Figure 1). The 
ATP's end in 1992 was associated with a 
shortage of clinical investigators 
throughout the United States. As early as 
the late 1970s, NIH data had shown a 
steady decline in the number of MDs 
entering NW-supported research 
training programs. The decline was likely 
related to numerous factors. including 
medical school debt burdens, increased 
specialization, and the financial demands 
of managed care. Further, with the 
development of fields like immunology 
and molecular biology, clinical and basic 
science research diverged, leading to a 
shift in NIH funding and the bulk of 
biomedical research being done by 
specialized PhD scientists." An NM 
panel in 1995 found that funding levels 
for clinical research were low primarily 
because MDs were not applying in 
sufficient numbers for NIH awards 
compared with PhDs." The decline in 
NIH-sponsored MD grant holders was 
thought to be partly related to clinical 
investigators' loss of confidence in 
competing effectively for research 
funding." 
Perhaps one of the greatest strengths of 
the ATP was its focus on the clinical 
aspect of scientific investigation, namely, 
translational research. A "dangerous 
decline"" in the numbers of physicians 
doing clinical research could have 
devastating consequences for bringing 
"basic-science breakthroughs into clinical 
application ('bench to bedside').""." In 
response to the perceived shortage of 
physician-scientists, the NIH 
appropriated funds to support training 
programs in clinical research, including 
its Medical Scientist Training Program, 
which began in 1964 and offers MD-PhD 
training, and its Loan Repayment 
Program, which offers financial 
incentives to attract debt-burdened 
physicians into clinical research training 
and careen. In 2006, as part of the 
attempt to bridge the gap between basic 
science breakthroughs and clinical 
applications, the NIH began to 
implement a plan to create 60 Clinical 
and Translational Science Award centers 
at universities and medical centers across 
the country. The merits of these efforts 
arc currently being assessed, but the 
legacy of the NIH ATP and its associates 
set high standards that continue to guide 
the training of physician—scientists.
