the most logical choice for use in private placement 
portfolios. 
Which asset classes could be more powerful in a 
private placement portfolio? Emerging market equities 
have, by far, the most utility. The difference in the value 
of a dollar invested in that asset class in a private place-
ment (versus taxable) portfolio over 20 years is more than 
three times the difference of a dollar invested in emerging 
market bonds, for example. The difference in the value 
of a dollar invested in developed market equities in a 
private placement (versus taxable) portfolio is anywhere 
from 1.5 to 2.5 times greater than one dollar invested in 
emerging market bonds. The combination of expected 
return, turnover and tax rate makes all the difference. 
It's important to note that these arc our long-term 
asset class assumptions and are based on index 
returns. Actual returns might differ depending on the 
particular manager. Moreover, they reflect Deutsche 
Asset & Wealth Management's views. With the help of a 
good advisor, an investor can combine their own views 
and the characteristics of their selected managers, to cre-
ate a custom set of tax deferral metrics. 
Once an investor has determined what percentage 
of their overall portfolio they'd like to place in private 
placement. and his advisor has calculated the tax defer-
ral metrics for each available asset class, the investor 
and advisor still need to determine which asset classes 
should be placed in the private placement portfolio and 
which should remain in the taxable portfolio: the so-
called "asset location" strategy. 
One asset location strategy that's per-
haps the easiest to execute, is simply to 
mirror the target taxable allocation in 
the private placement portfolio, with 
minor adjustments to optimize for a 
tax-free structure. We'll call this the 
'mirror strategy? The results are a tax-
able portfolio and a private placement 
portfolio that are nearly identical from 
an asset allocation perspective. This 
method offers the advantage of limiting 
the administrative burden that arises 
when the faster tax deferred growth 
(and often higher growth asset classes) 
in the private placement portfolio cause 
the asset classes to become out of bal-
ance. Because the allocations are near-identical, an 
investor needn't worry about reallocating between 
the private placement and taxable pools but only 
within each of the pools separately. A disadvantage of 
this method is that it inhibits an investor from taking 
advantage of the superior tax deferral benefit of cer-
tain asset classes by concentrating them in the private 
placement portfolio. "Asset Allocation Advantage, " 
p. x, demonstrates the effect of this disadvantage over 
time. 
The most potent approach is to locate in private 
placement portfolios only the asset classes with the high-
est TEM. If the client views the assets in both the taxable 
and private placement pools as a single portfolio, this 
approach has a distinct disadvantage: the considerable 
administrative burden of reallocating between the pri-
vate placement and taxable pools. This process is a very 
manual one and, at times, becomes impossible to fully 
execute without changing the overall allocation. 
Another approach is to consider the private place-
ment portfolio as distinct from a broadly diversified 
asset allocation. This "tactical" portfolio would con-
sist of certain "high conviction' asset classes that are 
also best suited to the benefits of private placement. 
The goal of this pool would be absolute returns rather 
than risk-adjusted returns. In this way, TEM is an excel-
lent metric to determine which asset classes from the 
high conviction set offer the greatest benefit from tax 
deferral or tax-exemption.
