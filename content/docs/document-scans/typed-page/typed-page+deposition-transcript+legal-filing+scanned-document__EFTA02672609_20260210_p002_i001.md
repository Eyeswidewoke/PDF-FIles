How was Governor Moonbeam able to do this? It's amazing, really. We did somethi=g economists call cutting spending 
AND raising taxes. I know, it sounds like =ome crazy science fiction story, but you see, here in California, we're not=just 
gluten-free and soy-free and peanut-free, we're Tea Party free! Virgini= could do it, too, but they're too busy forcing 
ultrasounds on women who want abortions. Texas could, but they don't because they're too busy put=ing Jesus in the 
science textbooks. Meanwhile their state is so broke they want to replace paved roads with gravel. I thought we had this 
road-paving thing li=ked in the 1930s, but not in Texas. But hey, in Dallas you can carry a rifle in=o a Chuck E. Cheese, 
cause that's freedom. Which is great, but it wasn'= so great when that unregulated fertilizer plant in Waco blew up. In 
California, when things blow up, it's because we're making a Jason Statham movie. 
California isn't perfect, but it is in our nature from being on the new coast to b= up for trying new things -- and maybe 
that's why the right wingers are always =oping we fail. On the campaign trail last year, Mitt Romney warned that if we 
did='t follow his conservative path, "America is going to become like Greece, or... Spain, or Italy, or... California." And 
that was a big laugh lin= with Mormons, because Greece, Spain and Italy have some art and poetry and theatre, but 
nothing like Salt Lake City. Yes, Mitt sure hates California, which is why he moved to San Diego. To the house with the 
car elevator. 
What conservatives fear about California being a petri dish for the liberal agen=a is well-founded. For example, as 
Obamacare gets implemented here much more successfully than predicted, the movement to just go all the way to a 
singl= payer system is gathering steam. It actually passed the legislature twice, =ut was vetoed by Schwarzenegger, who 
argued it didn't go far enough to cov=r the children of that natural, beautiful love between a man and a cleaning 
lady.=/span> 
In lots of areas, California seems to have=decided not to wait around for the knuckle-draggers and the selfish libertarian 
states to get or board. They can mock "European style democracies" all they want, =e are building one here, and people 
like it -- the same way when Americans co=e back from a vacation in Europe they all say the same thing: "Wow, you =an 
see titties on the beach!" But they also remark on the clean air, the modern, first world infrastructure, the functioning 
social safety net, and bread that doesn't taste like powdered glue. And they wonder, "Why=can't we get that here?" 
Unless they're Republicans, in which case they =onder, "How can people live like that?" 
Well, swallow hard, guys, because California is eventually going to make al= Americans live like that. Why? Because 
we're huge. The 12th largest eco=omy in the world, the fifth largest agricultural exporter in the world, and of cou=se 
number one in laser vaginal rejuvenation. There's 40 million of us -- s=, for example, when California set a high mileage 
standard for any car sold in th=s state, Detroit had to make more fuel-efficient cars; we're just too big=a slice of the 
market, and it would be too expensive to make one car for us, and another for shit-kickers who want something that 
runs on coal. 
It's so ironic -- the two things conservatives love the most, the free market and states rights -- are the two things that are 
going to bend this country int= California's image as a socialist fagtopia. Maybe our constipated Congr=ss can't pass gun 
control laws, but we just did. Lots of 'em. Because =e don't give a shit about the NRA. Out here that stands for "Nuts, 
Racists, an= Assholes." So while the rest of America is debating whether it's a=good idea to allow guns in bars or a great 
idea to allow guns in bars, Californi= is about to ban lead bullets. Which is a no-brainer, because bullets don't=need lead, 
and lead kills birds and gets into the food supply of people who hunt their own food. Which explains why Ted Nugent is 
such a raving lunatic. 
While other state governments are working with Jesus to make abortion more misera=le -- because otherwise women 
would use it for weight loss -- California is ma=ing it easier. We actually have a guy dancing on the street corner dressed 
as t=e Statue of Liberty spinning a big arrow that says, "Abortions!" An= a new law will even let nurse practitioners 
perform abortions. And dog groome=s can aid assisted suicides by Skype. 
California was the first state to legalize medical marijuana, our minimum wage is almo=t three dollars higher than the 
national rate, and in 10 years a third of our electricity will come from renewable energy and 15 percent of our cars 
will=be electric.
