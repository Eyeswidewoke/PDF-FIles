A USA Today (9/2, Collins, Fritze, Jackson, 10.31M) analysis says Trump "has long 
embraced conspiracy theories as a way to attack his critics or divert attention from events that 
reflect poorly on him or his administration. But the dizzying pace in which he has given oxygen 
to outlandish tales that are typically the domain of Internet trolls or fringe groups like QAnon 
suggests the practice has now become a central part of his reelection strategy." 
WTimes Review Finds Rioters Are Often Local. The Washington Times (9/2, Dinan, 
492K) reports that while officials in the District of Columbia, Portland, and Kenosha Wisconsin 
blamed the violence in their cities on people coming in from other areas, "a Washington Times 
review of data" shows that claim is "not particularly accurate." Portland police arrests "from 
Aug. 21 to Aug. 31 showed nearly two-thirds of those charged were listed as from Portland, and 
that ratio grows even higher when close-in suburbs like Beaverton and Vancouver, Washington, 
are counted." 
Investigators Release Images Of Those Sought In Kenosha Arson Cases. 
The Kenosha News (9/2, Smith, 63K) reports investigators have released "photos and video of 
several people sought in arson fires" in Kenosha last week. A statement from the Milwaukee 
field office of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives "stated that investigators 
are 'seeking to speak to at least seven persons of interest' in the fires set to businesses and 
vehicles in the unrest that followed the shooting of Jacob Blake" on August 23. 
Kenosha County Ends Curfew. The Kenosha News (9/2, 63K) reports Kenosha County, 
Wisconsin "has ended its State of Emergency Curfew. That decision was announced today after 
local officials consulted with law enforcement and community leaders." USA Today (9/2, 
Vielmetti, 10.31M) reports four people arrested in Kenosha during demonstrations "have sued 
the city and Kenosha County, claiming discriminatory curfew enforcement that violates the First 
Amendment." 
Reuters/Ipsos Poll: Public Supports BLM Protests, Doesn't See Crime As Top Issue. 
Reuters (9/2, Kahn) reports that President Trump's "attempt to make civil unrest a central 
theme of his re-election campaign has yet to boost his political standing, as most Americans do 
not see crime as a major problem confronting the nation and a majority remain sympathetic to 
anti-racism protests, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Wednesday." The poll 
"showed the majority - 78% - remain 'very' or 'somewhat' concerned about the coronavirus," 
and "nearly 60% said Trump is at least partly responsible for the protracted school and 
business closures due to the virus. ... By contrast, most Americans do not see crime as a major 
priority and do not think it is increasing in their communities, the poll showed." Moreover, "53% 
of American adults said they remain sympathetic to people out protesting against racial 
inequality, nearly unchanged from 52% in a similar poll that ran in late July." 
Meadows: Rioters Are Committing Acts Of Terror. 
Appearing on Fox News' Fox & Friends (9/2, 831K), Chief of Staff Meadows was asked, "Do you 
agree with the President's characterization of rioters as 'domestic terrorists?" Meadows said, 
"Without a doubt. You know, what a terrorist does is try to instill fear. ...You don't have to go 
any further than perhaps even the roads outside the White House here where we have a 
number of these rioters trying to instill fear just in everyday Americans' lives. So whether you 
see it here or as the President was talking about in Kenosha, Wisconsin, this is a President that 
has been very clear. ... It's amazing when you stand up for safer communities and support law 
and order - and, more importantly, our law enforcement officers - how people of all parties 
come together." 
Barr: Idea Of "Epidemic" Of Police Violence Against Blacks Is A "False Narrative." 
Axios (9/2, Axios, 521K) reports that in an interview with CNNVi Wednesday, Attorney General 
Barr "denied...that there are 'two justice systems' for Black and white people in the U.S." Barr
