Portfolio 
Our asset-class allocation in a balanced 
portfolio 
Traditional asset classes 
Within the core part of our balanced portfolio, we 
cover traditional liquid assets such as equities, fixed 
income and commodities. The chart shows how we 
would currently design a balanced portfolio, including 
alternative asset classes.' 
Equities 
Although there was significant progress on dealing with 
Greece's problems in July, we believe that periods of uncertainty 
are likely and, as a result, further bouts of volatility. We maintain 
a preference for developed over emerging-market equities. 
We believe that in Europe, if progress continues to be made 
on Greece, markets could refocus their attention on recent 
encouraging corporate earnings news. U.S. equities have proved 
relatively resilient so far this year, but a temporary reversal 
remains possible. Chinese equities have a serious source of 
concern but may gain from stronger Chinese growth later in the 
year. 
■ Fixed income 
We still expect the U.S. Federal Reserve to start increasing rates 
later this year, most likely starting in September. Conversely the 
European Central Bank (ECB) will push ahead its quantitative-
easing program, so monetary-policy divergence will therefore 
remain a key theme. Sovereign-bond holdings will remain an 
important way of reducing risk in a portfolio and we continue to 
have an overweight to fixed income overall. Periphery Eurozone 
sovereign debt may offer some opportunities but we have grown 
more cautious on emerging-market debt, particularly given 
recent volatility. U.S. investment orade may be held back by the 
impending Fed rate hike and U.S. and European high-yield will 
remain susceptible to the newsflow. 
•Commodities 
Continued caution seems advisable. Oil prices fell back again 
recently, due in part to evidence that U.S. oil-rig count was again 
increasing. The oil market still appears to be in oversupply and. 
longer-term, the Iran deal could exacerbate this problem. There 
are also demand concerns, for example around China. Gold 
prices rose only modestly when the Greek crisis intensified and 
we still believe that gold will face considerable headwinds from 
the expected further strengthening of the U.S. dollar arid rise in 
U.S. interest rates.
