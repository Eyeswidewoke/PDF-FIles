FX Blueprint: Thin end of the wedge 
History provides us with good templates of economies 
where oil/gas findings resulted in a significant 
contribution to the BoP and persistent appreciation 
(NLG & N0K). Also, Bol governor Hug acknowledged 
as much on Nov 19th when she argued that the current 
intervention policies are only "acting to give the 
business sector time to adjust to the trends derived 
from [long term economic) forces". Buy 1LS vs USD, 
targeting 335 with a stop @ 35750 
Having reduced rates aggressively since mid 2012, the 
NBH adopted a more conservative policy approach, 
with financial stability moving back up the agenda. 
Real yields remain among the most attractive globally. 
retail sales are growing YoY, the PMI firmly is in 
expansionary territory, unemployment has fallen and 
the C/A balance is in surplus. Be long HUF vs EUR, 
targeting 290 with a stop @ 305 
While the ruble trend has been highly negative over the 
past few months, favourable seasonality going into 
Feb/Mar and bearish positioning make us cautiously 
constructive around current levels. The relatively low 
balance sheet risk. attractive carry. CBR's strong anti-
inflationary policy stance, and a robust surplus in the 
goods balance are other supportive factors. Buy RUB vs 
EUR, targeting 4310, stop @ 45.90. 
ZAR is cheap but arguably not yet sufficiently, and in 
the absence of any meaningful improvement in the 
external balances there is scope for further weakening 
in a rising interest rate environment. C/A fundability 
remains the key risk, with exports so far showing few 
signs of improvement from past currency weakness. 
Even so, there has been some response to stronger 
demand from abroad and with global growth 
continuing to improve this should be reflected in 
gradual rand stabilization. Key levels are: a) 10.85, 
where price action according to our metrics would be 
severely stretched and thus raise the probability of a 
significant snap-back, and b) 10.40, which represents 
the lower end of the more recent channel. On a break 
of either, target a 3% move in USD/Z4R to 1050 or 
10.10 respectively. 
Turkey's lira remains vulnerable to a tightening of 
global liquidity due to its sizeable C/A deficits and/or 
short-term external debt repayments in an environment 
of rising global yields. Add to that ongoing domestic 
political uncertainty and TRY should remain under 
pressure. Stay long USD/TRY, target 2.250, stopping at 
2.1350.
