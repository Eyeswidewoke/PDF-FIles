However, neither normal nor tumor tissues showed necrosis after TNF-a treatment without cryosurgery, suggesting local application 
of TNF-a by itself at this dosage would not damage tissue. 
There is the hypothesis that vascular-mediated injury is responsible for defining the edge of the cryolesion in microvascular-perfused 
tissue, and therefore the inflammation induced by local use of TNF-a augments cryoinjury. 
The effect may impact the monitoring of clinical cryosurgery. During cryosurgery of the prostate and other organs such as liver. 
kidney or brain, ultrasound. CT or MRI can be used to monitor the extent of the cryosurgical iceball. However, this is not optimal with 
cryosurgery on some special sites such as prostate, since overfreezing into sensitive adjacent structures can cause complications. 
On the other hand, if the surgeon underfreeze by keeping the iceball solely within the tumor. cancer existing at the periphery of the 
cryolesion may not be effectively treated, which may lead to recurrence of disease. Local application of TNF-a to targeted tissue in 
vivo would decrease its cryoinjury threshold. or increase its thermal threshold, to 3.5±6.97C under moderate freeze /thaw conditions. 
which are close to the temperature at the edge of the iceball. Therefore, the combination of cryosurgery and local inflammation 
induced by TNF-a may improve the clinical application of cryosurgery, specifically in the prostate but also in other organ systems. by 
increasing the ability of ultrasound and other iceball-monitoring technologies to monitor and predict injury. subsequently reducing 
potential side effects from cryotherapy(37). 
CONCLUSION 
Main causes of tumor persistence or recurrence after cryosurgery at the site of cryoablation are incomplete destruction due to 
inaccurate procedural monitoring and inadequate cntena for treatment adequacy. The optimization of cryosurgery should consider 
crucial factors such as the time of freezing, freeze-thaw cycles. number of probes, probes' sizes, the spatial position of the probes, 
and shape and size of the tumor. The selecctive occlusion of vascular inflow and addition of molecular adjuvants. such as TNF-
alpha, can dramatically increase the threshold temperature of cryo-destruction.
