they're still negotiating on broad economic relief legislation, the latest twist after five head-
spinning days during which the White House has whipsawed between demanding a stimulus bill, 
then shutting down talks - only to renew them again." 
The Intelligencer (10/8, Kilgore, 1.1M) describes Trump's comments Thursday as "one of 
the more egregious double flip-flops or his "erratic career." On its website, CNN (10/8, 
Mattingly, 83.16M) says Trump, "in a head-spinning reversal, has told allies he's interested in a 
large-scale stimulus deal, according to a person with direct knowledge of his comments. The 
person stressed it's unclear what, exactly, Trump's vision of a comprehensive deal would entail 
and there remains significant hurdles - and skepticism - when it comes to reaching an 
agreement through talks that have been largely stuck in the same place for several months." 
Trump called House Minority Leader McCarthy and "indicated he was worried by the stock 
market reaction and wanted a `big deal' with Pelosi," Axios (10/8, Treene, Swan, 521K) reports, 
citing "two sources familiar with the call." Axios adds Trump "wants a deal that would go beyond 
securing aid for the struggling airline industry and extending the small business Paycheck 
Protection Program." 
CNBC (10/8, Josephs, 3.62M) reports on its website that "at the end of her Thursday 
news conference, Pelosi suggested the White House and Democrats could renew talks toward a 
broader aid package." She said, "We're at the table. We want to continue the conversation. 
We've made some progress, we're exchanging language." The Wall Street Journal (10/8, Al, 
Peterson, Sider, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) says while Pelosi said Thursday that 
Democrats are open to discussions on a larger deal, there was little to suggest one could be 
reached before Election Day. 
The New York Times (10/8, Cochrane, 18.61M) says Pelosi, "her position bolstered by the 
president publicly taking credit on Tuesday for torpedoing the talks, made it clear to the 
administration that any deal would be on her terms." In comments a separate New York Times 
(10/8, Cochrane, 18.61M) story says "cast doubt on the prospects for a compromise just hours 
after President Trump had given an upbeat assessment," Pelosi "said she would not agree to 
stand-alone aid package for airlines unless the Trump administration committed to a broader 
pandemic relief plan to help struggling Americans." Pelosi said "there is no stand-alone bill 
without a bigger bill." Roll Call (10/8, Wehrman, McPherson, 154K) reports Pelosi "said she is 
willing to move airline aid separately but only if there's `a guarantee' that there will also be a 
larger package containing aid for state and local governments, schools, testing and contact 
tracing, as well as unemployment assistance and workplace safety regulations." 
Reuters (10/8, Zengerle) reports Pelosi told Bloomberg TV there was "a clear 
understanding" that airlines aid had "to be in the context of a fuller bill. They don't have to 
happen at the same moment but they have to be happening with the assurance that we will go 
beyond the assistance to the airlines." Bloomberg (10/8, Wasson, 4.73M) reports Pelosi told 
Bloomberg TV "that she drew the `inference' that [Treasury Secretary Steven] Mnuchin was 
interested in broader stimulus talks and that she had confidence in the Treasury secretary. But 
she said the White House hasn't provided a full counteroffer to the $2.2 trillion plan that the 
House passed last week as the Democrats' negotiating position." Politico (10/8, Caygle, Ferris, 
Mintz, 4.29M) says "Pelosi's comments appeared to be a change in direction for Democrats, one 
day after she and some top lawmakers had privately discussed moving ahead with an airlines-
only relief bill as soon as this week." 
NBC Nightly NewsVi (10/8, story 9, 1:55, Costello, 5.56M) reported, "Airline CEOs are 
growing frustrated." American Airlines CEO Doug Parker: "If that can't happen before the 
election, that is going to have a seriously detrimental impact on our ability to continue to 
provide essential service to the country to help it come out of this coronavirus." 
Director of Trade and Manufacturing Policy Navarro said on WTNH-TVVi Hartford, CT 
(10/8, 1.94M), "It's been bad faith negotiations. If she wants to change her mind, we can get 
this done in a day. ... Nancy Pelosi is inflicting pain and misery on the people of America in 
order to basically try to make sure Donald Trump doesn't win the presidency. It's despicable."
