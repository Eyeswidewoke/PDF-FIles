means the case was opened in the FBI's Baltimore office, which covers Wilmington, Del., where 
the subpoena was executed. 'The FBI cannot open a case without predication, so they believed 
there was predication for criminal activity,' a government official told Fox News. 'This means 
there was sufficient evidence to believe that there was criminal conduct." 
Giuliani Turns Over Hunter Biden Laptop To Delaware Authorities. The Delaware 
News Journal (10/21, Baker, 360K) reports, "Rudy Giuliani's efforts to tarnish Joe Biden's 
presidential campaign continued in Delaware when he visited a police station Monday to share 
files from what he said was Hunter Biden's laptop." A spokesman for Delaware Attorney General 
Kathy Jennings (D) said, "They've got a hard drive, or a laptop, or something to that effect. 
They try to turn it over to New Castle County PD. New Castle County PD calls us." 
TIME (10/21, 18.47M) reports on its website that "explicit photos and emails purportedly 
belonging to Hunter Biden were circulating in Ukraine last year at the same time that Rudy 
Giuliani was searching for dirt there on former Vice President Joe Biden," according to "two 
people approached about the material during that period. ... The emails' alleged availability, 
which has not been previously reported, comes to light in the wake of Giuliani's recent claims 
that he obtained private photos and emails of Hunter Biden from a broken laptop abandoned in 
Delaware." 
White House Senior Communications Advisor Ben Williamson said on Fox Across America 
(10/21), "You had Democrats over the weekend...making the sort of preliminary allegation that 
this was Russian disinformation as they so often like to do with anything that is inconvenient to 
the Democrat Party, but we're slowly starting to see more and more evidence, as we usually do, 
come out that that's not the case, that this is a real, legit concern." Asked about criticism of 
Rudy Giuliani on One America News NetworkVi (10/21, 28K), Morgenstern said, "He has 
uncovered information that is incredibly damaging and threatening. It shows that a major 
party's candidate may have been compromised by a foreign power." 
Joe Biden Says Son Did Not Profit Off Family Name. Fox News (10/21, Fordham, 
27.59M) reports on its website that Joe Biden, in a Wisconsin interview, denied that his son 
profited because of his family name. Joe Biden said, "This is the same garbage [from] Rudy 
Giuliani, Trump's henchman. It's the last-ditch effort in this desperate campaign to smear me 
and my family." The Daily Caller (10/21, 716K) reports Biden was responding to claims from 
Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI) "that Hunter Biden has 'profited off the Biden name' through his 
foreign business dealings." 
Chief of Staff Meadows said on Fox News' Bill Hemmer Reports (10/21), "This is not about 
Hunter Biden. This is about the Biden family, this is about pay-for-play. This is actually about 
what kind of access did Hunter Biden sell to his father, the Vice President? That's what this is all 
about." 
Trump: Facebook, Twitter Are Trying To Protect Biden. President Trump was asked 
in a town hall hosted by Sinclair Broadcasting GroupVI (10/21, 11K) if Facebook and Twitter are 
biased. Trump said, "Oh, 100%. And frankly, that's turning out to be as big a story as the 
corruption itself. They are trying to protect [Joe Biden) because that's the way it is with the 
Democrats. It's a part of the Democrat Party, I guess. But they're trying to protect Biden from 
this corruption where they get caught." 
Russian Analyst Behind Dossier Claims Steele Paid Him For "Raw Intelligence." 
The New York Times (10/21, Savage, Goldman, Kessel, 18.61M) reports that "when the 
publication of a dossier of unproven rumors about Donald J. Trump and Russia rocked American 
politics in early 2017, one salacious claim jumped out: Russia intelligence services supposedly 
had a video showing Mr. Trump cavorting with prostitutes in Moscow's Ritz-Carlton hotel." The 
Times says "no evidence emerged supporting the existence of any tape." The claim came from 
Igor Danchenko, "a Russia analyst who gathered leads about possible Trump-Russia links for 
what turned out to be Democratic-funded opposition research." The Times reports that 
Danchenko "describe[s) hearing rumors from two sources about a possible sex tape involving
