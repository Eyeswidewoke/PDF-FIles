"Clark's scheme was to steal the identities of prominent people, then post messages in their 
names directing victims to send Bitcoin to accounts he owned. The accounts received more 
than 400 transfers and he reaped more than $100,000 in bitcoin in just one day, the state 
attorney's office said Friday." 
The AP (8/1, Fischer, Bajak) reports, "In one of the most high-profile security breaches in 
recent years, bogus tweets were sent out on July 15 from the accounts of Barack Obama, Joe 
Biden, Mike Bloomberg and a number of tech billionaires including Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, 
Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Celebrities Kanye West and his wife, 
Kim Kardashian West, were also hacked. The tweets offered to send $2,000 for every $1,000 
sent to an anonymous Bitcoin address. The hack alarmed security experts because of the grave 
potential of such an intrusion for creating geopolitical mayhem with disinformation." 
Politico (7/31, Matishak, 4.29M) reports, "The breach sparked a massive outcry from 
Capitol Hill, with lawmakers demanding the social media giant quickly come clean about the 
circumstances around the breach. Several Senate panels, including Intelligence, Commerce and 
Homeland Security, have been weighing if they should launch their own investigations into the 
incident."

"plans to take action on a what he sees as a broad array of national security risks presented by 
software connected to the Chinese Communist Party." Appearing on Fox News' Sunday Morning 
FuturesY , Pompeo said, "These Chinese software companies doing business in the United 
States, whether it's TikTok or WeChat - there are countless more...are feeding data directly to 
the Chinese Communist Party, their national security apparatus. Could be their facial 
recognition patterns. It could be information about their residence, their phone numbers, their 
friends, who they're connected to. Those are the issues that President Trump has made clear 
we're going to take care of." 
Reuters (8/2, Chiacu) quotes Pompeo as saying, "President Trump has said `enough' and 
we're going to fix it and so he will take action in the coming days with respect to a broad array 
of national security risks that are presented by software connected to the Chinese Communist 
Party." The Washington Times (8/2, Glenn, 492K) reports Pompeo also warned, "These are true 
national security issues. For a long time, the United States just said, `Goodness, if we're having
