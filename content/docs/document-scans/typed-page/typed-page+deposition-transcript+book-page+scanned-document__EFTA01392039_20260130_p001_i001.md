Glendower Capital Secondary Opportunities Fund IV. LP 
THIS MEMORANDUM. 
EACH OF GLENDOWER CAPITAL, LLP AND THE GENERAL PARTNER IS EXEMPT FROM 
REGISTRATION WITH THE U.S. COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION (THE 'CFTC') AND IS 
NOT REGISTERED WITH THE CFTC AS A COMMODITY POOL OPERATOR ('CPO'), PURSUANT TO AN 
EXEMPTION UNDER CFTC REGULATION SECTION 4.13(AX3) FOR POOLS (A) WHOSE INTERESTS 
ARE EXEMPT FROM REGISTRATION UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT AND ARE OFFERED AND SOLD 
WITHOUT MARKETING TO THE PUBLIC IN THE UNITED STATES, (B) WHOSE PARTICIPANTS ARE 
LIMITED TO ACCREDITED INVESTORS AND (C) WHOSE INVESTMENTS IN COMMODITY INTEREST 
POSITIONS ARE LIMITED SUCH THAT EITHER (1) THE AGGREGATE INITIAL MARGIN, PREMIUMS 
AND REQUIRED MINIMUM DEPOSIT FOR RETAIL FOREX TRANSACTIONS (AS DEFINED IN CFTC 
REGULATION SECTION 5.1(M)) REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH SUCH POSITIONS, DETERMINED AT THE 
TIME OF THE MOST RECENTLY ESTABLISHED POSITION, DOES NOT EXCEED 5% OF THE 
LIQUIDATION VALUE OF THE POOL'S PORTFOLIO, AFTER TAKING INTO ACCOUNT UNREALIZED 
PROFITS AND UNREALIZED LOSSES ON ANY SUCH POSITIONS IT HAS ENTERED INTO, PROVIDED 
THAT, IN THE CASE OF AN OPTION THAT IS IN-THE-MONEY AT THE TIME OF PURCHASE, THE IN-
THE-MONEY AMOUNT AS DEFINED IN CFTC REGULATION SECTION 190.01 MAY BE EXCLUDED IN 
COMPUTING SUCH 5% OR (2) AN AGGREGATE NET NOTIONAL VALUE OF SUCH POSITIONS, 
DETERMINED AT THE TIME OF THE MOST RECENTLY ESTABLISHED POSITION, DOES NOT 
EXCEED 100% OF THE LIQUIDATION VALUE OF THE POOL'S PORTFOLIO, AFTER TAKING INTO 
ACCOUNT UNREALIZED PROFITS AND UNREALIZED LOSSES ON ANY SUCH POSITIONS IT HAS 
ENTERED INTO. THEREFORE, UNLIKE A REGISTERED CPO, NEITHER THE MANAGER NOR THE 
GENERAL PARTNER IS REQUIRED TO DELIVER A DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT (AS DEFINED IN THE 
CFTC REGULATIONS) AND A CERTIFIED ANNUAL REPORT TO INVESTORS. 
THE CFTC DOES NOT PASS UPON THE MERITS OF PARTICIPATING IN A POOL OR UPON THE 
ADEQUACY OR ACCURACY OF AN OFFERING MEMORANDUM. CONSEQUENTLY, THE CFTC HAS 
NOT REVIEWED OR APPROVED THIS OFFERING OR THIS MEMORANDUM.

FURNISHED BY CREDIT SUISSE AS PLACEMENT AGENT SOLELY FOR USE BY PROSPECTIVE 
INVESTORS IN CONNECTION WITH THIS OFFERING. CREDIT SUISSE IS ACTING AS PLACEMENT 
AGENT FOR THE GENERAL PARTNER, AND, IN THAT CAPACITY, IS NOT ACTING AS INVESTMENT 
ADVISER, MUNICIPAL ADVISOR, OR FIDUCIARY TO POTENTIAL PURCHASERS IN CONNECTION 
WITH THE INTERESTS OFFERED IN THIS MEMORANDUM. IN ACTING AS PLACEMENT AGENT, 
CREDIT SUISSE IS NOT ADVISING ANY RECIPIENT OF THIS MEMORANDUM REGARDING WHETHER 
THE FUND IS MORE APPROPRIATE FOR SUCH RECIPIENT'S INVESTMENT NEEDS THAN OTHER 
SIMILAR FUNDS THAT MAY BE AVAILABLE. POTENTIAL INVESTORS MUST MAKE THEIR OWN 
INVESTMENT DECISIONS. IN MAKING THOSE DECISIONS, POTENTIAL INVESTORS SHOULD BE 
AWARE THAT CREDIT SUISSE WILL RECEIVE A PLACEMENT FEE FROM THE GENERAL PARTNER 
(OR ITS AFFILIATE) THAT IS GENERALLY BASED UPON THE AMOUNT OF INTERESTS IN THE FUND 
SUBSCRIBED FOR BY THE INVESTORS. CREDIT SUISSE IS NOT ACTING AND WILL NOT ACT AS A

CONSULT WITH THEIR OWN INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL ADVISORS BEFORE TAKING ACTION WITH 
RESPECT TO ANY SERVICES, MATERIAL OR INFORMATION PROVIDED TO THEM BY CREDIT 
SUISSE. CREDIT SUISSE ALSO WILL NOT SOLICIT A COVERED PARTY FOR DIRECT OR INDIRECT 
COMPENSATION ON BEHALF OF AN UNAFFILIATED INVESTMENT ADVISER FOR THE PURPOSE OF 
OBTAINING OR RETAINING AN ENGAGEMENT FOR THAT INVESTMENT ADVISER BY THE COVERED 
PARTY TO PROVIDE INVESTMENT ADVISORY SERVICES TO OR ON BEHALF OF THE COVERED 
PARTY. CREDIT SUISSE ALSO SEEKS TO DO BUSINESS WITH AND EARN FEES OR COMMISSIONS 
FROM AFFILIATES OF THE GENERAL PARTNER OF THE FUND AND ITS PORTFOLIO COMPANIES,
