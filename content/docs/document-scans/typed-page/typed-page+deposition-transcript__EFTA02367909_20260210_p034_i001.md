During the '80s, Collins was enormously successful in balancing his continuing solo work with his membership in Genesis. 
In=1992, Genesis released We Can't Dance and began an extensive to=r. Upon its completion, Collins released Both 
Sides in 1993, and the record became his first album not to produce a major hit single or go multi-platinum. In 1995, he 
announced that he was leaving Genesis permanently. The following year, he relea=ed Dance into the Light. Although 
the album didn't chart =ighly, its subsequent supporting tour was a success. The Hits' collection fo=lowed in 1998, and a 
year later Collins made his first big-band record, Hot Night in Pa=is. The song cycle Testify arrived in 2002, and his next 
studio-recorded solo release was 2010's Going Back, whi=h saw him revisiting the Motown hits that so influenced him 
and featured three of the surviving Funk Brothers -- guitari=ts Eddie Willis and Ray Monette, and bassist Bob 
Babbitt.<=p> 
After some time out of the spotlight, much=of it spent recovering from physical ailments, Collins returned in 2014 to 
play a couple of songs =t his sons' school and to write songs with Adele. Soon after, he be=an work on reissuing his solo 
albums, sorting through the archives for demos and live recordings to =lesh them out. In early 2016, Warner Music 
began releasing the discs in pairs, with new portraits of Collins on the co=ers in place of the original images. Collins 
returned to the stage in March of 2016, performing at the Little Dreams =oundation Benefit Gala in Miami. He published 
his autobiography,=Not Dead Yet: The Memoir, in October of that year, and the double-disc compilation The Singles 
appeared during the same month. 
When his work with Genes=s, his work with other artists, as well as his solo career is totaled, Collins had more US Top 40 
singles than=any other artist during the 1980s. His most successful singles from the period include "In the Air Tonight", 
"Against All Odds (Take a Look at Me Now)"= "One More Night", "Sussudio" and "Another D=y in Paradise". Collins' 
discography includes eight studio albums that have sold 33.5 million certified units in the US and an estimated 150 
million worldwi=e, making him one of the world's best-selling artists. He is one of =nly two recording artists, along with 
Paul McCartney, who have sold over 100 million records worldwide both as solo artists and separately as principal 
members of a band. <=pan> 
Collins has won seven Grammy Awards, six Brit Awards, two Golden Globe Awards, an A=ademy Award, and a Disney 
Legend Award. In 1999, he recei=ed a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and was inducted into the Songwriters Hall 
of Fame in 2003, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Genesis in 2010, the Modern Drummer Hall of Fame in 
2012, and the Classic Drummer Hall of Fame in 2013. Despite his commercial success and his status as a respected and 
influential drummer, music critics are divided in their opinion of his work=and he has publicly received both criticism and 
praise from other prominent mus=c artists. Although known to be difficult to work with Phil Collins has been a major 
influence in Rock/Pop Music arou=d the world and with this you are again invited to enjoy the music of one of =he most 
multi-talented musicians and sometimes actor  Mr. Phil=Collins....
