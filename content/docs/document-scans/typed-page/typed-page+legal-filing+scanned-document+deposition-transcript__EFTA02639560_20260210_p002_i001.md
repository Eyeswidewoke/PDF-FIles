curated by the FSB and =poon-fed to Steele. If so, the FSB was the surreptitious provider of =his part of the Steele 
dossier. 
The third disclosure operation involved stolen =mails from the DNC bearing on the unfair treatment by Democratic Party 
=fficials of Bernie Sanders, which were posted on the DC Leaks website. =resident Obama identified the Kremlin as the 
author of this operation, =aying "These data theft and disclosure activities could only =ave been directed by the highest 
levels of the Russian government."=ff so, as in the previous cases, the FSB would have curated the dirt. =o be sure, oppo-
research operatives, because of their singular focus on =etting usable slime, are highly vulnerable to shady offers, but 
why =ould Russia so blatantly feed the slime to all sides in a =ampaign? 
The United =tates has a wide array of tools for monitoring Russian intelligence, =ncluding the world's most sophisticated 
sensors for =ntercepting signals, but discovering the Kremlin's motives =emains an elusive enterprise because, unlike in 
a scientific inquiry, =ne cannot fully trust the observable data. While a scientist can safely =ssume that the microbes he 
observes through the lens of a microscope =re not employing guile to mislead him, an intelligence analyst cannot =ake 
similar assumptions about the content of intercepted communications =rom Russia. If one assumes that the Russians do 
not know that the =hannel is being monitored—an assumption which, following the =efection of Edward Snowden to 
Russia, is hard to make prudently—t=en the intelligence gleaned from that channel can reveal the =remlin's activities 
and motive. If, however, it is understood =hat the Russians know that a channel is being monitored, the =nformation 
conveyed over it can be considered a disclosure =peration. 
If, for =xample, a Mafia family finds out that the FBI is tapping its telephone =ines, it can use those lines to burn its 
rivals. The Kremlin can also =se a knowntapped phone line to its advantage. Consider, for =xample, the tapped phone of 
Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak. On =ecember 1, 2016, Kislyak went to Trump Tower to meet Jared Kushner and 
=ichael Flynn. According to Kushner's version of that meeting, =islyak suggested that Russian generals could supply 
information about =ussian military operations in Syria on the condition that the Trump =ransition team provide a 
"secure line in the transition =ffice." Of course, as Kislyak likely knew, transition teams =on't have secure lines to 
Moscow. Kushner responded by asking =f the Russian embassy could supply such a "secure line." =islyak then used an 
open phone line at his embassy to relay Kushner•=99s response to his foreign ministry in Moscow. It is inconceivable 
=hat Kislyak did not know that the call would be monitored by the FBI, =ince the FBI had routinely listened in on these 
lines for the past 68 =ears, or that his discussion of Kushner's request would set off =larm bells in the intelligence 
community. 
If Kislyak had wanted to hide this exchange from =.S. intelligence, he could have easily sent it under diplomatic cover 
=irectly to Moscow, used a secure line, or relayed it in a coded =ashion. By communicating the message en clair, or in 
plaintext, =islyak skillfully exposed Kushner's incredibly stupid response, =hich he himself had provoked, to stoke distrust 
about the incoming =resident within the U.S. intelligence community. Nor was this the only =istrust Kislyak cultivated: 
the conversations on the monitored phone =ed to the firing of National Security Advisor Michael Flynn, and 
=onversations that Kislyak had with Attorney General Jeff Sessions led =o Sessions's recusing himself from the Russian 
investigation, =hich has now driven a wedge between President Trump and one of his most =ffective and popular 
cabinet members. 
Kislyak's resume indicates that he is a =ell-regarded and competent player in the game of nations: he has served =s 
Second Secretary of the Soviet UN mission in New York, First =ecretary of the Soviet Embassy in Washington, Deputy 
Director of the =oviet Department of International Organizations in Moscow, Permanent =ussian representative to 
NATO in Brussels, Deputy Foreign Minister, and =mbassador to the United States. Nothing in his 37-year career, either 
=uring or after the Cold War, suggests that his moves are not aligned =ith Kremlin strategy. 
But when it comes to the various disclosures and =nterventions surrounding the 2016 election, what exactly was that 
=trategy? 
In a report =ssued on January 6, 2017, entitled "Assessing Russian =ctivities and Intentions in Recent U.S. Elections," the 
U.S. =ntelligence community concluded, based both on its sources and its =nalysis of stories on the Russian-controlled 
network RT, that Putin =anted to hurt Clinton, help Trump, and discredit the American election. =hese may well have 
been motives of the Russian president, but the =arrowly focused assessment fails to explain, or even take into account, 
=islyak's post-election ensnarement of Kushner, or the =iscrediting dirt against Trump. If Putin had really wanted to help 
=rump win the election, why did Russian sources provide damaging dirt to =teele, which could have cost Trump the 
election? Why did Kislyak =rovide the FBI with information, via a known tapped line, that could =and did) compromise 
key members of Trump's =dministration?
