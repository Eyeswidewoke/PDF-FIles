Oregon:" In his ruling, Mosman held the AG "did not have standing to bring the case because it 
had not shown that the issue was 'an interest that is specific to the state itself.'" 
The Hill (7/24, Axelrod, 2.98M) reports Mosman's "ruling comes a day after another 
federal judge issued a restraining order barring federal officers from arresting or using force 
against journalists and legal observers at the demonstrations." 
Bloomberg (7/24, Roth, Nayak, 4.73M) says the ruling "probably means the end of the 
lawsuit and could make it harder for local officials elsewhere to resist deployments of federal 
agents, said Stanford Law School professor David Sklansky." 
According to the AP (7/25, Flaccus, Cline), "six federal officers were injured and one 
person was arrested" in confrontations that "continued into the early morning Saturday as 
demonstrations that have happened every night for two months showed no signs of letting up." 
The AP says "federal agents entered the crowd around 2:30 a.m. Saturday and marched in a 
line down the street, clearing remaining protesters with volleys of tear gas at close range," after 
the Federal Protective Service declared the gathering an "unlawful assembly." 
The CBS Weekend NewsVi (7/25, story 10, 1:12, Yuccas, 2.41M) reported "thousands 
demonstrated again near the federal courthouse" on Friday night, amid intensifying unrest over 
the presence of federal officers in the city. In addition, "Portland police say protesters shot 
fireworks and threw objects at federal law enforcement." 
The Wall Street Journal (7/24, Paul, Lazo, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) reports the 
Justice Department earlier on Friday announced charges against 18 people in Portland over 
alleged crimes at a federal courthouse, including assaulting officers, trespassing, and arson. 
The Associated Press (7/25, Flaccus, Cline) and The Hill (7/25, Johnson, 2.98M) provide 
similar coverage of the Saturday morning confrontation. 
Group Of Veterans Forms Wall At Portland Protest. The New York Times (7/25, 
Baker, 18.61M) reports "a group of military veterans on Friday joined the front lines of" the 
protests in Portland, to ensure "federal officers did not infringe on the free speech of 
protesters." The group formed a wall "in front of a fence erected outside the federal 
courthouse," and "stayed together until a cloud of tear gas scattered much of the crowd." 
ABC World News TonightVi (7/25, story 9, 0:51, Norman, 4.36M) reported the veterans 
were "outraged by video showing federal officers tear gassing and hitting Navy Veteran 
Christopher David with a baton last week," and joined similar walls being formed by "moms and 
dads...protecting Black Lives Matter protesters." 
NBC Nightly NewsVi (7/25, story 14, 0:33, Perry, 3.83M) also reported on the "wall of 
veterans" briefly. 
FBI Defends Federal Action In Portland. The Hill (7/25, Moreno, 2.98M) reports the 
"FBI defended its actions in ongoing confrontations between federal agents and demonstrators 
in Portland" in a Friday statement, saying it was investigating "specific violations of federal law, 
including arson, the use of improvised explosive devices, and interstate transportation of stolen 
goods." Renn Cannon, special agent in charge of Portland's FBI field office, said the agency's 
"focus is not on membership in particular groups but on individuals who commit violence and 
criminal activity that constitutes a federal crime or poses a threat to national security," adding 
that "The FBI does not and will not police ideology." 
WPost Details Legal Justification For Federal Presence In Portland. In an 
analysis, the Washington Post (7/25, Vladeck, 14.2M) examines the legal authority President 
Trump has "to deploy federal law enforcement officers to Portland, Ore., Seattle and other 
cities." The Post explains that the federal "government lacks a general 'police power," but "may 
unquestionably use federal law enforcement officers to protect federal buildings like the three 
U.S. courthouses the Trump administration says it's defending in Portland" and "to arrest those 
who commit federal crimes." When acting within its constitutional limits, the federal 
government "can override local and state authority, even when local and state officials object." 
However, the "deployments might very well be unlawful" if the government deploys "large
