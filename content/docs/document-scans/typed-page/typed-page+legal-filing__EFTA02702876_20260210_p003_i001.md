efficiency function determines whether or not policing is more 
likely to evolve for single or multiple matings. In Section 8. we 
analyze our results for the case where the phenotypic mutation 
induced by the mutant allele is weak (or, equivalently in our 
formalism, the case of weak penetrance). In this setting, the 
quantity of interest is the intensity of policing. We locate the 
evolutionarily singular strategies. These are the values of intensity 
of policing for which mutant workers with slightly different 
policing behavior are, to first order in the mutant phenotype. 
neither advantageous nor disadvantageous. We then determine if 
a singular strategy is an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS). In 
Section 9. we discuss the relationship between policing and 
inclusive fitness theory. together with the limitations of the 
relatedness-based argument. Section 10 concludes. 
2. The model 
We investigate worker policing in insect colonies with haplo-
diploid genetics. Each queen mates n times. We derive conditions 
under which a mutation that effects worker policing can spread in 
a population. We make the simplifying assumption, as do 
Wowiechowski and Loninicki (1987) and Rat nicks (1988). that the 
colony's sex ratio is not affected by the intensity of worker 
policing. 
First we consider the case of a dominant mutant allele. Because 
the policing allele confers a gain of function on its bearer, the 
assumption that it is dominant is reasonable. There are two types 
of males. A and a. There are three types of females, AA. Aa, and aa. 
If the mutant allele is dominant then Aa and aa workers kill the 
male eggs of other workers, while M workers do not. (Alter-
natively, M workers police with intensity ZAA, while Aa and ao 
workers police with intensity Zaa = 
=Zm+w. We consider this 
case in Section 8.) For n matings, there are 3m + 1) types of mated 
queens. We use the notation AA, in; Ac. in; and art m to denote the 
genome of the queen and the number, m. of her matings that were 
with mutant males. a. The parameter m can assume values 
0.1....,n. A schematic of the possible mating events is shown in 
Fig. 1(a). 
There are three types of females, AA. Aa. and aft and there are 
n+1 possible combinations of males that each queen can mate 
with. (For example, a queen that mates three times (n=3) can 
mate with three type A males. two type A males and one type a 
male, one type A male and two type a males, or three type a 
males.) Fig. I (b) shows the different colony types and the offspring 
of each type of colony when each queen is singly mated. Fig. I 
(c) shows the different colony types and the offspring of each type 
of colony when each queen mates n times. The invasion of the 
mutant allele only depends on a subset of colony types. The cal-
culations of invasion conditions are presented in detail in 
Appendix A. 
2.1. Fraction of male offspring produced by the queen 
pa represents the fraction of males that are queen-derived if the 
fraction of police workers is z. (This quantity was already 
employed by Ratnieks. 1988.) The parameter z can vary between 
0 and 1. For z=0. there are no police workers in the colony, and for 
z= 1, all workers in the colony are policing. We expect that pa is an 
increasing function of z. Increasing the fraction of police workers 
increases the fraction of surviving male eggs that come from the 
queen (Fig. 2).

nip I (a) The possible fluting events with haplodiploid genetics are shown. Each 
queen mates with n malts. m denotes the number of times that a queen mates with 
mutant type a males and can take values between 0 and n. Thus. there are 3Ot I I) 
types of colonies. (b) If each queen mates with only a single male, then there are six 
types of colonies. The female and male offspring (right three columns) of each 
colony (leftmost column) are shown. For example. M, I colonies arise from a type 
M female fluting with a single mutant type a male. AA. I queens produce female 
offspring of type Aa and male offspring of type A. 50% of the offspring of workers in 
AA. I colonies ate of type A. while the remaining 50% of the offspring of workers in 
M. I colonies are of type o. (c) The female and male offspring fright three columns)

force means that a greater amount of worker-laid eggs can be eaten or removed.

22 Colony efficiency as a function of policing

r, represents the rate at which a colony produces offspring 
(virgin queens and males) if the fraction of police workers is z. 
(This quantity was also employed by Ratnieks. 1988.) Without loss 
of generality, we can set rc, = I. For a given mutation that affects 
the intensity of policing, and for a given biological setting, the 
efficiency function ra may take any one of a variety of forms 
(Fig. 3). 
Colony efficiency depends on interactions among police work-
ers and other colony members. It also depends on the interactions 
of colonies and their environment. There are some obvious nega-
tive effects that policing can have on colony efficiency. By the act
