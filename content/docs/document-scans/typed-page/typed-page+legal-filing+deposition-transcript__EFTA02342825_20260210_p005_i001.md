However, as an academic, I have t= be objective and mention the one thing that may be 
controversial in some parts of the world, t=ough we see it as just, which is the capital punishment. Our courts have 
issued t=e death sentence in a number of cases, and they were executed this year after Sheikh Sabah approved them. I 
should, however, clarify that our justice syst=m is quite thorough; the Kuwaiti Constitution guarantees defendants three 
leve=s of court hearings to allow for full defence, and the death sentence is passe= only when guilt of a crime is 
established beyond the shadow of a doubt. 
At any rate, the debate on the c=pital punishment is beyond the scope of this letter. But 
I should emphasise the fact that as Hea= of State, Sheikh Sabah had pledged to protect the country's constitu=ion and 
laws. To confirm that justice always prevails, it may be worth citing that o=e of the convicts sentenced to death was a 
relative of Sheikh Sabah's.= 
I understand that cultural diffe=ences are part of life, and there will always be 
differences in peoples' customs, traditions= values, race, faiths and perspectives. And I trust that universal values 
common to a=l cultures are the things that matter for the Nobel Prize, such as the contributions by a nominee that have 
benefited humanity. 
fraternity between nations, and promoting peace congresses. This is what Sheikh Sabah 
h=s done with distinction. As for the abolition or reduction of standing armies,=it is a matter that applies to Kuwait too, 
not only because of our small nation=and small army, but due to the fact that Kuwait's Constitution, to w=ich Sheikh 
Sabah made contributions and voted for its approval in the 196Os, forbids th= initiation of war or carrying any hostilities 
against other nations. =/font> 
Do kings and princes need furthe= accolades and recognition? I cannot answer on behalf 
of my Amir, and despite its global prestige and significance, the Nobel Peace Prize might be his least concern.=But I can 
talk for my country when I say that Kuwait under Sheikh Sabah*=99s rule has been a strong and active advocate for 
peace, love and giving, especially=when these values are most needed. I think it's time to encourage th=s kind of model 
nation. 
Furthermore, I believe that with=the universal respect it enjoys, the Nobel Peace Prize 
would also be seen as a global message for all=parties to the several conflicts in our troubled but globally sensitive 
region to refrain from escalation and look for solutions and reconciliation via diplomatic means. The Nobel recognition 
may also give further impetus to She=kh Sabah's drive to end the war in Yemen and other crises in the region= In this 
way, the Nobel Peace Prize would have surpassed its goal of recognising past=achievements to supporting the future in 
world peace. 
In conclusion, I am honoured, as=a Kuwaiti citizen and an academic, to nominate my 
Amir, Sheikh Sabah Al Ahmed, for consideration for t=e Nobel Peace Prize 2O18. And as I started I end by saying : Peace 
Be Upon You=
