4500 Graduate Microeconomics 
Faculty: Banerjec Lopamudra R 
06:00 PM - 07:50 PM 
Credits: 3 
CRN 3252 Sec A 
This course examines how microeconomics explains the behavior of economic agents. We start 
with the primitive: An (microeconomicl agent chooses between alternative options to optimize her 
objective subject to a constraint. We analyze how this choice is made under the following 
conditions: [1] agents have well-defined property rights. (2] agents are price-takers. (31agents 
have all the relevant information in making their choices, and [4] agents are consistent in making 
their choices. Next we analyze how behavior of the agent changes when each of these conditions 
are relaxed. Accordingly, the course is divided in the following pans: Part 1 focuses on modeling 
households, firms, and markets when the above mentioned three conditions hold. Here we review 
the theory of consumer choice; the theory of the cost-minimizing and profit-maximizing competitive 
firm; cost functions and industry equilibrium; demand and supply, particularly applied to the labor 
market. In Pan 2 of the course, we relax the condition that 'agents have well.defined property 
rights'. Here we explore the problem of market failure due to externalities and public good. In Part 
3 of the course we relax the condition that ' agents are price takers'. Here we analyze the models 
of imperfect competition and the basic concepts of game theory. In part 4 of the course, we relax 
the condition that agents have all the relevant information in making their choices'. Here we 
examine the problem of choice under uncertainty: the problem of incomplete and asymmetric 
information in market interactions, includingthe issues of moral hazard. adverse selection, and 
signaling. In Part 5 of the course we relax the condition that ' agents are consistent in making their 
choices', and touch upon the procedural aspects of decision making.

CRN 3750 Sec A 
this course brings economic theory and political theory to bear on the analysis of contemporary 
economic problems. including the Asian financial crisis, the stagnation of wages in the United 
States, the monetary union in Europe. and economic integration of the Americas. Other possible 
topics include migration and urbanization, trade and investment, nationalism and national class 
divisions. patterns of the world division of labor, the economics of race and gender, the 
globalization of capital, the changing role of the modern state. contemporary macro policy. 
financial instability, technological change, and business organization. Lectures by guests provide 
historical background and use case studies to analyze issues in political economy. Crosslisted with 
New School for Social Research. This course satisfies Writings crosslisted course requirements.
