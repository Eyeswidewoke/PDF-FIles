Special Report Euroglut here to stay. trillions of outflows to go 
Metamorphosis into global lender far from completed 
At present, the euro area owes the world roughly 10% of its GDP. In other words, 
foreigners own more European assets than European investors do abroad. In 
theory, persistent current account surpluses will eventually offset this debt and 
turn the Eurozone into a net creditor. Once a mature lender, Europe's assets 
abroad will yield stable investment income on the current account. Interest and 
dividends will either be reinvested or spent on imports from the borrowing 
economies, thus being neutral or even bullish for the euro. While current account 
surpluses would tend to expand foreign wealth indefinitely, offsetting currency 
appreciation means that NIIPs eventually stabilize. 2 This is the situation in which 
Japan found itself during the 1990s, when a conservative BoJ, a large current 
account surplus and a large Japanese net foreign asset position led to persistent 
JPY strength. 
However, in contrast to Japan in the 1990s, the Eurozone is nowhere near the NIIP 
levels that would be consistent with its new equilibrium saving rate. It will take 
trillions of Euros worth of further investment outflows as well as significant 
depreciation over several years for the euro area to accumulate the net foreign 
wealth position associated with mature creditor economies. 
Eurozone only just embarking on transition toward being a net creditor 
Traditionally, the G10 universe has been divided into structural surplus and deficit 
economies. While Anglo-Saxon countries have tended to run current account 
deficits, Japan, Switzerland, Norway, and Sweden have generated consistent 
surpluses for decades. As a result of these highly persistent global imbalances, the 
two camps have accumulated large net international investment positions (NIIP), 
but with opposite signs. 
Upon its inception, the Eurozone joined the Anglo-Saxon cluster of net debtors, 
owing to the external debt positions of its member states. Its NIIP then quickly 
deteriorated as small end unstable current account surpluses were insufficient to 
offset negative valuation effects. The Lehman and most importantly the Eurozone 
crisis marked an inflection point, and the euro area has since run current account 
surpluses of a greater order of magnitude than during its first decade. Yet, coming 
from a low base level and still facing valuation headwind, the NIIP has improved 
only slowly and still stands at only -10% of GDP (Figure 5). Simple arithmetic 
suggests that this external debt ratio  is not  consistent with quarterly surpluses of
