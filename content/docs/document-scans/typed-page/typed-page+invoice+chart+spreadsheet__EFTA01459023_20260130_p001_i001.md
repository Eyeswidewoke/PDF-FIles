Our asset-class allocation in a balanced 
portfolio 
Traditional asset classes 
Within the core part of our balanced portfolio, we 
cover traditional liquid assets such as equities, fixed 
income and commodities. The chart shows how we 
would currently design a balanced portfolio, including 
alternative asset classes.' 
II Equities 
Equities have recovered from their end-September lows. Further 
modest gains are possible although periods of volatility are likely. 
A strong U.S. dollar could however prove a headwind for U.S. 
equities, whore valuations are already quite high. As a result we 
have a regional preference for European and Japanese equities, 
despite continuing concerns about the impact of slower Chinese 
growth. Earnings expectations for emerging-market equities 
still need to be revised down to more realistic levels. Within 
emerging-market equities, we continue to prefer Asia ex Japan 
over Latin America 
a Fixed income 
Central-bank-policy divergence will remain very important, 
through its impact both on yields and exchange rates. Even alter 
the Fed rate hike, we believe U.S Treasury yields will increase 
only modestly but the differential between them and core 
Eurozone government bonds will remain high. U.S investment-
grade debt may appear to offer an interesting risk-return trade-
off, particularly for non-U. S. investors hoping to benefit from 
U.S.-dollar appreciation. Investor attitudes to U.S. high-yield 
debt will depend on default-rate expectations, with sure high-
yield perhaps seen as offering lower potential rewards but also 
less risk. 
a Commodities 
Oil prices have fallen back recently towards their summer lows 
and we believe that any recovery is likely to be slow and modest. 
Despite evidence of falling U.S. production, the global oil market 
still appears to be in oversupply. A Fed rate hike is likely to create 
headwinds for the gold price and any price gains as a result of 
geopolitical developments are likely to be temporary. U.S:
strength is also expected to create further difficulties for oil, gold 
and other commodity prices. For these reasons we stay cautious 
on commodities as an asset class. 
Alternative investments are dealt with separately in the
