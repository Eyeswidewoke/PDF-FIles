DOJ Official Accuses FBI Leadership of 'insubordination,' Tamps Down Talk of Revenge on Agents 
The Associated Press (02/05, Tucker, Richer) reported that a top DOJ official accused the FBI's acting leaders of 
"insubordination" in a Wednesday memo in which he sought to soothe anxiety inside the Bureau over the potential 
for a broad purge of agents involved in investigating the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol. The memo from acting 
Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove said agents "who simply followed orders and carried out their duties in an 
ethical manner" while investigating the Capitol attack face no risk of being fired. According to the article, the memo 
also provided no reassurances for any agents found to have "acted with corrupt or partisan intent" and suggests 
those employees, if there are any, are at risk of discipline or even termination as part of a highly unusual 
review process the Trump administration is embarking upon to identify what it says is potential misconduct. The 
message from Bove is aimed at providing a measure of clarity after days of turmoil and uncertainty at the FBI as a 
result of an extraordinary DOJ demand on Friday for the names of agents who participated in the investigations so 
that officials could determine whether additional personnel action was merited. The article mentioned that many 
within the FBI had seen that request as a precursor for mass firings, particularly in light of separate moves to fire 
members of special counsel Jack Smith's team that investigated Donald Trump, reassign senior career DOJ officials, 
and force out prosecutors on Jan. 6 cases and multiple top FBI executives. Bove, in his memo Wednesday, accused 
the FBI's acting leadership of "insubordination" for resisting his requests last week "to identify the core team" 
responsible for Jan. 6 investigations. He said the requests were meant to "permit the Justice Department to 
conduct a review of those particular agents' conduct pursuant to Trump's executive order" on "weaponization" in 
the Biden administration. After acting Director Brian Driscoll refused to comply, Bove wrote, that he broadened the 
request for information about all FBI employees who participated in the investigations. Driscoll had no response to 
the insubordination allegation, the FBI said. The article stated that the FBI provided personnel details about several 
thousand employees, identifying them by unique employee numbers rather than by names. "Let me be clear," 
wrote Bove, who was previously part of Trump's legal team in his criminal cases. "No FBI employee who simply 
followed orders and carried out their duties in an ethical manner with respect to January 6 investigations is at risk 
of termination or other penalties." But, he added, "The only individuals who should be concerned about the 
process initiated by my January 31, 2025 memo are those who acted with corrupt or partisan intent, who blatantly 
defied orders from Department leadership, or who exercised discretion in weaponizing the FBI." Reuters (02/05,
