Methods 
The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review 
Boards of the hospital and university where the study was 
conducted. 
Participants 
All participants were premature infants in the hospital SCU. All 
admission logs and medical charts were reviewed soon after 
patients were admitted to the unit. We identified infants who 
met the following selection criteria for inclusion: (I) gesta-
tional age less than 36 weeks and birth weight no more than 
2600 g, (2) not on a ventilator or receiving oxygen inhalation 
therapy for respiratory illness, and (3) no neurological disease. 
Individual cases were reviewed with nurses caring for each 
infant. Parents/guardians received a recruitment letter detailing 
the study; they were given one week to decide about participa-
tion and were offered a video of their infant on DVD as a 
reward for participation at the conclusion of the study. Par-
ents/guardians and nurses were instructed not to play music 
to the infant from the time of enrollment to the experimental 
procedure. 
Written consent was obtained from the parents of 14 infants. 
Participants were pseudorandomized into the treatment group 
(N = 7 [4 males]) and control group (N =7 [5 males]) irrespec-
tive of sex and ethnicity. In total, 6 participants were from 
3 fraternal twin pairs and 2 participants were from fraternal 
triplets; in these cases, one sibling was assigned to the treat-
ment group and the other to the control group. Data for one 
male infant in the Control Group were excluded from the anal-
ysis because of a protocol violation: a parent played recorded 
music to him several hours a day. Each infant was tested indi-
vidually in her/his isolette. 
The age, sex, birthweight, gestational age, and Apgar 
scores of each participant are listed in Table I. The median 
gestational age for the control group was 33 weeks, one day; 
for the Treatment Group, the median gestational age was 
34 weeks. The median postdelivery age at the time of study 
was 7.5 days for the control group and 4 days for the treatment 
group. All infants had 5-minute Apgar scores of 7 or greater. 
There were no significant differences between groups for any 
of these background variables. The parents of all infants were 
English-speaking. 
Special Care Unit Environment and Routine Care 
All infants were admitted to the SCU under the care of an 
attending perinatologist, pediatrician, or nurse practitioner. 
Infants were housed in closed or open isolettes. The standard 
SCU protocol called for serologic testing every Sunday night 
or Monday morning. Heel sticks typically occurred between 
the hours of 9 and 11 PM or between 4 and 6 am, just before 
night time or morning feeding, respectively. Standard 
approaches to developmentally sensitive care were implemen-
ted throughout the infants' SCU stays (eg, swaddling, covering 
incubators to limit bright light exposure, limiting loud 
conversation). 
We measured the ambient sound level in the SCU on multi-
ple occasions. A Quest Technologies Impulse Sound Level 
Meter Model 2700 was held at the head of an empty, open isol-
ette. During daytime hours, the ambient sound level was 
approximately 62 dBA; at night, 56 dBA. 
Auditory Stimulation 
We listened to several commercially available CDs of lullabies 
sung by females in English. We selected one (SRT Music 
Groups') in which the lullabies were performed with simple 
accompaniment at moderate tempo. 
For each patient, the total music stimulation time was 
10 minutes. We avoided starting the music shortly before and 
during the heel stick because we did not want the patient to asso-
ciate music with the painful stimulus. We used a 10-minute 
window of observation because this provided a sufficient time 
window for normalization or near-nonnalization of pain-
induced changes in outcome variables.
