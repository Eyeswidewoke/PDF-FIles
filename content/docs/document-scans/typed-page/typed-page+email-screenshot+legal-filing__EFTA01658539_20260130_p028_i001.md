Issues With Storage May Leave 38 Without Access To COVID Vaccine. The AP 
(10/19, Hinnant, Mednick) reports that "the world's most promising coronavirus vaccine 
candidates need non-stop sterile refrigeration to stay potent and safe," but "despite enormous 
strides in equipping developing countries to maintain the vaccine 'cold chain,' nearly 3 billion of 
the world's 7.8 billion people live where temperature-controlled storage is insufficient for an 
immunization campaign to bring COVID-19 under control." As a result, "poor people around the 
world who were among the hardest hit by the virus pandemic are also likely to be the last to 
recover from it." 
COVID Cases Hitting Record Highs In Europe. 
ABC World News TonightVI (10/19, story 4, 1:25, Muir, 7.31M) foreign correspondent James 
Longman said Europe is "battling through COVID's second wave. France hitting record cases, 
over 32,000 on Saturday alone. ... In France, the positivity rate is up, now at 13.4%, and so 
are the deaths. Hospitals are starting to fill up, too." He added, "Like the USA, the majority of 
France's COVID cases affect the young. But now, the elderly are getting it again." Moreover, "In 
Belgium, a 79% increase in cases over last week. Bars, restaurants, and cafes closed. And in 
the UK, Wales ordered to go into total lockdown from Friday. We seem to be at the beginning of 
a trajectory, and if it continues in this fashion, hospitals like these will be overwhelmed. It's a 
fear many across Europe share." Moreover, "Ireland has announced it is going to go into a full 
six-week lockdown from Wednesday, among the harshest in Europe, and other countries are 
considering doing the same." 
Manchester, London Grievances Flare Up As Britain Moves Toward Lockdowns. 
The New York Times (10/19, Landler, 18.61M) reports that, for days, Greater Manchester Mayor 
Andy Burnham "has been engaged in a war of words" with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson 
"and his ministers over the government's plan to elevate hard-hit Manchester to the highest 
level of restrictions," which "would shut down pubs, bars and gyms and forbid all socializing by 
people from different households." Burnham "says that the restrictions would devastate the 
city's economy, and that the central government has not offered adequate financial aid to the 
people who would lose their jobs during the lockdown." He "has been a nearly ubiquitous 
presence on television, waging a fierce rebellion on behalf of his 2.8 million constituents."

record set less than a week ago, with 337 dead confirmed Monday as a resurgence of infections 
is overwhelming hospitals." The AP says Monday's total "represented a significant increase over 
Iran's previous one-day record of 279 set Wednesday." According to the AP, "The Islamic 
Republic emerged early in the pandemic as a global epicenter of the virus and has since seen 
the worst outbreak in the Middle East, with deaths topping 30,000, as fatalities have soared in 
recent weeks."
