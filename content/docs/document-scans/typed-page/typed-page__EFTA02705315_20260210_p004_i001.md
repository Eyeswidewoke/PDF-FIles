TURN-ON LEAD 
The M600/6 uses a conventional +12V remote 
turn-on lead, typically controlled by the source 
unit's remote turn.on output. The amplifier will 
turn on when +12V is present at its "Remote" 
input and turn off when +12V is switched off. If 
a source unit does not have a dedicated remote 
turn-on output. the amplifier's turn.on lead can 
be connected to +12V via a switch that derives 
power from an ignition-switched circuit. 
The M600/6's "Remote" turn-on connector Is 
designed to accept 18 AWG - 12 AWG wire. To 
connect the remote turn-on wire to the amplifier. 
first back out the set screw on the top of the 
terminal block using the supplied 2.5mm hex 
wrench. Strip 1/2 inch (12mm) of wire and insert 
the bare wire into the terminal block sating it 
firmly so that no bare wire is exposed. While 
holding the wire in the terminal, tighten the set 
screw firmly. taking care not to strip the head of 
the screw and making sure that the wire (not the 
insulation) is firmly gripped by the set screw.

INPUT SECTION 
The M600/es input section allows you to send 
signals to the amplifier section through the use 
of two, four or six differential-balanced inputs. 
Input connections are via up to three pairs of 
traditional RCA-type sacks.

If you wish to send six discrete channels into 
the M600/6, simply use all six inputs and set the 
"Input Mode' switch in the "6 Cl.? position. 
If you wish to feed all six channels by using 
only four channels of full-range input, set the 
"Input Mode" switch in the to "4 Ch." and use 
only the inputs to channels 1.2.3 & 4. In this 
mode. channels 5 & 6 will operate with a sum of 
the I & 3 and 2 & 4 input signals. respectively. 
If you wish to feed all six channels by using 
two channels of full-range input plus two 
channels of low-frequency input (subwoofer 
output from the source unit), first set the "Input 
Mode" switch to '6 Ch'. Next, it will be necessary 
to split the full-range signals with y-adaptors and 
feed these signals into the inputs to channels I & 
2 and 3 & 4. The dedicated subwoofer signal will 
be sent to channels 5 & 6. 
If you wish to use only two channels of 
input to deliver signal to all six amplifier 
channels. set the "Input Mode" switch to "2 
Ch' and use only the inputs to channels I & 
2. In this mode. Channels 3 & 5 will operate 
with the channel I signal and channels 4 & 
6 will operate with the Channel 2 signal. 
Input Voltar Rang*: 
The M600/6's input sections are designed to 
accept signal voltages from 100mV - 4V. This 
will accommodate all pnamp level signals and 
many speaker level signals. 
To use speaker-level sources, simply splice the 
speaker output wires of the source unit onto a 
pair of RCA plugs for each input pair. (or use II. 
Audio part XD-CLRA1C2-SW) No "line output 
converter" is needed in most cases. 
If you find that the output cannot be reduced 
sufficiently with a direct speaker level signal 
applied to the amplifier, you may use a "line 
output converter" to reduce the signal level. 
INPUT SENSITIVITY CONTROLS 
The controls labeled "Input Setts." located in 
each channel section can be used to match the 
source unit's output voltage to the input stage of 
each pair of amplifier channels for maximum 
clean output. Rotating the control clockwise will 
result in higher sensitivity (louder for a given 
input voltage). Rotating the control counter-
clockwise will result in lower sensitivity (quieter 
for a given input voltage.) 
To properly set the amplifier for maximum 
clean output, please refer to Appendix A (page 
14) in this manual. After using this procedure, 
you can then adjust any or all "Input Sens." 
levels downward if this is required to achieve the 
desired system balance. 
Do not Increase any "Input Sens." setting for 
any channel(s) of any amplifier In the system 
beyond the maximum level established during 
the procedure outlined in Appendix A (page 14). 
Doing so will result in audible distortion and 
possible speaker damage.
