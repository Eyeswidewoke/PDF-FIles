When we assume that inflation follows the implied 
breakeven rates priced in linkers, the cushion is a lot 
less and substantial real appreciation is required to 
balance returns as time goes by - again, in contrast 
with our expectation and with our view that the peso is 
already overvalued. 
Credit - Scope for further tightening 
In terms of the external markets, as the long term 
picture seems intact, market should continue to price a 
likely second mandate of Macri administration with a 
strong reform agenda and ascension in credit 
standings, and associated ratings upgrade to BB levels 
over the medium term, in our view. 
One-notch upgrade is priced in Argentina credit; 
potential for more if politics stay on track

While valuation looks tight vs. its current credit rating 
after its outperformance this year. there is still scope 
for spread to tighter further due to a). Market's 
perception of multiple notches credit ascension if 
politics stay on track; b). The flattening of spread / 
quality curve in EM credit markets under the 
constructive external backdrop with continued inflows; 
and c). Opportunities offered by EUR-denominated 
bonds, local law USD bonds, and select provincial 
bonds, even if one does not like the valuation on the 
NY law USD bonds. 
EUR bonds vs. USD bonds - Argentina is due to issue 
USD2.65bn more bonds denominated in EUR, CHF, or 
JPY in the coming weeks. In our view, Argentina 
should issue in EUR to boost the liquidity of the EUR 
bonds curve despite initially unfavorable pricing for the 
sovereign. Any supplies to that markets, if priced 
properly, would only help - not hurt - the performance 
of those bonds, in our view. On ft-hedged basis, the 
EUR bonds remain significantly cheap to their USD 
counterparts, 
especially 
the 
EUR 
Discounts in 
comparison with USD Discounts (at FX-hedged spread 
differential of 175bp). 
E.UR denominated bonds remain substantially cheap to 
IUSD counterparts, especially the EUR Discounts

The USD curve - On the back of recent outperformance 
of the Pars, we have taken profit in Pars vs. 5Y CDS 
and Pars vs. 46s despite that the Pars remain 
substantially cheap to the curve. But we, nevertheless, 
look to switch out of bullets to the Pars on any 
meaningful dip of the latter. 
While the Pars continue to offer good value, the bullet 
bond curve (10s30s) has flattened from recent peak; 
we retain curve flatteners 46s vs. 27s but only for any
