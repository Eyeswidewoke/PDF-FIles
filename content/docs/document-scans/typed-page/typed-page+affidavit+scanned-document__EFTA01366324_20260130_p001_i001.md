upon such exercise is registered or qualified under the securities laws of the state of the exercising holder, unless 
an exemption is available. Notwithstanding the above, if our common stock is at the time of any exercise of a 
warrant not listed on a national securities exchange such that it satisfies the definition of a "covered security" 
under Section 18(bXI) of the Securities Act, we may, at our option, require holders of public warrants who 
exercise their warrants to do so a "cashless basis" in accordance with Section 3(aX9) of the Securities Act and, in 
the event we so elect, we will not be required to file or maintain in effect a registration statement or register or 
qualify the shares under blue sky laws. In no event will we be required to net cash settle any warrant, or issue 
securities or other compensation in exchange for the warrants in the event that we arc unable to register or qualify 
the shares underlying the warrants under the Securities Act or applicable state securities laws. If the issuance of 
the shares upon exercise of the warrants is not so registered or qualified or exempt from registration or 
qualification, the holder of such warrant shall not be entitled to exercise such warrant and such warrant may have 
no value and expire worthless. In such event, holders who acquired their warrants as part of a purchase of units 
will have paid the full unit purchase price solely for the shares of common stock included in the units. If and 
when the warrants become redeemable by us, we may exercise our redemption right even if we arc unable to 
register or qualify the underlying shares of common stock for sale under all applicable state securities laws. 
The grant of registration rights to our initial stockholder and holders of our private placement warrants 
may make it more difficult to complete our initial business combination, and the future exercise of such 
rights may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. 
Pursuant to an agreement to be entered into concurrently with the issuance and sale of the securities in this 
offering, our initial stockholder and its permitted transferees can demand that we register the founder shares, 
holders of our private placement warrants and their permitted transferees can demand that we register the private 
placement warrants and the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the private placement warrants. We 
will bear the cost of registering these se unties. The registration and availability of such a significant number of 
securities for trading in the public market may have an adverse effect on the market price of our 
39 
common stock. In addition, thc existence of the registration rights may make our initial business combination 
more cosily or difficult to conclude. This is because the stockholders of the target business may increase the 
equity stake they seek in the combined entity or ask for more cash consideration to offset the negative impact on 
the market price of our common stock that is expected when the securities owned by our initial stockholder, 
holders of our private placement warrants or their respective permitted transferees arc registered. 
Because we are not limited to a particular industry or any specific target businesses with which to pursue 
our initial business combination, you will be unable to ascertain the merits or risks of any particular target 
business's operations. 
We will seek to complete a business combination with an operating company in one of a number of potential 
industries, including technology, media, financial services, industrials and consumer/retail, but may also pursue 
acquisition opportunities with other characteristics, except that we will not, under our amended and restated 
certificate of incorporation, be permitted to effectuate our business combination with another blank check 
company or similar company with nominal operations. Because we have not yet identified or approached any 
specific target business with respect to a business combination, there is no basis to evaluate the possible merits or 
risks of any particular target business's operations. results of operations, cast flows, liquidity, financial condition 
or prospects. To the extent we complete our business combination, we may be affected by numerous risks 
inherent in the business operations with which we combine. For example, if we combine with a financially 
unstable business or an entity lacking an established record of sales or earnings, we may be affected by the risks 
inherent in the business and operations of a financially unstable or a development stage entity. Although our 
officers, directors, director nominees and members of our sponsor will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a 
particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all of the significant risk 
factors or that we will have adequate time to complete due diligence. Furthermore, some of these risks may be 
outside of our control and leave us with no ability to control or reduce the chances that those risks will adversely 
impact a target business. We also cannot assure you that an investment in our units will ultimately prove to be 
more favorable to investors than a direct investment, if such opportunity were available, in a business combination 
target. Accordingly, any stockholders who choose to remain stockholders following the business combination 
could suffer a reduction in the value of their shares. Such stockholders arc unlikely to have a remedy for such 
reduction in value unless they are able to successfully claim that the reduction was due to the breach by our 
officers or directors of a duty of care or other fiduciary duty owed to them. or if they are able to suceesslully bring 
a private claim under securities laws that the tender offer materials or proxy statement relating to the business 
combination contained an actionable material misstatement or material omission. 
We may seek acquisition opportunities in industries or sectors outside the technology, media, financial 
services, industrials and consumer/retail sectors which may or may not he outside of our management's 
area of expertise.
