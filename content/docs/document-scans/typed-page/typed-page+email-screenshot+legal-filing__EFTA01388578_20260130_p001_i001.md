The limits of monetary policy 
.64 riTttl Ed,t,,r,j ?hoe, 2:ilf; 
For a multi asset investor, we would suggest focusing on the following four key 
points. 
First: be realistic about your returns expectations and how you can achieve them. 
Lowering returns expectations as part of a desire to better align asset allocation 
with investment objectives might make sense for some investors (such as those 
already approaching retirement). Depending on your personal circumstances, the 
lower expected returns from most financial assets may tempt you instead to some 
consumption opportunities. Keep in mind, after all, that part of the whole point of 
OE is to make you spend more in the here and now. But note also the ECB and other 
central banks' increasing focus on getting QE to work through revitalising the credit 
channel in economies: increased lending will support economies and help create 
investment opportunities too. For most investors, the main issue will remain on how 
to generate acceptable levels of returns with acceptable levels of risk. 
Second: remember that risk comes in many forms. 
As we have outlined above, current central bank policy will have a tendency to 
increase risk in part because lower yields on lower-risk assets can alter investor 
behavior. In search of higher yielding investment they are forced to buy riskier 
assets, both in the fixed income space and equities or alternatives. In this way. 
loose monetary policy can increase the risk of misallocation of capital and bubble 
formation in financial assets. This is true for fixed income as well as equities. The 
valuations side of the equation can come into particular focus as investors are 
willing to take more risk, even if earnings are not able to keep pace with valuations. 
As always, bear in mind, assuming greater risk is no assurance of greater returns. 
At the same time as investors are looking for higher returns, multi asset investors 
are also trying to establish what might be percieved current investment "safe-
havens". Effective safe-havens vary over time and between crises and no 
investment is without risk. Gold. for example, may have proved a good safe haven in 
some periods in the past, but has been a less effective one in recent years. In other 
words, the correlations between safe havens and risk assets are not stable and 
history does not always repeat itself. So, as noted above, some risks accompany 
holding Treasuries (or Bunds) in an interest rate up-cycle, they do not always lose 
their appeal. It is also worth remembering that "safe havens" may not be confined 
to those traditionally perceived as such (e.g. Treasuries, cash and, perhaps, gold). In 
the current environment, currencies might be seen as a key part of any safe-haven 
strategy. And, linked to the currency issues, some regions' equities may also offer 
temporary safe haven status. When considering risk arid safe-havens, it is also 
worth distinguishing between overall market risks and those which are country-
specific emerging markets provide a good example of this. 
Investors, of course, also need to look beyond seeking higher risk and safe havens 
and take an overall approach to their own risk profile. As noted above, accepting 
only as much risk as one has historically budgeted for is likely to result in returns 
below historical averages. For some people, a better solution might be to increase 
their risk budgets, especially if they want to take a longer-term perspective, but any 
increase in risk must be in line with your personal risk composure. Further, you may 
want to endeavor to limit the downside risk in your portfolio with an appropriate
