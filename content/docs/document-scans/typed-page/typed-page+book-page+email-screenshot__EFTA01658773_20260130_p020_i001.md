The New York Times (11/11, Fernandez, 18.61M) reports that Texas Attorney General Ken 
Paxton (R) is accused of intervening in an FBI case on behalf of "longtime friend" and real 
estate investor Nate Paul in "a newly released deposition in a court case." The Times says 
Paxton "has been the attack dog of Texas Republicans' aggressive conservative agenda, taking 
on high-profile legal battles that made him popular with the Trump Administration," but "the 
latest revelations...have put him in new political peril, and under new legal scrutiny" as 
"Republican allies have distanced themselves, and some have publicly questioned whether he 
should resign."

FBI, Spokane Police Probing Gonzaga University "Zoom-Bombing." 
KXLY-TV Spokane, WA (11/11, Sarles, 7K) reports from Spokane, Washington, "Spokane Police 
and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) are now investigating the `Zoom-bombing' of a 
Gonzaga University Black Student Union (BSU) virtual call." On Sunday, "students of the BSU 
held a Zoom call to talk about the election, when several people joined the call with offensive 
screen names and began yelling racial and homophobic slurs and sharing pornography on their 
screens. A joint letter from Gonzaga's leadership says their IT department were able to capture 
data of the Zoom-bombing, identifying IP addresses from the people who hijacked the call -
they found the sources of the IP addresses were both domestic and international. They also 
noted that other universities around the U.S. have also had similar Zoom-bombings." KXLY-TV 
adds, "According to the university, the Spokane Police Department's criminal investigation unit 
and the FBI are now involved in the investigation." 
Dark Web Illegal Markets Exploiting Pandemic To Sell Goods, Identities, Fake Drugs. 
Bloomberg (11/11, Mehrotra, 4.73M) reports that illegal markets on the dark web are 
profiteering off panic buying in response to the pandemic. An investigation by Bloomberg 
reveals that "in the first months of the pandemic, vendors mostly specialized in hard-to-find 
Covid commodities, including medical equipment and test kits." However, "by late summer, 
stolen digital identities were being sold specifically with the purpose of defrauding government 
programs meant to help small businesses and the unemployed." Now, "dark web profiteers have 
offered so-called vaccines for those unwilling to wait for final government approvals." All 
together, "almost $100 million worth of Covid-related goods have been listed for sale on the 
dark web, according to a forthcoming report by the CTI League, a coalition of cybersecurity 
researchers investigating the intersection of Covid-19 and the internet." 
TikTok's Parent Seeks More Time To Work Out Divestiture. 
The Wall Street Journal (11/11, McKinnon, Wells, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) reports 
TikTok and its Chinese parent company ByteDance Ltd. are asking the US Court of Appeals for 
the DC Circuit for more time to work out a divestiture for the video sharing app. The Journal 
says the petition is the latest legal challenge by TikTok in an effort to undermine the Trump 
Administration's effort to force a divestiture. 
The AP (11/11, O'Brien) says ByteDance "has until Thursday to sell off its U.S. operations 
under an executive order that Trump signed in August." In September, President Trump "gave 
his tentative blessing to a ByteDance proposal meant to resolve U.S. national security concerns 
by placing TikTok under the oversight of American companies Oracle and Walmart, each of 
which would also have a financial stake in the company. But TikTok said this week it's received 
`no clarity' from the U.S. government about whether its proposals have been accepted." 
On its website, CNN (11/11, Fung, 83.16M) says Trump's executive order imposing the 
Nov. 12 deadline "doesn't specify any penalties or consequences if the deadline is breached," 
which has "created fresh questions about the government's intentions toward TikTok."
