Nigeria has the highest rates of polio, with the north of the country the main source of polio infections. 
The country accounts for over half of global cases and is the only country with ongoing transmission of all 
three serotypes of the polio virus. Nigeria also has the highest rates of children missed in vaccination 
campaigns and the highest rate of parents refusing to vaccinate their children. Going back more than a 
decade, polio vaccination campaigns in Nigeria have suffered from targeted misinformation strategies 
and attacks by the terrorist group Boko Haram, weak social mobilization campaigns, and lack of 
commitment by some local leaders. Some strategies have also backfired. For example, the tactic of 
awarding higher salaries and bonuses to polio workers in order to encourage health workers to carry out 
vaccinations has not worked. Low-paid healthcare workers are offered extra cash for helping with the 
campaign, and as a result the primary healthcare system in Nigeria, which is very weak, is emptied out 
for days nearly every month. Additionally, it may not help that workers are paid according to how many 
children they reach, with it being reported some vaccinators refuse to accept cards showing children 
have already been vaccinated. 
The percentage of Nigeria's budget spent on social mobilization is less than 5%, significantly smaller than 
that spent on social mobilization in Pakistan. It is reported that even basic community efforts, such as 
polio posters and banners, are conspicuous in their absence. This is a point of concern as Nigeria has the 
highest non-compliance (refusal) rates of any country where polio persists. Refusal to take medicine 
stems from a fear of Westerners and Western medicine, as there is the perception in some communities 
the vaccination campaign is a Western plot to kill Muslim Africans or to make Muslim children sterile. 
Pakistan 
A new polio outbreak has occurred recently in North Waziristan, Pakistan, near the frontier with 
Afghanistan. It is in an area where a warlord banned polio vaccinations after it was disclosed that the 
C.I.A. had staged a hepatitis vaccination campaign in its hunt for Osama bin Laden. The warlord, Hafiz Gul 
Bahadur, has banned all efforts until American drone strikes end. This is a significant setback to the 
Pakistan campaign, which has persistently continued its efforts despite the killing of 9 vaccinators in 
December 2012, which has been attributed to the Taliban. 
Afghanistan 
Afghanistan's quest to eradicate polio is inextricably linked to that of neighboring Pakistan. Genetic 
analysis shows clear chains of transmission between the two countries. There are three chains of polio 
transmission in Afghanistan: two are from Pakistan, and the third is indigenous to Afghanistan, making 
the country endemic in its own right. Due to this closely intertwined relationship, future efforts to 
eradicate polio will likely require Pakistani and Afghani vaccination teams on either side of the border to 
coordinate strategy so that no child goes missing in between. As of now, vaccination coverage data 
suggest little improvement in the number of children reached with vaccination and there are indications 
that coverage levels in some districts are falling. 
Inaccessibility is a challenge in implementing vaccination campaigns; however, the main challenge anti-
polio initiatives face in the country are basic leadership and management problems that are not properly 
addressed. In May 2012 it was reported that an Inter-Ministerial Task Force had been formed and would 
direct a whole-of-government approach to polio eradication. Five months later, this Task Force had yet to 
meet. At the same time, the President's launch of Afghanistan's Emergency Action Plan is welcome, but 
the slow pace of implementation is concerning. Additionally, District EPI Management Teams (DEMTs) 
need further strengthening and NGOs implementing the Basic Package of Health Services need to be 
held accountable for achieving higher coverage rates of routine immunisation, including polio.
