participating, there were limited numbers of patients available 
for enrolment. A multisite study would be beneficial to increase 
the population size and examine reproducibility of results 
across different centers. 
Future studies with larger samples of babies born to English-
speaking parents—no less infants from other cultures66•67—are 
needed to corroborate our findings and to ascertain whether 
different types of music. other auditory stimuli, or other types 
of ecologically and ethnologically relevant stimuli have more 
or less of an effect on physiological and behavioral indices of 
pain and stress. It is possible that live music may have an even 
greater effect on physiological recovery from heel stick, as a 
previous study demonstrated a decrease in HR in infants at 
rest after stimulation with live music, but not with recorded 
music or no music." 
Neural mechanisms mediating the effects of controlled audi-
tory stimulation with music on HR and other aspects of auto-
nomic function have not been fully elucidated. The results of 
experiments with chicks and rats indicate they are not specific 
to humans. For example, Sutoo and Akiyama69 played the Ada-
gio by Mozart (IC 205) repeatedly to spontaneously hypertensive 
rats for 2 hours on 3 consecutive nights at 65 to 75 dB SPL. The 
rats' blood pressure as well as their behavioral activity decreased 
during the music, and the effect persisted for about 30 minutes 
after the music stopped. Compared to a control group that did not 
receive music stimulation, treated rats exhibited increased dopa-
mine levels in the neostriatum. Moreover, pretreatment with a 
D2 receptor antagonist, but not a DI receptor antagonist, blocked 
the blood pressure response. These results indicate that music 
induced the activation of D2 receptors in the neostriatum, which 
in turn, decreased sympathetic tone. 
We restricted the recruitment of participants to premature 
infants who were free of brain disease and serious illness in 
order to minimize any risks from auditory stimulation. No com-
plications were observed. Extending the research to include 
infants who are more compromised is feasible. In general, the 
younger the neonate at birth, the greater the risk of illness, the 
greater the number of procedures she/he undergoes, and conse-
quently, the greater the risk of recurrent pain and stress?"' Fur-
ther study is needed to determine the age groups and medical 
conditions of infant populations that benefit from controlled 
auditory stimulation. 
Previous Studies 
In general, clinical research on the potential benefits of audi-
tory stimulation with music in premature infants has looked 
at the endpoints indexing effects of pervasive stress (eg, cardi-
opulmonary events and weight gain). Relatively little work has 
focused on specific physiological and behavioral responses to 
sudden, noxious stimuli, such as those delivered during medi-
cal procedures.79 Recordings of the mother talking soothingly 
to her baby, digitally filtered to simulate what they would 
sound like in the womb, failed to attenuate physiological and 
behavioral responses to heel stick in one study.71 Whipple 
found decreased behavioral, but not physiological, indices of 
pain and stress following heel stick using a music-reinforced, 
nonnutritive sucking paradigm that employed sung lullabies."2
Butt and Kisilevskyss investigated the effects of music on 
physiological and behavioral responses to the heel-stick proce-
dure using a randomized-controlled, single-crossover design 
with 14 premature infants in levels I. II, and III nurseries. 
Infants were exposed to both a control and a music condition 
in 2 separate heel sticks (time lapse between heel sticks 
unknown). The music stimuli was either an instrumental ver-
sion of Brahms's Lullaby (Op. 49, No. 4) performed on piano 
or a vocal version of the same excerpt, performed a capella. 
The absolute sound intensity, 76 dBA on average, was similar 
to ours, but the relative stimulus intensity was only about 4 dB 
(potentially lower for infants receiving mechanical support). 
compared to about 10 dB in our study. Consequently, the soft-
est portions of the music may have not been audible, thereby 
rendering music discontinuous. The duration range of heel-
stick procedure in their study overlapped with ours, and similar 
to our study, various aspects of developmentally sensitive care 
were "neither consistent nor universal." Setting aside reserva-
tions about the use of a parametric statistic and multiple post 
hoc analyses with multiple factors in a small, clinically diverse 
patient population. and acknowledging differences in statistical 
and other methods, we note results are paralleling those of this 
study. First, a 3-way ANOVA carried out on data collected dur-
ing the heel-stick procedure found an increase in FIR, a 
decrease in O2-sat, an increase in behavioral arousal score, and 
an increase in the facial pain expression score over time for all 
babies. Second, a 3-way ANOVA comparing data collected 
during the last half of the 10-minute postprocedure recovery 
period found smaller changes in HR and facial expression 
scores when the infants were played music. No clearcut differ-
ences in the efficacy of instrumental vs a capella music were 
discernable. 
Bo and Callaghan's investigated the effects of music, a paci-
fier, or both on physiological and behavioral responses during 
and after the heel-stick procedure in 27 Chinese pre- and full-
term neonates. Their crossover design required infants to have 
a minimum of 4 heel sticks and the order of the 3 treatment con-
ditions and no-treatment condition was pseudurandomized. 
The duration of the heel sticks, time lag between heel sticks, 
and characteristics of the developmentally sensitive care were 
not provided. The authors characterized the music stimuli as 
"soothing," but the specific music used, its intensity, the inten-
sity of ambient room noise, and the amount of daily exposure to 
music were not specified. One-way and multivariate ANOVAs, 
the designs of which were not detailed, were reported to show 
the significant effects of treatment on HR. blood oxygenation. 
and Neonatal Infant Pain Scale (NIPS) scores. A Scheffe test 
analyzing all possible comparisons of the different treatment 
conditions at each data collection time showed that treatment 
with music was associated with the lowest HR, highest oxyge-
nation, and lowest NIPS scores at multiple time points during 
and after treatment. At other times, treatment with music plus 
a pacifier was associated with these minima and maxima, but 
at no time did treatment with a pacifier alone produce this
