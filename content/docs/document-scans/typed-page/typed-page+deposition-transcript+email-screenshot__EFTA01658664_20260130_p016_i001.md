OTHER FBI NEWS 
Rubio: FBI Was Warned By Intelligence Community Not To Rely On Steele Dossier. 
The Washington Examiner (9/20, Dunleavy, 448K) reports Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) "said every 
intelligence agency warned the FBI not to rely on the 'ridiculous things' in British ex-spy 
Christopher Steele's discredited dossier." Rubio "criticized the bureau during an appearance on 
Sunday Morning Futures on Fox News, noting that the intelligence community warned the FBI 
the dossier might contain Russian disinformation." Rubio "told the show's host, Fox Business 
anchor Maria Bartiromo, that he believes the actions taken by some in the FBI were criminal, 
and that there was likely more wrongdoing that has not yet been made public." 
Rubio, on Fox News Sunday Morning FuturesVI (9/20, 1.67M), said, "Our Russia report 
makes it very clear that the FBI behaved very poorly with the things they did in the 2016 and 
the aftermath of that election. We pointed out those things. For example, the reliance on the 
dossier that the intelligence community, including the CIA, told the FBI not to use those 
documents because they weren't reliable. Every single one of the intelligence agencies separate 
from the FBI said that the dossier was not the kind of document they should be relying on, we 
shouldn't even be talking about it, because it could very well be something the Russians 
completely made up and put out there and so the information in order to create all sorts of 
havoc. The implications here are frightening and that is you could go and hire some former spy, 
make up stories, put it in this document, and get someone in the US government to put the 
official seal of approval on it." 
Jordan: Comey Testimony "Key" To Answering Questions About Russia Probe. 
The Washington Examiner (9/20, Soellner, 448K) reports, "Former FBI Director Jim Comey is 'at 
the center' of the so-called Russiagate controversy," according to Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH). 
During an interview on Fox News Sunday Morning FuturesVi , Jordan "talked about his 
expectations for Comey's appearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee scheduled for 
Sept. 30." He said, "I think Jim Comey's been at the center of all this. He's in every important 
meeting. He was the guy who went from one administration to the other. He's the one who 
designed the cover-up. He's the one who pushed when leaked his memos to get Bob Mueller, 
the special counsel appointed, which, in fact, happened. The very people on that team wiped 
their phones, as you just indicated. So, Comey is the key to all this. I'm glad he's coming in. 
I'm sure he's going to get some tough questions." 
Tropical Storm Beta Headed Toward Texas And Louisiana. 
The CBS Weekend NewsVi (9/20, story 6, 0:10, Garrett, 875K) reported, "Tropical Storm Beta 
is slowly making its way towards Texas and Louisiana." ABC World News TonightVi 's (9/20, 
story 6, 0:40, Llamas, 5.41M) Rob Marciano reported that it "should make landfall tomorrow 
afternoon somewhere around Victoria." ABC World News TonightVi 's (9/20, story 5, 1:20, 
Llamas, 5.41M) Elwyn Lopez reported "the slow-moving storm" is "set to hit parts of Texas and 
Louisiana with 60-mile-per-hour winds and up to 15 inches of rain." Lopez added, "The main 
concern is flash flooding inland." 
The AP (9/20, Lozano) reports Beta was "no longer expected to reach hurricane intensity, 
the National Weather Service said Sunday." Forecasters said the storm was "not expected to 
bring the same amount of rainfall that Texas experienced during either Hurricane Harvey in 
2017 or Tropical Storm Imelda last year." 
USA Today (9/20, Bacon, Falcon, 10.31M) reports that Beta would be "the ninth system to 
make landfall in the United States this season, tying a record set more than 100 years ago."
