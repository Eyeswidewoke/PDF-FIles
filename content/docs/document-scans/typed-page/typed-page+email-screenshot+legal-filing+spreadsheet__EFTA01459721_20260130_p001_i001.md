Focus Europe: Dark clouds, no storm yet 
Italy was the main disappointment relative to expectations in the January PMI 
print. The 2.2 point decline in the composite PMI was the sharpest monthly fall 
since August 2014. Both services (53.6 vs 55.3 Dec, 54.2 exp) and 
manufacturing (53.2 vs 55.6 Dec, 54.9 exp.) saw steep declines. However, we 
must note that the decline comes after an unexpected rise to a new post-201 1 
high in December. 
At the 53.8 January level the Italian composite PMI is still consistent with 
+0.3% qoq growth, just below our +0.4% qoq Q1 call. Credit conditions in 
particular continue to be supportive of ongoing above-trend growth in Italy in 
2016 but we do expect growth to slow as we move into 2017 given this and 
the lower oil price are likely to become less strong tailwinds in the medium-
term 
Spain saw a contrasting performance across sectors. The composite PMI was 
essentially unchanged on the month (55.3 vs 55.2 Dec) but this was comprised 
of a 0.5 point monthly decline in the services to 54.6 (exp 54.4) and a strong 
2.4 point rise to 55.4 in the manufacturing index. These are a 13-month low 
and an 8-month high respectively. One month's worth of opposite moves is 
too little on which to draw firm conclusions but it does appear that the 
outperformance of the services sector thanks to a very strong domestic 
recovery is coming to an end (Figure 6). 
We expect a normalization of Spanish GDP growth in 2016 from the very 
impressive +0.9% qoq seen on average during 2015. The largest reasons for 
this are the credit dynamics. With the economy returning to positive credit 
growth, the credit impulse (yoy change in credit flows) is bound to slow. 
Indeed, in O4 2015 it fell to 3pp of GDP, around half the level seen on average 
in the previous four quarters. The uncertain political situation following the 
December election could also weigh'. The January level of the PMI is just 
below our expected +0.6% qoq Q1 GDP growth in Spain, although it should be 
noted that the PMIs have underestimated the pace of GDP growth by about 
0.2pp in recent quarters (including with the +0.8% qoq preliminary O4 
estimate) so the risk could in fact be marginally to the upside of our 
expectation. 
%Attila the improvement of banks' balance sheets has helped to rapidly slow the pace of deleveragmg 
over 2014-16. it is unlkely that such a pace of improving credit growth can continue into positive territory 
which would require balks to increase their lending land biance sheets) and potentially lead to a return of 
prwate debt ifilbaNICeS that were a leading cause of theories in Span.
