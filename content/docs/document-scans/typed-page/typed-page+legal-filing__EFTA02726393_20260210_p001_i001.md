Inobk data traffic 6 doubkig annually. Future predictions are for total mobk data 
capacty demand of anywhere between 70 and 50 Imes within 5 years. The greatest 
demand both today aid in the future s concentrated in the dense urban areas. 
Whle operators have gust about been able to keep up so far (some less so than 
others), there is wide recogntbn that somethng radc.a we have to change to delver 
the capacty requitd. 
And is not gust about more capacity per se, it's tout the overal speed and (warty of 
service each customer percewes. 
Customers want to use the hgher speeds possble wth 3.5G and 16 for refiabk use of video and other hgh speed 
services. These requre robust, fad data conrectiety everywhere we go - whether outside on the street, Ind* our offices, 
shops or transport hubs. 
The capacty problem s most noticeably n the dense urban areas rather than sparsely populated rurai areas, and is only gong to 
get worse. Akhough the total network capacty might grow SOx overal, some peak trafft traffic hotspots are forecast to need 
500x or even 1000x n extreme cases.

The laws of physics set some constraints 
The laws of physics provde for three man ways to ',crease total throughput: 
1. Add extra spectrum. If avalatile, a staple capacty upgrade at hgh traffic basedations, by addng some extra cards, may 
be al that's required. Different spectrum bands may als.o need new antenna on the mast and/or new 
handsetsfsmartphones that can use the different frequencies. New spectrum 6 usuaty very linked, expensive and difIcuk 
to xquke. 
2. Improved spectral effklency. New versions of 3G, such as MSFA, encode the radio signal wth higher orders of 
modulation to carry more Delft. The new 'IG LTE standard uses a myriad of the latest techniques to carry the maximum 
possble throughput. However, these hgher rates are only achievable n deal conditions with laded hterference and when 
very close to the transmtter. Further rnprovements are possible but may requrd additional antenna and coud be qute 
expensive. 
3. Spectrum reuse through smal seas. Most of the vast growth h celutar traffic capacty has in the past been achieved by 
increasing the number of cells and thls optbn east/ offers the most promise. Thousands of smal metrocek would be 
instakd n each oty, the maximum number imited by commercial viability rather than techncar barriers. 
A 3GPP workguip considered these options coder this vex and found that an Increase of up to 1000 fob Is possble (somethng 
hat might be needed rs the most demandhg urban bcatons) through a combnatbn of three drnensons, shown bebw both 
numercay and graphialy:
