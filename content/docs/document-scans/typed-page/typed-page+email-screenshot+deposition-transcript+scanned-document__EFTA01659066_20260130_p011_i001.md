US Agencies Coordinating Efforts To Thwart Russian Election Meddling. 
The Washington Post (10/21, Nakashima, Timberg, 14.2M) says "the U.S. government is 
mounting a major effort to prevent a repeat of 2016 - when federal agencies were slow to 
address Russia's attempts to manipulate the presidential election - and is taking a range of 
actions despite the disinterest of President Trump, who questions intelligence that the Kremlin 
is intent on undermining American democracy." According to the Post, "Top security agencies 
are coordinating actions to thwart foreign hackers, prevent Russia-linked individuals from 
entering the United States and freeze any of their assets subject to U.S. jurisdiction. They are 
also passing intelligence to social media firms, and helping state and local election officials 
shore up their defenses." FBI, CISA, and ODNI have "briefed candidates, parties and the 
congressional intelligence committees on foreign threats to the election and their systems," and 
the "last briefings for the campaigns are expected this week." Meanwhile, "CyberCom and the 
NSA are undertaking broader and more sophisticated actions, including against the Russian 
military spy agency, the GRU, and a botnet run by Russian-speaking criminals, U.S. officials 
said."

said the Nov. 3 election had become a common lure to trick users into visiting online stores or 
websites laden with pay-per-view adverts." Fraudsters are "posting about U.S. politics and the 
upcoming presidential election to build fake audiences, maximise clicks and make money 
online." On Wednesday, Nathaniel Gleicher, head of head of cybersecurity policy for Facebook, 
said, "If you are a financially motivated actor who's trying to make money based on clicks, you 
are going to use whatever content is going to get you eyeballs." Gleicher added Facebook wants 
"people to be aware of the full range of deception that is happening out there." 
Senate Intelligence Committee Warns Of Threats To Election Systems. 
The Hill (10/21, Budryk, 2.98M) reports, "Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Marco Rubio 
(R-Fla.) and Vice Chairman Mark Warner (D-Va.) warned in a joint statement Wednesday that 
foreign actors may seek to attack U.S. election infrastructure or create the impression they 
have." The Senators wrote, "Our adversaries abroad seek to sow chaos and undermine voters' 
belief in our democratic institutions, including the election systems and infrastructure that we 
rely on to record and properly report expressions of the voters' will." Rubio and Warner added, 
"They may seek to target those systems, or simply leave the impression that they have altered 
or manipulated those systems, in order to undermine their credibility and our confidence in 
them." 
Trump Signs Bill Making It A Federal Crime To Hack Voting Systems. 
The Hill (10/21, 2.98M) reports that on Tuesday, President Trump signed the Defending the 
Integrity of Voting Systems Act, which makes it a "federal crime to attempt to hack federal 
voting systems." The legislation was approved by the Senate last year and the House last 
month. The Act empowers DOJ "to pursue charges against anyone who attempts to hack a 
voting system under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, commonly used by the agency to 
pursue charges against malicious hackers." The original bill was the "result of a 2018 report 
compiled by the DOJ's Cyber Digital Task Force, which evaluated ways the federal government
