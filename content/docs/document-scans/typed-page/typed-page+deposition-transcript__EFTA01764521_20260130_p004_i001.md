October 23, 2012 -- =N Monday, in their final debate, Mitt Romney denounced President Obama for=creating "tension" 
and "turmoil" with Israel and chided him for ha=ing "skipped Israel" during his travels in the Middle East. Throughout 
the campaign, Mr. Romney has repeatedly <http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0912/80794.html> accused 
<http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/08/30/transc=ipt-mitt-romney-speech-at-rnc/> Mr. Obama of having "thrown 
allies like Israel under the bus.=94 But history tells a different story. Indeed, whenever the United States=has put 
serious, sustained pressure on Israel's leaders — from the 195=s on — it has come from Republican presidents, not 
Democratic ones. This was particularly true under Mr. Obama's predec=ssor, George W. Bush. Just one week before the 
Iraq war began in March 
Mr. Bush was still struggling to form a broad international coalition to=oust Saddam 
Hussein. Unlike in the 1991 Persian Gulf war, Russia, a permanent member of the United Nations Se=urity Council, 
decided to opt out, meaning that the United Nations could n=t provide formal legitimacy for a war against Mr. Hussein. 
Britain was alm=st alone in aligning itself with America, and Prime Minister Tony Blair's support was deemed crucial in 
W=shington. Just as the British Parliament was about to approve the joint ve=ture, a group of Mr. Blair's Labour Party 
colleagues threatened to revol=, demanding Israeli concessions to the Palestinians in exchange for their support for the 
Iraq invasion. This=demand could have scuttled the war effort, and there was only one way that=British support could 
be maintained: Mr. Bush would have to dedare that t=e "road map" for Middle East peace, a proposal drafted early in 
his administration, was the formal policy of t=e United States. Israel's prime minister at the time, Ariel Sharon, had =een 
vehemently opposed to the road map, which contained several "red lin=s" that he refused to accept, including a 
stipulation <http://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/01/w=rld/mideast-peace-proposal-proposal-for-final-comprehensive-
settlement-mid=le-east.htmPpagewanted=all&src=pm> that the future status of Jerusalem would be determined b= "a 
negotiated resolution" taking into account "the political and re=igious concerns of both sides." This wording implied a 
possible end to l=rael's sovereignty over all of Jerusalem, which has been under Israeli control since 1967. On March 13, 
2003, senior=lsraeli officials were summarily informed that the United States would pub=icly adopt the draft road map 
as its policy. Washington made it dear to u= that on the eve of a war, Israel was expected to refrain from criticizing the 
American policy and also to e=sure that its sympathizers got the message. The United States insisted tha= the road map 
be approved without any changes, saying Israel's concerns =ould be addressed later <http://artides.cnn.com/2003-=5-
25/world/israellcabinet_l_palestinian-state-mideast-quartet-road-map?_s=3DPM:WORLD> . At a long and tense 
cabinet debate I attended in May 2=03, Mr. Sharon reluctantly asked his ministers to accept Washington's de=and. 
Benjamin Netanyahu, then the finance minister, disagreed, and he abst=ined during the vote on the cabinet resolution, 
which eventually passed. From that point on, the road map, inc=uding the language on Jerusalem, became the policy 
bible for America, Russ=a, the European Union and the United Nations. Not only was Israel strong-a=med by a 
Republican president, but it was also compelled to simply acquiesce and swallow the bitterest of=pills. Three years later, 
the Bush administration again pressured Israel i=to supporting a policy that ran counter to its interests. In early 2006, 
t=e terrorist group Hamas ran candidates in the Palestinian legislative elections. Israel had been adamant that no =eader 
could campaign with a gun in his belt; the Palestinian party Fatah o=posed Hamas's participation, too. But the White 
House would have none of=this; it pushed Fatah to allow Hamas candidates to run, and pressured Israel into allowing 
voting for Hamas —=even in parts of East Jerusalem. After Hamas won a dear majority, Washing=on sought to train 
Fatah forces to crush it militarily in the Gaza Strip. =ut Hamas pre-empted this scheme by taking control of Gaza in 2007, 
and the Palestinians have been ideological=y and territorially divided ever since. 
Despite the Republic=n Party's shrill campaign rhetoric on Israel, no Democratic president ha= ever strong-armed Israel 
on any key national security issue. In the 1956 =uez Crisis, it was a Republican, Dwight D. Eisenhower, who joined the 
Soviet Union in forcing Israel's founding =ather, David Ben-Gurion, to withdraw from the Sinai Peninsula after a join= 
Israeli-British-French attack on Egypt. 
In 1991, when Iraqi =cud missiles rained down on Tel Aviv, the administration of the first Pres-dent Bush urged Israel 
not to strike back so as to preserve the coalition =f Arab states fighting Iraq. Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir resisted his 
security chiefs' recommendation to =etaliate and bowed to American demands as his citizens reached for their g=s 
masks. After the war, Mr. Shamir agreed to go to Madrid for a Middle Eas= peace conference set up by Secretary of 
State James A. Baker III. Fearful that Mr. Shamir would be intransigent=at the negotiating table, the White House 
pressured him by withholding $10 billion <http://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/07=world/israel-ignoring-bush-presses-
for-loan-guarantees.html> in loan guarantees to Israel, causing us seriou= economic problems. The eventual result was
