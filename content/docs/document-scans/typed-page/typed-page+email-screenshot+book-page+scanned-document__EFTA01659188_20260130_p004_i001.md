LEADING THE NEWS 
Suspect: Alaska Raid Seeking Laptop Stolen During Capitol Riot Case Of Mistaken 
Identity. 
The AP (5/5) reports on the recent raid of the home of Marylyn Hueper of Homer, Alaska, 
during which FBI agents reportedly said they were looking for a laptop stolen from House 
Speaker Nancy Pelosi during the Capitol insurrection. The AP says that "even though Hueper 
looks strikingly similar to the thief," the raid could be based on mistake identity. "The Justice 
Department's massive prosecution" of participants in the attack "has not been without its 
problems. ... And as Republicans are increasingly seeking to minimize the insurrection and play 
down the horror of the day, any missteps by federal prosecutors could be used in that effort to 
discredit what actually happened." 
KTUU-TV Anchorage, AK (5/5) reports, "Newly unsealed court records show why Joint 
Terrorism Task Force investigators and a judge believed there was probable cause to search the 
premises of Paul and Marilyn Hueper in Homer in late April." While they attended the "Jan. 6 
rally at the nation's Capitol," the couple "have said they did nothing wrong." The couple says 
"the FBI mistook Marilyn Hueper for a woman who'd entered the Capitol that day, and that 
during the search, agents said they were looking for Nancy Pelosi's laptop."

Secret Service Director To Testify Before House For First Time Since Capitol 
Insurrection. 
CNN (5/5, Wild, 89.21M) reports Secret Service Director James Murray is scheduled to testify 
before the House Appropriations Committee's Homeland Security Subcommittee Thursday, "the 
first time the agency is appearing in an open hearing since the January 6 riot, during which 
agents swiftly moved then-Vice President Mike Pence to an unknown location." Murray's 
prepared remarks "make only brief mention of the events of January 6, but he does note that 
the agency has made some operational adjustments because of civil unrest and the rise in 
domestic violent extremism." The remarks say, "The Secret Service has reviewed its operational 
security posture over the past 10 months due to the increase in civil unrest and domestic 
violent extremism, as well as our open source intelligence capabilities given the proliferation of 
social media platforms." 
Grandmother's Tip Helps FBI Identify Capitol Insurgent. 
The New Jersey Star-Ledger (5/5, 1.47M) reports in January one grandmother told another 
"that her son was actually one of the hundreds who stormed" the US Capitol. "By Jan. 17, the 
other grandmother had told one of her grandchildren about what she had learned and the 
grandchild soon informed the FBI that Robert Petrosh Jr., of Mays Landing, was among" the
