6. 
Liability 
A. Liability for Unauthorized Use. 
i. 
Tell us AT ONCE if you believe your User ID or Password has become compromised, or if someone has 
transferred or may transfer money from your Account without your permission. Telephoning is the best 
way of keeping your possible losses down. You could lose all the money in your Account(s) (plus your 
maximum overdraft line of credit, if any). If you believe your User ID or Password has been compromised, 
or that someone has transferred money or may transfer money from your Account(s) without your 
permission, call: 1-866-362-4796 during regular business hours, or write: Deutsche Bank, Banking Service 
Team, 345 Park Avenue, Lexington Level Mail Stop NYC20-0108, New York, NY 10154. 
ii. 
For consumers: If you believe an electronic funds transfer (as defined in the Electronic Funds Transfer Act 
and Regulation E of the Federal Reserve Board) shown on your statement was not authorized by you, 
contact us immediately. If you do not notify us of an unauthorized electronic funds transfer within 60 
calendar days after the paper or electronic monthly statement was made available to you, and we could 
have prevented a loss if you had told us in time, you may not recover any money lost after the 60 days. 
If there are extenuating circumstances such as a long trip or hospital stay which kept you from telling 
us, these time periods may be extended. 
iii. 
For consumers only: If you tell us that your User ID or Password has been compromised within two 
Business Days after you learn of the loss or theft, you can lose no more than $50.00 if someone used 
your Password to access your Account and initiate electronic funds transfers without your permission. 
If you do not tell us within two Business Days after you learn of the loss or theft and we could have 
prevented the unauthorized use if you had told us, you are responsible for all unauthorized electronic 
funds transfers, but your maximum liability for any such transfers is $500.00. 
iv. Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, we will not be liable or have any responsibility of any 
kind for any loss or damage incurred by you as a result, directly or indirectly, of any unauthorized person 
gaining access to, or otherwise making use of, the Internet Banking Services. 
v. 
Upon your request, we may use Security Codes as a security procedure to prevent unauthorized funds 
transfers or other payments (collectively, requests for funds transfers, ACH entries, transfers between 
accounts, bill payment, other payment orders or other communications will be referred to as a "Payment 
Order" in this Agreement). You acknowledge that you have been offered alternative security procedures 
and have chosen the Internet Banking Services and these procedures after consideration of the risks of 
loss faced by you due to the possibility of an unauthorized transaction occurring. We may process any 
Payment Order we receive in your name and you will be responsible for it if it was initiated using one of 
your Security Codes. If a Payment Order issued to us in your name as sender is verified as authentic using 
these security procedures, the Payment Order will be effective as your Payment Order whether or not 
authorized. This means that you will be deemed to have given the Payment Order, and you will be 
obligated on it (including to pay us the amount), even if it was not authorized by you. Each time you 
send a Payment Order through the Internet Banking Services, you warrant that the Security Codes are 
a commercially reasonable method to detect an unauthorized transaction, based on the circumstances 
involved (e.g., the size, type, and frequency of your transfers, as well as your internal controls). If at 
any time the Security Codes ceases to be a commercially reasonable method to detect unauthorized 
transactions (such as by a change in your usage patterns or other circumstances), you agree to inform 
us immediately. 
vi. You agree that you are responsible for and bound by any Payment Order that is received by us in your 
name if it was authorized by you, whether or not we used the security procedures to verify authenticity 
or could have prevented a loss to you by using the security procedures to verify the authenticity of the 
Payment Order. You agree that we will not be responsible for verifying whether a Payment Order or 
other communication is originated by an authorized person other than through the verification process 
contained in these security procedures. Thus, when an employee is added or deleted as an authorized 
person on the system, the Bank will treat that person as "authorized" if the security procedures are 
followed, without verifying that employee with you or otherwise investigating whether the employee is 
exercising authority granted by you or consistent with any internal limitations on activity established by 
you for that employee. Among other things, this means that you will be solely liable for any losses or 
damages resulting from your breach of this Agreement or to which your negligence contributed, or which 
resulted from unauthorized, fraudulent or dishonest acts by your current and/or former authorized agents 
(including instances where an authorized agent acted to your detriment). 
vii. You are responsible for controlling access to the Internet Banking Services and for any limitations placed 
by you on the Internet Banking Services that an authorized person may utilize. The fact that we are, or 
may be aware of, or could have discovered, any limitation on access to an Internet banking Service 
does not make us obligated to enforce or attempt to enforce any limitation. You understand that each 
authorized person may utilize the Internet banking Services without regard to any restrictions otherwise 
applicable to an Account.
