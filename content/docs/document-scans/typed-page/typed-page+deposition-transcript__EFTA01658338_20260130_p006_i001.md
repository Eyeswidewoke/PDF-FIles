Department of Justice spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said on Fox News' Hannity (7/28, 535K), 
"I think at the end of the day, this is really a lost opportunity for the American people. There 
are many Americans who want to know more about why the Attorney General has made certain 
decisions that he's made and taken some of the actions that he's taken, and the Attorney 
General was prepared to answer those questions today. He's been preparing for weeks. But 
instead, the Democrats...would ask him questions and then they would refuse to let him answer 
those questions. The only conclusion that I can draw at least from that is perhaps maybe they 
realize there is no there, there. There are no buried bodies. There really aren't any scandals like 
the ones that the media has been drumming u[ for some time." 
In an editorial, USA Today (7/28, 10.31M) calls the federal government's approach to the 
protests "corrosive to democracy and contemptuous of conservative principles," and concludes 
"the American people can spot a ploy to change the subject from the ravages of COVID-19 and 
the Trump administration's horrible job in combating it." USA Today (7/28, 10.31M) runs its 
editorial side by side with Barr's opening statement to the Committee. 
Former DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff, meanwhile, writes in the New York Times (7/28, 
18.61M) that "the Trump administration's deliberate decision to intervene in the Portland 
protests with a heavy hand, unconventional means and inflammatory political rhetoric has 
contributed to growing public distrust - particularly of the Department of Homeland Security," 
whose "critics...are now rightly worried that its law enforcement agents might be increasingly 
deployed by...Trump to score political points, or even interfere with the November election." 
McClatchy (7/28, Wilner, Nozicka, 19K), the Wall Street Journal (7/28, Al, Gurman, 
Subscription Publication, 7.57M) and Daily Caller (7/28, Kruta, 716K), among other news 
outlets, have more on Barr's testimony. 
Barr Defends Decision To Drop Flynn Prosecution. The Hill (7/28, Beavers, Neidig, 
2.98M) reports that Barr "defended the stunning move" by the DOJ to drop charges against 
Michael Flynn. Barr "said that the FBI investigation that led to Flynn's questioning had been 
plagued with problems and that he no longer believed that the prosecution was supported by 
the facts." 
Meanwhile, the Austin (TX) American Statesman (7/28, Recio, Subscription Publication, 
343K) reports that Barr "disclosed Tuesday that he has directed John Bash, the U.S. attorney 
for the Western District of Texas, to investigate the 'unmasking" of Flynn. The "new inquiry, 
which is on top of another one ordered earlier this year by Barr to examine the FBI's Trump 
campaign-Russia surveillance, marks an escalation of the Trump administration's attacks on 
federal officials and the Obama administration in advance of the presidential election." 
CNN (7/28, Shortell, Herb, 83.16M) reports that that Barr also sparred with Rep. Hank 
Johnson (D) over the sentencing of Roger Stone "as Johnson repeatedly refused to let Barr 
respond while the Georgia Democrat recounted the episode." 
More broadly, CNBC (7/28, Breuninger, Macias, 3.62M) says on its website that Barr 
"offered a full-throated defense of his much-criticized conduct in the federal probe of Russian 
election interference." CNBC also reports that Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH), the committee's ranking 
member, "launched into his opening statement by decrying the Russia probe as a coordinated 
effort by Democrats to undermine Trump." Jordan said to Barr, "Spying. That one word, that's 
why they're after you." 
A Wall Street Journal (7/28, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) editorial lauds the 
investigation and argues that Americans deserve a full accounting of the FBI and Justice 
Department's intervention in the 2016 election. 
Barr Doesn't Rule Out Release Of Durham Report During Election. Politico (7/28, 
Gerstein, 4.29M) reports that a "highly anticipated forthcoming report from U.S. Attorney John 
Durham on the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation won't trigger a Justice Department 
policy against interference in the 2020 presidential race, so the review could be released in the 
weeks leading up to the November election," Barr said Tuesday. Barr said, "I will be very
