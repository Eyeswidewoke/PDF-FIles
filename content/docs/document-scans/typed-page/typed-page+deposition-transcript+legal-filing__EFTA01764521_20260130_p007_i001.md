=n Blind Oracles, his study of the role of intellectuals in formulating and=implementing U.S. foreign 
policy during the Cold War, historian Bruce Kukl=ck equated these scholars with the "primitive shaman" who performs 
"feats of ventriloquy." 
We tend to celebrate=foreign-policy intellectuals as thinkers who try to transform grand ideas =nto actual policies. In 
reality, their function has usually been to offer =embers of the foreign-policy establishment rationalizations—in the form 
of "grand strategies" and "doctrines,=94 or the occasional magazine article or op-ed—for doing what they were =oing to 
do anyway. Not unlike marketing experts, successful foreign-policy=intellectuals are quick to detect a new trend, attach 
a sexy label to it ("Red Menace," "Islamofascism"), and pro=ose to their clients a brand strategy that answers to the 
perceived need (=93containment," "détente," "counterinsurgency"). 
In No One's World,=foreign-policy intellectual Charles Kupchan—a professor of international=affairs at Georgetown 
University and senior fellow at the Council on Forei=n Relations—tackles the trend commonly referred to as "American 
decline" or "declinism," against the back=rop of the Iraq War, the financial crisis, and the economic rise of China.=While 
I share Kuklick's skepticism about the near zero influence that in=ellectuals have on creating foreign policy, I've enjoyed 
reading what thinkers like Charles Kupchan have to say, and=l believe that if we don't take them too seriously (this rule 
applies al=o to what yours truly has written about these topics), they can help us pu= key questions in context. Such as: 
is the U.S. losing global military and economic dominance and heading towa=ds decline as other powers are taking over? 
The good news is tha= Kupchan's book is just the right size—around 200 pages—with not too=many endnotes and a 
short but valuable bibliography. Kupchan is readable w=thout being too glib. He is clearly an "insider" (he is a former 
National Security Council staffer) but exhibits a healthy =evel of detachment. And Kupchan displays a commendable 
willingness to adju=t his grand vision to changing realities. In a book published ten years ag=, The End of the American 
Era: U.S. Foreign Policy and the Geopolitics of the Twenty-first Century, Kupch=n advanced the thesis that an integrating 
European Union was rising as a c=unterweight to the United States, with China secondary to the EU. That was=his view 
then. The thesis has since been overtaken—let's say, crushed to death—by the crisis in the euro=one and the failure of 
the EU to develop a unified, coherent foreign polic=. But unlike neocons who spend much of their time trying to explain 
why, d=spite all the evidence to the contrary, they have always been right, Kupchan doesn't even revisit his now defunc= 
thesis. While this suggests that we should treat his current book and its=claims that the global balance of power is 
shifting from the United States=and the "West" and towards the "Rest"—non-Western nations like China, India, Brazil, 
and Turkey—with many grains of salt, =e should nevertheless give Kupchan credit for pursuing a non-dogmatic, 
pra=matic, and empiricist approach to international relations. Kupchan may onc= have worked on implementing the 
liberal-internationalist agenda of the Clinton administration, but the vie=s advanced in his latest book—in particular his 
pessimism about America=92s ability to "manage" the international system and his emphasis on t=e role that history 
and culture play in relationships between nation-states—place him in the intellectual camp o= realist foreign-policy 
intellectuals like George Kennan and Henry Kissing=r, at a time when not many of them are around in Washington. 
Kupchan=92s thesis that America and its Western allies are losing their global military, financial, and economic power, 
an= that the rising non-Western powers are not going to adopt Washington's =trategic agenda, may not sound too 
revolutionary these days, when even the=most non-contrarian strategists and economists working for the Pentagon and 
Wall Street recognize that the dom=nance of the West is on the wane. 
But in a chapter tit=ed "The Next Turn: The Rise of the Rest," Kupchan provides the reader =ith the "hard cold facts" as 
he skims through forecasts made by govern=ent agencies and financial institutions predicting that China's economy will 
pass America's within the current decade. An= while America is still overwhelmingly the greatest military power on the 
=Janet, it is only a question of time, according to Kupchan, before China o=ertakes the United States in this arena as well 
and contests America's strategic position in East Asia. "The C=inese ship of state will not dock at the Western harbor, 
obediently taking=the berth assigned to it," he concludes. 
What lends Kupchan=92s overall theme a certain conservative and Kennan-like quality is the ch=llenge he poses to the 
reigning ideological axiom shared by U.S. and Weste=n elites since the end of the Cold War: the notion that the core 
ideas of the modern West—enlightenment, secular=sm, democracy, capitalism—will continue to spread to the rest of 
the wor=d, including to China and the Middle East, and the Western order as it has=evolved since 1945 will thus outlast
