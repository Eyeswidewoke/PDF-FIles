COUNTERTERRORISM 
Conservative Groups Urge FBI to Create 'Transgender Ideology-Inspired Violence' Category Amid Rising 
Political Violence Concerns 
Just the News (09/21, Piper) reported that conservative groups such as the Heritage Foundation and the Oversight 
Project are urging the FBI to create a new domestic terrorism category called "Transgender Ideology-Inspired 
Violence and Extremism" (TIVE), modeled after frameworks for radical Islam and antisemitism. It explained that the 
proposed designation targets individuals who justify violence against opponents on the grounds that opposition to 
transgender ideology constitutes a threat to their existence, similar to eliminationist rhetoric used in other 
extremist movements. According to the article, Oversight Project President Mike Howell said the FBI could 
immediately implement the category to "detect, disrupt, and dismantle TIVE cells," including monitoring online 
forums like Discord and Reddit, with the Joint Terrorism Task Force translating coded language as it did against 
terrorist networks. The article described examples cited in the memos, including the Covenant Presbyterian School 
shooting by Audrey Hale and the alleged assassination of Charlie Kirk by Tyler Robinson, though it noted the 
documented motives often appeared more complex than solely transgender ideology. The article noted that critics, 
including journalist Ken Klippenstein, argue the initiative risks labeling all transgender individuals as extremists, 
while Director Patel, AG Bondi, and President Trump have publicly linked left-wing radicals, including those 
associated with gender ideology, to rising political violence. 
Analysis: How ISIS Could Use Al to Plan Its Next Attack 
An analysis from Newsweek (09/19, O'Connor) reported that ISIS and its affiliates are increasingly exploring 
artificial intelligence (Al) technologies to enhance propaganda, recruitment, and potentially even operational 
planning for attacks, marking what experts say is a dangerous turning point in extremist capabilities. It explained 
that ISIS has already used generative Al (GenAl) to create synthetic propaganda materials, such as AI-generated 
news anchors and manipulated pop culture clips, while researchers warn that emerging "agentic Al" systems could 
autonomously gather bomb-making materials or coordinate complex operations. According to the article, U.S. 
Representative August Pfluger has introduced the Generative Al Terrorism Risk Assessment Act to ensure Al tools 
are not weaponized by foreign terrorist organizations, citing hearings that revealed groups like ISIS and al-Qaeda 
are experimenting with Al for recruitment and radicalization. Federal agencies including the FBI, DHS, and the 
National Counterterrorism Center have issued guidelines addressing AI-enabled threats, while the United Nations 
has also warned that groups like ISIS and AI-Shabaab are using Al tools to translate propaganda, create deepfakes, 
and recruit cyber experts. The article noted that experts fear law enforcement and policymakers remain in a 
constant "catch-up" cycle as extremist groups exploit gaps in regulation, the speed of technological change, and the 
lack of global consensus on balancing security needs with online freedoms. 
Opinion: Director Patel Doesn't Know Who Dylann Roof Is, How Can He Stop the Next Dylann Roof? 
An opinion piece by MSNBC (09/19, DeBerry) reported that Director Patel admitted during a congressional hearing 
that he did not recognize the name Dylann Roof, the white supremacist who murdered nine Black parishioners at 
Charleston's Mother Emanuel A.M.E. Church in 2015. According to the article, Rep. Sydney Kamlager-Dove, D-Calif., 
criticized Director Patel's unfamiliarity with one of the nation's most notorious hate crimes, later saying it raised 
serious concerns about his ability to protect Americans from violent extremism. The article opined that Director 
Patel's lack of awareness, combined with the Dal's removal of a report showing far-right extremists as the leading 
source of domestic terrorism, fueled criticism that the administration is ignoring the threat of right-wing violence.
