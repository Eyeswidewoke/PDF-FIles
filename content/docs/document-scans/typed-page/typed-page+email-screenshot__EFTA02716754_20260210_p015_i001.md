No one is quite sure what has caused the epidemic to =ane. Safe burials may be a big factor, says Katri Jalava, a Finnish 
veterinarian and an epidemiological consultant to the Wor=d Health Organization. It's a local custom to wash the corpse 
and then use the same water to wash the hands of the bereaved, she says. "In terms of a disease like Ebola that=is 
absolutely mad." Most agree that people's everyda= behavior has changed as well. Ubiquitous street signs warn that 
"Ebola is rea=" and tell Monrovians "Don't be the next ca.e." Outside many HOMES are small hand-washing stations 
with bleach, and Liberians have stopped hugging and shaking hands.=Yet "this is still a catastrophe," says Kevin De Cock, 
an epidemio=ogist at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta. =EVEN 20 daily Ebola cases 
would have been unimaginable a year ago. And Guinea has shown that success in fighting Ebola can be short-lived: 
Twice, that =ountry was on the cusp of ending the outbreak, and twice the VIRUS came roaring back. 
Some have even questioned whether Liberia's r=cent drop in cases is real. At a meeting at the Liberian ministry of 
health last week, a U.S. Agency for International Development representative said he had been sent specifically to find 
out i= the numbers can be trusted. "Yes," answered Swedish statistician Hans Rosling, who has spent the past month in 
Monrovia helping the Liberian government interpret epidemiological data.40=A0 CDC researchers, for instance, have 
used mouth swabs to test dead bodies in Monrovia for Ebola; about 20% to 30% are now positive, down from close to 
90% during the height of the epidemic . The re=I number of cases may be twice the reported number, but not much 
more, Roslin= says. "We're in a new phase now." 
The international response has been slow to adapt.40=A0 Although the Pentagon has said it will build fewer new Ebola 
TREATMENT CENTERS, their construction is ongoing. =quot;That doesn't make sense at all," says Thierry Goffeau, head 
of =he DOCTORS Without Borders (MSF) mission in Liberia. "It's clearly a waste of human and financial resources." 
Roslin=, too, says tactics have to change. In September, the main job was building clinics, removing the dead, and 
keepin= as many patients as possible isolated. Now, it's about setting up a flexible system to respond to new outbreaks, 
identifying patients quickly, and tracing their contacts to prevent more infections. "What we needed to do in the first 
phase was rugb=," Rosling says. "Now it is chess." Liberia's medical system, which collapsed under the weight of Ebola, 
is gearing up ag=in. Doctors are returning to work, clinics are reopening. Goffeau says that is sorely needed: "People are 
d=ing at home of many other diseases than Ebola, because they have no access to health care." But medical staff 
still=face an important risk. One in every hundred or thousand patients may carry the Ebola virus=E24,40which could 
start new cycles of infection. There are reports that doctors at some clinics are now doing surgery and delivering babies 
in Ebola protection sui=s. 
At Redemption Hospital in Monrovia, whose inpatient d=partment was closed this summer after several doctors died 
from Ebola, MSF is trying=to protect staff with a new triage unit, which opened on 19 November. Pa=ients with Ebola-
like symptoms are interviewed; if they meet the criteria for a suspect case, they stay in one=of 10 small rooms while 
their blood is TESTED. Those who test negative c=n enter the inpatient ward, while an ambulance takes Ebola patients 
to a treatment unit= MSF has also started distributing malaria drugs to hundreds of thousands of people, not just to 
lower the burden of that disease, which was neglected f=r months, but also to reduce the number of people visiting 
hospitals with a fever. Reopening Monrovia's schools poses similar quandaries. One idea is to SCREEN pupils' 
temperature=as they enter the school. "But what do you do if a 10-year-old kid has a hi=h temperature and the other 
kids start pointing at him and shouting '=bola'?" Rosling says. In a meeting with President Sirleaf, he has argued for a 
caut=ous approach: Opening some schools and carefully studying what happens.<=p>
