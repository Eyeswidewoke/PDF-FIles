Asia: RBI rates decision 
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) left interest 
rates unchanged at its February 2nd meeting 
while reiterating that its stance remains 
accommodative and that it would continue to 
provide ample liquidity to the money market. 
The RBI also stressed that further rate cuts 
would be contingent on continued fiscal 
consolidation and the expected future path of 
inflation. 
Although the RBI maintained its 5% inflation 
target for 2017, it sees some upside risk to 
inflation. The target does not include the 
impact of the impending 7th Pay Commission 
(a wage revision mechanism) which is likely to 
boost inflation. Moreover, a disappointing 
monsoon, an upturn in crude prices from 
current low levels and currency weakness 
could add further upward pressure. 
India's forthcoming FY17 Union Budget, at the 
end of February, will be closely watched by the 
RBI and investors for indications as to the 
govemment's intent and ability to revive 
aggregate demand and investment. A bold 
growth-oriented budget could help the 
govemment to reassert its reform commitment. 
The parliamentary session between February 
and May will be also be monitored for the 
passage of bills such as the proposed goods 
and services tax (GST).

Comments from the rpgions 
EMEA: Signs of slower Eurozone growth 
One previous pillar of the economic rebound 
story — domestic demand data — now looks less 
solid. The trend here is not yet 100% clear but 
certainly appears less strongly upwards. 
German retail sales growth has slowed from 
+3.5% YoY as recently as September to +1.4% 
in December, with its services purchasing 
managers' index (PMI) falling a full point in 
January. The Ito expectations index has fallen by 
-2.2 points since beginning of this year. In 
France, consumer spending growth fell from 
+2.6% YoY in October to +0.3% in December, 
with the service PMI moving close to contraction. 
In Italy, the services PMI has also fallen further 
than expected, with retail sales growth also 
declining from 3.5% YoY last summer to 1.5% 
now. Similar trends are also evident in Spain, 
the former economic star, where the domestic 
services PMI has fallen and retail sales growth 
has slowed from 6% YoY in October to just 2% in 
December. In both Southern European countries, 
their domestic economies are quite important for 
their equity markets, due to the strong weights of 
their respective banking sectors. 
For the overall Eurozone, monetary data also 
show some slowing. Money supply growth (on 
the broad M3 definition) has eased back to 4.7% 
YoY in December from around 5.4% last 
summer. What is also important for the ECB is 
M1 money supply, where YoY growth slowed 
from 12.2% last summer to 10.7% in December. 
No assurance can be given that any forecast or target can be achieved. Forecasts 
are based on assumptions, estimates, opinions and hypothetical models which may 
prove to be incorrect. Past performance is not indicative of future returns. 
Investments come with risk. The value of an investment can fall as well as rise and 
you might not get back the amount originally invested at any point in time. Your 
capital may be at risk.
