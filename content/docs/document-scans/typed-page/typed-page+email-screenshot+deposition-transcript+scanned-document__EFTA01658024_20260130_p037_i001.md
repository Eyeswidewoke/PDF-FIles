federal aid from districts that failed to offer in-person learning. But instead of fighting the many 
districts that defied him, he scaled back his combative rhetoric and toned down his demands." 
Some Colleges Offer Tuition Discounts After Deciding Not To Being Students Back. 
NBC Nightly NewsVi (8/2, story 7, 2:25, Snow, 4.12M) reported that with major universities 
"backing down on bringing students back to campus" in the fall, some are offering discounts on 
tuition and others "are not changing tuition fees, even as some students are suing for tuition 
refunds for spring semester." 
The New York Times (8/2, Al, Hartocollis, Hubler, 18.61M) reports that colleges that are 
planning to welcome students back this fall "face challenges unlike any other American 
institution - containing the coronavirus among a young, impulsive population that not only 
studies together, but lives together, parties together, and, if decades of history are any guide, 
sleeps together." The Times adds, "It will be a hugely complex and costly endeavor requiring far 
more than just the reconfiguring of dorm rooms and cafeterias and the construction of annexes 
and tent classrooms to increase social distancing. It also crucially involves the creation of 
testing programs capable of serving communities the size of small cities and the enforcement of 
codes of conduct among students not eager to be policed." 
Trump Installs Tata As Official "Performing The Duties" Of Pentagon Undersecretary. 
Politico (8/2, Seligman, 4.29M) reports President Trump has installed retired Army Brig. Gen. 
Anthony Tata "for a top Pentagon job in a senior Department of Defense post on a temporary 
basis after lawmakers abruptly canceled his confirmation hearing last week amid lingering 
questions about his fitness for the role." Tata "withdrew Sunday from consideration to be 
undersecretary of defense for policy, a position that requires Senate confirmation, the Pentagon 
said in a statement emailed to Politico Sunday." Tata "has been designated as the official 
'performing the duties of the deputy undersecretary of defense policy." Politico says Tata "has 
been widely criticized for tweets calling former President Barack Obama a 'terrorist leader' and 
referring to Islam as the 'most oppressive violent religion I know of,' among other controversial 
statements." 
Trump Met Yoo At White House Last Week. 
The Hill (8/2, Coleman, 2.98M) reports that UC Berkeley law professor John Yoo has confirmed 
that he and President Trump "met face-to-face at the White House for the first time on 
Thursday." Yoo "told the Las Vegas Review-Journal on Saturday that he met with Trump in the 
Oval Office for about one hour." Yoo, who said White House counsel Pat Cipollone was also 
present, said, "He was upbeat and energetic," and that Trump was not "Nixonian in the bunker 
and paranoid and dark." The Hill says the meeting came in the wake of a piece Yoo wrote for 
the National Review "asserting that the Supreme Court ruling, that blocked Trump's plans to 
end the Obama administration's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program (DACA), could 
help the president institute future policies without congressional approval." 
NYTimes Analysis Questions What Purpose McEnany Serves Beyond "Berating" Media. 
In an analysis, the New York Times (8/2, Rogers, Haberman, 18.61M) reports that President 
Trump "is back to serving as his own primary spokesman," which has left White House Press 
Secretary Kayleigh McEnany "in a distinctly secondary role." McEnany has "encountered flagging 
interest from television networks; only Fox News regularly carries her briefings live, and at least 
one network has declined a request to have her appear on one of its shows." To the Times, "All 
of that is leaving it increasingly unclear what purpose Ms. McEnany is filling beyond berating the 
news media from the briefing room podium." The Times adds that McEnany has "struggled to 
make the briefings compelling enough - or credible enough - to refocus the attention on what 
the administration hopes to highlight instead of the pandemic."
