and opaque with respect the dreams. if conciou=ess screen starts to fade. we can see behind an start to day d=eam, 
if we are unable to craft a screen with no holes we=are fine but that takes enerngy and sleep to fill in the holes. =AO 
without sleep the holes form and dreams start poking their way th=ough. schizohrenia is a person not being able to 
distinguish b=tween dreaming and reality. he is walking in the street but he=hears his mother . the neighborhood cat 
might speak to him. =AO things that everyone experiecens in their dreams the schizo=d cannot tell the differnece his 
screen is damaged. the =reams behind the conciosness screen are tied to the emotions., =why am i in a bad mood , 
could be because I am having a bad dream behind m= conciousness screen, a feeling of dread„ somethin happend i= 
my dream. etc. . it turns out that schizoeds suffer =AO sleep ailments. sleep deprivation causes hallucinatio=s.
dreams while awake). the conbciuousess screen is ti=d to our senses. run through focus filters. with a feedback that in 
=ome instances are hard wired, aversion , danger„ =its the acgivity behind the screen that answers the compleix 
quesiotns. =AO the aha moment is when the dream room sends its message to the concioun=ss room.

verticaland horizonal. chords =AO melody. . as it is generated from the brain can it be reversed en=ineered and used to

analysisi , a long empyt tube can be postualted. b=t thats only its structure, rythms are a product of the =layer not 
only the structure. do german marches provide insite into = german mind. is it organized regulaid. beats that=range 
from 30 - 12 bpm. do afro americnacs. think =ore like jazz. somewhat off the beat. ( humor. unpredict=ble 
movements making it harder for a german to tackle down the field.. =AO ). why do soldiers march further to music,

3. mathematics is the search for truth. algori=hms that do not change there result with the passing of the day. .=C2 
mathematics stands outside of time. the ideal of a point or li=e ( separte from einsteins measuemrnt issues as the actaul 
measurement is =uch more diffcult . requiring a beggining and and end therefor= measurement lives in time space. 
mathematics is the search for truth. I postualte that Biology and biological systems rifler from mathematics beacuse it 
is needs deception to survive. biologica= systems only make sense in time space. , trying to stay away =rom what is the 
moment of life or death. . predator prey= biuoogical systems need free energy in order to maintai= structure 
dissintegraing from entropy, eneygy needs to =e ingested inorder to fight the slope down to breaking apart and 
returning=to dust. . getting energy, the most ba=ic bio requirement. in bio systems however the best way to 
get-energy is either from the sun, a limtied chenical reaction or heat gradise=t. the energy must come from outside. 
the way for system= to gain enery is to eat it. the way not to die is to eat andnot be =aten.. the game of eat or not be 
eaten is very sophisticated =C2 what is the entity . the cell . the organ , the organism . the=community on and on. 
heirarchila nested syst=ms. at every level decision have to be made , is it ok t= sacrifice a few cells so that the organism 
can live. which ce=ls. do they get a choice? how many when . wh=n the organism is eaten by its predator. how did it 
try to protect i=self. camaflouge, surrounding itself in junk, mimicryy, =isdirection, misinformation. etc.. qurum

we know the language/ 
we need =o do the same now for biology, what is the language of the cells. =AO do they 
communcat with proteins, . what are they saying to each o=her, is teh oanaguage encrypted , does each person have 
=is onw code. is it chemcial or elctrical or both. or phy=ical like the shape of the protein fiiting in a lolck, or 
combinatio= of all three. the protein fits. the electri is fired, etc. does the=brain send a message. what does medicine 
do. does it foo= the receiver the sender. the listener. the history of telemommincai=tns intercepts have a long histroy 
referring to alice and bob =hat would like to speak to each other, they encript their messages. so that a listener 
cannot do damge. .=C2 why not attack the bio language the same way as speech. =C2 have nsa work on decrypting 
the differnce in signals =AO from a cancer cell as opposed to a helathy one. we know that cells send=out messages , am
