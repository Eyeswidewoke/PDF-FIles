Central banks and governments implicitly guaranteed this debt, riding to the rescue whenever a repayment crisis 
loomed. They intervened in a host of small financial fires, using low interest rates to put out the flames. But this 
merely allowed the tinder to build up that set off the huge conflagration of 2008. Now the governments' own 
balance-sheets have deteriorated. In America the amount of government debt per person has risen from $16,000 
in 2001 to $34,000 now, and household debt has gone up from $27,000 to $44,000. In Britain government debt 
per head has almost trebled, from £5,000 in 2001 to nearly £18,000 today, and household debt has jumped from 
just under £14,000 to £24,000. 
Cutting the debt back to more acceptable levels is both hard and unappealing, since it may involve years of 
austerity and slow economic growth. It also requires some tough political decisions. If being able to borrow makes 
people feel richer (however illusory the sensation), having to repay the debt makes them feel poorer. They resent 
the sacrifices involved, especially if they are imposed by outsiders. This is particularly true in democracies. In a 
referendum Icelanders voted overwhelmingly against a debt repayment deal with Britain and the Netherlands. 
Dani Rodrik, an economist at Harvard, has talked of a "trilemma" in which countries aiming for the three goals of 
deep economic integration with the rest of the world, national sovereignty and democratic politics can achieve two 
of them but not all three. Left to themselves, voters will resist the sacrifices needed to remain competitive in a 
system of deep economic integration, and nation states are constantly erecting barriers to international trade. 
One way of eliminating those barriers would be to set up some sort of global federal government. Another would 
be to install a "free-market Stalin"—a figure in the mould of Chile's Augusto Pinochet—who would force his 
country's citizens to accept the constraints of the global market, including debt repayment. Neither option is 
appealing. 
The citizens of Europe may now be realising that debt transfers power from the borrower to the creditor. The first 
world war destroyed Britain's credit position and ushered in the era of American financial dominance. Now the 
debt burden reflects the shift in the balance of economic power from rich countries to developing ones. It is 
striking that on average developed countries now have a higher debt burden than emerging nations. Investors 
have certainly noticed, and have poured money into emerging-market bonds funds over the past year. Developing 
countries also have more chance of outgrowing their debt burdens. According to Tony Crescenzi of PIMCO, 
investors are asking themselves, "Would I rather lend money to nations whose debt burden is worsening, or to 
nations where it is improving?" 
This pattern of debt is the opposite of what you might expect. At the level of individual consumers, people tend to 
borrow when they are young because they are hoping for higher incomes in the future. As they reach middle age 
they start to pay off their debts and save for retirement. By extension, rich countries with their greying 
populations should be saving whereas younger, fast-growing developing countries should be borrowing heavily. 
But in fact it is the other way round.
