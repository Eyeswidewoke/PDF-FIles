alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver 
include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management 
to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where 
management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. In addition, there is no guarantee that 
such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any 
negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. 
In order to protect the amounts held in the trust account, Paul Zepf, our Chief Executive Officer, has agreed to be 
liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a vendor for services rendered or products sold to us, or a 
prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement. reduce the 
amount of funds in the trust account to below (i) $10.00 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public 
share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of 
the trust assets other than due to the failure to obtain such waiver, in each cast net of the amount of interest which 
may be withdrawn to pay taxes, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all 
rights to seek access to the trust account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of 
this offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed 
waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, then Mr. Zepf will not be responsible to the extent of 
any liability for such third-party claims. We cannot assure you. however, that Mr. Zepf would be able to satisfy 
those obligations. None of our other officers will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without 
limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses.

In the event that the proceeds in the trust account arc reduced below (i) $10.00 per public share or (ii) such 
lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to 
reductions in value of the trust assets other than due to the failure to obtain such waiver, in each case net of the 
amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes. and Mr. Zepf asserts that he is unable to satisfy its 
indemnification obligations or that he has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our 
independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against Mr. Zepf to enforce his 
indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on 
our behalf against Mr. Zepf to enforce his indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent 
directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in any particular instance. Accordingly, 
we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per-share redemption price will not be 
substantially less than $10.00 per share. 
We will seek to reduce the possibility that Mr. Zepf will have to indemnify the trust account due to claims of 
creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (other than our independent auditors), prospective 
target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, 
interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account. Mr. Zepf will also not be liable as to any 
claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of this offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under 
the Securities Act. We will have access to up to approximately $1,000,000 from the proceeds of this offering with 
which to pay any such potential claims (including costs and expenses incurred in connection with our liquidation, 
currently estimated to be no more than approximately $50,000). In the event that we liquidate and it is 
subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, stockholders who received funds 
from our trust account could be liable for claims made by creditors. In the event that our offering expenses exceed 
our estimate of $750,000, we may fund such excess with funds from the funds not to be held in the trust account. 
In such case, the amount of funds we intend to be held outside the rust account would decrease by a 
corresponding amount. Conversely, in the event that the offering expenses are less than our estimate of $750,000, 
the amount of funds we intend to be held outside the trust account would increase by a corresponding amount. 
Under the DGCL, stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the 
extent of distributions receive) by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to 
our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our business 
combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering may be considered a liquidation distribution under 
Delaware law. If the corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the DGCL intended 
to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during 
which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation 
may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are 
made to riockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser 
of such stockholder's pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of 
the stockholder would be banal after the third anniversary of the dissolution. 
Furthermore. if the pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the 
redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our business combination within 24 months from 
the closing of this offering, is not considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law and such redemption 
distribution is deemed to be unlawful, then pursuant to Section 174 of the DGCL, the statute of limitations for 
claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in
