faltering ... As a result, Trump is widely expected to leave President-elect Joe Biden with a crisis 
that is worse, by nearly every measure, than when he was elected four years ago: an Iranian 
government that is blowing past limits on its nuclear program, while Washington's diplomatic 
and economic leverage steadily declines."
