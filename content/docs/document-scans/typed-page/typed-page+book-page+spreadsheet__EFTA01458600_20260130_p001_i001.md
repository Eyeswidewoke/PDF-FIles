Portfolio 
Our asset-class allocation in a balanced 
portfolio 
Traditional asset classes 
Within the core part of our balanced portfolio, we 
cover traditional liquid assets such as equities, fixed 
income and commodities. The chart shows how we 
would currently design a balanced portfolio, including 
alternative asset classes.' 
■ Equities 
We stay generally positive on developed market equities, where 
returns could reach low double-digit levels one 12-month 
horizon. However, we are now in a mature market phase 
and periods of high volatility are likely as valuations return to 
historical levels. This means that tactical changes in allocations 
may be necessary. We are much more cautious on emerging 
markets, with Asian markets affected by their trading links with 
China. Latin American equities are likely to fare worse, due in 
part to problems surrounding Brazil. 
Fixed income 
When the Fed starts to raise rates, most likely in December, core 
yields will rise- if not by very much. European and Japanese 
bond markets will remain we€l-supported by accommodative 
policy from ECB and Bank of Japan (BOJ). We are cautious on 
U.S. investment grade but continue to see opportunities in high 
yield. Emerging-market bonds may offer high levels of carry but 
this will be accompanied by increased risk, at least in the short 
term, making a highly selective approach essential. Emerging 
markets' increased levels of U.S.-dollar•denominated debt are a 
concern. 
■Commodities 
Oil prices are forecast to increase from current low levels, but 
only slowly - we forecast a price of $55 per barrel WTI on a 
12-month horizon. Demand for oil has so far proved resilient 
to slower emerging-markets growth, but the market remains 
in oversupply, although there are already signs that U.S. shale 
output could moderate. Gold is likely to trade in a tight range 
determined by U.S.•dollar strength: its "safe haven" appeal 
would be boosted by a prolonged period of market turmoil. We 
see only limited opportunities in commodities, so keep portfolio 
allocations at low levels.
