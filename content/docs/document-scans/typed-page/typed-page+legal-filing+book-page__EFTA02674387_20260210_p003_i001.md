Why Africa Needs Its Own Ivy League 
Institution 
Africa is suffering from high graduate unemployment and many of its best students and 
reSear IlerS are flocking overseas. Could an African elite university turn this around',

Casual readers of optimistic 
headlines about Africa's high 
growth rates and record 
levels of foreign investment 
might be forgiven for ihnking 
all us well on the continent -
or at leas' that, with Africa 
Rising% all will be well before 
too long. But many of the 
perspectives and figures 
underlying these simplistic 
narrauves obscure the 
complex reality of rising 
inequality. success in only 
certain specific sectors, and -• aucialty -jgbleaerge.g. 
Indeed, on the continent itself, there is a rising sense that Africa's growth isn't aeating enough

people 
South Africa, and p.,Th Li Kenya and the DRC. are unemployed, In Nigeria, 
approximately 30 lethal youths are jobless And the International Labour Organisation estimates 
that in 2012. 247 melon workers in sub-Saharan Africa were in vulnerable employment. Also 
worrying is the fact that having an education does not seem to help. In response to an advert for 
100 drivers an Nigeria last year, the Dangote Group fecerve  13 000 applicants including 6,460 
with bachelor degrees, 704 with masters and 6 with PhDs. Seth Africa's youth population 
expected to double by 2045, this could prove to be a ticking time bomb, one only needs to look at 
the likes of Tunisia and Egypt for a forewarning of what a growing numbers of highly-educated

Broadty.speaking, there are two ways of looking al the problem: 1) the economy's demand for 
labour isn't sufficiently strong to generate enough jobs because growth isn't fast enough ander 
the sectors which are growing are not labour intensive enough; or 2) the supply of potential 
workers Isn't appropriately educated and skilled fa the jobs that could be available 
In realty, both are true. However, the latter can influence the tamer, and it is the latter to which 
we will now turn. 
Seeking studies overseas 
AS high levels of unemployment amongst graduates suggests. African universities we churning 
out armies of job seekers rather than job creators. Higher education does not even appear to be 
correlated with higher employment in a number of places. In Uganda. for example, 19% of 
Ugandan gradualeS are lallffildffiadt9. compared to 7% of secondary school leaven. And in 
Newts graduates are 5% less likely to be employed than those with just a basic education. 
On top of this. many of Africa's best students are choosing to study abroad. According to (cures 
from 2006. one out of every sixteen students es sub-Saharan Africa is enrolled outside the 
continent. and some countries even have more Students abroad then al home. Nigerian str.dents 
are estimated to scene $500 million annually in Western universities, a staggenng 70% of the 
national university budget.
