FX Blueprint: Forever Young 
Theme #5: Zar Wars: the return of Yuan solo - buy USD/ZAR 
The rand was one of the worst performing 
currencies in 2015. We remain pessimistic for 
2016, as ZAR continues to face major headwinds 
from external factors (Fed, commodities, China) 
and domestic risks (lack of growth, structural 
problems, political uncertainty, current account 
deficit). Stay long USD/ZAR. 
r,ie'...s We expect the broad dollar 
uptrend to remain intact this year as the focus turns to 
the timing of the next hike and the possibility of faster-
than-expected Fed normalization. This is bad news for 
the rand, which has one of the highest betas in EM to 
dollar strength. Moreover, broad dollar strength, along 
with dwindling demand and persistent oversupply 
issues, will continue to drive commodities weakness in 
the coming year. According to our Commodities 
research team, the outlook for metals is particularly 
pessimistic, and we have some way to go before 
calling a bottom to the cycle. This again is bad news 
for the rand, given South Africa's reliance on both 
precious and industrial metals exports. 
IZAR is among the most exposed in EM: high beta to 
!broad dollar strength and to commodities weakness

China is arguably the most critical external risk factor 
for 2016. First, potentially weaker growth in China, and 
growth rebalanced towards consumption rather than 
commodity-intensive 
investment, 
will 
have 
a 
particularly bearish impact on the price of metals 
(China is the major global consumer). Iron ore is of 
particular concern - China consumes nearly 60% of the 
world's iron ore, which is a major South African export. 
Second, South Africa's direct trade links with China are 
substantial. Third, ZAR is the most vulnerable currency 
to general EM FX volatility and a widening of the CNH-
CNY basis that would accompany noise around any 
'disorderly' yuan depreciation (see chart below). The 
Chinese authorities' recent shift in focus towards a 
RMB basket has added further uncertainty, and has 
increased the prospect of USDCNY upside.

Several reasons on the domestic front to be bearish 
External imbalances' South Africa's external financing 
requirements are high. Sticky and high demand for 
imported goods keeps the C/A deficit elevated (-4% of 
GDP), while the low level of fx reserves (<100% of 
short-term external debt + C/A deficit) provides little 
protection against rand depreciation. ZAR is therefore 
particularly exposed to external shocks and tightening 
global liquidity conditions (e.g. through QT or a 
hawkish Fed).

GDP growth is weak. 
and DB Economics expects a meager 1% expansion in 
2016, with a further scaling back of capital investment 
likely. Business and consumer confidence are also at 
multi-year lows. There is no respite on the horizon: 
corporate profits are in recession, the business cycle 
downswing is expected to intensify in 2016, a major 
drought is underway and global growth is anemic. 
Structural roadblock:, These cyclical problems are 
compounded by structural issues which are an 
impediment to growth but are difficult to rectify in the 
near term. Electricity shortages persist, and are 
estimated to subtract 1pp from annual growth. 
Unemployment is entrenched above 25% and there is a 
constant threat of large-scale labour strikes.

rand weakness in 2016. The SARB's hands are 
somewhat tied - it can hike rates to maintain interest 
rate differentials with the US and attempt to cap 
currency depreciation; however, it will be hiking into a 
major domestic economy downswing, which will likely 
only provide temporary rand support.
