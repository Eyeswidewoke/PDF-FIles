Chicago FBI Seeking Public Help to Find Person Involved in Bank Robbery 
The Chicago Tribune (08/15, Stevens) reported that the FBI is seeking information on an unnamed person 
suspected of robbing the First Savings Bank of Hegewisch in Lansing on Aug. 9, and offering a reward of up to 
$10,000. The article stated that Chicago FBI classified the suspect Wednesday as a 40- to 60-year-old white man 
dressed in a dark-colored baseball hat, black sunglasses, a light-colored medical face mask, a purple and green plaid 
button-up short sleeved shirt with a black undershirt, dark-colored cargo pants and dark-colored shoes. He also 
wore a watch on his right wrist and carried a blue Walmart shopping bag, the release said. The article mentioned 
that Special Agent Siobhan Johnson said Wednesday security footage captured the person walking slowly across 
the lobby and sitting down, taking his time before ordering people in the bank to a back room and demanding 
money. Johnson declined to say how much money the person was given, but said his approach to wait in the lobby 
before robbing the bank is "unusual." The article quoted Johnson, who said, "Bank robbers don't just appear and 
disappear as soon as they go into the bank, someone saw him changing into this clothing or changing out of this 
clothing at some point. Someone saw him walking through the neighborhood, either getting into a bus or getting 
into a car, and those are the things we're really looking for."

FINANCIAL CRIME & CORPORATE SCANDALS 
Inside the $93 Million Wall Street Heist That Stemmed From Russia 
CNBC (08/15, Staff Writer) reported that the money Vladislav Klyushin made from stolen financial information 
literally piled up, filling a safe with stacks of hundred-dollar bills. At one point, he was hoarding over $3 million in 
illegal gains. In less than three years, Klyushin's cybersecurity scam amassed more than $93 million. His company, 
M-13, acted as a front for Russian hackers to steal information under the guise of protecting it, getting their hands 
on American corporate earnings reports before the rest of the world could see them. Then, they traded based on 
that insight, buying and selling stock from well-known American companies like Skechers, Snapchat and Roku. 
According to the article, M-13 once targeted Tesla, stealing its drafted earnings release and buying stock based on a 
historically successful quarter. Once the final earnings report went public, shares of Tesla soared in price, and 
Klyushin's team walked away with yet another stack of cash. The article mentioned that Klyushin grew his empire 
until he was riding on private jets and shaking hands with Russian government officials. But what the oligarch and 
his team didn't know is that the FBI had been watching them — dissecting how the scam worked and determining 
what, if anything, they could do to stop it. The article stated that Klyushin was one of 12 alleged Russian 
intelligence operatives charged with hacking and insider trading by the U.S. government in 2021. After being 
sentenced to a nine-year jail term in 2023, Klyushin was released in August 2024 as part of a historic U.S.-Russia 
prisoner swap that included Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich. The exchange is thought to be the first 
U.S. prisoner swap to include international cybercriminals and freed four American citizens wrongfully detained in 
Russia.

CYBER DIVISION 
Motorists Warned As Parking Lot Cyber Swimmers Strike 
Forbes (08/15, Winder) reported that the RAC, formerly known as the Royal Automobile Club, in the U.K. has issued 
an alert for motorists to beware of parking lot cyber scammers following a spate of ticket payment fraud. The 
warning comes as fake Quick Response code stickers are being used to direct motorists away from genuine parking 
fee payment sites in order to grab payment card credentials. Such abuse of QR codes is nothing new, the FBI has 
previously warned U.S. citizens to be aware of such fraud and offers seven tips to mitigate becoming a victim. The 
article noted that FBI alert number I-011822-PSA, Cybercriminals Tampering with QR Codes to Steal Victim Funds, 
was issued to raise awareness of just this type of QR code cyber crime. The article quoted the FBI, which 
said, "Cybercriminals are tampering with QR codes to redirect victims to malicious sites that steal login and 
financial information." The article added that the FBI said that it's important for people to "practice caution when 
entering financial information as well as providing payment through a site navigated to through a QR code."
