interrogation al a mock crime. Error bars denote SEM sP < 0.05. 
The Response (lie vs. truth) revealed a significant main effect 
on SCR (Pia, = 38.190. P < 0.001); however, the Stimulation 
Condition (anodal tDCS vs. sham tDCS) had no effect on SCR 
(Fin = 1.164. P= 0.298), and no significant interaction (Al , = 
0.009, P= 0.926) was found between Stimulation Condition and 
Response (Fig. 4b). Also concerning the feelings of guilt that 
subjects might have experienced while deceiving the in-
terrogator, in contrast to the first experiment, anodal tDCS 
did not lead to a significant change of the subjective 
experience of guilt (z = -1.89, P= 0.05% Fig. 4c). 
Experiment 3 
We tested a possible impact of cathodal tDCS of the aPFC on 
general prefrontal executive function by using the Stroop test 
as a control task. An ANOVA" with StimulatkniCondition(„ h,44
imsy mni in", and Stroop Conditiorkamgmenyhwonwom,) as within-
subject factors revealed a significant main effect of the Stroup 
Condition on RT 
= 46.109, P < 0.001). However, the 
Stimulation Condition had no effect on RT (Fit%) = 1.050. 
P= 3.18), and no significant interaction (F1,,9 = 1.593, P1222) 
was found between Stimulation Condition and Strom) Condition 
(see Fig. 5). 
Discussion 
This study demonstrates for the first time that cathodal 
transcranial DC stimulation, which has been repeatedly shown 
to suppress conical excitability (Nitsche, Nitsche. et aL 2003: 
Antal et al. 2004; DieckhOfer et at 2OO6) can modulate 
deceptive behavior. Moreover, our findings give causal support 
to recent correlative data obtained by neuroimaging studies 
indicating a predominant role of the aPFC in deceptive 
behavior (Lee et al. 2002: Ganis ct al. 2003; Abe et al. 2007). 
Whereas in previous studies on neural correlates of deception 
participants were instructed when to lie and when to say the 
truth, in the present study, subjects could decide themselves 
which questions they would answer truthfully and which ones 
with a lie, taking into account the difference in cognitive 
processing for cued and unwed lying. Must remarkably, we 
observed that inhibiting the excitability of the aPFC with 
cathodal tDCS did not lead to impairment but rather to 
a significant within-subject improvement of deceptive behav-
ior. This effect was expressed in faster RTs for telling lies, but 
not for telling the truth, a decrease in sympathetic SCR and 
feelings of guilt white deceiving the interrogator and a signif-
icantly higher EQ. which reflects skillful lying. 
In order to exclude the possibility that the observed effects 
were only due to nonspecific effects of the electrical 
stimulation and not specific to the inhibition of the OR: by 
cathodal DC stimulation, we conducted a control experiment 
in which the stimulation polarity was reversed. Our data show 
that shorter RTs in telling lies compared with telling the truth 
and the absence of increased SCR while deceiving the 
interrogator were confined to cathodal UM'S of the aPH: and 
were not detectable during sham tDCS or anodal tDCS. Because 
subjects were blinded to the stimulation condition and could
