the heart of the recent market turmoil, have been quick to blame an Anglo-Saxon conspiracy, brewed up by hedge 
funds, credit-rating agencies and even newspapers like this one, for unfairly pushing up their borrowing costs. The 
German government moved to ban short-selling of government bonds and some CDS transactions last month. As 
Charles Stanley, a stockbroking firm, cynically puts it, EU nations are saying: "Please fund our lifestyles, but don't 
hold us to any commitments." 
Why it matters 
If a husband borrows money from his wife, the family is no worse off. By extension, just as every debt is a liability 
for the borrower, it is an asset for the creditor. Since Earth is not borrowing money from Mars, does the debt 
explosion really matter, or is it just an accounting device? 
During the credit boom of the early 1990s and 2000s the conventional view was that it did not matter. Not only 
were asset prices rising even faster than debt but the use of derivatives was spreading risk across the system 
and, in particular, away from the banks, which had capital ratios well above the regulatory minimum. 
The problem with debt, though, is the need to repay it. Not for nothing does the word credit have its roots in the 
Latin word credere, to believe. If creditors lose faith in their borrowers, they will demand the repayment of 
existing debt or refuse to renew old loans. If the debt is secured against assets, then the borrower may be forced 
to sell. A lot of forced sales will cause asset prices to fall and make creditors even less willing to extend loans. If 
the asset price falls below the value of the loan, then both creditors and borrowers will lose money. 
This is particularly troublesome if the economy slips into deflation, as happened globally in the 1930s and in 
Japan in the 1990s. Debt levels are fixed in nominal terms whereas asset prices can go up or down. So falling 
prices create a spiral in which assets are sold off to repay debts, triggering further price falls and further sales. 
Irving Fisher, an economist who worked in the first half of the 20th century, called this the debt deflation trap. 
Another reason why debt matters is to do with the role of banks in the economy. By their nature, banks borrow 
short (from depositors or the wholesale markets) and lend long. The business depends on confidence; no bank 
can survive if its depositors (or its wholesale lenders) all want their money back at once. If banks struggle to 
meet their own debts, they have no choice but to reduce their lending. If this happens on a large scale, as it did in 
the 1930s, the ripple effect for the economy as a whole can be devastating. 
Both of these effects were seen in the debt crisis of 2007-08. Falling property prices caused defaults and a 
liquidity crisis in the banking system so severe that the authorities feared the cash machines would stop working. 
Hence the unprecedented largesse of the bank bail-out. 
Hyman Minsky, an American economist who has become more fashionable since his death in 1996, argued that 
these debt crises were both inherent in the capitalist system and cyclical. Prosperous times encourage individuals 
and companies to take on more risk, meaning more debt. Initially such speculation is successful and encourages 
others to follow suit; eventually credit is extended to those who will be able to repay the debt only if asset prices 
keep rising (a succinct description of the subprime-lending boom). In the end the pyramid collapses. 
In the aftermath of the latest collapse it is clear that the distinction between debt in the private and public sector 
has become blurred. If the private sector suffers, the public sector may be forced to step in and assume, or 
guarantee, the debt, as happened in 2008. Otherwise the economy may suffer a deep recession which will cut the 
tax revenues governments need to service their own debt. 
If the Western world faces an era of austerity as debts are paid down, how will that affect day-to-day life? Clearly 
a society built on consumption will have to pay more attention to saving. The idea that using borrowed money to 
buy assets is the smart road to riches might lose currency, changing attitudes to home ownership as well as to 
parts of the finance sector such as private equity. 
This special report will argue that, for the developed world, the debt-financed model has reached its limit. Most of 
the options for dealing with the debt overhang are unpalatable. As has already been seen in Greece and Ireland,
