the 57th person charged in the nationwide investigation. He's charged with mail fraud and 
bribery." 
Reuters (9/2, Raymond) reports that Ernst "has pleaded not guilty to charges that he 
accepted bribes to help wealthy parents' children win admission to Georgetown as purported 
tennis recruits. Khoury's attorney, Eoin Beirne, said he looked forward to rebutting the 
government's claims. 'His child's college application was completely accurate and contained no 
misrepresentations about being a fake athlete or anything else,' he said." 
CNN (9/2, Moghe, 83.16M) reports, "Nancy Sterling, a spokeswoman for Khoury, said he 
had nothing to do with William 'Rick' Singer, the mastermind of the scheme who has pleaded 
guilty and is cooperating with the federal investigation. 'There was no test or class cheating. His 
child's college application was completely accurate and contained no misrepresentations about 
being a fake athlete or anything else. We look forward to this process to rebut the government's 
claims,' Sterling said." Khoury "is the son of billionaire Amin J. Khoury." 
Oregon Couple Who Scammed Elderly Victims Sentenced To Federal Prison. 
The Oregonian (9/2, Bernstein, 1M) reports, "A Happy Valley couple who scammed an elderly 
Tigard couple out of millions of dollars and then used the ill-gotten money to fund a lavish 
lifestyle of travel, gambling, custom-tailored clothes, high-end cars and expensive cigars were 
sentenced Wednesday to federal prison." Assistant US Attorney Donna Maddux "led the court 
through a photo and video display of the couple's social media postings that showed them 
attending the Kentucky Derby, New Year's Eve parties in Las Vegas and photos of their closets 
filled with designer brand shoes, suits, dresses and handbags." US District Judge Michael W. 
Mosman "sentenced Ronnie Stevens, 51, to five years and 11 months, and Tina Ephrem, 44, to 
five years in prison after they had pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud." 
US Charges Two In $12M Scheme Targeting Investors In Puerto Rico. 
The AP (9/2) reports from San Juan, Puerto Rico, "Two men who founded what authorities say 
was a fake financial services company in Florida that raised more than $12 million from at least 
150 investors in Puerto Rico and beyond have been arrested, officials said Wednesday." Gary 
Steven Wykle, 72, and Alejandro Cortes Lopez, 58, "face charges including conspiracy to 
commit wire fraud as part of a 14-count federal indictment following an FBI investigation." US 
Attorney Stephen Muldrow "said the suspects falsely told clients their investments in 
promissory notes would provide loans for companies including hotels and resorts in the 
Dominican Republic and elsewhere. Muldrow and the Securities and Exchange Commission said 
more than $1.2 million of that money was used to finance Wykle's personal expenses, including 
shopping, travel, rent, food and entertainment." 
Trial Of Chicago Alderman Burke Could Be Delayed To 2020 Amid Pandemic. 
The Chicago Tribune (9/2, Meisner, 2.65M) reports, "The sweeping racketeering charges against 
Chicago Ald. Edward Burke may not go to trial until 2022 due to the ongoing pandemic and 
what Burke's lawyers call a 'staggering' amount of evidence yet to be turned over to the 
defense." Burke "was indicted in May 2019 on 14 counts including racketeering, bribery and 
extortion conspiracy alleging a variety of schemes where he used his powerful public office to 
pressure others into giving business to his private law firm. A trial for Burke and his two co-
defendants - 14th Ward operative Peter J. Andrews and real estate developer Charles Cui - had 
tentatively been scheduled for mid-2021," but "during a status hearing Wednesday, U.S. District 
Judge Robert Dow as well as attorneys for both sides agreed that setting a firm date for such a 
large-scale trial seemed pointless with so many ongoing issues yet to resolve. 'I'd like to give 
you all a trial date, but I'd like to give you one we think will stick,' Dow said."
