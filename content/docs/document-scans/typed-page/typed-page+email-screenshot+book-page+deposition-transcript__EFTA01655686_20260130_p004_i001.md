Continued Reporting: Director Patel to Lead Both FBI and ATF, Pledges Constitutional Focus and Crime-
Fighting Resolve 
Clearance Jobs (02/25, Suciu) reported that Director Patel has been appointed to lead the FBI and the ATF, making 
him the first Indian American and Hindu American to head the FBI, and he was sworn in as acting director of the 
ATF on a Monday afternoon, just after being sworn in as the head of the FBI on a Friday. According to the article, 
Director Patel, who is 45 years old, has previously served as a National Security Council official, chief of staff to the 
Acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller, and senior advisor to the acting director of national intelligence 
during the first Trump administration, where he oversaw the execution of several of President Donald J. Trump's 
top priorities, including eliminating ISIS and AI-Qa'ida leadership. As the principal deputy to the acting director of 
national intelligence, Director Patel helped oversee the operations of all 17 intelligence community agencies and 
provided the President's Daily Briefing, and he has also worked as a public defender in Florida, a federal public 
defender, a trial attorney by the United States Department of Justice (DoJ) National Security Division, and senior 
counsel on counterterrorism for the House Intelligence Committee. Director Patel's appointment to head the FBI 
was confirmed on a party-line vote of 51 to 49, with two Republicans joining all Democrats voting against him, and 
he has stated that he will follow the constitution of the United States and has no interest in pursuing retribution 
against critics of the administration, but rather wants to focus on fighting crime. The article explained that as the 
head of the FBI, Director Patel will oversee around 38,000 employees, including special agents, intelligence 
analysts, and administrative staff, and he will also be responsible for leading the ATF, which has an additional 5,500 
employees and is responsible for enforcing federal laws related to firearms and explosives, as well as tobacco and 
alcohol. Director Patel's appointment has been praised by supporters of the Second Amendment, but has also been 
met with concern from gun control advocates, who are worried about his views on gun rights, and it is unclear if a 
permanent head will be named to head the ATF or what the White House's long-term plans are for the agency. The 
article highlighted that Director Patel has stated that he will work to protect the United States and its citizens from 
harm, saying "Anyone that wishes to do harm to our way of life and our citizens, here and abroad, will face the full 
wrath of the DOJ and FBI," and he has also emphasized the importance of fighting crime and pursuing those who 
seek to harm the country.

NBC News (02/25, Burke) reported that a 21-year-old, Seth "Andrea" Gregori, was arrested in Texas for making

white people, especially white officers," authorities said. The Army veteran was killed after authorities detonated a 
bomb following several hours of negotiations. USA TODAY (02/25, Olivia, Nickas, Nguyen) and KRIV (Fox-26) (02/25,
