When a distinguished but elderly scien-
tist states that something is possible, he 
is almost certainly right. When he states 
that something is impossible, he is very 
probably wrong."

The Temptations and Hazards of 
Predicting the Future 
Speculating about the future of sci-
ence seems to be genetically encoded in 
scientists. We all do it. We also take it as 
an article of faith that serious predic-
tions are almost always wrong. Is think-
ing about the future an important thing 
to do. or just a diversion—like day-
dreaming, or gardening, or playing the 
lottery? Why do we spend our time 
guessing about matters we believe we 
cannot predict? 
There arc at least five reasons. The 
first is utilitarian: to plan our work. 
Thinking about the future is a part of 
choosing research problems. We who 
make our living in science tell ourselves 
that we work for the satisfaction of 
solving problems and for the thrill of 
discovery; sociologists. less charitably, 
suggest that we do so to make a living 
and to get ahead professionally. The 
truth is probably a mixture of the two. 
Finding good problems—problems that

polish a new facet of reality and that 
change the way some part of the world 
works—is both satisfying intellectually 
and rewarding professionally. 
The second reason is to feed our 
curiosity. We wonder about the world of 
the future. What neat widgets will make 
that world run? Which of our fantasies 
will grow into our grandchildren's real-
ities? 
The third is philosophical. Science 
and technology are major elements of 
the culture of our times. They, probably 
more than other elements (materialism, 
religious fundamentalism, capitalism, 
...), will change the nature of individuals 
and of society. We wonder: What will 
the big changes be? How will science be 
involved? 
The fourth is that society expects us 
to speculate. We are pan of its early 
warning system for change. 
The fifth is to answer an uncomfort-
able question: "Is there research that we 
should not do?" We scientists generally 
cohabit quite comfortably with an amor-
al curiosity. We should 
ask if there is research 
we can do now—re-
search that is technical-
ly feasible and scientifi-
cally interesting—that 
we should forgo be-
cause it is ethically 
problematic. Are there questions we 
don't want to ask, because there are no 
circumstances in which we might want 
to know the answers?

dictable "ordinary", and a little of the

familiar science—can often be extrapo• 
lated into the future with fair accuracy. 
It is the extraordinary science—the sur-
prises—that we cannot predict. and it is 
this science that gives speculation about 
the future its well-deserved bad reputa-
tion. It is also the surprises that make 
science so intensely interesting, and that 
have the power, for better or worse, to 
turn the lives of our grandchildren up-
side down. 
One of the many charms of science is 
that it provides an endless string of 
surprises. Some surprises grow slowly 
and incrementally, while some come. 
apparently, out of the blue. Each of us 
can make two lists of surprises: one of 
personal favorites, and one of surprises 
that have remade the world. These two 
lists are usually rather different. We 
have a particular affection for what we 
know, and find small 
quirks in familiar sci-
ence endearing. Appre-
ciation for big discover-
ies in unfamiliar fields 
requires more effort. 
The objective of 
science is to make a 
difference.

I was immediately de-
lighted—in fact, ecstatic—to learn that 
XeF., is a stable compound: because I 
knew less about biology, it took me 
years to assimilate the discovery of 
apoptosis. and to begin to appreciate 
how the cell chooses between life and 
death. Not all surprises are equal: xenon 
tetralluoride clarified the chemical bond 
for chemists; apoptosis changed the 
understanding of "life" for all of science.
