Macro Strategy 
I'll be honest and say that yesterday's EMR was a bit of a daze. I had a belated 
party for my 40th on Saturday and spent virtually the entire Friday night awake 
with my builders trying to put a house back together that has been owned by 
the builders for 8 months. I had 15 people there until 4am Friday night with 3 
of them working non-stop until the first guests arrived at 230pm. Never have I 
been so stressed and tired. So all day Sunday and Monday morning were a bit 
of a daze. Sadly I'm now back living with builders again as they finish things 
off after the party. It was blissful for the few hours we were apart. At least 
we've moved out of the kitchen where we were living and sleeping for nearly 5 
months before last week. Hopefully by the time the second half of the year 
ends I'll never have to see a builder again. 
Anyway, the second half has now begun for markets and in our H1/02/ June 
performance review today we show that most assets have had a positive year 
so far. So much so that if the year eventually goes to penalties it will end up 
being a very poor second half showing in line with many of England's in recent 
years!! We briefly review the numbers at the end but all the data and charts are 
in the pdf of this document. Its pretty rare to have almost all main global assets 
in positive territory this far into a year. Central bank liquidity continues to drive 
markets in our opinion which has helped this synchronised uplift in valuations. 
However we can't help sensing that there's less joy over these returns than 
might be expected. Investors are worried about valuations in numerous assets 
and worried that the Fed might become more hawkish soon. There's little 
chance of the ECB following suit anytime soon though and European 
Government bonds have had a very good 2014 so far. 
Over the last month we've again highlighted how many European Government 
bond markets have hit multi-century, all time yield lows. Well yesterday it was 
the turn of the Dutch 10 year yield to go through it's all time low again. The 
Dutch series is where we have our longest history of any government bond 
market with data going back to 1517 spanning almost half a millennia. The 
graph is in the pdf today and further shows just how unique the current 
situation is. The level of uncertainty about how this all ends must by definition 
be very high given this. 
So as we start H2. Asian markets are trading with a stronger tone this morning 
helped by a solid start to the global manufacturing PMIs. The official Chinese 
manufacturing PMI printed at 51.0. in line with consensus and at a six month 
high. The final HSBC Chinese manufacturing PMI came in at 50.7, slightly 
below the flash reading of 50.8, but this is also the highest print of the year. 
The PMIs for other Asian bellwethers including Indonesia and Taiwan were 
also up on a month-to-month basis. The Nikkei (+1.2%) is the clear 
outperformer today, on decent volumes and despite a drop in the Japanese Q2 
tankan manufacturing index to 12 from 17 previously and 15 expected. The 
capex component of the Tankan survey was above expectations however 
(+7.4% vs 6.0%) expected, which is strongest rate of growth since 2007. This 
has helped USDJPY (+0.1%) today. Outside of Japan, activity has been 
subdued with Hong Kong markets shut for July 1st holidays. The Indonesian
