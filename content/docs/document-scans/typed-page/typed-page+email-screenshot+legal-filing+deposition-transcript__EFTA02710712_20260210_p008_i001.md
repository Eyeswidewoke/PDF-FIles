and Poor's (MHFI) explains why states are not doing this. Henry H=nderson, a director of public finance at Standard and 
Poor's, says borrowing for anything, including infr=structure projects, requires states to account for future interest 
payments in budget projections. Even with low interest rates, that's money they just don't want to spend. In=tead 
resources are going toward other services (such as schools), lowering taxes, and funding pension and health care. About 
10 states are proposing tax cuts for 2015, but hardly any states are planning significant infrastructur= expansion. 
This is short-term thinking. Neglecting infrastruct=re now increases the cost of repairs in the future, both because there 
will be more damage and because the cost of borrowing money will probably rise. Interest ratesQ=A0are='t likely =o 
stay so low for long, and the federal government is considering res=ricting states' ability to issue tax-exempt bonds. 
Meanwhile= competing budget pressures will probably intensify. As of now, 74 percent of the liabilities that states owe 
are unfunded retirement benefits= according to the Standard and Poor's report. The ratings agency predicts that the 
private sector will eventually have to step in. The government has already teamed up with private entities to finance 
infrastructure projects in 33 states. These arrangements, called P3s (for public-private partnerships), are already 
popular abroad—espec=ally in emerging markets whose high borrowing costs and political corruption have stymied 
adequate infrastructure investment. Municipalities may find t=at P3s can serve a similar purpose in the U.S. 
Last week, Steve Kroft on 60 Minutes did a distressing segment — Falling a=art: America's neglected infrastructure. 
There are a lot of people in the United States right now who think the country is falling apart, and at least in one respect 
they're correct. Our roads and bridg=s are crumbling, our airports are out of date and the vast majority of our seapor=s 
are in danger of becoming obsolete. All the result of decades of neglect. N=ne of this is really in dispute. Business 
leaders, labor unions, governors, mayors, congressmen and presidents have complained about a lack of funding =or 
years, but aside from a one time cash infusion from the stimulus program, nothing much has changed. There is still no 
consensus on how to solve the problem or where to get the massive amounts of money needed to fix it, just another 
example of political paralysis in Washington. Tens of million= of American cross over bridges every day without giving it 
much thought, unless they hit a pothole= But the infrastructure problem goes much deeper than pavement. It goe= to 
crumbling concrete and corroded steel and the fact that nearly 70,000 bridg=s in America -- one out of every nine -- is 
now considered to be structurally deficient.

Steve Kroft reported on why our roads, bridges, airport= and rail are outdated and need to be fixed. "You could go to 
any =ajor city in America and see roads, and bridges, and infrastructure that need to be fixe= today." Ray La Hood: Our 
infrastructure is on life support right now. That's what we'r= on. Few people are more aware of the situation than Ray 
LaHood, who was secretary of transportation during the first Obama administration, and before that a seven-term 
Republican congressman from Illinois. He is currently co-chairman of Building America's Future, a bipartisan coalition of 
current and former elec=ed officials that is urgently pushing for more spending on infrastructure.Q=A0 Steve Kroft: 
According to the government, there are 70,000 bridges that have been deemed structurally deficient...A0 Ray LaHood: 
It means that there are bridges that need to be really either replaced or repaired in a very dramatic way.=C2*
