What are the near-term and long-term risks for these 
stocks, especially after surging prices in 2013? 
With these stocks up a median 60% in 2013, the risks naturally become worth 
considering to a greater extent than over the past year. However, we see near-
term downside being limited as long as the cyclical tailwinds remain favorable 
(e.g. strengthening economy, good capital markets activity with stable-to-
higher market levels, good fundraising & organic growth). This said, we outline 
numerous near- and long-term risks for these stocks below. 
Economic slowdown, with related market pressures 
A reversion in the economy, be it the US or other major industrialized nations 
(or collectively most of the major emerging markets), is easily the greatest risk 
for these stocks given their earnings leverage to economic cycles. While we do 
not believe we would see the level of price compression that Blackstone 
experienced in the financial crisis (each of these other Alts came public well 
after the financial crisis) when BX shares for a brief time in March of 2009 
were down nearly 90% from their peak shortly after the IP0 in June of 2007 
(and have only recently recovered to levels above the IP0 price), the stocks 
could easily underperform significantly upon speculation of a recession, until 
investors sort their theses out. 
We think a large part of the near-90% compression was due not only to IP0 
pricing near the market peak, but also the uncertain impact of such a deep 
financial crisis on the private equity business model. Now that is has been 
proven that not only is private equity able to withstand a deep bear market, but 
also the lower market prices provide excellent entry points for their 
investments and contribute to much stronger long-term IRRs, we think the 
next economic cycle downturn will be much less severe than the BX situation. 
This said, with these stocks up a median 60% in 2013 (and BX over 100%), we 
do not see any material chance of a recession as being priced into these stocks, 
so if that scenario began to emerge (as it had at certain points during 2010-12), 
this could drive significant underperformance in the stocks. At this stage in the 
economic cycle, earnings profiles for the Alts in 2014 should remain supportive, 
with increasing realizations generating good sequential distributable earnings 
growth for at least the next several quarters. 
A potential valley in disci Iberians in private equity cycle 
Longer-term however (-2017-19), we think it will become difficult for the Alts 
to grow from potentially peak distributable earnings in 2015-16 for much of the 
group, given the firms will have likely exhausted a large portion of embedded 
gains through realizations. To combat this, the firms will need to maintain the 
current healthy pace of fundraising for at least the next 1-2 years and be able 
to deploy capital in attractive opportunities, which could become scarcer if 
capital markets remain robust. Thus, we think a key risk for these stocks as we 
approach that part of the cycle, will be an expected drop off in distributable 
earnings until the most recently raised funds can enter distribution mode. 
Investors will be watching this inflection closely, and the stocks may very well 
underperform before it occurs.
