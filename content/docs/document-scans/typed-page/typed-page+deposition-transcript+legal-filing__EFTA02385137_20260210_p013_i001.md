Russian. Why? 
During the great, and still unsung, era of Russian 
intellectual expatriation-- roughly between 1920 and 1940--
books written in Russian by emigre Russians and published by 
emigre firms abroad were eagerly bought or borrowed by 
emigre readers but were absolutely banned in Soviet Russia-- as 
they still are (except in the case of a few dead authors such 
as Kuprin and Bunin, whose heavily censored works have been 
recently reprinted there), no matter the theme of the story or 
poem. An emigre novel, published, say, in Paris and sold over 
all free Europe, might have, in those years, a total sale of 
1,000 or 2,000 copies-- that would be a best seller-- but every 
copy would also pass from hand to hand and be read by at least 
20 persons, and at least 50 annually if stocked by Russian 
lending libraries, of which there were hundreds in West Europe 
alone. The era of expatriation can be said to have ended during 
World War II. Old writers died, Russian publishers also 
vanished, and worst of all, the general atmosphere of exile 
culture, with its splendor, and vigor, and purity, and 
reverberative force, dwindled to a sprinkle of Russian-language 
periodicals, anemic in talent and provincial in tone. Now to 
take my own case: It was not the financial side that really 
mattered; I don't think my Russian writings ever brought me 
more than a few hundred dollars per year, and I am all for the 
ivory tower, and for writing to please one reader alone-- one's 
own self. But one also needs some reverberation, if not 
response, and a moderate multiplication of one's self 
throughout a country or countries; and if there be nothing but 
a void around one's desk, one would expect it to be at least a 
sonorous void, and not circumscribed by the walls of a padded 
cell. With the passing of years I grew less and less interested 
in Russia and more and more indifferent to the once-harrowing 
thought that my books would remain banned there as long as my 
contempt for the police state and political oppression 
prevented me from entertaining the vaguest thought of return. 
No, I will not write another novel in Russian, though I do 
allow myself a very few short poems now and then. I wrote my 
last Russian novel a quarter of a century ago. But today, in 
compensation, in a spirit of justice to my little American 
muse, I am doing something else. But perhaps I should not talk 
about it at this early stage. 
Please do. 
Well, it occurred to me one day-- while I was glancing at 
the varicolored spines of Lolita translations into 
languages I do not read, such as Japanese, Finnish or Arabic--
that the list of unavoidable blunders in these fifteen or 
twenty versions would probably make, if collected, a fatter 
volume than any of them. I had checked the French translation, 
which was basically very good yet would have bristled with
