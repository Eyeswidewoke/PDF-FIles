right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any). subject to 
applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following 
such redemption. subject to the approval of our remaining 
stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate: 
subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide 
for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. 
There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with 
respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to 
complete our business combination within the 24-month time period. 
Our initial stockholder has entered into a letter agreement with us, 
pursuant to which it has waived its rights to liquidating distributions 
from the trust account with respect to its founder shares if we fail to 
complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the 
closing of this offering. However, if our initial stockholder acquires 
public shares in or after this offering, it (along with any of our 
officers, directors or affiliates who acquire public share during or 
after this offering) will be entitled to liquidating distributions from 
the trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to 
complete our initial business combination within the allotted 24-
month time frame. The underwriters have agreed to waive their rights 
to their deferred underwriting commission held in the trust account in 
the event we do not complete our initial business combination within 
24 months from the closing of this offering and, in such event, such 
amounts will be included with the funds held in the mast account that 
will be available to fund the redemption of our public shares. 
Our sponsor, executive officers, directors and director nominees have 
agreed. pursuant to a letter agreement with us, that they will not 
propose any amendment to our amended and restated certificate of 
incorporation that would affect the substance or timing of our 
obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not 
complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the 
closing of this offering. unless we provide our public stockholders 
with the opportunity to redeem their shares of common stock upon 
approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in 
cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust 
account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes 
payable) divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. 
However, we may not redeem our public shares in an amount that 
would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so 
that we are not subject to the SEC's "penny stock" rules).
