=ifficult for her in any way. I asked, because as a faculty member =nd department chair I was interested in knowing 
what we could do, if =ecessary to encourage more women to go into physics, and also because =s someone she had 
asked for career advice from I wanted to know if that =ade a difference to her. Re asking her for dinner.. I have gone 
=ack over emails from that period. I have numerous requests from her =sking me to go for coffee to talk, which I usually 
had to turn down =ecause I was busy, and on several occasions she asked me to have coffee =ith her off campus to talk, 
and I politely declined. I did let =er accompany me off campus one time to watch me do a BBC interview =ecause she 
specifically requested it, and I believe she found it =seful. I did and do have coffee and meals with students on =ampus, 
and I see nothing wrong with this. I try to treat students =s respected colleagues if possible. I was shocked when I later 
=earned of the complaint she was apparently asked to lodge to the =niversity, not least because there was no 
inappropriate interaction but =lso because, well after the dates you listed on which she was =pparently offended, she 
continued to email me with joking questions or =omments. Also, at a later AAAS conference, again in 2008, =or which 
she had asked, and for which I had written her a letter of =ecommendation to attend, my wife and I gave her a lift in our 
taxi well =ut out of our way in order to drop her off at her hotel, and I note in =n email response to her email about the 
conference, again in 2008, I =xpressed that I would pass her regards along to my wife and vice versa. =nbsp;When the 
University later informed me of the complaint I was =hocked and concerned. When I spoke to the human resources 
=erson, including relating my concerns and explaining the situation, I =as told that no formal complaint of sexual 
harassment was requested. =nbsp;By that time I learned of the complaint I had already announced my =ntentions to 
leave Case to accept an offer at ASU—a very =ifficult decision for me because of my long-standing attachment to the 
=niversity, the excellent relations I had with my colleagues there—=both among the faculty (many of whom in physics I 
had hired while =epartment chair)) and among the administration, along with a very =ttractive counter-offer by Case. 
Because I was already in Arizona =t the later time I was asked not to have any further interaction with =he student I 
agreed to that request, both to respect her sensitivities =nd also because it was basically moot because I was not on 
campus. =ollowing this episode, as indicated in the letter to the student, I did =ssess what might have led to 
misinterpretations by this student, and =ecame more careful in offering advice when talking to students. I =as also told 
by human resources that because it was decided to handle =his informally and not formally, that (a) it should remain 
=onfidential, which I, at least abided by, and (b) if no further =omplaints were lodged in that case, that the University 
would preserve =ts confidentiality and remove the complaint from my record after 5 =ears, which makes me surprised 
and concerned that someone violated that =ritten agreement with you. 
Re item 6: You report on ASU'= response to item #6 , without including the fact that the University =pecifically stated 
there were never any allegations of sexual =isconduct or harassment by me at the University, and moreover that the 
=outside complaints' were in fact related specifically to your item #6. =nbsp; Further you neglect to mention that this 
complaint was by an =nonymous third party, not the individual who was allegedly harassed, =ho never lodged a 
complaint, and that no specific evidence was provided =f the alleged transgression. I was surprised and dismayed that 
=oth ASU and ANU launched investigations on the basis of this but was =old by both Universities that because of my high 
profile even such =nsubstantiated third party complaints at private events unrelated to =he University would be 
investigated. The complaint was =nvestigated by both ASU and ANU and both came to the conclusion =hat it was not 
credible and no university policies had been violated. =nbsp;ln addition ANU's investigation, which took a full month, 
=ound various inconsistencies in the allegation, which suggest =istortion and fabrication, I will quote from the ANU 
report. The =nitial complaint, which in fact resulted in a temporary suspension of =y position at ANU until it was 
dismissed, outlined the claim you made =n the words you quoted in your note to me, but it also =tated 
"It=is the University's understanding that a complaint was =odged directly to the conference organisers at the time of 
the =ncident." 
After the month-long investigation, during which I was told I =as not to interact with anyone on campus (again moot 
because I was a =emisphere removed) the final report, from which I quote below absolved =e of any wrongdoing, 
reinstating my position, and indicated information =nconsistent with the original claim and apparent later =laims: 
"The =llegations were made by an observer to the incident. 
- The =omplaint did not identify, nor disclose the identity of the conference =ttendee who was allegedly touched in an 
=nwelcome manner.
