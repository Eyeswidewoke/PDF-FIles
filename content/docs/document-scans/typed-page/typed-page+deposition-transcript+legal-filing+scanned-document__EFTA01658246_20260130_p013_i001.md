political stunt designed to undercut an investigation that dogged Trump's presidency." As the

October surprise, and Republicans wondering whether Durham's work could push into the next

Collins Insists Barr Has "Every Right" To Release Durham Report Before Election. 
Fox News (7/29, Kaplan, 27.59M) reports Rep. Doug Collins (R-GA) "told 'Outnumbered 
Overtime' on Wednesday that Attorney General Barr has 'every right' to release the results of 
Durham's investigation into the Russia probe's origins before the 2020 election." Rep. Debbie 
Mucarsel-Powell (D-FL) asked Barr, "Under oath, do you commit to not releasing any report by 
Mr. Durham before the November election?" The attorney general responded, "No," Mucarsel-
Powell asked, "So you won't go by Department of Justice policy that you won't interfere in any 
political investigation before the November election?" Barr insisted, "We won't interfere. In fact, 
I made it clear I'm not going to tolerate it."

ZDNet (7/29, Kwan, 299K) reports, "Fresh off dismissing spying charges against two former 
Twitter employees and another individual on Tuesday, the US government has unfurled a new 
superseding indictment that accuses the three individuals of even more offences." ZDNet adds,

named Ahmed Almutairi were originally charged with fraudulently accessing private information 
and acting as illegal agents of a foreign government for allegedly spying on Twitter users critical 
of the Saudi royal family. This time around, the individuals have been charged with seven 
offences instead of two. The charges include acting as an agent for a foreign government 
without notice to the attorney general; conspiracy to commit wire fraud; wire fraud; money 
laundering; destruction, alteration, or falsification of records in federal investigations; aiding 
and abetting; and criminal forfeiture."

wire and passport fraud charges against a University of Arkansas professor who allegedly hid

Ang in May on a single charge of wire fraud for allegedly hiding his ties to the Chinese

failing to disclose close ties to the Chinese government and Chinese companies when he 
obtained federal grants. The university suspended the 63-year-old electrical engineering 
professor and removed him as director of the university's High Density Electronics Center after 
his May 8 arrest by federal agents. Ang is free on a $200,000 bond." 
The Arkansas Democrat Gazette (7/29, Adame, 307K) reports, "Simon Ang 'knowingly
