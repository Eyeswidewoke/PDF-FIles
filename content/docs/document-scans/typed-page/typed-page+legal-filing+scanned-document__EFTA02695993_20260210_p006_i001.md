with sucrose. Blood collection began with the nurse puncturing 
the skin of the prepped heel using a sterile, spring-loaded blade; 
squeezing of the heel to collect blood into a tube followed. Fol-
lowing blood collection and subsequent handling, including 
bandaging of the puncture site, the infants in the treatment 
group were stimulated with music for 10 minutes. 
Statistical Analysis 
After collecting data from 13 infants over 8 months, we examined 
our data using nonparametric statistics (Wilcoxon Signed-Rank 
Test) to compare the physiological-dependent variables before, 
during, and following the heel-stick procedure. Persistence or 
cessation of crying from the heel-slick to the recovery period 
was compared between the treatment and control groups using 
Pearson x 2 test. Given that we had tested our working hypothesis 
at this juncture. we ceased enrollment of additional infants.

Physiological Results 
Figure 2A-C illustrates HR, RR. and O2-sat population data, 
respectively, collected before and during heel stick and blood 
collection. There was a significant increase in HR from base-
line to blood collection (Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test [WSRT], 
Z = —2.36, P = .02); on average. HR increased 19%. All 
infants showed an HR increase of at least 5 beats per minute 
(bpm); in 8 (62%), HR went above normal limits (>160 bpm). 
There was no significant increase in HR coefficient of variation 
(CV) across the 2 epochs (WSRT. Z = —0.53, P = .60). 
There was a significant increase in RR from baseline to 
blood collection (WSRT, Z = —2.24, P = .02]; on average, 
RR increased 39%. All infants showed an increase of at least 
5 inspirations per minute (ipm); in 10 (77%), RR went above 
40 ipm. There was also a significant increase in RR CV (WSRT 
Z = —2.37, P =.02). 
There was no significant change in O2-sat from baseline 
to blood collection (WSRT, Z = -0.14, P = .89). The nadir 
02-sat fell below 90% for only 3 infants. There was no 
significant change in 02-sat CV (WSRT, Z= —1.07. P = .29). 
Figure 3A-C illustrates HR, RR, and 02-sat population 
data, respectively, collected during blood collection and the 
10-minute recovery period (Figure 3). In the treatment group, 
there was a significant decrease in HR across the 2 epochs 
(WSRT Z = —2.37, P = .02). On average, HR decreased 
17%. In 6 of the 7 infants (86%) in the treatment group, HR 
decreased by 10 bpm or more. In the control group, there was 
no significant change in HR (WSRT Z = —1.15, P = .25), aver-
age HR decreased only 6%, and only 3 of the 6 infants (50%) 
showed an HR decrease of 10 bpm or more. No significant 
change in HR variability during recovery versus blood collection 
was found for either the treatment group (WRST Z = -0.68, 
P = .50) or the control group (WSRT Z= —1.07, P =.29). There 
was no significant change in RR or RR CV from blood collection 
to recovery in either the treatment group (respectively, WSRT 
2 = -0.34. P =.74; 2 = -0.08, P = .93) or the control group 
(Z = —1.36, P = .17; = —0.94. P = .35). 
There was no significant change in 02-sat or 02-sat CV 
from blood collection to recovery in either the treatment group 
(respectively, WSRT Z = -0.17, P =.86; Z = -0.81, P = .42) 
or the control group (Z = —0.21, P = .83; Z = —0.37, P = .71). 
To further depict the time course of HR, RR, and 02-sat data 
across the various epochs of data collection, we present the 
results from a single premature infant in the treatment group 
(Figure 4). These are representative of data collected: (I) before 
and during heel stick and blood collection for the entire study 
population of 13 infants and (2) after blood collection for the 
population of 7 infants in the treatment group, who received 
controlled auditory stimulation with vocal music during the 
10-minute recovery period. This patient was a 2.6-kg male twin 
born at 34 weeks gestation with 1-min and 5-min Apgar scores 
of 9. He was admitted to the SCU after delivery with a
