The "Classic Five" Era 
In January 1964, Smokey Robinson and Miracles bandmate Bobby Rogers co-wrote and produced "The 
Way You Do the Things You Do" with Eddie Kendricks on lead and the single became the Temptations' 
first Top 20 hit that April. 
Shortly afterward, "The Way You Do The Things You Do" and several pre-David Ruffin singles were 
compiled into the group's first album, Meet The Temptations, released in early 1964. The next two 
Temptations singles in 1964, "Girl (Why You Wanna Make Me Blue)" along with "I'll Be in Trouble" and 
its B-side 'The Girl's Alright With Me", all featured Kendricks on lead. However, producer Smokey 
Robinson saw potential in the "mellow" yet "gruff" voice of David Ruffin, and thought that if he could 
write the perfect song for his lead, then the group could have a Top 10 hit. 
While traveling as part of Motown's Motortown Revue later that year, Robinson and fellow Miracles 
member Ronnie White wrote "My Girl", which the Temptations recorded in the fall of 1964 with Ruffin 
singing his first lead vocal for the group. Released as a single on December 21, 1964, the song became 
the Temptations' first number-one pop hit in March 1965, and is their signature song to this day. 
After the success of "My Girl", Ruffin sang lead on the next three singles: "It's Growing", "Since I Lost My 
Baby", and "My Baby", all of which made it to the Top 20 in 1965. The B-side to "My Baby", "Don't Look 
Back", featured a stirring lead from Paul Williams, and was a sleeper hit on the R&B charts and a 
standard for vocal group playlists. 
Norman Whitfield had requested the opportunity to write for the group and in 1966, Berry Gordy 
promised him that if Robinson's "Get Ready", with Eddie Kendricks on lead, failed to chart in the Top 20, 
Whitfield would be allowed to produce the next song. "Get Ready" subsequently missed its mark, and 
Gordy issued the Whitfield-produced "Ain't Too Proud to Beg", with David Ruffin on lead, as the next 
single. "Ain't Too Proud to Beg" outperformed "Get Ready" on the Billboard charts, and Whitfield 
became the Temptations' new main producer. He began pulling the group away from the ballad-based 
productions espoused by Robinson, toward a harder-edged and brass-heavy soul sound reminiscent of 
James Brown. 
Nearly all of the singles produced by Whitfield prior to 1968 featured David Ruffin on lead, including the 
R&B number-one/pop Top 10 hits "Beauty Is Only Skin Deep", "(I Know) I'm Losing You"(14] and the 
early 1967 hit "(Loneliness Made Me Realize) It's You That I Need". Other important singles from this 
period include "All I Need", produced by Frank Wilson, a Whitfield protégé, and the "You're My 
Everything", on which Kendricks and Ruffin share lead. Studio albums during the "Classic Five" period 
apart from Meet The Temptations include The Temptations Sing Smokey (1965), The Temptin' 
Temptations (1965), Gettin' Ready (1966), The Temptations with a Lot o' Soul (1967), and The 
Temptations Wish It Would Rain (1968). 
During this period, the various songwriting partners of Norman Whitfield included Roger Penzabene, 
Edward Holland, Jr., and Temptations road show manager and guitarist Cornelius Grant. Subsequently, 
Barrett Strong, who sang the very first hit at Motown in 1959, "Money (That's What I Want)", began
