President "hurled insults at Democrats and mused aloud about short-circuiting the talks and 
acting on his own." According to the Times, "while White House officials say that he is 
interested in the talks and closely monitoring them," the President "has not sought to use the 
full powers of his office to prod a deal, and more often he has complicated the already sensitive 
negotiations." The Washington Post (8/3, Al, Werner, Stein, 14.2M) reports that when "asked 
why he wasn't taking part in the talks, Trump insisted that he was involved but didn't need to 
be physically on Capitol Hill to participate. `I'm totally involved, I'm totally involved; Trump 
said." 
On Monday, the New York Post (8/3, Nelson, Bowden, 4.57M) reports, Trump "said he will 
take executive action to halt evictions if Congress doesn't quickly pass coronavirus relief 
legislation." Trump told reporters, "A lot of people are going to be evicted. But I'm going to stop 
it because I'll do it myself if I have to. I have a lot of powers with respect to executive orders. 
And we're looking at that very seriously right now." Breitbart (8/3, Spiering, 673K) reports 
Trump faulted Pelosi and Democrats, saying, "What the Democrats want, they're slow-rolling it 
and all they're really interested in is bailout money to bail out radical left governors and radical 
left mayors." 
White House Counselor Kellyanne Conway said on Fox News' Outnumbered Overtime 
(8/3), "Last week, the Republicans put on the table that the White House is willing to go for an 
additional $600 benefit for one week, because that was expiring July 31. Lo and behold, the 
Democrats said no, because their eye is not on your rent or mortgage payment this month. 
Their eye is on November 3 and the elections, and they want this to be cudgel." NexstarVi (8/3, 
20K) showed a clip of Conway saying, "For the Democrats now to say, `Oh, the Republicans got 
in the way,' that's just a flat-out lie." 
Politico (8/3, Bresnahan, Levine, 4.29M) says White House officials have also "floated for 
days that Trump could take executive action to address some of the economic damage from the 
coronavirus pandemic," and that "may involve presidential orders to delay the collection of 
federal payroll taxes or extend a moratorium on student loan payment, among other options." 
However, M  Roll Call (8/3, Sword, 154K) says tax policy experts "doubt that [Trump] has the 
authority to unilaterally suspend payroll tax collections." USA Today (8/3, Hayes, 10.31M) also 
says "it is not clear whether Trump has the power to make such a move, and it would likely be 
challenged legally." 
The Washington Times (8/3, Swoyer, 492K) reports Senate Majority Leader McConnell 
"charged Democrats on Capitol Hill are insisting publicly they want to reach an outcome for the 
fifth round of coronavirus relief but are actually working to ensure a bipartisan agreement isn't 
reached." McConnell said, "The Speaker of the House and the Democratic [Senate] leader are 
continuing to say `my way or the highway." The Washington Times (8/3, Munoz, 492K) reports 
Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) on Monday "said he plans to introduce an amendment that would 
cap boosted unemployment benefits at 100% of a worker's previous wages," saying he hopes 
Democrats will see that as acceptable. However, McClatchy (8/3, Chambers, Lightman, 19K) 
says conservative GOP senators are also an impediment, "resisting efforts from the White 
House and Senate Republican leadership to fashion a broad economic stimulus deal." 
Bloomberg (8/3, Mohsin, Jacobs, Wasson, 4.73M) and The Hill (8/3, Bolton, 2.98M) are among 
the other outlets covering the talks, while NBC Nightly NewsVi (8/3, story 10, 2:10, Holt, 
6.23M) aired a feature on one family struggling to get by even with the $600 weekly aid. 
Top Executives Urge Congress To Aid Small Businesses. The Washington Post (8/3, 
Shaban, 14.2M) reports, "The top executives of more than 100 companies - including 
Starbucks, Microsoft and Mastercard - and trade groups are calling on Congress to backstop 
small businesses facing economic calamity." In a letter to congressional leaders of both parties, 
the group led by ex-Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz "calls for federally guaranteed loans to last 
into 2021; flexibility in how that money is put to use; and at least partial loan forgiveness for 
the hardest-hit companies. It also said `funds must flow to all small business in need, 
particularly those run by people of color,' who have historically had less access to capital." The
