FX Blueprint: Forever Young 
Theme #2: Brussels sprouts - sell GBP vs USD & SEK 
• 
Stretched valuation, unsustainably large capital 
inflows and renewed political risks spell the end for 
the sterling uptrend. 
• 
Stay short GBP/USD as Fed and Bank of England 
policy diverges. Short GBP/SEK also makes sense 
from a relative value perspective. 
Sterling has far outshone its peers since the start of the 
dollar uptrend in April 2011. The pound has fallen just 
7% against the greenback versus a 30% move in the 
broad USD TWI (figure 1), with only the Korean won 
doing better among floating rate currencies. There are 
now plenty of reasons to think outperformance is over. 
The pound is expensrve 
First, sterling is expensive on several metrics. Two year 
rate spreads suggest cable closer to the low 1.40s. The 
cross has also closely tracked the relative number of 
months between a US and UK tightening cycle, which 
also imply downside based on current market pricing. 
Using a medium run valuation framework, the currency 
is the most expensive among all the majors on a 
combined PPP, BEER and FEER basis. 
Record capital inflows may not be sustained 
Second, it is doubtful whether the huge capital inflows 
the UK has generated and seen the current account 
deficit widen to the largest in history can be sustained. 
As figure 3 shows, these have been very sensitive to 
the UK's relative growth rank with other developed 
economies. Britain has fallen from the top of the pack 
back in 2014 to number four today, and will drop to 
number six if the softer growth momentum implied by 
GDP revisions in Q3 December endures. 
Drilling down into flows, robust net direct investment 
was boosted by record M&A inflows last year. This 
may be difficult to repeat given rising US interest rates 
and renewed focus by US authorities on tax inversion 
deals. Most of the inflows, though, have been portfolio, 
broadly balanced between equity and debt. For the 
former, EFPR data suggests that healthy inflows in O2 
and Q3 have turned. On the latter, fixed income inflows 
have been highly sensitive to relative monetary policy 
stances, with the UK one of the largest beneficiaries of 
the compression of term premia from ECB QE. But 
monetary policy divergence may have peaked, with the 
prospects of more ECB easing seemingly off the table 
for the first half of next year, while the Bank of England 
has become much more cautious about tightening. 
Fiscal and monetary tightening may prove a challenge 
Growth risks appear skewed to the downside too. The 
UK is set to undergo renewed austerity next year. At 
1.3% GDP, fiscal tightening is less than previously 
forecast, yet will still be the largest of major developed 
economies. A sharp increase in fiscal tightening may 
be the 'hidden' reason growth has slowed this year and 
a further pick-up could put rate hikes on ice indefinitely. 
IGBP has outperformed almost every other currency
