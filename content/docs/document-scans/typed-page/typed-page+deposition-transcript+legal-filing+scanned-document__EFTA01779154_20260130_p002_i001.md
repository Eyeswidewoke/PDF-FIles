name," he has sa=d. "I did stores.") He soon dropped out and began pitchin= in at his parents' store, where he 
discovered that the business=profited most by selling skirts, sweaters, shirts, and blouses—ty=ical sportswear 
separates—not by selling dresses and coats, as hi= father believed. 
It was the entrepreneurial epiphany for a store=that Wexner, then 26, wanted to call Leslie's Limited and refocus=to sell 
women's sportswear separates. Wexner had been an entrepre=eur since he was 9 (early for-profit ventures include 
cutting grass, shov=ling snow, and selling stationery, T-shirts, and toys), but the months be=ore the opening of The 
Limited in 1963 were harrowing. He had recurring=nightmares and was diagnosed with an ulcer. Wexner, as his parents 
had,=invested inordinate hours, working from 7 a.m. to midnight, washing the=store's windows and doing his own 
bookkeeping. But it was his ide= that paid off the most. Women wanted separates and appreciated a new, mo=e 
modern way of buying clothing. Wexner opened another five stores in the=following years and took the business public 
in 1969. Ten years later, he=had 300 Limited stores and began to demonstrate an appetite for acquisiti=ns, buying and 
growing brands like Lane Bryant. 
It was on a business trip in San Francisco in=1982 that Wexner discovered Victoria's Secret, founded by Roy Ray=ond, a 
Stanford M.B.A. graduate. "It was a small store, and it wa= Victorian—not English Victorian, but brothel Victorian with 
red=velvet sofas," says Wexner. "There wasn't erotic=lingerie, but there was very sexy lingerie, and I hadn't seen 
any=hing like it in the U.S." Months later, with Victoria's=Secret on the verge of bankruptcy, Raymond called Wexner 
and asked if he=wanted to buy the company. Wexner got on a plane to San Francisco that da= and agreed to purchase 
the four stores and a catalog for $1 million. 
Wexner says he had "intuition"=that it would be a good business, but he didn't know anything abo=t lingerie and he had 
no immediate plans for the company. He had just bou=ht Lane Bryant and was growing a new brand, Express. 
"[Victoria=E2 s Secret] didn't make any money," he says, =9Cbut I saw ingredients in it. What if we mixed it up 
differently? =9D Wexner then began thinking—as a bachelor. (He got married abou= 10 years later.) "Most of the 
women that I knew wore underwear=most of the time, and most of the women that I knew I thought would rathe= wear 
lingerie most of the time, but there were no lingerie stores, =9D he says. "I thought if we could develop price points and 
produ=ts that have a broader base of customer, it could be something big. =9D The company moved Victoria's Secret 
to=its headquarters in Columbus and infused the brand with its retail expert=se—boosting the selection of merchandise 
from just one model of=everything to a large assortment with colors and textiles that related to=the fashion industry. It 
focused on consistency of fit, which created cus=omer loyalty. The company expanded nationally, opening its boudoir-
style=stores in areas in which it had catalog customers. "The marketing=was pretty primitive," says Wexner, "but it 
worked. =9D They finessed the formula, moving bras and fitt=ng rooms from the front to the back of the store ("Being in 
the=front made for some odd moments flashing the world," says Wexner.="We had to take the fact that people were in 
their birthday suits=into consideration.") They played classical music and soon custom=rs began requesting the 
compilations, and the company began to sell CDs.=The famous fashion show, with legendary supermodels strutting in 
lavishly=jeweled bras and feathered wings, became a cultural moment. A steamy comm=rcial during the 1999 Super 
Bowl sent millions of visitors to the Victori='s Secret Web site, and a billion people in 100 countries logged=on to watch 
the show. 
"The great thing that Wexner did was re=ognize the huge white space in the market that was unspoken for, and 
he=brought in innovation," says Craig Johnson, president of Customer=Growth Partners, a retail consultancy in New 
Canaan, Conn. "He ma=e sexy mainstream. That was his genius." But Wexner, still a rese=ved Midwesterner who has 
been the chairman and CEO of the company =94now known as Limited Brands and including brands such as Bath and 
Body=Works, Pink, La Senza, and Henri Bendel—for more than 45 years,=doesn't see anything "genius" about it. "= 
didn't invent anything. I didn't invent the bra or store= or the name," he says. "I just see things differently.=E2 Still, 
when it comes to how women think about the most pragmatic=items they wear, that's made all the difference.
