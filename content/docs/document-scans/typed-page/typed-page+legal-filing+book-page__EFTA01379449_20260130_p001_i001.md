Which EM currencies will lag? 
The main risks to EM FX are USE) strength (and FX-
hedging induced by a surge in US ratusi and a (nolo 
dtornatic slowdown in C€:ine. In terms of timing, 
although dovish current pricing could trigger some 
bouts of rates repricing earlier in the year, we expect 
inflation and policy risks to build in the latter part of the 
year and especially in 2019 when output gaps will be 
much narrower. Bear in mind that QE unwinding will 
be very gradual with net core CB purchases until 2019. 
:3 our economists expect growth to slow in the 
first half of 2018 due to property and financial sector 
tightening (which is already underway). However, 
despite an expected slowdown from current elevated

levels, growth is forecasted to remain above 6% in Hl; 
moreover, it is expected to then rebound back towards 
6.5% later in the year on renewed policy loosening. As 
such it is unlikely to derail EM FX appreciation. 
A repeat of - tantrum(' seems very unlikely and we see 
the possible bouts of repricirel as comparable rc those 
of 2017. EM real rates have improved this year and 
they will likely continue to improve in 2018. Compared 
to 2013, for example, real rates are higher, external 
imbalances reduced and FX reserves are greater. 
Further, real rates could rise next year for a number of 
EMs as there is less room for accommodation in 2018. 
Asia is where tightening begins, but across most EM 
the easing cycles are coming to a close. 
Higher real rates vs. 2013, especially for high-yielders

Also, despite recent inflows. positioning remains a lot 
lighter when compared with pre-GFC and pre-tantrum 
levels (chart). Local markets (and equities, in particular) 
have yet to refill as EM grows.

When we narrow the focus on domestic developments, 
valuations or enamel vulnerabilities we believe that 
COP, Nit, and ILS will lag. LatAm is naturally most 
exposed to a China slowdown (less so MXN in this 
case).
