IN THE NEWS 
President Trump Takes Victory Lap in Speech to Congress, Democrats Protest 
Reuters (03/05, Oliphant, Mason, Slattery) and the Associated Press (03/04, Goldin) reported that President Donald 
Trump delivered a 100-minute-long televised speech to Congress that largely focused on domestic policy rather 
than foreign affairs. He made brief mentions of Ukraine, the Middle East, and national security, reiterating past 
positions and announcing a critical minerals deal with Ukraine and the detention of a terrorism suspect. Much of 
his address highlighted his conservative agenda, including proposed tax cuts, a border bill, and various executive 
orders on social issues. The speech prompted protests from Democrats, some of whom left the chamber, and 
skepticism regarding Trump's handling of inflation and overall economic concerns. Overall, his approval ratings 
remained around 44%, indicating lingering doubts among the public. Fox News (03/04, Colton) reported 
that President Trump declared that "America is back" in his speech. The article highlighted President Trump's 
claims that his administration had accomplished more in 43 days than most administrations accomplish in four or 
eight years. The Associated Press (03/04, Video) also published a video with President Trump saluting Director Patel 
and AG Bondi during the speech. Additional reporting on the story was provided by ABC News (03/04, Hoffman),

President Trump Says U.S. Has Apprehended 'Top Terrorist' 
CNN (03/04, Rabinowitz, Cohen, et al.) reported that President Trump announced in his joint address to Congress 
that the U.S. is transporting a "top terrorist" involved in the 2021 bombing at Kabul airport's Abbey Gate in 
Afghanistan. 13 U.S. service members and at least 170 Afghan civilians were killed. According to the article, 
Mohammad Sharifullah, is being charged with providing and conspiring to provide material support for 
terrorism. "Tonight, I am pleased to announce that we have just apprehended the top terrorist responsible for that 
atrocity, and he is right now on his way here to face the swift sword of American justice," Trump said. The article 
also quoted Director Patel's post on X: "As President Trump just announced, I can report that tonight the FBI, DOJ, 
and CIA have extradited one of the terrorists responsible for the murder of the 13 American soldiers at Abbey Gate 
during the disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal. One step closer to justice for these American heroes and their 
families." Additional reporting on the story was provided by Associated Press (03/04, Tucker, Miller), Axias (03/04,
