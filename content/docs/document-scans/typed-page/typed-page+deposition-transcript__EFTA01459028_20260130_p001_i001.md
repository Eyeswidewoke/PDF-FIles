The MSCI IPD OFIX Germany 
Index rose again in October 
and the upwards trend in 
German home prices - now 
evident for several years -
looks likely to continue. We 
believe that interest rates 
should remain very low 
and wage growth, adjusted 
for inflation, has reached 
the highest level since 
this quarterly series was 
introduced in 2008. Fiscal 
policy is not restrictive, either. 
At present, the housing market 
does not show the typical 
characteristics of a "bubble", 
with mortgage-financing 
growth remaining moderate.

Rising U.S. consumer 
confidence has yet to translate 
into strong gains in overall 
retail sales - according to 
advance estimates from the 
U.S. Commerce Department. 
sales rose only 0.1% between 
September and October to a 
level just 1.2% higher than a 
year previously But leisure-
related spending may be 
rising faster: sales at food 
services and drinking places 
were up 5.5% in October on 
a year earlier. Airline stocks, 
an important part of the 
PowerShares Dynamic Leisure 
and Entertainment Portfolio, 
have also risen recently 
although this rise could be 
reversed by recent terrorist 
incidents.

O 
We remain generally positive 
on the U.S. high-yield market. 
although aware of the 
potential impact volatility in 
the energy and metals-and-
mining sectors could have:on 
the overall market. We believe 
that euro high-yield offers a 
good risk/return combination 
and is likely to benefit from 
further QE in Europe, as well 
as from not having much 
exposure to oil and gas. 
Overall, while U.S. high-yield 
has the higher upside potential 
due to higher spreads, euro 
high-yield should have less 
fundamental risk. 
' Relative-return idea, based 
on the relative performance 
of the two measures in U.S. 
dollars. Stated performance 
is from given entry thlte to 
11/12/2015. 
Total-return idea where 
performance is measured 
by the gain/loss in the 
performance measure in U.S.
dollars. Stated performance 
is from given entry chits to 
11/12/2015. 
High-conviction ideas may not 
be suitable for all investors. 
Investments coma with risk. 
The value of an investment 
can fall as wallas rise and your 
capital may be at risk. You 
might not get back the amount 
originally invested at any point 
in time. Some investments 
may not be suitable for all 
investors and investors 
should seek professional 
advice before investing. The 
examples above are shown for 
illustrative purposes only and 
should not be considered to be 
an offer or solicitation, advice 
or recommendation. It is not 
possible to invest directly in an 
index.
