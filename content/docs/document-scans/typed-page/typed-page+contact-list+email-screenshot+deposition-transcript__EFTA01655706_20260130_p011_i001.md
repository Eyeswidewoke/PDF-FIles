FBI Daily News Briefing 
formed, there are no plans for anyone in its leadership to address the main annual gathering of the nation's 
secretaries of state, which was being held this week in Washington. On Thursday, a panel on cyberthreats included 
an update from an FBI official who said the threats remained consistent. The article quoted Cynthia Kaiser, a 
deputy assistant director in the Bureau's Cyber Division, who said, "I'm often asked what the FBI sees as the top 
cyberthreats facing the U.S., and really the FBI's answer for the last several years has been the same: China, China, 
China, ransomware, Russia, Iran, North Korea." Trump's new homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, said during 
her Senate hearing that CISA had strayed "far off mission." She pledged to work with senators "should you wish to 
rein them in" with legislation. The article mentioned that the agency formed in 2018 during the first Trump 
administration is charged with protecting the nation's critical infrastructure, from dams and nuclear power plants 
to banks and voting systems. It is under the Department of Homeland Security, but CISA is a separate agency with 
its own Senate-confirmed director. The agency has received bipartisan praise from many state and local election 
officials, but Trump and his allies remain angry over its efforts to counter misinformation about the 2020 
presidential election and the coronavirus pandemic. The agency's first director, Chris Krebs, was fired by Trump 
after Krebs highlighted a statement issued by a group of election officials that called the 2020 election the "most 
secure in American history." That drew Trump's ire as he was contesting his loss to Democrat Joe Biden. 
Republicans have claimed repeatedly since then that CISA had worked with social media companies to censor 
conservative viewpoints on issues related to elections and health. Agency officials have disputed that: "CISA does 
not censor, has never censored," the agency's then-director, Jen Easterly, said last fall in an interview with the 
Associated Press. Nevertheless, Republicans continue to blame the agency and insist changes are necessary.

LABORATORY 
Man Identified 33 Years After Being Found Stabbed to Death in Boston Harbor 
WBTS (NBC-10) (01/30, Staff Writers) reported that investigators have identified a man whose body was found 
more than 33 years ago in Boston Harbor. The article specified that the man, originally found stabbed to death on 
December 4, 1991, near Thompson Island, has been identified as Toussaint Gonsalves, who was 21 at the time of 
his death. According to the article, the Boston Police Department, in collaboration with the FBI's Boston office and 
its Violent Crimes Task Force, used investigative genetic genealogy to identify Gonsalves. Gonsalves' murder, which 
was ruled a homicide by autopsy, is still under investigation. The article added that the FBI Laboratory created two 
images to depict what Gonsalves may have looked like, and these images, along with other information, have been 
added to the FBI's Violent Criminal Apprehension Program (ViCAP) database. The article noted that police suggest 
that Gonsalves may have been living in Dorchester or Newton, Massachusetts, and possibly worked as a kitchen 
worker.

INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS 
DO1 Partners With Dutch Police to Break up Heartsender Network 
CYBERSCOOP (01/30, Otto) reported that authorities in the United States and the Netherlands have dismantled a 
sophisticated Pakistan-based cybercrime network known as Saim Raza. The operation, dubbed "Operation Heart 
Blocker," culminated Wednesday with the coordinated seizure of 39 domains and servers. Also known as 
HeartSender, Saim Raza was responsible for developing and selling phishing kits, with the Department of Justice 
claiming the software resulted in over $3 million in victim losses. The article added that HeartSender's network 
operated through a vast array of criminal web shops, advertising its malicious tools across platforms like YouTube. 
The group specialized in selling an arsenal of tools — including phishing kits, cookie grabbers, and other tools to 
power spam campaigns — that enabled users to send vast amounts of phishing emails, steal login credentials, and 
access hacked infrastructure. This global operation attracted thousands of customers seeking to exploit digital 
vulnerabilities, offering access to services like cPanels, SMTP servers, and WordPress accounts. The investigation 
uncovered datasets containing millions of victim records, including approximately 100,000 sets of Dutch 
credentials. The article noted that aside from police, the group has been on the radar of cybersecurity researchers 
for the past decade. A story from independent journalist Brian Krebs detailed the group's sloppy operations, 
including malware infections within their own network and security lapses in their HeartSender services, which
