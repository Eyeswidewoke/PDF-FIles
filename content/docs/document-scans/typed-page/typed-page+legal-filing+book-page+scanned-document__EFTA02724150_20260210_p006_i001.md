discount was applicable. it should have been equally obvious that, in the absence of any evidentiary basis whatsoever• there is no 
viable factual or legal support for the court's own nominal 10 percent discount. This is particularly ironical when viewed in the light of 
the Tax Court's correct distinction of this case from, among others. Estate of Scull v. Commissioner. 67 T.C.M. (CCH) 2953 
(1994). and Stone v. United States. No. 06-0259. 2007 WI. 2318974. at •3 (N.D. Cal. Aug. 10. 2007). The courts in both of 
those cases awarded nominal discounts, but, as the Tax Court noted, they were only awarded "because of a lack of proof [by the 
taxpayer) that any greater discount was warranted." But the exact opposite situation is present here: The Estate, as taxpayer, 
presented all of the discount evidence, and a surfeit at that. further eschewing the piowisty of a nominal discount. 
At oral argument, appellate counsel for the Commissioner insisted that the Tax Court's sole reason for rejecting the discounts determined 
by the Estate's experts was their failure to include, or assign sufficient weight to, the Elkins heirs' strong emotional ("psychic") 
attachment to the family's works of an. Counsel claimed that the court faulted those experts for not concluding that, in and of itself, 
such psychic attachment would guarantee the hypothetical willing buyer a virtually undiscounted purchase price for the Decedent's 
fractional interests, regardless of those heirs strong legal and financial positions as putative hostile co-owners with such a 
hypothetical willing buyer. According to Commissioner's counsel. this is what led the Tax Court to reject the expert's discounts out of 
hand. We disagree with counsel's cherry picking of the Tax Court's analysis. But even if counsel's reading of the Tax Court's reasoning 
were correct, it would not absolve that court of clear error. 
We have again reviewed the entire transcript of the testimony of the Estate's experts and their written reports. and we are satisfied 
beyond cavil that they considered and correctly weighed all factors and characteristics of the Elkins heirs when determining how 
much a hypothetical willing buyer would pay for Decedent's fractional interests and thus become a co-owner with them. Those 
experts took into account both the pros and the cons: the children's financial astuteness and their net worths: their hypothetical desire 
to acquire Decedent's fractional interests if a hypothetical willing buyer should acquire them first, but also their uncontradicted 
testimony that they would do so only for a "fair price," as determined by experts (presumably those who testified for them); their legal 
and financial ability to prevent any hypothetical willing buyer from quickly "flipping" his fractional interests in the art to third parties, 
particularly given the heirs' contractual restraints on alienation and partition, as well as their predictable determination to rid 
themselves of unrelated co-owners regardless of how much time it might take. In sum, we do not read the Tax Court to have rejected 
the importance of all aspects of the children's legal relationships to the art other than their "psychic" interests. 
We repeat for emphasis that the Estate's uncontradicted. unimpeached. and eminently credible evidence in support of its proffered 
fractionalownership discounts is not just a "preponderance" of such evidence: it is the only such evidence. Nowhere is there any 
evidentiary support for the Tax Court's unsubstantiated declaration that "a 10% discount would enable a hypothetical buyer to assure 
himself or herself °fa reasonable profit on a resale of those interests to the Elkins children." Besides the error in logic of presuming 
that the hypothetical willing buyer must turn right around and sell his fractional purchases to those heirs, we cannot escape the 
conclusion that, under the facts of this case and the way the panics tried it, such a determination constitutes reversible error under any 
standard of review. 
S. Correct Quantum of Fractional-Du nership Discounts 
In turning to the question of the appropriate quantum of discount, the Tax Court acknowledged that (I) only the Estate's experts 
thoroughly analyzed the extent of the discount. (2) the relevant testimony of the Commissioner's expert Ms. Hanus-McManus boiled 
down to the single fact that there is no "recognized" market for fractional interests in art, and (3) the several coowners' agreements 
that regulated and restricted alienation, partition, and possession of essentially all of the an are distinguishable from such 
arrangements among persons engaged in arm's length, for-profit, art transactions. We agree. In fact, this increases the level of our 
comfort in concluding that nothing in the testimony of the Commissioner's experts, in his appellate brief, or in his appellate counsel's 
oral argument, detracts from or calls into question the Estate's unilateral discount evidence." 
" Indeed, the testimony of Ms. Hanus-McManus that there is no recognized or established market for undivided interests in art lends 
support to a grader discount. The absence of an established market would be a factor that a willing buyer would consider as calling 
for a deeper discount of fractional interests in art. Such absence does not, however, mean that willing buyers and willing sellers of 
fractional interests in art do not exist and cannot find one another through means other than an established market, e.g., eBay, art 
galleries, art dealers networks, conventions, social networking, and the like. 
It is principally within the last few pages of its opinion that the fax Court's reversible error lies. While continuing to advocate the willing 
buyerlwilling seller test that controls this case, the Tax Court inexplicably veers off course, focusing almost exclusively on its 
perception of the role of "the Elkins children" as owners of the remaining fractional interests in the works of an and giving short shrill 
to the time and expense that a successful willing buyer would face in litigating the restraints on alienation and possession and 
otherwise outwaiting those particular co-owners. Moreover, the Elkins heirs are neither hypothetical willing buyers nor hypothetical 
willing sellers, any more than the Estate is deemed to be the hypothetical willing seller. 
We acknowledge, of course—as did the Estate's experts—that a hypothetical willing buyer would be aware of and take into account all 
aspects of the remaining fractional interests in the art that the Elkins heirs owned, not just the likelihood of their hypothetical desire to 
acquire the Decedent's fractional interests in the an from any successful hypothetical buyer thereof. An objective reading of the 
entirety of those experts' written reports and their testimony at trial demonstrates beyond question that the heirs' financial strengths.
