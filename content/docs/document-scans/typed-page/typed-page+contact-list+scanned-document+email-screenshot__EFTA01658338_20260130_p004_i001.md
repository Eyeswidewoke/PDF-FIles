Barr Spars With Democrats At Contentious House Hearing. 
Media coverage of Attorney General Barr's testimony before the House Judiciary Committee 
highlighted the contentious exchanges between Barr and Democratic lawmakers, with ABC 
World News TonightVi (7/28, story 4, 3:00, Muir, 7.32M) and NBC Nightly NewsVi (7/28, story 
6, 2:00, Holt, 6.05M) describing the hearing as "heated," Politico (7/28, Cheney, Swan, 4.29M) 
as "disjointed and testy," and the New York Times (7/28, Fandos, Savage, Lafraniere, Qiu, 
18.61M) as "increasingly combative as the hours wore on." "Democrat after Democrat," adds 
the limes, posed "questions to Mr. Barr...only to cut him off when he tried to reply, substituting 
their own replies for his." The Times further recounts that "clearly frustrated, Mr. Barr 
complained at one point: `This is a hearing. I thought I was the one who was supposed to be 
heard.' At another point, after being reminded he was under oath," Barr "insisted, `I'm going to 
answer the damn question." 
Reports also highlight the AG's forceful defense of the government's efforts to quell what 
he cast as violent protests across the country. The AP (7/28, Tucker, Jalonick, Balsamo), for 
example, quotes Barr as saying that "violent rioters and anarchists have hijacked legitimate 
protests. ... Largely absent from these scenes of destruction are even superficial attempts by 
the rioters to connect their actions to George Floyd's death or any legitimate call for reform." 
The Washington Times (7/28, Al, Mordock, 492K) reports Barr also "called out Democrats' 
refusal to condemn the violence that has swept across Portland, Oregon, and other American 
cities," saying, "What makes me concerned for the country is this is the first time in my 
memory the leaders of one of our great two political parties, the Democratic Party, are not 
coming out and condemning mob violence and the attack on federal courts." 
There was, however, a marked ideological split on the focus of the reporting, with 
conservative publications highlighting Barr's description of the protesters' violence and most 
mainstream media outlets building their accounts around Democratic accusations against Barr, 
which described this way by Politico (7/28, Cheney, Swan, 4.29M), "Democrats went into the 
hearing intending to highlight a single theme: That Barr distorted the Justice Department in 
service of [President] Trump's political agenda." 
NBC Nightly NewsVi (7/28, story 6, 2:00, Holt, 6.05M) reported, for example, that 
"Democrats said the federal deployments are intended to give the President footage for 
campaign ads." Nadler was shown saying, "You are projecting fear and violence nationwide in
