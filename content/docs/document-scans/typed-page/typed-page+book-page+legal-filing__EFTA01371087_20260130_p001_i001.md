Flipping the Script - Buy CP, Sell CNI 
Initiating Coverage of Canadian Rails 
We are expanding our coverage of Transportation companies with initiation of 
coverage of the Canadian railroad industry. We are positive on Canadian Pacific 
(CP, Buy) and cautious on Canadian National (CNI, Sell), as we see overall market 
share and earnings trajectory driving a reversal in recent relative value trends. All 
told we forecast CP to grow EPS at double the rate of CNI (+3CP/0 for CP vs. +15% 
for CNI cumulatively through 2019), which together with capex and free cash 
trends should drive re-rating at CP and de-rating for CNI. In this report we present 
a primer on the Canadian rail industry, with deep dives on Canadian Pacific and 
Canadian National. 
CANADIAN NATIONAL (CNI): A Victim of Its Own Success; Initiate SeIl$73 PT 
We see 10%+ downside in CNI shares as the company's strong outperformance 
starts to slow- driven by both the law of large numbers (the company already 
achieves a mid 40's operating margin, up from the high 30's five years ago) as 
well as catch-up performance from CP. For example, we note that from 2012-2016 
CNI increased volumes at more than double the rate of CP, reflecting mix as well 
as market share gains during CP's implementation of Precision Railroading. The 
combination of CNI's slower prospective earnings growth and high capex (20% of 
sales) implies 15.5x PIE under our DCF-derived methodology, implying potential 
for 3.5 turns (20%) valuation de-rating vs. current trading levels. Initiate Sell. 
CANADIAN PACIFIC (CP). Shifting Gears: Initiate Buy:$209 PT 
Following its multi-year implementation of Precision Railroading, CP is shifting 
gears from cost take-out to top-line growth. As such, we see at least 15% 
upside in shares as CP leverages its reduced cost base, improved service levels, 
and recent capacity investments to retake market share. We expect this to 
translate to 30% cumulative EPS growth over the next two years, reflecting mid-
single digit revenue growth, significant operating leverage, and accelerated share 
repurchase. Against this backdrop we see CP's relative valuation discount as 
unsustainable, which underpins our positive stance to shares. Initiate Buy. 
Valuation and Risks: 
We utilize P/E multiples to value rail stocks, with our target multiple assumptions 
heavily supported by our discounted cash flow models. Risks for the group include 
recession, industrial production, pricing, and mgmt. execution. For more details 
please company-specific CP and CNI sections within this note.
