Trump Cites Botched NYC Ballots As Evidence Of Problems With Mail-In Voting. 
The New York Post (9/30, Nelson, 4.57M) reports President Trump has claimed for months that 
"widespread mail-in voting amid the COVID-19 pandemic opens the door to fraud and is likely 
to delay the Nov. 3 results." On Wednesday, he "said his concerns about mail-in voting are 
being borne out by New York officials sending botched ballots to nearly 100,000 Brooklyn 
residents." Trump told reporters at the White House, "We had a problem in New York, they have 
100,000 ballots that are a mess. ... They're all confused, all mixed up. Now they say they're 
going to redo them. Well, what are they going to do with 100,000 ballots that have already 
been sent? This is exactly what I'm talking about. ... It's a big, big, big-scale problem." 
Trump tweeted Wednesday night, "100,000 DEFECTIVE BALLOTS IN NEW YORK. THEY 
WANT TO REPLACE THEM, BUT WHERE, AND WHAT HAPPENS TO, THE BALLOTS THAT WERE 
FIRST SENT? THEY WILL BE USED BY SOMEBODY. USA, END THIS SCAM - GO OUT AND VOTE!" 
NYTimes Report: Trump's Voter-Fraud Concerns Are Part Of GOP Conspiracy. 
Geoff Bennett said on NBC Nightly NewsVI (9/30, story 4, 2:25, Holt, 5.69M) that Trump 
"unleashed a flood of misinformation and mistruths about mail-in voting" during Tuesday night's 
debate. The New York Times (9/30, Victor, 18.61M) reports that a New York Times Magazine
investigation "finds that" Trump's "misleading and false claims about widespread voter fraud are 
part of a long disinformation effort that the president has taken to new extremes." The Times 
adds, "The specter of widespread voter fraud has been a cornerstone of President Trump's 
efforts to dispute the Nov. 3 election should he lose. A New York Times Magazine investigation 
published on Wednesday has found that the idea, based on a flimsy set of sensationalist, 
misleading or outright false claims, was intentionally planted in the public discourse as part of a 
decades-long disinformation campaign by the Republican Party and outside actors." The Times 
adds, "The strategy was hatched soon after Mr. Trump won the 2016 election and has included 
the involvement of top officials, including the president and Vice President Mike Pence." 
In a separate article, the New York Times (9/30, Epstein, Thrush, 18.61M) says that "in 
recent months, as his standing in the polls has fallen, Mr. Trump has pre-emptively argued that 
Democratic elections officials are orchestrating a scheme to send extra mail ballots to like-
minded voters." According to the Times, "There is no evidence of this." 
Trump Campaign Demands Access To Philadelphia Voting Sites. The AP (9/30) 
reports on Wednesday, the Trump campaign "threatened a lawsuit...if it does not gain access 
soon for its campaign officials to observe activity inside newly opened satellite election offices in 
Philadelphia, where people can register to vote, apply for mail-in ballots and fill them out." A 
letter, "sent late Tuesday night by a lawyer representing the Trump campaign, insisted the 
campaign has a legal right to observe the voting process in the heavily Democratic city's 
satellite election offices." However, "election lawyers say there is no right under Pennsylvania 
law, even for a certified poll watcher, to observe inside an election office where someone is 
registering to vote, applying for a mail-in ballot or filling one out." 
Democrats Say Trump's Call For Supporters To Monitor Polls Is Voter 
Intimidation. Reuters (9/30, Martina, Sullivan) reports President Trump's "calls for his 
supporters to act as ad-hoc poll watchers in the November election" were denounced by 
"Democrats and nonpartisan election experts," who said "they were an oblique call for illegal 
voter intimidation." Democrats "accused Trump of trying to scare voters." House Speaker Pelosi 
told MSNBC, "He is intimidating people." Reuters adds, "Democrats have expressed concerns 
that some right-wing groups with firearms could try to gather near polling places, particularly in 
close districts or areas with high minority populations, as a way to suppress Democratic 
turnout."
