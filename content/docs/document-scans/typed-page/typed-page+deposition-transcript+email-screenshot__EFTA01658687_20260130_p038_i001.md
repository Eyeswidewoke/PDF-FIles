Francisco's coronavirus restrictions on salons and other similar businesses was amended on 
Tuesday, allowing for hair appointments to be conducted outdoors only, with one customer at a 
time who must wear a mask (ear loops rather than ties are recommended so as not to interfere 
with hair services)." Salons, however, "were still closed on Monday." 
To The Federalist (9/2, Justice, 126K), "Pelosi was exposed for attending a shut-down hair 
salon in San Francisco Monday without a face mask while the business remains closed to the 
public." Pelosi "joins a long list of Democratic politicians blowing off the very lockdown orders 
they've imposed on the American people." Townhall (9/2, Benson, 177K) reports that 
"sometimes, an image is so self-explanatory that it transcends the need for extensive 
commentary," and "the footage of a mid-blowout Nancy Pelosi walking maskless through an 
empty hair salon in San Francisco, where such salons are mandated to be closed due to the 
pandemic, truly speaks for itself." The Fox News (9/2, Singman, 27.59M) website, The Hill (9/2, 
Marcos, 2.98M), and the Washington Times (9/2, Munoz, 492K), among other news outlets also 
report the story. 
Under the headline "Gall Of Nancy Pelosi: Salon For Me, Lockdown For You," David Marcus 
writes in the New York Post (9/2, 4.57M), "It turns out that one of the most serious side effects 
of the coronavirus lockdowns is abject hypocrisy." In an editorial, meanwhile, the Wall Street 
Journal (9/2, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) casts the Pelosi-hair salon saga as an 
exemplifying wealthy liberals' elitist attitude toward the rest of the population. 
NBC Nightly NewsVi (9/2, story 6, 1:55, Kasey Hunter, 5.53M) reported Republicans are 
"accusing Pelosi of hypocrisy." Chief of Staff Meadows was shown saying, "They preach to the 
American people that it should be one way. Yet, in private, when the cameras are not rolling, 
and in this case, I guess the cameras were rolling. It shows a very different story." 
Under the headline "Trump And His Allies Seize On Pelosi's Salon Visit," Politico (9/2, 
Forgey, 4.29M) reports that President Trump "piled onto...Pelosi on Wednesday, criticizing her 
for appearing on video without a mask at an otherwise shuttered San Francisco salon where 
she got her hair done." The President took to Twitter to write, "Crazy Nancy Pelosi is being 
decimated for having a beauty parlor opened, when all others are closed, and for not wearing a 
Mask - despite constantly lecturing everyone else. We will almost certainly take back the 
House, and send Nancy packing!_ The Beauty Parlor owner must really dislike Crazy Nancy 
Pelosi. Turning her in, on tape, is a really big deal. She probably treats him like she treats 
everyone else...And she strongly supported a Kennedy who just lost in, of all places, 
Massachusetts!" 
White House Deputy Press Secretary Brian Morgenstern was asked on Fox News' 
America's Newsroom (9/2, 896K) to respond to the video of Pelosi, and he said, "It's the 
hypocrisy that is really offensive to people and she got caught red-handed. The people know 
that people who say one thing and do another probably shouldn't be trusted too much." 
Salon Owner Reveals She's Receiving Death Threats. The Washington Examiner 
(9/2, Soellner, 448K) reports that Erica Kious, owner of eSalon, said in an interview with Fox 
News host Tucker Carlson that Pelosi was not "set up," calling the charge "absolutely false." 
Kious also said, "This isn't even political. I mean, she's been coming in there. It's the fact that 
she actually came in and didn't have a mask on, and I just thought about my staff and people 
not being able to work and make money and provide for their families." Kious also said, "I've 
been in that community for 12 years. Since this happened, I have received nothing but hate 
text messages, death threats, they're going to burn my hair salon down. ... My Yelp page is just 
unbelievable with bad reviews. ... So that's hurtful, but yeah, I think I'm pretty much done 
now." The Daily Caller (9/2, Morefield, 716K) also reports the story. 
San Francisco Chronicle: Pelosi Should Have Apologized. In an editorial titled 
"Pelosi's Salon Visit Was Not A Good Look For The Speaker," the San Francisco Chronicle (9/2, 
2.67M) writes that "of course," Pelosi "would prefer to change the subject. An apology and an 
acknowledgment that few if any of her constituents not named Nancy Pelosi would have been
