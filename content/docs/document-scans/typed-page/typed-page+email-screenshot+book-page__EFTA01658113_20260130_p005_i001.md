(7/23, Cohen, 4.29M) reports Sens. Jeff Merkley (D-OR) and Ron Wyden (D-OR), and Reps. 
Earl Blumenauer (D-OR) and Suzanne Bonamici (D-OR), "requested that the DOJ and DHS OIGs 
investigate" what they called "the unrequested presence and violent actions of recently 
deployed federal forces in Portland." USA Today (7/23, Cummings, 10.31M) and the Washington
Times (7/23, Dinan, 492K), among other news outlets, also report the announcement. 
Trump Defends Deployment Of Agents To Portland. President Trump said on Fox 
News' Hannity (7/23, 535K), "In Portland, we had to do it because they are anarchists. That is 
a level people haven't seen. But they are anarchists. They were going wild for 51 days. And we 
went in and they've done a great job. They were going to rip down the courthouse, a gorgeous 
federal courthouse. So we went in and we have been very, very strong. ... Mayor Wheeler...made 
a fool out of himself. He wanted to be among the people, so we went into the crowd and they 
knock the hell out of him. That was the end of him. So it was pretty pathetic." 
Wolf: "We Do Not Need An Invitation" To Deploy Federal Agents. During an 
appearance on Fox News (7/23, 1:02 p.m. ET, Kaplan, 1.4M), Acting DHS Secretary Wolf said, 
"We have the authority to protect the federal courthouse there in Portland. We have the 
authority to make arrests on individuals that are targeting that courthouse, committing criminal 
acts against that courthouse, and our law enforcement officers. The law is very clear about this. 
We do not need an invitation from the governor or the mayor to do that. Just as any other 
federal law-enforcement agency, such as the FBI, does not need an invitation to go in to 
investigate a criminal act and make arrests." 
Cuccinelli: Federal Officers Protecting Federal Building Not New. Acting DHS 
Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli appeared on the Glenn BeckVi (7/23, 9:10 a.m. ET, 42K) radio 
program, where he was asked about criticism of federal law enforcement agents in American 
cities. Cuccinelli said, "There is a little-known agency called the Federal Protective Service that 
protects thousands of federal properties across the country. They've been protecting me this 
courthouse at issue in Portland since it was built in 1997. So this is not a new mission, it's a 
24/7/365 mission." 
Morgan: "Ridiculous" To Say Federal Agents Inciting Violence. Appearing on Fox 
Business' Evening Edit (7/23, 6:01 p.m. ET, 148K), CBP Commissioner Morgan was asked about 
a statement from Joe Biden that the Administration is attacking peaceful protesters and fueling 
division. Morgan said, "Every single night these criminals have taken over the protests. They 
meet, organize, plan with the willful intent to destroy federal property and seriously injure 
federal agents. That is the truth. The federal agents are there under Title 40, USC 13.15, which 
dictates that the Secretary, not has a choice, he must protect federal buildings. That is what our 
presence is there for. To say the presence of federal agents doing their statutory responsibility 
is inciting violence is ridiculous."

The New York Post (7/23, Woods, 4.57M) reports President Trump called Chicago Mayor Lori 
Lightfoot on Wednesday evening "to confirm his plans to send 200 federal agents to the city to

Times (7/23, Sweet, 875K), the Mayor's office said Trump "reached out to Mayor Lightfoot this 
evening to confirm that he plans to send federal resources to Chicago to supplement ongoing 
federal investigations pertaining to violent crime." The statement said the call was "brief and 
straightforward." 
Lightfoot, the Washington Free Beacon (7/23, Nester, 78K) reports, "suggested at a press 
conference on Wednesday that...Trump is deploying federal officers to cities because their 
mayors are Democratic women." Said the Mayor, "The president has been on a campaign now 
for some time against Democratic mayors across the country. Whether it's me, whether it's
