a feedback that in some instances are hard wire=, aversion , danger„ its the acgivity behind the=screen that answers 
the compleix quesiotns. the aha moment is when t=e dream room sends its message to the conciouness room. 
2 mus=c , most animals make sounds. what doe= music represent. it is melody prosody, inforamtion 
both=verticaland horizonal. chords melody. . as it is g=nerated from the brain can it be reversed engineered and used 
to probel th= workings of the machine tha creatied it. . listeing to a flut=, and its tonal quality from the sound analysisi 
, a Ion= empyt tube can be postualted. but thats only its structure,=C2 rythms are a product of the player not only the 
structur=. do german marches provide insite into a german mind. i= it organized regulaid. beats that range from 30 -
12 bpm. =AO do afro americnacs. think more like jazz. =somewhat off the beat. ( humor. unpredictable movements

3. mathematics is =he search for truth. algorithms that do not change there=result with the passing of the day. . 
mathematics stands outsi=e of time. the ideal of a point or line ( separte from einsteins mea=uemrnt issues as the 
actaul measurement is much more diffcult . requ=ring a beggining and and end therefore measurement lives in time 
spa=e. mathematics is the search for truth. I po=tualte that Biology and biological systems differ from mathematics 
beacuse=it is needs deception to survive. biological systems only make sense in ti=e space. , trying to stay away from 
what is the moment of life=or death. . predator prey. biuoogical system= need free energy in order to maintain 
structure dissintegraing from=entropy, eneygy needs to be ingested inorder to fight th= slope down to breaking apart 
and returning to dust. . =C2 getting energy, the most basic bio requirement. in=bio systems however the best way to 
get energy is either from the su=, a limtied chenical reaction or heat gradisent. the energy must com= from outside. 
the way for systems to gain enery is to eat it.=C2 the way not to die is to eat andnot be eaten.. the game of eat or n=t 
be eaten is very sophisticated what is the entity . =AO the cell. the organ , the organism . the community on and =n. 
heirarchila nested systems. at every leve= decision have to be made, is it ok to sacrifice a few cells so tha= the 
organism can live. which cells. do they get a=choice? how many when . when the organism is eaten by it= predator. 
how did it try to protect itself. camaflouge,=C2 surrounding itself in junk, mimicryy, misdirection, misinformation.=C2 
etc.. qurum sensing game theory, free will, bait, =nts, . 
4 we have come a long way in surveillance=C2 and detecting and encoding and decoding communticaions between 
peopl= between computers, . we can do this beacuse we can pick out t=e words in text, embed it in a grammar space, 
we know=the language/ 
we need to do the same now for biolo=y, what is the language of the cells. do they 
communcat =ith proteins, . what are they saying to each other, is teh oanaguage=encrypted , does each person have 
his onw code. =AO is it chemcial or elctrical or both. or physical like the shape o= the protein fiiting in a lolck, or 
combination of all three. the pr=tein fits. the electri is fired, etc. does the brain send a message. =what does medicine 
do. does it fool the receiver the sender. t=e listener. the history of telemommincaiotns intercepts =ave a long histroy 
referring to alice and bob that would like to speak to =ach other, they encript their messages. so that a =istener 
cannot do damge. . why not attack the bio =anguage the same way as speech. 
have nsa wor= on decrypting the 
differnce in signals from a cancer cell as oppose= to a helathy one. we know that cells send out messages , am i=in the 
right place. if they get no answer or the wrong aswer t=ey are programeed to commit suicicde. when a foreigner 
shows u= in a neighborhhod that is hostile , he is surrounded. k=lled and moved into the trash. he can masquerade as 
a lo=al. how can the other cells tell. can they ask him=who won the world series. ? . maybe an equivalent. =friend or
