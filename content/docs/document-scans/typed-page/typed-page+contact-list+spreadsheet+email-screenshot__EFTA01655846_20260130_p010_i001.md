Alleged FBI Server Details and Login Pages Shared on Hacking Forum 
Cyber Daily (07/02, Hollingworth) reported that a member of a popular clear web hacking forum has posted the 
alleged details of nine FBI servers, complete with hosting ISP, IP addresses, and even what appear to be links to 
network login pages. The article added that a user by the name of un3xpectedbandit made the post on 30 June, 
with the details showing up on the tracking platform Falcon Feeds not long after. The article quoted Falcon Feeds, 
who said, "The threat actor claims to have leaked information on several servers associated with the FBI's back-end 
systems, including their IPs, server locations, organizations, and operating systems. The list includes servers located 
in various countries such as Turkey, Iceland, United States, Australia, Netherlands, Russia, etc.," The article stated

HHS, FBI Warn Healthcare Sector of Social Engineering Scheme 
Health IT Security (07/01, McKeon) reported that HHS and the FBI released a joint cybersecurity advisory (CSA) to 
disseminate indicators of compromise related to a social engineering campaign targeting healthcare and public 
health entities. The article added that the CSA warned that threat actors have been using phishing schemes to steal 
login credentials for initial access and divert automated clearinghouse (ACH) payments to U.S.-controlled bank 
accounts. In this scheme, threat actors often call an organization's IT help desk and impersonate employees to 
trigger a password reset for the targeted employee's account. The FBI and HHS described healthcare organizations 
as "attractive targets" due to their technological dependence, access to sensitive information, size, and patient care 
impacts. The CSA warned that after gaining access via social engineering, the threat actors often use living off the 
land (LOTL) techniques to blend in with typical network behavior. The article mentioned that the CSA contains 
detailed indicators of compromise and known phone numbers affiliated with phishing schemes that network 
defenders can use to fend off these attacks. Additionally, HHS and the FBI recommended training IT help desk 
employees on this vulnerability and implementing MFA for every account.

Treasury Sanctions Mexico and China-Based Money Launderers Linked to the Sinaloa Cartel 
The Epoch Times (07/01, Morgan) reported that the U.S. Treasury Department has sanctioned one Mexican 
resident and two Chinese residents suspected of laundering drug trafficking proceeds for the Sinaloa Cartel. The 
Treasury Department, on July 1, named Mexico-based Diego Acosta Ovalle and China-based Tong Peiji and He 
Jiaxuan as suspected Cartel moneymen. The Treasury Department sanctioned the trio, in accordance with a 
December 2021 executive order, authorizing sanctions on suspected participants in the global illicit drug trade. The 
article mentioned that according to the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control, Ovalle helped the 
Sinaloa Cartel collect and hide their drug trafficking profits, and moved those proceeds along to cartel associates. 
The Treasury Department alleged the cartel associates worked with the two Chinese nationals, who were members 
of a U.S.-based Chinese Money Laundering Organization (CMLO). The article stated that the U.S. Attorney's Office 
for the Central District of California investigated the underlying trafficking allegations, along with the U.S. Drug 
Enforcement Administration, the Internal Revenue Service—Criminal Investigations, Homeland Security 
Investigations, the FBI, and various local police departments in California. VOA News (07/01, Staff Writer) also
