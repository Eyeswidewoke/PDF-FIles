Support Tsunami Relief Efforts 
At American Express, we are committed to supporting relief efforts in 
the Asian countries devastated by the recent earthquake and 
resulting tsunamis. Given the enormity of the recent disaster in 
Southeast Asia, we want to maximize the support given to the many 
relief organizations that are collecting funds at this time of great need. 
Therefore, we have decided to waive all fees associated with 
accepting American Expresse Card charges for tsunami disaster relief 
organizations that have all been recognized by the U.S. government 
as providing assistance to people affected by the earthquake and 
tsunamis. 
To support tsunami relief, 
you can donate through 
the American Express 
Tsunami Relief page 
located off of the 
American Express home 
page at wynv.american 
oxpress.com. Please-
