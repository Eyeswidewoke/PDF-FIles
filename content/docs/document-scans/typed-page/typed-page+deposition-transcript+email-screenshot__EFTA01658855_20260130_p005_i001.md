nothing. I'm ashamed that I endorsed him." Bruce: "Trump's false claims of fraud threaten to 
undermine Republican efforts to win Georgia's two special Senate elections on January 5." 
Norah O'Donnell said on the CBS Evening NewsVi (11/30, 6:39 p.m. ET, story 3, 4.67M), 
"President Trump is launching more false charges of ballot fraud in states where he lost. But 
now some in his party worry the President's attacks could cost him votes in Georgia where two 
runoffs will decide which party controls the US Senate." CBS' Paula Reid: "With the Trump 
campaign recount in Wisconsin failing to reverse Biden's win in the state, the President looked 
to Georgia where he called on Republican Gov. Brian Kemp to overrule the Secretary of State 
Brad Raffensperger, another Republican, and help him win the state." Raffensperger: "The truth 
matters." Reid: "Raffensperger disputed the claim and said today that third-party groups are 
continuing to spread false information." 
Fox News (11/30, Conner, 27.59M) reports on its website that Trump called on Kemp "to 
override (Raffensperger) on matching signatures during the state's recount, in a tweet Monday." 
Trump tweeted, "Why won't Governor @BrianKempGA, the hapless Governor of Georgia, use his 
emergency powers, which can be easily done, to overrule his obstinate Secretary of State, and 
do a match of signatures on envelopes. It will be a 'goldmine' of fraud, and we will easily WIN 
the state." 
The New York Times (11/30, Lerer, Fausset, Haberman, 18.61M) says Trump's "sustained 
assault on his own party in Georgia, and his repeated claims of election fraud in the state, have 
intensified worries among Republicans that he could be hurting" Sens. Kelly Loeffler (R-GA) and 
David Perdue (R-GA) in their runoffs. Trump's "broadsides have quietly rattled some 
Republicans in the state, who fear that concerns about the fairness of the presidential election 
could depress turnout for the Senate races." 
The Wall Street Journal (11/30, Corse, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) reports 
Raffensperger said officials are investigating third-party groups trying to register people in 
other states to vote in Georgia in the runoffs, but said there was no widespread fraud in the 
general election. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution (11/30, 895K) reports Raffensperger "said 
one group sent applications to people in New York City. Another tried to register a dead 
Alabama woman. Two other groups also sent improper applications, the secretary said. Groups 
that were contacted denied the accusations." The Washington Post (11/30, 14.2M) looks at the 
political divide within Georgia that led to the narrow Biden win. 
Trump "Allies" Want Federal Court To Award Michigan Electors To President. 
The Detroit Free Press (11/30, 1.52M) reports Trump "allies...want a federal court in Michigan 
to force state leaders to set aside election results and award its 16 electoral votes to the 
president. A separate conservative group also wants the Michigan Supreme Court to invalidate 
the results that show [Biden] won the state." A lawsuit "filed by Trump-affiliated attorney 
Sidney Powell and a cadre of other lawyers, wants a judge to force" Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) 
and Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson (D) "to 'decertify' those results. They want to act before 
Dec. 14, when the Electoral College is set to meet." 
MLive (MI) (11/30, 925K) reports that Rep. Paul Mitchell (R-MI), who "represents a 
staunchly pro-Trump district in Michigan's thumb region," tweeted late Sunday, "Oh my God. 
.@realDonaldTrump Please for the sake of our Nation please drop these arguments without 
evidence or factual basis. #stopthestupid". 
Opinion: Damage Is Done Through False Claims About Dominion Voting Systems. 
John Poulos, President and CEO of Dominion Voting Systems, writes in an op-ed in the Wall 
Street Journal (11/30, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) that the allegations made recently 
against his company on social media are false. Poulos says the company is American, is not 
connected to Hugo Chavez, and is not a front for communists. He further writes there is no 
"vote flipping" algorithm, and the election process is regulated and certified. Poulos argues false 
allegations about election rigging are doing damage to US democracy and should be retracted.
