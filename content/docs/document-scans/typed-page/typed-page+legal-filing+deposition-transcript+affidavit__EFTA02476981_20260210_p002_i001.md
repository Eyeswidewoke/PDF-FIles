products = private bank Rockefeller Rothschild. financial service. deal with UK=20 visa issue sooner rather than later. 
we can talk about Rowen request =e Athene , 2 billion in taxes on transaction. ?! 
<=div> 
the facts as i see them 
in June and then a=ain Sept, we both agreed to a 50% of phaidon payout., then after weeks of thinking about the 
issue ( which = fully understand ) . the payout was unilaterally changed . 5m woudl =e reserved for the future ? . and 
out of the remaining 15m ,? i would=20 receive only 5. ( note : I'm confident that both the debt ,=and the a=tspace 
investment will also lead to a write off of another 30 m. plus=C2 ) In my dining room ,you were surprised when I said 
that i require most=20 people to pay their advisory fee up front so that I am assured =hat I will be properly 
compensated for my work when strategies that I devis= are implemented . you may recall that you appeared offended 
=AO and said " are you suggesting that i would go back on my word " =AO I said no , of course not ! you are my closest 
of friends ,but my experience is=20 that when amounts get large, people tend to get unhappy when it actually comes 
time for them to pay ,. 
From day zero a 50 - =0 million price was attached as the fair price of the transaction just=20 completed . though this 
amount was already substant=ally less thanour agreed and negotiated formula. - I was never tol= that this was out of 
range. in fact, alternative methods of paymen= . plane -in-kind etc, were discussed ( ie keeping the 30m portion of 
=AO fee outstanding till March ) ,I provided as requested a detailed =C2 step by step execution plan and reviewed all 
documents that i was given acce=s to. ( Phaidon was not forthcoming ) in order to make my=many corrections . I was 
then told that Alans involvement warranted a discount . Even in the best of l=ght , though it is beyond question that 
not one-,not -one time in th=ee years has he ever proposed a unique idea. (including the new tenant in common 
idea,) and =ets say he made a contribution to the plan andeven that it was 50 %. =AO though no one could posit such a 
large amount unless they were wearin= a brightly colored clown suit. , the price of doing the deal was=known . It had 
both sent in writing and spoken about on the phone nu=erous times , a detailed execution plan was provided . then 
an= only then after all was laid out for the group I was told that after a number o= conversations with brad karp that 
only 20m would be paid , (and even that was more than originally contemplated ) for both transactions . I feel It was 
rema=kably unfair. Did brad even know of our prior agreement.? =AO I called him and he said he was never told.?, I 
would ask that you I and Brad karp sit together if you think it would be helpful. . I would like to sen= him this email, with 
your consent of course. If the transactio=s were never consummated , i would not be owed a dime, however , the 
price=20 was known up front. , the detailed step by step plan was followed and=20 overseen by me, the price that had 
been requested before the transaction was begun, and had lready heavily discounted, out of friendship, =AO from our 
agreement . I believe the decision re paying only 20 m has =20 frankly left me felling quite uneasy. 
since you asked since last nov. i found=C2 11 million dollars in dormant accounts. 4 million dollars in eileens drawer. 
. went through cash flows for phaidon shwoing that john murph= is not an accountant. redid your gagosian contract , . 
=AO organized structure in case of divorce. set up gift trust. stopped ada from including multiple times things not in your 
interest. dealt wit= bad sales tax use tax income tax . created 8 millino in deductions=C2 ,500k in mistakes , found 
bank of scotland fbar problems, .. reorg bad art purchases, funds taken„ charibale decustions , helped with fincnac=l 
sttment gamoing commions fling.. boat deductions, rescued stock from grats. . may 1 after months of brad not finding 
anyone i =ent an email saying you would have to pay more.. on april 15. I sent =n email detailing payments owed if i 
could figure out the basis issue, =C2 please see attached, . 
questions you might ask your team=C2 ask them to provide a balance sheet or p&I for REgan=arts. . doesnt exist 
ask . either wechsler or haperin to tell you what brh is, or how the tra=20 works. . . ? as bronstein to tell you why the 
proposed phaidon=20 transaction DOES not work. . as them to give you a plan for the=plane. ? ask them to show you 
the cash mgmt for over 100 million doll=rs. . ask them to show you the IT system progress after one year.. the=20 
approval process for payables. . the cash flow projections? assumptions? ask for a comparative review of investments.
