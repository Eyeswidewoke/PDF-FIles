on the finding, in a 2009 study, that Holocaust memorials can increase antisemitis=. Confronted with an atrocity they 
otherwise can't explain, people become slightly more likely, on average, to b=lieve that the victims must have brought it 
on themselves. For example, that last month's commemorations of the liberati=n of Auschwitz may have marginally 
increased the prevalence of antisemitism in t=e modern world, despite being partly intended as a warning against its 
consequences? Or that reading about the eye-popping state of economic inequality could make you less likely to 
supp=rt politicians who want to do something about it? 
These are among numerous unsettling implications =f the "just-world hypothesis", a psycholo=ical bias explored in a 
new essay by Nicholas Hune-Brown at Hazlitt. The w=rld, obviously, is a manifestly unjust place: people are always 
meeting fates they didn't deserve, or not receiving rewards they did deserve for hard work or virtuous behavior. Yet 
sever=l decades of research have established that our need to believe otherwise run= deep. Faced with evidence of 
injustice, we'll certainly try to alleviate it if we can — but, if we =eel powerless to make things right, we'll do the next best 
thing, psychologically sp=aking: we'll convince ourselves that the world isn't so unjust after all. 
The classic experiment demonstrating the just-wor=d effect took place in 1966, when Melvyn Lerner and Carolyn 
Simmons showed people wh=t they claimed were live images of a woman receiving agonizing electric shock= for her 
poor performance in a memory test. Given the option to allevi=te her suffering by ending the shocks, almost everybody 
did so: humans may be terrible, but mos= of us don't go around being consciously and deliberately awful. =hen denied 
any option to halt her punishment, however — when forced to just sit and watch her apparently suffer =E2404> the 
participants adjusted their opinions of the woman downwards, as if to convi=ce themselves her agony wasn't so 
indefensible because she wasn't=span style="font-size:l2pt;line-height:107%"> really such an innocent victim. "The 
sight of an innocent person s=ffering without possibility of reward or compensation", Lerner and Simmons concluded, 
"motivated people to devalue the attractiveness of the victim =n order to bring about a more appropriate fit between 
her fate and her character.=E244 It's easy to see how a similar psychological process might lead, say, to the belief that 
victims of sexual assault were =/span>"asking for it"=span style="font-size:l2pt;line-height:107%">: if you can convince 
yourself of that, you can avoid acknowledging the horror of the situation.c=span> 
What's truly unsettling about the just-wo=ld bias is that while it can have truly unpleasant effects, these follow from 
what seems li=e the entirely understandable urge to believe that things happen for a reason= After all, if we didn't all 
believe that to some degree, life would be an intolerably chaotic and terrifying nightmare in, which effort and payb=ck 
were utterly unrelated, and there was no point planning for the future, saving m=ney for retirement or doing anything 
else in hope of eventual reward. We=E2.4>d go mad. Surely wanting the world to make a bit more sense than that is 
eminently forgivable? Yet,=ironically, this desire to believe that things happen for a reason leads to the kinds of 
positions that help entrench injustice inste=d of reducing it. 
Hune-Brown cites another recent bit of evidence f=r the phenomenon: people with a strong belief in a just world, he 
reports, are mo=e likely to oppose affirmative action schemes intended to help women or minorities. You needn't be 
explicitly racist or sexist to hold such views, nor committed to a highly individ=alistic political position (such as 
libertarianism); the researchers controlled for those. You need only cling to a conviction that the world is basically fair= 
That might be a pretty naive position, of course — but it's=hard to argue that it's a hateful one. Similar associations have
