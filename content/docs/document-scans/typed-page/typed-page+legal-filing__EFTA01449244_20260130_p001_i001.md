FX Blueprint: Dashing Buck 
anticipates a 'virtuous cycle among production, income 
and spending triggered by increases in public 
investment and exports.' At the risk of caricature, 
Hayami had been all about gritting one's teeth and 
holding 
out 
for 
the 
eventual 
benefits 
of 
(Schumpeterian) creative destruction, while Shirakawa 
was resigned to the structural drag from demographics. 
Kuroda has taken a leaf out of the Fed's much more 
activist playbook, raising the stakes (promising almost 
three times as much QE) and taking a lead in talking up 
the economy's reflationary prospects. Policy board 
members' core forecasts are that the economy will 
exceed its potential by a factor of 5-6 times this fiscal 
year (2.4-3.0% versus 'around 0.5%,' albeit with the 
caveat that this includes frontloaded demand ahead of 
the April '14 consumption tax hike)! 
Measures of progress will come over the summer, with 
investors able to gauge the reaction to: (i) Abe's grand 
deregulation and competition plan, to be unveiled mid-
June; (ii) the Tokyo metropolitan and Upper House 
elections, in June and July respectively; plus (iii) final 
social security reform and fiscal reconstruction plans in 
August and September. Positive domestic sentiment 
could well exaggerate risk-seeking outflows just as the 
Fed discussion about tapering down asset purchases is 
progressing. 
[fey) vu and then 
So how does the current backdrop stack up against 
previous periods of significant yen weakness? We 
examined seven episodes since the breakdown of 
Bretton Woods. They were characterized by trade 
shocks (mid- and late-70s, 
late-'80s, mid-'90s); 
valuation overshoots and intervention (mid-'90s); 
capital outflows, be they deregulation-, risk seeking- or 
'sell-Japan'-driven (early and late-'80s, mid-'90s, early 
and mid-'00s). Clearly, today shares many of these 
features, with the added kicker of an unprecedented 
monetary backdrop. This is what raises the prospect of 
overshoot. But that's unlikely to be an issue in the next 
3-6 months.
