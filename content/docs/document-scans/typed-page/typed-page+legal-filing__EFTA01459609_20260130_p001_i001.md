FX Blueprint Forever Young 
Growth. We expect divergent growth trajectories for 
Poland and Hungary in the coming year. Hungarian 
growth should decelerate to 2.4% in 2016, primarily on 
the back of a decrease in public investment driven by 
reduced EU funds inflows. This is because the overlap 
from the old EU budgeting period has ended, and this 
is normally associated with a sharp drop in EU funds. 
EU funds inflows in Hungary are normally back-loaded 
towards the end of the budgeting envelope - for 
example, just EUR 1.6bn of EU funds were absorbed in 
each of the first three years of the previous budgeting 
period (on average), while in the first three quarters of 
2015 the absorption was already nearly EUR 5bn. On 
the other hand, Poland has a much better record of EU 
funds absorption that is more evenly-distributed over 
the budgeting period. This is partly the reason we 
expect Polish growth to remain robust at 3.5% in 2016. 
Other Polish fundamentals are also sound: valuations 
are attractive (PLN is the most undervalued currency 
across our long-term metrics) and macro vulnerabilities 
have been sharply reduced in recent years. 
RoP dynamics. The sharp drop in Hungary's EU funds 
inflows this year will also lead to a contraction in the 
capital account. This will come on top of sizable 
portfolio outflows, as EUR 5.5bn in external debt 
redemption is planned to be financed by the local 
banking sector via domestic issuance (part of the 
NBH's Self-Financing Plan). Non-domestic holdings of 
Hungarian government debt have come down sharply 
to 26% from 35% a year ago - the increase in local 
demand for this debt encouraged as part of the Self-
Financing Plan has lowered yields and squeezed out 
non-domestic investors. This process could continue 
into next year with the implementation of further local 
bank OE-type measures mentioned earlier, putting 
further pressure on the portfolio component. All in all, 
deteriorating BoP dynamics will weigh on HUF in 2016. 
Recent trend of portfolio outflows is likely to continue

ILS the weak one among the other EMEA low yielders 
ILS remains a good funding currency, with a near-zero 
funding cost. The shekel's negative beta to broad dollar 
strength is high, and therefore the continued USD 
Page 24 
strength expected this year should lead to some ILS 
weakness. Barring this, continued FX interventions by 
the Bol will likely prevent further shekel strength. ILS 
TWI is near 
5-year highs due to substantial 
appreciation in 2015, as the Bol has not taken steps to 
substantially weaken the currency like other central 
banks with similar deflation concerns. But this shekel 
strength has weighed on exports, growth and inflation, 
and the Bol's sensitivity to any major shekel 
appreciation is now likely high. There are particular 
concerns about the current deflation, present since 
mid-2014 and deepening in recent months, becoming 
further entrenched. Discretionary FX interventions were 
ramped up somewhat in December, but we believe 
there is more space and likelihood of more intervention 
acceleration, given the relatively low level of FX 
reserves (30% of GDP) and recent leg lower in crude.

The Bol again sharply downgraded both growth and 
inflation forecasts in December, providing forward 
guidance of low rates for long. For 2016, it forecasts 
only one 15bps hike around year-end, which is even 
more hawkish than our forecast for the first hike in CH 
2017. Real rate spreads vs the US are already close to 
5-year lows, and further widening of rate differentials 
this year should add upward pressure on USDILS. 
Elsewhere in CEE, CZK is the most elevated net long on 
our CORAX positioning indicator across G1O and EM 
FX, mainly due to buying by leveraged funds. However, 
the CNB's EURCZK 27 floor does not look in danger: FX 
reserves levels are relatively low (30% of GDP); 
potential CNB losses from eventual CZK appreciation is 
not a political issue (as was the case in Switzerland); on 
a relative scale, intervention through the life of the floor 
has been small - CNB intervened for the first time since 
the start of the floor (Nov 2013) only in July 2015: 
inflation is expected to remain below target until well 
into next year. We believe the CNB will let go of the 
floor only around end-2016, in line with guidance.
