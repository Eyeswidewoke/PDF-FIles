potential 2024 GOP presidential contender, has faced criticism this year for giving speeches 
considered to be tinged with political overtones." 
The New York Times (12/7, Herndon, 18.61M) looks at GOP strategy in the contests, 
writing that Republicans are focusing primarily on Raphael Warnock, the African American 
minister challenging Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R-GA), and largely ignoring Jon Ossoff, the Democratic 
challenger to Sen. David Perdue (R-GA). 
Trump Reached Out To Pennsylvania House Speaker. The Washington Post (12/7, 
Gardner, Dawsey, Bade, 14.2M) reports the office of Pennsylvania House Speaker Bryan Cutler 
has confirmed that Trump called the GOP speaker "twice during the past week to make an 
extraordinary request for help reversing his loss in the state." Cutler spokesman Michael Straub 
said, "The President said, 'I'm hearing about all these issues in Philadelphia, and these issues 
with your law. What can we do to fix it?" The Post says the calls "make Pennsylvania the third 
state where Trump has directly attempted to overturn a result." 
The Philadelphia Inquirer (12/7, Roebuck, 347K) reports, "With less than a day to go until 
the federal deadline for states to lock in their delegates for the Dec. 14 Electoral College vote, 
Pennsylvania Republicans have bombarded state and federal courts with a flurry of new legal 
filings, grasping for last-minute traction in their thus far unsuccessful attempts to overturn the 
results of the presidential election." 
Trump Campaign Appeals To Nevada Supreme Court. The AP (12/7, Ritter) reports 
attorneys for the Trump campaign are appealing to the Nevada Supreme Court "to overrule a 
lower court judge and nullify...Biden's electoral win in Nevada. ... A hearing was not 
immediately scheduled, but the appeal is expected to get fast-track handling." The Las Vegas 
Review-Journal (12/7, 345K) reports, "Campaign attorneys representing Trump's proposed slate 
of presidential electors filed a notice of appeal in the District Court shortly after Judge James 
Russell denied their request to essentially overturn the state's presidential result." 
Sidney Powell Suits Rejected In Two States. Reuters (12/7, Hals, Brice) reports 
federal judges in Georgia and Michigan rejected efforts by Sidney Powell, "a former lawyer for 
the Trump campaign," to decertify Biden's win in those states. US District Judge Timothy Batten 
in Atlanta and US District Judge Linda Parker in Detroit "ruled that the plaintiffs lacked the legal 
standing to bring the lawsuits and that the cases were filed too late." Batten "said [in) a hearing 
on Monday that the plaintiffs were seeking 'perhaps the most extraordinary relief ever sought' 
in connection with an election." Batten said, "They want this court to substitute its judgment for 
that of two-and-a-half million Georgia voters who voted for Joe Biden, and this I am unwilling 
to do." 
The Washington Post (12/7, 14.2M) reports that Batten, "who was appointed by President 
George W. Bush, forcefully rejected the plaintiffs' requests. Citing other technical reasons, 
Batten said that he was unwilling to reverse the decision of Georgia's voters, which has been 
reaffirmed through two recounts of presidential votes." Bloomberg (12/7, Davis, 4.73M) reports 
that Powell, "who is no longer associated" with Trump's legal team, "filed the suits last month 
on behalf of Republican voters." According to Bloomberg, Powell has "claim[ed) that foreign 
agents from Iran and China conspired with Democratic officials and poll workers to infiltrate 
voting machines and switch votes" from Trump to Biden. 
The Detroit Free Press (12/7, 1.52M) reports Parker said in her opinion, "This lawsuit 
seems to be less about achieving the relief Plaintiffs seek - as much of that relief is beyond the 
power of this Court - and more about the impact of their allegations on People's faith in the 
democratic process and their trust in our government." 
Amistad Project "Has A Tie To President Trump's Legal Team." The Washington
Post (12/7, Swaine, Helderman, Dawsey, Hamburger, 14.2M) reports that the Amistad Project, 
"a conservative legal organization that has filed lawsuits challenging the election results in five 
states, has a tie to President Trump's legal team, raising questions about the independence of 
what has appeared to be an endeavor separate from the president's last-gasp legal 
maneuvering." Trump campaign legal adviser Jenna Ellis "serves as special counsel to the
