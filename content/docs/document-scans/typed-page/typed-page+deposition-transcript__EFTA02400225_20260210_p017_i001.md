gets little attention, partly because Saudi Arabia mostly keeps repor=ers from getting to areas subject to its blockade. 
Kristof wrote that he =as been trying to enter since the fall, but the Saudi coalition controls the air and sea and refuse= 
to allow him in. In effect, the Saudis have managed to block coverage of the crimes against humanity they are 
perpetrat=ng in Yemen, and the U.S. backs the Saudis. Echoing Kristof -- Shame on us. 
Likewise, the go=ernment in South Sudan this month denied me a visa; it doesn't want witnesses to its famine. In the 
United States, humanitarian aid has been a bipartisan tradition, and the champion among recent presidents was George 
W. Bush, who started programs to fight AIDS and malaria that saved millions of lives. Bush and o=her presidents 
recognized that the reasons to help involve not only our values,=but also our interests. 
Think what the g=eatest security threat was that America faced in the last decade. One could argue that it might have 
been Ebola, or some other pandemic — and we overcame Ebola not with aircraft carriers b=t with humanitarian 
assistance and medical research — both of which are slashed in the =rump budget. 
Whereas, Preside=t Trump's vision of a security threat is a Chinese submarine or perhaps an unauthorized immigrant, 
and that's =he vision his budget reflects. But in 2017 some of the gravest threats we face are from diseases or narcotics 
that can*=99t be flattened by a tank but that can be addressed with diplomacy, scientific research, and social programs 
inside and outside our borders.<=span> 
It's tru= that American foreign aid could be delivered more sensibly. It's ridiculous that one of the largest recipients is a 
prosperous country, Israel. TrumpQ=99s budget stipulates that other aid should be cut, but not Israel's. The U.S. 
contributes less than one-fifth of 1 percent of our national inco=e to foreign aid, about half the proportion of other 
donor countries on average. H=manitarian aid is one of the world's great success stories, for the number of people 
living in extreme poverty has dro=ped by half since 1990, and more than 120 million children's lives have=been saved in 
that period. 
Consider Thomas =wiapo, whose parents died when he was a child growing up in northern Ghana. Two of his younger 
brothers died, apparently =f malnutrition. Then Thomas heard that a local school was offering meals for students, a 
"school feeding =rogram" supported by U.S.A.I.D., the American aid agenc=, and Catholic Relief Services. Thomas went 
to the school and was offered daily meals — on the condition t=at he enroll. "I kept going to that little village school, 
just for the food," he told me. He became a brillia=t student, went to college and earned a master's degree in the U.S. 
Today he w=rks for Catholic Relief Services in Ghana, having decided he wants to devote his li=e to giving back. Kristof 
asked him what he thought of the Trump budget cutting foreign assistance. "W=en I hear that aid has been cut, I'm so 
sad," he an=wered. "That food saved my life."
