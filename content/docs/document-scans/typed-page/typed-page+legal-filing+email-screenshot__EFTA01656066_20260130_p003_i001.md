Continued Reporting: Second Trump Assassination Attempt 
Florida Will Launch Criminal Probe Into Apparent Assassination Attempt of Trump 
The Associated Press (09/17, Richer, Matat) reported that on Tuesday, Gov. Ron DeSantis announced that Florida 
law enforcement officials will launch their own criminal investigation into the apparent assassination attempt on 
former President Donald Trump that will run parallel to the federal probe. The governor said Florida prosecutors 
will pursue the most serious charges available under state law, including attempted murder, in the state-level 
investigation into Ryan Wesley Routh, who was charged Monday with federal firearms offenses. The article noted 
that it's not uncommon for state and federal law enforcement agencies to run simultaneous investigations into 
crimes, as states may be able to bring charges that are unavailable at the federal level — and vice versa. Routh is 
charged at the federal level so far only with gun crimes, but additional charges are possible as DOJ prosecutors seek 
an indictment from a grand jury. Prosecutors will often quickly bring the first charges they can and then add more 
serious charges later as the investigation unfolds. The article quoted Attorney General Merrick Garland, who, 
during an event at the DOJ, stated, "We will spare no resource in this investigation?' NPR (09/17, Allen) added that 
DeSantis questioned whether the DOJ, which is prosecuting Trump on election interference and the mishandling of 
classified documents, can handle Routh's prosecution fairly and transparently. "In my judgment," DeSantis said, 
"it's not in the best interest of our state or our nation to have the same federal agencies that are seeking to 
prosecute Donald Trump leading this investigation, especially when the most serious straight-forward offense 
constitutes a violation of state law, but not federal law," DeSantis says Routh could be charged with attempted 
murder under state law, a crime which carries a maximum penalty of life in prison. There is no comparable federal 
statute for attempted murder. The Wall Street Journal (09/17, Barber, Ferek) reported that Attorney 
General Merrick Garland said Tuesday the DOJ would "spare no resource" in investigating Sunday's apparent 
assassination attempt on Donald Trump in Florida, with national-security prosecutors heavily involved in the 
criminal inquiry. Garland's remarks suggest the DOJ could pursue more serious charges than the two initial firearms 
violations the 58-year-old suspect, Ryan Wesley Routh, is facing following his arrest Sunday in South Florida. The 
article pointed out that the FBI was also still awaiting information from several companies it contacted about 
Routh's cell phones and social media accounts, an official said. The FBI is hoping the inquiries will shed light on 
Routh's motives as well as his movements in the hours and days before the incident. So far, investigators have 
gleaned little from Routh, who invoked his right to a lawyer during questioning.

and had a history of run-ins with law enforcement. The article stated that Routh's political affiliations appear
