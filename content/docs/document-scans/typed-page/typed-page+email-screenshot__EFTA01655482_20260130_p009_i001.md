St. Joseph Post (10/27, Staff Writer) reported that federal authorities have arrested Weston R. Womack, a 24-year-

Continued Reporting: California Doorbell Video Captures Masked Men Posing as Federal Agents 
The Independent (10/27, Dobkin) reported that masked men pretending to be federal agents broke into a California 
home in Jurupa Valley, as captured by Ring doorbell footage. According to the article, the men, wearing tactical 
gear and FBI jackets, claimed to have a search warrant and zip-tied the family before robbing them. The article 
noted that a police report was filed, and the Riverside County Sheriff's Department is investigating, but no arrests

Opinion: Yes, Letitia James Should Be Prosecuted 
An opinion piece from Washington Examiner (10/27, Roberts) reported that New York Attorney General Letitia 
James pleaded not guilty in federal court to charges of bank fraud and making false statements to a financial 
institution, offenses that each carry potential penalties of up to 30 years in prison and $1 million in fines. According 
to the article, the case has drawn political outrage across party lines, with critics on the left calling it retaliation and 
some on the right warning of a "banana republic" cycle of revenge, though the author argued that such 
prosecutions have precedent and compared it to past financial fraud cases, including the 1985 conviction of 
Geraldine Ferraro's husband. The article noted that the author viewed James's prosecution as justified, 
emphasizing her responsibility as New York's top legal officer to uphold the law and suggesting that her alleged 
conduct undermines public trust in the justice system. The author assessed that holding James accountable is 
necessary to "end the cycle of partisan prosecutions" and to deter future officials from engaging in politically 
motivated abuses of power.

Financial Content (10/27, Staff Writer) reported that the FBI and the CISA issued urgent warnings ahead of the 
2025 holiday season about a surge in artificial intelligence—driven scams, emphasizing that Al is enabling

contributed to widespread financial losses, with its IC3 reporting hundreds of millions of dollars lost annually to 
non-delivery and credit card fraud, underscoring how Al now fuels scams such as fake package delivery alerts and 
fraudulent retailer impersonations. The article noted that both the FBI and CISA warned consumers and businesses 
to remain vigilant and adopt stronger cybersecurity practices, as AI-generated deception marks a new era in 
cybercrime requiring rapid adaptation by law enforcement, the private sector, and the public.
