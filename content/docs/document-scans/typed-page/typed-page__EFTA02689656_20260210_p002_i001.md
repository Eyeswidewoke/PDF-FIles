Income from Waste 
Recycling Using Waste as 
Resource Concept 
• 
The project annually 
produces about 100 tons of 
organic fertilizer by treating 
430 tons of solid waste. The 
product (compost) is sold to 
fertilizer companies at Tk. 
2500/ton. 
• 
For house-to-house 
waste collection service the 
community pays between 
Tk. 5-10/household/month 
depending upon income level. 
Income from house-to-house 
waste collection fee on 
average is about Tk 5000 per 
month. 
Cost Comparison of 
Conventional System of 
Waste Management and The 
Project Model 
• 
At present, DCC 
spends Tk. 2000 to manage 
per ton of solid waste (this 
includes the collection, 
transportation and disposal 
cost). In order to manage 430 
tons of waste from the 800 
households (which is now 
being managed by the project) 
works at Tk.860, 000/year. 
Cost of construction of the 
recycling/compost plant is Tk. 
900,000 (excluding the land 
cost since it was provided by 
the DCC) 
Total tangible benefits 
Considering the life of this 
pilot project of six years, 
By investing US $ 1 per 
beneficiary, we are getting 
environmental & social 
benefit worth 
US $ 8.9 
(US $ 24/US$ 2.67).
