Former Nevada Lawmaker Sentenced For Campaign Fund Fraud. 
The AP (7/18, Megan) reports from Las Vegas, "A former top Nevada Democratic lawmaker was sentenced 
Thursday to more than two years in federal prison and fined almost $250,000 for misusing campaign funds to 
pay personal bills and open a downtown Las Vegas nightclub where he hosted political fundraisers." The AP 
adds, "Ex-Senate Majority Leader Kelvin Atkinson told U.S. District Judge James Mahan in Las Vegas he was 
embarrassed, and called his fall from grace after 17 years in elected office `regrettable' and `unfortunate."' US 
Attorney Nicholas Trutanich "said poor record keeping kept the FBI from determining how the more than $1.1 
million Atkinson reported receiving in campaign contributions from 2010 to 2017 was spent," but "he said 
investigators found a discrepancy of more than $450,000."

Post, "The scandal started after a pair of online collectors began identifying and documenting cards that were 
allegedly improperly modified," and "four collectors who spoke with investigators say the FBI suspects 
thousands of additional cards with similar issues are still circulating through the hobby." 
FBI Reportedly Probing Oklahoma Charter Schools' Practices, Finances. 
The Tulsa (OK) World (7/18, Eger, 205K) reports that the FBI "and the U.S. Department of Education's law 
enforcement arm have also been probing Epic Charter Schools' student enrollment practices and finances, 
public records obtained by the Tulsa World show." According to the World, "Emails with officials at the 
Oklahoma State Department of Education and Statewide Virtual Charter School Board reveal that federal 
investigators were at work behind the scenes in the years after the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation's 
initial inquiry into allegations of fraud at Epic resulted in no charges." The World adds, "It is unknown 
whether there has been any coordination between state and federal investigators, who have all declined 
comment, but Epic's most recent revenue reports show the financial stakes of any fraudulent practices would 
be much higher for the state of Oklahoma than the federal government."

actively working with law enforcement authorities,' he said." Parkside police "investigating the crime have 
notified the FBI and the Internal Revenue Service."

Schumer Seeks FBI, FTC Probes Of FaceApp. 
The Washington Post (7/18, Denham, I4.2M) reports, "FaceApp was having a viral moment with its AI-
backed photo-editing technology, which transformed celebrities and friends into decades-older versions of 
themselves, until its vague privacy terms and Russian origins began raising concerns among political leaders 
and social media users," and "on Wednesday, Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer asked the FBI and 
the Federal Trade Commission to investigate FaceApp on the grounds its app could pose 'national security and 
privacy risks for millions of U.S. citizens.'" According to the Post, "That same day, the Democratic National 
Committee urged 2020 presidential campaigns to delete the app 'immediately."' DNC officials "got burned by 
Russian hackers during the 2016 race and have since invested heavily in cybersecurity to prevent a repeat." 
Gizmodo (7/18, Brown, 2.7M) reports, "On Wednesday night, Schumer called upon the Federal Trade 
Commission and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to 'look into' FaceApp's data-gathering practices." In a 
letter "sent to FTC Chairman Joseph Simons and FBI Director Christopher Wray, Schumer explained that by 
using the app, users give the company 'full and irrevocable access to their personal photos and data' and give 
the company license to use their content, then lays out his concerns: 'Furthermore, it is unclear how long 
FaceApp retains a user's data or how a user may ensure their data is deleted after usage. These forms of "dark
