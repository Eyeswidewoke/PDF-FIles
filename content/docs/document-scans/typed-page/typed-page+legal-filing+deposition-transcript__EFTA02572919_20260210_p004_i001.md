Gates' greatest disadvantage in this new market is that Microsoft doesn't own any wires into people's homes, nor does it 
have the computers installed to handle all the switching and billing that two-way communication requires. To solve this 
problem, Microsoft needs to make an alliance with a cable company or a telephone company, =or both. Microsoft has 
an alliance with Intel Corporation, the world's =leading manufacturer of microprocessors, and General Instrument, a 
maker of set-top converters, but it is not a very powerful alliance compared =with Bell Atlantic's alliance with Tele-
Communications, Inc., the largest cable company in the United States, or with U S West's alliance =with Time Warner, 
the second-largest cable company. Gates is currently =negotiating an alliance involving Time Warner and Tele-
Communications, =Inc.--a kind of granddaddy of all alliances, which would have the power =to set the standard for the 
information--highway machine. A major issue =in the negotiations will be the extent to which Microsoft would own the 
=software in the machine. Gates would like to retain the rights to the software; Gerald Levin, the C.E.O. of Time Warner, 
and John Malone, the =C.E.O. of T.C.I., will not want to give Gates those rights. 
If Gates does succeed in providing the operating system for the new machine, he will have tremendous influence over 
the =way people communicate with one another: he, more than anyone else, will determine what it is like to use the 
information highway. Another advantage Bill Gates has is that he already lives on the information highway. 
New employees at Microsoft are likely to encounter Bill Gates electronically long before they meet him in person. Some 
get to thinking of him by his E-mail handle, which is "billg," rather than by his real name. You'll be chatting with a 
Microsoft employee in the employee's office, the computer will make a little belch or squeak, indicating an incoming 
piece of electronic mail, and it'll =be E-mail from Bill. It is not unusual to hear a young employee say, "Hey, that's a good 
idea, I'm going to E-mail Bill about that." While I =was attending a lunchtime cookout at Microsoft headquarters one 
day, I =heard several people start conversations by asking about E-mail from Bill: "Did you get mail from Bill today?" "Did 
you see Bill's mail?" Bill and Melinda were in Africa at the time, touring the valley where the oldest human skeleton, 
Lucy, was discovered, but I had the sense that he was present, in the network, flying around the Microsoft campus =and 
popping into people's computers. 
The Microsoft campus looks like a college campus: there are playing fields, and employees in T-shirts and jeans who 
aren't much older than college students. Nowhere on earth do more millionaires and billionaires go to work every day 
than do so here--about twenty-two hundred of the fifteen thousand employees own at least a million dollars' worth of 
Microsoft stock--but the campus is in no respect worldly. Workers spend much of their day staring into large computer 
monitors and occasionally exploding into a rapid fingering of keys. Empty soda cans and cardboard latte cups collect on 
their desks. Designing software--or "writing code," as people in the trade say--is a =sort of intellectual handiwork. 
Operating systems, the most monumental =of all software constructions, are like medieval cathedrals: thousands =of 
laborers toil for years on small parts of them, each one working by =hand, fashioning zeros and ones into patterns that 
control switches inside microprocessors, which constitute the brains of a computer. The =platonic nature of software--it 
is invisible, weightless, and odorless; =it doesn't exist in the physical world--determines much of the culture =that 
surrounds it. At Microsoft, workers often describe each other as "smart" or "supersmart" or "one of the smartest people 
you'll meet around here," and it is almost an article of faith that Bill Gates, who =co-founded the company with Paul 
Allen, a friend from his high-school days, in 1975, when he was nineteen years old, is the smartest person of all. 
"Bill is just smarter than everyone else," Mike Maples, an executive vice-president of Microsoft, says. "There are 
probably more smart people per square foot right here than anywhere else in the world, but Bill is just smarter." 
Gates' office is exactly twice as large as the offices of junior employees, and his carpeting is a little richer than =the 
carpeting in other offices; otherwise, there is nothing fancy about =the place. A large monitor sits on his desk, and on 
the wall behind the =desk are pictures from important moments in Gates' career, many of which coincide with 
important moments in the history of the personal computer. There are also pictures of Gates' two sisters, and of his 
mother and father. (No picture of Melinda French is visible, partly because Gates wants to keep her job as normal as he 
can.) As in all the =Microsoft offices, one rarely hears the sound of a ringing phone. The employees send a total of two 
hundred million E-mail messages to each other every month. (Over at McCaw Cellular Communications, another 
prominent high-tech company, whose headquarters is a few miles from Microsoft's, phones ring all the time, and
