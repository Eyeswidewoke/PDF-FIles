special session of the legislature in August." The prosecutors were joined by "nearly a dozen 
commonwealth's attorneys representing some of Virginia's largest jurisdictions are endorsing 
the push for change." To the Post, their news conference "demonstrated Democrats' hopes for 
implementing substantial measures after winning both houses of the legislature last year and 
expanding the cohort of liberals in prosecutors' offices across the state." 
Trader Joe's Pledges To Change Packaging After Accusations Of Racism. 
The Los Angeles Times (7/21, Lai, 4.64M) reports that Trader Joe's "has come under attack for 
its branding of ethnic foods" with "the names Trader Ming's, Arabian Joe's, Trader Jose's, Trader 
Giotto's and Trader Joe San." An online petition accused the store of "racist" labeling. In 
response, a spokeswoman for Trader Joe's "said the company is changing the packaging and 
expects to complete the process 'very soon." The Times also reports that "inside the Trader 
Joe's in Temecula, shoppers crowded the aisles on Monday," and "were either unconcerned or 
hadn't paid attention to the controversy caused by the product labeling." 
Intern Jonah Gottschalk writes at the Federalist (7/21, Gottschalk, 126K) that the "phony 
outrage at Trader Joe's proves how outlets like the New York Times use 'public pressure' to 
make companies and politicians do what they want." Gottschalk explains that a petition at 
change.org had been up for weeks with few signers, but the New York Times put it on its front 
page on Sunday, and "the story was then swiftly written up by numerous outlets," then "Trader 
Joe's panicked," and "apologized and claimed it will remove the 'light-hearted attempt at 
inclusiveness." Gottschalk writes, "The incident serves as an excellent case study for a new 
form of journalistic malpractice."

18.61M) reports that "with more than 2,000 incidents and little action from the federal 
government, efforts to curtail pandemic-related racism have fallen to P.S.A.s and social media 
campaigns." The new public service announcement by the nonprofit Advertising Council that 
debuted Tuesday "makes a point that federal leaders have largely overlooked: Asian-Americans 
are facing a surge of harassment linked to fears about the coronavirus pandemic."

Planned Parenthood In New York Disavows Margaret Sanger Over Eugenics. 
The New York Times (7/21, Stewart, 18.61M) reports Planned Parenthood of Greater New York 
"will remove the name of Margaret Sanger, a founder of the national organization, from its 
Manhattan health clinic" because of her "harmful connections to the eugenics movement," the 
group said Tuesday. Sanger, a nurse who opened the first birth control clinic in the US, 
supported eugenics, "a discredited belief in improving the human race through selective 
breeding." The Washington Times (7/21, Blake, 492K) reports the group explained the move "is 
both a necessary and overdue step to reckon with our legacy and acknowledge Planned 
Parenthood's contributions to historical reproductive harm within communities of color."
