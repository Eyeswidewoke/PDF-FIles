Into space in a flash 
In an industry in which preparing some missions has taken decades, the speed at which nanosats 
can be developed and put into orbit makes the biggest in the space business take notice. NASA 
has also found ways to leverage the consumer-electronics industry, says Bruce Yost of the space 
agency's Ames Research Centre in California. His group (some former members of which 
founded Planet Labs) has launched five phonesats and is now planning a small fleet of them to 
experiment with communications between satellites. 
Nanosat parts are readily available to researchers. One supplier, Pumpkin, operates from a 
residential San Francisco neighbourhood. Andrew Kalman, its founder, started in 2000 selling 
standard components that Mr Twiggs and his colleagues at Stanford needed. Pumpkin now sells 
items ranging from brackets for a few hundred dollars up to complete systems for hundreds of 
thousands of dollars. The company has also supplied America's National Reconnaissance Office 
with 12 three-unit CubeSats to help the agency demonstrate the technology. 
Although many satellites already circle the globe taking pictures, some of the images may not be 
updated for days, months or even years. Commercial services can provide relatively rapid 
satellite images on demand, a number of them taking pictures down to a resolution of 50cm (ie, 
50cm x 50cm per pixel, the legal limit in America for commercial satellites, although military 
ones can peer closer). But such satellites may cover only part of the globe each day. Once their 
fleets are complete, Planet Labs will offer images with resolutions of between 500cm to 300cm 
and Skybox, with its bigger minisatellites, 90cm. The companies will provide pictures that can be 
updated in hours for a variety of scientific and commercial applications. 
They could, for instance, be used to track environmental conditions, illegal tree-felling or 
changes in the course of rivers—which, even in their initial deployment, Planet Labs has 
discovered happen surprisingly often. The frequency of satellite passes opens up many new 
possibilities, says Skybox's Mr Berkenstock. His firm can offer a stream of analysis, such as the 
number of trees in a forest or the number of cars at various times of the day in parking lots 
across America. Transport patterns can be followed, infrastructure monitored, the planting of 
fields, plumes from smokestacks and ships in ports can all be observed. Overlaying more and 
more data will provide much richer visualisation, adds Mr Berkenstock. 
Nor will all the nanosats be looking downwards. Sensors facing sideways and upwards from low-
Earth orbit will allow researchers to carry out a large number of experiments and to take 
measurements that have previously been too costly to consider. This includes detecting solar and 
cosmic radiation, interactions between magnetic fields and other forces which together make up 
what is called space weather. Measuring and predicting space weather could be used to protect 
billion-dollar satellites and prevent astronauts from receiving high doses of radiation. Many 
satellites measure aspects of space weather, but they tend to do so only in certain directions. Part 
of the failed KickSat experiment was to use the sprites to see if arrays of inexpensive devices 
could constantly monitor such forces. 
Nanosats may be inexpensive, but resisting gravity's inexorable ull comes with a rice tag.
