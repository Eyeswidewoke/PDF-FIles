The Washington Examiner (10/8, Dibble, 448K) reports, "Wray has denied that there is a 
significant threat to election security from potential voter fraud during recent testimony before 
Congress. He acknowledged that there was fraud "at the local level from time to time," but 
maintained that the issue was not a wide-scale threat. The Trump administration expressed 
frustrated with that testimony, including White House chief of staff Mark Meadows who 
questioned Wray's leadership of the FBI." 
The Hill (10/8, Samuels, 2.98M) reports that Trump "swiped at two of his most loyal 
Cabinet members and his FBI director in a phone interview with Fox Business as he worked 
himself into a rage over the Russia investigation and the 2016 election." The Hill adds, "The 
president complained at length about the lack of consequences for Hillary Clinton and other 
members of the Obama administration for the former's use of a private email server and the 
latter's involvement in launching an investigation into Russia interference in the 2016 election. 
Trump turned his frustration toward Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Attorney General Bill 
Barr, lamenting that they had not done enough to speed the process of implicating his political 
opponents." Trump "also took aim at the current FBI director, Christopher Wray, who has come 
under scrutiny from Trump allies for what they believe is slow-walking efforts to find 
wrongdoing in the Obama administration." 
Bloomberg (10/8, Strohm, 4.73M) reports that Trump "lashed out" at Barr "for not doing 
more to prosecute his political enemies, including arresting Obama-era officials who the 
president accuses - without evidence - of illegally spying on his 2016 campaign." Barr "has 
echoed some of Trump's other election-related allegations, but hasn't gone as far as the 
president wants on this one. U.S. attorney John Durham, Barr's hand-picked prosecutor looking 
into the so-called spygate allegations, isn't expected to issue charges or release a report before 
the election, according to a Justice Department official. `To be honest, Bill Barr is going to go 
down as either the greatest attorney general in the history of the country or he's going to down 
as a very sad situation,' Trump said in an interview on Fox Business Network. 'I said I'm not 
going to get involved, but I'm going to have to get involved.'" 
The Washington Post (10/8, Blake, 14.2M) reports, "Trump built upon tweets this week 
suggesting Barr needs to start indicting people tied to the Russia investigation, while explicitly 
citing President Barack Obama and Biden. `Unless Bill Barr indicts these people for crimes - the 
greatest political crime in the history of our country - then we're going to get little satisfaction, 
unless I win,' Trump said, adding that he `won't forget it' and that the crime `includes Obama, 
and that includes Biden." Trump "also expressed rare dissatisfaction with Pompeo, who he said 
should release some sort of new information on Hillary Clinton's emails. `They're in the State 
Department, but Mike Pompeo has been unable to get them out, which is very sad actually. I'm 
not happy about him for that reason,' Trump said. `He was unable to get that. I don't know why. 
You're running the State Department; you're able to get them out."
