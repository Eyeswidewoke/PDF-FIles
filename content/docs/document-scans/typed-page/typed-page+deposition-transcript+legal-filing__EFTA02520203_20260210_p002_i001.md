August =8, 2013, 2:20 =.m. 
They laughed =hen Leon Botstein became president of Bard College in 1975, at the very =dea that a 28-
year-old could enliven a venerable New York liberal arts college. They laughed in 1990 when Botstein =tarted the Bard 
Music Festival, which had the appearance of a vanity =peration for his own seemingly dubious ambitions as a conductor. 
They =aughed once more when he became music director of the American Symphony Orchestra 20 years ago, especially 
after some =ocky early performances and scathing reviews. 
From what I gather some =merican orchestras were laughing this summer at the very notion of =otstein 
making his Hollywood Bowl debut. The Los Angeles Philharmonic was the first major American orchestra to =nvite 
Botstein to conduct. That debut was Tuesday night in a program of =rokofiev and Shostakovich. It was a success. 
Then again, so is Bard College, =hich Botstein has made a progressive leader in many areas of education. 
=o is the Bard Music Festival, which continues to be, year after year under Botstein, the summer's =ost stimulating music 
festival. And so is the American Symphony, which =otstein has used to spearhead the kind of adventurous thematic 
=rogramming that many other orchestras are now looking at as a way to remain relevant. 
Why, therefore, all the worry, especially =iven that Botstein has had an active career guest conducting in 
Western =nd Eastern Europe and served as music director of the Jerusalem Symphony for eight years? =e's even begun 
getting rave reviews in New York. 
Part of the problem is that, =erhaps out its own insecurity, America's music establishment has a =istory 
of mistrusting intellectuals. And Botstein happens to be someone "The Colbert =eport" can turn to when looking for an 
egghead. 
The populist, picnic-friendly =owl, with its large video screens, may seem like the last place for an 
=cademic. And yet Botstein's basically hands-off interpretive approach served him exceedingly well in a =ensational 
performance of Prokofiev's Second Violin Concerto with =ennifer Koh as soloist. Botstein may keep an objective, 
emotional =istance as a conductor, but he also had no intention of getting in the way of an intensely passionate violinist. 
This was, believe it or not, the =11-around most compelling performance of anything I've heard all 
summer =t the Bowl. For once, the amphitheater's many moving parts were placed at the service of an extraordinary 
=oloist, who dug into the concerto with an unrelenting =ntensity. 
Botstein provided Koh with a secure =ramework in which to operate. The L.A. Phil, which had sounded 
like it =ad entered into late summer doldrums last week, came roaring back to life on a sultry evening. The =ew sound 
system was more vibrant than ever, capturing the bodily =ubstance of Koh's sound. 
At last, even =he controversial high definition video was just fine. Finally, the =olors on screen matched 
the stage, and so did the luminosity, no longer fighting the music or forcing your attention to go where you =ay not want 
it. Koh was so worth watching that I almost wish the Los =ngeles Opera would consider installing video when Koh 
returns to town =n October as Einstein in the Philip Glass and Robert Wilson opera "Einstein on the Beach" at the 
Dorothy Chandler =avilion (just kidding.) 
The big piece Tuesday was Shostakovich's =enth Symphony. Botstein introduced the night by placing the 
program in =he context of Soviet music. Prokofiev's concerto was written in 1935 just before he returned from =he West 
to Russia. The composer then had to spend the rest of his life =ontending with Stalin, and both died, coincidentally, in 
1953 on the =ame day. 
Shostakovich's Tenth, written just after =talin's death, is often interpreted as a bitter reproach to the 
=ictator. The first movement is long and moody. The second movement is a macabre march; the third, a =eird waltz. 
Derisive anger bubbles up everywhere. The last movement is =uminative and ferocious. Climaxes hit you over the head.
