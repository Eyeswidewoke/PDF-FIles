Deborah is a partner in the 
ni'Cla Department, 
where she focuses on the tax aspects of domestic and 
cross-border osrporate transactions. including mergers 
and acquisitions, joint ventues, spin offs and financial 
instruments. She has been the principal tax lawyer on 
numennis strategic acquisitions, private equity buyouts, 
spin-ofTs and other transactions. 
It has become conventional wisdom that public stockholders tend 
not to assign full value to the tax attributes of a corporation. 
Similarly, public stockholders apparently do not discount the 
value of a corporation to account fully for future payments to 
be made under a TRA. A possible explanation for this is that 
the tax attributes, and especially the terms of TRAs, are not 
fully understood by public stockholders, even though these 
agreements are publicly disclosed. 
In addition, public company valuations generally are based 
on EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depredation 
and amortization) which disregards tax attributes because 
EBITDA does not take account of taxes. Another reason may 
be that tax attributes are difficult to value accurately, because 
any valuation would rely on income projections and other 
assumptions about the corporation's ability to use the tax 
attributes in the future. 
In IRAs where the specified tax attribute is basis in the cor-
poration's assets, the payments are sometimes viewed as 
compensation to historic equity owners who incur an upfront 
tax on the sale of their equity in connection with the IPO and 
who agree to structure the transaction so that it delivers an 
asset basis step-up for the corporation. Often, however, this 
tax would be incurred regardless of whether the transaction 
resulted in a basis step-up to the corporation. 
Therefore, it may be that TRAs relate simply to value. 
Through the TRA, the IPO corporation pays for a valuable 
tax attribute (for example, a basis step-up), just as a buyer of 
assets would normally pay more than a buyer of stock because 
of the basis step-up that a buyer obtains in an asset sale. In 
a stock sale, the corporation's basis in its assets generally 
remains unchanged.

COMMON TYPES OF TRAs 
Typically, a corporation enters into aTRA with the owners 
immediately prior to the IPO of the equity of the business 
being sold. Investors who purchase stock in the offering do 
not enter into the TRA. 
Under aTRA, the corporation agrees to make payments to the 
historic equity owners in an amount equal to a percentage of 
the benefit the corporation derives from certain specified tax 
attributes, if, as and when realized.The specified tax attribute 
is most often basis in the corporation's assets (a Basis TRA). 
A corporation's basis in its assets generates amortization and 
depredation deductions over time. In other deals, the specified 
tax attribute is a net operating loss (NOL) existing at the time 
of the IPO (an NOL TRA). NOLs can be used over time to 
reduce a corporation's taxable income. In at least one deal, 
the specified tax attribute was a deduction arising from the 
exercise of compensatory stock options (a Stock Option TRA). 
BASIS TRAs 
In a Basis TRA, the specified tax attribute results from a pre-
IPO restructuring specifically designed to deliver a fair market 
value basis in the public company's assets.This type of IPO is 
sometimes referred to as a `supercharged" IPO and generally 
takes one of two forms: 
■ Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 338(h)( I 0) 
transaction. 
• Up-C structure. 
In both the Section 338(h)( I 0) transaction and the Up-C 
structure, the valuable tax attribute is an asset basis step-up 
for the public company. The value of a basis step-up lies in the 
resulting incremental increase in depreciation or amortization 
tax deductions. 
Basis attributable to goodwill and certain other intangibles is 
especially valuable, both because these assets can be amortized 
over 1 S years and because these assets tend to represent a
