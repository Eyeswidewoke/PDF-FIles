little girl, however, is still with us and less likely to be addressed by lay people and 
even professionals. In reality child victims of sexual abuse and exploitation can be 
boys as well as girls, and not all victims are "angels" or even little." The idea that 
some children might enjoy certain sexual activity or behave like human beings 
and engage in sexual acts as a way of receiving attention, affection, gifts, and 
money is troubling for society and many investigators. 
. 
Depending on the nature of the abuse and techniques 
of the offender, investigators must understand that the 
victim may have many positive feelings for the offender 
and even resent law-enforcement intervention. The 
investigator must be able to discuss a wide variety of sexual 
activities, understand the victim's terminology, and avoid 
being judgmental. Not being judgmental is much more 
difficult with a delinquent adolescent engaged in homo-
sexual activity with a prominent clergyman than with a 
sweet 5-year-old girl abused by a low-life" stranger. Inves-
tigators often nonverbally communicate their judgmental 
attitude through gestures, facial expressions, and body lan-
guage. Many investigators do a poor job of interviewing 
children because deep down inside they really do not want 
to hear the detailed answers. 
Another emotion-related problem that occurs frequently during subject and 
suspect interviews is the inability of some investigators to control or conceal their 
anger and outrage at the offender's behavior. They often want to spend as little 
time as possible with the offender. Occasionally investigators have the opposite 
problem and are confused that they have sympathetic feelings for the offender. 
Many investigators also find it difficult to discuss deviant sexual behavior calmly, 
objectively, nonjudgmentally, and in detail with anyone much less an alleged child 
molester or d child. 
An investigator who gets too emotionally involved in a 
case is more likely to make mistakes and errors in judg-
ment. He or she might wind up losing a case and allowing a 
child molester to go free because the defendant's rights were 
violated in some way. The officer is also less likely to inter-
view and assess a child victim properly and objectively. 
Investigators must learn to recognize and control these 
feelings. If they cannot, they should not be assigned to child-
sexual-victimization cases or, at least, not to the interview 
phase.

The "Big-Picture" Approach 
Although this chapter cannot cover in detail the investiga-
tion of all types of cases, it can serve to alert investigators to 
the "big-picture" approach to the sexual victimization of 
children. Investigators must stop looking at child sexual 
exploitation through a keyhole—focusing only on one act 
by one offender against one victim on one day. Law 
enforcement must "kick the door open" and take the "big-
picture" approach—focusing on offender typologies, 
patterns of behavior, multiple acts, multiple victims, child 
pornography, and proactive techniques.
