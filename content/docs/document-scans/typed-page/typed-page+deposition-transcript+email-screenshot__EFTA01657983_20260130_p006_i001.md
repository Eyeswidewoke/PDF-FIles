copy, apparently recorded off of a computer screen." For the first time, the videos "show how a 
call about an alleged fake $20 bill on Memorial Day escalated into a deadly encounter that 
would ignite global outrage." 
On the CBS Evening NewsVi (8/3, story 8, 2:05, O'Donnell, 4.37M), Jeff Pegues reported, 
"For the first time, two leaked body camera videos show the encounter with George Floyd from 
the officer's perspective. In one, officer Thomas Lane confronts Floyd, trying to get him out of 
an SUV, a gun aimed in his direction. Later in the footage, Floyd drops to the ground as officers 
lead him toward a squad car." George Floyd: "I'm claustrophobic, man. Please, man." Pegues: 
"The other video...appears to come from body cam worn by rookie officer Alexander Keung. It 
shows Floyd resisting officers trying to place him in the squad car. You hear him pleading." 
Floyd: "God, I'm claustrophobic, man. Can I get in the front?" Pegues: "There is now an 
investigation into the leak of that body camera video." 
Kentucky State Police Probe Of Barbeque Cook's Shooting During Protests Is 
Complete. 
The AP (8/3) reports from Louisville, Kentucky, "A Kentucky State Police investigation into the 
fatal shooting of a Louisville barbecue cook during street protests against racism has been 
completed and handed over to prosecutors." The AP adds, "Investigators turned over the 
findings in David McAtee's May 31 shooting death to the Commonwealth's Attorney in Louisville 
for review, said J. Michael Brown, secretary of the state's executive Cabinet. Brown said the file 
would be shared with the FBI, which is conducting a separate investigation. 'There's nothing to 
suggest, from the evidence collected so far, that there's any significant difference between the 
sequence of events and actions that were previously reported or captured on videos,' Brown 
said during a governor's news briefing Monday." 
The Louisville (KY) Courier-Journal (8/3, Ladd, 368K) reports, "The McAtee file isn't 
closed, Brown said, adding there is "nothing to suggest" in the evidence that there is 
'significant difference' between what has been reported and shown in videos from the night 
McAtee was shot." McAtee, 53, "who often fed police at YaYa's BBQ, was fatally shot by the 
Kentucky National Guard in the doorway to his West End business at about 12:15 a.m. on June 
1. Louisville Metro Police and the Guard were sent to disperse a crowd after curfew in the 
parking lot at 26th Street and Broadway next to YaYa's BBQ, where McAtee worked and lived. 
The curfew was in place because of protests - some marred by violence - over the police 
shooting of Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old Black woman who died in her South End apartment." 
WHAS-TV Louisville, KY (8/3, Daniels, 99K) reports, "Brown said the findings were not 
different from what they revealed in June. He confirmed the popular barbecue business owner 
was killed by a bullet from the gun of a Kentucky National Guardsman. Despite the forensics, 
they may not be able to determine which guardsman fired the fatal shot. He said McAtee did 
have a gun during the incident and had gunshot residue on his hands." 
Louisville Lawmakers Authorize Subpoenas After Officials Decline To Testify In Taylor 
Probe. 
The Louisville (KY) Courier-Journal (8/3, Costello, 368K) reports, "The Metro Council committee 
investigating Mayor Greg Fischer's handling of the Breonna Taylor case and ongoing racial 
justice protests authorized its first subpoenas on Monday, after administration officials declined 
to testify in open session." The Courier-Journal adds, "Louisville's chief of public safety and 
interim police chief appeared in person for Monday's special hearing, but their attorneys said 
both would be unable to testify unless the committee went into closed session, citing a recently 
filed federal lawsuit and state law around open meetings. That legal argument didn't convince 
many committee members, with the chairman, Councilman Brent Ackerson, D-26th District, 
suggesting the mayor's administration was trying to hide behind the lawsuit."
