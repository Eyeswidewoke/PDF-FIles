O 
Both U.S. and euro high-
yield markets suffered in 
early July from increasing 
concerns around Greece and 
the Chinese equities market. 
There were outflows from 
U.S. high-yield bonds and 
low liquidity in the European 
market led to sharp daily 
price and sentiment swings. 
But these high-yield sectors 
strengthened after signs of 
progress on Greece and we 
remain positive here on a 3-
to 12-month horizon. In the 
United States default rates 
are expected to remain low as 
issuers have largely refinanced 
maturities into 2017 and 
beyond.

Overall U.S. retail-sales growth 
has been relative€y modest 
in recent months with, for 
example, 1.0% year-on-year 
growth in May followed by 
a 1.4% gain in June. Part of 
this has been due to a tall in 
gasoline-station sales due 
to lower gasoline prices, 
year-on-year. But some areas 
of consumer-discretionary 
(as distinct from consumer-
staples) spending have 
continued to perform strongly, 
including auto sales. This has 
been reflected in resilient 
performance by the S&P 
500 Consumer Discretionary 
Index, which reached a year-
to-date high in mid-July. We 
expect a continued pickup 
in consumer-discretionary 
spending as 2015 progresses, 
encouraged by further labor-
market improvement, wage 
growth and higher household 
net worth.

Cloud computing may boost 
software spending at the 
expense of services spending.
