Corporate Credit: Back to school - The edge of nomiality 
From a credit market perspective we tend to be more interested in oil based 
commodities and the industrial metals. Over the past year the oil price has had 
a particularly negative impact on the US HY Energy sector. As we can see in 
our often used chart in Figure 13 the recent move lower in oil prices, breaking 
through the $40 barrier for the first time since C11 2009 in August, had seen 
credit spreads in the US Energy sector widen to more than 1,000bps, 
comfortably wider than the late 2014 wides. The rebound in recent days has 
seen us tighten back from these wides. 
The question that this continues to pose for the EUR HY market is whether or 
not we should expect to see spillover from the weakness in the USD market. A 
look at Figure 14, which shows the YTO performance of EUR vs. USD HY 
credit by sector, suggests that we may not see contagion. Specifically looking 
at the Basic Materials and Oil & Gas sectors we can see that while in the USD 
market YTD total returns are comfortably in negative territory, the same 
sectors in the EUR market are still showing positive YTD returns. In fact EUR 
Oil & Gas remains the best performing sector YTD. Looking across other 
sectors we can see that the relative outperformance from EUR credit has not 
been isolated to the commodity related sectors, although this is clearly the 
most notable outperformance. Of the non-financial sectors only the Health 
Care sector has seen greater returns in USD than EUR. EUR outperformance 
ranges from 0.04%-0.95%, although it has looked better in recent weeks.

Commodity exposure - EUR HY not like USD HY 
So YTD there has been little or no spillover for EUR HY credit from the obvious 
commodity related weakness we've seen in the USD HY market. Looking at 
the relative compositions of the two markets suggests the EUR market is 
significantly less exposed to commodity related issuers and therefore the sell-
off we've seen in the USD market may not impact EUR credit to such an extent 
unless the weakness is driven by a broader slide in global demand that applies 
negative pressure to European growth.
