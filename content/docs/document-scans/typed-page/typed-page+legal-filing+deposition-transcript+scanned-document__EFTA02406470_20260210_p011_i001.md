That Israel's two most senior political figures don't see eye t= eye on the weightiest issues of the day is hardly 
unprecedented. Israel=92s first prime minister, David Ben-Gurion, is said to have imbued the presidency with zero 
executive powers precisely to=prevent his political rival, Chaim Weizmann, from having a role in the dec=sion making. 
But it's a reminder that even as Israel edges toward confro=tation with Iran, in defiance of Washington, how to deal with 
the mullahs is the subject of fierce debate i=side Israel—not just within the political establishment but also in the =ilitary 
and the intelligence community. It's also a reflection of Netanyahu's dimini=hed status among a certain group of 
politicians, public figures, and journ=lists who believed three years ago that Netanyahu would surprise everyone 9 
striking a deal with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. Peres is merely the latest member of the group to face 
disi=lusionment. "For a long time, Peres nurtured the hope that with his inpu= and consultation, Netanyahu would be 
much more forthcoming and active in =he peace process," says David Landau, who has coauthored two books with 
Peres and sees him regularly. "But of =ate, Peres has given up that hope."

The backstory of the bromance betw=en Peres and Netanyahu is a complicated one. In 1996 the two had squared o=f in 
one of Israel's most fiercely fought elections for prime minister, just months after a right-wing Jew murdered =sraeli 
leader Yitzhak Rabin in a bid to halt the Oslo peace process. Peres=succeeded Rabin, but then lost to Netanyahu by less 
than half a percentage=point, leaving the Israeli left with the feeling that the assassin had won—and casting a dark cloud 
over=the fate of the peace process. Yossi Beilin, who served as a member of Per=s's cabinet at the time, recalls feeling 
bereft, "really broken," wh=n results were announced. Yet he found Peres remarkably composed. He remembers 
overhearing Peres ask his wife on =he phone that day what she was cooking. When the answer, chicken, came bac=, 
Peres gave her the standard response: I'll be home for lunch. The ability to rebound from defeat was vintage P=res, but 
he didn't seem to harbor a grudge against Netanyahu, which surp=ised people around him. Peres is not above bad-
mouthing political enemies=97his decades-long rivalry with Rabin, a member of his own party, produced some seriously 
nasty invective. But pe=ple who know him say they've never heard him utter a bad word about Neta=yahu, either after 
the election or in the years since. Landau attributes t=e courtesy to a certain reverence for Yoni Netanyahu, Benjamin's 
brother, who was killed leading the darin= rescue of hostages at Entebbe in 1976. Peres, who served as defense minis=er 
at the time, dispatched Yoni on the mission and carries the burden of e=fectively having signed his death warrant. 
One way or another, Peres seems to have welcomed Netanyahu's retu=n to the prime minister's office in 2009, even as 
members of the peace c=mp cringed. By then Peres had been serving as president for almost two years and was able to 
lend a hand by, among ot=er things, smoothing early wrinkles in Netanyahu's relationship with Oba=a. But the good will 
appears to have run out last September, when Netanyah= vetoed a meeting Peres was to have held with Abbas in 
Amman, Jordan. The two had met secretly on four previou= occasions in what amounted to the most vigorous surge of 
diplomacy betwee= Israelis and Palestinians in years. Netanyahu hoped the meetings would di=ert Abbas from 
petitioning the United Nations for membership, according to a source in Netanyahu's inne= circle, a move Israel feared 
would lead to its isolation. When Abbas pres=ed ahead with the U.N. initiative, Netanyahu terminated the Peres 
backchan=el. About the prospects of an agreement with the=Palestinians, Peres said the gaps were small, a 
characterization that is a= odds with even the most upbeat assessments in the region. 
In the interview with Newsweek, Peres sidestepped questions about t=nsions with Netanyahu. At 88, Peres has more 
than a quarter century on the=lsraeli prime minister, a gap that seems to infuse even his frustrations with an avuncular 
spirit. But he did say r=peatedly that giving time for sanctions against Iran to work was the right=thing to do (Netanyahu 
has said the sanctions aren't enough and has made=clear to the Americans that Israel might launch airstrikes). He also 
said Obama appeared to have a "deep co=viction" that Iran must not get the bomb, in contrast to the skepticism =ome 
people around Netanyahu express about the American president. "Let=92s give the necessary time to see the effect of 
the economic sanctions," he said in his Jerusalem office. "There is=quite an important alliance to prevent it from 
happening [Iran developing =uclear weapons]. Give them a chance." 
About the prospects of an agreement with the Palestinians, Peres sa=d the gaps were small, a characterization that is at 
odds with even the mo=t upbeat assessments in the region. Israelis and Palestinians have not engaged in sustained talks 
in more than three ye=rs, the longest diplomatic drought since the start of the Oslo peace proce=s in 1993. Most 
observers believe that both sides are moving away from an =greement that would resolve their conflict, not toward one.
