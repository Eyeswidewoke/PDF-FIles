and protest violence, as well as the actions of vigilante militias." The Washington Examiner 
(9/2, Lim, 448K) reports Biden told reporters, "There's been overwhelming requests that I do 
come. Because what we want to do is we've got to heal, we've got to put things together, bring 
people together. My purpose in going is to do just that, to be a positive influence." The 
Milwaukee Journal Sentinel (9/2, Beck, 632K) reports, "It's the first visit to Wisconsin by Biden 
this year, and the first to the state by a Democratic presidential nominee since 2012." 
Bloomberg (9/2, Pager, 4.73M) reports Biden has already "spoken with Blake's family, 
[and] said Wednesday that the officer should face charges for the incident." Trump "declined to 
speak with Blake's mother because she wanted lawyers to monitor the conversation." The New 
York Times (9/2, Goldmacher, Haberman, 18.61M) reports that the Biden campaign has also 
"unveiled a new television ad condemning the rioters and looters that have vexed some 
American cities as he races to cut off President Trump's efforts to define the Democrats as the 
party of lawlessness." 
White House Deputy Press Secretary Brian Morgenstern said on Fox News' America's 
Newsroom (9/2, 896K), "It's too little, too late. I mean, it's unfortunate that violence and 
rioting and the President, President Trump, taking that seriously is finally what will get a 
Democratic presidential candidate to visit the people of Wisconsin." RNC Chair Ronna McDaniel 
said on Fox News' Bill Hemmer Reports (9/2), "Joe Biden doesn't know how to lead, so I'm glad 
he's following in the President's footsteps." 
Townhall (9/2, McCarthy, 177K) says that after Trump "demonstrated leadership for the 
people of Kenosha, who have experienced the devastation first-hand, Biden is now reversing 
course and plans to visit Kenosha on Thursday." The Kenosha News (9/2, Lee, 63K) reports, 
"Both Trump and Joe Biden have condemned the physical damage done to the city while also 
both saying they support non-destructive demonstrations." Bloomberg (9/2, Epstein, 4.73M), 
Politico (9/2, Korecki, 4.29M), and the CNBC (9/2, 3.62M) website are among the other outlets 
covering Biden's planned visit. 
Former Owner Of Store Attended Trump Roundtable After Current Owners 
Refused. USA Today (9/2, Cummings, Beck, Glauber, 10.31M) reports the owners of Rode's 
Camera Shop in Kenosha declined to meet with Trump during his visit. Paul Willette told the 
Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, "I didn't want anything to do with President Trump. If it were any 
other president I would, but not this one." Co-owner Tom Gram "was surprised to see on TV 
that Trump was instead joined by" the store's former owner John Rode, who sold it to his two 
former employees nine years ago, who "was very supportive of the president." The President 
described Rode as the owner of the business during a roundtable discussion. 
"Antifa.com" Redirects To Biden Site. The New York Times (9/2, Epstein, Alba, 
18.61M) reports that Antifa.com redirects to Biden's campaign website. The Times says "the 
switch is a prank, one that ties (Biden) to a largely online, far-left activist network to which 
President Trump has falsely sought to link" Biden. Several weeks ago, "right-wing influencers 
began tweeting about the website forwarding," and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) shared the link 
Tuesday in a since-deleted tweet. 
Barr Says Blake Was Armed And "In The Midst Of Committing A Felony." 
The New York Post (9/2, Tacopino, 4.57M) reports Attorney General Barr said Wednesday that 
Jacob Blake "was committing a felony and armed when a police officer in Kenosha, Wisconsin 
shot him seven times in the back." Contrasting the case with the death of George Floyd, Barr 
told CNN, "Floyd was already subdued, incapacitated in handcuffs and was not armed. In the 
Jacob case, he was in the midst of committing a felony and he was armed." Attorneys for Blake 
"said that Barr was simply `misinformed' on the facts of the case." 
Chicago Alderman Urges National Guard Deployment In City. 
Fox News (9/2, Kaplan, 27.59M) reports on its website that Chicago Alderman Anthony 
Napolitano called on city officials "to request the National Guard be deployed to the city
