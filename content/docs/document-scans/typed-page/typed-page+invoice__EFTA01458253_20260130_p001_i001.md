Portfolio 
Our asset-class allocation in a balanced 
portfolio 
Traditional asset classes 
Within the core part of our balanced portfolio, we 
cover traditional liquid assets such as equities, fixed 
income and commodities. The chart shows how we 
would currently design a balanced portfolio, including 
alternative asset classes.' 
a Equities 
Equities have been unsettled by developments in China, but 
fundamentals in the developed markets remain sound. U.S. 
second-quarter corporate earnings came in better than expected 
and European earnings growth (excluding energy stocks) was 
even stronger. Japanese earnings have also increased. Volatility 
is likely to increase around a Fed rate hike but could create 
buying opportunities. Emerging markets have found the going 
tougher and could suffer further both from a U.S. rate hike 
and also developments in China. Emerging-market equities in 
economies with substantial current-account deficits could be 
particularly vulnerable. 
■ Fixed income 
Once the Fed starts hiking rates, the pace is expected to gentle, 
meaning that major-developed-market government yields are 
unlikely to increase sharply over the next 12 months. With 
the ECB persevering with quantitative easing, the differential 
between U.S. Treasuries and German Bunds is also likely to 
continue. On the corporate side, high levels of recent issuance 
help keep us cautious on investment grade. U.S. high-yield could 
be affected by concerns over energy-sector borrowers, but we 
continue to see some opportunities in this asset class. Emerging-
markets hard-currency debt may offer relatively high yields, but 
also increasing levels of risk. 
a Commodities 
Commodity prices face two key headwinds: a strong U.S. 
dollar and concerns about Chinese demand. In the case of oil, 
worries about possible future increases in supply will continue 
to create additional downwards pressure. While lower prices 
will eventually lead to lower supply, this process is likely to take 
time. Evidence of stronger Chinese growth might provide some 
support. but a sharp rebound in oil and other commodity prices 
looks most unlikely. Gold has benefited to a limited extent from 
recent market uncertainty but a rise in interest rates would 
probably be a negative for this commodity.
