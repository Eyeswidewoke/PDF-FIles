Share Price Decline Unwarranted 
Concerts; overdone. Valuation compelling at 1O 
1EE vs Do:: at 14 tihi Bav 
Eastman shares fell 8% despite a solid 02 beat and the reaffirming of '14 
guidance as investors focused on i) new '15 guidance of $7.50-$8.00 (vs $8 
previously) and ii) a lowering of '14 Fibers (largest and highest margin 
segment) EBIT guidance by 6%. We believe investor concerns are overdone as 
i) Eastman has been backing away from the $8 target for months and, as 
evidenced by consensus of $7.77, was not viewed as achievable either and ii) 
Fibers is under-earning in '14 due to destocking, lower demand and reduced 
operating rates. With valuation a compelling 10.6x '15 EPS vs 14.8x for Dow 
and Q2 evidencing a more predictable and resilient earnings generator, Buy. 
O2 bears by $O U.  " 14 guidance of 56.70-37 .00 rear firmed (cons. 36 931 
Eastman reported Q2 EPS of $1.92, up 7%, and $0.08 or 4% above consensus. 
An unplanned outage at Eastman's Kingsport plant reduced sales by $10MM 
(in Specialty Fluids & Intermediates {SFI)), EBIT by S10MM (evenly divided 
between Advanced Mat'ls, Fibers and SFI) and EPS by $0.05. Prior to the 
outage, consensus was $1.88. A lower than expected tax rate added $0.01. 
The upside was driven by stronger than expected results in Adhesives & 
Plasticizers (AP) and SFI. Sales rose 1% on flat volumes and price while FX 
added 1°!.. EBIT fell 3% to $441MM while margins compressed 70bps YoY 
(+130 000) to 17.9% on higher propane costs. Eastman repurchased $100MM 
of stock in 02 and has $640MM left under its $16 authorization. Eastman 
reaffirmed its full year guidance range of $6.70-$7.00, up 4-9% (cons: $6.93). 
Loyieting 145 EPS by 0.05 to 36.90. Lowe' ins '155 EPS by SO OS to $y.70 
Notwithstanding a solid Q2 release, Eastman shares fell 8% due to concerns 
over lowered '15 EPS and '14 Fibers guidance. Another driver, in our view, was 
the wide $0.30 guidance range for 2H14 as it implies a high degree of volatility 
in Eastman's business. A slight narrowing of the range to 56.75-$6.95, in our 
view, would have alleviated this concern. For 2H14, we expect slightly lower 
EPS for Eastman due to destocking in Fibers, a slowdown in heat transfer 
fluids (China) and a planned outage at the company's largest ethylene cracker 
in Longview, TX ($20MM, or $0.10 impact in Q4). Looking ahead to '15, we 
believe Fiber earnings will recover modestly post destocking and lower plant 
operating rates in '14. While we concur with Eastman's view that Fiber 
earnings are plateauing, we believe EBIT will be higher in '15 at -$500MM vs 
the depressed level of $480MM in '14. And with EBITDA of $550MM and 
capex of just $50MM. Fibers should be strong source of cash to fund growth 
(M&A, buybacks). For all of '15, we believe Eastman has a number of tailwinds 
that should drive earnings well above $7.50 including: normalized operations 
(outages/turnarounds: $0.20), lower propane costs ($0.15-$0.20). acquisitions 
($0.10-plus), base business growth ($0.35) and share buybacks ($0.20). To 
reflect lower Fibers earnings, we are trimming our '14E EPS by $0.05 to $6.90, 
up 7% and our '15E by $0.05 to $7.70 up 12%.

Our $100 target price is based on 
Eastman trading at 13x '15E EPS in 
12mos, a 12% discount to its 
differentiated chemical peer Dow. Risks: 
weaker tire demand, 
increased leverage and the Solutia 
integration.
