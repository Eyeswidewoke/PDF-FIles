bomb was discovered. Then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) also passed by the bomb before it was discovered 
and safely removed by authorities. The Washington Examiner (05/29, Notheis) reported that Deputy Director 
Bongino also stated on Fox & Friends that evidence from former FBI Director James Comey's time at the agency 
was found, which he said was in a room "hidden from us." "I wouldn't call it hidden, but hidden from us at least 
and not mentioned to us, and then we found stuff in there and a lot of it's from the Comey-era, and we are working 
our damndest right now to declassify," he said. "And just so you know, because I get the public, I totally understand 
people saying, 'Well, do it now: The process is that not all information is ours to declassify; some is from other 
intelligence agencies, it's not— we literally can't do it. Once that gets done and that gets out there, and you read 
some of the stuff, we found that, by the way, was not processed through the normal procedure, digitizing it, putting 
it in FBI records. We found it in bags hiding under Jim Comey's FBI, and you're going to be stunned!" The New York 
Post (05/29, Crane, King) reported that Deputy Director Bongino announced that the FBI will release video footage 
to debunk conspiracy theories surrounding Jeffrey Epstein's death. The video allegedly shows that no one was 
present in Epstein's jail cell at the time of his death, supporting the conclusion that he died by suicide. Deputy 
Director Bongino stated that the footage will be released after it has been cleaned up and enhanced, and will 
include the original video to ensure transparency. Additional reporting on the story was provided by Daily Mail

Bernard Kerik, Who Led NYPD on 9/11 Before Prison and Pardon, Has Died at 69 
The Associated Press (05/29, Staff Writer) reported that Bernard Kerik, the former New York City police 
commissioner, has died at the age of 69. Kerik led the NYPD on 9/11 and was later nominated to head the U.S. 
Department of Homeland Security, but pleaded guilty to tax fraud and served nearly four years in prison. He was 
pardoned by President Donald Trump in 2020, after a dramatic fall from grace that followed his heroic actions on 
9/11. The article noted that Director Patel said that Kerik's death on Thursday came after an unspecified "private 
battle with illness!' Additional reporting on the story was provided by WABC (ABC-7) (05/29, Staff Writer), CBS

Continued Reporting: FBI Sounds Alarm on Disturbing Rise in Assassination Threats Against President 
-frump 
Daily Mail (05/29, Potter) and the Washington Times (05/29, Wilson) reported that Director Patel told Fox News' 
Bret Baier that the FBI has seen a rise in threats against President Trump's life after former FBI Director James 
Comey shared a controversial Instagram post with the numbers "86 47". Director Patel said that the post has led to 
numerous "copycat" threats, forcing the bureau to redirect resources away from other important investigations, 
such as child sex predators and fentanyl traffickers. Fox News (05/29, Singman) explained that Comey's post, which 
some interpreted as a threat to Trump, has been described as a "political stunt" that has caused chaos and forced 
the FBI to divert time and resources. The Washington Times (05/29, Picket) added that Director Patel stated in the 
interview that the FBI is preparing to reveal information about the bureau's sources at the Capitol on January 6, 
2021, which he says will "surprise" and "shock" people. The information relates to the presence of confidential 
human sources or informants at the Capitol during the riot, with at least 25 reported to be present. An 
investigation by the Department of Justice Inspector General confirmed that the FBI had more than two dozen 
informants in the area, with some entering the building with protesters, but found no evidence that they were 
authorized to break the law or encourage others to do so.

the article, the FBI has reassigned hundreds of agents to immigration-related duties, potentially hindering national 
security investigations, and is offering incentives such as overtime pay and transfers to agents who participate in
