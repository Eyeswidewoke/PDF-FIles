Ortagus Says Chinese Communist Party Breaks Commitments. 
State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus said on Philadelphia's Morning Answer (10/8), 
"It's really not US versus China. What it's really about is democracy versus authoritarianism. ... 
What we have seen under Chairman Xi...is we have seen them just break all of their promises, 
break all of their commitments. They've broken their promises to Hong Kong, to the people 
there where they're supposed to have autonomy. They've broken their commitments in the 
South China Sea." Asked about the State Department's position on the coronavirus and its 
origins in China, Ortagus said, "The Chinese Communist Party has still not allowed in the 
independent investigators and scientists, doctors, that would need to go in to actually validate. 
... These things matter. Not knowing precisely how this began, where it began, how it was 
unleashed on the world." 
Ortagus Touts Abraham Accords. 
State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus said on Philadelphia's Morning Answer (10/8), 
"Under the leadership of President Trump and Mike Pompeo, we've had a lot of successes, 
especially this year, in foreign policy. ... Remember, it was just less than a month ago...that we 
had the signing of the Abraham Accords at the White House. This is the first Arab-Israeli peace 
deal, peace agreement in 26 years." She said, "Within the span of 29 days, President Trump 
successfully negotiated two peace agreements, and so we're really seeing a...change in the 
Middle East because of four years of policies that we put in place in the region to embolden our 
allies and friends, to embolden Israel, and not to capitulate to our enemy." 
Trudeau Says Canada Paying Close Attention To US Election. 
Politico (10/8, 4.29M) reports Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau "says Canada is paying 
close attention to the US campaign and is prepared for the potential outcomes of the Nov. 3 
vote." During a media briefing on Thursday, Trudeau said, "As we watch the American election 
unfold, we are of course going to be prepared for various eventualities. ... We are certainly 
hopeful that all will proceed smoothly." He "noted the polarization of US politics then shifted to 
emphasize the way federal and provincial leaders in Canada have collaborated during the 
pandemic, working to 'not bring overly political elements into our response." 
Kyrgyzstan President Says He's Prepared To Resign After New Cabinet Approved. 
Reuters (10/8) reports Kyrgyzstan President Sooronbai Jeenbekov "said on Friday he was ready 
to resign once a new cabinet was appointed to end the power vacuum in the Central Asian 
nation gripped by unrest since opposition supporters seized government buildings on Tuesday." 
According to Reuters, while "his offer, made in a statement, could facilitate the transfer of 
power later, it may do little to resolve the political impasse, which prompted regional power 
Russia to describe Kyrgyzstan's situation as chaos." 
Islamic Extremists Free Malian Politician, Three European Hostages. 
The AP (10/8) reports Soumaila Cisse, "a prominent Malian politician," and "three European 
hostages freed by Al Qaida-linked Islamic extremists arrived in Mali's capital late Thursday 
where they were greeted by family members and supporters." French humanitarian Sophie 
Petronin, "who had been abducted four years ago while helping orphans in northern Mali, 
arrived in a flowing white traditional dress." In addition, "while their relatives had been notified 
of their release on Tuesday, news that two Italian hostages also had been freed came only late 
Thursday in a government statement once the flight had left northern Mali."
