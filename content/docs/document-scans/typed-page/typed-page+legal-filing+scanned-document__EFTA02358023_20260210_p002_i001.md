The source of the possible connection between =pstein and I has to do with a girl—K, I will call her. K had a 
=ierce presence, a full, round face and large green eyes, and, for =easons I do not understand, she could not resist the 
call of the =rotic, and surrendered to it with complete abandon whenever it arose, =s if salvation could be found there. I 
was alarmed at that time by how =ar K was willing to go without restraint or thought of =onsequence—without any 
thought at all, actually—but I =as also ready to walk through walls to be with her that way. Entering =er apartment 
building under the gaze of the impassive doormen my =eart would thump so hard I was sure it was audible. Crossing 
that =ausoleum-like lobby to the elevators I became fully transparent, deep =n the trance of the instinctive. That we 
were young was a part of =t—we were being called upon to actualize the instinctual =apacities of the body all over again 
on behalf of the species. Cultural =orces were at work too—this was the mid-1970s, a time still =nfused with the 
transgressive imperatives of the 1960s, despite the =act that the party had already moved on. It was not clear at the 
time, =ut in the back rooms of Max's Kansas City and at concert halls =round downtown NYC we were chasing ghosts—
the action was =hifting back in the direction of wealth, privilege, the boredom of =ixed, extractive hierarchies. Also 
unknown to me, or to anyone else at =hat time, is that a man teaching mathematics at K's expensive =rivate school 
would soon shift to a career on Wall Street, and would =hen quickly blossom into the billionaire investor, science 
=hilanthropist and devotee of sex with underage girls known to many =oday as Jeffrey Epstein. 
Various =hinkers I've written about here have linked the idea of =imeless truth to the birth of metal coinage 
(David Graeber is especially good about this). =oinage gave people a direct experience of transcendent value—how the 
value of a cow =r a goat or a sharp axe could be quantified in an abstract =ealm above the fixed, localized world and =ts 
situated set of particular relations. The abstract aspect of =onetary values pointed in the direction of timeless truths—
truths=that were not just true today, but true everywhere and always. =nspiring mathematicians and philosophers first, 
these ideas began to =xert a broad popular allure. The source for this allure is quite =bvious: if all things are time-bound 
that means we all must one day =ie, and we do not like the idea of dying one bit. And so, before long, =his idea of a 
realm of timeless, transcendent value morphed in the =opular imagination into an actual place we =ould access after 
dying, provided we have =een good boys and girls—heaven, in other words, the seat of =ngels and of the good father 
with the long white beard. Such ideas also =nspired the invention of material objects—machines and =ontraptions—
designed to forever deliver identical results. We become affectively invested in the =eliable certainty of the light switch 
on the wall doing its thing to =he dark room, to the comforting cause-and-effect linearity of the phone =umber on speed 
dial connecting us with dad on father's day, and =o the quadratic equations that generate reliable, consistent =esults—
these small certainties whisper to us in the voice of =mmortality. 
With K there was no issue of fidelity, nor any pretense of a =table arrangement. I never knew at all where I 
stood. How could one =now? There was little talk, just a semi-mute signaling through the =lames. When the right 
conditions presented themselves, our engagement =ould unfold, and this went on for several years before ending 
without =efinite closure. What haunts me most of all is the notion that they =ust have connected, these two beings, 
Epstein and K, despite the age =ifference (or, indeed, because of it), =hich nobody paid much attention to back then. I 
have no proof at all =ut it seems unlikely to me that a man so interested in sex with girls =ould not have noticed K; and it 
seems unlikely too that K would have =een anything but intrigued by such interest. 
Among those who =tudy science and technology it is generally accepted that science is =ever about truth so 
much as it is about who has the resources to =nforce certain perspectives. Since Isaac Newton first served as the 
=xchequer of England modern physics has been closely allied with money, =nd the reason for this has to do with a desire 
for control that hinges =n issues of causality and the temporal. Newton's remarkable =iscovery of laws governing the 
interactions of matter and energy =ere time reversible, for example—they =ould operate just as well describing events 
moving backwards in time. =n the "clockwork universe" Newton described one could =spire to a kind of deterministic 
control over the future, and that, of =ourse, was perceived to be very good news. If the radical developments =shered in 
by Einstein and Heisenberg in the twentieth century =hallenged this dream of control on one level—with our limited 
=erspectives there is only so much we were capable of understanding =bout the very large and the very small—relativity 
and quantum =echanics also re-affirmed the primacy of mathematical laws as a perfect =irror of nature. And so it 
remained possible to image the initial =onditions of all matter and energy could be known to some being not as =imited 
as we are, if not God perhaps a super computer. But off in the =orner of the palace of contemporary science lurks the 
equally radical =evelopment of thermodynamics, a bastard stepchild who shadows the =ontemporary scientific mind
