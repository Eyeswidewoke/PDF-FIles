PERSPECTIVE 
MEDICAL FACTS VS. VALUE JUDGMENTS 
treatment but instead reveal trade-
offs, whereby the best choice for 
an individual patient depends on 
her preferences, on how she 
weighs the relative pros and cons 
of her alternatives. 
Yet in one respect, the divided 
opinion was unexpected, because 
I had presented these specialists 
with an estimate of the outcomes 
my wife faced when she received 
radiation treatment for breast 
cancer. The first set of outcomes 
captured her prognosis if she 
were to receive 5 weeks of whole-
breast radiation. The second cap-
tured the impact of receiving 
boost therapy. Half the audience 
had rejected the "recommended" 
therapy. The NCCN, in crafting its 
treatment guidelines, had stepped 
beyond assessing medical facts 
to making a questionable value 
judgment, that the positive effect 
boost therapy has on local recur-
rence outweighs its negative ef-
fect on breast fibrosis. 
This distinction between facts 
and value judgments has long 
been emphasized by experts on 
decision making, and not just in 
the medical domain. In the mid-
1970s, amid substantial public 
debate about the proper role of 
scientific advisors in the govern-
ment, Kenneth Hammond and 
Leonard Adelman wrote an arti-
cle explaining that the integration 
of facts and values cannot be ac-
complished using science alone 
but also requires value judgments.' 
They described a 1974 contro-
versy that was mishandled in part 
because the community turned a 
problem over to scientists with-
out recognizing that there was 
no purely scientific answer to the 
question at hand. The Denver 
Police Department had begun us-
ing hollow-point bullets, because 
of their superior stopping power. 
The American Civil Liberties Union 
challenged this decision, contend-
ing that the greater lethality of 
the bullets would result in greater 
harm to innocent bystanders. 
Ballistic experts were asked to 
provide their scientific opinion 
about which bullet was "best." If 
the new bullets had been both 
safer and more effective than the 
old ones, scientists could have 
answered this question by point-
ing out those facts. But the new 
bullets presented a trade-off be-
tween lethality for criminals and 
safety for the public. Science on 
its own cannot determine which 
is the right choice in such circum-
stances. That choice depended on 
the relative importance the com-
munity placed on the two goals. 
Ballistics experts were in no better 
position than laypeople to make 
this judgment. 
Like ballistics experts, physi-
cians hold mastery over scientific 
facts that are relevant to impor-
tant decisions and often assume 
the role of advisors to laypeople 
facing difficult choices. In this 
advisory capacity, physicians must 
recognize that their medical rec-
ommendations sometimes involve 
value judgments and that reason-
able people may disagree on the 
best course of therapy. 
The American Urological As-
sociation recognized this distinc-
tion in its guidelines for treat-
ment of early-stage prostate cancer 
and wrote that patient preferences 
"should be considered in decision-
making."' By contrast. NCCN 
guidelines do not include active 
surveillance as an available treat-
ment Sr men with tumors with 
a Gleason score of 7 (the thresh-
old for a high-grade tumor) who 
have a life expectancy of more 
than 10 years' This guideline ef-
fectively treats patients' prefer-
ences as irrelevant to treatment 
choices for men with such tumors. 
In the process, it ignores the 
possibility that a 62-year-old man 
who can't afford to miss work 
might want to pursue active sur-
veillance so he doesn't lose his 
job, or that a newly married 
65-year-old man might not want 
to have erectile dysfunction as a 
result of surgical or radiation 
therapy. Given that such choices 
seem quite reasonable, I believe 
the NCCN overstepped its profes-
sional expertise when it implicit-
ly recommended that physicians 
take this option off the table. 
The same holds true for the 
NCCN guidelines regarding boost 
therapy for women with certain 
types of breast cancer. Physicians 
crafting the guidelines went be-
yond the medical facts and made 
the value judgment that women 
should accept the increased risk 
of breast fibrosis in order to re-
duce their chance of a local re-
currence. 
In some cases, I expect that 
the value judgments physicians 
and professional societies make 
are shared by their patients. But 
sometimes physicians' values dif-
fer in important ways from those 
of many patients. When such 
value judgments are incorporated 
into professional treatment guide-
lines, without any explicit ac-
knowledgment that a reasonable 
patient might choose an alterna-
tive course of treatment, they 
take potential choices away from 
patients. 
Good decision making re-
quires familiarity with decision-
relevant facts and recognition of 
the values relevant to weighing 
the pros and cons of the alterna-
tives. If physicians or medical so-
cieties — in presenting treatment 
alternatives to patients or devel-
