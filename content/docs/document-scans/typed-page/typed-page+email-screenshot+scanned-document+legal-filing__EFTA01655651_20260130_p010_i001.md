the individual or individuals involved. According to department officials, individuals involved in the scam would 
drive from out of state to Tippah County and pick up cash payments from the local resident, under the premise that 
the funds would be invested in Bitcoin.

Continued Reporting: Trump Administration Halts Offensive Cyber Operations Against Russia 
Axios (03/04, Sabin) reported that the U.S. Cyber Command has been ordered to pause planning offensive cyber 
operations against Russia, which could impact the country's ability to respond to cyber threats. According to the 
article, the move is part of President Trump's efforts to reset diplomatic ties with Russia, and has been celebrated 
by the Kremlin, but criticized by cybersecurity experts who warn it could take months to recover from. The article 
noted that the pause in operations could allow Russian cyber operatives to re-wire their networks and disguise 
their activities, making it harder for the US to detect and respond to cyber threats from Russia and other countries. 
The article highlighted that the administration has also reportedly reassigned dozens of FBI officials investigating 
foreign election interference — which Russia has repeatedly been accused of.
