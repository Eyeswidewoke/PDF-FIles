Essays 
unlikely that we will tip the balance of 
the planet so that Earth becomes Venus 
(although we would submerge New 
York and Tokyo). We would adjust. 
Other changes—for example, those 
resulting from all-out nuclear war or a 
large meteor strike—would probably 
give us much less time to adapt, and 
far fewer options. 
How much of a technological insur-
ance policy, and of what nature, should 
we have against events that might fun-
damentally change the habitability of 
earth? There are many possibilities to 
reduce carbon emissions significantly: 
replacing gasoline engines with efficient 
diesels, developing highly efficient fuel 
cells, developing solar and wind power 
optimally. and reintroducing nuclear 
power are four. Industrial solutions to 
pollution would proceed more rapidly if 
there were active investment in "green" 
technologies, and the rate of the invest-
ment is primarily a matter of regulation 
and public policy, albeit complicated by 
the fact that regulations apply locally 
within countries, but the problem is 
global. 
Technical issues are less important 
than political ones in nuclear matters, 
and we have not begun to take the 
problem of a meteor strike seriously. 
9. Nations Are the Most Powerful of 
Human Organizations 
The world is now organized into 
nations—social and political entities 
with defined geographical boundaries. 
Nations made sense in a world in which 
wealth was based on natural resources, 
fertile land, water, and people. Wealthy 
nations were those that could lay claim 
to vast natural resources, and had access 
to trade routes: wealthy nations were 
also those that could afford to wage war. 
It was easy to keep score with 
nations as central political entities. The 
ground has however, shifted. It is more 
important now to be able to control and 
use information than to mine bauxite or 
diamonds. It is more important now to 
have a highly educated population than 
large reserves of coal. The fluidity of 
information, and the difficulty of owning 
and containing it, also opens opportuni-
ties for small groups of people. The 
Internet allows almost any group of 
people access to floods of useful infor-
mation, and at almost no cost. The 
technology of information has redefined 
wealth—from material goods to infor-
mation and services—and thus makes 
the centrality of nations—which control 
physical space but not information 
space—open to question. 
As for war: The cold war was a 
period in which the two most powerful 
nations faced one another in a competi-
tion ostensibly organized along conven-
tional lines: with armies and weapons. 
The armies were never used directly, 
although they were employed in surro-
gate conflicts in Korea. Vietnam. and 
Afghanistan. Ultimately, however, the 
conflict proved to be economic: the US 
won, in significant part because it out-
spent the Soviet Union. 
As information, information sys-
tems, and people become central to 
wealth, large countries (especially those 
housing open societies) become more 
vulnerable to cyber attacks. The US and 
the Soviet Union also had a virtual 
monopoly on strategic nuclear systems 
for many years: they have no cone-
sponding monopoly in terrorist weap-
ons, especially those for biological 
weapons. Joshua Lederberg has said 
"biological weapons enable a single 
man to wage war," and biological and 
cyber attacks—plausibly originating in 
small countries or in nonstate entities 
such as criminal, religious, or ideological 
groups. or even, perhaps. corporations—
now rank with nuclear attacks in the risk 
they hold for society. 
Technology has started a shift away 
from nations as the central political 
entity to supranational entities: alli-
ances, economic regions. multinational 
corporations, capitalist groupings, reli-
gions. It has posed risks to the developed 
countries. which value openness and 
capitalism, and which require relatively 
few barriers to the movement of people. 
information, and goods for efficient 
operation. This openness of western 
societies makes them difficult to defend. 
Developing new technologies to defend 
against these new threats—sensors, 
drugs, and defensive agents for use 
against biological threats; software 
agents and security systems to protect 
computer 
networks—are 
important 
problems and all have central compo-
nents in chemistry.

Deciding how much protection is 
"enough", and how much is "too 
much"—that is. deciding how to value 
security and privacy when the two are in 
conflict—is a broader question for soci-
ety. 
Not Everything is Built on Sand 
Is there nothing that is secure, then? 
The answer is. of course, that we do not 
know, but a number of assumptions 
seem most unlikely to fall. We assume 
that it is impossible to read minds, or to 
teleport physical objects, or to move 
faster than the speed of light in vacuum. 
We assume that time can not be made to 
run in reverse, and that the major laws 
discovered by physical science over the 
last several centuries will continue to be 
true: water at room temperature will not 
spontaneously separate into steam and 
ice; objects will not spontaneously rise 
against gravity; we will not discover a 
source of energy for free. The second 
law of thermodynamics will continue to 
describe the world in which we live. Not 
everything is built on sand. 
Are There Questions We Should 
Not Ask? 
Is "big" 
science—science 
that 
changes the world—good for the world 
it changes? I am constitutionally an 
optimist, and would answer "Usually 
'yes'". We (at least in the developed 
world) live longer than our forebears. 
devote less of our lives to personal 
survival; suffer less from disease; under-
stand the world more fully; have more 
time to spend building society and 
appreciating existence. I believe that 
science has generally worked for the 
common good in the past, and will 
continue to do so in the future. Still. 
science and technology will unlock some 
doors we may not choose to open. 
Science that changes the world in-
evitably brings ethical issues. Building a 
microfluidic system for analysis of the 
human genome may be no more or less 
challenging technically than building a 
better catalyst for the production of 
polyethylene, but it is more important 
for society.
