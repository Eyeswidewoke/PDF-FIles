increased role and status as an offensive weapon against foreign adversaries. Halpern concludes that the 
"Trump Administration, with Bolton in the lead, has made offensive cyber operations an integral arm of 
statecraft. It remains an open question whether they will also become lethal weapons of war." 
Cryptojacking Becoming A Growing Malware Menace. 
SC Magazine (7/18) reports Cryptojacking — cryptomining via malware and other attack vectors - "is a fast-
growing threat not just to owners of individual computers and mobile devices, but also to organizations of all 
types and sizes, putting the security, availability, reliability, and operational costs of their computers and 
networks at risk." Cryptojacking is now another threat category "to add to your IT security team's Fight-Us 
list, alongside a laundry list of threats, including viruses and malware, distributed denial of service (DDoS) 
attacks, phishing, spyware, hackers, rootkits and ransomware." Cryptojacking potentially results "in obtaining 
cryptocurrency without the attacker going through risky intermediary steps such as ransom, blackmail, or 
offering stolen data for sale." Also, the IT resources "being stolen might not yet be on the security team's radar. 
Finally, any cryptocurrency `loot' a surreptitious, illegal cryptomine generates is itself legitimate." An essential 
part of finding and stopping any cyberbreach "is how the company and all of its employees internalize 
security." 
Opinion: Ghost Keys "Solution" To Encryption Is No Solution. 
In an op-ed in Just Security (7/18), Senior Policy Counsel at New America's Open Technology Institute Ross 
Schulman writes that the DOJ and FBI have repeatedly asserted that the extensive use of online 
communications apps "hampers their ability to conduct investigations, because they cannot access encrypted 
communications." Ian Levy and Crispin Robinson from the UK's Government Communications Headquarters 
(GCHQ) "suggest authorizing government officials to force the companies that operate these secure 
communications services to surreptitiously add another party to an encrypted chat and suppress any 
notification to the users about the existence of that party." This method has been "dubbed the `ghost key' or 
`ghost user' solution." Schulman argues that "forcing providers to modify their software to implement a ghost 
key system would seriously damage the overall trust that people have in end-to-end encrypted 
communications." Schulman contends that "no matter how the government sought to implement a ghost 
proposal, it would cause considerable damage to the overall trust of users in the system of software updates." 
Education Department Issued Security Alert That At Least 62 Colleges Impacted By Hacker Attack. 
Politico (7/18, Gaudiano, 4.24M) reports Education Department officials "wrote in a `security alert' that they 
identified 62 colleges or universities that had been `affected' by exploitation of a vulnerability in technology 
products sold by the company Ellucian." The attackers successfully obtained "unauthorized access to colleges' 
admissions or enrollment systems and then created `thousands of fake student accounts,' with at least 600 fake 
accounts generated within a 24-hour period." The vulnerability affects "some of Ellucian's `Banner' products." 
New UK Prime Minister Will Need To Make 5G Decision Quickly. 
Reuters (7/18) reports the new UK prime minister "must take a decision on whether to include China's Huawei 
in Britain's 5G telecoms network urgently as the ongoing debate is damaging international relations, a 
powerful committee of UK lawmakers said on Friday." Dominic Grieve, chairman of parliament's Intelligence 
and Security Committee (ISC), said that "the new prime minister must take a decision as a matter of priority." 
House GOP Campaign Chief Ends Any Chance Of Truce On Using Hacked Material In 2020 Campaigns. 
The Daily Beast (7/18, 1.39M) reports that, during the 2018 election, the House campaign arms of Democrats 
and Republicans "came close to an agreement that neither side would use hacked materials for political 
purposes." The talks fell apart, but any chance "for some sort of truce in the 2020 election effectively ended 
this week." Speaking to a group of reporters at a Christian Science Monitor breakfast, Rep. Tom Emmer (R-
MN) "balked at a question about coming to an agreement with the Democratic Congressional Campaign 
Committee regarding the use of hacked materials this cycle." He said, "The DCCC is not serious about any of 
this stuff. It's all political hackery... Look at what they've been putting out. Look at what the responses have 
been." 
LAW ENFORCEMENT SERVICES 
Four Chicago Cops Fired For Role In Fatal Shooting. 
The Chicago Tribune (7/18, Gorner, 2.65M) reports, "The Chicago Police Board fired a sergeant and three 
officers Thursday night over the alleged cover-up of the murder of Laquan McDonald by a police officer." The 
move "appeared to turn on the infamous police dashboard camera video of the fatal shooting that contradicted 
the officers' police reports." The board "found that the officers exaggerated the threat posed by the 17-year-old 
McDonald in order to justify the actions of Officer Jason Van Dyke in shooting the teen 16 times."
