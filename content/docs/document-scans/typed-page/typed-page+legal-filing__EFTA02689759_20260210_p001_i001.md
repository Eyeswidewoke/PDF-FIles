History of Academic Medicine 
The Vietnam War and Medical Research: 
Untold Legacy of the U.S. Doctor Draft and 
the NIH "Yellow Berets" 
Sandeep Khot, MD, MPH, Buhm Soon Park, PhD, and W.T. Longstreth, Jr, MD, MPH 
Abstract 
Purpose 
From the outbreak of the Korean War in 
1950 through the end of the Vietnam 
War in 1973, many American physicians 
were inducted into military service 
through the Doctor Draft. Some fulfilled 
their obligations by conducting clinical 
research in the National Institutes of 
Health (NIH) Associate Training Program 
(ATP) and later labeled themselves 
"Yellow Berets." The authors examined 
the history of the ATP and its influence 
on NIH associates' future careers. 
Method 
Via interviews with former associates and 
archival research, the authors explored 
the training and collaboration in the ATP 
during 1953-1973. Using databases, 
they compared later academic positions 
of associates with those of nonassociate 
peers who also entered academia and 
identified associates with prestigious 
awards or honorary society 
memberships. 
Results 
The physician-scientists trained in the 
selective ATP were highly qualified 
individuals who received training and 
networking opportunities not available to 
others. They were approximately 1.5 
times as likely as nonassociates to 
become a full professor, twice as likely to 
become chair of a department, and three 
times as likely to become a dean. 
Associates were also more likely to hold 
positions at top-ranked medical schools, 
to fill leadership roles in the NIH, and to 
win prestigious awards and honorary 
society memberships. 
Conclusions 
The cadre of physician-scientists 
trained in the ATP during the Doctor 
Draft rose through the academic ranks 
to leadership roles and continued their 
productive scientific collaborations. 
Their legacy continues to have 
implications for medical research today, 
particularly for training programs in 
clinical research. 
With the outbreak of war in Korea in 
1950, the U.S. Congress approved an 
amendment to the Selective Service Act 
of 1948 to expand the federal 
government's authority to draft 
physicians. This legislation, generally 
known as the Doctor Draft, affected the 
career development of many male 
medical school graduates for more than 
two decades, until the end of the Vietnam

War. The Doctor Draft required all 
physicians and dentists aged 51 and 
younger to register and authorized the 
president to make special "calls" for 
certain medical, dental, and allied health 
specialists. An unexpected consequence 
of the Doctor Draft was the rise of 
physician—scientists in the United States 
as the National Institutes of Health 
(NIH) provided a few thousand talented 
young doctors with the opportunity to 
pursue medical research as a means of 
fulfilling their military obligations and to 
be trained as clinical investigators rather 
than solely as skilled practitioners.' The 
NIH envisioned creating a cadre of 
physician—scientists who would make 
important contributions to fundamental 
medical research and bring new scientific 
discoveries to the bedside.? 
Background 
The NIH Associate Training Program 
(ATP) started in 1953 when several dozen 
hand-picked medical graduates came to 
serve in the newly created NIH Clinical 
Center as clinical associates. The clinical 
associates were selected from physicians 
who applied to serve at least two years in 
the U.S. Public Health Service (PHS) 
Commissioned Corps. These physicians 
were not exempt from the draft; instead, 
once they were drafted by the Army, the 
Navy, or the Air Force, they were 
assigned to the NIH.' Although clinical 
associates' official duty was to provide 
care to patients in the Clinical Center, 
they were allowed to pursue their own 
medical research interests under the 
supervision of NIH intramural scientists.' 
With this novel addition of a substantial 
research component to subspecialty 
training, the NIH soon became the 
premier place to train 
physician—scientists. 
Escalation during the Vietnam War 
Although all doctors were subject to draft 
calls, less than 10% of new medical 
school graduates served in the military 
during the Vietnam War.' Most of those 
drafted served in the reserves or the PHS, 
which included training programs such 
as the ATP. In the late 1960s, however, 
the Defense Department's medical 
workforce needs increased considerably 
as the number of U.S. military personnel 
in Vietnam escalated from 16,000 in 1964 
to more than 543,000 in 1968.5 1n 1967, 
Congress responded by imposing 
restrictions on exemptions available to 
physicians seeking deferments, which led
