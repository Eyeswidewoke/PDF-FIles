World Outlook 2016: Managing with less liquidity 
The goods-services divide suggests the Fed and ECB are misdiagnosing 
underlying inflation: low goods inflation is a global phenomenon that reflects 
the dollar up and commodity down cycles. which are accelerated by monetary 
policy divergence: services inflation is running much stronger and rising. Core 
goods inflation (25% weight in the US; 38% weight in Europe) consistently 
runs well below core services inflation. In the US, core goods inflation has 
been running slightly negative for three years, while core services a much 
stronger 2.5% for the last four years and recently moved to a new cycle high. 
In the Euro area, core goods inflation is running higher than in the US 
reflecting the depreciation of the euro, while core services has been moving up 
and is running at 1.4%. Core goods inflation in the US is strongly correlated 
with import price inflation. Zero or slightly negative core goods inflation in the 
US can also be thought of as foreign inflation less the dollar's appreciation. 
Core services inflation in the US has moved up over the last three months and 
has a fair degree of catch up to do with the decline in unemployment relative 
to the NAIRU and rental vacancies. 
The dollar up cycle should have In'-; to care medium term but -steed bit:takers 
are now in place to slow the pace. The US trade-weighted dollar rose 23% 
during Jun 2014-Mar 2015, the fastest pace ever with about three years of 
appreciation in a typical dollar up cycle packed into nine months. The rapid 
appreciation erected two speed breakers which should slow the pace: lower 
core goods inflation prompted the Fed to push out rate guidance in April 
(marking a top in the dollar for next seven months); the drag on US growth and 
earnings has seen a big reallocation (S-150bn) out of US equities into Europe. 
Historically turns in productivity are led by the dollar. typical lag implies we are 
at the cusp. Historically, over the post-World War II period, productivity has 
grown at a trend rate of 2.1% per year, with long multi-year cycles in the level 
of productivity around this trend. The current level is near the bottom of the 
trend channel, a level last seen in 1995. Incentives matter: the dollar looks to 
have been an important driver of productivity historically. There has been a 
relatively strong correlation between the lagged level of the trade weighted 
dollar and productivity. The average lag looks to have been about three years. 
Cyclical asset allocation: large over.a€location to fixed income at the expense 
of equities persists. Around recessions, flows overweight bonds over equities. 
Asset allocation re-normalizes around Fed hiking cycles. This time various QEs, 
calendar guidance and Twist prompted investors to put even more money into 
bonds long after the recession. Despite equity inflows resuming in 2013 
(especially after the taper) cumulative overweight in bonds is still $748bn and 
underweight in equities $1.4 ten. Each episode of rising rates over the last five 
years saw robust reallocations from bonds to equities. 
The cross asset rates minder 
Rate normalization cycles have long been associated with significant price 
losses on the 10y. Previous rate hiking cycles each saw long-lived capital 
losses on the 10y, averaging -11%. We estimate that a catch back up of 
market expectations to the Fed's guidance is worth +150bps in the l0y 
implying a significant potential re-pricing. The current divergence two years 
ahead is comparable with historical experience near turning points in rate 
cycles.
