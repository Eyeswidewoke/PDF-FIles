The answer to all problems seemed to be more debt. Depressed? Use your credit card for a shopping spree 
"because you're worth it". Want to get rich quick? Work for a private-equity or hedge-fund firm, using borrowed 
money to enhance returns. Looking for faster growth for your company? Borrow money and make an acquisition. 
And if the economy is in recession, let the government go into deficit to bolster spending. When the European 
Union countries met in May to deal with the Greek crisis, they proposed a €750 billion ($900 billion) rescue 
programme largely consisting of even more borrowed money. 
Debt increased at every level, from consumers to companies to banks to whole countries. The effect varied from 
country to country, but a survey by the McKinsey Global Institute found that average total debt (private and 
public sector combined) in ten mature economies rose from 200% of GDP in 1995 to 300% in 2008 (see chart 1 
for a breakdown by country). There were even more startling rises in Iceland and Ireland, where debt-to-GDP 
ratios reached 1,200% and 700% respectively. The burdens proved too much for those two countries, plunging 
them into financial crisis. Such turmoil is a sign that debt is not the instant solution it was made out to be. The 
market cheer that greeted the EU package for Greece lasted just one day before the doubts resurfaced. 
From early 2007 onwards there were signs that economies were reaching the limit of their ability to absorb more 
borrowing. The growth-boosting potential of debt seemed to peter out. According to Leigh Skene of Lombard 
Street Research, each additional dollar of debt was associated with less and less growth (see chart 2). 
Stopping the debt supercycle 
The big question is whether this rapid build-up of debt—a phenomenon which Martin Barnes of the Bank Credit 
Analyst, a research group, has dubbed the "debt supercycle"—has now come to an end. Debt reduction has 
become a hot political issue. Rioters on the streets of Athens have been protesting against the "junta of the 
markets" that is imposing austerity on the Greek economy, and tea-party activists in America, angry about trillion-
dollar deficits and growing government involvement in the economy, have been upsetting the calculations of both 
the Democratic and Republican party leaderships. 
To understand why debt may have become a burden rather than a boon, it is necessary to go back to first 
principles. Why do people, companies and countries borrow? One obvious answer is that it is the only way they 
can maintain their desired level of spending. Another reason is optimism; they believe the return on the borrowed 
money will be greater than the cost of servicing the debt. Crucially, creditors must believe that debtors' incomes 
will rise; otherwise how would they be able to pay the interest and repay the capital? 
But in parts of the rich world such optimism may now be misplaced. With ageing populations and shrinking 
workforces, their economies may grow more slowly than they have done in the past. They may have borrowed 
from the future, using debt to enjoy a standard of living that is unsustainable. Greece provides a stark example. 
Standard & Poor's, a rating agency, estimates that its GDP will not regain its 2008 level until 2017. 
Rising government debt is a Ponzi scheme that requires an ever-growing population to assume the
