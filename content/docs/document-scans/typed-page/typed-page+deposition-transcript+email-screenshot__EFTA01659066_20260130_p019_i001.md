future would support that claim." Reuters says that nonetheless, "in settlement papers, 
prosecutors called some of the money movements `fraudulent transfers:" 
USA Today (10/21, 10.31M) reports that "the settlement is the highest-profile display yet 
of the federal government seeking to hold a major drugmaker responsible for an opioid 
addiction and overdose crisis linked to more than 470,000 deaths in the country since 2000." 
Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen "said that if the resolution wins court approval it `will 
redress past wrongs, and will also provide extraordinary new resources for treatment and care 
of those affected by opioids addiction." However, the agreement was met with "immediate 
resistance from lawmakers and some state officials who believe it did not go far enough to 
address the swath of human destruction caused by the epidemic." 
The Washington Post (10/21, Kornfield, Rowland, Bernstein, Barrett, 14.2M) also reports 
that "state authorities and families who have lost loved ones to their products said the Justice 
Department's terms go easy on the Sacklers." The Post goes on to say, "While numerous other 
lawsuits and court fights over opioids will continue, the Purdue Pharma settlement highlights 
how, for more than two decades, the widespread problem of overprescribing, diverting, and 
abusing pain pills raged across America while drug manufacturers, distributors, pharmacists, 
and doctors profited from the problem and largely deflected responsibility."' 
CNN (10/21, Isidore, 83.16M) reports on its website that the dissolved company's assets 
"will be used to create a new `public benefit company' controlled by a trust or similar entity 
designed for the benefit of the American public. The Justice Department said it will function 
entirely in the public interest rather than to maximize profits. Its future earnings will go to 
paying the fines and penalties, which in turn will be used to combat the opioid crisis." 
Politico (10/21, Luthi, 4.29M) reports that "the resolution with the Trump administration 
also includes a mandate to dissolve Purdue, with the Sacklers relinquishing all ownership and 
control. The company's assets, pending the approval of a bankruptcy court, will be redirected to 
a government-owned `public benefit company' that will still produce OxyContin and opioid 
addiction treatment." Reuters (10/21, Spector) reports, "Sackler family members, in a 
statement, said when they were on the board, `we adopted rigorous policies requiring Purdue to 
be in full compliance with the law,' adding that they relied on management assertions the 
company acted lawfully." The Wall Street Journal (10/21, Al, Randazzo, Subscription 
Publication, 7.57M) also reports. 
Attorney Denies Former Houston Official Was Involved In Kickback Scheme. 
The Houston Chronicle (10/21, Carpenter, 730K) reports, "The $90,000 in cash seized by 
federal agents from former Houston ISD chief operating officer Brian Busby's house earlier this 
year came from gambling winnings, rental income and money used to care for his ailing mother, 
his lawyers said this week." The Chronicle adds, "In their first public comments since agents 
raided Busby's home and district headquarters, lawyers for the former administrator denied 
allegations that the cash was the product of a kickback scheme involving an HISD contractor. 
Federal prosecutors leveled the accusations last month in a civil forfeiture proceeding, but they 
have not filed criminal charges or released extensive details about the case. Lawyer Dick 
DeGuerin, who is representing Busby, said his client has the necessary receipts to prove the 
cash was obtained legally. Federal officials are trying to keep the money agents took from a 
safe in Busby's home while executing a search warrant in late February." 
Former Blue Bell President Charged With Wire Fraud Tied To Listeria Outbreak In 
2015. 
The AP (10/21) reports, "The former president of Blue Bell Creameries has been charged with 
wire fraud for allegedly trying to cover up a 2015 listeria outbreak linked to the company's ice 
cream that killed three people in Kansas and sickened several others, federal prosecutors 
announced Wednesday." A grand jury "returned a seven-count indictment Tuesday charging 
Paul Kruse with six counts of wire fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud,
