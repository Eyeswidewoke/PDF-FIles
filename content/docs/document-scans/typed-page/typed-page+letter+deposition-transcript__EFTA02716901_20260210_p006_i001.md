The Militarization of America's Police Forces 
<=span> 
=n the early 1980s police departments across America began militarizing when under the Reagan Administration we saw 
a mass transfer of military assault rifles, tanks and military gear as a matter of policy under the War On Drugs program. 
U=der both Presidents Reagan and Bush the government gave surplus army gear to domestic police departments under 
the auspices of fighting the War On Drugs provide that they use the equipment a= least once in the first year, which all 
but assured that they did. Th=s was expanded and where we began to see the armed personnel carrier, tanks, 
helicopters and grenade launchers, all =xplicitly designed to be used on a battle field and now being used on the 
American streets across the nation against American citizens. The 1033 P=ogram was so popular with Police 
departments that by 1996 the DOD had given out $330 million in dollars in o=d military gear. Now since our surpluses 
due to the wars in Afghanistan and l=aq, police departments across American have been given $5 billion in army 
gear..C2* On top of this as a result of the build up by Homeland Security after 9/11 the government has given local 
police departme=t an additional $35 billion in surplus military equipment to fight terrorist.=C24, As a result a number of 
police departments have switch to the battle gear uniforms and rhetoric that they are fighting=a war which is two 
fundamentally jobs with politicians believing that these s=ill sets are interchangeable. And while swat teams and their 
tanks are supposed to be used for extreme dangerous situati=ns like hostage takings they are not being use for virtually 
everything, from crowd-control to low level drug raids. 
First of a=l we have to acknowledge that police and soldiers play different roles. A =oldier's role is to fight, repel 
aggression and occupy/control a country through direct violence or the threat of viole=ce, whereas the role of the police 
is to keep the peace. And although the= both carry guns their roles are almost opposite to each other even though they 
both sometime have to us= violence to achieve their separate responsibilities. Additionally a s=ldier's role is to carry out 
orders given to him by his superiors, while one of the main tools of a poli=e officer is his discretion to engage with the 
people in an endeavor to maint=in order and solve criminal activities. So when the police employ soldier-like ways 
discretion goes away and they increasing rely on a zero tolerance application of certain rules and laws, =s well as 
weapons and strategies used in the theater of war, i.e. tasers, guns, assault weapons, p=rsonnel carriers, tanks, 
helicopters, drones and camouflage. I see no tactica= reason for police officers using camouflage, other than to look 
cool and give off an aggressive image which ties into the increasing militarizing mentality. Moreover, when=you start 
dressing for the part it invades your thinking and you begin acting more like a soldier than the police officer that you are. 
As such we have to reverse this trend of militarizing our police departments, even tho=gh many officers and their 
superiors see this uniforms, gear and mindset as th=ngs that provide them safety against the dangers of the job. The
