Face Swap Attacks Surge 300%, FBI Warns 
Forbes (03/03, Winder) reported that face-swapping attacks have surged by 300% over the last 12 months, 
according to the iProov Threat Intelligence Report. According to the article, the use of deepfake technology, 
including face swaps and native virtual camera attacks, poses a significant threat to organizations and individuals, 
as stated by Dr. Andrew Newell, chief scientific officer at iProov. Only 0.1% of consumers can accurately spot a 
deepfake, highlighting the need for alternative means of authentication. The article noted that the FBI has warned 
that phishing should be mitigated with two-factor authentication.

France Mass Rape Case: New Charges Expected as Former Doctor Joel Le Scouarnec Admits Assaulting 
Granddaughter 
CBS News (03/03, Cobbe) reported that there was shock in the courtroom in western France on Friday as farmer 
doctor Joel Le Scouarnec admitted without any solicitation that he had sexually abused his own granddaughter. Le 
Scouarnec, 74, had been on trial for about a week by Friday, accused of raping or sexually assaulting 299 children, 
but his granddaughter is not among the alleged victims in the case — all of whom were his patients at the time. 
The former surgeon stood up and addressed the court just after his eldest son, whose name has not been used in 
the trial, gave evidence. "This is possibly, almost certainly, the last time I will see my son, because I heard his anger 
and his distress," Le Scouarnec told the court in the town of Vannes, Brittany. "I respect that anger, it is well-
founded. Yes, I admit to having abused my granddaughter, his daughter." He then turned to his son and said, 
"forgive me." The trial was adjourned immediately after he made the statement. Later Friday evening, regional 
prosecutors confirmed that new charges would be brought against Le Scouarnec in relation to his courtroom 
confession. The article mentioned that in 2005, he was convicted of possession of child sexual abuse images after 
an FBI investigation into an international network. He was given a four-year suspended sentence for those crimes. 
The court did not order any psychological follow up, however, or any restrictions on his work. During his career, Le 
Scouarnec worked in several hospitals across the Brittany region. Victims' associations have asked how he could 
have carried out so many alleged assaults without any alarms being raised.

FBI Agent Rebuffed On Appeal in Basic Training Overtime Suit 
Bloomberg (03/03, Vilensky) reported that the DOJ prevailed Monday in an FBI agent's lawsuit seeking overtime 
pay for basic training that allegedly took place outside normal work hours. The Federal Circuit vacated a lower 
court finding that a US Office of Personnel Management regulation barring federal workers from earning premium 
pay for entry-level training is invalid. The article mentioned that while the regulations differ from corresponding US 
Department of Labor regulations, those variances may be justified by OPM's need to implement policies specific to 
federal employees, Judge Kimberly A. Moore said. 
FBI Scientist Who Led the COVID Lab Leak Investigation Speaks Out 
The Daily Mail (03/03, Andrews) reported that an FBI scientist who led the investigation into the Covid lab leak 
theory has revealed why he is confident China was behind the pandemic. The FBI, CIA and Energy Department all 
say it is most likely that the virus emerged at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, but only the former says it has 
'moderate confidence' this was the case. According to the article, Dr. Jason Bannan is speaking out to counter the 
claim that the lab leak theory is a right wing conspiracy. The article mentioned that Bannan said his team found Shi 
Zhengli, a lead coronavirus researcher at the WIV dubbed the "bat lady", and her team were performing risky 
experiments on SARS-CoV-2's closest known relatives for at least three years before the pandemic. They also found 
the WIV had "thousands" of samples of coronaviruses, many of which were not disclosed, and that much of the 
research was carried out in labs that had improper safety precautions for coronaviruses, raising the risk of an 
escape. Bannan revealed to Vanity Fair: "To me, there is enough scientific evidence to say it is likely this was a lab 
incident." The article added that Bannan spent more than 20 years as an FBI scientist, winning the FBI Director's 
Award in 2009 for outstanding scientific advancement for his work on the anthrax investigation. He spent 11 of
