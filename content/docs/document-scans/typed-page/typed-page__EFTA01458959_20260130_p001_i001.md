World Outlook 2016: Managing with less liquidity 
The impact of the trade-weighted dollar on inflation is much more benign than 
the impact on growth. According to our FRB/US simulations, the recent dollar 
appreciation would subtract between one- and two-tenths from core PCE 
inflation over the next couple of years. This may not seem like much, but core 
inflation has been running significantly below the Fed's 2% target for the past 
three years. For inflation to rise toward that level, either dollar strength will 
have to reverse, or services prices will have to rise further, thereby offsetting 
the effect of the former on goods prices. Given our expectation of a further 
significant decline in the unemployment rate, services prices. which are 
dominated by the cost of labor and housing rents, should increase further. 
Since services account for roughly two-thirds of the core PCE deflator and 
goods the remaining one-third, acceleration in services prices could offset the 
deflationary impact of the strong dollar on goods prices. Our forecast assumes 
that services inflation will continue to accelerate, thus allowing policymakers 
to proceed with interest rate hikes, but at a very gradual pace relative to prior 
monetary tightening cycles. Inflation is expected to only gradually return to its 
2% target over the next couple of years. 
The estimates of the FRB/US model are broadly consistent with our estimates 
of the impact of the appreciation of the dollar on the contribution of net 
exports in the GDP accounts. Traditionally, changes in the trade-weighted 
dollar tend to impact net exports with a lag of approximately two years. When 
the dollar strengthens, net exports tend to weaken as US export prices become 
less competitive in the global marketplace and imported goods become 
relatively cheaper. In the process, domestic production and employment could 
suffer. 
The manufacturing sector is most acutely impacted by the strength of the 
dollar. However, this weakness is being exacerbated by the excessive 
inventory building in the first three quarters of the year, which has left 
inventories elevated relative to demand. Hence, de-stocking is likely 
contributing to the slowdown in manufacturing output as well. While the 
inventory unwind should prove temporary, the lagged impact from the dollar 
will likely prevent a meaningful recovery in the manufacturing sector, which is 
in contraction territory. It is noteworthy that the manufacturing ISM is highly 
correlated with real GDP growth, even though the manufacturing sector 
accounts for only 12% of total economic output. 
V•iatchino the dot plot. The appreciation of the dollar is a key reason why the 
Fed trimmed its growth and inflation forecasts this year. A stronger dollar has 
the same effect on growth and inflation as monetary tightening. Therefore, 
dollar strength will likely continue to be a meaningful headwind to rate hikes in 
2016 and 2017, and possibly beyond. The Figure 8 below shows the FOMC's 
"dot plot" versus our forecasts and the latest futures market pricing. While the 
fixed income market is nearly fully pricing a December rate hike, financial 
market participants expect a much shallower trajectory for the fed funds rate 
than what the Fed is currently projecting. If the Fed does not reduce its longer-
term forecasts of the fed funds rate, the ongoing divergence between what 
investors are expecting and the Fed is predicting could cause financial market 
turbulence. Our own estimates of the path of interest rates are between those 
of the financial markets and monetary policymakers.
