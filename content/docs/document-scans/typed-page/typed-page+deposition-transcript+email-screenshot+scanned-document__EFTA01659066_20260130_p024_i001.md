McConnell's actions in 2016 "when he refused to consider Supreme Court nominee Merrick 
Garland, the choice of President Barack Obama to fill the vacancy created by the death of 
Justice Antonin Scalia in February." Reuters (10/21) reports Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham 
"has signaled that even with Democrats boycotting he will be able to move the nomination 
forward, according to a panel spokeswoman. The panel's expected approval of Barrett would 
pave the way for a confirmation vote on the Senate floor planned by Republicans for Monday." 
The Washington Times (10/21, Swoyer, 492K), Politico (10/21, Levine, 4.29M), The Hill (10/21, 
Carney, 2.98M), Roll Call (10/21, Ruger, 154K), and Townhall (10/21, Vespa, 177K) also cover 
the planned boycott. 
Asked on WZFG-AM Dilworth, MN (10/21) about any potential delays to the confirmation, 
White House Senior Communications Advisor Ben Williamson said, "We're prepared for 
anything. We know that the Democrats, they've been willing to stoop to very low levels in the 
past and that certainly could be the case this time, but knock on wood, we're on a pace to 
confirm her out of committee this week and then next week in the full Senate on Monday." 
Williamson said on Fox Across America (10/21), "Things look good, she's done a phenomenal 
job. We couldn't be more proud of the President's nominee." 
USA Today: "Rushed" Process "A Slap In The Face To The American People." 
USA Today (10/21, 10.31M) says in an editorial that if Barrett is confirmed, "for the first time in 
more than a century, the majority of the court's nine members will have been selected by 
presidents who reached the Oval Office by losing the popular vote. Also novel is that this 
nomination is being rammed through in the midst of a presidential election, against 230 years 
of precedent. ... This rushed nomination and confirmation process is a slap in the face to the 
American people." 
Barrett Was Trustee At School With Anti-Gay Policies. The AP (10/21, Biesecker) 
reports that Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett "served for nearly three years on the 
board of private Christian schools that effectively barred admission to children of same-sex 
parents and made it plain that openly gay and lesbian teachers weren't welcome in the 
classroom." According to the AP, "the policies that discriminated against LGBTQ people and their 
children were in place for years at Trinity Schools Inc., both before Barrett joined the board in 
2015 and during the time she served." The three schools "are affiliated with People of Praise, an 
insular community rooted in its own interpretation of the Bible, of which Barrett and her 
husband have been longtime members." 
The Minneapolis Star Tribune (10/21, 1.04M) has a feature on People of Praise, writing 
that "national media have seized upon" Barrett's involvement in the group "in her hometown of 
South Bend, Ind. But Minnesota is home to the largest branch of People of Praise in the nation. 
More than 440 of its 1,700 members live in the Twin Cities, a group launched in the 1980s that 
still benefits from its early popularity." 
Trump: Biden "Wants To Pack The Court." President Trump was asked in a town hall 
meeting hosted by Sinclair Broadcasting GroupVI (10/21, 11K) if he expects there to be 
additional Supreme Court vacancies in the next four years. Trump said, "That's one of the 
reasons it's so important to go out and vote, because [Joe Biden) is going to put in radical left 
judges, which will destroy our country. One of the most important things a president does is 
Supreme Court justices, and you can't let that happen. ... And you know he wants to pack the 
court. ... It would be a terrible thing for this country." 
The Washington Free Beacon (10/21, 78K) reports a Opportunity Solutions Project poll 
shows that "59 percent of likely voters oppose court packing, compared with just 26 percent 
who favor it. Support is highest among Democrats at 50 percent. A strong majority of 
independents, 62 percent, oppose court packing, while just 19 percent support it. Those results 
track with figures from other polls that consistently show lopsided opposition to court packing, 
even as interest in judicial reform swells on the left." 
Trump Says There Is "Not Much" He Would Change About His COVID Response.
