Letter to investors 
Investing in binary times 
Nervousness pervades the markets. China's restructuring and the central banks' 
policy dilemmas are unprecedented. But the reality is better than it appears to be. 
Investors should think twice about taking an 
autumn break. After the rather busy months 
of August and September. the traditionally 
turbulent October is unlikely to allow investors 
to catch their breath. Why are markets so 
unsettled? Let me try to explain. 
This bull market has lasted for six and a half 
years. Some have sought and found parallels, 
in terms of technical chart analysis and 
valuations, with the years of 2000 and 2007. 
when stock exchanges 
were also at turning points. 
This naturally raises the 
question of comparability. 
Does history repeat itself, 
or does it only rhyme? 
Maybe what makes those 
three periods comparable 
is that investors each time 
had to face unprecedented, thus incomparable 
situations: In 2000 investors, who had been 
happy to pay triple-digit price-to-earnings ratios 
for internet companies, saw these valuations 
collapse as concerns mounted over the real 
economic merits of this new technology. And 
at the end of 2007, investors were faced with 
the, question whether the most recant driver of 
growth, credit-based consumption, could ever 
take up that role again. Today, the big question 
is whether the Chinese authorities and central 
banks will cope with two major new challenges. 
On the one hand, there is a nation of over one 
billion people which, in current U.S.-dollar 
terms, has more than quadrupled its share in 
the global economy within the last 15 years: but 
which has also rapidly built up debt and now 
seeks to radically change its business model. 
On the other hand, there are the central banks 
which have more than tripled their balance 
sheets since the financial crisis and now have 
to work out how to run them down again. 
Will both China and the world's central banks 
manage to meet their very different objectives? 
Nobody can tell. investors are faced with the 
dilemma of not wanting to miss any buying 
opportunity - and every setback since 2009 
Althou gh 
some clouds may 
linger, the situation 
remains good.

has, in a sense, been one but not wanting 
to be invested either should the subsequent 
market fall really happen. 
Just recently, the Fed dodged the start of its 
very own turnaround once again. Although its 
decision may have been well reasoned, the Fed 
might end up as the driven. not the driver. Also, 
how readily can we really wean ourselves off 
the easy money drug? The Fed postponement 
has at least served to create such negative 
market sentiment that 
higher 
interest 
rates 
might even, for once, be 
welcomed. Wouldn't they? 
Investors are currently 
divided on many things: 
Will developed economies 
drive emerging markets 
or will the latter impede 
the first? Will Western consumers buy 
enough to compensate for globally slack 
levels of investment? Will consumer gains 
from cheaper oil compensate for the energy 
producers' woes? And, finally: is the actual 
situation better than it appears to be? These 
questions were on the agenda of our recent 
quarterly strategy meeting. In our view, the 
global economic recovery is intact, despite a 
more muted outlook for some markets. This is 
likely to open up a number of opportunities, just 
in time for the traditional year-end rally. If, of 
course, history chooses to repeat itself, at least 
in this respect.
