concern that Sarkozy's =eople might be listening to them. "I didn't think they could =ind anything that could stop me," 
he said, and the"they" in =he context of the conversation clearly referred to operatives working =or Sarkozy. The way 
he abruptly ended the encryption, and threw =aution to the wind, reflected his mind set of invulnerability. On =pril 
28th 2011, just two weeks before coming to New York, he had lunch =ith the editors of Liberation in Paris. When they 
asked hm if there =as any way that his political opponents could derail his campaign, he =uipped back that one way 
would be to pay a woman to falsely accuse him =f raping her. Had that response been based on some adumbration he 
=ad that Sarkozy's forces might actually play the sex card to stop =im? He answered me that it was a joke, his gallows 
humor, then, =fter a moment reflection, he added "Perhaps I was politically naive =ut I simply did not believed that they 
would go that far ." 
Joke or not, there is little doubt that the incident at the Sofitel =hat fateful day was real. While it was not a subject he 
wanted to =escribe in detail, b he did not deny that he had a sexual encounter =ith the maid, Nafissatou Diallo. 
According to key swipe records, =he had entered his suite twice— not once-- between 12:06 and 12:07 =m. He said that 
he was just getting out of the shower and rushing to =et ready to meet his daughter for lunch at 12:30 PM. The 
bathroom was =t the end of an interior corridor from his bedroom, quite a distance =nto the suite. He said that when 
he stepped out of the bathroom , =till naked, he was surprised to see a statuesque women in a maid's =niform looking 
directly at him. He said it did not appear she had =ome to clean the suite since he was "certain" that she had no 
=leaning equipment with her. ( She had, she later told prosecutors, =ocked her cleaning cart in Room 2820, which is on 
the other side of =he elevator bank from the presidential suite. ) He said they had a =rief exchange of words and 
gestures. He did not recall the precise =ords but from her gestures, he assumed she was offering a sexual =ervice and 
that what followed, according to his account, was entirely =onsensual. The maid gave a very different version of the 
encounter to =he police: Diallo reported that he brutally sexually attacked her, =ragged her around the room, and 
forced her to perform fellatio twice. =So we have his story and her story. In any case, the encounter ended =bout 7 
minutes later when DSK went to his phone at 12:13 pm to call =is daughter to tell her would be late. 
While DSK's version of encounter may seem bizarre, it was not the =nly time that a sexual liaison had occurred in the 
presidential suite. =When the police lab had examined the carpet in the section of corridor =near the bathroom, and 
found a stain containing his DNA mixed with =er saliva, it also found another other semen stains, including one 
=ontaining a mixture of semen and amylase, an enzyme in saliva, in the =ame area that the maid said she spat out the 
evidence. In that stain, =t identified DNA mixed with the saliva from three different people. =n all, it identified semen or 
saliva mixed with semen from seven =nknown individuals. So there had been considerable previous sexual =ctivity in 
this small area, some of which may have occurred shortly =efore DSK was assigned the VIP suite since the saliva enzyme 
would not =ikely survive multiple room cleanings. Moreover, this night VIP suite =as not always rented. I raised the 
issue of this DNA evidence with =5K, asking him if he had any idea the VIP suite may have been the =enue of other 
sexual liaisons. He replied that he knew nothing about =his activity, and it was only on his arrival that he learned that 
=otel on its own initiative had upgraded him to this $3000 a night =uite (It charged him the rate of $525, the rate for an 
ordinary =oom.) He assumed that the hotel favored him in this way because he =eaded the IMF (which booked the 
room). He further said that he had =ot seen anything out of the ordinary it, other than possibly some =ruit the hotel 
provided, until finding the maid in the bathroom =orridor. 
I asked when he saw the maid for the last time. He said that it was =fter he left the room to check out, which, 
according to the CCTV =ameras, was 12:28 PM. He was just getting into the elevator, towing =is suitcase behind him, 
when he saw her calmly looking at him from the =ther side of the elevator bank, looking towards him. He then got in =he 
elevator. (He arrived in the lobby at 12:27 PM). 
What he =earned afterwards, when the Sofitel's key car records were 
turned =ver to his lawyers, was that just after he got into the elevator, she =e-entered the suite that he had just left. 
I asked him why she =ould revisit the room. Could she be checking to if the departing guest =he suite had left her a 
gratuity. He replied "I left no money." 
He was arrested approximately 4 hours later at JFK airport. He =ad no idea that any complaint had been filed against 
him at the hotel, =e explained. He had himself provided his location when he called the =ofitel to find out if his missing 
Blackberry had been found. The next =ay he had another surprise. He had understood that his lawyers had =orked out 
a bail arrangement with the prosecutor, Cyrus Vance, to =elease him on bond, which is not unusual. But, some four 
hours later, =he deal was abruptly terminated. What had reportedly happened in =he interim was that Vance had 
received information bearing on the case =rom one or more French officials. 
At the bail hearing, the =ssistant DA said 
that unverified "additional information" [was] =eing provided on a daily basis regarding his [DSK's] behavior and 
=ackground." This gave a sinister cast to the case, and the judge =ollowed the prosecution recommendation and denied
