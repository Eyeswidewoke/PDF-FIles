WLS (ABC-7) (06/03, Markoff, Tressel, et al.) reported that Lance Ligocki, dressed in an American flag suit, was 
charged with felonies three years after he attacked police officers with a pole during the January 6 Capitol riot. 
Identified by the FBI through social media, Ligocki became notorious under the hashtag "FullFlagSuit." The article 
noted that he was arrested in March, following a sealed indictment. "He was swinging, according to these 
allegations, swinging a pole at officers and that makes the difference between... a misdemeanor and felony," said 
former Chicago federal prosecutor and ABC7 Chief Legal Analyst Gil Soffer. "I think what sets it apart, at least from 
the least culpable offenders, is that there's violence involved."

actions of the men during the riot.

Republicans Recommend Defunding State and Local Prosecutors Engaged in Politicized 'Lawfare' 
The Washington Times (06/03, Pickett, McPherson) reported that House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan suggested 
prohibiting federal funding for state prosecutors or state attorneys general involved in politicized prosecutions. 
That idea is among several appropriation proposals for fiscal 2025 that Jordan, the Ohio Republican who also leads 
the Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government, included in a letter Monday to Rep. 
Tom Cole, Oklahoma Republican, and Appropriations Committee chairman. The article added that the letter 
recommends that the Appropriations Committee, with appropriate consultation from leadership, include language 
in next year's appropriations to eliminate federal funding for state prosecutors or state attorneys general involved 
in lawfare and to zero out federal funding for federal prosecutors engaged in such abuse. The article noted 
that Senate Majority Whip Richard J. Durbin said a House GOP push to defund prosecutors making cases against 
Trump would only complicate already difficult negotiations to fund the government. The article stated that Jordan 
said in his letter to Mr. Cole that his committee and the select subcommittee have also received testimony about 
"egregious abuses, misallocation of federal law-enforcement resources, and misconduct within the leadership ranks 
of the FBI." Both of his committees, he said, suggested that the Appropriations Committee include language to 
eliminate any funding for the FBI that is "not essential for the agency to execute its mission, including rescinding 
prior appropriations and prohibiting new taxpayer funding for any new FBI headquarters facility." The article 
mentioned that additionally, the panels recommend tying funding for the FBI to specific policy changes, "such as 
requiring the FBI to record interviews, that will promote accountability and transparency at the FBI." According to 
the article, the fiscal 2024 funding package directed $200 million toward building a new FBI headquarters, a plan
