The Washington Post (11/19, Stein, Kim, 14.2M) reports aides to Senate Majority Leader 
McConnell, Senate Minority Leader Schumer, House Speaker Pelosi, and House Minority Leader 
McCarthy "met Thursday in an effort to bridge differences and assemble a spending bill that 
would avert a government shutdown in December." The aides held discussions shortly after 
Chief of Staff Meadows "said he couldn't guarantee a shutdown would be averted." 
Mnuchin Will Not Extend Emergency Lending Programs. 
The Wall Street Journal (11/19, Al, Timiraos, Davidson, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) 
reports Treasury Secretary Mnuchin said Thursday several emergency loan programs 
established with the Federal Reserve will be allowed to expire on Dec. 31. Mnuchin said the 
Fed's corporate credit, municipal lending and Main Street Lending programs will not be 
renewed. Reuters (11/19, Schneider, Saphir) says the lending programs "never got much use, 
but were an effort to spread a central bank safety net under as much of American business as 
possible." The AP (11/19, Crutsinger, Rugaber) reports Mnuchin "said that he is requesting that 
the Fed return to Treasury the unused funds appropriated by Congress for operation of the 
programs. He said this would allow Congress to re-appropriate $455 billion to other coronavirus 
programs." 
The New York Times (11/19, Smialek, 18.61M) says the move could hinder Joe Biden's 
"ability to use the Federal Reserve's vast powers to cushion the economic fallout from the 
virus." The Times says the programs "have provided an important backstop that has calmed 
critical markets since the coronavirus took hold in March. Removing them could leave crucial 
corners of the financial world vulnerable to the type of volatility that cascaded through the 
financial system in March. And by asking the Fed to return unused funds, Mr. Mnuchin could 
prevent Mr. Biden's incoming Treasury secretary from restarting the efforts in 2021." 
The Hill (11/19, Elis, 2.98M) reports Fed Chairman Powell "says the programs...remain 
necessary," and the Washington Post (11/19, Siegel, Stein, 14.2M) that the Fed "immediately 
criticized" the move, "citing the fragile recovery." In a "rare statement," the Fed said, "The 
Federal Reserve would prefer that the full suite of emergency facilities established during the 
coronavirus pandemic continue to serve their important role as a backstop for our still-strained 
and vulnerable economy." The Post says the "exceedingly rare public rebuke" from the central 
bank "reflected a government divided on how to respond, as the pandemic surges across the 
nation, threatening a new wave of shutdowns and marking an inflection point of the recession." 
EPA Administrator's Travel Plans Draw Scrutiny. 
The New York Times (11/19, Friedman, 18.61M) says EPA Administrator Wheeler "plans to 
squeeze in two taxpayer-funded trips abroad - to Taiwan next month and to four Latin 
American countries in January." According to the Times, both trips "have raised concerns about 
the taxpayer expense at a time when Mr. Wheeler no longer represents the direction of E.P.A. 
policy, and he and top aides are supposed to be aiding the transition" to the next 
administration. 
Meadows Suggests Deal Over Military Policy Bill. 
The New York Times (11/19, Haberman, Edmondson, 18.61M) reports Chief of Staff Meadows 
"has privately hinted that President Trump would drop his objection to stripping Confederate 
leaders' names from military bases, which is threatening to derail the annual military policy bill, 
if Democrats agreed to repeal" Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996. House 
Armed Services Chairman Adam Smith has been discussing potential compromises with the 
White House, but the proposed deal is "viewed it as a nonstarter," according to an anonymous 
Democratic congressional aide. 
Democrats, Republicans Seek Infrastructure Deal In Next Congress.
