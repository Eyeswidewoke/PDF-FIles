Ng. 1. The complex system of energy Rows in the United States in 2005 (V. More than half of the energy produced is 
wasted. Units are in quads; 1 quad = 1015 British thermal units = 1.055 exajoules. [Figure prepared by Lawrence 
Livermore National Laboratory, University of California, and the U.S. Department of Energy] 
marvel: It is fairly inefficient thermodynamical-
ly. and several key reactions [for example, the 
key step involving the reaction of CO2 with 
ribulose diphosphate (with its competing reac-
tion with th)) have a surprisingly poor yield. 
These inefficiencies are an opportunity. Photo-
synthesis has immense appeal for the closed. 
cycle capture of energy from the Sun in forms 
that arc useful as fuels (4). Thc prospects of re-
engineering biological photosynthesis for greater 
efficiency, maximizing metabolic flux through 
specific biosynthetic pathways. growing plants 
in regimes of temperature or salinity where they 
normally do not flourish, and directly produc-
ing fuels such as 112, 0114, or alcohols arc all 
alluring ones, but ones that will require decades 
of imaginative research to realize. The prospect 
of non-biological photosynthesis (where 'pho-
tosynthesis" might include No-inspired physical 
and chemical reactions or more straightfonvard 
photochemical or photothennal processes that 
generate fuels or store energy) also warrants 
new research. 
Complex Systems 
Understanding energy and the environment 
analytically poses a series of problems that we 
presently have neither the mathematical tools 
nor the data to solve. Most global systems are 
"complex" in physicists' definition of the word: 
They comprise many components, with many 
degrees of freedom, usually interacting non-
linearly. These systems are the natural home 
of big surprises—often referred to as emergent 
behavior. Our difficulty in understanding and 
modeling these systems leads to uncertainties 
that cloud most discussions of energy and the 
environment and of the costs and impacts of 
almost any technology (5). What really is the 
cost of a kilowatt produced by silicon solar 
cells? Now important will the burning of coal 
be to global warming? What, in &tail, are the 
global sources and sinks for carbon and how 
do they interact? What can one say about the 
impact of technologies for generating nuclear 
power on the potential for proliferation of nu-
clear weapons? Development of the theory of 
complex systems to the point where it gives re-
liable results (or at least results whose reliability 
can be quantified) remains a key enabling ca-
pability, and is probably the best way of min-
imizing the potential miseries of the law of 
unintended consequences. 
The Efficiency of Energy Use 
Increasing the efficiency of energy conversion 
and storage is a major opportunity. Many of 
our standard energy conversion routes are far 
from their Camot efficiency limits: Electric-
ity production with the present mix of fuels 
is only 37% efficient on average, the typical 
automobile engine is perhaps 25% efficient, 
and an incandescent bulb is only 5% efficient 
for producing visible light. Increasing eflici-
ency requires understanding 
the fundamental phenome-
na of existing and alternative 
energy conversions. Solid-
state lighting, for example. 
can achieve efficiencies of 
50% or inure, provided that 
we understand the mecha-
nisms controlling the conva-
sion of electronic energy to 
photons. New understand-
ing of mechanisms of fric-
tion. wear, and corrosion also 
provides new strategies for re-
ducing lasses. 
The Chemistry of Small 
Molecules 
Thc chemistry of small mol-
ecules dominates many as-
pects of energy and climate: 
112O, 112, O2. CO2. CO (for 
Fischer-Tropsch chemistry). 
NO,. O3. NH,.. SO2. O14. 
ClItOll, NCI, and others arc 
all vitally important corn-
Fitments of these dens:ions. 
T ere remains a wide range 
of inlimnation about these 
molecules and their combi-
nations that is needed to un-
derstand the complex systems of which they 
are a part. 
New Ideas: Separating Wheat from Chaff 
The spectum of ideas for dealing with prob-
lems of energy and global stewardship is not 
complete. based just on what we now know. 
We need new ideas, and we need to know 
which of the current smorgasbord of unex-
plored and unproved ideas will work (9). 
Developing affordable technologies for remov-
ing carbon from the atmosphere (for example. 
by growing biomass and converting it to a stable 
form of carbon) must be explored now, if they 
are to be options in the future. Changing the 
albedo of Earth, stimulating photosynthesis in 
the oceans by the addition of essential trace ek-
malts such as iron, developing new nuclear 
power cycles, a hydrogen economy, new meth-
orb for separating gases (such as CO2 from air) 
and liquids, mom-temperature superconductivity 
to carry electric power without loss biological
biological 
II, production, new concepts in batteries, and 
nuclear fusion all must be explored fundamen-
tally and realistically. 
These problems all require long-tens, patient 
investment in fundamental research to yield new 
and validated ideas. These problems arc also. 
in some cases, sufficiently technical that their 
importance is most obvious to specialists. The 
oxygen electrode (as one example) might seem 
an exotic problem in science, but it is hard to
