=div> the facts as i see them 
in June and then again =ept, we both agreed to a 50% of phaidon payout., then =AO after weeks of thinking about the 
issue ( which I fully understan= ) . the payout was unilaterally changed . 5m woudl be reserve= for the future ? . and out 
of the remaining 15m ,? i would receive =nly 5. ( note : I'm confident that both the debt , and the=artspace<=span> 
investment will also lead to a write off of another 30=C2 m. plus ) In my dining room ,you were surprised when I s=id 
that i require most people to pay their advisory fee up fro=t so that I am assured that I will be properly compensated 
for=my work when strategies that I devise are implemented . you may reca=l that you appeared offended and said " 
are =ou suggesting that i would go back on my word " I said no , of =ourse not ! you are my closest of friends ,but my 
experience is that=C2 when amounts get large, people tend to get unhappy when it actually =omes time for them to 
Pay 
From day zero a 50 - 60 millio= price was attached as the fair price of the transaction just comple=ed . though this 
amount was already substantially=C2 less thanour agreed and negotiated formula. - I was nev=r told that this was 
out of range. in fact, =lternative methods of payment . plane -in-kind etc, were discussed=C2 ( ie keeping the 30m 
portion of fee outstanding till Mar=h ) ,I provided as requested a detailed step by step ex=cution plan and reviewed 
all documents that i was given access to. (=Phaidon was not forthcoming ) in order to make my many =orrections . I 
was then told that Alans involvement=C2 warranted a discount . Even in the best of light ,=though it is beyond 
question that not one-,not -one time in t=ree years has he ever proposed a unique idea. (including =he new tenant 
in common idea,) and lets say he made a co=tribution to the plan andeven that it was 50 %. though no one could =osit 
such a large amount unless they were wearing a brightly colored=clown suit. , the price of doing the deal was known . 
It=had both sent in writing and spoken about on the phone numerou= times, a detailed execution plan was provided 
. then =nd only then after all was laid out for the group I was told that af=er a number of conversations with brad karp 
that only 20m =ould be paid , (and even that was more than originally contemplated ) for =oth transactions . I feel It 
was remarkably unfair. =AO Did brad even know of our prior agreement.? I called =im and he said he was never told.?, 
I would ask that you I and Brad karp sit together if you think it would be helpful. . I would like to s=nd him this email, 
with your consent of course. If the transa=tions were never consummated , i would not be owed a dime, however 
,=the price was known up front. , the detailed step by step plan was f=llowed and overseen by me, the price that had 
been requested before the tr=nsaction was begun, and had (ready heavily discounted, out of friend=hip, from our 
agreement . I believe the decision re paying only 20 m=C2 has frankly left me felling quite uneasy. 
=br>
