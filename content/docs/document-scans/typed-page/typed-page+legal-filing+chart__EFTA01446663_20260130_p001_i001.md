FX Blueprint: Thin end of the wedge 
Theme #8: Balti not faulty, China yet finer 
2013 saw Asian FX fracture into a North and South 
complex. Relative sensitivity to the yen, the EM debt 
bubble, and the developed world equity/growth cycle 
all served to discriminate the two intra-regional groups 
at different points during the year. Ultimately, the North 
emerged fairly unscathed, while the South cheapened 
significantly. Indeed, much of South Asia FX still faces 
a host of challenges from political instability (THB), 
offshore debt holding overhang and weak commodity 
prices (MYR, IDR). However we refrain here from 
adding to shorts against most of this group, given a 
mix of large valuation adjustments, expensive carry, 
and/or improving policy responses that is shifting the 
risk-reward. We concentrate instead on currencies like 
INR where fundamentals have improved sufficiently to 
go long, and on SGD, where persistent overvaluation 
and exposure to a broadening in USD strength out to 
low-yielders favors a short bias. In North Asia, we stay 
short USD/CNH, but are mindful of the large build up in 
positioning. We favor a short JPY/KRW position to 
express our positive view on Korean fundamentals. 
The rupee has had a makeover 
After spending three years as one of the world's worst 
performing currencies, the rupee should fare better in 
2014 for three main reasons. First, India has seen large 
improvement in her external balances. The trade deficit, 
which is the only driver of the CAD, has almost halved 
from its peak. While gold import compression has 
driven most of the trade improvement and could face 
slippage, exports and services have also been bright 
spots. 
Second, 
even as India's portfolio flow 
dependence is falling, both debt and equity flows could 
see positive swings. After aggressive debt outflows 
between May-Nov 2013, offshore holdings have fallen 
to "core" levels; indeed, foreigners returned as buyers 
in December. With large unallocated limits, a more 
positive duration view, and the possibility of index 
inclusion and/or Euroclearability, India could attract 
money. The key swing factor for equities will be 
general elections in May. To be sure, this is a binary 
event; but hopes of a pro-growth stable coalition could 
boost inflows in the run-up to elections. Third, RBI's 
swap activities have been a success adding to reserves. 
Concerns about oil USD demand appear exaggerated, 
and its return to the market in November did not raise 
volatility. Majority of their obligations to buy USD 
ahead of imminent swap repayments have been met. 
We are long a 6M USD/INR 62 put with an RKO at 57. 
WO no longer ling 
We have seen a long USD/SGD view as a good 'long-
haul' trade to play for USD strength and US yield re-
pricing. However, the lesson from 2013 was that 
USD/SGD took its cues more from the USD/G10 1VVI 
than its USD/Asia peers which often behaved 
Indian exports have been a bright spot in Asia
