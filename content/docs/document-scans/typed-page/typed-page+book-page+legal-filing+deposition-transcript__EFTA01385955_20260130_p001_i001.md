dynamics, as investors and dealers reduce risk. More crucially it is likely to be 
related to the increased supply of duration from peripheral issuers. We had 
highlighted over the last few weeks that peripheral countries were likely to 
increase the duration of their new issuance to raise the average maturity of 
their outstanding debt back to pre-crisis levels. We expected the increase in 
duration to be a headwind to the spread tightening trend, but not to lead to a 
spread widening. On closer inspection, the duration supply could actually be 
quite meaningful. Indeed, Spain and Italy have increased the maturity of their 
issuance in 2015 by 2.5-3.0 years relative to 2014. If this increase in maturity is 
maintained for the duration of the QE programme, Spain and Italy would be 
issuing significant additional duration to the market relative to last year (see 
the table below and Euroland Strategy for more details). In fact, for Italy, the 
duration supply could be comparable to the duration taken out by the ECB. Of 
course, some maturity extension was likely to have been expected and already 
priced in by the market. Also, the maturity increase from Italy and Spain may 
be particularly high at the moment and may decelerate. Nonetheless, this 
simple calculation suggests that the magnitude of the duration supply could be 
material.

For core countries, there has been no supply response so far. Germany is 
unlikely to adapt its issuance to market conditions. However, France could 
prove to be more opportunistic. Net selling could come from non-domestic 
investors as these are the ones who have increased their ownership of core 
ates during the crisis. As we discussed last week, there are fewer incentives 
for Japanese investors to hold EGBs at these relative yield levels. For instance, 
he France-Japan 10Y spread has tightened from over 200bp in 2011 to less 
han 15bp today. Japanese investors may thus reduce their current holdings 
(which consists mostly of France) once the new fiscal year starts next week.
