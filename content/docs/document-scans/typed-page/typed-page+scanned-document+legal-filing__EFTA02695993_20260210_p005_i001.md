Recordings of 3 complete songs and part of a 4th were pre-
sented in the 10-minute music stimulation window: (I) "Row 
Row Row Your Boat" (duration = 3 minutes, 9 seconds), (2) 
"Baa Baa Black Sheep" (3:00), (3) "Are You Sleeping" 
(2:23). and (4) the first 1:28 of "Rock a Bye Baby" (original 
song length of 3:06). Each song began with a short instrumental 
introduction (range = 6-26 seconds) followed by a sung mel-
ody whose pitches ranged from E3 to C59 on the equal-
tempered scale (fundamental frequencies = 164.8-554.4)Iz, 
A4 = 440 Hz) and a moderate tempo of 84 to 88 beats per min-
ute in 4/4 or 3/4 meter. Each recording contained only 3 to 
4 instrumental voices with timbres varying among electric 
piano, electric organ, glockenspiel, and synthetic sounds. We 
chose traditional Western lullabies sung in English by a female 
because we thought they would have the highest probability of 
achieving a beneficial effect for our Western, English-speaking 
population, and because a female voice (ie, mother's voice) is 
the one most frequently heard prenatally in the womb. More-
over, lullabies include both music and speech sounds, have 
cross-cultural significance in parent-infant communication, 
and have been shown to improve longer-term endpoints, such 
as weight gain in hospitalized infants.65
Each CD track was converted to a monophonic mp3 file 
and uploaded onto an Apple iPod. Stimuli were presented at 
an intensity of approximately 70 dBA using one JBL Duet 
speaker placed in the sagittal midline at the foot of the infant's 
isolette, approximately 50 cm from her/his head, outside the 
field of the heel-stick procedure. The advantages of using a sin-
gle speaker playing a monophonic recording (less space, fewer 
wires) outweighed the advantages of using 2 speakers playing a 
stereo recording, in our opinion, because we did not hypothe-
size that this difference in the spatial mix of the music would 
influence the results. The iPod was placed on a small dock at 
the bedside. 
Physiological Responses 
For each infant, HR, respiratory rate (RR), and O2-sat were 
continuously monitored before, during, and after the heel-
stick procedure using a GE Medical Clinical Information 
Center Pro system. During 1 to 2 minutes before the heel-
stick procedure, throughout the procedure. and during the first 
4 minutes postprocedure, a trained observer (ML or CV) 
recorded at least 4 measurements of each of the 3 dependent 
variables per minute. At the beginning of the study, data were 
recorded every IS seconds online in real time by reading the 
output of the HR, RR, and Orsat monitors. About halfway 
through the study, we were able to analyze the output of the 
monitors offline, which recorded data every 2 seconds, after 
data collection was finished. Finally, during the last half of the 
post heel stick epoch, data were sampled at 3 points: 5, 7, and 
10 minutes postprocedure. For the purpose of population data 
analyses, data collected preprocedure, during the procedure, 
and ≤4 minutes postprocedure were calculated using a bin 
width of 15 seconds. We checked that there were no significant 
differences between the means calculated from 15 seconds 
sample points and 2 seconds sample points for each dependent 
variable. 
Behavioral Responses 
Behavioral responses were recorded before, during, and after 
the heel-stick procedure with a Samsung SCD-23 digital video 
camera. At the start of the procedure, the camera was mounted 
on a tripod at the foot of the isolette; after the nurse completed 
the heel-stick procedure, the camera was moved closer to the 
infant alongside of the isolette. Digital videos were converted 
to QuickTime movie files for offline analysis. We initially 
aimed to code whether or not each of the following behaviors 
occurred before, during, and after the heel-stick procedure: 
(I) eye-opening, (2) head movements, and (3) crying. How-
ever, we were unable to reliably code eye-opening and head 
movements. Behavioral data could not be collected during 
blood collection for 3 babies because the nurse blocked the 
camera's view; in general, reswaddling of infants following 
heel stick compromised the observations of changes in beha-
vior. Behavioral data from one infant was lost due to equipment 
malfunction. 
Experimental Procedure 
Figure I depicts the timeline of the heel-stick procedure, audi-
tory stimulation (for the treatment group), and data collection. 
The heel-stick procedure was performed by Registered Nurses 
caring for the SCU patients. Stimuli were presented and data 
collected by I of the 2 investigators (ML or CV). who were 
trained in experimental psychology, acoustic calibration, and 
music. 
First, with the infant at rest, undisturbed in her/his isolette, 
we recorded baseline HR, RR, and O2-sat data and started the 
video. Second, during the prepuncturc handling period, a nurse 
prepared the infant's heel with a warm pad followed by an alco-
hol swab. There were differences among nurses with respect to 
preparation routine and pre and post heel-stick swaddling. In 
all. 2 infants in the control group and 2 in the treatment group 
were swaddled at baseline and remained so throughout the 
heel-stick procedure and recovery period. One infant in the 
control group and 2 in the treatment group were not swaddled 
at baseline and remained unswaddled throughout the heel-stick 
procedure and recovery period. One infant in the Control 
Group was swaddled at baseline, unswaddled during handling 
and blood collection, and remained unswaddled during the 
recovery period. One infant in the control group was not 
swaddled at baseline, remained unswaddled during handling 
and blood collection, and then swaddled during postpuncture 
handling and the recovery period. A total of 3 infants in the 
treatment group were swaddled at baseline, unswaddled during 
handling and blood collection, and reswaddled during post-
puncture handling and the recovery period. Four infants in the 
control group and 4 in the treatment group were given a pacifier 
during prepuncturc handling; 2 of the pacifiers given to the 
control group and all 4 given to the treatment were sweetened
