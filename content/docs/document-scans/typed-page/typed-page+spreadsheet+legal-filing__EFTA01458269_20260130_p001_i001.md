Corporate Credit: Back to school - The edge of normality 
Back to school - The edge of normality 
What a summer we've had. Greece has slipped back into the shadows but was 
at the centre of global financial markets as the market entered holiday season. 
As we return, China, commodity and EM woes dominate. If that's not enough, 
in two weeks the Fed will embark on one of their most eagerly anticipated 
policy meetings over the last decade. In this note we update our views on 
credit markets and take stock after the holiday season as we go 'back to 
school'. 
One of the biggest problems we face is that there is no historical template for 
current global market conditions so we're all flying blind to a large degree. 
Never before have so many of the most important countries in the world 
printed so much money and left base rates so low for so long. Also never 
before has the most economically influential country in the world (the US of 
course) tried to start a slow process of reversing said extraordinary policy. 
We've also not seen a country as big as China see such rapid growth over such 
a short space of time la few decades) without major busts along the way, 
especially when credit growth has been so extraordinary. So there is no road 
map for this journey, only educated (hopefully) predictions. 
We've continued to be bullish European credit (especially HY) even though 
we've long felt that the only thing preventing another financial crisis has been 
extraordinary central bank liquidity and general interventions from the global 
authorities. Although we probably should have lightened up on occasions this 
year, Figure 2 shows that HY total returns have been decent and excess returns 
positive in 2015 which is impressive given the volatility. EUR IG has seen a 
mild negative total return year, while GBP IG has been slightly positive. Both 
markets have provided negative excess returns given the small positive total 
return in Bunds and Gilts, but the under-performance has been relatively mild 
and the out-performance strong relative to the USD market. These are shown 
for the three currencies in Figure 3.

Our view overall is that the global financial system is so fragile, the global 
economy so lethargic and asset prices generally so high (with exceptions) that 
it near forces central banks into a continuation of easy monetary conditions. 
Perhaps even easier over the coming months and years than they currently 
expect. This fits in with our 'Plate Spinning' analogy that central banks are 
periodically required to rush to re-spin the plates to prevent them crashing 
down given the problems beneath the surface that liquidity is covering up. We 
think this era will last for a number of years to come. 
So we expect central bank liquidity to remain abundant and credit 
fundamentals outside of the Commodity sector (mostly a US problem which 
we expand on in this note) to remain fairly stable. Meanwhile spreads across
