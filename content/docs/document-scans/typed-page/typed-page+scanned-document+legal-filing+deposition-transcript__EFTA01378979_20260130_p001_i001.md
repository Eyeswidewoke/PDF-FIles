Selected Risk Considerations 
An investment in the securities involves significant risks. Investing in the securities is not equivalent to investing directly in the 
Underlyings. These risks are explained in more detail in the "Risk Factors" section of any accompanying product supplement. 
• 
YOU MAY RECEIVE LESS THAN THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT AT MATURITY— If the securities are not redeemed prior 
to the Maturity Date, you may receive less at maturity than you originally invested in the securities, or you may receive 
nothing, excluding contingent coupons, if any. If a Knock-In Event has occurred, you will be fully exposed to any 
depreciation in the Lowest Performing Underlying. In this case, the Redemption Amount you will receive will be less than 
the principal amount of the securities, and you could lose your entire investment. It is not possible to predict whether a 
Knock-In Event will occur, and in the event that there is a Knock-In Event, by how much the level of the Lowest Performing 
Underlying has decreased from its Initial Level to its Final Level. Any payment on the securities is subject to our ability to 
pay our obligations as they become due. 
• 
REGARDLESS OF THE AMOUNT OF ANY PAYMENT YOU RECEIVE ON THE SECURITIES, YOUR ACTUAL YIELD 
MAY BE DIFFERENT IN REAL VALUE TERMS— Inflation may cause the real value of any payment you receive on the 
securities to be less at maturity than it is at the time you invest. An investment in the securities also represents a forgone 
opportunity to invest in an alternative asset that generates a higher real return. You should carefully consider whether an 
investment that may result in a return that is lower than the return on alternative investments is appropriate for you. 
• 
THE SECURITIES DO NOT PROVIDE FOR REGULAR FIXED INTEREST PAYMENTS— Unlike conventional debt 
securities, the securities do not provide for regular fixed interest payments. The number of contingent coupons you receive 
over the term of the securities, if any, will depend on the performance of the Underlyings during the term of the securities 
and the number of Coupon Barrier Events that occur. If a Coupon Barrier Event has occurred during any Observation 
Period, you will not receive a contingent coupon on the Contingent Coupon Payment Date immediately following such 
Observation Period. Accordingly, if a Coupon Barrier Event occurs during every Observation Period, you will not receive 
any contingent coupons during the term of the securities. Thus, the securities are not a suitable investment for investors 
who require regular fixed income payments, since the number of contingent coupons is variable and may be zero. 
In addition, if rates generally increase over the term of the securities, it is more likely that the contingent coupon, if any, 
could be less than the yield one might receive based on market rates at that time. This would have the further effect of 
decreasing the value of your securities both nominally in terms of below-market coupons and in real value terms. 
Furthermore, it is possible that you will not receive some or all of the contingent coupons over the term of the securities, 
and still lose your principal amount. Even if you do receive some or all of your principal amount at maturity, you will not be 
compensated for the time value of money. These securities are not short-term investments, so you should carefully 
consider these risks before investing. 
• 
MORE FAVORABLE TERMS TO YOU ARE GENERALLY ASSOCIATED WITH AN UNDERLYING WITH GREATER 
EXPECTED VOLATILITY AND THEREFORE CAN INDICATE A GREATER RISK OF LOSS—"Volatility- refers to the 
frequency and magnitude of changes in the level of an Underlying. The greater the expected volatility with respect to an 
Underlying on the Trade Date, the higher the expectation as of the Trade Date that the closing level of such Underlying 
could be less than its (i) Coupon Barrier Level on any trading day during an Observation Period or a) Knock-In Level on 
the Valuation Date, indicating a higher expected risk of loss on the securities. This greater expected risk will generally be 
reflected in a higher contingent coupon than the yield payable on our conventional debt securities with a similar maturity, 
or in more favorable terms (such as lower Coupon Barrier Levels or Knock-In Levels) than for similar securities linked to 
the performance of an underlying with a lower expected volatility as of the Trade Date. You should therefore understand 
that a relatively higher contingent coupon may indicate an increased risk of loss. Further, relatively lower Coupon Barrier 
Levels or Knock-In Levels may not necessarily indicate that you will receive a contingent coupon on any Contingent 
Coupon Payment Date or that the securities have a greater likelihood of a return of principal at maturity. The volatility of 
any Underlying can change significantly over the term of the securities. The levels of the Underlyings for your securities 
could fall sharply, which could result in a significant loss of principal. You should be willing to accept the downside market 
risk of the Underlyings and the potential to lose a significant amount of your principal at maturity. 
• 
AT MATURITY OR UPON EARLY REDEMPTION, THE SECURITIES WILL NOT PAY MORE THAN THE PRINCIPAL 
AMOUNT PLUS THE FINAL CONTINGENT COUPON, IF ANY— At maturity or upon Early Redemption, the securities 
will not pay more than the principal amount plus the final contingent coupon, if any, regardless of the performance of any 
Underlying. Even if the Final Level of each Underlying is greater than its respective Initial Level, you will not participate in 
the appreciation of any Underlying. The maximum amount payable with respect to the securities (excluding contingent 
coupons, if any) is $1,000 for each $1,000 principal amount of the securities. 
• 
THE SECURITIES ARE SUBJECT TO THE CREDIT RISK OF CREDIT SUISSE — Investors are dependent on our ability 
to pay all amounts due on the securities and, therefore, if we were to default on our obligations, you may not receive any 
amounts owed to you under the securities. In addition, any decline in our credit ratings, any adverse changes in the 
market's view of our creditworthiness or any increase in our credit spreads is likely to adversely affect the value of the 
securities prior to maturity.
