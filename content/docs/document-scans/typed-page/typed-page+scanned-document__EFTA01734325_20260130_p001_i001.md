JVP 
MEDIA QUARTER 
JVP Overview 
Jerusalem Venture Partners ("JVP") is a leading Israeli venture capital firm dedicated to building world class 
media technology companies. Established in 1993 by JVP's founder and managing partner, Erel Margalit, JVP 
now has over $900 million under management. With its eighteen year track record in Israel and international 
markets, JVP is well positioned to source Israel's best early-stage media technology deals, creating joint 
ventures with international media leaders to extend their digital media initiatives, as well as embark upon 
consumer and media initiatives with the leading technology players in the Israeli market. The majority of the 
Fund's activities are led out of its International Media Quarter in Jerusalem with industry advisors in New York, 
Los Angeles and Paris as well as an international network of strategic partners. 
JVP Media Quarter 
JVP is pioneering a new type of entrepreneurship bringing together profit and social profit, innovation and 
creativity, technology and leadership, in one place, the JVP Media Quarter in Jerusalem. The JVP Media 
Quarter brings together entrepreneurship from various disciplines and forms coming together to create the 
leaders of tomorrow, making a difference, driving both business and social transformation. Beautifully situated 
in the heart of Jerusalem's "Cultural Miles, the JVP Media Quarter gives expression to the vision of JVP to fuse 
technology, creativity and social action in one exciting complex. Located in the renovated national Mint of the 
British Empire and the Ottoman warehouses next door, the JVP Media Quarter is heralding the revitalization of 
the area surrounding Jerusalem's old train station. Today over 300 young, dynamic employees gather here 
daily to work in the venture capital firm, in The JVP Media Labs (our technology incubator), in one of the dozen 
JVP start-up and portfolio companies that chose to be headquartered in Jerusalem, in our performing arts 
incubator and theater, "The Lab" (Ha'Maabada), or in our social profit organization *JVP Community". 
Digital Media Focus 
As an entrepreneurial venture capital fund, JVP often explores new and innovative technology areas. Past 
initiatives led to prominent achievements in the wireless, optical, enterprise software and semi-conductor 
spaces. Since targeting the digital media space in 2003, JVP has built a pioneering portfolio in this area, 
focusing on consumer driven applications and services. In addition to traditional deal flow channels, JVP 
partners with media industry leaders to identify and develop new companies and business models in the digital 
media space. JVP also identifies core technologies in various markets, applying these technologies to the 
media space through new initiatives. 
Proven Track Record 
The foundations for JVP's track record derive from the firm's entrepreneurial spirit, experienced team and agile 
investment strategy. Through twenty one initial public offerings, acquisitions and mergers for its portfolio 
companies, JVP has helped to create some of the largest companies to come out of Israel over the past 
eighteen years. Specifically, JVP was the seed investor in Netro Corporation, in which JVP sold its position 
when the company was traded on NASDAQ for $5.5 billion. JVP was also the lead investor and the largest 
shareholder in Chromatis Networks, which was sold to Lucent in 2000 for $4.8 billion. Additionally, JVP was the 
largest shareholder in Precise, selling its position in 2001 when the market cap was in the range of $700 million, 
and in Cogent Communications, which, in March 2007 when JVP sold its position, was trading on NASDAQ at a 
market cap of $1.2 billion. In July 2010 JVP's portfolio company QLIK Technologies was listed on NASDAQ,
