We also highlight that all tout of our preferred 
'defensive' longs - RUB, BRL. THE, KRW - have 
relati:.My 
lx:t ?IS to the broad dollar and also US real 
rates (chart below). These betas are lower when 
estimated over the past couple of months on reduced 
positioning in the period. The estimates for the past 
month for BRL and RUB are closer to the ones obtained 
for low yielders, suggesting that positioning is also 
relatively light.

RUB. In addition to scoring well on 'defensive' metrics, 
RUB has significantly lagged the recent rally in crude 
and is cheap on our PCA-based short-term 'financial 
fair value' metric. Further, crude in RUB terms near two 
year highs boosts fiscal accounts. Also, the macro 
backdrop is supportive, with accelerating growth (as 
per high-frequency gauges) and record-low inflation. 
CBR is in cautious easing mode which is positive for FX, 
as real rates remain high while bond outflows are less

sanctions - the main risk we foresee.

Like RUB, BRL scores well on 'defensive' metrics. 
Both current and I-year ahead real rates are among the 
highest in EM (chart below). Expected FDI inflows are 4 
times as large as the current account deficit and only a 
very strong investment cycle (that we do not foresee) 
could dent this ratio. Moreover, we expect an increase 
in equity portfolio inflows as economic activity 
continues to recover during 2018. Elections remain the 
wild card, but we expect voters to reject the populist 
left and for candidates to try to capture the center.

The current account remains large; domestic 
outflows are not recycling the surplus (in spite of policy 
effort to that effect); foreigners are underweight Thai 
assets; THB does not look stretched on valuations; and 
politics appears on track for elections. BoT has not 
budged on policy despite government pressure to cut 
rates. THB gains have occurred alongside an export 
recovery, 
making 
the 
currency's 
strength 
less 
problematic.
