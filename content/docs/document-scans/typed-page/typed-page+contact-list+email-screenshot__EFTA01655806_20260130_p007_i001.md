Opinion: The FBI's Silent Battle Against Iranian Sleeper Cells 
An opinion piece from the Jerusalem Post (03/12, Fard) reported that the FBI is engaged in a silent battle against 
Iranian sleeper cells within the United States, focusing on the threat these cells pose to national security. According 
to the article, these cells are linked to the Islamic Republic of Iran and are part of a broader strategy to destabilize 
through fear and retaliation. The FBI's efforts extend to monitoring various entities with ties to Tehran, amidst 
concerns over Iran's tactics, including the assassination of key figures associated with former President Donald 
Trump. The author assessed that the FBI's engagement in a silent but critical battle against Iranian sleeper cells 
represents a vital front in the broader struggle to safeguard national security and democratic values against the 
threats of foreign-sponsored terrorism and espionage.

COUNTERINTELLIGENCE 
U.S. Lawmaker Cited NYC Protests in a Defense of Warrantless Spying 
WIRED (03/12, Cameron) reported that in a closed-door presentation aimed at defending warrantless spying under 
Section 702, House Intelligence Chair Mike Turner suggested ties between NYC anti-war protesters and Hamas to 
argue against privacy reforms. According to the article, this session, and a parallel briefing for Democrats, aimed to 
dissuade support for reforms that would require the FBI to obtain warrants before accessing Americans' 
communications collected under the program. The article noted that the FBI conducted "tens of thousands" of 
queries related to "civil unrest" between 2020 and early 2021, illustrating the broad use of surveillance powers and 
sparking concerns over the potential for reverse targeting and the erosion of privacy rights in the context of 
political protests and beyond. 
Bob Menendez's Bribery Case Reminds Us Why Proving Corruption Is So Hard 
The New York Times (03/12, Feuer) reported that Senator Bob Menendez of New Jersey was arraigned in a federal 
bribery case brought by an FBI investigation, facing new charges for accepting cash, gold bars, and a Mercedes-
Benz convertible in exchange for attempting to disrupt criminal cases and misuse his Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee position. According to the article, this follows a 2017 trial where jurors were uncertain if the gifts and 
favors he received were illegal or typical of friendship. The Supreme Court's 2016 decision, which narrowed the 
definition of corruption by requiring a specific quid pro quo for conviction, has made prosecuting such cases 
challenging. However, recent retrials and a focus on explicit quid pro quo have led to convictions, signaling a 
potential shift in how these cases might be approached, including Menendez's, which relies on new charges.

CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS 
Ghislaine Maxwell's Lawyer Tells Appeals Judges That Jeffrey Epstein's Florida Plea Deal Protects Her 
The Associated Press (03/12, Neumeister) reported that imprisoned British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell's lawyer 
asked a federal appeals court Tuesday to toss out her sex trafficking conviction and 20-year prison sentence, saying 
Jeffrey Epstein's 2007 non-prosecution deal with a U.S. attorney in Florida should have prevented her prosecution. 
The article added that attorney Diana Fabi Samson's argument was repeatedly challenged by one judge on the 2nd 
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals before the three-judge panel reserved decision. Lawyers for Maxwell are challenging 
her December 2021 conviction on multiple grounds, but the only topic at oral arguments was whether the deal 
Epstein struck in Florida to prevent a federal case against him there also protected Maxwell in New York. Samson 
said it did. A prosecutor said it didn't. Maxwell, 62, is serving her sentence at a low-security federal prison in 
Tallahassee, Florida, where yoga, Pilates, and movies are available. According to the article, Epstein's lawyers made 
a similar argument about the force of his non-prosecution deal in Florida after his July 2019, sex trafficking arrest in 
Manhattan. But the legal question became moot in his case after he took his own life a month later in a federal 
lockup as he awaited trial. ABC News (03/12, Katersky, Hill), BBC (03/12, Wendling), Business Insider (03/12,
