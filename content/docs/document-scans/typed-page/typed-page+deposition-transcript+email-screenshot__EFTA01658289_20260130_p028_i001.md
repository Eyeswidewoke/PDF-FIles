President Trump's floating of a delay in the November election on Twitter, and the immediate 
backlash from leaders and members of both parties, receives heavy coverage. At 8:10 a.m., the 
President tweeted, "Mail-In Voting is already proving to be a catastrophic disaster. Even testing 
areas are way off. The Dems talk of foreign influence in voting, but they know that Mail-In 
Voting is an easy way for foreign countries to enter the race. Even beyond that, there's no 
accurate count!" About half an hour later, Trump tweeted, "With Universal Mail-In Voting (not 
Absentee Voting, which is good), 2020 will be the most INACCURATE & FRAUDULENT Election in 
history. It will be a great embarrassment to the USA. Delay the Election until people can 
properly, securely and safely vote???" 
That second tweet drew comment and criticism quickly, and Trump tweeted at 4:22 p.m., 
"Glad I was able to get the very dishonest LameStream Media to finally start talking about the 
RISKS to our Democracy from dangerous Universal Mail-In-Voting (not Absentee Voting, which I 
totally support!)." Within the next minute, Trump tweeted, "Must know Election results on the 
night of the Election, not days, months, or even years later!" and then, "We are going to WIN 
the 2020 Election, BIG!" 
On ABC World News TonightVi (7/30, story 2, 2:25, 7.06M), David Muir said Trump's 
morning tweet "set off a firestorm, [with] even Republican leaders jumping in and quickly to try 
to put this to rest." ABC's Terry Moran: "No president has ever said anything like it. But 
President Trump, behind in the polls, with a cratering economy and a pandemic out of control," 
posted the tweet, and "later, the President tried to explain what he meant." Trump: "Do I want 
to see a date change? No. But I don't want to see a crooked election. This election will be the 
most rigged election in history if that happens." Moran: "That's a flip-flop. In April, Trump said 
this." Trump: "I never even thought of changing the date of the election. Why would I do that? 
November 3. It's a good number. No, I look forward to that election." 
On the CBS Evening NewsVi (7/30, story 4, 1:40, O'Donnell, 4.19M), Ben Tracy said 
Trump's "stunning suggestion that the election be delayed comes as he's trailing badly in the 
polls and at the same time the nation's GDP reached a historic low. In a remarkable tweet, he 
made the unfounded claim that mail-in voting will make the election `the most inaccurate and 
fraudulent in history,' and suggested a delay until people can `properly, securely, and safely 
vote.' ... The top Republicans in Congress rebuked the idea." Senate Majority Leader McConnell: 
"We'll cope with whatever the situation is, and we will have the election on November 3 as 
already scheduled." House Minority Leader McCarthy: "Never in the history of the federal 
elections have we ever not held an election, and we should go forward with our election." 
Lester Holt said on NBC Nightly NewsVi (7/30, story 2, 1:35, 5.82M) that there was "a 
strong backlash" after Trump "suggested that this fall's election could be delayed over his 
concerns about mail-in voting." NBC's Peter Alexander: "The President has no power to delay a 
general election. The Constitution says it is up to Congress to set the date. And with Democrats 
controlling the House, that will not happen. ... Trump's suggestion [was] immediately dismissed 
even by top Republicans." On the Brian Kilmeade ShowVi (7/30), HUD Secretary Carson said, 
"Obviously, the President can't do that. Congress would have to do that. But I think the point 
that he's making is that this is a system that is ripe for corruption, and it's not like there's a 
historical evidence of that occurring and this is much too important an election to ignore this." 
The AP (7/30, Miller, Sherman, Long) reports under the headline "Trump Floats Idea Of 
Election Delay, A Virtual Impossibility" that Trump, "lagging in the polls and grappling with 
deepening economic and public health crises, on Thursday floated the startling idea of delaying" 
the election. His campaign "to sow doubt about the election's outcome drew immediate 
pushback from Democrats and Republicans alike in a nation that has held itself up as a beacon 
to the world for its history of peaceful transfer of power." Reuters (7/30, Holland) reports, 
"Critics and even Trump's allies dismissed the notion as an unserious attempt to distract from 
devastating economic news, but some legal experts warned that his repeated attacks could 
undermine his supporters' faith in the election process."
