stitution z I — z. and reversing the inequality, we recover Eq. ( 10). 
Again, the intuition behind this correspondence is described in 
Appendix A. 
Numerical simulations of the evolutionary dynamics with a 
recessive police allele are shown in fig. II.

The shape of the efficiency function, G. determines whether 
policing is more likely to evolve for single mating or multiple 
matings. Recall that r, is the colony efficiency (defined as the rate 
of generation of reproductives) if a fraction, z. of all workers per-
form policing. The variable z can assume values between 0 and 1. If 
no workers police, z= O. then the colony efficiency is at baseline, 
which we set to one; therefore, we have ro= I. Policing can in 
principle increase or decrease colony efficiency (Fig. 12). 
We have the following results regarding the invasion and sta-
bility of police workers. We discuss single (n-1). double (n=2), 
and triple (n-3) mating. All results apply to both dominant and 
recessive police alleles. They can be instantiated with arbitrarily 
small changes in colony efficiency. 
7.1. Evolutionary invasion of policing 
(i) If r, is strictly constant (which is ungeneric), then policing does 
not invade for single mating, is neutral for double mating, and 
does invade for triple mating. 
(ii) If r, is monotonically decreasing, then policing either invades 
not at all or only for triple mating. 
(iii) If r, is monotonically increasing, then policing either invades 
for single, double, and triple mating or only for double and 
triple mating. 
(iv) If r, reaches an intermediate maximum (which means colony 
efficiency is highest for an intermediate fraction of police
