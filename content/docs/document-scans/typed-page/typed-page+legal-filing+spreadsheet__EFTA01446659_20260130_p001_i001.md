FX Blueprint: Thin end of the wedge 
Theme 1t3: - Home Counties trump Mounties 
▪ 
Inflation risks and potential FDI inflows should 
keep sterling supported this year, but a widening 
current account deficit and stronger USD will 
constrain gains versus the euro and dollar. We are 
moderately 
bearish 
EUR/GBP 
and 
GBP/USD. 
forecasting 80p and 1.54 by end-year respectively. 
• 
As an outright trade we prefer buying GBP versus 
CAD, on which we are more bearish. It remains 
vulnerable to an equally-large current account 
deficit, CE-flow unwinds and unwinding internal 
imbalances. 
The UK domestic demand cycle has kicked in quicker, 
stronger and more sustainably than anticipated. We 
see inflation and FDI inflows as being the major source 
of upside risk for GBP next year. 
Inflation, not deflation to be theme in 2014 
Last year was all about UK growth expectations. This 
year, the risk is attention turns to prices. First, even 
though recent inflation prints have surprised to the 
downside, pipeline pressure is building. Productivity is 
not recovering as quickly as the BoE is expecting, 
leading to a much faster than expected drop in the 
unemployment rate. In turn, wage inflation could 
accelerate sharply in 2014 (chart 1). Second, the 
starting point of inflation is much higher in the UK than 
the rest of G10. Any turn in the trend will focus minds 
much more quickly than elsewhere. With the first BoE 
rate hike still only priced for mid-2015 (a bit earlier than 
the Fed), there is plenty of potential for near-term yield 
support as price pressure builds. 
Outside of monetary policy, FIN is another source of 
support. Excluding the Verizone-Vodafone deal, UK 
inbound M&A has been muted by pre-crisis standards. 
But UK deal-flow is pro-cyclical, tracking the broad 
trends in equities and global M&A transactions well. 
Our equity analysts are positive on both this year. Add 
to that the UK government's increasing dedication to 
attracting foreign investment - particularly into the 
publicly-owned banks - (chart 2) and FDI stands out as 
a potential additional source of support for GBP in 2014. 
Current Account Deficit Will Constrain Gains vs EUB 
On the flipside, the UK recovery is happening for the 
"wrong" reasons. Domestic demand, not exports are 
driving the cycle. The current account deficit is 
deteriorating and stands in contrast to the US and 
Euro-area. This goes a long way to explain the lag in 
EUR/GBP versus cyclical indicators (chart 3). This is 
reflected in our conservative EUR/GBP forecasts: we 
see a slow grind lower to 0.80 by the end of the year, 
with GBP/USD revisiting the low 1.50s on the back of a 
strong USD.
