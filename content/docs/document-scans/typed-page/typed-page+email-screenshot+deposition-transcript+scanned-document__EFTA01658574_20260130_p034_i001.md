DO) Suit Alleges Discrimination In Yale's Admissions Process. 
The AP (10/8, Balsamo) reports the Justice Department sued Yale University in federal court in 
Connecticut Thursday, alleging that the university "discriminates based on race and national 
origin in its undergraduate admissions process, and that race is the determinative factor in 
hundreds of admissions decisions each year." The suit comes "about two months after the 
Justice Department publicly accused Yale of discrimination, saying its investigation found that 
Asian American and white students have `only one-tenth to one-fourth of the likelihood of 
admission as African American applicants with comparable academic credentials." Reuters 
(10/8) says the suit "followed a two-year investigation that followed a complaint by Asian-
American groups about the New Haven, Connecticut-based university's practices." The Wall 
Street Journal (10/8, Korn, Gurman, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) calls the suit an 
escalation of the Administration's examination of the race and admissions policies of elite 
colleges. 
USA Today (10/8, Aspegren, 10.31M) reports Yale president Peter Salovey denied the 
lawsuit's allegations. In a statement, calling the suit "baseless," Salovey said Yale's admissions 
policies will not change because. The New York Times (10/8, Hartocollis, 18.61M) reports 
Salovey's statement said the allegation was based on "inaccurate statistics and unfounded 
conclusions."

comes after the USDA chief has increasingly blurred the lines between his public duties and his 
political support for Trump." 
NLRB Issues Complaint Against Google Contractor. 
The New York Times (10/8, Scheiber, 18.61M) reports the NLRB issued a complaint this week 
against HCL America, "a contractor hired by Google and accused it of violating its employees' 
labor rights, marking the latest flash point in a long-running struggle between workers and 
technology companies." In the complaint, the agency says HCL "illegally discouraged workers 
from belonging to a union, and of failing to bargain with the union in good faith." Last fall, "a 
group of about 90 HCL employees in Pittsburgh who do work such as data analysis under a 
contract the company has with Google voted to unionize." The complaint says "managers at the 
company interrogated workers about the organizing activities of their colleagues, told them that 
promotions and wages were being delayed because of the union campaign and threatened to 
enforce work rules more strictly if the union was created, in violation of federal labor law."

Doctor Visit. 
USA Today (10/8, Wolf, 10.31M) reports the Supreme Court "ruled on a temporary basis 
Thursday night that women seeking to end their pregnancies with medication do not need to 
visit a health care provider, given the COVID-19 pandemic." The action "was a setback for the 
Trump administration, which had sought to reinstate a 20-year-old policy following lower court 
rejections." The Court "ordered the government to make its case in more detail before a federal 
trial court, a process that could take six weeks and extend beyond Election Day." According to 
Politico (10/8, Ollstein, 4.29M), "Both sides of the abortion debate had been closely watching 
the case for signals of how the Supreme Court would approach the issue" after the death of
