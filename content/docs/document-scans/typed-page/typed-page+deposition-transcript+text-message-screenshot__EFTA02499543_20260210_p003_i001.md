she and ada each protecting what they see as their turf, errors upon errors upon =rrors. ( iei only last thurs forming a 
brand new Ilc for alex with no input from=20 finance. ) millions of dollars unaccounted for. 500k again found in a 
drawer=20 last week In early sept I notified you that I thought that joslin was=20 unable to deal with both ada and 
eileen . I sent delson in to referee.. at my expens= . i again notifed you in early oct that she needed to go asapor as 
close tot>=A0 oct 15 as possible . and ada till march. I pointed out the risk of keepin= the dynamic duo was their effect 
on joslin and future mistakes. . . in nov I sent you a email telling=20 you i thought he could not take more of their 
interference. obfuscation and scheming. and sugg=sted, again in writing. getting rid of both immediately, this week, in 
the first face to face I had withioslin since dec he could not respond to simple questions, spoke financial gibberish, had 
misleading answers. bad answers wild elliptical statements , and=20 non sensical plans for the future. therefore . As 
you asked i immediately confronted Brad with my discovery , and to my amazement=C2. and frankly dismay Brad said 
that his take was exactly the same as mine but this is how he had found Joslin in early jan and thought it was just his 
normal behavior. Since brad has little financial expertise , it seems he assuumed =he gibberish was just his ,brads, lack of 
understanding , In mid nov you suggested that he was your choice to run the office .and he would replace eileen. from 
mid dec he audited until early jan, when he assumed the job th=t im told now is only 75% of his time. He might. , 
might? be c=pable of running your office but i have yet to see any indication that that is true. He is certainly a loyal 
friend. ON thurs I handed the same spread sheet that I had sent to brad, to four4=A0 financial execs. (only to mine 
with the actual numbers included ), =C240to a person each within minutes said this makes no sense. no sense 
whatsoe=er, bad numbers bad categories. bad inputs outputs numbers that dont add. if=20 it was an mri , of joslin i 
would say serious breakdown. Q=A0I had him over my house in an attempt for him to explain to my team what had 
ha=pened, and then sent my do to speak for hours to him and others at elysium. I pointed out to you that joslin could 
not make the first pass at hiring a finance person . I was right. HE is a great tax person, period. no social skills reporting 
skills or mgmt skills. ITS a mess and a larger one than I thought. sorry, I have begun to interview some cfo.sQ=A0 for 
you and have put out more feelers. if you feel comfortable i think you should ask at apollo for=20 help.. It is now too 
late to remove Eileen out entirely as i ha= been urgently requesting. I have not spoken to her in months . but during 
this craz= delay in doing so, she is now significantly more entrenched. the office more intricately entwined and a danger 
to you. A re-do is necessary . top down.
