model and the inability of U.S. political system to address major issues. Recent=polls and studies of opinion in emerging 
powers come to many of the same c=nclusions.26 
These perceptions wi=l be fed and nurtured by parallel actions and trends which will undercut t=e viability of the existing 
paradigm. Critics at home are already suggesti=g that the United States will be unable to sustain the demands of its 
"strategic tilt to Asia" given planned bud=et cuts, or meet the requirements of both Middle East and Asian 
contingenc=es.27 As the United States is forced to pursue cost-saving measures, such =s cancellations of major weapons 
systems or troop reductions from key regions, the sense of a paradigm in f=ee-fall will accelerate. We see this already in 
the recommendations in man= reports, even those arguing for a general promotion of forward deployment= for a 
reduction if not elimination of the U.S. force presence in Europe.28 
In addition to a los= of global credibility, a paradigm in crisis also threatens the credibilit= of specific U.S. military and 
foreign policy doctrines. When concepts and=doctrines flow from stressed conventional-wisdom worldviews, those 
concepts and doctrines begin to take on the air of empty=rhetoric. A good parallel was the British "two-power" doctrine 
(the noti=n that the Royal Navy should match the world's next two best fleets combin=d), which eventually became a 
form of self-reassurance without strategic significance. After a certain point,=Aaron Friedberg explains, "official analyses 
of Britain's position took o= an air of incompleteness and unreality."29 One can begin to sense this t=ndency in some 
recent U.S. conceptual statements, such as AirSea Battle: from all the public evidence, this conc=pt appears to respond 
to growing challenges to U.S. power projection capab=lities with an immense amount of vague rhetoric about 
intentions,30 couple= with bold new plans to expand planned military efforts in precisely the region where such 
insertion of m=litary might is becoming more problematic. Meantime, the heyday of counter=nsurgency doctrine 
appears to have come and gone. 
A perception of stra=egic insolvency, if not corrected by a readjustment of priorities and comm=tments, will trigger a 
decline in perceived credibility of threats and pro=ises. The risk then becomes that, in a future scenario, an American 
administration will lurch into a crisis ass=ming that it can take actions with the same effect as before. Instead, a p=edge 
or demand will be ignored by an adversary (or an ally or friend) now =nimpressed with the viability of U.S. defense policy 
and the United States will find itself in a conflict t=at its degraded defense posture could not forestall. Advocates of the 
curr=nt paradigm agree with the risk, but have a different solution: expand the=defense budget; reaffirm global 
commitments; reassure allies. But the United States simply does not have t=at option because, as argued above, the 
factors closing down on the curren= paradigm are not merely momentary or reversible they are structural. The only way 
out is a recalibrated strategic posture. 
A related risk, then= is a form of strategic opportunity cost. Every ounce of energy spent tryi=g to prop up an obsolete 
strategic paradigm forfeits the opportunity to di=cover new and sustainable ways of meeting the same U.S. interests and 
goals. The pivot to Asia is a perfect example.=Instead of pursuing the pivot and institutionalizing an unsustainable 
U.S.=regional position, Washington should be constructing and moving toward a p=st-primacy architecture in Asia. The 
fact is that we have a limited grace period-perhaps a decade, perhaps =ess-to put into place regional and global security 
architectures for a pos=-primacy world, structures that envision a revised while still prominent r=le for the United 
States. Using that precious and dwindling time to prop up a fraying paradigm would be co=nterproductive. 
Diplomacy increasing=y fails. A parallel risk has to do with the ebbing force of U.S. diplomacy=and influence. 
International power is grounded in legitimacy, and in many =ays it is precisely the legitimacy of the leading power's 
global posture that is under assault as its posture=comes into question. Historically, rising challengers gradually stop 
respe=ting the hegemon's right to lead, and they begin to make choices on behalf=of the international community, in 
part due to strategies consciously designed to frustrate the leading po=er's designs. Germany, under Bismarck and after, 
is one example: It aspire= to unification and to its "rightful place" as a leading European power =s its power and 
influence accumulated, its willingness to accept the inherent legitimacy of the existing order as=defined by other states, 
and the validity and force of their security para=igms, declined proportionately. At nearly all points in this trajectory, 
G=rman leaders did not seek to depose the international system, but to crowd into its leadership ranks, to mute =he 
voices of others relative to its own influence, and to modify rather th=n abolish rules.
