(2) The above is for illustrative purposes only and is intended to show how Sins analyzes technology investments. It does not represent any particular Sins 
Investment. Sins' strategies and targets depend on a variety of factors, including the prevailing market environment and investment availability and opportunity, 
and there can be no assurance that the conditions upon which such strategies and targets are based will materialize. Sins seeks to invest in deals where the Bond 
division can achieve the range of returns set forth above. The target gross returns sot forth herein are based on Sins' belief regarding what returns may be 
achievable on investments that Siris intends to pursue in light of the Sins Founders' experience with similar investments, and are also based on an assumption 
that economics, market and other conditions will not deteriorate and, in some cases, will improve. Additionally, the Call Option may require significant additional
