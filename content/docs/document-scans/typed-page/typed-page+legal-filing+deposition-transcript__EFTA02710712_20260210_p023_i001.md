=font face="Georgia, serif">Paraphrasing the meaning of Andy Warhol's most famous idiom, Russia's fifteen minutes 
may be coming to a= end. The Russian government publically acknowledged this week that the country will fall into 
recession next year, battered by the combination of Western sanctions and a dramatic plunge in the price of its oil 
exports. The news caused the stock market to drop and pushed the ruble to a fresh record low against the dollar. The 
economic development ministry on Tuesday revised its GDP forecast for 2015 from growth of 1.2 percent to a drop of 
0.8 percent. Russian households are expected to take h=t, with disposable income seen declining by 2.8 percent against 
the previously expected 0.4 percent growth. 
Russia's economic outlook is at the mercy=of the global market for oil, a key export that finances the bulk of the state 
budget. Sanctions over Moscow's role in eastern Ukraine are making things worse, hurting =ussian banks and 
investment sentiment in particular. The national currency, the ruble, has dropped by more than 40 percent this year as 
the economic troubles mounted. That in turn risks spawni=g more problems, such as a spike in inflation that would 
pinch consumers. 
While Russia's troubles c=uld do some economic damage to Europe, they are unlikely to have much impact on the U.S. 
economy, the worl='s largest. Russia is the 28th-biggest market for the United States, absorbing $11.1 billion worth of 
U.S. goods l=st year. "Russia-U.S. trade is hardly large," said Eric=Lascelles, chief economist at RBC Global Asset 
Management. "I don't think we should be worried" about the impact of a Russia= recession on U.S. exports. 
<= class="MsoNormal">In fact, the U.S. is benefiting from the lower oil pri=es that are driving Russian toward recession, 
and the money being pulled out of Rus=ia is being pumped into U.S. and European financial markets, helping to keep 
interest rates low, Lascelles said. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, agreed, saying: "I=don't think 
there's any direct economic impact" on the United States. However, he noted that Russian President Vladimir Putin 
could respond to the economic trouble= by trying to divert the Russian public's attention with even more belliger=nt 
policies toward Ukraine and the West, raising tensions and perhaps rattling financial markets. 
The release of the forecast on Tuesday afternoon weighed on the Russian stock market and the ruble, which fell 5.4 
percent lower agains= the dollar, to a new all-time low of 53.97 per dollar. Finance Minist=r Anton Siluanov attempted 
to talk up the ruble, arguing that the new forecast for Russia's economy i= too gloomy. He told Russian news agency it is 
only "an early estimate and it is still being discussed." Siluanov said the ruble is oversold and its current exchange rate 
would correlate to=the oil price of $60 per barrel. The global price of oil, Brent, traded around =70 a barrel on Tuesday. 
Russia's economic stability is important for the region.=lt is a major trading partner for Western Europe, selling raw 
materials and oil a=d gas to the West and importing consumer goods and foodstuffs. European agricultural producers 
reported big losses following the Kremlin's ban =n some imports. A weaker economy and a weaker ruble would also 
mean that fewer Russians will be traveling abroad and spending their money there.
