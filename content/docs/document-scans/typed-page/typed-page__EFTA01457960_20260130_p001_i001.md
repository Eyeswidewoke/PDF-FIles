holes: lack of competitiveness, inefficient 
bureaucracy, clientelism, capital flight, 
brain drain. For quite a while, it has not 
been able to keep afloat on the strength of 
its own resources and even threatened to 
sink in 2010. It was rescued by the Troika 
coming aboard. Perhaps the latter started 
to plug the wrong holes first and missed 
some completely. But the ship continued 
to sink simply because the holes were 
too many. The process of sinking was at 
least slowed down and even somewhat 
reversed in 2014 when Greece reported 
a primary-budget and current-account 
surplus - although these figures should 
be taken with caution. Despite only a 
restrained implementation of reforms, 
there was a kind of dynamism. The Greek 
people should bear this in mind during the 
uncomfortable times ahead. 
How will the compromise affect the value 
of the euro? 
Compared to what? The euro of a perfect 
monetary union? The euro after "Grexit"? 
An exchange rate is a dynamic matter and 
can never be explained in a monocausal 
way. Should the centrifugal forces in the 
Eurozone increase and the belief grow 
that the ECB does finance public debt 
after all, this will gradually translate into a 
weaker euro and lower government-bond 
prices. 
Does Athens need a debt relief? 
Short-and medium-term debt service 
is the smallest problem Greece faces. 
Discussing this is a waste of time. What 
is important now is putting the country 
structurally back on its feet so that it 
attracts domestic and foreign investors. 
Irrespective of the amount of debt it owes, 
Greece has no future without foreign 
direct investment.
How to stop ouro frustration? 
One thing is for sure: Europe must 
continue to develop, deepen its 
commitments to its citizens and present 
loaders who reignite their enthusiasm 
for it. There must be a clear definition 
of concepts such as self-responsibility, 
solidarity and subsidiarity in Europe 
again, and they must be embraced in 
reality and not just in theory. These are the 
basic pillars of a fiscal union a genuine 
fiscal union and not a simple transfer 
union. Transfers, such as in the form 
of structural funds, have been a basic 
element of European politics tor decades.
Sut the desired economic convergence 
will regularly fail to materialize as long as 
the institutional framework is flawed. A 
stimulus quickly turns into reliance and 
inertia. It is indispensable for Europe's 
economic and political future to optimize 
incentive systems alongside control 
and sanction mechanisms 
and that citizens keep 
their trust in the 
binding force of 
rules. It is a shame 
that the German arid 
French governments, 
who should have 
been exemplars, 
undermined this 
trust by breaking the 
Maastricht rules as early 
as 2002. 
Change through pressure 
The month of July once again was 
focused on unforeseeable twists in the 
Greek tragedy. The Greek population 
is presented with a harsher reform 
package than it had turned down in the 
referendum, and how does it react? 
It accepts the package and supports 
Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras more than 
ever. The odds for successful reforms 
are therefore better than for all his 
predecessors. Continuing pressure from 
Europe is helping too.
