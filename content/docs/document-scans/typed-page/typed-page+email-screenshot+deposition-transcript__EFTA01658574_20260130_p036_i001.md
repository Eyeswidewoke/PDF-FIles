decision, either to the full 7th Circuit or to the U.S. Supreme Court. A spokeswoman did not 
immediately respond to a request for comment." 
Kagan Refuses To Block Montana Ballot-Mailing. The AP (10/8) reports, "A final 
effort to block most Montana counties from mailing general election ballots to active voters was 
denied Thursday, a day before the ballots are to be mailed." Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan 
"rejected a request for an emergency injunction" filed by state and county Republicans who 
wanted to block a ruling upholding a decision by Gov. Steve Bullock (D) "to give counties the 
option to hold the Nov. 3 election mostly by mail due to the pandemic. Forty-five of Montana's 
56 counties decided to do so." CNN (10/8, Vogue, Kelly, 83.16M) reports on its website that 
Kagan, "who has jurisdiction over the lower court involved in the case, turned down the request 
without referring the petition to her colleagues or asking the other side for its views." 
Federal Judge Strikes Down Limit On Ohio Ballot Drop Box Sites. The Cleveland 
Plain Dealer (10/8, 895K) reports US District Judge Dan Polster on Thursday struck down an 
order by Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose (R) "barring county boards of election from 
setting up multiple ballot drop box sites, saying the order unfairly burdens large counties." 
Polster "also cited the coronavirus pandemic, which he said creates a greater strain on the mail 
system and increases demand for remote voting options." 
Facebook Bans Accounts Linked To Pro-Trump "Troll Farm." 
The Washington Post (10/8, Stanley-Becker, 14.2M) reports that Facebook said Thursday "that 
it will permanently ban from its platform an Arizona-based marketing firm running what experts 
described as a domestic 'troll farm' following an investigation of the deceptive behavior 
prompted by a Washington Post article last month." According to the Post, "The firm, Rally 
Forge, was 'working on behalf' of Turning Point Action, an affiliate of Turning Point USA, the 
prominent conservative youth organization based in Phoenix, Facebook concluded." The Wall 
Street Journal (10/8, Volz, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) reports Facebook said it has 
removed 200 Facebook accounts, 55 Facebook pages and 76 Instagram accounts for posing as 
fake users to praise President Trump and criticize Joe Biden. 
Politico (10/8, Overly, 4.29M) reports that Rally Forge "employed people who used use 
fake names and profile pictures while commenting on content posted by other users or 
mainstream media outlets, Facebook's head of security policy, Nathaniel Gleicher, said 
Thursday." Gleicher "said Facebook is not penalizing Turning Point or Inclusive Conservation 
Group, though it's still investigating whether other deceptive tactics were deployed." Axios 
(10/8, Fischer, 521K) says this is "the most recent example of Facebook taking action on a 
group linked to fringe conservatives or conservative ideology for spreading misinformation or 
attempting to persuade public debate with fake accounts." 
Bloomberg (10/8, Frier, 4.73M) reports Twitter "also disclosed a group of information 
operations on Thursday, and said it removed 1,594 accounts from the service for 'various 
violations of our platform manipulation policies." However, "None of the five networks pulled by 
Twitter originated in the U.S." The AP (10/8, Klepper) provides similar coverage. 
Court Strikes Down Obama-Era Methane Rule. 
The Hill (10/8, Frazin, 2.98M) reports a federal court "struck down an Obama-era regulation 
targeting methane leaks from drilling on public lands, arguing that it went beyond the scope of 
the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), which promulgated the rule." The rule "required oil and 
gas companies to cut a practice called flaring, in which natural gas is burned, by half, inspect 
their sites for leaks and replace old equipment that released too much methane." Judge 
Stephen Skavdahl, an Obama appointee, wrote, "Although the stated purpose of the Rule is 
waste prevention, significant aspects of the Rule evidence its primary purpose being driven by 
an effort to regulate air emissions, particularly greenhouse gases."
