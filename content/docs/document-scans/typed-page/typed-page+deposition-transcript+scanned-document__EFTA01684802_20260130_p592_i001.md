Any claim shall be resolved, upon the election 
by you or us, by arbitration pursuant to this 
Arbitration provision and the code of 
procedures of the arbitration organization to 
which the claim is referred in effect at the time 
the claim is filed (code), except to the extent 
the code conflicts with this Agreement. Claims 
shall be referred to either JAMS or the 
American Arbitration Association (AAA), as 
selected by the party electing to use 
arbitration. If our selection of either of these 
organizations is unacceptable to you, you 
may select the other organization within 30 
days after you receive notice of our selection. 
For a copy of the code, to file a claim or for 
other information, contact either: JAMS (1920 
Main St *0300. Irvine. CA 92614 or 
jamsadr.com) or AM (335 Madison Ave, New 
York, NY 10017 or adrorg). 
In addition to the organizations listed above, 
claims may be referred to any other arbitration 
organization that is mutually agreed upon in 
writing by you and us, or to an arbitration 
organization or arbitrator(s) appointed 
pursuant to § 5 of the Federal Arbitration Act, 
9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16, as it may be amended 
below. (FAA), provided that any such 
organization and arbitrator(s) will enforce the 
terms of the Restrictions on Arbitration 
subsection set forth below. 
Significance of Arbitration 
IF ARBITRATION IS CHOSEN BY ANY 
PARTY WITH RESPECT TO A CLAIM, 
NEITHER YOU NOR WE WILL HAVE THE 
RIGHT TO LITIGATE THAT CLAIM IN 
COURT OR HAVE A JURY TRIAL ON THAT 
CLAIM. FURTHER, YOU AND WE WILL NOT 
HAVE THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A 
REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY OR AS A 
MEMBER OF ANY CLASS OF CLAIMANTS 
PERTAINING TO ANY CLAIM SUBJECT TO 
ARBITRATION. EXCEPT AS SET FORTH 
BELOW, THE ARBITRATOR'S DECISION 
WILL BE FINAL AND BINDING. NOTE THAT 
OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU OR WE 
WOULD HAVE IF YOU WENT TO COURT 
ALSO MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE IN 
ARBITRATION. 
Restrictions on Arbitration 
IF EITHER PARTY ELECTS TO RESOLVE A 
CLAIM BY ARBITRATION, THAT CLAIM 
SHALL BE ARBITRATED ON AN 
INDIVIDUAL BASIS. THERE SHALL BE NO 
RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY CLAIMS 
TO BE ARBITRATED ON A CLASS ACTION 
BASIS OR ON BASES INVOLVING CLAIMS 
BROUGHT IN A PURPORTED 
REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY ON BEHALF 
OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC, OTHER 
CARDMEMBERS OR OTHER PERSONS 
SIMILARLY SITUATED. The arbitrator's 
authority to resolve claims is limited to claims 
between you and us alone, and the 
arbitrator's authority to make awards is limited 
to awards to you and us alone. Furthermore, 
claims brought by you against us, or by us 
against you, may not be joined or 
consolidated in arbitration with claims brought 
by or against someone other than you, unless 
agreed to in writing by all parties. No 
arbitration award or decision will have any 
preclusive effect as to issues or claims in any 
dispute with anyone who is not a named party 
to the arbitration. Notwithstanding any other 
provision of this Agreement (including but not 
limited to the Continuation subsection below) 
and without waiving either party's right to 
appeal such decision, should any portion of 
this Restrictions on Arbitration subsection be 
deemed invalid or unenforceable, then the 
entire Arbitration provision (other than this 
sentence) shall not apply. 
Arbitration Procedures 
This Arbitration provision is made pursuant to 
transactions involving interstate commerce 
and shall be governed by the FAA. The 
arbitration shal be governed by the applicable 
code, except that this Agreement shall apply if 
there are any conflicts. The arbitrator shall 
apply applicable substantive law consistent 
with the FAA and applicable statutes of 
limitations, shall honor claims of privilege 
recognized al law, and, at the timely request 
of either party, shall provide a brief written 
explanation of the basis for the decision. 
The arbitration proceeding shall not be 
governed by any federal or state rules of civil 
procedure or rules of evidence. Any party may 
request that the arbitrator expand the scope 
of discovery by doing son writing and 
copying any other parties, who shall have 15 
days to make objections. The arbitrator will 
notify the parties of his/her decision within 20 
days of any objecting party's submission. The 
arbitrator shall take reasonable steps to 
preserve privacy. The arbitrator's award shall 
be final and binding, except for any right of 
appeal provided by the FAA; however, either 
party shall have 30 days to appeal that 
decision by notifying the arbitration 
organization and any other parties in writing. 
The organization will then appoint a three-
arbitrator panel which shall consider anew 
any aspect of the decision objected to by the 
appealing party. The panel shall issue its 
decision, by majority vole. within 120 days of 
the appealing party's written notice. Judgment 
upon any award rendered by the arbitrator or 
panel may be entered in any court having 
jurisdiction. 
Location of Arbitration 
Arbitration hearings you attend shall take 
place in the federal judicial district of your 
residence. 
Payment of Fees 
You will be responsible for paying your share, 
if any. of the arbitration fees (including filing, 
administrative, hearing and/or other fees), but 
only up to the amount of the filing fees you 
would have incurred if you had brought a 
claim in the state or federal court closest to 
your billing address that would have had 
jurisdiction. We will be responsible for any 
additional arbitration fees. At your written 
request, we will consider in good faith making 
a temporary advance of all or part of your 
share of any arbitration fees. You wit not be 
assessed any arbitration fees in excess of 
your share if you do not prevail in any 
arbitration with us. 
Continuation 
This Arbitration provision shall survive termi-
nation of your Account; voluntary payment of 
the Account balance in full by you; any legal 
proceeding by you or us to collect a debt 
owed by the other; any bankruptcy by you or 
us; and any sale by us of your Account (in the 
case of a sale, its terms shall apply to the 
buyer of your Account). If any portion of this 
Arbitration provision, except as otherwise pro-
vided in the Restrictions on Arbitration sub-
section, is deemed invalid or unenforceable, it 
shall not invalidate the remaining portions of 
this provision.
