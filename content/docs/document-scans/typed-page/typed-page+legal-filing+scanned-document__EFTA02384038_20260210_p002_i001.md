October 21, 2013 -- In the UN General Assembly on October 1, Israeli prime =inister Benjamin Netanyahu described 
Iran's strategy as to retain "suffi=ient nuclear material and sufficient nuclear infrastructure to race to the=bomb at a 
time it chooses to do so." In general, there are three main co=ditions that will need to be present in order for Iran to 
develop a nuclea= weapon. First, Iran would need the technical capacity to produce a critic.' mass of the uranium 
isotope U-235 (about 25 kg of uranium enriched to 90=) or the plutonium isotope Pu-239 (about 8 kg of weapons-grade 
plutonium),=develop a detonation mechanism, and a delivery method. Secondly, Iran woul= need to make a political 
decision to militarize the nuclear program. And =hird, no external actor must succeed with halting, delaying or 
destroying =he nuclear program with neither military nor other means. The U.S. and Isr=el are the only two countries 
that have signaled willingness to conduct a =ilitary operation against Iran's nuclear program. 
Given the first two conditions, one critical question should be examined to=derive Iran's strategy to "race to the bomb at 
a time it chooses to do s=": How can Iran reduce the probability that a military operation would s=cceed (or even 
undertaken) after it has made the decision to break out for=the bomb? 
Iran can reduce the expected time frame between when the militarization pro=ess begins and when a nuclear bomb is 
produced, thereby reducing the time =vailable to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and Western 
interligence agencies to detect the militarization and for political decision m=kers to undertake actions to stop it. Iran 
can reduce the time frame neede= to acquire critical mass of enriched uranium to a minimum by stockpiling = large 
amount of uranium enriched to a level of near 20% and install more =dvanced and effective centrifuges. A small time 
frame would also have an i=ternal effect on the Iranian decision-making and decision-undertaking. Whe= the time from 
breakout to bomb is large, it is difficult to keep knowledg= of the breakout secret within a limited group. It would then 
be time avai=able for oppositionists in the regime (or workers at the facilities) to mo=ilize against the decision (or alert 
external actors). The opposite would =e the case when the time frame is limited. 
A successful Israeli military operation would in part rely on the ability t= achieve surprise. However, since an Israeli 
operation might be triggered =y the breakout itself, Iran would be able to dictate the terms. By reducin= the time 
needed to produce critical mass of enriched uranium and coordina=e the breakout with a larger military exercise, Israel's 
ability to achiev= the element of surprise would be reduced—and Israel would thus have an =ncentive to launch an 
attack before the breakout. 
Iran can also reduce the utility of an intervention by finishing the heavy-=ater reactor in Arak and start operating it. A 
fully operational plutonium=producing reactor would be a politically sensitive target for any interven=ionist, since the 
civilian—and thus political—costs of bombing such a =eactor would be quite large. If a military operation would leave 
the Arak =eactor intact and only focus on the three other critical facilities in Nat=nz, Fordow and Isfahan, Iran could use 
the reactor for producing material =or a nuclear bomb in the aftermath of the attack. In practice, this means =hat if a 
military operation is to be deployed, it should be conducted befo=e the Arak reactor is operative. The attack on the 
Syrian al-Kibar reactor=was reportedly triggered by similar concerns. Given the prize of achieving=the immunizing effect 
of an operative reactor, Iran might be willing to te=porarily suspend the enrichment program (or part of it) if a military 
inte=vention seems probable. In particular, a negotiated agreement where Iran i= required to suspend its enrichment 
activity in Natanz and Fordow might be.acceptable for the regime as long as the construction of the heavy water r=actor 
in Arak is allowed to continue. An agreement of this kind might also=provide Iran with more time to continue possible 
research concerning a det=nation mechanism, warhead design, and delivery method. However, an interve=tionist would 
have an incentive to launch an attack before the reactor is =perational, which means that its start-up date might trigger 
an operation =gainst the other facilities as well. Iran's strategists are probably think=ng hard about how to make the 
reactor operative without anybody finding ou= until after its start-up date. 
Iran would have an incentive to delay the construction of a reprocessing fa=ility. Such a facility would be necessary to 
extract plutonium from the fu=l rods used in the reactor. Iran has currently no known such facility with=the capability to 
serve the Arak reactor, but would have an incentive to c=nstruct it after the reactor has gone critical. Constructing it 
now would =ust cause unnecessary friction with Western countries due to its probable =ilitary purpose. 
Iran would also have an incentive to delay the breakout if it expects new d=fensive military means to be acquired or 
developed within a certain time f=ame. New acquisitions would increase Iran's general defensive capacity, th=reby 
reducing an interventionist's ability to achieve a successful militar= operation. Iran has previously voiced its interest in 
the Russian-made S-=00 anti-aircraft battery, though the Russians chose to halt the transfer o= the system. Iran could be 
expected to delay the breakout if Russia would =ignal renewed interest in transferring this system or similar ones.
