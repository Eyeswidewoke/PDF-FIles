the case of a liquidation distribution. If we are unable to complete our business combination within 24 months 
from the closing of this offering, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as 
promptly as reasonably possible but not more than 
90 
ten business days thereafter. redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate 
amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (net of the amount of interest which may be 
withdrawn to pay taxes and less up to $50,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of 
then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders' rights as 
stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and 
(iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining 
stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under 
Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. Accordingly, it is 
our intention to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible following our 24th month and, therefore, 
we do not intend to comply with those procedures. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any 
claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may 
extend well beyond the third anniversary of such date. 
Because we will not be complying with Section 280. Section 281(b) of the DGCL requires us to adopt a plan, 
based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or 
claims that may be potentially brought against us within the subsequent 10 years. However, because we are a 
blank check company. rather than an operating company. and our operations will be limited to searching for 
prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as 
lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses. As described above, pursuant to the obligation 
contained in our underwriting agreement, we will seek to have all vendors, service providers (other than our 
independent auditors), prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute 
apternents with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust 
account. 
As a result of this obligation, the claims that could be made against us arc significantly limited and the 
likelihood that any claim that would result in any liability extending to the trust account is remote. Further, our 
sponsor may be liable only to the extent neri.soity to ensure that the amounts in the trust account are not reduced 
below (i) $10.00 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date 
of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets other than due to the failure to 
obtain such waiver, in each case net of the amount of interest withdrawn to pay taxes and less any per-share 
amounts distributed from our rust account to our public stockholders in the event we are unable to complete our 
business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering and will not be liable as to any claims 
under our indemnity of the underwriters of this offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the 
Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party. Mr. Zepf 
will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. 
If we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, 
the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our 
bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the 
extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return $10.00 per 
share to our public stockholders. Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy 
petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under 
applicable debtorkralitor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a "preferential transfer- or a "fraudulent conveyance.-
As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover all amounts received by our stockholders. Furthermore, our 
boon] may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith. 
and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages. by paying public stockholders from 
the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought 
against us for these reasons. 
91 
Our public stockholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only in the event of the 
redemption of our public shares if we do not complete our business combination within 24 months from the 
closing of this offering or if they redeem their respective shares for cash upon the completion of the initial 
business combination. In no other circumstances will a stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in 
the trust account. In the event we seek stockholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, a 
stockholder's voting in connection with the business combination alone will not result in a stockholder's 
redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the trust account. Such stockholder must have also 
exercised its redemption rights described above.
