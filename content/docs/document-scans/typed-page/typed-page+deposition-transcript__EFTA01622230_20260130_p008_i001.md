Harnwell: The third-largest conservative news website is something to be extremely 
impressed by. Can you tell for the people here who aren't within the Anglosphere and 
they might not follow American domestic politics at the moment — there seems to be 
a substantial sea change going on at the moment in Middle America. And the leader of 
the majority party, Eric Cantor, was deselected a couple of weeks ago by a tea party 
candidate. What does that mean for the state of domestic politics in America at the 
moment? 
Bannon: For everybody in your audience, this is one of the most monumental — first 
off, it's the biggest election upset in the history of the American republic. Eric Cantor 
was the House majority leader and raised $10 million. He spent, between himself and 
outside groups, $8 million to hold a congressional district. He ran against a professor 
who was an evangelical Christian and a libertarian economist. He ran against a 
professor who raised in total $175,000. In fact, the bills from Eric Cantor's campaign at 
a elite steak house in Washington, DC, was over $200,000. So they spent more than 
$200,000 over the course of the campaign wining and dining fat cats at a steak house 
in Washington than the entire opposition had to run. 
Now, Eric Cantor, it was a landslide. He lost 57-43, and not one — outside of Breitbart, 
we covered this for six months, day in and day out — not one news site — not Fox 
News, not Politico, no sites picked this up. And the reason that this guy won is quite 
simple: Middle-class people and working-class people are tired of people like Eric 
Cantor who say they're conservative selling out their interests every day to crony 
capitalists. 
"That center-right revolt is really a global revolt. I think you're going to see it in Latin 
America, I think you're going to see it in Asia, I think you've already seen it in India." 
And you're seeing that whether that was UKIP and Nigel Farage in the United Kingdom, 
whether it's these groups in the Low Countries in Europe, whether it's in France, there's 
a new tea party in Germany. The theme is all the same. And the theme is middle-class 
and working-class people — they're saying, "Hey, I'm working harder than I've ever 
worked. I'm getting less benefits than I'm ever getting through this, I'm incurring less 
wealth myself, and I'm seeing a system of fat cats who say they're conservative and say 
they back capitalist principles, but all they're doing is binding with corporatists." Right? 
Corporatists, to garner all the benefits for themselves. 
And that center-right revolt is really a global revolt. I think you're going to see it in Latin 
America, I think you're going to see it in Asia, I think you've already seen it in India. 
Modi's great victory was very much based on these Reaganesque principles, so I think 
this is a global revolt, and we are very fortunate and proud to be the news site that is 
reporting that throughout the world. 
Harnwell: I think it's important to understand the distinction that you're drawing here 
between what can be understood as authentic, free-market capitalism as a means of 
promoting wealth that [unintelligible] involves everybody with a form of crony 
capitalism which simply benefits a certain class. And we've watched over the course of 
our conference, we've watched two video segments produced by the Acton Institute 
about how development aid is spent internationally and how that can be driven away 
from — it damages people on the ground but it also perpetuates a governing class. 
And the point that you're mentioning here, that I think that you're saying has driven 
almost a revolution movement in America, is the same phenomenon of what's going 
on in the developing world, which is a concept of government which is no longer doing 
what it is morally bound to do but has become corrupt and self-serving. So it's
