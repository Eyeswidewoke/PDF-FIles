Tile Revival 
A look at the secret of Iznik's colourful ceramics 
— and the author's own azure acquisition. 
By Virginia Sheridan 
It was in Istanbul that I truly became a 'blue' person, 
obsessed with the dominant colour of the vibrant Iznik 
ceramic tiles that cover the Turkish city's premiere mosques 
and sultans' palaces. 
I would sit for hours in the Sultan Ahmed 'Blue' Mosque, 
awash in a sea of 20,000 handmade azure-glazed tiles so 
radiant they seemed illuminated from within. I had to take 
a copy home with me. But the tourist markets sold only 
lacklustre, painted imitations and the antiques shops were 
curiously tile-free. Why? 
The lavish decorating style of the 16th-17th century 
Ottoman Empire sultans initially fuelled the demand for such 
exquisite craftsmanship. At the height of production some 
300 kilns and workshops in the Turkish city of Iznik were 
focused on tile work - to the exclusion of more utilitarian 
wares. When the Empire fell, so did both ceramic production 
and quality control. Even the formula for how to create the 
vital glazes vanished. The old masters kept their complicated 
production techniques a sekiet, even from their own families. 
Initially, Iznik potters were hying to create something 
that looked like porcelain to compete with the coveted blue 
and white ware imported from China at the time. They 
experimented with their native grayish-white clay, covered it 
with layers of glaze and slip (clay and water) and eventually 
infused it with radiant life/light in the form of crushed 
quartz. Almost 80% of Iznik tiles were made of this semi-
precious stone. No wonder they dazzle! 
Though the initial palette was only blue and white (and 
the designs were reinterpretations of Chinese themes), later 
experiments with manganese, iron and copper oxide yielded 
the richer palette of coral red, turquoise blue and emerald 
green that allowed for more intricate Islamic-style patterns. 
So there I was in Istanbul, husband in tow, looking for 
the rose-coloured Hagia Sofia when I began feeling - or 
rather seeing - blue, 
emanating from the 
inside of a merchant's 
shop. Lustrous Iznik-
style tiles for sale, could 
it be? Could I be arrested 
for taking one out of the 
country? 
Ten cups of tea later 
(shopping is a slow 
process in Turkey), we 
learned that the 'new' 
tiles were produced by 
the Iznik Foundation, an 
organisation set up in 
1993 by Dr. Isil Akbaygil 
with the goal of studying 
the old tile-making 
techniques and teaching 
Tile purchased by author 
them to a new generation of artisans. Through intense 
archaeological research, the Foundation discovered a kiln 
shape that allowed for successful firing of the temperamental 
glazes and created a proximate recipe of metal oxides for 
the pigments. After two years of experimentation, assistance 
from universities and scientific institutes and countless 
broken tiles, the vibrant colours emerged once again. 
Each 'modem' Iznik tile takes up to four weeks to 
complete. The resulting product is, in fact, so close to the 
original in consistency that the Iznik Foundation decided not 
to produce direct copies - lest they be sold as antiques. The 
new designs are, instead, variations on elacsic themes - a 
reverse of colours here, a blending of patterns there. 
Ten more cups of tea and we finally decided on two 
rectangular pieces with oval edges that together formed a 
strong floral vine motif - predominantly blue, of course. 
"Alt, a very interesting purchase for the gentleman," said 
the mischievous salesman. "Maybe not so lucky for the 
lady, though. Do not hang it near your bedroom," he added 
cryptically. 
In fact, we didn't hang those tiles for 10 years. At first 
we couldn't decide how to display them. Frame them and 
obscure the sides? Add hooks and damage the porous 
backs? Then we were stopped by the fear that our toddlers 
or earthquakes (we were living in Japan at the time) 
would knock them off the wall. But when we moved into a 
shophouse in Singapore and had a glaringly empty space over 
the fountain, we knew it was at last time for a tile revival. 
We drank a cup of tea admiring our 'new' addition to 
the home. "Placing it over water is perfect," I said to my 
husband. "Weren't they copies of panels outside an ablution 
fountain at Topkapi Palace?" 
"No, they were from the harem chambers," he said, 
smiling. "That's why the salesman said it was good for me, 
remember?" 
A quick Google search revealed we were both wrong. Our 
beloved panels were modelled on originals from the Topkapi 
Palace Courtyard of the Eunuch! 
No Iznik tiles are on view in Singapore's NHB museums, 
but you can see a small collection of Islamic ceramics at the 
Asian Civilisations Museum's West Asia Gallery. For more
