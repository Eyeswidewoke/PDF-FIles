Thomas More Society, which has filed lawsuits through the newly formed Amistad Project 
alleging problems with the vote in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin." 
Trump's Capitol Hill Defenders Urge Him Not To Concede. CNN (12/7, Raju, Herb, 
83.16M) reports on its website that Trump's "staunchest defenders on Capitol Hill are urging 
him not to concede even after [Bider') wins the Electoral College vote next week, calling on 
their party's leader to fight for his unsubstantiated claims of widespread election fraud all the 
way to the House floor in January. ... Asked if Trump should concede next Monday," Rep. Jim 
Jordan (R-OH) said, "No. No way, no way, no way." However, the Dallas Morning News (12/7, 
946K) reports veteran Rep. Mac Thornberry (R-TX), who is retiring, "referred Monday to 
'President-elect Biden' in a briefing call about a major defense bill pending in the House, 
becoming only the third Texas Republican in Congress" to have done so. 
PROTESTS 
Activists: Some Georgia-Related Federal Prosecutions Aim To Blunt Future Protests. 
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution (12/7, 895K) reports, "Paul Torino, a member of the Atlanta 
Anti-Repression Committee," is among the activists claiming that some Georgia-related federal 
prosecutions launched in the wake of George Floyd's death "are intended to blunt future protest 
against the government." But after five men were "arrested in June for allegedly setting an 
unoccupied Gainesville Police car on fire," FBI Special Agent in Charge Chris Hacker stated, "We 
are not focused on peaceful protests, but instead concentrating on identifying, investigating and 
disrupting those individuals who are taking advantage of the protests to incite violence and 
engage in criminal activity." 
Growing Number Of Prosecutors Join Effort To Revisit Lengthy Prison Sentences. 
The Washington Post (12/7, Jackman, 14.2M) reports on a "push to begin revisiting lengthy 
prison sentences, as part of the justice reform effort being promoted by big city prosecutors 
around the country," that is "gaining momentum even in states like Maryland, where there is no 
formal mechanism for prosecutors to revisit settled cases." The Post says Baltimore State's 
Attorney Marilyn Mosby on Monday "announced the launch of a sentencing review unit in 
Baltimore to address both mass incarceration and racial inequities in the justice system. ... Also 
Monday, the newly elected district attorney of Los Angeles, George Gascon, announced at his 
swearing-in that he, too, is launching a sentencing review unit." The Post adds similar initiatives 
are being launched by prosecutors in San Francisco, Boston, Philadelphia and Brooklyn. 
Northam Signs Virginia No-Knock Search Warrant Ban. 
USA Today (12/7, Atkinson, 10.31M) reports that with members of Breonna Taylor's family 
"there to witness," Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D) on Monday "ceremoniously signed the so-
called 'Breonna's Law' bill into Virginia's books. ... It was the second time Northam signed the 
legislation banning no-knock search warrants across Virginia - he originally approved it in late 
October." The Washington Post (12/7, Schneider, 14.2M) says the Monday ceremony "was 
designed to highlight the law as a step to address racial inequity, with Northam noting that no-
knock warrants have been found to disproportionately target Black people." 
The Richmond  (VA) Times-Dispatch (12/7, Leonor, 277K) reports two of Taylor's aunts 
"wore black shirts that read 'no more no-knocks,' and face masks with Taylor's name and photo. 
They emphasized that justice for Taylor won't be realized until the officers involved in her killing 
face criminal charges - officials in Kentucky have so far declined - but celebrated Virginia for 
being 'on the right side of this fight."
