Schmidt: Notre Dame 
American Symphony Orchestra and Collegiate Chorale 
Carnes ie Hall, New York, 27 Ma 2012 
Founded in 1962, the American Symphony Orchestra ranks as one of the most important contributors to 
the classical music scene in New York. Under the leadership of Leon Botstein, the ASO offers thematic 
series of concerts that highlight the connections between music and literature and their cultural, 
political, and historical influences. Fortunately for audiences eager to hear unusual repertoire, this 
innovative programming initiative often turns up long-forgotten titles that, despite their obscurity, 
retain rich musical value. Such was unquestionably the case when they offered the first of Franz 
Schmidt's two operas, Notre Dame, in Isaac Stern Auditorium at Carnegie Hall in March 2012. 
Schmidt was born in 1874, in the city of Pozsony, Hungary (now, Bratislava — the capital city of the 
Slovak Republic). Hungarian and German by heritage, he received his musical training in Vienna, where 
he continued to live for most of his professional life. In addition to his excellence as a composer, Schmidt 
was widely praised for his skill as an instrumentalist. He was an accomplished pianist, and gained 
prominence as a cellist while playing in the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra for many years. The 
orchestra's chief conductor — none other than Gustav Mahler - apparently insisted on having Schmidt for 
his cello soloist whenever possible. He was also a virtuoso organist; the evidence of his love for the 
instrument can be heard in his orchestral compositions, including Notre Dame. Finally, Schmidt also 
passed on his knowledge as a highly revered teacher and mentor, eventually assuming the top position 
at the Vienna Conservatory, where his pupils included a long list of distinguished musicians. 
Given the intricacy and exotic beauty of his compositions, it is tempting to seek out an explanation for 
why Schmidt's reputation has largely faded from public view. While there are a number of potential 
points for discussion — not the least of which is Schmidt's eventual acquiescence with the rise of Nazism 
in his homeland — the true reason is probably quite banal: his highly romantic musical aesthetic was 
already 'old-fashioned' by the time he was able to get Notre Dame produced on stage in 1914. His lush 
tonalities and sweeping orchestral effects were at odds with the new Viennese compositional school as 
championed by the likes of Schonberg, Berg, and Webern. Perhaps even more of an obstacle to a lasting 
legacy, Schmidt's creative years overlapped with an impressive array of brilliant composers including 
Bruckner and Brahms early on, and then later, Mahler, Reger, Pfitzner, Schreker, Zemlinsky, Strauss, and 
many others. 
With such stiff competition from the nationalist and modernist musical movements, it seems inevitable 
that — some eighty years later - Schmidt's works are seldom encountered in the concert hall and on 
stage. His grand choral opus The Book with Seven Seals has received rightful attention, but the 
remainder of his catalog remains elusive. His second opera, Fredegundis, has never received a modern 
performance or recording, to my knowledge. And so Botstein and his forces performed an important 
service by giving us the opportunity to hear the uniquely fascinating score for Notre Dame. It was an 
especially appropriate choice for the ASO since Schmidt decisively made the orchestra the star of his
