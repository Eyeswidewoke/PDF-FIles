II December 2013 
GEM Equity Strategy Outlook 2014 
CEEMEA 
South Africa - cheap currency but expensive equities 
The South African equity market is comfortably up in local currency terms over 
the year-to-date, but has fallen sharply in US dollars. The poor performance of 
the rand is mainly due to the twin fiscal and current account deficits and has 
taken the currency into deeply undervalued territory on any sort of PPP 
analysis; the problem though is that in contrast to some other weak currency 
countries, most notably India, the performance of exports has been deeply 
unimpressive. Next year could be somewhat problematic for the economy, 
especially if the independent central bank, the SARB, decides it has to raise 
interest rates to head off inflationary pressures. The best hope is probably that 
the external environment becomes more supportive with stronger growth, 
including China supporting metals prices, but with weaker oil. We believe that 
the oil price will weaken along with metals prices as growth in China slows, 
which would still be mildly supportive for South Africa. The election may 
generate some noise, but given that the outcome is as close to a foregone 
conclusion as it is possible to get in a democracy, the real interest will be in the 
composition of the post-election ANC cabinet, possibly with Cyril Ramaphosa 
as Deputy President, in which case the government may begin to implement 
the more market-friendly parts of the National Development Plan. 
We still do not have an especially strong view about the equity market going 
into 2014. The good news is that in contrast to this time last year, relative 
sector valuations appear to have become somewhat more rational following 
the underperformance of the Consumer Staples sector (Figure 64). The market 
though, despite this year's underperformance, still trades at a fairly hefty 
premium against its history relative to GEM on a price-to-book versus ROE 
basis. This premium rating reflects the superior governance and capital 
allocation for South African companies over the GEM average as well as the 
presence of a sizeable and sophisticated domestic money management 
industry. We are however somewhat concerned that the improvement in 
underlying returns as measured by CROCI relative to the rest of GEM has now 
clearly started to level out (Figure 65), which may reflect the cumulative rise in 
he costs of doing business in South Africa.
