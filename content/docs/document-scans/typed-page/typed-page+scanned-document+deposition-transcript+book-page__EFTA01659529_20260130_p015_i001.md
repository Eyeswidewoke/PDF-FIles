Politico (7/18, Dugyala, 4.29M) reports that on Twitter yesterday, President Trump "denounced Puerto Rico's 
`corrupt' leadership, writing...that `a lot of bad things are happening' in the U.S. territory whose capital has 
been choked by protests in recent days." Trump wrote, "The Governor is under siege, the Mayor of San Juan is 
a despicable and incompetent person who I wouldn't trust under any circumstance, and the United States 
Congress foolishly gave 92 Billion Dollars for hurricane relief, much of which was squandered away or 
wasted, never to be seen again." Trump continued in a tweet, "This is more than twice the amount given to 
Texas & Florida combined. I know the people of Puerto Rico well, and they are great. But much of their 
leadership is corrupt, & robbing the U.S. Government blind!" 
The Wall Street Journal (7/18, Campo-Flores, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) reports Gov. Ricardo 
Rossello is facing huge protests and calls to resign. The Washington Post (7/18, Hernandez, Stein, 14.2M)

intense, are an outgrowth of widespread indignation that has challenged his administration's already tenuous 
credibility and imperiled the distribution of needed federal aid to a territory still reeling from disaster."

allowed to fly the 737 MAX. Bloomberg says Chao's remarks at the forum "mirror what FAA acting 
Administrator Daniel Elwell has been saying in recent months."
