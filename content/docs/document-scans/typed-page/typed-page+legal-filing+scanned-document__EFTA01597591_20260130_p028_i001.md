U8S Client Relationship Aweement 
Your Privacy 
for further information, including how to 
opt out of certain information sharing. 
At UBS, we are committed to safeguarding your personal information. Please refer to the UBS 
Client Privacy Notice in the Agreements and Disclosures booklet, which describes the personal 
information we collect about you and how we handle and protect it. 
Subject to any applicable financial privacy laws and regulations, you acknowledge that we 
share such personal financial data regarding you and your Accounts with our affiliates and 
non-affiliates as is necessary or advisable to effect, administer or enforce transactions 
requested or authorized by you, or to service, process or maintain your Accounts and all 
transactions related to or in connection with your Accounts. 
Credit Report 
You grant us permission to obtain a credit report when you open an Account with us and to 
obtain updated credit or similar reports at any time during the time your Account remains 
open. You grant us permission to check and verify your credit references and update all credit 
information we have obtained on you. We may provide any such credit report or other credit 
information we have obtained on you to our Card Issuers, Check Providers or to our affiliates, 
as permitted by law to enable them to provide additional products or services that may be of 
interest to you and to otherwise assist us in servicing, administering and maintaining your 
Account and evaluating your financial needs. 
Disclosure of Beneficial Ownership 
The issuers of securities held in your Accounts may request your name, address and security 
position so that they may contact you directly for proxy voting and other shareholder 
communications. You may instruct us not to supply this information, in which case you will 
receive information regarding those securities from UBS instead of the issuers. 
Your current instructions with respect to such disclosure are reflected on the Account 
Information pages of the Completing Your Account Opening Process package. If you would 
like to change your instructions, please call your Financial Advisor. 
As described in the section 'Foreign Securities" in the General Terms and Conditions of the 
Agreement and Disdosure Booklet, we may share information about the beneficial ownership 
of foreign securities in your Accounts with the issuers of those securities, foreign government 
authorities and their agents, custodian banks or brokers and local or international securities 
depositories to obtain reduced tax withholding rates, to comply with local law or to respond to 
other lawful requests. 
Alternate Contact Person 
If you have provided UBS with an Alternate contact person, you authorize us to contact such 
person in the event that we have concerns or questions about you, including but not limited to 
your health, well-being or whereabouts. You further authorize UBS to discuss our concerns 
and disclose any necessary information about you including your Account information to your 
alternate contact. You acknowledge that this authorization will apply to all Accounts currently 
open and any account you open in the future in any capacity. 
You understand that the decision as to whether, when or if to reach out to your alternate 
contact(s) is at the sole discretion of UBS and that if you have provided multiple alternate 
contact persons, UBS is under no obligation to reach out to any or all of them. 
Electronic Records 
Any agreements accepted by facsimile or electronic means (such as clicks or other online 
means) are legally binding and are considered to have been 'signed" by you with the same 
effect as manual signatures. Electronic records of an agreement that is made online will also be 
considered to be "in writing". You agree not to dispute the validity or enforceability of any 
agreements entered into electronically by you (or by anyone using your authentication devices, 
such as a password or PIN).
