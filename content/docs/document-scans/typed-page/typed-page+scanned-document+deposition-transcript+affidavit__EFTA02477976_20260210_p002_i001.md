financial service. deal with UK visa issue sooner rather than la=er. we can talk about Rowen request re Athene , 2 billion 
tax =n transaction. ?! 
the facts as i see them<=r> in June and then again Sept, you and I agreed to 50%=f phaidon , you then after weeks 
of t=inking about the issue ( which I fully understand ) . unilaterally changed=our agreement . you were now going to 
reserve 5m for la=er?. and out of the 15m left, keep 10 for yourself.and give me=only 5. ( note : I'm confident that both 
the debt , and th= artspace investment will also lead to a wr=te off of another 30 m. plus ) When you and I sat in 
my=dining room ,you were surprised when I said that i require most peop=e to pay their advisory fee up front so that I 
am assured that=l will be properly compensated for my work when strategies that I de=ise are implemented . you 
appeared offended and said &qu=t; are you suggesting that i would go back on my word " = said no , of course not ! 
you are my closest of friends ,but my exp=rience is that when amounts get large, people tend to get unhappy wh=n it 
actually comes time for them to pay ,. 
From day zero a =50 - 60 million price was attached as the fair price of the transact=on just completed . though this 
amount was already=substantially less than the agreed formula. - 4,=A0 I was told that this was out of the range. in 
fact, a=ternative methods of payment . plane -in-kind etc, were discussed=C240 ( ie keeping the 30m portion of fee 
outstanding till Mar=h ) ,I provided as asked . a step by step execution plan and=C240 reviewed all documents that i 
was given access to. ( Phaidon was not=forthcoming ) in order to make many corrections . =Taking your , frankly silly 
position that Alans i=volvement warranted a discount even in the best of light =, though it is beyond question that not 
one-,not -one time in=three years has he ever proposed =a unique idea. (including the new tenant in common idea,) 
lets=say he made a contribution to the plan and say ,even that it was SO =. though no one could posit such a large 
amount unless they we=e wearing a brightly colored clown suit. -you , the price of d=ing the deal was known . It had 
both sent in writing and=spoken about on the phone -then a detailed execution plan was =rovided . then and only 
then after all laid out I was told tha= after a number of conversations with brad karp that only 20 was the right 
number, (and that was more tha= originally contemplated ) for both transactions . I feel It =as remarkably unfair. Did 
brad even know of our prior a=reement.? I called him and he said he was never told.?, I woul= ask that you I and Brad 
karp sit together if you=think it would be helpful.. I would like to send him this email, wi=h your consent of course. If 
the transactions were never cons=mmated , i would not be owed a dime, however , the price was known=C24, up 
front. , the detailed step by step plan was followed and overseen=by me, the price that had been fully disclosed along 
with the =ccompanying reasons for the specific amount. the final result has le=t me felling quite uneasy.
