incubation period — the time after a person catches it but before symptoms appear — can range 
from two days to two weeks or longer, though five days seems to be typical." 
Meanwhile, the AP (11/30, Webber, Hollingsworth) says Americans "faced strict new 
coronavirus measures around the country Monday as health officials brace for a disastrous 
worsening of the nationwide surge because of holiday gatherings over the long weekend." The 
AP reports Los Angeles County "imposed a stay-at-home order for its 10 million residents, and 
Santa Clara County, in the heart of Silicon Valley, banned high school, college and professional 
sports and decreed a quarantine for those who have traveled more than 150 miles outside the 
county," while the mayor of Hawaii County "said trans-Pacific travelers arriving without a 
negative COVID-19 test must quarantine for 14 days, and even those who have tested virus-
free may be randomly selected for another test upon arrival. New Jersey is suspending all youth 
sports." 
The Chicago Sun-Times (11/30, Hinton, 875K) reports that hours after speaking with 
Fauci, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker (D) "said Monday none of the state's 11 regions will get any 
break from Tier 3 coronavirus mitigations `for the next few weeks." The Chicago Tribune 
(11/30, Mahr, Petrella, Schencker, 2.65M) reports that while Illinois on Sunday "marked the 
seventh daily drop in hospitalizations in nine days, collectively amounting to a 5% decrease 
from a high of 6,175 on Nov. 20," Pritzker warned that the state is "still very much in a 
precarious place." Pritzker continued, "We have got to take the time to evaluate any 
Thanksgiving effect before we make any premature adjustments." 
In addition, the Cleveland Plain Dealer (11/30, Hancock, 895K) says Ohio hospitals "are 
showing signs they're running out of equipment and space." The Plain-Dealer adds that "at least 
one hospital in Ohio borrowed a refrigerated truck to store bodies of patients who have died. 
But it's not just hospitals that are showing signs of stress. It's the people who work inside 
them, too." However, The Hill (11/30, Seipel, 2.98M) reports state Rep. John Becker (R) "led a 
group [of] fellow GOP representatives...in filing 12 articles of impeachment against" Gov. Mike 
DeWine (R) over his coronavirus restrictions, "calling it an `effort to restore the rule of law.'" 
The lawmakers "claim DeWine's administration implemented unconstitutional orders in response 
to the pandemic." 
Newsom Warns Of Wider California Stay-At-Home Order. 
Reuters (11/30, Chiacu) reports California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) on Monday "said he may 
clamp new `stay-at-home' orders on California's roughly 40 million residents in the face of 
infections and hospitalizations that are still rising weeks before emergency vaccines are 
predicted for release." The Los Angeles Times (11/30, Lin, 4.64M) reports nearly "75% of the 
state's 7,733 ICU beds are occupied - with 1,812 of them filled by coronavirus patients," and 
Newsom said, "If these trends continue, we're going to have to take much more dramatic -
arguably drastic - actions," which "include `the potential for a stay-at-home order' for areas in 
the strictest purple tier of California's coronavirus reopening road map, he said." 
According to the AP (11/30, Thompson), "The biggest concern is intensive care cases, 
which have increased 67% in the past two weeks," and "if that continues, it would push ICU 
beds to 112% of capacity by mid-December." This "statistic is likely to drive decisions over 
whether to impose state-mandated stay-at-home orders in 51 of California's 58 counties that 
already are seeing the most restrictions on business activities," said California Health and 
Human Services Secretary Mark Ghaly, who added, "Bottom line is we are looking at intensive 
care unit capacity as the primary trigger for deeper, more restrictive actions." 
Reuters (11/30, Bernstein) reports Newsom last week "instituted a curfew barring social 
gatherings and other non-essential activities across most of the state between 10 p.m. and 5 
a.m. daily." The curfew along with other restrictions "already represent some of the most 
stringent COVID-19 public health measures in effect nationwide." 
The Orange County (CA Register (11/30, Wheeler, 546K) reports, "Hospitalizations again 
are top of mind as new COVID-19 cases contracted over Thanksgiving are recorded and about
