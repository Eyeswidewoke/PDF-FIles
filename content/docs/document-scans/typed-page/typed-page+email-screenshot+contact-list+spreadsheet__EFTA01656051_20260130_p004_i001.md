Trump to Plead Not Guilty to Charges in Revised U.S. Indictment 
Reuters (09/03, Staff Writer) reported that former U.S. President Donald Trump, in a court filing, stated his 
intention to plead not guilty to revised criminal charges accusing him of attempting to overturn the 2020 election 
results. According to the article, the revised indictment, obtained by Special Counsel Jack Smith, maintains the 
same four charges from the previous indictment, including attempting to defraud the United States, obstruct 
congressional certification of the election, and deprive voters of their right to a fair vote. The new indictment 
dropped and reframed certain allegations after the U.S. Supreme Court determined that Trump has broad 
immunity from criminal prosecution over official actions he took as president. The article noted that while Trump 
waived his right to appear in court for this plea, a court appearance for Trump's lawyers and prosecutors is 
scheduled for Thursday to determine the next steps following a Supreme Court ruling on presidential 
immunity. Additional reporting on the story was provided by Fox News (09/03, Vacchiano, Spunt, Betz), CNN

Federal Judge Rejects Donald Trump's Request to Intervene in Wake of Hush Money Conviction 
The Associated Press (09/03, Sisak) reported that U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein rejected Donald Trump's 
request to move his New York hush money criminal case to federal court, blocking Trump's attempt to overturn his 
conviction following a Supreme Court ruling on presidential immunity. According to the article, Judge Hellerstein 
stated that the hush money payments central to the case were personal actions, not official acts covered by the 
Supreme Court ruling and that Trump's legal team had not demonstrated sufficient grounds for changing 
jurisdiction. The article noted that while Trump's lawyers plan to appeal the decision, Judge Juan M. Merchan, who 
presided over the state trial, is expected to rule soon on delaying Trump's sentencing, currently scheduled for 
September 18th, and on Trump's request to overturn the conviction based on the Supreme Court ruling. Additional
