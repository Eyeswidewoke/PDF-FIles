FX Blueprint: Thin end of the wedge 
Theme #9: Pole dances, TRY tr€ps 
• 
Go long PLN and HUF, buoyed by competitive 
REERs and proximity to strong German demand, 
and stay short TRY, as reserves are insufficient to 
act as a buffer and where external deficits require 
further adjustment to restore competitiveness 
Aggregated EMEA FX correlation (3m rolling correlation 
of daily changes) have dropped to levels only seen once 
post-crisis (prior to the Fed opening the door to 
tapering last May). The stand-out underperformer is 
TRY, undermined by risk spreads on both sovereign 
and corporate bonds having widened on domestic 
political instability that has already claimed the jobs of 
a few ministers. At the other end we have ILS and PLN 
outperformance, but HUF has also has performed 
reasonably well, largely unchanged vs the USD over the 
past month. More divergence with idiosyncratic factors 
playing a greater role is something we have argued for 
some time, and although disrupted by the 'taper 
tantrum' in O2/Q3 2013 in particular, the trend is intact. 
With the Fed pushing fewer (but still a lot) of dollars 
into the global economy, it still makes sense to avoid 
currencies with large C/A deficits, and/or those where 
indebtedness has risen substantially (be that public 
and/or private). However, in economies where FX 
weakness in 2013 was more a function of weak 
growth/policy rate cuts, higher yields should not be 
damaging as long as the rise in yields is orderly and 
reflects improved growth prospects. Export oriented 
economies with competitive real exchange rates and 
limited balance sheet risk should benefit from a 
sustained global recovery. 
In EMEA this is likely to translate into more divergence 
between PLN & HUF (benefitting from relatively 
competitive REERs, a strong German economy and 
export led recoveries), and the ILS (where the BoP 
effect will maintain appreciation pressures) on the one 
hand, and on the other CZK (sustained CNB 
intervention) plus TRY & ZAR (vulnerable to a 
tightening of global liquidity on insufficient FX reserves). 
The Russian RUB meanwhile, will be stuck somewhere 
in between, supported by low balance sheet risk and 
attractive carry but undermined by the threat of lower 
oil prices and the lack of credible reforms. 
From red• hot to stone cold 
Growth is picking up. Poland will benefit not only from 
strong German demand but also a healthy banking 
system, with domestic credit now grinding higher. Any 
sign of demand-led inflation will make the NBP 
uncomfortable so Poland is likely to be one of the front-
runners in this tightening cycle. Also, longer-term 
valuation points to 'fair-value' around 3.80, suggesting 
that in an environment of stronger demand the Bank is 
unlikely to be sensitive to zloty appreciation. Go long 
PLN vs EUR, target 395 with a stop @ 430.
