Hillary Clinton ally who was hoping to fuel the collusion narrative and had his own contacts with 
Christopher Steele." 
Op-Ed: A Steeley Media Silence. In an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal (7/28, 
Subscription Publication, 7.57M), Holman W. Jenkins, Jr. writes about the release of the key 
sub-source in the Steele dossier and the unwillingness of mainstream media to provide 
adequate coverage. The source was Russian Igor Danchenko, who studied at Louisville and 
Georgetown, and worked as a business and political writer, including at Brookings. He 
complained that media sources virtually universally ignored the new revelation despite the 
extreme public attention the story has received during the past three years. He argues there is 
something wrong with US journalism. 
Valerie Jarrett Pressed On Obama's Role In Russia Probe. 
Fox News (7/28, Schultz, 27.59M) reports Fox Business Network anchor Maria Bartiromo 
"pressed a top aide to President Obama about what the former president knew about the 
launch of the Russia probe into President Trump's 2016 campaign." In an interview Tuesday, 
Bartiromo "asked Valerie Jarrett whether Obama 'directed' the probe into Trump campaign ties 
to Russia, which eventually sparked the Mueller investigation." Jarrett, former Obama senior 
adviser, said, "That's not how it works. That's not how our investigations work. We leave that to 
the intelligence community to bring forward information. And the dossier - I would imagine 
would be one piece of a much bigger puzzle." 
Eisen Says In New Book Mueller Refused To Admit Trump Committed "At Least Five 
Chargeable Crimes." 
The Washington Examiner (7/28, Chaitin, 448K) reports special counsel Robert Mueller "refused 
to admit President Trump committed at least five crimes," according to a top lawyer for the 
House Judiciary Committee during the impeachment fight. Norm Eisen, a former Obama adviser 
and US ambassador, "criticizes Mueller in his new book, 'A Case for the American People: The 
United States v. Donald J. Trump,' chastising the former FBI director for failing to go 'all the 
way' with his obstruction of justice inquiry and letting the country down." Eisen wrote, "The 
refusal to admit there were at least five chargeable crimes was his shortcoming, not his lack of 
style. I understood his old-fashioned restraint under the special counsel regulations and typical 
prosecutorial standards. But he had leeway under the rules to do much, much more, and he 
didn't." 
US Seeks To Dismiss Charges Against Ex-Twitter Employees Accused Of Spying For 
Saudi Arabia. 
The Verge (7/28, Statt, 2.05M) reports, "Two former Twitter employees who were last fall 
charged with spying on behalf of the government of Saudi Arabia may have charges against 
them dropped at the recommendation of US prosecutors." The Verge adds, "It is unclear at this 
time why the US is pushing to have the case against the two men, Ahmad Abouammo and Ali 
Alzabarah, dismissed," but "lawyers in San Francisco submitted the recommendation to a judge 
on Tuesday. It has yet to be approved. A third man, a Saudi citizen named Ahmed Almutairi, 
was also implicated in the operation as the recruiter who convinced Abouammo and Alzabarah 
to spy on Saudi dissidents using internal Twitter tools. Prosecutors are also recommending 
charges against him be dropped." 
Lawmakers Aim To Deny Visas To Chinese Spies And Their Families. 
The Washington Examiner (7/28, Dunleavy, 448K) reports, "Republicans in the House and 
Senate are pushing legislation aimed at denying visas to foreigners who have engaged in 
espionage or intellectual property theft against the United States." Rep. Vicky Hartzler (R-MO) 
and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) "announced the Protecting America from Spies Act on Tuesday with a 
particular focus on China, a country against which the Trump administration is turning up the
