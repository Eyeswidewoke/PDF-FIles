has 56.9% of the total, while Biden has 39.1%. 
Arizona AG Says He Has Found No Evidence Of Widespread Fraud. Bloomberg
(11/11, Beckwith, 4.73M) reports Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich (R) said Wednesday 
that he has "found no evidence of widespread voter fraud. ... Brnovich told Fox Business News 
that it was 'highly unlikely' that Trump would catch up as remaining ballots are counted." The 
Arizona Republic (11/11, 869K) reports Brnovich "also addressed an ongoing lawsuit, filed on 
behalf of Trump's reelection team, that alleges poll workers 'incorrectly rejected' votes cast in 
person on Election Day." Brnovich said, "We are literally talking about less than 200 votes that 
are in question. Even if it was possible that those votes flip, those 200 votes, I do not think it 
will make a difference in Arizona, just because of the number." 
Fox News (11/11, Musto, 27.59M) reports on its website that Arizona Superior Court 
Judge Daniel Kiley "has denied a request by President Trump's reelection team to seal evidence 
in a lawsuit alleging poll workers in Maricopa County 'incorrectly rejected' Election Day votes." 
Georgia To Do Full Hand Tally Of Votes. The AP (11/11, Brumback) reports Georgia 
Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger (R) has announced "an audit of presidential election 
results that he said would be done with a full hand tally of ballots because the margin is so 
tight." Raffensperger said at a news conference, "It will be a heavy lift, but we will work with 
the counties to get this done in time for our state certification. We have all worked hard to bring 
fair and accurate counts to assure that the will of the voters is reflected in the final count and 
that every voter will have confidence in the outcome, whether their candidate won or lost." The 
Wall Street Journal (11/11, McWhirter, Wise, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) says 
Raffensperger said that state law requires him to certify the election results by November 20. 
Biden currently leads Trump by about 14,000 votes in the state. 
Steve Osunsami said on ABC World News TonightVi (11/11, story 5, 1:35, Muir, 6.94M) 
that Raffensperger "still says that the election here was fair, but he's been feeling the blowtorch 
from others in his party, and is now agreeing to give Trump supporters an audit of the vote for 
president. ... The President's people have been claiming without evidence that there was 
significant voter fraud." Reuters (11/11, Lambert) reports Raffensperger told CNN that he has 
"ordered a hand recount because of the closeness of the vote count, but he believed votes had 
so far been tallied accurately. Biden's current lead, with nearly all votes counted, is 0.3%." 
USA Today (11/11, McCord, 10.31M) reports, "While no claims of vote fraud or election 
mismanagement have been substantiated, Raffensperger's announcement came the day after 
Georgia's two U.S. senators demanded his resignation. Raffensperger is a Republican, as are 
Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, who each landed in Jan. 5 runoffs after neither received 
a majority of votes last week." Both the New York Times (11/11, Fausset, Saul, 18.61M) and 
the Washington Post (11/11, Thebault, Gardner, 14.2M) profile Raffensperger, now a target of a 
party he says he has supported since he was a teenager. 
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution (11/11, 895K) reports, "Georgia's recount process in 
recent decades has been carried out by reprocessing computer-counted votes. And with the 
vote margin in the presidential race favoring [Biden) by just over 14,000, most local election 
supervisors had been expecting a statewide computer recount. That would have involved 
feeding ballots into optical scanners and running the tabulators again, a much faster and less 
labor-intensive process. Most local election officials have never faced a hand recount on this 
scale." 
Michigan AG Says Trump Campaign Unfairly Attacking Black Voters. The Detroit 
Free Press (11/11, 1.52M) reports Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel (D) "blasted the 
legal efforts" of Trump's team on Wednesday, "saying they include no evidence of misconduct, 
unfairly attack Black voters and workers in Detroit and will not change the outcome of the 
election." Nessel said on a call with reporters, "Really the themes that we see, that persist, are 
this: Black people are corrupt, Black people are incompetent, and Black people can't be trusted. 
That's the narrative that is continually espoused by the Trump campaign and their allies in 
these lawsuits."
