Important information 
The asset allocations described herein are formulated by the Regional Investment Committee (RIC) within Deutsche Bank Wealth Management (Deutsche Bank WM) and may 
utilize the following asset class components: U.S. large cap equity, U.S. small cap equity, Europe equity. Japan equity, Pacific ex-Japan equity, emerging markets equity, municipal 
bonds, U.S. high-yield bonds, Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, emerging market debt hedge funds, commodities, and cash. RIC currently recognizes four basic investment 
strategies: Income, Growth 8. Income. Growth, and Maximum Growth. The strategy selected is based upon the individual investors objectives and risk tolerance. Your selected 
portfolio will determine the specific allocation to the asset classes represented by the vehicles described herein. Please note returns for the large cap equity portion are represented 
by the Quality Growth Composite. Implementation vehicles and asset allocations are determined by the Deutsche Bank WM RIC and are change subject at their discretion. 
Results presented herein do not represent the results of actual trading using client assets. The returns shown in this document are model returns and do not reflect Deutsche Bank 
management fees or other expenses that may be incurred in the actual management of an account If such fees and expenses were deducted, the results would be lower. Please 
be advised of the limitations inherent in using model results. Accounts managed according to the Model may perform differently over the same time period depending on the size of 
the account restrictions, the amount of the transaction and related costs, the inception date of the account and other factors. Actual clients may experience returns that are more or 
less than those of the Model. These model retums do not reflect the impact that material economic factors may have had on our decision-making. Model retums are not indicative 
of future results: there is always the potential for loss as well as for profit These returns should not be considered indicative of the skill of the advisor. 
The CIO Strategy model portfolios commenced on 1/1/05. The model retums reflected herein were achieved by calculating monthly weighted-average returns using actual tactical 
allocations and vehicles beginning 1/01/05. The model retums presented are used to portray what the CIO Strategies performance would have been during the period if client 
assets had been invested in these CIO Strategies securities recommendations. Deutsche Bank will continue to employ tactical strategy allocation and rebalancing techniques and 
therefore the portfolio allocation will change dynamically as market conditions warrant. Please refer to the CIO Strategies marketing information for a description of the methodology 
used to select investments. 
The standard fee schedule generally applied to accounts invested in this strategy is as follows: 1.20% on the first $2 million; 0.85% on the next $3 million; 0.60% on the next $5 
million; and 0.45% on the balance. Actual investment advisory fees incurred by clients may vary. 
Blended benchmarks are comprised of indices representing the broad asset classes utilized by the RIC. Blended benchmark returns are calculated and rebalanced monthly. A 
current list of the allocation weights and components in the blended benchmark can be found below. A complete list of historical allocation weights and components is available 
upon request.
