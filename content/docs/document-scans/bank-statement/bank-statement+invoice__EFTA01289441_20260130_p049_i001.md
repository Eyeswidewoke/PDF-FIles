Noncovered under the cost basis rules as defined below. 
Generally, securities acquired before 2011, in retirement accounts or held by Non-U.S. entities are not subject to the cost basis reporting rules set forth in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as 
amended by the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 20 0 8, and are marked as "noncovered" Securities marked as "covered', were identified as securities potentially subject to the cost 
basis reporting rules and may be reported to the IRS on form 1099-B for the applicable tax year in which the securities are disposed. 
Note: In the event where we cannot easily determine the taxability of an account, we may mark the account as noncovered. However, if the account does not receive a 10998, the cost basis 
will not be reported to the IRS. 
This Schedule may not reflect all cost basis adjustments necessary for tax reporting purposes, especially for noncovered securities. Adjustments to cost basis may have been made for prior 
income received and subsequently reclassified by the issuer as a return of capital. In addition, corporate action events may require adjustments to your original cost basis. Return of capital 
information and cost basis information, as it relates to corporate actions, has been obtained from sources we believe to be reliable. 
Adjustments to cost basis can be made after year-end, in particular, for return of capital adjustments, but may also include adjustments for corporate action events. Therefore there may be 
differences in cost basis reflected on your monthly client brokerage statement at year end versus any subsequent reports, including your 1099-B or online displays you may have available to 
you. 
When you report your cost basis on your tax return, it should be verified using all of your own records. In particular, there may be other adjustments which you need to make, but are not 
required to be made by Pershing as it relates to H.R. 14 24. You should consult with your tax advisor in order to properly report your gain or loss for tax purposes. Pershing shall not be 
responsible for and makes no representations or warranties with respect to the accuracy of any information that you report to the IRS or other taxing authorities, and, accordingly, disclaims 
any and all liability that may arise with respect to your use and reliance on the information provided herein for such reporting. 
Cost Basis on fixed income securities may be adjusted for amortization, accretion, original issue discount adjustments, or principal paydowns. The calculation is based upon the taxpayer 
election, type of fixed income security, and certain attributes, obtained from sources believed to be reliable. In the event, one or more of these attributes is changed, there may be a temporary 
incorrect adjusted cost basis reflected until the cost basis system is amended to reflect this change. These calculations will not be performed under certain circumstances, including those 
involving foreign bonds, bonds sold short or bonds issued with less than one year to maturity. This information is meant as a general guide and you should consult your tax advisor in the 
preparation of your tax returns.
