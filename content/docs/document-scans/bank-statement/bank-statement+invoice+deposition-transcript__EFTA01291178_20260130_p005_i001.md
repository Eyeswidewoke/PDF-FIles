fund. Shares of a money market mutual fund or the balance of a bank deposit product held in your brokerage account may be liquidated upon request with the proceeds 
credited to your brokerage account. Please seethe money market mutual fund's prospectus or the bank deposit product's disclosure document or contact your advisor for 
additional information. Pursuant to SEC Rule 10b-10(b)(1) confirmations are not sent for purchases into money market mutual funds processed on the sweep platform. 
The U.S. adopted a shortened settlement timeframe beginning with trade date September 5,2017, for equities, corporate and municipal bonds, and unit investment trusts. Moving 
from a T+3 to a T+2 settlement cycle provides faster access to sale proceeds, but it also means that funds are due on purchase transactions earlier. This may be a good time to 
consider e-delivery of your account documents-including trade confirmations, account statements and more. Ask your advisor or financial institution about how you can set up 
e-delivery.
