Pricing 
This section includes the net market value of the securities in your account on a settlement date basis, including short positions. at the close of the statement period The market 
prices, unless otherwise noted, have been obtained from independent vendor services, which we believe to be reliable. Market prices do not constitute a bid or an offer, and may differ 
from the actual sale price. Securities for which a price is not available are marked "Ni A" and are omitted from the Total.

Estimated Annual Figures 
The estimated annual income (EAI) and estimated annual yield (EAY) figures are estimates and for informational purposes only. These figures are not considered to be a forecast or 
guarantee of future results. These figures are computed using information from providers believed to be reliable: however, no assurance can be made as to the accuracy. Since interest 
and dividend rates are subject to change at any time, and may be affected by current and future economic, political. and business conditions, they should not be relied on for making 
investment, trading, or tax decisions. These figures assume that the position quantities, interest and dividend rates, and prices remain constant. A capital gain or return of principal 
may be included in the figures for certain securities, thereby overstating them. Refer to www.pershing.coml disclosures for specific details as to formulas used to calculate the figures. 
Accrued interest represents interest earned but not yet received. 
Foreign Currency Transactions 
Pershing will execute foreign currency transactions as principal for your account. Pershing may automatically convert foreign currency to or from U.S. dollars for dividends and similar 
corporate action transactions unless you instruct your financial organization otherwise. Pershing's currency conversion rate will not exceed the highest interbank conversion rate 
identified from customary banking sources on the conversion date or the prior business day, increased by up to 196, unless a particular rate is required by applicable law. Your financial 
organization may also increase the currency conversion rate. This conversion rate may differ from rates in effect on the date you executed a transaction, incurred a charge, or 
received a credit. Transactions converted by agents (such as depositories) will be billed at the rates such agents use.
