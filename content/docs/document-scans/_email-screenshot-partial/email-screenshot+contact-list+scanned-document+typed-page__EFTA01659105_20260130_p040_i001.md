COVID-19 Battle. 
Reuters (11/23, Blenkinsop) reports, "The European Union, Canada and 11 other countries 
agreed on Monday to measures such as eliminating export curbs they believe should form the

Afghan Youths Escape Reality In Violent Video Game With "Cultlike Following." 
The New York Times (11/23, Gibbons-Neff, Faizi, 18.61M) reports on the "cultlike following" of 
the video game PlayerUnknown Battlegrounds (PUBG), which is "becoming widely played across 
Afghanistan, almost as an escape from reality as the 19-year-old war grinds on." Afghan 
lawmakers "are trying to ban PUBG, arguing that it promotes violence and distracts the young 
from their schoolwork," though players know they can easily circumvent any bans with software 
on their phones. Twenty-three-year-old Mohammad Ali "sees PUBG as an escape," saying, "I get 
so busy with the game I forget about the world. ... It distracts me from the city, the attacks, 
the robberies, the thieves and the crime." 
G-20 Meeting Demonstrates Relief From Leaders At Prospect Of Biden Presidency. 
Bloomberg (11/23, Follain, Nereim, Delfs, Nardelli, 4.73M) reports that the "picture that 
emerged from two days of international diplomacy reduced to a form of Zoom meeting" at this 
year's G-20 meeting "is that many leaders are relieved to have Joe Biden take over as US 
president, though they think four years of 'America First' cannot be easily undone, according to 
officials present." Even "in these anti-climatic circumstances, where officials couldn't mingle, it 
was clear there was a different vibe." One official "described it like a breath of fresh air," and 
another "noted that after years of obstructionism, the US delegation seemed more engaged, 
and that the final summit statement was stronger than many in recent years."

WPost: EU Facing Challenge To Democracy With Hungary, Poland Budget Block. 
In an editorial, the Washington Post (11/23, 14.2M) says it is "essential" that European Union 
leaders "not give in" to Hungary and Poland, "which under nationalist populist governments 
have been drifting steadily toward autocracy." This fall, the European Parliament "hit on the 
solution of linking funding in the bloc's new $2.1 trillion budget to respect for the rule of law," 
but Hungary and Poland "have responded by blocking the budget's adoption, which requires a 
unanimous vote - and thereby threatening critical funding not only for themselves but also for 
other nations hard-hit by the covid-19 pandemic." The "continued impasse could exacerbate
