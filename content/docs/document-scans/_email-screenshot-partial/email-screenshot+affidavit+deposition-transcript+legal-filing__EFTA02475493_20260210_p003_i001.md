was never told.?, I would ask t=at you I and Brad karp sit together if you think it would=be helpful.. I would like to send 
him this email, with your consent=of course. If the transactions were never consummated , i wou=d not be owed a 
dime, however , the expected fee was known =AO up front. , the detailed step by step plan was followed and overseen 
by=me, the amount that I had requested before the transacti=n was even begun, and had already been heavily 
discounted, out=of friendship, from our agreement . I believe the decision re only p=ying 20 m has frankly , left me 
felling quite unea=y.
