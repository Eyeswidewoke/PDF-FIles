New York Fraud Investigations Said To Include Trump Tax Write-Offs. 
The New York Times (11/19, Hakim, McIntire, Rashbaum, Protess, 18.61M) reports, "Two 
separate New York State fraud investigations into President Trump and his businesses, one 
criminal and one civil, have expanded to include tax write-offs on millions of dollars in 
consulting fees, some of which appear to have gone to Ivanka Trump, according to people with 
knowledge of the matter." The Times says subpoenas issued to the Trump Organization "for 
records related to the fees" highlight "the legal challenges awaiting the president when he 
leaves office in January." Trump Organization general counsel Alan Garten called it "the latest 
fishing expedition in an ongoing attempt to harass the company." 
Politico (11/19, Choi, 4.29M) reports, "Ivanka Trump on Thursday called New York state 
investigations into her father's business dealings `harassment," in comments "seeming to 
confirm that the probes now include tax write-offs that appear to involve her." Ivanka Trump 
tweeted, "This `inquiry' by NYC democrats is 100% motivated by politics, publicity and rage. 
They know very well that there's nothing here and that there was no tax benefit whatsoever. 
These politicians are simply ruthless." Politico says the post "could signal the family's coming 
defense against mounting inquiries by state authorities."
