of Israel." The article noted that Hnaihen was arrested following a multi-agency investigation on July 11 on local 
charges after another warning letter was discovered at an industrial propane gas distribution depot in Orlando, 
officials said. Fox News (08/15, Wallace) quoted a statement from Director Wray: "Under the guise of expressing his 
beliefs, the defendant allegedly attacked a power facility and threatened local businesses, causing hundreds of 
thousands of dollars in damages. Violence and destruction of property to threaten and intimidate others will never 
be tolerated. The FBI and our partners will work together to pursue and hold accountable those who resort to 
violence." The article also quoted U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland: "We allege that the defendant 
threatened to carry out hate-fueled mass violence in our country, motivated in part by a desire to target 
businesses for their perceived support of Israel. Such acts and threats of violence, whether they are targeting the 
places that Americans frequent every day or our country's critical infrastructure, are extremely dangerous and will 
not be tolerated by the Justice Department." Additional reporting on the story was provided by Reuters (08/15,

Continued Reporting: Trump Assassination Attempt 
Secret Service Beefs up Security for Trump, Including With Bulletproof Glass 
CNN (08/15, Lybrand) reported that the Secret Service has initiated enhancements to Donald Trump's security, 
planning to incorporate bulletproof glass at his campaign rallies. According to the article, these measures, 
prompted by an assassination attempt at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, include an increased number of agents and 
the implementation of new technological strategies. The article noted that the logistics of positioning ballistic glass 
across anticipated rally sites are complex, with a dedicated team handling the preparations for events leading up to 
the November 2024 presidential election. An editorial from the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette (08/15, Editorial) assessed 
that the Secret Service demonstrated significant incompetence in handling security for former President Trump, 
which almost resulted in a catastrophic event. The author emphasized the need for profound reforms and greater 
transparency within the agency to restore public trust and ensure such failures are not repeated. Additional 
reporting on the story was provided by Reuters (08/15, Singh, Ward, Ljunggren), CBS News (08/15, Sganga),

FBI Probed for Info on Alleged Iranian Agent's Assassination Plot Targeting Trump 
Fox News (08/15, Johnson) reported that bipartisan senators are seeking explanations from Director Wray and DHS 
Secretary Mayorkas about an alleged Iranian agent, Asif Merchant, charged with plotting to assassinate a U.S. 
official, potentially former President Trump. According to the article, the FBI monitored Merchant before allowing 
him into the U.S. to gather sufficient evidence for his arrest, raising questions about the timing and communication 
of his entry and intentions. The article noted that senators have requested further details on the FBI's and DHS's 
knowledge of Merchant's plot and its possible connections to a recent assassination attempt against Trump, with 
the FBI confirming receipt of these inquiries but declining to comment further. "This dangerous murder-for-hire 
plot exposed in today's charges allegedly was orchestrated by a Pakistani national with close ties to Iran and is 
straight out of the Iranian playbook," Director Wray said in the press release. "A foreign-directed plot to kill a public 
official, or any U.S. citizen, is a threat to our national security and will be met with the full might and resources of 
the FBI."
