The Washington Times (07/21, Picket) reported that Donald Trump posted an AI-generated video on social media 
showing former President Barack Obama being arrested by FBI agents in the Oval Office. According to the article, 
the video was part of a series of posts related to newly declassified records accusing top Obama administration 
officials of conspiring against Trump in 2016. The article noted that DNI Tulsi Gabbard claims the Obama 
administration manufactured a bogus intelligence report about Russian interference, and is referring the 
documents to the Department of Justice for a criminal referral. The article highlighted that intelligence officials 
concluded that Russia did interfere with the election by hacking into the Democratic National Committee's 
computer network and the personal emails of John Podesta, Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman. Special counsel 
Robert S. Mueller's $32 million 2019 report into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election also 
concluded that Moscow "interfered in the 2016 presidential election in sweeping and systematic fashion." A 
Republican-led Senate investigation in 2020 also said the "committee found no reason to dispute the intelligence 
community's conclusions." The Mueller report also found that investigators "did not establish that the Trump 
Campaign coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities." Additional reporting on 
the story was provided by New York Times (07/21, Bigg), The Daily Beast (07/21, Harvey), NewsNation (07/21, 
Noury), The Hill (07/21, Waldvogel), Newsweek (07/21, Stanton), Rolling Stone (07/21, Ramirez, Suebsaeng), Time
