SIGNIFICANT NEWS EVENTS 
Director Patel Says Epstein Estate Refuses to Share Key Records With the FBI 
Newsweek (11/25, Gooding, Whisnant) reported that Director Patel said this week in an interview with journalist Catherine Herridge that Jeffrey 
Epstein's estate is refusing to share key records sought by investigators. He said the government and the estate hold "separate boxes" of 
information, limiting what the FBI can access as it reviews a new referral in the case. Director Patel noted that federal officials have repeatedly 
requested materials from the estate without success. He said the FBI will evaluate whatever evidence it can obtain as the inquiry moves forward. 
"Based on the new referral, we'll take a look at that and see what evidence comes, but there's an important distinction. The information that the 
government possesses versus the information that the Epstein estate possesses, those are two separate boxes of information and the Epstein 
estate has not been willing to share information with the US. government..and so even though we've requested them to do so," Director Patel 
stated. Bloomberg (11/25, Leopold) reported that the FBI has released dozens of emails related to the review and redaction of Jeffrey Epstein 
files, which were obtained through a FOIA request by Jason Leopold. The emails reveal that FBI personnel underwent special training for the 
"Epstein Transparency Project" and worked extensive hours, including nights and weekends, with the FBI paying $851,344 in overtime between 
March 17 and March 22. The article noted that the FBI reviewed and redacted a large volume of documents and videos, including "search warrant 
execution photos", "street surveillance video", and "aerial footage from FBI search warrant execution", with over 161 pages withheld due to 
ongoing law enforcement proceedings and other FOIA exemptions. Additional reporting on the story was provided by ABC News (11/25, Barr), 
Raw Story (11/25, Charky.Chami) (2), and Telegraph (11/25, Coen). 
Drug Arrests and Gun Seizures Fell as Homeland Security Pursued Immigration 
The New York Times (11/25, Aleaziz, Nehamas, et al.) reported that narcotics arrests by Homeland Security special agents fell by 11% and 
weapon seizures dropped by 73% due to a shift in priorities to focus on immigration enforcement. According to the article, the shift in priorities 
has hindered investigations into major crimes, including child exploitation and terrorism financing, with a 28% drop in indictments for child 
exploitation crimes and a 17% drop in the number of child victims identified or rescued. The article highlighted that the FBI also devoted 
resources to the immigration crackdown. In a statement to The Independent (11/25, Woodward), Homeland Security assistant secretary Tricia 
McLaughlin accused The New York Times of "peddling a false narrative" about HSI's report and touted an increase in arrests for human smuggling 
and the seizure of more than 2.5 million pounds of narcotics. "The facts are child exploitation, human trafficking, terrorism, financial scams, and 
smuggling all have a nexus to illegal immigration," she said. "Nearly every day, DHS law enforcement — including HSI — are arresting pedophiles,
