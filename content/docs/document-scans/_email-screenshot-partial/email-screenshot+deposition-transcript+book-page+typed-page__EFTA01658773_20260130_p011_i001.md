undercover operative in Europe and the United States between 1969 and 2001, a period that 
included the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union." The Kremlin "announced his death at the age 
of 82 last Friday," and revealed details of his life. The spy "pilfered about 300 volumes of top-
secret information from NATO," and was "assigned to control espionage operations in the West, 
involving presidential administrations, the CIA, FBI, State Department and NATO headquarters." 
Former Marine Imprisoned In Russian Prison Camp Interviewed By ABC. 
Former US Marine Paul Whelan spoke with ABC News (11/11, Reevell, 2.97M) "from prison, 
where he's serving a 16-year sentence on charges his family and U.S. officials say were 
fabricated in order to seize him as a political hostage." The interview is the "first time he's 
spoken extensively to a journalist since his arrest in Moscow in late December 2018." The 
former Marine "was detained and accused of espionage," and now "lives in a barracks at 
Correctional Colony-17, a crumbling former Gulag camp, originally built to hold prisoners during 
World War II." He said his cell mates know "that it's complete crap, and they laugh and say, 
'Well, yeah, this is what the FSB does. It's obviously political."

The Joint Terrorism Task Force arrested Maiorana "in an early morning raid Tuesday...at his 
house in Staten Island," and he was later charged "with making threatening interstate 
communications."

called for violence against our entire community — protestors, politicians, and law enforcement 
officers alike. His alleged threats are disturbing and far outside of acceptable norms, but they 
also violated federal law,' FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge William Sweeney said in a 
statement." 
The Hill (11/10, Axelrod, 2.98M) reports, "Prosecutors said Maiorana had made 
threatening comments online since September, saying he would kill protesters, lawmakers and
