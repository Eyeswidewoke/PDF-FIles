many House Republicans criticized and fought to prevent. The General Services Administration last year selected 
Maryland over Virginia as the site of the new FBI headquarters following a battle between the states over where to 
build the new facility. GOP lawmakers took issue over providing the bureau with a new headquarters, pointing to 
the FBI's politically contentious probes towards conservatives. The Daily Wire (06/03, Chaitin), Fox News (06/03, 
Singman), Newsweek (06/03, Lewis), and Axios (06/03, Habeshian) also reported on the story. 
Massachusetts in Bottom Half of Country When It Comes to LGBTQ+ Safety, Study Shows 
CBS News (06/03, Hager) reported that in a new study, Safehome.org puts Massachusetts at number 28 in the 
country when it comes to the safety of the LGBTQ+ community. The article added that the group's study showed 
Rhode Island and New Hampshire rank the safest at numbers one and two. In fact, all the New England states rank 
safer than Massachusetts when it comes to protecting people from crimes related to gender identity and sexual 
orientation. The article mentioned that the FBI's most recent data show that Massachusetts logged 111 LGBTQ+ 
hate crimes in 2022. Just this past weekend in Carlisle, someone stole the rainbow flags from a special pride 
display. 
Trump Could Weaponize U.S. Surveillance in a Second Term, Former Intel Officers Warn 
NBC News (06/03, Luce) reported that Donald Trump could turn America's spy services into weapons of 
"retribution" against domestic political opponents, skew intelligence findings in favor of authoritarian leaders, and 
undermine information sharing with U.S. allies if he wins a second term, more than a dozen former intelligence 
officers, Western officials and lawmakers said. According to the article, given Trump's track record during and after 
his first term, including his public remarks lambasting the intelligence services, his alleged mishandling of classified 
information, his vows to seek vengeance against his political opponents, and plans by his allies to purge large 
numbers of career civil servants deemed to be members of a "deep state" cabal, former intelligence officers worry 
that the spy agencies could suffer irreparable damage. Wired (06/03, Benson) stated that there are many ways in 
which a second Trump administration could utilize surveillance powers to exert more control over the populace. 
According to the article, if the FBI and the Dal are staffed with people who won't push back when Trump orders 
them to do things that might be legally or morally questionable, they may carry out his wishes, and Americans may 
discover how much their privacy rights have eroded over the years. An analysis piece by the Washington 
Post (06/03, Bump) also commented on the topic.
