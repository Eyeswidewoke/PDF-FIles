Mexico when the Justice Department announced it last month - is far broader than previously 
known." 
Mexican Officials Criticize US Over Flow Of Destructive Weapons Over Border. 
The Washington Post (11/19, 14.2M) reports Mexico's "increasingly militarized drug cartels now 
command arsenals that rival the weaponry of the country's security forces," and in "rare public 
criticism," Mexican officials are "venting their frustration at what they say is the U.S. failure to 
stop the flow" over the border. While "the United States is pushing Mexico to target cartels 
more aggressively, U.S. laws that make...destructive weapons easy to buy, along with a lack of 
enforcement at the border, are enabling those groups to expand their influence and activities in 
the country."

Google To Test End-To-End Encryption In Android Messages. 
TechCrunch (11/19, Whittaker, 605K) reports, "For the past year and a half, Google has been 
rolling out its next-generation messaging to Android users to replace the old, clunky, and 
insecure SMS text messaging. Now the company says that rollout is complete, and plans to 
bring end-to-end encryption to Android messages next year. Google's Rich Communications 
Services is Android's answer to Apple's iMessage, and brings typing indicators, read receipts, 
and you'd expect from most messaging apps these days." TechCrunch adds, "In a blog post 
Thursday, Google said it plans to roll out end-to-end encryption - starting with one-on-one 
conversations - leaving open the possibility of end-to-end encrypted group chats. It'll become 
available to beta testers, who can sign up here, beginning later in November and continue into 
the new year." 
Ars Technica (11/19, Goodin, 1.36M) reports, "Abbreviated as RCS, Rich Communication 
Service provides a, well, richer user experience than the ancient SMS standard. Typing 
indicators, presence information, location sharing, longer messages, and better media support 
are key selling points. They lead to things like better-quality photos and videos, chat over Wi-
Fi, knowing when a message is read, sharing reactions, and better capabilities for group chats. 
As Ars Review Editor Ron Amadeo noted last year, RCS interest from carriers has been tepid, so 
Google has been rolling it out with limited support. Google said on Thursday that it has now 
completed its worldwide rollout of RCS and is moving to a new phase—end-to-end encryption. 
Interest in end-to-end encryption has mushroomed over the past decade, particularly with 
revelations from Edward Snowden of indiscriminate spying of electronic communications by the 
NSA."

Wray, Haspel May Be Next To Lose Jobs In Administration. 
Fox Exclusive (11/19, Sardana) reports, "FBI director Christopher Wray could be subsequently 
on the line of firing Trump," according to US media. CIA Director Gina Haspel "has been 
increasingly irritated by Trump and its allies because they repeatedly press on again to 
declassify records connected with Russian involvement during presidential elections in 2016," 
reported CNN. Additionally, on Friday, DNI Ratcliffe "was allegedly not part of Trump's regular 
intelligence briefing." Concerns over the potential ouster of these officials comes after President 
Trump has dismissed other officials, such as former CISA Director Krebs and former Defense 
Secretary Esper.
