The Southern Sentinel (03/05, Givens) reported that officials with the Tippah County Sheriff's 
Department, FBI, and the Homeland Security Investigations federal law enforcement agency conducted a 
joint operation in Ripley on Thursday, Feb. 27 that led to the arrest of Qiyu Lin, a Chinese national who is 
being accused of defrauding a Tippah County resident out of a "substantial" amount of money through a 
cryptocurrency investment scheme. The article added that according to TCSD officials, a local resident 
contacted the department to report suspicions that an investment plan they were contributing funds 
towards was a scam. Department officials investigated and determined that the individuals suspicions 
were merited, and set up a joint operation with the FBI and HSI to catch the individual or individuals 
involved. According to department officials, individuals involved in the scam would drive from out of state 
to Tippah County and pick up cash payments from the local resident, under the premise that the funds 
would be invested in Bitcoin.

Continued Reporting: Trump Administration Halts Offensive Cyber Operations 
Against Russia 
Axios (03/04, Sabin) reported that the U.S. Cyber Command has been ordered to pause planning 
offensive cyber operations against Russia, which could impact the country's ability to respond to cyber 
threats. According to the article, the move is part of President Trump's efforts to reset diplomatic ties 
with Russia, and has been celebrated by the Kremlin, but criticized by cybersecurity experts who warn it 
could take months to recover from. The article noted that the pause in operations could allow Russian 
cyber operatives to re-wire their networks and disguise their activities, making it harder for the US to 
detect and respond to cyber threats from Russia and other countries. The article highlighted that the 
administration has also reportedly reassigned dozens of FBI officials investigating foreign election 
interference — which Russia has repeatedly been accused of.

Ex-Surgeon Tells French Court He Used Status to Sexually Abuse Children 
The Guardian (03/04, Chrisafis) reported that a former French surgeon on trial for the sexual abuse of 
hundreds of patients has told the court he used his status as a doctor to attack children but still believed 
he was a good medical practitioner. "I was a surgeon who benefited from my status to attack children, I 
don't deny that," Joel Le Scouarnec, 74, told a court in Vannes, Brittany, on Tuesday, in what is one of 
France's largest ever child abuse cases. The article noted that the digestive surgeon, who often operated 
on children with appendicitis, is accused of attacking 299 patients at a dozen hospitals 
across France between 1989 and 2014, most of them children aged under 15, with an average age of 11.
