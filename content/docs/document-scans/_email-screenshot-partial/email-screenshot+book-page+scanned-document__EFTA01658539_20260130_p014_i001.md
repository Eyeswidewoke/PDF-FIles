previous data breaches to create false beneficiaries to gain access to benefits meant to help 
workers." Bloomberg Law adds, "At least 11 states are seeing an increase in fraudulent 
unemployment insurance activity fueled by the millions of claims coming in each month and 
additional federal dollars being offered to the unemployed due to the coronavirus pandemic. 
Places including Arizona, Colorado, Maryland, New York, Ohio, Texas, and Washington combined
