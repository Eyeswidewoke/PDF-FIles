could result in disciplinary action." The article noted that Senator Chuck Grassley, who referred Thibault for

COUNTERTERRORISM 
Ex-FBI Officials Warn Congress of 'New and Imminent' Border Danger 
The New York Post (01/27, Vincent, Levine) reported that a group of former FBI officials warned that the Biden 
administration's border policy poses an "imminent danger" to the US, citing the influx of "military-aged men" from 
various global regions, potentially including those not friendly to the US. According to the article, these officials, 
including former Terrorist Screening Center Director Timothy Healy and former FBI assistant directors Kevin Brock 
and Chris Swecker, expressed concerns in a letter sent to congressional leaders. They highlighted the risk of terror 
attacks similar to the October 7 attack by Hamas on Israel, emphasizing the vulnerability due to the current border 
situation. The letter stressed the urgent need to address this security threat, especially considering the significant 
number of migrant encounters reported by Customs and Border Protection. The article noted that Republican 
leaders have also criticized the administration's border policies, linking them to national security concerns and the 
ongoing crisis of drug smuggling. 
Man Charged in 20-Plus Calls of False Threats in U.S., Canada Pleads Guilty 
The Associated Press (01/26, Staff Writer) reported that Ashton Garcia, a 21-year-old from Washington state, 
pleaded guilty to making over 20 "swatting" calls across the US and Canada, including fake bomb threats and other 
emergency situations. According to the article, these calls, often using voice-over-internet technology to conceal 
his identity, led to emergency responses, with law enforcement entering homes with guns drawn and detaining 
individuals. Garcia's actions, which included extortion and threats of explosives, prompted a federal investigation, 
leading to his indictment on 10 felony counts. Prosecutors have recommended a four-year prison sentence as part 
of his plea agreement, with sentencing scheduled for April. The article noted that the case underlines the serious 
nature of such hoaxes, highlighted by a 2017 incident where a police officer killed a man while responding to a 
similar hoax call. The press release noted that the case is being investigated by the FBI, with substantial assistance 
from numerous local law enforcement agencies throughout the United States and in Canada. The New York Times 
(01/27, Schmall) also reported on the story. 
Police Arrest Teen Said to Be Linked to Hundreds of Swatting Attacks 
WIRED (01/28, Mehrotra) reported that a 17-year-old from California, known by the handle Torswats, was arrested 
and is being extradited to Florida to face four felony charges related to his involvement in a nationwide "swatting" 
campaign. According to the article, the FBI had been tracking Torswats, who is alleged to have made hoax calls that 
led to emergency police responses, including threats to mosques and schools. The article explained that private 
investigator Brad Dennis, who had been aiding the FBI's investigation, gathered crucial evidence leading to the 
teenager's arrest. The FBI's Seattle field office, which oversaw the investigation, declined to comment on the case. 
The article noted that this arrest comes as part of a broader effort to combat the surge in swatting incidents across 
the US, with the FBI launching the National Common Operation Picture — Virtual Command Center to track such 
activities in real time. 
Last of NY 'Newburgh Four' Bomb Plot Co-defendants Set to Leave Prison 
Gothamist (01/26, Venugopal) reported that James Cromitie, convicted in 2010 of plotting to bomb Jewish sites 
and military aircraft, was granted "compassionate release" by U.S. District Court Judge Colleen McMahon, who 
criticized law enforcement for entrapment. According to the article, McMahon's release order highlighted that 
Cromitie, a small-time criminal, was coerced into the plot by the FBI's informant, Shaheed Hussain, who offered 
incentives like expensive cars and money. The article added that the plot, deemed a "manufactured terrorist plot" 
by the FBI for counterterrorism success, was extensively covered by the media, with McMahon and others 
condemning the FBI's tactics as exploitative and creating a terrorist where none existed. The article noted that 
Cromitie's release follows similar orders for his co-defendants, and the case has been cited as an example of 
government overreach in counterterrorism efforts.
