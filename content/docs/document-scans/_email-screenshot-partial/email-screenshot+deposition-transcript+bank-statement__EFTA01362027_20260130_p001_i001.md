Volatility This High Tends To Last 
Aftershocks lasting for weeks/months usually follow spikes like this 
As the dust from initial shake-up in global risk assets last week began to settle, 
markets turned to soul-searching. Was that a flash crash or not? How much 
did poor summer liquidity contribute? What part did new regulations play? Did 
markets "overreact", or was the move supported by deteriorating macro 
fundamentals? Will the Fed hike or do QE4? Rarely did opinions appear to vary 
this greatly over such a wide set of important issues. 
The extent of volatility was of course incredible. From a 7x sigma move in 
equities and all-time high change in vol of vol on Monday, to 700pts of total 
travel distance by S&P500 during the week, to four consecutive days of 6x-
15
plus sigma moves in oil, recent trading sessions were nothing short of 
20 
extraordinary. One particular development that gained some attention but still 
1997 
lacks proper appreciation by the market, in our view, is a failure to price 
dozens of equity ETFs on last Monday opening, a development that could have 
long-lasting repercussions for this $2trIn AUM industry. As it often happens, 
this surprise development exposed how far off the reality perceptions stood on VIX index 2006-2011 
the topic of liquidity. Whereas so many pundits predicted the day when HY/IG 
jo 
... 
ETFs will fail to clear, plain-vanilla equity ETFs failed to do so, while no issues 
iS 
were reported in credit space. 
The VIX index has closed at above 30pts for three days in a row early last 
week, and returned there this Tuesday. The significance of this level comes 
from historical experience shown in two graphs on the right. Here, for the sake 
of better readability, we have broken down its time series to 1997-2003 and 
g
2007-2011, and highlighted the 30pt level with a red line (2004-2006 and 2012- 
2001 
2015 are omitted as the index never reached 30pts in those years). The graphs 
seem to suggest that once volatility jumps to 30pts on the VIX scale, it tends to 
stay there for at least a few weeks or even months, with a total of seven 
distinct periods confirming this observation.

The only exceptions that happened during the past 20 years have taken place 
in early 2000 and late 2007/early 2008. So technically speaking, even periods 
of quick reversal from a 30pt VIX levels have previously proven to be prescient 
indicators of more volatility to come down the road. We would thus caution 
our readers not to be too quick in dismissing what happened over the past two 
weeks as simple "overreaction". We explore the volatility angle of this 
developing story in greater detail on the following pages. 
In the credit world, spreads have naturally widened during this past week, 
albeit to a much lesser extent than what would have been expected given the 
volatility in equities. Our DM USD HY index has widened initially from 550bp 
earlier last week to 600 by Monday, and then retraced most of that range, 
closing at 566. In IG, the identical range was 157 - 165 - 163. Negative fund 
flows have reemerged in credit, with EPFR showing $5bn out of HY last week, 
the sevenths-largest reading on record. Combined HY outflows since June 
have claimed $18bn, compared to a $38bn withdrawal in 2H 2014. The 
takeaway here is that HY market's ability to offset outflows was poorer in this 
episode compared to 2H 2014, as evidenced by a similar degree of widening 
(+130bp last 3 mo vs +150bp in 2014) on half the size of outflows.
