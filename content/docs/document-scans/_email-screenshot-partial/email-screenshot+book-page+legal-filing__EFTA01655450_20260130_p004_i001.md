Al Shabab is a top priority of the FBI. ISIS and Al Shabab represent a clear threat to all Americans. We will identify 
and investigate anyone foolish enough to provide support to these terrorists." 
Man Charged After Incendiary Device Found Under Fox News Vehicle 
KSTU (Fox-13) (10/01, Staff Writer) reported that Christopher Solomon Proctor was charged in U.S. District Court 
with Attempted Arson and Possession of an Unregistered Destructive Device after a gas can with a lit fuse was 
found under a FOX 13 News vehicle in Salt Lake City on September 12. According to the article, an FBI Special Agent 
bomb technician determined the can to be an incendiary destructive device, and FBI surveillance later observed 
Proctor driving his registered Honda CR-V, searching the area in a different car, and ultimately executing a search 
warrant on his home where agents recovered items including "black ninja boots," an empty gas can, and a 
multicolored fuse similar to the one used in the incident. The article noted that the FBI also interviewed an 
acquaintance who said Proctor admitted to placing and igniting the device under a "fox news" vehicle, though it 
failed to detonate, and that Proctor remains in custody with a history of burglary convictions. 
Opinion: You Can't Designate 'Antifal Banks and Platforms Will Act Like You Did Anyway. 
An opinion piece from Lawfare Media (10/01, Brzozowski) reported that the White House announced an executive 
order designating "Antifa" as a domestic terrorist organization, with the president declaring that it was a "militarist, 
anarchist enterprise that calls for the overthrow of the U.S. government!' According to the article, there is no legal 
authority to designate purely domestic groups as terrorist organizations, and even former FBI Director Christopher 
Wray testified in 2020 that "Antifa" is "more of an ideology or a movement than an organization." The article noted 
that the designation is largely symbolic but could still have sweeping real-world effects, such as chilling lawful 
protest, prompting banks and platforms to cut off individuals linked to "Antifa," and creating investigative risks 
despite the lack of statutory authority. The author assessed that the true danger lies not in the legal effect of the 
designation but in its performative power, as government proclamations can shift private and public behavior 
quickly, eroding constitutional protections and setting dangerous precedents that authoritarian regimes abroad 
have long exploited.

COUNTERINTELLIGENCE 
Pentagon Plans Widespread Random Polygraphs, NDAs to Stanch Leaks 
The Washington Post (10/01, Horton, Copp, Nakashima) reported that the Pentagon is considering requiring 
thousands of officials, including top generals and staff, to sign strict nondisclosure agreements and undergo 
random polygraph tests as part of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's campaign against leaks. According to the 
article, the draft memo from Deputy Defense Secretary Steve Feinberg outlines a program that would cover more 
than 5,000 personnel in the Office of the Defense Secretary and Joint Staff, prohibiting the release of non-public 
information without approval and subjecting them to random lie detector tests. The article noted that while 
polygraphs are already standard in the intelligence community, the FBI has recently used them to identify media 
leak sources, and expanding such measures into the Pentagon would be unprecedented. Former officials and 
national security lawyers argued the effort is less about countering espionage than intimidating employees and 
discouraging dissent, with critics calling the measures "scare tactics" designed to stifle leaks to the press. The 
article also highlighted that these moves come alongside broader restrictions on media access to the Pentagon, 
signaling a wider push to limit transparency and independent oversight. 
US Appeals Court Rejects Ex-Fox News Reporter Catherine Herridge's Bid to Protect Confidential Sources 
New York Post (10/01, Zilber) reported that a US appeals court rejected former Fox News and CBS News reporter 
Catherine Herridge's bid to protect her confidential sources, upholding a contempt order against her. According to 
the article, the order was issued after Herridge refused to reveal the source who leaked information about Chinese-
American scientist Yanping Chen, who was the subject of an FBI counterintelligence investigation. The article 
explained that Herridge's reporting revealed that Chen was once subjected to FBI questioning over past alleged 
misstatements related to her immigration forms, as well as details about her work with the Chinese space 
program. As part of its counterintelligence investigation that spanned six years, the FBI conducted a search of 
Chen's home. Chen, who has denied insinuations that she spied for China, was never charged with a crime. In 2018, 
Chen filed suit against the FBI, claiming that the federal agency leaked details of the probe to Herridge and Fox 
News in order to damage her reputation. The article noted that the decision has been criticized by Herridge's
