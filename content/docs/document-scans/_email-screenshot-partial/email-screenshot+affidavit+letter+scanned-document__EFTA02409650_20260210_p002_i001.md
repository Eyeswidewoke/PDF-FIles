one cannot convincingly fashion a rule of law of general application from such a series of 
necessarily fact-intensive inquiries. That other taxpayers were found to have a donative intent 
does not bear on whether Harris had a duty to pay taxes on the monies she received from Kritzik. 
Whether Harris had such a duty is, under Duberstein, a question of Kritzik's intent, a question 
whose answer can be found only upon analysis of her particular circumstances. If Kritzik harbored 
a donative intent, then Harris was not obligated to pay taxes on his largess; if, however, he did not--
if he was paying Harris for her services--then she was under a duty to do so.

It appears that the majority at once agrees and disagrees with this analysis. The majority 
acknowledges, ante at 1132, that Duberstein's principles "though general, provide a clear answer 
to many cases involving the gift versus income distinction and can be the basis for civil as well as 
criminal prosecutions in such cases." The majority is "equally certain," however, that "Duberstein 
provides no ready answer to the taxability of transfers of money to a mistress in the context of a 
long-term relationship." Ante at 1132. It takes this view because tax court cases have 
characterized similar payments made to other mistresses and companions as gifts rather than 
income. While apparently nodding to Duberstein, the majority contends that the state of the law is 
such that no reasonable mistress or companion could ever, with sufficient certainty, conclude that 
the payments she received were income rather than gifts and hence taxable. 
44 How the majority can agree that the focal point of our inquiry is properly the transferor's intent 
and yet establish what amounts to a rule of law effectively preempting such inquiries I find 
perplexing. Putting aside this problem, I am unpersuaded by the majority's argument that 
Duberstein's guidance is categorically no guidance at all. Consider the following example. A 
approaches B and offers to spend time with him, accompany him to social events, and provide him 
with sexual favors for the next year if B gives her an apartment, a car, and a stipend of $5,000 a 
month. B agrees to A's terms. According to the majority, because this example involves a transfer 
of money to a "mistress in the context of a long-term relationship", A could never be charged with 
criminal tax evasion if she chose not to pay taxes on B's stipend. I find this hard to accept; what A 
receives from B is clearly income as it is "in return for services rendered." 363 U.S. at 285, 80 
S.Ct. at 1197. To be sure, there will be situations--like the case before us--where the evidence is 
insufficient to support a finding that the transferor harbored a "cash for services" intent; in such 
cases, criminal prosecutions for willful tax evasion will indeed be impossible as a matter of law. 
That fact does not, however, condemn as overly vague the analysis itself.
