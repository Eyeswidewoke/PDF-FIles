Puerto Rico Power Company Says "Sabotage" May Have Caused Blackout. 
Bloomberg (7/29, Wyss, 4.73M) reports, "The head of Puerto Rico's power company said a 
blackout Tuesday that affected more than 400,000 customers was a 'man-made' event that 
could have been act of `sabotage.' Bloomberg adds, "Speaking to WKAQ radio Wednesday, 
Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority CEO Jose Ortiz said that he will be asking the U.S. 
Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to examine the 
incident that knocked out power to a large swath of the island for several hours Tuesday. `What 
I can tell you is that there was manipulation,' he said of the blackout. `Either this was an 
oversight on someone's part or it was an act of sabotage.' 
OTHER WASHINGTON NEWS 
US COVID Fatality Rate Down Significantly From April And May. 
The Washington Times (7/29, Howell, 492K) reports that according to pandemic trackers "the 
share of U.S. residents who test positive" for COVID-19 "and then die [is] 3.4%, far better than 
the 15% in the United Kingdom and roughly 14% in France and Italy, or 7.6% in Canada." The 
fatality rate "is down from closer to 6% in late April and early May, when states such as New 
York and New Jersey reported eye-popping numbers." The 3.4% rate "is based on known cases. 
But with so many asymptomatic carriers going untested, the real number is probably closer to 
0.6%, according to experts who have offered their best estimates." The limes adds that the 
"economic fallout from springtime lockdowns raises questions about whether they were worth it 
at all, given the seemingly low rate." White House Counselor Kellyanne Conway said on KTRK-
TVVi Houston (7/29, 92K), "The message from the White House is simple. The President 
delivered it last week. This will get worse before it gets better in some places, and as our case 
numbers rise, thankfully, the mortality rate is much lower than it was at it its peak." 
Word of the declining fatality rate comes as US deaths from coronavirus "surpassed 
150,000 on Wednesday, a number higher than in any other country and nearly a quarter of the 
world's total," Reuters (7/29, Shumaker, McKay) reports. Reuters adds, "Of the 20 countries 
with the biggest outbreaks, the United States ranks sixth in deaths per capita, at 4.5 fatalities 
per 10,000 people. Only the United Kingdom, Spain, Italy, Peru and Chile have a higher per 
capita rate, the tally shows, with U.S. deaths making up nearly 23% of the global total of just 
over 661,000." In the lead story on ABC World News TonightVi (7/29, lead story, 4:35, Muir, 
7.22M), Victor Oquendo called the death toll "unimaginable," and in its lead story, the CBS 
Evening NewsVi (7/29, lead story, 4:45, O'Donnell, 4.28M) called it "stunning" and reported 
that "deaths across the country have recently surged by more than 30%." 
The New York Times (7/29, 18.61M) reports that "an average of about 1,000 virus-related 
deaths a day have been reported over the past week, the worst rate since early June, when the 
number of people dying seemed to be falling. Now, daily death counts are rising in 23 states 
and Puerto Rico." 
USA Today (7/29, Flores, Schoolman, 10.31M) says "there is not much relief in sight. The 
three most populous states - California, Texas and Florida - were among several that set 
seven-day records for virus deaths this week. Others set records for new cases. Tennessee and 
Arkansas set records for both." NBC Nigher NewsVi (7/29, lead story, 2:50, Holt, 5.97M) 
reported in its lead story that "new states in the middle of the country now seeing fresh hot 
spots." NBC's Miguel Almaguer added that NIAID Director Fauci is "warning several American 
cities who have mostly avoided COVID's crippling crush are now on the verge of being hit hard." 
Fauci: "If you are not getting your arms around and suppressing that surge that's coming up 
two to three weeks down the pike, you're in trouble."
