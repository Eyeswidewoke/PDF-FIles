and his release date in online prison records had changed to "UNKNOWN." Newsweek (05/29, Rajab), and the

ManTech's FBI Protest Once Again Falls Short 
Washington Technology (05/29, Wakeman) reported that the sixth time was not a charm for ManTech International 
in its battle with Leidos for a $137.7 million contract to support the FBI with digital and IT services. Leidos first won 
the contract in March 2023. Several protests and corrective actions followed as ManTech pushed the FBI to amend 
aspects of the solicitation. According to the article, early on, the protests focused on aspects of the FBI's evaluation 
of ManTech's proposal. The company felt that the FBI underrated its corporate experience factor and staffing 
approach. ManTech also questioned the best-value tradeoff decision because its proposed price of $128.5 million 
was lower than Leidos's winning $137.7 million bid. The Government Accountability Office found the FBI's 
evaluation was reasonable. ManTech filed its newest protest in March, arguing that the FBI should change the 
solicitation because of President Trump's memorandum mandating that federal employees return to the office. But 
here, GAO dismissed ManTech's challenge because the company failed to identify any performance requirements 
that would be affected by memorandum. Because the FBI awarded this as a task order under the General Services 
Administration Schedule, ManTech cannot continue a protest at the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. 
Seattle Mayor Denies Allegations of an FBI Investigation Following Protests 
KCPQ (Fox-13) (05/29, Video) reported that the mayor of Seattle is firing back at rumors of an FBI investigation after 
more than 30 people were arrested in Seattle during protests between evangelicals and LGBTQ counter-protesters, 
around the city this week. SAN (05/29, Carey, Stoltzfus) reported that the FBI launched an investigation into the city 
of Seattle, Washington, following claims that local officials failed to protect a Christian group during a prayer rally 
that turned violent. The rally, held by a religious organization, was disrupted by counter-protesters. According to 
the article, after the incident, Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell said the group bore responsibility for the confrontation, 
a statement that drew criticism from civil liberties advocates and faith leaders. On Tuesday, May 27, Deputy 
Director Bongino said his team is thoroughly investigating "allegations of targeted violence against religious groups 
at the Seattle concert." Bongino stated, "Freedom of religion isn't a suggestion." That same day, Paula White-Cain, 
the head of the White House Faith Office, also spoke out, saying, "We affirm the fundamental rights to free speech 
and religious freedom for all Americans, as protected by federal law. Public officials must protect the inalienable 
rights of all citizens, regardless of their faith or religious beliefs." CBN (05/29, Aaron), and LGBTQ Nation (05/29, 
Owen) also reported on the story.
