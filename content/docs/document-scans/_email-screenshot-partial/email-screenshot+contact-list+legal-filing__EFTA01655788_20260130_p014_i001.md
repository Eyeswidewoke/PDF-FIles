WBRC (Fox-6) (02/29, Brooks) reported that 7th-grade students at Sumiton Middle School each wrote a letter to 
someone in a career field they are most interested in. Cayson Brand wrote his to the FBI in Washington, D.C. The 
article stated that the Birmingham division paid the student a visit on Thursday. Brand was given a letter in 
response from Director Wray. The article quoted Administrative Officer for FBI Birmingham, Joan Davis, who 
said, "The letter could have been filed away, or a response could have been mailed to the student. But for us, this is 
about touching the community and being part of the community, we are definitely looking at the next generation. 
The next generation of agents, intelligence analysts, accountants. We have an array of opportunities for folks to 
join the FBI,". The article added that the entire 7th-grade class learned more about the FBI and what they do. Davis 
said while they don't recruit as young as 7th grade, it's important for them to connect with the community. 
Opinion: What I Learned When I Read 887 Pages of Plans for Trump's Second Term 
An opinion piece by the New York Times (02/29, Lozada) stated that every new administration that wins power 
away from the opposing party contends that whatever its predecessors did was terrible and that victory constitutes 
a popular mandate to fix or get rid of it all. Elections have consequences, politicians love to remind us, and a big 
one entails trying to change everything, right away. The article added that it is possible to read "Mandate for 
Leadership: The Conservative Promise" — an 887-page document proposing to remake the executive branch, 
department by department, agency by agency, office by office — as one more go-round in this Washington 
tradition. With contributions by dozens of conservative thinkers and activists under the leadership of the Heritage 
Foundation's Project 2025, the book announces itself as part of a "unified effort to be ready for the next 
conservative administration to govern at 12:00 noon, Jan. 20, 2025." There is much work ahead, it states, "just to 
undo the significant damage that will have been done during the Biden years." According to the author, the FBI 
director, the document argues, must be as politically accountable to the president as any other senior official. "To 
ensure prompt political accountability and to rein in perceived or actual abuses," it asserts, "the next conservative 
administration should seek a legislative change to align the FBI director's position with those of the heads of all 
other major departments and agencies." Trump has complained that the FBI and DOJ have been weaponized 
against him; these reforms would ensure their politicization.
