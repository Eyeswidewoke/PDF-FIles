Focus Europe 
Dark clouds, no storm yet 
Dark clouds have been gathering since the beginning of the year, but we do 
not see a storm yet. Europe is dealing with an external demand shock and a 
deflationary shock. Both threaten inflation, but the latter boosts domestic 
demand. Hence, external headwinds have not yet been sufficient for us to 
revise down our central expectation for euro-area growth, but the risks are 
rising. That said, the inflation outlook has clearly deteriorated. 
A modest weakening of the euro area data, tighter financial conditions as well 
as a more dovish Fed, BoE and BoJ increase the potential for a more 
aggressive ECB easing. (i) We continue to see a deposit rate cut as a near 
certainty, but it won't be enough. (ii) Hence, we persist with our call for an 
increase in the synergies between the negative deposit rate, QE and TLTROs. 
(iii) Furthermore, we think that data will have to surprise on the upside to avoid 
a temporary acceleration of the monthly QE purchases. 
The euro area final January PMIs confirmed the softer flash reading. Despite 
the monthly decline, all the major activity indices remain consistent with 
ongoing recovery. The negative news was the slightly larger decline than 
before in the prices indices, adding to ECB concerns over low inflation. SIREN-
Momentum was broadly unchanged this week. SIREN-Surprise remained close 
to its 15 month low. 
The euro area January core HICP inflation print was a positive at the margin, 
suggesting that some of the loss in momentum at the end of last year may 
have been due to temporary factors. Still, progress this year is expected to be 
very slow, and headline inflation may well stay around zero until the summer. 
This week's draft UK/EU renegotiation looks set to pave the way for a UK 
referendum on EU membership in June. We expect the UK to remain in, but 
polls suggest a non-negligible risk of exit. So far, the EU issue has had little 
impact on monetary policy, nor should it in our central forecast. Weaker 
growth and inflation have increased market fears of a near-term easing. But if 
the BoE's generally optimistic medium-term forecasts prove correct, then the 
next move is still likely to be a hike. 
We also include links to three recent reports: an updated assessment of the 
possible coalition combinations in Spain; a preview of the coming election in 
Ireland where another periphery economy is heading for parliamentary 
fragmentation and possible minority government; and an analysis of the Italian 
bad banks proposal which while positive is far from being a game-changer.
