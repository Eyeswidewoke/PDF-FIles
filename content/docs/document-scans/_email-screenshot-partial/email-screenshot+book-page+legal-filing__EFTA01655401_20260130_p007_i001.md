report. Investigators found McGonigal informed the CEFC associate about the FBI's probe multiple times in 2017, 
including during a Florida trip and in a later phone call where he said, "we are ready for them," before CEFC 
executive Patrick Ho was arrested on bribery charges. According to the article, McGonigal initially downplayed his 
relationship with Ho but admitted to the leaks after agents presented text messages contradicting his claims, saying 
his motivation was "bravado" rather than a desire to harm the investigation. The Manhattan U.S. Attorney's Office 
considered obstruction charges for the leaks but declined, while McGonigal was later convicted in separate cases 
for taking funds from sanctioned Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska and an Albanian national, receiving overlapping 
prison sentences of 50 months and 28 months. The article noted that neither Hunter nor James Biden was 
implicated in the CEFC investigation despite their business ties to the company, which included multimillion-dollar 
payments and a failed joint venture before CEFC executives' legal troubles collapsed the deal. The New York Post 
(09/05, Nava) and The Bureau (09/06, Cooper) also reported on the story.

leading to Watson's arrest, who has ties to Portland, Oregon, and Atlanta, Georgia. "The First Amendment does not 
allow individuals to commit arson or destroy property. The FBI will continue to work with our federal, state, and 
local law enforcement partners to ensure the safety of our communities while respecting individuals' First 
Amendment rights." FBI Atlanta Special Agent in Charge Paul Brown said in the article. Additional reporting was

Associated Press (09/05, Kunzelman) reported that two 17-year-old teenagers, Kelvin Thomas Jr. and Jailen Lucas, 
were arrested and charged as adults with first-degree murder in the fatal shooting of Eric Tarpinian-Jachym, a 21-

bullets on June 30 near Washington's Mount Vernon Square. A third suspect is still being searched for by the police 
in connection with the killing. The article quoted Attorney General Pam Bondi as stating, "They made an arrest, 
thanks to the FBI. Kash Patel did incredible work since June 30, when this happened, and arrested two juveniles. 
They're 17. They will be charged as adults." Attorney General Bondi added, "This was horrific, and that's why we 
had to make D.C. safe again. That was President Trump's directive. There have been over 1900 arrests since we 
started taking D.C. back and making it safe. Over 198 guns have been taken off the street. Just last night, 10 more 
guns and 73 arrests were made in D.C. That shows how prevalent it has been and what a difference that's being 
made right now in our nation's capital. And not only that, President Trump wants to make it beautiful again, and 
especially make it safe. That's what's been so important. These families should never have to go through what Eric's 
family is going through." Additional reporting was provided by the Daily Caller (09/05, Angela).
