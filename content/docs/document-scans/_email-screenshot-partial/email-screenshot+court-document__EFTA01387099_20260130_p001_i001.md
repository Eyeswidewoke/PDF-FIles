Paul, 
Please see attached 1-pager published two weeks ago (and also a more detailed report on the industry). Our analyst is 
really bullish on FEDEX and XPO and doesn't like UPS which really got beat up last few weeks. 
What I think makes sense is picking up premium on puts on these two stocks that you should be long if they dip lower 
from current levels. You get $4.50 for $220 June Fedex Puts (the stock now at $242 and still 10% down to January highs). 
When it comes to XPO, you can get $2.45 for May 90 Puts (we have a $133 target on that stock and I recently sat in a 
meeting with our analyst and he clearly is very bullish this company). 
My point is, you have nothing in logistics and you could be long a more defensive industry if you get exercised on stocks 
that have really good growth stories. 
On UPS — they really got beat lately, but they are way behind in capex investments compared to where Fedex is and 
their automation levels are 20 years behind Fedex now. Could be a punt, but not sure it makes sense trying to catch a 
falling knife on a story that is not attractive.
