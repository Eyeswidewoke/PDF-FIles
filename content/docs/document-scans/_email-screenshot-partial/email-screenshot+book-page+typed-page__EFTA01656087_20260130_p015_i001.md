Continued Reporting: Texas Pipeline Burns for a Third Day; Residents Allowed to Return Home 
The Associated Press (09/18, Lozano) reported that a pipeline fire that forced hundreds of people to flee their 
homes in the Houston suburbs burned for a third day Wednesday, with officials saying they don't expect it to be 
extinguished until sometime Thursday evening. Officials said residents who had to evacuate would be allowed to 
return to their homes starting Wednesday evening. Authorities have offered few details about what prompted the 
driver of an SUV to hit an aboveground valve on the pipeline on Monday, sparking the blaze. The article added that 
the pipeline company on Wednesday called it an accident. Deer Park officials said preliminary investigations by 
police and FBI agents found no evidence of a terrorist attack. CBS News (09/18, Staff Writer), and Reuters (09/18, 
Staff Writer) also reported on the story. 
Opinion: Trump Says Crime Is Up. The FBI Says It's Down. Who's Right? 
An opinion piece by the Washington Post (09/18, Geraghty) stated that crime is down from last year, and down 
significantly from the bad old days of the 1990s, but it is only now returning to pre-pandemic levels. The author 
added that in June, Attorney General Merrick Garland greeted the latest quarterly update of available FBI statistics 
like a conquering hero, saying, "This data makes clear that last year's historic decline in violent crime is continuing. 
In the first three months of this year, violent crime has decreased by over 15 percent compared to same period last 
year, and murder has decreased by over 26 percent." The author mentioned that during the presidential debate 
with Kamala Harris, Trump argued that "the FBI — they were defrauding statements. They didn't include the worst 
cities. They didn't include the cities with the worst crime. It was a fraud." According to the author, Trump was 
partially correct; there's no reason to think that the FBI statistics are deliberately fraudulent, but large gaps and 
inconsistencies in the collection of data mean the numbers aren't offering a complete picture. The article noted 
that the Marshall Project explains, in 2021, "in an effort to fully modernize the system, the FBI stopped taking data 
from the old summary system and only accepted data through the new system. Thousands of police agencies fell 
through the cracks because they didn't catch up with the changes on time." That year, Miami-Dade, New York City 
and Los Angeles did not submit their data. Philadelphia reported nine months' worth of data; Chicago reported 
seven months, and Phoenix reported only one month. For 2021, the FBI noted, "crime estimates will fill in the gaps 
where data is not available." The author explained that getting a grip on what's happening with crime in the United 
States over the past few years is considerably more difficult than politicians, government officials, and journalists 
tend to acknowledge.
