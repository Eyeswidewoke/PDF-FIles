payment. According to the article, the hoax, involving a tool bag with fireworks and loose wiring, led to an 
evacuation but caused no injuries. The article noted that the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force was involved in the 
investigation, but an FBI spokesperson declined to comment as the case is pending, and it's unclear if Giordani was 
the mastermind or a pawn in the scheme. 
Former FBI Special Agent in Charge Talks Deadly Crash Outside Rochester's Kodak Center 
Spectrum Local News (01/04, Wright) and Daily Mail (01/04, Hammer) reported that former FBI Special Agent in 
Charge Peter Ahearn discussed the investigation into a deadly crash outside Rochester's Kodak Center on New 
Year's Day, emphasizing the importance of understanding motives in such incidents. The articles explained that the 
FBI, involved in the case, found no evidence of international or domestic terrorism, as stated by Agent Jeremy Bell. 
The article noted that the suspect, Michael Avery, died in the crash that killed two others and injured nine, with 
authorities still exploring domestic terrorism as a potential motive despite no clear evidence of political or social 
biases. 
San Bernardino Terrorist Attacker's Relatives Let Government Seize $275,000 Life Insurance Payout 
The SB Sun (01/04, Rokos) reported that the relatives of San Bernardino terrorist attacker Syed Rizwan Farook, who 
conspired with longtime friend Enrique Marquez in a 2015 mass shooting, relinquished their legal battle for two life 
insurance policies worth $275,000 that Farook had purchased before the 2015 attack. According to the article, the 
U.S. Attorney's Office sought to seize the proceeds, alleging they were derived from a crime of terrorism, and in 
December 2023, the court ordered the money be turned over to the U.S. government. "Many dedicated law 
enforcement personnel have worked around the clock and side by side with their Joint Terrorism Task Force 
partners to gather evidence and build a solid terrorism case against Mr. Marquez over the past two weeks," said 
Assistant Director in Charge David Bowdich of the FBI's Los Angeles Field Office in a press release from 2015. "As we 
will continue to investigate the facts surrounding the terrible shooting in San Bernardino, we will leave no stone 
unturned in an effort to deliver answers and justice to the murdered victims and the families they left behind." 
Opinion: 'No Hurt Feelings' Is No Way to Engage With Our Enemies 
An opinion piece from The Messenger (01/04, Israel) emphasized concerns about a growing tendency in U.S. 
foreign policy to prioritize not offending adversaries, even in the context of terrorism and aggressive acts by hostile 
nations. It specifically referenced the caution shown towards Iran's proxy attacks in the Red Sea and Hamas' actions 
against Israel, noting the U.S. government's reluctance to respond strongly for fear of escalating tensions or 
upsetting these groups. The author highlighted FBI Director Christopher Wray's warning about the heightened 
threat to homeland security from overseas terrorists, domestic extremists, and lone actors, indicating a need for a 
firmer stance in national security that doesn't compromise due to the feelings of aggressors.

Marine Veteran Sues Justice Department for Denying Victim's Funds 
Marine Corps Times (01/04, South) reported that a Marine veteran, Amir Hekmati, sued the Department of Justice 
for denying him $20 million from a fund for victims of state-sponsored terrorism, following FBI allegations that 
reversed an earlier decision awarding him the amount. The lawsuit emphasized that Hekmati's due process rights 
were violated, as he couldn't counter FBI claims that he offered classified information to Iranian officials, 
accusations he has consistently denied without ever being charged. The article noted that Hekmati's attorney, 
Emily Grim, criticized the government's actions as a breakdown of the rule of law, depriving Hekmati of due process 
by revoking his award based on "false, anonymous, hearsay allegations." 
How a Cuban Spy Operated Inside U.S. Intelligence and How She Was Caught 
The Washington Examiner (01/04, Durns) reported that Ana Montes, a highly respected Defense Intelligence 
Agency analyst, was revealed to have been a spy for Cuba, as detailed in the book "Queen of Cuba" by former FBI 
agent Peter J. Lapp and reporter Kelly Kennedy. According to the article, Montes, a "true believer" in Cuba's cause, 
provided critical information to Cuba for 17 years, including details of a highly classified special access program. 
The article explained that despite her successful evasion of detection, partly due to counterintelligence officials not 
suspecting a woman like her, Montes was eventually caught, with her capture aided by disillusioned Cuban 
intelligence operatives who defected to the U.S.
