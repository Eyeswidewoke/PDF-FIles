nature of the victimization (e.g., How scared were you? When did he threaten you? Is it hard to 
remember such terrible things?). If why questions are asked (e.g., Why didn't you immediately tell? 
Why didn't you resist? Why did you return to the offender? Why are you smiling in this 
photograph?), every effort should be made to communicate to the victim that any truthful answer 
is acceptable, including "because I enjoyed it." 
Interveners must understand and learn to deal with the incomplete and contradictory 
statements of seduced victims of acquaintance molesters. The dynamics of their victimization must 
be considered. Any behavior of victims must be understood and evaluated in the context of the 
entire process. Compliant victims are embarrassed and ashamed of their behavior and correctly 
believe that society will not understand their victimization. Many younger child victims are most 
concerned about the response of their parents and often describe their victimization in ways they 
believe will please their parents. Adolescent victims are typically also concerned about the response 
of their peers. Victims and their families from higher socioeconomic backgrounds may be even 
more concerned about the public embarrassment of any disclosure. Interveners who have a stereo-
typed concept ofchild-sexual-abuse victims or who are accustomed to interviewing younger children 
molested within their family will have a difficult time interviewing adolescents seduced by an 
acquaintance. Many of these victims will be street-wise, troubled, or even delinquent children from 
dysfunctional homes. Such victims should not be blindly believed, but should not be dismissed 
because the accused is a pillar of the community and they are delinquent or troubled. Such 
allegations should be objectively investigated and evaluated. 
Some victims will continue to deny their victimization no matter what the interviewer says 
or does. Some children even deny victimization that the offender has admitted or other evidence 
clearly discloses. Some will make admissions but minimize the quality and quantity of the acts. 
They may minimize their compliance and maximize the offender's involvement by claiming he 
drugged them, threatened them, had a weapon, or had even abducted them. Of course some of these 
allegations may be accurate and should be investigated. They are, however, not typical of 
acquaintance-exploitation cases. Violence is most likely used to prevent disclosure. Sadistic 
offenders may also use violence during sex, but this is relatively rare in cases involving seduction. 
As previously mentioned, these potential inaccuracies in the details of the allegations of seduced 
victims may explain some of the inconsistencies between the alleged what and the suspected who. 
The intervener must communicate to the victim that he or she is not at fault even though the 
victim did not say "no," did not fight, did not tell, initiated the sex, or even enjoyed it. When the 
victim comes to believe that the intervener understands what he experienced, he or she is more likely 
to talk. Victims often reveal the details little by little, testing the intervener's response. The 
intervener must recognize and sometimes allow the victim to use face-saving scenarios when 
disclosing victimization. As stated, such victims might claim they were confused, tricked, asleep, 
drugged, drunk, or tied up when they were not. Adolescents, who pose special challenges for the 
interviewer, use these face-saving devices most often. The intervener must accept the fact that even 
if a victim discloses, the information is likely to be incomplete, minimizing his or her involvement 
and acts. Some of these victims simply do not believe they were victims.
