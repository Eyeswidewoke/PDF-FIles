SIGNIFICANT NEWS EVENTS 
US Judge Tosses Case Against Ex-FBI Chief Comey, New York AG James 
Reuters (11/24, Lynch, Goudstvard) reported that a federal Judge dismissed criminal charges against former FBI Director James Comey and New 
York Attorney General Letitia James after ruling that Lindsey Halligan, the Trump-appointed interim U.S. attorney who brought the cases, lacked 
the lawful authority required to do so. According to the article, the Judge held that all actions taken under Halligan's improper appointment, 
including the indictments, were invalid and dismissed the prosecutions without prejudice, leaving the door open for the Justice Department to 
seek new indictments with a different prosecutor. The article also stated that AG Bondi vowed to appeal and insisted Halligan could continue as a 
special U.S. attorney, while Comey and James welcomed the ruling, characterizing the prosecutions as politically motivated and pledging to 
challenge any renewed charges. The article explained that defense lawyers argued Halligan's appointment violated federal limits on interim U.S. 
attorney appointments and circumvented Senate confirmation, whereas the Justice Department claimed multiple interim appointments were 
allowed and AG Bondi tried unsuccessfully to retroactively ratify Halligan's actions. The article noted that Halligan moved swiftly to secure 
indictments against Comey and James after career prosecutors declined to participate and subsequently came under judicial scrutiny over her 
handling of the Comey case, including possible legal errors in how evidence was presented and concerns about what the grand Jury actually 
saw. Additional reporting on the story was provided by ABC News (11/24, Faulders, Mallin, Charalambous), Associated Press (11/24, Tucker),

Continued Reporting: Cops Swann Epstein Records Vault After Cover-up Claims 
Fox News (11/24, Rumpf-Whitten) reported that the FBI deployed police officers to guard its Central Records Complex in Winchester, Virginia, 
after online chatter about possible protests circulated in response to Mark Epstein's claims that Director Patel was overseeing a "cover-up" of 
Jeffrey Epstein-related materials. The article explained that bureau police normally based at FBI Headquarters were sent to the 256,000-square-
foot facility after Mark Epstein's unsupported allegations — including that files were being edited to remove Republican names — spread widely
