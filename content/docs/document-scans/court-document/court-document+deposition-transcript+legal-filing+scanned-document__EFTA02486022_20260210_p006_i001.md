In any case, as a result, I am taking the following action =oday. I want to 
continue listen carefully to your advice, believe =t or not, but I need to feel I have a legal expert familiar with Title =X to 
talk with as well, and there is no perfect person.. but =ancy and I have decided to retain Justin, who, while perhaps too 
eager =o be combative at this stage, will work for me, and not vice versa, and =as extensive experience with university 
processes, including at =SU. His main interest is making the process fair, and if it is =ot, holding the University 
accountable after the fact. I think =hat meshes with my goal as well. I do feel much better about him than I =id about 
having Johnny's lawyer, which was delusional on my =art. Plus I will be much more critical of advice, as I will be bouncing 
=t off you as well.. I hate spending the money, but Nancy reminds =e that in the old days this is less than I would have 
received for a =ingle lecture. 
So, once again, I understand your concerns.frustrations, =nowledge, 
recriminations, etc, but this is what I am going to do. =o, I am either going to waste $15K or get some useful payback for 
it, =nd I will either kindly accept your offer to let me waste your $25K, or =y $25K. If you feel sufficiently strongly that 
you don't =ant to follow through on what you so generously offered before, which =as to provide $25K for me to work 
with however I felt I wanted to do, =nd perhaps largely for our mental health if necessary, I will not =nbsp;of course hold 
it against you in any way. You have been so =enerous with your time and friendship, which in the end is so much more 
=mportant.
