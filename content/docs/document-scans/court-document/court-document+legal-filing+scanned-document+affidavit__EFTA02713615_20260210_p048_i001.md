Partner will be required to execute an agreement pursuant to which it becomes bound by the 
terms of the Limited Partnership Agreement. 
Amendments to Limited Partnership Agreement. The Limited Partnership Agreement 
may be modified or amended at any time by the consent of the Partners having in excess of fifty 
percent (50%) of the Partnership Percentages of the Limited Partners together with the written 
consent of the General Partner. Without the consent of the other Partners, however, the General 
Partner may amend the Limited Partnership Agreement to reflect changes validly made in the 
membership of the Partnership and the capital contributions and Partnership Percentages of the 
Partners; qualify the Partnership as a limited partnership in all jurisdictions in which the 
Partnership conducts business; change the provisions relating to the Incentive Allocation so that 
such provisions conform to any applicable requirements of the SEC, the Internal Revenue 
Service and other regulatory authorities; satisfy requirements or conditions contained in opinions 
or rulings of federal or state agencies or in federal or state statutes where compliance is in the 
best interest of the Partnership; change the name of the Partnership; and effect any change that 
does not adversely affect the Limited Partners in any material respect, or that is necessary or 
desirable to cure ambiguities in the Limited Partnership Agreement. Each Partner, however, has 
the right to approve any amendment which would (a) reduce his Capital Account or rights of 
withdrawal therefrom; (b) increase the Incentive Allocation from his Capital Account; or (c) 
amend the provisions of the Limited Partnership Agreement relating to amendments. 
Reports to Partners. The Partnership's independent accountants (selected by the General 
Partner) audit the Partnership's financial statements as of the end of each fiscal year. Initially, 
the Partnership's auditors will be Rothstein, Kass & Company, P.C. The General Partner may 
change the Partnership's accountants from time to time in its discretion without notice to the 
Limited Partners. 
Within one hundred twenty (120) days after the end of the fiscal year, or as soon 
thereafter as is practicable, the General Partner will mail or cause to be mailed to each Partner 
audited financial statements of the Partnership, including a statement of financial condition and 
annual U.S. federal income tax information. The Partnership also provides periodic, unaudited 
account performance reports, no less frequently than monthly, to the Limited Partners. The 
General Partner may elect to have the first audit of the Partnership's fmancial statements to be 
performed as of December 31, 2013, with such audit covering the period from the 
commencement of the Partnership's operations through such date. 
Exculpation. The Limited Partnership Agreement provides that the General Partner will 
not be liable to the Limited Partners or the Partnership for any loss, damage, liability or expense 
except as caused by its bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct. The General Partner 
will not be liable for any act or omission of its agents (including securities broker-dealers) who 
were selected, retained or engaged by the General Partner with reasonable care. The Investment 
Management Agreement contains substantially identical terms with respect to the Investment 
Manager. 
Investors should note, however, that certain claims of investors may not be able to be 
waived (or are not indemnifiable) under applicable law, including without limitation, certain
