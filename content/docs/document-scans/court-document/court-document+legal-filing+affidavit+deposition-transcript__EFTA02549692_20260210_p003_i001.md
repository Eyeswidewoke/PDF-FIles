messages raising such questions pertained t= the Russia investigation." Given how biases ineluctably shape beh=vior, 
these facts create a strong inference that by squelching the Clinton=investigation and building a narrative of Trump-
Russia collusion, a group of government officials sought to bolster Mrs. Clinton=E204os electoral chances and, if the 
unthinkable happened, obtain an in=urance policy to cripple the Trump administration with accusations of ille=itimacy. 
What does this have to do with Mr. Mueller, who was appointed in=May 2017 after President Trump 
fired Mr. Comey? The inspector general conc=udes that the pervasive bias "cast a cloud over the FBI investigations to 
which these employees were assigned,O=9D including Crossfire. And if Crossfire was politically motivated, then i=s 
culmination, the appointment of a special counsel, inherited the taint. =11 special-counsel activities—investigations, plea 
deals, subpoenas, reports, indictments and convictions—are fr=it of a poisonous tree, byproducts of a violation of due 
process. That Mr.=Mueller and his staff had nothing to do with Crossfire's origin of=ers no cure. 
When the government deprives a person of life, liberty or proper=y, it is required to use fundamentally 
fair processes. The Supreme Court h=s made clear that when governmental action "shocks the conscience," it violates 
due process. Such con=uct includes investigative or prosecutorial efforts that appear, under the=totality of the 
circumstances, to be motivated by corruption, bias or entr=pment. 
In U.S. v. Russell =1973), the justices observed: "We may someday be presented with a situation in 
which the conduct of law enforcement agents is so outrageou= that due process principles would absolutely bar the 
government from invo=ing judicial processes to obtain a conviction." It didn't =ake long. In Blackledge v. Perry (1974), 
the court concluded that due process was =ffended by a prosecutor's "realistic likelihood of 4P=98vindictiveness' " that 
tainted the "very in=tiation of proceedings." 
In Young v. U.S. ex rel. Vuitton0=A0(1987), the justices held that because prosecutors have "power to 
employ the full machinery of the state in scrutiniz=ng any given individual ... we must have assurance that those who 
would =ield this power will be guided solely by their sense of public responsibil=ty for the attainment of justice." 
Prosecutors must be "disinterested" and make "dispassionate as=essments," free from any personal bias. 
In Williams v. Pennsylvania<=i> (2016), the court held that a state judge's potential bias violated due 
process because he had played a role, a quarter-century earli=r, in prosecuting the death-row inmate whose habeas 
corpus petition he was=hearing. The passage of time and involvement of others do not vitiate the =aint but heighten 
"the need for objective rules preventing the operation of bias that might otherwise be o=scured," the justices wrote. A 
single biased individual "m=ght still have an influence that, while not so visible ... is =evertheless significant." 
In addition to the numerous anti-Trump messages uncovered by the=inspector general, there is a strong 
circumstantial case—including=personnel, timing, methods and the absence of evidence—that Crossfire was initiated 
for political, not national-security, purposes.=/u> 
It was initiated in defiance of a longstanding Justice Departmen= presumption against investigating 
campaigns in an election year. And whil= impartiality is always required, a 2012 memo by then-Attorney General Eric 
Holder emphasizes that impartiality is 4)=800particularly important in an election year," and "pol=tics must play no 
role in the decisions of federal prosecutors or investig=tors regarding any investigations.... Law enforcement officers 
and prosecutors may never select the timing of investigative step= or criminal charges for the purpose of affecting any 
election, or for therpurpose of giving an advantage or disadvantage to any candidate or politic=l party." 
Strong evidence of a crime can overcome this policy, as was the =ase with the bureau's investigation of 
Mrs. Clinton's priv=te email server, which began more than a year before the 2016 election. But Crossfire was not a 
criminal investigation. It was a counter=ntelligence investigation predicated on the notion that Russia could be co=luding 
with the Trump campaign. There appears to have been no discernible =vidence of Trump-Russia collusion at the time 
Crossfire was launched, further reinforcing the notion that it=was initiated "for the purpose" of affecting the 
president=al election.
