(C) 
if only Subordinated Securities are then Outstanding, a Majority of 
the Subordinated Securities; 
provided, however, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Investment Manager, on behalf of 
the Issuer, may direct the Trustee to, and the Trustee shall in the manner directed, deliver assets 
in connection with the terms of any contractual arrangement entered into prior to the occurrence 
of an Event of Default or accept any Offer or tender offer made to all holders of any Collateral 
Obligation at a price equal to or greater than its par amount plus accrued interest; provided, 
_Maher, that the Issuer must continue to hold funds on deposit in the Credit Facility Reserve 
Account to the extent required to meet the Issuer's obligations for future payments on any Credit 
Facility. 
So long as such Event of Default is continuing, the prohibition against selling or 
liquidating the Collateral may be rescinded at any time when the conditions specified in 
clause (i) or (ii) are satisfied. 
(b) 
Nothing contained in Section 5.5(a) shall be construed to require the Trustee to 
sell the Collateral if the conditions set forth in Section 5.5(a) are not satisfied. Nothing contained 
in Section 5.5(a) shall be construed to require the Trustee to preserve the Collateral if prohibited 
by applicable law or if the Trustee is directed to liquidate the Collateral pursuant to 
Section 5.5(a). 
(c) 
In determining whether the condition specified in Section 5.5(a)(i) exists, the 
Trustee (in consultation with the Investment Manager) shall obtain bid prices with respect to 
each obligation contained in the Collateral by reference to an Independent pricing service or 
from two nationally recognized dealers (or, if bids cannot be obtained from two such dealers, one 
nationally recognized dealer, or failing that, then the Trustee shall obtain a bid price from that 
dealer, market maker or bidder, or if there are no nationally recognized dealers, then the Trustee 
shall obtain quotes from a pricing source), as specified by the Investment Manager in writing, at 
the time making a market in such obligations and shall compute the anticipated proceeds of sale 
or liquidation on the basis of such bid prices for each such obligation. In addition, for the 
purposes of determining whether the condition specified in Section 5.5(aXi) exists, the Trustee 
may retain and rely on an opinion of an investment banking firm of national reputation, which 
may be Credit Suisse. 
The Trustee shall promptly deliver to any Hedge Counterparty, the Holders, the 
Investment Manager and the Issuer a report stating the results of any determination required 
pursuant to Section 5.5(aXi). The Trustee shall make the determinations required by such 
Section only at the request of the Controlling Party at any time during which the Trustee retains 
the Collateral pursuant to Section 5.5(a) and the obligation to make any such determination will 
be subject to Section 6.3(c). In the case of each calculation made by the Trustee pursuant to 
Section 5.5(a)(i), the Trustee shall obtain a letter of an Independent accountant confirming the 
accuracy of the computations of the Trustee. 
(d) 
The Trustee shall deliver to any Hedge Counterparty notice of any action to be 
taken or sale pursuant to Section 5.4(a) prior to the taking of any such action as well as notice 
confirming the occurrence of the action, including, without limitation, the date of any sale or its
