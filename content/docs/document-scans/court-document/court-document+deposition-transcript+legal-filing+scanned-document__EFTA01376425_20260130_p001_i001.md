(iii) 
to indemnify the Trustee and its Officers, directors, employees and

incurred without negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith on their part, arising 
out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of this trust, 
including the costs and expenses of defending themselves (including reasonable 
attorney's fees and costs) against any claim or liability in connection with the 
exercise or performance of any of their powers or duties hereunder; and 
(iv) 
to pay the Trustee reasonable additional compensation together 
with its expenses (including reasonable counsel fees) for any collection action 
taken pursuant to Section 6.13 hereof. 
(b) 
The Trustee's fee shall be calculated on the basis of the actual number of 
days elapsed in the relevant period divided by 360. The Trustee shall receive amounts pursuant 
to this Section 6.7 payable as Administrative Expenses as provided in Sections I I.1(a)(i) and (ii) 
but only to the extent that funds are available for the payment thereof. Subject to Section 6.9, the 
Trustee shall continue to serve as Trustee under this Indenture notwithstanding the fact that the 
Trustee shall not have received amounts due it hereunder. No direction by the Securityholders 
shall affect the right of the Trustee to collect amounts owed to it under this Indenture. If on any 
date when an amount pursuant to this Section 6.7 shall be payable to the Trustee pursuant to this 
Indenture insufficient funds are available for the payment thereof, any portion of such amount 
not so paid shall be deferred and payable on such later date on which a fee shall be payable and 
sufficient funds are available therefor. 
(c) 
The Trustee hereby agrees not to cause the filing of a petition in 
bankruptcy against either of the Co-Issuers for the non-payment to the Trustee of any amounts 
provided by this Section 6.7 until at least one year and one day, or if longer the applicable 
preference period then in effect, after the payment in full of all Securities issued under this 
Indenture. The agreement and obligation of the Trustee pursuant to this Section 6.7(c) shall 
survive the termination or resignation of the Trustee.

If such organization or entity publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or
