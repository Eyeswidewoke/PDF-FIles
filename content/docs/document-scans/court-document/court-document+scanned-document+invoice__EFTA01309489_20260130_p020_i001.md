We are working On the Quadski, 1st - The ECU was not communicating 
with the computer - we found an issue vAth a wire pulled out, now we 
are communicating. The Initial tests on the Chassis wire harness and 
components (Fan, Blowers Throttle Blipper. bilge ) are all working 
property. 
The Next thing we need to establish is the condition of the Clutch. 
Your Mechanic mentioned he removed the Clutch cover. there are still 
loose bolts that establish it has been worked on. There's no water time 
and little land use - The clutch should not be worn out? The machine is 
having the fluids replaced and get is started to evaluate why your 
mechanic was looking at the clutch!Along with a Battery -Exhaust 
Muffler Rubber mount is broken in Halt -The Muffler is loose connecting 
to exhaust pipe - seal is damaged 
RH side - Upper Sprocket seal/Cap is missing - Tire Hub cap is 
missing.-
Handle Bar assembly- Has been recalled - I sent that request in 
immediately - part are her to update the machine - No Charge to 
customer -
The Air Intake Hose to Engine -was being squished flat - The hose is 
mounted in the wrong location -The Fuel Tank seal is Missing - rubber 
seal for fuel pump assy -If things go well the machine could be done by 
end of next week -If the clutch needs work add probably another week! 
This information will at be on a report - Before we repair we will be 
making contact for approval
