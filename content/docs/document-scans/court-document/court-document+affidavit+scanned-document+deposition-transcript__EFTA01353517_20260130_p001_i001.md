obligati:mfg. of one or more specified issuers or guarantors. 
each of which is called a reference entity. The reference 
obligation(s) and each reference entity for a class of credit 
default options are selected by the listing options market. 
When a credit default option is based on reference 
obligation(s) of more than one issuer or guarantor, it Is 
referred to as a credit default basket option. There are further 
variations on credit default basket options as described 
below. 
A credit default option is automatically exercised and 
pays a fixed cash settlement amount if a credit event is 
confirmed for one or more reference obligations of a 
reference entity prior to expiration of the option. The 
reference obligations of a reference entity may include all of 
the outstanding debt securities constituting general 
obligations of the reference entity or direct claims on the 
reference entities (excluding any nonrecourse debt). A 
credit event may include a failure to make a payment on a 
reference obligation andfor any other event(s) that the listing 
options market may specify at the time a class of credit 
default options is listed. The specified credit event(s) will be 
defined in accordance with the terms of the reference 
obligation(s). However, not every event that might constitute 
an event of default by the reference entity under the terms of 
the reference obligations will necessanly be specified by the 
listing options market as a credit event. Investors should be 
certain that they understand the various possible events that 
will or will not constitute credit events. The determination of 
whether a particular event meets the criteria of a credit event, 
however defined, for a specific credit default option is within 
the sole discretion of the listing options market. 
In order to result in automatic exercise of the option, a 
credit event must be confirmed to have occurred during the 
covered period (i.e., the period between the initial listing of 
the series of options and the time specified by the options 
market as the last day of trading of the option series prior to 
the expiration date). An event that would otherwise be 
deemed a credit event will not result in an exercise of the 
option if it occurs either before or after this period. A series of 
credit default options ordinarily does not expire until a 
specified number of business days following the end of the 
covered period in order to provide the listing options market 
an opportunity to confirm whether or not a credit event 
occurred within the covered period. If an event otherwise 
meeting the definition of a credit event occurs alter the end 
of the covered period but before the option expires, the 
option will not be exercised and will expire worthless. 
If the listing options market determines that a credit 
event has occurred within the covered period for a class of 
credit default options, it will provide a credit event 
confirmation to CCC, and the options will be automatically 
exercised. Holders of the exercised options will receive. and 
writers will be obligated to pay. the fixed cash settlement 
amount. If OCC does not receive a credit event confirmation 
from the listing options market before expiration of a series 
of credit default options, the options will expire worthless.
