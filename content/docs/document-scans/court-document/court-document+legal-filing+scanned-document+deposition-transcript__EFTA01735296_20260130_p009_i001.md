The witness had to leave to catch a flight. Miss Montgomery said that there were further challenges she could 
make to his evidence, but thought it unnecessary in the circumstances. That was accepted by the court after no 
point was taken by Mr Robertson. The witness was clearly uncomfortable and anxious to leave. 
Summary of facts found 
1 make the following findings of fact from the evidence I have heard: 
1. The proceedings in Sweden are at the preliminary investigation stage. 
The preliminary 
investigation does not come to an end until evidence is served on Mr Assange or his lawyer and 
there is an interrogation of Mr Assange with the opportunity for further enquiries. Thereafter 
there is a decision as to charge. If charged the trial is likely to take place shortly thereafter. 
2. In Sweden, a person interrogated for rape is normally detained and held incommunicado during 
the process. These decisions are taken by a court. 
3. The original decision by a prosecutor not to proceed with sexual assault allegations against Mr 
Assangc was overruled by a more senior prosecutor, Ms Ny. This process is provided for in the 
Swedish system, but is thought by some to be unfair, especially as Mr Assange would not be 
entitled to make representations before the review decision was made. 
4. Mr Assange had been interviewed about the sexual assault allegations before Ms Ny took over 
the case. The fact that he was being treated as a suspect was leaked to the press, probably by 
the first prosecutor (not Ms Ny) and the police (see Mr Hurtig's evidence, p.68). This is a 
breach of confidentiality, but apparently not actionable in Sweden. There may be a remedy for 
breach of privacy in the European Court (see Mr Hurtig's transcript p.69). 
5. After taking over the case Ms Ny "sensibly" [Mr Hurtig] decided to interview the complainant 
(on 2' September). Mr Hurtig was instructed by Mr Assange on 8th September and entered 
into communication with Ms Ny shortly thereafter. On 14th September he asked the prosecutor 
for documents with a view to an interrogation, but they were not forthcoming. 
6. The complainants were interviewed several times (submissions to Svea Court of Appeal). 
7. The Swedish system emphasises the importance of early interrogation (Mr Alliem). Ms Ny 
contacted Mr Hurtig and asked to interrogate his client. Mr Hurtig cannot say for certain 
whether that was on 21" (as Ms Ny says in her written information) or 22to September. The 28th 
September was suggested as a date for interrogation. 
8. No interrogation has taken place. 
9. Mr Hurtig says he was unable to make direct contact with his client between Ms Ny asking for 
a interview on 21" or 22nd September and 2941 September. By this time he says he client was no 
longer in Sweden. An interview was offered by the defence on 10th October onwards, but that 
was said by Ms Ny to be too far away 
10. Mr Hurtig in an unreliable witness as to what efforts he made to contact his client between 21", 
221,4 and 29th September (see transcript pages 122-132). He has no record of those attempts. 
They were by mobile phone, but he has no record. He cannot recall whether he sent texts or 
simply left answer-phone messages. 
11. There is no direct evidence as to when Mr Assange left Sweden. Mr Hurtig says he was told it 
was on 27th September, and he has seen a baggage ticket bearing that date. He cannot say 
whether it was a morning or an afternoon flight.
