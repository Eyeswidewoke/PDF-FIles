Re: 
conjecture,

I do not understand =orces as primitives, or atomic properties. How do you envision =t? 
I imagine the universe as a =aurally closed machine that can be described on a lowest level with a =et of simple, 
uniform rules. The primary data structure can be a =ypergraph, i.e. a set of locations that are connected with shared, 
=yped properties. All changes in the universe can be described using =raph rewriting rules. 
The =ules could in principle either be deterministic, like in a cellular =utomaton, or probabilistic, like in a Markov 
model. However, our =niverse seems to preserve the amount of information in it, as suggested =y the first law of 
thermodynamics, which makes it likely that all =ransitions are reversible (i.e. each state has exactly one preceding =tate; 
if a state had two or more possible precedents, we would =ffectively delete bits). The most elegant universe seems to be 
=eterministic, with all probabilistic effects at the lowest level being =seudorandom (many cellular automata have that 
property). A =robabilistic universe seems possible, too, but I do not understand the =oops I would have to make it jump 
through so it gives rise to the =pparent preservation of information. 
The universe contains hierarchies of causal =ystems. A causal system is one that can be described independently 
of =he underlying dynamics, as long as those remain within certain bounds. =or example, I can talk about tomorrow's 
weather, unless the planet is =eing hit by an asteroid, I can talk about the program running on my =omputer, unless the 
processor overheats or the power runs =ut. 
Causal systems require that I =an identify conditional state transitions, and there are mechanisms =cting on the 
underlying dynamics the constrain the state =pace. 
As soon as we leave the =lementary level of the universe and look at a higher causal level, =here is a possibility 
that the underlying dynamics leave the region of =heir state space that enables the higher causal level. There is always = 
non-zero probability that my computer fails, my monetary system breaks =own etc. 
An additional =omplication is that we cannot observe the elementary level. We only get =o see patterns at high 
causal levels and infer everything else in a =ind of machine learning process using a combination of approximately 
=robabilistic models and symbolic =easoning. 
- it is the underlying =orce for self organizing =ystems. 
=/div> 
Would that not =e evolution? I.e. those systems that self-organize in unstable ways die =ff to be 
replaced by fitter systems, as long as there is an entropy =radient that can feed any self-organizing system at all? 
I wonder if it makes sense to hire an animator to =llustrate how elementary Hamiltonian dynamics in a 
deterministic =niverse can give rise to entropy gradients if we (at least =emporarily) open the universe, and how this 
makes the formation of =table objects and self-organizing systems possible for a short while. I =hink that I can see it
