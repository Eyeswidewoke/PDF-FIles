1. Except as otherwise provided in this Section, the Company, its receiver or its trustee 
shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Sole Member and each managing Member and 
their respective heirs, personal representatives, and successors, and may indemnify, defend and 
hold harmless any employee or agent, who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to a 
threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, from and against any expense, loss, 
damage or liability incurred or connected with, or any claim, suit, demand, loss, judgment, 
liability, cost or expense, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees, arising from or 
related to, the Company or any act or omission of the Sole Member, such managing Member or 
such employee or agent on behalf of the Company, and amounts paid in settlement of any of the 
above, provided that such amounts were not the result of fraud, gross negligence, or reckless or 
intentional misconduct on the part of the Sole Member, such managing Member or such 
employee or agent against whom a claim is asserted. The Company may advance to the Sole 
Member, each such managing Member or any such employee or agent and their respective heirs, 
personal representatives, and successors the costs of defending any claim, suit or action against 
such person if such person undertakes to repay the funds advanced, with interest, if the person is 
not entitled to indemnification under this Section. 
2. To the extent that the Sole Member, any such managing Member, or any such employee 
or agent of the Company has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of an action, 
suit or proceeding or in defense of any claim, issue or other matter in the action, suit or 
proceeding, such person shall be indemnified against actual and reasonable expenses, including, 
without limitation, attorneys' fees, incurred by such person in connection with the action, suit or 
proceeding and any action, suit or proceeding brought to enforce the mandatory indemnification 
provided herein. 
3. Any indemnification permitted under this Section, unless ordered by a court, shall be 
made by the Company only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that the 
indemnification is proper under the circumstances because the person to be indemnified has met 
the applicable standard of conduct and upon an evaluation of the reasonableness of expenses and 
amounts paid in settlement. This determination and evaluation shall be made by the vote of the 
majority of the Membership Units of the Members who are not parties or threatened to be made 
parties to the action, suit or proceeding, unless the only Member is the Sole Member, in which 
case such determination and evaluation will be made by the Sole Member. Notwithstanding the 
foregoing to the contrary, no indemnification shall be provided to any managing Member, 
employee or agent of the Company for or in connection with the receipt of a financial benefit to 
which such person is not entitled, voting for or assenting to a distribution to the Members in 
violation of this Agreement or the Act, or a knowing violation of law. 
SECTION VII 
LIQUIDATION 
The Company shall be dissolved, and shall terminate and wind up its affairs, upon the 
determination of the Sole Member to do so.
