Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 
6. BORROWINGS UNDER CREDIT FACILITY (Continued) 
purposes. Thc facility bears interest on the drawn amount at the rate of 130 basis points (1.3%) above 
the Three Month London Interbank Offered Rate (0.2552% at December 31, 2014). The Operating 
Partnership is required to pay any interest due quarterly in arrears beginning January 1, 2014 and any 
unpaid interest and drawn principal is due and payable in full on January 1, 2019 ("Maturity Date"). 
The minimum advance under the terms of the facility is $500,000 and may be repaid at any time prior 
to the Maturity Date. Thc credit facility is secured by a first mortgage over, and assignment of leases 
from, the Pleasant Plains, Macomb Farm, Kane County Farms, Sweetwater and Tillar properties. The

facility, the properties securing the credit facility must have an aggregate appraised value such that the 
amount of the credit facility is 50% or less of the aggregate appraised value of such properties. The 
amount outstanding under this credit facility is $20,400,000 as of December 31, 2014. We believe we arc 
in compliance with the credit facility covenants. Thc fair value of the borrowings under the credit 
facility as of December 31, 2014 was approximately $20.4 million, comparable to our carrying value of 
$20.4 million.

fee) in arranging the credit facility. These costs arc being amortized on a straight-line basis over the 
period of the agreement.
