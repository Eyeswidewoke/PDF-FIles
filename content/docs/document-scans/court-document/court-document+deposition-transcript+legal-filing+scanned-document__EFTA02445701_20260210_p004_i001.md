2. After my removal as Director of the Origins Project, I understand the eventual necessity of 
ending the program. However the manner it was done was particularly disingenuous and 
unfortunate. With no warning to me, or those followers of Origins, it was announced that 
Origins had now morphed into something completely different This simply isn't true. 
The Interplanetary Initiative bears little or no relationship to the mission and goals of the 
Origins Project Moreover, the Origins Project had built up a remarkable storehouse of 
material of great interest and relevance for researchers, students, teachers, and the 
general public on its website. Again with no notice that website was simply removed. All 
evidence that Origins existed was erased from ASU, along with the resources that should 
have been kept available for all. Why? I assume it because my presence infused much of 
the material? Shame on you for deciding that public image is more important than 
substance and benefit 
3. Only after the conclusion of the investigation, and only after the Provost made his 
determination based on their conclusions, was I in a position to present relevant new 
evidence to counter the conclusions of the investigation. Yet neither the Provost nor the 
OEI reopened their investigation, and the OEI never even responded to my request to 
them to do so. This was contrary to the precedent set by OEI regarding one of the claims 
against me. In that case the OEI reopened an investigation of a claim against me that had 
been dismissed previously, even when no new complainants had contacted the University 
(and in fact the alleged victim herself never issued a complaint). Instead they did so, after 
reading an online tabloid report, and ultimately changed their determination. There 
seemed to be little interest in discerning the truth. 
4. During the subsequent Conciliation process, I was given little and inaccurate guidance, 
and the sense I got was that the University was trying to railroad me into accepting 
unreasonable conditions without the ability to adequately assess them. I was informed, 
after buying plane tickets for my wife, and myself that the meeting the committee was 
going to have with the Dean and me was canceled. The reason given was that the Provost 
had determined that Conciliation was possible, but that the Dean was not empowered to 
negotiate the details. During the process the press approached us both. I respected the 
process by adhering to confidentiality. You didn't Two days later, after the State Press 
reported comments by you, the Dean contacted me asking to discuss Conciliation. I had 
not received the Conciliation Committee report at that time. I contacted you and asked for 
the report You sent me the report 6 days after you received it, giving me one day to come 
to agreement with the Dean. The next day Dean and I subsequently discussed possible 
terms based on the terms described in the Conciliation Committee recommendations. The 
Dean indicated he would get back to me. Then, at 2:16 pm that day, the Dean forwarded a 
contract to me that did not incorporate the suggestions described in the Conciliation 
Committee recommendations, and I was told I had 2 hours to sign it, even though it was 
now after business hours in Washington DC, where my lawyer resides. I had to get my 
lawyer to contact the University's counsel to get an extension to allow any meaningful
