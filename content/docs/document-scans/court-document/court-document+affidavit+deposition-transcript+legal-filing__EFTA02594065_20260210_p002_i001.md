received insruction to deliver to broker. Once we get quantity and=other transfer agent issues cleared up, we will mpve 
to broker and sell.&n=sp; RD is contacting outside counsel again today for follow up 
I rec'd the last of 3 IT outsource proposals yesterday. Second mee=ings with all concluded last week and 
EA/ LD included in second meeting.&n=sp; I will summarize differences and take one firm out of running (cost 3x=. Plan 
was to discuss internally today/ tomorrow for final selection. Cost 10% cheaper than current provid=r with same/ 
improved coverage. 
Foundation has been funded with appreciated stocks and these positions h=ve been liquidated. There 
are 1648 shares of United Rentals that are=restricted. RD is sending paperwork to LDB to sign today to clean these 
sh=res up. Once the paperwork is provided to broker and they release the restriction (move the shares to type 2 
acco=nt) then transfer to Foundation will begin. There are a couple of lo=s positions worth < $3K that need to be sold. 
RD is to provide shares a=d ticker to EA today so that clearance/ compliance apporval can begin. I'd like to have the 
accounting group=be invilved in this to gain familiarity with the Apollo compliance process= There is a worthless 
position that JPM will purchase for $1 t= take off their books (Scienta is the name of the company - no longer on pink 
sheets or OTC BB) RD has paperwork f=r this for LDB to sign today. 
401k - call with specialist yesterday with EA/RJ. To not hav= Julie be part of 401k, the thought is to 
begin plan Dec 1. Compensa=ion would be one month and any employer contribution would be minimal give= any 
contribution would be for rank and file on one month comp. Given that highly compensated is defined by prior ye=r 
compensation, Ftl and RD are not highly comped in 2013 and will help cure=any low participation by rank and file for 
2014 plan year. (Plan yea= is calender year) Top heavy rules should not be applicable given that RI and EA are only key 
employees and AC/RD ar= not, ie the key employee contributions will not exceed 60% of total plan =ontributions a/o 
12/31/2014. For 2015, the 401k speciali=t is running numbers based on our census to see if we will have any issue 
either on the discrimination rules or the top he=vy rules. Specialist indicated that matching can be made only for no=-
highly compensated and not fr highly compensation, For 2015, HG will not =e highly compensated apparently as her 
stub comp is less than $115K. The more non-highly comped that partic=pate, the better. 401k specialist is running 
some scenarios and cost= under different matiching scenarios and will revert tomorrow (Tuesday is =mbrose holiday) 
Art list has been provided to LDB. Gating question is what is cost=benefit of retaining more than 2x 
collateral - step up benefit of art reta=ned in estate vs lesser value of art partnership leaving an unpaid note in=hands of 
APO1 (with a zero basis), ie capital gain by trust at death. This was the gist of the meeting wit= LDB /HG/Ill late Oct. HG 
has confirmed we can expand colateral list =o 200+ names and go down the value scale to $200K per item. LDB =K with 
this. This was discussed in FO team meeting two weeks ago.
