P. 
I have been advised and understand that I am responsible for obtaining such legal, financial 
and other advice as I consider appropriate in connection with my execution, delivery and 
performance of this Subscription Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. 
Q. 
I have been advised and understand that counsel to the Company is counsel to the 
Company only and is not counsel to me or any other purchaser of any of the Units (or any 
of the Constituent Securities or the Underlying Shares). 
9. 
Representations and Warranties of Subscriber 
I hereby further represent and warrant to, and covenant with, the Company and each 
officer, director and agent of the Company as follows: 
A. 
I am acquiring the Units (and the Constituent Securities and all Underlying Shares I may 
acquire) for my own account and not as an agent or otherwise fix any other person or 
entity, and I have not offered or sold any portion of the Units (or any of the Constituent 
Securities and the Underlying Shares) and have no present intention of dividing my 
interest therein with others or of reselling or otherwise disposing of any portion of my 
Units (or any of my Constituent Securities and Underlying Shares) either currently or after 
the passage of a fixed or determinable period of time or upon the occurrence or non-
occurrence of any predetermined event or circumstance. 
B. 
I have been advised and understand that the Company is considered a start-up stage 
company, that it has no operating history and there are significant risks associated with the 
purchase of Units (and any of the Constituent Securities and Underlying Shares). I am 
familiar with the business and financial condition, properties, operations and prospects of 
the Company. I have been advised and understand that any projections or other "forward-
looking statements" (as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995), 
which are identified by the use of words such as "believes," "expects," "projects," and 
similar expressions, that may have been provided to me by or on behalf of the Company 
reflect the Company's current beliefs and are based on assumptions that the Company 
believes arc reasonable and that such projections or other "forward-looking statements" 
are subject to uncertainties and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially 
from anticipated results.. 
C. 
I (together with such attorney(s), accountant(s) and other advisor(s) as I may have elected 
to retain or use) have had a reasonable opportunity to ask questions of and receive 
answers from the Company or representatives thereof concerning the Company and its 
business, properties, prospects and financial condition and the potential purchase of Units 
(and the Constituent Securities) as contemplated hereby and all such questions have been 
answered to my full satisfaction. 
D. 
I understand that, unless I notify the Company in writing to the contrary at or before the 
issuance to me of any Units (or Constituent Securities or Underlying Shares), all of my 
representations and warranties contained in this Subscription Agreement and/or my 
Confidential Investor Questionnaire will be deemed to have been reaffirmed as of the date 
of each such issuance, taking into account all information received by me. Should I advise
