Date") capital will be withdrawn from the Partnership without any further action required of 
such Limited Partner (including any gains or losses thereon) as follows: 
(1) 
First, as of the Gated Withdrawal Date, the Limited Partner will be 
deemed to have withdrawn capital from his Capital Account equal to the 
Maximum Amount; and 
(2) 
Second, as of the Withdrawal Date immediately following the 
Gated Withdrawal Date, the Limited Partner will be deemed to have 
withdrawn capital from his Capital Account equal to the amount requested 
to be withdrawn on the Gated Withdrawal Date but not satisfied as a result 
of the Investor Gate. 
Capital not withdrawn as a result of the Investor Gate will remain invested in the 
Partnership and will increase or decrease based upon the performance of the Partnership until the 
effective date of the withdrawal of such capital. 
4.4 
Impaired Withdrawals. 
(a) 
Notwithstanding Section 4.2 above, if the General Partner determines that 
the liquidity in the Partnership's investment portfolio is impaired as of a Withdrawal Date (an 
"Impaired Withdrawal Date"), the General Partner may require each Limited Partner making a 
withdrawal of ninety percent (90%) or more of his Capital Accounts as of such date (a 
"Designated Limited Partner") to retain his pro rata interest in any investments that the 
Investment Manager believes cannot be liquidated at such time without undue cost to the non-
withdrawing Limited Partners ("Designated Investments"). Designated Limited Partners will 
retain such interests until the Investment Manager liquidates the applicable Designated 
Investments in the ordinary course of business (an "Impaired Withdrawal Period"), or such 
earlier date as of which the General Partner, in its discretion, elects to terminate the Impaired 
Withdrawal Period. A Limited Partner will be not required to maintain an interest in Designated 
Investments that have a value as of such Impaired Withdrawal Date of more than ten percent 
(10%) of the total net asset value of such Limited Partner's Capital Accounts as of such date. 
(b) 
The Incentive Allocation, if any, due to the General Partner with respect to 
a Designated Limited Partner on an Impaired Withdrawal Date (but not on any other date or with 
respect to any other Limited Partner) shall be calculated as if the Designated Investments were 
deemed to have no value as of such date. 
(c) 
During an Impaired Withdrawal Period, a Designated Limited Partner's 
interest in any Designated Investments will increase or decrease based upon the performance of 
such Designated Investments. A Designated Limited Partner will receive distributions from the 
Partnership promptly following the liquidation of each applicable Designated Investment, net of 
any expenses. Management Fees will accrue on the Designated Investments during an Impaired 
Withdrawal Period, but will not be payable with respect to a Designated Limited Partner until he 
has received distributions from Designated Investments that exceed any applicable unrecovered 
Loss Recovery Account balance that existed as of the Illiquid Redemption Date. An Incentive 
Allocation shall also be due with respect to all such distributions to the extent they exceed any
