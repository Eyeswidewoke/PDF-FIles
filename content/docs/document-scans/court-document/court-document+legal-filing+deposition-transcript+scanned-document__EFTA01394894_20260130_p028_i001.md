statutory or other rights of the Transferor under any applicable law or this Agreement, other than 
the right to receive distributions with respect to the Interest that is the subject of the Transfer. 
Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, both the Fund and the Manager shall be entitled 
to treat the Transferor as the absolute owner of such Interest in all respects, and shall incur no 
liability for distributions made in good faith to it, until such time as the requirements of this 
Article X have been fulfilled. 
10.3 
Substituted Members. 
10.3.1 No Member shall have the right to substitute a Transferee, donee, heir, legatee, 
distributee or other recipient of such Member's Interest as a Member in its place. Any such 
Transferee, donee, heir, legatee, distributee or other recipient of an Interest (whether pursuant to a 
voluntary or involuntary transfer) shall be admitted to the Fund as a "Substituted Member" only 
(i) with the prior written consent of the Manager, which consent may be granted or withheld in 
the sole discretion of the Manager, (ii) by satisfying the other requirements of this Article X and 
(iii) upon an amendment to this Agreement recorded in the proper records of each jurisdiction in 
which such recordation is necessary to qualify the Fund to conduct business or to preserve the 
limited liability of the Members. Any such consent by the Manager may be evidenced by the 
execution by the Manager of an amendment to this Agreement evidencing the admission of such 
Person as a Substituted Member or such other document as may be determined by the Manager. 
The Members hereby consent and agree to such admission of a Substituted Member by the 
Manager, and agree that the Manager may, on behalf of each Member and on behalf of the Fund, 
cause the books and records of the Fund to be updated to appropriately reflect such admission, in 
the event of such admission. 
10.3.2 Each Substituted Member, as a condition to its admission as a Substituted 
Member, shall execute and acknowledge such instruments, in form and substance satisfactory to 
the Manager, as the Manager deems necessary or desirable to effectuate such admission and to 
confirm the agreement of the Substituted Member to be bound by all the terms and provisions of 
this Agreement. Further, each Member agrees, upon the request of the Manager, to execute such 
certificates or other documents and perform such acts as the Manager deems appropriate to 
preserve the limited liability status of the Fund under the laws of any jurisdiction in which the 
Fund is doing business after the completion of any Transfer of Interest. 
10.3.3 Each Member hereby agrees to indemnify the Fund and each other Member 
against any loss, damage, cost or expense (including, without limitation, tax liabilities or loss of 
tax benefits) arising directly or indirectly as a result of any Transfer or proposed Transfer by such 
Member in violation of this Article X. 
10.4 
Transfer of Interests by the Manager. To the extent permissible under applicable law, 
nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to prevent the merger of the Manager with another 
corporation, limited liability company, limited partnership or other entity, the reorganization of the 
Manager into or with any other corporation, limited liability company, limited partnership or other entity, 
the transfer of all equity interests in, or all or substantially all of the assets of, the Manager, the transfer of 
the Manager's Interest or the assumption of the rights, duties (including status as the general partner of 
the Fund) and liabilities of the Manager by, in the case of a merger, reorganization or consolidation, the 
surviving entity by operation of law or, in the case of a transfer of equity interests in or assets of the 
Manager or the Manager's Interest, the transferee of such equity interests or assets or Interest. The 
Manager shall make all filings with the Registrar as may be required in order to effect any Transfer of its 
Interest in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.
