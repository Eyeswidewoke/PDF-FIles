Special. Statement for Uncovered Option Writers 
Acritevii Na 
N4Gxxx968 
Jeffrey Epstein 
There are special risks associated with uncovered opton writing which expose the investor to potentially &gnificart loss. 
I understand that this type of strategy may not be suitable for all customers approved for options transactions. I also 
understand each of the following: 
1, The potential loss of uncovered call writing is unlimited, since there is no upper limit on a stock's price and the loss to 
a writer of an uncovered call equals the stock price minus the exercise place. The writer of an uncovered call is in an 
extremely risky position, and may incur large losses if the value of the underlying instrument increases above the 
exercise price. Such a loss can exceed the equity in the call writer's account. 
2. Tne potential loss from writing uncovered put options is also substantial. The writer of an uncovered put option bears a 
risk of loss it the value of the underlying instrument declines below the exercise price. However, since stock prices cannot 
be lower than zero, the maximum loss is equal to the strike price of the put sold less the premium received for that put, 
Such loss could be substantial if there is a significant decline in the value of the underlying instrument and can exceed the 
equity in the put writer's account. 
3. For combination writing, where the investor writes both a put and a call on the same underlyina Instrument. the 
potential risk is unlimited and can exceed the equity in the option writer's account. 
4. Uncovered option writing is thus suitable only for the knowledgeable investor who understands the risks, has the financial 
capacity and willingness to incur potentially substantial losses and has sufficient liquid assets to meet applicable margin 
requirements. In this regard, if the value of the underlying instrument moves against an uncovered writer's options 
position, the investor's broker may request significant additional margin payments. If an investor does not make such 
margin payments, the broker may liquidate stock or options positions in the investors account with little or no prior 
notice In accordance with the investors margin agreement. 
5. The option writer may not be ale to rely on the secondary marlet. If a secondary market in options were to become urevailable. 
Investors could rot engage in closing transactions, arklan option writer would remain obligated until excitation or assignment 
6. The writer of an American-style option is subject to being assigned ail exercise at any time after he has written the option 
until the option expires. By contrast, the writer of a European-style option is subject to exercise assignment only during 
the exercise period. 
NOTE: It is expected that the person(s) signing below will read the booklet entitled Characteristics and Risks of Standardized 
Options available from your broker. Particular ammtion is directed to the chapter entitled "Risks of Buying and Writing Options." This 
statement is not intended to enumerate all of the risks entailed in writing uncovered options. 
d the above statement regarding the special risks associated with uncovered option writing and 
is suitable in light of my investment objectives, which include speculation, as well as my financial 
knowledge. i understand that you will rely on the representations I have made herein and in 
Approval Form I provided to you in determining whether to approve my account for the options 
and I hereby certify the truth and accuracy of such 1s arts.
