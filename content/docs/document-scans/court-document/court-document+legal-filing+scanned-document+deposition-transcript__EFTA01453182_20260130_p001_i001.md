Portfolio Risk Mitigation Techniques (as defined below) are adhered to in respect of such 
swaps by the sixth Business Day following the date on which both parties are aware that 
representation given in Section 1.2 above was incorrect or misleading, or such later date 
as the parties agree, and to ensure the payment of any Balancing Payment Amount by the 
same day. 
1.5 
Automatic Termination Event. 
(a) 
If the remedial steps described in Section 1.4 above have not been completed in time, it 
will constitute an Additional Termination Event under the Agreement, Deemed ISDA 
Master Agreement, or Subsequent Agreement, as applicable, in respect of which the 
swap(s) for which remedial steps have not been completed will be the sole Affected 
Transaction(s) and Client will be the sole Affected Party, provided that both parties will 
be Affected Parties for the purposes of Section 6(b)(iv) of the Agreement, Deemed ISDA 
Master Agreement, or Subsequent Agreement, as applicable. 
(b) 
For the purposes of any determination pursuant to Section 6(e) the Agreement, Deemed 
ISDA Master Agreement, or Subsequent Agreement, as applicable, following the 
designation of an Early Termination Date as a result of this Section 1.5: 
(i) 
it will be deemed that Client is a non-financial counterparty to which mandatory 
clearing stipulated in EMIR does not apply (whether or not in fact this is the 
case); and 
(ii) 
where "Market Quotation" is designated as the payment measure, it will be 
deemed that Market Quotation would not produce a commercially reasonable 
result and "Loss" will apply in relation to the relevant Affected Transaction(s). 
Without prejudice to the rights, powers, remedies and privileges provided by law, neither 
the making by a party of an incorrect or misleading status representation under Section 
1.2 above nor the failure of a party to take any actions required under Section 1.4 above 
will constitute an Event of Default under the Agreement, Deemed ISDA Master 
Agreement, or Subsequent Agreement, as applicable. 
1.6 
Fc Representation. Client K IS / 5,1 IS NOT a Financial Counterparty. Client represents to DB 
(which representation is deemed repeated as of the time of each Swap Transaction Event) that: 
(a) 
It is either: (X) organized or incorporated inside the European union and is a financial 
counterparty (as defined in EMIR); or (Y) organized or incorporated outside the European Union 
and, to the best of its knowledge and belief, having given due and proper consideration to its 
status, would constitute a financial counterparty (as such term is defined in EMIR) if it were 
established in the European Union. 
(c)
