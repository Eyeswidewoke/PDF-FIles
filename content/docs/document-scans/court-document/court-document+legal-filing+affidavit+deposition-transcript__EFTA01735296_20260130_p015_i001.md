of the warrant. As for the Swedish language version, "lagforing" is the term used in the official Swedish 
language version of the Framework Decision. Mr Robertson says this is not to the point it simply indicates that 
all Swedish EAWs that use this formula are ambiguous. I cannot accept that. When the Framework Decision 
was agreed the Swedish authorities would undoubtedly have considered it and understood its meaning. A 
request for the purposes of "lagforing" is a lawful request for the purpose of the Framework Decision and the 
Extradition Act 2003. 
In these circumstances I am required to look to the warrant alone, and not to extrinsic evidence. It follows that 
the evidence I have heard and read on this question is not relevant to the decision I must make as to the validity 
of the warrant. I am sure the warrant is valid on the face of it. 
However, the fact remains that much of the material I have read and the evidence I have heard deal with this 
question. It was a central plank of the defence case. Moreover it is raised not merely in the context of section 2, 
but also as relevant to the abuse of process argument. For those reasons it would be unhelpful if I were not to 
make a finding of fact on whether Mr Assange is wanted for prosecution. 
The defence says that in the hearings on 7th and 8th February 2011, clear evidence emerged that Mr Assange was 
not wanted for prosecution in Sweden. 
1. The Svea Court of Appeal document contains an assertion by Ms Ny that: "at this time (8th 
October 2010) (Ms Ny's deputy) also informed attorney Hurtig that Julian Assange was not 
being searched for (not wanted) and that he thus scarcely risked being taken into custody if he 
landed at Arlanda (airport). It was possible for him to come in to an interrogation more 
discreetly". Mr Hurtig gave unchallenged evidence about this conversation. The prosecution 
has not pointed to anything which has changed since that discussion. 
2. Moreover, in a submission to the Svea Court of Appeal, Ms Ny refers to: "Requesting the arrest 
of Assange is in order to enable implementation of the preliminary investigation and possible 
prosecution". Possible prosecution is not the same as prosecution. It is not enough to take the 
case beyond the Ismailthreshold of being an accused person. 
3. The use by Ms Ny of the word "accused" three times in her communication of 441 February 2011 
is inaccurate. Mr Assange has not been charged or indicted in Sweden. The Svea court of 
Appeal only refers to him as being "suspected" of the offences which now appear in the EAW. 
4. Mr Alhem's evidence was that "accused" is the wrong word for Ms Ny to use in her statement. 
His evidence is that it is not possible for a decision to prosecute to have been taken at this, 
preliminary investigation, stage of the proceedings. Chapter 23, section 20 of the Swedish Code 
of Criminal Procedure reads: "Upon the conclusion of the preliminary investigation, a decision 
on whether to institute a prosecution shall be issued". As the preliminary investigation in this 
case has not yet concluded, no decision to prosecute has yet been taken. 
5. Ms Ny confirmed to the Australian ambassador in December 2010, after the EAW had been 
issued, that if a decision is made to charge Mr Assange, he and his lawyers will be granted 
access to all documents related to the case (no such decision has been made at this stage). 
6. Ms Ny cannot take a decision on prosecution, as a matter of Swedish law, because she has not 
yet asked Mr Assange to nominate witnesses, as she is required to do under section 18 chapter 
23 before closing her investigation.
