the Company that any of such representations or warranties is not true, in any material 
respect, the Company shall have the unilateral right to terminate this Subscription 
Agreement, and return my subscription price, all without liability to me. 
E. 
In making my decision to acquire any Units (or any Constituent Securities) as 
contemplated hereunder, I am relying on my own knowledge of and familiarity with the 
Company and my own independent investigation and evaluation, and no statement, 
representation or warranty has been made to me by the Company or any officer, 
employee, agent or other representative thereof other than the representations of the 
Company contained herein. Without limiting the scope or generality of the foregoing, I 
hereby represent, confirm and acknowledge that I have not received any oral 
representation or warranty from the Company or any officer, employee, agent or other 
representative of the Company with respect to the Company, its financial condition or 
prospects or any other matter relevant to my decision to enter into this Subscription 
Agreement or to purchase any Units (or any Constituent Securities), and in the event I 
have received any such oral representation or warranty, I have not relied upon any such 
oral representation or warranty. 
F. 
I understand that the purchase of any Units (or any Constituent Securities, including the 
acquisition of any Underlying Shares) involves a high degree of risk, including the possible 
loss of the entire amount of my investment in the Units (or any Constituent Securities or 
Underlying Shares) and the Company. However, I have determined that the Units (and 
the Constituent Securities) contemplated hereunder to be acquired by me and any 
Underlying Shares I may subsequently acquire are a suitable investment for me. I have 
taken full cognizance of, and understand, all of the risks related to my purchase of such 
Units (and the Constituent Securities) and any Underlying Shares I may subsequently 
acquire and my investment in the Company. I acknowledge that I have sufficient financial 
resources and experience to bear the risk of a total loss of this investment in the Company. 
I have previously invested in start-up, development stage or venture capital transactions 
and can evaluate the risks involved. I understand that the factors that may cause any 
projected or anticipated financial and business results to differ materially from actual 
results include, without limitation, the risk factors and other investment considerations 
outlined or referred to in Appendix I attached hereto. 
G. 
I understand that estimates and projections, by their nature, involve significant risks and 
uncertainties, that the Company's actual results are likely to differ materially from those 
projected in any estimates or projections as a result of various factors, including, among 
others, those referred to above, that there can be no assurance that any estimates or 
projections will be attained, and that no estimates or projections should be relied upon as a 
promise or representation of any future performance. 
I further acknowledge and 
understand that (A) any financial projections that may have been provided by or on behalf 
of the Company are simply projections of potential future financial results and are not 
intended to constitute estimates of actual future performance, particularly as actual future 
performance will be subject to events outside of the Company's control, and (B) neither
