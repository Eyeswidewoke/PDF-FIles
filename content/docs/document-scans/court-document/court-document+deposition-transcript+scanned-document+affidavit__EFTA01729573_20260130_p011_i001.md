Legislative intent, and concepts of federalism, would be undermined if interstate travel with only 
incidental sexual conduct were prosecuted. 
The nature and scope of Mr. Epstein's activities in Florida do not support the conclusion 
that any purported illicit sexual conduct was an "important" "purpose of the travel, a significant 
motivating factor", or in other words, more than merely incidental. See United States v. 
Horschauer, 2007 WL 979931 (11°' Cir. 2007) (unpublished). 
We understand from conversations with 
hat she believes that Mr. Epstein 
was and is a resident of New York, and that all trips to other homes were trips "away from 
home," undertaken for a limited period and with a specific purpose. The evidence clearly does 
not support this views
Mr. Epstein has owned a home in Florida since September, 1990 — longer than any other 
residence he has owned — when he purchased the property on El Brillo Way. He spent 
substantial amounts of money during the relevant period to improve and to maintain this home. 
In addition, his travel records demonstrate that during the relevant period Mr. Epstein both spent 
the majority of his weekends, and additional time in Florida. Although he left Florida for 
business and other projects, he consistently returned to Florida, weekend after weekend, year 
after year. Specifically, the flight logs establish that for the period 2003 - 2005 (through 
September) , there is no month when he did not spend at least one long weekend in Florida, 
including in the summer months, and that he spent well over half of all weekends in Florida.1°
Upon returning to Florida, Mr. Epstein routinely visited with various family members and 
close friends, all of whom reside or have homes in Florida, saw his primary care physician for 
checkups and prescribed tests, and frequented movie theaters and comedy clubs. Notably, during 
the relevant period, Mr. Epstein's mother took seriously ill, was often hospitalized, and 
convalesced in Florida until she died in 2004. A principal reason for Mr. Epstein's travels to 
Although the locus of one's residency for tax purposes is not conclusive on the question of where one in fact 
esides, on a number of occasions since 1995 the taxing authorities of New York State have determined that Mr. 
pstein did not spend sufficient time in New York to be considered a resident of New York for tax purposes. Since 
999, Mr. Epstein has qualified under the applicable test as a domiciliary of the United States Virgin Islands and is 
herefore entitled to the tax advantages being a domiciliary there affords. 
Mr. Epstein stopped traveling to Florida beginning in October, 2005. 
° In 2003, there were 31 multi-day trips to Florida, 29 of which were for multi-day weekends; in 200 , 37 multi-day 
ips to Florida, 36 of which were multi-day weekends; and in 2005 (nine months), 24 multi-day trips to Florida, 21 
f which were multi-day weekends.
