authenticate and deliver), in the name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more 
new Securities of the same Class of any Authorized Denomination and of like terms and a like 
aggregate principal amount. 
(d) 
Subject to this Section 2.4 and Section 2.5, at the option of the Holder, Securities 
may be exchanged for one or more Securities of the same Class (in an Authorized 
Denomination) of like terms and a like aggregate principal amount, upon surrender of the 
Securities to be exchanged at the office designated by the Trustee for such purposes. Whenever 
any Security is surrendered for exchange, the Applicable Issuer shall execute and the Trustee 
shall then authenticate and deliver the Securities that the Holder making the exchange is entitled 
to receive. 
(e) 
All Securities issued and authenticated upon any registration of transfer or 
exchange of Securities shall be the valid obligations of each Applicable Issuer, evidencing the 
same debt (to the extent they evidence debt), and entitled to the same benefits under this 
Indenture, as the Securities surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange. 
(f) 
Every Security presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange 
shall be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form 
satisfactory to each Applicable Issuer and the Indenture Registrar duly executed by the Holder 
thereof or its attorney duly authorized in writing, with such signature guaranteed by an "eligible 
guarantor institution" meeting the requirements of the Indenture Registrar, which requirements 
include membership or participation in Securities Transfer Agents Medallion Program (STAMP) 
or such other "signature guarantee program" as may be determined by the Indenture Registrar in 
addition to, or in substitution for, STAMP, all in accordance with the Exchange Act. 
(g) 
No service charge shall be made to a Holder for any registration of transfer or 
exchange of Securities, but the Trustee or Transfer Agent may require payment of a sum 
sufficient to cover the expenses of delivery (if any) not made by regular mail or any tax or other 
governmental charge payable in connection therewith. 
(h) 
The Applicable Issuer shall not be required to issue, register the transfer of or 
exchange any Security during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before the 
Trustee expects to send notice of an Optional Redemption and ending at the close of business on 
the day (if any) the Trustee (on behalf of the Issuer) determines such Optional Redemption will 
not proceed. 
(i) 
The Applicable Issuer, the Trustee and any of their respective agents may treat the 
Person in whose name any Security is registered on the Indenture Register as the owner of such 
Security on the applicable Record Date for the purpose of receiving payments on such Security 
and on any other date for all other purposes whatsoever (whether or not such payment is 
overdue), and neither the Applicable Issuer, the Trustee nor any of their respective agents shall 
be affected by notice to the contrary; provided, however, that the Depository, or its nominee, 
shall be deemed the owner of the Global Securities, and owners of beneficial interests in Global 
Securities will not be considered the owners of any Securities for the purpose of receiving 
notices.
