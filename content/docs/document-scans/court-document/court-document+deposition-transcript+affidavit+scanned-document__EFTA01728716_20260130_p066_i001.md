Sexual-victimization cases in which the child victim is not forced or threatened and 
cooperates or "consents" are more troubling and harder for society and investigators to deal with. 
If such victims were adults, there usually would not even be a crime. Although "consent" is 
supposed to be irrelevant in child-sexual-victimization cases, there are unspoken preferences in these 
cases as well. The most preferred are consent cases where the victim can explain that the 
cooperation was due to some general fear or ignorance aboui the nature of the activity. That is, the 
child was afraid to tell or did not understand what was happening. The next most preferred are cases 
where the child was tricked, duped, or indoctrinated. If the offender was an authority figure, this 
"brainwashing" concept is even more appealing. Next on this preference scale are the cases in which 
the victim was willing to trade "sex" for attention and affection. Much less acceptable are cases in 
which the child willingly traded sex for material rewards (e.g., clothes, shoes, trips) or money (Le., 
prostitution). Almost totally unacceptable are cases in which the child engaged in the sexual activity 
with an adult because the child enjoyed the sex. In fact, it is almost a sacrilege to even mention such 
a possibility. 
These societal and criminal-justice preferences prevail in spite of the fact that almost all 
human beings trade sex for attention, affection, privileges, gifts, or money. Although any of these 
reasons for compliance are possible, many seduced child victims inaccurately claim they were afraid, 
ignorant, or indoctrinated in part to meet these societal preferences for cooperation and in part to 
avoid embarrassment. Many victims are most concerned over disclosure of and therefore more likely 
to deny engaging in sex for money, bizarre sex acts, homosexual acts in which they were the 
active participant, and sex with other children. 
A young adolescent boy appearing on a television talk show focusing on the topic of sexual 
victimization of child athletes by their adult coaches was asked by the host why the abuse went on 
for so long without him telling anyone. The boy, who had been nonviolently seduced by his coach, 
answered that he was frightened of his coach. Although seemingly inconsistent with the facts, 
everyone gladly accepted and applauded his answer. What would have been the reaction of the 
television host and the audience had the boy provided more plausible answers, such as he did not tell 
because by having sex with the coach he got to play more or because he enjoyed the sex? Such 
answers are reasonable and perfectly understandable and should not change the fact that the boy was 
the victim of a crime. Maybe anticipation of society's response and not the molester is what most 
"frightened" the boy into not telling sooner. 
Any of the above scenarios in various combinations are certainly possible. A child might 
cooperate in some sexual acts and be clearly threatened or forced into others. All are crimes. The 
offender, the victim, or the intervener may perceive what constitutes compliance differently. 
Investigators and prosecutors always need to attempt to determine what actually happened, not 
attempt to confirm their preconceived beliefs about sexual victimization of children. 
Most acquaintance-exploitation cases involve these seduced or compliant victims. Although 
applicable statutes and investigative or prosecutive priorities may vary, individuals investigating 
sexual-exploitation cases must generally start from the premise that the sexual activity is not the
