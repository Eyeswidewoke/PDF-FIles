the interest thereon, shall immediately become due and payable at the sole option of Secured 
Party. 
Section 3 02 Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default, but subject always to any 
mandatory requirement of applicable law, Secured Party may, by notice to Debtor: 
(a) Take possession of all or any part of the Aircraft then subject to this Security 
Agreement and all of the rights of Debtor therein shall forthwith be surrendered to Secured Party, 
and Secured Party may by its agents, or otherwise, take possession of the Aircraft wherever 
found, with or without notice or process of law and without being responsible for any loss or 
damage, and for that purpose may enter upon any premises of Debtor without liability for suit, 
action or other proceeding by Debtor and remove the same. Secured Party, without being 
responsible for loss or damage, may hold, store and/or use, operate, manage and control the 
Aircraft, and may collect and receive all tolls, rents, revenues, issues and profits of the Aircraft 
and every part thereof; until: 
(i) the Aircraft is sold pursuant to this Section 3.02; or 
(ii) the Obligations are satisfied and paid in full, at which 
time Secured Party shall deliver to the person or persons entitled 
thereto all of the Aircraft then held by Secured Party under this 
paragraph (a) of this Section 3.02. 
(b) Secured Party shall be deemed to have exercised reasonable care in the 
custody and preservation of such of the Aircraft as may be in Secured Party's possession if 
Secured Party takes such action for that purpose as Debtor shall request in writing, provided that 
Secured Party shall not be required to take any such requested action if, in the judgment of 
Secured Party, such action would impair Secured Party's security interest in the Aircraft or its 
rights in, or the value of, the Aircraft, and provided further that such written request is received 
by Secured Party in sufficient time to permit Secured Party to take the requested action. Debtor 
acknowledges that failure of Secured Party to comply with any such request shall not of itself be 
deemed a failure to exercise reasonable care, and no failure of Secured Party to preserve or 
protect any rights with respect to the Aircraft against prior parties, or to do any act with respect 
to the preservation of the Aircraft not so requested by Debtor, shall be deemed to be a failure to 
exercise reasonable care in the custody or preservation of the Aircraft. 
(c) Secured Party may, by its agent or otherwise, sell at public auction the 
Aircraft, or any part thereof, upon such conditions as to price, terms of payment and such other 
terms of sale as Secured Party may fix. 
(d) Notice of any sale pursuant to this Section 3.02 shall state the time when, and 
the place where, such sale is to be made, shall contain a brief description of the property to be 
sold and shall be deemed reasonable if it is mailed to Debtor at least 10 days before the date of 
such sale. Such sale may be held at any place where sales or public auctions are customarily held 
in the City of Columbus, State of Ohio, or in any city or county in a state where the Aircraft to be 
sold is located.
