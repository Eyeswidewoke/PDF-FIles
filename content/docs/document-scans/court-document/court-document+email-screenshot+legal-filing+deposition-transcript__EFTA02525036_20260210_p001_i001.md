In the computational oscillator universe, energy has two forms: there is =he information contained in the oscillator 
pattern itself, which to me =ooks like its mass: how much information fluctuates in each step? (Mass =s basically 
displacement of information in time.) And there is =omentum, which is the amount of information that gets translated 
along =he computational graph. (Momentum is displacement of information in =pace.) 
If we look at the relationship between the locus of computation and the =lobal state, a number of variants are possible: 
- global calculation advances all bits in the state vector at the same =ime 
- single bit local calculation advances one one bit at a time 
- multi-local calculation has a number of individual "read/write heads" =hat weave simultaneously 
All variants can be realized so that the resulting dynamics are the =ame, which means that they would be independent 
from the perspective of =n observer. However, variants B and C could also be implemented in such = way that the 
outcome of the computation depends on the order in which =ocations of the universe are touched. I doubt that this is 
the case, =ecause it might make the universe look for stochastic than it does.

each other, and as a result, you =ight up with some periodic fluctuation, but not with an illegal state.

can itself =ompute all computable functions (Turing completeness). All functions =hat implement the universal computer 
can effectively compute the same =et of functions, but they may differ in how efficiently they can do it. =fficiency relates 
to computational complexity classes.
