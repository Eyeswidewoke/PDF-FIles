HUBUS133 Alpha Group Capital 
Administrator (other than by reason of gross negligence, willful misconduct, fraud or willful 
default on the part of the Administrator). 
The Administrator receives customary fees paid out of Partnership assets based upon the 
Partnership's net capital under management, subject to a minimum monthly fee. 
The Administrator provides substantially the same services to the Master Fund. 
CONFLICTS OF INTEREST 
The Management Company, the General Partner and their affiliates (including their 
Principals and employees) are subject, and the Partnership is exposed, to a number of actual and 
potential conflicts of interest. Any such conflict of interest could have a material adverse effect 
on the Partnership and the Limited Partners' investments therein. However, the General Partner, 
the Management Company and their affiliates have substantial incentives to see the assets of the 
Underlying Funds increase in value, and the mere existence of an actual or potential conflict of 
interest does not mean that it will be acted upon to the detriment of the Underlying Funds. When 
a conflict of interest arises, the Management Company will endeavor to ensure that the conflict is 
resolved in what it believes to be a fair and reasonable manner that is consistent with its duties to 
the Underlying Funds and the relevant Other Accounts. The Management Company has in place 
policies and procedures that it believes are reasonably designed to identify and resolve actual and 
potential conflicts of interest. Although certain potential conflicts of interest may be considered 
by the Limited Partners' Representative, Limited Partners have no means of determining whether 
these conflicts are being equitably resolved and are not represented separately by counsel. Unless 
the context indicates otherwise, references in this section to conflicts of interest that may apply to 
the Management Company should be understood to apply to the Management Company and its 
affiliates. 
Prospective Limited Partners should understand that (i) the relationships among the 
Underlying Funds, the Other Accounts, the Management Company and its affiliates are complex 
and dynamic and (ii) as the Management Company's, the General Partner's and the Underlying 
Funds' respective businesses change over time, the Management Company, the General Partner 
and their affiliates may be subject, and the Underlying Funds may be exposed, to new or additional 
conflicts of interest. There can be no assurance that this Memorandum addresses or anticipates 
every material current or future conflict of interest that may arise or that is or may be detrimental 
to the Underlying Funds or the Limited Partners. Prospective Limited Partners should consult with 
their own advisers regarding the possible implications on their investment in the Partnership of the 
conflicts of interest described in this Memorandum. 
Other Activities of the Management Company and its Affiliates 
Conflicts of interest may arise from the fact that the Management Company, the General 
Partner and their affiliates may provide investment management services to Other Accounts. The 
Partnership may, from time to time, have an interest in Other Accounts other than the Underlying 
Funds.
