equity in the account.

You can lose more funds than you deposit in the margin 
account. The firm can force the sale of securities or other assets in your account(s). The firm can sell your securities or other assets without contacting you. You are not 
entitled to choose which securities or other assets in your account(s) are liquidated or sold to meet a margin call. The firm can increase its "house" maintenance
