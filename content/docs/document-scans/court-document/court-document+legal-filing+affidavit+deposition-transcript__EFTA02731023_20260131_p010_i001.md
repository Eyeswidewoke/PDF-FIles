Additionally, the Committee requested information and documents on subsequent 
payments that were made to Epstein after 2013 on an ad hoc basis, without negotiating written 
services agreements.m This request asked for documents related to the $70 million Epstein was 
paid in 2014 and the $30 million was paid in 2015, and asked for statements of work or 
descriptions of services rendered by Epstein related to his work on the step-up-basis transaction 
and estate, tax planning, tax audits and filings, or any other work provided by Epstein. The 
Committee also requested an explanation of how compensation amounts for Epstein were 
decided in payments made on an ad hoc basis where no formal services agreement was 
negotiated. 
At every stage of the Committee's investigation, you have refused to answer these 
questions or provide any documents related to how Epstein's compensation was determined or 
justified. First, you refused to answer the questions regarding Epstein's compensation included in 
the Committee's letter submitted on June 22, 2022. Following a briefing with Committee staff 
and your outside counsel on August 1, 2022, Committee staff submitted a second set of questions 
regarding Epstein's compensation scheme." These questions also inquired about advice Epstein 
provided in relation to your private art collection, which your outside counsel confirmed in a 
briefing has a value of more than $1 billion. Again, you refused to provide answers to those 
questions. 
Subsequently, Committee staff met with your outside counsel at Paul Weiss and 
Brownstein at the Finance Committee's offices, where your counsel again reiterated your 
unwillingness to cooperate with any requests related to Epstein's compensation scheme, 
including information on how Epstein's compensation was determined and evidence 
substantiating the services he provided on tax and estate planning matters. They also reiterated 
that you were unwilling to describe to the Committee how these payments were categorized for 
tax purposes. 
Arrangement with Epstein raises concerns of whether such amounts represented services 
income or a gift 
The Committee remains deeply concerned by your continued refusal to substantiate and 
explain Epstein's compensation scheme. The lack of transparency surrounding payments to 
Epstein, the extraordinary amount of such payments, the apparent lack of a formal services 
agreement, and the fact that you apparently did not claim such compensation as a tax-deductible 
expense raises questions about whether such payments would be properly characterized as a 
taxable gift, or as payment for services rendered. The Dechert report states that you retained 
36 Id. at pg. 16: "Starting in 2014, Black began to pay Epstein for his ongoing services on an ad hoc basis, without 
negotiating written service agreements. In total, Black paid Epstein $70 million in 2014 and $30 million in 2015. Of 
these amounts, Black attributed $20 million to Epstein's work on the step-up basis transaction and attributed the 
remainder to the various other matters including his advice about estate, tax planning, tax audits, and filings, 
managing Black's artwork, Family Office management, and advice regarding Black's yacht and airplane as set forth 
above."
