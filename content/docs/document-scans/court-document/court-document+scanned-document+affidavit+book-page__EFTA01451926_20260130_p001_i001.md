Disclosure and Privacy 
Unless otherwise specified, by executing a Subscription Agreement, Investors agree and 
consent to the Onshore Feeder Fund (or the Offshore Feeder Fund, as applicable) and the 
Investment Manager disclosing their names and other information to U.S. and non-U.S. 
regulators, government agencies and instrumentalities upon their request or order. In 
addition, Investors in the Onshore Feeder Fund and the Offshore Feeder Fund should 
carefully review the following information and the Subscription Agreement and the LP 
Agreements, as the case may be, regarding the privacy policies set forth therein. In 
addition, a valid Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 submitted by each Limited Partner to 
the Onshore Feeder Fund or a valid Internal Revenue Service Form W-8 or W-9 submitted 
by each Limited Partner to the Offshore Feeder Fund may be delivered to the relevant 
agents of the Master Fund and/or investment funds of the Master Fund. A Limited Partner 
will also be required to comply with procedures as may be required under the provisions of 
the new rules related to FATCA provisions of the HIRE Act, and will be required to 
provide information to the Onshore Feeder Fund or the Offshore Feeder Fund, including in 
the case of a non-U.S. Limited Partner, information regarding certain U.S. direct and 
indirect owners of the Limited Partner. The failure of a Limited Partner to comply with 
these provisions may result in withholding on payments to the Limited Partner or other 
adverse consequences applying to such Limited Partner, including pursuant to the LP 
Agreements. 
The Feeder Funds and the Investment Manager do not disclose nonpublic personal 
information about Investors or former Investors to third parties other than as described 
herein or in the Subscription Agreement or the LP Agreements. The General Partner and 
the Investment Manager maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect 
each Investor's nonpublic personal information. They collect information about Investors 
(such as the Investor's name, address, social security number, assets and income) from 
their discussions with the Investor and from documents that the Investor may deliver to 
them. In order to provide the Investors with such services the Feeder Funds and the 
Investment Manager may provide Investors' personal information to affiliates and to firms 
that provide assistance in servicing the Feeder Funds and that have a need for such 
information, such as a broker, custodian, administrator or other service provider. They 
require third party service providers and financial institutions with which they have 
relationships to protect the confidentiality of Investors' information and to use the 
information only for the purposes for which the information is disclosed. They do not 
otherwise provide information about Investors to outside firms, organizations or 
individuals except (i) to their attorneys, accountants, administrators, marketers and 
auditors and as permitted by law, (ii) for purposes of tax reporting and withholding and (iii) 
as required by regulatory authorities or law enforcement officials who have jurisdiction 
over the Feeder Funds or as otherwise required by applicable law. 
The Feeder Funds and the Investment Manager restrict access to nonpublic personal 
information about Investors to their employees and affiliates with a legitimate business 
need for the information. In particular, the General Partner and the Investment Manager 
may from time to time share information about Investors with affiliates of the Investment 
Manager for the purposes of: (i) supervising and supporting the management of the
