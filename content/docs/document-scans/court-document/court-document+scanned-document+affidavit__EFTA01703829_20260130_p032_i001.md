benefits will be available on a pro rata basis determined by days for Multi-day Tickets and by series length for Season Tickets. 
Benefits are only eligible for the Ticketholder who experienced a loss for which this Plan provides benefits. You will be reimbursed only for 
those Tickets and on a pro rata basis. 
Right of Recovery 
in the event of a payment under this Plan, We are entitled, and become subrogated, to the extent of such payment, to all of the Ticketholders 
rights and remedies against any responsible party. Upon Our request, the Ticketholder must provide us reasonable assistance, including 
signing documents if necessary, to bring suit in the Ticketholder's name and do nothing after loss to harm Our rights. When You have been 
paid under this Plan by Us and the Ticketholder recovers from another, the amount recovered shall be held in trust for Us and reimbursed to Us 
to the extent of Our payment. If Our payments for losses exceed the maximum amount payable to You under any benefit of this Plan, We 
have the right to recover any amount exceeding the maximum amount payable.
