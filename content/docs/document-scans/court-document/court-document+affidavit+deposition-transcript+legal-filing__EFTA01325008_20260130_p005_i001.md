FN2. In its first counterclaim, Fisher seeks a declaration that the sublease is 
valid and that Fisher is lawfully entitled to full possession and use of the premises. In 
its second counterclaim, Fisher seeks a declaration that the sublease was 
automatically renewed for a five-year term, commencing January 31, 1997, because 
Epstein properly exercised his right of first refusal. 
In February of 1997, Epstein commenced a holdover proceeding in the Civil 
Court of the City of New York against Fisher for nonpayment of rent under the terms of 
the sublease. Fisher removed the state court action to this Court. 
The Government moved for partial summary judgment on its claim for ejectment 
of Epstein and Fisher. In addition, it sought an order requiring Epstein and Fisher to 
pay into an escrow fund $15,000 per month from August 23, 1996 to the date this 
action is finally decided. Epstein cross-moved against Fisher to remand its holdover 
action to state court, and Fisher cross-moved against Epstein for consolidation of the 
holdover action with the pending federal action. 
I heard oral argument on the motions on December 17, 1997. Collectively, 
Epstein and Fisher asserted four arguments in opposition to the Govemment's motion 
for summary judgment. [FN3] They contend that there are genuine issues of material 
fad as to whether the Government properly terminated the lease entered into between 
OFM and Epstein. Specifically, they argue, factual questions exists as to (1) whether 
the Government waived Epstein's alleged default of the lease by accepting rent after 
the Government became aware that Fisher was occupying the premises; (2) whether 
the OFM-Epstein lease permitted oral approval of an assignment or sublease (i.e., 
whether the Assignment and Sublet Clause is ambiguous on the issue of whether an 
assignment or sublet could be approved orally); (3) whether OFM in fact orally 
approved the sublease to Fisher, and (4) whether the Government breached an 
obligation of good faith and fair dealing inherent in its lease with Epstein by 
unreasonably withholding written approval of a sublet to Fisher, assuming the Court 
holds as a matter of law that oral approval was not permitted by the lease. 
FN3. Technically, Epstein asserted only the first argument, and Fisher asserted 
all four arguments. Epstein is no longer occupying the Premises, but still has an 
interest in the Court's decision as to whether OFM properly terminated its lease with 
Epstein. Moreover, Fishers rights as subtenant derive from Epstein's rights as 
overtenant, for if I decide as a matter of law that the lease was properly terminated on 
August 23, 1996, neither Epstein nor Fisher has any right to occupy the Premises 
beyond that date. Thus, I will treat all four arguments in opposition to the 
Government's motion as though they were asserted by Epstein and Fisher jointly. 
At the conclusion of the argument, I resolved several of the issues pertaining to 
these motions on the record. As an initial matter, I denied Epstein's motion to remand 
and granted Fishers motion to consolidate. I then addressed the Government's motion 
for summary judgment and its application concerning the creation of an escrow fund. 
I granted summary judgment in favor of the Government on Epstein's and 
Fishers waiver argument, holding that "no reasonable fact finder could conclude from 
[the] undisputed facts and the sequence of events, including the acceptance of rent
