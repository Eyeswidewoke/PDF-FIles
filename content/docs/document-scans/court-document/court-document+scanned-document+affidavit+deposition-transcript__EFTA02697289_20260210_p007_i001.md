resources available to the beneficiaries as actually known to the 
Trustees and the immediate and long-term tax impact of any 
distribution. The corporate Trustee's adjustment power shall continue 
in the event California law changes as it relates to the general 
provisions and fiduciary duties under the California Uniform Principal 
and Income Act (Probate Code Sections 16335-16339, inclusive and 
such provisions are incorporated herein by reference). Implicit in the 
foregoing, and intended by the Trustors, is the authority of the 
Trustees to vary the amount of income to be paid to or for the benefit 
of any of the beneficiaries, and to withhold payments from all of them 
or from one or more of them. Any income not distributed may be 
accumulated and from time to time added to the principal of each 
Trust, in the Trustees' sole and absolute discretion. In no event shall 
total distributions from the GST Exempt Trust and the GST Non-
Exempt Trust in any year exceed Aggregate Income of the Trusts (as 
defined above) for such year. or iht 3°10 t 6i
