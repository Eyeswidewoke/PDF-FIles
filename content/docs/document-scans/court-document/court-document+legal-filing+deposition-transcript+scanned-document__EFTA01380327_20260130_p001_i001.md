(b) subject to clause (c) below, the Mobileye Board will have determined to effect an Adverse 
Recommendation Change or to terminate the Purchase Agreement in order to enter into the alternative 
acquisition agreement. and Mobileye will have: 
provided Intel and Purchaser four business days' prior written notice, which will state expressly: 
• that Mobileye has received a Superior Proposal. and 
the material terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal (including the consideration 
offered therein and the identity of the person or group making the Superior Proposal): and 
• contemporaneously provided an unredacted copy of the alternative acquisition agreement and all 
other documents (other than immaterial documents) related to the Superior Proposal (it being 
understood and agreed that any amendment to the financial terms or any other material term or 
condition of such Superior Proposal will require a new notice and a new four business day 
period); and 
prior to making such an Adverse Recommendation Change or terminating the Purchase 
Agreement. to the extent requested by Intel and Purchaser, engaged in good faith negotiations 
with Intel and Purchaser during such four business day period to amend the Purchase Agreement 
in such a manner that the alternative acquisition agreement ceases to constitute a Superior 
Proposal; and 
(c) the Mobileye Board will have determined, in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal 
counsel and financial advisors. that, in light of such Superior Proposal and taking into account any 
revised terms proposed by Intel and Purchaser, such Superior Proposal continues to constitute a 
Superior Proposal and that the failure to make such Adverse Recommendation Change or to so 
terminate the Purchase Agreement. as applicable, would be inconsistent with Mobileye's directors' 
fiduciary duties under the laws of The Netherlands. 
In addition, the Mobileye Board may, at any time prior to the Expiration Time, make an Adverse 
Recommendation Change or authorize, resolve, agree or publicly propose to take any such action upon the 
occurrence of an Intervening Event (as defined below) only if all of the following conditions are met:

provided Intel and Purchaser four business days' prior written notice, which will: 
• 
set forth in reasonable detail information describing the Intervening Event and the rationale 
for the Adverse Recommendation Change; and 
• 
state expressly that, subject to clause (ii) below, the Mobileye Board has determined to effect 
an Adverse Recommendation Change; and 
prior to making such an Adverse Recommendation Change. to the extent requested by Intel and 
Purchaser, engaged in good faith negotiations with Intel and Purchaser during such four business 
day period to amend the Purchase Agreement in such a manner that the failure of the Mobileye 
Board to make an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to the Intervening Event in 
accordance with clause (ii) below would no longer be inconsistent with Mobileye's directors' 
fiduciary duties under the laws of The Netherlands: and 
(b) the Mobileye Board will have determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel 
and financial advisors, that in light of such Intervening Event and taking into account any revised terms 
proposed by Intel and Purchaser, the failure to make an Adverse Recommendation Change would be 
inconsistent with Mobileye's directors' fiduciary duties under the applicable laws of The Netherlands. 
For purposes of the Purchase Agreement. the term "Intervening Event" means an event, development or 
change in circumstances occurring, arising, or first coming to the attention of the Mobileye Board after the date
