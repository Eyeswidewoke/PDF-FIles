Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 
The Company reviews property and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets for impairment when events or circumstances indicate 
these assets may not be recoverable. Factors considered include, significant underperformanec relative to expected historical or projected future 
operating results, significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business and significant negative 
industry or economic trends. The recoverability is assessed by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the undiscounted cash flows expected to 
be generated by the asset. If impairment exists, the amount of impairment is measured as the excess of the carrying amount over the estimated fair 
value, as determined by each location's projected future discounted cash flows. This assessment process requires the use of estimates and 
assumptions regarding future cash flows and estimated useful lives, which arc subject to a significant degree of judgment. If these assumptions 
change in the future, the Company may be required to record impairment charges for these assets. The Company did not record any impairment 
related to long-lived assets in any of the periods presented. 
Goodwill 
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of the acquired business over the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
resulting from the acquisition. Goodwill is not amortized. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment during the fourth quarter, or more frequently 
should an event occur or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired. Such events or circumstances may be a significant 
change in business climate, economic and industry• trends. legal factors, negative operating performance indicators, significant competition, 
changes in strategy or disposition of a reporting unit or a portion thereof. The Company has identified two reporting units, Brazil and the United 
States, based on the geography of the Company's operations to which goodwill is attributable. 
The impairment evaluation for goodwill is conducted annually using a two-step process. In the first step, the fair value of each reporting unit 
is compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including goodwill. The estimated fair value of the reporting unit is determined on the 
basis of discounted future cash flows. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit, then a 
second step must be completed in order to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment that should be recorded. In the second step, the 
implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is determined by allocating the reporting unit's fair value to all of its assets and liabilities other 
than goodwill in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation. The resulting implied fair value of die goodwill that results from the application of 
this second step is then compared to the carrying amount of the goodwill and an impairment charge is recorded for any excess or carrying value 
over fair value. No impairment to goodwill was recorded during any of the periods presented. 
Intangible Assets 
Indefinite-lived intangible assets arc not amortized, but are tested for impairment annually during the fourth quarter. or more frequently if 
circumstances indicate potential impairment, through a comparison of fair value to its carrying amount. The estimated fair value is determined on 
the basis of discounted future cash flows. If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount of the indefinite-lived intangible asset, then an 
impairment charge is recorded to reduce the asset to its estimated fair value. The indefinite-lived intangible assets relate to the assigned value of the 
Fogo de Chao trade name. 
Definite-lived intangible assets consist of non-compete agreements. The non-compete agreements are amortized over 5 years, which is the 
term of the agreements, and are measure., for impairment when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may be impaired in the same 
manner as long-lived assets. 
The Company did not record any impairment related to intangible assets in any of the periods presented.
