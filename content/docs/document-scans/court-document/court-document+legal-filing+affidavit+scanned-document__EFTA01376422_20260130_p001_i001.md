notice of any event which is in fact such an Event of Default or Default is received by the 
Trustee at the Corporate Trust Office, and such notice references the Notes generally, the Issuer, 
the Co-Issuer, the Collateral or this Indenture. For purposes of determining the Trustee's 
responsibility and liability hereunder, whenever reference is made in this Indenture to such an 
Event of Default or a Default, such reference shall be construed to refer only to such an Event of 
Default or Default of which the Trustee is deemed to have notice as described in this Section 6.1. 
(e) 
Whether or not therein expressly so provided, every provision of this 
Indenture relating to the conduct or affecting the liability of or affording protection to the Trustee 
shall be subject to the provisions of this Section 6.1. 
Section 6.2 
Notice of Default. 
Promptly (and in no event later than 3 Business Days) after the occurrence of any 
Default known to the Trustee or after any declaration of acceleration has been made or delivered 
to the Trustee pursuant to Section 5.2, the Trustee shall transmit by mail to the Collateral 
Manager, each Rating Agency, each Noteholder, as their names and addresses appear on the 
Register, and the Irish Stock Exchange, for so long as any Class of Securities is listed on the Irish 
Stock Exchange and so long as the rules of such exchange so require, notice of all Defaults 
hereunder known to the Trustee, unless such Default shall have been cured or waived; provided, 
that the Issuer shall notify S&P of any such Default, even if waived. 
Section 6.3 
Certain Rights of Trustee. 
Except as otherwise provided in Section 6.1: 
(a) 
the Trustee may rely and shall be protected in acting or refraining from 
acting upon any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, 
direction, consent, order, note or other paper or document believed by it to be genuine and to 
have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties; 
(b) 
any request or direction of the Issuer or the Co-Issuer mentioned herein 
shall be sufficiently evidenced by an Issuer Request or Issuer Order, as the case may be; 
(c) 
whenever in the administration of this Indenture the Trustee shall (i) deem 
it desirable that a matter be proved or established prior to taking, suffering or omitting any action 
hereunder, the Trustee (unless other evidence be herein specifically prescribed) may, in the 
absence of bad faith on its part, rely upon an Officer's certificate or (ii) be required to determine 
the value of any Collateral or funds hereunder or the cash flows projected to be received 
therefrom, the Trustee may, in the absence of bad faith on its part, rely on reports of nationally 
recognized accountants, investment bankers or other persons qualified to provide the information 
required to make such determination, including nationally recognized dealers in securities of the 
type being valued and securities quotation services; 
(d) 
as a condition to the taking or omitting of any action by it hereunder, the 
Trustee may consult with counsel and the advice of such counsel or any Opinion of Counsel shall 
be full and complete authorization and protection in respect of any action taken or omitted by it 
hereunder in good faith and in reliance thereon;
