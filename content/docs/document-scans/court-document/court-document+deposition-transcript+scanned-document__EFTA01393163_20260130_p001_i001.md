2. 
The sources of price information used to price 
credit default options are subject to a lack of transparency 
and. at times. illiquid markets. This is attributable to, among 
other things: (1) the absence of last sale information and the 
limited availability of quotations for the reference oblige-
tion(s). (2) lack of ready availability of information on related 
products traded primarily in the over-the-counter market, 
and (3) the fact that related over-Me-counter market credit 
derivative transactions are privately negotiated and may not 
be made public in a timely fashion or at all. 
3. 
Dealers in the underlying debt securities and in 
the over-the-counter credit derivatives markets have access 
to private quotation networks that give actual current bids 
and offers of other dealers. This information is not available 
to most investors. As a result, these dealers may have an 
advantage over participants with regard to credit default 
options. 
4. 
If the listing options market determines that a 
credit default option is subject to a redemption event (i.e.. 
the issuer or guarantor pays off the reference obligation), the 
option will expire worthless unless a credit event has been 
confirmed to have occurred prior to the effective date of the 
redemption event. As a result, purchasers of such options 
will lose their premium since there is no chance of occur-
rence of a credit event for the reference entity. On the other 
hand. if a redemption event occurs but a credit event Is 
confirmed to have occurred prior to the effective dale of the 
redemption event. a seller would be obligated to pay the 
cash settlement amount even though a holder of the refer-
ence obligation may not incur a loss. 
5. 
Since succession events are determined by the 
listing options market, credit default options may be modi-
fied to specify a different reference entity or several different 
reference entities. As a result, there may be new reference 
obligations that have higher or lower credit quality than the 
original reference obligation. In addition, other factors may 
exist that could affect the likelihood of the occurrence of a 
credit event. As a result, the occurrence of a succession 
event could affect the price of these options. Moreover, since 
the listing options market determines whether a succession 
event occurred and the adjustment resulting from such an 
event, the adjustment made to these options may be at 
variance with the treatment given to the same succession 
event with respect to related credit derivative products. 
6. 
The occurrence of a credit event must be con-
f►med by the listing options market. This means that there 
will be a lag time between the actual occurrence of a credit 
event and the listing options market's confirmation of the 
credit event. Rules of the options market may provide a 
specified time period (e.g.. four business days) between the 
end of the covere
d and the expiration date for a series 
of credit default options to allow the options market to con-
firm whether a credit event occurred during the covered 
period. There is a risk, however, that the sources used to 
monitor a credit event may not identify and report a credit 
event in a timely fashion. For example, it is possible that a 
credit event could occur on the last day of trading, but the 
sources which report the occurrence of a credit event do not
