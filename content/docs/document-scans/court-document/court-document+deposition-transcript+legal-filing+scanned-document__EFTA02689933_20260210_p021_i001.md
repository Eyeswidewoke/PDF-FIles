Form of the Shares 
4.6 
The Shares are issued and will remain in registered form (actions nominatives) only. The Shares are 
not represented by certificates. 
4.7 
The register of the Shareholders will be kept by the Administrator on behalf of the Company, and the 
register (and the Shareholders' personal date contained therein) will be available for inspection by any 
Shareholder. The register will contain the name of each owner of registered Shares, his residence or 
elected domicile as indicated to the Company and the number and Class of Shares held by it and the 
Transfer of Shares and the dates of such Transfers. The ownership of the Shares will be established by 
the entry in this register. 
4.8 
Each Investor shall provide the Company with an address, fax number and email address to which all 
notices and announcements may be sent. Such address shall also be entered into the register of 
Investors. Investors may, at any time, change their address as entered into the register of Investors by 
way of a written notification sent to the Company. 
4.9 
The Company will recognise only one holder per Share. In case a Share is held by more than one 
person, the Company has the right to suspend the exercise of all rights attached to that Share until one 
person has been appointed as sole owner in relation to the Company. The same rule shall apply in the 
case of conflict between a usufruct holder (usufruitier) and a bare owner (nu-proprielaire) or between 
a pledgor and a pledgee. 
4.10 
Without prejudice to Section 9 of this General Section, title to Shares in registered form is transferred 
upon registration of the name of the transferee in the share register of the Company. 
4.11 
Each Share is entitled to one vote at the relevant General Meeting. Shares shall have no pre-emptive 
subscription rights. All Shareholders have the right to vote at each General Meeting. This vote can be 
exercised in person or by proxy. No resolution of the General Meeting with a view to take a decision 
affecting the interests of the Company vis-a-vis third parties, to amend the Articles or to revoke and 
replace the General Partner may be taken without the affirmative vote of the General Partner. 
4.12 
The Company's share capital is at all times equal to its NAV. The Company's share capital is 
automatically adjusted when additional Shares are issued or outstanding Shares are redeemed, and no 
special announcements or publicity are necessary in relation thereto. 
4.13 
The General Partner shall hold the Management Share(s) that is(are) reserved to the General Partner, 
in its capacity as unlimited Shareholder (actionnaire Oran: commandite) of the Company. The 
Company intends to issue at least one Management Share in each Compartment. 
4.14 
With the exception of the Management Share, fractional Shares will be issued to the nearest 
thousandth of a Share, and such fractional Shares will not be entitled to vote (except where their 
number is so that they represent a whole Share, in which case they confer a voting right) but will be 
entitled to a participation in the net results and in the proceeds of liquidation attributable to the relevant 
Class on a pro rata basis. 
4.15 
Unless otherwise provided for in the relevant Special Section, the Company may agree to issue Shares 
as consideration for a contribution in kind of securities or other assets, provided that such securities or 
other assets comply with its investment objectives and strategy of the relevant Compartment and are in 
compliance with Luxembourg Law. Any costs incurred in connection with a contribution in kind will 
be borne by the relevant Investor.
