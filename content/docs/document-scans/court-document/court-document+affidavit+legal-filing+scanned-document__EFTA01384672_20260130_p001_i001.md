HUBUS133 Alpha Group Capital 
Limited Liquidity 
An investment in the Partnership is suitable only for sophisticated investors who do not 
require immediate liquidity for their investment. An investment in the Partnership provides limited 
liquidity since the Interests are not freely transferable and, absent a waiver by the General Partner in 
its discretion, a Partner, generally upon at least 65 days' prior written notice to the General Partner, 
may generally only withdraw the amount permitted under the Applicable Percentage limit on any 
Withdrawal Date. 
Further, distributions of proceeds upon a withdrawal by a Partner may be limited, in the sole 
discretion of the General Partner where, in the view of the General Partner, the disposal of all or a 
part of an Underlying Fund's assets to meet withdrawal requests would be prejudicial to the non-
withdrawing Partners. Under the foregoing circumstances, and under other circumstances deemed 
appropriate by the General Partner, a Limited Partner may receive in-kind distributions from an 
Underlying Fund's portfolio, if permitted by law, and such in-kind distributions may be comprised 
of, among other things, interests in special purpose vehicles holding the actual investment or of 
participations in the actual investment which will remain held by the Underlying Fund. Such 
investments so distributed may not be readily marketable or saleable and may have to be held by 
such investor for an indefinite period of time. The risk of loss and delay in liquidating these 
investments will be borne by the Limited Partner, with the result that such Limited Partner may 
receive less cash than it would have received on the date of withdrawal. (See "Limitations on 
Transferability; Suitability Requirements.") 
Additional Risks Created by Internal Investments 
Since the portfolio manager managing the investment strategy (or a sub-strategy to the 
extent there are multiple investment strategies managed by a particular portfolio manager) pursued 
with respect to a particular PM Tranche, members of such portfolio manager's team, a family 
member of such persons and certain other persons associated with the Management Company 
and/or trusts or other entities for the aforementioned parties' benefit may be permitted to invest in 
such PM Tranche of the Partnership or an Underlying Fund, there may be more capital supporting 
a particular investment strategy than would have been the case if such persons were only permitted 
to hold Interests other than such PM Tranche. As a result, if there are profits with respect to a 
particular PM Tranche, such profits will be disproportionally allocated to the PM Tranche and the 
other Interests in the Partnership may have less profits from such investment strategy allocated to 
them absent the existence of the PM Tranche, especially to the extent such strategy is capacity 
constrained. Conversely, if there are losses with respect to a particular PM Tranche that exceed 
the assets associated with such PM Tranche's investment strategy, and such strategy is leveraged 
(which may be the case for the Management Company's strategies), losses in such PM Tranche in 
excess of aggregate balances of the Capital Accounts attributable to such PM Tranche will be 
allocated among the other Interests in the Partnership, thereby increasing the losses borne by the 
investors who do not hold such PM Tranche. Prospective investors should recognize that this 
presents the possibility that, in certain circumstances, losses attributable to a particular PM Tranche 
may be borne by investors who hold Interests in the Partnership that were not intended to be 
exposed to such PM Tranche.
