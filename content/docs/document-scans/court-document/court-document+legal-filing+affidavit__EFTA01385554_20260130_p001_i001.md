2. Re-use Risks and Consequences 
a) Where you provide financial instruments to us under a title transfer collateral arrangement 
or if we exercise a right of use in relation to any financial instruments that you have 
provided to us by way of collateral under a security collateral arrangement containing a 
right of use, we draw your attention to the following Re-use Risks and Consequences:' 
i. your rights, including any proprietary rights that you may have had, in those 
financial instruments will be replaced by an unsecured contractual claim for 
delivery of equivalent financial instruments subject to the terms of the relevant 
Collateral Arrangement; 
ii. those financial instruments will not be held by us in accordance with client asset 
rules, and, if they had benefited from any client asset protection rights, those 
protection rights will not apply (for example, the financial instruments will not be 
segregated from our assets and will not be held subject to a trust): 
iii. in the event of our insolvency or default under the relevant agreement your claim 
against us for delivery of equivalent financial instruments will not be secured and 
will be subject to the terms of the relevant Collateral Arrangement and applicable 
law and, accordingly, you may not receive such equivalent financial instruments or 
recover the full value of the financial instruments (although your exposure may be 
reduced to the extent that you have liabilities to us which can be set off or netted 
against or discharged by reference to our obligation to deliver equivalent financial 
instruments to you); 
iv. in the event that a resolution authority exercises its powers under any relevant 
resolution regime in relation to us any rights you may have to take any action 
against us, such as to terminate our agreement, may be subject to a stay by the 
relevant resolution authority and: 
a) your claim for delivery of equivalent financial instruments may be reduced 
(in part or in full) or converted into equity; or 
b) a transfer of assets or liabilities may result in your claim on us, or our claim 
on you, being transferred to different entities 
although you may be protected to the extent that the exercise of resolution powers 
is restricted by the availability of set-off or netting rights: 
v. as a result of your ceasing to have a proprietary interest in those financial 
instruments you will not be entitled to exercise any voting, consent or similar rights 
attached to the financial instruments, and even if we have agreed to exercise 
voting, consent or similar rights attached to any equivalent financial instruments in 
accordance with your instructions or the relevant Collateral Arrangement entitles 
you to notify us that the equivalent financial instruments to be delivered by us to 
you should reflect your instructions with respect to the subject matter of such vote, 
consent or exercise of rights, in the event that we do not hold and are not able to 
readily obtain equivalent financial instruments, we may not be able to comply 
(subject to any other solution that may have been agreed between the parties); 
As noted above, Appendix 3 sets forth the risks and consequences that may arise in connection with re-use of 
financial instruments by a U.S. broker-dealer. U.S. futures commission merchant, or U.S. bank or U.S. branch or 
agency office of a non-U.S. bank.
