To the extent legally permissible, orders may be combined for the Partnership and all 
other funds and accounts managed by the Investment Manager and its affiliates, and if any order 
is not filled at a single price, the order may be allocated among such funds and accounts on an 
average price basis. 
Valuation 
The General Partner has discretion in determining the value of certain of the 
Partnership's investments. While the value of most marketable securities is based on prices 
reported in the public markets, at times, the size of a block of securities held by the Partnership 
or temporary restrictions on resale may justify imposing a discount on the market-determined 
value. 
Whether and how much to reduce the value of such securities in any of these 
circumstances is subject to the General Partner's sole discretion. In addition, a portion of the 
Partnership's assets may be invested in restricted securities. To the extent that the Partnership 
makes such investments, the value of those investments will be determined in the General 
Partner's sole discretion. 
The General Partner will face a conflict of interest in making any of these valuation 
decisions, as the Incentive Allocation allocable to the General Partner is based directly on the net 
asset value of the Partnership. 
Master-Feeder Fund 
The General Partner, in its discretion, may at any time convert the Partnership into a 
"feeder fund" in a master-feeder fund structure whereby the Partnership's investment program 
will be carried out by an master fund (likely to be an offshore vehicle) in which the Partnership is 
an equity holder. In such event, the Partnership will bear its pro rata share of such master fund's 
expenses. 
BROKERAGE COMMISSIONS; TURNOVER 
In selecting brokers to effect portfolio transactions for the Partnership, the Investment 
Manager and the Portfolio Managers will consider such factors as price, the ability of the brokers 
to effect the transactions, the brokers' facilities, reliability and financial responsibility and the 
provision or payment (or the rebate to the Partnership for payment) of the costs of property or 
services (e.g., short term custodial services, research services, news and quotation services, 
certain publications and other brokerage and research products and services). Accordingly, if the 
Investment Manager or a Portfolio Manager determines in good faith that the amount of 
commissions charged by a broker is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and 
products or services provided by such broker, the Partnership may pay commissions to such 
broker in an amount greater than the amount another broker might charge. 
The use of commission or "soft" dollars to pay for research products or services falls 
within the safe harbor for soft dollars created by Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 
1934, as amended. Under Section 28(e), research obtained with soft dollars generated by the 
Partnership may be used by the Investment Manager or a Portfolio Manager to service accounts 
other than the Partnership. Generally, where a product or service obtained with commission 
dollars provides both research and non-research assistance to the Investment Manager or a
