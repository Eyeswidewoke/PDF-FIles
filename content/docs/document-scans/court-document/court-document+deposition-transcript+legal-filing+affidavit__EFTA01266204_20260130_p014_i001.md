Beneficiary's misconduct, caused to be terminated, said Beneficiary's employment with or provision of 
services to my estate or said real property or entity or HBRK Associates, Inc. or any entity owned by

In order to provide for the continued and uninterrupted maintenance and 
operation of the assets in my Trust Estate following my death, the Trustees shall ensure that all 
persons who were employed by, or provided services to, me or any entity directly or indirectly owned 
by me or HBRK Associates, Inc. or any entity owned by Darren K. Indyke, shall continue to be so 
employed or to so provide such services for a period of two (2) years following the date of my death; 
provided, however, that the Trustees shall have the right terminate the employment or the 
engagement of any such employees or service providers if and at such times as the Trustees determine 
in their discretion that there is cause for such termination. For purposes of this Section 2.5 of this 
Article II, cause for such termination shall include, without limitation, physical or mental incapacity, 
intentional misconduct, insubordination, breach of duty, disloyalty, dishonesty, fraud, embezzlement, 
theft, abusive or inappropriate workplace behavior, substance abuse, criminal misconduct (whether or 
not pertaining to the assets in the Trust Estate), decrease or cessation of the need for employment or 
services, or any other circumstances causing the Trustees to determine in their discretion that there is 
cause for such termination. The obligation of the Trustees to ensure such continued employment or 
provision of services shall include, without limitation, payment out of the assets of the Trust Estate 
for the costs and expenses of all items of compensation, remuneration and benefits as shall then be in 
effect at the then current rates and in the then current amounts immediately prior to my death. 
C. 
The provisions of this Section 2.5 of this Article II shall not apply to the 
Trustees so long as they continue to serve as the Trustees hereunder.

Any trust property that is real property, that is renounced or disclaimed by KARYNA SHULIAK and 
including, but not limited to, improvements, fixtures, permits and other 
rights of and pertaining to such real property, held directly by me, or indirectly through ownership of 
shares of capital stock of a corporation or membership interests in a limited liability company of which 
I was the sole beneficial owner prior to my death, shall be sold by the Trustees and the proceeds 
thereof held in said trust as soon as is reasonably practicable following my death. In marketing and 
effectuating the sale of said real property, the Trustees shall be guided as nearly as the Trustees 
determine in their discretion is possible or appropriate under the then prevailing circumstances by my 
last express wishes with respect to the sale of said real property, as shall be contained in the last writing 
signed by me and notarized and delivered to at least one of the Trustees prior to my death. The 
proceeds of said sales shall be distributed in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.4.
