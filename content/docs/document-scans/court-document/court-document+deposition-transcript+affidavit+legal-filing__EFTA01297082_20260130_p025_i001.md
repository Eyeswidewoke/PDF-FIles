2014 V.I. LEXIS 45, *; 61 V.I. 13, ** 
parties. As its name suggests, equitable distribution does not necessarily mean "equal," 
only "equitable." 
Family Law > Marital Duties & Rights > 12toaerty Rights > Homestead Rights 
[HN2I Pursuant to V.I. Code Ann. tit. 33, §=(a). a homestead is defined as the abode 
including land and buildings, owned by, and actually occupied by, a person, or by 
members of his family free of rental charges. Although the Virgin Islands Code does not 
expressly define a marital homestead, both the United States Court of Appeals for the 
Third Circuit and the Appellate Division of the United States District Court for the Virgin 
Islands have interpreted § 
(a), (c) to hold that a "marital homestead" is any 
homestead in which a husband and wife both reside during the marriage and that is owned 
by one or both of the spouses.

[HN3I The court may distribute personal property in accordance with V.I. Code Ann. tit. 16, 
§ 109(4). However, the statute does not define marital property. Whether an asset is 
marital property or separate property for purposes of distribution of the marital estate is a 
matter reserved to the sound discretion of the trial court. Once these distinctions have 
been made, the trial judge has broad equitable powers in disposing of marital property.

Property Distribution > Characterization > Marital Property 
[HN4I Although not specifically defined, marital property has been construed to encompass 
any property which the couple acquired during the marriage and which is subject to 
equitable distribution upon divorce.

Property Distribution > Classification > Retirement Benefits > Pensions 
[HN51 Considering the tremendous statutory examples and case law from other 
jurisdictions holding pension funds as marital property, the Virgin Islands has determined 
that a pension fund is marital personal property, subject to claim by the other spouse upon 
divorce. To the extent earned during the marriage, the pension benefits represent 
compensation for marital effort and are substitutes for current earnings which would have 
increased the marital standard of living or would have been converted into other assets 
divisible at dissolution. Subjecting the benefits to division is just, because in most cases 
the retirement benefits constitute the most valuable asset the couple has acquired and 
they both have relied upon their pension payments for security in their older years.
