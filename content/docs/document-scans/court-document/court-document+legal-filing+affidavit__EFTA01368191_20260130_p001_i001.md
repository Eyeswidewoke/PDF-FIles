ABSTRACT 
A filing charges that a teenage girl was forced to have sexual relations with several men, including Prince Andrew, Queen Elizabeth's 
second sort 
FULL TEXT 
A court filing in a civil case in Florida last week included new allegations against Jeffrey E. Epstein, a businessman who pleaded 
guilty to soliciting prostitution, and two other high-profile men: a member of the British Royal family and an American lawyer. 
The motion filed in United States District Court in the Southem District of Florida alleges that Mr. Epstein forced a teenage girl to have 
sexual relations with several men, including Prince Andrew, Queen Elizabeth's second son, and Nan M. Dershowitz. a professor 
emeritus at Harvard Law School. Both men have denied the allegations. 
The motion charges that the woman, not identified in court documents. had sexual relations as a minor with Prince Andrew in London 
and New York and on Mr. Epstein's private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Mr. Epstein told the woman to give the prince "whatever 
he demanded" and "report back to him on the details," the motion said. 
Buckingham Palace took the unusual step of issuing multiple statements to rebut the accusations. 'This relates to longstanding and 
ongoing civil proceedings in the United States, to which The Duke of York is not a party." a palace spokesman said Friday in a 
statement. using the prince's title. "As such we would not comment on the detail. However, for the avoidance of doubt, any suggestion 
of impropriety with underage minors is categorically untrue." 
On Sunday. Buckingham Palace released a second statement, calling the allegations "false and without any foundation." The 
Associated Press reported. 
The motion was filed as part of a civil case involving Mr. Epstein, who was sentenced to 18 months in prison in 2008. The lawyers for 
two alleged victims have argued that the rights of the women were violated during the negotiation of Mr. Epstein's plea deal. The 
motion requests to add two more alleged victims to the case, including the woman, identified as "Jane Doe No. 3," who said she had 
sexual relations with Prince Andrew and Mr. Dershowitz when she was underage. 
On Saturday. Mr. Dershowitz said he "categorically and unequivocally" denied all of the allegations. He said he would file disbarment 
proceedings against the lawyers who filed the motion. Bradley J. Edwards. a lawyer in Florida. and Paul G. Cassell. a former federal 
judge and a law professor at the University of Utah.
