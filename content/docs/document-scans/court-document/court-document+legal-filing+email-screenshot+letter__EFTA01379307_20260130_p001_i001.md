As discussed at Patrick's senior banker meeting on Tuesday, we will be starting the account planning meetings for 2019 
in late 2018. The aim is to focus only on the clients and prospects with the greatest opportunities for incremental revenue 
and NNA growth. We are also limiting the number of relationships to review to 5-8 per banking team and also limiting the 
number of people in the meeting. We will look to you for guidance on invitees, including product specialists, partners, and 
even other bankers. 
To assist in choosing the accounts to review, attached is a list of your clients and protected prospects, along with 
information detailing the breakout of investments and liabilities'. On this list, we have highlighted some potential 
opportunities within the client and prospect set. For instance, we have highlighted whether an account: 
1) 
Is a current client or protected prospect (Column E) — please also feel free to choose prospects outside this list if 
more relevant 
2) 
Is KCP eligible, adopted or a KCP client (Column F) — particular focus being on clients who are KCP eligible but 
do not currently transact KCP business with us 
3) 
Relies on one product for >90% of revenue or CBV (Column G) 
4) 
Has a CBV <5% of client total net worth potentially indicating additional assets held away (Column H) 
These categories are intended to be useful indicators on which accounts are best positioned for growth, however this 
exercise will entirely defer to your judgment. We would ask however, that between now and Tuesday November 13 you 
confirm the accounts you want to plan with Andrew. For these chosen accounts, the SCM team will provide a planning 
template for you to outline the basic background and opportunities or challenges as you see them for the participants of 
the meeting — this is not intended to take significant amounts of time to complete. 
By Friday Nov 16th we want to all bankers and market heads in agreement on the final account lists (5-8 per team) for 
planning sessions and with the planning templates completed for each account. Starting Nov 261h , as schedules allow we 
would plan sessions of 90-120 minutes per banker. We will work in the interim to set-up session times in advance. Your 
flexibility with this would be greatly appreciated. 
Clearly we need to work around your other priorities, such as MTA's and year-end responsibilities including KYCs, tax 
planning, etc. and we will do our best to be as accommodative as possible! Please let the SCM team know if you have 
questions or concerns. 
*Please note that for any clients reassigned to you from departing bankers in 2018, we have included full year revenues 
given this is a planning exercise for 2019. Consequently, the revenue totals may not sum exactly to your LUNA totals 
given they include revenue still assigned to the leaver in GM1S. This view does not include any revenues booked outside 
of the US. 
Kind regards,
