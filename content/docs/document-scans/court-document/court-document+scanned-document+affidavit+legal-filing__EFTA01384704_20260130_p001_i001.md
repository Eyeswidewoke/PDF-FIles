HUBUS133 Alpha Group Capital 
will be taken into account. To the extent necessary to avoid exceeding the Applicable Percentage 
limit, the amounts that can be withdrawn by a group of Related Investors will be reduced pm rata 
based upon the net asset value of each such investor's interest. 
A Limited Partner (and/or its agent) must advise the Administrator of the identities of its 
Related Investors if it desires to have such Limited Partner's Related Investors' interests included in 
the calculation of its Withdrawal Date Value for any Withdrawal Date. The Partnership's Withdrawal 
Request Form, which can be obtained from the Partnership, will include a reminder to this effect. As 
a result of aggregating Related Investors for purposes of determining the Applicable Percentage 
limit, a Limited Partner with Related Investors may be entitled to withdraw more than the 
Applicable Percentage of its Capital Account at a time when the Applicable Percentage limitation 
is implemented if its Related Investors are withdrawing less than the Applicable Percentage of the 
net asset value of their Capital Account balances. However, under no circumstances will an 
Applicable Percentage for a Withdrawal Date be determined with respect to a Limited Partner based 
upon a withdrawal request made by a Related Investor for the prior Withdrawal Date. Thus, while 
the Withdrawal Date Value may be determined by reference to a Limited Partner's Related Investors, 
the Applicable Percentage will be determined separately with respect to each Limited Partner. 
If on any Withdrawal Date a Limited Partner requests to withdraw less than the Applicable 
Percentage for such Withdrawal Date or if, after requesting to withdraw at least the Applicable 
Percentage for a particular Withdrawal Date, a Limited Partner fails to make a withdrawal request of 
at least the next Applicable Percentage as of the next successive Withdrawal Date, then, in each such 
case, the Applicable Percentage for the subsequent Withdrawal Date for which the Limited Partner 
makes a withdrawal request will be reset to 25%. 
For the avoidance of doubt, if a Limited Partner purchases $100 worth of Interests on July 1, 
2018, such Limited Partner may withdraw up to $25 worth of such Interests as of each of September 
30, 2018 and December 31, 2018 (which will represent 25% and 331/4% of the Withdrawal Date 
Values as of the first and second quarter ends, respectively (assuming no capital appreciation or 
depreciation before or after a given Withdrawal Date)). If instead, such Limited Partner withdraws, 
for example, only $10 worth of Interests as of September 31, 2018, then the next time such Limited 
Partner makes a withdrawal, the maximum amount that can be withdrawn will be $22.50 (or 25% of 
$90, assuming the Withdrawal Date Value is still $90). 
The Partnership may permit Limited Partners to withdraw all or a portion of their Capital 
Accounts at such other times as the General Partner, in its sole discretion, determines; provided, 
however, that prior to any such withdrawal, the General Partner will consult with counsel to the 
Partnership to ensure that such withdrawal will not cause the Partnership to be treated as a 
"publicly traded partnership" taxable as a corporation. 
Subject to the following sentence, any written notice provided by a Limited Partner to the 
Partnership in connection with a withdrawal from such Limited Partner's Capital Account will be 
deemed irrevocable. The General Partner may, in its sole discretion, elect to waive or reduce any 
notice period or allow a notice to be revoked; provided, however, that the General Partner will first 
consult with counsel to the Partnership to ensure that any such waiver, reduction or revocation will 
not cause the Partnership to be treated as a "publicly traded partnership" taxable as a corporation.
