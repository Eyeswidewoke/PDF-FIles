2. 
The sources of ;mice information used to price 
credit default options are subject to a lack of transparency 
and, at times, illiquid markets. This Is attributable to, among 
other things: (1) the absence of last sale information and the 
limited availability of quotations for 
the reference 
obligation(s). (2) lack of ready availability of information on 
related products traded primarily in the over-the-counter 
market, and (3) the fact that related over-the-counter market 
credit derivative transactions are privately negotiated and 
may not be made public in a timely fashion or at all. 
3. 
Dealers in the underlying debt securities and in 
the over-the-counter credit derivatives markets have access 
to private quotation networks that give actual current bids 
and offers of other dealers. This information is not available 
to most investors. As a result, these dealers may have an 
advantage over participants with regard to credit default 
options. 
4. 
It the listing options market determines that a 
credit default option is subject to a redemption event ff.e.. 
the issuer or guarantor pays off the reference obligation), the 
option will expire worthless unless a credit event has been 
confirmed to have occurred prior to the effective date of the 
redemption event. As a result, purchasers of such options 
will lose their premium since there is no chance of 
occurrence of a credit event for the reference entity. On the 
other hand, if a redemption event occurs but a credit event is 
confirmed to have occurred prior to the effective dale of the 
redemption event, a seller would be obligated to pay the 
cash settlement amount even though a holder of the 
reference obligation may not incur a loss. 
5. 
Since succession events are determined by the 
listing options market, credit default options may be 
modified to specify a different reference entity or several 
different reference entities. As a result. there may be new 
reference obligations that have higher or lower credit quality 
than the original reference obligation. In addition, other 
factors may exist that could affect the likelihood of the 
occurrence of a credit event. As a result the occurrence of a 
succession event could affect the price of these options. 
Moreover, since the listing options market determines 
whether a succession event occurred and the adjustment 
resulting from such an event, the adjustment made to these 
options may be at variance with the treatment given to the 
same succession event with respect to related credit 
derivative products. 
6. 
The occurrence of a credit event must be 
confirmed by the listing options market. This means that 
there will be a lag time between the actual occurrence of a 
credit event and the listing options market's confirmation of 
the credit event. Rules of the options market may provide a 
specified time penod (e.g.. tour business days) between the 
end of the covered period and the expiration date for a senes 
of credit default options to allow the options market to 
confirm whether a credit event occurred during the covered 
period. There is a risk, however, that the sources used to 
monitor a credit event may not identity and report a credit 
event in a timely fashion. For example, it is possible that a 
credit event could occur on the last day of trading, but the
