SOF III -1081 Southern Financial LIS 
Temporary Investments distributed by the Fund been reduced by the amount of such 
obligation or liability, as equitably determined by the General Partner. 
A Limited Partner's liability (other than the Special Limited Partner's liability in respect 
of distributions attributable to a Limited Partner and distributed to the Special Limited 
Partner under Sections 6.2(aXiii) and (iv)) under the first sentence of this Section 9.2 is 
limited to an amount equal to 25% of all distributions received by such Partner from the 
Fund or any Alternative Investment Vehicle. In addition to the foregoing, no Partner 
shall be required to return distributions to the Fund after the 18-month anniversary of the 
last day of the Term, provided that if at the end of such period there are any Proceedings 
pending or Claims outstanding, the General Partner shall notify the Limited Partners in 
writing of the general nature of such Proceedings or Claims and an estimate of the 
amount of distributions that may be required to be returned pursuant to this Section 9.2 
and the obligation of the Partners to return distributions pursuant to this Section 9.2 shall 
be extended with respect to each such Proceeding or Claim until the date such 
Proceedings or Claims are ultimately resolved and distributions are returned to the Fund 
in respect thereof pursuant to this Section 9.2. Any distributions returned pursuant to this 
Section 9.2 and equivalent provisions of the organisational documents of any Alternative 
Investment Vehicle, or any payments (other than Loans) made by the General Partner in 
respect of any Damages, shall not be treated as Loans, but shall be treated as returns of 
distributions and reductions in Distributable Cash, for all purposes of this Agreement 
other than for purposes of computing a Limited Partner's internal rate of return for 
purposes of this Agreement, which shall be computed based on actual funded 
Commitments, payment made pursuant to this Section 9.2 and distributions received. 
Nothing in this Section 9.2, express or implied, is intended or shall be construed to give 
any Person other than the Fund or the Partners any legal or equitable right, remedy or 
claim under or in respect of this Section 9.2 or any provision contained herein. 
9.3 
Other Sources of Recovery. The General Partner shall cause the Fund to 
use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the funds needed to satisfy its 
indemnification and/or repayment obligations under Section 9.1 from Persons other than 
the Partners (for example, out of Fund assets or pursuant to insurance policies or 
Portfolio Investment indemnification arrangements) before causing the Fund to make 
payments pursuant to Section 9.1 and before requiring the Partners to return distributions 
to the Fund pursuant to Section 9.2. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this 
Section 9.3 shall prohibit the General Partner from causing the Fund to make such 
payments or requiring the Partners to return such distributions if the General Partner 
determines in good faith that the Fund is not likely to obtain sufficient funds from such 
other sources in a timely fashion, or that attempting to obtain such funds would be futile 
or not in the best interests of the Fund (for example, nothing in this Section 9.3 shall 
require the General Partner to cause the Fund to sell any Portfolio Investment before such 
time as the General Partner shall determine is advisable).
