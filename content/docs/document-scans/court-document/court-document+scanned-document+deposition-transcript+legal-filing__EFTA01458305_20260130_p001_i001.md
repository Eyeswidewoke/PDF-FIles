Brazil's economic outlook deteriorates further 
According to newspaper Folha de S.Paulo, Finance Minister Joaquim Levy told President Dilma 
Rousseff on Wednesday that he was becoming increasingly isolated in the federal 
administration and losing support to implement his fiscal adjustment plan, and concluded 
that, under these circumstances, it would be difficult for him to stay in the government. 
Shortly afterward, Rousseff publicly defended Levy, claiming that he was not isolated in the 
government. As speculation about Levy's possible resignation continued on Thursday, the 
beleaguered Finance Minister cancelled a trip to Turkey (for the G-20 meetings) in order to 
have a meeting with Rousseff, Planning Minister Nelson Barbosa, and Chief of Staff Aloizio 
Mercadante. 
We expect Rousseff to repeat that Levy has her total support, and also to send to Congress an 
addendum to the 2016 federal budget reducing the projected deficit. Nevertheless, the reality 
is that Levy has lost a sequence of important fights in the government (especially the 
watering down of the fiscal measures, the change in the fiscal targets, and more recently the 
2016 budget forecasting a federal primary deficit of 0.5% of GDP), and his position is 
becoming increasingly difficult day by day, as he remains under intense friendly fire 
(especially from the President's own party, the PT) and Rousseff seems to be having second 
thoughts about his fiscal austerity plan. As a matter of fact, we believe Levy has not left 
yet because the government fears that his departure could speed up Brazil's downgrade below 
investment grade, and because Levy himself knows that his departure would aggravate the 
crisis. 
The impression that we have at this point is that the federal government has indeed abandoned 
Levy's fiscal adjustment plan. According to newspaper Valor Economic°, the government is no 
longer willing to cut fiscal spending, believing that it is necessary to use expansionary 
fiscal policy (including subsidized loans) to rekindle growth. The authorities believe that, 
as economic growth picks up, tax revenues will improve, alleviating the fiscal situation. It 
seems that the farthest the government is willing to go to cut the primary fiscal deficit is 
to raise taxes, "especially on those sectors that gained the most during the Lula years," 
preserving its welfare programs. According to newspaper Estado de Sao Paulo, Rousseff has not 
given up on the CPMF tax idea, and allegedly wants to convince Congress to propose 
reinstating the tax on financial transactions. According to the same source, some congressmen 
of the ruling coalition are warming up to the idea, in light of the aggravation of the 
economic crisis. However, resistance against the tax remains quite strong in the private 
sector and opposition, so it remains to be seen whether Rousseff will manage to muster enough 
political support to pass it in Congress. 
When the Rousseff administration announced Levy's appointment and its fiscal adjustment plans 
at the end of last year, we warned that the president began her first mandate in 2011 by 
tightening fiscal and monetary policies as well, but eventually gave up on those as growth 
faltered, promoting a combination of rapid fiscal and monetary easing that was dubbed the 
"new macroeconomic matrix." Thus, we warned that there was a significant risk that history 
could be repeated in Rousseff's second term. It seems, however, that the austerity-based 
strategy is unraveling much faster than we could have expected, probably because of the 
convoluted political environment and repercussions of the Petrobras bribery scandal (the "Car
