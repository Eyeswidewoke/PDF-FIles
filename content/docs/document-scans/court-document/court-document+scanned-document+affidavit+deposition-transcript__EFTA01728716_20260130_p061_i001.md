In this discussion, the term compliant will be used to describe those children who 
cooperate in or "consent" to their sexual victimization. Because children cannot legally consent 
to having sex with adults, this compliance should not in any way alter the fact that they are 
victims of serious crimes. The term compliant is being used because at this time I cannot think 
of a better one. For the sake of child victims and professional interveners, it is important to bring 
out into the open possible reasons for and the complexity and significance of this compliance. 
The sexual victimization of children involves varied and diverse dynamics. It can 
range from one-on-one intrafamilial abuse to multioffender/multivictim extrafamilial sex 
rings and from stranger abduction of toddlers to prostitution of teenagers. For many child advocates 
and professionals in the field (Le., police, prosecutors, social workers, physicians, therapists), the 
sexual victimization of children means one-on-one intrafamilial-sexual abuse. Although they are 
certainly aware of other forms of sexual victimization of children, when discussing the problem in 
general their "default setting" (Le., that which is assumed without an active change) always seems 
to be children molested by family members. For the public, however, the "default setting" seems to 
be stranger abduction. To them, child molesters for the most part are sexually perverted strangers 
who physically overpower children and violently force them into sexual activity. 
The often forgotten piece in the puzzle ofthe sexual victimization of children is acquaintance 
molestation. This seems to be the most difficult manifestation of the problem for society and even 
professionals to face. People seem more willing to accept a sinister stranger from a different location 
or father/stepfather from a different socioeconomic-background as a child-molester than a clergy 
member, next-door neighbor, law-enforcement officer, pediatrician, teacher, or volunteer with access 
to children. Society seems to have a problem dealing with any sexual-victimization case in which 
the adult offender is not completely "bad" or the child victim is not completely "good." The idea that 
child victims could simply behave like human beings and respond to the attention and affection of 
offenders by voluntarily and repeatedly returning to an offender's home is a troubling one. For 
example, it confuses us to see the victims in child pornography giggling or laughing. 
Pitfalls in Understanding the Compliant Child Victim 
The sexual victimization of children by family members and by "strangers" can, of course, 
involve compliant child victims. In my experience, however, this compliance occurs most often in 
cases involving children sexually victimized by adult acquaintances. In other words, stranger 
offenders can use trickery to initially lure their child victinis, but they tend to control them more 
through confrontation, threats of force, and physical force. Likewise, intrafamilial offenders tend 
to control their victims more through their private access and family authority. The concept of child 
compliance is obviously much harder to define and evaluate when the offender is a parent. 
In contrast, acquaintance child molesters, although sometimes violent, tend by nerasgity to 
control their victims through the grooming or seduction process. This process not only gains the 
victim's initial cooperation, but also decreases the likelihood of disclosure and increases the 
likelihood of ongoing, repeated access. Acquaintance offenders with a preference for younger
