further their libelous agenda, as Mr =aldman has emphasized. In this regard, I would appreciate seeing =opies of the 
correspondence you might send to current or former =mployees about this in the process of carrying out and concluding 
your =nvestigation. 
Secondly, I reiterate once again that the Origins Project =nvironment is 
supportive, candid, frank, honest, and productive, with =11 employees being treated with respect, as well as being 
supported and =encored. I am proud of our team, and I believe they feel the same =ay. 
Thanks for your attention to these letters. 
Lawrence Krauss 
Dear Ms. Saadiq: 
My name is Adam Waldman, and I am Professor Lawrence =rauss' litigation 
counsel. Earlier this week, I sent the =ttached letter to Buzzfeed via one of their reporters named Peter =ldhous. 
I am also in receipt of Mr. Aldhous' letter to ASU, =hich is a variation on 
defamation — both libel and slander =93 that Mr. Aldhous and his colleagues have been manufacturing for at =east 6 
months (notably without any reporting) in a campaign with a =urpose known only to them. Buzzfeed's first method is to 
=all or write third parties, posit a list of fake, anonymous, recklessly =alse and malicious "allegations," and ask if the third 
=arty has anything to add. Buzzfeed's second method is to =eek tortious interference with Professor Krauss' 
professional =ontracts, by writing third parties with whom Professor Krauss is in =rivity, present a similarly inflammatory 
series of anonymous, =ecklessly false and malicious accusations, and then question: how can =he email's recipient allow 
such a person to serve on their =oard, or speak at their conference? The letter from Buzzfeed to =he University falls into 
both categories. There will be appropriate =egal consequences for Buzzfeed's actions. 
It =s my understanding that your office believes it is compelled by the =bove to 
investigate false, defamatory, anonymous accusations posited by =he online tabloid Buzzfeed by contacting third parties 
and potentially =ebroadcasting the tabloid Buzzfeed's accusations. To be =tear, these accusations were not made to the 
University by actual human =eings who are alleging they were victims. There is no evidence =hey were presented to 
Buzzfeed by actual human beings. Moreover, no =resent or former employees of ASU have made any such allegations to 
=our office, or to any office at ASU, to our knowledge. They are simply =lleged by a tabloid, and one that had yet 
published a "story" =n the topic when they forwarded these to you. You may propose to =ebroadcast this tabloid's libel 
to other third parties who have also =ade no accusation against Professor Krauss. I suggest that you =onsult with the 
University's counsel before taking so rash a =tep as re-broadcasting hearsay defamation that came to you via an =nline 
tabloid under these circumstances. 
Professor Krauss and I both recognize the absolute need to =nvestigate real 
allegations. Some of the women who have bravely =ome forward with personal harassment allegations against Harvey 
=einstein are my clients and friends. Some of these victims have =een advised by me. Those actual allegations are 
entirely distinct =rom a tabloid attempting to manufacture allegations to create harm. =nbsp; 
Sincerely, 
Adam Waldman
