encouraging indicators.

The region is clearly looking at nuclear energy as means to meet its energy needs in the 
future. What is your view on the proliferation of nuclear technology in the Middle East? 
The UAE's announced stance is very clear: All countries have the right to use nuclear power for peaceful 
purposes. We look forward for the day when the entire Middle East region will be declared free of all nuclear and 
mass-destruction weapons.

What comments do, Your Highness have about the rumors that Your Highness had a health 
problem lately? We pray God that the rumors were base less, and that He may grant Your 
Highness good health, long life and happiness to make Your Highness a model to be 
followed in the region. 
I thank God that I am well and in the best of health and peace of mind and soul. The rumors about me are a part 
of the psychological war that was waged on Dubai in recent months. Rumors have never targeted unsuccessful, 
backward or marginal people. I personally pay no attention to rumors, as I know they are short -lived. When 
people find out the facts, they respect and appreciate you more: their good feelings toward you grow, and the 
rumor-mongers diminish in their eyes. In fact the last few months I have participated in 4 endurance races where 
I was able to race for more than 120km in each.

By the end of the first quarter of 2009, what is your evaluation of the economic performance 
of the UAE in light of the financial crisis? What is the UAE government's strategy to raise 
the national economy, and emerge from the financial crisis stronger than before? How do 
you respond to the unfair and hateful rumors that Dubai has turned into a ghost city? 
The performance of our economy in the first quarter of this year proves that we are on the way out of the crisis, 
and that we are on the right track. Our economy will resume its health faster than other economies, but the speed 
of that=2 Oresumption is not governed only by the strength of our economy and its abundant resources. The 
speed will also be influenced by developments in the international economy — including the measures of revival in 
the grouping of industrialized states known as the G-20, whose role in international trade movement is about 90 
percent of the total international trade, and whose GDP is about 60 percent of the entire world GDP. The speed 
of general recovery will also be influenced by the capability of international measures connected with monitoring 
markets, and the role, functions and work mechanisms of international financial institutions, especially the 
International Monetary Fund. I am optimistic that good implementation of the decisions of 6-20 and the 
International Monetary Fund will speed up the recovery of the global economy.
