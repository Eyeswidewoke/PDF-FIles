GUARANTY 
GUARANTY dated as of September 
j. 2013 made by Jeffrey Epstein, a 
resident (the "Guarantor") in favor of Deutsche Bank AG, a corporation 
organized under the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany, including any of its branches 
anywhere (the "Bank"). Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined shall have 
the meaning provided in the Master Agreement referred to below. 
WHEREAS, the Bank and each counterparty listed on Appendix A attached hereto 
and made a part hereof, severally, and not jointly (each an "Obligor") have entered into a 
Master Agreement of even date herewith (as amended, modified or supplemented from time 
to time, by any confirmation contemplated therein or otherwise, the "Master Agreement") 
and it is a requirement of the Master Agreement that the Obligor deliver this Guaranty for 
Obligor's obligations under the Master Agreement to the Bank. 
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises set forth above and other 
good and valuable consideration receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, and as an 
inducement to the Bank to enter into Transactions with the Obligor, the Guarantor hereby 
consents and agrees as follows: 
1. 
Guaranty. (a) The Guarantor unconditionally, irrevocably guarantees to the 
Bank payment when due, whether by acceleration or otherwise, of the full amount of any 
and all obligations and liabilities, direct or contingent, joint, several or independent, now or 
hereafter existing, due or to become due to, or held or to be held by, the Bank, whether 
created directly or acquired by assignment or otherwise, of the Obligor to the Bank arising 
from or in connection with the Master Agreement together with all expenses incurred by the 
Bank in enforcing any of such obligations and liabilities or the terms hereof, including, 
without limitation, fees and expenses of legal counsel. The Guarantor waives notice of 
acceptance of this Guaranty and of any obligation to which it applies or may apply under the 
terms hereof, and waives diligence, presentment, demand of payment, notice of dishonor or 
non-payment, protest, notice of protest, of any such obligations, suit or taking other action 
by the Bank against, and giving any notice of default or other notice to, or making any 
demand on, any party liable thereon (including the Guarantor). Payment by the Guarantor is 
in all cases to be made in the Contractual Currency of the payment obligation of the Obligor 
and to the account designated for payments by the Obligor or such other account as the Bank 
may direct. 
(b) This Guaranty is a primary obligation of the Guarantor and is an absolute, 
unconditional, continuing and irrevocable guaranty of payment and not of collectibility or 
performance and is in no way conditioned on or contingent upon any attempt to enforce in 
whole or in part the Obligor's liabilities and obligations to the Bank. If the Obligor shall fail 
to pay any liabilities or obligations to the Bank as and when they are due, the Guarantor shall 
forthwith pay such liabilities or obligations in immediately available funds without the Bank 
having any obligation to notify Guarantor of such failure to pay. Each failure by the Obligor
