HUBUS133 Alpha Group Capital 
Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures 
In compliance with Rule 206(4)-6 under the Advisers Act, the Management Company has 
adopted proxy voting policies and procedures. The Management Company's proxy voting policy 
is overseen and implemented by a Proxy Voting Committee, consisting of the Chief Compliance 
Officer and the Chief Operating Officer and such other persons as may be appointed from time to 
time. In voting proxies relating to securities held by an Account (each, a "Proxy"), the 
Management Company is guided by general fiduciary principles and votes in the manner it 
believes is consistent with efforts to achieve an Account's stated investment objectives. 
The Management Company has appointed an unaffiliated third party proxy voting service, 
Institutional Shareholder Services ("ISS"), to assist with the management of proxy voting. The 
Management Company will generally rely on the analyses and vote recommendations provided by 
ISS (each, an "ISS Recommendation"). In those situations, the Management Company need not 
take any further action, and ISS will vote the Proxy on the Management Company's behalf in 
accordance with the ISS Recommendations. However, the Management Company always 
maintains ultimate voting discretion and may disregard an ISS Recommendation at any time and 
has done so on numerous occasions. In particular, in situations where the Management Company 
determines that it is in an Account's best interest to vote a Proxy in a particular way (the "HBC 
Proxy Voting Decision"), the Management Company will review the ISS Recommendation 
relating to such Proxy, and where the ISS Recommendation differs from the HBC Proxy Voting 
Decision (or where there is no ISS Recommendation with respect to such Proxy), the Management 
Company will specifically instruct ISS to vote the Proxy in accordance with the HBC Proxy Voting 
Decision, in accordance with certain internal procedures applicable to the Proxy Voting 
Committee. 
Among the factors the Management Company may consider in reaching a HBC Proxy 
Voting Decision are how a particular Proxy vote would affect: (i) fulfillment of an investment 
thesis concerning a particular strategy 
consummation of a merger or other corporate event); 
(ii) an Account's portfolio positions in other parts of the issuer's capital structure; (iii) other 
contractual rights held by an Account in connection with the securities at issue; (iv) an Account's 
relationship with the issuer; (v) tax and/or regulatory issues relating to the securities or issuer at 
issue; and (vi) other facts as circumstances the Proxy Voting Committee identifies depending on 
the particularities of the situation at hand. 
The Management Company also retains the discretion to take no action with respect to a 
proposed vote if it determines that doing so is in the best interests of an Account (for example, 
where the Management Company determines that the cost of voting exceeds the expected benefit 
to the Account). 
Conflicts of interest may arise between the interests of the Accounts on the one hand and 
the Management Company or its affiliates on the other hand. If the Management Company 
determines that a conflict of interest is material, the Management Company may use one or more 
methods to resolve the conflict, including directing ISS to recommend a vote with respect to the 
Proxy, disclosing the conflict to the Account and obtaining its consent before voting or such other 
method as is deemed appropriate under the circumstance. Limited Partners may request a copy of 
the Management Company's Proxy voting policies and its Proxy voting record.
