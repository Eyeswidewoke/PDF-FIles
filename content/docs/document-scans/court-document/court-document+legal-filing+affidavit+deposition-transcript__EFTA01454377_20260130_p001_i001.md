The IRS has issued unpublished rulings that support this outcome.25 For example, 
the IRS issued a private letter ruling regarding an annuity on which payment had not yet been 
made that was transferred to a charity upon death of the owner of the annuity. The IRS ruled that 
only the charity would include income from the annuity.26 A trust was the beneficiary of the 
deferred annuity and under the terms of the trust distributed the annuity to a tax-exempt charity 
upon death of the owner of the annuity. The IRS ruled that the assignment to the charity was not 
a transfer triggering IRD to the estate and that only the charity would include distributions on the 
annuity in gross income as IRD when the distributions are made." A similar conclusion was 
reached by the IRS in a private letter ruling when the annuitant had not assigned a beneficiary to 
the deferred payment annuity and upon the death of the annuitant the estate was considered the 
beneficiary under state law. The estate assigned the annuity to tax-exempt charities in partial 
satisfaction of the charities' share of the residue of the estate. The IRS issued a private letter 
ruling stating that the assignment did not trigger IRD to the estate and that only the charities 
would include payments on the annuity in gross income as MD.28
Some additional support is also provided by private letter rulings issued by the 
IRS with respect to the transfer of IRAs to tax-exempt charities or foundations. Under these 
rulings, the transfer of a decedent's IRA by the estate to a tax-exempt charity or foundation 
resulting in no IRD to the estate or other beneficiaries." A similar conclusion has also been 
reached with respect to the transfer to a charity or foundation of certain pension or retirement 
rights held by the estate of a decedent.30
a. IRD May Be Triggered if Transfer Is Made as Pan of Pecuniary Bequest 
IRD may thus be avoided if a tax-exempt charity or foundation is made a 
beneficiary upon death under the terms of the PPVA. Alternatively, the estate of the owner may 
be the beneficiary and the owner's will may bequeath the PPVA to the tax-exempt charity or 
foundation. 
If the latter strategy is chosen, however, the form in which the bequest is made 
may be important. A transfer in lieu of a pecuniary bequest should be avoided. 
3. Inclusion of Annuity in Estate for Federal Estate Tax Purposes 
2' Private letter rulings are not binding precedent on the IRS or a court. However, they indicate the views of the IRS 
and can be cited as substantial authority for penalty purposes. 
36 Although the ruling did not explicitly state this, if the charity meets the requirements of a lax-exempt entity such 
income should not be taxable to the charity.
