exclusive legal and equitable remedies in connection with Buyer's failure to execute and 
deliver said Post-Inspection Notice, and Seller waives any other remedies that may be 
available to it at law or in equity in connection therewith. 
2.5 
Movement Costs. The costs and expenses of any movement of the Aircraft 
(the "Movement Costs") expressly set forth as the obligations of the Buyer hereunder 
shall be calculated at a rate of $875.00 per flight hour (the "Movement Cost Rate"). 
SECTION 3. DELIVERY AND TRANSFER OF TITLE. 
3.1 
Location of Closing. On the Closing Date, Seller shall tender the Aircraft 
to Buyer, in the Delivery Condition at the Inspection Facility, or such other location as is 
mutually acceptable to the parties (the "Delivery Location"). Seller agrees that it will 
honor reasonable requests of Buyer with respect to the location of the transfer Of title 
contemplated hereunder so as to minimize Buyer's tax liability in connection therewith, 
provided, however, that, unless otherwise expressly set forth herein, the costs and 
expenses of compliance with such requests, including, without limitation, any Movement 
Costs at the Movement Cost Rate, shall be borne by Buyer. 
Buyer shall pay the 
Movement Costs of any flight necessary to position the Aircraft to any Delivery Location 
other than the Inspection Facility at the Movement Cost Rate. 
3.2 
Final Review by Buyer. At the time of transfer of title to the 
Aircraft Buyer may, at its option, make a reasonable review of the Aircraft and the 
Aircraft Documentation to determine that the Aircraft has not suffered any damage and 
conforms to the conditions, including, but not limited to, the Delivery Condition, required 
by this Agreement. 
In addition, if the Inspection Facility determines that one or more additional 
flights are necessary to verify the correction of any Discrepancy, Seller shall , at Buyer's 
request, conduct such necessary verification flight(s) prior to the Closing ("Verification 
Flight"). Seller shall bear the costs and expenses incurred in connection with such 
Verification Flight(s). If in the course of conducting the final inspection, including 
during any Verification Flight(s), any Discrepancies are found, such Discrepancies shall, 
unless otherwise mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties, be corrected or caused to 
be corrected by Seller, at Seller's cost and expense, prior to Closing. 
33 
Aircraft Bills of Sale. On or prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall submit 
in escrow to Escrow Agent all such documentation as may be required by the FAA Civil 
Aviation Registry to transfer good and marketable title to the Aircraft including without 
limitation, (i) a properly executed undated FAA approved form of Aircraft Bill of Sale 
(AC Form 8050-2) ("FAA Bill of Sale") transferring title and ownership of the Aircraft to 
Buyer, (ii) a properly executed undated Warranty Bill of Sale in the form of that attached 
hereto as Rxhibit D ("Warranty Bill of Sale") and (iii) releases, in form and substance 
reasonably satisfactory to Buyer and Escrow Agent ("Releases"), of any Liens (as such 
term is defined below) filed and/or recorded at the FAA Civil Aviation Registry, (items 
(i), (ii) and (iii) above, the "Title Documents"). Upon filing of the Title Documents and 
the Aircraft Registration Application (AC Form 8050-1) duly executed by or on behalf of 
Buyer at the FAA Civil Aviation Registry and upon effecting registration of a sale of the 
Airframe and Engines in favor of Buyer at the International Registry (as such term is 
hereinafter defined in Section 11.6), Escrow Agent shall have all of the necessary 
documents in order for it to determine that Buyer is the registered owner of the Aircraft 
free and clear of any Liens.
