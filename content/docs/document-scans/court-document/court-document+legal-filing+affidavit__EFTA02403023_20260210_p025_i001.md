We can speculate that the other case, where Ox > A requires the full treatment of the quan-
tum field theory to resolve. We remark that there are known to be additional sources of 
non-locality coming from interactions in non-commutative field theory, which may play a 
role in the resolution of the paradoxes in the full interacting quantum field theory. We may 
hypothesize that a notion like 'c-locality may be relevant there. 
• I proposed in section 5 a weakening of locality to tc-locality defined by worldlines intersect-
ing in the frame of some inertial observer. I showed that this property is very non-generic, 
so it is the case that only a set of measure zero of N ≥ 3 worldlines n-interact. 
So, to conclude, we have shown that there is a regime where quantum effects suffice to resolve 
the paradoxes, but we have not so far shown this in general. 
We note that the problem of measurements and uncertainty in n-Minkowski spacetime has 
been studied before[171, and the effect of spreading of wavepackets has been noted[18, 191. How-
ever these previous papers do not seem to have studied propagation in the (x3,T) commuting 
coordinates. The novel assertion of the present work then appears to be the insistence that the 
spacetime we experience must be a commutative spacetime, which means that quantum state 
evolve in space according to the time coordinate T which is different from the time coordinate tin 
which we can study evolution in momentum space. 
There are in addition a number of questions and issues that remain to be sorted out in this 
area. 
• The commutation relations (4) and (10) are not invariant under time reversal (t —• —t or 
T 
—T, respectively. Another way to say this is that the theory seems physically different 
depending on whether the sign of ti, is taken negative, or positive as we have taken it here. 
Are there physical consequences of this? 
• Similarly, the theory does not seem invariant under the exchange of E for -E. Is there still 
CPT symmetry? 
• It appears that the phase velocity computed above is not equal to the classical computation 
of dr' Ictr computed via the Hamiltonian dynamics. Is this a problem? 
• It is known that QFT defined on noncommutative geometries in which lime and space co-
ordinates don't commute are not unitary[20]. Might it be that unitary evolution could be 
defined instead in the time variable T? 
• There is a long standing debate as to whether the physics in re-Minkowsld spacetime should 
be invariant, not just under Lorentz transformations, but under non-linear redefinitions of 
the phase space coordinates. A view that seems reasonable is that DSR theories will be limits 
of quantum theories of gravity, whose physics will define the appropriate notion of locality 
and hence the physical spacetime. Thus, a particular set of choices for physical momenta, 
energy and spacetime coordinates will be reflected in the form of the Hamiltonian. At the 
same time, any quantum mechanical system is invariant under changes of basis in Hilbert 
space. It may be that the observer independence provided by chokes of basis in Hilbert 
space implies an expansion of the notion of observer independence in a quantum theory of 
gravity, but this is a subtle issue that goes beyond the scope of this paper.
