Introduction 
Iran has reasonable credentials for being treated as a regional power. It has the necessary 
demography (population, 77.8 million), a pivotal geographic location (between the West 
Asia, Central Asia and South Asia), and a strong and ancient identity that makes an impact on 
Iran's environment more than likely.2 This can only feed a sense of nationalistic pride in the 
country. But does pride mean an 'aggressive' or 'destructive' foreign policy? Its immediate 
regional environment could entice Iran to be assertive. Its neighbours can mostly be 
considered weaker at several levels.3 And there is this point of view, especially in the West, 
that the Iranian regime is always guided by an ideological approach. Such a view, especially 
by American thinkers and policy-makers, would portray Iran as an 'aggressive' West Asian 
nation. This is what former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger expressed during a lunch 
organised by the Financial Times: Iran has to choose 'whether it is a nation or a cause'.4 But 
Tehran is not necessarily tempted to act like the purveyor of a 'cause' overseas: certainly, not 
the way Iran was perceived in the West immediately after 1979. Admittedly, internally, the 
Iranian regime has certain ideological claims, as it defines itself as an 'Islamic Republic'. 
And indeed, this regime has had external ambitions. Ayatollah Khomeini's programme in 
diplomacy was called Mashru al-Thawra a!-Iraniyah, the 'Project of the Iranian Revolution'. 
In religious terms, the project was very ambitious: to make of Iran the centre of the Muslim 
World and to make the leader of the Iranian Revolution 'Commander of the Faithful'. But, 
when one does not get impressed by such religious language and focuses on the concrete 
consequences of the project, it looks like a very realist foreign policy of any ambitious power. 
The goal of this policy has been, first and foremost, to cultivate groups that would help 
project Iranian influence wherever it is in Tehran's interest? Besides, after the Iraq-Iran war 
(1980-1988) and the death of Khomeini, Iran moved towards what has been called the 
'second Republic'. From that time, the Iranians understood their political and military limits, 
and focused on protecting their interests rationally overseas. Tehran has continued to see 
Israel and the US as enemies or competitors in the Middle East, but stopped seeing terrorism 
as an efficient tool in foreign affairs and avoided antagonising its Arab neighbours.6

Long-term history is part of everyday life for Iranians. In general discussions, references to great 
Persian/Iranian poets are not as rare as one might think. In some regard. one could argue that the pride of 
Iranians about their culture, history and their claim for influence in the regional environment is not dissimilar 
to American exceptionalism. See Michael Axworthy, Iran, Empire of the Mind. A History from Zoroaster to 
the Present Day, New York: Penguin, 2008, pp. xiii to xv.
