1. 
Terms of the Offer. 
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer (including. if the Offer is extended or amended, 
the terms and conditions of such extension or amendment), we will (and Intel will cause us to). (a) at or as 
promptly as practicable following the Expiration Time (but in any event within two business days thereafter), 
accept for payment and (b) at or as promptly as practicable following the Acceptance Time (but in any event 
within three business days (calculated as set forth in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) promulgated under the Exchange Act) 
thereafter), pay for all Shares validly tendered pursuant to the Offer and not properly withdrawn (as permitted 
under Section 4 —"Withdrawal Rights") as of the Acceptance Time. Unless the Offer is earlier terminated, the 
Offer will expire at 5:00 p.m.. New York City time, on June 21.2017 (unless later extended as described below). 
The Offer is conditioned upon. among other things, (a) the absence of the termination of the Purchase 
Agreement in accordance with its terms and (b) the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted by the 
Purchase Agreement and applicable law) of the following as of the scheduled Expiration Time: (i) the Minimum 
Condition (as its threshold may be lowered pursuant to the Purchase Agreement); (ii) the Antitrust Clearance 
Condition; (iii) the Restraints Condition; (iv) the Governance Resolutions Condition; and (v) the Material 
Adverse Effect Condition. 
The Offer is not subject to a financing condition but is subject to other conditions as described in this Offer 
to Purchase. See Section 15 —"Certain Conditions of the Offer." 
Subject to Intel's rights to terminate the Purchase Agreement in accordance with its terms. Purchaser may 
extend the Offer to such other date and time as may be agreed in writing by Mobileye and Intel. and Purchaser 
has agreed in the Purchase Agreement that it will extend the Offer: 
for the minimum period required by applicable law, the SEC or the rules of NASDAQ or the NYSE; 
and 
on one or more occasions in consecutive periods of 10 business days each, with such period to end at 
5:00 p.m.. New York City time on the last business day of such period (or such other duration as Intel. 
Purchaser and Mobileye may agree) if. at any then-scheduled Expiration Time, any condition to the 
Offer has not been satisfied or waived. in order to permit satisfaction of such condition; except that: 
if Purchaser determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that at any 
then-scheduled Expiration Time. the Antitrust Clearance Condition is not reasonably likely to be 
satisfied within such 10 business day extension period, then Purchaser will be permitted to extend 
the Offer on such occasion for up to 20 business days: 
if the sole remaining unsatisfied condition to the Offer is the Minimum Condition and the Pre-
Wired Asset Sale Ruling (as defined below) has been obtained or Intel determines in its 
reasonable judgment that the he-Wired Asset Sale Ruling will not be received. Purchaser will not 
be required to extend the Offer for more than two occasions in consecutive periods of 10 business 
days each (or such other duration as Intel. Purchaser. and Mobileye may agree): and 
• Purchaser is not required to extend the Offer beyond the End Date, which is March 12, 2018 
(subject to automatic extension to June 10. 2018 and September 8. 2018. respectively, if. at each 
such earlier date, all conditions to the closing have been satisfied, other than the Antitrust 
Clearance Condition). 
If Purchaser extends the Offer, such extension will extend the time that you will have to tender (or 
withdraw) your Shares. 
Subject to the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, Purchaser expressly reserves the right at any time 
prior to the Expiration Time to waive, in whole or in part, any condition to the Offer and to make any change in
