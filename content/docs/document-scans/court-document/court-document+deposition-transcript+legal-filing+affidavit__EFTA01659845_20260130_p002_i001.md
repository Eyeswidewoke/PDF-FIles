which includes but k not limited to Ms. 
testimony: the witness transcripts: the tainted 
Detective Kecarey reports: and our prior submissions. In light of the concerns we raised and the 
evidence we discussed al the December 14 meeting, we am firmly persuaded that this provides 
the only avenue for Mr. Epstein to be afibrded the bedrock value of horizontal equality. We now 
elaborate on the three pivotal issues last discussed at last Friday's (December I4) meeting. 
1. 
The Conduct b Not a Reekterahle Offense Under Florida la 
Under the Agreement. Mr. Epstein is to plead guilty to an indictment charging one count 
of Florida Statute § 796.07. solicitation of prostitution. and to one count of Florida Statute 
* 796.03. procuring n minor for prostitution. Given the commercial nature of the conduct 
generally associated with § 796.03. a defendant convicted under this statute must register as a 
sexual offender under Florida's Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (the "Florida's 
Sex Act"). However. Mr. Epstein's alleged conduct does not meet the requirements of § 796.03, 
or for that matter. any of the other Florida statutes that require registration. 
A. 
Honda Statute § 796.03 is Inapplicable 
It should be noted that at the time § 796.03 was negotiated between the panics. Ms. 
Villafana maintained (and continued to maintain as late as last week). that a § 796.03 charge 
involved the solicitation of a minor, not the procurement of a minor. During those negotiations. 
we repeatedly asked Ms. Villafana to confirm that she possessed the requisite evidence to make 
out a registerable charge. to which she unwaveringly replied that she did in fact possess this 
evidence. Although she has refused to disclose such evidence despite our repeated requests. we 
continued to proceed in good faith. We were then informed by lama I3etohlavek that solicitation 
of a minor is not a registemble offense. and we promptly made that known to Ms. Villafana. 
With the evidence at hand, it is clear that § 796.03 is a procurement statute dial has no 
application to Mr. Epstein whatsoever. l 
Under § 796.03. "(al person who procures for prostitution. or causes to be prostituted. 
any person who is under the age of is years commits a felony of the second degree . . .". 
Conviction under this statute requires an offender to register as a sexual offentkr (whereas a 
defendant convicted of soliciting a prostitute under § 796.07 does not). 
Recognizing this 
It is obvious from the lint plea proposal we received From Ms. Villafana. that she has always seen solicitation 
of a minor as tx: appropriate charge under the facts Ilhis is also the Slate's recommended charge). What is now 
apparent is that she thought that solicitation of a minor MIS both a felony and a registerable charge under 
Florida law. It is not. Rather than foree-lii another charge that matches the sentence Ms. Vitiation desires. 
your ()Met should implement the slate charge that it has maintained is the most appropriate for dir olletzeti 
comfort .,.- colicilatio n ofa minor.
