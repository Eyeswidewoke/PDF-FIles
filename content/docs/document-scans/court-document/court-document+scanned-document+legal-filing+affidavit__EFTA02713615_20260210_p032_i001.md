certain limited circumstances. (See "Outline of Limited Partnership Agreement.") Similarly, the 
management and partnership agreements entered into with Portfolio Managers will in all 
likelihood require the Partnership to similarly indemnify and hold harmless the Portfolio 
Managers except in very limited circumstances. The Partnership has also agreed to indemnify 
the Administrator in certain limited circumstances described in the Administration Agreement. 
Agreements with Certain Limited Partners: Access to Information: Enhanced Liquidity. 
The Partnership will provide Limited Partners with monthly unaudited information regarding the 
Partnership's performance. Subject to applicable law, the Partnership, the Investment Manager 
or the General Partner, however, may enter into "side letter" agreements with certain Limited 
Partners pursuant to which they may give one or more Limited Partners access to more frequent 
and/or more detailed information regarding the Partnership's securities positions, performance 
and finances. In addition, pursuant to any such side letter agreement, the General Partner may 
give certain Limited Partners the right to withdraw all or a portion of their capital from the 
Partnership on shorter notice and/or with more frequency than the terms described in this 
Memorandum, unless the General Partner concludes that the other Limited Partners will be 
materially prejudiced. As a result, certain Limited Partners may be better able to assess the 
prospects and performance of the Partnership than other Limited Partners, and may be able to 
withdraw their capital from the Partnership at times when other Limited Partners may not. 
Subject to applicable law, the Partnership does not intend to disclose the terms of such side letter 
agreements and does not intend to disclose the identities of the Limited Partners that have 
entered into such agreements with the Partnership, the Investment Manager or the General 
Partner. 
Portfolio Manager Compensation. Allocation of capital by the Investment Manager to 
Portfolio Managers, rather than investing the Partnership's assets directly, significantly increases 
the fees and expenses payable by the Partnership because the Portfolio Managers charge their 
own fees and expenses, which are in addition to the Incentive Allocation, Management Fee and 
expenses incurred by the Partnership. The Portfolio Managers' incentive fees will generally be 
based on the individual performance of each Portfolio Manager, irrespective of the overall 
performance of the Partnership. The fact that incentive fees are individually calculated exposes 
the Partnership to the risk of paying a Portfolio Manager during periods when the net asset value 
of the Partnership decreases and of having its assets actually depleted by incentive fees and 
allocations. 
Offsetting Investments. 
The Portfolio Managers at times may hold economically 
offsetting positions. To the extent that the Portfolio Managers do, in fact, hold such positions, 
the Partnership, considered as a whole, may not achieve any gain or loss despite incurring 
substantial expenses. 
Investment and Trading Risks. All securities investments risk the loss of capital. No 
guarantee or representation is made that the Partnership's or any Portfolio Manager's trading 
program will be successful or that the Partnership will not incur losses. A Portfolio Manager's 
trading program may utilize investment techniques including, but not limited to, trading in 
derivatives, the use of leverage, and short sales, which in practice can, in certain circumstances, 
increase the adverse impact to which the Partnership may be subject. In addition, in certain 
transactions, the Partnership may not be "hedged" against market fluctuations or, in
