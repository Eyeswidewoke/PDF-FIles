D. Payment Authorization and Payment Remittance 
i. 
By providing us with names and account information of Billers to whom you wish to direct payments, you 
authorize us to follow the Payment Instructions that we receive through the payment system. In order to 
process payments more efficiently and effectively, we may edit or alter payment data or data formats in 
accordance with Biller directives. When we receive a Payment Instruction, you authorize us to debit your 
Payment Account and remit funds on your behalf so that the funds arrive as close as reasonably possible to 
the Scheduled Payment Date designated by you. You also authorize us to credit your Payment Account for 
payments returned to us by the United States Postal Service or Biller, or payments remitted to you on 
behalf of another authorized user of the Bill Payment Service. We will use our best efforts to make all your 
payments property. However, we shall incur no liability and any Service Guarantee shall be void if we are 
unable to complete any payments initiated by you because of the existence of any one or more of the 
circumstances described in Section 6 above. 
ii. 
Provided none of the exceptions identified in Section 6 above are applicable, if we cause an incorrect 
amount of funds to be removed from your Payment Account or cause funds from your Payment Account to 
be directed to a Biller who does not comply with your Payment Instructions, we shall be responsible for 
returning the improperly transferred funds to your Payment Account, and for directing to the proper Biller 
any previously misdirected transactions, and, if applicable, for any late payment related charges. 
E. Payment Methods 
We reserve the right to select the method in which to remit funds on your behalf to your Biller These payment 
methods may include, but may not be limited to, electronic payment via ACH or check payment. 
F. Payment Inquiries 
The current status of all Bill Payments may be viewed using the Bill Payment Service. This includes scheduled 
payments, in-process and processed payments. Processed payment inquiries may also be sent via the Bill 
Payment Service to the Banking Service Team using the "Contact Us" link on the Customer Support page or by 
phone at 1-800-5934345. 
G. Payment Cancellation Requests 
You may cancel or edit any Scheduled Payment (including recurring payments) by following the online 
directions within the Bill Payment Service application. There is no charge for canceling or editing a Scheduled 
Payment. Once we have begun processing a payment it cannot be cancelled or edited, therefore a stop 
payment request must be submitted if applicable or allowed by contacting the Banking Service Team at 
1-866-362-4796. 
H. Stop Payment Requests 
Our ability to process a stop payment request will depend on the payment method and whether or not a check 
has cleared. Also, we may not have a reasonable opportunity to act on any stop payment request after a 
payment has been processed. If you desire to stop any payment that has already been processed, you must 
contact the Banking Service Team at 1-866-362-4796. Although we will make every effort to accommodate 
your request, we will have no liability for failing to do so. We may also require you to present your request in 
writing within 10 days. The charge for each stop payment request is $10.00. The charge for stop payment 
requests will be applied whenever any Bill Payment is stopped at your request, because you submitted an 
incorrect Biller address or because you request a refund on a check that has not yet cleared. The charge will not 
be assessed if the payment is stopped due to an error by the Bank or its Service Provider, the payment was not 
posted by the Biller even though you correctly submitted the Biller address or if the check was lost in the mail. 
From time to time, the Internet Banking Service may be inoperable. If that occurs, your request can be 
communicated to the Bank by telephone instructions. The Cut-Off time for us to receive a stop-payment request 
is 4:00 p.m. New York time on a Business Day and a stop payment request received after that time will be 
processed on the next Business Day. You agree that we will have a reasonable period of time following receipt 
of a stop payment request to act on it. 
I. Prohibited Payments 
Payments to Billers outside of the United States or its territories are prohibited through the Bill Payment Service. 
J. Consumer Client Government Payments 
For consumers only: You agree not to use the Bill Payment Service to make state or federal tax payments and 
court ordered payments (Government Payments). In no event shall we be liable for any claims or damages 
resulting from your scheduling of Government Payments. The Service Guarantee as it applies to any late 
payment related changes is void when Government Payments are scheduled and/or processed by the Bill 
Payment Service. We shall have no obligation to research or resolve any claim resulting from a Government 
Payment. All research and resolution for any misapplied, misposted or misdirected Government Payments will 
be the sole responsibility of you and not of us.
