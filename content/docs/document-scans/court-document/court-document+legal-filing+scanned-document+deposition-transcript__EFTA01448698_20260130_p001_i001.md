conflicting strategies. Employees of DBSI shall have no obligation to recommend to Client, or inform Client of, strategies 
being pursued by DBSI or other Clients. Further, (i) DBSI and its affiliates may provide services for a fee to or solicit business

fund assets). DBSI also participates in a program offered by Pershing, under which DBSI shares in revenue received by 
Pershing from mutual funds offered on the Pershing platform. All of these payments may vary based on sales volume or 
assets under management and may give DBSI a financial incentive to recommend certain funds or strategies and to include 
those funds in models and programs. In addition, DBSI may receive trail compensation in connection with sales of auction 
rate securities.

margin loan, investing in a partnership or limited liability company that generates UBTI or other leverage or loan 
arrangements. Tax-exempt entities should consult with their tax adviser before making an investment or entering into such 
arrangement. If Client's periodic Account Statement indicates that any Securities were forwarded to Client and Client has not
