the racist violence in Charlottesville — is preparing to march on Brussels. L=unching, he told the Daily Beast himself, a 
new non-profit foundation call=d The Movement, (II Movimento), right in the heart of Europe and its insti=utions. 
Through which he hopes to coordinate the populist right in view of the European elections which will be held in=spring 
2019. 
Object=ve: to compete with George Soros, the American billionaire of 
Hungarian or=gin, benefactor of the Democratic party, who since 1984 with his Open Soci=ty has spent at least $32 
billion in support of NGOs dealing with human rights. And for this he became the b=geyman of the populist right, 
accused of plots of all kinds: including tha= of wanting to replace Italians with immigrants in order to have labour at=low 
cost. A mantra repeated in the past on Twitter also by the current Minister of the Interior Matteo Sa=vini. 
The am=ition of Steve Bannon, former director of the alt-right American site 
Brei=bart — which in the European campaign preceded him since the platf=rm had already opened bureaux in London 
and Rome — is therefore to become the coordinator of the one great 40=804,populist international" of which he has 
long since been dream=ng. 
The Movement, in fact, intends to funct=on as an extreme right-wing think tank: 
a source of strategic advice to ch=nnel the not-so•politically structured discontent of the most extreme Euro=ean 
movements. Analysing data and giving strategic advice. But also by raising funds and channeling funding.=/div> 
The aim is to create a populist allianc=, a sort of "super group" that if victorious 
can conquer u= to a third of the European Parliament in the elections next May. 
Indeed — putting the common pol=cy of the Old Continent in the hands of 
Bannon and his own. The American s=rategist is very attached to the Freedom Caucus — the extreme righ= of the US 
Congress — and in 2014 he was at the top of the Cambridge Analytica company, which in 2016 used data stolen from 
Fa=ebook to try to influence the presidential election from which Donald Trum= emerged victor. It is not a mystery that 
for a long time he courts nation=lists of the right from East to West. And he has already met, among others, the 
Hungarian Orban, the =rench Marine Le Pen and the former leader of the British separatists Nigel=Farage. The latter 
reappeared, coincidentally, on Friday in Pennsylvania, =SA, to a fundraiser in favor of the Republican congressman Lou 
Barletta. Without forgetting the Italians of Le=a and 5 stars. Of them, he said: "If it works in Italy, we can import=the 
model anywhere". 
The Movement, which for now will count =n a staff of 10 people, will be fully 
operational in 2019. In short, after=the American midterm elections, where Bannon is fighting to influence the =rimaries 
supporting candidates potentially able to undermine the prospects of Republican establishment. But in the fu=ure the 
former spin doctor says he wants to spend more and more time in Eu=ope. Also because the relationships with Trump 
have worsened after the rev=lations he made to Michael Wolff and published in the scandal book "Fire and Fury". 
40=9CBetter to reign in Hell than to serve in Paradise," Bannon says =ow paraphrasing the Satan of one of his favorite 
books, John Milton's =ost Paradise. Hell in this case would be the dear old Europe and its democratic values. The "army 
of darkness" is already among=us. 
In Sacratissimo Corde lesu et Purissimo Corde Mariae et Castissim= Corde 
loseph.
