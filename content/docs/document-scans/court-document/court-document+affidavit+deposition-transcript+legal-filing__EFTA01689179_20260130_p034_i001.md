Re: Case Number: 31E-MM-108062 
Door 
Your name was referred to the FBI's Victim Assistance Program as being a possible victim of a federal 
crime. We appreciate your assistance and cooperation while we are investigating this case. We would Ike to 
make you aware of the victim services that may be available to you and to answer any questions you may have 
regarding the criminal justice process throughout the investigation. Our program is part of the FBI's effort to 
ensure the victims are treated with respect and are provided information about their rights under federal law. 
These rights include notification of the status of the case. The enclosed brochures provide information about 
the FBI's Victim Assistance Program, resources and instructions for accessing the Victim Notification System 
(VNS). VNS is designed to provide you with information regarding the status of your case. 
This case is currently under Investigation. This can be a lengthy process and we request your 
continued patience while we conduct a thorough investigation. 
As a crime victim, you have the following rights under 18 United States Code § 3771: (1) The right to 
be reasonably protected from the accused; (2) The right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any 
public court proceeding, or any parole proceeding, involving the crime or of any release or escape of the 
accused; (3) The right not to be excluded from any such public court proceeding, unless the court, after 
receiving clear and convincing evidence, determines that testimony by the victim would be materially altered if 
the victim heard other testimony at that proceeding; (4) The right to be reasonably heard at any public 
proceeding in the district court involving release, plea, sentencing, or any parole proceeding; (5) The 
reasonable right to confer with the attorney for the Government in the case; (6) The right to fill and timely 
restitution as provided in law; (7) The right to proceedings free from unreasonable delay; (8) The right to be 
treated with fairness and with respect for the victim's dignity and privacy. 
We will make our best efforts to ensure you are accorded the rights described. Most of these rights 
pertain to events occurring after the arrest or indictment of an individual for the crime, and it will become the 
responsibility of the prosecuting United States Attorneys Office to ensure you are accorded those rights. You 
may also seek the advice of a private attorney with respect to these rights. 
The Victim Notification System (VNS) is designed to provide you with direct information regarding the 
case as It proceeds through the criminal justice system. You may obtain current information about this matter
