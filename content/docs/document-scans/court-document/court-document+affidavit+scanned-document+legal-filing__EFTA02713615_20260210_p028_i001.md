CERTAIN RISK FACTORS 
An investment in the Partnership involves substantial risks, and prospective investors 
should carefully consider, among other factors, the risks described below. These risk factors are 
not intended to be an exhaustive listing of all potential risks associated with an investment in the 
Partnership: 
No Operating History. The Partnership is a newly formed entity and has no operating 
history upon which investors can evaluate the likely performance of the Partnership. The prior 
performance of any other entity or account managed by the General Partner, the Investment 
Manager or Ari Glass, including, without limitation, Boothbay Hybrid Fund, LP (the "Hybrid 
Fund"), or any other entity with which Mr. Glass is or has been affiliated, should not be relied 
upon to predict the future performance of the Partnership. 
Business Dependent Upon Key Individual. The Limited Partners will have no authority 
to make decisions or to exercise business discretion on behalf of the Partnership. The authority 
for all such decisions is delegated to the General Partner and the Investment Manager. The 
success of the Partnership, therefore, is expected to be significantly dependent upon the expertise 
and efforts of the General Partner and the Investment Manager and, more particularly, of Mr. 
Glass. (See "General Partner; Investment Manager.") The ownership and control of one or 
both of the General Partner and the Investment Manager may change without the approval of the 
Limited Partners. 
Concentration of Investments. 
The Investment Manager will seek to diversify the 
Partnership's portfolio (see "Investment Program"). Nevertheless, at times the Partnership may 
have a relatively large exposure to a single issuer or group of affiliated issuers, or to a specific 
geographic location or a single investment strategy. Losses incurred in those investments could 
have a material adverse effect on the Partnership's overall financial condition. This is because 
the value of Interests will be more susceptible to any single occurrence affecting one or more of 
those issuers, geographic areas or strategies than would be the case with a more diversified 
investment portfolio. 
Absence of Regulatory Oversight. While the Partnership may be considered similar to an 
investment company, it is not and will not be registered as such under the Investment Company 
Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"), in reliance upon an exemption available to privately 
offered investment companies and, accordingly, the provisions of the 1940 Act (which, among 
other things, require investment companies to have a majority of disinterested directors, require 
securities held in custody to be individually segregated at all times from the securities of any 
other person and to be marked to clearly identify such securities as the property of such 
investment company, and regulate the relationship between the advisor and the investment 
company) are not applicable. These provisions will also not be applicable to most, if not all, 
Portfolio Managers with which the Partnership invests. Because securities of the Partnership
