is similar to the business of the Partnership, and neither the Partnership nor any Limited Partner 
will have any rights in or to such ventures or the income or profits derived therefrom. 
Valuation of Partnership Assets. The Partnership's securities and other assets will be 
valued by the General Partner in accordance with the terms of the Limited Partnership 
Agreement and in accordance with GAAP. If market quotations are not readily available for 
certain securities and/or assets held by the Partnership, the valuation of such securities and assets 
will be determined by the General Partner in its discretion. All matters concerning valuation of 
securities, allocations among the Partners and accounting procedures, not expressly provided for 
in the Limited Partnership Agreement, may be determined by the General Partner, whose 
determination is final and conclusive as to all Partners. The General Partner may, from time to 
time, also establish or abolish reserves for estimated or accrued expenses and for unknown or 
contingent liabilities (whether or not required by GAAP). 
Withdrawals. Subject to the conditions described below, a Limited Partner may make a 
withdrawal of capital from his Capital Account as of the last day of any calendar quarter (a 
"Withdrawal Date"); provided that if a Limited Partner withdraws any capital from a Capital 
Account prior to the day immediately preceding the one (I) year anniversary of the contribution 
of such capital to the Partnership, such withdrawal will be subject to an early withdrawal charge 
for the benefit of the Partnership equal to four percent (4%) of the net asset value of the capital 
being withdrawn (the "Early Withdrawal Charge"). Withdrawals will be deemed made on a 
first-in, first-out basis for this purpose. 
Investor Gate 
A Limited Partner may withdraw only up to fifty percent (50%) of the value of his 
Capital Account as of any Withdrawal Date (such limitation, the "Investor Gate" and the 
amount permitted to be withdrawn pursuant to the Investor Gate, the "Maximum Amount"), 
unless such Investor Gate is waived by the General Partner, in its discretion. If a Limited Partner 
submits a request to withdraw more than the Maximum Amount as of a single Withdrawal Date 
(such date, the "Gated Withdrawal Date"), capital will be withdrawn from the Partnership 
without any further action required of such Limited Partner (including any gains or losses 
thereon) as follows: 
(a) 
First, as of the Gated Withdrawal Date, the Limited Partner will be 
deemed to have withdrawn capital from his Capital Account equal to the Maximum 
Amount; and 
(b) 
Second, as of the Withdrawal Date immediately following the Gated 
Withdrawal Date, the Limited Partner will be deemed to have withdrawn capital from his 
Capital Account equal to the amount requested to be withdrawn on the Gated Withdrawal 
Date but not satisfied as a result of the Investor Gate. 
Capital not withdrawn as a result of the Investor Gate will remain invested in the 
Partnership and will increase or decrease based upon the performance of the Partnership until the 
effective date of the withdrawal of such capital.
