The transacting parties arc responsible for the negotiation and preparation of any contract(s) 
involving the purchase(s) and sale(s) of the aircraft involved in the transaction. IATS shall have no 
responsibility whatsoever for the contents of any contract(s). If more than one contract is involved, IATS 
shall have no responsibility to make a comparison of the contracts to evaluate whether there are any 
inconsistencies between the terms of the contracts, arid IATS shall have no liability or responsibility 
whatsoever for any inconsistencies between the terms of any contracts. 
Upon confirmation by IATS that IATS is holding the documents contemplated by the contract(s) 
(or as otherwise authorized by the transacting parties) and escrowed funds in an amount necessary to 
close the transaction(s) contemplated by the contract(s) delivered to IATS, the transacting parties shall 
authorize IATS to consummate and close the sale(s) and purchase(s) contemplated by the contract(s), and 
upon receipt of such authorization IATS is authorized and directed to release the documents as 
contemplated by the contract(s) and disburse the escrowed funds in accordance with the terms 
contemplated by the contract(s) or as otherwise instructed by the parties. 
In accepting any funds or documents delivered to IATS, it is agreed and understood that IATS 
will not be called upon to construe any contract or instrument deposited. In the event that IATS deems it 
necessary or advisable, in its sole discretion, to employ attorneys for the reasonable protection of the 
escrow property and/or of itself, IATS shall have the right to be reimbursed by the transacting parties for 
any attorneys' fees incurred. Should a transaction fail to close for any reason, the transacting parties will 
be charged a handling fee (minimum of 5150.00), plus all incurred expenses, which may be retained from 
the funds held by IATS. 
In the event of a dispute between the transacting parties, IATS reserves the right to hold any 
money in its possession, and all papers in connection with or concerning this escrow, until a mutual 
agreement in writing has been reached between all of said parties and delivered to it or until delivery is 
legally authorized and ordered by final judgment or decree of the United States District Court for the 
Western District of Oklahoma, the District Court of Oklahoma County, Oklahoma, or other court of 
competent jurisdiction; and in case IATS obeys or complies with any judgment, order or decree of a court 
of competent jurisdiction, it shall not be liable to any of the transacting parties nor to any other person or 
entity by reason of such compliance, notwithstanding any such judgment, order or decree be subsequently 
reversed, modified, annulled, set aside or vacated. IATS shall not be liable for any acts or omissions done 
in good faith, nor for any claims, demands or losses, nor for any damages made or suffered by any party, 
except such as may arise through or be caused by its bad faith or gross negligence. 
These Terms and Conditions and the services provided by IATS shall be governed by and 
construed in accordance with the law of the State of Oklahoma. Notwithstanding any provision contained 
in any purchase agreement or other agreement between a purchaser and seller, the District Court of 
Oklahoma County, Oklahoma, or the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma 
shall have exclusive jurisdiction to hear all disputes against IATS and no other courts shall have any 
jurisdiction whatsoever in respect of such disputes against IATS. The foregoing shall not affect the 
governing law and/or jurisdiction and venue provisions in any agreement between a seller and purchaser 
to the extent that any dispute does not involve IATS in any manner. 
These Terms and Conditions govern all duties and liabilities of IATS notwithstanding any terms 
contained in any contract between the transacting parties, and in the event of any inconsistency between 
these Terms and Conditions and any such contract, these Terms and Conditions shall govern.
