organized under the laws of a relevant member state (each, a "Member State) of the European Economic Area 
("EEA')I when such marketing is reasonably likely to give rise to the application of any requirement of the 
AIFM Directive to the General Partner or the Investment Manager. In the event a prospective investor 
inadvertently receives this Memorandum while located in the EEA, the prospective investor should disregard 
this Memorandum and return the Memorandum to the applicable Placement Agent (as defined below). 
Investment in the Access Fund is suitable only for sophisticated investors and requires the financial ability and 
willingness to accept the high risks and lack of liquidity inherent in an investment in the Access Fund. Investors 
in the Access Fund must be prepared to bear such risks for an extended period of time. No assurance can be 
given that the Access Fund's investment objectives will be achieved, that investors will receive a return of their 
capital or that substantial losses will be avoided. Investors could lose the entire value of their investment. 
Purchasers of Interests will not be limited partners of the Underlying Fund, will have no direct interest in 
the Underlying Fund, will have no voting rights in the Underlying Fund and will have no standing or 
recourse, and may not bring an action against, the Underlying Fund or the general partner of the 
Underlying Fund (the "Glendower GP") and their respective affiliates or any of their respective advisors, 
officers, directors, employees, partners or members (together with the Glendower GP, Glendower Capital, 
LLP and Glendower Capital (U.S.), LLC, "Glendower") for any breach of the Underlying Fund LPA. To 
the fullest extent permitted by law, the Access Fund may bring legal action against the Underlying Fund 
or Glendower only at the initiative of the General Partner or the Investment Manager, as a delegate of 
the General Partner. None of the Underlying Fund or Glendower: (i) is responsible for the organization, 
operation or management of the Access Fund; (ii) has participated in, or is responsible for, the offering of 
Interests; (iii) has participated, or will participate, in the preparation of, or shall be responsible for, the 
contents of any of this Memorandum (other than Appendix A), the Partnership Agreement, the 
subscription agreement and related documents thereto, (the "Subscription Agreement") or any related 
agreements, instruments or accompanying sales documentation; (iv) makes any representation with 
respect to the adequacy or sufficiency of the information contained in this Memorandum to any investor 
in the Access Fund regarding the Underlying Fund or undertakes any responsibility to update any 
information contained herein for the purpose of the offering of Interests; (v) has endorsed or made any 
recommendations, representations or warranties with respect to the Interests; or (vi) is acting as a 
fiduciary or is providing investment advice with respect to the Interests. Furthermore, Glendower has 
not made any representation or warranty, express or implied, with respect to the fairness, correctness, 
accuracy, reasonableness or completeness of any of the information contained in this Memorandum, and 
it expressly disclaims any responsibility or liability therefor. Glendower has no responsibility to update 
any of the information provided in this Memorandum. The information contained herein relating to the 
Underlying Fund, including, the information contained in the appendices hereto, was obtained from 
Glendower. Such information contained in this Memorandum does not purport to be complete and is 
subject to the more detailed information in the Underlying Fund PPM and the operational documents of 
the Underlying Fund, which documents may be amended, restated or otherwise modified from time to 
time. None of the Placement Agents, the Access Fund, the General Partner or the Investment Manager 
participated in the preparation of such documents or any underlying information obtained from such 
documents or conducted any due diligence or verification efforts with respect thereto, and none of them 
makes any representation regarding, and each of them expressly disclaims any liability or responsibility' 
to any Investor in the Access Fund for, such information or any other information relating to the 
Underlying Fund set forth therein or omitted therefrom. The offering of Interests is not, and should not 
be considered, an offering of interests in the Underlying Fund. Although the Access Fund is being 
established to invest in the Underlying Fund, the Access Fund is not an affiliate of the Underlying Fund 
or Glendower and an investment in the Access Fund is different from an investment in the Underlying 
Fund. Furthermore, the offering of Interests is not, and should not be considered, an offering of direct or
