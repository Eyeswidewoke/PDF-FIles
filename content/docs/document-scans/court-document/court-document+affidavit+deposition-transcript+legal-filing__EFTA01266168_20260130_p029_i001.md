this paragraph to give a power of appointment or to eliminate a power of appointment; 
K. 
To renounce and disclaim, in whole or in part, and in accordance with 
applicable law, any assets, interests, rights, or powers (including any power of appointment) 
which arc payable to (or exercisable by) such trust or over which the Trustees have any right, 
title, interest, or power; and 
L. 
To make, execute, and deliver any and all such instruments in writing as 
shall be necessary or proper to carry out any power, right, duty, or obligation of the Trustees or 
any disposition whatsoever of such trust or any asset of such trust and to exercise any and all 
other powers incidental or necessary to carry out or to fulfill the terms, provisions and purposes 
of such trust. 
Section 6.5. - Restrictions on Exercise of The Trustee's Powers 
A. 
Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, a 
Trustee shall not participate in a discretionary decision to exercise or not exercise any fiduciary 
power to (1) distribute income from or principal of any trust hereunder to himself or herself; or 
(2) distribute income from or principal of any trust hereunder for the health, support, 
maintenance or education of a Beneficiary if such Trustee has a legal obligation to provide for 
the health, support, maintenance or education of such Beneficiary from such Trustee's personal 
assets. For purposes of this paragraph, a person whose interest in a trust hereunder is limited to 
a remote contingent interest (for example, a contingent remainderman whose interest depends 
upon another person failing to survive to a specified age or a person designated to receive assets 
only in the event a power of appointment is not exercised) shall not be treated as a person who 
is or may be a Beneficiary of such trust. 
B. 
A Trustee of any trust hereunder may by a written notice delivered to the 
other Trustee (or Trustees) of such trust decline to participate in the decision to exercise or not 
exercise any fiduciary power granted by this Agreement or bylaw. 
C. 
If a Trustee of any trust hereunder is not empowered (because of a 
conflict of interest, declination to act or otherwise) to participate in the decision to exercise or 
not exercise any fiduciary power granted by this Agreement or by law, then the remaining 
Trustee or Trustees of such trust shall be empowered to make such decision. If no Trustee or 
successor Trustee is empowered to participate in such decision, the Trustees may designate a 
substitute Trustee to serve as Trustee of such trust who shall be empowered to make such 
decision but has no other power or authority of the Trustees. Such designation shall be by 
written notice delivered to such substitute Trustee.
