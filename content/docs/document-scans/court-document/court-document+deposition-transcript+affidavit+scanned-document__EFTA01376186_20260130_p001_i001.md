Notwithstanding the foregoing paragraph, (x) except with respect to ERISA Limited 
Securities purchased on the Closing Date by Controlling Persons, ERISA Limited Securities held 
by Benefit Plan Investors or Controlling Persons and (y) Subordinated Notes held by Accredited 
Investors may only be held in the form of Definitive Securities. 
(h) 
This Section 2.2(h) shall apply only to Global Securities deposited with or on 
behalf of the Depository. The Applicable Issuer shall execute and the Trustee shall, in 
accordance with this Section 2.2(h), authenticate and deliver initially one or more Global 
Securities that (i) shall be registered in the name of the nominee of the Depository for such 
Global Security or Global Securities and (ii) shall be delivered by the Trustee to such Depository 
or pursuant to such Depository's instructions or held by the Trustee as custodian for the 
Depository. The aggregate principal amount of the Global Securities may from time to time be 
increased or decreased by adjustments made on the records of the Trustee and the Depository (or 
its nominee), as the case may be, as hereinafter provided. 
Agent Members shall have no rights under this Indenture with respect to any such Global 
Securities held on their behalf by the Trustee, as custodian for the Depository, or under the

action on behalf of the registered holder of, or holders of beneficial interests in, such Global 
Security, except as provided in the governing documents with the Depository.

prior to the authentication and delivery of such Security or did not hold such offices at the date of 
issuance of such Security. 
(c) 
At any time and from time to time after the execution and delivery of this
