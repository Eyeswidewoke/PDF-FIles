The Investment Manager, in its discretion, may also cause the Partnership to buy and/or 
sell investments directly from/to one or more Other Accounts, subject to compliance with 
applicable law. 
The Investment Manager, the General Partner and their respective affiliates may invest 
and trade for their own accounts, as well as the Other Accounts, in the same capacity as the 
Partnership and in the same investments as the Partnership. The Investment Manager, the 
General Partner and their respective affiliates may also initiate transactions, trade more or less 
frequently for their own accounts or the Other Accounts, and trade and invest in certain 
investments without doing the same for the Partnership. Although the Investment Manager, the 
General Partner and their respective affiliates may engage in other activities which may, in some 
cases, provide an indirect benefit to the Partnership, in other cases such activities may create 
conflicts of interest with the Partnership. 
Other Business Relationships of the Portfolio Managers 
Each of the Portfolio Managers devotes as much of its time and resources to the activities 
of the Partnership as it deems necessary and appropriate and in accordance with the terms of its 
offering document, operating agreement or advisory agreement, as applicable. Certain of the 
Portfolio Managers are not restricted from entering into other investment advisory relationships 
or engaging in other business activities, even though such activities may be in competition with 
the Partnership and/or may involve substantial amounts of such Portfolio Manager's time and 
resources. These activities could be viewed as creating a conflict of interest in that the Portfolio 
Manager is not exclusively devoting its resources to the business of the Partnership but must 
allocate such resources between that business and other activities. Other investment accounts 
managed by a Portfolio Manager could have compensation and profit sharing arrangements that 
differ from those provided in its agreement with the Partnership which may create incentives that 
could affect the Portfolio Manager's decisions as to how to allocate time, resources and 
investment opportunities. 
Transaction Execution and Investment Opportunities 
Conflicts of interest could also arise in connection with transactions for the accounts of 
the Partnership, other investment vehicles in which the Investment Manager or its affiliates are 
involved, and any other advisory clients of the Investment Manager. These transactions could 
differ in substance, timing and amount, due to, among other things, differences in investment 
objectives or other factors affecting the appropriateness or suitability of particular investment 
activities to the Partnership or other clients, or to limitations on the availability of particular 
investment or transactional opportunities. The Investment Manager will allocate transactions 
and opportunities among the Partnership and the Other Accounts in a manner it believes to be as 
equitable as reasonably practicable, considering each account's objectives, programs, limitations 
and capital available for investment, but all accounts may not necessarily invest in the same 
opportunities. Furthermore, neither the Investment Manager nor its affiliates has any obligation 
to provide the Partnership with any particular investment opportunity or to refrain from taking 
advantage of an investment opportunity that could be beneficial to the Partnership.
