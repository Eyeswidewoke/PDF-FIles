Case of Jeffrey Epstein - Billionaire Financier (New York, NY; Palm Beach, FL; Santa... Page 12 of 32 
"I must urge you to examine the unusual course that your office's handling of this matter has taken and 
consider if good and sufficient reason exists to require your disqualification from the prosecution of 
these cases," Reiter wrote in a May 1 memo to Krischer. 
While not commenting specifically on the Epstein case, Mike Edmondson, spokesman for the state 
attorney, said his office presents cases other than murders to a grand jury when there are questions about 
witnesses' credibility and their ability to testify. 
By the nature of their jobs, police officers look at evidence from a "one-sided perspective," Edmondson 
said. "A prosecutor has to look at it in a much broader fashion," weighing the veracity of witnesses and 
how they may fare under defense attorneys' questioning, he said. 
Epstein's attorney, Jack Goldberger, said his client committed no crimes. 
"The reports and statements in question refer to false accusations that were not charged because the 
Palm Beach County state attorney questioned the credibility of the witnesses," Goldberger said. A 
county grand jury "found the allegations wholly unsubstantiated and not credible," and that's why his 
client was not charged with sexual activity with minors, he said. 
Goldberger said Epstein passed a lie detector test administered by a reputable polygraph examiner in 
which he said he did not know the girls were minors. Also, a search warrant served on Epstein's home 
found no evidence to corroborate the girls' allegations, Goldberger said. 
According to police documents: 
• A Palm Beach Community College student said she gave Epstein a massage in the nude, then 
brought him six girls, ages 14 to 16, for massage and sex-tinged sessions at his home. 
• A 27-year-old woman who worked as Epstein's personal assistant also facilitated the liaisons, 
phoning the PBCC student to arrange for girls when Epstein was coming to town. And she 
escorted the girls upstairs when they arrived, putting fresh sheets on a massage table and placing 
massage oils nearby. 
• Police took sworn statements from five alleged victims and 17 witnesses. They contend that on 
three occasions, Epstein had sex with the girls. 
A money manager for the ultra-rich, Epstein was named one of New York's most eligible bachelors in 
2003 by The New York Post. He reportedly hobnobs with the likes of former President Clinton, former 
Harvard University President Lawrence Summers and Donald Trump, and has lavish homes in 
Manhattan, New Mexico and the Virgin Islands. 
He has contributed tens of thousands of dollars to Democratic Party candidates and organizations, 
including Sen. John Kerry's presidential bid, and the Senate campaigns of Joe Lieberman, Hillary 
Clinton, Christopher Dodd and Charles Schumer. 
Goldberger is one of five attorneys Epstein has retained since he became the subject of an investigation. 
Edmondson said. Among the others: Alan Dershowitz, the well-known Harvard law professor and 
author, who is a friend of Epstein. Dershowitz could not be reached for comment. 
Police said the woman who enlisted young girls for Epstein was 
20, of Royal Palm 
Beach.

major at Palm Beach Community College when she was questioned by police last October. She has an
