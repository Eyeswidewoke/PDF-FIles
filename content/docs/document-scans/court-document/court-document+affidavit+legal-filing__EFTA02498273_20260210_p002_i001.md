between us in the cards. However as I told Reid befo=e he picked up the phone to call you, if he could urge you to suck 
up your h=rt feelings and send me a sincere apology for participating in an arrangeme=t that caused damage to Reid, to 
yourself, to me, and to our
(who h=s been fighting tears all weekend because of his mother's pain and because 
h= sees the father figure he has admired his whole life as a weak man who has=lied and cheated to his mother)....if you 
can find it in your heart to ask f=r my forgiveness, I would want very much to forgive you and see you in a li=ht different 
from the one I have seen you in for years. Perhaps you aren't a=are....Reid has told me about his addiction to you before 
and has asked for=my help to break it. He finally found the power to do it because of the dep=hs of his misery and 
unwillingness to proceed through life as a dishonorabl= man. I hope you can find a similarly true friend who can do the 
same=for you. I wish you well, believe it or not. Had you not jumped off the pho=e as quickly as you did (which I 
perfectly well understand) he would have t=ld you this. 
Reid and I have a lot of work=to do together to fix the mess you two have caused, but our love is very 
st=ong and we will get there. I honestly don't want to add to your hurts by ma=ing you think you have destroyed our 
marriage on top of everything else. I c=n't imagine you would have rejoiced had that been the case. You haven't 
des=royed our bond so no worries on that front. It must be hard for you t= understand how deep our relationship is 
since he has not acted that way in=his weak behavior with you. In fact, I think he felt he could act out with y=u, act as 
though his relationship with you was intense and real, precisely b=cause he knew I would be there for him. He is a great 
man with great weakne=ses. That doesn't make him a monster and I don't think you are either. 
Best wishes for your future, 
Ch=ryl Gould 
PS Bob Bauer, a dear friend to m= and to Reid, cares about you a great deal. He might be a good person 
for y=u to draw strength from. He has been a source of comfort and wisdom to me t=rough this. He truly is a wonderful 
man and I have no doubt he would show y=u great kindness.
