Incredible.

Stand outs from the Kleiner Perkins trend report 
The annual release of Kleiner Perkins Internet and digital trends report, all 294 slides of it, has some 
fascinating insights. A couple of things really stand out — such as how quickly China has risen to become 
a formidable global force, Amazon's scale is frightening (for many others), and digital/mobile based 
transactions are accelerating. Examples include how 60% of payments are done digitally, six hours a day 
are spent on a mobile (but mobile device volume growth is now basically zero), eCommerce hit 20% of 
China retail (and fastest growing in the world), US it is at 13%. Amazon R&D & Capex +45% YoY (Apple 
just 5%) and more than any other company and eCommerce sales growth and share is accelerating. 
A Few highlights: 
• 
Internet adoption: As of 2018, half the world population, or about 3.6 billion people, will be on the 
Internet. That's thanks in large part to cheaper Android phones and Wi-Fi becoming more available, 
though individual services will have a tougher time adding new users as the web hits saturation. 
Mobile usage: While smartphone shipments are flat and internet user growth is slowing, U.S. adults 
are spending more time online thanks to mobile, clocking 5.9 hours per day in 2017 versus 5.6 hours in 
2016. 
Mobile ads: People are shifting their time to mobile faster than ad dollars are following, creating a 
$7 billion mobile ad opportunity, though platforms are increasingly responsible for providing safe content 
to host those ads. 
• 
Crypto: Interest in cryptocurrency is exploding as Coinbase's user count has nearly quadrupled 
since January 2017 
Voice: Voice technology is at an inflection point due to speech recognition hitting 95% accuracy and 
the sales explosion for Amazon Echo which went from over 10 million to over 30 million sold in total by 
the end of 2017. 
• 
Subscription services: They're seeing massive adoption, with Netflix up 25%, The New York Times 
up 43%, and Spotify up 48% year-over-year in 2017. A free tier accelerates conversion rates. 
• 
Ecommerce vs Brick & Mortar: Ecommerce growth quickens as now 13% of all retail purchases 
happen online and parcel shipments are rising swiftly, signalling big opportunities for new shopping apps. 
• 
Amazon: More people start product searches on Amazon than search engines now, but Jeff Bezos 
still relies on other surfaces like Facebook and YouTube to inspire people to want things. 
• 
Education: Employees seek retraining and education from YouTube and online courses to keep up 
with new job requirements and pay off skyrocketing student loan debt. 
Freelancing: Employees crave scheduling and work-from-home flexibility, and intemet discovery of 
freelance work led it to grow 3X faster than total workforce growth. The on-demand workforce grew 23% 
in 2017 driven by Uber, Airbnb, Etsy, Upwork, and Doordash. 
Transportation: People are buying fewer cars, keeping them longer, and shifting transportation 
spend to rideshare, which saw rides double in 2017. 
Enterprise: Consumerization of the enterprise through better interfaces is spurring growth for 
companies like Dropbox and Slack. 
• 
China: Alibaba is expanding beyond China with strong gross merchandise volume, though Amazon 
still rules in revenue.
