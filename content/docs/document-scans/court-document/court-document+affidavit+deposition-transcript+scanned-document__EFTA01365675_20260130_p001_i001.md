Section 6.12 Co-Trustees. 
At any time or times, for the purpose of meeting the legal requirements of any 
jurisdiction in which any part of the Collateral may at the time be located, the Co-Issuers and the 
Trustee shall have power to appoint one or more Persons to act as co-trustee (subject to the

this Section 6.12. 
The Co-Issuers shall join with the Trustee in the execution, delivery and 
performance of all instruments and agreements necessary or proper to appoint a co-trustee. If the 
Co-Issuers do not join in such appointment within 15 days after the receipt by them of a request 
to do so, the Trustee shall have the power to make such appointment. 
Should any written instrument from the Co-Issuers be required by any co-trustee 
so appointed, more fully confirming to such co-trustee such property, title, right or power, any

Issuers. The Co-Issuers agree to pay (but only from and to the extent of the Collateral), to the 
extent funds are available therefor under Section 11.1(aXiXA), for any reasonable fees and 
expenses in connection with such appointment.

duties and obligations hereunder in respect of the custody of securities, Cash and other personal 
property held by, or required to be deposited or pledged with, the Trustee hereunder, shall be 
exercised solely by the Trustee; 
(b) 
the rights, powers, duties and obligations hereby conferred or imposed 
upon the Trustee in respect of any property covered by the appointment of a co-trustee shall be 
conferred or imposed upon and exercised or performed by the Trustee or by the Trustee and such 
co-trustee jointly as shall be provided in the instrument appointing such co-trustee; 
(c) 
the Trustee at any time, by an instrument in writing executed by it, with
