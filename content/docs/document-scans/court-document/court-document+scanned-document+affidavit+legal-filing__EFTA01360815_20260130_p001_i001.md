WE ASSIGNED YOU AN EMPLOYER IDENTIFICATION NUMBER 
Thank 
for applying for an Employer Identification Number (BIN). We assigned you 
EIN 
This BIN will identify you, your business accounts, tax returns, and 
documents, even if you have no employees. Please keep this notice in your permanent 
records. 
When filing tax documents, payments, and related correspondence, it is very important 
that you use your EIN and complete name and address exactly as shown above. Any variation 
may cause a delay in processing, result in incorrect information in your account, or even 
cause you to be assigned more than one SIN. If the information is not correct as shown 
above, please make the correction using the attached tear off stub and return it to us. 
A limited liability company (LLC) may file Form 8832, Entity Classification Election, 
and elect to be classified as an association taxable as a corporation. If the LLC is 
eligible to be treated as a corporation that meets certain tests and it will be electing S 
corporation status, it must timely file Form 2553, Election by a Small Business 
Corporation. The LLC will be treated as a corporation as of the effective date of the S 
corporation election and does not need to file Porn 8832. 
To obtain tax forms and publications, including those referenced in this notice, 
visit our Web site at www.irs.gov. If you do not have access to the Internet, call 
1-800-829-3676 (TTY/TDD 1-800-829-4059) or visit your local IRS office.

your federal tax forms. 
* Refer to this BIN on your tax-related correspondence and documents. 
If you have questions about your EIN, you can call us at the phone number or write to 
us at the address shown at the top of this notice. If you write, please tear off the stub 
at the bottom of this notice and send it along with your letter. If you do not need to
