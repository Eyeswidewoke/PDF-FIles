HUBUS133 Alpha Group Capital 
Term. The Partnership will continue until the earlier of (i) a determination by the General 
Partner that the Partnership should be dissolved or (ii) the termination, bankruptcy, insolvency, 
dissolution or withdrawal of the General Partner. 
Upon a determination to dissolve the 
Partnership, withdrawals and distributions in respect thereof may not be made. 
Capital Accounts. The initial capital contribution and each additional capital contribution 
of a Partner will be credited to a single capital account (each, a "Capital Account") established for 
such Partner. Additional capital contributions by an existing Partner will be placed in the original 
Capital Account. A partnership percentage ("Partnership Percentage") will be determined for each 
Partner for each accounting period by dividing its Capital Account as of the beginning of such 
accounting period by the aggregate Capital Accounts of all Partners as of the beginning of such 
accounting period. 
At the beginning of each accounting period of the Partnership, each Capital Account will 
be decreased by the amount of any withdrawals made by such Partner from such Capital Account 
on a Withdrawal Date as of the end of the immediately preceding accounting period and any 
distributions from such Capital Account made to such Partner. At the end of each accounting 
period of the Partnership, each Capital Account will be increased by its share of any net capital 
appreciation, or decreased by its share of any net capital depreciation, for such period. At the end 
of each month, each Capital Account of a Limited Partner will (except as otherwise provided 
herein) be decreased by the amortized amount of the Management Fee paid in respect of such 
Capital Account as of the beginning of the quarter in which such month falls. 
Additional Capital Contributions. Partners may make additional capital contributions and 
new Partners may be admitted to the Partnership as of the first business day of each calendar 
month. In addition, subject to the sole discretion of the General Partner, contributions by existing 
Partners and admissions of new Partners may be permitted at other times. The General Partner 
may, in its sole discretion, reject any subscription. A "business day" means Monday through Friday, 
other than bank holidays in New York City. 
Management. The management of the Partnership is vested exclusively in the General 
Partner. Except as authorized by the General Partner, the Limited Partners will have no part in the 
management of the Partnership and will have no authority or right to act on behalf of the 
Partnership in connection with any matter. The General Partner and any affiliate may engage in 
any other business venture, whether or not such business is similar to the business of the 
Partnership, and neither the Partnership nor any Limited Partner will have any rights in or to such 
ventures or the income or profits derived therefrom. 
Valuation of Partnership Assets. Because all of the investable assets of the Partnership will 
be invested in the Master Fund and the HB Fund, the value of the Partnership's assets and liabilities 
will be primarily based on the value of the Master Fund's and HB Fund's assets and liabilities, 
which will be valued in accordance with the valuation policies of the Master Fund and the FIB 
Fund. 
These policies, and the policies of the Partnership, include the following:
