• CSIS: Can Multinationals Win in China? Lessons from Apple's Experience — Wednesday, July 2, 2025. 
Location: Online event, 9:00 AM. The world's largest multinationals are all in China, and when surveyed, a 
majority report that they are making a profit there. Yet there is a widespread view that China's business 
landscape is heavily tilted in favor of domestic firms and that in strategic industries, foreign companies are 
primarily helping their Chinese competitors to catch up and displace them rather than helping themselves 
grow and maintain their advantages. There is a parallel debate about whether multinationals operating in 
China have helped to marketize the economy and made society more open, or whether these investors have 
instead become complicit in supporting the illiberal foundations of Chinese Communist Party rule. 
• CSIS: The Impossible State Live Podcast: Special Conversation with Senator Andy Kim — Wednesday, July 2, 
2025. Location: Online event, 11:00 AM. Please join us for a bonus episode of the Impossible State Live

• AEI: Holding Colleges Accountable: From Graduation to Gainful Employment — Wednesday, July 2, 2025. 
Location: Online event, 4:00 PM. Recent legislative proposals in the House and Senate signal heightened 
interest in making colleges financially responsible for students' outcomes. The House's version of the "One 
Big Beautiful Bill" contains a "risk-sharing" provision requiring colleges to repay a portion of the federal 
student debt that their graduates fail to repay. The Senate version omits this provision, but it raises the 
stakes by demanding that colleges demonstrate a positive return on investment to retain access to federal 
student loans. These proposals reflect a growing focus on the federal role in ensuring colleges' and 
universities' program quality and economic value.
