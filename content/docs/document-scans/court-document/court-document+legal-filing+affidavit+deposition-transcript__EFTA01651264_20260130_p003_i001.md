AG says Epstein lawyers have agreed to revise victim 
compensation fund protocol 
• Jun 1, 2020 
Attorneys for sex offender Jeffrey Epstein's estate and the Virgin Islands government have resolved disputes 
over a proposed victims' compensation fund, and V.I. Attorney General Denise George said she "will allow the 
release of a portion of estate funds for the victims so that the program may proceed." 
George issued the written statement Friday, saying that her office has reached an "agreement in principle" for a 
victim compensation program with the estate's and victims' attorneys. 
The estate proposed the fund in November as a way for Epstein's victims to receive compensation without 
having to go to court, after Epstein died by suicide in a Manhattan jail cell on Aug. 10 while awaiting trial on 
new charges. 
In January, George filed a civil enforcement action under the territory's Criminally Influenced and Corrupt 
Organizations Act against Epstein's estate and six of his companies, claiming that Epstein and his attorneys used 
the Economic Development Commission's tax benefit program to save millions of dollars that helped fund his 
criminal sex trafficking operation. 
As part of that action, George placed liens on the more than $600 million estate that have restricted his attorneys 
from paying settlements to victims, and argued that the terms of the compensation fund are illegal and help 
protect others who conspired with Epstein to abuse dozens of women over the last two decades. 
V.I. Superior Court Judge Carolyn Hermon-Purcell has said she cannot move forward with probate until George 
and Epstein's attorneys resolved their differences, and George lifts the liens. 
George said in the statement Friday that she's now willing to do that, and "the Attorney General's Office, 
working closely with Epstein's victims and their counsel, have now reached an agreement upon the terms of the 
fund, which include a set of reforms that provide a process that will be more fair, credible, and victim-oriented." 
George said she's always supported the existence of such a fund, which "would allow victims to avoid the 
publicity and trauma of a trial and provide them, promptly, with a measure of justice and closure," according to 
the statement. "The victim compensation fund as it stands now, is a substantial improvement from the original 
victims' claim fund proposed by the estate." 
According to George, the victim compensation fund now includes: 
• Involvement of victim advocate Marci Hamilton, CEO of Child USA and the country's preeminent expert and 
advocate on child sexual abuse issues. This will help ensure that the decisions of the fund administrator are fully 
informed by and sensitive to the unique experiences and needs of survivors of trafficking and sexual abuse. 
• Dedicated funding to ensure that victims who have not yet come forward or who are not satisfied with the 
claims process or award can opt-out without sacrificing the chance of a judgment or recovery. 
• Protections to ensure that information shared by victims in the claims process is not provided to the estate and, 
potentially, used against the claimant or other victims. 
• Access to counseling and referral services through the FBI Victim Services program and Child USA. 
• Approval of the program's administrative budget by the Probate Court and monthly reporting to the Attorney 
General's Office and the Probate Court on the number and value of claim awards. 
"The attorney general opposed the estate's initial demand that, in order to obtain funds under the program, 
victims be required to sign broad releases to protect other individuals who sexually abused them. With that broad 
release in place, the Fund could not ensure a fundamentally fair and legally sufficient process for victims who 
choose to participate," according to the statement. "The parties now agree, and the program administrator has
