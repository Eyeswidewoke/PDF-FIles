(and any amendments thereto) in furtherance of the Company's purpose, without any further act, 
vote or approval of any person or entity, including any Member, notwithstanding any other 
provision of this Agreement. Except as provided in Section 7.1(i), no Member or Members shall 
have the right to remove or replace the Managing Member. 
(b) 
Except to the extent otherwise provided in this Agreement, all matters 
concerning (i) allocations pursuant to Section 2.3, and distributions pursuant to Section 3.1 and 
(ii) accounting procedures and determinations shall be determined by the Managing Member in 
accordance with its reasonable interpretation of the provisions of this Agreement made in good 
faith, whose determination, absent manifest error, shall be final and conclusive as to all the 
Members. 
(c) 
Any assets of the Company that have not been paid out pursuant to Section 
3.2(a) may be invested by the Managing Member, in its sole discretion, in Short-Term 
Investments. 
(d) 
Except as otherwise permitted or contemplated by this Agreement, the 
Company shall not transact business with Affiliates of ICG without approval of a Majority in 
Interest of the Members. 
Section 5.2 
No Transfer of Interest: No Withdrawal or Loans. The Managing 
Member will not sell, assign, pledge, mortgage or otherwise dispose of its Interest in the 
Company without the consent of a Majority in Interest of the Members, provided that the 
Managing Member may transfer all of its Interest to a controlled Affiliate of Andrew L. Farkas 
without consent. The Managing Member will not voluntarily withdraw from the Company. In 
the event that the Managing Member assigns its entire interest in the Company in accordance with 
this Agreement, such transferee shall be deemed admitted to the Company as a Managing Member 
immediately prior to such assignment upon execution of this Agreement and such transferee shall 
continue the business of the Company without dissolution. 
Section 5.3 
No Liability to Members. No Member, including the Managing 
Member, and no member, officer, employee, or other agent of the Company (including a person 
having more than one such capacity) (each, a "Covered Person") shall be liable to the Company or 
any Member for any loss, liability, damage or claim incurred by reason of any act or omission 
performed or omitted by such Covered Person in good faith on behalf of the Company, except for 
any such act or omission by such Covered Person that constitutes fraud, gross negligence or 
willful misconduct or a willful breach of this Agreement. Whenever any Covered Person acts in 
accordance with the standard set forth in the immediately preceding sentence, such Person shall 
not be subject to any other or different standard imposed by this Agreement or any relevant 
provisions of law or in equity or otherwise. A Covered Person shall be fully protected in relying 
in good faith upon the records of the Company and upon such information, opinions, reports or 
statements presented to the Company by any person as to matters the Covered Person reasonably 
believes are within such person's professional or expert competence. The provisions of this 
Agreement, to the extent they restrict the duties and liabilities of a Covered Person otherwise 
existing at law or in equity in the absence of this Agreement, are agreed by the Members to 
replace such other duties and liabilities of such Covered Person.
