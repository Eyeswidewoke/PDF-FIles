Section 1.2. 
Assumptions as to Collateral Obligations, Etc. 
(a) 
In connection with all calculations required to be made pursuant to this Indenture 
with respect to Scheduled Distributions on any Pledged Obligation, or any payments on any 
other assets included in the Collateral, and with respect to the income that can be earned on 
Scheduled Distributions on such Pledged Obligations and on any other amounts that may be 
received for deposit in the Collection Account and with respect to the calculation of the 
Coverage Tests, the provisions set forth in this Section 1.2 shall be applied. 
(i) 
All calculations with respect to Scheduled Distributions on the Pledged 
Obligations shall be made on the basis of information as to the terms of each such 
Pledged Obligation and upon report of payments, if any, received on such Pledged 
Obligation that are famished by or on behalf of the obligor of such Pledged Obligation 
and, to the extent they are not manifestly in error, such information or report may be 
conclusively relied upon in making such calculations. 
(ii) 
For purposes of calculating the Coverage Tests and the Class A-1 
Reinvestment Test, except as otherwise specified therein, there shall be excluded all 
future scheduled payments of interest or principal on, or commitment or facility fees with 
respect to, Defaulted Obligations or other payments, including payment of any amounts 
under the Hedge Agreements, as to which the Investment Manager or the Issuer has 
actual knowledge that such payments will not be made. For purposes of calculating the 
Interest Coverage Ratio: 
(A) 
the expected interest income on Pledged Collateral Obligations and 
Eligible Investments and the expected net amount to be received by the Issuer 
under any Hedge Agreements, if any (assuming for this purpose that the notional 
amount of any such Hedge Agreements has not changed since the applicable 
Measurement Date), and the expected interest payable on the Floating Rate Notes 
will be calculated using the interest rates applicable thereto on the applicable 
Measurement Date; and 
(B) 
it will be assumed that after the applicable Measurement Date, or 
with respect to a Measurement Date that occurs on a Determination Date, the 
applicable Distribution Date, no principal payments or payments of Deferred 
Interest are made on the Notes, no Pledged Collateral Obligations are disposed of 
or mature, no Collateral Obligations are acquired and no unscheduled principal 
payments are received on the Pledged Collateral Obligations. 
(iii) 
For each Due Period, the Scheduled Distribution on any Pledged 
Obligation (other than a Defaulted Obligation, which, except for amounts actually 
received on or prior to the applicable date of determination or as otherwise provided in 
this Indenture, shall be assumed to have a Scheduled Distribution of zero) shall be the 
sum of (i) the total amount of payments and collections in respect of such Pledged 
Obligation (including the proceeds of the sale of such Pledged Obligation received during 
the Due Period and not reinvested in Collateral Obligations or retained in the Collection 
Account for subsequent reinvestment pursuant to Section 12.1) that, if paid as scheduled,
