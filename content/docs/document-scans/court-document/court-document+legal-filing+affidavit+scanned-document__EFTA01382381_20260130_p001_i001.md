Amendment No. 3 to Form S-1 
Table of Contents 
number of directors on our board of directors. Following the 50% Trigger Date, the authorized number of directors may be increased or 
decreased only by the affirmative vote of two-thirds of our then-outstanding capital stock. 
Anti-Takeover Effects of Delaware Law and Our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws 
Some provisions of Delaware law and of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could have the effect of delaying, deferring or 
discouraging another party from acquiring control of us. These provisions, which are summarized below, are expected to discourage 
coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids. These provisions are also designed to encourage persons seeking to acquire 
control of us to first negotiate with our board of directors. 
Requirements for Advance Notification of Stockholder Nominations and Proposals 
Our bylaws establish advance notice procedures with respect to stockholder proposals, other than proposals made by or at the 
direction of our board of directors or, prior to the 35% Trigger Date, by the Designated Controlling Stockholder. Our bylaws also establish 
advance notice procedures with respect to the nomination of candidates for election as directors, other than nominations made by or at 
the direction of our board of directors or by a committee appointed by our board of directors. These provisions may have the effect of 
precluding the conduct of certain business at a meeting if the proper procedures are not followed, and may also discourage or deter a 
potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer% own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain 
control of us. 
Calling Special Stockholder Meetings 
Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide that special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by our board of 
directors or by stockholders owning at least 25% in amount of our entire capital stock issued and outstanding, and entitled to vote. 
Stockholder Action by Written Consent 
The DGCL permits stockholder action by written consent unless otherwise provided by our certificate of incorporation. Our 
certificate of incorporation precludes stockholder action by written consent after the 50% Trigger Date. 
Undesignated Preferred Stock 
Our board of directors is authorized to issue, without stockholder approval, preferred stock with such terms as our board of 
directors may determine. The ability to authorize undesignated preferred stock makes it possible for our board of directors to issue one 
or more series of preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to change 
control of the company. 
Delaware Anti-Takeover Statute 
We have elected not to be governed by Section 203 of the DGCL, an anti-takeover law ("Section 203"). This law prohibits a 
publicly-held Delaware corporation from engaging under certain circumstances in a business combination with any interested 
stockholder for a period of three years following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder, unless: 
prior to the date of the transaction, the board of directors of the corporation approved either the business combination or the 
transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder;
