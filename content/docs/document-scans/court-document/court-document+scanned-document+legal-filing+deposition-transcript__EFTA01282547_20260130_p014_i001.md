circumstance which would, if it occurred with respect to payment, delivery or compliance related to a 
Transaction, constitute or give rise to an Illegality or a Force Majeure Event. Such amount will (1) accrue 
interest and otherwise be treated as an Unpaid Amount owing to the other party if subsequently an Early 
Termination Date results from an Event of Default. a Credit Event Upon Merger or an Additional 
Termination Event in respect of which all outstanding Transactions are Affected Transactions and
