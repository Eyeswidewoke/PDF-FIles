exceptions to this prohibition are where the subject is a fugitive or where the mail cover information 
will be used for a forfeiture investigation. In the case where the mail cover is being requested to 
locate a fugitive, clearly identify the fugitive and the specific statute which the fugitive violated, 
including title, section and penalty. State whether whereabouts are known or unknown. 
If the subject is formally charged by indictment or information while the mail cover is in effect, notify 
the CISC Manager immediately to terminate the cover. As stated above, except in fugitive and 
forfeiture cases, mail covers are not continued if the person is indicted or an information is filed for 
the crime upon which the mail cover was requested. In these instances, a new mail cover request 
must be submitted which states as its basis the identification of assets for forfeiture purposes or the 
location of the suspect as a fugitive. 
6. Attorney: 
Mail covers shall not include matter mailed between the mail cover subject and his or her known 
attorney due to attorney client privilege unless the attorney is also a subject under investigation. 
a. If the subject of the mail cover has a known attorney, check the box "Yes". If not, check the box 
"No". If "Yes" is checked, state the attorney's name and address. 
b. If the purpose of the mail cover is to locate a fugitive, state the name and address of known 
attorney(s), or check the box "No" indicating the attorney(s) are not known. 
c. If the subject of the mail cover is an attorney or they are known to be a judicial officer, e.g. judge, 
magistrate, etc., check the box "Yes". If not, check the box "No." 
7. Fugitive: If the cover request involves a fugitive, state the fugitive's name, aliases, and any 
relationship between the fugitive and the mail cover subject. 
8. Forfeiture: In those cases where information is being sought in furtherance of a forfeiture, it will be 
necessary to specify both the legal basis of the forfeiture (facts which describe the forfeiture 
investigation) and applicable statutes which authorize the forfeiture by the requesting agency 
(forfeiture statute and the agency's forfeiture authority). 
9. Violation: In a case where the cover is being requested to develop information for a criminal 
investigation, cite the specific applicable statute, that is within the jurisdiction of your agency, with a 
description of the violation, and the penalty provided under the code (e.g., Title 18, United States 
Code, Section 1343, Wire Fraud penalty is five (5) years imprisonment and/or $1,000 fine). A mail 
cover request may be based on a criminal violation of law with the purpose of developing additional 
evidence. A request may also be based on a forfeiture statute with the purpose of identifying and 
locating forfeitable assets. Requests having both criminal and forfeiture bases are acceptable 
provided they set forth the relevant statutes, the agency forfeiture authority, and meet the additional 
requirements of a mail cover. Use of boilerplate language such as "to identify and locate assets" in 
forfeiture requests is discouraged, as the requestor should be specific regarding the forfeitable 
property of a particular subject. Mail cover requests having a forfeiture basis can survive indictment 
of the cover subject since additional information is utilized solely to identify and locate assets 
related to a criminal violation. However, when the subject of a dual request has been charged 
(indictment, information) and investigators are continuing to seek assets or property which may be 
forfeitable, a new mail cover order must be requested in accordance with 39 CFR §233.3(g)(7). 
10. Reasonable Grounds: 
a) "Basis". Provide reasonable grounds that demonstrate the information from the mail cover 
is necessary to develop evidence in a criminal investigation. For example, reasonable 
grounds might be based on information from a confidential informant, public complaint, 
previous investigation, etc. Be specific and concise in outlining the reasonable grounds
