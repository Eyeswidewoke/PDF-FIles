You have present 
as being a credible and reliable source of evidence. She is 
neither. The information that she has given to you and apparently contained within legal proceedings 
is untrue. Our client has at no time engaged in any improper, let alone, unlawful conduct of the 
nature set out in your publications or otherwise. Our client was not aware of any improper or unlawful 
conduct on the part of Jeffrey Epstein. 
Your decision to continue to run with this story in a feeding frenzy around Prince Andrew is doing 
considerable damage to our client's reputation and as a consequence of that she will suffer 
significant financial loss and damage. We hold you fully accountable and responsible for all loss and 
damage our client suffers as a consequence. 
You are already on notice that every time you publish these untrue allegations our client's loss and 
damage increases. We will be drawing the Court's attention in due course, your failure to desist and 
if you continue to publish as you are doing, then we will ask the Court ultimately to award enhanced 
damages to reflect your misconduct. 
Whilst we have previously put these matters to you, we would once again ask you to carefully note 
the following: 
1. Our client was not aware of any improper or unlawful conduct by Jeffery Epstein. 
2. Our client has not been named as a party in any proceedings relating to Jeffrey Epstein's 
unlawful conduct or any other similar conduct by anyone else. 
3. Further, no one has at any time even written to our client making any claims against her. If 
what is being alleged are the genuinely-held beliefs of third parties, the fact that these have 
never even been put to our client is extraordinary and should have indicated to you that they 
were likely to be untrue. 
4. Furthermore, our client has never even been put on notice of any such claim. 
5. Our client has never been contacted by any police force or other law enforcement agency in 
connection with any allegations made against Jeffrey Epstein. 
She has absolutely no 
connection to the criminal prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein and neither was she approached by 
the defence or the prosecution in that matter. 
6. The only legal process that our client has ever received is a subpoena for a deposition in civil 
proceedings brought by 
against Jeffery Epstein and not our client. Our client 
was not required to answer the deposition as she was instructed Mr Epstein had settled the 
case. Our client was merely one of many people who were issued with subpoena's in that 
matter. 
7. One of the lawyers primarily responsible for promoting allegations against Jeffrey Epstein 
was Scott Rothstein. In June 2010, Mr Rothstein was sentenced to 50 years imprisonment 
for his involvement in what is reported to have been the largest ever fraud in Florida, a 
US$1.2 billion ponzi scheme. He is also the primary defendant in a civil law suit based on his 
fraud in which the claim is US$100 billion. He is a man without any shred of credibility. He is 
a proven liar and someone who has sought to manipulate the law to his own advantage. It is 
recorded in Court papers that Mr Rothstein made and pursued false claims against Jeffrey 
Epstein which included promoting allegations of improper conduct of the type you describe.
