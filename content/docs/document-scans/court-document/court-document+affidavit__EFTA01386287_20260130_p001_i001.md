Compaisons to Indices. Alkeon believes that, although the Akeon Funds -which include Growth Strategy, Growth Asia Strategy, Capital Partners Strategy and Select 
Series Strategy - are absolute return vehicles not benChmarked to any index, comparisons to certain indices are useful in evaluating the performance of the Alkeon 
Funds. The MSCI World Index captures large and mid cap representation across 23 developed markets countries. With 1,652 constituents, the index covers 
approximately 85% of the free float-adjusted market capitalization in each country. The MSCI AC World Index captures large and mid cop representation across 23 
developed markets and 23 emerging markets countries. With 2.491 constituents, the index covers approximately 85% of the global investable equity opportunity set. 
The Alkeon Funds' portfolios contain equity securities and may consist of securities issued by companies in different countries with vaying capitalizations and fixed 
income and non-equity investments, including short sales of securities and margin tracing, and ore not as diversified as the securities (when aggregated) that 
comprise the MSCI World Index or the MSCI AC World Index. Unlike the performance of the Alkeon Funds, the performance of the MSCI World Index and MSCI AC 
World Index do not reflect the impact of fees or expenses. The index performance shown does not reflect the reinvestment of dividends and other income. Any such
