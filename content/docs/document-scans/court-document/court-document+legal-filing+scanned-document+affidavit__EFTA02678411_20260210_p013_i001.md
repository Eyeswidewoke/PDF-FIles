Description of IPI's strengths & capacities to implement, manage & monitor progress, 
including: 
IPI Mission Statement 
The International Peace Institute (IPI) is an independent, international not-for-profit think tank with 
offices in New York, across from United Nations headquarters, in Vienna, and a Middle East regional 
office in Manama, Bahrain. IPI is dedicated to promoting the prevention and settlement of conflict by 
strengthening multilateral institutions. It sees peace and security as prerequisites for poverty eradication 
and development. To achieve its purpose, IPI employs a mix of policy research, strategic analysis, 
publishing, and convening. 
The Institute was founded in 1970 as the International Peace Academy (IPA), which focused on training 
military officers and diplomats for United Nations peacekeeping operations. In 2008, the organization 
changed its name to the International Peace Institute to reflect its current identity as a research 
institution that works with and supports multilateral institutions, governments, civil society, and the 
private sector on a range of regional and global security challenges. IPI also carries out work in and on 
Africa, the Middle East, Europe, and Central Asia. 
With a staff from more than twenty countries and a broad range of academic fields, IPI partners with 
regional organizations, think tanks, universities, and NGOs to conduct research, produce publications, 
and convene meetings in many parts of the world. 
■ Missions/goals and current activities related to the Project: 
"Polio Eradication and the Peace and Health Initiative" would in many ways be an extension of 
other IPI projects, allowing IPI to introduce the health perspective into its work and analyze new 
links. For example, IPI has an established track record of work on conflict prevention, mediation, 
and peacebuilding, but IPI will now explore how these tools can be used to reduce the impact of 
conflict on health and development, particularly in fragile states. Similarly, IPI will be able to 
enhance its work on humanitarian issues and transnational threats, respectively, by looking at 
their relationship to the health aspect, as well. 
■ How the Project furthers the specific mission/goals of IPI: 
A new workstream focused on peace and health, starting with polio eradication specifically, will 
be an essential new piece in IPI's work to promote the prevention and settlement of conflict and 
to reduce risk and vulnerability. IPI will carry out analysis on the link between peace and health, 
and present its research findings, with recommendations, to policymakers. This will position IPI 
to expand its work to build the capacity of international institutions—a core component of IPI's 
mission—to address peace and health issues also. 
■ 
Description of IPI's leadership, management & operational structure: IPI is governed by a 
board of directors who convene biannually to address organizational issues and to review and 
approve IPI's annual budget. IPI's President sits on the board of directors and heads IPI's
