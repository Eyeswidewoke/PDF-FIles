With that said, I respectfully identify below the specific objections we have with the 
proposed letter. 
First, it states that "Mr. Epstein has agreed that he will not contest jurisdiction or liability 
if [the alleged victims] elect to seek damages from him ..." This language implies that Mr. 
Epstein has agreed to concede jurisdiction and has waived liability whether or not each 
individual identified by the government as a "victim" of federal crimes ultimately settles her 
claim pursuant to the Agreement. The letter as drafted invites the witnesses to whom it is sent to 
believe that they can litigate their claims without Mr. Epstein being able to contest jurisdiction or 
liability — a construction of the Agreement that is in direct conflict with its terms. The 
Agreement we entered makes clear that Mr. Epstein's waiver of jurisdiction and liability is 
limited to those instances where the identified individual settles with him pursuant to Sections 7 
through 8 of the Agreement and Addendum. As you are well aware, Mr. Epstein has no 
obligation or intention to concede jurisdiction or liability in any claim for damages — by an 
enumerated "victim" or anyone else — where that party fails to settle her claims pursuant to the 
terms of the Agreement. 
Second, there is no basis to refer to Mr. Epstein as a "sexual predator." Pursuant to the 
terms of the Agreement, Mr. Epstein will be required to register as a "sexual offender," not a 
"sexual predator." Those are very different categories under Florida law. Mr. Epstein has 
agreed to enter a plea of guilty to two counts of violation of Florida Statutes §§ 796.03 and 
796.07. Under Florida law, those charges do not classify him as a sexual predator. See Florida 
Statute § 775.21(4Xa). Rather, he is only a sexual offender as defined by Florida Statute 
§ 943.0435(lXa). To identify Mr. Epstein as a sexual predator, in this letter or elsewhere, is 
inaccurate and would irreparably harm him. 
Third, we find no basis in law that provides the identified individuals with either a right 
to appear at Mr. Epstein's plea and sentence, or to submit a written statement to be filed by the 
State Attorney. According to Florida Statutes §§ 960.001(k) and 921.143(1), the sentencing 
court permits only "the victim of the crime for which the defendant is being sentenced . . . to 
[a]ppear before the sentencing court for the purpose of making a statement under oath for the 
record; and [s]ubmit a written statement under oath to the office of the state attorney, which 
statement shall be filed with the sentencing court" Florida Statute § 960.001(k) citing 
§ 921.143(1) (emphasis added). Here, Mr. Epstein is pleading guilty to, and being sentenced for, 
state offenses, not the federal offenses under which the government has recognized these 
identified individuals as "victims." The state charges for which Mr. Epstein will be sentenced 
are not coextensive with the federal investigation. Under Florida law, only those persons 
identified as victims of the state offenses may make a statement at the hearing or submit a 
written statement.
