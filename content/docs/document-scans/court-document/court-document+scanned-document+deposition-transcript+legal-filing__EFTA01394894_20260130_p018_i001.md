made by the Manager in its reasonable discretion, taking into account such facts and circumstances as the 
Manager deems relevant for such allocation. 
5.2 
Regulatory Allocation Provisions. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article 
V: 
5.2.1 
If there is a net decrease in "partnership minimum gain" or "partner no: recourse 
debt minimum gain" (determined in accordance with the principles of Treasury Regulations 
Sections 1.704-2(d) and 1.704-2(i)) during any Fiscal Year, each Member shall be specially 
allocated items of Fund income and gain for such Fiscal Year (and, if necessary, subsequent 
years) in an amount equal to its respective share of such net decrease during such year, 
determined pursuant to Treasury Regulations Sections 1.704- 2(g) and 1.704-2(i)(5). The items 
to be so allocated shall be determined in accordance with Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-
2(0. This Section 5.2.1 is intended to comply with the minimum gain chargeback requirement in 
such Treasury Regulations Section and shall be interpreted consistently therewith, including that 
no chargeback shall be required to the extent of the exceptions provided in Treasury Regulations 
Sections 1.704-2(0 and 1.704-2(i)(4). 
5.2.2 
If any Member has an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit at the end of any Fiscal 
Year, items of Fund income and gain shall be specially allocated to such Member in an amount 
and manner sufficient to eliminate, to the extent required by the Treasury Regulations, the 
Adjusted Capital Account deficit of such Member as promptly as possible; provided that an 
allocation pursuant to this Section 5.2.2 shall be made only if and to the extent that a Member 
would have an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit in excess of such sum after all other allocations 
provided for in this Article V have been tentatively made as if this Section 5.2.2 were not in this 
Agreement. This Section 5.2.2 is intended to comply with the "qualified income offset" 
requirement of Section 704(b) of the Code. 
5.2.3 
Nonrecourse deductions for any Fiscal Year shall be allocated to the applicable 
Member by the Manager in its reasonable discretion. 
5.2.4 
Any partner nonrecourse deductions for any Fiscal Year shall be specially 
allocated to the Member who bears the economic risk of loss with respect to the partner 
nonrecourse debt to which such partner nonrecourse deductions are attributable in accordance 
with Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(i)(1). 
5.2.5 
Any special allocations pursuant to this Section 5.2 shall be taken into account in 
computing subsequent allocations pursuant to Section 5.1 and this Section 5.2 so that the net 
amount of any items so allocated and all other items allocated to each Member shall, to the extent 
possible, be equal to the net amount that would have been allocated to each Member if such 
allocations had not occurred. 
5.2.6 
Except to the extent otherwise required by the Code and Treasury Regulations, if 
an Interest in the Fund or part thereof is transferred in any Fiscal Year, the items of income, gain, 
loss, deduction and credit allocable to such Interest for such Fiscal Year shall be allocated to the 
Person who held such Interest on the date such items were realized or incurred by the Fund, using 
any method selected by the Manager. The Manager may, in its reasonable discretion, make the 
election provided for in Section 754 of the Code upon the request of the transferor, provided that 
such transferor timely furnishes the Manager with all required information necessary to make 
and/or properly reflect said election.
