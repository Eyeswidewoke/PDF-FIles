1. the terms - value, money ,and currency- ne=d definition. separate and apart from an intrinsic worth to an 
individual=C2 , the hungry one . or the Indian tooth manufacturer, =AO either can actually be consumed or merely 
stand as a store of value or medium of exchange. a piece of paper represe=ting either is the familiar form of money, . 
a dollar bill.. =s you know the US version used to say the convertible into som=thing. ( gold silver ) . now it says trust 
me. its worth one d=llar. . the trading of dollars is well known. 
=AO I wondered whether sentences ( concepts 
without being neces=arily written on paper. could be , looked at the same way. =AO some having intrinsic value and 
others being used as exchange. =AO I see no reason why not, does that set up an economics of sentences /concepts. . 
=C2 
2 Of course I would love to talk to your=friend 
3. With nothing more meaningful than sharing a=new tasty food with you that I have enjoyed.' think you might 
enjoy the to=te of a new math. 
I read your attached paper. I would suggest that the system of =nalysis suffers from the use of early twentieth 
century reason=ng , ie references to Merge. minimal computation ( the set notation =an be misleading ) or modules. I 
think a system and notation that might , just might, help and add interesting insights is -categ=ry theory. fresher, more 
useful then either the former p=pular set theory or group theory of the 20th century . =here for example mc would 
be contained in a larger category. (=your Merge would fall into a subcategory of operations that were a combination =f 
associative , transitive operations in a space etc . One th=n looks at the spaces of probabilities and realizes that some 
are ju=t much more probable than others . nothing more. these probabilities generate shapes only as a result of 
their=C2 statistical ensembles. - the age old study of soap bubbl=s suffered from the same handicap.. the shapes 
were analyzed =y attempting to follow the mc rule. ie containing the mo=t volume for the least area. ( a broader 
category ) now i would propos= that the shape merely represents its most probable shape- not=ing more. given the 
statistical space. for ex, things on=the membrane , free to move but the shape not changing. 
I un=erstand that 
language is not an input output system like vision. Shape= are not input /output devices but have very strong 
properties , rel=tionships etc. there are mappings onto those spaces. =AO the old version of functions expanded ei 
using more than only mat=ematical terms. mappings are not required to be linear. ie grammatical sentences would 
be represented as coherent shapes. =ts very beautiful math. 
Had dinner with woody and he wanted to know if valer=a had gotten the book he suggested as in hindsight 
thought that he s=ould have sent her a copy and not merely forwarded the title. =y side still hurts from laughing for the 
past 2 hours.

If I understand what you're s=ying, I agree. If I want to buy something, the gold is more valuable (thanks

Subject: 
there is gold in the refrigerator. there=is food in the refriegerator.. , 1. =oes either the physical 
gold or food have more intrinsic value.? =AO. depends . is the value the same to both owner and , consumer.? depends,
