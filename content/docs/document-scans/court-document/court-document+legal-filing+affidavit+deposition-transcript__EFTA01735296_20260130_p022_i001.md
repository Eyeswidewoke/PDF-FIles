Mr Hurtig tells me that in Sweden the prosecution does not have to prove consent for these offences to be made 
out. Mr Rudling explained to me the difficulties of expressing the notion of consent in Swedish. However, this 
is not the issue for mc. As was said by Auld U in Nona: "It is immaterial whether dishonesty was a necessary 
constituent of the offence in the United States constituted by the conduct there, if the conduct alleged included 
acts or omissions capable of amounting to dishonesty here". In cases where a dual criminality must be shown, 
there is no requirement to identify or specify in terms the relevant mens rea. It is sufficient if it can be inferred 
by the court from the conduct that is spelt out in the warrant, and further information where appropriate. 
For each of the three offences to be made out in this jurisdiction the Crown must prove that the complainant did 
not consent to the touching and the defendant did not reasonably believe that the complainant consented. 
These essential elements of the offence arc not stated explicitly in terms in the warrant 
Section 75 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 lists the circumstances in which the complainant is taken not to have 
consented to the relevant act unless sufficient evidence is adduced to raise an issue as to whether the 
complainant consented. Also the accused is taken not to have reasonably believed that the complainant 
consented unless sufficient evidence is adduced to raise an issue as to whether he reasonably believed it. Where 
a section 75 evidential presumption arises there is no question of the issue being removed from the jury. The 
circumstances in which evidential presumptions about concerned apply include: 
2(a) any person was, at the time of the relevant act or immediately before it began, using violence 
against the complainant or causing the complainant to fear that immediate violence would be 
used against him; 
(d) the complainant was asleep or otherwise unconscious at the time of the relevant act. 
(There are other circumstances that arc not relevant in this case.) 
Offence 1, set out in full above, specifically alleges that Mr Assange "by using violence, forced the injured party 
to endure his restricting her freedom of movement. The violence consisted in a firm hold of the injured party's 
arms and a forceful spreading of her legs whilst lying on top of her and with his body weight prevented her 
from moving or shifting". This brings into play section 75(2)(a) above. These are circumstances in which the 
complainant is taken not to have consented and the accused is taken not to have reasonably believed that the 
complainant consented. This is an extradition offence pursuant to section 64(3) in that: 
(a) 
the conduct occurred in Sweden 
(b) if the conduct had occurred in England and Wales it would amount to sexual assault 
(c) The maximum penalty that may be imposed in Sweden for the offence is 2 years 
imprisonment 
Offence 4 set out in full above, says that M a "deliberately molested the injured party by acting in a manner 
designed to violate her sexual integrity. Mr Assange, who was aware that it was the expressed wish of the injured 
party and a pre-requisite of sexual intercourse that a condom be used, consummated unprotected sexual
