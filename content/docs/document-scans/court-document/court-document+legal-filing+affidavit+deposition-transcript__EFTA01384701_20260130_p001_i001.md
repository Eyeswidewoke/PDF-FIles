HUBUS133 Alpha Group Capital 
completed form with the Service's Office of Tax Shelter Analysis. The Partnership intends to 
notify the Partners that it believes (based on information available to the Partnership) are required 
to report a transaction of the Partnership, and intends to provide such Limited Partners with any 
available information needed to complete and submit Form 8886 with respect to the Partnership's 
transactions. In certain situations, there may also be a requirement that a list be maintained of 
persons participating in such reportable transactions, which could be made available to the Service 
at its request. 
A Partner's recognition of a loss upon its disposition of an interest in the Partnership could 
also constitute a "reportable transaction" for such Partner requiring such Partner to file Form 8886. 
A significant penalty is imposed on taxpayers who participate in a "reportable transaction" 
and fail to make the required disclosure. The maximum penalty is $10,000 for natural persons and 
$50,000 for other persons (increased to $100,000 and $200,000, respectively, if the reportable 
transaction is a "listed" transaction). Investors should consult with their own advisers concerning 
the application of these reporting obligations to their specific situations. 
State and Local Taxation 
In addition to the Federal income tax consequences described above, prospective investors 
should consider potential state and local tax consequences of an investment in the Partnership. 
State and local laws often differ from Federal income tax laws with respect to the treatment of 
specific items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit. A Partner's distributive share of the 
taxable income or loss of the Partnership generally will be required to be included in determining 
its reportable income for state and local tax purposes in the jurisdiction in which it is a resident. 
To the extent the Partnership is engaged in a trade or business, including through the acquisition 
of an interest in a partnership (such as an MLP) that is itself engaged in a trade or business, a 
Partner's share of the Partnership's income from that trade or business that is sourced to a particular 
jurisdiction may cause such Partner to be taxed in that jurisdiction and may cause such Partner to 
file tax returns in such jurisdiction. Prospective investors should consult their tax advisers with 
respect to the availability of a credit for any such tax in the jurisdiction in which that Partner is a 
resident. 
The tax laws of various states and localities limit or eliminate the deductibility of itemized 
deductions for certain taxpayers. As described above, the Master Fund generally expects to be in 
a trade or business within the meaning of the Code. Accordingly, it is not anticipated that the 
Partnership's and the Master Fund's expenses associated with such trade or business will be 
subject to such limitations. However, certain expenses which are not associated with such trade 
or business may be limited in their deductibility in one or more states or localities. Moreover, 
there can be no assurance that various states and localities will not treat all of the Partnership's and 
the Master Fund's expenses, including interest expense, as investment expenses which are subject 
to such limitations. Prospective investors are urged to consult their tax advisers with respect to 
the impact of these provisions on the deductibility of certain itemized deductions, including 
interest expense, on their tax liabilities in the jurisdictions in which they are resident. 
One or more states may impose reporting requirements on the Partnership and/or its 
Partners in a manner similar to that described above in "Tax Shelter Reporting Requirements."
