7.7 
The date of a Subsequent Closing will be communicated to the relevant Investors and the Custodian 
upon {twenty (20)} Business Days' prior notice (or such other shorter period as decided by the General 
Partner). 
7.8 
The General Partner may decide, at its discretion, to postpone the date of the Second Closing (but not 
beyond the end of the Commitment Period). In this event, the relevant Investors and the Custodian will 
be infonned of the amended date of the Second Closing. 
7.9 
Investors who subscribe for Commitments on the Subsequent Closing Date will be treated as if they 
had been admitted to the Compartment as of the First Closing Date and will acquire a proportionate 
interest in all Investments acquired by the Company, and will bear the proportionate share of the fees 
and expenses incurred by the Company, prior to the date of their admission to the Company pro rata 
with other Investors. 
7.10 
In addition, if an Investor is admitted to the Company on the Subsequent Closing or has increased its 
Commitment on the Subsequent Closing (the Subsequent Investor), and if Capital Contributions 
have been made by existing Investors (the Previous Investors) on or after the First Closing Date (the 
Relevant Drawdown), then such Subsequent Investor will be required to pay an amount equal to: 
(a) 
the amount notified to such Subsequent Investor by the General Partner by mail or through 
appropriate electronic communication means as being necessary to equalise (in percentage 
terms) the net amount drawn down from all Investors after taking into account any amounts 
distributed to Previous Investors. The Subsequent Investor's Undrawn Commitment shall be 
reduced by the sum paid under this Section 7.10(a) in respect of its Capital Contribution. All 
such amounts shall thereafter be deemed to have been contributed on the First Closing Date, 
unless otherwise stated (the Subsequent Closing Capital Contribution): 
plus 
(b) 
an additional amount calculated on the Subsequent Closing Capital Contribution during the 
period commencing on the date of the first Relevant Drawdown and ending on the first 
drawdown of Commitment from such Subsequent Investor equal to interest at the [in(ernt 
rate increased b) percentage) compounded annually on the average daily balance of such 
Capital Contribution, which sum shall accrue from the date or dates upon which such Capital 
Contribution would have been payable had it been an Investor on the First Closing Date up to 
the date of its admission to the Company or increase in Commitment (the Subsequent 
Closing Actualisation Interest). 
7.11 
The Subsequent Closing Actualisation Interest paid by a Subsequent Investor pursuant to Section 
7.10(b) shall not be treated as part of its Commitment and shall not be deemed Capital Contributions. 
The Subsequent Closing Actualisation Interest shall be payable on top of an Investor's Commitment. 
The Subsequent Closing Actualisation Interest will be distributed pro•rata to Previous Investors but 
will not be added to the Undrawn Commitment of Previous Investors and hence not be available for 
drawdown again. For the avoidance of doubt, the new investors will be entered in the register of 
shareholders of the Company as at the date at which they obtain their first Shares therein. 
7.12 
The amounts payable by a Subsequent Investor as per Section 7.10(a) and (b) of this Special Section 
will be: 
(a) 
returned to the Previous Investors pro rata to their Capital Contributions as soon as is 
practicable after receipt from such Subsequent Investors so that immediately thereafter the 
amounts of all Investors' Undrawn Commitments will bear the same proportion to their
