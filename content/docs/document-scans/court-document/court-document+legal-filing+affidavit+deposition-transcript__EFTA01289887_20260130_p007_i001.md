These figures are computed using information from providers believed to be reliable; however, no assurance can be made as to the accuracy. Since interest and dividend rates are subject to change at any time, 
and may be affected by current and future economic, political, and business condtions, they should not be relied on for making investment, trading, or tax decisions. These figures assume that the position
