coverage hereunder, Customer agrees to pay to Sikorsky an entry payment for each such 
Component equal to the applicable Flight Hour Fee set forth in Article I multiplied by the 
number of Flight Hours accrued on such Component since the Component was new or 
overhauled (as the case may be) at the time of entry into coverage hereunder. 
2. Flight Hour Fee; Minimum Utilization Flight Hours — Customer shall pay monthly for each 
Component an amount equal to the applicable Flight Hour Fee set forth in Article I multiplied 
by the actual Flight Hours of operation for the applicable Helicopter, as set forth in the Flight 
Time Report. Customer shall calculate the total Flight Hour Fee for each month (even when 
zero (0) hours are flown) via the Flight Time Report no later than fifteen (15) days following 
the end of the month. Sikorsky shall generate an invoice for the total monthly Flight Hour Fee. 
Customer may also use the Flight Time Report as a self-generated invoice document. 
After the end of each calendar year and upon termination, expiration or transfer of this 
Agreement, Sikorsky shall invoice Customer for each Component an amount equal to (i) the 
difference, if any, between the Minimum Utilization Flight Hours set forth in Article I and the 
actual Flight Hours flown, multiplied by (ii) the applicable Flight Hour Fee set forth in Article 
1. For calendar year 2020, Right Hours reported and paid under the Powertrain Assurance 
Program Agreement that expired by its terms on September 30, 2020 will count toward the 
2020 Minimum Utilization Flight Hours under this Agreement. 
3. Unused Hour Charge - Except in the case of an unscheduled exchange requirement removed 
pursuant to Article III.6 above, if Customer removes a Component prior to the approved TBO 
for such Component with at least one hundred (100) Flight Hours remaining (the difference 
between the TBO and the hours at removal referred to as the "Unused Hours"), Customer shall 
pay to Sikorsky an amount equal to: (A) the applicable Flight Hour Fee set forth in Article I, 
multiplied by (B) the difference between the number of Unused Hours less one hundred (100). 
4. Upgradeable Component Charge — Upon election of a Component upgrade in the future, 
Sikorsky shall invoice and Customer shall pay the mutually agreed price for such upgrade. 
5. Overhaul Charge - For any Components not covered by a preceding PAP agreement, 
Sikorsky may, in its sole discretion, charge Customer additional amounts related to repair work 
required to place the Component into overhauled condition in accordance with the applicable 
overhaul and repair manual and Sikorsky's quality standards. 
6. Other Charges - Customer shall pay all shipping costs related to shipment of Replacement 
Components to Customer. In the event that a Non-Operational Component has, in Sikorsky's 
sole discretion, been subject to use or conditions constituting more than ordinary wear or tear 
(including, but not limited to, accident, lightning, sudden stoppage, corrosion, hard landing, 
deficient or improper maintenance not in accordance with operator and maintenance manuals, 
or overtorque), Customer shall be liable to Sikorsky for any and all evaluation, replacement or 
repair costs relating to the defective Component. 
An additional charge may apply for a S-76BTM model Helicopter. Sikorsky will supply a -044 
configuration gear box or newer under this Agreement. In addition to the Flight Hour Fee, an
