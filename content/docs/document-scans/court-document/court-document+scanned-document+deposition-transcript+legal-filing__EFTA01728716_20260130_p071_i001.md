In the absence of some compelling special circumstance or requirement, the interview of a 
child possibly seduced by an acquaintance molester should never be conducted in the presence of 
parents. The presence of the parent increases the likelihood that the child will just deny or give the 
socially or parentally acceptable version of the victimization. This is especially true of younger 
victims. 
Some victims in acquaintance-child-exploitation cases disclose incomplete and minimized 
information about the sexual activity that is contradicted by further investigation. This creates 
significant problems for the investigation and prosecution of such cases. For instance, when the 
investigator finally gets a victim to disclose the exploitation and abuse, the victim furnishes a version 
of his victimization that he or she swears is true. Subsequent investigation then uncovers additional 
victims, child pornography, or computer chat logs and other-records--directly conflicting with the 
first victim's story. A common example of this is that the victim admits the offender sucked his 
penis, but denies that he sucked the offender's penis. The execution of a search warrant then leads 
to the seizure of photographs of the victim sucking the offender's penis. Additional victims may also 
confirm this, but then lie when they vehemently deny that they did the same thing. 
The allegations of multiple victims often conflict with each other. Each victim tends to 
minimize their behavior and maximize the behavior of other victims or the offender. Some victims 
continue to deny the activity even when confronted with the pictures. Today, investigators must be 
especially careful in computer cases where easily recovered chat logs, records of communication, 
and visual images may directly contradict the socially acceptable version of events that the victim 
is now giving. In my experience, the primary reason compliant child victims furnish these false and 
misleading details about their victimization is their correct recognition that society does not 
understand or accept the reality of their victimization. This happens so often that distorted and 
varying details in such cases are almost corroboration for the validity of the victimization. 
Can We Come To Conclusions? 
The typical adolescent, especially a boy, is easily sexually aroused, sexually curious, 
sexually inexperienced, and somewhat rebellious. All these traits combine to make the adolescent 
one of the easiest victims of sexual seduction. It takes almost nothing to get an adolescent boy 
sexually aroused. An adolescent boy with emotional and sexual needs is simply no match for an 
experienced 50-year-old man with an organized plan. Yet, ndult offenders who seduce them, and 
the society that judges them, continue to claim that these victims "consented." The result is a victim 
who feels responsible for what happened and embarrassed about his actions. Once a victim is 
seduced, each successive sexual incident becomes easier and quicker. Eventually the child victim 
may even take the initiative in the seduction. 
Some victims come to realize that the offender has a greater need for this sex than they do, 
and this gives them great leverage against the offender. The victims can use sex to manipulate the 
offender or temporarily withhold sex until they get things they want. A few victims even blackmail 
the offender especially if he is married or a pillar of the community. Although all of this is
