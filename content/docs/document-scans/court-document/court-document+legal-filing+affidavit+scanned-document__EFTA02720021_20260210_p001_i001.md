MARITIME SAFETY AND SECURITY BULLETIN 03-15

UNINSPECTED PASSENGER VESSEL OPERATIONS FOR VESSELS IN THE U. S. 
VIRGIN ISLANDS 
Section 319 of the recently enacted "Howard Coble Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of 
2014" (Pub. L. No. 113-281 (S.2444); hereinafter "the Act") amended the law concerning Uninspected 
Passenger Vessel operations for vessels in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Under this amendment, vessels less 
than 24 meters (79 feet) in overall length may now have the option of carrying a maximum of twelve 
passengers, if the Coast Guard determines that the vessel complies with the requirements established by 
the United Kingdom (U.K.) Code of Practice for the Safety of Small Commercial Motor or Sailing 
Vessels (hereafter "Code(s)"), which is commonly known as the Yellow Code (for motor vessels) or the 
Blue Code (for sailing vessels). 
While the Coast Guard is actively evaluating the Act to determine how best to fully implement it, the 
Coast Guard has determined that the Section 319 amendments to Uninspected Passenger Vessel laws arc 
substantially self-implementing. Therefore, some U.S. Uninspected Passenger Vessels whose voyages 
originate from the U.S. Virgin Islands, upon meeting certain conditions, may now carry from 7 to 12 
passengers within the U.S. Virgin Islands and on international voyages, but not to another U.S. port 
outside the U.S. Virgin Islands. As an owner or operator of a U.S. Uninspected Passenger Vessel 
operating from a port in the U.S. Virgin Islands, if you wish to carry between seven and twelve 
passengers, the following steps will be required pending the Coast Guard's further evaluation: 
1) Your vessel must be in compliance with one of the Codes listed above; 
2) To verify that compliance, your vessel must be examined by a Certifying Authority listed within 
one of the Codes (Blue or Yellow as appropriate); and 
3) The operator must maintain a Small Commercial Vessel Certificate issued by a certifying 
authority under the Code and keep it rat board. 
Equipment requirements and frequency of examinations associated with these Codes differ from existing 
U.S. requirements for an Uninspected Passenger Vessel. The Coast Guard recommends that any owner or 
operator seeking to utilize either of these Codes become familiar with the requirements and frequency of 
inspections for the Code applicable to their vessel(s). 
Vessel operators engaged on international voyages are reminded that they are required to hold a Merchant 
Mariner Credential with an officer endorsement as Master as required by Title 46 Code of Federal 
Regulations 15.805(aX7). An endorsement as an Operator of Uninspected Passenger Vessels (OUPV) is 
not suitable for international voyages. Mariners with an endorsement as an OUPV may carry between 
seven and twelve passengers when operating an eligible Uninspected Passenger Vessel within the waters 
of the U.S. Virgin Islands, if the vessel is not on an international voyage. 
It is the responsibility of the vessel owner or operator to ensure their vessel is maintained and operated in 
compliance with all applicable U.S. laws. When carrying between seven and twelve passengers as an 
Uninspected Passenger Vessel in the U.S. Virgin Islands, vessel owners and operators must also ensure 
their vessel is in compliance with the appropriate Code (Blue or Yellow) and carry documentation 
attesting to an examination of compliance.
