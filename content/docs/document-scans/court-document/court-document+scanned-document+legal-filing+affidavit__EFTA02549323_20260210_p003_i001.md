Trump-Russia collusion, a group of government officials sought to bolster Mrs. Clinton=E2ns electoral chances and, if 
the unthinkable happened, obtain an in=urance policy to cripple the Trump administration with accusations of 
ille=itimacy. 
What does this have to do with Mr. Mueller, who was appointed in=May 2017 after President 
Trump fired Mr. Comey? The inspector general conc=udes that the pervasive bias "cast a cloud over the FBI 
investigations to which these employees were assigned,Q=9D including Crossfire. And if Crossfire was politically 
motivated, then i=s culmination, the appointment of a special counsel, inherited the taint. =11 special-counsel activities—
investigations, plea deals, subpoenas, reports, indictments and convictions—are fr=it of a poisonous tree, byproducts of 
a violation of due process. That Mr.=Mueller and his staff had nothing to do with Crossfire's origin of=ers no cure. 
When the government deprives a person of life, liberty or proper=y, it is required to use 
fundamentally fair processes. The Supreme Court h=s made clear that when governmental action "shocks the 
conscience," it violates due process. Such con=uct includes investigative or prosecutorial efforts that appear, under 
the=totality of the circumstances, to be motivated by corruption, bias or entr=pment. 
In U.S. v. Russell4=A0(1973), the justices observed: "We may someday be presented with a 
situation in which the conduct of law enforcement agents is so outrageou= that due process principles would absolutely 
bar the government from invo=ing judicial processes to obtain a conviction." It didn't =ake long. In Blackledge v. Perry 
(1974), the court concluded that due process was=offended by a prosecutor's "realistic likelihood of 
4>=98vindictiveness' " that tainted the "very in=tiation of proceedings." 
In Young v. U.S. ex rel. Vuitton=C2*(1987), the justices held that because prosecutors have 
"power to employ the full machinery of the state in scrutiniz=ng any given individual ... we must have assurance that 
those who would =ield this power will be guided solely by their sense of public responsibil=ty for the attainment of 
justice." Prosecutors must be "disinterested" and make "dispassionate as=essments," free from any personal bias. 
In Williams v. Pennsylvania=/em> (2016), the court held that a state judge's potential bi=s 
violated due process because he had played a role, a quarter-century earli=r, in prosecuting the death-row inmate 
whose habeas corpus petition he was=hearing. The passage of time and involvement of others do not vitiate the =aint 
but heighten "the need for objective rules preventing the operation of bias that might otherwise be o=scured," the 
justices wrote. A single biased individual "m=ght still have an influence that, while not so visible ... is =evertheless 
significant." 
In addition to the numerous anti-Trump messages uncovered by the=inspector general, there is 
a strong circumstantial case—including=personnel, timing, methods and the absence of evidence—that Crossfire was 
initiated for political, not national-security, purposes.=/u> 
It was initiated in defiance of a longstanding Justice Departmen= presumption against 
investigating campaigns in an election year. And whil= impartiality is always required, a 2012 memo by then-Attorney 
General Eric Holder emphasizes that impartiality is t>=80,particularly important in an election year," and "pol=tics 
must play no role in the decisions of federal prosecutors or investig=tors regarding any investigations.... Law 
enforcement officers and prosecutors may never select the timing of investigative step= or criminal charges for the 
purpose of affecting any election, or for the=purpose of giving an advantage or disadvantage to any candidate or 
politic=l party." 
Strong evidence of a crime can overcome this policy, as was the =ase with the bureau's 
investigation of Mrs. Clinton's priv=te email server, which began more than a year before the 2016 election. But 
Crossfire was not a criminal investigation. It was a counter=ntelligence investigation predicated on the notion that 
Russia could be co=luding with the Trump campaign. There appears to have been no discernible =vidence of Trump-
Russia collusion at the time Crossfire was launched, further reinforcing the notion that it=was initiated "for the purpose" 
of affecting the president=al election.
