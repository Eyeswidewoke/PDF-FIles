• 
a trust agreement executed by us. as sponsor of the trust, and the trustees for the trust: and 
• 
the filing of a certificate of trust with the Delaware Secretary of State on March 22, 2001. 
The trust agreement will be amended and restated in its entirety substantially in the form filed as an exhibit 
to the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part. The restated trust agreement will be qualified 
as an indenture under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939. The trust exists for the exclusive purposes of: 
• 
issuing and selling the preferred securities and common securities that represent undivided beneficial 
interests in the assets of the trust; 
• 
using the gross proceeds from the sale of the preferred securities and common securities to acquire a 
particular series of our subordinated debt securities: and 
• 
engaging in only those other activities necessary or incidental to the issuance and sale of the preferred 
securities and common securities and purchase of our subordinated debt securities. 
We will indirectly or directly own all of the common securities of the trust. The common securities of the 
trust will rank equally, and payments will be made thereon pro rata, with the preferred securities of that trust, 
except that, if an event of default under the restated trust agreement resulting from an event of default under our 
subordinated debt securities held by the trust has occurred and is continuing, the rights of the holders of the 
common securities to payment in respect of distributions and payments upon liquidation, redemption and 
otherwise will be subordinated to the rights of the holders of the preferred securities. 
Unless otherwise disclosed in the related prospectus supplement, the trust has a term of approximately 55 
years. but may dissolve earlier as provided in the restated trust agreement of the trust. Unless otherwise disclosed 
in the applicable prospectus supplement, the trust's business and affairs will be conducted by the trustees 
appointed by us, as the direct or indirect holder of all of the common securities. The holder of the common 
securities will be entitled to appoint, remove or replace any of. or increase or reduce the number of. the trustees 
of the trust. The duties and obligations of the trustees of the trust will be governed by the restated trust agreement 
of the trust. 
Unless otherwise disclosed in the related prospectus supplement. two of the trustees of the trust will be 
administrative trustees. The administrative trustees will be persons who are employees or officers of or affiliated 
with us. One trustee of the trust will be the property trustee. The property trustee will be a financial institution 
that is not affiliated with us. that has a minimum amount of combined capital and surplus of not less than 
$50,000.000 and that will act as property trustee under the terms set forth in the applicable prospectus 
supplement. The property trustee will also act as indenture trustee for the purposes of compliance with the 
provisions of the Trust Indenture Act. In addition, one trustee of the trust, which trustee will reside in or have its 
principal place of business in the State of Delaware. will be the "Delaware trustee." The Delaware trustee may be
