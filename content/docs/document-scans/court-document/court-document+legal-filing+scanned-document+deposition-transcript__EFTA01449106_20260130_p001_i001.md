(not out of fund assets). DBSI also participates in a program offered by Pershing, under which DBSI shares in 
revenue received by Pershing from mutual funds offered on the Pershing platform. All of these payments may vary 
based on sales volume or assets under management and may give DBSI a financial incentive to recommend certain 
funds or strategies and to include those funds in models and programs. In addition, DBSI may receive trail
