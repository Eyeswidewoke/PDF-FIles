play no role in the decisions of federal prosecutors or investigators-regarding any investigations.... Law enforcement 
officers and prosecutors may never select the timing of investigative steps=or criminal charges for the purpose of 
affecting any election, or for the p=rpose of giving an advantage or disadvantage to any candidate or political p=rty." 
Strong evidence of a crime can overcome this policy, as was the ca=e with the bureau's 
investigation of Mrs. Clinton's private=email server, which began more than a year before the 2016 election. But 
Crossfire was not a criminal investigation. It was a counteri=telligence investigation predicated on the notion that Russia 
could be coll=ding with the Trump campaign. There appears to have been no discernible evi=ence of Trump-Russia 
collusion at the time Crossfire was launched, further reinforcing the notion that it w=s initiated "for the purpose" of 
affecting the presidential=election. 
The chief evidence of collusion is the hacking of the Democratic N=tional Committee's servers. 
But nothing in the public record sugges=s the Trump campaign aided that effort. The collusion narrative therefore hinges 
on the more generic assertion that Russia aimed t= help Mr. Trump's election, and that the Trump campaign 
reciprocate= by embracing pro-Russian policies. Yet despite massive surveillance and in=estigation, there's still no public 
evidence of any such exchange—only that Russia attempted to sow pol=tical discord by undermining Mrs. Clinton and to 
a lesser extent Mr. Trump.=u> 
Some members of the Trump team interacted with Russians and advoca=ed dovish policies. But 
so did numerous American political and academic eli=es, including many Clinton advisers. Presidential campaigns 
routinely seek opposition research and interact with foreign powe=s. The Clinton campaign funded the Steele dossier, 
whose British author pai= Russians to dish anti-Trump dirt. The Podesta Group, led by the brother of=Mrs. Clinton's 
campaign chairman, received millions lobbying for Russia's largest bank and the Europe=n Center for a Modern Ukraine, 
both with deep Kremlin ties. The Clinton Fou=dation and Bill Clinton took millions from Kremlin-connected 
businesses.=/u> 
No evidence has emerged of Trump-Russia collusion, and Mr. Mueller=has yet to bring collusion-
related charges against anyone. Evidence suggest= one of his targets, George Papadopoulos, was lured to London, plied 
with the prospect of Russian information damagin= to Mrs. Clinton, and taken to dinner, where he drunkenly bragged 
that heQ=80,d heard about such dirt but never seen it. These circumstances not onl= fail to suggest Mr. Papadopoulos 
committed a crime, they reek of entrapment. The source of this information, former Au=tralian diplomat Alexander 
Downer, admits Mr. Papadopolous never mentioned e=ails, destroying any reasonable inference of a connection 
between the DNC h=ck and the Trump campaign. 
Crossfire's progenitors thus ignored an obvious question: 1= Russia promised unspecified dirt on 
Mrs. Clinton but never delivered it, h=w would that amount to collusion with the Trump campaign? If anything, such 
behavior suggests an attempt to entice and pote=tially embarrass Mr. Trump by dangling the prospect of compromising 
informa=ion and getting his aides to jump at it. 
Given the paucity of evidence, it's staggering that the FB= would initiate a counterintelligence 
investigation, led by politically bia=ed staff, amid a presidential campaign. The aggressive methods and subsequent 
leaking only strengthen that conclusion. If the FBI s=ncerely believed Trump associates were Russian targets or agents, 
the prope= response would have been to inform Mr. Trump so that he could protect his c=mpaign and the country. 
Mr. Trump's critics argue that the claim of political bias=is belied by the fact that Crossfire was 
not leaked before the election. In=fact, there were vigorous, successful pre-election efforts to publicize the Trump-
Russia collusion narrative. Shortly after Cr=ssfire's launch, CIA Director John Brennan and Mr. Comey briefed Co=gress, 
triggering predictable leaking. Christopher Steele and his patrons e=barked on a media roadshow, making their dossier 
something of an open secret in Washington.
