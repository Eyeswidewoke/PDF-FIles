and encouraged hund=eds of U.S. accountholders to come into compliance. BSI is also assi=ting with ongoing treaty 
requests. 
"This action under the Swiss Bank P=ogram shows just how far we've come in our efforts to stop offshor= tax 
avoidance," said Deputy Commissioner Douglas O'Donnell=of IRS's Large Business and International Division (LB & 
l).=C24> "The IRS and DOJ remain committed to aggressively enforce ou= nation's tax laws regardless of how 
sophisticated or complicated the =chemes may be." 
While BSI's U.S. accountholders who=have not yet declared their accounts to the IRS may still be eligible to 
participate in the IRS's offshore voluntary disclosure programs= the price of such disclosure has increased. 
Most U.S. taxpayers who enter the IRS offsh=re voluntary disclosure program to resolve undeclared offshore 
accounts will pay a penalty equal to 27.5 percent of the high value of the=accounts. On Aug. 4, 2014, the IRS increased 
the penalty to 50 perce=t if, at the time the taxpayer initiated their disclosure, either a foreig= financial institution at 
which the taxpayer had an account or a facilitator who helped the taxpayer establish=or maintain an offshore 
arrangement had been publicly identified as being =nder investigation, the recipient of a John Doe summons or 
cooperating wit= a government investigation, including the execution of a deferred prosecution agreement or non-
prosecution agree=ent. With today's announcement of BSI's non-prosecut=on agreement, its noncompliant U.S. 
accountholders must now pay that 50 pe=cent penalty to the IRS if they wish to enter the IRS' program. 
BSI and other banks in the Swiss Bank Progr=m are also providing detailed information to the department about 
transfers of money from Switzerland to other countries. The Ta= Division and the IRS intend to follow that money to 
uncover additional ta= evasion schemes. 
The department has emphasized the importanc= of identifying U.S. accountholders who have undeclared 
foreign bank accounts, and BSI has provided assistance in that task. Because=of the information provided to the 
department under the program, the Tax D=vision has already begun the process of identifying noncompliant U.S. 
acco=ntholders who have maintained accounts at many Swiss banks participating in the Swiss Bank Program. <=> 
"Today's action sends a cle=r message to anyone thinking about keeping money offshore in order to evad= tax 
laws," said Chief Richard Weber of IRS-Criminal Investigation =CI). "Fighting offshore tax evasion continues to be a top 
pr=ority for IRS-CI and we will trace unreported funds anywhere in the world.=C24, IRS-CI special agents are our nation's 
best financial investigators, trained to follow the money and enforce our country..99s tax laws to ensure fairness for 
all." 
Acting Assistant Attorney General Ciraolo t=anked the IRS and in particular, IRS-CI and LB & I for their substantial 
assistance, as well as Trial Attorney Kevin F. Sweeney of the =ax Division, who served as lead counsel on this matter, and 
Senior Counsel=for International Tax Matters and Coordinator of the Swiss Bank Program Th=mas J. Sawyer of the Tax 
Division.
