General Partner in trust for the Limited Partner, for an indefinite period of time. In addition, in-
kind distributions may be made when the General Partner deems it advisable for tax purposes. 
Incentive Allocation. The allocation of a percentage of net capital appreciation for a 
particular calendar year to the General Partner, an affiliate of the Investment Manager, may 
create an incentive for the Investment Manager to cause the Partnership to make investments that 
are riskier or more speculative than would be the case if this allocation were not made. The 
Incentive Allocation was set by the General Partner without negotiations with any third party. 
Portfolio Managers generally will receive incentive compensation from the Partnership based on 
the performance of their portfolios. Therefore, it is possible that certain of the Portfolio 
Managers may receive incentive compensation even though the Partnership, as a whole, does not 
have net capital appreciation. 
Additionally, the incentive compensation to the Portfolio 
Managers may create an incentive for the Portfolio Managers to cause the Partnership to make 
investments that are riskier or more speculative than would be the case if they were paid only a 
fixed compensation. The Investment Manager has full discretion to determine the amount and 
structure of the compensation to be paid to Portfolio Managers. 
Layering of Fees. Allocations and Expenses. The Partnership's direct fees and expenses, 
coupled with the Incentive Allocation and the incentive compensation paid to the Portfolio 
Managers, results in multiple levels of fees, expenses and allocations. 
Accordingly, the 
Partnership's expenses may constitute a higher percentage of net assets than expenses associated 
with other investment entities. 
Valuation. A portion of the Partnership's investments may be in securities or instruments 
for which market quotations are not readily available. The valuation of such securities and 
instruments will be determined by the General Partner, whose determination will be final and 
conclusive as to all parties, subject to the requirement that such valuations be made in 
accordance with GAAP. The General Partner may, but is not required to, obtain independent 
market quotations for, or appraisals of, such assets at the Partnership's expense. As the Incentive 
Allocation made to the General Partner is based directly on the Partnership's net asset value, the 
General Partner will have a conflict of interest in valuing these assets. 
Foreign Investments. 
The Partnership may invest in foreign or domestic securities 
denominated in foreign currencies and/or traded outside of the U.S. Such investments require 
consideration of certain risks typically not associated with investing in U.S. securities or 
property. Such risks include, among other things, trade balances and imbalances and related 
economic policies, unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations, imposition of exchange 
control regulation by the U.S. or foreign governments, U.S. and foreign withholding taxes, 
limitations on the removal of funds or other assets, policies of governments with respect to 
possible nationalization of their industries, political difficulties, including expropriation of assets, 
confiscatory taxation and economic or political instability in foreign nations. 
There may be less publicly available information about certain foreign companies than 
would be the case for comparable companies in the U.S., and certain foreign companies may not 
be subject to accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards and requirements comparable 
to or as uniform as those of U.S. companies. Securities markets outside the U.S., while growing 
in volume, have, for the most part, substantially less volume than U.S. markets, and many
