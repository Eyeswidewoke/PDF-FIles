were,=as you point out, contemplating leverage in the <3x EBITDA range,=it is in fact a relevant data point and an 
independent look at value. 
6. 
One other note that is re=evant to us, is that when Elite Models in Europe 
contacted us with an inte=est in buying the company, Faith told me to relay to them that they would =ot contemplate 
selling to Elite for less than $100 million (which at the t=me was a +10x synergy-adjusted EBITDA value). Ultimately they 
walked=based on that value requirement. 
I would hope you agree that the following is a c=mmonly agreed upon formula 
for value: 
a. 
=C240 Enterprise value = EBITDA x Market Multiple</=> 
=span style="font-size:11ptfont-family:Calibri,sans-
seriecolor:rgb(31,7=,125)">b. =C24> Equity Value = Enterprise Value + net=cash (or — net debt). 
One matter of judgment is what of the cash balance =s "excess cash". Joel has 
said he believes all the c=sh is due to the models. The facts show that in the ordinary course =f business the collection 
of receivables offsets the payables and in the p=st three years, the cash balance has only fluctuated at most by $3 
million= meaning anywhere from $8-10 million on the balance sheet should be consid=red to be "excess cash", not 
needed for day-to-day operati=ns. I have attached both a three year cash balance tracker and a cur=ent balance sheet 
for your review. 
Using the above, a very modest calculation of =alue would be $6.7 million of 
EBITDA x 5 multiple (a 50% discount to the m=rket) or an enterprise value of $33.5 million and if we took a conservativ= 
view of what excess cash is at the moment of $8 million, would result in = total equity value of $41.5 million. Our 42% 
would equate to $17.4 =illion of proceeds to us. That is at a multiple that has been deeply=discounted to the market 
comps that were actually paid for companies in th= same business. 
We are, however, willing to take much less than this very discoun=ed value 
calculation, as I have mentioned to you before. However, yo=r proposal of $5 million of proceeds to us represents an 
equity value of $=1.9 million ($5/.42), an enterprise value of $3.9 million ($11.9 million -=$8 million of excess cash) or an 
EBITDA multiple of 0.58x ($6.7 x 0.58 ==$3.9 enterprise value), a level that is far too low for us to accept. 
I look forw=rd to our discussion tomorrow morning.

Prett= funny Neale... 
Even the silly open gate proposal was in essence stepping into you= shoes for 
only 6 million cash. BACK THEN !! 
Then proposing to distribute wh=t they estimated to be almost the full total (14 
of the 15 million) of cas= on the balance sheet. Chris i must point out that is more than it t=tals today. Then having Joel, 
Faith, etc leverage themselves up by=C24) borrowing at 7 percent against the entire co in order to make a furt=er 
distribution of an additional 15 million which on paper creates a=highly inflated enterprise value. He only proposed 6 
million cash in=usion which is around the same amount that you are currently being offered= They valued faith and 
joels ongoing equity (that they proposed the= "keep in") silly, at 8mm which is roughly the same as =e suggested. 
Financial engineering done well is like lipstick.= however not done well is also like lipstick. :) T=is is a personal service
