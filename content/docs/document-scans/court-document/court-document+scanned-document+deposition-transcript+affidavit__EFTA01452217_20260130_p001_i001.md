A "U.S. Tax Person is a beneficial owner of an littered that is a citizen or resident of the United States, a U.S. domestic 
corporation or otherwise subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis with respect to its Interest. In determining 
beneficial ownership, an Interest held by (i) a partnership or entity treated as partnership for U.S. federal income tax 
purposes or (ii) a "passive foreign investment company" within the meaning of section 1297 of the Internal Revenue Code 
of 1986, as amended, (a "PFIC") will be considered beneficially owned by its partners or equityholders, as the case may be. 
An interest held by any corporation other than a PFIC will be treated as held by a shareholder beneficially owning 50 
percent or more of the stock of such corporation, measured by value. In addition, a holder of an option to acquire an Interest 
will be treated as the beneficial owner of the underlying Interest.
