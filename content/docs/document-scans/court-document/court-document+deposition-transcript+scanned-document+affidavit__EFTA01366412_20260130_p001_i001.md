warrants if the over-allotment option is exercised in full) at a price of $0.50 per warrant (a purchase price of 
$5,800,000 or $6,407,500 if the over-allotment option is exercised), in a private placement that will occur 
simultaneously with the completion of the Proposed Offering (the "Private Placement Warrants"). Each Private 
Placement Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one-half of one share of common stock at $5.75 per share. The

Placement Warrants (including the common stock issuable upon exercise of the Private Placement Warrants) will 
not be transferable, assignable or salable until 30 days after the completion of the initial Business Combination 
and they will be non-redeemable so long as they are held by the Sponsor or its permitted transferees. If the Private 
Placement Warrants are held by someone other than the Sponsor or its permitted transferees, the Private
