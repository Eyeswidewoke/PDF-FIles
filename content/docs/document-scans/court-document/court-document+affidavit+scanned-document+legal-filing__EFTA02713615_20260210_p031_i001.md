or in desired quantities difficult or impossible. There may be no market for unlisted securities 
traded by the Partnership. In some cases, the Partnership may be contractually prohibited from 
disposing of such securities for a specified period of time. Further, the sale of any such positions 
may be possible only at substantial discounts and such positions may be extremely difficult to 
value. If a substantial number of Partners were to withdraw from the Partnership and the 
Partnership did not have a sufficient amount of liquid securities, the Partnership might have to 
meet such withdrawals through distributions of illiquid securities. The Partnership may invest a 
portion of its assets in securities that are not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as 
amended (the "Securities Act"). The Partnership will purchase such securities in reliance upon 
the exemption from registration provided by Regulation D or in similar transactions. Securities 
purchased pursuant to Regulation D are often illiquid because, unless such securities are 
subsequently registered under the Securities Act, they may not be offered or sold except pursuant 
to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the 
Securities Act and any other applicable securities law. 
Limited Liquidity: No Secondary Market. An investment in the Partnership is suitable 
only for sophisticated investors who have no need for current liquidity. An investment in the 
Partnership provides very limited liquidity since Interests are not freely transferable and Limited 
Partners are permitted to make withdrawals of capital from the Partnership only at certain 
designated times and with substantial prior notice. Withdrawals are also subject to certain 
substantial limitations, including, potentially, an Early Withdrawal Charge and the Investor Gate. 
There is no secondary market for Interests and none is likely to develop in the future. 
Withdrawal distributions may be made in kind. (See "Allocation of Gains and Losses," "Certain 
Risk Factors—In-Kind Distributions" and "Investor Suitability.") 
The Partnership will likely from time to time directly or indirectly invest a portion of its 
assets in illiquid investments. The Partnership may not be able to readily dispose of such illiquid 
investments and, in some cases, may be contractually prohibited from disposing of such 
securities for a specified period of time. The Partnership may also directly or indirectly invest in 
assets for which no organized trading market exists and which may be extremely difficult for the 
Partnership to sell. In addition, certain Portfolio Managers with which the Partnership invests 
may prohibit the Partnership from making withdrawals of capital from its investments for a 
substantial period of time and/or charge the Partnership certain fees upon its withdrawal of 
capital therefrom. See also "In-Kind Distributions." 
Certain Investors. 
Certain prospective Limited Partners may be subject to laws 
(including, without limitation, tax laws), rules and regulations which may regulate their 
participation in the Partnership, or their engaging directly, or indirectly through an investment in 
the Partnership, in trading strategies of the types which the Partnership and certain Portfolio 
Managers may utilize from time to time (e.g., short sales of securities and the use of leverage). 
Prospective Limited Partners are strongly urged to consult with their legal and tax advisors prior 
to investing in the Partnership. 
Indemnification. The Limited Partnership Agreement and the Investment Management 
Agreement contain broad indemnification provisions that require the Partnership to indemnify 
and hold the General Partner, the Investment Manager and their respective principals, members 
and managers, as applicable, harmless from any losses or costs incurred by them except in
