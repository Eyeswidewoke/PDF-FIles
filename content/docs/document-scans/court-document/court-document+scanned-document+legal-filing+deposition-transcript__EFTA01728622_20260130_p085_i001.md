The major area of controversy focuses on the question of wherein does the 
"lasciviousness" in question lie. There appear to be only three possibilities. They 
are in the 
■ child portrayed 
■ photographer/producer 
■ recipient/collector 
The courts seem to be in clear agreement that the lasciviousness is not neces-
sarily a characteristic of the child portrayed (first bullet above). In fact, other than 
attorneys defending child pornographers, some of the few lawyers taking a pub-
lic position that the child must be acting or posing lasciviously were the U.S. 
Department of Justice attorneys in their 1993 brief to the Supreme Court con-
cerning United States v. Knox, 510 U.S. 939 (1993) (case below, U.S. v. Knox, 977 
F.2d 815 (3rd Cir. 1992)). Their opinion was ridiculed by the U.S. Congress, 
experts in the field, the public, and it was eventually rejected in United States v. 
Knox, 32 R3d 733 (3rd Cir. 1994). 
The lasciviousness of the photographer/producer (second bullet above), how-
ever, is the area where the appellate courts have focused most of their attention 
and decisions. It appears that evidence the creator of the image intended to •elidt 
a sexual response in the viewer greatly increases the likelihood that the material in 
question will be found to be lascivious. The often-cited criteria set forth in United 
States v. Wiegand, 812 F.2d 1239, 1243-45 (9* Cir. 1987) and United States v. Dost, 
636 F. Supp. 828, 832 (S.D. Cal. 1986) are primarily an attempt to determine this 
lascivious intent of the photographer by only examining the visual depictions 
themselves. Determining intent can be difficult if the photographer or circum-
stances of production are unknown. The courts state, however, that this "analysis 
is qualitative and no single factor is dispositive." (See e.g. Knox, 32 F.3d at 746.) 
This focus on the intent of the photographer is most obvious in United States 
v. ?Ward, 885 F.2d 117, 124 (3rd Cir. 1989). In its decision the court even states 
that it is ignoring the dear evidence that the defendant, who was not the photog-
rapher, was in fact amused by the material in question. Id. at 125. The court 
states, "child pornography is not created when the pedophile derives sexual 
enjoyment from an otherwise innocent photo" and "we must, therefore, look at 
the photograph, rather than the viewer." Id. The significance of this decision must 
be viewed with the knowledge that the pictures in question were not available for 
the jury or court to view. 
It is the possible lasciviousness in the recipient/collector (third bullet above) of 
child pornography where there is the greatest controversy and confusion. This is 
especially problematic in view of the fact that mere possession of child pornogra-
phy is a federal offense, and the defendant in most computer child-pornography 
prosecutions is not the photographer/producer of the material. 
There is also the legal issue of what constitutes "production" of child pornog-
raphy. It certainly goes beyond just the photographer who took the picture. In 
United States v. Cross, 928 F.2d 1030, 1042-43 (11* Cir. 1991), the court stated, 
"...photographs [of nude children]...qualified as 'lewd' within meaning of the 
child pornography statute, even though children were not portrayed as sexually
