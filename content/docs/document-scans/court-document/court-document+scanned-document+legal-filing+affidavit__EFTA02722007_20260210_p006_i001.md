did not perceive themselves as refugees and were not necessarily eager to go back to 
Afghanistan once the Taliban fell 23 
Hence, this pre-9/11 problem is still pretty burdensome for Iran. The numbers given by the 
UN are proof: In 2009, as many as 954,000 Afghans were in the Islamic Republic of Iran 
legally, about 1.5 million illegally. From the Iranian point of view, it had a social and 
economic impact that made the presence of those refugees difficult to deal with. Xenophobia 
has been on the rise against them, an unfortunate but all-too-predictable situation. The term 
'Afghani' has become pejorative in Iran. And the state had to take into account that section of 
the Iranian population which was most unhappy with the presence of the Afghans, even 
though Tehran had first done quite much to help them since the 1980s. For example, in the 
last few years, the children of recent illegal immigrants have no access to public schools 
anymore.24 And during the 13ih day of the celebration of Nowruz (Persian New Year)25, the 
city of Isfahan banned the Afghans from entering the city's park, in order to protect Iranian 
citizens against 'insecurities' 26 If Iran has been and continues to be a source of opportunities 
and education for Afghans, the pressure of migration on the country is also a source of 
tensions between the two nations. And those tensions have been a social issue difficult for 
Iran, even if the Afghan refugees have become part of the Iranian society, the most 
intellectual circles included, and even if numerous Iranians have also been sympathetic to 
Afghan sufferings.27 Besides, Iranian economy is weak enough as it is, and life is difficult for 
the average Iranian, making the burden represented by the refugees even more difficult to 
accept.28 It has been evaluated that an Afghan worker is costing the Iranian government two 
US dollars a day, regardless of whether the refugee is residing in Iran legally or illegally. And 
deportations cannot change the situation. In 2009, 937 illegal migrants a day were deported. 
23 It is important to keep in mind that after three decades in Iran, more than half of the Afghan refugees are in 
fact those born in Iran itself. Sec Bruce Kocpkc, 'The Situation of Afghans in the Islamic Republic of Iran

27 One only needs to turn to poetry to get proof of such a fact. One of the most well-known poems in modern 
Persian literature, 1111a:ghast-, 'The Return', has been written by an Afghan poet, Kazem Kazemi, talking 
about the sufferings of Afghan refugees in Iran going back to his country. The verses of this poem are widely 
known, in Iran as in Afghanistan. See Aria Fani 'One Tongue, No Tongue: "Return" and 'Afghan-Iranian
