Fund Expenses, and each additional Limited Partner admitted to the Partnership at a Subsequent 
Closing shall make Capital Contributions to the Partnership in accordance with Section 2.04(c). 
In addition, each Limited Partner admitted on the Initial Closing Date shall pay the placement fee 
specified in its Subscription Agreement in full on the Initial Closing Date and such payment shall 
not reduce such Limited Partner's Remaining Capital Commitment. 
(b) 
The Limited Partners expressly agree that the General Partner may in its 
discretion cause the Partnership to admit additional or substituted Limited Partners or allow 
existing Limited Partners to increase their Capital Commitment (i) at any time until and 
including the Final Admission Date of the Master Fund (as defined in the Master Fund LPA)

Transfer, in accordance with Article 10, or (iv) in connection with a transfer of a Limited 
Partner's Interest from a Parallel Investment Entity in accordance with Section 3.04 or from the 
Offshore Feeder Fund in accordance with Section 10.01. Each such additional or substituted 
Limited Partner shall become a Limited Partner upon compliance with the provisions of Section 
10.02(b). The admission of any additional or substituted Limited Partner to the Partnership or 
the increase of a Limited Partner's Capital Commitment shall not require the approval of any 
Limited Partner.

to the amount of such increase, shall be required, in connection with such Subsequent Closing, to

Percentage Interest of Capital Contributions made prior to the date of its admission with respect 
to the Feeder Fund Expenses (excluding the Onshore Feeder Fund Management Fees and the 
Investment Expenses), and (y) an amount equal to Onshore Feeder Fund Management Fees that 
would have been payable in respect of such Limited Partner had such Limited Partner been 
admitted, or had committed to its total Capital Commitment, to the Partnership on the Initial 
Closing Date, and (ii) to pay to the Partnership, for the account of (x) Limited Partners that 
participated in prior closings (with respect to such Feeder Fund Expenses (other than the 
Onshore Feeder Fund Management Fee)) and (y) the Investment Manager (with respect to such 
Capital Contributions used to pay Onshore Feeder Fund Management Fees), interest on the 
amount payable pursuant to clause (i) of this Section 2.04(c) at the rate equal to the higher of (A) 
LIBOR plus 2% and (B) 8% (the "Subsequent Close Rate"), calculated on the basis of a 360-
day year from the date the Capital Commitments to fund such items were initially drawn-down 
to the date the Limited Partner makes its first Capital Contribution in connection with such 
Subsequent Closing. In addition, each Limited Partner admitted to the Partnership at a 
Subsequent Closing or each existing Limited Partner increasing its Capital Commitment with 
respect to the amount of such increase, shall be required, in connection with such Subsequent 
Closing, to fund an amount equal to the amount drawn-down from the Partnership by the Master 
Fund in connection with the admission of such additional Limited Partner or increase in Capital 
Commitments of such existing Limited Partner and related increase in the Partnership's 
commitment to the Master Fund (which amount is expected to include an interest component at
