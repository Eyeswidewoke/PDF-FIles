Important Information and Disclosures 
Pricing 
This section includes the net market value of the securities in your account on a settlement date basis, including short positions, at the dose of the statement period. The market prices have been obtained from 
sources which we believe to be rehable. Pershing may not use the closing price of the particular exchange or marketplace where your position was purchased as the 'Market Price.' Securities for which a price is 
not available are marked —N/A— and are omitted from the Total. 
The estimated annual income (EAI) and estimated current yield (ECY) figures are estimates and for informational purposes only. These figures are not considered to be a forecast or guarantee of future results. 
These figures are computed using information from providers believed to be reliable: however, no assurance can be made as to the accuracy. Since interest and dividend rates are subject to change at any time, 
and may be affected by current and future economic, political, and business conditions, they should not be relied on for making investment, trading, or tax decisions. These figures assume that the position 
quantities. interest and dividend rates. and prices remain constant A capital gain or return of principal may be included in the figures for certain securities, thereby overstating them. Refer to 
ynwipershing.cornibtisiness_continuily.html for specific details as to formulas used to calculate the figures. Accrued interest represents interest earned but not yet received. 
THE AS OF PRICE DATE ONLY APPEARS WHEN THE PRICE DATE DOES NOT EQUAL THE STATEMENT DATE. 
Reinvestment 
The dollar amount of Mutual Fund distributions, Money Market Fund dividend income, Bank Deposit interest income, or dividends for other securities shown on your statement may have been reinvested. You wit 
not receive confirmation of these reinvestments. Upon written request to your financial institution, information pertaining to these transactions, including the time of execution and the name of the person from 
whom your security was purchased, may be obtained. In dividend renvestment transactions, Pershing acts as your agent and receives payment for order flow. 
Options 
information with respect to commissions and other charges incurred in connection with the execution of option transactions has been included in confirmations previously furnished to you. A summary of this 
information Is available to you promptly upon your written request directed to your introducing firm. In order to assist your introducing firm in maintaining current background and financial information concerning 
your option accounts, please promptly advise them in writing of any material change in your investment objectives or financial situation. Expiring options which are valuable are exercised automatically pursuant to 
the exercise by exception procedure of the Options Clearing Corporation. Additional information regarding this procedure is available upon written request to your introducing firm. 
Proxy Vote 
Securities not fully paid for in your margin account may be lent by Pershing to itself or others in accordance with the terms outlined in the Margin Agreement. The right to vote your shares held on margin may be 
reduced by the amount of shares on loan. The Proxy Voting Instruction Form sent to you may reflect a smaller number of shares entitled to vote than the number of shares in your margin account. 
Foreign Currency Transactions 
Pershing may execute foreign currency transactions as principal for your account. Pershing may automatically convert foreign currency to or from U.S. dollars for dividends and similar corporate action 
transactions unless you instruct your financial organization otherwise. Pershing's currency conversion rate win not exceed the highest interbank conversion rate identified from customary banking sources on the 
conversion date or the prior business day, increased by up to 1%, unless a particular rate is required by applicable law. Your financial organization may also increase the currency conversion rate. This conversion 
rate may differ from rates in effect on the date you executed a transaction, incurred a charge, or received a credit. Transactions converted by agents (such as depositories) will be billed at the rates such agents 
use.
