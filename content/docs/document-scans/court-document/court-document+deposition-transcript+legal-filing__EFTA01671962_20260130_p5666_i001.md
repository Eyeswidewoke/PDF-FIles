Detail of Changes to Your Cardmember Agreement 
This notice amends the Cardmember Agreement (the "Agreement") as described below. We have the right 
to amend as described in the Agreement. Any terms in the Agreement conflicting with these clarifications are 
replaced fully and completely. Terms not clarified by this notice remain in full force and effect. 
About Your Payments 
Effective September 1, 2016, in Part 2 of the Cardmember Agreement, we are amending the About your 
payments section by inserting the below new sub-section after the When you must pay sub-section: 
Minimum Payment 
Due and Plum 
Payment Options 
Each month you must pay at least your Minimum Payment Due by the Payment 
Due Date. As long as you satisfy that requirement, you may take advantage of 
your Plum payment options for any new charges on your billing statement. If 
your account is current, your Minimum Payment Due is 10% of the balance from 
new activity on your billing statement plus the entire amount of any outstanding 
deferred balance. If your account is past due, your Minimum Payment Due is 
your entire New Balance on your statement. 
Early Pay Discount 
Effective September 1, 2016, in the About your payments section of Part 2 of the Cardmember Agreement, we 
are deleting the text in the Early Pay Discount sub-section in its entirety and replacing it with the following: 
You may receive a discount on a portion of your eligible charges in a billing period if: 
• you make a payment before the Early Pay Due Date, 
• the payment exceeds your previously deferred balance, if any, 
And 
• you satisfy the Minimum Payment Due by the Payment Due Date. 
The discount is 1.5% of the portion of your payment that: 
• exceeds your previously deferred balance, and 
• does not exceed your total eligible charges for the billing period 
You will receive the discount in the form of a statement credit on your next statement. You will not 
receive the credit, however, if your Account is closed or in default on the Closing Date of the billing 
period in which the credit is scheduled to be issued. 
Eligible charges are purchases of goods and services for use or consumption by the Company in its 
ordinary course of business, minus returns and other credits. 
Eligible charges do NOT include: 
• previously deferred amounts, 
• past due amounts, 
• purchases of traveler's checks, 
• purchases or reloading of prepaid cards, or 
• purchases of any cash equivalents. 
Disputed charges do not become eligible charges until the dispute has been resolved and the charges 
remain on the Account. If for any reason you receive a discount that exceeds 1.5% of your eligible 
charges, we reserve the right to debit your account for the excess amount. 
Defer Pay Option (Extra Days to Pay) 
Effective September 1, 2016, in the About your payments section of Part 2 of the Cardmember Agreement, we 
are deleting the text in the Defer Pay (Extra Days to Pay) sub-section in its entirety and replacing it with the 
following: 
If you pay your Minimum Payment Due by the Payment Due Date, you can take Extra Days to Pay by 
deferring payment of the remainder of the New Balance on the current statement until the Payment 
Due Date on your next statement (see Minimum Payment Due and Plum Payment Options above). You 
cannot take Extra Days to Pay if the Account is past due.
