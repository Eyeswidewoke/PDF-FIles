Following the prescribed Benzatropine to combat the extreme overwhelming side effects of 
the ordered injections the medication prescribed proceeded to elevate some of the side effects 
but the suicidal thoughts remained and on one occasion I took an over dose of Benzatropine to 
end my life but was not successful. I threw away the Benzatropine following this event and began 
to combat the side effects naturally through disciplined activities and thought processes 
I was on the ordered medication / injections for a period of 16 months and also an ordered 
Community Treatment order for 12 months of which all of my rights were stripped away from me 
During this time I relocated from Port Pine to Kadina in February 2017, following my release from 
the illegal detainment in Glenside, which I was illegally detained for a period of 6 weeks. 
Unbeknown to me in 2006-2013 I was a targeted victim b 
in my whole life by a man who claimed his name was 
in London, UK, but used the email address 
email with an initial 
not Adam or used a surname, as 
name with ■ 
not her full name or surname. 
During constant and continual email contact with maxwell, which occurred every night, London 
time in the periods of 2006-2013, and during the year of 2010 during the business development 
M.S.I.0 I asked maxwell f he could assist me with designing the business logo for my business 
development, of which he agreed. The business logo design M.S.I.0 was conducted online via 
email in 2010 and I received the business logo design from maxwell via email as attachments as

who also claimed he resided

During the business development plan The Specialist medical Centre in 2009 I was involved in 
email contact with the Australian Government Department NEIS, a business support and training 
program that also financially supports small business start up - The funding of the business plan 
was denied by NEIS during this development 
In 2011, during the business development of M.S.I.0 and a fashion design business J Monequic I 
was involved in email contact with the Australian Government Department NEIS seeking funding 
and business support 
During this email contact with the Australian Government Department  NEIS I received an email 
containing email attachments which was received as

Exact format as received from maxwell in 2010  via email attachments during the business logo 
design of M.S.I.0 
Documented evidence of the Australian Government and Australian Government Departments 
connected to Epstein and Maxwell who were involved in direct targeting of the targeted victim in 
2006-2013 and involved portraying a deep meaningful friendship tactic of gaining trust. 
During the constant and continuous email interaction between myself and maxwell in 2006-2013 
the interactions contained sexual overtones of maxwell's encouragement to interact sexually and 
engage in sexual conversations and requested and encouraged me to send explicit sexual 
material, of which as a naive, sexually inexperienced mother of 4 children who had just 
separated from a 17 year abusive relationship of which I was isolated under his control from any 
form of contact outside of the household found intriguing and curiosity fuelled the situation and I 
complied and supplied sexual material to maxwell under his encouragement, and this fact of my 
naivety was played upon by Epstein and Maxwell by making the targeted victim / me feel sexually 
attractive, something g I had not felt before, having been in a marriage that was not of a loving or 
sexual nature, and my husband at the time was my third partner, having met him at the age of 20 
years old.
