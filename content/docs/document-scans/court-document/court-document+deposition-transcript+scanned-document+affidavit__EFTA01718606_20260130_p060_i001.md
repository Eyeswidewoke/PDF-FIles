At each juncture. the inclusion of a civil remedy in the Agreement has resulted in 
unending debates and disagreements with respect to the appropriate manner in which to 
implement the tents of the Section 2255 component. The main issues that have arisen since the 
drafting and execution of the final agreement include the process for the selection of an attorney 
representative: the scope of Mr. Epstein's waiver of liability and jurisdiction; the role of the 
attorney representative; the language contained in various drafts of the letter to the independent 
third puny; the correct amount of minimum damages pursuant to Section 2255; the extent and 
substance of communications between the witnesses and alleged victims and re USA° and the 
FBI. particularly with respect to the settlemcm process: the language contained In tlx: letters 
proposed to be sent to the alleged victims; and the extent of continued federal involvement in the 
state procedures of Mr. Epstein's state plea and sentence. 
Notably, neither Section 2255. nor any oilier civil remedy statute, has been used as a pre-
requisite to criminal plea agreement and it is clear that the use of these terms creates 
unanticipated issues. Furthermore. the waiver of rights of which the USA() insisted is also not a 
traditional aspect of criminal resolutions. While we were reluctant and cautious about a Non-
Prosecution Agreement in which a 'criminal defendant gives up certain rights to contest liability 
for a civil settlement, we did not believe there was room ror contention given the USAO's, and 
specifically, Ms. Villafana's ultimatums that required that we acquiesce to these unprecedented 
terms. 
Concerns Retarding Section 2255 
Mr Epstein unconditionally re-asserts his intention to fulfill and not seek to withdraw 
from or unwind the Agreement previously entered. Ile raises important issues regarding the 
implementation or the 2255 provisions not to unwind the provisions or invalidate the Agreement 
but instead to cull attention to serious matters of policy and principles that you are requested to 
review. 
As you will see below our main policy-related concerns are (I) the Inclusion of Section 
2255. a civil remedies statutes in a criminal plea agreement, (2) the blanket waiver of jurisdiction 
and liability as to certain unidentified individuals to whose claims the government has asserted 
they take no position, and (3) any communications between federal authorities, including your 
staff and the Frit and witnesses and alleged victims and the nature of such communications. 
With respect to the interpretation of the terms of the Agreement, we do not agree with your 
Oftice's interpretation of the expansive scope of Mr. Epstein's agreement to waive liability and 
jurisdiction. Nor do we agree with your Office's view or the expansive role of the attorney 
representative. Below. I describe first, the policy implications and the practical problems that 
these terms have created or will create. Second. I describe points or contention us to the 
interpretation of various terms of the Section 2255 component of the Agreement.
