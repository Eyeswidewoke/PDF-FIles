RIN II •094 Alpha Group Capital LLC 
intends not to accept a subscription from any person or entity that does not represent that such standards are met. In the 
case of purchases of Preferred Shares by fiduciary accounts, the foregoing standards must be met either by the fiduciary 
account or by such person who directly or indirectly supplies the funds to the fiduciary account for the purchase of the 
Preferred Shares. The Preferred Shares are offered subject to the right of the Issuer or the Placement Agents to reject any 
subscription in whole or in part for any reason or no reason at all. The information in this Memorandum is subject to 
change. 
Investors in the Preferred Shares may not be able to liquidate their investment in the Preferred Shares in the event of an 
emergency or for any other reason because there is not now any market for Preferred Shares and it is not anticipated that 
one will develop. In addition, the Preferred Shares have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act, and 
may not be Transferred except pursuant to an exemption from registration of the Preferred Shares under the Securities Act 
and an exemption from registration of the Issuer under the Investment Company Act. Various U.S. state laws and non-U.S. 
laws relating to the sale of securities may also require compliance before any transfer of Preferred Shares is 
affected. Transferability of the Preferred Shares is subject to certain further restrictions in the Articles, the PS Issuing and 
Paying Agency Agreement and the PS Purchase Agreement (see Section 11, "Summary of Principal Terms—Preferred 
Shares—Purchase Restrictions'). Each prospective Investor in the Preferred Shares must be prepared to hold its 
investment for the life of the Preferred Shares (see Section 12, "Certain Risk Factors").
