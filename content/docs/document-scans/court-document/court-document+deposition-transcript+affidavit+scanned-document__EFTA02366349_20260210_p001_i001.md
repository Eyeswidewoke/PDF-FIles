&nbs=; I am concerned that the courtyard lights , that are still not=done after one month and 
much of my personal time. is emblematic of a overa=l problem. ONE month ago. I asked for lights that light u= the 
whole courtyard as the others were removed. I told you I w=nted three types of FLOODLIGHTS and not spots .&nbs=; 
1 you told me danny said home depot were ou=. . next day still not done. you told me danny had no tim= then 2 he 
put up small landscpate lights that didnt wor= I told you again I wanted to see three or four choices so we can move 
foward. I did not. y=u told me ron ordered some.. I arrived and they were spotlight= and focused on only one tree 
telling me you forgot what i wanted ,&n=sp; NExt day, nothing happend you told me we didnt have a ladder . I had to 
explain that we do, or get one. you to=d me we didnt . I arrive to find lights again not done.&n=sp; you tell me , well 
I told danny and when i saw it it w=s 415 . so again ONE momth and ten questions to me.=nbsp; NOTHING works. . 
=nbsp; 
2. the rerrigerator does not have properly prefpared snacks for guests ,&=bsp; it has bins of 
fruit, 4 day old pita , days old baguette .=nbsp; a total disgrace. 
you told me you=were an executive chef , abut the 
guest fridge looks like=cafeteria in a bad public school 
&n=sp; 
3. Instead o= me having to ask Danny or others , re the competence of RON&nb=p; you should 
have asked them - you would have been told , as e=eryone else on the island - that he knew little about electric ,=and 
was a building inspector not a mechanic. = 
&nbs=; 4. I have had to ask about a swing , n=t a critical component . not that important . now aprox 
1= times. . each time either i was told it was handled , on=order and only yesterday told it was being shpped FROM 
palm beach on t=el7th. also not true. 
&=bsp; 
5.&n=sp; you told me that you help out , getting your hands dirty and i sh=uld ask dupson. I did 
, and he said no , you D= NON nor did anyone else, boat washing. etc. 
&=bsp; 6. not sure why you waited until the end of the day to ask=about dinner. ? requring an 
addtioanl trip after 5 o=lock. . woudl have been easy to ask , as you should somet=me during the day, . 
&n=sp; I expect . 1 the food is to be presented ,=in the fridge like you would a dinner. ask what people 
want.&nb=p; !!!
