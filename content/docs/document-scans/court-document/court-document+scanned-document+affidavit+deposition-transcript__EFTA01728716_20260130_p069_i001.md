Children Never Lie? 
The available evidence suggests that children rarely lie about sexual victimization, if a lie 
is defined as a statement deliberately and maliciously intended to deceive. If children in these 
cases do lie, it may be because factors such as shame or embarrassment over the nature of the 
victimization increase the likelihood that they misrepresent the sexual activity. Seduced victims 
sometimes lie to make their victimization more socially acceptable or to please an adult's 
concept of victimization. Occasionally children lie because they are angry and want to get 
revenge on somebody. Some children, sadly, lie about sexual victimization to get attention and 
forgiveness. A few children may even lie to get money or as part of a lawsuit. This can 
sometimes be influenced by pressure from their parents. Objective investigators must consider 
and evaluate all these possibilities. It is extremely important to recognize, however, that because 
children might lie about part of their victimization does not mean that the entire allegation is 
necessarily a lie and they are not victims. Acquaintance-exploitation cases often involve 
complex dynamics and numerous incidents that often make it difficult to say an allegation is all 
true or all false. 
• 
An important part of the evaluation and assessment of allegations of sexual victimization 
of children is comparing the consistency of allegations: 1) among what multiple victims allege to 
have happened and 2) between what is alleged and who is suspected of doing it is. If a victim 
describes his or her victimization as involving what clearly sound like the behavior patterns of a 
certain type of sex offender, then the fact that the alleged offender fits that pattern is 
corroborative. If he does not, there is an inconsistency that needs to be resolved. The 
inconsistency could be because the alleged what is inaccurate (e.g., distorted account from 
victim, insufficient details), the suspected who has been misevaluated (e.g., incomplete 
background, erroneous assessment), or the alleged who is innocent (e.g., suspect did not commit 
alleged crime). In my experience, distorted accounts from victims are frequently caused or 
influenced by various interveners (e.g., therapists, physicians, parents, law enforcement) who are 
unwilling to nonjudgmentally accept the realty of the nature of the actual molestation of children. 
Instead, they influence, pressure, or lead the children to describe the victimization in a way that 
fits their agenda or needs and in the process destroy the prosecutive potential of a valid case. 
Understanding the Seduition Process 
Most compliant child victims were courted, groomed, or seduced over time by an adult. True 
understanding of this process must be incorporated into the intervention of these cases. For example, 
pediatricians or therapists who only discuss forced or unwanted sexual activity with their patients 
are potentially missing a significant area of sexual victimization of children. Because a child wanted 
to have sex with an adult, does not mean it is not abuse and a crime. After understanding the 
seduction process, the intervener must be able to conununicate this understanding to the victim. This 
is the difficult part. 
Interveners need to be careful about asking questions that communicate ajudgment about the
