(4) 
Such other instruments, documents, agreements, opinions or certificates that a 
Subscriber has informed the Issuer and the Escrow Agent it is requesting; and 
(5) 
Such other certificates, notices or other documents as Escrow Agent, in its 
discretion, shall reasonably require. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Subscriber, in writing, may at any time permit the 
Escrow Agent to disburse such Subscriber's portion of Escrow Funds to the Issuer. Additionally, 
the Escrow Agent shall not be obligated to notify the Issuer to make arrangements to issue the 
Debentures to the Subscriber and the Escrow Funds to the Issuer if the Escrow Agent has 
grounds to believe that any of the certifications and opinions set forth in the documents or 
accounting referred to in Section 4 are incorrect or incomplete. Prior to disbursing any Escrow 
Funds, the Escrow Agent shall be entitled, in its reasonable discretion, to require any additional 
written certificates or authorizations that it deems necessary or desirable. 
b. 
Rejection of any Subscription or termination of the Offering. No later than 
two (2) business days after receipt by the Escrow Agent of written notice (i) from the Issuer that 
the Issuer intends to reject a Subscriber's subscription, or (ii) from the Issuer that there will be 
no closing of the sale of Debentures to the Subscribers, the Escrow Agent shall pay to each 
Subscriber, by regular check or wire, the applicable amount of the Cash Investment paid by each 
Subscriber, and without deduction (except in the case of a wire, when all applicable bank costs 
for wires will be deducted). 
c. 
Expiration of Offering Period. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary 
contained herein, if the Escrow Agent shall not have received a notice of completion of the 
offering of the Debentures on or before [ 
], 20 [ ], the Escrow Agent shall, within 
five (5) business days after such date and without any further instruction or direction from the 
Issuer, return to each Subscriber, by attorney or bank check and by first class mail, the Cash 
Investment made by such Subscriber without deduction. The foregoing is subject to extension of 
the offering period by the Issuer; provided, that written notice is given to the Escrow Agent. 
S. 
Suspension of Performance or Disbursement Into Court. If, at any time, there 
shall exist any dispute between or among the Issuer, the Escrow Agent, any Subscriber or any 
other person with respect to the holding or disposition of any portion of the Escrow Funds or any 
other obligations of Escrow Agent hereunder, or if at any time Escrow Agent is unable to 
determine, to Escrow Agent's sole satisfaction, the release of any portion of the Escrow Funds in 
accordance with this Agreement or the Escrow Agent's proper actions with respect to its 
obligations hereunder, or if the Issuer has not within 30 days of the furnishing by the Escrow 
Agent of a notice of resignation pursuant to Section 7 hereof appointed a successor Escrow Agent 
to act hereunder, then the Escrow Agent may, in its sole discretion, take either or both of the 
following actions: 
a. 
suspend the performance of any of its obligations under this Escrow 
Agreement until such dispute or uncertainty shall be resolved to the sole satisfaction of the
