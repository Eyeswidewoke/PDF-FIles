The Florida Senate 
Issue Brief 2009-312 
October 2008 
Committee on Criminal Justice 
FISCAL, POLICY, AND LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS REGARDING STATE 
COMPLIANCE WITH THE ADAM WALSH ACT 
Statement of the Issue 
Florida is approaching a crossroad regarding its laws on sex offender registration and notification. Legislators will 
need to determine whether Florida should substantially implement the federal Sex Offender Registration and 
Notification Act (SORNA), which is Title I of the Adam Walsh Protection and Safety Act of 2006 (AWA),' or 
not substantially implement SORNA, which would result in Florida incurring a 10 percent reduction in Byrne 
Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) funding (the penalty Congress has provided for non-compliance with SORNA 
requirements). 
Discussion 
This brief focuses on fiscal, policy, and legal considerations that may be relevant to legislators in determining 
whether to substantially implement SORNA. To the extent information is available, the potential fiscal impact of 
substantially implementing SORNA will be compared to the impact of non-compliance. This brief will also focus 
on three SORNA requirements that Florida has not adopted and that appear most likely to generate discussion and 
debate: the registration of employment information and public listing of the address of the employer of a 
registered sex offender; the registration of school information and public listing of the address of a secondary 
school of a registered juvenile sex offender: and the retroactive application of SORNA requirements.2
Background 
The AWA, of which SORNA is a part, is the latest in a long line of federal legislation affecting states' 
registration/notification laws, and attempts to make all of these states' laws uniform with respect to requirements 
(or "minimum" standards) that Congress has judged to be necessary to be included in states' laws. It appears that 
the AWA has generated significant debate and controversy. Illustrative of this controversy, the National 
Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL) has described the AWA as an "unfunded mandate," a "one-size-fits-all 
approach to classifying, registering and, in some circumstances, sentencing sex offenders," and legislation that 
was "crafted without state input or consideration of state practices:4
In 2007, the Florida Legislature enacted legislation to revise Florida's laws to comply with SORNA (SB 16044
and some provisions of SB 1004, the Cybercrimes Against Children Act of 2007). SB 1604 adopted many, but 
P.L. 109-248 (July 27, 2006) 
2 There may also be considerations other than these fiscal, policy, and legal considerations that may be of importance to 
legislators in determining whether to comply with SORNA. For example, the AWA bears the name of Adam Walsh, a 
Florida victim, and, according to its declaration of purpose (SORNA § 102), was intended to respond to "vicious attacks by 
violent predators" against victims listed in the declaration, which include Florida victims (Jessica Lunsford, Sarah Lunde, 
Jimmy Ryce, Carlie Brucia, and Amanda Brown). [References to SORNA sections used in this brief are references to 
sections of P.L. 109-248 (July 27, 2006)].
