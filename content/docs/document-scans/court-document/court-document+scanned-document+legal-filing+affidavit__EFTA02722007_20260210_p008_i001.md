unnecessary violence. After the fall of Kabul to the Taliban, it appears that the Iranians tried 
to negotiate with Islamabad a peace deal that could be in their mutual interests. Iran's idea 
was to recognise the Pashtun political predominance in exchange for the safety of Afghan 
Shiites and recognition of their political stake and influence.35 The reasoning was to 
recognise that the ones closest to the Pakistanis in Afghanistan won and to obtain in exchange 
an acknowledgement of Iranian interests in that country. But the proposed deal was off before 
it could reach the Taliban. Indeed the hostility of the latter towards Iran was confirmed in 
August 1998, after the conquest of Mazar-e Sharif by the Taliban. Following this victory the 
Pashtun radicals killed nine Iranian diplomats living in the city. During the same period, they 
killed thousands of Hazaras.36 It was a clear insult to the Iranian state, as well as a veiled 
declaration of war on the Muslim sect it was supposed to represent. Those two events made 
the excuse given by the Taliban (i.e. the killing of the diplomats by 'renegade forces' who did 
not listen to the orders coming from the leadership) sound very unlikely.37 This last 
provocation brought Iran and Afghanistan very close to war. At that time, Ayatollah Ali 
Khamenei, the Supreme Leader of Iran, had put the army on alert and pressured Islamabad to 
stop supporting the Taliban; as for the 'Emirate', it threatened to strike at Iranian cities if the 
Iranian troops would dare to penetrate the Afghan territory.38 It was only the decisive action 
of Lakhdar Brahimi (the Special Representative of the UN Secretary General) that helped 
avoid a war that the Afghan 'hawks' clearly wanted. After these tensions, the more moderate 
or pragmatic Taliban wanted to improve the bilateral relationship. The idea found supporters 
among some foreign militants, like an important leader in the community of the Arab 
mujahedeen, Abu Walid al Masri. But Al Qaeda blocked their efforts, in spite of the inherent 
geopolitical rationality. The influence of the terrorist organisation was quite important if al 
Masri is to be trusted. He indeed said that he was able to convince Mullah Omar to improve 
relations with its main neighbours, Iran and Pakistan.39 The opposition of course was 
ideological in nature (the hatred against Shia Islam), but it was also linked to the mainstream

37 Even if the pragmatic or more moderate faction inside the Taliban appeared clearly afraid that the situation 
could evolve into a conventional war, it could not gain the upper hand. It explains why the Afghan Foreign 
Ministry asked the Pakistanis and the UN `to intercede' with Iran and to send representatives to Mazar-l-
Sharif in order to understand better, by themselves, the cause of what was presented as an incident. See on

J9 The idea of Pakistan totally controlling, or imposing its views on, the Taliban is indeed a gross 
misrepresentation of Afghan-Pakistani relations in the 1990s. If Islamabad had some level of influence, it did 
not mean a lack of freedom for the 'Afghan Emirate' at the time. And Afghans and Pakistanis, at this time as 
also after the fall of the Taliban, could not see eye to eye on important matters like the question of the 
Durand Line.
