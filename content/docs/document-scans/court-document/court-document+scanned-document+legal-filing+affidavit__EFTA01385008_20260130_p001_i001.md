American Farmland Company 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 
(Unaudited) 
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) 
intangible assets acquired will be further allocated to in-place lease values based on management's 
evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant's lease. When determining the non-cancelable 
term of the lease, fixed-rate renewal options. if any. are evaluated to sec if they should be included. 
Prior to 2013, all acquired leases were determined to be at market. In connection with one of our 2013 
acquisitions, we allocated $125,000 of the purchase price to a below-market lease, which terminated 
December 15, 2014. The fair value of capitalized below-market lease intangibles, included in the 
accompanying consolidated balance sheers as part of other liabilities, is amortized into rental income 
over the remaining, non-cancelable term of the lease. $55,556 was amortized during the six months 
ended June 30, 2014. In-place leases will be amortized over the remaining term of the lease. Should a 
tenant terminate its lease, the unamortized portion of any above-market and below-market lease values. 
in-place lease values and any associates intangibles will be immediately charged to the related income 
or expense. 
We account for the impairment of real estate, including intangible assets, in accordance with 
ASC 360-10-35, "Property, Plant, and Equipment," which requires us to periodically review the carrying 
value of each property to determine whether circumstances indicate impairment of the carrying value of 
the investment exists or if depreciation periods should be modified. If circumstances support the 
possibility of impairment, we prepare a projection of the undiscounted future cash flows, without 
interest charges, of the specific property and determine whether the carrying value of the investment in 
such property is recoverable. In performing the analysis, we consider such factors as agricultural and 
business conditions in the regions in which our farms are located, and the development period (if 
applicable), and whether there are indications that the fair value of the real estate has decreased. If the 
carrying amount is more than the aggregate undiscounted future cash flows, we would recognize an 
impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the property. 
We evaluate our entire property portfolio each quarter for any impairment indicators and perform 
an impairment analysis. We concluded that none of our properties were impaired as of Junc 30, 2015 
or December 31, 2014 and we will continue to monitor our portfolio for any indicators of impairment. 
There have been no impairments recognized on real estate assets since our inception.
