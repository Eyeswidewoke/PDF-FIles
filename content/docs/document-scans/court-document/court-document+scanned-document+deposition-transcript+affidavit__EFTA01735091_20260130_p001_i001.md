GIV NOISE .AND VIBRATION IN THE CABIN 
CHAFE INSPECTION 
revised 6/9/97 
by Al Lane 
Not to be provided to operators. Inspection info is in ANIM Chapter 54 (Pylon 
Inspection) and Chapter 71 (Powerplant Inspection). This is a quick reference for 
CAC personnel to locate repair info. 
Noise and/or vibration in the cabin has been reported on several GIV aircraft. Several areas can provide 
paths for normal engine vibration/harmonics to bypass the engine isolators and go directly into the cabin. In the 
cabin, the vibration can be felt, or heard as "noise". In most cases. identifying and eliminating "noise paths" 
eliminates the annoying cabin noise. A thorough inspection and correction of "noise paths" will correct the 
majority of cabin noise problems. 
The majority of the identified noise paths are associated with the engine mounting and fixed cowl. The 
GIV has a new mounting design that incorporates a fixed cowl which is fixed to the thrust reverser and nose 
cowl versus the engine crane beams. This design allows the "Floating" fixed cowl to move with the engine. 
Due to the new GIV engine mounting design. contact between the fixed cowl and the shear web/crane beams 
must be prevented. 
The most common isolation factor used to determine if cabin noise is being generated by the engine or a 
foul between the engine and mounting is the EVM indication system. If EVM indication is present (above 
approximately 0.16 ips), then a fan balance would be the first item to be performed. If EVM indication is less 
than approximately 0.16 ips. then a chafe inspection would be the first item to be performed. In all cases, exact 
details on when and where the noise is occurring, engine parameters, engine EVM indications, flight profile and 
flight time, would supply the required information to start the resolution process. 
The following information has been assembled to help maintenance personnel locate and eliminate the most 
common noise paths. Additional information regarding engine chafes and related Rolls-Royce modifications to 
the engine is provided in TAY Notice to Operators (NTO) No. 17. 
If additional information or assistance is needed please contact the area Gulfstream Field Service 
Representative or Gulfstream Technical Operations. 
A. Open upper and lower cowl doors on both nacelles. Check all hinge fittings on upper cowl and upper fixed 
cowl for evidence of contact with shear web/crane beam assembly. Look for chafe marks and damage on 
(or near) the fittings and fasteners on upper cowl and fixed cowl, then look for corresponding marks and 
damage on channels, Z-angles and fasteners on shear web and crane beams. Also check for clearance 
between metal seal on upper fixed cowl and both sides of the hooks, hinges and crane beams. 
B. Check pylon leading edge and pylon boards for contact with fixed cowl and fuselage. Check inside the 
pylon for contact between lines, components and brackets. Look for anything that may be contacting pylon 
boards, pylon support structure fixed cowl or fuselage. Check bearing in aft end of thrust strut for security. 
C. The following areas have been identified as noise paths into the cabin. Inspect these areas closely and 
unless otherwise specified, items apply to the left and right sides. 
1. Upper cowl: Look for contact between number two (2) upper cowl hook/fasteners and fixed cowl 
hook/rivets on shear web. Check for evidence of contact on both sides and outboard of fixed cowl 
hook. Repair per Grumman Service Bulletin 88-30.
