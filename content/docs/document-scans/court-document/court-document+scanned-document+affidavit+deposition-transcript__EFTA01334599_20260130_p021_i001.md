unless the parties subsequently agree upon a later date in writing, in which case such 
agreed upon date shall be deemed the "Closing Date". The Closing shall take place 
promptly after: (i) Purchaser's delivery of the Certificate of Technical Acceptance 
indicating Purchaser's Unconditional Acceptance of the Aircraft in accordance with 
Sections 3(f) and (h) hereof; and (2) confirmation from the Escrow Agent that the 
Escrow Agent has received the Purchase Price Balance from Purchaser and all Escrow 
Documents (as defined below), but in no event shall the Closing take place later than 
May 13, 2021 (the "Closing Date"). Seller and Purchaser hereby acknowledge that the 
passing of title, possession and delivery of the Aircraft shall take place within the state 
in which the Closing Place is located. The fuel costs and the expenses of Seller's flight 
crew, if any, in flying the Aircraft from the Inspection Facility to the Closing Place 
shall be the sole responsibility of and paid for by Purchaser. 
2. 
Immediately following Purchaser's and Seller's execution of this Second 
Amendment, Purchaser shall increase the amount of the Deposit by delivering an additional 
One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) to the Escrow Agent, whereupon the full amount 
of the Deposit, as so increased (i.e., Two Hundred Thousand Dollars (S200,000), hereinafter 
referred to as the "Increased Deposit"), shall be non-refundable and immediately, absolutely 
and unconditionally due and payable to Seller, regardless of whether or not a Closing shall 
thereafter occur. Concurrently with Purchaser's delivery of the additional amount of the 
Deposit to the Escrow Agent, Purchaser shall deliver to the Escrow Agent (and send a copy of 
the same to Seller) a signed written instruction directing the Escrow Agent to immediately 
disburse the Increased Deposit to Seller in accordance with Seller's disbursement directions, 
without any further writing or approval from Purchaser being required and without any 
requirement that a Closing occur. If and only if Seller receives the full amount of the Increased 
Deposit in accordance with Seller's disbursement instructions, the amount of the Purchase 
Price Balance required to be paid by Purchaser under the Agreement shall decrease to One 
Million Six Hundred Thousand Dollars ($1,600,000). The provisions of Paragraph 1 of this 
Second Amendment will not be effective unless and until Seller receives the full amount of 
the Deposit in accorMice with Seller's disbursement instructions.
