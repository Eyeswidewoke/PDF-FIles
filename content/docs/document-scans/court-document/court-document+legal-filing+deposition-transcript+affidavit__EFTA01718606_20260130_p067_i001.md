in any claim for damages • • by an etannerated "victim" or anyone else — where that puny fails to 
settle her claims pursuant to the terms of the Agreement. The revised draft of the letter avoids 
this misinterpretation and directly quotes Paragraphs 7. 8. 9 and 1() of the Agreement. While we 
do not have any objection to including this portion or the Agreement in the proposed letter, we 
request that Paragraphs 7A, 711, and 7C of the Addendum to the Agreement also be included 
because the language contained them in most clearly outlines the scope of Mr. Epstein's 
obligation to pay damages under the Agreement. 
C. 
Right of the Alleged Victims to Be Notified 
As we have expressed to you previously, we do not agree with your Office's Insertion 
that it is either an obligation and even appropriate for the (JSAO to send a victims notification 
letter to the alleged victims. The Justice for All Act of 2004 only contemplates notification in 
relation to available restitution for the victims of crimes. However. since Section 2255 is only 
one of many civil remedies, there is no requirement that the MAO inform alleged victims 
pursuant to the Justice tar All Act of 2004. Notably. if the USA() had agreed to include a 
restitution fund in the Agreement as opposed to a civil remedy statute, the alleged victims would 
have the right to be notified pursuant to the relevant Act. 
Further. we note that the reasons you cite in favor of issuing the proposed Victims 
Notification letter in your correspondence of December 4 are also inapplicable to this scenario. 
For instance, you cite 18 U.S.C. § 3771 for the proposition that your Office is obligated to 
provide certain notices to the alleged victims. however. 18 
§ 3771(a)(2) & (3) provide: 
A crime victim has the lidlowing rights: 
(2) The right to reasnnuble, accurate, and timely notice of any public corm proceeding_ or any 
parole proceeding, invoking the crime nr any release or escape of the accused. 
(3) The right not to be excluded from any such public court proceeding. unites 11w court, oiler 
receiving clear and convincing evidence, detemiiiws that testimony by the victim would he 
materially altered lithe victim bean] other testimony at the proceeding. 
(emphasis added). Your interpretation of § 3771 is erroneous because the rights conferred by the 
statute indicate that these rights arc for the notification and appearance at public proceedings 
involving the crime for which the relevant individual is a victim. As you know, the public 
proceeding in this matter will be in state court for the purpose of the entry of a plea on state 
charges. Therefore, 18 U.S.C. § 3771 clearly does not apply to "victims" who are not state 
"victims." You additionally cite your Office's obligations under § 3771(0(1) of the Justice for 
All Act of 2004. however, this subsection relates back to the "rights described in subsection 
(a)." Thus, since the rights set forth in subsection (a) only apply to the victims of the crimes for
