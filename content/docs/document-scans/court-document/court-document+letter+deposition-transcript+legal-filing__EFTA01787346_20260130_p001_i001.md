THe documents you forwarded to me include the PPM and the Subscription Agreements. No limited partnership 
agreement is attached. I would like to obtain a copy of the limited partnership agreement to check it against the 
description of terms contained in the Private Placement Memorandum. 
The investment to be subscribed for is for Class S Interests of a Delaware Limited Partnership, Blue Mountain 
Credit Alternatives Fund L.P., This Limited Partnership has been around since 2003 and has other interests outstanding. 
According to the PPM, the Limited Partnership is currently also offering the opportunity to subscribe for other classes of 
interests, but those other classes of interests are being offered to existing holders of those outstanding interests. The 
PPM indicates that the terms of the other interests are different from the Class S Interests. The PPM does not specify 
what the differences are but refers us to a 2009 Private Placement Memorandum for Class Q2 Interests, Are you aware 
of these other interests and do you want us to determine what differences there are in the different class of interests 
currently being offered. I would like to know whether the terms of the Q2 interests are more favorable than the terms 
of the Class S Interests? 
Minimum investment in Class S Interests is $1 Million and the subscription offer is being made only to Qualified 
Purchasers under the 40 Act, which must also be qualified eligible persons under Regulation 4.7 of the Commodities 
Exchange Act, and to Accredited Investors under Reg D of the Securities Act of 1933. 
The structure is a Master Fund/Feeder Fund Structure, which includes this Partnership for on-shore investors, an 
offshore fund and possibly other investment vehicles structured to meet the specific needs of certain U.S. Investors and 
non-U.S. Investors, all feeding into a Master Fund, Blue Mountain Credit Alternatives Master Fund, L.P., a Cayman 
Islands exempted limited partnership. The PPM states that as of the date of the PPM, September 2012, no Feeder Funds 
other than the Offshore Fund were in existence. I do not know what is the state of affairs today. 
. Withdrawals are considered to be made first from the sub-capital account (and corresponding sub-investment 
account) attributable to the earliest eligible capital contribution on a first-in first-out basis. 
The "soft lock" applies to requests to withdraw any investment tranche that is held for less than 12 months, and 
in the event of the withdrawal of a tranche held for less than 12 months, requires payment of a withdrawal fee of 3% of 
the Net Asset Value of the Interests withdrawn. 
The "Investor Level Limit", provides that the Partnership is not obligated to permit a withdrawal of more than 
25% per quarter of an investment tranche, so that a request to withdraw 100% of the tranche can generally take 4
