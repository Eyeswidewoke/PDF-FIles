Section 4.7. - Division and Combination of Trusts 
A. 
For any administrative, tax or other purpose determined by the Trustees to be 
in the best interests of any Beneficiary (including any remaindertnan) hereunder, the Trustees may at 
any time and from time to time (whether before or after funding), without approval of any court, 
divide any trust under this Agreement into two or more separate trusts or combine two or more mists 
with substantially identical terms (whether or not such trusts resulted from division of a prior trust). 
B. 
If property is directed to be added to any trust hereunder (the "Original 
Trust"), whether by the terms of this Agreement any other agreement, or the Will of any person, the 
Trustees may hold such property as one or more separate trusts on terms identical to the terms of the 
Original Trust The Trustees may allocate such property among the separate trusts (if any) into which 
the Original Trust was divided, whether or not pro-rata, using specific assets or undivided interests 
therein (including allocation of all such property to one of such separate trusts). 
C. 
Any time during the existence of separate trusts created by division of a trust 
hereunder, the Trustees may exercise all discretionary powers differently with respect to the separate 
trusts and take all other actions consistent with such trusts being separate entities. Furthermore, the 
holder of any power of appointment with respect to such separate trusts may exercise such power 
differently with respect to each such trust. 
Section 4.8. - Consolidation of Trusts 
If at any time after my death there is in existence a trust under my Will or any trust agreement created 
by me having identical beneficiaries and substantially the same terms as any trust under this 
Agreement, the Trustees may terminate the mast hereunder and transfer the assets thereof to the 
Trustees of such other trust, to be administered by the Trustees thereof. Different termination dates 
under the applicable Rule Against Perpetuities shall not be deemed a difference in the terms of such 
trusts, but the portion of the trust representing the transferred assets shall retain the same termination 
date as the original trust. 
Section 4.9. -Termination of Trusts 
Notwithstanding anything herein, any trust created hereunder for any person shall (unless terminated 
earlier) terminate upon the day preceding the expiration of the maximum period permitted under the 
United States Virgin Islands Rule Against Perpetuities, for the vesting of an interest in a trust and 
upon such date the assets of such trust shall be distributed to such person. 
Section 4.10. — EquitableAdjustment 
If any of the Trustees decides to exercise or not exercise any fiduciary power granted by this 
Agreement or by law (including, without limitation, any election available to any Trustee) and the 
exercise or nonexercise of such power confers a benefit on one Beneficiary or class of Beneficiaries 
hereunder and imposes a detriment upon another Beneficiary or class of Beneficiaries hereunder, the 
Trustees shall not attempt to restore the interests of the Beneficiaries or classes of Beneficiaries to the 
position otherwise contemplated by this Agreement through adjustment between income and 
principal or otherwise.
