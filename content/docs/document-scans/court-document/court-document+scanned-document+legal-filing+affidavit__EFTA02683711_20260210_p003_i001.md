Price (as defined herein). 
The number of shares of Common Stock to be issuable upon 
conversion of any accrued and unpaid interest amount on this Debenture shall be determined by 
dividing (x) accrued and unpaid interest to be converted by (y) the Fixed Conversion Price. The 
term "Fixed Conversion Price" means $0.50, subject to adjustment as provided herein. 
(b) 
Mechanics of Conversion. In order to convert Debentures into shares of Common 
Stock, the Holder shall surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, by either 
overnight courier or 2-day courier, to the office of the Company or of any transfer agent for the 
Debentures, and shall give written notice to the Company at such office with a copy to Chief 
Financial (Accounting) Officer, tel 905-695-4142, facsimile 905-695-5013, that such Holder 
elects to convert the same, the amount of principal and/or interest of the Debentures to be so 
converted and a calculation of the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued upon 
conversion; provided, however, that the Company shall not be obligated to issue certificates 
evidencing the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion unless either the 
certificates evidencing such Debentures are delivered to the Company or its transfer agent as 
provided above, or the Holder notifies the Company or its transfer agent that such certificates 
have been lost, stolen or destroyed and executes an agreement satisfactory to the Company to 
indemnify the Company from any loss incurred by it in connection with such certificates. 
The Company shall issue and deliver to the Holder within five (5) business days after 
delivery to the Company of such Debenture certificates, or after such agreement and 
indemnification, to such Holder of Debentures at the address of the Holder on the books of the 
Company, a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which the 
Holder shall be entitled as aforesaid. The date on which notice of conversion is given (the "Date 
of Conversion") shall be deemed to be the date in such notice of conversion is received by the 
Company; provided that the original Debentures to be converted are received by the transfer 
agent or the Company within five (5) business days thereafter, and the person or persons 
entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be treated 
for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock on such date. If 
the original Debentures to be converted are not received by the transfer agent or the Company 
within five (5) business days after the Date of Conversion, the notice of conversion shall become 
null and void. 
Following conversion of a Debenture, or a portion thereof, the principal and, upon 
payment thereof of the interest owed on that Debenture or portion of the Debenture so 
converted, will be deemed paid in full and satisfied, and such Debenture or portion thereof will 
no longer be outstanding. If this Debenture should be converted in part only, the Company shall 
promptly, upon surrender of this Debenture, execute and deliver a new Debenture. Whenever 
the Company is required to issue a new Debenture pursuant to the terms of this Debenture, such 
new Debenture (i) shall be of like tenor with this Debenture, (ii) shall represent, as indicated on 
the face of such new Debenture, the principal amount remaining outstanding, (iii) shall have an 
issuance date, as indicated on the face of such new Debenture, which is the same as the Issuance 
Date of this Debenture, (iv) shall have the same rights and conditions as this Debenture, and (v) 
shall represent the proportionate amount of accrued interest on the principal amount and 
interest of this Debenture that correspond to the principal of the new Debenture, from the
