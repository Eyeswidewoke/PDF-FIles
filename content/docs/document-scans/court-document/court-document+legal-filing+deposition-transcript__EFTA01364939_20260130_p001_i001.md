The Compelling Case for Long-Dated 
SPX Calls 
The current combination of low volatility levels and embedded protection 
makes longer-dated call strategies attractive to position for further equity 
appreciation. With call premia near decade-long lows, upside options offer 
benefits compared to long equity positions or can be used to safely enhance 
core cash equity holdings. In this note we examine the pricing drivers of SPX 
18- to 36-month expiry call options and compare historical returns of different 
strategies and to outright equity. Broadly, call strategies have exhibited better 
risk-adjusted returns than holding a cash position in the SPX index. 
Long dated calk on the SPX index are priced attiactivelv 
There are two main drivers of long-dated call premia, both of which help make 
pricing compelling right now 
• 
Long-dated SPX spot implied volatility is extremely low. The depressed 
rates volatility and low correlation between rates and equities create 
further downward pressure on the implied volatility of the SPX forward 
• 
The SPX forward itself is depressed vs. the spot level. The currently low 
level of interest rates and relatively high implied dividend yields have 
resulted in negative carry costs and have pressured the SPX forward, 
which makes the option premia appear low optically 
Choosing d long-dated call strategy' findings from our 10.•;ear beektest 
• 
We find that call spreads tended to have the highest risk-adjusted returns 
among the strategies studied. 
• 
Strategies involving selling 1M options to finance the longer-dated calls 
have performed better than equity and outright calls. These results are 
consistent with our previous research showing that implied volatility risk-
premium is typically rich for short-dated options. However, short 1M 
options underperform in strongly rallying markets, such as the SPX this 
year. 
• 
Rolling a long call (spread) position before expiry would have generally (but 
not always) resulted in higher risk-adjusted returns. Rolling prior to expiry 
reduces the negative effects of time decay. since shorter-dated options 
lose time value quickly 
Sensitivity of call premia and relative magnitude of risks 
While delta is the main driver of call P/L longer-dated options have a higher 
exposure to other risks. We compare the impact on current SPX call premium 
from changes in spot, time, implied volatility, rates, and dividend yields. 
Risks headline 
The loss from a long option or long option spread position is limited to the net 
premium paid. Please note that hypothetical backtest results are neither an 
indicator nor a guarantee of future returns.
