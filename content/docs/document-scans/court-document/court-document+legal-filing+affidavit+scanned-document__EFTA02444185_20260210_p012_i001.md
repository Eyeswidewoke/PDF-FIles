does, make any representation or warranty as to any future financial results. 
H. 
I have such knowledge, skill and experience in business, financial and investment matters 
so that I am capable of evaluating the merits and risks of an investment in the Company 
and purchase of Units (and the Constituent Securities, including, of any Underlying Shares 
upon the conversion of any Debenture(s) or upon the exercise of any Warrant(s)). To the 
extent necessary, I have retained, at my own expense, and relied upon, appropriate 
professional advice regarding the investment, tax and legal merits and consequences of 
this Subscription Agreement and the acquisition and ownership of Units (and the 
Constituent Securities). 
I. 
I am an "accredited investor" as defined in Rule 501(a) under the Securities Act. I agree 
to furnish any additional information requested to assure compliance with applicable 
federal and state securities laws in connection with the purchase and sale of the Units (or 
any Constituent Securities or Underlying Shares). I have completed, executed and 
delivered to the Company a Confidential Investor Questionnaire, which was included in 
the subscription package of which this Subscription Agreement was a part. 
The 
information contained such Confidential Investor Questionnaire, as completed by me and 
delivered to the Company, is complete and accurate. 
J. 
Any acquisition I make of any Units (or any Constituent Securities or any Underlying 
Shares) is solely for my own beneficial account, for investment purposes, and not with a 
view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution of Units (or any Constituent 
Securities or any Underlying Shares). I understand that none of the Units, the Constituent 
Securities and the Underlying Shares has been registered under the Securities Act or any 
securities or "blue sky" laws of any state or other jurisdiction. I have been advised and 
understand that this is based upon exemptions under the provisions thereof, which 
exemptions depend, in part, upon my investment intent and upon the truth of the 
representations made by me in this Subscription Agreement and my Confidential Investor 
Questionnaire. I understand that the Company is relying upon the acknowledgments, 
representations and agreements contained in this Subscription Agreement and my 
Confidential Investor Questionnaire (and any supplemental information) for the purpose of 
determining whether this transaction meets the requirements for such exemptionsand in 
otherwise completing the sale and issuance of Units (and of the Constituent Securities and 
any Underlying Shares) to me. 
K. 
I understand that the Units (and the Constituent Securities and any of the Underlying 
Shares) are, and for the foreseeable future will be, "restricted securities" under applicable 
federal securities laws and that the Securities Act and the rules of the SEC provide in 
substance that I may dispose of Units and Constituent Securities (and, as applicable, any 
Underlying Shares) only pursuant to an effective registration statement under the 
Securities Act or an exemption therefrom. I further understand that the Company has no 
obligation or current intention to register any Units (or any Constituent Securities or 
Underlying Shares), or to take action so as to permit sales pursuant to the Securities Act 
(including Rule 144 thereunder). Accordingly, I understand that under the SEC's rules, I 
may dispose of Units (and Constituent Securities and, as applicable, any Underlying
