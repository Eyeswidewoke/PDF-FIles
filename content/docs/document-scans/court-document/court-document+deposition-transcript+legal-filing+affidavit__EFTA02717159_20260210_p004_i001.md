(Short-term business affairs, etc.' 
1. Letter of Reason for Invitation ( See "Letter of Reason for Invitation" form (A4 size) on page 9.) 
(Note I) The letter should be addressed to the Ambassador or the Consul-General with jurisdiction over the visa 
applicant's place of residence. 
(Note 2) Column for inviting person 
Be sure to fill out the name of the company/organization as well as your title and affix, and put the 
registered seal of the representative, or non-registered seal of the company or the sub-organ(a personal 
seal is unacceptable). If it is difficult to put the seal, a person in a position of authority at the 
company/organization may put his/her signature. 
(Note 3) Column for visa applicant 
Make sure the name is written in the Latin alphabet as it appears on his/her passport. If there are two or 
more visa applicants, fill in the status of the representative applicant in the blank column and attach a list 
of all applicants. (See "List of Visa Applicants (Example)" on page 10.) 
(Note 4) Column for purpose of invitation 
Describe the purpose of visit in detail and explain the specific activities planned in Japan. (Vague 
phrases such as just "business affairs" are not appropriate.) 
(Note 5) Column for background to invitation 
Describe details about the background to invitation and the relationship between the inviting person and 
applicant(s). If the column does not have sufficient space for description, attach a separate sheet of paper 
and write "See attached sheet" in the column. 
2. Schedule of Stay (See "Schedule of Stay" form (A4 size) on page 1 I.) 
(Note) Follow the form of "Schedule of Stay (Example)" [Short-term business affairs, etc] on page I2. 
3. Letter of Guarantee (See the "Letter of Guarantee" form (A4 size) on page 13.) 
(Note I) The Letter of Guarantee may be omitted if the inviting person is in a position equivalent to or higher 
than the director of a section of a ministry, agency or office of the Japanese Central Government, or if the 
person is in a position equivalent to or higher than the head of a section of an independent administrative 
research institution of the nation or a professor/associate professor of a university, and the visa applicant is 
being invited in the course of the inviting person's work. 
(Note 2) Be sure to fill out all items on the Letter of Guarantee, as an omission of even one item or a missing seal 
is regarded the Letter of Guarantee as an incomplete form. 
(Note 3) Follow the instructions in the "Letter of Reason for Invitation". 
4. Documents on the inviting organization (For national / local government, these documents are not necessary.) 
The inviting organization, in principle, should be a corporate body, an organization or a national / local 
government. However, if, for example, a university is extending an invitation for a purpose of exchange 
under the name of a professor/associate professor, he/she is regarded as the inviting organization. 
Submit one of the following: 
(a) Certified copy of corporate register issued within the last three months 
(b) Copy of the latest edition of "Kaisha Shikiho "(quarter company journal / Japan Company Handbook ) 
(c) "Overview of Company/Organization" (See "Overview of Company/Organization" form (A4 size) on 
page 14.) 
(d) Company/organization brochure 
(Note I) When the same relevant documents as those for the last visa application have already been submitted to 
the same Embassy/Consulate-General in the same calendar year, submission of copies of those documents 
will suffice. 
(Note 2) In the case of an invitation by a person in a position equivalent to or higher than the head of a section of 
an independent administrative research institution of the nation, or a university professor/associate 
professor, submit the Certificate of Employment instead.
