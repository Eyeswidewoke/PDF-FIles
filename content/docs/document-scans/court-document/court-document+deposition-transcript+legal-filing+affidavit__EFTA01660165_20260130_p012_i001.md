and knowledge and, critically, that the shared intent and knowledge existed at the time of 
the communication in question. Absent proof beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. 
Epstein had actual knowledge that the person making a telephone call would induce or 
persuade a specific underage person during the telephone call to engage in unlawful 
sexual activity or to engage in prostitution, there can be no federal crime. 
If the telephone call in question were simply to schedule a topless massage, then 
the call lacked the essential element of inducement, persuasion, enticement, or coercion. 
If the telephone call in question was to schedule a topless massage (or even more) with a 
woman whose age was not known by Mr. Epstein to be under 18, it also fails to satisfy 
the requirements of §2422(b). If Mr. Epstein had not formed the intent to engage in 
unlawful sexual activity as of the time of the communication (even if he did form the 
intent thereafter), an essential element of the federal statute is again lacking. If the 
person making the call had knowledge or a criminal intent or belief not fully shared by 
Mr. Epstein (for example, Mr. Epstein did not know the telephone call was intended to 
induce a minor to engage in unlawful activity), the essential element of shared intent and 
shared knowledge is again lacking.1' Finally, even if there were a call to schedule a 
second meeting with someone who had previously been to the Epstein residence, this call 
lacks the necessary element of persuasion, inducement, or enticing even if the person 
receiving the call hoped or expected remuneration from the return visit. That is so 
because the statute focuses on the content of the communication, not on any quid pro quo 
that occurs thereafter at a meeting. The latter conduct is exclusively within the ambit of 
state prosecution. 
5. Other Reasons Whv 4 2422(b) Does Not Apply 
As we demonstrate above, this statute is addressed to those who purposely and 
intentionally target children. Here, there was no such targeting. As the Sixth Circuit said 
in rejecting a First Amendment challenge to the statute: "The statute only applies to those 
who 'knowingly' persuade or entice, or attempt to persuade or entice, minors. United 
States v. Bailey, 228 F.3d 637, 639 (6th Cir. 2000). See United States v. Panfil, 338 F.3d 
1° Indeed, this last problem is best illustrated by any 
call 
may claim to have made 
to solicit persons to massage Mr. Epstein. Though Ms.
e known the actual ages 
of the women whom she called at the time she called, and may therefore have known that one or 
more was in fact under 18, she was clear in speaking to detectives that she never communicated 
such information to Mr. Epstein. Rather, she understood M 
"ri wanted massages from 
women at least 18 years of age. (Video Interview of 
on October 3, 2005).
