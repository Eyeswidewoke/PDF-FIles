House against the Pakistanis today, the Karine A scandal looks like an issue that could have 
been overlooked for the greater good of Afghan stability. 
The second event that provoked the inclusion of Iran in the 'Axis of Evil' was more serious, 
as it was about the Iranian nuclear ambitions. But again, in a post-9/11 world, even if a 
regime in Tehran is often criticised in the West, the Iranians have shown that they could be 
trustworthy allies in the 'War on Terror', a struggle that was, after all, against the Sunni-
supremacist, anti-Shia organisation called Al Qaeda. In the name of this 'War on Terror', 
Washington associated itself with unsavoury dictators, in the name of realpolitik, and also, at 
another level, with countries which became nuclear powers despite American disapproval 
(Pakistan, India)55. If the US had really focused on the limited but obvious need to see this 
'War' as a fight against Osama bin Laden's organisation, its Taliban protectors, and more 
broadly speaking against what gave Al Qaeda a safe haven, i.e. chaos in Afghanistan, then 
even this revelation about the Palestine-bound consignment of weapons would not have put 
an end to the convergence of interests between the two states. Unfortunately at that time, 
Afghanistan was becoming less important, for the Bush administration, than Iraq. Middle 
Eastern geopolitics was already more important to deal with than the Afghan issue, which 
seemed to have been dealt with successfully, at least from an American point of view at that 
time. It was the time when Bush asked Jay Gamer, the first proconsul in Baghdad, if he 
wanted to do Iran after Iraq.56
Did this development mean that Afghanistan became a collateral victim of US opposition to 
Iran? With the past and the present in mind, it would be a gross misinterpretation to think so. 
Iran is, in a sense, doomed by geography: To use Afghanistan as a tool to put real pressure on 
the Americans could easily backfire on Iran. It explains why there was no real discontinuity 
in the Iranian foreign policy in the period 2001-2002. In December 2002, with this logic in 
mind, Iranians and Afghans signed a 'Good Neighbour Declaration'. It appeased the latter as 
the former made it clear that it was eager to respect Afghan territorial integrity. Between 
2001 and 2009, the humanitarian help coming into Afghanistan from Iran was also very 
important. No less than US $600 million, a generous amount for a country with its own 
financial difficulties." Economically, broadly speaking, Iran is an important factor in Afghan 
reconstruction. The Iranian government itself is funding useful projects like the building of 
63 From the beginning of the 'War on Terror', it seems that the US made the choice to prioritise their desire to 
stop Iran on the nuclear issue rather than to see Afghan stability. From the point of view of numerous 
specialists, to this day, this choice madc things more difficult for Afghanistan. Sec for example Viola
