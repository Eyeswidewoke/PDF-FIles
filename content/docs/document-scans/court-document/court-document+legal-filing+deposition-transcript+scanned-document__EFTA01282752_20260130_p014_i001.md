Mid-Market Events. If that Termination Event is an Illegality or a Force Majeure Event, 
then the Early Termination Amount will be determined in accordance with clause (I) or (2) above, 
as appropriate. except that. for the purpose of determining a Close-out Amount or Close-out 
Amounts; the Determining Puny will:—
(A) 
if obtaining quotations from one or more third patties (or from any of the 
Determining Party's Affiliates), ask each third party or Affiliate (I) not to take account of 
the current creditworthiness of the Determining Patty or any existing Credit Support 
Document and (II) to provide mid-market quotations; and 
(B) 
in any other case, use mid-market values without regard to the creditworthiness of 
the Determining Party. 
(iii) 
Acljusbnent for Bankruptcy. In circumstances where an Early Termination Date occurs because 
Automatic Early Termination applies in respect of a party, the Early Termination Amount will be subject to 
such adjustments as are appropriate and permitted by applicable law to reflect any payments or deliveries 
made by one party to the other under this Agreement (and retained by such other party) during the period 
from the relevant Early Termination Date to the date for payment determined under Section 6(d)(ii). 
(iv) 
Adjustment for Illegality or Force Majeure Event. The failure by a party or any Credit Support 
Provider of such party to pay, when due, any Early Termination Amount will not constitute an Event of 
Default under Section 5(a)(i) or 5(a)(iii)(l) if such failure is due to the occurrence of an event or 
circumstance which would, if it occurred with respect to payment, delivery or compliance related to a 
Transaction, constitute or give rise to an Illegality or a Force Majeure Event. Such amount will (1) accrue 
interest and otherwise be treated as an Unpaid Amount owing to the other party if subsequently an Early 
Termination Date results from an Event of Default, a Credit Event Upon Merger or an Additional 
Termination Event in respect of which all outstanding Transactions arc Affected Transactions and 
(2) otherwise accrue interest in accordance with Section 9(h)(iiX2). 
(v) 
Pre-Estimate. The panics agree that an amount recoverable under this Section 6(e) is a reasonable 
pre-estimate of loss and not a penalty. Such amount is payable for the loss of bargain and the loss of 
protection against future risks, and, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, neither party will be 
entitled to recover any additional damages as a consequence of the tennination of the Terminated 
Transactions. 
Set-Off Any Early Termination Amount payable to one party (the "Payee") by the other party (the 
"Payer"), in circumstances where there is a Defaulting Party or where there is one Affected Party in the case where 
either a Credit Event Upon Merger has occurred or any other Termination Event in respect of which all outstanding 
Transactions are Affected Transactions has occurred, will, at the option of the Non-defaulting Party or the Non-
affected Party, as the case may be ("X") (and without prior notice to the Defaulting Party or the Affected Party, as the 
case may be), be reduced by its set-off against any other amounts ("Other Amounts") payable by the Payee to the 
Payer (whether or not arising under this Agreement. matured or contingent and irrespective of the currency, place of 
payment or place of booking of the obligation). To the extent that any Other Amounts are so am off, those Other 
Amounts will be discharged promptly and in all respects. X will give notice to the other party of any set-off effected 
under this Section 6(0. 
For this purpose, either the Early Termination Amount or the Other Amounts (or the relevant portion of such 
amounts) may be converted by X into the currency in which the other is denominated at the rate of exchange at which 
such party would be able, in good faith and using commercially reasonable procedures, to purchase the relevant 
amount of such currency.
