GL0US12$ Gerald Ford 
Proprietary and Confidential 
As security for the payment and performance of its obligations under this Agreement (including its 
obligation to make capital contributions), each Limited Partner hereby assigns to the Partnership and the 
Partnership's assigns (including any Person to which the Partnership may assign such obligations as 
collateral for any borrowings), as a continuing security by way of first fixed charge, all of such Limited 
Partner's right, title, benefit and interest in and to such Limited Partner's interest in the Partnership. If a 
default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Partnership and the Partnership's assigns may exercise 
all the rights of a secured party under applicable law, including the power to sell or otherwise dispose of, 
for any consideration as the Partnership and the Partnership's assigns shall think fit, the whole or any part 
of such Limited Partner's interest in the Partnership. Upon request of the Partnership, and to the extent 
permitted under applicable law, each Limited Partner shall give, execute, file and record any notice, 
financing statement, continuation statement or other instrument, document or agreement that the 
Partnership or the Partnership's assigns may consider necessary or desirable to create, perfect, continue or 
validate the security interest granted hereby, or which the Partnership or the Partnership's assigns may 
consider necessary or desirable to exercise or enforce its rights hereunder with respect to such security 
interest. 
ARTICLE 7 - DISTRIBUTIONS 
7.1 
AMOUNT, TIMING AND FORM. 
7.1.1 
General. 
Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the General Partner shall determine the amount, timing 
and form (whether in cash or in kind) of all distributions made by the Partnership. 
7.1.2 
Distribution of Proceeds of Investments. 
The Partnership shall distribute, in the manner described in this Article 7 or Article I0, as the case may 
be, all cash proceeds of its investments as promptly as practicable. Notwithstanding the preceding 
sentence, the General Partner in its sole discretion may cause the Partnership to retain proceeds of 
investments for any amounts necessary to create, in the General Partner's sole discretion, reserves for the 
payment of Partnership Expenses and liabilities, to make anticipated capital contributions to the 
Underlying Fund or for any other purpose permitted under this Agreement. 
7.2 
DISCRETIONARY DISTRIBUTIONS. 
7.2.1 
General. 
Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, all distributions shall be made to and among the Partners 
pro rata in accordance with their Percentage Interests. 
The General Partner shall as necessary and in good faith adjust the amounts distributable to one or more 
Partners pursuant to this 7.2.1 to take into account (i) reserves established to pay Management Fees in 
future periods that are ultimately released or used to pay other Partnership Expenses, and (ii) other events 
or circumstances that would impact the amounts distributed to a Partner, provided that, any such 
adjustment shall, to the maximum extent possible, be intended to result in the Partners bearing the 
economic costs of the respective Management Fee attributed to them pursuant to 5.2.2.1 but otherwise 
sharing in the economic performance of the Partnership in proportion to their respective Subscriptions.
