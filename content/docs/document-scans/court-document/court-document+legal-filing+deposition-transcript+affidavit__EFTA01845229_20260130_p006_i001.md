authorizing the department to establish a system of incentives within the reentry program which the department 
may use to promote participation in rehabilitative programs and the orderly operation of institutions and facilities; 
providing that the act does not create a right to placement in the reentry program or any right to placement or 
early release under supervision of any type; providing that the act does not create a cause of action related to 
the program; directing the department to develop a system for tracking recidivism, including, but not limited to, 
rearrests and recommitment of nonviolent offenders who successfully complete the reentry program, and to 
report on recidivism in its annual report of the program; directing the department to adopt rules; providing an 
effective date. 
Be It Enacted by the Legislature of the State of Florida: 
Section 1. Nonviolent offender reentry program.—
(1) As used in this section. the term: 
(a) "Department" means the Department of Corrections. 
(b) "Nonviolent offender means an offender: 
1. Whose primary offense is a felony of the third degree; 
2. Who has never been convicted of a forcible felony as defined in s. 776.08, Florida Statutes; 
3. Who has never been convicted of any offense that requires a person to register as a sexual 
offender pursuant to s. 943.0435, Florida Statutes; and 
4. Who is not sentenced as a habitual felony offender pursuant to s. 775.084(1), Florida Statutes. 
(2)(a) The department shall develop and administer a reentry program for nonviolent offenders. The 
reentry program must include prison-based substance abuse treatment, general education development and 
adult basic education courses, vocational training, training in decision making and personal development, and 
other rehabilitation programs. 
(b) The reentry program is intended to divert nonviolent offenders from long periods of incarceration 
when a reduced period of incarceration followed by participation in intensive substance abuse treatment and 
rehabilitative programming could produce the same deterrent effect, rehabilitate the offender, and reduce 
recidivism. 
(c) The nonviolent offender shall serve at least 120 days in the reentry program. The offender may 
not count any portion of his or her sentence served before placement in the reentry program as progress toward 
program completion. 
(d) A reentry program may be operated in a secure area in or adjacent to an adult institution. 
(3)(a) The department shall screen offenders committed to the department for eligibility to participate 
in the reentry program. In order to be eligible, an offender must be a nonviolent offender, must have served at 
least one-half of his or her original sentence, and must have been identified as having a need for substance 
abuse treatment. When selecting participants for the reentry program, the department shall consider the 
offenders criminal history and the possible rehabilitative benefits that substance abuse treatment, educational 
programming, vocational training, and other rehabilitative programming might have on the offender. 
(b) If an offender meets the eligibility criteria, is selected by the department, and space is available in 
the reentry program, the department shall request the sentencing court to approve the offender's participation in 
the reentry program.
