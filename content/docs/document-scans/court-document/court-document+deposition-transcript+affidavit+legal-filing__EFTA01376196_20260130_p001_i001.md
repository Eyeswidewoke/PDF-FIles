considered "due and payable" for purposes of Section 5.1(b) until the Distribution Date on which 
such principal may be paid in accordance with the Priority of Payments. 
(c) 
Payments on the Securities shall be made with respect to a Definitive Security by 
wire transfer in immediately available funds to a Dollar account maintained by the Holder 
thereof or its nominee or, if appropriate instructions are not received at least fifteen Business 
Days prior to the relevant Distribution Date, by check delivered by first class mail, postage 
prepaid, to the address of the Holder specified in the Indenture Register. Payments on the 
Securities shall be made with respect to a Global Security by wire transfer in immediately 
available funds to a Dollar account maintained by the Depository or its nominee or, if a wire 
transfer cannot be effected, by a Dollar check in immediately available funds delivered to the 
Depository or its nominee. The Applicable Issuer expects that the Depository or its nominee, 
upon receipt of any payment on a Global Security held by the Depository or its nominee, will 
immediately credit the applicable Agent Members' accounts with payments in amounts 
proportionate to the respective beneficial interests in such Global Security as shown on the 
records of the Depository or its nominee. The Applicable Issuer also expects that payments by 
Agent Members to owners of beneficial interests in such Global Security held through Agent 
Members will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices, as is now the case 
with securities held for the accounts of customers registered in the names of nominees for such 
customers. Such payments will be the responsibility of the Agent Members. None of the Co-
Issuers, the Trustee or any Paying Agent will have any responsibility or liability for any aspects 
of the records maintained by the Depository or its nominee or any of the Agent Members relating 
to or for payments made thereby on account of beneficial interests in, a Global Security. 
As a condition to final payment due on the Stated Maturity of any Outstanding Security, 
the Holder thereof shall present and surrender such Security at the office designated by the 
Trustee; provided, however, that if there is delivered to the Co-Issuers and the Trustee such 
security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them harmless and an 
undertaking thereafter to surrender such Security, then, in the absence of notice to the Applicable 
Issuer or the Trustee that the applicable Security has been acquired by a Protected Purchaser, 
such final payment shall be made without presentation or surrender. 
(d) 
In the case where any final payment is to be made on any Security (other than on 
Stated Maturity), the Issuer or upon Issuer Order, the Trustee, in the name and at the expense of 
the Issuer shall, not more than 30 nor less than 10 days prior to the date on which such payment 
is to be made, give notice to the Holder of such Security (which in the case of an Optional 
Redemption shall be in accordance with Section 9.2), which shall state the date on which such 
payment will be made and the place or places where such Securities may be presented and 
surrendered for such payment. 
(e) 
As a condition to the payment on any Security in accordance with the Priority of 
Payments without the imposition of withholding tax, the Trustee or Paying Agent, as applicable, 
shall require certification acceptable to the Applicable Issuer, the Trustee and, if applicable, 
Paying Agent to enable each of the Applicable Issuer, the Trustee and such Paying Agent to 
determine its duties and liabilities with respect to any taxes or other charges that it may be 
required to deduct or withhold from payments in respect of such Security under any present or 
future law or regulation of the United States or other jurisdiction or any present or future law or
