Section 13.9. Settlement Rate on Automatic Exercise or Fallback Exercise. For imposes of 
Section 13.7 (Automatic Exercise) and Section 13.8 (Fallback Exercise) and determining whether Buyer

exercised pursuant to the provisions of Section 13.7 (Automatic Exercise) or Section 13.8 (Fallback 
Exercise). the Settlement Rate will be: 
(a) 
if the ISDA Settlement Matrix applies and an applicable Settlement Rate is specified in 
the ISDA Settlement Matrix, the par swap rate for swaps in the currency in which the Relevant Swap 
Transaction is denominated for a period equivalent to the remaining Term of the Relevant Swap 
Transaction which appears in the price source specified in the ISDA Settlement Matrix as of the 
Expiration Time on the Expiration Date; or 
(b) 
if (i) the ISDA Settlement Matrix applies but either an applicable Settlement Rate is not 
specified in the ISDA Settlement Matrix or such rate does not appear in the price source specified in the 
ISDA Settlement Matrix or (ii) the ISDA Settlement Matrix does not apply, the par swap rate for swaps in 
the currency in which the Relevant Swap Transaction is denominated for a period equivalent to the 
remaining Term of the Relevant Swap Transaction which appears on the relevant ISDAFIX Page as of the 
Expiration Time on the Expiration Date; or 
(c) 
if such rate does not appear on the relevant ISDAFIX Page or an ISDAFIX page is not 
available for such currency, the rate determined by Seller on the basis of the par swap rates quoted by the 
Cash Settlement Reference Banks (which, if Physical Settlement is specified to be applicable or if 
institutions arc not specified in the related Confirmation, will be five leading dealers selected by Seller in 
good faith) using the relevant Quotation Rate (or, if Physical Settlement is specified to be applicable or if 
a Quotation Rate is not specified in the related Confirmation, using -mid" as the relevant Quotation Rate), 
as of the Expiration Time on the Expiration Date (if possible) or for the Expiration Date, for swaps in the 
currency in which the Relevant Swap Transaction is denominated for a period equivalent to the remaining 
Term of the Relevant Swap Transaction and with dealers in the relevant market of the highest credit 
standing which satisfy all the credit criteria which such Cash Settlement Reference Banks apply generally 
at the time in deciding whether to offer or make an extension of credit. If five quotations arc provided as 
requested, the Settlement Rate will be calculated by eliminating the highest and lowest rates and taking 
the arithmetic mean of the remaining rates. If at least three, but fewer than five, quotations are provided, 
the Settlement Rate will be the arithmetic mean of the quotations. If fewer than three quotations are 
provided as requested, the Settlement Rate will be determined by Seller in good faith and in a 
commercially reasonable manner.
