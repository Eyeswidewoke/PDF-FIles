and reduce any unrecovered balance in such Loss Recovery Account. The 
foregoing adjustments to the Loss Recovery Accounts shall be made (on a 
cumulative basis) before the Incentive Allocation to the General Partner is 
made. In the event that a Limited Partner makes a withdrawal from a 
Capital Account with an unrecovered balance in the corresponding Loss 
Recovery Account, the unrecovered balance in such Loss Recovery 
Account shall be reduced as of the beginning of the next Fiscal Period by 
an amount equal to the product obtained by multiplying the balance in 
such Loss Recovery Account by a fraction, the numerator of which is the 
amount of the withdrawal made by such Limited Partner as of the last day 
of the prior Fiscal Period and the denominator of which is the balance in 
such Capital Account on the last day of the prior Fiscal Period (prior to the 
withdrawal made by the Limited Partner as of the last day of the Fiscal 
Period). Additional capital contributions shall not affect the balance of 
any Loss Recovery Account. 
(5) 
The General Partner may reduce, modify or waive the Incentive 
Allocation from time to time in its discretion with respect to one or more 
Limited Partners without notice to or the consent of the other Limited 
Partners. The General Partner may also share the Incentive Allocation 
with one or more other Partners. 
(6) 
The computations and procedures required to effect the 
adjustments, allocations and other matters provided for in this Section 3.3, 
including, without limitation, any accounting procedures used to 
implement such adjustments, allocations and other matters, shall be made 
in such reasonable manner as the General Partner in good faith shall 
determine to be appropriate. Without limiting the foregoing, in effecting 
such adjustments, allocations, and other matters for any Fiscal Period, the 
General Partner may in its sole discretion rely upon unaudited financial 
statements and such other computations, if any, as it determines. 
(b) 
The amount of any withdrawal made by a Partner pursuant to Section 4.2 
below during such Fiscal Period shall be debited against such Partner's Capital Account. 
3.4 
Allocation of Income and Loss for Income Tax Purposes. 
(a) 
The income, deductions, gains, losses and credits of the Partnership shall 
be allocated for federal, state and local income tax purposes by the General Partner among the 
persons who were Partners during the relevant Taxable Year. For purposes of determining the 
share of any items allocated to any period during the relevant Taxable Year of the Partnership, 
such shares shall be determined by the General Partner using any method permitted by the 
Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (as amended, the "Code") and the regulations thereunder. The 
General Partner shall make all allocations taking into account the Partners' Capital Accounts on 
the first day of the Taxable Year and distributive shares of Net Gain or Net Loss for such year, 
any entry of new Partners, any distributions by the Partnership, any contributions to or 
withdrawals from Capital Accounts and the difference between income for tax purposes and
