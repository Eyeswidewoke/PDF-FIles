trust, while in the possession of my Trustees, be liable for any debts, contracts, obligations, or 
undertakings of such Beneficiaries, voluntary or involuntary, or for any claims or judgments 
against any Beneficiary. including claims for alimony or for the support of any Beneficiary's 
spouse or children, or for reimbursement of a federal, state or local government, or any agency 
of any federal, state, or local government, for the support of any Beneficiary hereunder, prior to 
the time such money or assets are actually paid or distributed to such Beneficiary. Any 
attempted pledge, assignment, transfer, gift, conveyance, hypothecation, anticipation, charge, 
or encumbrance of any money or assets (either income or principal) payable or distributable 
under the provisions of this Agreement by any of the Beneficiaries hereunder prior to the time 
such money or assets are actually paid or distributed to such Beneficiary shall be null and void 
and shall not be recognized by my Trustees. This Section 5.5 of Article V shall not apply to 
me. 
Section 5.6. - Limitation on Distributions 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no discretionary distribution of 
income or principal of any trust hereunder shall be applied to pay for medical care, residential 
facilities, or any other care or service that would otherwise be provided for any Beneficiary 
hereunder by any federal, state, or other governmental agency; and no such discretionary 
distribution of income or principal shall be made for reimbursement for any such care, facilities 
or services previously provided. Before making any discretionary payment to or for the benefit 
of any such Beneficiary hereunder, my Trustees shall consider the amounts such Beneficiary is 
or may be entitled to receive from any governmental agency for such care, facilities, or 
services. If such amounts are available, discretionary distributions of income and principal 
from any trust hereunder shall be made only to supplement such amounts, and to provide 
liberally for needs and comforts over and above the basic maintenance, support, and medical 
care that may be paid for by any such agency. 
Section 5.7. - Division and Combination of Trusts 
A. 
For any administrative, tax or other purpose determined by my Trustees 
to be in the best interests of any Beneficiary (including any remainderman) hereunder, my 
Trustees may at any time and from time to time (whether before or after funding), without 
approval of any court, divide any trust under this Agreement into two or more separate trusts or 
combine two or more trusts with substantially identical terms (whether or not such trusts 
resulted from division of a prior trust). 
B. 
If property is directed to be added to any trust hereunder (the "Original 
Trust"), whether by the terms of this Agreement any other agreement, or the Will of any 
person, my Trustees may hold such property as one or more separate trusts on terms identical 
to the terms of the Original Trust. My Trustees may allocate such property among the separate 
trusts (if any) into which the Original Trust was divided, whether or not pro-rata, using 
specific assets or undivided interests therein (including allocation of all such property to one of 
such separate trusts). 
C. 
Any time during the existence of separate trusts created by division of a 
trust hereunder, my Trustees may exercise all discretionary powers differently with respect to 
the separate trusts and take all other actions consistent with such trusts being separate entities.
