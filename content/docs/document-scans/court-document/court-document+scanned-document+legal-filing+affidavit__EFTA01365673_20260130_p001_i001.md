(i) 
the Trustee determines that the anticipated proceeds of a sale or 
liquidation of the Collateral (after deducting the reasonable expenses of such sale 
or liquidation) would be sufficient to discharge in full the amounts then due (or, in 
the case of interest, accrued) and unpaid on the Senior Notes for principal and 
interest (including Deferred Interest), and all amounts payable prior to payment of 
principal on such Senior Notes pursuant to the Priority of Payments and the 
Requisite Noteholders and the Collateral Manager agree with such determination; 
or 
(ii) 
a Majority of each Class of Senior Notes Outstanding directs the 
sale and liquidation of the Collateral. 
The Trustee shall give written notice of the retention of the Collateral to the Issuer 
with a copy to the Co-Issuer and the Collateral Manager. So long as such Event of Default is 
continuing, any such retention pursuant to this Section 5.5(a) may be rescinded at any time when 
the conditions specified in clause (i) or (ii) exist. 
(b) 
Nothing contained in Section 5.5(a) shall be construed to require the 
Trustee to sell the Collateral securing the Notes if the conditions set forth in clause (i) or (ii) of 
Section 5.5(a) are not satisfied. Nothing contained in Section 5.5(a) shall be construed to require 
the Trustee to preserve the Collateral securing the Notes if prohibited by applicable law. 
(c) 
In determining whether the condition specified in Section 5.5(aXi) exists, 
the Trustee shall obtain bid prices with respect to each security contained in the Collateral from 
two nationally recognized dealers (as specified by the Collateral Manager in writing) at the time 
making a market in such securities and shall compute the anticipated proceeds of sale or 
liquidation on the basis of the lower of such bid prices for each such security. For the purposes 
of making the determinations required pursuant to Section 5.5(aXi), the Trustee shall apply the 
standards set forth in Section 6.3(cXi) or (ii). In addition, for the purposes of determining issues 
relating to the execution of a sale or liquidation of the Collateral and the execution of a sale or 
other liquidation thereof in connection with a determination whether the condition specified in 
Section 5.5(aXi) exists, the Trustee may retain and rely on an opinion of an Independent 
investment banking firm of national reputation. 
The Trustee shall deliver to the Noteholders and the Collateral Manager a report 
stating the results of any determination required pursuant to Section 5.5(a)(i) no later than 10 
days after any sale or liquidation of the Collateral. The Trustee shall make the determinations 
required by Section 5.5(aXi) within 30 days after an Event of Default and at the request of the 
Requisite Noteholders at any time during which the Trustee retains the Collateral pursuant to 
Section 5.5(a)(i). 
Section 5.6 
Trustee May Enforce Claims Without Possession of Notes. 
All rights of action and claims under this Indenture or under any of the Notes may 
be prosecuted and enforced by the Trustee without the possession of any of the Notes or the 
production thereof in any trial or other Proceeding relating thereto, and any such action or 
Proceeding instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in its own name as trustee of an express 
trust, and any recovery of judgment shall be applied as set forth in Section 5.7 hereof.
