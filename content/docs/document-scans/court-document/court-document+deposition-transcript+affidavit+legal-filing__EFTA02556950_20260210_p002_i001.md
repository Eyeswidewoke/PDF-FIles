I am not sure what I can give you in exchange at the mo=ent cause apparently you are not keen 
anymore on meeting other girlfriends=or maybe. Wait, my best French friend 
was accepted to Columbia La= in NY, 
she is moving there in in August, if you are interested in mee=ing a French brilliant almost lawyer 
here it is* 
Dear Head of Summer Clerkship Recruitment, 
=div>l write this letter in support of my application for a summer clerkshi= with your law firm. 
I am currently pursu=ng a furls Doctor at the University of New South Wales which I will comple=e in 
November 2013. I also hold a Bachelor in International Commercial Law=which I obtained from the University of Paris 1 
Sorbonne in 2011. 
Having worked at 
, I believe tha= Baker & McKenzie will be a great fit as I aspire to 
do be a leading=and competent lawyer in dispute resolution. This is because I appreciate t=e advantages of working for 
a big firm with its connection of global lawye=s and expertise in a world where boundaries, though they have appeared 
s=aller, have in many ways become more pronounced as local laws compete wi=h global initiatives. A global firm like 
Baker & McKenzie can help s=ape the boundaries of law, and I hope to be part of the process. 
At 
I have acquired practical s=ills mostly in commercial and international law and 
was sometimes involved=in dispute resolution. I learnt how to draft legal documents such as contr=cts, conclusions, 
shareholders' agreements and memorandums of understa=ding. I found the area of Commercial law fascinating but 
would like to dee=en my knowledge in dispute resolution as well as the other practice areas =f your firm. I will be 
honored to be able to contribute with my knowledge =o your law firm. 
I do not say it lightly when I describe myself as a har=workin out oin and ositive erson with a drive 
and passion for excel=ence. These qualities helped me to represen 
Sport has taught 
me discipline, patience and determination and also=2C in order to contribute effectively, it shows me that it is crucial 
to=be a team player. I am particularly excited that your firm openly states t=at Summer Clerks will get involved in real 
work right from the start. This=is exactly what I am looking for. 
As a High school student I was always keen on debating =nd public speaking. So law naturally attracts 
me. Being an attorney will a=low me to pursue my drives and additionally, as an athlete, I consider=that representing my 
client and arguing in court will have some similariti=s of sort in a sporting competition in which using the correct 
strategies=2C not least complex and precise, and stamina, both physical and menta=, are all part of the package. I am 
certain that the Summer Clerkship at=your law firm will allow me to grow in the right direction. 
I have travelled extensively and I have studied in fore=gn universities as well as completed several legal 
internships. My experie=ces thus far have given me a unique insight and maturity despite my youth.=I believe that Baker 
& McKenzie will offer me an opportunity to cont=nue to pursue excellence, just the way your firm is noted for. 
I would truly appreciate the chance to discuss a Summer Clerkship furt=er during an interview with you.
