HUBUS133 Alpha Group Capital 
withdrawal requests (including for this purpose, withdrawal requests that are not Key 
Person Withdrawal Requests) are received for any Withdrawal Date which would give 
rise to aggregate withdrawal proceeds in an amount greater than the Partnership Gate (as 
defined below) times the net asset value of the Partnership as of such date, the General 
Partner may, upon consultation with the Management Company, (i) satisfy all such Key 
Person Withdrawal Requests or (ii) reduce all Key Person Withdrawal Requests 
rata 
so that only the Partnership Gate times the net asset value of the Partnership as of the 
Withdrawal Date is withdrawn (35%, or such higher percentage as is determined by the 
General Partner, with the consent of the Management Company, being referred to as the 
"Partnership Gate"). 
(g) if the Partnership Gate is triggered with respect to a Withdrawal Date 
occurring during the Key Person Withdrawal Period, then, except as described below, the 
Partnership shall satisfy the withdrawal requests received for such Withdrawal Date as 
follows: (a) if a Key Person Withdrawal Request from any Limited Partner received for 
such Withdrawal Date is equal to or less than the Partnership Gate times the net asset 
value of such Limited Partner's Capital Account as of such date, the General Partner shall 
fully satisfy such withdrawal request; and (b) if a Key Person Withdrawal Request from 
any Limited Partner received for such Withdrawal Date is greater than the Partnership 
Gate times the net asset value of such Limited Partner's Capital Account as of such date, 
the General Partner shall reduce such withdrawal request so that only the Partnership 
Gate times the net asset value of such Limited Partner's Capital Account is withdrawn as 
of such Withdrawal Date. If after application of (a) and (b), there remains additional 
amounts that can be withdrawn as a result of the Partnership Gate (such remaining 
amount, the "Unused Gate Amount," and the quotient resulting from dividing the Unused 
Gate Amount by the net asset value of the Partnership being referred to as the 
"Remaining Gate Percentage"), then any Limited Partner's unsatisfied Key Person 
Withdrawal Requests shall be satisfied up to an amount equal to the Remaining Gate 
Percentage times the net asset value of the unsatisfied portion of such Limited Partner's 
Capital Account. The procedure set forth in this paragraph shall be repeated until there 
are no additional amounts which can be withdrawn as a result of the Partnership Gate. 
(h) For purposes of measuring the applicability of the Partnership Gate to 
a Limited Partner's initial Key Person Withdrawal Request that falls on a month-end 
other than a calendar quarter-end, the Partnership shall aggregate withdrawal requests for 
(i) such month-end, (ii) the Withdrawal Date relating to the calendar quarter-end 
immediately preceding such month-end and (iii) the prior month-end if the relevant 
month-end falls on the second month of the quarter. 
(i) If a Limited Partner submits a Key Person Withdrawal Request, but 
such Key Person Withdrawal Request is not fully satisfied, such Limited Partner shall be 
required to submit a separate Key Person Withdrawal Request for the next Withdrawal 
Date as of which it wishes to withdraw additional portions of its Capital Account. 
Unsatisfied Key Person Withdrawal Requests shall not be entitled to any priority on 
subsequent Withdrawal Dates and shall be further subject to the gate provisions and any 
other applicable limitation. Unsatisfied portions of any Key Person Withdrawal Request 
shall continue to be at risk of the Partnership's business (although a Key Person
