riddled with bullets. And then, most recently, a Congressman berates a park ranger for monitoring the closure of=a 
national park he had voted to close. It is more than likely that histori=ns years from now will cite this incident as the 
perfect illustration of Ameri=an politics in the early 21st century. For it is this disjunction, this dislocation from reality, 
that represents our age. Politics have been do=inated by a minority movement that creates its own counter-reality, 
rejects scienc=, denies established facts, and produces untruthful narratives to justify behavior at odds with reality. 
This could all be dis=issed as an aberration and an amusement, except when it brings the government of the 
United States to a standstill. This Congressman, and others like him, did not connect the decision to shutter the 
government with the closure of national parks administered by that government. Nor apparentl= did they think a 
majority of Americans would be outraged by young cancer patients being denied treatment= or veterans losing 
medication, or the elderly losing home nutrition, or any of hundreds of things the government of the United States, as 
ordered by Congr=ss, does every day. 
If you live in a vacuum-packed world=of talk radio, right-wing dominated town halls, and campaigns financed by 
anti-government billionaires, and if that's the only Kool-Aid you drink, it must be a s=ock when you confront the real 
world. "Why is this park closed?" &=uot;Because you closed it, Congressman." 
If th= "big government" you oppose is not the one that creates and operates revered national monuments, but 
is one that provi=es food stamps, unemployment compensation, breakfasts for poor school children= and rent subsidies 
and you can't actually say that's what you are a=ainst, because you believe, wrongly, that it's mostly people with darker 
skins=who benefit, it makes real-world politics difficult to deal with. 
So what's a Congressman operating in a closed-circuit vacuum, who only hears his own echoes 24/7, to do? 
What does he do when he finds out that his gerrymandered solid red district dominated by a minority=is neither the real 
America nor the real world? You intimidate your Speaker an= you threaten -- or more likely have others threaten -- your 
wavering, moder=te colleagues with a primary campaign by a fire-breathing, alternative-reality version of yourself. 
There is only one way three or =our dozen alternative-reality Congresspersons can shut down the United States 
governm=nt: fear. Fear of what? Fear of not being a Congressperson. Fear of losing your job. Fear of not having a staff to 
look after your every wish. Fear of not being cheered at the next town meeting composed of people you're alread= 
afraid of. Most of all, fear of returning to everyday life back home. But, of cour=e, there is always the lucrative 
alternative of lobbying, where you can stay i= Washington, go to all the parties and fundraisers, write the checks 
instead=of taking the checks, and hobnob with all those other former members of Congre=s who, like you, decided not 
to go home. 
But even tha= little promise of nirvana is subject to the perpetuation of the world of alternative-reality. And that 
world must come =o an end. Because the day will come, sooner or later, when men and women of stature, honor, and 
conviction will say, as Joseph Welch said to Joe McCart=y and the park ranger should have said to our Congressman: 
"Have you no sense of decency, sir? At long last, have you no sense of decency?"
