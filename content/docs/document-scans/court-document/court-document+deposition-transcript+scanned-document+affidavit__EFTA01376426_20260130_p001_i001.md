respect to any Pledged Obligation on its Due Date, (a) the Trustee shall promptly notify the 
Issuer and the Collateral Manager in writing and (b) unless within three Business Days (or the

shall have been received by the Trustee, or the Issuer, in its absolute discretion (but only to the 
extent permitted by Section 10.2(a), shall have made provision for such payment satisfactory to 
the Trustee in accordance with Section 10.2(a), the Trustee shall request the Obligor of such 
Pledged Obligation, the trustee under the related Reference Instrument or paying agent 
designated by either of them, as the case may be, to make such payment as soon as practicable 
after such request but in no event later than three Business Days after the date of such request. In 
the event that such payment is not made within such time period, the Trustee, subject to the 
provisions of clause (iv) of Section 6.1(c), shall take such action as the Collateral Manager shall 
direct in writing. Any such action shall be without prejudice to any right to claim a Default or 
Event of Default under this Indenture. In the event that the Issuer or the Collateral Manager

Article 12 of this Indenture, as the case may be. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, the 
Trustee shall deliver to the Issuer or its designee any payment with respect to any Pledged 
Obligation received after the Due Date thereof to the extent the Issuer previously made 
provisions for such payment satisfactory to the Trustee in accordance with this Section 6.13 and 
such payment shall not be deemed part of the Collateral. 
Section 6.14 Authenticating Agents. 
Upon the request of the Co-Issuers, the Trustee shall, and if the Trustee so 
chooses the Trustee may, appoint one or more Authenticating Agents with power to act on its 
behalf and subject to its direction in the authentication of Securities in connection with issuance, 
transfers and exchanges under Sections 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7 and 8.5, as fully to all intents and 
purposes as though each such Authenticating Agent had been expressly authorized by such 
Sections to authenticate such Securities. The Trustee shall provide written notice of such 
appointment to the Co-Issuers (with a copy to the Collateral Manager). For all purposes of this 
Indenture, the authentication of Securities by an Authenticating Agent pursuant to this Section 
6.14 shall be deemed to be the authentication of Securities "by the Trustee."
