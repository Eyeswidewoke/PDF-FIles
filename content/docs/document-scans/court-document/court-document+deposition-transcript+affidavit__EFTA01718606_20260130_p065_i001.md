violative of his Due Process rights. Funhermore. the thet that the statute at issue in this matter 
does not connect harm to the minimum amount available to the victim and simply includes a 
lump sum exacerbates the potential for injustice and an abridgement of Mr. lipstein's rights. At 
the very least. Mr. Epstein should be given. the right to know the identity of the victims and the 
evidence upon which each one was identified as a victim by the government. 
The USAO has provided no information us to the specific claims that were made by each 
identified individual, nor were we given the names or ages of the individuals or the time frame 
of the alleged conduct at issue. The USAO's reluctance to provide Mr. Epstein with any 
information regarding the allegations against him leaves wide open the opportunity Ibr 
misconduct by the federal investigators and eliminates the ability lbr Mr. Epstein and/or his 
agents to verily that the allegations at issue are grounded in factual assertions and real evidence. 
Indeed, the requirement that a target of federal criminal prosecution agree to waive his right to 
contest liability as to unnamed civil complainants creates at minimum an cite: rums of injustice, 
both because of the obvious Due Process concerns of waiving rights without notice of even the 
identity of the complainant and because of the involvement anise federal criminal justice system 
in civil settlements between private individuals. We reaffirm the right to test the veracity of the 
victims' claims as provided to us in the letter from you to Judge Davis dated October 25. 2007. 
II has recently wine to our attention that you staff has identified 
as a 
"victim" for purposes of Section 2255 relict Ms. 
who initially 
repeate y refused to 
cooperate with federal authorities during the course of t the investigation, only submitted to an 
interview after she was conferred with a grunt of immunity. &wet this is not a demand typically 
ii 
ri
made by someone who is a crime 
' 
e rn". Moreover, Ms. 
sworn testimony does not 
suggest that she is a victim. Ms. 
has not only admitte tat she lied to Mr. Epstein about 
her age claiming she was 18 years old. but that she counseled others to lie to Mr. Epstein in the 
same manner. Ms. 
also states that Mr. Epstein was clear with her that he was only 
interested in "women w to were of age and that most of the youn . women she brought to his 
home were indeed over IX years ant. Moreover. while Ms. 
claims to have provided 
mita-sages to Mr. Epstein. she does not allege to have engaged in sexual intercourse with Mr. 
Epstein: does not claim she provided him with oral sex: does not purport that Mr. Epstein 
penetrated her in any manner. denies Mr. Epstein ever used a vibrator, massager. or any type of 
"sex toy" on her: denies he touched her breasts. buttocks, or vagina; and states that she never 
touched Mr. Epstein's sexual organs — nor 
c asked to du so by Mr. Epstein. Without a 
right to contest the liability of claims. Ms. 
will likely receive Ihr more in civil damages 
than what would he she would have had Mr. spstein been convicted. 
In addition, the Agreement with the MAO only defers federal prosecution of Mr. 
Epstein: it does not assert a declination to prosecute. as was lirst contemplated in the negotiation 
of the Agreement. Any payments made and/or settlement agreements reached with the alleged
