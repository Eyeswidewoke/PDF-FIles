My name is Ada= Waldman, and I am Professor Lawrence Krauss' litigation 
counsel.&n=sp; Earlier this week, I sent the attached letter to Buzzfeed via one of th=ir reporters named Peter Aldhous. 
</=iv> 
I am also in receipt of Mr. Aldhous' letter to A=U, which is a variation on 
defamation — both libel and slander Q=93 that Mr. Aldhous and his colleagues have been manufacturing for at least=6 
months (notably without any reporting) in a campaign with a purpose known=only to them. Buzzfeed's first method is 
to call or write thi=d parties, posit a list of fake, anonymous, recklessly false and malicious 40=804>allegations," and ask 
if the third party has anything to add.&=bsp; Buzzfeed's second method is to seek tortious interference with=Professor 
Krauss' professional contracts, by writing third parties w=th whom Professor Krauss is in privity, present a similarly 
inflammatory se=ies of anonymous, recklessly false and malicious accusations, and then ques=ion: how can the email's 
recipient allow such a person to serve on t=eir board, or speak at their conference? The letter from Buzzfeed to t=e 
University falls into both categories. There will be appropriate legal co=sequences for Buzzfeed's actions. 
<=div> 
It is my understanding that your office believes it is=compelled by the above to 
investigate false, defamatory, anonymous accusati=ns posited by the online tabloid Buzzfeed by contacting third parties 
and p=tentially rebroadcasting the tabloid Buzzfeed's accusations. T= be clear, these accusations were not made to the 
University by actual huma= beings who are alleging they were victims. There is no evidence they=were presented to 
Buzzfeed by actual human beings. Moreover, no present or f=rmer employees of ASU have made any such allegations to 
your office, or to a=y office at ASU, to our knowledge. They are simply alleged by a tabloid, an= one that had yet 
published a "story" on the topic when they forwar=ed these to you. You may propose to rebroadcast this tabloid's libel 
t= other third parties who have also made no accusation against Professor Kra=ss. I suggest that you consult with the 
University's counsel b=fore taking so rash a step as re-broadcasting hearsay defamation that came t= you via an online 
tabloid under these circumstances.<=div> 
Professor Krauss and I both recognize the absolu=e need to investigate real 
allegations. Some of the women who have br=vely come forward with personal harassment allegations against Harvey 
Weinstein are my clients and friends. Some of these victims have been advis=d by me. Those actual allegations are 
entirely distinct from a tabloi= attempting to manufacture allegations to create harm. =u> 
<=iv>
