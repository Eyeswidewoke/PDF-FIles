The result after using the Hamiltonian constraint is 
—ciz
enid = eta
We note that this is different from the phase velocity computed above. 
It also differs from the result [14] 
(73)

so whether there is an energy dependent speed of light at the classical level does indeed depend 
on the definition of time used. 
5 Redefining locality 
It is clear to begin with that the usual principle of locality cannot be realized in a quantum theory 
which includes the commutation relations (4). What then must be investigated is whether the no-
tion of locality can be relaxed sufficiently to incorporate (4) while remaining sufficiently restrictive 
that it is not ruled out by our existing store of knowledge. In this section we make such a proposal 
and argue that it is narrow enough to not yet have been ruled out by experiment. 
In the following we we restrict ourselves to the context in which the paradoxes of locality 
originally presents the paradox, which is the classical dynamics of worldlines of free relativistic 
particles. We will consider cases where three or more world-lines intersect at an event, because 
unless the outgoing states are different from the incoming states we cannot say that an interaction 
has taken place. We thus consider a class of events involving N ≥ 3 particles in which one inertial 
observer, named Alice, sees all N worldlines to intersect at a single point, E°. For example, two 
of them may be incoming states and two of them outgoing, in which case N = 4. Alice will then 
explain the fact that the particles scattered, exchanging energy and momentum, as caused by the 
two incoming particles's worldlines having intersected. 
However, if DS R is in fact observer independent, then another intertial observer, Bob, must 
observe that the scattering take place as well. However, because of the energy and momentum 
dependence of the Lorentz transfomrations, Bob may see four worldlines that never intersect. In-
stead, the event E° has been split into four events. Bob will be forced to describe the history 
Alice sees as one in which there are two incoming particles which exchanged energy and momen-
tum and became two outgoing particles without any of the four worldlines intersecting. Thus it 
would appear that observer independence requires that we believe that physical interactions are 
non-local. 
But if any two non-insetting worldlines can exchange energy and momentum, generating two 
outgoing worldlines, which intersect neither with each other, nor with the incoming worldlines, 
then it would seem that any two particles in nature can interact with the same probalities of those 
whose worldlines intersect. So physics becomes completely non-local. This is the catastrophe 
claimed in [6]. 
But we should be careful before jumping to this conclusion. What is true is that the concept 
of locality has to be altered to allow for the observer dependence of the notion that worldlines 
coincide in spacetime. But this need not imply that the notion of locality becomes so weakened 
that they theory can be ruled out by our store of observations that we usually take to support
