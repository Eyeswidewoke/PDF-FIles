Unable to get work as a house manager elsewhere in South Florida. he says, Rodriguez later tried to sell this 
"golden nugget"—his term—for $50,000, to be used in the victims' civil suits. Unfortunately, he made the offer 
to an undercover cop, and was subsequently charged with "obstruction of official proceedings" for withholding 
information that could have advanced the criminal investigation of Epstein—which by that point had been 
settled in a plea deal. Rodriguez was sentenced to 18 months in federal prison (Epstein was allowed to serve 13 
months in the Palm Beach county 'ail), and now awaits an additional sentence on Aug. 24 in federal court in 
Miami for transporting firearMC

In a deposition gi% en ibr the civil suits. Rodriguez testified that lie was instructed to alwa 
v 
2 000 in cash 
on hand, so that he could pay both the girls who gave massages and recruiters such as 
who 
brought them to the house. He also testified that Epstein made large contributions to the Palm Beach Police 
Department, and in return was given PBPD baseball hats to put on the dashboard of his various cars to avoid 
being stopped or ticketed by local police. Retired Police Chief Michael Reiter. in his own deposition, 
acknowledged that, in addition to earlier donations to the police department (which are fairly common in well-
heeled Palm Beach), Epstein had recently given the department $100,000 for some sophisticated equipment. 
The police were still researching the purchase when Epstein came under suspicion, and Reiter ordered the 
money returned. (Guy Frostin, one of Epstein's local attorneys, told police that Epstein also gave $100,000 to 
the Florida Ballet for massages. because he was "very passionate" about massages being "therapeutically and 
spiritually" beneficial. Yet victims told police the had no massage training.) 
Perhaps most disturbing, "terms of possible sex trafficking. was Epstein's relationship with Jean Luc Brnel, 
owner of the N1C2 
tigentt . According to a complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southeriil 
District of Florida, an ined victim said that Epstein, Maxwell, Brunel, Rodriguez, and 
"deliberately engaged in a pattern of racketeering that involved luring minor children through MC2, most 
girls under the age of 17. to catnip sexual play formougyaniNcit.mmtit mourn to traffickiug.) 
Brunel is a 50-plus French playboy who was formerly part owner of Karin, a Paris-based modeling agency. He 
lives in New York and South Beach, Florida. and owns 85 percent of MC2, which has offices in New York, 
Miami, and Tel Aviv. (The remaining 15 percent is owned by his partner. Jeff Fuller.) Brunel has been observed 
as a house guest at Epstein's Palm Beach home and may well have had contact with him also in New York, 
where Epstein owns a lavish home, and in Paris, where Epstein keeps an apartment on elegant Ave. Foch. 
CBS reporter Craig Pycs, who investigated Brunel for a 60 Minutes broadcast many years ago, is quoted in 
Michael Gross' book about the modeling industry, ,Vr, hi. The 
Ninon 
Beautifitl Women. Pyes told the 
author that Brunel "ranks among the sleaziest people in the fashion industr . We're talking about a conveyor 
belt, not a casting couch. Hundreds or girls were not onlc harassed but molested." Now The Daily Beast has 
learned than Epstein had made a SI million wire transfer to Brunet's offshore bank account in September 2004,
