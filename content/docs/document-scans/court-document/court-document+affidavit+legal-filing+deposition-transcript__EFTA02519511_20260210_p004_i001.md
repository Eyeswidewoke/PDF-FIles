Dear Keith: 
I am very concerned by your letter, =ndicating your actions and requests, a number of 
which seem both =nappropriate and unprofessional. I understand your shock and =oncern upon seeing the Buzzfeed 
story but I believe your response was =nappropriate for a number of reasons. Let me outline them: 
1. In December Buzzfeed =ontacted my University and me with almost everything that 
was in =he story. I provided counter-evidence including information from =SU and ANU, another University I am 
affiliated with that investigated =he Australia allegation. As a result of this I received a note =rom Buzzfeed that they 
were not publishing the story. Buzzfeed =ontinued to pester my institution for information, but as there was =one, and 
as essentially the entire story is false ( the =ounter-evidence we provided is not included in the story) there was no 
=xpectation that a story would appear. I had in fact related my =oncerns about Buzzfeed to Rachel Bronson in 
November, which prepared =er for the slanderous call she received from them shortly after making =alse claims and 
asking why she allowed me to be associated with the =ulletin. She understood that the allegations were false and had 
been =ealt with. Moreover, a lawyer who I had contracted because of concerns =bout Buzzfeed had prepared and sent a 
cease and desist letter to them =o stop their harassment. We had no expectation that they would =ublish false stories 
after being informed that they were false, and for =11 of these reasons it would have been inappropriate to bring this 
=ersonal matter up to you or your organization at the time. =nbsp; 
2. I =m very disappointed that you decided to send a letter to all =articipants about this 
without consulting me or my staff. This was =nprofessional as well as being discourteous to both me, my Origins 
=olleagues, the ASU Origins Project itself, and all of the =orkshop participants. What you have effectively done is to 
=ropagate what we believe was slander to a broader audience, and without =ny substantiation was extremely 
inappropriate for you to do in the =ontext of your position as a representative of the Stanley Foundation, =ndependent 
of any personal anger you may felt. It would have =een appropriate to consult us first. It is unprofessional to =espond 
personally in the heat of anger, and any decision about this =hould have waited till calmer heads prevailed. 
3. Your reaction regarding the workshop =s also of some concern here. Allegation, and 
indeed allegation by =uzzfeed of all places, is just that. There should not only be a =resumption of innocence but you 
should note that all organizations that =ave looked at these claims, including ASU and the Origins Project, have 
=ismissed them. ASU was aware of all the allegations and chose to take =o action because there was no evidence. I am 
saddened that you, =n behalf of your organization acted so rashly as to email participants, =nd now want to remove 
Stanley's name from an event that everyone =nvolved felt was professional and wonderful and had nothing at all to =o 
with the Buzzfeed story. You are essentially impugning the =rigins Project and ASU because of your concerns about me, 
valid or =ot. And for your information, I have never been accused or found =n violation of sexual harassment regulations
