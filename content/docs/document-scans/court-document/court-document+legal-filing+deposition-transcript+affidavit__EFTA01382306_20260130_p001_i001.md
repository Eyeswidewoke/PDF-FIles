Amendment No. 3 to Form S-1 
Table of Contents 
of the company, which assumes that all of the AB Acquisition entities are taxable as a group for federal and state income 
tax purposes effective February 21, 2014. 
Unaudited Pro Fonna Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet 
(b) 
As part of the IPO-Related Transactions, all of our operating subsidiaries will become subsidiaries of Albertsons 
Companies, Inc., a Delaware corporation. The pro forma adjustments to members' equity and stockholders' equity 
represent the creation of share capital, paid in capital and retained earnings upon the corporate reorganization and the 
elimination of the historical membership equity. Upon the corporate reorganization, the outstanding units will be exchanged 
into 409,832,959 shares of common stock. 
4. Pro Forma Adjustments for IPO Transactions 
Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Statement of Continuing Operations 
(a) 
The pro forma adjustment to Interest expense, net represents the decrease to pro forma interest expense related to the 
application of $1,531 million of the net proceeds to us from the sale of such shares to repay certain indebtedness as 
described in 'Use of Proceeds" as if these events had occurred on February 21, 2014, the first day of fiscal 2014. The 
interest expense included in the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information reflects a weighted 
average interest rate of 7.90% (including amortization of debt discounts and deferred financing costs). 
(b) 
Pro forma Net loss per weighted average basic and diluted shares outstanding gives effect to the exchange of all our 
outstanding units into shares of our common stock as part of the IPO-Related Transactions and the issuance of 65,306,122 
shares in this offering, based on an assumed initial public offering price of $24.50 per share (the midpoint of the price range 
set forth on the cover of this prospectus). 
(c) 
The pro forma adjustment to Income tax (benefit) expense is derived by applying a combined federal and state statutory tax 
rate of 38.7% to the pro forma adjustment to interest expense. 
No adjustment has been made to the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statement of continuing operations to reflect 
(a) the estimated $68.5 million loss on early extinguishment of debt, including the write off of deferred financing costs and debt discounts 
as these amounts are non-recurring charges incurred as a result of the repayment of certain debts, or (b) the Anticipated Refinancing. 
Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet 
The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet of AB Acquisition does not give effect to the Anticipated 
Refinancing, but reflects the Transactions, including the pro forma effects of the issuance of shares of common stock and the application 
of $1,531 million of the net proceeds from the sale of such shares to repay certain indebtedness as described in "Use of Proceeds" 
(excluding the remaining shares of common stock being issued in this offering) as if these events had occurred on June 20, 2015, as 
follows: 
(d) 
The pro forma adjustment to Accounts payable and accrued liabilities represents the payment of accrued interest in 
connection with the repayment of certain existing debt.
