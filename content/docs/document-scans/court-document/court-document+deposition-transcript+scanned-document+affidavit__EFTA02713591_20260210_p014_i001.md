If a Limited Partner withdraws any capital from a Capital Account prior to the day immediately 
preceding the one-year anniversary of the contribution of such capital to the Partnership, such 
withdrawal will be subject to an early withdrawal charge for the benefit of the Partnership equal 
to 4% of the net asset value of the capital being withdrawn ("Early Withdrawal Charge"). 
Withdrawals will be deemed made on a first-in, first-out basis for this purpose. Any of these 
conditions may be waived in full or in part by the General Partner from time to time in its sole 
discretion with respect to one or more Limited Partners, without notice to or the consent of the 
other Limited Partners. 
(b) 
A Limited Partner must provide irrevocable written notice to the General 
Partner of his desire to make a withdrawal as of a Withdrawal Date at least forty-five (45) days 
prior to such Withdrawal Date. The above notice period may be waived in whole or in part by 
the General Partner in its sole discretion with respect to one or more Limited Partners. After 
receiving a withdrawal notice from a Limited Partner, the Partnership may, upon at least 24 
hours' notice to the Limited Partner, effect such withdrawal and pay all or a portion of the 
withdrawal proceeds at any time prior to the anticipated Withdrawal Date. A withdrawal notice 
will be irrevocable by a Limited Partner unless the General Partner, in its sole discretion, 
determines otherwise. 
(c) 
A Limited Partner withdrawing amounts from a Capital Account pursuant 
to this Section 4.2 will generally be paid the amount withdrawn, net of any Incentive Allocation, 
Early Withdrawal Charges and accrued expenses through the Withdrawal Date, within 30 days 
after the applicable Withdrawal Date, provided, that a Limited Partner withdrawing ninety 
percent (90%) or more of his Capital Accounts, will generally be paid an amount equal to at least 
ninety percent (90%) of the amount to be withdrawn, net of any Incentive Allocation, Early 
Withdrawal Charges and accrued expenses through the Withdrawal Date, within thirty (30) days 
after the applicable Withdrawal Date, with the balance, if any, settled without interest no later 
than thirty (30) days after completion of the audit of the Partnership's books for the year in 
which such withdrawal took place. All withdrawals shall be subject to the reserve referred to in 
Section 5.5 and the General Partner's right to suspend withdrawals in accordance with Section 
5.7 below. Distributions under this Section 4.2 may be made in cash and/or in Securities (which 
may include equity interests in subsidiaries of the Partnership or participating interests in assets 
owned by the Partnership), in the sole discretion of the General Partner. 
In the event a 
distribution is made in cash, the Capital Account of the Partner receiving such distribution shall 
be debited with the amount of cash so distributed. In the event a distribution is made in the form 
of Securities, the Capital Account of the Partner receiving distribution in the form of Securities 
shall be debited with the value, determined in accordance with Section 1.9(m) above, as of the 
date of distribution of the Securities distributed. The Securities to be distributed shall be selected 
by the General Partner in its discretion and need not be a pro rata portion of each position held 
by the Partnership. 
4.3 
Investor Gate. Notwithstanding Section 4.2 above, a Limited Partner may 
withdraw only up to fifty percent (50%) of the value of his Capital Account as of any 
Withdrawal Date (such limitation, the "Investor Gate" and the amount permitted to be withdrawn 
pursuant to the Investor Gate, the "Maximum Amount"), unless such Investor Gate is waived by 
the General Partner, in its discretion. If a Limited Partner submits a request to withdraw more 
than the Maximum Amount as of a single Withdrawal Date (such date, the "Gated Withdrawal
