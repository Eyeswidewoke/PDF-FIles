APPENDIX TO THIS ACCOUNT AGREEMENT: DISCLOSURES AND DEFINITIONS 
IMPORTANT: PLEASE READ THIS APPENDIX 
DISCLOSURES 
1. Confirmations. Confirmations of transactions, as well as other communications will be sent to the address Client 
has provided, or to such other address as Client may hereafter give to DBSI in writing, and all communications so 
sent, whether by mail, private carrier, facsimile, messenger, electronically or otherwise, shall be deemed delivered 
to Client when sent, whether actually received or not. 
2. Consent to Loan or Pledge of Securities and other Property. Within the limitations Imposed by Applicable Law, all 
Securities and Other Property now or hereafter held, carried or maintained by or in the possession of O651 that 
have not been fully paid for may be lent to DBSI, to Pershing or to others, and may be pledged, repledged, 
hypothecated or rehypothecated without notice to Client, either separately or In common with other Securities and 
Other Property of DBSI's other Clients for any amount due in any account with DBSI in which Client has an 
interest, or for any greater amount, and DBSI may do so without retaining in its possession or control for delivery a 
like amount of similar Securities and Other Property. Client understands that while securities held for Client's 
Account(s) are loaned out, Client will lose voting rights attendant to such securities. For additional terms that apply 
to margin accounts only, see the Margin Addendum. Neither Pershing, nor DBSI, will lend or pledge fully paid 101 
securities without Client's written permission. 
3. Corrected and Late Trade Reports. DBSI may receive late and/or erroneous trade reports from the marketplace 
where Client's order is executed. Any such reports may result in an adjustment to Client's order or the information 
on a trade execution reported to Client. 
4. Effect of Attachment or Sequestration of Accounts. DBSI shall not be liable for refusing to obey any orders given 
by or for Client with respect to any Account which is or has been subject to an attachment or sequestration in any 
legal proceeding against Client, and DBSI shall be under no obligation to contest the validity of any such 
attachment or sequestration. 
5. Foreign Securities. With respect to debt or equity securities of foreign issuers or debt or deposit instruments of 
foreign banks ("Foreign Securities"), Client acknowledges and understands that (a) Foreign Securities are, in most 
cases, not registered with the Securities end Exchange Commission or listed on any U.S. securities exchange, (b) 
Foreign Securities, particularly those of issuers in the so-called "emerging markets" are often illiquid, are 
sometimes subject to legal and/or contractual transfer restrictions and it may be difficult or impossible to dispose 
of such Foreign Securities prior to the maturity thereof or to determine the market price thereof for valuation 
purposes, (c) Foreign Securities, and the issuer, guarantors or other obligors with respect thereto ("Foreign Issuers/ 
Obligors") are subject to a variety of risks in addition to those typically faced in the case of U.S. securities and 
issuers, including, among other things, currency risk, exchange controls, confiscatory taxation, withholding, 
limitations on the rights of security holders, civil unrest, hyperinflation, discriminatory treatment of foreign 
investors, etc., (d) there is often less information available regarding Foreign Issuers/Obligors, and such Information 
may be more difficult to interpret, than is the case with U.S. issuers whose securities are subject to the periodic 
reporting requirements under U.S. securities laws. (e) there may be no effective means to determine if a Foreign 
Issuer/Obligor is in default of its obligations in respect of its debt securities or other financial obligations (and Client 
specifically acknowledges that Foreign Securities which Client purchases may be in default at the time of 
purchase), (f) Foreign Securities in question may be unrated, and (g) such Foreign Securities are not suitable for all 
investors. Client authorizes DBSI to purchase Foreign Securities (and, In the case of Foreign Securities 
denominated in foreign currencies, the relevant foreign currencies) from or sell Foreign Securities (and foreign 
exchange) to an Affiliate of DBSI. In dealing with such Affiliates, such Affiliates may take and retain their normal 
commissions, spreads or other fees without regard to DBSI's relationship with Client. 
8. Freeriding Prohibited (Not Applicable to Margin Accounts). Paying for the purchase of securities in a cash account 
with the proceeds of their subsequent sale, known as freeriding, violates Regulation T of the Federal Reserve 
Board, is prohibited and may. among other things, result in Client's Account being restricted or closed. 
7. Impartial Lottery Allocation System. When DBSI holds Securities and Other Property that are callable (all or in 
part) on Client's behalf, Client will participate in DBSI's impartial lottery allocation system for the called Securities 
and Other Property. 
8. Non-Investment Adviser Capacity. Unless DBSI agrees otherwise in writing, DBSI is not acting as an "investment 
adviser' (as such term is defined in the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended) with respect to the Client's 
Account(s). 
9. Non-United States Resident Additional Disclosure and Understanding. This disclosure applies to non-United 
States residents and non-United States domiciled entities. Client's Account Is based In the United States, and not
