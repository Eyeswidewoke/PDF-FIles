Lawren=e Krauss 
Dear Ms. Saadiq: 
My name i= Adam Waldman, and I am Professor Lawrence Krauss' litigation counsrl. Earlier this 
week, I sent the attached letter to Buzzfeed via one o= their reporters named Peter Aldhous. 
I am also in receipt of Mr. Aldhous' letter to ASU, which i= a variation on defamation — both libel 
and slander — that M=. Aldhous and his colleagues have been manufacturing for at least 6 months (=otably without any 
reporting) in a campaign with a purpose known only to th=m. Buzzfeed's first method is to call or write third 
parties,=posit a list of fake, anonymous, recklessly false and malicious "al=egations," and ask if the third party has 
anything to add. Bu=zfeed's second method is to seek tortious interference with Profess=r Krauss' professional 
contracts, by writing third parties with who= Professor Krauss is in privity, present a similarly inflammatory series 
of=anonymous, recklessly false and malicious accusations, and then question: h=w can the email's recipient allow such a 
person to serve on their b=ard, or speak at their conference? The letter from Buzzfeed to the Un=versity falls into both 
categories. There will be appropriate legal consequ=nces for Buzzfeed's actions. 
It is my understanding that your office believes it is compelled by th= above to investigate false, 
defamatory, anonymous accusations posited by t=e online tabloid Buzzfeed by contacting third parties and potentially 
rebro=dcasting the tabloid Buzzfeed's accusations. To be clear, the=e accusations were not made to the University by 
actual human beings who ar= alleging they were victims. There is no evidence they were presented=to Buzzfeed by 
actual human beings. Moreover, no present or former employee= of ASU have made any such allegations to your office, 
or to any office at A=U, to our knowledge. They are simply alleged by a tabloid, and one that had=yet published a "story" 
on the topic when they forwarded these to y=u. You may propose to rebroadcast this tabloid's libel to other 
third=parties who have also made no accusation against Professor Krauss. I s=ggest that you consult with the 
University's counsel before taking s= rash a step as re-broadcasting hearsay defamation that came to you via an o=line 
tabloid under these circumstances. 
Professor Krauss and I both recognize the absolute need to investigate re=l allegations. Some of 
the women who have bravely come forward with p=rsonal harassment allegations against Harvey Weinstein are my 
clients and f=iends. Some of these victims have been advised by me. Those act=al allegations are entirely distinct from 
a tabloid attempting to manufactu=e allegations to create harm.
