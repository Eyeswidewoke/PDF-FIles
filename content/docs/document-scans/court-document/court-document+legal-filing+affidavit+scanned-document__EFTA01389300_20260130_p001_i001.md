UNLESS OTHERWISE INDICATED, REFERENCES IN THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION OF 
THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE ACCESS FUND'S INVESTMENTS, ACTIVITIES, 
INCOME, GAIN AND LOSS INCLUDE INDIRECT INVESTMENTS, ACTIVITIES, INCOME, 
GAIN AND LOSS OF THE ACCESS FUND AS A RESULT OF THE ACCESS FUND'S STATUS 
AS A LIMITED PARTNER OF THE UNDERLYING FUND. 
Limited Partner's Tax Basis in its Interests. A Limited Partner's tax basis in its Interests would include 
the amount of money and/or the tax basis of property (if any) that the Limited Partner contributes to the 
Access Fund, increased principally by the Limited Partner's distributive share of any Access Fund income 
and certain Access Fund liabilities (if any), and decreased, but not below zero, principally by (i) the amount 
of cash distributions from the Access Fund to the Limited Partner and the adjusted tax basis of any 
distributions in-kind from the Access Fund to the Limited Partner, (ii) the amount of the Limited Partner's 
distributive sham of the Access Fund's losses and (iii) the Limited Partner's sham of a reduction in certain 
Access Fund liabilities, if any. We can provide no assurance with respect to the amount of Fund liabilities 
that would be allocated to any Limited Partner for this purpose. 
Distributions. A cash distribution to a Limited Partner generally will be taxable only to the extent that it 
exceeds the Limited Partner's tax basis in its Interests. The amount of the distribution, if any, that is in 
excess of tax basis will be considered to be gain from the sale of the Interests and generally taxable as a 
capital gain except to the extent attributable to certain ordinary income items of the Access Fund. Subject 
to certain exceptions, a Limited Partner generally would recognize loss with respect to its Interests only 
upon the receipt of a distribution consisting solely of cash in an amount that was less than the Limited 
Partner's tax basis in its Interests and which occurred in connection with a complete liquidation of the 
Limited Partner's Interests. 
Distributions of property other than cash, whether in complete or partial liquidation of a Limited Partner's 
Interests, generally would not result in the recognition of taxable income or loss to the Limited Partner 
(except to the extent such distribution is treated as made in exchange for such Limited Partner's share of 
the Access Fund's unrealized receivables). However, that gain generally must be recognized by a Limited 
Partner where the distribution consists of marketable securities unless the distributing partnership is an 
"investment partnership" and the recipient is an "eligible partner," both as defined in Section 731(c) of the 
Code. Each Fund will determine at the appropriate time whether it qualifies as an "investment partnership." 
Assuming it so qualifies, if a partner is an "eligible partner," which term should include a Limited Partner 
whose contributions to the Fund consisted solely of cash, the non-recognition rule described herein should 
apply. 
Allocations of Income and Loss to Limited Partners. Pursuant to the Partnership Agreement, items of the 
Access Fund's income gain, loss and deduction are allocated so as to take into account the varying interests 
of the Partners in the Access Fund. U.S. Treasury Regulations provide that allocations of items of 
partnership income, gain, loss, deduction or credit will be respected for tax purposes if such allocations 
have "substantial economic effect" or are determined to be in accordance with the partners' interests in a 
partnership. The Access Fund believes that. for U.S. federal income tax purposes, allocations pursuant to 
the Partnership Agreement should be given effect, and the General Partner intends to prepare the Access 
Fund's U.S. federal income tax returns based on such allocations. We can provide no assurance that a 
Fund's allocations will be respected. If a Fund's allocations are successfully challenged and re-determined 
by the IRS, such redetermination could be less favorable than the allocations set forth in the applicable 
limited partnership agreement.
