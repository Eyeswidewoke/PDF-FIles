that begins on the Ramp-Up End Date and ends on and includes the 30th Business Day following 
the Ramp-Up End Date, and such confirmation has still not been received as the related

Section 9.2 
Optional Redemption. 
(a) 
After the end of the Non-Call Period, or upon the occurrence and during 
the continuance of a Tax Event, at the direction of the Collateral Manager (with the consent of a 
Majority of the Income Notes) or at the direction of a Majority of the Income Notes, the 
Applicable Issuer shall redeem the Aggregate Principal Amount of Notes then Outstanding, in 
whole but not in part, at the applicable Redemption Price, on the next Payment Date following 
such direction (or, if such direction is received less than 45 Business Days prior to a Payment 
Date, on the next Payment Date thereafter) (the "Optional Redemption Date") from Principal 
Proceeds and all other funds available for such purpose in the Collection Account and the 
Payment Account on the related Determination Date. 
(b) 
Upon receipt of a notice of redemption, the Collateral Manager, on behalf 
of the Issuer, will direct the sale of all or part of the Collateral Obligations and other Collateral in 
accordance with Section 9.3 in order that the proceeds from such sale and all other funds 
available for such purpose in the Collection Account and the Payment Account will be at least 
sufficient to pay the Redemption Price on all of the Senior Notes then Outstanding and to pay all 
administrative and other fees and expenses payable under the Priority of Payments and ranking 
senior to the Income Notes (other than any Incentive Management Fee) (collectively, the 
"Minimum Redemption Amount"). If in the Collateral Manager's reasonable determination such 
proceeds of sale and all other funds available for such purpose in the Collection Account and the 
Payment Account would not be sufficient to redeem all Senior Notes and to pay such fees and 
expenses, the Notes may not be redeemed. 
In the event of any redemption of the Notes pursuant to this Section 9.2, the Issuer 
shall, at least 20 days prior to the Redemption Date (unless the Trustee shall agree to a shorter 
notice period), notify the Trustee and notify each Rating Agency in writing of such Redemption 
Date, the applicable Record Date, the principal amount of Notes to be redeemed on such 
Redemption Date and the applicable Redemption Price(s). 
Section 9.3 
Redemption Procedures. 
(a) 
In the event of any redemption pursuant to Section 9.2, a notice of 
redemption shall be given by first class mail, postage prepaid, mailed not later than ten Business 
Days prior to the applicable Redemption Date, to each Holder of Notes to be redeemed, at such 
Holder's address in the Register and each Rating Agency. In addition, for so long as any Listed 
Securities are listed on the Irish Stock Exchange and so long as the rules of such exchange so 
require, notice of such redemption pursuant to Section 9.2 shall also be given to the Noteholders 
by publication in the Daily Official List of the Irish Stock Exchange. 
(b) 
All notices of redemption delivered pursuant to Section 9.3(a) shall state:
