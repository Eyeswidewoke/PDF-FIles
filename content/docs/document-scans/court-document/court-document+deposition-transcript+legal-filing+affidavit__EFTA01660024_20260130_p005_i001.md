Case 9:08-cv-80119-KAM 
Document 38 
Entered on FLSD Docket 08/12/2008 
Page 5 of 13 
attached hereto as Exhibit "B"). In enacting § 1595, Congress specifically intended that the term 
"criminal action" would be applied extremely broadly. Accordingly, Congress took pains to 
ensure that courts would give it the broadest possible construction and, for that reason, specified in 
the definition provision that "criminal action" also "includes investigation." 
18 U.S.C. § 
1595(b)(2). The only reported decision addressing this provision interpreted it according to its 
plain language. See Ara v. Khan, No. CV 07-1251, 2007 WL 1726456,'2 (E.D.N.Y. June 14, 
2007) (ordering "all proceedings in this case stayed pending the conclusion of the government's 
criminal investigation of the defendants and of any resulting criminal prosecution") (emphasis 
added). 
Given that the USAO's Agreement with Epstein indicates that: 
• 
the grand-jury's subpoenas remain "outstanding" (Agreement, at 5); 
• 
the subpoenas are "held in abeyance" (id.): 
• 
the subpoenas are not "withdrawn" (W.); 
• 
the parties must "maintain their evidence" (id.) (which would be entirely unnecessary if 
the investigation against Epstein were closed); 
• "any" existing "charges" will not "be dismissed" until after Epstein has "timely 
fulfill[ed] all the terms and conditions of the [A]greement" (id. at 2); and 
• 
"prosecution in this District . . . shall be deferred" (id.) (but not closed or dismissed), 
- - then. the only reasonable conclusion is that the Federal Criminal Action remains "pending.-3
The plaintiffs argue that a § 3509(k) stay would be "inconsistent with Mr. Epstein's 
Agreement with the U.S. Attorney" which the plaintiffs claim is reproduced in the lead 
3 The ordinary meaning of the adjective "pending" is "(r]emaining undecided; awaiting decision . . .. Black's Law 
Dictionary 1154 (8th ed. 2004). The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit routinely relies on 
Black's Law Dictionary for the definition of statutory terms, including in criminal cases. See e.g., United States v. 
Young. 528 F.3d 1294, 1297 n.3 (11th Cir. 2008) (definitions of criminal "complaint" and "indictment"); United 
States v. Brown, 526 F.3d 691, 705 (11th Cir. 2008) (definition of "knowingly" in criminal statute). A Westlaw 
search revealed that in 2008 alone, the Eleventh Circuit has already published eight opinions relying on Black's Law 
Dictionary for definitions. See also, White v. Klitzkie, 281 F.3d 920, 928 (9th Cir. 2002) (relying on Black's Law 
Dictionary, in the context of a criminal case, for the definition of "pending" as "awaiting decision"); Swam v. 
Meyers, 204 F.3d 417, 421 (3d Cir. 2000) (relying on Black's Law Dictionary for the definition of "pending," 
expressly because "'pendi,g' is not defined in the statute"). Any common-sense reading of the Agreement and the 
USAO's recent sworn construction of it, is consonant with the Federal Criminal Action's "remaining undecided" and 
"awaiting decision." See Unified Gov't of Athens-Clarke County v. Athens Newspapers, LLC, No. S07Gl133. 
_S.E.2d 
2008 Wt. 2579238, '3 (Ga. June 30, 2008) (reviewing a public-records request against Georgia's 
"pending investigation" exception to its open-records law, and holding that "a seemingly inactive investigation which 
has not yet resulted in a prosecution logically "remains undecided," and is therefore -pending," until it -is concluded 
and the file closed') (emphasis added).
