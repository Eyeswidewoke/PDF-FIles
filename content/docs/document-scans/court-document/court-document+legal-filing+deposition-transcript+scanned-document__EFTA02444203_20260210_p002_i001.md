and warranties, collectively, the "Holder's Representations"). The exercise of this Warrant shall 
be deemed to have been effected on the day on which the Holder surrenders this Warrant to the 
Company and satisfies all of the other requirements of this Section 2(a). Upon such exercise, the 
Holder will be deemed a stockholder of record of those Shares for which this Warrant has been so 
exercised, with all rights of a stockholder (including, without limitation, all voting rights with 
respect to such Shares and all rights to receive any dividends with respect to such Shares). If this 
Warrant shall have been exercised only in part, the Company shall, at the time of delivery of the 
certificate or certificates for the Shares with respect to which this Warrant has been exercised, 
deliver to the Holder a new Warrant evidencing the right to purchase the remaining Shares called 
for by this Warrant, which new Warrant shall in all other respects be identical with this Warrant, 
or, at the request of the Holder, appropriate notations may be made on this Warrant, which shall 
then be returned to the Holder. The Company shall pay all expenses, transfer taxes and other 
direct charges payable in connection with the preparation, issuance and delivery of share 
certificates and, as applicable, any new Warrant, except that, if share certificates or any new 
Warrant shall be registered in a name or names other than the name of the Holder, funds sufficient 
to pay all transfer taxes, if any, payable as a result of such transfer shall be paid by the Holder at 
the time of delivering the aforementioned notice of exercise or promptly upon receipt of a written 
request of the Company for payment. 
(b) 
Stock Certificates. In the event of any exercise of the rights represented by 
this Warrant, certificates for the Shares so purchased shall be delivered to the Holder within a 
reasonable time, but in no event later than the (10) Business Days, after the exercise date of this 
Warrant (with the term "Business Day" meaning any day other than a Saturday, Sunday or other 
day on which banks or other financial institutions are authorized or required to be closed in the 
City or State of New York). 
3. 
Covenants of the Company. The Company covenants and agrees that all shares 
of Common Stock that may be issued upon the exercise of the rights represented by this Warrant, 
upon issuance and payment therefor in accordance herewith, will be duly authorized, validly 
issued, filly paid and nonassessable shares of capital stock of the Company. The Company 
further covenants and agrees that, during the period within which the rights represented by this 
Warrant may be exercised, the Company will at all times have duly authorized and duly reserved a 
number of shares of Common Stock sufficient for issuance upon the exercise of the rights 
evidenced by this Warrant. 
4. 
Transfer, Exchange or Loss of Warrant. 
(a) 
No Assignment. Neither this Warrant nor any of the Shares issued upon 
the exercise hereof may be assigned or transferred except as provided in this Section 4 and in 
accordance with and subject to the provisions of the Securities Regulations. Any purported 
transfer or assignment made other than in accordance with this Section 4 shall be null and void 
and of no force or effect. 
(b) 
Notification to Company. Concurrently with, and as a condition to, any 
transfer of this Warrant, the Holder shall provide the Company with written notice of such 
transfer, indicating the circumstances of such transfer and, upon request, furnish the Company
