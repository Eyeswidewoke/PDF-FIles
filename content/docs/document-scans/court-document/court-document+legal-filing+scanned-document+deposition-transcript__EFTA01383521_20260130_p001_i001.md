Hierarchy of Events. 
(i) 
An event or circumstance that constitutes or gives rise to an Illegality or a Force Majeure Event will 
not, for so long as that is the case, also constitute or give rise to an Event of Default under Section 5(a)(0,

otherwise constitute or give rise to an Illegality or a Force Majeure Event also constitutes an Event of 
Default or any other Termination Event, it will be treated as an Event of Default or such other Termination

also constitutes an Illegality, it will be treated as an Illegality, except as described in clause (ii) above, and 
not a Force Majeure Event.

following the end of any applicable Waiting Period in respect of that Illegality or Force Majeure Event, as 
the case may be; or 
(ii) 
if earlier, the date on which the event or circumstance constituting or giving rise to that Illegality or 
Force Majeure Event ceases to exist or, if such date is not a Local Business Day or. in the case of a delivery,
