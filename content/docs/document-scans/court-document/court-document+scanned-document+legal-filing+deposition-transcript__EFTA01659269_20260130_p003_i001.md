> Palm Beach police say they are conducting an "open and active criminal investigation" at the club, also 
President Donald Trump's South Florida home, following an unspecified incident. 
> The Secret Service is leading the investigation and no arrest has been made, according to the Palm Beach 
Police Department. 
> "During an encounter with local law enforcement, an individual made non-threatening statements about a 
person under Secret Service protection," a law enforcement official with knowledge of the incident told the 
Miami Herald. "As part of standard practice, Palm Beach police contacted the local Secret Service office." 
> The Secret Service protects the president and members of his family. The president had left for Washington, 
D.C., more than 24 hours earlier. 
> Michael Ogrodnick, a Palm Beach police spokesman, declined to comment Tuesday, citing the 
investigation. But the department did provide a nearly completely redacted incident report showing officers 
were called around 7 p.m. to "assist" another law enforcement agency. 
> "As a matter of practice, the Secret Service does not confirm or comment on the absence or existence of our 
criminal investigations," according to a statement from a Secret Service spokesperson. 
> The Palm Beach police report also mentions the involvement of the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office. A 
spokeswoman for PBSO didn't immediately provide information. 
> While law enforcement officials would not discuss the nature of the investigation, Mar-a-Lago security has 
been breached repeatedly since Trump became president. The private club and mansion has witnessed several 
high-profile trespassing incidents. 
> The club has been on heightened alert since Trump ordered a military strike that killedan influential Iranian 
general last week. Trump gave the order from the club. On Sunday, an adviser to Iran's president, Hassan 
Rouhani, tweeted a Forbes list of Trump's properties, including Mar-a-Lago, then followed up by saying that 
"We have ZERO problems with the American people ... Our sole problem is Trump. In the event of war, it is 
he who will bear full responsibility." 
> Instagram users have been tagging Mar-a-Lago on a map of South Florida with the words "Dear Iran, He's 
on the golf course." The post has been tagged to the club at least 12 times since the attack. (Mar-a-Lago does 
not have a golf course, although Trump does frequently play at his nearby Trump International Golf Club in 
West Palm Beach.) 
> Trump left Mar-a-Lago Sunday after spending his winter holiday in South Florida. The Trump Organization 
has long run the mansion as a private club for members. The president also declared it his legal residence late 
last year. Secret Service is in charge of security when the president is staying at the club. Members of his 
immediate family also have Secret Service details that accompany them there. Otherwise, security is provided 
by private contractors. 
> In March, a Chinese woman was arrested after trespassing at Mar-a-Lago. She was subsequently 
investigated by federal authorities as a potential foreign agent. The woman, Yujing Zhang, was found 
guilty of entering a restricted federal area and making false statements but was not charged with any 
espionage-related activities. 
> What do we know about the Chinese Mar-a-Lago intruder?
