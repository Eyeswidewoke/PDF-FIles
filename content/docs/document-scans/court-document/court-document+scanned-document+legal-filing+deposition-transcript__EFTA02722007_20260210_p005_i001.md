its involvement in the high-end value aspects of the heroin industry was still in its infancy.16
Besides, the foreign forces in Afghanistan have focused mainly on their fight against the 
Taliban, explaining why drug trafficking flourished again in 2011 despite having suffered 
from a plant infection in 2010.17 Nowadays, Afghanistan accounts for 85 per cent of the 
world's heroin. It provides an income to half a million families. The smugglers and criminals 
offer an 'alternative welfare system' to Afghans who do not have the chance to ask for any 
support from their state. And yet, the drug menace was not part of the formal agenda of the 
20 May 2012 NATO Summit in Chicago.'8 Tehran, like other regional victims of Afghan 
drug trafficking,19 seems to be part of a minority in the international community that 
understands the need to deal with a problem which looks like a plague from an Iranian 
perspective. 
Moreover, Afghanistan has been also a source of refugees, an important problem for Tehran. 
Along with Pakistan, Iran has been the country having the most to deal with the consequences 
of the Afghan issue from this point of view. In the two cases, it has been a consequence of the 
Afghan instability since the 1980s. At this period the Iranians found themselves to deal with 
around two million refugees.2° In 1991-92 there were nearly three million. But the two 
countries have had different policies towards the Afghan refugees: Islamabad confined them 
to refugee camps. It gave the Pakistanis a better political control over those foreigners but 
made the latter totally dependent on international aid. The refugees in Iran found themselves 
in a better situation to some extent, especially during the first years of their exile, despite the 
fact that the Islamic Republic of Iran received little external help.2I The Iranians were 
focusing on their war against Iraq and were not able to control the Afghan refugees 
politically. The Iranians limited their attention to organising the Hazara refugees, unifying 
those Shiites around the group Hizb-1 Wandat•22 But as the Iranian authorities needed more 
manpower to do this, they let the Afghan refugees work anywhere in Iran. Such a situation 
turned those refugees into economic competitors in Iran after the end of its war with Iraq. As 
for the Afghans who settled in Iran or who saw in this country a chance for better life, they

E1 To understand the difficulty of the task the Iranians had to deal with in the last three decades, one needs to 
have in mind the fact that Iran has been hosting one of the most important refugee populations in the world.
