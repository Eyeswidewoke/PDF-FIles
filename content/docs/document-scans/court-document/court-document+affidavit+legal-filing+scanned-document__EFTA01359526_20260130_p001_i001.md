Section 4 -- Notice of Meetings: 
(a) 
Except as otherwise provided by statute, written notice of each meeting of shareholders, 
whether annual or special, stating the time when and place where it is to be held, shall be served 
either personally or by mail, not less than ten (10) nor more than fifty (50) days before the meeting, 
upon each shareholder of record entitled to vote at such meeting, or the shareholder's designated 
agent, and to any other shareholder to whom the giving of notice may be required by law. Notice of 
a special meeting shall also state the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called, and shall 
indicate that it is being issued by, or at the direction of, the person or persons calling the meeting. 
If, at any meeting, action is proposed to be taken that would, if taken, entitle shareholders to receive 
payment for their shares pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Virgin Islands Code, the notice 
of such meeting shall include a statement of that purpose and to that effect. If mailed, such notice 
shall be directed to each such shareholder at his address, as it appears on the records of the 
shareholders of the Corporation, unless he shall have previously filed with the Secretary of the 
Corporation a written request that notices intended for him be mailed to the shareholders' agent 
and/or to some other address, in which case, it shall be mailed to the person and address designated 
in such request. 
(b) 
Notice may be provided by email if a shareholder has provided his email address to the 
Secretary for such purpose.

(c) 
Notice of any meeting need not be given to any person who may become a shareholder of 
record after the mailing of such notice and prior to the meeting, or to any shareholder who attends 
such meeting, in person or by proxy, or to any shareholder whO, in person or by proxy, submits a 
signed waiver of notice either before or after such meeting. Notice of any adjourned meeting of 
shareholders need not be given, unless otherwise required by statute. 
Section 5 -- Ouorum: 
(a) 
Except as otherwise provided herein, or by the applicable provisions of the Virgin Islands 
Code, or in the Articles of Incorporation (such Articles and any amendments thereof being herein 
collectively referred to as the "Articles"), at all meetings of shareholders of the Corporation, the 
presence at the commencement of such meetings in person or by proxy of any number of 
shareholders holding of record a majority of the total number of shares of the Corporation then 
issued and outstanding and entitled to vote, shall be necessary and sufficient to constitute a quorum 
for the transaction of any business. The withdrawal of any shareholder after the commencement of 
a meeting shall have no effect on the existence of a quorum, after a quorum has been established at 
such meeting. 
(b) 
Despite the absence of a quorum at any annual or special meeting of shareholders, the 
shareholders, by a majority of the votes cast by the holders of shares entitled to vote thereon, may 
adjourn the meeting. At any such adjourned meeting at which a quorum is present, any business 
may be transacted at the meeting as originally called if a quorum had been present.
