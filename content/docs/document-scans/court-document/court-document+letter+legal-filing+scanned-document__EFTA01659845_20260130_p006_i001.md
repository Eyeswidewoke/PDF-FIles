is a long tradition of accepting pleas that allow for some flexibility as to the crime charged. since 
pleas represent a mutual agreement and mutual waiver by the parties. Although certain elements 
cannot, in law, be waived, courts have treated this issue inure flexibly in tlx: context of plea 
agreements. There is no such flexibility in the context of an indictment ur threatened indictment. 
Second. [Wend statutes are, as a matter of constitutional law. required to he even clearer 
and less subject to common law expansion than state statutes. As far hack as 1812. the Supreme 
Court has held that there could he no common law crimes tinder federal law. Sec United Slates 
r. Ihtdcon. 7 Crunch 32. 43 (1812) (•yO)ur Courts no doubt possess powers not immediately 
derived from statute: but all exercise of criminal jurisdiction in common law cases we am Of 
opinion is not within their implied powers."). The states have never been subject to this 
limitation on the federal government. Indeed. at the time of the Founding there were same 
cotnnnin law crimes, and state courts had broad authority 
subject to consideration of lair 
warning — to apply common law principles to the construe • 
of state criminal statutes. 
Federal courts have never had such authority: 
Although it is not likely that a criminal will carefully consider the text of the law before 
he murders or steals. it is reasonable that a fair warning should be given to the world in 
language that the common world will understand 01 what the law intends to do if a certain 
line is passed. To make tlx: wanting fair, so far as possible the line should he clear. 
When a rule of conduct is laid down in words that evoke in the common mind only the 
picture at' vehicles moving on land. the statute should not he extended to aircraft. simply 
because it may sksan to us that a similar policy applies, or upon the speculation that. if the 
legislatme had thought of it, very likely broader words would have been used...

instances of over-arching federal interests, of which none are implicated in the matter at hand. 
Third. This issue is especially; compelling in the context of a federal statute that purports 
to make a federal crime out of conduct that has traditionally been the province of the states. as 
sex with minors and solicitation of sex for money have always been." Before a federal statute 
can he construed to cover such conduct, its language must be "unmistakably clear", because 
Congress cannot he presumed to have intended to disrupt the delicate balance between federal 
and state jurisdiction over crimes that have been traditionally prosecuted by the slates. In cases 
raising potential Petite inues, the federal statute must unambiguously cover the conduct at issue. 
As we have nude ckar throughout this investigation. the alleged conduct does nol implicate mvr•arching 
federal interests because the conduct was purely hwul in nature, the conduct is covered by stale law. and there 
are no indicia of force, coercion, violence, drugs, luring or trafficking.
