Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Finn 
The Board of Directors and Stockholder of Firs Data Corporation 
We have audited First Data Corporation's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31. 2014, based on criteria 
established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework Sued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 
framework) (the COSO criteria). First Data Corporation's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial 
reporting. and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's 
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's internal control over financial 
reporting based on our audit. 
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those 
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting 
was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the 
risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control basal on the assessed risk, and 
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our 
opinion. 
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of 
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A 
company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in 
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that 
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 
and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the 
company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the 
company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections 
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or 
that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
In our opinion. First Data Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of 
December 31. 2014. based on COSO criteria. 
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the 
consolidated balance sheets of First Data Corporation as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the related consolidated statements of operations, 
comprehensive income (loss), cash flows, and equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2014 of First Data Corporation 
and our report dated February 27, 2015, except as to Note 6, Note 13 and Note 18, as to which the date is August 25, 2015 expressed an unqualified 
opinion thereon.
