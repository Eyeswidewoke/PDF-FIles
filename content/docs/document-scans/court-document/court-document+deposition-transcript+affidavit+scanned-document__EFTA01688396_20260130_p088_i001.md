make you aware of the victim services that may be available to you and to answer any questions you may have 
regarding the criminal justice process throughout the investigation. Our program is part of the FBI's effort to 
ensure the victims are treated with respect and arc provided information about their rights under federal law. 
These rights include notification of the status of the case. The enclosed brochures provide information about the 
FBI's Victim Assistance Program, resources and instructions for accessing the Victim Notification System

patience while we conduct a thorough investigation. 
As a crime victim, you have the following rights under 18 United States Code § 3771: (1) The right to be 
reasonably protected from the accused; (2) The right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public 
court proceeding, or any parole proceeding, involving the crime or of any release or escape of the accused; (3) 
The right not to be excluded from any such public court proceeding, unless the court, after receiving clear and

other testimony at that proceeding; (4) The right to be reasonably heard at any public proceeding in the district
