directly under the control of Mullah Omar.67 Of course such a scenario does not mean that 
chaos is now the destiny that the Iranians have in mind for Afghanistan. If they wanted such a 
result, there was no need to make difficult alliances with people who are, at heart, Sunni 
supremacists. In fact, as Afghan trade is now very dependent on Iran, to close the Iran-
Afghanistan border would be enough to put great pressure on Karzai68. By talking to the neo-
Taliban, the Iranians are doing no more than what the Americans, the Pakistanis, and even the 
Russians69 are already doing, in trying to be in touch with all the different Afghan political 
players. Indeed, for now, the Taliban is a useful enemy, accepted as it poses a challenge to a 
stronger enemy, i.e. the US. To talk about reconciliation would be to go too far. But clearly, 
the White House has made a tour de force by creating a situation for those two opposite 
actors to share the same interests, i.e. opposing any long-term American presence in 
Afghanistan70. 
But such situation does not mean supporting terrorism in the region, or wanting to destabilise 
Afghanistan. Besides, the rise of the Taliban has already created problems for the Islamic 
Republic of Iran. Indeed the 'War on Drugs' seems more and more difficult as the Taliban is 
becoming more prominent inside the Afghan territory71. A long-term solution will depend on 
the struggle for influence inside the Taliban movement itself. Mullah Omar was interested in 
having a better relationship with Iran in the past, and the same could happen in the future. But 
what about the Haqqani network? This organisation has been supporting foreign jihadists and 
appears to be much more radical ideologically. What about the TTP (Tehreek-e-Taliban 
Pakistan), if it stays a force to reckon with? It already allied itself with anti-Shia militants in 
its war against Islamabad. After all, the Pakistani Taliban has been important as a force for 
the fight in Afghanistan. The role TTP could play after 2014 would not necessarily be in 
Iran's interest. Even if Mullah Omar takes control of the country after 2014, the foreign 
policy of the new regime will strongly depend on the power of these different players in 
Kabul. If the more extreme groups are able to take over, Iran will have no choice but to 
oppose the Taliban again. This could also convert the post-2014 Afghanistan into a 'failed 
state' again, and a renewed source of the same issues (significant number of refugees, drug
