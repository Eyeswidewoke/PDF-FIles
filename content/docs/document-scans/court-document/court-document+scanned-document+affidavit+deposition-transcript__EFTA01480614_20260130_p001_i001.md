HEADLINE: EPSTEIN CAMP CALLS FEMALE ACCUSERS LIARS 
BYLINE: By LARRY KELLER Palm Beach Post Staff Writer 
BODY: 
Attorneys and publicists for Palm Beach financier  Jeffrey Epstein went on the offensive Monday, 
contending that teenage girls who have accused Epstein of sexual shenanigans at his waterfront 
home are liars and saying that the Palm Beach Police Department is "childish." 
"There never was any sex between  Jeffrey Epstein and any underage women," his lead attorney, 
Jack Goldberger, said from Idaho where he was vacationing with his family. 
Epstein did have young women come to his house to give him massages, Goldberger said. "Mr. 
Epstein absolutely insisted anybody who came to his house be over the age of 18. How he verified 
that, I don't know. The question is, did anything illegal occur. The law was not violated here." 
He had no explanation as to why Epstein would pay girls or women with no massage training - as 
the alleged victims said was the case - $200 to $300 for their visits. "The credibility of these 
witnesses has been seriously questioned," Goldberger said. 
Epstein, 53, was indicted by a county grand jury last month on a charge of felony solicitation of 
prostitution. After an 11-month investigation that included sifting through Epstein's trash and 
surveilling his home, Palm Beach police concluded there was enough evidence to charge him with 
sexual activity with minors. When the grand jury indicted Epstein on the less serious charge, Police 
Chief Michael Reiter referred the case to the FBI to determine whether there were federal law 
violations. 
After a spate of stories about the case last week, New York publicist Dan Klores - whose client 
list has included Paris Hilton and Jennifer Lopez - said on Saturday that Epstein's camp was ready 
"to get their story out." 
They did that Monday via Goldberger and a Los Angeles publicist for Miami criminal defense 
attorney Roy Black, who also has represented Epstein in the case. 
"We just think there has been a distorted view of this case in the media presented by the Palm 
Beach police," Goldberger said. 
Reiter has consistently declined to comment on the case and did not respond to a request for 
comment Monday. 
The implication that State Attorney Barry Krischer was easy on Epstein by presenting the case to 
a grand jury rather than filing charges directly against him is wrong, Goldberger said. 
The Palm Beach Police Department was "happy and ecstatic" that the panel was going to review the 
evidence. "I think what happened is they weren't happy with the result. They decided to use the 
press to embarrass Mr. Epstein.'
But records show that Reiter wrote Krischer on May 1 - well before the case went to the grand 
jury - suggesting that Krischer "consider if good and sufficient reason exists to require your 
disqualification from the prosecution of these cases."
