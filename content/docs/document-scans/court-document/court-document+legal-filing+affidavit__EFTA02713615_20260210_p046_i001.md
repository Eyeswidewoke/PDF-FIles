Capital Account on a date that is not a Withdrawal Date without notice to, or the consent of, the 
other Limited Partners. The General Partner and its affiliates may withdraw capital from their 
Capital Accounts at any time, without notice to the Limited Partners. 
The right of any Partner to receive amounts withdrawn (whether voluntary or 
involuntarily) is subject to the provision by the General Partner for all Partnership liabilities in 
accordance with Delaware law and for reserves for contingencies and estimated accrued 
expenses, including reserves for unspecified contingencies even though not required by GAAP. 
Payment of Amounts Withdrawn. 
Subject to the Investor Gate and the Impaired 
Withdrawal Date procedures described above, a Limited Partner withdrawing amounts from his 
Capital Account will generally be paid the amount withdrawn, net of any Incentive Allocation, 
Early Withdrawal Charges and accrued expenses through the Withdrawal Date, within thirty (30) 
days after the applicable Withdrawal Date; provided, that a Limited Partner withdrawing ninety 
percent (90%) or more of his Capital Accounts will be subject to a holdback of up to ten percent 
(10%) of the amount requested to be withdrawn as of such Withdrawal Date (regardless of 
whether such requested withdrawal amount is reduced due to the application of the Investor 
Gate), to be settled without interest no later than thirty (30) days after completion of the audit of 
the Partnership's books for the year in which such withdrawal took place. 
The right of any Limited Partner to receive amounts withdrawn is subject to a holdback 
for the provision by the General Partner for all Partnership liabilities and reserves for 
contingencies whether or not required by GAAP. 
(See "Outline of Limited Partnership 
Agreement.") The General Partner, in its sole discretion, may distribute securities or other 
property of the Partnership selected by the General Partner in its discretion, in lieu of, or in 
addition to, cash in satisfaction of withdrawal requests. Such securities or other property need 
not represent a pro rata portion of each position held by the Partnership. A distribution in respect 
of a voluntary or required withdrawal may be made in cash and/or in kind. (See "Certain Risk 
Factors - In-Kind Distributions.") 
Any of the foregoing conditions related to withdrawals may be waived by the General 
Partner as to one or more Limited Partners, at the General Partner's discretion. 
Required Withdrawals. 
The General Partner may require any Limited Partner to 
withdraw in whole or in part from the Partnership at any time and for any reason upon at least 
two (2) days' prior written notice (which may be given to such Limited Partner by e-mail or 
otherwise). In such event, a withdrawing Limited Partner will be paid an amount equal to at 
least ninety percent (90%) of the amount that he is being required to withdraw, net of any 
Incentive Allocation and any accrued expenses through the withdrawal date, within thirty (30) 
days after the Withdrawal Date, with the balance settled without interest no later than thirty (30) 
days after completion of the audit of the Partnership's books for the year in which such required 
withdrawal took place. A Limited Partner who is required to withdraw all or any capital from his 
Capital Account will not be subject to any otherwise applicable Early Withdrawal Charges with 
respect to such withdrawal. The right of any Limited Partner to receive amounts with respect to 
a required withdrawal is subject to a holdback for the provision by the General Partner for all 
Partnership liabilities and reserves for contingencies (whether or not required by GAAP).
