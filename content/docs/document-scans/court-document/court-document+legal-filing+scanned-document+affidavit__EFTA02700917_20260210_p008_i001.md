to have walked on the scaffolding, this investigation concluded "Someone else had to have tied 
him to the scaffolding and killed him." 
A second British coroner's jury quashed the earlier verdict of suicide, declaring that there was not 
enough evidence available to determine whether it was murder and suicide. Instead it returned an 
open verdict, leaving the question of how Calvi met his end still dangling. But this did not 
satisfy Calvi's family, which was due a $10 million payment from the Italian insurer Unione 
Italiana if, and only if, Calvi had been murdered. 
In December 1998, a Rome court authorized the exhumation of Calvi's 16 year old corpse. His 
bones and other remains were then re-examined by a panel of forensic experts who concluded 
that the injuries to his neck were inconsistent with self- hanging, and that therefore he had most 
likely been murdered. If so, it was a murder disguised to look like a suicide

The Calvi Financial Thriller 
For those who ruled the world of money, Calvi's hanging death in June 1982, threatened to 
open a Pandora's Box of troubles. Not only was $1.2 billion dollars of his bank's money 
missing but through a subsidiary in Luxembourg it had been acting for the sovereign state of the 
Vatican. The news of Calvi's disappearance on June llth 1982 reached Italy's top monetary 
authorities while they were aboard a military jet en route to Brussels to face the grim prospect of 
a devaluation of the lira-- the fifth in three years. Whatever might happen to the lira in Brussels 
that day, the concern of these men now focused on this new crisis. The collapse of Calvi's bank, 
the second largest private bank in Italy, was now practically unavoidable and this, in turn, could 
seriously undermine the credibility of the entire Italian banking system. One of the officials on 
the plane, Mario Sarcenelli, the Director General of the Treasury Ministry, also had a special 
interest in the Calvi case. It had almost destroyed his career. Three years earlier, when as the 
deputy director of the Bank of Italy, he had begun an investigation into the Bank Ambrosiano. 
Before he could complete it, police arrived at the palatial headquarters of the Bank of Italy in 
Rome, and arrested him on what he called "trumped up charges." He was accused of 
withholding information and confined to a dungeon in the Regina Coelus prison in Rome. 
Finally, after 10 days, he was freed on condition that he leave the Bank of Italy. That ended 
Sarcenelli's investigation. 
. 
That same day two other specially chartered jets took to the air. The first of these planes had 
been chartered in Luxembourg to go to Milan. It carried secret documents that up to now had 
been seen only by Calvi and his top deputy, which rush to the head office of the Banco 
Ambrosiano. They were hand delivered to Michel Leemans, Calvi's trusted deputy at the 
investment banking unit, who subsequently told me the documents identified the true owner of a 
group of the anonymous companies that held the mystery bloc of Banco Ambrosiano stock that 
had stymied Sarcenelli's investigators four years earlier. 
The other chartered plane was an Alitalia Boeing 727 carrying Pope John Paul II to Geneva, 
Switzerland. Accompanying the Pope on this flight was Archbishop Marcinkus, now President 
of the Vatican's bank,the Institute for Religious Works. For the past week. Calvi's deputies at 
the Banco Ambrosiano, were desperately trying to reach him because 
Calvi had made him a director of the Banco Ambrosiano subsidiary in the Bahamas that had
