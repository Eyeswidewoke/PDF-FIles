Loss with respect to an Engine under circumstances in which there has not occurred an Event of 
Loss with respect to the Airframe on which such Engine was originally installed, the Grantor 
shall give the Mortgagee prompt written notice thereof and shall, within 90 days after the

Replacement Engine, the Grantor's title to the Replacement Engine free and clear of all Liens 
(other than Permitted Liens) and the subjection of the Replacement Engine to the lien and 
security interest of this Mortgage. Upon full compliance by the Grantor with the provisions of 
this subsection 4.11, the Mortgagee will deliver to the Grantor an instrument releasing the 
Engine with itspv‘t to which such Event of Loss occurred from the lien and security interest of 
this Mortgage. For all purposes of this Mortgage, each Replacement Engine shall, after being
