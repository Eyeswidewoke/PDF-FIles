returns will depend on various factors, including future operating results, the value of the assets and market 
conditions at the time of disposition. any related transaction costs and the timing and manner of sale. 
Contingent liabilities on dispositions 
25.28 In connection with the disposition of an Investment, the Company (for the relevant Compartment) may be 
required to make warranties and/or representations about the business and financial affairs of the Investment (or 
Intermediary Vehicle) typical of those made in connection with the sale of any business. The Company (for a 
Compartment) or its Intermediary Vehicles may also be required to indemnify the purchasers of such Investment 
to the extent that any such representation turns out to be inaccurate, or for other matters. These arrangements 
may result in contingent liabilities, which might ultimately have to be funded by the Investors making 
contributions to the relevant Compartment out of previous distributions from the Compartment (i.e., in respect of 
Underlying Claims). 
Default of a Shareholder - failure to comply with a Drawdown Notice 
25.29 If a Shareholder fails to honour a capital call, the Company, in its sole discretion, may take actions in respect of 
such Shareholder and may borrow to fund such defaulted capital call. If the Company fails to satisfy any capital 
call by an Investment as a result of any Shareholder's failure to honour a capital call by the Company, such 
Investment may take actions against the Company, and those actions may be more severe than those described 
above. Accordingly, the General Partner, the Investment Adviser, as the case may be, will seek to ensure that the 
Company does not default on any such capital call. There can, however, be no assurance that the Company will 
meet capital calls on a timely basis if one or more of the Shareholders defaults. 
25.30 
In addition, as a result of a Shareholder's failure to comply with a Drawdown Notice, other Shareholders may be 
required to pay their Commitments earlier than would otherwise have been required. 
Distributions in kind 
25.31 It is possible that not all directly held Investments by a relevant Compartment will be realised by the end of the 
term or that one or more Investments may make in-kind distributions to a Compartment which that Compartment 
will not have liquidated prior to the end of the term. In that case, in the General Partner's discretion, there may, 
subject to Section 18.11, be in-kind distributions by the Company of securities, which may be illiquid. There can 
be no assurance that Shareholders will be able to dispose of these Investments or that the value of these 
Investments will ultimately be realised. 
Legal and tax risks in general 
25.32 
The Company must comply with various legal requirements, including securities laws and tax laws as imposed 
by the jurisdictions under which it operates. Should any of those laws change over the life of the Company, the 
legal requirement to which the Company and its Limited Shareholders may be subject, could differ materially 
from current requirements. 
25.33 
An investment in the Company involves complex tax considerations in Luxembourg, in the countries in which 
Investment assets are located, in countries in which a relevant Investor is domiciled or resident, and possibly in 
other countries. Some of these tax considerations will differ for particular investors. Among other things, 
investors may be subject to tax on income even if the Company or Compartment did not make any distribution. 
Depending on individual circumstances, the taxation treatment for direct or indirect Investors may differ from the 
guidance of Section 19 of the General Section and Investors should obtain advice from their own tax advisers 
regarding the tax implications for them of holding and disposing of Shares and receiving distributions in respect 
of the Shares.
