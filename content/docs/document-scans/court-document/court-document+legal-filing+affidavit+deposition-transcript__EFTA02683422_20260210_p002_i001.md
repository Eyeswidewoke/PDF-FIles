In case of uneven repartition of the shares A, my executor will ensure, by distributing the other assets 
"shares B and/or C and available hinds", that the equality between my children on a financial level be 
respected as much as possible. 
To that purpose, my executor will be authorized to submit the giving out of shares A to certain 
conditions and considerations and to the conclusion of a shareholders agreement. 
Moreover, my executor will ensure that the group be managed and developed in the same spirit and in 
accordance with the same principles as it had been by my father and I, in consultation with its directors. 
C/My executor will divide the shares of the company SAILING / YACHTS depending on the interests 
and wishes of my children so that the tradition of the yachts of my family branch continues. 
In case of collective disinterest, the company could be put into liquidation. 
D/My executor will have the most extensive and necessary powers of administration and disposal in 
order to perform her sharing mission. 
If necessary, I give her the seisin of all my assets. 
The mandate of my executor will last at least until the youngest of my children will reach 25 years. 
E/ I demand to my executor to apply the following rules: 
a) As far as the works of art and collections are concerned, my executor will draw up an inventory 
before the oldest child reaches 25 years. 
My executor will form lots in order to guarantee a strictly equally distribution which will take into 
account the specific interests of each of my children, who will be consulted in so far as the age 
and maturity of each of them will allow it. 
Insofar as possible, my executor will ensure that each collection stays gathered without any part 
separated. 
Moreover, I wish that, despite the sharing, the collections and works of art which are parts of the 
decoration of the CA and the Paris HP be kept there as long as my spouse will survive me and 
occupy these houses. 
Moreover, I forbid my children to alienate the works of art or works of collection being 
transferred to them before they completed their 25th year of age. 
b) As far as the real estate assets are concerned, my executor will draw up an inventory before the 
oldest child reaches 25 years. 
My executor will choose an equally distribution which will take into account the existing or to be 
constituted usufructs and the specific interests of each of my children, who will be consulted in 
so far as the age and maturity of each of them will allow it 
c) As for the shares of the company (Non Financial Group), I intend that takes place a sharing of 
the bare ownership of them into equal portions between my children, my executor being required 
to ensure that my children will conclude a shareholders agreement which will govern in particular 
the question of the distribution, when the time comes, of the rights of use pertaining to the real 
estate assets controlled by the company (Hotel & Resorts, Wineyard, Farms, Real Estate).
