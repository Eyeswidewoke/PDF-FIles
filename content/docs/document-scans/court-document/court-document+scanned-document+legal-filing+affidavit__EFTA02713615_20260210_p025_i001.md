his capital from the corresponding Capital Account, the unrecovered balance in such Loss 
Recovery Account will be proportionately reduced. Additional capital contributions will not 
affect any Loss Recovery Account. The effect of having the Loss Recovery Account is to 
reduce, only for purposes of calculating the Incentive Allocation, the amount of net gain for a 
particular period by any net loss for prior periods, and thereby to reduce the Incentive Allocation 
otherwise allocable during the later period. 
The Limited Partnership Agreement provides that the General Partner may amend the 
provisions of the Limited Partnership Agreement relating to the Incentive Allocation so that it 
conforms to any applicable requirements of the SEC and other regulatory authorities, so long as 
such amendment does not increase the Incentive Allocation chargeable to a Limited Partner for 
any fiscal year without that Limited Partner's consent. Moreover, the Limited Partnership 
Agreement provides that the General Partner may declare distributions from the Partnership to 
the Partners at any time. 
The General Partner shall have the right to fully or partially waive receipt of any 
Incentive Allocation with respect to one or more Limited Partners without notice to, or the 
consent of, the other Limited Partners. The Partnership, with the consent of the General Partner 
and/or the Investment Manager, as applicable, may also pay or allocate a portion of the General 
Partner's Incentive Allocation and/or the Management Fees due to the Investment Manager (as 
described below), to one or more third parties (including affiliates of the Investment Manager 
and the General Partner) who refer investors to the Partnership or perform other services for the 
General Partner and/or Investment Manager. 
Sub-Accounts, generally: New Issues 
In the event the General Partner determines that, based upon tax or regulatory reasons, or 
any other reasons as to which the General Partner and a Limited Partner agree, such Limited 
Partner should not participate in the net capital appreciation or net capital depreciation, if any, 
attributable to trading in any security, type of security or to any other transaction, the Limited 
Partnership Agreement permits the General Partner to allocate such net capital appreciation and 
net capital depreciation only to the Capital Accounts of the Partners to whom such reasons do not 
apply. In addition, if for any of the reasons described above or below, the General Partner 
determines that a Limited Partner should have no interest whatsoever in a particular security, 
type of security or transaction, the Limited Partnership Agreement permits the General Partner, 
without the consent of the Limited Partners, to set forth the interests in any such security in a 
separate memorandum account and the net capital appreciation and net capital depreciation for 
each such memorandum account shall be separately calculated. 
Without limiting the reasons for establishing a separate memorandum account, one 
reason would be restrictions upon certain Limited Partners participating in so-called "new 
issues" — initial public offerings of equity securities. The General Partner may, in its discretion, 
establish a separate memorandum account so that the following Limited Partners will not be 
allocated any share (or, if applicable, a reduced share) of the Partnership's investments in "new 
issues": (i) Limited Partners who are not permitted, or who may not be permitted under certain 
circumstances, to participate in profits resulting from "new issues" under rules of the Financial 
Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. ("FINRA"); (ii) Limited Partners who fail to provide the
