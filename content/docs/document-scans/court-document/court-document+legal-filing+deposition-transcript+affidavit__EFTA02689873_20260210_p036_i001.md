(a) 
monies comprising capital proceeds received by that Compartment from underwriting transactions and 
Bridging Investments (up to the amount of their acquisition cost in each case) made by that 
Compartment where such commitments or Investments lapse or are sold down in whole or in part 
within twelve (12) months of the making of the commitment or Bridging Investment; 
(b) 
monies comprising capital proceeds received by that Compartment on the realisation of any Investment 
arising within twelve (12) months of the making of the Investment (up to the amount of its acquisition 
cost); 
(c) 
a prospective investment in an Investment which does not proceed to completion; 
the disposal of an Investment where either (X) a claim has been made under any indemnities, warranties 
or other obligations undertaken by the Company for that Compartment in relation to that Investment or 
(Z) distributions made, or capital returned, by that Investment to the Compartment are recalled by that 
Investment for whatever purposes in accordance with the governing documents of that Investment (an 
Underlying Claim): or 
(e) 
the repayment of sums drawn down for the purposes of meeting Expenses where such sums arc not 
required for such purpose; 
(such amounts being Re-investment Cash) shall, subject to Section 18.9 below, increase each Investor's 
Undrawn Commitments by an amount equal to the amount of Re-investment Cash returned and such amounts 
shall be available for further drawdown in accordance with the provisions governing drawdowns from Investors 
in the relevant Compartment. 
18.9 
In relation to the amounts of Re-investment Cash: 
(a) 
only amounts up to the returned Capital Contributions and no other amounts derived from the relevant 
Investment shall be Re-investment Cash; 
in relation to Re-investment Cash to be redrawn due to an Underlying Claim, all such amounts: 
(i) 
shall be re-advanced by the Investors to the relevant Compartment pro rata to the 
distributions received by each of them in relation to the relevant Investment; 
(b) 
(ii) 
may only be re-advanced to satisfy an Underlying Claim which relates to the Investment from 
which the Re-investment Cash was received; and 
(iii) 
may only be re-advanced within three years after the distribution of the Re-investment Cash 
from that relevant Investment. 
18.10 
Where the General Partner is aware at the time of the distribution of Re-investment Cash that such Re-
investment Cash may be subject to recall under Sections 18.8 and 18.9 of the General Section then it will use 
commercially reasonable efforts to notify the Investors at the time of distribution of such possibility. 
Distribution in kind 
18.11 
The Company will in principle not make distributions in kind. However, the Company may distribute assets in 
kind to the extent a Compartment receives in kind distributions from Investment(s). To the extent practicable, 
however, such assets will not be distributed (other than in connection with liquidating distributions) unless they 
arc readily marketable. Assets distributed to the Investors in kind will be valued at the time of such distribution 
by the General Partner in good faith, taking account of such factors as it deems relevant and in view of the fair 
and equal treatment of Investors. When distributions are made in kind, they will be treated as cash distributions 
for purposes of applying the distribution provisions.
