(e) 
the Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise or to honor any of the 
rights or powers vested in it by this Indenture at the request or direction of any of the 
Securityholders pursuant to this Indenture, unless such Securityholders shall have offered to the 
Trustee reasonable security or indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities (including 
legal fees) which might reasonably be incurred by it in compliance with such request or 
direction; 
(f) 
the Trustee shall not be bound to make any investigation into the facts or 
matters stated in any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, 
request, direction, consent, order, note or other paper or document, but the Trustee, in its 
discretion, may, and upon the written direction of a Majority of the Controlling Class or of a 
Rating Agency shall, make such further inquiry or investigation into such facts or matters as it 
may see fit or as it shall be directed, and the Trustee shall be entitled, on reasonable prior notice 
to the Co-Issuers and the Collateral Manager, to examine the books and records relating to the 
Notes and the Collateral, personally or by agent or attorney, during the Co-Issuers' or the 
Collateral Manager's normal business hours; provided that the Trustee shall, and shall cause its 
agents to, hold in confidence all such information, except (i) to the extent disclosure may be 
required by law by any regulatory authority and (ii) except to the extent that the Trustee, in its 
judgment, may determine that such disclosure is consistent with its obligations hereunder, 
(g) 
the Trustee may execute any of the trusts or powers hereunder or perform 
any duties hereunder either directly or by or through agents or attorneys; provided that the 
Trustee shall not be responsible for any misconduct or negligence on the part of any non-
Affiliated agent appointed (subject to the approval of the Collateral Manager, which approval 
shall not be unreasonably withheld) and supervised, or non-Affiliated attorney appointed, with 
due care by it hereunder; 
(h) 
the Trustee shall not be liable for any action it takes or omits to take in 
good faith that it reasonably believes to be authorized or within its rights or powers hereunder; 
(i) 
nothing herein shall be construed to impose an obligation on the part of 
the Trustee to recalculate, evaluate or verify any report, certificate or information received from 
the Issuer or Collateral Manager (unless and except to the extent otherwise expressly set forth 
herein); 
(j) 
to the extent any defined term hereunder, or any calculation required to be 
made or determined by the Trustee hereunder, is dependent upon or defined by reference to 
generally accepted accounting principles (as in effect in the United States of America) 
("GAAP"), the Trustee shall be entitled to request and receive (and rely upon) instruction from 
the Issuer or the accountants identified in the Accountants' Certificate (and in the absence of its 
receipt of timely instruction therefrom, shall be entitled to obtain instruction from an 
Independent accountant at the expense of the Issuer) as to the application of GAAP in such 
connection, in any instance; 
(k) 
the Trustee shall not be responsible or liable for the actions or omissions 
of, or any inaccuracies in the records of, any non-Affiliated custodian, clearing agency, common
