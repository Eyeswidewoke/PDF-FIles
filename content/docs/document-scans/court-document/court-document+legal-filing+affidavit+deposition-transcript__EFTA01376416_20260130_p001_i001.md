Section 5.3 
Collection of indebtedness and Suits for Enforcement by Trustee. 
If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, subject to Section 5.5, the Trustee 
may in its discretion, and shall upon written direction of the Requisite Noteholders, proceed to 
protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the Noteholders by such appropriate Proceedings 
as the Trustee shall deem most effectual (if no such direction is received by the Trustee) or as the 
Trustee may be directed by the Requisite Noteholders, to protect and enforce any such rights, 
whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in this Indenture or in aid of 
the exercise of any power granted herein, or to enforce any other proper remedy or legal or 
equitable right vested in the Trustee by this Indenture or by law. 
In case there shall be pending Proceedings relative to the Issuer or the Co-Issuer 
or any other obligor upon the Notes under the Bankruptcy Law or any other applicable 
bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law, or in case a receiver, assignee or trustee in 
bankruptcy or reorganization, liquidator, sequestrator or similar official shall have been 
appointed for or taken possession of the Issuer, the Co-Issuer or their respective property or such 
other obligor or its property, or in case of any other comparable Proceedings relative to the 
Issuer, the Co-Issuer or other obligor upon the Notes, or the creditors or property of the Issuer, 
the Co-Issuer or such other obligor, the Trustee, regardless of whether the principal of any Notes 
shall then be due and payable as therein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and regardless 
of whether the Trustee shall have made any demand pursuant to the provisions of this Section 
5.3, shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such Proceedings or otherwise: 
(a) 
to file and prove a claim or claims for the whole amount of principal and 
interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Notes upon direction by the Holders of such Notes, 
and to file such other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the 
claims of the Trustee (including any claim for reasonable compensation to the Trustee and each 
predecessor Trustee, and their respective agents, attorneys and counsel, and for reimbursement of 
all reasonable expenses and liabilities incurred, and all advances made, by the Trustee and each 
predecessor Trustee, except as a result of negligence or bad faith) and of the Noteholders allowed 
in any Proceedings relative to the Issuer, the Co-Issuer or other obligor upon the Notes or to the 
creditors or property of the Issuer, the Co-Issuer or such other obligor; 
(b) 
unless prohibited by applicable law and regulations, to vote on behalf of 
the Holders of the Notes, upon the direction of such Holders, in any election of a trustee or a 
standby trustee in arrangement, reorganization, liquidation or other bankruptcy or insolvency 
Proceedings or person performing similar functions in comparable Proceedings; and 
(c) 
to collect and receive any Cash or other property payable to or deliverable 
on any such claims, and to distribute all amounts received with respect to the claims of the 
Noteholders and of the Trustee on their behalf; and any trustee, receiver or liquidator, custodian 
or other similar official is hereby authorized by each of the Noteholders to make payments to the 
Trustee, and, in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of payments directly to the 
Noteholders, to pay to the Trustee such amounts as shall be sufficient to cover reasonable 
compensation to the Trustee, each predecessor Trustee and their respective agents, attorneys and 
counsel, and all other reasonable expenses and liabilities incurred, and all advances made, by the 
Trustee and each predecessor Trustee except as a result of negligence or bad faith.
