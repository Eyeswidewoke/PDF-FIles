Jeffrey --
Many thanks for dinner last night; I enjoyed meeting you. I think we agree on a very considerable range 
of issues. My own view is that Joyce is in his completeness, a greater writer than Nabokov, and I say this as someone 
who loves and cherishes Lolita</=pan>. There is nothing in all of world literature to compare with the Anna Livia 
Plurabelle section of Finnegan'= Wake -- nothing. What Joyce had that Nabokov lacked was the intimacy of his native 
language. Conrad lacked that intimacy, too, but he was an completely different kind of writer, closer to Naipaul in his 
method than to either Joyce or Nabokov, and so it didn't matter. 
I've attached to this e-mail a realistic operating budget for Inference for the next five years. I need those 
five years to make Inference<hpan> pre-eminent. Inference is a 501(C)3 corporation, of which I am the CEO. It is being 
run on a shoestring of $750,000. I need another fully professional hands-on editor, and I've entered a line item to that 
effect in the budget. I cannot do everything by myself. I've slotted Lawrence into the budget a= an editor-at-large, 
someone playing the same role as Shelly now plays. There is no reason that he must come to Paris, or to Europe; he 
could work easily from whatever gloomy exile he prefers. This is the way that I work with Shelly, and it works very well. 
The other expenses in the budget are those that I know from experience we are bound to incur. There is no evading 
them. To move Inference into a position of dominance, I need an annual operating budget of $2.1M. I am thus left with 
an annual shortfall of $1.4M, and I suspect that I will be left with this shortfall for the next five years. After that? There is 
no reason that Inference might not be spun off into another corporate format, or otherwise monetized. That remains to 
be done when it is appropiate to be done — in th= future. 
What I have not included in this operating budget is money set aside to open an office in China. Shelly & 
I have the right contacts, and I have developed some independent contacts in China on my own. I would know just who 
to call and just who to grease in the bureaucracy to start things in motion. I would need $1M to do everything that 
would need to be done. The China project, although important, is not as important as getting rid of my operating 
shortfall. 
Let me have your thoughts, the first step, I hope, in letting me have your money. 
Old Hose, which I am also enclosing with this e-mail, will give you an idea why I departed San Jose State 
University under a dark and somber cloud. 
Best, 
DDDDDDDD
