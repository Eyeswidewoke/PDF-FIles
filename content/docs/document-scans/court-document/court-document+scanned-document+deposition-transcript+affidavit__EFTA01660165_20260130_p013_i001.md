1299 (11th Cir. 2003) (scienter requirement discourages "unscrupulous enforcement" and 
clarifies §2422(b)). Directed towards those who commit "the most serious crimes against 
children," it cannot properly be used as a trap for the unwary, sweeping within its net all 
who may — even unwittingly and unintentionally — communicate or otherwise interact 
improperly with persons who turn out to be minors. 
A prosecution of Mr. Epstein would violate the teachings of Bailey and Panfil. As 
we believe we persuaded you at the June 26th meeting, Mr. Epstein never targeted minors. 
On the contrary, what he did — at worst — was akin to putting up a sign saying to all, come 
in if you are interested in giving a massage for $200. A few among those who accepted 
the general invitation may have in fact been under 18 (though they lied about that age and 
said they were 18), but that is, at its worst, comparable to "post[ing] messages for all 
internet users, either adults or children, to seek out and read at their discretion," which the 
courts have held does not violate §2422(b). 
Thus, for this reason as well, Mr. Epstein's case is far outside the parameters of 
the §2422(b) cases that have been prosecuted. A key factor common to cases brought 
under §2422(b) is not present here: Prosecutions under this statute have focused on a 
sexual predator who used the intemet to identify and to communicate with a child or 
purported child (or a person with influence over such child or purported child), and did so 
with the intent to arrange to engage in sexual activity with the child, with MI knowledge 
that sexual activity with an individual of that age was illegal. In light of this common and 
well-accepted understanding, the eases decided under §2422(b) take as a given that its 
proper application lies only where the defendant knows or believes the person with whom 
he is interacting is a child. 
Virtually all of the prosecutions brought under §2422(b) resulting in published 
decisions have involved undercover "sting" operations, involving an essentially standard 
fact pattern in which over an extended period of time and in the course of multiple 
conversations on line an undercover agent pretends to be a young teenager. In each of the 
cases, the prosecution had, from the very words used by the defendant, an all but 
irrefutable case showing the clear knowledge and intent of the defendant. A prototypical 
case is United States v. Farner, 251 F.3d 510 (5th Cir. 2001), where the defendant 
participated, over time, in instant messaging, e-mail, and follow-up telephone calls with a 
person who identified herself as 14 years old, engaged in explicit intend conversation, 
sent her pornographic pictures, persuaded her to meet with him for sexual activity, 
arranged such a meeting, and traveled to the meeting place. The Fifth Circuit held that
