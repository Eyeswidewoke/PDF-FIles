Amendment No. 3 to Form S-1 
Tabk of Contents 
SAFEWAY INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
Rent Holidays. 
Certain of the Company's operating leases contain rent holidays. For these leases, Safeway recognizes the 
related rent expense on a straight-line basis starting at the earlier of the first rent payment or the date of possession of the leased 
property. The difference between the amounts charged to expense and the rent paid is recorded as deferred lease incentives and 
amortized over the lease term. 
Income Taxes Income tax expense or benefit reflects the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year, the impact of 
deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets, accrued interest on tax deficiencies and refunds and accrued penalties on tax 
deficiencies. Deferred income taxes represent future net tax effects resulting from temporary differences between the financial statement 
and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. 
A valuation allowance is established for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that these items will either expire before the 
Company is able to realize their benefits, or that future deductibility is uncertain. Periodically, the valuation allowance is reviewed and 
adjusted based on management's assessments of realizable deferred tax assets. 
Tax positions are recognized when they are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination. The amount recognized is 
measured as the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not of being realized upon settlement. The Company is subject to 
periodic audits by the Internal Revenue Service and other foreign, state and local taxing authorities. These audits may challenge certain 
of the Company's tax positions such as the timing and amount of income and deductions and the allocation of taxable income to various 
tax jurisdictions. The Company evaluates its tax positions and establishes liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting 
guidance on uncertainty in income taxes. These tax uncertainties are reviewed as facts and circumstances change and are adjusted 
accordingly. This requires significant management judgment in estimating final outcomes. Actual results could materially differ from these 
estimates and could significantly affect the Company's effective tax rate and cash flows in future years. 
Financial Instruments 
Interest rate swaps. 
The Company has, from time to time, entered into interest rate swap agreements to change its portfolio mix 
of fixed- and floating-rate debt to more desirable levels. Interest rate swap agreements involve the exchange with a counterparty of fixed-
and floating-rate interest payments periodically over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional principal 
amounts. The differential to be paid or received is recognized over the life of the agreements as an adjustment to interest expense. The 
Company's counterparties have been major financial institutions. 
Energy contracts. 
The Company has entered into contracts to purchase electricity and natural gas at fixed prices for a portion of 
its energy needs. Safeway expects to take delivery of the electricity and natural gas in the normal course of business. Contracts that 
qualify for the normal purchase exception under derivatives and hedging accounting guidance are not marked to market. Energy 
purchased under these contracts is expensed as delivered. 
Fair Value of Financial Instruments Disclosures of the fair value of certain financial instruments are required, whether or not 
recognized in the balance sheet. The Company estimated the fair values
