Important: Please read this appendix (continued) 
3. 1 understand that DBSI has policies which may be more restrictive than or impose requirements in addition to those 
of the Exchanges, FINRA or the New York Stock Exchange. I agree to abide by such policies as a condition of doing 
business with OBSI. I understand that these policies include but are not limited to the following: 
• Settlement date for all option trades is the business day following trade date. Notwithstanding this provision, DBSI 
may, in its discretion, elect not to accept purchase orders in options unless cash equal to the purchase price has first 
been deposited in my account and may elect not to accept opening sale orders in options unless I have first deposited 
in my account either the required margin or unrestricted negotiable shares of the underlying stock in an amount 
specified by DBSI. 
• OBSI may refuse orders to trade options in my account if there are restrictions against my account, including 
restrictions regarding trading in the underlying security, or for any other reason, at its discretion. 
• OBSI has set trading and exercise deadlines which correspond to deadlines established by the OCC and will accept no 
responsibility for completion of orders entered by clients after such deadline. 
• Margin, either in cash or securities, posted by me against short option positions, may not be included in my margin account 
equity or interest computations. 0BS1 may, in turn, use these deposits to secure said short positions with the OCC. 
• Option exercise notices assigned to DBSI in respect of a short position in option contracts in customer accounts shall 
be allocated to customers of DBSI on an automated random basis. I understand that if I am assigned, the assignment 
will be processed as a sale (in the case of a call) or a purchase (in the case of a put), settling two business days from 
the date of assignment (except for non-equity options, which settle for cash on the day of assignment) and that I am 
obligated to deliver the underlying stock or required cash to DBSI no later than settlement date. 
4. I understand that margin requirements exist in connection with certain options and I agree to meet all margin calls as 
made by DBSI. I understand that D851 in computing the margin requirements for option positions, may impose a higher 
margin requirement for individual option positions than other investment firms, and that DBSI will inform me of its 
existing margin requirements for option positions upon request. In the event I do not meet margin calls promptly, DBSI 
is authorized, in its sole discretion and without notification to me, to take any and all steps necessary to protect itself in 
connection with put and/or call transactions made for my account, including the right to buy and/or sell short, or short 
exempt, for my account and risk any part or all of the shares represented by options endorsed by DBSI for my account, or 
to buy for my account and risk any puts and/or calls as DBSI may deem necessary for its protection. I further agree that 
any and all expenses incurred by DBSI in this connection will be reimbursed by me. 
5. This agreement shall apply to all option orders for my/our account, whether or not such orders are executed. 
6. I understand that options may be listed on one or more Exchanges and that if no Exchange is specified by me, DBSI will 
use its discretion in routing my order(s). 
7. I hereby authorize you in your sole discretion and with notification to me (or in the event of my death, without notification to 
representatives of my estate or to my heirs) whenever you deem it necessary for your protection, to take such action, including, 
without limitation, to buy, sell or sell short for my account(s) and my risk, puts, calls, or other forms of options and/or to buy, 
selt or sell short any part or all of the underlying securities represented by options endorsed by you for my account(s). Any and 
all expenses, including, without limitation attorneys fees and their reasonable disbursements, incurred by you in connection 
with such transactions will be reimbursed by me or by my estate. 
8. You are under no obligation to convey to me any information relating to the underlying securities covered by an option or 
any securities related thereto, or any information relating to options whether such information is then or thereafter known 
or available. Any information, advice or notification in respect to any option or any underlying securities or securities relating 
thereto which you may give me and which you are not required to give by the terms of this agreement or any other agreement, 
expressed or implied, shall not be construed as creating an implied agreement or course of dealing between us and shall not 
impair the provisions of this or any other agreement between us. 
9. This agreement and its enforcement shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York and its provisions shall be 
continuous; shall cover all options transactions hereunder, whether you are acting as broker or principal, and all accounts. 
individually and collectively, which I may open or re-open with you; shall inure to the benefit of your present organization, 
its successors and assigns; and shall be binding upon me and my estate, executors, administrators and assigns, but no 
assignment shall release me from any of my obligations hereunder. Written notice of revocations of this agreement shall not 
release either of us from any obligations hereunder arising prior to the actual receipt of such notice by the other. 
10. Whenever any law or regulation is adopted which affects or is inconsistent with any provision hereof, such provision shall 
be deemed modified or superseded, as the case may be, by such law or regulation, and such provisions as so modified or 
superseded and all other provisions hereof shall in all respects continue in full force and effect. All other agreements existing 
between us or hereafter made which, by their provisions apply to any of my transactions and accounts with you, shall be 
applicable to any of my options transactions and accounts where they are not in conflict with this agreement. Should such a 
conflict exist it shall be resolved in favor of this agreement. Otherwise, the provisions of each agreement shall be applicable. 
11. As used herein, "r and "me refers to all account owners. "You" and "Your" refers to DBSI.
