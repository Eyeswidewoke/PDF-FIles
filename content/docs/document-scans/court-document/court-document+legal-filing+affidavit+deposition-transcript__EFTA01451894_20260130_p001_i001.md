SOF III - 1081 Southern Financial LLC 
The Offshore Feeder Fund 
In determining beneficial ownership of an interest in the Offshore Feeder Fund, an interest 
held by (i) a partnership or entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax 
purposes or (ii) a PFIC, will be considered beneficially owned by its partners or equity 
holders, as the case may be. An interest held by any corporation other than a PFIC will be 
treated as held by a shareholder beneficially owning 50% or more of the stock of such 
corporation, measured by value. In addition, a holder of an option to acquire an interest 
will be treated as the beneficial owner of the underlying interest. As discussed above, the 
Offshore Feeder Fund is designed for Investors that are either (i) not "U.S. persons" as 
defined in Rule 902 under the Securities Act, as amended, and not U.S. Holders, or (ii) U.S. 
Tax-Exempt Investors that do not wish to receive UBTI but that are willing to have their 
income from an investment in the Offshore Feeder Fund potentially be subject to greater 
rates of withholding or other taxes as compared to the Onshore Feeder Fund. Investors that 
meet neither of the two foregoing definitions are "U.S. Taxable Investors." It is intended 
that no U.S. Taxable Investors will invest in interests in the Offshore Feeder Fund. Any 
U.S. Taxable Investor that does so could become subject to adverse U.S. federal income 
tax consequences. 
U.S. Taxation of the Offshore Feeder Fund. The Offshore Feeder Fund will elect to be 
treated as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes and will invest all of 
its assets available for investment (i.e., all assets not used or reserved for expenses of the 
Offshore Feeder Fund) in the Onshore Feeder Fund. 
A foreign corporation (other than a dealer in securities) that engages in the United States, 
directly or indirectly, in investing in or trading securities (including contracts or options to 
buy or sell securities) for its own account is not deemed to be engaged in a U.S. trade or 
business if it meets certain requirements relating to the conduct of its business. No 
assurance can be given that Master Fund (and consequently the Onshore Feeder Fund and 
the Offshore Feeder Fund) would conduct their activities in such a way as to meet these 
requirements. 
Among other things, it is possible that the Master Fund may make 
investments in flow-through entities that are themselves engaged in a U.S. trade or 
business, which would result in the Onshore Feeder Fund, and consequently the Offshore 
Feeder Fund, being treated as engaged in a U.S. trade or business and would give rise to 
effectively connected income with the consequences described herein. Further, the 
Offshore Feeder Fund will be subject to U.S. withholding taxes in respect of U.S. source 
income, if any, as described in more detail below, and, to the extent that the Offshore 
Feeder Fund earns any U.S. source fee income, it may be subject to tax on a net income 
basis in respect of such fee income. 
If the Master Fund were treated as engaged in a U.S. trade or business (including from an 
investment in "U.S. real property holding corporations"), the Master Fund's effectively 
connected income would be subject to U.S. federal income tax and possibly to a branch 
profits tax of 30% as well. The imposition of such taxes would materially affect the Master 
Fund's (and therefore the Onshore Feeder Fund's and the Offshore Feeder Fund's) ability 
to make distributions to Investors. In addition, the Offshore Feeder Fund may be deemed 
to be engaged in a trade or business in the United States as a result of break-up fees,
