Aharonot chose 'The Fire Intifada' as a main headline for many hours, and afterwards 
replaced it with a headline no less foolish - 'The Israeli Security Agency is Investigating: Fire 
Terror.' The incitement was not only on a news website, but rather included most of the 
Israeli media. What stands out in the announcements and leaks to the Israeli media is the 
talk not only about perpetrators but rather also about those who are termed 'inciters' to 
arson (i.e., several Palestinian suspects have been arrested for calling for arson attacks on 
social media)."

3 - "What is burning are our [Palestinian] trees and our historical Palestinian land" (Fatah) 
Headline: "Fatah: What is burning are our trees and our historical Palestinian land" them 
"In a statement it published today, the Fatah Movement emphasized the Palestinian identity 
of all the Palestinian trees and stones that are burning right now, which are part of our 
historical Palestine. The statement warned the Israeli government not to take advantage of 
this event in a way that serves it by accusing Palestinian bodies of standing behind the fires. 
Head of the Information Committee of the Fatah [Mobilization and Organization Commission] 
Munir Al-Jaghoub said that [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu's government must 
clearly understand the sanctity of the Palestinian's belonging to his land and trees. 
The statement warned against... the irresponsible responses on the social networks, which 
include meanings and content as if the Palestinians are dancing over the flames that are 
spreading within Israel. The statement called on everyone to show historical responsibility 
and not to use language and terms that are far from the historical heritage and from the 
Palestinian right to the land that faces fires in the Interior (i.e., Palestinian term for Israel)."

4 - Israel's difficulty with the fires is sign of weakness and that "nakedness of the Israeli 
death state has been exposed." (Op-ed in the official PA daily) 
Excerpt of an op-ed by Omar Hilmi Al-Ghoul, regular columnist of the official PA daily 
Headline: "The fragility of the [Israeli] home front" 
"The fires that are spreading in the greater part of historical Palestine (i.e. Israel) upon 
which arose the Israeli colonialist state - have exposed the collapse of the status of the 
State of Sparta (i.e., Israel, implying violence and militarism). 
This is not the first time that the nakedness of the Israeli death state has been exposed. The 
fires have exposed the fragility of the [Israeli] home front and the helplessness of the state 
that is armed to the teeth with a military arsenal that surpasses its demographic capabilities. 
Several years ago (i.e., 2010), when the fires broke out on Mount Carmel in Haifa, it became 
clear that the [Israeli] Civil Defense Forces have become weak and are unable to carry out 
the minimum that is demanded of them and that they are charged with. And now, for three 
days Israel has been witness to a long series of fires - 220 in number - throughout the length 
and breadth of the land, which have been focused in Haifa and Tel Aviv (sic., Haifa and 
Jerusalem have been major centers)... An emergency situation has been declared... In an 
attempt by the Israeli government to calm the anger in the Israeli public, [Israeli] Prime 
Minister [Benjamin] Netanyahu, the Israeli Security Agency, and the minister of public
