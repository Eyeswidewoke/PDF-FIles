GLDUS137 Forrestal Capital LLC 
a number of instances in recent years in which pooled investment vehicles investing in third-party fluids 
have incurred substantial losses due to sponsor misconduct. The Partnership Agreement will provide %r 
indemnification of the General Partner, the Investment Manager, the Administrator, the Custodian and 
certain of their affiliates and certain other indemnified parties and any such indemnification (and the 
expense thereof) will be in addition to any indemnification granted wider the Underlying Fund constituent 
documents. Investors in the Access Fund may be required to return amounts distributed to them by the 
Access Fund to fund the Access Fund's and/or the Underlying Fund's indemnity obligations and other 
liabilities as well as amounts recalled by the Underlying Fund for reinvestment in accordance with the 
Underlying Fund LPA, subject to certain exceptions and restrictions set forth in the Partnership Agreement. 
In addition, capital contributions to fund the Access Fund's indemnity obligations are outside of a Limited 
Partner's Subscription. Investors in the Access Fund may receive in-kind distributions to the extent the 
Underlying Fund distributes securities in-kind to its investors and the securities or other assets so received 
in an in-kind distribution may not be marketable or otherwise freely tradable. With respect to any such 
securities or other assets distributed in-kind, the risk of loss and delay in liquidating these securities or 
assets will be bome by the Limited Partners of the Access Fund, with the result that such Limited Partners 
may receive less cash than reflected in the fair value of such securities as determined by the General Partner 
pursuant to the Partnership Agreement. 
By making the Access Fund available, neither the General Partner, the Investment Manager nor any of their 
affiliates is providing investment advice or making any recommendation as to the advisability of an 
investment in the Access Fund or the Underlying Fund. None of the General Partner, the Investment 
Manager, nor any of their respective affiliates and personnel are required to devote all or any specified 
portion of their time to managing the Access Fund's affairs, or from engaging in any other business 
activities, whether or not competitive with the Access Fund. Each prospective investor in the Access 
Fund should consult with its own counsel and advisors as to all legal, tax, financial and related risks 
and conflicts concerning an investment in the Access Fund. 
The General Partner cannot currently predict the timing and amounts of the capital contributions that will 
be required to be made by Limited Partners to the Access Fund. Such capital contributions may be called 
on an irregular basis. The General Partner may require each Limited Partner to make a capital contribution 
to the Access Fund on the date it is admitted to the Access Fund. The General Partner will provide written 
notice of the exact size and timing of such initial capital contribution, if any, in advance of such Initial 
Closing of the Access Fund. 
Co-Investment Opportunities. The Glendower GP may offer co-investment opportunities with respect to 
certain investments to be made by the Underlying Fund and may allocate any such opportunities among 
interested parties in the Glendower GP's sole discretion. The Access Fund will not participate in co-
investment opportunities, which may result in lower total returns realized by the Access Fund relative to 
other investors in the Underlying Fund who participate in co-investment opportunities. 
Compensation. iCapital Securities, LLC often receives a placement fee as a result of its placement of 
certain investors in certain private investment funds available via the iCapital Network ("iCapital Funds"). 
The prospect of receiving such compensation creates an incentive for iCapital Securities, LLC to place 
investors in the iCapital Funds from which it receives a placement fee or may in the future receive such a 
fee over other investment vehicles from which it does not receive a placement fee. With respect to this 
Access Fund, the Investment Manager will be entitled to receive an ongoing investor servicing fee from 
Glendower for services performed in respect of the Access Fund and its investment in the Underlying Fund 
based on the total capital commitment of the Access Fund to the Underlying Fund. Such fee will result in 
the Investment Manager having additional conflicts of interest with respect to the purchase of Interests by 
Proprietary and Confidential
