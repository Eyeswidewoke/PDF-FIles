Generally, an Underlying Fund will not be restricted from dealing with any particular 
counterparty. The Management Company's evaluation of the creditworthiness of a counterparty 
may not prove sufficient, and the lack of a complete and "foolproof' evaluation of the financial 
capabilities of a counterparty, and the absence of a regulated market to facilitate settlement, may 
increase the potential for losses by the Partnership. 
Some of the markets in which the Underlying Fund may effect transactions are not 
"exchange-based", such as "over-the-counter" or "interdealer" markets. The stability and liquidity 
of "over-the-counter" derivatives transactions depends in large part on the creditworthiness of the 
parties to the transactions. In the "over-the-counter" markets, the Underlying Fund enters into a 
contract directly with dealer counterparties which may expose the Underlying Fund to the risk that 
a counterparty will not settle a transaction in accordance with its terms because of a solvency or 
liquidity problem with the counterparty which failure would likely result in a loss to the Underlying 
Fund. Delays in settlement may also result from disputes over the terms of the contract (whether 
or not bona fide). These "counterparty risks" are accentuated for contracts with longer maturities, 
where events may intervene to prevent settlement. In addition, the Underlying Fund may have a 
concentrated risk in a particular counterparty, which may mean that if such counterparty were to 
become insolvent or have a liquidity problem, losses would be greater than if the Underlying Fund 
had entered into contracts with multiple counterparties. Certain "over-the-counter" derivative 
contracts require that the Underlying Fund post collateral and a counterparty may breach its 
obligation to return that collateral. 
If there is a default by a counterparty, the Underlying Fund under most normal 
circumstances will have contractual remedies pursuant to the agreements related to the transaction. 
However, exercising such contractual rights may involve delays or costs which could result in the 
net asset value of the Underlying Fund being less than if the Underlying Fund had not entered into 
the transaction. Furthermore, there is a risk that any of such counterparties could become insolvent 
and/or the subject of insolvency proceedings. In such case, the recovery of the Underlying Fund's 
assets from such counterparty or the payment of claims therefor may be significantly delayed and 
the Underlying Fund may recover substantially less than the full value of the assets entrusted to 
such counterparty. In addition, there are often changes to the bankruptcy laws, custody and dealer 
rules and legal interpretations applied by courts that may impact insolvency proceedings and may 
impact whether the Underlying Fund may terminate its agreement with an insolvent counterparty 
or the timing of that termination. 
Collateral that the Underlying Fund posts to its counterparties that is not segregated with a 
third party custodian may not have the benefit of customer-protected "segregation" of such funds. 
In the event that a counterparty were to become insolvent, the Underlying Fund may become 
subject to the risk that it may not receive the return of its collateral or that the collateral may take 
some time to return. 
In addition, the Underlying Fund may use counterparties including sub-custodians located 
in jurisdictions outside the United States. Such local counterparties usually are subject to laws and 
regulations in non-U.S. jurisdictions that are designed to protect customers in the event of their 
insolvency. However, the practical effect of these laws and their application to the Underlying 
Fund's assets are subject to substantial limitations and uncertainties. Because of the range of 
possible factual scenarios involving the insolvency of a counterparty and the potentially large
