Taxation of Partnership Operations 
As a partnership, the Partnership is not itself subject to U.S. federal income tax but is 
required to file an annual partnership information return with the Service. Each Limited Partner 
is required to report separately on his income tax return his distributive share of the Partnership's 
net long-term and short-term capital gains or losses, ordinary income or loss, deductions and 
credits. The Partnership may utilize a variety of trading strategies which produce short-term and 
long-term capital gains (or losses), as well as ordinary income (or loss). As promptly as 
practicable after the end of each year, the Partnership will send annually to each Limited Partner 
a form showing his distributive share of the Partnership's items of income, gains, losses, 
deductions and credits. 
A Limited Partner will be required to take such items of income and loss into account in 
the taxable year of the Limited Partner in which or with which the taxable year of the Partnership 
ends. Each Limited Partner will be subject to tax, and liable for such tax, on his distributive 
share of the Partnership's taxable income regardless of whether the Limited Partner has received 
or will receive any distribution of cash from the Partnership. Thus, in any particular year, a 
Limited Partner's distributive share of taxable income from the Partnership (and, possibly, the 
taxes imposed on that income) could exceed the amount of cash, if any, such Limited Partner 
receives or is entitled to withdraw from the Partnership. 
Under Section 704 of the Code, a Limited Partner's distributive share of any Partnership 
item of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit is governed by the Limited Partnership Agreement 
unless the allocations provided by the Limited Partnership Agreement do not have "substantial 
economic effect." The Regulations promulgated under Section 704(b) of the Code provide 
certain "safe harbors" with respect to allocations which, under the Regulations, will be deemed 
to have substantial economic effect. The validity of an allocation which does not satisfy any of 
the "safe harbors" of these Regulations is determined by taking into account all facts and 
circumstances relating to the economic arrangements among the partners. While no assurance 
can be given, it is intended that the allocations provided by the Limited Partnership Agreement 
should have substantial economic effect. However, if it were determined by the Service or 
otherwise that the allocations provided in the Limited Partnership Agreement with respect to a 
particular item (or items) do not have substantial economic effect, each Limited Partner's 
distributive share of that item (or items) would be determined for tax purposes in accordance 
with that Limited Partner's interest in the Partnership, taking into account all facts and 
circumstances. 
Cash distributions and withdrawals, to the extent they do not exceed a Limited Partner's 
basis in his interest in the Partnership, should not result in taxable income to that Limited 
Partner, but will reduce the Limited Partner's tax basis in the Partnership interest by the amount 
distributed or withdrawn. Cash distributed to a Limited Partner in excess of the basis in his 
Partnership interest is generally taxable as capital gain, but may be ordinary income in certain 
circumstances. A distribution of property other than cash generally will not result in taxable 
income or loss to the Limited Partner to whom it is distributed. 
The Limited Partnership Agreement provides that the General Partner may specially 
allocate items of Partnership income (or loss) to a Partner who makes a full or partial withdrawal
