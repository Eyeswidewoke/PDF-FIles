Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 
Draft — Not for Implementation 
235 
For drugs intended to be administered on an as-needed basis, the FDA recommends that 
236 
symptoms be assessed following each dose of the placebo and investigational drug. The length 
237 
of time after each dose when symptoms should be assessed should be based on the 
238 
investigational drug's expected duration of action, taking into account 
239 
pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationships. Including efficacy data from days when the 
240 
investigational drug is not used may increase the difficulty in detecting and attributing a 
241 
treatment difference to the drug, and is not recommended. For similar reasons, the FDA does not 
242 
recommend recall periods longer than 24 hours for an as-needed drug. A longer recall period 
243 
may make it more difficult for subjects to accurately reflect on symptoms because their recall 
244 
may be affected by symptoms that occurred on the days when the placebo and investigational 
245 
drug were not used. 
246 
247 
For drugs that are administered continuously, we also recommend shorter (e.g., daily or weekly) 
248 
recall periods with a 1-day lockout period for evaluation of primary endpoints such as desire or 
249 
arousal. 
250 
251 
2. 
Format of Data Capture 
252 
253 
Sponsors should specify the format used by subjects to record daily signs and symptoms, such as 
254 
an interactive voice response system (IVRS), electronic tablet, smartphone, personal digital 
255 
assistant, or paper diary. We prefer use of an electronic format with reminders or alarms, when 
256 
appropriate and feasible, to ensure real-time data capture and limit missing data, as well as to 
257 
accurately capture the timing of the assessment. Sponsors should address lockout of delayed 
258 
entry (see section III.D.I., Recall Period) and frequency of downloads. In addition, sponsors 
259 
should be able to generate, upon request, accurate and completed copies of electronic records in a 
260 
form suitable for FDA review and inspection. 
261 
262 
Such a diary should capture, at a minimum, whether a sexual encounter occurred, whether the 
263 
investigational drug was taken, and any other information pertinent to the key efficacy endpoints. 
264 
Sponsors should account for the occurrence of multiple sexual encounters on the same day or 
265 
within a 24-hour period. Dosing times for drugs administered on an as-needed basis also should 
266 
be captured. The FDA recommends that the diary be submitted for review (e.g., screenshots, 
267 
script for IVRS) in advance of its use. 
268

3. 
Instruments for Measuring Patient-Reported Outcomes 
270 
271 
Phase 2 studies represent an important opportunity to evaluate measurement properties of PRO 
272 
instruments. Therefore, piloting the instrument and obtaining results from such exploratory 
273 
studies can inform instrument design and the adequacy for use in the phase 3 trials. Before use 
274 
in phase 2 studies, it is important to establish that the questionnaire instructions and items are 
275 
interpreted by subjects as intended and that the items adequately cover the relevant symptoms 
276 
and are worded such that they do not overlap in their measurement concept. 
277 
278 
We strongly recommend that sponsors discuss the selection and implementation of proposed 
279 
PRO instruments with the FDA as early as possible during drug development. Two instruments 
280 
are discussed below. The FDA is open to considering other instruments to measure sexual desire
