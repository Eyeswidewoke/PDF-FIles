Hi, thanks for your reply. 
We are very, very concerned that y=u are not understanding and not getting help in understanding what is 
happeni=g with your finances. Your responses below only increase our concern. The three of us are not able to serve as 
financial advisors. We urge you strongly to speak directly with Max so that he can clarify what he says in the Memo and 
explain what the Promissory Note language means. 
Just to give you one example of ou= concern: You focus on one phrase: that the interest will be "=t the highest 
rate in effect." But you are taking those words out of =ontext. We really don't think we should be trying to explain 
these d=tails to you, but to try to summarize: this phrase applied to the double nature of the loan—the Marital Trust 
had to borrow money from Persh=ng to make the loan to you, until the Lexington house was sold. The phrase you quote 
applies only to that brief period, and has no impact on the interest accruing now or in the future. 
We can see why focusing on those s=x words would make you angry. But the six words mean nothing in and of 
themse=ves (i.e., what rate is "in effect"?). But instead of doi=g the logical thing—getting the full information—you are 
just so angry th=t you refuse to find out the truth. 
Again, this is just one example of=where you are stating conclusions based on faulty or incomplete information. 
There are explanations for your other issues as well (how the DNI is paid to you, how the interest payments can be 
made, etc) but rather than us trying to summarize the information for you here, we think it would make more sense for 
you to discuss them with the people who set all of this up, in the context of a broader conversation. Reading your 
response only redoubles our sense that you are simply misreading important elements of your entire financial situation, 
and that you are making big decisions based on faulty information. We feel that you have painted yourself into a corner, 
in which you arrive at the worst possible interpretation of complex legal language, and then refuse to speak with the 
very people who could explain it to you, and just get angry at them based on your misin=erpretations. 
We beg you once again to meet with=us and with the people who set up the Trust, the loan, etc., to clarify these 
issues. 
Love, Avi, Diane and Harry
