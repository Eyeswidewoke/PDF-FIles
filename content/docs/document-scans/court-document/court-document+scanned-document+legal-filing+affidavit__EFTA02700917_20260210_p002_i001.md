Prologue 
A Tale of Two Banks 
At the beginning of the nineteenth century the Vatican was sufficiently weak and isolated that 
Napoleon was able to kidnap the Pope and keep him prisoner in France for seven years. Even 
after the Papal States were restored to the Vatican by the Treaty of Vienna in 1815, the cost of 
financing its wartime debt so exceeded its paltry income that it was only saved from bankruptcy 
by the French government assuming part of the Vatican debt. Finally, in 1870, in the process of 
unifying Italy, King Emmanuel seized Rome and all the remaining territory of the Papal States 
and left the Pope, Pius IX, barricaded in his palace, a prisoner in the Vatican. Although the new 
Italian parliament passed a law offering modest compensation for all the Papal territories that had 
been expropriated, Pope Pius TX refused, saying "I need money badly but what do you bring me, 
a part of what you stole from me." That statement defined the Vatican position for the next six 
decades, as it negotiated with a succession of Italian governments with neither sovereign status 
nor money. 
The Popes only source of income during this period was an annual collection from Catholics 
around the world called Peter's Pence, which had been revived from the times of the Crusades. 
But Peter's Pence rarely exceeded a million dollars a year and, unable to further borrow to pay 
expenses, the Pope had to contain Vatican services as essential as the Sacred Roman Rota. 
Indeed, the Vatican was so impoverished by 1922 that it borrowed $100,000 from a local Roman 
bank to pay for the funeral of the Pope. 
Finally, on February 29, 1929, Pope Pius XI came to terms with the government of Benito 
Mussolini. In the agreement, called the Lateran Treaty, the Pope recognized that the Papal 
States, including Rome, were now part of Italy. In return, Mussolini accepted that a small parcel 
of land surrounding St. Peter's, called Vatican City, henceforth would be completely 
independent of the laws of Italy, and the Pope would be completely sovereign over this tiny 
territory. In addition, Mussolini awarded the Vatican compensation for the Papal property seized 
in 1870 of $52.4 million dollars in the form of long-term Italian bonds, paying 5% interest a year, 
and $39.7 million in cash. 
Although the Vatican became financially solvent for the first time in over a century, it had been 
now officially reduced from a lost kingdom occupying most of central Italy to a token city-state 
in a patch of Rome. To make it autonomous in fact as well as in law, the Pope immediately 
expended part of the cash from the settlement on constructing a railroad station, a telephone 
exchange, administration buildings, a courthouse, radio transmitters, a jail, printing presses, 
barracks for the Swiss Guard, and an electric power plant. 
None of this left the Vatican with much money. Aside from the Peter's Pence collection and the
