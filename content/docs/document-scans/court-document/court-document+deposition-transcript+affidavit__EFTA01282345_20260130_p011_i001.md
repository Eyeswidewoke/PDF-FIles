CUSTOMER IDENTIFICATION NOTICE 
To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law requires all financial 
institutions to obtain, verily. and record information that identifies each person who establishes an atCount, investment or 
other business relationship with a financial institution. This means that we will ask for your name, address, and other 
information that will allow us to identity you. We may also ask to see identifying documents such as a certificate of formation 
or good standing (legal entities) or a passport or other photo identification (individuals). 
3RD EU NOTICE 
Governmental rules have also broadened the scope of our firm's obligations to aid in the fight against money laundering 
and terrorist financing; these rules call for an active involvement of both asset management firms and their clients. For 
new and existing clients we currently have a legal obligation to ask our customers questions regarding their identities, 
addresses, source of funds and, it necessary, legal representatives, authorized signatories, beneficial owners or control 
structures and to collect requisite documentation to substantiate the information. Also, enhanced anti money laundering 
requirements require that should any of the above personal or institutional information change, our clients would be 
obliged to immediately notify us of the change(s) and provide us with relevant documentation to verify these changes.
