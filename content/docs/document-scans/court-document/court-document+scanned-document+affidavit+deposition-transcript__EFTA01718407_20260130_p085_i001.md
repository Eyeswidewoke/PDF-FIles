As was made clear at the outset, we did not review the facts, circumstances, or terms 
included in the plea offer, nor any allegations that individuals involved in the investigation 
engaged in misconduct. Despite that agreement, we note that your letters of April 8, April 28, 
and May 14 focus in large part on accusations of investigative or prosecutorial misconduct. Not 
only do allegations of prosecutorial misconduct fall outside the boundary of our arced review, 
they also fall outside the authority of the Criminal Division in the first instance. Simply, the 
Criminal Division does not investigate or resolve allegations of professional misconduct by 
federal prosecutors. For these reasons, we do not respond to the portion of those letters that 
discuss alleged misconduct. 
Based on our review of all of these materials, and after careful consideration of the issues, 
we conclude that U.S. Attorney Acosta could properly use his discretion to authorize prosecution 
in this case. We will briefly address each of the issues that you have raised. 
Knowledge of age. Federal child exploitation statutes differ as to whether there must be 
proof that the defendant was aware that the children were under the age of 18. However, even 
for those statutes where knowledge of age is an element of the offense, it is possible to satisfy 
that element with proof that the defendant was deliberately ignorant of facts which would suggest 
that the person was a minor. For that reason, the fact that some of the individuals allegedly lied 
to Mr. Epstein about their age is not dispositive of the issue. While there may be an open factual 
issue as to Mr. Epstein's knowledge, we cannot say that it would be impossible to prove 
knowledge of age for any such charges which require it. Therefore, Mr. Acosta could rightfully 
conclude that this factual issue is best resolved by a jury. 
Travel for the purpose. In the materials you prepared, you suggest that Mr. Epstein 
should not be charged with violating 18 U.S.C. § 2423(b) because his dominant purpose in going 
to Florida was not to engage in illegal sexual activity, but rather to return to one of his residences. 
While we fully understand your argument, we also find that the U.S. Attorney's office has a good 
faith basis fully to develop the facts on this issue and brief the law to permit a court to decide 
whether the law properly reaches such conduct. Mr. Acosta would not be abusing his discretion 
if he decided to pursue such a course of action. 
Intent to engage in the conduct at the time of travel. Based on our review of the facts of 
this case, we respectfully disagree that there is no evidence concerning Mr. Epstein's intent when 
he traveled, and when that intent was formed. Should Mr. Acosta elect to let the case proceed so 
that a jury can resolve this factual issue, lie would be within his discretion to do so. 
Use of a facility or means of interstate or foreign commerce. Much of the materials you 
have prepared and much of the meeting we had focused on 18 U.S.C. § 2422(b), specifically your 
contention that Mr. Epstein did not use the phone to coerce anyone to engage in illegal sexual 
activity. We understand the issue you raise concerning the statutory interpretation. As before, 
however, we cannot agree that there is no evidence that would support a charge under Section 
2422(b), nor can we agree that there is no argument in support of the application of that statute to 
this case. Finally, our assessment is that the application of that statute to these facts would not be
