According to your attorneys, it was at this point that Epstein allegedly proposed a 
solution, which involved a mutual release of claims by and between you and the trustees of the 
remainder trust. The settlement and mutual release provided that you would lose your right to 
income from the remainder trust while confirming that you would not assert any claim for being 
removed as a beneficiary of the trust, in exchange for the trustees agreeing to not seek to claw 
back any excess distributions of income.24 You confirmed to the Committee that you and the 
trustees both formally agreed to a mutual release of claims, with each side "receiving 
consideration."25 As a result of this scheme reportedly devised by Epstein, your tax advisors took 
the position that you no longer had the income rights from the remainder trust that would have 
caused the trust's assets to be included in your taxable estate (as outlined in Section 2036(a) 
(1)).26 Your tax advisors also took the position that this solution eliminated any potential risks of 
inclusion of the assets in your taxable estate arising from the three-year tail caused by Section 
2035(a). 
In order to fully understand the tax implications of the trust scheme devised with 
Epstein's assistance, Committee staff sent a set of follow up questions on the matter to your 
counsel on February 6, 2023. Unfortunately, you have refused to answer or provide information 
regarding several important tax-related questions arising from this transaction, including the 
following: 
■ 
First, you have refused to answer questions regarding the amount by which you were 
overpaid income by the trustees of the remainder trust. You have also refused to answer 
questions on the period in which these distributions occurred and how the amount of 
income that was over-distributed was calculated. The Committee is concerned by the 
possibility that you may have received impermissible distributions of income worth 
millions of dollars beyond that allowable by the terms of the remainder trust. 
■ 
Second, you have refused to answer questions related to the consideration provided to the 
trustees or the consideration provided by the trustees as part of the mutual release of 
claims. As such, the Committee has no idea what financial exchange or other 
consideration was provided in order to keep assets worth billions of dollars out of your 
taxable estate. It is possible that, if your release of a right to income from the remainder 
trust was for less than full and adequate consideration, such release of claims could 
constitute an additional taxable gift. 
■ 
Third, you have refused to answer questions on the extent to which you retained voting 
control of shares in Apollo and its partnerships while shifting those assets into the 
Z' Id. at pg. 3: "Mr. Epstein's solution contemplated a mutual release of these claims by and between Mr. Black, on 
the one hand, and the trustees of the remainder trust, on the other. The settlement and mutual release provided that 
Mr. Black would lose his income right, while confirming that he would not assert any claim for his removal as a 
beneficiary, in exchange for the trustees not pursuing claims to claw back the excess distributions." 
n Id. at pg. 3: "Both sides thus agreed to a formal release of these potential claims, with each side receiving 
consideration." 
16 Id. at pg. 3: "The ultimate result was that Mr. Black no longer had the income rights that would have potentially 
caused the trust's assets to be included in his estate at death, without risking estate inclusion under Section 
2035(a) (if he were to die within three years of the mutual releases)."
