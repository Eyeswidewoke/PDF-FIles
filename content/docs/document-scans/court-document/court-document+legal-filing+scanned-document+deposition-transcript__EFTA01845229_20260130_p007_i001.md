(c)1. The department shall notify the state attorney that the offender is being considered for 
placement in the reentry program. The notice must explain to the state attorney that a proposed reduced period 
of incarceration, followed by participation in substance abuse treatment and other rehabilitative programming, 
could produce the same deterrent effect otherwise expected from a lengthy incarceration. 
2. The notice must also state that the state attorney may notify the sentencing court in writing of any 
objection the state attorney might have if the nonviolent offender is placed in the reentry program. The state 
attorney must notify the sentencing court of his or her objections within 14 days after receiving the notice. 
(d) The sentencing court shall notify the department in writing of the court's decision to approve or 
disapprove the requested placement of the nonviolent offender no later than 28 days after the court receives the 
department's request to place the offender in the reentry program. Failure to notify the department of the courts 
decision within the 28-day period constitutes approval to place the offender into the reentry program. 
(4) After the nonviolent offender is admitted into the reentry program, he or she shall undergo a full 
substance abuse assessment to determine his or her substance abuse treatment needs. The offender shall also 
have an educational assessment, which shall be accomplished using the Test of Adult Basic Education or any 
other testing instrument approved by the Department of Education. Each offender who has not obtained a high 
school diploma shall be enrolled in an adult education program designed to aid the offender in improving his or 
her academic skills and eam a high school diploma. Further assessments of the offenders vocational skills and 
future career education shall be provided to the offender as needed. A periodic reevaluation shall be made in 
order to assess the progress of each offender. 
(5)(a) If a nonviolent offender in the reentry program becomes unmanageable, the department may 
revoke the offender's gain-time and place the offender in disciplinary confinement in accordance with 
department rule. Except as provided in paragraph (b), the offender shall be readmitted to the reentry program 
after completing the ordered discipline. Any period of time during which the offender is unable to participate in 
the reentry program shall be excluded from the specified time requirements in the reentry program. 
(b) 
The department may terminate an offender from the reentry program if: 
1. The offender commits or threatens to commit a violent act; 
2. The department determines that the offender is unable to participate in the reentry 
program 
due to the offenders medical condition; 
3. The offender's sentence is modified or expires; 
4. The department reassigns the offender's classification status; or 
5. The department determines that removing the offender from the reentry program is in the best 
interest of the offender or the security of the institution. 
(6)(a) The department shall submit a report to the court at least 30 days before the nonviolent 
offender is scheduled to complete the reentry program. The report must describe the offender's performance 
in the reentry program. If the performance is satisfactory, the court shall issue an order modifying the sentence 
imposed and place the offender on drug offender probation subject to the offender's successful completion of 
the remainder of the reentry program. The term of drug offender probation may include placement in a 
community residential or nonresidential substance abuse treatment facility under the jurisdiction of the 
department or the Department of Children and Family Services or any public or private entity providing such 
services. If the nonviolent offender violates the conditions of drug offender probation, the court may revoke 
probation and impose any sentence that it might have originally imposed. 
(b) If an offender being released pursuant to paragraph (a) intends to reside in a county that has 
established a post-adjudicatory drug court program as described in s. 397.334. Florida Statutes, the 
sentencing court may require the offender to successfully complete the post-adjudicatory drug court program 
as a condition of drug offender probation. The original sentencing court shall relinquish jurisdiction of the 
offenders case to the post-adjudicatory drug court program until the offender is no longer active in the
