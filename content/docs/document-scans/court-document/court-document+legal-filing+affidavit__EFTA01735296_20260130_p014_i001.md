The argument will be found in the skeleton argument on behalf of Mr Assange dated 4th February 2011 and the 
further argument dated 7th February 2011. It was also dealt with in the opening and closing address. 
Under scction 2(2) and (3) Extradition Act 2003 an arrest warrant must contain a statement that the Part I 
warrant is issued with a view to his arrest and extradition to the category I territory for the purpose of being 
prosecuted for the offence. (Alternatively under subsection 5 the statement should be one that the warrant is 
issued with a view to his arrest and extradition to the category 1 territory for the purpose of being sentenced for 
the offence or of serving a sentence of imprisonment ... it is common ground that subsection 5 does not apply 
here.) 
What is required by section 2 of the Act is an arrest warrant which contains a statement that the warrant is issued 
for the purpose of being prosecuted. The question has been considered in a number of earlier cases, including 
Trimk, Vg, Mighall, Patel and Atstatios. The defence argue that the EAW nowhere states unequivocally and 
without ambiguity that Mr Assange is sought for prosecution. The EAW was translated from Swedish into 
English by a translator appointed by the Swedish National Police Board. It begins "This warrant has been issued 
by a competent authority. I request that the person mentioned below be arrested and surrendered for the 
purposes of conducting a criminal prosecution or executing a custodial sentence or detention order". 
The English word "prosecution" is a translation from the Swedish "lagforing". This is, says the defence, a fatal 
ambiguity. A qualified and experienced linguist and translator, Christopher Brunski said this in a statement 
'The translation of the word "lagforing" as criminal prosecution in the EAW of 2nd December 2010 is too 
narrow. It is a general term which relates to the entire legal process and can be used in either civil or criminal 
context. It is something of an umbrella term that encompasses other stages and legal procedures that are more 
strictly defined in and of themselves. There are more precise terms for prosecution in Swedish, namely atala or 
aklaga, both meaning to prosecute or indict". 
So, says the defence, the warrant has not been issued specifically for prosecution. It has simply been issued for 
the purposes of legal proceedings. Nowhere in the warrant is the requested person referred to as an "accused". 
Similarly there is no reference to him ever having been charged or indicted. Because the warrant is equivocal, the 
court is entitled to examine extrinsic evidence. Moreover this is an exceptional cast because the prosecutor 
herself had made clear unequivocal public statements that no decision has been taken yet as to whether to 
prosecute Mr Assange and that the EAW has been issued for the purpose. Merely for questioning him further. 
However the defence did not accept that it is necessary to find that this is an exceptional case in order for the 
court to consider the evidence bearing on the subject. 
I am satisfied that there is no equivocal statement or ambiguity in the warrant. The English version of the 
warrant states that it is for the purposes of conducting a criminal prosecution or executing a custodial sentence 
or detention order. The warrant refers to offences, indicates the relevant provisions of Swedish criminal law; 
and identifies specific conduct against Mr Assange. There is simply nothing equivocal about the English version
