WHAT IS THIS LAWSUIT ABOUT? 
THE ALLEGATIONS 
The Litigation is currently pending before the Honorable Jed S. Rakoff in the United States District Court for the 
Southern District of New York (the "Court"). The initial complaint in this action was filed on November 24, 2022 and an 
amended complaint was filed on January 13, 2023 (the "Complaint"). 
Class Representative's Complaint alleges that Defendant violated §§ 1591(aX1), (2); 1591(d); 1594(c); and 1595 
of the TVPA and New York state law. More specifically, the Class Representative alleges that during the Class Period, 
Defendant provided Epstein and his associates with the ability to withdraw cash and access wire services despite knowing 
about Epstein's sex trafficking venture. Additionally, the Class Representative alleges Defendant helped Epstein and his 
associates avoid regulatory scrutiny and criminal prosecution through failing in Defendant's compliance and regulatory 
obligations so that Defendant could profit from Epstein and his associates. The Class Representative alleges that 
Defendant's conduct through its non-typical banking relationship with Epstein damaged victims of Epstein's sex trafficking 
venture. 
Defendant denies all of the Class Representative's claims, allegations, and contentions of fault, liability, 
wrongdoing, and damages. Defendant contends that they had a normal banking relationship with Epstein and no 
knowledge that Epstein was engaged in a sex trafficking venture during the time that he was a JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. 
client and that JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. did not engage in any conduct that resulted in harm to alleged victims of 
Epstein's sex trafficking venture. 
THE COURT HAS NOT RULED AS TO WHETHER DEFENDANT IS LIABLE TO CLASS REPRESENTATIVE 
OR TO THE CLASS. THIS NOTICE IS NOT INTENDED TO BE AN EXPRESSION OF ANY OPINION BY 
THE COURT WITH RESPECT TO THE TRUTH OF THE ALLEGATIONS IN THIS LITIGATION OR THE 
MERITS OF THE CLAIMS OR DEFENSES ASSERTED. THIS NOTICE IS SOLELY TO ADVISE YOU OF 
THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT OF THIS ACTION AND YOUR RIGHTS IN CONNECTION WITH THAT 
SETTLEMENT. 
PROCEDURAL HISTORY 
On February 7, 2023, Defendant moved to dismiss the Complaint. The Court granted in part and denied in part the 
motion on March 20, 2023. Defendant initially answered the Complaint on April 10, 2023. On April 28, 2023, the Class 
Representative moved for class certification. On June 12, 2023, the Court certified the Class. 
On May 30, 2023, the Settling Parties participated in a confidential mediation with experienced mediators in this 
area, including Layn Phillips of Phillips ADR and members of his team. The mediation was preceded by the submission of 
mediation statements by the Settling Parties. The Settling Parties engaged in good faith negotiations and reached an 
agreement in principle. The Settling Parties drafted a Confidential Term Sheet ("Term Sheet") memorializing their 
agreement to settle all Class Members' claims against JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. and end the Litigation. The Settling 
Parties executed the Term Sheet on June II, 2023. The Term Sheet included, among other things, the Settling Parties' 
agreement to settle and dismiss with prejudice the Litigation and grant full mutual releases in return for a cash payment of 
$290 million ($290,000,000) by and/or on behalf of the Bank for the benefit of Class Members, subject to the negotiation of 
the terms of a Stipulation of Settlement and approval by the Court. The Stipulation (together with the Exhibits thereto) 
reflects the final and binding agreement, and a compromise of all matters that are in dispute, between the Settling Parties. 
WHAT IS THE MONETARY VALUE OF THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT? 
The Settlement, if approved, will result in the creation of a cash settlement fund of $290 million. This fund, plus 
accrued interest and minus the costs of this Notice and all costs associated with the administration of the Settlement 
including attorneys' fees and expenses as approved by the Court, will be distributed to Eligible and Participating Class
