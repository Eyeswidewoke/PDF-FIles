HUBUS133 Alpha Group Capital 
Effect of Straddle Rules on Limited Partners' Securities Positions. The Service may treat 
certain positions in securities held (directly or indirectly) by a Partner and its indirect interest in 
similar securities held by the Partnership as "straddles" for Federal income tax purposes. Investors 
should consult their tax advisers regarding the application of the "straddle" rules to their 
investment in the Partnership. 
Limitation on Deductibility of Interest and Short Sale Expenses. 
For noncorporate 
taxpayers, Section 163(d) of the Code limits the deduction for "investment interest" (g, interest 
or short sale expenses for "indebtedness properly allocable to property held for investment"). 
Investment interest is not deductible in the current year to the extent that it exceeds the taxpayer's 
"net investment income," consisting of net gain and ordinary income derived from investments in 
the current year less certain directly connected expenses (other than interest or short sale expenses). 
For this purpose, Qualified Dividends and long-term capital gains are excluded from net 
investment income unless the taxpayer elects to pay tax on such amounts at ordinary income tax 
rates. 
For purposes of this provision, the Partnership's activities (other than certain activities that 
are treated as "passive activities" under Section 469 of the Code) will be treated as giving rise to 
investment income for a Limited Partner (other than a Limited Partner who materially participates 
in the Partnership's trade or business activities), and the investment interest limitation would apply 
to a noncorporate Limited Partner's share of the interest and short sale expenses attributable to the 
Partnership's operation. Such noncorporate Limited Partner would be denied a deduction for all 
or part of that portion of its distributive share of the Partnership's ordinary losses attributable to 
interest and short sale expenses unless it had sufficient investment income from all sources 
including the Partnership. A Limited Partner that could not deduct losses currently as a result of 
the application of Section 163(d) would be entitled to carry forward such losses to future years, 
subject to the same limitation. The investment interest limitation would also apply to interest paid 
by a noncorporate Limited Partner on money borrowed to finance its investment in the Partnership. 
Potential investors are advised to consult with their own tax advisers with respect to the application 
of the investment interest limitation in their particular tax situations. 
For each taxable year, Section 1277 of the Code limits the deduction of the portion of any 
interest expense on indebtedness incurred by a taxpayer to purchase or carry a security with market 
discount which exceeds the amount of interest (including original issue discount) includible in the 
taxpayer's gross income for such taxable year with respect to such security ("Net Interest 
Expense"). In any taxable year in which the taxpayer has Net Interest Expense with respect to a 
particular security, such Net Interest Expense is not deductible except to the extent that it exceeds 
the amount of market discount which accrued on the security during the portion of the taxable year 
during which the taxpayer held the security. Net Interest Expense which cannot be deducted in a 
particular taxable year under the rules described above can be carried forward and deducted in the 
year in which the taxpayer disposes of the security. Alternatively, at the taxpayer's election, such 
Net Interest Expense can be carried forward and deducted in a year prior to the disposition of the 
security, if any, in which the taxpayer has net interest income from the security. 
Section 1277 would apply to a Limited Partner's share of the Partnership's Net Interest 
Expense attributable to a security held by the Partnership with market discount. In such case, a 
Limited Partner would be denied a current deduction for all or part of that portion of its distributive
