Dear Noam, 
You are waiting for me to provide guidance as to how you can regain co=trol of the trust funds. My plan 
is to prepare a memo for you outlin=ng your options in light of the trust terms. I anticipate being able=to spend some 
time on this over the weekend, along with reviewing the drafts of your estate planning documents. O=ce I have sent the 
memo to you we can discuss your thoughts and we can the= respond to Max. Unfortunately this is a difficult situation, 
not simple a=d straightforward, because of the terms of the trust and fiduciary law applicable to trusts. Please see my 
e=ail of 10/17 for an explanation of some of the issues. 
In some situations a trust is drafted so that you would have the right=to remove and replace the trustee, 
and in doing so perhaps find a trustee =hat would not inquire so diligently as to your personal financial circumst=nces 
before making a principal distribution to you. In this regard, please refer to my email of 10/=7 where I summarize the 
trustee removal, resignation and appointment provi=ions. The trustees can both resign at any time. They appoint 
successors su=ject to your approval. If they agree to resign you can find a new independent trustee whom they can 
appoint. If=not, you can remove them but only with the approval of a majority of your =hildren. Do you think your 
daughters would agree to remove Max and Harry? 4 so you could then appoint a successor. You would need to find an 
independent trustee. I can help you craft = letter to your daughters if you think they might agree to do this. adiv> 
My one additional thought right now that I need to review more closely=is that Harry, not being the 
independent trustee, should not have a say in=the distribution decision. If there is nothing in the trust to contradict =his 
interpretation (I need to review the trust again) then Max alone has the power. However this would likely n=t change 
the analysis that Max believes he needs to go through since he is=accountable to all beneficiaries. He believes he needs 
some level of=financial information from you but in my view that does not need to be detailed. I can discuss with him 
wh=t level of detail would satisfy him; however, if my understanding is corre=t that you do not wish to provide him with 
any backup for his distribution=decision, then we should evaluate the removal option and any other strategies I may be 
able to come up with.t>=A0 
Unfortunately this is not a simple situation and I will do my best to =utline some additional options for 
you. In the meantime please let me know=your thoughts regarding the above. I am available for a call as well= at your 
convenience. 
Best, 
Deborah
