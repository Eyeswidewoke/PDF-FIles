S- ILA 
based on current provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), U.S. Treasury regulations promulgated 
thereunder, and administrative rulings and court decisions in effect as of the date hereof, all of which are subject to change at any 
time, possibly with retroactive effect. 
For purposes of this discussion, the term "non-U.S. holder" means a beneficial owner of our Class A common stock that is 
not, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a partnership or any of the following: 
• a citizen or resident of the United States; 
• a corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or organized in the 
United States or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof, or the District of Columbia; 
• an estate, the income of which is includible in gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes regardless of its source; 
or 
• a trust if (1) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and 
one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or (2) it has a valid election in 
effect under applicable U.S. Treasury regulations to be treated as a U.S. person for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 
If an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds shares of our common stock, 
the tax treatment of a person treated as a partner generally will depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the 
partnership. Persons that for U.S. federal income tax purposes are treated as a partner in a partnership holding shares of our Class 
A common stock should consult their tax advisors. 
This discussion assumes that a non-U.S. holder holds shares of our Class A common stock as a capital asset within the 
meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). This discussion does not address all aspects of 
U.S. federal income taxation that may be important to a non-U.S. holder in light of that holder's particular circumstances or that 
may be applicable to holders subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax law (including, for example, financial 
institutions, dealers in securities, traders in securities that elect mark-to-market treatment, insurance companies. tax-exempt 
entities, holders who acquired our Class A common stock pursuant to the exercise of employee stock options or otherwise as 
compensation, entities or arrangements treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes, holders liable for the 
alternative minimum tax, certain former citizens or former long-term residents of the United States, holders who hold our Class A 
common stock as part of a hedge, straddle, constructive sale, or conversion transaction, and holders who own or have owned 
(directly, indirectly, or constructively) 5% or more of our Class A common stock (by vote or value). In addition, this discussion does 
not address U.S. federal tax laws other than those pertaining to the U.S. federal income tax, nor does it address any aspects of the 
unearned income Medicare contribution tax pursuant to Section 1411 of the Code, or U.S. state, local, or non-U.S. taxes. 
Accordingly, prospective investors should consult with their own tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal, state, local, non-U.S. 
income, and other tax considerations of acquiring, holding, and disposing of shares of our Class A common stock.

THIS SUMMARY IS NOT INTENDED TO CONSTITUTE A COMPLETE DESCRIPTION OF ALL TAX 
CONSEQUENCES RELATING TO THE OWNERSHIP AND DISPOSITION OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK. 
WE RECOMMEND THAT PROSPECTIVE HOLDERS OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK CONSULT WITH THEIR 
TAX ADVISORS REGARDING THE TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM (INCLUDING THE APPLICATION AND 
EFFECT OF ANY STATE, LOCAL, NON-U.S. INCOME, AND OTHER TAX LAWS) OF THE OWNERSHIP AND 
DISPOSITION OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK. 
Dividends 
In general, any distributions we make to a non-U.S. holder with respect to its shares of our Class A common stock that 
constitute dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes will be subject to U.S. withholding tax at a rate of 30% of the gross 
amount (or a reduced rate prescribed by an applicable income tax treaty), unless the dividends are effectively connected with a 
trade or business carried on by the non-U.S. holder within the United States (and, if an income tax treaty applies, are attributable to 
a permanent establishment of the non-U.S. holder within the United States). A distribution will constitute a dividend for U.S. federal 
income tax purposes to the extent of our current or accumulated earnings and profits as determined for U.S. federal income tax 
purposes. Any distribution not constituting a dividend will be treated as first reducing the adjusted basis in the non-U.S. holder's 
shares of our Class A common stock and, to the extent it exceeds the adjusted basis in the non-U.S. holder's shares of our Class
