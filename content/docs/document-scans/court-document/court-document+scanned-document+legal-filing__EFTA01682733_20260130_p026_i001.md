_My close friend was his second son, Oliver, who is a conductor, who like his siblings was very close to 
his parents. In fact, the Gilmour family was a strange one. For England, that is. They actually all loved 
each other and got along. The only other one I know that's as close are the Somersets. Ian Gilmour 
dancing with Margaret Thatcher back in 1981 is a picture that will always remain in my mind. There 
was no love lost between them but I never heard either say something scurrilous about the other. The 
worse thing I heard Ian say about Lady T was that she lacked a sense of humour. When I told Lady T 
that Ian Gilmour was against a fifth runway at Heathrow because it made living nearby hell, she 
looked at me, smiled, and said one word:"0 Good." 0 Politics would be a far better profession to be 
involved with if people like Ian Gilmour and Maggie Thatcher were still active. Alas, things do not 
get better, although politicians keep promising that they will. Let's have more Gilmours and Thatchers 
and fewer Blairs and Camerons.

Age of consent 
 
 From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia 
While the phrase age of consent typically does not appear 
n legal statutes,[11 when used in relation to sexual activity, 
he age of consent is the minimum age at which a person is 
:considered to be legally competent of consenting to sexual 
- acts. This should not be confused with the age of majority, 
age of criminal responsibility, or the marriageable age. 
r 
— 
The age of consent varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. 
:11] The median seems to range from 14 to 16 years, but 
.aws stating ages ranging from 9 to 21 do exist. In many 
jurisdictions, age of consent is interpreted to mean mental 
ar functional age. Some jurisdictions forbid sexual activity . 
)utside of legal marriage completely. The relevant age may 
also vary by the type of sexual act, the sex of the actors, or 
)they restrictions such as abuse of a position of trust. Some 
jurisdictions may also make allowances for minors engaged 
.n sexual acts with each other, rather than a single age.

from a relatively low-level misdemeanor such as 
'corruption of a minor," to "statutory rape" (which is

There are many grey areas in this area of law, some 
'egarding unspecific and untried legislation, others brought 
about by debates regarding changing societal attitudes, and 
)thers due to conflicts between federal and state laws. 
These factors all make age of consent an often confusing 
mbject, and a topic of highly charged debatesill
