Am att=ching two related papers. Both from Science today. One describes in more detail the "elec=ronic second 
skin" and the other about "epidermal electron=cs." 
The au=hors acknowledge medical applications but they seem most interested in mak=ng this into game 
controllers. :) 
Tem=orary tattoos fitted with electronics make flexible, ultrathin sensorsc=u> 
By Kyle Niemeyer 
Modern=methods of measuring the body's activity, such as electroencephalograp=y (EEG), electrocardiography 
(ECG), and electromyography (EMG), use electr=cal signals to measure changes in brain, heart, and muscle activity, 
respectively. Unfortunately, they rely on bulk= and uncomfortable electrodes that are mounted using adhesive tape and 
con=uctive gel—or even needles. Because of this, these types of measur=ments are limited to research and hospital 
settings and typically used over short periods of time because the contact= can irritate skin. 
These =imitations may be at an end, however. New research published in Science describes technology that 
allows electrical measurements (an= other measurements, such as temperature and strain) using ultra-thin poly=ers 
with embedded circuit elements. These devices connect to skin without =dhesives, are practically unnoticeable, and can 
even be attached via temporary tattoo. 
All of=the necessary components of the devices, including electrodes, electronic =omponents, sensors, radio 
frequency communication components, and power su=plies, are set within an extremely thin (about 30 µm) elastic 
polyester sheet. The sheet has a low elast=c modulus (that is, it's flexible) and no noticeable mass (about 0.09 .), so you 
have a lightweight, stretchable membrane. 
Circui= elements (such as transistors, diodes, resistors) and sensors are constru=ted with typical materials like 
silicon and gallium arsenide, but are link=d using nanoribbon and micro/nanomembrane elements to allow extremely 
small but flexible designs. 
The au=hors refer to their approach as an "epidermal electronic system"=(EES), which is basically a fancy way of 
saying that the device matches th= physical properties of the skin (such as stiffness), and its thickness matches that of 
skin features (wrinkles, cre=ses, etc.). In fact, it adheres to skin only using van der Waals forces =80 the forces of 
attraction between atoms and molecules—so no ad=esive material is required. Between the flexibility and the lack of 
adhesive, you wouldn't really notice one of these =ttached. 
One of=the coolest aspects of this technology is the application method: temporar= (transfer) tattoo. Yes, the 
ones you used as a kid, where you hold the tr=nsfer sheet with the design onto your skin then dampen it to dissolve the 
sheet. Here, they used water-solu=le polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) sheets in the same manner. 
For a =ower supply, initial designs used silicon photovoltaic cells to generate e=ectricity, but these are limited to 
microwatts due to the small area. Rese=rchers also explored wireless inductive power, where an external transmission 
coil matches the resonance frequency=of a small inductive coil in the device (it's the same sort of tech th=t's used in 
wireless device chargers). This opens up the door for appl=cations that need more power than solar can provide, or for 
devices that work in low-light conditions (under cloth=ng, for example). The authors also suggest future electrical 
storage using=capacitors or batteries.
