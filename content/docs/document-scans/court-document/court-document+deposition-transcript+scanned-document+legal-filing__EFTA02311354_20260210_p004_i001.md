goals, and from time to time may also provide incentives to our travel counselors. Certain suppliers may also provide 
compensation to us for various marketing and administrative services that we perform for them, such as granting them 
access to our marketing channels, participating in marketing programs and supporting technology initiatives. In addition, 
we receive compensation from suppliers when customers use the American Express Card or other American Express 
products to pay for supplier products and services. From time to time we may enter into 
other business relationships with suppliers and these arrangements, including 
levels and types of compensation and incentives we receive, are subject to change. In identifying suppliers and 
recommending itineraries, we may consider a number of factors, including supplier availability and your preferences. 
The relationships we have with suppliers may also influence the suppliers we identify and the itineraries we recommend.
