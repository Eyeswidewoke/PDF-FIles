Lawrence Krauss 
Subject: Private and Confidential, =n response to our meeting. 
Dear Naimah et al: 
Attached you will =ind a letter from my attorney, along with a letter he sent to Buzzfeed =arlier in this week 
regarding the defamatory and false story they were =lanning on printing. The story was then published yesterday 
=orning. I =anted to add to his letter, to reiterate our concern about how your =ffice was planning to follow up on the 
false and defamatory third-party =negations from Buzzfeed. Because this was initiated by an =nline entertainment 
news outlet with a clear agenda and established =ecord of propagating false allegations about me, rather than by any of 
=he individuals they refer to as sources, this should not be =onsidered a credible allegation worthy of investigation. I 
believe that =ur initial discussion was sufficient to settle this matter. =nbsp;Whether or not you agree with this, there 
are two things I think are important to establish. 
Firstly, that the University should not propagate what can =e false allegations from such a source by presenting 
them directly to =urrent and/or former employees or to others. To do so would be to =urther their libelous agenda, as 
Mr Waldman has emphasized. In =his regard, I would appreciate seeing copies of the correspondence you =ight send to 
current or former employees about this in the process of =arrying out and concluding your investigation. 
Secondly, I reiterate once again that the Origins Project =nvironment is supportive, candid, frank, honest, and 
productive, with =11 employees being treated with respect, as well as being supported and =entored. I am proud of our 
team, and I believe they feel the same =ay. 
Thanks for your attention to these letters. 
Lawrence Krauss 
Dear Ms. Saadiq: 
My name is Adam =aldman, and I am Professor Lawrence Krauss' litigation counsel. =nbsp;Earlier this week, I 
sent the attached letter to Buzzfeed via one =f their reporters named Peter Aldhous. 
I am also in receipt of =r. Aldhous' letter to ASU, which is a variation on defamation =E2 both libel and slander —
that Mr. Aldhous and his =olleagues have been manufacturing for at least 6 months (notably =ithout any reporting) in a 
campaign with a purpose known only to them. =nbsp;Buzzfeed's first method is to call or write third parties, =osit a list 
of fake, anonymous, recklessly false and malicious =E2 allegations," and ask if the third party has anything =o add. 
Buzzfeed's second method is to seek tortious =nterference with Professor Krauss' professional contracts, by =riting third 
parties with whom Professor Krauss is in privity, present = similarly inflammatory series of anonymous, recklessly false 
and =alicious accusations, and then question: how can the email's =ecipient allow such a person to serve on their board, 
or speak at their =onference? The letter from Buzzfeed to the University falls into =oth categories. There will be 
appropriate legal consequences for =uzzfeed's actions. 
It is my =nderstanding that your office believes it is compelled by the above to =nvestigate false, defamatory, 
anonymous accusations posited by the =nline tabloid Buzzfeed by contacting third parties and potentially 
=ebroadcasting the tabloid Buzzfeed's accusations. To be =tear, these accusations were not made to the University by 
actual human =eings who are alleging they were victims. There is no evidence =hey were presented to Buzzfeed by 
actual human beings. Moreover, no =resent or former employees of ASU have made any such allegations to =our office, 
or to any office at ASU, to our knowledge. They are simply =Ileged by a tabloid, and one that had yet published a "story" 
=n the topic when they forwarded these to you. You may propose to =ebroadcast this tabloid's libel to other third 
parties who have also =ade no accusation against Professor Krauss. I suggest that you =onsult with the University's 
counsel before taking so rash a =tep as re-broadcasting hearsay defamation that came to you via an =nline tabloid under 
these circumstances.
