b. By creating NewCo holding BFP, we avoid a sale involving Apollo interests and continue to trap income (that 
would otherwise have to be distributed to the children after age 25 from the children's trusts). 
c. By contributing the note to the 2011 LLC, we better control fiduciary accounting income. 
5. We will need to consider governance issues with respect to the 2011 LLC and NewCo. 
B. Existing Insurance/Split Dollar 
1. The current split dollar arrangements should be terminated in accordance with prior discussions and analysis. 
Ada will circulate a memorandum she prepared for Norman Brownstein, who is the Trustee of the 1999 insurance trusts, 
summarizing the steps. 
2. The insurance on Leon's life ($50 million face amount) likely will be terminated. The survivorship policies ($100 
million) have performed better and may be continued. The family office has been working with Roger Cammon to 
obtain performance illustrations and projections to help make this decision. 
3. If the survivorship policies are retained, the 1999 insurance trust (Trust #2) will continue to own them. Since 
Trust #2 has no other assets, funds could be made available to Trust #2 from APO2 (or another trust) on a periodic basis, 
and without much paperwork, via decantings. 
4. Note that Trust #2 calls for mandatory income payments to the children following the death of the survivor of 
Leon and Debra. It further grants each child a broad testamentary power of appointment (which means that, on his or 
her death, the child may direct the disposition of his or her share of the $100 million death benefit to a spouse or 
anyone else in his or her Will) . We have considered whether it makes sense to decant Trust #2 in favor of a new trust, 
say APO3 (which could be a sub-trust of APO2). In the end, we believe it is better to keep the insurance in Trust #2 for 
the following reasons: 
a. Creating yet another trust may raise issues and would involve additional administration. 
b. We generally favor old and cold trusts unless there is a problem with them. 
c. Any decanting of Trust #2 would involve multiple steps, as the trust's governing law (Colorado) current=y 
does not authorize decanting. 
d. Given the amounts involved and Leon's desire to provide some cash flow to the children at some point, the 
mandatory income payments (and testamentary power of appointment) may not be too problematic. 
C. Insurance on Art and Other Issues Relating to the Art 
1. The owners of the art should have an agreement recording the arrangement concerning the insurance, including: 
a. One umbrella policy saves each of the parties significant funds as compared to separate policies held by each 
(and therefore is a prudent business decision by the Trustees). 
b. The agreement should set forth the allocation of premiums (perhaps based on some objective factors). It 
furthe= should explain how a claim is handled (particularly if the loss exceeds coverage). 
c. Each of the parties in fact should pay its share of the premiums. 
2. Each time art is acquired by a trust, there should be a contemporaneous writing, such as a trustees' resolution, 
recording the decision.
