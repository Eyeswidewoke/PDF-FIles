which=were to provide a guarantee. Richard Ressler suggested we set up a line fr=m one of the family entities in a 
commercially reasonable fashion. Since w= had gone pretty with B of A, Ada worked with Paul Weiss to adapt the B of A 
loan agreement, adjusting to mo=erate restrictions I referred to. The trustees signed off on guarant=e of the line and 
two artworks owned by the 1997 Trust were provided as co=lateral. 
The credit facility had a maturity of one year becau=e B of A had offered only a one year maturity. Limit on the 
facility was s=t at $15mil in order to facilitate funding of Regan Arts as well as Phaido=. The same schedule of permitted 
drawdowns that had been part of the Lloyds facility was attached to the lo=n agreement. With hindsight, the document 
Paul Weiss had worked with Ada t= create facilitated lending from Black Family Partners to Phaidon Gl=bal but did not 
provide documentation for the borrowing from Phaidon Global by the operating company, Phaidon Pr=ss. We put simple 
notes in place for each of the drawdowns you will see on=the table below as documentation of the advances to the 
operating company.= 
The left side of the table below shows the permitted=drawdown schedule. The right side of the table show the 
actual activity. &=bsp;You will see the an additional draw of $300k in December 2013 above th= schedule which came as 
a request from the Phaidon CFO and Leon approved. In the February-April period when repay=ent of the line was 
normally made using cash generated from the seasonally=high period, only one-half of the scheduled repayment was 
made due to a ti=ht cash situation. In the Apr-Jul period the balance moved back into range (with the addl $300k). 
Phaidon'= new management team joined in April. In the subsequent months, Keith and =ohn worked to get their arms 
around the cash needs for the balance of the =alendar year. These cash needs reflected a higher payroll tied to the new 
hires as well as weak business trends in =all 2014 (a result of the period of management turmoil that had preceded t=e 
new team joining). There has been much discussion of cash needs fo= consecutive Board meetings since August. 
Forecast of need for 4.2-4.5mil GBP ($6.6mi1) has been consistent since Ju=y financials were produced. Authorization for 
additional funding was given=at the Board Meeting. August, Sept, and Oct draws on the table below=followed as 
needed. It was agreed at the November Board meeting that it made sense to term out the $8mi1 balanc= to five years 
and establish a shorter facility for the working cap needs =n the next 12 months. 
The actual credit facility expired in September. &nb=p;At that point the team here began to discuss a different 
structure, one =ith the underlying owners of Phaidon Global as liquidity providers rather =han Black Family Partners. 
Unfortunately, it was only late last month at the Trustees meeting the dialog was pursued=with enough depth that an 
action plan was laid out.
