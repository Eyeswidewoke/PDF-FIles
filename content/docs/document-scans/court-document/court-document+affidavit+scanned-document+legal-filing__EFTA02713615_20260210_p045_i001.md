Impaired Withdrawals 
If the General Partner determines that the liquidity in the Partnership's investment 
portfolio is impaired as of a Withdrawal Date (an "Impaired Withdrawal Date"), the General 
Partner may require each Limited Partner making a withdrawal of ninety percent (90%) or more 
of his Capital Accounts as of such date (a "Designated Limited Partner") to retain his pro rata 
interest in any investments that the Investment Manager believes cannot be liquidated at such 
time without undue cost to the non-withdrawing Limited Partners ("Designated Investments"). 
Designated Limited Partners will retain such interests until the Investment Manager liquidates 
the applicable Designated Investments in the ordinary course of business (an "Impaired 
Withdrawal Period"), or such earlier date as of which the General Partner, in its discretion, 
elects to terminate the Impaired Withdrawal Period. A Limited Partner will be not required to 
maintain an interest in Designated Investments that have a value as of such Impaired Withdrawal 
Date of more than ten percent (10%) of the total net asset value of such Limited Partner's Capital 
Accounts as of such date. 
The Incentive Allocation, if any, due to the General Partner with respect to a Designated 
Limited Partner on an Impaired Withdrawal Date (but not on any other date or with respect to 
any other Limited Partner) shall be calculated as if the Designated Investments were deemed to 
have no value as of such date. 
During an Impaired Withdrawal Period, a Designated Limited Partner's interest in any 
Designated Investments will increase or decrease based upon the performance of such 
Designated Investments. A Designated Limited Partner will receive distributions from the 
Partnership promptly following the liquidation of each applicable Designated Investment, net of 
any expenses. Management Fees will accrue on the Designated Investments during an Impaired 
Withdrawal Period, but will not be payable with respect to a Designated Limited Partner until he 
has received distributions from Designated Investments that exceed any applicable unrecovered 
Loss Recovery Account balance that existed as of the Illiquid Redemption Date. An Incentive 
Allocation shall also be due with respect to all such distributions to the extent they exceed any 
applicable unrecovered Loss Recovery Account balance that existed as of the Illiquid 
Redemption Date. 
The General Partner and the Investment Manager shall not withdraw any capital from the 
Partnership during an Impaired Withdrawal Period other than amounts necessary to pay taxes 
and employee and consultant compensation amounts. 
Withdrawal Notice 
A Limited Partner must provide irrevocable written notice to the General Partner of his 
desire to make a withdrawal as of a Withdrawal Date at least forty-five (45) days prior to such 
Withdrawal Date. The above notice period may be waived in whole or in part by the General 
Partner in its discretion with respect to one or more Limited Partners. After receiving a 
withdrawal notice from a Limited Partner, the Partnership may, upon at least 24 hours' notice to 
the Limited Partner (via email or otherwise), effect such withdrawal and pay all or a portion of 
the withdrawal proceeds at any time prior to the anticipated Withdrawal Date. In addition, the 
General Partner, in its discretion, may permit a Limited Partner to make a withdrawal from his
