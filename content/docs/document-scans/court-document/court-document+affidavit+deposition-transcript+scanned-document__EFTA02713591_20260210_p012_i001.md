profitability for Partnership purposes (e.g., unrealized gains and losses being included in the 
latter but not necessarily in the former) so as to as closely as reasonably possible have the tax 
allocations follow the economic allocations; provided however, that the General Partner shall be 
permitted to take into account such other factors as may be permitted by the Code and the 
regulations thereunder and any such allocations shall be binding on all Partners, so long as they 
were made in good faith. 
(b) 
All allocations to be made by the General Partner may be overridden if 
necessary to comply with the Code, the regulations thereunder or other applicable law. It is 
intended that all allocations herein shall have substantial economic effect under the Code and the 
regulations thereunder. 
(c) 
If the Partnership realizes items of income or losses (including capital 
gains and capital losses) for federal income tax purposes for any fiscal year, the General Partner 
shall have the discretion to allocate specially an amount of the Partnership's items of income or 
losses (including capital gains and capital losses) to a Partner who has made a full or partial 
withdrawal from his Capital Account during or at the end of such fiscal year to the extent that the 
Partner's Capital Account exceeds or is less than his federal income tax basis in his Partnership 
interest or to the extent the Partner's Capital Account exceeds or is less than his "adjusted tax 
basis," for federal income tax purposes, in his interest in the Partnership as of such time 
(determined without regard to any adjustments made to such "adjusted tax basis" by reason of 
any transfer or assignment of such interest, including by reason of death). 
(d) 
To the extent that the Partnership pays withholding taxes as to a Partner, 
such amounts shall be charged to the applicable Capital Account of such Partner or current 
distributions, or any such amounts may be treated as an advance to the Partner with interest to be 
charged to that Capital Account of such Partner at a rate determined by the General Partner. 
Such withholding taxes shall not reduce the Incentive Allocation otherwise due to the General 
Partner. 
(e) 
Each Partner agrees to provide information as requested by the General 
Partner so that the General Partner, in its discretion, can determine whether to file applicable 
composite returns and eligibility for inclusion in such returns. 
(f) 
Each Partner agrees not to treat, on any tax return or in any claim for a 
refund, any item of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit in a manner inconsistent with the 
treatment of such item by the Partnership. 
3.5 
Adjustments to Take into Account Interim Events. 
(a) 
The General Partner shall make such adjustments in the determination and 
allocation among the Partners of Net Gain, Net Loss, Capital Accounts, Partnership Percentages, 
and items of income, deduction, gain, loss or credit for tax purposes as shall equitably take into 
account interim events and applicable provisions of law, and the determination thereof by the 
General Partner shall be final and conclusive as to all of the Partners. 
(b) 
The General Partner may accept capital contributions to the Partnership 
subsequent to the time that they were due, and may assess an interest charge to the capital
