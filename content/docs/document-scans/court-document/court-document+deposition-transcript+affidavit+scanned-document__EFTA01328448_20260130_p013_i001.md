do not provide any relief from any applicable law or regulation. This aircraft 
must be operated per 
pl 
le regulations and the additional limitations prescribed herein. Note that a 
clearance from air traff

clearance that would 
a pilot to deviate from a rule, regulation, or operating limitation, or in the 
pilot's opinion, would
