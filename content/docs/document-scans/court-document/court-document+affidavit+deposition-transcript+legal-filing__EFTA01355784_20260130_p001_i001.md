AUTHORIZATION OF POWER OF ATTORNEY 
For Natural/Individual Persons For Brokerage Accounts and/or retirement accounts with DBSI 
This Authorization/Power of Attorney constitutes a non-durable limited power of attorney, designed to 
give a person or persons designated by you either (1) limited authority over your Account(s) or (2) full 
authority over your Account(s) as set forth below. 
NOTE: UNDER NEW YORK LAW, THE FOLLOWING DISCLOSURE IS REQUIRED TO BE INCLUDED, 
VERBATIM, IN EVERY POWER OF ATTORNEY. 
CAUTION TO THE PRINCIPAL: Your Power of Attorney is an important document. As the "Principal," you 
give the person whom you choose (your "agent") authority to spend your money and sell or dispose of your 
property during your lifetime without telling you. You do not lose your authority to act even though you have 
given your agent similar authority. When your agent exercises this authority, he or she must act according 
to any instructions you have provided or, when there are .no specific instructions, in your best interest. 
"Important Information for the Agent" at the end of this document describes your agent's responsibilities. 
Your agent can act on your behalf only after signing the Power of Attorney before a notary public. 
You can request information from your agent at any time. If you are revoking a prior Power of Attorney by 
executing this Power of Attorney, you should provide written notice of the revocation to your prior agent(s) 
and to the financial institutions where your accounts are located. You can revoke or terminate your Power 
of Attorney at any time for any reason as long as you are of sound mind. If you are no longer of sound mind, 
a court can remove an agent for acting improperly. Your agent cannot make health care decisions for you. 
You may execute a "Health Care Proxy" to do this. The law governing Powers of Attorney is contained in the 
New York General Obligations Law, Article 5, Title 15. This law is available at a law library, or online through 
the New York State Senate or Assembly websites, www.senate.state.ny.us or www.assembly.state.ny.us. 
If there is anything in this document that you do not understand, you should consult with your lawyer.
