As you may have noticed, my whole train of thought on computationalism is b=sed on the rediscovery of 
intutionist mathematics under the name "com=utation".

The difference between classical math and computation is that classically, = function has a value as soon as it is 
defined, but in the computational p=radigm, it has to be actually computed, using some generator. This also ap=lies for 
functions that designate truth. For something to be true in intui=ionist mathematics, you will always have to show the 
money: you have to deronstrate that you know how to make a process that can actually perform the=necessary steps. 
This has some interesting implication: computation cannot be paradoxical. 1= the computational framework, 
there can be no set of all sets that does no= contain itself. Instead, you'd have to define functions that add and =emove 
sets from each other, and as a result, you might up with some period=c fluctuation, but not with an illegal state. 
Intuitionist math fits together with automata theory. It turns out that the=e is a universal computer, i.e. a 
function that can itself compute all com=utable functions (Turing completeness). All functions that implement the 
u=iversal computer can effectively compute the same set of functions, but th=y may differ in how efficiently they can do 
it. Efficiency relates to comp=tational complexity classes. 
The simplest universal computers known are some cellular automata, with Min=ky and Wolfram arguing about 
who found the shortest one. Boolean algebra i= Turing complete, too, as is the NAND gate, the lambda calculus, and 
almos= all programming languages. The Church Turing thesis says that all univers=l computers can compute each other, 
and therefore have the same power. 
I suspect that it is possible that the Church Turing thesis is also a physi=al law, i.e. it is impossible to build 
physical computer that can calculat= more than a Turing machine. However, that conflicts with the traditional =ntuitions 
of most of physics: that the universe is geometric, i.e. hyperco=putational. The fact that we cannot construct a 
hypercomputer, not just no= in physics, but also not mathematically (where we take its existence as g=ven when we 
perform geometry), makes me suspect that perhaps even God cann=t make a true geometric universe. 
How can we recover continuous space from discrete computation? Well, spacet=me is the set of all locations 
that can store information, and the set of =11 trajectories along which this information can flow, as seen from the 
pe=spective of an observer. We can get such an arrangement from a flat lattic= (i.e. a graph) that is approximately 
regular and fine grained enough. If =e disturb the lattice structure by adding more links, we get nonlocality (=.e. some
