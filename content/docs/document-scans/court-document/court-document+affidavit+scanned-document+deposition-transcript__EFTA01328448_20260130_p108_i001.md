Practices Manual Biff-AU.-SPM rev. 4 dated June 2011. 
Performed Ground functional test IAW manufacturers installation manual procedures that determined the operations and functions of existing 
systems and components previously installed are not adversely affected by this alteration. 
An electrical load analysis has been computed and it has been determined that the electrical load does not exceed 80% of the rated generator 
capacity. The aircratts weight and balance was computed. 
This equipment was found not to exceed the guidelines in FAA Rolorcaft Directorate poky letter ASW-2001.4. dated April 25. 2003 for 
FADEC controlled aircraft and is considered to be 'equipment not known to have potential for interference'. 
CONTINUED AIRWORTHINESS: Requires operational checks and visual inspections per FAR part 43 Appendix D annually. Reference 
manufacturers publications.
