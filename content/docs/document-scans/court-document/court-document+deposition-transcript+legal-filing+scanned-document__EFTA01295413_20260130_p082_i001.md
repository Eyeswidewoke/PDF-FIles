2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 40263, * 
conversation as well, but he testified Putnam did not promise anything with regard to how 
fast or slow the loan would close, promising only his "best effort." (Doc. No. 39 [Coco Dep.] 
at 1224-25.) Coco testified Wojtowicz had no authority to decide if a loan would close at all 
and that he explained this to Loadman. (Id. at 1215.) 
On April 9, 2008, Banco sent Loadman a commitment letter. (Doc. No. 37 at 756; Doc. No. 
35-1 [Loadman Dep. Ex. G] at 336.) In it, Banco offered Loadman and his "Corporation to 
be Formed," "at the Bank's sole discretion, the following credit facility which is subject to, 
but not limited to, the terms and conditions set forth herein." (Doc. No. 35-1 at 336.) The 
letter proposed two first mortgage "504" loans, two second "504" "bridge" loans to be 
repaid by the SBA, and one SBA 7(a) loan. (Id. at 336-46.) The letter referenced 
"[a]dditional loan requirements" attached [' 8] as a "Closing Needs Checklist" ("checklist"),' 
which included certain conditions that would need to be satisfied prior to loan closing.* (Id.) 
5 The commitment letter stated, in relevant part: 
9. . . . Additional loan requirements are attached to this commitment letter as "Closing Needs Checklist." These 
reilLirements are based on initial documentation received with your loan application. Additional conditions may 
be required as the loan closing process proceeds. 
10. This loan Is further subject to Bank receipt and approval, In Its sole discretion, of a fully executed 
SBA Authorization for Debenture Guaranty. The Borrower(s) and Guarantor(s) agree to provide any 
additional information as required pursuant to the program and have full knowledge that the proposed 
loans cannot dose without receipt of a fully executed SBA Authorization for Debenture Guaranty 
(Doc. No. 35-1 at 347) (bold in original). 
6 The checidist included the following pertinent conditions: 
13. Satisfactory Environmental site assessment starting with a Phase II located at 1305 Old Thomasville 
Road. High Point. North Carolina 27260. (DONE) 
14. Satisfactory Environmental site assessment starting with a Phase II located rin at 1993 Bethel Drive. 
High Point. North Carolina 27260 
18. Closing. (sic) of the loan is conditioned upon prior receipt and review of fully executed SBA Authorization 
for Debenture Guarantee from an acceptable CDC. 
19. SBA Loan Authorization 
(Doc. No. 35-1 at 356-57.) 
On April 11, 2008, a nearly identical commitment letter superseded the April 9 commitment 
letter. (Doc. No. 37 at 761; Doc. No. 35-1 [Loadman Dep. Ex. H] at 358.) A July 31, 2008 
commitment letter eventually superseded the April 11 letter; it identified the "Corporation to 
be Formed" as Loadman Group, but was otherwise essentially identical to the prior letter. 
(Doc. No. 37 at 772-73; Doc. No. 35-1 [Loadman Dep. Ex. I] at 375.) Loadman accepted 
the terms of each of those letters. (Doc. No. 37 at 757, 761-62.) 
As described in the February 7, 2008 prequalification letter, throughout this process, it was 
the role of the CDC to obtain SBA approval of the 504 loans. (Doc. No. 37 at 751.) The 
CDC representative working on Loadman's loans was Ralph Ansell ("Ansell") of the CDC 
Self-Help Ventures Fund. (Id. at 752, 833; Doc. No. 38 at [Ansell Dep.] 980.) Ansell 
testified that the SBA's 504 loan program required use of an [' 1 0] intermediary CDC, but 
CDCs do not have the authority to speak for the SBA, which has the "final say" on 
approving loans and could impose additional conditions. (Doc. No. 38 at 980-81, 987-88,
