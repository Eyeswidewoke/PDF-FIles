III. Preparation 
A. Mailing Instructions 
Complete the External Law Enforcement Request for Mail Cover Template. This template must be 
accompanied by a cover letter requesting the mail cover on agency letterhead, signed by the 
requesting agent's supervisor. Endorse the request and envelope RESTRICTED INFORMATION. 
Seal the request in the envelope, place it in a second envelope, and mail to: 
CISC Manager 
Attn: MC Specialist 
433 W. Harrison Street, Room 3255 
Chicago, IL 60699-3255 
B. Mandatory Information 
There is certain information which must be furnished to determine if a mail cover can be approved. 
See sample mail cover request provided as Exhibit 1. Exhibit 2 is a sample of PS Form 2009, 
Information Concerning Mail Matter, and is what the Postal Service uses for the recording. 
1. Date of Request. Enter the date the request for mail cover is completed. 
2. Type of Request. Indicate the type of request, i.e. new request, extension, fugitive, forfeiture, etc. 
3. Number of Days: Select the number of days requested for the mail cover. Current regulations 
provide that except in fugitive (30 or 60 days) and national security cases, the standard period for a 
mail cover is 30 days. Extensions may be granted 30 days at a time, up to 120 days. No mail 
cover shall be extended to remain in force longer than 120 days unless approved by the Chief 
Postal Inspector at National Headquarters. 
4. Subject of Mail Cover Name & Address: Only one subject address may be requested on each 
mail cover template. Identify each person or business to be covered by full name, address, and ZIP 
Code. Where a request specifies covering "All Names at Subject Address", there must be 
justification for the broader scope. Conclusory statements about the use of aliases by certain 
classes of violators are discouraged. Support for "All Names at Subject Address" should stem from 
articulable activities of the cover subject(s) under the particular circumstances of the investigation. 
Because the cover request must be facially sufficient, grounds for covering all names should be 
provided even when the nature of the case suggests mail is received in an array of names (i.e. 
credit card fraud). 
Information regarding the persons residing at or receiving mail at a particular address should be 
obtained prior to submitting the mail cover request. This information can normally be requested 
from the local Postal Inspector's office. Be careful to ensure that the cover is limited only to the 
persons required for the investigation and that the information provided establishes a basis to show 
the involvement of each subject in the matter under investigation. If a name should be excluded 
from the mail cover, indicate this name and the fact it should be excluded on the template. As an 
example, a mail cover request for all names at a specific address, without adequate iustification will 
be rejected. 
Identify anyone else who receives mail at the same address but is not a subject of your 
investigation, so that person's mail can be excluded from the cover. 
5. Indictment Statement: Ordinarily, a mail cover will not be approved for a criminal investigation 
purpose where the subject has already been indicted for the offense under investigation. The only
