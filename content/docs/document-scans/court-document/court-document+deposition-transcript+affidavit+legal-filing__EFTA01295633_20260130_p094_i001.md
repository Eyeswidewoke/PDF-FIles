2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 82496, * 
13 Statebridge also argues that the allegations were consistent with the notices that Statebridge provided to Plaintiff regarding 
the lapse of his primary insurance. but Plaintiff did not include them with his Complaint, and the Court does not consider them at 
this stage of litigation. 
As discussed above, the Mortgage Agreement does not authorize the kickbacks alleged, 
and the filed rate doctrine does not apply here. Rule 9(b)" requires that a plaintiff alleging 
fraud "state the circumstances of the alleged fraud with sufficient particularity to place the 
defendant on notice of the 'precise misconduct with which (it is] charged."' Frederica v. 
Home Depot, 507 F.3d 188, 200 (3d Cir. 2007) (internal citation omitted). "To satisfy this 
standard, the plaintiff must plead or allege the date, time and place of the alleged fraud or 
otherwise inject precision or some measure of substantiation into a fraud allegation." Id. 
14 Rule 9(b) provides: in all averments of fraud or mistake, the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake shall be stated with 
particularity. [1341 Malice, intent. knowledge and other conditions of mind of a person may be averred generally." 
Plaintiff here has alleged with sufficient particularity a fraudulent scheme wherein 
Defendants led Plaintiff to believe that his higher force-placed insurance premiums were 
necessary to provide him coverage, when they were actually used to provide kickbacks to 
Statebridge. (Compl. ¶¶ 81-82) These kickbacks were not disclosed to Plaintiff and qualify 
as a material omission in Statebridge's communications with Plaintiff, such as the July 6, 
2012, letter. Consequently, Statebridge's motion to dismiss Plaintiffs claims under the 
NJCFA will be denied. 
F. Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations ("RICO") Act 
Finally, Statebridge seeks to dismiss Plaintiffs RICO claims, which allege mail and wire 
fraud (Count VII) and RICO conspiracy (Count VIII) under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) and (d).'4
Establishing liability under (section (c)) of the RICO statute 'requires (1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a 
pattern (4) of racketeering activity.' plus an injury to 'business or property.' . . . Under Section 1962(d), lip is also 
unlawful for anyone to conspire to violate § 1962(c). . . . Section 1961(1) of RICO provides a list of the federal and state 
crimes which r351 constikte 'racketeering activity and includes mail and wire fraud, and Section 1961(4) of RICO 
defines the term 'enterprise' to 'include° any individual, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity, and 
any triion or group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity.' 
In re Ins. Brokerage Antitrust Litig., 579 F.3d 241, 269 (3d Cir. 2009) (internal citations 
omitted). 
15 Part (c) of the RICO statute. 18 U.S.C. § 1962. provides: it shall be unlawful for any person employed by or associated with 
any enterprise engaged in. or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or 
indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt." Part 
(d) provides: "It shall be unlawful for any person to conspire to violate any of the provisions of subsection (a), (b), or (c) of this 
section' 
First, Statebridge alleges that Plaintiff has failed to plead a RICO enterprise, because he 
"has failed to allege wrongful actions in the conduct of the enterprise" beyond the 
"procurement of insurance [which] is one of [Statebridge's] duties as a servicer of the 
Mortgage." (SMTD at 44) However, Plaintiff pleads more than mere procurement of 
insurance; he pleads that Defendants made material r36] omissions and
