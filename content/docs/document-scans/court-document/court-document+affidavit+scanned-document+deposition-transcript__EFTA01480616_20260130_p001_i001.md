HEADLINE: Jeffrey Epstein's Strangely Failed Plea Bargain 
BODY: 
Jul. 28, 2006 (Gawker delivered by Newatex) --
According to an 87-page Palm Beach Police Department report, on April 17 billionaire moneybag and 
suspected hebephile  Jeffrey Epstein 
agreed to plead  guilty to an aggravated assault charge, serve 
five years probation, undergo "psychiatric/sexual evaluation," and have no unsupervised visits with 
minors. Epstein's then-counsel Guy Fronstin relayed that Epstein would accept the plea bargin and asked 
that investigators "call off the grand jury as they would accept this deal." It could've resulted in a 
somewhat smaller shitstorm, but the deal was never closed: 
It is unclear why the plea bargain was not formally struck at that point, but the report indicates 
that police investigators--who anticipated five felony counts being lodged against Epstein--were incensed 
at what they clearly viewed as a sweetheart prosecution offer. 
Strangely, in mid-May, Epstein was offered the plea bargain again, but papers indicate that the 
prosecutor "was waiting" for an answer. Yet on Sunday, Epstein was unfairly arrested for a felony count of 
soliciting prostitution. what kind of justice is there in this world when even a billionaire can't take an 
extra 3 months to get some massages while mulling over his legal options?
