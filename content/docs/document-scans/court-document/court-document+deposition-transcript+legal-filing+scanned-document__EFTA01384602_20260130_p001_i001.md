have entered into an agreement pursuant to which the Solicitation Agents have agreed to consider their 
clients and prospective clients for whom an investment in a Fund may be suitable and to refer such 
persons to such Fund or the Fund Manager for potential subscription of interests in such Fund (the 
"Interests"). The Solicitation Agents arc not affiliated with either Fund or the Fund Manager. You arc 
receiving this disclosure because a Solicitation Agent has contacted you as a "Referred Investor" (as 
defined below) regarding a potential investment in a Fund. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein 
shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Confidential Private Placement Memorandum (the 
"Memorandum") of the Funds. 
As compensation for these activities, the Solicitation Agents will receive from clients investing in 
a Fund ("Referred Investors") a - Placement Fee" in an amount up to 2.5% of the gross investment in such 
Fund by each Referred Investor referred by the Solicitation Agent to the Fund or Fund Manager. The 
Placement Fee will be charged 
the Solicitation Agent that introduced the Referred Investor and not by 
the Fund or Fund Manager, and the Placement Fee will be in addition to, and Nvill not reduce or otherwise 
be in limitation of, the gross investment of each Referred Investor. The Fund Manager and each Fund 
shall not be liable for, and shall have no responsibility for, the Placement Fee. Further, and in addition to 
the Placement Fee payable by the Referred Investor, the Solicitation Agent will receive a "Servicing Fee" 
as follows: (a) in the case of the LP Fund, the Fund Manager shall pay the Solicitation Agent a Servicing 
Fee in an amount equal to 25% (per annum) of the LP Fund's Management Fee (but in no case more than 
50 basis points of the balance of each Referred Investor's capital account with the LP Fund (before the 
deduction of the LP Fund's Management Fee)) attributable to each Referred Investor in accordance with 
the Memorandum of the LP Fund; and (b) in the case of the Ltd. Fund, the Ltd. Fund shall pay the 
Solicitation Agent a Servicing Fee in an amount equal to 25% (per annum) of the Ltd. Fund's 
Management Fee (but in no case more than 50 basis points of the Net Asset Value of each Referred 
Investor's Shares in the Ltd. Fund (before the deduction of the Ltd. Fund's Management Fee)) attributable 
to each Referred Investor in accordance with the Memorandum of the Ltd. Fund. Other than the 
foregoing fees, no additional fees or other amounts {yin be charged to Referred Investors by the Funds as 
a result of the Solicitation Agent's involvement. Referred Investors will not pay increased Fund 
management foes or other similar compensation to the Solicitation Agent, the Fund Manager or the Fund 
as a result of the referral. 
Given the existence of the compensation arrangements described above, the Solicitation Agents 
may benefit financially from referring clients to the Funds rather than to other competitive hedge funds or 
other products that may also be appropriate for particular clients. As a result, the receipt of such 
payments by the Solicitation Agents from the Funds or the Fund Manager creates a potential conflict of 
interest in the form of an additional financial incentive to the Solicitation Agents, their equity owners and 
investment representatives to refer clients to the Funds or the Fund Manager. In addition, the Solicitation 
Agents or their affiliates may earn compensation from the Funds or their affiliates through arrangements 
that may or may not directly involve the Solicitation Agents, such as the provision of brokerage or prime 
brokerage services or research. Employees of the Solicitation Agents or their affiliates, including their 
investment representatives who may offer Interests to clients, may now or in the future own Interests in 
the Funds.
