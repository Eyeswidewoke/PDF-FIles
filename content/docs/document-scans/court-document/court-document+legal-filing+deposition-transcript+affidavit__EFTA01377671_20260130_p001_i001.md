SELECTED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL AND OTHER DATA 
The following selected consolidated statement of operations data for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013, and 2014, 
and the consolidated balance sheet data as of December 31, 2013 and 2014, have been derived from our audited consolidated 
financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this prospectus. The selected consolidated statement of operations 
data for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 and 2015, and the consolidated balance sheet data as of September 30, 
2015, have been derived from our unaudited interim consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this 
prospectus. The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the audited 
financial statements and reflect, in the opinion of management, all adjustments, which include only normal, recurring adjustments 
that are necessary to present fairly the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements. Our historical results are not 
necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected in the future, and the results in the nine months ended September 30, 
2015, are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the full year or any other period, in part because we do not intend 
to renew our payment processing agreement with Starbucks when it expires in the third quarter of 2016. Further, in August 2015 
we amended our payment processing agreement with Starbucks to eliminate the exclusivity provision in order to permit Starbucks 
to begin transitioning to another payment processor starting October 1, 2015. Under the amendment, Starbucks also agreed to pay 
increased processing rates to us for as long as they continue to process transactions with us. Starbucks has announced that it will 
transition to another payment processor and will cease using our payment processing services altogether prior to the scheduled 
expiration of the agreement in the third quarter of 2016. As a result, Starbucks payment processing volumes will decrease 
meaningfully going forward. You should read the consolidated financial and other data below in conjunction with the section titled 
"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and our consolidated financial 
statements and related notes included elsewhere in this prospectus.
