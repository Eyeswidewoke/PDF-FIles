The Associated Press (03/04, Colvin, Sisak) reported that the Trump administration has released a list of over 440 
federal properties targeted for potential sale, including the FBI headquarters and the main Department of Justice 
building. According to the article, the list was later revised to 320 entries, with all properties in Washington, D.C. 
removed, including the J. Edgar Hoover Building and the Robert F. Kennedy Department of Justice Building. The 
goal of selling these properties is to eliminate costly maintenance and save taxpayer dollars, with estimated annual 
savings of over $430 million in operating costs. The article explained that several of the buildings on the initial 
chopping block house agencies that Trump has long criticized and targeted, notably the FBI and Justice 
Department. The FBI and HUD headquarters are also prime examples of the brutalist architectural style that Trump 
has tried for years to eliminate, preferring traditional, neo-classical architecture instead. Additional reporting on 
the story was provided by Bloomberg (03/04, Korte, Wong), CNN (03/04, Blackburn, Mash), Fox Business (03/04, 
Casiano), The Daily Beast (03/04, Ornedo), The Independent (03/04, Feinberg), Newsmax (03/04, Koutsobinas), 
New York Times (03/04, Ngo, Jewett, O'Brien), Politico (03/04, Cai, Nguyen), Reuters (03/04, Sullivan, Reid), Seattle

Trump Administration Expels Senior FBI Officials, Sparks Fears of Wider Purge Amid Jan. 6 Inquiry 
The Wall Street Journal (03/04, Gurman, Barber, Viswanatha) reported that the Trump administration has ordered 
the expulsion of senior FBI officials, with over two dozen already pushed out. The expulsions target investigators 
and prosecutors involved in Trump probes, with thousands more potentially at risk of being fired, sparking fears of 
a mass purge. According to the article, Director Patel is expected to shrink the bureau's counterintelligence and 
counterterrorism work, and move agents from securities fraud, antitrust violations, and other white-collar cases to 
pursue drug-trafficking and violent street crime. Additionally, the article explained that thousands of FBI agents 
were ordered to answer a 12-question survey about their work on the Jan. 6 riot. Agents paused field work to 
complete the survey. The central question asked, "What was your role in the investigations or prosecutions relating 
to events that occurred at or near the Capitol on Jan. 6, 20217 The article highlighted that last Thursday, Director 
Patel told lawmakers at his FBI confirmation that FBI employees would be protected from political 
retribution. "Every FBI employee will be held to the same standard and no one will be terminated for case 
assignments," he said under oath. On Saturday, the FBI agents association in a note told its members not to resign 
or offer to resign: "While we would never advocate for physical noncompliance, you need to be clear your removal 
is not voluntary!' The agents association followed up with another message Sunday, telling members to answer the 
Jan. 6 survey with a response that included the sentence, "I have not been advised of my rights in this matter." The 
article noted that the senior FBI executives given the Justice Department ultimatum last week had by the Monday 
deadline cleared out their offices and turned in their badges. Together, they represented close to 200 years of FBI 
experience. 
'Everything Is on the Table' on DOJ Purge of Trump Haters, AG Pam Bondi Says 
USA TODAY (03/04, Meyer) reported that the DOJ has fired all of Jan. 6 special counsel Jack Smith's staff and is 
working to "root out" anyone at the department and FBI who it believes doesn't like President Donald Trump, 
Attorney General Bondi has confirmed. AG Bondi, in a Monday night interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity, 
also said the Justice Department is looking at conducting investigations into the actions of Smith's team and also 
into the conduct of prosecutors and federal agents involved in the sprawling criminal probe into Russian 
interference in the 2016 election. "Well, first and foremost, we got rid of the Jack Smith team. Gone. Those people 
are gone," AG Bondi said. "We're still trying to find ... a lot of people in the FBI and also in the Department of 
Justice who despise Donald Trump, despise us, don't want to be there. You have to do the right thing and right now 
we're going to root them out," AG Bondi said. "We will find them, and they will no longer be employed." The article 
added that AG Bondi told Hannity she's been working with recently confirmed Director Patel to cull the staff of 
people determined to be problematic. "We're starting at every level of the Justice Department, Sean, and getting 
rid of the worst of the worst. But there are a lot more people that shouldn't be there!" The article highlighted that 
AG Bondi's statements on the Fox interview indicated a stark shift from her tone earlier this year. During her Jan. 15 
Senate confirmation hearing, Bondi denied that she would engage in a politically motivated purge of the Justice 
Department. "Politics will not play a part;' Bondi, a former two-term Florida attorney general, told senators. "I've 
demonstrated that my entire career as a prosecutor, as attorney general and I will continue to do that."
