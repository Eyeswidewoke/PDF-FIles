NYTimes Analysis: Expanding Data Set Helps Americans Make Sense Of Pandemic. 
The New York Times (7/27, Bosman, 18.61M) reports that Americans have "an expanding set of 
data to help them interpret the coronavirus pandemic." It includes "the number of sick and 
dead" as well as "daily case counts in their cities and states, the percentage of positive tests, 
the number of people hospitalized and the weekly change in cases." The availability of the data 
is the result of "sophisticated data-gathering operations by newspapers, research universities 
and volunteers" that have "sprung up in response to the pandemic, monitoring and collecting 
coronavirus metrics around the clock." for many Americans, it provides "a way to make sense of 
the pandemic - which is spreading in the South, West and much of the Midwest, but calming in 
the Northeast - and to gauge whether things are better or worse in their own cities." 
Some Patients With Coronavirus Suffer From Symptoms, Effects Months After Initial 
Infection. 
The Wall Street Journal (7/27, Reddy, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) reports on so-called 
long-haul patients with coronavirus who continue to experience symptoms or effects of the 
disease for months after being initially infected. 
Colleagues Say Doctor Responsible For Discredited Studies Has History Of Cutting 
Corners. 
The New York Times (7/27, Gabler, Rabin, 18.61M) reports that Sapan Desai, along with a 
Harvard professor, "produced two studies in May that almost instantly disrupted multiple clinical 
trials amid the pandemic." One study's findings reported that "anti-malaria drugs like 
hydroxychloroquine, which President Trump promoted, were linked to increased deaths of 
Covid-19 patients. But that study and another were retracted in June by the renowned journals 
that had published them, weeks after researchers around the world suggested the data was 
dubious." The Times adds that "many people who have known [Desai] described him as a man 
in a hurry, a former whiz kid willing to cut corners, misrepresent information or embellish his 
credentials as he pursued his ambitions." More than "a dozen doctors who worked with him 
during training and residency said they had often found him to be an unreliable physician." 
Republicans Say Border-Crossers Responsible For Rise In Coronavirus Cases. 
The Washington Times (7/27, Al, Dinan, 492K) reports that several Republican lawmakers have 
suggested that both migrants "and legal border crossers might be responsible for part of the 
spike in cases in Texas, California and Arizona," and Acting DHS Secretary Wolf "has said U.S. 
citizens and legal permanent residents in northern Mexico are fleeing overrun hospitals south of 
the border and heading north for care in the U.S. That is contributing to higher numbers in 
border states." However, "immigration rights activists say there is no evidence to back up those 
claims," and that "U.S. policies are making the situation in northern Mexico worse by invoking a 
part of public health law to immediately expel unauthorized border crossers and make asylum 
seekers wait in Mexico for their hearings. ... Administration officials say the expulsions have 
likely saved many lives in the U.S." 
DO) Reaches Settlement With Company That Discriminated Against Permanent US 
Residents. 
The Washington Examiner (7/27, Mastrangelo, 448K) reports that the Justice Department has 
reached a settlement with Asta CRS Inc., "a Virginia-based technology staffing company that it 
says discriminated against permanent residents in favor of candidates on temporary work visas 
during a recent hiring process." The settlement "is one in a string of deals cut with various 
American companies as part of the DOJ Civil Rights Division's Protecting U.S. Workers 
Initiative," which "targets, investigates, and prosecutes companies that discriminate against 
U.S. workers in favor of temporary visa workers."
