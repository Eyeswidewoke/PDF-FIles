IN THE NEWS 
Continued Reporting: Intelligence Officials Testify on Global Threats Before Senate Intelligence Committee 
NewsNation (03/12, Shirazi) reported that intelligence officials testified before Congress, highlighting concerns 
about a "fragile world order" and significant terror threats, including smuggling networks at the southern U.S. 
border potentially tied to ISIS. According to the article, Director Wray, along with other intelligence leaders, 
mentioned that the U.S. faces a wide range of threats, from homegrown extremists to state-sponsored 
organizations. Director Wray specifically pointed out the FBI's monitoring of an ISIS-affiliated group and the 
agency's efforts to investigate smuggling networks with ISIS ties, without specifying any particular threats or plots. 
"There's a particular network that has whereas some of the overseas facilitators of the smuggling network have ISIS 
ties that were very concerned about and that we've been spending an enormous amount of effort with our 
partners investigating exactly what that network is up to is something that's again the subject of our current 
investigation," Director Wray said. Al Jazeera (03/12, Staff Writer) added that emotions rose in the hearing as some 
senators discussed immigration across the U.S. border with Mexico. Director Wray expressed concern about the 
"terrorism implications from potential targeting of vulnerabilities at the border", noting rising threats from US 
nationals inspired by armed groups and other foreign fighters since Hamas's attack on Israel on October 7. 
Newsweek (03/12, Mordowanec) reported that Director Wray outlined concerns regarding several categories of 
individuals at the U.S. border, particularly emphasizing the threat posed by known or suspected terrorists. Director 
Wray detailed the collaborative efforts between the FBI and the DHS but expressed significant concerns over 
individuals using fake identification documents to enter the U.S. undetected. "There are a few different categories 
of people that we have concerns about," Director Wray said. He elaborated on the process when a known or 
suspected terrorist is apprehended at the border, "When a known or suspected terrorist, as in known that they're a 
known or suspected terrorist is apprehended at the border, I'm confident in the vast majority of instances there's 
very close lash-up between FBI and DHS on it." However, Director Wray pointed out a critical vulnerability, "The 
bigger concern is a situation, for example, where somebody presents fake identification documents at the border 
and there's not biometrics to match up—so there's no way to be able to know that they're not who they say they 
are. Then, they get into the country; then somehow we find out that they're someone in fact who's on the list." In 
response to Sen. Jon Ossoff's inquiry regarding the threat level of terrorism associated with unlawful entry through 
the southern border, Director Wray underscored the gravity of the situation, especially in light of recent global 
events. "We are concerned about the terrorism implications from potential targeting of vulnerabilities at the 
border," Director Wray responded. He further noted the escalated threat level due to various extremist groups, 
"Well, even before October 7, I would have told this committee that we were at a heightened threat level from a 
terrorism perspective," Director Wray remarked, emphasizing the unique situation of facing elevated threats from 
homegrown violent extremists, domestic violent extremists, foreign terrorist organizations, and state-sponsored 
terrorist organizations simultaneously. Bloomberg (03/12, Martin) also quoted Director Wray: "You've seen a 
veritable rogue's gallery of foreign terrorist organizations calling for terrorist attacks against us in a way that we 
haven't seen in a long, long time," Director Wray told the House Intelligence Committee. "This is a time not for 
panic, but for heightened vigilance given the risk," Director Wray said. Newsmax (03/12, McCarthy) reported 
that Vice Chairman Marco Rubio asked Director Wray whether the FBI has seen crimes committed by people with 
ties to foreign gangs or other criminal organizations. "From an FBI perspective, we are seeing a wide array of very 
dangerous threats that emanate from the border, and that includes everything from the drug trafficking, and the 
FBI alone sees enough fentanyl in the last two years to kill 270 million people," Director Wray said. "That's just on 
the fentanyl side. An awful lot of violent crime in the United States is at the hands of gangs who are themselves 
involved in the distribution of that fentanyl." 
U.S. Intel Chief Says She Can't Rule out Possibility That China Will Use TikTok to Influence 2024 Elections 
CNN (03/12, Lyngaas) and Reuters (03/12, Martina, Zengerle) reported that the Director of National Intelligence 
Avril Haines and other U.S. intelligence officials testified before the House Intelligence Committee, stating that they 
"cannot rule out" the possibility of the Chinese government using TikTok to influence the 2024 U.S. elections. 
According to the article, this concern follows reports of TikTok being used for propaganda efforts during the 2022 
midterm elections, as outlined in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence's annual Threat Assessment 
report. The article added that Director Wray highlighted the difficulty in detecting influence operations via TikTok's
