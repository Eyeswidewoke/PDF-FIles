The Providence (RI) Journal (8/24, Staff, 259K) reports, "A citizen of India appearing Monday 
before a U.S. District Court judge admitted to participating in a 'Tech Support' telemarketing 
scam based in that country, in which call-center operators said they were associated with the 
Microsoft Corporation, added that malware or viruses had been detected on victims' computers, 
and offered supposed services to remove the malware. As a result of the calls, according to a 
news release from the office of U.S. Attorney Aaron Weisman, members of the conspiracy 
gained access to victims' online-banking usernames and passwords, and stole from their 
accounts." Abrar Anjum, 34, "admitted in court that he let members of the conspiracy use bank 
accounts under his control in the United States to receive funds taken from victim accounts, 
according to the release. Anjum admitted that in return for letting members of the conspiracy 
deposit the money into his bank accounts, he was allowed to keep part of it, transferring the 
remaining funds to his co-conspirators in India." 
FBI, CISA Warn Of Surge In Voice Call Phishing Scams. 
Security Magazine (8/24) reports, "The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Cybersecurity 
and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) released a joint statement warning companies of a 
surge in voice phishing or vishing campaigns targeting corporate virtual private networks 
(VPNs)." Security Magazine adds, "The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a mass shift to 
working from home, resulting in increased use of corporate virtual private networks (VPNs) and 
elimination of in-person verification. The CISA and FBI pointed to one example from where a 
vishing campaign allowed cybercriminals to gain access to employee tools at multiple 
companies with indiscriminate targeting—with the end goal of monetizing the access. The 
cybercriminals used vished credentials and mined the victim company databases for their 
customers' personal information to leverage in other attacks." 
Nakasone Details Newly Aggressive Cyber Effort. 
The AP (8/25, Press) reports that NSA Director and head of Cyber Command defends the 
governments shift toward a more offensive cyber strategy in a piece to be published in Foreign 
Affairs (8/25, 522K) on Tuesday. Nakasone says that the mission has "evolved over the last 
decade from 'a reactive and defensive posture' to keep pace with sophisticated threats." 
Nakasone adds that the military cyber teams are actively engaging online adversaries, saying, 
"We learned that we cannot afford to wait for cyber attacks to affect our military networks. We 
learned that defending our military networks requires executing operations outside our military 
networks. The threat evolved, and we evolved to meet it." The AP notes that the piece is co-
authored by Michael Sulmeyer, his top adviser. 
TikTok Sues Trump Administration To Overturn Executive Order. 
The AP (8/24, Arbel) reports TikTok filed suit on Monday opposing President Trump's executive 
order banning the company in the US over national security concerns. Convincing a court to 
"overturn the government's determination that TikTok is a national-security threat would be 
difficult, legal experts said." 
The Wall Street Journal (8/24, Ferek, Lin, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) reports the 
lawsuit argues the executive order violates the Fifth Amendment's due process protections, 
while The New York Times (8/24, Isaac, Swanson, 18.61M) calls the lawsuit "TikTok's most 
direct challenge to the White House." 
Reuters (8/24, Wang, Stempel) reports TikTok rejected what they "called the White 
House's position that it was a national security threat," saying they had taken "extraordinary 
measures to protect the privacy and security of TikTok's US user data." Before buying TikTok, 
"ByteDance had not sought advance approval from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the 
United States (CFIUS), which reviews acquisitions for potential national security risks." Reuters 
says CFIUS later opened "an investigation and on July 30 issued a letter stating it found 
national security risks associated with the purchase," but it "repeatedly refused" to engage with
