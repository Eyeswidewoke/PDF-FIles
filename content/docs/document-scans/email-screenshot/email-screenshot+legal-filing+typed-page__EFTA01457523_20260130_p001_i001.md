I ov: inflation in content cost provides vinibilitv on siren() earninas growth 
During FY10-12, Dish TVs EBITDA grew 4.2x as the company doubled its 
number of subscribers and entered into fixed content cost deals with the 
broadcasters. We believe operating leverage will play out for Dish again as its 
content costs are now largely fixed, at least for the next 1.5 years (with 5-6% 
annual increase), and it aggressively adds subscribers. EBITDA growth of 72% 
in 4QFY15 (22% ahead of estimates) is a testimony. Continuing strong 
subscriber addition and an ARPU increase of INR 10 (4%) in May 2015 will be 
strong near-term catalysts. 
Filed content cost deals resulted in a big beat in earnings 
Dish TV reported sales/EBITDA growth of +19%/+72% (+2%/+22% vs. our 
est.). Strong customer addition of 405k net subscribers (vs. our 180k est.) and 
flat content cost were key drivers for the beat. If one stripped off the impact of 
activation revenue (accounting change done in Q4FY14), EBITDA growth 
would still have been 72%. Dish TV has content cost fixed for at least the next 
20 months (management guiding for 5-6% annual inflation). The Star and Zee 
content-cost deal expires September 2016, India Cast in March 2017, and Sony 
in March 2018. While fixed content costs will drive earnings growth over the 
next six quarters, ARPU increases will drive long-term earnings growth. Cost 
pass-through for cable (broadcasters push) gives DTH players headroom to 
raise prices (see Figure 2 for ARPU trend). Dish also implemented differential 
pricing for metros, which is working well, but it may have to roll back the price 
increase if peers do not follow; otherwise, subscriber addition may be affected. 
DTH seems to be benefitting trout a delay in digitization Phase 3 and 4 
Despite 1.3mn gross subscriber additions in 2HFY15, Dish is still gaining 28% 
incremental market share. It seems that the DTH companies are probably 
gaining market share in Phase 3 and 4 areas. 
Maintaining Buy; revising target price to INH105 (up 25%) 
We have increased our earnings estimates (19-21%) and target price to factor 
in strong customer addition of 1.4mn in FY16/17 (vs. 1.2mn earlier) and lower 
content cost increase of 8/10% in FY16/17 (vs. 12% earlier). Our estimates are 
below management guidance of 5-6% content cost increase and 1.4-1.7mn net 
subscriber adds in FY16. Our target of 11x September 2016 EV/EBITDA is 
intact. Key risk: slower-than-expected growth in ARPU.
