that the group had reported spending in that time, burning through the group's cash reserves. Smith, 51, was 
charged with bank fraud and wire fraud, both felonies that can come with as much as 30 years of prison time. The 
article noted that the group has successfully redeveloped a long stretch of the city's Detroit River waterfront and, 
until recently, had shown no public signs of distress. Local foundations contributed to it annually and it received 
grants from the Environmental Protection Agency, among others. In 2013, Smith was named a finalist for "C.F.O. of 
the year" by a local business magazine. But the nonprofit discovered problems with its finances this spring and 
invited Michigan State Police to investigate. The police then handed the case to the FBI. USA TODAY (06/05, 
MacDonald, Ikonomova), Axios (06/05, Guillen), Bloomberg (06/05, Heisig), and CBS News (06/05, Powers) also 
reported on the story. 
Continued Reporting: Deliberations Continue in Feeding Our Future Fraud Trial Roiled by Bag of Cash for a 
Juror in Minneapolis 
The Associated Press (06/05, Karnowski, Goldberg) reported that a jury ended a second day of deliberations 
Wednesday without reaching a verdict in the trial of seven Minnesotans accused in a scheme to steal more than 
$40 million from a program meant to feed children during the coronavirus pandemic, while FBI agents try to 
establish who left a bag with $120,000 in cash for a juror. Federal authorities confiscated the defendants' 
cellphones to search for clues and took all seven into custody on Monday before deliberations began. The trial 
judge also sequestered the jury after dismissing the juror who turned over the gift bag, along with another juror 
who reported hearing about the bribe attempt. The article added that FBI agents searched the home of one of the 
defendants Wednesday, according to a neighbor who witnessed the search. The home searched is identified in 
court records as the home of Abdiaziz Shafii Farah, who prosecutors have described as a ringleader of the seven. 
According to the article, Minneapolis FBI spokesperson Diana Freedman said in emails to the AP that "The FBI was 
present in Savage, MN conducting court authorized law enforcement activity," but that "I cannot provide or confirm 
any additional information." KARE (NBC-11) (06/05, Raguse), and KMSP (Fox-9) (06/05, Staff Writer) also reported 
on the story. 
Continued Reporting: FBI Agent Testifies at Menendez Trial About Texts That Allegedly Show How 
Senator's Wife Got a Mercedes 
CNN (06/05, Souza) reported that Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez's federal corruption trial continued Wednesday 
with an FBI special agent reading text messages from a New Jersey businessman who is alleged to have made 
payments on a Mercedes-Benz convertible for the senator's wife. The article added that FBI Special Agent Rachel 
Graves combed through countless text messages and documents from 2018 and 2019 detailing Jose Uribe's 
involvement in the bribery scheme. Uribe was indicted alongside Menendez but struck a plea deal with federal 
prosecutors earlier this year. Under the terms of the deal, he pleaded guilty to seven counts and agreed to testify in 
the government's case. According to the article, prosecutor Paul Michael Monteleoni spent Wednesday morning in 
federal court in New York unraveling the complex web of communication that allegedly led to Nadine Menendez's 
ownership of a Mercedes-Benz C300 convertible car. Prosecutors allege that Uribe made payments for the car in 
exchange for the senator's help in influencing New Jersey state criminal prosecutions of two Uribe associates. One 
of them, Elvis Parra, was charged with insurance fraud in New Jersey. The New York Times (06/05, Tully, Weiser) 
also reported on the story.

Office, DEA Miami Field Division, FBI Miami, and several police departments, including Davie, Fort Lauderdale, and
