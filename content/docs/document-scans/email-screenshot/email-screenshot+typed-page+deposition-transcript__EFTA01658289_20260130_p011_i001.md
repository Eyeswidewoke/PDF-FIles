In a commentary in the Washington Examiner (7/30, 448K), Becket Adams writes, "White 
House spin is nothing new, though the press's frenetic coverage of the Trump Administration 
would have you believe otherwise. During the Obama years, for example, the White House and 
its allies had a go-to strategy for dismissing unflattering reports and outright scandals. They 
would note simply of whatever story threatened to damage the White House that it happened a 
long time ago, as if the passage of time itself was a defense or an explanation." She contends, 
"Valerie Jarrett's appearance this week on the Fox Business Network is merely a reminder that 
the Trump Administration is not the first to declare simply that its scandals are non-stories. 
Also, given that the 'old news' tactic was the go-to strategy for the Obama Administration, it 
should not surprise you to see that Jarrett is still leaning on this trick, even years removed from 
the White House." 
Book Review: Jeffrey Toobin's "True Crimes And Misdemeanors" On Trump 
Impeachment. 
In a book review in the Washington Post (7/30, 14.2M), Carlos Lozada reviews Jeffrey Toobin's 
new book, 'True Crimes and Misdemeanors,' which explores "the inquiry into Russian electoral 
interference as well as the Ukraine scandal that led to Trump's impeachment and Senate trial." 
Lozada writes, "A staff writer for the New Yorker and a legal analyst for CNN, Toobin has written 
books on the Bill Clinton investigation and the Iran-contra scandal; he had served as a young 
prosecutor in the latter case. A Toobin book on the Trump investigations seemed inevitable. In 
an author's note, Toobin says he interviewed members of Mueller's staff, subjects and witnesses 
in the probe, Trump's legal team and members of his administration, as well as lawmakers. 
Specific sources usually go unnamed, and Toobin also relies on reporting and analysis by The 
Washington Post, the New York Times, Lawfare and others. Put together, this all gives the book 
an authoritative, omniscient-narrator quality." 
Op-Ed: Steele's Failings Go Far Beyond Dodgy "Dossier." 
In an op-ed in the Washington Times (7/30, 492K), retired CIA officer Daniel Hoffman writes, 
"President Trump earlier this month publicly called for the extradition of former British MI6 
Intelligence Officer Christopher Steele. ... Steele's dossier made a number of other sensational 
but inaccurate claims, including that Mr. Fridman and Mr. Aven provided Mr. Putin with foreign 
policy guidance; that former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen traveled to Prague to conspire with 
Russian hackers; and that Russian intelligence possessed a salacious blackmail tape of Mr. 
Trump himself." He contends, "Mr. Steele would best serve his own interests - and the national 
security of both the UK and US - with a mea culpa admitting his errors of judgment and laying 
out the multitude of lessons we should learn from his shoddy work product." 
Bongino Says Durham's Report Will Be "Horrifying For The Democrats." 
The Washington Examiner (7/30, Chaitin, 448K) reports that, according to conservative 
commentator Dan Bongino, Democrats are "terrified by what US Attorney John Durham will put 
in his report." Fox News host Sean Hannity "had the former Secret Service agent and Rep. 
Devin Nunes (R-CA), the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, on his show 
Wednesday night, and they touched on Attorney General William Barr's testimony the day 
before in which he refused to rule out releasing Durham's report before Election Day." Hannity 
"mentioned that Democrats are 'scared to death' of Durham's criminal inquiry into the Russia 
investigation, a point which Bongino drew out in his comments." He said, "There are three 
things we know now that are going to be really horrifying for the Democrats, okay? Number 
one, we know that that January meeting happened, where we know Steele's sources were 
garbage. January of 2017, so what Mueller was doing, we still have no idea."
