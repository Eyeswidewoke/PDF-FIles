The Philadelphia Inquirer (10/19) reports that as of Monday, Pennsylvania voters "had 
requested 2.8 million mail-in and absentee ballots - 1.79 million by Democrats and nearly 
694,000 by Republicans, according to Pennsylvania Department of State data. Already, nearly 
900,000 had been returned." Reuters (10/19, Hurley), Bloomberg (10/19, Stohr, 4.73M), the 
Wall Street Journal (10/19, Bravin, Kendall, Subscription Publication, 7.57M), Politico (10/19, 
Gerstein, Montellaro, 4.29M), The Hill (10/19, Kruzel, 2.98M), and Axios (10/19, 521K) also 
cover the decision. 
In related stories, the Washington Post (10/19, 14.2M) reports Pennsylvania elections 
officials were "inundated with complaints from first-time and absentee voters having difficulty 
registering to vote or requesting a mail ballot, fueling anxiety in the critical swing state just as 
the 5 p.m. Monday deadline approaches to join the voting rolls in time for the November 
election." And the Philadelphia Inquirer (10/19, Goodin-Smith, Lai) reports that "people are 
volunteering to be poll workers in record numbers" in the Philadelphia area. In an editorial, the 
Washington Post (10/19, 14.2M) praises volunteer poll workers, writing that "even with an 
unprecedented number of ballots being cast absentee, millions will vote in-person, and poll 
workers are critical to that running smoothly. ... Younger Americans have been particularly 
responsive to the call to relieve traditionally older poll workers. ... Hopefully, this influx will 
mean a more sustainable workforce for decades to come." 
Early Voting Begins In Florida. David Muir reported on ABC World News TonightVI 
(10/19, story 2, 2:30, 7.01M) that "nearly 30 million Americans have voted already," and early 
voting got underway in Florida on Monday. ABC's Victor Oquendo said, "Torrential downpours 
didn't dampen enthusiasm on the first day of early voting in Florida. Lines starting at dawn 
stretched for more than an hour in the battleground state." The Washington Post (10/19, 
Gardner, Majchrowicz, Rosza, 14.2M) reports, "In Miami, Fort Lauderdale, Fort Myers, Sarasota, 
St. Petersburg and many other Florida communities, voters lined up before polls opened 
Monday to cast their ballots in person at the first available moment." The Miami Herald (10/19, 
1.09M) reports, "More than 2.5 million Floridians have already voted by mail. But with 
[President] Trump casting aspersions about the legitimacy of mail voting, Monday morning 
offered the first opportunity to vote in person for those voters who don't want to cast a mail 
ballot." Politico (10/19, Dixon, 4.29M) also covers the start of early voting in Florida. 
More Than 4M Texans Have Already Voted. The Houston Chronicle (10/19, 
Rosenthal) reports, "With more than 4 million votes counted as of Sunday, Texas is leading the 
pack when it comes to early voting. ... California has counted 3 million ballots, and Florida has 
seen 2.5 million people vote." 
Official Says Problems With Georgia Voting Systems Have Been Resolved. The 
Atlanta Journal-Constitution (10/19, 895K) reports Georgia Secretary of State Brad 
Raffensperger (R) "said Monday that problems with a sluggish voter check-in system have been 
resolved and wait times have fallen as early voting turnout surges." He said voters "should 
expect a smooth early voting process after technical changes were made last week to the state 
computer system that looks up voter registration and check-in information at polling places." 
Absentee Ballot Delivery Delayed In Parts Of Ohio. The Cleveland Plain Dealer 
(10/19, 895K) reports, "Nearly two weeks after absentee ballots were to be sent to Ohio voters, 
thousands are still waiting for their ballots due to delays with a Cleveland-based printing 
company serving 16 counties, including Cuyahoga, Lorain and Summit." Midwest Direct "is 
keeping mum on exactly how many ballots are still delayed." 
Fire Inside Los Angeles County Ballot Dropbox May Have Been Intentional. The 
Los Angeles Times (10/19, 4.64M) reports that "a fire inside an official ballot drop box" at a Los 
Angeles County library Sunday night "may have been set intentionally, authorities said." The 
county "did not immediately respond to requests for information about the burned ballots, but 
voters who suspect their ballot may have been damaged in the Baldwin Park blaze can check 
the county's official ballot tracker for status updates."
