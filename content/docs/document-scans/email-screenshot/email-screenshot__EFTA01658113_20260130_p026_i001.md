Twitter Says Hackers Likely Accessed Direct Messages Of 36 Users. 
The Hill (7/23, Axelrod, 2.98M) reports, "Twitter said that hackers who broke into its system 
last week were likely able to read the direct messages of 36 accounts, including those of one 
elected official in the Netherlands. 'We believe that for up to 36 of the 130 targeted accounts, 
the attackers accessed the DM inbox, including 1 elected official in the Netherlands. To date, we 
have no indication that any other former or current elected official had their DMs accessed,' the 
social media giant said in an updated press release Wednesday night. 'We are actively working 
on communicating directly with the account-holders that were impacted." The Hill adds, "The 
FBI is currently investigating to try to identify the hackers." 
Reuters (7/23, Menn, Paul, Satter) reports, "Twitter Inc and the FBI are investigating the 
breach that allowed hackers to repeatedly tweet from verified accounts of the likes of 
Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates, Tesla Chief 
Executive Elon Musk and former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg. Twitter said on Saturday that 
the perpetrators 'manipulated a small number of employees and used their credentials' to log 
into tools and turn over access to 45 accounts. here On Wednesday, it said that the hackers 
could have read direct messages to and from 36 accounts but did not identify the affected 
users. The former employees familiar with Twitter security practices said that too many people 
could have done the same thing, more than 1,000 as of earlier in 2020, including some at 
contractors like Cognizant." 
FBI Bulletin: ELDs Did Not Follow Cybersecurity Guidelines. 
Land Line Maaazine (7/23, Berg, 607K) reports, "Industry and academic research into a 
selection of self-certified electronic logging devices found those in the sample did little to 
nothing to follow cybersecurity best practices and were vulnerable to compromise. That's the 
takeaway from a cybersecurity bulletin issued by the FBI's Cyber Division earlier this week. The 
sample included ELDs that could be purchased off the shelf at superstores and ELDs supplied by 
well-known companies." The FBI "warns that cyber criminals could exploit vulnerabilities in 
ELDs, which became required equipment in most commercial trucking operations in December 
2017. Last December was the deadline for companies using an AOBRD to switch to e-logs. 
'Although the mandate seeks to provide safety and efficiency benefits, it does not contain 
cybersecurity requirements for manufacturers or suppliers of ELDs, and there is no requirement 
for third-party validation or testing prior to the ELD self-certification process,' the bulletin 
states." 
NSA, DHS Warn Foreign Hackers Are Targeting Critical Infrastructure. 
The Hill (7/23, Miller, 2.98M) reports NSA and DI-IS' Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security 
Agency (CISA) on Thursday "warned that foreign hackers are attempting to target US critical 
infrastructure." The agencies specifically "warned that Internet-connected operational 
technology (OT) assets, used throughout US defense systems, were often the targets of 
malicious cyber actors attempting to hit critical infrastructure, such as systems providing water, 
gas and electricity." As a result, the agencies "recommended that critical infrastructure 
operators and owners take 'immediate action' to secure their systems." The agencies wrote in a 
joint alert, "Due to the increase in adversary capabilities and activity, the criticality to US 
national security and way of life, and the vulnerability of OT systems, civilian infrastructure 
makes attractive targets for foreign powers attempting to do harm to US interests or retaliate 
for perceived US aggression."

Multiple outlets including Fox Business (7/23, Schmidt, 1.73M) report on allegations that the 
personal data of Instacart customers was hacked and is being sold, which the online shopping 
platform denies.
