January 6. According to the articles, Bannon, who declared himself a "political prisoner," expressed pride in going 
to prison as a stand against what he termed the "corrupt D01" under Attorney General Merrick Garland. He had 
remained free for nearly two years while appealing his conviction, but an appeals court upheld his conviction and 
the Supreme Court declined his last-minute appeal. At the prison, Bannon was met by a mix of supporters and 
protesters, with supporters cheering and some protesters shouting accusations. The articles also mentioned that 
Bannon faces additional charges in New York related to allegedly defrauding donors for a U.S.-Mexico border wall 
project, to which he has pleaded not guilty. Additional reporting on the story was provided by the New York Times

FBI Emphasizes Role of Community and Behavioral Indicators in Preventing Surge of 4th of July Mass 
Shootings 
ABC News (07/01, Barr) reported that there has been an increase in mass shootings during the 4th of July holiday 
over the past three years, with a total of 80 incidents occurring between July 1-7 since 2021, as noted by Mark 
Bryant, the executive director of the Gun Violence Archive. In 2021, there were 25 mass shootings during this 
week, followed by 27 in 2022, and 28 in 2023. According to the article, the increase in violence during these 
celebrations is attributed to factors such as larger gatherings, high temperatures, alcohol consumption, and easy 
access to weapons during holiday events. The article explained that in mass shooting incidents, there are indicators 
and warning signs that the FBI is trying to be proactive about before something happens, according to the head of 
the FBI's Behavioral Analysis Unit (BAU). "We know that these offenders that go on to commit these mass attacks 
follow, a lot of times a very specific pathway, a very specific trajectory," Dr. Karie Gibson, the unit chief of the MU, 
told ABC News. The article noted that the FBI has a website that was launched in May that is aimed at preventing 
mass shootings and alerting of indicators that someone could be headed down the pathway to violence. Certain 
indicators, according to the FBI, are concerning jokes or comments, an interest in previous mass shootings, and 
troublesome interactions with others. "There has to be involvement before somebody has broken the law or before 
a crime has been committed. And so with this campaign, it's really highlighting the importance of the bystanders 
and how important it is for them to come forward, the significant role that they have," Gibson said. The article 
stated that the FBI urges people to contact their local field office and that sometimes an arrest or law enforcement 
action is not necessary. "Many people don't realize that law enforcement has a proactive prevention arm to deal 
with individuals that are on that pathway to violence, to deal with mitigating this targeted violence that we face," 
Gibson said. 
FBI Reminds Utahns to Look Out for Signs of Potential Mass Attacks 
KSL (NBC-5) (07/01, Houck) reported that the FBI launched its "Prevent Mass Violence" campaign, which is focused 
on educating the public about the behavioral signs that might indicate someone is on a pathway to committing 
violence. Special Agent Shohini Sinha of the FBI Salt Lake City Field Office emphasized, "Active shooters, mass 
shooters, do not just 'snap," explaining that these individuals "consider, they plan, and they prepare for their 
attacks over time. Sometimes as long as years." According to the article, the campaign encourages vigilance among 
the public to recognize concerning behaviors, such as violent comments or jokes, increasing isolation, and an 
obsessive interest in prior attacks. Sinha advised, "So, if you notice anybody doing any of these things, it's 
important you talk to somebody you trust," urging the public to reach out to authorities without feeling the need 
to have all the answers. The article noted that this initiative comes in response to the FBI's findings of a significant 
increase in active shooter incidents in the U.S. since 2019. KTVX (ABC-4) (07/01, Video) provided video reporting on 
the story. 
U.S. Marshals Rescue 200 Missing Children Over Six Weeks 
Fox News (07/01, Wehner) reported that the U.S. Marshals Service successfully recovered 200 missing children 
across the United States during "Operation We Will Find You 2," a six-week national sting that ended last week. The 
article explained that the operation, which was the second of its kind, was conducted in various U.S. locations and 
led to the recovery of 123 children from dangerous situations like sex trafficking and exploitation, with the 
remainder found in safer circumstances. "There are no words to describe the terror felt by missing children, their
