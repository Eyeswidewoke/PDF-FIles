$118M in Fraudulent Health Care Claims 
KPRC (NBC-2) (05/21, Taylor) reported that a Texas doctor who falsely diagnosed his patients with chronic illnesses 
in a $118 million scheme has been sentenced to prison. The rheumatologist, Jorge Zamora-Quezada, M.D., 68, of 
Mission, was sentenced to 10 years in prison and three years of supervised release. The article noted that he was 
convicted of one count of conspiracy to commit health care fraud, seven counts of health care fraud, and one count 
of conspiracy to obstruct justice. In addition to his prison term, Zamora-Quezada was ordered to forfeit 
$28,245,454, including 13 real estate properties, along with a jet and a Maserati GranTurismo. According to the 
evidence presented at trial, Zamora-Quezada falsely diagnosed his patients with rheumatoid arthritis and 
administered toxic medications in order to defraud Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE, and Blue Cross Blue Shield. A DOJ 
press release quoted Special Agent in Charge Aaron Tapp of the FBI's San Antonio Field Office, who said, "The FBI is 
dedicated to working with all of our partners to address health care fraud. This case was not only a concern to us 
because of the financial loss — the physical and emotional harm suffered by the patients and their families was 
alarming and profound. We hope this significant sentence will help bring closure to the many victims in this case?'
