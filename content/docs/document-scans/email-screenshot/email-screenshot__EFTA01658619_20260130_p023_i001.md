"purported member." Some critics have compared the group "to the totalitarian, male-
dominated society of Margaret Atwood's novel `The Handmaid's Tale," while others "call it an 
ultraconservative group with an unusual mix of Roman Catholic and Pentecostal traditions." 
People of Praise "has about 1,700 members in 22 cities in the United States, Canada and the 
Caribbean, according to its website." 
Townhall (9/22, Rosas, 177K) reports Newsweek published a story on Monday claiming 
that the group was the inspiration for the Atwood novel, which is not true. Newsweek "has since 
changed the headline" to "How Charismatic Catholic Groups Like Amy Coney Barrett's People of 
Praise Inspired `The Handmaid's Tale' since Atwood "has never specified which group was the 
inspiration for her book." Breitbart (9/22, Nolte, 673K) writes, "The far-left Newsweek just fired 
off around a thousand words falsely accusing Amy Coney Barrett of inspiring the dystopian 
feminist thriller The Handmaid's Tale, and has been forced to retract it." 
Schumer Moves To Block "Business As Usual" In Senate. The Hill (9/22, Carney, 
2.98M) reports, "Senate Democrats are limiting the ability to hold committee hearings in 
retaliation for Republicans decision to try to fill a Supreme Court seat in the middle of an 
election year, the first action in what is likely to be an increasingly combative battle over 
procedure in the Senate." Senate Minority Leader Schumer this week "invoked the so-called 
`two hour rule,' which can be used to limit the ability to hold committee hearings," which led to 
the cancellation of a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing Tuesday. Schumer said from the 
Senate floor, "Because the Senate Republicans have no respect for the institution, we won't 
have business as usual here in the Senate." 
New Justice Could "Make Or Break" ACA Challenge. NBC Nightly NewsVi (9/22, 
story 2, 2:00, Holt, 5.78M) reported, "The Supreme Court's new term begins in less than two 
weeks with several high profile cases. A justice appointed by President Trump will have a 
profound effect on how they are decided." NBC's Pete Williams added, "A make-or-break 
challenge to the Affordable Care Act could affect the most Americans. ... Justice Ginsburg twice 
before voted to uphold the law, and her absence will embolden the law's opponents. Even if a 
more conservative court finds part of it unconstitutional, it's possible the court will say Congress 
did not intend the entire law to be tossed out. If the court is leaning that way, it might be 
especially reluctant to strike down the health care law in the middle of a pandemic with record 
unemployment." 
GOP To Ask Supreme Court To Limit Mail Voting In Pennsylvania. 
The Hill (9/22, 2.98M) reports, "Republicans plan to ask the Supreme Court to review a major 
Pennsylvania state court ruling that extended the due date for mail ballots in the key 
battleground state." The move comes after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court "dealt Republicans 
a major blow last week in a bitterly partisan election lawsuit." The expected petition to the 
Supreme Court comes just days after Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's death. 
Trump Uses UN Address To Blast China's Handling Of Pandemic Outbreak. 
The President's address to the UN General Assembly Tuesday, which was pre-recorded, 
garnered little media attention. None of the networks covered the address in their broadcasts 
Tuesday night. Trump, Reuters (9/22, Nichols, Holland) reports, "facing a November re-election 
battle with the United States dealing with the world's highest official number of deaths and 
infections from the coronavirus, focused his speech on attacking China." The President told the 
General Assembly "that China must be held accountable for having `unleashed' C0VID-19 on 
the world." 
Along similar lines, the AP (9/22, Riechmann) reports, "Under fire for his own handling of 
the coronavirus, Trump cast blame on China, noting the virus began there and accusing the 
Chinese government of acting irresponsibly in failing to contain it." Said the President, "The 
United Nations must hold China accountable for their actions," without "elaborating on what 
punishment he thought was warranted."
