Re: currency question 
inner domain, =AO goals are self created. mastabatory fantasies. =or example. rewards in sub domains, social 
physical emotional.=, some hard wired food, temp. etc. a continum of h=rd to self imagined. . adapted for the outer 
domain, I environ=ent, . 
outer domain subject to laws of physics .=C2 
inner domain , biologically yes,=C2 but ghosts, beliefs self deception 
and delusion, and most impo=tantly hope, all actualized. 
It makes little =ense to apply an evidenced based system in the inner domain, i= is comprised of a non cummative li 
grouping, . no symme=ry for example. however the image of your fantasy girl c=njured up while you pleasure 
yourself , is a real to the innner self=as the cigarette you smoke afterwards is to the outer domain. 
=AO Inner rewards would have been subject to natural selection, =so that random killing in the inner world would 
unlikely be ad=ptive. acts of inner revenge however could blow off steam and =ave outer world consequences. 
religion acts as one of many pr=posed belief systems to help construct an inner life. where th= unpowerful are 
effective. it makes as little sense for it to be a I=gic system operating in the outer domain as little as a science base= 
view on the evidence of my fantasy girl. you should fin= some highly correlated inner and outer rewards but as many 
uncorrel=ted. depression might mean ignoring the outside altogether„ =etreating into an inner self in order not to do 
harm. 
=he inner life should be normally distributed over subdomains as well as a =omgenious popualtion . so that some in the 
group receive social plea=ure, some only physical. etc. 
In the game theo=y analogy, the reserves both in the inner and outer domain play a su=stantial role. . there are many 
experiments that show that a rationa= being modulates his reserves so that they last a long time. only in=certain 
circumstances can you access these reserves on purpose. =AO jet pilots told to hold their hands in ice water , until th=y 
can't take it pull out in under 150 seconds. however if you te=l them to last for 180 to make the grade 80 percent are 
capable. .=C2 hope meanining purpose. all self created fictions that are selected =or. . there are outward signs , 
confidnece , smiling, that cr=ate an outer group; 
religioin is a logic system that intersec=s that of science .ie being kind, has benefits in outer as we=l as inner domains -
as goals are aligned, believing that moha=med rode to heaven on a horse. is ok, if it satiates the inner self.=C2 reduces 
blood pressure„ but unable to withstand the rigor of the o=ter mathematics. and is dangerious but so is that blonde, 
=AO girl that always does as she is asked in your fantasy, =AO. uh oh, you actually married her.
