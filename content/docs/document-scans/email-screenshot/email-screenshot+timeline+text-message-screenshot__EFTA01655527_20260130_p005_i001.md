The Washington Examiner (11/15, LaChance) reported that Deputy Director Bongino rejected a ProPublica (11/14, 
Turton, Bing) report claiming Director Patel had waived his required FBI polygraph examination, calling the 
allegation "a complete fabrication." ProPublica said Director Patel granted Deputy Director Bongino a waiver even 
though the exam is mandatory for all new FBI employees, and that outside lawyers told the outlet that Deputy 
Director Bongino's "Schedule C" political-appointee status would not exempt him. ProPublica also reported that 
Director Patel granted similar waivers to two other senior FBI employees, Marshall Yates and Nicole Rucker, and 
noted prior scrutiny when Director Patel declined to answer Senate questions about alleged "disqualifying alerts" in 
polygraph results. The article noted that Sen. Dick Durbin reposted the report on X and wrote, "FBI Director Patel 
refused to respond to whistleblower reports that people failed polygraph tests at the FBI. Now we know why." On 
Saturday, Deputy Director Bongino stated: "Claiming I was hired 'with no background check' is just a lie. It's a 
complete fabrication. I held a security clearance, while protecting Democrat and Republican presidents, for over 
ten years. And all of the background check requirements for my current position as Deputy Director of the FBI have 
been met. Those are simple facts." The Daily Beast (11/15, Francis), Daily Mail (11/15, Raasch), and Newsweek 
(11/16, Silverman) also reported on the story. 
Senate Probes Justice Department Effort to Thwart FBI Investigation of Clinton's Dossier Payments 
The Washington Times (11/14, Ferrechio) reported that the Senate Judiciary Committee is investigating allegations 
that Justice Department officials previously thwarted an FBI inquiry into the Clinton campaign's concealed 
payments for the Steele dossier. The piece explained that Sen. Grassley released 2019 emails showing an FBI agent 
raising concerns about "unambiguous concealment" of Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign 
payments to Fusion GPS, and asserting that DOJ officials Richard Pilger and J.P. Cooney shut down the inquiry. 
According to the article, the FBI agent told a supervisor that Pilger used veiled threats "intended to have a chilling 
effect and stop me from asking questions," adding that he had "never been met with such suspicion or response 
intended to have me go away." The article detailed how Grassley sent a letter to AG Bondi and Director Patel 
requesting additional records related to the halted FBI probe, arguing that "the same partisans who rushed to 
cover for Clinton rabidly pursued Arctic Frost." The article noted that neither the Clinton campaign nor the DNC 
faced criminal investigation over the reporting concealment, though both were later fined by the FEC for 
misreporting the payments used to fund the dossier.

COUNTERTERRORISM 
Terror Plot Arrests Reveal 'More Dangerous' Online Pathway to ISIS Radicalization in America 
CNN (11/16, Boxer) reported that six young men from New Jersey, Michigan, and Washington state were arrested 
in an alleged ISIS-inspired terror plot that authorities say involved encrypted online communications promoting 
attacks in the United States, including a potential Halloween-timed plot in Michigan. The piece detailed how 
investigators believe the Michigan plan could have approached the scale of the 2015 Paris attacks before the FBI 
and its partners intervened. According to the article, FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force operations unfolded across 
multiple states as authorities disrupted what officials described as interconnected online networks facilitating self-
radicalization, weapons training, and coordination with ISIS-linked individuals overseas. The article included 
statements underscoring the FBI's role, noting scenes of FBI agents at raid sites in Michigan and New Jersey and 
highlighting NYPD Deputy Commissioner Rebecca Weiner's description of the case as "an incredibly significant 
disruption." The article noted that officials emphasized both the growing danger of online radicalization networks 
and the complexity of ISIS-inspired terrorism in 2025, with Weiner praising the FBI's work and warning that 
"conventional terrorism is unfortunately alive and well." MLive (11/14, Shalhout) also reported on the story. 
Feds Expand Terrorism Charges in July Shooting at Texas Immigration Detention Center 
The Associated Press (11/14, Staff Writer) reported that federal prosecutors in Texas have charged six more people 
with terrorism-related charges in the July shooting at the Prairieland Detention Center near Dallas. According to the 
article, the charges stem from a July 4 shooting that injured a police officer and include rioting, attempted murder, 
and weapons and explosives charges. The article noted that six others are scheduled to enter guilty pleas in the 
case, which relies on President Trump's declaration that deems the antifa movement a domestic terrorist 
organization.
