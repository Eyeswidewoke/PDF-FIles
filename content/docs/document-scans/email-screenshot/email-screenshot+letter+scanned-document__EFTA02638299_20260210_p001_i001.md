1 Leon- had I known from the beginning what i know now,Q=A0 I would never have gotten involved with =span 
id="m_1646602899778344326:27c.1">Ana s issue n=ver ! ever.! . / I have 40 years of experience dealing w=th the IRS 
, I never have cheated ,evaded or crafted rid=culous returns . 
I am maniacal in takingQ=A0 carefully crafted 
thoughtful positions that even if I don't r=ceive the full benefit ( i have no recollection of any total loss on=any 
position.) I get most of it.. Hence my cred=bility with the IRS is quite unique and one of my most important ass=ts. 
as you know 
my research is detailed , the case laws=C240 relevant and though the arguments are sometimes hot 
there is great r=spect on both sides. 
. 
Anas situation is emblematic of=my warning s and advice that it appears still continues to go unheed=d. . I have 
repeatedly told you that these girls , all w=nt to show how clever they are. they, come from countries where tax=s are 
rarely paid and on top of that , they have no experience with =eal rules, money or biz . they often push the envelope 
b=yond the pale 
unfortunately usually ending up getting =he principal in serious trouble.. ( sometimes by design, I 
as=ume not in this case, though she would not be unhappy to see Debra find ou= about it . ). For six months I have 
asked you , her and her g=y bookkeeper if there was something i didn't know or wasn't being =old , as I found this 
particular audit highly unusual.- =highly ! - not helpful that you with the usual voice of author=ty telling me in no 
uncertain terms "what the agent real=y wants" . I continue to be amazed how you , Barry, and brad share very strong 
detailed views without h=ving even one day of true experience. and relying on joslin and toms pronouncements . 
Q=A0 I will review with you the ugly facts only on the phone . <=r> 
2. I can easily ignore the fact that your repeated =regarding the detectability of the first 100 million that saved 
your=financial life. and provided a resurrection of 3 billion dollars of=C2*grats that had died is never balanced by the 
reco=nition of what you received and frankly not to date- paid for = Each time you have chosen not to pay what we 
agreed. or what=has been written by me in many emails BEFORE the transactions are co=plete. you tell me that tom 
and joslins advice is=one of the reasons that you feel you shouldn't pay the amount owed wri=ten or agreed. ( mind 
you , this only happens AFTER you =ave received the benefits of my advice ) In the big tran=action - you then add the 
easily refuted and silly argument th=t it was Alan's idea. BTW It is , and would ha=e been super easy for you to set a 
meeting if you had chosen to get =o the bottom of this farce.. you have met with brad. th=re are memos. 
there are 
emails ( which you choose not e=en to look at , for , I can only assume . for fear that ihis fabrications is as clear as I 
sug=est it to be . ). NOW - lets assume that i show you that alan<=span> had only an irrelevant minuscule involvement 
,at the very end . Q=A0 way after the fact , no serious involvement in the crafting or ex=cution of the idea - in a 
transaction that saved your family 600 mil=ion dollars. or re detectability that in fac= the first hundred or the full 175 
actually now gets you a benefit t=at you have been going on about . . what then ?! will t=ere be more reasons that r , 
why agreed amounts should not be paid. =r is this an exercise solely for amusement . not mine 
3 It seems you have forgotten that it was you,=that asked for my HELP! . Gigi, Carlyn, audi= , gift tax audit audit.
