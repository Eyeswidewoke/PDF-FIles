Merry Christmas.... 
Hope you are doing ok 
Updates from me 
I'm attending in Seattle over holidays but enjoying using my brain. I've bee= trying hard to ignore everything around me 
and focus on things I understan= 
Figured out a way to do a brain biopsy non invasive 
Sort of as cool as when we figured out how to do the SPM around fMRI. 
It's all physics and math but I think can be done. Took idea to chairman of n=urosurgery at hopkins and he was blown 
away. I go back jan 9 to discuss. Ev=n if I can't do it someone should...lt's actually so simple and I am just n=t sure why 
folks don't do already. Needs a bit more math and some coding (c=mputational / post processing interface) but maybe 
something neat. It will b=at Biopsy every single time and in minutes. 
And 2 weeks ago I started a company called endobiotica around cataloging and=sequencing non pathogenic gut bacteria 
in partnership w the ICDDRB in Bangl=desh. Small but focused and exactly what we had discussed before. Bugs me n= 
one was doing it...Pretty cool esp if I can get fecal samples from healthy=babies and grown ups in weird places like Tibet 
or Nepal where they never g=t sick. Got one of my former employees to be ceo and run it and a Banglades=i firm called 
Waste Concern that I know and love the guys (engineers and ch=mists) to operationalize. Not much for me to do except 
keep guiding them. 1=put in 10k of my savings which goes a super long way there. And i think in t=e coming few weeks 
will have a web page. Not in a hurry and leaving it to t=em to manage. Money only comes in identification of cool things 
and possibl= just selling the whole company, catalogue and concept. But costs nothing t= do and all upside. Plus I hate 
idea of "prebiotic" and "probiotic" when ac=ually it really is endobiotic...not antibiotic. That balance of good bugs i= 
magic. 
Anyway - all science based. Still think vagus is awesome space too but need t= think a bit more on how to do. 
Feb 19 is the bond launch in Dakar. Will be first w Africa muni Bond and we finally did it - took 5 years. If you want to 
join for launch th= prez and mayor will be there and lots of conversation possible about your f=iend. There is likely to be 
a ton of press. 
Also met A Rod and really liked him. He's insecure but a lot smarter than pp= think. He just happens to be good at 
baseball. And quite handsome. 
Have been in touch a bunch w Jack Ma and his team. Mostly around Davos. I Li=e his crazy phrenic brain. Can't tell if he 
is genius or crazy or both. Hop=fully both. 
The African Union (AU) - dr Zuma herself - asked me to shape the Africa CDC w=ich is kind of cool. Been leading that 
team and exercise from my office at t=e Bank with backup and money from Strive and hopefully if we get it right c=uld 
be a big legacy for the AU. Ebola stuff so political and silly. 
That's it from here
