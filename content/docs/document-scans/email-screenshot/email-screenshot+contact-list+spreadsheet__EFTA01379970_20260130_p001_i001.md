Frieze Masters 
The e year in London, Frieze Masters is a pre-2000 works fair, situated 10 minute walk across Regent's Park 
from Frieze London. We are delighted to announce that this year we will have a small light refreshments 
Lounge at Frieze Masters which clients can access for the duration of the fair. The Lounge at Masters will 
have its own private entrance and can be accessed from 10am on Preview Day and for the duration of the 
fair. The focus of the DB hospitality program will still be the main Deutsche Bank Wealth Management 
Lounge in Frieze London, but this is great addition to our client offering in 2017. 
VIP Preview Day - Wednesday, October 4 (times TBC) 
On Preview Day, the fair is open exclusively to Deutsche Bank Wealth Management and its clients, Frieze 
VIPs and members of the press. Preview Day is sought after as the majority of buying takes place on this day. 
Guests will have access to hospitality in the Deutsche Bank Wealth Management Lounge along with opportunities 
to take guided tours and meet Deutsche Bank art curators. Clients who are invited on Preview Day will receive VIP 
benefits, which include invitations to Frieze private events in London and multiple entry into the fair for its duration. 
Our VIP lounge opens at 10:00am, 1 hour prior to the fair opening at 11:00am.
