Politico (08/06, Sakellarladis, Gerstein) reported that the federal court filing system, including CM/ECF and Pacer, has been hit by a sweeping 
hack, highlighting its struggle to keep pace with cybersecurity threats. According to the article, Michael Scudder, who chairs the Committee on 
Information Technology, has stated that the current system is "outdated, unsustainable due to cyber risks, and requires replacement". The article 
explained that the federal Judiciary holds sensitive information, which makes it a target for "unrelenting security threats of extraordinary 
gravity", and as of July 2022, the Justice Department was investigating another hack of the federal court system that involved three foreign 
hacking groups and dated back to early 2020. The article highlighted that the FBI referred POLITICO to the Justice Department, which did

New National Cyber Director Cairncross Faces Challenges on Policy, Bureaucracy, Threats 
CyberScoop (08/06, Starks) reported that Sean Cairncross has taken office as the national cyber director, a pivotal moment for the role, and will 
need to shape the office's future, tackle policy issues, and address key threats. According to the article, Cairncross faces challenges such as 
harmonizing federal cybersecurity regulations, renewing the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act, and strengthening public•private 
partnerships. He will also need to confront evolving cyber threats, including those from Chinese hackers and attacks on critical infrastructure, 
while navigating the office's standing within the federal government despite having less cybersecurity experience than his predecessors. The 
article quoted an email from Brian Harrell, a former infrastructure protection official at the DHS and the CISA in Trump's first term: "ONCD must 
be seen as the air traffic controller on all things cyber moving forward. Given the agency rebuild happening at CISA, and new leadership at the FBI 
and NSA cyber, now is the time to build influence and patch struggling relationships. Add to this a private sector that is unsure where to turn to 
during a crisis. Sean must be seen as a convener and facilitator to get the President the right information to make key decisions."
