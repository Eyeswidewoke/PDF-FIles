I never wanted to be the one that wanted anything from you other than a long friendship we have, you 
always tell me how many people "want things" from you and I will never be that person never...This 
whole idea was yours not mine and I am very upset that its not going to happen not for me but for the 
kids, because I told them and showed them "there new rooms" and they of course being kids told all 
there friends. You made a generous offer and I though you and your millions of people that work from 
you were going "to figure this out" I am in no position to do so. I wish I was. 
Initially I spoke with michael and he told me there are 100 different ways to structure this and that he 
would speak with Darren which he did( after leaving several messages) Darren didn't know what he was 
talking about and had no idea what you were trying to accomplish he also told me he knew of no urgency 
regarding the matter. Michael suggested to Darren to have your tax people work out what works best for 
you and your structure, he said he is in no position not understanding your tax structure to do this blind. 
That's when you told me michael is clueless and that Darren was going to deal with everything which was 
fine for me. Darren wrote me 2 emails today that I was so upset by that I cant believe that you would 
have instructed he write to me. You know my position here and you told me over 50 times of more not to 
worry you were going to do this with me not only have I been blown off but I was so insulted and he 
basically said it was because of my this has taken so long... and that's why its not done. I want nothing 
from anyone in life I have gotten this far on my own and never once did I ask you or any of my friends for 
anything actually just the opposite I was(and am) always the one everyone calls for help(including you) 
and ever did I or will I wavier when a friend asks for help big or small...I an so embarrassed by this entire 
endeavor not to mention how much time and money it cost me but your friendship is more important to 
me than any amount of money... 
As always 
Your friend 
me
