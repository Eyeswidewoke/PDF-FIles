machine vendors compared notes about possible cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns." 
In November, "that same war room could be in operation for a week or longer as officials ward 
off attacks aimed at undermining early voting, counting late-arriving mail ballots and knocking 
back phony rumors that try to erode faith in the election's outcome." It will include "in-person 
meetings in Washington to hash through classified and unclassified information and an online 
'situational awareness room' open to election officials across the nation." A senior official at 
DHS's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said, "That will remain in place, frankly, 
until the election community says, 'Okay, you can stand down now. We're in good shape." 
Intelligence Officials Say Mail-In Ballots Not Susceptible To Widespread Fraud. 
ABC News (8/27, 2.97M) reports that as intelligence officials have "concluded that mail-in 
ballots are not susceptible to widespread fraud." A senior FBI official told reporters on a 
conference call Wednesday, "We're fully aware that COVID-19 and the expectation of the 
increased mail-in ballots has created a new environment for this election cycle." However, the 
official added, "we have not seen to date a coordinated national voter fraud effort during a 
major election. It would be extraordinarily difficult to change a federal election outcome 
through this type of fraud alone, given the range of processes that we need to be affected or 
compromised by an adversary, at the local level." 
Rosen: Foreign Influence Fears "Shouldn't Stop Voters." MeriTalk (8/27, 
Weingarten) reports Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen urged Americans this week "to 
participate fully in the democratic process and realize that the fear of 'malign influence' on 
elections are as old as the country itself." Speaking at the Center for Strategic and International 
Studies, Rosen said, "Every American can control who they vote for" and explained the 
"distinction between voting infrastructure and the somewhat more elusive malign influence 
activities." He "said the former, which includes polling places and printed ballots, has been well 
protected historically, and even more so through increased security efforts over the past few 
years." 
Similarly, The Washington Times (8/27, Lovelace, 492K) reports Rosen on Thursday 
"accused left-leaning news organizations of deliberately spreading 'disinformation' about the 
Trump administration's views of the dangers from mail-in voting and foreign influence in the 
2020 elections." The resulting confusion has "helped create an opening for America's 
adversaries like Russia and China to exploit, Mr. Rosen told The Washington Times." Rosen "said 
new efforts by the Justice Department, FBI, Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and 
other federal agencies have overhauled how the government addresses foreign influence efforts 
and what it makes public." 
Opinion: US Should "Enlist The Security Community" To Safeguard Election. In a 
piece for SC Magazine (8/27, Camp), ESET security researcher Cameron Camp writes that the 
US should "enlist security experts - such as those at SANS - to focus on election security 
between now and November." Camp says the security community can help "assume an 
imminent breach of integrity and develop a meaningful response plan," begin a "long-term plan 
to build a secure election stack," develop training for poll workers, work with voting equipment 
makers, and engage voters. 
Russian LinkedIn, Dropbox Hacker Argues Trial Was Flawed. 
Law360 (8/27, Subscription Publication, 8K) reports a Russian man found guilty of 
"orchestrating the 2012 cyberattacks against LinkedIn and Dropbox has urged a California 
federal judge to acquit him on all charges, arguing that his conviction rested on unreliable 
circumstantial evidence." On Tuesday, counsel for "32-year-old Yevgeniy Aleksandrovich Nikulin 
argued that evidence did not support the jury's conviction of computer intrusion, identity theft 
and other charges stemming from the attack that compromised 100 million users' data. Nikulin 
urged a California federal judge to grant him acquittal or, alternatively, a new trial."
