ICATION 
The below is being disseminated by the NYOC with approval from the MSD SAC: 
Pay-period 5 has closed. All corrections needed, regarding Special Case Code 475, will need to be entered tomorrow when 
WebTA opens back up. 
Please reach out to your Timekeeper to add the Special Case Code and make all necessary corrections. If your Timekeeper is out 
of the office, please reach out to MS-50 Human Resources Unit 2 -> NY 0550 HRU2@fbi.sgov.gov for assistance. 
The A/ADD approved Special Agent (SA) and Professional Staff (PS) overtime and a bi-weekly pay cap waiver up to the annual premium pay cap for employees 
scheduled to support the Epstein Redaction Project. 
We have created WebTA Special Case Code (SCC) 475 called "NEW YORK REDACTION PROJECT" for SAs and PS. The SCC is active beginning 03/09/2025 and is available 
until 04/05/2025. 
For Professional Staff, overtime can be claimed retroactively starting 03/09/2025. 
For Special Agents, overtime can be claimed starting 03/23/2025, in accordance with OPM regulations. If CID has not yet initiated an EC for the SCC, we'd ask your 
team to please do so at their earliest convenience. 
Please note that although the waiver up to the annual pay cap was approved, employees may see their pay checks limited to the current bi-weekly cap based on their 
FLSA status. The FBI may not pay the amounts earned above the bi-weekly cap each pay period to employees until the end of the calendar year when annual earnings 
are calculated and final payments are determined. If amounts earned in excess of the bi-weekly pay cap have caused the annual earnings to exceed the annual 
premium pay cap, only those amounts up to the annual premium pay cap can be paid. All other earnings must be forfeited. The annual premium pay cap in a given 
locality is the greater of the annualized rate payable at the end of the calendar year for either 1) GS-15, step 10 (including locality) or 2) level V of the executive 
schedule. For the annual premium pay cap in your locality, please visit syvAv clumpy. Additional information regarding FLSA status and the impact on overtime 
earnings can be found within HRD's FLSA Fast Facts 
Below is standard guidance on SCCs and WebTA. Please communicate the guidance to the HQ and field divisions with personnel scheduled and approved to work in 
support of the Epstein Redaction Project. 
Special Case Code and WebTA Guidance: 
• Timekeepers must manually add the special case code to each employee's timecard profile before they will be able to select the code. 
• When the employees are reporting their time, they will need to separate out any OT or compensatory time by selecting the special case code from the drop 
down. All other time should be reported as normal. 
• HQ and field divisions with employees scheduled and approved for OT should regularly evaluate and plan for scheduled shifts and options for alternative 
scheduling in advance of the administrative workweek (i.e., prior to midnight Sunday). 
SplcialAgent.41; 
• All Agent OT must be scheduled and approved in advance. 
• Any Agent 01 not scheduled in advance should be counted as AYR 
• Agents may only claim OT for hours that were scheduled in advance of the administrative workweek. 
• All Agents must account for their full 80 hour tour of duty (i.e. through regular hours worked and/or leave) during the pay period. 
• Any time that is claimed as OT will not count toward an Agent's regular 80 hours. 
• For an Agent's regular workday, the first 8 hours are regular time, the next 2 hours are AVP, and anything over that total is OT. 
• The FBI has the ability to adjust employees' schedules to reduce the cost to the Bureau (i.e., overtime). Immediate supervisors can set their 
employees' workweek but it needs to be done in writing in advance. 
• The above guidelines apply to TDY personnel as well as personnel working within their home division. 
• When the bi-weekly premium pay cap is reached, depending on the employees' position and FLSA status, employees may still be ordered to 
perform OT work without receiving further compensation.
