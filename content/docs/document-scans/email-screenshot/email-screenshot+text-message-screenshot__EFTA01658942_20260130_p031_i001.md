as it approaches the Keys and south Florida." The Washington Post (11/8, Cappucci, Freedman, 
14.2M) reports that if Eta "does reach hurricane intensity, it would be just the sixth such storm 
on record in the Gulf of Mexico during the month of November." 
The AP (11/8, Rodriguez) reports Florida officials "closed beaches, ports and COVID 
testing sites, shut down public transportation and urged residents to stay off the street," while 
several shelters "opened in Miami and the Florida Keys for residents in mobile homes and low 
lying areas. Broward County also shut down in-person schooling Monday and Miami seemed 
poised to do the same." The AP adds Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) "declared a state of 
emergency Saturday for eight counties at the end of the state as Eta approached, urging 
residents to stock up on supplies." USA Today (11/8, Bacon, 10.31M) reports that in a post on 
Facebook Live, National Hurricane Center Director Ken Graham said, "You're going to be dealing 
with Eta all week." Graham added, "It's going to take a lot to get this thing out of here." 
The Miami Herald (11/8, Harris, 1.09M) reports the "worst impacts" of Eta in Florida "were 
being felt far to the north with far-reaching rain bands flooding streets and leaving tens of 
thousands without power." According to the Herald, "The worst of it appeared to be in Broward 
County, where the National Weather Service issued a flash flood warning and a driver was 
hospitalized in critical condition after driving their vehicle into a flooded canal in Lauderhill. One 
Hollywood rain gauge caught more than 10 inches of rain and there were hours of storms still 
ahead." The Orlando (FL) Sentinel (11/8, Perez, Cantos, 536K) reports Eta "continues moving 
northwest at 14 mph and has tropical-storm-force winds extend up to 175 miles from the 
center." 
The New York Times (11/8, Fazio, 18.61M) reports Eta, the 28th named storm of the 2020 
hurricane season, had "devastated portions of Central America, where it started Tuesday as a 
Category 4 hurricane, leaving more than 50 dead in its wake before weakening to a tropical 
depression. The storm passed over the Cayman Islands and the northwestern Bahamas on 
Saturday and made landfall on the south-central coast of Cuba early Sunday morning." 
The Wall Street Journal (11/8, Harrup, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) provides similar 
coverage. 
Politico Analysis: Biden's "Immigration Plans Represent A Complete Reversal Of The 
Trump Administration's Policies." 
A Politico (11/7, Rainey, Bender, 4.29M) analysis says, "The most dramatic reversal in the Biden 
administration versus the Trump administration will come on President Donald Trump's 
signature campaign issue from 2016: the border wall." President-elect Biden "has pledged to 
put a swift halt to border wall construction and loosen immigration restrictions imposed by 
Trump." Previously this year, Biden said to National Public Radio, "There will not be another foot 
of wall constructed on my administration, No. 1," adding, "I'm going to make sure that we have 
border protection, but it's going to be based on making sure that we use high-tech capacity to 
deal with it." Aside from the wall, Biden's "broader immigration plans represent a complete 
reversal of the Trump administration's policies over the past several years — and he can 
accomplish much of it fairly easily."
