What a nuclea= deal with Iran could look like

has=shifted from whether a deal is possible to what sort of deal is acceptable= While such discussions can often seem a 
miasma of centrifuge counts and e=richment levels, there are, in fact, two distinct paths to a nuclear deal with Iran. 
The first path is o=e in which Tehran would receive relief from sanctions in exchange for putt=ng strict limits on its 
nuclear activities, such as restricting uranium en=ichment to low levels. The success of such an agreement would depend 
on ensuring that Iran could not use decl=red nuclear activities as a cover for covert activities aimed at developin= a 
nuclear weapon. It would also depend on ensuring that the deal was not =asily reversible, so Tehran could not renege 
once pressure had been alleviated. There are ways that sanction= relief could be made more easily reversible — for 
example, channeling o=l payments to Tehran through a single mechanism that could be blocked in t=e event of 
noncompliance — but none of these is fail-safe. The efficacy and durability of a deal over limited =nrichment would rest 
on Iranian transparency. To be meaningful, transparen=y measures would have to include allowing inspectors 
unfettered access to =ites of their choosing, not just those declared by Iranian officials, and a comprehensive accounting 
of Ira='s past and present nuclear work, including the military elements of its=nuclear program, such as weaponization 
research. Coming clean in thi= manner is a prerequisite for the success of any deal that leaves in place dual-use nuclear 
capabilities. Countries =hat have divulged their nuclear secrets, such as South Africa, have procee=ed to cooperate 
peacefully with the international community on atomic ener=y. Those that continued to obfuscate despite agreements, 
such as North Korea <http://www.washingtonpost.co=/world/satellite-images-suggest-north-korea-restarted-small-
nuclear-reacto=-us-institute-says/2013/09/11/5484039e-lb49-11e3-8685-5021e0c41964_story.h=ml> , experienced 
deeper isol=tion and external tensions. 
Iran appears to pre=er the latter model. While its officials profess a desire for cooperation,=they continue to dismiss as 
"unfounded allegations" evidence deemed =93credible" by the International Atomic Energy Agency that Iran has 
engaged in nuclear work related to weapons. Iran cont=nues to deny inspectors access to suspected nuclear sites and 
key personne=, and it seeks to constrict their activities within the bounds of its decl=red nuclear program. 
Even in the best ci=cumstances, it would take time to establish confidence that Iran had truly=given up its nuclear 
weapons aspirations. Allies such as Israel and the Gu=f states would distrust Iranian intentions, while Iranians would 
bristle at the intrusiveness of inspections. Absent a=strategic shift by Iran, a deal on limited enrichment is more likely to 
in=rease those tensions than to defuse them: Iran would seek to hide or deny =ctivities for which the United States and 
its allies have convincing evidence; Iran's adversaries would=seek to match its nuclear capabilities; and erstwhile allies 
such as Russi= and China would drift away from the unlikely coalition currently led by W=shington. The unlikelihood of 
a change of heart by Iranian leaders suggests a second, more straightforward=path to an agreement: requiring Iran to 
dismantle its nuclear program in e=change for any relief from sanctions, which would be increased should Tehr=n refuse 
to yield. In this model, Iran would have to suspend enrichment- and reprocessing-related activities=as demanded by the 
U.N. Security Council, dismantle its underground enrich=ent facility at Fordow and export its stockpiles of enriched 
uranium, amon= other steps. The obvious objection to such a deal is that it may be too difficult to achieve; even U.S. 
negot=ators have characterized this stance as "maximalist." But any deal mus= be evaluated in comparison to plausible
