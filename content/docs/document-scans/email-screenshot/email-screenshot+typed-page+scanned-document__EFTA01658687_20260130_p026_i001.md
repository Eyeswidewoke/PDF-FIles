The Monroe (LA) News Star (9/2, 64K) reports, "A Youngsville man received a three-year 
sentence for a million-dollar Ponzi scheme orchestrated through a limited liability company." 
Donnie Laing, Jr., 40, was sentenced by US District Judge Terry A. Doughty "on a charge of wire 
fraud. Laing received 36 months in prison, followed by three years of supervised release. He 
was also ordered to pay $918,531 in restitution to the victims of this scheme." Laing "pled 
guilty in March 2020 to wire fraud in connection with a million-dollar Ponzi scheme that he 
orchestrated through his limited liability company, Capital Energy Investments, LLC." Investors 
"were led to believe that Capital would use their money to invest in oil and gas equipment, and 
then lease such equipment to companies engaged in oil and gas exploration activities for a 
profit, promising investors high rates of return on their investments. Instead, Laing used the 
victims' investments for his own personal use."
