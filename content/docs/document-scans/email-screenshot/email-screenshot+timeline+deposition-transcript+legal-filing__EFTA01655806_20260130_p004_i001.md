suspected terrorist is apprehended at the border, "When a known or suspected terrorist, as in known that they're a 
known or suspected terrorist is apprehended at the border, I'm confident in the vast majority of instances there's 
very close lash-up between FBI and DHS on it." However, Director Wray pointed out a critical vulnerability, "The 
bigger concern is a situation, for example, where somebody presents fake identification documents at the border 
and there's not biometrics to match up—so there's no way to be able to know that they're not who they say they 
are. Then, they get into the country; then somehow we find out that they're someone in fact who's on the list." In 
response to Sen. Jon Ossoff's inquiry regarding the threat level of terrorism associated with unlawful entry through 
the southern border, Director Wray underscored the gravity of the situation, especially in light of recent global 
events. "We are concerned about the terrorism implications from potential targeting of vulnerabilities at the 
border," Director Wray responded. He further noted the escalated threat level due to various extremist groups, 
"Well, even before October 7, I would have told this committee that we were at a heightened threat level from a 
terrorism perspective," Director Wray remarked, emphasizing the unique situation of facing elevated threats from 
homegrown violent extremists, domestic violent extremists, foreign terrorist organizations, and state-sponsored 
terrorist organizations simultaneously. Bloomberg (03/12, Martin) also quoted Director Wray: "You've seen a 
veritable rogue's gallery of foreign terrorist organizations calling for terrorist attacks against us in a way that we 
haven't seen in a long, long time," Director Wray told the House Intelligence Committee. "This is a time not for 
panic, but for heightened vigilance given the risk," Director Wray said. Newsmax (03/12, McCarthy) reported 
that Vice Chairman Marco Rubio asked Director Wray whether the FBI has seen crimes committed by people with 
ties to foreign gangs or other criminal organizations. "From an FBI perspective, we are seeing a wide array of very 
dangerous threats that emanate from the border, and that includes everything from the drug trafficking, and the 
FBI alone sees enough fentanyl in the last two years to kill 270 million people," Director Wray said. "That's just on 
the fentanyl side. An awful lot of violent crime in the United States is at the hands of gangs who are themselves 
involved in the distribution of that fentanyl." 
U.S. Intel Chief Says She Can't Rule out Possibility That China Will Use TikTok to Influence 2024 Elections 
CNN (03/12, Lyngaas) and Reuters (03/12, Martina, Zengerle) reported that the Director of National Intelligence 
Avril Haines and other U.S. intelligence officials testified before the House Intelligence Committee, stating that they 
"cannot rule out" the possibility of the Chinese government using TikTok to influence the 2024 U.S. elections. 
According to the article, this concern follows reports of TikTok being used for propaganda efforts during the 2022 
midterm elections, as outlined in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence's annual Threat Assessment 
report. The article added that Director Wray highlighted the difficulty in detecting influence operations via TikTok's 
algorithm, describing it as a "pernicious risk," and expressed concerns about the Chinese government potentially 
pressuring TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, to disseminate disinformation to Americans. "When it comes to 
TikTok's algorithm and the recommendation algorithm, and the ability to conduct influence operations, that is 
extraordinarily difficult to detect and that's what makes it such a pernicious risk; Director Wray told lawmakers at 
Tuesday's hearing. The article noted that Director Wray and other US officials have argued that the Chinese 
government could pressure TikTok's owner ByteDance to effectively weaponize its algorithm to target Americans 
with disinformation. 
Hamas Likely to Pose Armed Threat to Israel 'For Years to Come' 
Times of Israel (03/12, Magid) reported that the annual U.S. intelligence threat assessment reported that Israel will 
likely face armed resistance from Hamas for years, as efforts to neutralize Hamas's tunnel network in Gaza will be 
challenging. According to the article, this comes after Hamas's attack on southern Israel on October 7, which 
escalated tensions in the region, with Iranian proxies conducting anti-US and anti-Israel attacks. U.S. Director of 
National Intelligence Avril Haines mentioned in her testimony that terror groups like al-Qaeda and the Islamic 
State, inspired by Hamas, are targeting Israelis and U.S. interests, suggesting that the Gaza conflict could have a 
generational impact on terrorism. 
Nation's Spy Chiefs Say Russia Poses National Security Threat 
Spectrum Local News (03/12, Leigh) reported that the nation's spy chiefs testified before the House Intelligence 
Committee, expressing concern that Russia's war against Ukraine could spread to other Western countries. 
According to the article, they urged Congress to pass a bill providing $60 billion in aid to Ukraine to support its 
military efforts against Russian aggression. "You can already see the Ukrainian military rationing ammunition. You 
can already see them becoming more vulnerable to Russian attacks from the air, from drones, from missiles, from 
aircraft," said CIA director William Burns. "That's the future we're going to see, I think, without providing them the
