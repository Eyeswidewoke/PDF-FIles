Received your letter, and will go through it carefully. But even on a quick reading there are things that surprise me. To 
mention just one exampl=, I would be interested in knowing where you received the information about the sale of the 
apartment in Cambridge and the purchase of the house in Tucson. 
To clarify, Deborah is not Valeria's lawyer, she's mine and Valeria=#39;s lawyer. Max recognized that he had a conflict of 
interests, and recommended to me that I should have a different lawyer, so we arranged for Deborah and her firm to 
represent both of us. 
I can see that there are many other important things to discuss and clarify=

Dear Doddoy, 
Please find attached a reply to your emails which we spoke with you about before Christmas. 
As we've said before, based on past experience we have a lot of dou=ts about how well an email exchange will work. We 
did attempt, a few months ago, to use email to address one small, concrete issue: the loan from the marital trust and its 
conditions and interest rate. We thought it would be simple to resolve our different understandings, but in the end our 
multirle communications—even including an explanatory memo from the lawyer w=o set up the loan—did not manage 
to clarify things at all. Nonetheles=, since you've asked several times for an email exchange about the broade= issues, 
we're willing to try. 
We know that what you asked for was for us to go through your detailed emails point by point and tell you what we 
disagree with and why. That isn't exactly what we've done here. Instead, this is our be=t attempt to explain the history 
and circumstances as we understand them. 
Why have we done this? For a number of reasons. We think that many of your underlying assumptions are far off from 
reality, and that your understandin= of the past, the present and what we are saying about these financial issue= is 
deeply distorted. We want to start by looking at the larger, long-term issues, where we feel you have simply rewritten 
history. 
The attached narrative is our best attempt to do this. Please keep in mind that it is based only on our memory and a 
handful of documents we've se=n through the years. The numbers in particular are all rough approximations, since of 
course we don't have access to your legal and financial fi=es. You may very well feel we're mistaken about some details. 
But in or=er to address those issues and come to an agreement on even the basic facts, we'd really like to meet face to 
face, with the help of the people who actually have the documents and the information to determine whether the things 
each of us believe are true or not. And, with a neutral mediator, who can ensure that we all are able to listen to and 
understand what the other parties are trying to say. 
Love, Avi, Diane and Harry
