Core NIM Upside in FY14, Growth 
Normalizing But Still Strong 
Re:itorote Buy. IP t St. to $52. Core EPS to $2 56:S2.70S3.15 for FYI3/14/ I 5 
We continue to view the stock as one of our top growth picks in the mid cap 
bank space. We raised our core EPS estimates by $0.03/$0.10 in FY14/FY15 to 
account for stronger earning asset growth and lower than expected expenses 
and tax rate, which more than offset a lower expected core NIM and mortgage 
banking. While FRC expects asset growth to slow to a rate more in line with 
recent levels prior to 2O13, given the lower loan pipeline heading into 4O13, 
we note this implied -20% annualized gr. rate remains strong and well above 
the industry, and should continue to be a solid driver of core NII gr. with the 
backdrop of a generally stable-to-expanding core NIM in FY14. With the 
variability of mortgage banking largely removed from core EPS trends going 
forward, we expect solid fee income growth in 4Q13/FY14 to further support 
strong core EPS trends. 
Rel-, out Sc?is First Rt,ad Alec toi qua, lac iv tiendst 
Core NIM likely to expand in FY14 with stable Interest rates. Following a 
modest decline in 4Q13 NIM, we expect 6-7 bps of core NIM expansion 
through FY14. We expect some unwind in FY14 of the •14 bps NIM impact 
from excess deposit gr. in 3O13 (following what may also be a solid deposit 
growth quarter in 4O131, as FRC funds loan gr. with cash over time, supporting 
earning asset yields. While loan production yields are below book yields, they 
are only modestly so (3.44% book yield ex. prepayment penalty income vs. a 
-3.30% loan production yield), which should mean only modest loan yield 
pressure in FY14. Given the pull-back in deposit rates at the end of 3O13, core 
deposit costs should actually decline modestly in 4013. 
Mortgage banking likely remains weak, at least near-term. FRC guided to 
continued thin gain on sale spreads and modest loan sales in 4O13, with lower 
volumes reflecting stronger demand for ARM product vs. longer-term fixed 
rate product (most of which FRC sells). We note that while shifting customer 
demand favoring resi ARMs is a negative for loan sale volume, it is a positive 
for loan growth. 
We have reduced our gain on sale income ests. to 
53.7M/$3.6M for FY14/15, levels which may prove conservative over time. 
Capital thinner, but still solid. While solid asset growth pushed the Tier 1 
leverage ratio -65 bps to 9.18%, we note this is well above FRC's 8% 
minimum, and given the expected pace of asset growth, we expect the Tier 1 
leverage ratio to remain above 9% through FY15. 
Valuation 
Our 552 target is based on a P/E of 16.5x our FY15E core EPS and a P/TBV of 
2.1x our 3Q14 TBV/share estimate, versus the current mid cap bank medians 
of 15.1x FYI4E/1.9x, respectively, reflecting a premium on a P/E basis, which 
we deem appropriate given the stronger relative core EPS growth through 
FY15, the higher quality nature of the franchise, and the potential increase in 
take-out premium over time as the bank approaches 550B in assets.

Risks 
Downside risks: (1) economic 
weakness in California. 12) lower 
longer-term interest rates 
(pressuring NIM), (3) the adoption 
of unfavorable tax policies that 
adversely impact higher net 
worth individuals (i.e. the 
lowering of the mortgage interest 
deduction threshold).
