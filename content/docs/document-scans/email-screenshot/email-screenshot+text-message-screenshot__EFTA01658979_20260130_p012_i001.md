20-year prison sentence on Friday. Enrique Marquez Jr. "supplied the weapons that Syed Rizwan 
Farook and Farook's wife, Tashfeen Malik, used on Dec. 2, 2015, to open fire on a meeting and 
holiday gathering of San Bernardino County employees who worked with Farook. Minutes later, 
a post on a Facebook page associated with Malik pledged allegiance to the leader of the Islamic 
State terror group." Farook and Malik "died later that day in a gunbattle with authorities." 
The Orange County _(CA  SI
ister (10/23, Rokos, 546K) reports, "U.S. District Court Judge 
Jesus G. Bernal said he couldn't hold Marquez legally responsible for the 14 slayings. 
Authorities have said that Marquez did not know about the plot in advance." Marquez, of 
Riverside, California, "had been convicted of conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists 
and making a false statement on federal firearms-purchase forms: Marquez said the firearms 
he was buying in 2011 and 2012 were for his use. Instead, he sold them to neighbor Syed 
Rizwan Farook as part of an aborted plan to wage attacks on motorists on the 91 Freeway and 
at Riverside City College, prosecutors said. By then, Farook had radicalized his longtime friend 
to Islam." 
The New York Times (10/23, Levenson, 18.61M) reports, "In pleading guilty, Mr. Marquez 
had acknowledged making false statements in connection with his role as a `straw buyer' of the 
rifles, federal prosecutors said." Farook and Malik "were killed in a shootout with the authorities 
hours after the massacre, which was the worst terrorist attack on American soil since Sept. 11, 
2001, federal prosecutors said." Federal prosecutors said Marquez "had admitted in a plea 
agreement and in open court that he had also plotted with Mr. Farook in 2011 and 2012 to 
attack Riverside City College and a California freeway. Those attacks were never carried out, 
but Mr. Marquez had discussed with Mr. Farook using radio-controlled improvised explosive 
devices for the attacks and bought Christmas tree light bulbs and a container of smokeless 
powder to use in the devices, federal prosecutors said." 
The Hill (10/23, 2.98M) reports that Marqez "pleaded guilty in 2017 to conspiracy to 
provide material support and resources to terrorists, and one count of making false statements 
in connection with the acquisition of firearms. `This defendant was an active member of a 
conspiracy that planned to inflict death and destruction on innocent people; First Assistant 
United States Attorney Tracy Wilkison said in a statement. 'By his own admissions, this 
defendant collaborated with and purchased weapons for a man he definitively knew held radical 
and anti-American beliefs - and who wanted to kill innocent people.'" The Wall Street Journal 
(10/23, Levy, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) also reports. 
Ninth Circuit Dismisses Key Terrorism Charge For California Man. 
The San Jose (CA) Mercury News (10/23, Gartrell, 456K) reports from San Francisco, "In a 
rebuke of a Bay Area federal judge's decision, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has struck 
down a terrorism enhancement against a man who was sentenced to 15 years in federal prison 
for opening six Twitter accounts for an undercover agent he believed was a member of ISIL." 
Amer Alhaggagi "was convicted of `attempting to provide material support' to terrorists simply 
because he agreed to open social media accounts for the purported member of the Islamic 
State, known as ISIL and ISIS." Prosecutors asked US District Judge Charles Breyer "to apply a 
so-called `terrorism enhancement' that made him eligible for up to 20 years. Breyer applied the 
enhancement and sentenced Alhaggagi to 15 years." The appeals court ruled that the 
enhancement "did not apply to Alhaggagi's case."
