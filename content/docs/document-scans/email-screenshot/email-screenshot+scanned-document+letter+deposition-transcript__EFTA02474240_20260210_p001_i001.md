Fwd: 
youve agreed that 
Y=ur office is a multi billion dollar responsibility. your children will nee= it to oversee their financial lives- I feel badly for 
you tru=y but the facts are the facts, your ceo ( Brad) has pro=ided one bad document after another for over a year, 
bad cash=flows no new IT, each time with " its gettti=g better " no-! its not. - the excuse=C240 that Brad is not the 
numbers guy, is ludicorus. of course he didnt=C2* actually prepare the statements. - no ceo would ,- but =ver and 
over he presented them to you and me , after reviewing multi=le times and multiple drafts. weeks of his hands on 
editing, misssi=g the obvious of errors . ( gaming ) inaccuracies, ( cas=flow ) and mistakes (tax returns). the simple 
reason is that at best= he is a c minus, (note. I, like you ,also give points for effort. )= ! an elegant art partnership gone 
fallow. ?WI and it= core reason to exist. not in use ? no docs for plane, still =C24> why? no docs for decantings why? 
docs for deal 1 =eceived last night " no docs for deal 2 " . why wasn=#39;t Tom brought in , after 4 times of my 
incessant remindersQ=A0 your admontion etc. the trading accounts ? the banks=presented many times simple things. 
still nothing. 
=div> 
Barry Cohen is great. you asked , - =C2f) I did my best trying to train your brad chosen . people in the=face of 
my telling you that they were never going to be more than c-minuse=, thousands of emails thousands ? 
Brad at its 
head4o=A0 . you cant as a ceo, have an accountant give you pages of n=mbers with the most important missing 
altogether and not notice, yo= and I saw the errrors right away ,as did my very junior bookeeper. = its silly. re your 
estate. Yes another Brad issue=- your will needs revision. the tenants in common structureQ=A0 I assume Alan has 
carefully walked you through. . as it is way ov=rdue needed and exciting. I won't list the more serious i=sues in an 
email but we can speak over the weekend. 
</=iv> 
How can I help? We agreed at the time when you hired =astrucci , that when you fired him, I would bear no 
responsibility b=cause it was clear that he shouldnt be hired. brad and you both sai= ," its on us", but... 
being weaned of our biz=/pay realtionship has been our mutual goal. However sinc= novemebr, you chose to do so by 
ignoring' our agree=ent re, phaidon,and your oft stated commitment to me of =arge payments for large value, ( 37 
percent was our number ). =hose to pay me a number picked by what appears to be only by w=im,- have yet to 
justify it except for telling me=that you and Brad Karp talked... 
What should we d=? the next two years in biz appears to both you and I , very =ragile.
