I suggested talking to Davis now precisely because he had an animus years a=o. 
So let your guys send you the Times review of the opera from which at that =oncert I did an excerpt. By Steve Smith. This 
is truly a hatchet job by yo=r people.

T o anyone weary of standard concert fare, the American Symphony Orchestra =rograms always look enticing. Ever since 
he became the orchestra's conduct=r and music director in 1992, Leon Botstein has been uncovering a buried r=pertory 
that our more timid musical organizations avoid, and he is not abo=e stretching a point to put his discoveries into 
provocative thematic cont=xts. 
The latest concert in Avery Fisher Hall was typical: Robert Fuchs's Symphon= No. 3, Alexander Zemlinsky's Symphonische 
Gesange, Mahler's Riic=ert Lieder, and Franz Schreker's "NachtstUck" interlude from his oper= Der Ferne Klang -- rare 
works, the Mahler songs excepted, that few audien=es can have ever heard performed live. All four composers were 
colleagues =n turn-of-the-century Vienna (a noted pedagogue, Fuchs in fact taught the =ther three), and Botstein 
brought them together in hopes that by showing u= how they dealt with 1900 fin de siècle angst, we might connect with 
=heir music and "so define our own place in history." 
That's a lot to ask from any concert, and I can't say that I came away from=this one much the wiser. Botstein, who leads 
a second life as president of=Bard College, sometimes seems to be substituting classroom ideals for musi=al reality --
especially when he puts forth extravagant claims for neglect=d minor scores that may make fascinating discussion topics 
but contain pre=ious little musical interest. The Fuchs symphony is a case in point, a pal=id imitation of Brahms, already 
ten years in his grave when this dreary ex=rcise was written in 1907; if such works are still worth hearing at all, t=ey 
should surely be sampled on reference recordings rather than in a conce=t. Zemlinsky and Schreker had more individual 
voices, and both deserve car=ful reassessment, although I wonder if they are well served by being expos=d in an 
academic context that scarcely shows them at their best. 
The performances were not very persuasive, either. Botstein shares a missio=ary's zeal for second-rate music with 
Leopold Stokowski and Sir Thomas Bee=ham, but he lacks their technical and communicative skills to make these s=ores 
sound better than they are. 
yen at that, both the ASO and its conductor do seem to be more comfortable =ith each other than when they first met 
seven years ago, and there is a re=l need for the sort of repertory freshening they so passionately believe i=. Next 
season's unusual fare looks typically tantalizing, on paper at leas=; let's hope that it translates more successfully into 
sound.
