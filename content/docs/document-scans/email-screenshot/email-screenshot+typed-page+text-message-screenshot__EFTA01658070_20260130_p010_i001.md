The agency sent this message "as the families of the dead renew calls for captors, some of 
whom are being held in the Middle East, to be put on trial in the US." A State Department 
spokesperson told the Washington Examiner, "Seeking the safe return of US citizens held 
hostage abroad and justice for the families of those murdered by their captors is a hallmark of 
this administration's policy. The Department of State's commitment to these goals is 
unwavering." Last week, the parents of ISIS victims Kayla Mueller, James Foley, Peter Kassig, 
and Steven Sotloff - all abducted and killed by members of ISIS - "penned a joint op-ed in the 
Washington Post urging the Trump Administration to take action." 
COUNTER-INTELLIGENCE 
Yates To Testify Before Senate Judiciary Committee Next Week. 
The Hill (7/27, Carney, 2.98M) reports Senate Judiciary Chairman Graham said in an interview 
with Fox News Radio Monday that former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates will testify before 
his panel on Aug, 5. Graham, who The Hill describes as "a close ally" of the President, "is

Russian election interference and the Trump campaign, and former special counsel Robert 
Mueller's probe, which followed it." 
Jarrett: Christopher Steele's Secret Source For Anti-Trump Dossier Is Finally Exposed. 
In his column on the Fox News (7/26, 27.59M) website, Gregg Jarrett writes, "When the dossier 
was invented in 2016, the president of Brookings was Strobe Talbott, a long-time friend and ally 
of Hillary Clinton. Her campaign provided the cash for the phony document that was composed 
by ex-British spy Christopher Steele. Talbott helped fuel the Trump-Russia collusion narrative. 
But it was Danchenko who supplied Steele with most of the false stories contained in the 
dossier." He contends, "I haven't seen Talbott's retraction or apology since the Mueller report 
came out, nor do I expect one. He has a lot to answer for, including his own contacts with 
Steele. It just so happens that Talbott's brother-in-law is Clinton sycophant, Cody Shearer, who 
created what became known as the 'second dossier.' Remarkably, it echoed several of the 
identical fantastic allegations as the original Steele-Danchenko dossier." He concludes, "Clinton's 
campaign didn't just commission the dossier, her allies contributed to its contents." 
Fox News (7/27, 27.59M) reports in a video that former DOJ official Francey Hakes

renewed FISA warrants against former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page." 
Carter Page Sues Yahoo, HuffPost Parent Company For "False And Defamatory" 
Articles. 
Fox News (7/27, Flood, 27.59M) reports former Trump campaign aide Carter Page "is suing 
Yahoo parent company Oath Inc. over 'false and defamatory statements,' claiming the outlet 
'portrayed him as a traitor to America' who illegally conspired with Russia to influence the 2016 
election." The suit "was filed Monday in Delaware Superior Court and accuses Oath's Yahoo 
News and HuffPost of publishing stories about Page 'with actual knowledge of falsity or with a 
reckless disregard of truth or falsity' with a motive of generating clicks online and aligning with 
the political bias and aims of senior management." The lawsuit claims, "Page is an innocent 
individual whose entire way of life was shattered as a direct result of being defamed and falsely 
branded as a traitor to his country by the Defendant's media brands. He was allegedly secretly 
plotting with Russian leaders to sabotage the 2016 Presidential Election and give 'aid and 
comfort' to Russian President Putin's efforts to 'weaken' America."
