Party," Moolenaar said in a May 29 interview with Bloomberg TV. The article highlighted that the FBI warns on its 
website that the CCP uses its post-graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in fields such as engineering, 
science, and mathematics to "operate as non-traditional collectors of intellectual property." 
Opinion: The Man Putin Couldn't Kill 
An opinion piece from the New York Times (06/02, Gessen) reported that Christo Grozev, an investigative journalist, 
has been targeted by President Vladimir Putin for his work in unmasking Russian spies and exposing their 
operations. According to the article, the plot to kill Grozev was foiled, and six Bulgarian nationals were sentenced to 
prison terms for their involvement in the plot, which was orchestrated by a fugitive financier recruited by Russian 
intelligence. Grozev's work has led to significant revelations, including identifying the secret police agents behind 
the poisoning of Russian opposition leader Aleksei Navalny, and he continues to investigate and expose Russian 
operations despite the risks to his life. The article highlighted that the FBI's foreign influence task force, which used 
to protect foreign dissidents in the United States, has been disbanded. 
Opinion: China's Courtroom Espionage Strategy Demands a Federal Response 
An opinion piece from The Hill (06/02, Tiahrt) reported that China's state-owned enterprise, Pangang Group, 
admitted to state-sponsored industrial espionage in a U.S. court, highlighting the country's role in using commercial 
enterprises for geopolitical gain. According to the article, third-party litigation funding, which allows outside 
financiers to fund lawsuits in exchange for a cut of potential winnings, poses a national security risk as it can be 
used by foreign entities to drain resources from U.S. companies and gain access to proprietary information. The 
article noted that proposed federal laws, such as the Protecting Our Courts from Foreign Manipulation Act and the 
Litigation Funding Transparency Act, introduced by Rep. Ben Cline and Rep. Darrell Issa, respectively, aim to address 
this issue by requiring transparency and prohibiting foreign governments from investing in third-party litigation 
funding. The article highlighted that the FBI has called China's economic espionage the "greatest long-term threat 
to our nation's information and intellectual property, and to our economic vitality?' The author stated that "we lack 
even the most basic safeguards to ensure that our courtrooms aren't being used as intelligence-gathering venues 
for hostile foreign powers. That is unacceptable."

Law Enforcement Looking Into Instagram Posts Linked to Louisiana Escapee 
WWL (CBS-4) (06/02, Staff Writer) reported that eighteen days after one of the largest jail escapes in New Orleans 
history, authorities are still searching for two men, and the cost of that manhunt continues to climb. According to 
the article, of the 10 inmates who escaped from the Orleans Justice Center in the early hours of May 16, eight have

was in the past is not who I am today," while denying allegations that he threatened a maintenance worker with a 
weapon and called the jail system "corrupted" and referencing both OJC and St. Tammany Parish jails. He also
