hear. The knotty question is whether that sensory data actually comes from a real physical external world as it appears 
to do, or whether the source of that data is within us as per the Hindu tradition. My vote is for the latter. 
Kind regards

That Dawkins does not understand consciousness comes as no surprise. 
Any conversation with Hammeroff is, a priori, non-informative. Consciousness obeys the laws of chaos (randomness 
does no occur in nature), as do quantum fields, but consciousness has nothing to do with the perturbation of quantum 
fields in any part of the nervous system. It was a nice try, but a silly one. 
Consciousness has no contents. It is about something (intensionality) but it has no contents, nothing that can be 
observed, measured, recorded or analysed. Therefore, there is no "granularity" of consciousness: qualia do not exist. 
The hard problem is an illusion. Mysterianism is not so much a lack of knowledge as it is a lack of imagination and 
insight. As Adam Zeman put it: If your theory admits to the existence of zombies, your theory needs fixed. You have to 
say that with a Scottish accent. 
Consciousness (the feeling of what happens, the remembered present) is the experience of perceptual contents. Do not 
mistake this definition with "the contents of perceptual experience". They sound alike, but the word order changes the 
meaning completely. Perceptual contents are the neural representation of stimuli, internal or external. Neural 
representations can be observed (if one's instruments are good enough), measured, recorded and analysed. The 
experience of the representation cannot, it is subjective, entirely subjective. Experience has no contents. Spirituality is 
a state of experience but it is not the "contents" of experience. (Which is one reason why the DL has declared that if 
neuroscience disproves his beliefs, he will search for new beliefs, brave fellow.) 
Consciousness is the synchronous oscillation of massively interconnected, multidimensional, recursive circuits, networks 
and systems throughout the global workspace. What enters awareness probably oscillates at about 40 hz. Oscillation 
at partial and harmonic frequencies probably effect how the perceptual apparatus represents transduced stimuli, how 
other perceptual contents enter consciousness and awareness and how contents are retained to enter awareness later, 
when the stimulus is remote. The theory has no empirical support, though parts of it have been validated. It's not new, 
and certainly not with me. Theorists and investigators I like include Crick and Koch, Rudolfo Llinas, Wolf Singer, Henry 
Markram and many others. Certainly not Chalmers, Jackson, Nagel, McGinn, Hammeroff and Penrose, etc. 
Sorry, I warn most people that they shouldn't "get me started". 
I promise I'll send no more.
