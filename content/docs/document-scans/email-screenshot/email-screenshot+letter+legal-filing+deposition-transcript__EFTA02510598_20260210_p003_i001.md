Jon: 
The earlier model your note below is older and will sell for less. I und=rstand that it is now under contract to sell for 
$23M M. That said, we wou=d be willing to increase the offer for 30751 to $28MM 
Please advise

Richard, 
Thank you for reaching back out to me. I have been away on travels but have=been meaning to get back in touch with 
you but didn't want to call this la=e on a Friday evening so please excuse the lengthy email. We've done sever=l analyses 
for the seller to help them understand where the market lies in=relation to current data points (both sold aircraft and 
what is currently =vailable). I am in agreement to some extent that your valuation of SN 3075= below $30,000,000 based 
on recent sales is not unreasonable. From the sel=er's standpoint, they are trying to recoup some of their investment in 
the=interior and at the same time looking at what they are competing against. =everal months ago they were indeed 
competing against Mr. Wynn's aircraft b=t now that it has sold they don't see any BBJ that competes with them (at =east 
not below $30,000,000). 
The aircraft you have referenced does compete to some extent with 30751 in =hat it is a similar vintage and we are well 
aware of 29273 and have seen i= in person. It has been for sale since late 2009 and has seen numerous pri=e reductions 
from it's original $49,000,000 ask price in 2009 to it's curr=nt ask price of under $26,000,000. You are correct that it has 
less total =ime but the layout and interior are the main obstacle that have kept it fr=m selling. The floorplan is very poor 
and estimates to reconfigure it, whi=h would require removal of multiple bulkheads and other dividing structure= have 
been estimated anywhere from $3,000,000 to well over $6,000,000 by r=putable BBJ completion centers such as 
Jetbasel and Lufthansa Technik. We'=e had several buyers that were clients of Avjet who were interested in the=aircraft 
a few years ago with a configuration change but ended up passing =ecause of the time and cost involved. Even without a 
configuration change,=the interior decor is less than stellar, some have referenced that it loo=s like something out of an 
18th century castle with it's inlaid wooden pan=ling and bookcases. 
I know it's splitting hairs but one must also consider that 29273 was one o= the first BBJ's built. It's was YGO6 (Boeing 
line designation) compared t= ours which was YG62. The bottom line is that we understand your position =hat the 
interiors are a mute point if you are going to redo them either wi=h new cosmetics or actual structural design changes 
such as removing bulkh=ads, chairs, tables and such. 
In that regard your principle is somewhat unique in this segment (early mod=l) of the market. Of the past seven early 
model BBJ trades (2009 - to pres=nt) only two have redone softgoods (leather, carpet, etc) and/or woodwork.=The 
remaining five buyers operated their new BBJ's as is with regards to t=e interior save for some entertainment work.
