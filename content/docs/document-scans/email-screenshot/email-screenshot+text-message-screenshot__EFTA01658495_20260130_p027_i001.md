FBI Helping Train Australian Police Officers To Catch Foreign Spies. 
The Brisbane (AUS) Times (9/30, 730K) reports, "The FBI has been training Australian Federal 
Police officers in how to catch foreign spies as a specialist unit set up to counter foreign 
interference and espionage becomes due for expansion." The Times adds, "AFP Commissioner 
Reece Kershaw revealed he had asked FBI director Chris Wray for help in training officers in the 
new unit, which has 65 officers. AFP Commissioner Reece Kershaw says he expects the AFP to 
be finding its own foreign interference cases." According to the Times, Kershaw "said foreign 
interference and espionage was a new challenge for the AFP after laws were passed in 2018 to 
crack down on covert influence. 'I reached out to Director Wray, the FBI director, asked him for 
assistance... around training our people and looking at how we could deliver our own package 
perhaps modelled on the US,' Mr Kershaw said."

Trump's Debate Comment On Proud Boys Draws Criticism From Republicans And 
Others. 
President Trump's call for the Proud Boys organization to "stand back and stand by" during 
Tuesday night's first presidential debate is one of the major threads of coverage of the debate, 
with political figures of both parties criticizing what analyses call a refusal to condemn white 
supremacy. The AP (9/30, Ronayne, Kunzelman) reports the President "didn't condemn white 
supremacist groups and their role in violence in some American cities this summer" during the 
debate, "branding it solely a 'left-wing' problem and telling one far-right extremist group to 
'stand back and stand by:" Reuters (9/30) reports that on Wednesday, Trump said the Proud 
Boys, "an organization identified as a hate group, should 'stand down' and let law enforcement 
take the lead." Trump told reporters, "I don't know who the Proud Boys are. They have to stand 
down. Let law enforcement do their work." 
Norah O'Donnell said on the CBS Evening NewsVi (9/30, story 3, 2:10, 3.95M) that Trump 
"is being rebuked by members of his own party for failing to explicitly condemn white 
supremacy and groups that support it." CBS' Jeff Pegues: "Shortly after the President declined 
to denounce them, the Proud Boys were online celebrating and claiming victory. On Telegram, a 
group leader wrote, 'Standing down and standing by, sir.' Also, a new logo with the President's 
words appeared." On NBC Nightly NewsVi (9/30, story 3, 2:40, Holt, 5.69M), Hallie Jackson 
said, "That phrase 'stand back and stand by' [is) now a rallying cry, and new logo for the Proud 
Boys, a self-described pro-Western chauvinist fraternity of men, classified as a hate group by 
the Southern Poverty Law Center and tied to several violent incidents at recent protests." The 
Wall Street Journal (9/30, Levy, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) quotes American University's 
Kurt Braddock, who studies extremist groups, saying, "It suggests that should he need them, 
he will call on them. It's that kind of language that can be interpreted as a call to action by 
some people looking for an excuse to engage in violence."
