FBI Releases Photos of Person of Interest in Charlie Kirk's Killing on a Utah University Campus 
The Associated Press (09/11, Tucker, Richer, et al.) and Reuters (09/11, Hay, Brooks) reported that the shooter who assassinated conservative 
activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University remains at large more than 24 hours after the attack, as authorities released security images, video 
footage, and details about physical evidence in hopes the public could help identify the suspect. According to the articles, Director Patel and Utah 
Governor Spencer Cox revealed that the killer fired a single shot from a rooftop before fleeing into nearby woods, leaving behind a high-powered 
Mouser .30-caliber bolt-action rifle, a palm print, a shoe impression, and other forensic evidence that is now being analyzed at a federal lab. The 
articles said law enforcement has received more than 7,000 tips and conducted over 200 interviews while offering a $100,000 reward for 
information leading to the suspect's capture, with Cox stressing, "We cannot do our job without the public's help right now." Officials noted that 
Kirk, a prominent ally of President Donald Trump and co-founder of Turning Point USA, was answering a question about mass shootings when the 
sniper struck, killing him in front of 3,000 attendees. "I can tell you this was a targeted event" said Robert Bohls, the top FBI agent in Salt Lake 
City. The articles noted that Trump ordered flags lowered to half-staff, announced Kirk would posthumously receive the Presidential Medal of 
Freedom, and said the attack marked part of the most sustained wave of political violence in the United States since the 1970s. Additional
