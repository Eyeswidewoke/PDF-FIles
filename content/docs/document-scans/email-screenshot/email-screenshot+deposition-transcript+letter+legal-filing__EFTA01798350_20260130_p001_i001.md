The mood among the inner circle is intense anxiety. They are all hoping the goofy way the London Film Critics gave TSN 
best film...etc and TKS best British film is not yet another crumb Scott can use against them as many ballots still are out. 
They are not assuming anything about the Baftas. TKS is a runaway smash hit in England. They nervously hope for a 
sweep of 14 wins and feel anything less is a potential problem of front runner fatigue. 
The biggest problem is the political rebels in Egypt are thanking Facebook for bringing them all together to fight 
oppression. This is bigger than the TIME cover for Zuckerberg. 
The timing is very bad for this chilling realization that what started out as a dating lark at Harvard has grown global to 
topple governments. If I were Scott, I would take full page ads in every paper in America and proclaim Facebook is the 
new "right is might" against injustice not one heroic king against the Nazi's. 
Harvey wanted me to stay in New York and make phone calls to every old person I court. This race is a fight to Feb. 22 at 
S:00pm and the longer the ballots stay out the more vulnerable TKS is. 
I got off the plane with two stuffed ears. They remained blocked for hours. I just woke up and they are less blocked but 
I still have slight inner ear aches and a sore throat. I may go to a doctor this morning because I am concerned about 
flying home. Never a dull moment. Also thinking about my sick mother and feel so sad for her. 
Glad I came for networking. Spent time with Cohn Firth and all the European distributors that go to Cannes. Went to a 
lame small party for The Fighter that was 100 people crowded into an upstairs room in a hotel with adorable Amy 
Adams standing around with Jim Sheridan (has a hot new film for Universal with Daniel Craig and Rachel Weiss...and yes 
he saw the whole affair on his set), Terry Gilliam and distributors. The same guys have TKS and Fighter in Europe and 
they brought HW in. 
Then went to Eric Felner/Working Title/Vogue dinner party and was seated next to Nick Jones, owner of Soho House and 
right in back of Cohn, Elizabeth Murdoch...yes I got her and Colin nuts with the Logue/Keith Murdoch letters sitting in 
102 Dame Elizabeth's attic in a shoebox....and they roared when I told them I put Mark Logue onto Wendi! 
Eric Feltner was telling me he was pissed at Harvey for jumping on his date (creating competing dinners) that he has had 
for years...but he understood I had to leave at 10:30pm because I was getting emails from Victoria...to get over there. 
Eric made me introduce him to Lucy Walker (who I asked to bring) and he is now taking her to lunch to talk about work. 
As chic as the Vogue party was (and I met one if Annabel Astor's daughters) once again Harvey's party was so much 
better with more film people, actors, a better mix, better room, better slightly brighter lighting, more table hoping and 
energy. Leave it to HW to put a party together in a week that was better than the one organized in the beginning of 
January. 
(But you know I am always less impressed with well dressed fashion people than articulate show biz.) 
I am going to the Momentum Distributing lunch for their Bafta nominees at noon...then resting...maybe Asprey cocktails 
but I know any party in a store is bad and Charles Finch's famous dinner. (He was at Eric's.)
