allegations were made "in written testimony of a former employee of the Spanish security firm 
at a hearing where Assange is fighting attempts to have him extradited to the US." The 
activities were carried out "at the behest of `American friends,' the employee of UC Global, 
whose identity wasn't released by the London court, said in a legal filing Wednesday." Assange's 
attorney, Mark Summers, said in a separate filing the agency was "acting on the instructions of 
US intelligence." 
The Guardian (VS> (9/30, Quinn, 4.19M) reports "plans to poison or kidnap" Assange 
"were discussed between sources in US intelligence and a private security firm that spied 
extensively on the WikiLeaks co-founder, a court has been told." James Lewis, "acting for the 
US government, told the court on Tuesday that the US case was likely to be that the evidence" 
of the former UC Global employees was "wholly irrelevant." 
Statements Claim Assange Bugged In Ecuadorian Embassy. The AP (9/30, Pylas) 
reports Julian Assange's conversations "in the latter part of his 7-year stay at the Ecuadorian 
Embassy in London were systematically bugged, even in the toilet, a London court heard 
Wednesday." In written statements "at Assange's extradition hearing, two anonymous witnesses 
who worked for a Spanish firm with a security contract at the embassy said the WikiLeaks 
founder faced an intensifying bugging operation from 2017 onwards after Donald Trump 
became US president." Judge Vanessa Baraitser on Tuesday "granted the two witnesses 
anonymity amid fears for their safety." Lawyers acting on "behalf of the US government did not 
contest the submission of the anonymous statements but said they were largely irrelevant to 
the matter under consideration in London's Old Bailey court." 
Snowden Ordered By Judge To "Surrender Book Profits" To US. 
Bloomberg (9/30, 4.73M) reports a US District Judge Liam O'Grady in Virginia on Tuesday 
ordered Edward Snowden to "relinquish $4.2 million in profits from his tell-all memoir about his 
work in U.S. intelligence because he did not submit the manuscript for government review 
before publishing." Snowden also must "give up profits stemming from paid speeches that he 
gave without authorization, and sacrifice potential future profits from the distribution or 
adaptation of his 2019 memoir." The government had "argued that Snowden was required to 
submit the manuscript for his book for review under secrecy agreements he signed with the 
National Security Agency and the Central Intelligence Agency." In his order, O'Grady "agreed 
with that assessment," writing that Snowden "breached his contractual and fiduciary obligations 
to the CIA and the NSA by publishing Permanent Record and giving prepared remarks within 
the scope of his prepublication review obligations." 
Stars And Stripes (9/30, Yaffe-Bellany, 30K) and The Washington Times (9/30, Blake, 
492K) also report. 
Pentagon Collaborating With Armed Services On JEDI Cloud Transition. 
C4ISR & Networks (9/30, Eversden) reports the Pentagon's top IT official "said Wednesday that 
his office has spent the last few months preparing the armed services to migrate to the 
department's long-delayed enterprise cloud as soon as it becomes available." During a Defense 
Writers Group roundtable, Pentagio CIO Dana Deasy said, "We're doing a lot of work with the 
services on getting them prepared to move their [software] development processes and cycles 
to DevOps so when the [Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure] cloud finally does get awarded, 
we're not starting at Day One." The JEDI cloud is an "important piece of the Joint All-Domain 
Command and Control concept, an initiative through which the services want to connect 
sensors and shooters." Cloud, data and artificial intelligence "are core elements to enabling 
JADC2." Using data for "joint war fighting is the top priority of the department's forthcoming 
data strategy, which Deasy said he expects will be released in the next 30 days."
