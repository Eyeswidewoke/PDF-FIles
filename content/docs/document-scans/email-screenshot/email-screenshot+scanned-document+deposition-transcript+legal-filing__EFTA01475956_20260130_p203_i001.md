World Outlook 2016: Managing with less liquidity 
Global Asset Allocation: The case for normalization 
Key themes and catalysts for 2016: 
After a record rise in the dollar, 2015 saw unusually negative US data 
surprises 
that were second only to 2008. Five and a half of the first six months saw a 
prolonged and sustained period of negative surprises as the lagged impacts of 
the record rise in the dollar combined with a second severe winter and port 
strikes. Following a brief period of positive surprises, the August equity 
market 
correction saw sentiment indicators fall sharply and another two months of 
negative surprises ensued. Macro data surprises were worse only in 2008. 
2016 should see normal data surprise cycles, with a warmer winter an upside 
risk. The sharpest nine-month rise in the dollar against the major currencies 
was responsible directly for the sharp move down in manufacturing and 
indirectly through the collapse in oil prices on energy-related capex. The 
divergence between manufacturing and resilient services has been closely tied 
to the pace of dollar appreciation and should begin to anniversary out with 
the 
former catching back up to the much larger latter sector. 
Underlying (private) US growth has been much stronger than headline GDP 
growth rates and it has been resilient. Headline GDP growth in the US (2.0%) 
has been lowered by the shrinking government sector. With the peak in fiscal 
drag passed, we expect headline growth to lift towards private GDP growth 
(3.0%) if not higher given expenditure multipliers. The US recovery has also 
been resilient in the face of a variety of large shocks in recent years 
with, for 
example, the labor market remaining in its 2.4% ar recovery channel. 
Financial repression is reducing growth: rate normalization to raise incomes 
and 
lower the savings rate. The traditional view that low rates represent 
stimulus 
focuses on the cost of household (HH) liabilities, but the asset side is much 
bigger (Are Low Rates Raising The Savings Rate?, Oct 2015). Of $100 trn of HH 
assets, cash alone is $10 trn and lower rates mean lower interest income of 
$360 
bn (2% of GDP) before multipliers. Lowering the return on savings also 
raises the 
savings rate (1 pp of GDP). Corporate cash holdings are 3x short-term debt so 
earnings should also rise with rates, especially for the Financials. 
EM growth re-normalization is advanced: the question is whether it will be a 
soft or hard landing. The multi-year outperformance of EM during 2001-2010 
represented a confluence of four circumstantial factors: slack following late 
1990s crises; dollar down cycle encouraged capital inflows and credit boom; 
dollar down cycle meant oil and commodity up cycle; interaction meant 
appreciating exchange rates, which checked inflation and lengthened the 
cycle; each factor went into reverse in 2010-2011 and looks to have a little 
further to run. Our baseline view has been that the EM growth spread or 
advantage will revert to its historical range, and we are almost there (When 
Will EM Stop De-rating?, Oct 2013). While EM growth has been slowing since
