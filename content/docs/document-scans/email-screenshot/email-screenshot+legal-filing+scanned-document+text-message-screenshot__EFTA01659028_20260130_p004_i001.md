Intelligence Officials Warn Of Russian And Iranian Interference In US Election. 
All three broadcast news networks covered what David Muir of ABC World News TonightVi 
(10/22, story 3, 2:35, 6.71M) called a "new warning about election interference. US authorities 
say Russia and Iran have obtained voter registration information, and that Iran has used that 
information to send threatening messages to voters." ABC's Pierre Thomas reported on the 
"new details about alleged covert efforts by Russia and Iran to weaponize illegally obtained 
information about American voters." FBI Director Wray: "We are not going to tolerate any 
criminal activity that threatens the sanctity of your vote." Thomas: "Two of America's primary 
adversaries successfully penetrated voter registration databases at the local level along with 
gleaning voter data from publicly available sources." DNI Ratcliffe: "We have already seen Iran 
sending spoofed emails designed to intimidate voters, incite social unrest." Pete Williams 
reported on NBC Nightly NewsVi (10/22, story 3, 1:55, Holt, 5.51M), "Voters in Florida and a 
few other states began receiving emails this week appearing to come from the Proud Boys 
known to support President Trump, especially after he fleetingly referred to them in the first 
presidential debate." Ratcliffe: "We have already seen Iran sending spoofed emails designed to 
intimidate voters, incite social unrest, and damage President Trump." 
National Security Advisor O'Brien said on Fox News' The Story (10/22), "The Iranians are 
the most recent to have engaged in this activity that was exposed by Director Wray and 
Director Ratcliffe and I commend our intelligence services for uncovering it quickly. We think 
transparency is the best deterrent for this sort of activity in the future. The Iranians understand 
that we are very unhappy with this and there will be consequences as a result of it." O'Brien 
added, "We are confident in what we can do to protect the American people and protect our 
elections." 
Asked on WIND-AMVi Chicago (10/22, 8K) about the remarks by Ratcliffe and Wray, 
White House Senior Communications Advisor Ben Williamson said. "We're on top of this. This is 
an Administration that has spent and invested millions, if not billions, of dollars in election 
security, making sure our systems are secure, making sure we're holding foreign actors 
accountable for any evidence we see of foreign interference." 
NBC News (10/22, Dilanian, 6.14M) reports that a pair of US intelligence officials told 
them that the Administration "has known for weeks that Iran and Russia had successfully 
hacked local governments and obtained voter registration and other personal data." The officials 
"said Iran's intent wasn't entirely clear, but that one goal is sowing chaos and undermining 
confidence in the election. Both officials said it would hurt the Trump campaign if a white 
nationalist group was exposed as having sought to bully Democrats." 
Meanwhile, CBS News (10/22, Quinn, 3.68M) reports that officials in the three states 
targeted by Iran - Florida, Alaska, and Arizona - "say their voter databases have not been 
compromised." The Miami Herald (10/22, Gross, Ceballos) reports that after the FBI accused 
Iran of ending the emails, they "appeared to have come to a halt." However, "two Florida 
members of Congress are now requesting an FBI briefing for the Florida delegation and at least 
seven local election officials say they have not been given any information from authorities on 
the scope of the issue other than what has been publicly reported."
