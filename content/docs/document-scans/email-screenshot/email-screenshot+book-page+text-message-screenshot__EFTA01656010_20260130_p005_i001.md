Animal Agriculture Alliance. The article stated that animal rights activists, such as those from Direct Action 
Everywhere, have been targeted and labeled as "animal rights violent extremists" by the industry and law 
enforcement, with some facing serious charges and prison time, like Zoe Rosenberg, who is accused of being a 
"biosecurity risk" for participating in an "open rescue" of chickens. The article highlighted that in a statement, the 
FBI defended its relationship with members of the private sector. "Our goal is to protect our communities from 
unlawful activity while at the same time upholding the Constitution," the agency said in an unsigned statement. 
"The FBI focuses on individuals who commit or intend to commit violence and activity that constitutes a federal 
crime or poses a threat to national security. The FBI can never open an investigation based solely on First 
Amendment-protected activity."

Continued Reporting: FBI Flaws in Whitmer Kidnapping Case Gain Renewed Spotlight Amid Pardon 
Speculation 
The Washington Examiner (06/02, Deese) reported that President Trump is considering pardons for men convicted 
of plotting to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, citing potential flaws in the case. According to the article, 
the convictions of Barry Croft Jr. and Adam Fox are under scrutiny, with defense attorneys arguing they were 
manipulated by an FBI sting operation. The article noted that the case's integrity is being questioned, with 
journalist Julie Kelly meeting with pardon attorney Ed Martin to review alleged flaws in the FBI's handling of the 
case. "The number of FBI informants that were embedded in this operation, the undercover agents, what they did 
when they were introduced to the operation, how they targeted these men, how they organized various events —
so they got them stoned and drunk and then recorded them to use as evidence later," Kelly told the Washington 
Examiner. "Just the level of granular involvement by the informants and agents, but also how so much of it was 
dictated from higher-ups, including the handling agents out of the Detroit FBI field office." The article highlighted 
that the FBI's counterterrorism strategy came under fire during the prosecution of men accused of plotting to 
kidnap Whitmer, with critics alleging that the bureau's use of informants veered into outright entrapment.

COUNTERINTELLIGENCE 
Lawmaker Says CCP to Blame for U.S. Decision to Revoke Student Visas 
NTD (06/02, Yang) reported that Rep. John Moolenaar, Chair of the House Select Committee on the Chinese 
Communist Party, blames the CCP for the U.S. decision to revoke student visas for international students from 
China. Moolenaar accuses the Chinese communist regime of manipulating and pressuring overseas students into 
participating in espionage against the U.S. "I think it's a huge problem when you have a foreign government who is 
influencing students on another country, its property, and making them do the bidding of the Chinese Communist 
Party," Moolenaar said in a May 29 interview with Bloomberg TV. The article highlighted that the FBI warns on its 
website that the CCP uses its post-graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in fields such as engineering, 
science, and mathematics to "operate as non-traditional collectors of intellectual property." 
Opinion: The Man Putin Couldn't Kill 
An opinion piece from the New York Times (06/02, Gessen) reported that Christo Grozev, an investigative journalist, 
has been targeted by President Vladimir Putin for his work in unmasking Russian spies and exposing their 
operations. According to the article, the plot to kill Grozev was foiled, and six Bulgarian nationals were sentenced 
to prison terms for their involvement in the plot, which was orchestrated by a fugitive financier recruited by 
Russian intelligence. Grozev's work has led to significant revelations, including identifying the secret police agents 
behind the poisoning of Russian opposition leader Aleksei Navalny, and he continues to investigate and expose 
Russian operations despite the risks to his life. The article highlighted that the FBI's foreign influence task force, 
which used to protect foreign dissidents in the United States, has been disbanded.
