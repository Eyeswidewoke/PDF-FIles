Fwd: leon DO NOT SEND, hand deliver. 
Transaction complete ! 
=C2 When we had our meeting in your home in Bedford. You asked for my help. I told you multiple times that i 
t=ought it a bad idea, i preferred to have no financial interaction.=C2 I dont have many friends and didnt want mo=ey 
to interefer with ours. For five years y=u had only Eileen Alexandersson managing your accounting , le=al, investments. 
reporting, trusts etc. When I told you in no =ncertain terms that i thought she was incompetent you admonished me 
=or " speaking out of both sides of my mouth " . With=regard Brad, there i no " both sides. ". I have maintained=since 
day one that he was unsuited for the job. When you asked me to=help convince him to take the role , promising him a 
postion =o manage investments I sent you a note saying pay up and get first c=ass people. I have reieterated the same 
message for ov=r a year now.. Brad , not me was tasked with hiring new people =AO and you wanted him to take 
ownership of the staff, in may you to=d him in my presence that he had had six months and had not hired anyone.=C2 
I have rectified errors in sales tax, use tax, income ta., fbar reporting, 1031 reporting, 8 million of deductions. , 1= 
million found in dormant accounts and 4 million in the drawer. erro=s in cash flow both personal and Phaidon. 
Oversight on new grats =AO first at 22 and then at 19 that were done without my consulatation was =esolved. 600 
million in after tax savings was just accomplished. 
With Brad out of the office and u=able to run his usual interference , the level of his utter =AO incompetence was 
brought clearly, front and center. He may=be a step up from Eileen, but if he is, then it is certai=ly not by much, A 
magjor difference is Eileen kne= she was over her head. 
=AO Though=/span> you and I have spent many many hours discussing the importance</=pan> of details and 
mechanics. with regard Phaidon =AO I was not shown one document , not one.!! Brad wanted to ke=p it private 
between he and his so called " advisorsaspan> " however as he was out of the office during the mo=t important 
transaction of the year, I did get to spend time =ith Joe and john, - the situation in your of=ice is totally ludicrous - to 
summarize - the lis= I provided to Brad last December - of things = thought were a priority to get done - still 
rema=ns in the whole unresolved. 
THE IT, is still desperate=y needed- reporting flawed cumbersome and inaccurate . all done by h=nd as one -off 
exercises , - airplane: re structure, (my o=ly suggested priority in june ) is really ,no further ahe=d„consultants up the 
kazoo but nothing at all done.( the office was told=C2 by Brad not to share the outsie proposals with me =C2 - brad has 
no idea even as to what questions to ask. he knows little=of finance, is bullshitted over by almost everyone in the office. 
he=is a little man , using your power, to appear larger . Eileen was self awa=e enough to know she was over her head , 
that is a huge difference. =C2 bad info is rampant a simple emblematic example- =3 million in deductions Im told wer 
ta=en for art space but on closer examination it turns out they c=nnot be used at all. ( ZERO benefit ► though you will 
be told yes th=y were deducted on the return they said that is the question you wer= focused on ! " were they 
deducted " not -&quo=; is there a benefit " !! 
I asked for the balance =heet and P and L for Regan arts , a basic first
