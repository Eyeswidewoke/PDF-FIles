DB COD Commodities Note - 17 Dec 
Another violent day in oil today. NY wa=ked in with the market down 3% as APIs yesterday afternoon were bearish (note 
however there was an adjustment to APIs base so actually stats seemed more bearish than they were). However, we 
rallied back slowly as news of further CAPEX cuts in Canada hit the market, and we started seeing back end buying (cal 
16 and z19 were bought in the AM). Stats came out bearish, yet the market rallied and a massive stop out started. At 
some point, WTI was up 8.8% from its lows, yet it held 59$, and then started coming off. Post Yellen, the selloff 
continued as she was interpreted as Hawkish and the USD caught a large bid, bringing WTI back down to unchanged 
levels on the day. There was not much news out there. Angola raised its Feb loadings to 1.86M in a preliminary 
schedule. Also, Trafigura booked a VLCC to head east to South Korea on January 5; the last such shipment east was in 
Novemb=r. However, sources are saying that it is going to be put in storage that Trafi just bought there. However, along 
w a bid N Sea window, BRE spreads rallied. Gasoline was weak versus BRE again as the stats showed a sizeable build. 
Disty on the other hand in the US was bid as we got an unexpected draw as well as due to NG also heading higher due to 
Weather forecasts for end of December. 
OIL VOLS 
Similarly violent day in vol market as well. WTI and BRE vols opened the day stronger by a vol in the front, but flattish in 
the back. Both vols held their gain till DOE stats, but prompt sold off after the squeeze higher in flatprice and rallied back 
after the retracement. Around midday the vol curve was more or less unch. However, 30min before the close backend 
vols started getting bought aggressively and at one point Dec15 vols were up more than Mar15 vols were.. This ended 
up lifting the whole vol curve up by a vol into the settlement. There was some chatter about producer activity in 
backend causing the vol rally, but backend futures were bid which doesn't tie out well with producer hedging.. 
With 10% intraday ranges in price, and vols trading 50, it's hard to take a view and stick to it.. but I do =hink prompt vols 
are too rich compared to mid/back. For example CLM5 had only a slightly smaller intraday range today compared to 
CLI15 (8.1% vs 7.5%), but it is trading at over 6 vols discount..a gamma neutral straddle spread can be a good trade idea 
here to monetize the discount..
