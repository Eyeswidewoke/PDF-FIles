Data Breach At A Genealogy Site Has Privacy Experts Worried. 
The New York Times (8/1, Murphy, 18.61M) reported GEDmatch, a longstanding family history 
site "containing around 1.4 million people's genetic information, had experienced a data 
breach." Brett Williams, the chief executive of Verogen, a forensic company that has owned 
GEDmatch since December, "said that the peculiar matches were not new uploads but rather 
the result of two back-to-back hacks, which overrode existing user settings." Scientists and 
genealogists "say the GEDmatch breach - which exposed more than a million additional profiles 
to law enforcement officials - offers an important window into what can go wrong when those 
responsible for storing genetic information fail to take necessary precautions." For many, the 
presence of "fake users in GEDmatch was as alarming as the breach itself." Genealogists know 
that a "user can easily upload someone else's genetic profile." But the breach "exposed that 
behind the scenes, hidden by privacy settings, were all kinds of profiles of people who were not 
even real." 
CISA Hosts Table-Top Training Exercise To Aid In Protecting Elections. 
MerlTalk (7/31, Weingarten) reported the Federal agency primarily responsible "for protecting 
elections held a training event to test its plans in advance of November's Election Day." The 
third 'Tabletop the Vote' exercise "hosted by DHS' Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security 
Agency (CISA), took place over a three day period from July 28 to 30, featuring 37 states and 
over 2,000 total participants, the majority of which participated remotely." CISA Director Chris 
Krebs, along with Federal, state, and local election officials, said in a statement, "In less than 
three months, millions of Americans will cast their vote. But for the state and local officials who 
administer elections, and the government and private sector partners who support them, the 
work has been ongoing for more than three years. We have made significant progress during 
that time, and this week's Tabletop the Vote exercise demonstrates the unprecedented levels of 
coordination between all levels of government and the private sector." 
Travel Giant CWT Pays $4.5M Ransom To Cyber Criminals. 
Reuters (7/31, Stubbs) reported that, according to a record of the ransom negotiations seen by 
Reuters, US travel management firm CWT "paid $4.5 million this week to hackers who stole 
reams of sensitive corporate files and said they had knocked 30,000 computers offline." The 
attackers used "a strain of ransomware called Ragnar Locker, which encrypts computer files and 
renders them unusable until the victim pays for access to be restored." The ensuing 
negotiations "between the hackers and a CWT representative remained publicly accessible in an 
online chat group, providing a rare insight into the fraught relationship between cyber criminals 
and their corporate victims." CWT "confirmed the attack but declined to comment on the details 
of what it said was an ongoing investigation." It said in a statement, "We can confirm that after 
temporarily shutting down our systems as a precautionary measure, our systems are back 
online and the incident has now ceased." 
Several Solarium Commission Recommendations Successfully Included In House 
Defense Authorization Bill. 
Federal Computer Week (7/31, Johnson, 263K) reported the Cyberspace Solarium Commission 
has "successfully lobbied the House to include nearly two dozen of its recommendations in the 
latest defense authorization bill." They're now working "to convince the Senate to adopt ideas 
like a new White House Cyber Director while also pushing the federal government and its allies 
to produce quicker attribution and joint sanctions for malicious cyberattacks." During a House 
Armed Services Subcommittee on Intelligence and Emerging Threats hearing, ranking member 
Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY) "said at least 22 of the more than 50 legislative proposals from the 
report were included in the final version of the National Defense Authorization Act passed by 
the House." Those provisions must still "survive a conference with the Senate and a potential
