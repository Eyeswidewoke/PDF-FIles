The Los Angeles Times (12/7, 4.64M) reports hospitals in the state are "contending with 
an unprecedented wave of more than 10,000 COVID-19 patients, and the state is on the brink 
of recording its 20,000th death from the illness." The San Francisco Chronicle (12/7, 2.67M) 
reports Newsom announced Monday that intensive care availability at hospitals across the state 
"has dropped to 14%," with 2,360 patients in intensive care. 
Meanwhile, Reuters (12/7, Dave) reports California on Monday "announced an app to help 
people track their exposure to the coronavirus, becoming the biggest U.S. state to take 
advantage of new technology from smartphone software makers Apple Inc and Alphabet Inc's 
Google." Reuters says the CA Notify App, which goes live on Thursday, "had been tested on 
state university campuses since September. The University of California San Diego will continue 
to oversee the system and staff a user support phone hotline." 
New York Orders Hospitals To Expand Capacity, May Slash Indoor Dining. 
The AP (12/7, Villeneuve) reports New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) on Monday ordered 
hospitals "to add 25% more beds to handle growing numbers of coronavirus patients, 
and...Cuomo warned he would curtail indoor dining if hospitalizations keep rising." The governor 
"said that the state isn't yet at a 'critical' level of COVID-19 hospitalizations, but that the 
continued growth is worrying." Cuomo also "said he'll shut down schools, nonessential 
businesses and all restaurant table service in regions that are on track to hit 90% of hospital 
capacity within three weeks, based on a seven-day average." 
CNBC (12/7, Feuer, 3.62M) reports on its website that Cuomo "said...the state could close 
indoor dining in New York City and slash capacity elsewhere across the state if current 
hospitalization trends continue." Reuters (12/7, Whitcomb, Caspani) also reports Cuomo 
"floated the possibility of a broad shut down of non-essential businesses across the state like 
one imposed in the spring if its hospitals become overwhelmed, though he said the current 
situation was not dire enough to warrant such a step." According to Politico (12/7, Eisenberg, 
4.29M), "The new plan is based on hospitalization rates rather than infection rates and will take 
a regional approach to reducing Covid-19 cases. The aim is to avoid mass hospitalizations such 
as what the city saw this past spring, when it was the national epicenter of the pandemic, 
health care systems were overwhelmed and field hospitals popped up across the five boroughs." 
The New York Daily News (12/7, Goldiner, 2.52M) reports that during a news briefing with 
NIAID Director Fauci, Cuomo "warned that the state has no choice but to reimpose harsh 
restrictions as health systems are near capacity with COVID-19 rates relentlessly rising." 
However, the New York Times (12/7, Gold, 18.61M) reports restaurant owners "are warning 
that the industry, which employs thousands of low-income workers and is vital to the city's 
culture, risks even further collapse without some form of aid." 
New York City To Reopen Some Public Schools. The New York Times (12/7, 
Goodman, 18.61M) reports, "On Monday, New York City will reopen some of its public schools in 
the teeth of a worsening coronavirus outbreak." The decision "reflects changing public health 
thinking around the importance of keeping schools operating, particularly for young students, 
and the real-world experience of over two months of in-person classes in the city's school 
system, the nation's largest." However, "the whiplash many New York City students, parents 
and teachers felt - from a full shutdown before Thanksgiving to a partial reopening less than 
three weeks later - is not likely to abate as the fall turns to winter." 
On ABC World News TonightVi (12/7, story 5, 1:35, Muir, 7.46M), Rachel Scott reported 
"some" classrooms in the city are "open again under new guidelines, including random COVID 
testing every week." On the CBS Evening NewsVi (12/7, story 7, 1:50, O'Donnell, 4.74M), 
Janet Shamlian said the schools are reopening amid "a troubling trend. Remote learners 
struggling across the country." Shamlian added, "The educational slide experts say impacting 
minority, low income, and rural children profoundly. Widening gaps that existed before the 
pandemic."
