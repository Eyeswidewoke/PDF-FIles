which she said will provide temporary, immediate relief as federal benefits are set to expire at 
the end of the month." 
Lawmakers To Vote On Short-Term Spending Bill As Dual Negotiations Continue. 
CNBC (12/7, Pramuk, 3.62M) reports on its website that Congress "aims to extend government 
funding for an additional week while lawmakers try to scrape together spending and 
coronavirus relief packages." The AP (12/7) says with the one-week stopgap measure, 
lawmakers "are giving themselves more time to sort through their end-of-session business on 
government spending and COVID-19 relief." Reuters (12/7) reports House Majority Leader 
Hoyer tweeted, "I am disappointed that we have not yet reached agreement on government 
funding. The House will vote on Wednesday on a one-week CR to keep government open while 
negotiations continue." 
USA Today (12/7, Wu, Hayes, 10.31M) reports Senate Majority Leader McConnell said 
Monday that his chamber will also vote on the one-week extension this week. USA Today also 
describes what would occur if lawmakers fail to reach agreement and the government shuts 
down. 
The Washington Post (12/7, DeBonis, Stein, Kim, 14.2M) says "negotiations over the 
government funding bill have stalled with lawmakers torn on at least a dozen policy issues, 
particularly related to immigration." The "most divisive issues...concern funding for President 
Trump's border wall with Mexico and detention facilities" run by Immigration and Customs 
Enforcement. The Hill (12/7, Marcos, 2.98M) provides similar coverage. 
Axios Report: Trump Discussing Pardons "Like Christmas Gifts." 
Axios (12/7, Swan, 521K) reports, "President Trump isn't just accepting pardon requests but 
blindly discussing them 'like Christmas gifts' to people who haven't even asked, sources with 
direct knowledge of the conversations told Axios." Trump "recently told one adviser he was 
going to pardon 'every person who ever talked to me,' suggesting an even larger pardon blitz to 
come. As with most Trump conversations, the adviser wasn't sure how seriously to take the 
president - although Trump gave no indication he was joking." 
AP Examines Question Of Presidential Self-Pardon. The AP (12/7, Tucker) carries a 
feature titled "Does Trump Have Power To Pardon Himself? It's Complicated." The AP says "no 
president has attempted to pardon himself while in office, so if Trump tries to do so in the next 
six weeks, he will be venturing into legally untested territory without clear guidance from the 
Constitution or from judges." Legal experts "are divided on an inherently ambiguous question 
that was left vague by the Founding Fathers and has never had to be definitively resolved in 
court." Some say the "broad power the Constitution affords a president" regarding pardons 
would permit such a move, while others "say a self-pardon collides with other provisions of the 
Constitution or even fundamental principles of law." 
DHS Says It Has Fully Restored DACA For Now. 
The AP (12/7, Merchant, Spagat) reports DHS said Monday that it has fully restored the 
Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, "complying with a federal judge's order." DHS 
"posted on its website that it is accepting new applications, petitions for two-year renewals and 
requests for permission to temporarily leave" the US. However, the department "said it 'may 
seek relief from the order,' signaling that its concession to the court order may be short-lived if 
its legal efforts succeed." 
TPS Extended For Nine Months. 
The Miami Herald (12/7, Charles, 1.09M) reports DHS has extended Temporary Protected 
Status benefits, "which were set to expire early next month for an estimated 400,000 
immigrants from Haiti, Nepal and Central America," for nine months. The extension "means that 
the TPS beneficiaries, including nationals of Sudan as well as Honduras, Nicaragua and El
