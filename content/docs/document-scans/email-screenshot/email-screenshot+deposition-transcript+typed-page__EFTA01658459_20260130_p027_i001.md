Muir, 7.2M), "I think as a default position, we should try to the best of our ability to get the 
children back to school for the reasons that we're familiar with about the negative 
consequences, psychologically and otherwise on kids, as well as the spin-off type of 
downstream ripple effects on families about getting kids back to work. Having said that as a 
default principle, which we should try to do, there's a however there. ... We've always got to 
make a primary consideration the health, the safety and the welfare of the children and of the 
teachers." Asked if all students should be wearing masks, Fauci said, "There should be universal 
wearing of masks. There should be to the extent possible social distancing. Avoiding crowds. 
Outdoors always better than indoors and being in a situation where you continually have the 
capability of washing your hands and cleaning up with sanitizers."

Vi (8/10, story 9, 1:27, Dahlgren, 6.1M) reported that Duke Health "set out to find which

across the country as they try to balance changing government directives, concerns about the 
impact on local economies, the possibility of lost learning and the potential for loss of lives. NBC
