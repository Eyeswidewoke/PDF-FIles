The limits of monetary policy 
4. Policy challenges ahead 
Eurozone: 
Following the latest meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB, the ECB 
announced on March 10th that it would reduce its deposit rate (on money 
deposited by Eurozone banks by 10 bps to minus 0.4%. Its other key rates were cut 
by 5 bps, with ono on the main refinancing operations (MRO) now at 0% and on 
marginal lending facility at 0.25%.
As many market participants had hoped, it also expanded GE, increasing the 
monthly purchases under the asset purchase program by €20bn to €80bn starting 
in April. More significantly, the scope of assets eligible to be included in the list 
of assets for regular purchases will include investment grade euro-denominated 
bonds issued by non-bank corporations from now on. 
In our view, this will somewhat alleviate one of the issues the ECB has faced, 
namely the growing scarcity of government bonds of some countries, such as 
Germany. It comes at the risk, amongst other issues, of losses on these private 
sector bonds and will no doubt prove controversial. However, the alternatives would 
probably have been even less palatable. 
In order to increase the OE program without including new sots of assets, the ECB 
could instead have changed its capital key, allowing it to purchase more bonds front 
more highly indebted countries such as Italy. Or it could have given up the deposit 
rate as a hurdle rate when it buys government bonds. However, this would have 
effectively resulted in an arbitrage opportunity for banks, with the ECB locking in 
losses with each purchase of bonds from the banking sector (which could then 
deposit the proceeds at a less negative rate with the ECB. 
Finally, the ECB announced a new series of targeted longer-term refinancing 
operations (TLTRO). These are designed to stimulate lending to the real economy. 
by allowing banks to borrow on attractive terms from the ECB. These will now be 
very attractive indeed - from now on, borrowing conditions in these operations can 
be as low as the interest rate on the deposit facility, or minus 0.4%. This will depend, 
however, on the banks actually lending. The more banks lend, the closer the rate 
will fall to the deposit rate. 
In our view, the package illustrates the growing ECB concerns about the potential 
impact on bank profitability from exits in its deposit rate. This impact will be 
alleviated somewhat by the benefits bank will get from TLTRO II. Nevertheless, we 
would expect minus 0 5% to be the lower limit of how much further the ECB will cut 
the deposit rate, which will probably be reached at the next meeting. 
All of which sounds quite impressive. However, stocks eroded their gains within 
hours, and the euro reversed its initial weakening, after Mario Draghi indicated 
during the press conference that he expected no further cuts. In the following 
trading days, equities strengthened again, as investors took a closer look at the 
package. The volatile market reaction showed three things. First, the ECB still has 
some options to move markets. Second, it now takes a very comprehensive set of
