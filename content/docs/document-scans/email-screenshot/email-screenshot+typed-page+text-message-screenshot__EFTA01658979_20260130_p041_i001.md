NYTimes Al: Trump's Financial Records "Cast Doubt" On Philanthropic Claims. 
In a front-page article titled "Trump's Philanthropy: Big Tax Write-Offs And Claims That Don't 
Always Add Up," the New York Times (10/23, Al, Craig, Buettner, McIntire, 18.61M) reports 
that while the President describes himself as "a committed philanthropist with strong ties to 
many charities" and according to his tax records, "has given back at least $130 million since 
2005, his second year as a reality TV star," his "long-hidden tax records, obtained by The New 
York Times, show that Mr. Trump did not have to reach into his wallet for most of that giving. 
The vast bulk of his charitable tax deductions, $119.3 million worth, came from simply agreeing 
not to develop land - in several cases, after he had shelved development plans." The Times 
adds the records "show that much of his charity has come when he was under duress - facing 
damage to his reputation or big tax bills in years of high income." 
WPost Analysis: Trump Has To Pay Off $400M In Loans By 2024. 
The Washington Post (10/23, Fahrenthold, O'Connell, Partlow, 14.2M) reports that "in the next 
four years," President Trump "faces payment deadlines for more than $400 million in loans -
just as the pandemic robs his businesses of customers and income, according to a Washington 
Post analysis of Trump's finances." The Post adds, "The bills coming due include loans on his 
Chicago hotel, his D.C. hotel and his Doral resort, all hit by a double whammy: Trump's political 
career slowed their business, then the pandemic ground it down much further." The Post goes 
on to report that "if Trump is reelected, these loan-saddled properties could present a 
significant conflict of interest: The president will owe enormous sums to banks that his 
government regulates." 
INTERNATIONAL NEWS 
European Countries Impose New Restrictions Amid Second Wave Of COVID Cases. 
The Wall Street Journal (10/25, Al, Walker, Bisserbe, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) reports 
Italy, Spain, France, and other European countries are responding to an increase in coronavirus 
cases by enacting new restrictions. 
The AP (10/25) reports the Spanish government on Sunday "declared a national state of 
emergency that includes an overnight curfew in hopes of not repeating the near collapse of the 
country's hospitals." Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez "said the decision to restrict free movement 
on the streets of Spain between 11 p.m.-6 a.m. allows exceptions for commuting to work, 
buying medicine, and caring for elderly and young family members." Reuters (10/25, Carrefio, 
Jones) reports the new rules "go into force from Sunday night and will require all regions 
except the Canary Islands to impose a nighttime curfew and limit the number of people allowed 
to meet to six." 
The New York Times (10/25, Kwai, 18.61M) reports Spain in March had "invoked 
emergency powers to enact one of the world's strictest lockdowns," which "was lifted in June, 
but as cases spiked after the country reopened over the summer, officials reinstated a partial 
lockdown in swaths of the country, including the capital of Madrid." According to the Times, 
Spain was "the first Western European country to surpass one million cases this week, though 
Mr. Sanchez has said the number of cases may be as high as three million people." 
Meanwhile, the AP (10/25, D'Emilio) reports Italian Premier Giuseppe Conte "imposed at 
least a month of new restrictions across the country Sunday to fight rising coronavirus 
infections, shutting down gyms, pools and movie theaters, putting an early curfew on cafes and 
restaurants and mandating that people keep wearing masks outdoors." The New York Times 
(10/25, Pianigiani, 18.61M) reports Italy "was the first Western country to go on a general 
lockdown last March," but the government "introduced the new restrictions starting on Monday 
with the hope of avoiding a second lockdown that would severely damage the country's 
economy."
