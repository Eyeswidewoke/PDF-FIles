CNN (11/11, Cohen, Mascarenhas, 83.16M) says on its website that Moderna "expects to 
have an announcement on the vaccine's efficacy by the end of the month, the company said in 
a statement Wednesday." Both Moderna and Pfizer "use messenger RNA for their vaccines," and 
NIAID Director Fauci "has said Pfizer's promising outcomes are good news for Moderna, too." 
Politico (11/11, Brennan, 4.29M) reports Fauci "told a Financial Times conference on 
Wednesday that the Moderna data would be coming in the 'next few days to a week' and that 
he would 'be surprised if we didn't see a similar degree of efficacy' as the results from Pfizer." 
Vaccine Expected To Boost Economy, But Not Immediately. The Wall Street 
Journal (11/11, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) says that although a successful COVID vaccine 
could boost the global economy, it will be some time for the world to heal from a drop in 
businesses, jobs, and investments. Lockdown measures are expected to come back as the virus 
surges, and industries affected by the pandemic will continue to face months of low demand. 
Azar Says Pfizer Vaccine Would Be "One Of The Most Effective" In Public Health. 
HHS Secretary Azar said on Mornings On The Mall (11/11), "This Pfizer vaccine, which was 
tested in 44,000 people, one of the largest clinical trials in history for a vaccine, yielded what 
appeared to be over 90% efficacy. This would be, if this pans out, this would be one of the most 
effective vaccines in the world of public health. ... It's really a historic moment, and this was 
ten months, ten months after this virus hit our shores, thanks to President Trump's leadership 
and the Operation Warp Speed effort that I put together with the Defense Department." 
Surgeon General Adams said on WLUK-TVVI Green Bay, WI (11/11, 3K), "We're going to 
start by focusing on the vulnerable, people who are older and our frontline workers: our 
doctors, our nurses, our police officers, our firefighters. But we expect to be giving vaccinations 
to the general public by early next year." 
Trump Lashes Out Against "Medical Deep State" After Pfizer's Vaccine 
Announcement. The Washington Post (11/11, McGinley, Dawsey, Abutaleb, Johnson, 14.2M) 
reports President Trump "is lashing out at the Food and Drug Administration following a 
disclosure Monday that an experimental coronavirus vaccine from pharmaceutical giant Pfizer is 
more than 90 percent effective, convinced the timing — six days after Election Day - proves the 
'medical deep state' deliberately tried to sabotage his electoral prospects by delaying the 
results." Trump "demanded [Azar] 'get to the bottom' of what happened with Pfizer, according 
to a senior White House official who spoke on the condition of anonymity." According to the 
Post, "Trump's anger at the FDA raises fresh questions about whether" FDA Commissioner Hahn 
"will hang on to his job until Jan. 20 - when Trump leaves office - in an administration intent on 
purging officials deemed insufficiently loyal." 
FDA Grants Emergency Approval To Eli Lilly Antibody Treatment. 
On NBC Nightly NewsVI (11/11, story 3, 1:45, Holt, 5.8M), Tom Costello reported, "Receiving 
emergency FDA approval, Eli Lilly's new IV antibody treatment is similar to what President 
Trump received last month. Meant for patients in the first ten days of mild symptoms to keep 
them from getting worse and ending up in a hospital. The treatment is free, but must be 
delivered in a clinical setting, not over the counter." Eli Lilly "says shipping 88,000 doses now, 
another 800,000 in December, but that may not be enough with more than 100,000 new COVID 
cases each day from big cities to rural America." 
COVID Cases Rise In Every State As New Daily Infections Hit New Record. 
NBC Nightly NewsVi (11/11, lead story, 2:20, Holt, 5.8M) reported that the COVID pandemic 
"is overtaking us in levels frankly not seen since the start of this nightmare. The prediction that 
the nation would see another spike in hospitalizations and deaths is now evident inside ICUs 
and county morgues." NBC's Miguel Almaguer said, "After our nation added a staggering one 
million infections in the first 10 days of November alone, by Christmas, 20 million Americans 
could contract COVID. Medical centers, testing sites, and morgues are already at a breaking 
point."
