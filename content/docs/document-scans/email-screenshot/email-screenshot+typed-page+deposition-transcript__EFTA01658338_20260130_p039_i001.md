Former Iranian President Reached Out To Saudi Crown Prince. 
The New York Times (7/28, Fassihi, 18.61M) reported that former Iranian president Mahmoud 
Ahmadinejad, known for denying that Holocaust and calling for the elimination of Israel, wrote 
"written a chummy letter to his country's most ardent Arab foe": Saudi Crown Prince 
Mohammed bin Salman. The letter, which is "filled with flattery and praise" and casts the crown 
prince as a man of peace, "flout[s] Iran's stated policy toward Saudi Arabia." In it, Ahmadinejad 
calls for working to end the Yemen war. Diplomats and analysts "said it was highly unlikely" the 
move would result in further engagement, and "some saw it as a bid for relevance by Mr. 
Ahmadinejad." Meanwhile, a spokesman for Iran's mission to the United Nations "sought to play 
down Mr. Ahmadinejad's attempts at independent diplomacy." 
Iran Moves Imprisoned British-Australian Woman To "Notorious" Prison. 
Fox News (7/28, Sorace, 27.59M) reports on its website that officials say that Iran moved Kylie 
Moore-Gilbert, a lecturer in Islamic studies at Melbourne University, "to Qarchak prison, the 
country's notorious desert jail, officials said Tuesday." In 2018 Iran sentenced the British-
Australian academic to 10 years on espionage charges. 
Taliban Declares Temporary Cease-Fire To Mark Eid Al-Adha. 
The Washington Post (7/28, George, Constable, 14.2M) reports that the Taliban announced a 
temporary cease-fire Tuesday to mark the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha. The Afghan 
government "welcomed the move" and "ordered Afghan government forces to respect the 
truce." The cease-fire comes amid growing pressure "to bring the militants and the Afghan 
government together for direct peace talks now months overdue," and as "violence across the 
country remains high, despite the signing of a peace deal between the Taliban and the United 
States in February." 
US, Australia Vow To Pursue United Front Against China. 
The AP (7/28, Lee) reports the US and Australia are "teaming up in their criticism of China, 
taking the country to task for aggressive behavior throughout the Asia-Pacific and not acting 
quickly to contain the coronavirus." The US and Australian foreign and defense ministers 
"pledged Tuesday to renew and strengthen a united front against China and what they termed 
Beijing's malign behavior throughout the region and beyond that they said had grown worse in 
recent years." The two sides also "accused China of violating international norms in the South 
China Sea and vowed to uphold freedom of navigation and the rule of the law as well as 
democratic freedoms in Hong Kong." 
Report: US To Order Drastic Reduction In Chinese Diplomats. The Washington
Times (7/28, Gertz, 492K) reports exclusively that the Administration is "preparing to order 
China to sharply reduce the number of diplomats posted in the United States to levels equal to 
the number of American diplomats stationed in China, senior State Department officials said." 
The official said the move "seeks in part to reduce the burden on FBI counterintelligence 
agents, who in recent months have devoted 2,000 special agents to catching Chinese spies and 
their agents." 
Harvard Professor Hit With Additional Charges In Spying Case. The Washington
Times (7/28, Mordock, 492K) reports that "federal charges continue to mount against the 
former chairman of Harvard University's chemistry department who was indicted earlier this 
year for allegedly lying to investigators about his ties to a controversial Chinese talent 
recruitment program." The Justice Department on Tuesday filed its third indictment against 
Charles Lieber, this time alleging he failed to report foreign bank accounts with the IRS.
