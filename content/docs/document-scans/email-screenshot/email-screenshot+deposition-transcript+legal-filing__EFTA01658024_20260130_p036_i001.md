now acknowledge that no one has been ticketed." The Times also reports that a Boston Police 
Department spokesman "stressed that it was not enforcing mask rules because Massachusetts 
has no law requiring masks, which is true. He did not respond when asked about the order the 
governor issued in May that provided for a $300 fine for not wearing masks in stores, on mass 
transit and in taxis." 
Union Leader: Retail Workers Being Unjustly Burdened With Having To Enforce 
Mask Policies. The Washington Post (7/30, Bellware, 14.2M) reports "the head of the largest 
union representing retail workers said businesses have unfairly burdened their employees with 
enforcing mask-wearing policies, to the detriment of workers and customers alike." It's on 
employers "to provide a safe workplace, said Stuart Appelbaum, president of the Retail, 
Wholesale and Department Store Union, who called for companies to hire security staffers to 
enforce a store's mask policies or task members of management with the role." On Thursday, 
Appelbaum told the Post, "Employees should not be expected to put their safety and their life 
on the line for the employer. That's an unreasonable expectation." 
CDC: 260 Children, Staff At Georgia Sleep-Away Camp Infected With Coronavirus. 
The Washington Post (7/31, Janes, 14.2M) says that "a new report suggests that children of all 
ages are susceptible to coronavirus infection and may also spread it to others." The report, 
which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention put out on Friday, "details an outbreak at 
a sleep-away camp in Georgia last month in which 260 children and staffers - more than three-
quarters of the 344 tested - contracted the virus less than a week after spending time together 
in close quarters." The median age of the children was 12. Moreover, all campers and staff 
members had been required "to provide documentation that they had tested negative for the 
virus before coming." The Post adds, "Staff were required to wear masks, but children were 
not." 
ABC World News TonightVi (7/31, story 7, 0:27, Oquendo, 6.66M) and the CBS Evening 
NewsVi (7/31, story 4, 0:33, Begnaud, 3.97M) provided similar coverage in brief broadcasts. 
Supreme Court Signals Disinterest In Ruling On Virus-Related Election Matters. 
The Wall Street Journal (8/1, Bravin, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) reports that in multiple 
cases since April, the Supreme Court has rejected lower court orders to expand voting access 
during the coronavirus pandemic. 
Hogan Faces Backlash Over Effort To Expand Voting Access In Maryland. The 
Washington Post (7/31, Cox, 14.2M) said that when Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) last week 
"announced an all-of-the-above strategy to conduct 'a normal' election in November, he cast it 
as a decision to maximize voter access during the coronavirus pandemic," but "a massive 
backlash ensued." The Post described the reaction as "another example of the deadly pandemic 
weaving uncertainty though the presidential election process. As President Trump faces 
bipartisan rebuke for suggesting the election be delayed and undermining mail-in voting, Hogan 
is under withering criticism - and facing open revolt - from rank-and-file poll workers in his 
state." 
Politico Analysis: Push To Reopen Schools Is Latest Example Of Trump Reversing 
Course. 
Politico (8/2, Kumar, 4.29M) reports in an analysis that throughout the coronavirus pandemic, 
President Trump "has fought everyone else as he pushed his own contentious plans...before 
later reversing course, backing away from his initial stance or simply moving on to the next 
issue and declaring victory." Supporters and critics "say Trump wants to appear as if he is 
taking charge - even when he clearly lacks the authority to act - as he scrambles to find 
anything to latch onto while facing sinking poll numbers months before the election." Politico 
says the latest example came amid his push to reopen schools. Trump "threatened to withhold
