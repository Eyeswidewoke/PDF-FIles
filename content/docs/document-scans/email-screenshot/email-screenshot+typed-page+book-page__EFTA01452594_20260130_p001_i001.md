Strong performer but solid earnings 
peaking out soon; initiate at Hold 
Initiating coverage of APO with a Hold Rating and $31 PT 
We see APO units trading in a range near current levels over the next 12 
months for the following reasons: 1) we see APO as more advanced in its fund 
realization cycle than peers, a condition likely to continue into 2014, causing 
distributable earnings (DE) to peak in 2013 or 2014 at the latest, 2) despite a 
very successful capital raise for Fund VIII at $18bn, DE in 2015-16 is likely to 
remain well below 2013-14 levels as Fund VIII remains in a capital deployment 
mode through 2016, and distributions from other large funds will likely have 
waned, and 3) APO's risk profile is above average with more concentrated 
positions, and this could restrain APO's PE expansion in 2014 if the market 
becomes choppier vs. 2013. Positively, mgmt is extremely innovative and 
several growth initiatives may help buffer the valley in the PE cycle, the 
strongest being the Athene/Aviva acquisition, which will enable APO to further 
leverage its credit expertise & grow fee earnings. However, we don't think 
these efforts will fully offset the DE compression post realization cycle. 
Ea, nings outlook 
We believe DE, from which cash distributions are paid to unit holders, is the 
most important earnings metric to value the Alts, rather than economic net 
income (ENI) that forms Consensus estimates. We forecast APO's DE per unit 
to drop from $3.82 in 2013 to $3.22 in 2014E and $2.70 in 2015E. Key drivers 
are: 1) exhausting harvested gains over the next several quarters, 2) Fund VIII 
being in investment mode, partially offset by 3) contribution from Aviva. 
Valuation & Risk 
With positive revaluation for the Alts, we still think APO will expand its P/E 
from 10.6x 2014E ENI to over 11-12x 2015E DE 12 months from now, 
narrowing its discount to the S&P 500 P/E from -40% to -30%. This drives a 
$31 PT, which implies a total return of 6% over the next 12 months, inclusive 
of a 9.5% forecast distribution yield for 2014. Downside risks for APO are: 1) a 
slowdown in US/global economy, 2) a prolonged equity market correction, 3) 
an inability to generate strong growth organically and/or from Aviva in 2014 
that would further reduce DE in '15. 4) an inability to deploy capital in Fund 
VIII at a reasonable pace & 5) failure to improve PIE vs. traditional asset 
managers and the market broadly. Upside risks are: 1) stronger investment 
returns than expected that drive much higher DE than forecast, and 2) much 
stronger organic growth at Aviva than forecast.
