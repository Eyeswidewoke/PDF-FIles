IN THE NEWS 
Justice Dept. Investigating Former New York Gov. Cuomo Over Pandemic Testimony 
The New York Times (05/20, Barrett) reported that the U.S. Justice Department has opened a criminal investigation 
into Andrew Cuomo, a leading candidate in the New York City mayoral race, over allegations that he lied to 
Congress about his decisions during the coronavirus pandemic. According to the article, the investigation, begun by 
the US attorney's office in Washington, was sparked by a referral from House Republicans and focuses on Cuomo's 
testimony about his role in a New York State Health Department report on nursing home deaths. The article noted 
that the inquiry has raised concerns that the Justice Department is being used as a political tool, with critics 
arguing that the Trump administration is targeting Cuomo, a potential rival to current Mayor Eric Adams, who had 
corruption charges against him dismissed in February. A spokesman for the Justice Department and a 
spokeswoman for the FBI declined to comment, citing a general policy of not confirming or denying 
investigations. Additional reporting on the story was provided by Axios (05/20, Falconer), Bloomberg (05/20,

U.S. Congresswoman Charged With Assault Outside Immigration Center 
Reuters (05/20, Goudsward) reported that the U.S. Justice Department has charged Democratic Congresswoman 
LaMonica McIver with assault and impeding law enforcement over a scuffle at an immigration detention center. 
According to the article, Mclver's lawyer claims the charges are politically motivated and that immigration agents 
mishandled the confrontation. The article noted that the case has raised concerns about the Justice Department's 
readiness to act against President Donald Trump's political rivals, with some arguing that the department is using 
its power to target Democrats. Additional reporting on the story was provided by ABC News (05/20, Barr), Al

Arrested New Orleans Jail Worker Says He Helped Inmates Escape After Stabbing Threat 
The Associated Press (05/20, Brook, Cline) reported that a New Orleans jail maintenance worker, Sterling Williams, 
has been arrested for helping 10 inmates escape by turning off the water to a toilet that covered a hole in a cell 
wall. Williams claimed he was threatened with a stabbing by one of the inmates, Antoine Massey, if he didn't assist 
in the escape. According to the article, five of the escapees, including Corey Boyd, have been recaptured, but five 
others, including Massey, remain at large, prompting a large-scale search effort by law enforcement. Fox News 
(05/20, D'Abrosca) added that a former FBI agent, Scott Duffey, believes a massive 10-person jail break in New 
Orleans is "impossible" without staff involvement. Duffey, who spent 10 years hunting fugitives, says at least 
double the number of escapees must have known about the planned escape, indicating a significant intel breach. 
The article explained that authorities are investigating whether the inmates had help from jail staff, with three 
employees already suspended, and Duffey suggests that a romantic relationship between a corrections officer and 
an inmate could be a plausible motive for assistance. Additional reporting on the story was provided by ABC News
