Re: 
Jef=rey, Thank you! 
I wasn't ignoring your last requ=st. I was pulling what info I could together. Will report back. It'= become complicated. 
Easier conversation. But to summarize a few of your qu=stions below. 
1. Agreed. The comps in our bu=lding are $3500/sq ft. For 2 and 5 floor apt with no outdoor space. If you t=ke ours 2400 
inside 1800 outside and use 50% for outdoor it's rough=y valued at 11.550m with 6m of debt. Being a unique space 
done so wel= I think you could get more. Spoke to a few brokers that agree but at the a=d of the day the market speaks. 
If EL IPO / CPH income isn't what l=expect this year I would either sell or rent it. I love the place but not g=ing to put us 
in a bad place again over this apartment. 
2. There are other significant assets. This is what I was referr=ng to as us sitting down to look at the whole picture. 
1.2cash, 1.6M in equ=ties, 2.7m in hedge funds, lm in Covis ,lm in commerical rent generating re=l estate in NC, 1.7m in 
multifamily that pays quarterly dividends, a basket=of other assets and investments. These are rough numbers off top of 
my head=during break in meetings. I can get more detailed when not on my phone. Bee= in meetings all morning in FLL 
since 745. Establishment Labs is probably t=e biggest single investment and doing the best. The "they" i= better in 
conversation. Not simple answer. I'll get you the detail= you asked when I get back. Think of it roughly like this. I paid 
3.75/shar=. The current round is closing at 16/share and IPO roughly 18.50. Can sell i= we want 6month later. I haven't 
tried to sell my shares but if I w=nted to I could have sold to Perceptive Advisors at that price in last roun=. 
3. Yes it will to finish. I have this mode=ed out and can get you exact numbers when back to office. It will take abou= 
75% of the remaining cash from refinancing. 
4. Co=pletely agree. This is my biggest weakness in business and it's the=most important. I will get on this ASAP. 
5. I have=spent a lot of time in factory and with management team and employees. It410=804,s a good management 
team. Prior to investment and after. Also at trade=shows with doctors and KOL's. The top KOL's has left Allerg=n and 
Mentor to EL. Also visited London Hospital Group that has most experi=nce with EL. I have spent time with Jeffries team 
as well many times. Micharl Robinson Managing Director of Healthcare Investment Banking and Benjamin L=rello Global 
Head of Investmwnt Banking are running point on IPO. They were=the ones that set the expected valuation and time 
table. Shooting for June r=ght now. 
All the best,
