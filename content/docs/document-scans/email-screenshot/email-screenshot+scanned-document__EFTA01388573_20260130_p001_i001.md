The limits of monetary policy 
Nrx:m Edi,:n I Msch::)Ef; 
And, we are hardly alone in this assessment. As Stephen Williamson, Vice President 
at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, noted in a recent review, taking a broader 
historic perspective: 
"The theory behind QE is not well-developed .. Evidence in support of Bernanke's 
view of the channels through which OE works is at best mixed... Much of 
the work on the quantitative effects of QE consists of event studies, whereby 
researchers look for effects on asset prices close to the date of an announced 
QE intervention. 
All of this research is problematic, as it is atheoretical. There 
is no way, for example, to determine whether asset prices move in response to a 
OE announcement simply because of a signaling effect, whereby OE matters not 
because of the direct effects of the asset swaps, but because it provides information 
about future central bank actions with respect to the policy interest rate. Further 
there is no work, to my knowledge, that establishes a link from OE to the ultimate 
goals of the Fed -inflation and real economic activity."'' 
Given such doubt, it is no wonder that the Fed is hoping for a return of more normal 
times - when it could count on well-understood tools to do the job. 
3. Consequences for investors 
In 1976, the economist Robert Barro argued that an activist monetary policy gains 
much of its effectiveness from confusing people, clouding signals to market 
participants. That can secure tranquility for a while and perhaps provide a temporary 
boost to output. However, that stability comes at the cost of even greater variance 
later on" Eventually, you might expect inflation, GDP and also financial markets to 
become more volatile. 
Given how much OE appears to have relied on market expectations, it is hard to say 
if such a tipping point has already been reached. Over the past year, the investment 
environment has clearly been getting trickier. In the past, correlations across 
different asset classes were generally such that you could reap decent returns 
without taking too much risk, using diversification effects to mitigate the downside 
risks. Now things are different. 
This is especially true if we compare the period between 2010 and 2015 with the 
recent market turmoil. Lately, many unusual correlations have cropped up that you 
might not have expected. For example, major equity indices have tended to move 
in sync with the oil price. This might seem justifiab€e for the S&P 500 Index, but is 
less understandable for the German Dax, which does not include a single major 
oil producer. In any case, correlations between oil and the S&P 500 Index have 
historically tended to be negative, which also makes more economic sense. 
Worse still, many old correlations have been swept aside. Volatility is increasing.
