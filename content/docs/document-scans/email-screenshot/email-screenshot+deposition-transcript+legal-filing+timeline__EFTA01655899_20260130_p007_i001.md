CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS 
Former Colorado Clerk Tina Peters, One-Time Hero to Election Deniers, Convicted in Computer Breach 
The Associated Press (08/12, Slevin) reported that former Colorado clerk Tina Peters, the first local election official 
to be charged with a security breach after the 2020 election as unfounded conspiracy theories swirled, was found 
guilty by a jury on most charges Monday. Peters, a one-time hero to election deniers, was accused of using 
someone else's security badge to give an expert affiliated with My Pillow chief executive Mike Lindell access to the 
Mesa County election system and deceiving other officials about that person's identity. The article stated 
that Lindell is a prominent promoter of false claims that voting machines were manipulated to steal 
the election from Donald Trump. His online broadcasting site has been showing a livestream of Peters' trial and 
sending out daily email updates, sometimes asking for prayers for Peters and including statements from her. 
Prosecutors said Peters was seeking fame and became "fixated" on voting problems after becoming involved with 
those who had questioned the accuracy of the 2020 presidential election results. The article noted that the breach 
Peters was charged of orchestrating heightened concerns over potential insider threats, in which rogue election 
workers sympathetic to partisan lies could use their access and knowledge to launch an attack from within. The 
Washington Post (08/12, Sanchez, Marley), Huffington Post (08/12, Shuham), CPR News (08/12, Birkeland, Hesse), 
the Hill (08/12, Robertson), Axios (08/12, Frank), Colorado Sun (08/12, Lofholm), and CBS News (08/12, Erblat) also 
reported on the story. 
Hunter Biden's Attorneys Dispute Prosecutors' Accusations of Influence-Peddling Scheme with Romanian 
Client 
The National Review (08/12, Lynch) reported that Hunter Biden's legal team is disputing the DOJ's recent 
description of an influence-peddling scheme involving a Romanian businessman and millions worth of payments. 
The article stated that the younger Biden's attorneys filed court papers Sunday to support their motion to remove 
allegations of political corruption and influence from his upcoming tax trial — allegations federal prosecutors 
believe are relevant because they expect one of his former business partners to testify that Romanian oligarch 
Gabriel Popoviciu paid Biden and his associates to lobby the U.S. government on his behalf. The article 
quoted Biden's attorneys, who said, "While going through the motions of filing Business Associate l's grand jury 
transcript under seal in support of its response to the Motion, the government included an inflammatory and 
incomplete, and therefore misleading, characterization of that testimony in a public filing, surely knowing it would 
make news." The article added that federal prosecutors said they were expecting one of Biden's business partners 
to testify about a business agreement designed to conceal the true nature of the work for Popoviciu, namely 
lobbying the U.S. government to influence the Romanian investigation into his suspected corruption. The business 
partner appears to be Rob Walker, whose holding company received roughly $3 million from Popoviciu from 
November 2015 to May 2017, according to bank records House Republicans released last year. All but one of the 
payments took place when Hunter's father, Joe Biden, was vice president during the Obama administration. The 
payments to Walker were mentioned in the sweeping indictment against Biden last year containing the nine federal 
tax charges he will stand trial for in September. He has pleaded not guilty to all the charges. ABC News (08/12, 
Bruggeman), and the New York Post (08/12, Christenson) also reported on the story. 
Ex-Law Enforcement and Former Military Officers Charged in Alleged Sham Raid to Extort California Man 
at Behest of Chinese National 
The Associated Press (08/12, Antczak) reported that two former Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies and two 
former foreign military officials have been charged with threatening a Chinese national and his family with violence 
and deportation during a sham raid at his Orange County home five years ago, federal prosecutors said Monday. 
The four men also demanded $37 million and the rights to the man's business, according to the U.S. attorney's 
office in Los Angeles. Authorities have not released the businessman's name. The men were arraigned Monday on 
charges of conspiracy to commit extortion, attempted extortion, conspiracy against rights, and deprivation of rights 
under color of law. All pleaded not guilty. The article stated that prosecutors said the group drove to the victim's 
house in Irvine on June 17, 2019, and forced him, his wife and their two children into a room for hours, took their 
phones, and threatened to deport him unless he complied with their demands. Authorities said the man is a legal 
permanent resident. The article noted that the men slammed the businessman against a wall and choked him, 
prosecutors said. Fearing for his and his family's safety, he signed documents relinquishing his multimillion-dollar
