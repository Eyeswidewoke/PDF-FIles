New Questions Raised About Epstein Death After Video Reveals Mystery 'Orange Shape' 
Independent (07/31, Liddell) reported that a mysterious "orange shape" was seen on surveillance footage near 
Jeffrey Epstein's cell before his death, sparking debate over what or who it may be. Forensic experts argue that the 
shape could be a person wearing an orange prison jumpsuit, contradicting the DOJ's claim that it was a correctional 
officer carrying linen or clothing. The experts' analysis challenges the official narrative that Epstein died by suicide, 
with some questioning the authenticity of the released surveillance footage and the FBI's claim that no one could 
have entered Epstein's cell without being seen. 
Trump's Effort to Distract From Epstein Mess Creates a 'Ticking Time Bomb' 
The Rolling Stone (07/31, Suebsaeng) reported that the Trump administration's attempt to distract from the Jeffrey 
Epstein investigation by accusing former President Barack Obama of treason is not working, with many seeing it as 
a weak attempt at distraction. According to the article, the administration's efforts to promote a conspiracy theory 
about Obama and other former officials have been met with skepticism, and Trump's own base is not buying it, 
with some allies expressing frustration and disappointment. The article noted that the Epstein scandal continues to 
hurt Trump's poll numbers, with 61% of Americans believing the Epstein files contain embarrassing information 
about Trump, and the issue shows no signs of going away, remaining a major problem for the Trump 
administration. The article highlighted that FBI leadership helped push Epstein-related conspiracy theories when 
Trump was out of power. 
Continued Reporting: FBI Opens New Zealand Office to 'Counter the CCP, Says Director Patel 
The Epoch Times (07/31, Widerstrom) reported that the FBI has opened a new office in Wellington, New Zealand, 
expanding its presence in the Pacific to address growing security threats—including cybercrime, espionage, and 
influence from the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Director Patel, who made a discreet visit to Wellington, said in 
a video released by the U.S. Embassy that countering the CCP in the Pacific region is "one of the most important 
global issues" facing the two countries. According to the article, Director Patel made no public appearance and did 
not speak to the media. However, the U.S. Embassy later released a video of a speech of his remarks, in which he 
said the FBI has collaborated closely with NZ counterparts for years. "Expanding the Wellington office 
demonstrates the strength and evolution of our partnership as we continue to work together to address our shared 
security objectives in the region," he said. The article noted that a formal statement from the U.S. Embassy 
confirmed the establishment of a "dedicated law enforcement attaché office" in New Zealand. "While the FBI has 
stationed personnel in New Zealand for several years, establishing a full Legat position in the country will 
strengthen and enhance the long-standing cooperation with a key Five Eyes partner in the southwestern Pacific 
region," the statement said. The article added that aside from the growing influence of the CCP in the region, 
Director Patel's speech cited narcotics and cybercrime as particular issues for the region. He underscored the 
importance of the Five Eyes group of nations—comprising the United States, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and 
the United Kingdom—describing its members as "our greatest partners." "We need all of them, in New Zealand 
here, in the Indo-Pacific Command region, to get after the fight and put the mission first," he said. "The FBI has had 
a strong relationship and collaborated closely with our counterparts in New Zealand for years," said Director Patel 
in the press release. "Expanding the Wellington office demonstrates the strength and evolution of our partnership 
as we continue to work together to address our shared security objectives in the region." Additional reporting on
