The Partnership's strategy involves the funding o€ capital into equipment to be instated and used m various real estate properties. and the use of an energy services agreement in order to 
establish a payment stream in return for services provided to the building owner(s). There can be no assurance that the strategy will produce a particular rate of return or any return at all. Any 
strategy involving real estate involves a high degree of risk, including possible loss of contributed capital, and is sit table ()ley for sophisticated persons who can bear such losses. The execution 
of this strategy is dependent upon on the ability to engage appropriate service providers to provide cost effective supplies and services at various stages of each project. and the inability to do so 
world impact the execution of the strategy and/or any return on projects funded. In addition, although investment team members have had significant experience with energy efficiency retrofit 
projects for Deutsche Bank occupied properties, the ESA strategy being deployed by the Team is a new one and there is no operating experience upon which to evaluate the performance of this 
strategy. Any forecasts provided herein are based upon Deutsche Asset & Wealth Management's opinion of the market at this date and are subject to change dependent on the market. Past 
performance or any prediction. projection or forecast on the economy or markets is not indicative of future performance

segment, there are important difference between the prior retrofit projects described herein and the Target Projects being pursued pursuant to the strategy, including the following: (i) all of the 
projects described above involved Deutsche Bank-occupied buildings. whereas the strategy will not focus on projects in such buildings: (ii) most of the projects described above are smaller in 
scale and complexity than the Target Projects; (ii) of the buildings included in the list of projects. only ten had a profile of the type that the Partnership would consider (larger than 100.00 square 
feet, involving multiple components and addressing at least 10% of a building's energy usage): and (iv) none of the above projects were done pursuant to ESAs or involved certain elements of 
the strategy (for example, origination partners, calibrated simulation modeling and active energy management)
