over wearing masks is "firing up Americans. In south Florida, demonstrators burned masks,

is not giving up on passing a coronavirus relief measure before the election. Politico (10/25, 
Hooper, 4.29M) quotes Pelosi as saying, "I never give up hope. I'm optimistic. We put pen to

appeared on CNN's State Of The UnionVi (10/25, 1.29M), "didn't sound optimistic." Meadows 
said, "We continue to make offer after offer after offer, and Nancy Pelosi keeps moving the
