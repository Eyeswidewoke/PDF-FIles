ok so here is plan b 
Jeffrey, 
I am sorry to here you are ill, sue told =e you are sick in bed. And I am also sorry that I am having trouble =etting things 
done here in NY as you =equested. 
But as you will learn I plan for any =echnology failure a work around to get the job done. So lucky for us =ince I spent 
that $3000 so well I can still get a ton of work for you =one by monday. 
What I would do is since I =ought the unlimited OSX server disk I can go into HBRK and start =uilding the solution from 
there on a Macbook pro that no one is using. = I guess May Tang was "using it" but the thing is Blank = 
So let me install our first server =here instead. Because everything is linked with citrix I should be able =o get a ton of 
global linking done and at the very least it will give =e one more tool to discover other issues with the platform as is it. 
=hen when we buy the other gear on monday I can have that same day =elivered to 71st. 
One of the things I =ccomplished by buying that $3000 worth of gear at tekserve was I got us =ci the top of the food 
chain for fast service. I now have an account =anager there who will bust his ass for me cause he knows I represent =ou
of course I told him nothing about you at all because that is =rivate not your name company anything told him zero, but I 
made it =tear to him that when I call I want it done now! ) Thats how I was able =o get more done in my cab ride home 
then at 301. I had the whole show =eady to go and I could not get 301 to hit the buy button even though I =ad a super 
profession quote in everyones hands for $5,000 when I had a =erbal from you approving $20,000 and that I could buy 
the gear and =tart work tomorrow. 
I got your message =hat I was not to worry and we will deal with this on monday, but I want =ou to have all your options 
on the table before I accept =elay as the final word. 
All you have to =o is say GO boss and I will put plan B into action there will plenty of =ime for holiday and vacation once I 
get your stuff fixed and =orking. 
It's your call, you are number one, =t's all about me helping you first. All you have to do is approve plan = and I will 
report back to you monday what I learn over the weekend and =e move forward with plan A then. 
hope you get =etter soon 
thank you =scott
