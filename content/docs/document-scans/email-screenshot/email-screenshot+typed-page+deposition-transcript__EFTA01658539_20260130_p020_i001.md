political interference and determine whether this interference has violated the agencies' 
scientific integrity and communication policies." GAO spokesman Charles Young said, "We 
expect the work will start in January, as staff who cover those issues become available." 
Politico (10/19, Diamond, 4.29M) reports that in their request, Sens. Patty Murray (D-
WA), Gary Peters (D-MI), and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) "cited [a] report that administration 
officials sought to interfere with the CDC's flagship Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Reports in 
order to align with Trump's more optimistic message about the pandemic." Other incidents cited 
"include pressure on CDC to loosen its guidelines on re-opening schools" and HHS Secretary 
Azar overruling FDA officials on coronavirus testing rules. In a joint statement on Monday, the 
senators said, "The GAO's decision to conduct an independent audit is a good first step towards 
making sure that guidance coming from federal agencies is based on science and facts, not on 
the Trump Administration's political agenda or the President's whims." 
CDC Issues Recommendation For Masks On Planes, Other Public Transportation. 
The Washington Post (10/19, Sun, 14.2M) reports the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention on Monday "strongly recommended in newly issued guidelines that all passengers 
and workers on planes, trains, buses and other public transportation wear masks to control the 
spread of the novel coronavirus." The interim guidance "was issued following pressure from the 
airline industry and amid surging cases of the coronavirus and strong evidence on the 
effectiveness of masks in curbing transmission, according to CDC officials." However, "the 
recommendations fall short of what transportation industry leaders and unions had sought, and 
come long after evidence in favor of mask-wearing was well established." Bloomberg (10/19, 
Court, 4.73M), citing the Post's coverage, says the change "followed airline industry pressure 
and a request from Vice President Mike Pence," and "a note at the bottom of the web page 
states it was last reviewed on Monday." 
Reuters (10/19, Shepardson) reports the guidance "also calls for facial coverings at 
transportation hubs like airports and train stations." In its guidance, the CDC said, "Broad and 
routine utilization of masks on our transportation systems will protect Americans and provide 
confidence that we can once again travel more safely even during this pandemic." Reuters says 
many airlines, as well as "Amtrak and most public transit systems and US airports already 
require all passengers and workers to wear facial coverings, as do most airports, and ride-
sharing firms Uber and Lyft." However, "the White House in July opposed language in a bill 
before Congress that would have mandated all airline, train and public transit passengers and 
workers to wear masks." 
USA Today (10/19, Woodyard, 10.31M) reports the CDC also said that if passengers 
refuse to wear masks, transportation providers should, "at the earliest opportunity, disembark 
any person who refuses to comply." 
One Million Air Passengers Screened For COVID Sunday. The AP (10/19, Ott) 
reports that the "number of passengers screened in a single day for flights in the US topped 
one million for the first time since COVID-19 infections began to spike last March." The "notable 
milestone, reached Sunday, signifies both the progress made since the darkest days of 
pandemic for the devastated US airline industry, when fewer than 100,000 people were 
screened per day in April, and how far it still has to go." The "million plus passengers screened 
Sunday compares with 2.6 million on the same day last year, or roughly 60% fewer, according 
to the Transportation Security Administration." 
Top Military Leaders Permitted To Return To Pentagon For Work. 
The AP (10/19) reports, "The nation's top military leaders have been cleared to return to work 
at the Pentagon after having self-quarantined as a precaution following the positive COVID-19 
test of a senior Coast Guard official in early October." The approval "to resume work from the 
Pentagon was given last week, in accordance with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
