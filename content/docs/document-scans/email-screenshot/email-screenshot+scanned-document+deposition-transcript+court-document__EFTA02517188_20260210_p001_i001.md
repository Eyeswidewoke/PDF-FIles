recent planning has been remarkable&nbsp; given the highly&nb=p; unusual circumstances.&nbsp; aggressively 
suggesting "I am talking out of =oth sides of my mouth" when i say that I strongly beliieve your team needs to be=br> 
seriously upgraded to match the high As you are well aware, There is little I won't do for you, or at least try to do&nbsp; 
as = friend, and&nbsp; a great deal&nbsp; that I have already done (&nbsp; b=th known and some things that&nbsp; 
willneed to&nbsp; remain unknown.) &nbsp; Our arrangement was for me to architect&nbs=; sophisticated structures 
that would be beneficial to you.&nbsp;&nbs=; that is what l&nbsp; have done &nbsp; and will continue&nbsp; do in 
or=er to fulfill my obligations under our&nbsp; agreement.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp;=discovered fact that 
you&nbsp; in reality need an entire&nbsp; family office built from scratch has been trying<=r> &nbsp; I have&nbsp; 
aleady&nbsp; agreed&nbsp; 
de- facto to try to&nbsp; help.&nbsp; I would&nbsp;&nbsp; s=ggest that Phaidons payroll and attention pales in 
importance&nbsp; to your personal structure,which has taken a back seat, Some of &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; my 
suggestions&nbsp; regarding the Eysium&nbsp= office&nbsp; are as follows&nbsp;&nbsp; you will need a budget of 3- 5 
million per year.&nbsp; CEO&nbsp; 1 million,&nbsp; new tax person to work with rich, 250.&nbsp; new 
bookkeeper&nbsp; ,200&nbsp;&nbsp; new paralegal to work with ADA Alan etc , coordinating with Apollo, Akin , paul 
weiss , new acct openings , &nbsp; sec filings, sales tax review,&nbsp; et=. 
&nbsp; $150 . art 
point person. loan , inventory, purchasing support, &nbsp; $??&am=;nbsp; software servers. video conferencing,&nbsp; 
tax oversight. &nbsp;&nbsp;<=r> <br></div>&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe&nbsp; You should&nbsp; rapidly address 
trustees&nbsp; , gift trust,&n=sp; succesion,&nbsp; wills of debra and children,&nbsp; ,&nbsp; monetization&nbsp; 
events = cash flow. etc &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can of course&nbsp; share my experiences with you on each issue. 
<br></div>&nbspAnbsp; 
With regard&nbsp; the more pressing issue I am uncertain of just =ow to proceed.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am torn, as my very 
strong inclination is no= to be involved at all .&nbsp; It is extremely time consuming, delicate, fraught with many pitfall 
many that will make you very upset and a major pain in the ass.&nbsp;&nbsp; I wrote you months ago that the quality of 
the people involved need to&nb=p; be upgraded. ( lucky for me&nbsp; these last issues arose way before=the begining 
of my involvement ) &nbsp; I am also aware however&nbsp; of&nbs=; my overarching friendship&nbsp; obligations 
of&nbsp; ok, -given all the complexities&nbsp; who else can do it? problem. <br>&nbsp;Your family office needs a 
daddy.&a=p;nbsp; children with good intentions are running around , sniping , nitpicking with little direction.&nbsp; As a 
stopgap measure I am suggesting , we put i= Larry Delson to take charge&nbsp; Everyone would report to him.&nbs=; 
eileen included. He would however work for me.&nbsp; this is not, by a long 
first choice as I prefer only&nbsp; being responsible and standin= behind my own personal&nbsp; 
word DONE will no long=r be transmitted to reflect status stated&nbsp; by others )&nbsp; 
<br></div>&nbspAnbspAnbsp; With no commitment onar> my part whatsoever, to do it. So far 
failed&n=sp; in my attempt in&nbsp; trying to think&nbsp; through the problem&nbsp= creatively
