COUNTER-TERRORISM 
Woman Accused Of Sending Ricin Letter Wanted Trump To Drop Reelection Campaign. 
The CBS Evening NewsVi (9/22, story 9, 0:25, O'Donnell, 4.31M) reported on new details 
"about a Canadian woman accused of trying to mail an extremely toxic poison to President 
Trump." Pascale Ferrier on Tuesday appeared in federal court in Buffalo after she "allegedly 
sending Ricin in an envelope that was intercepted at a screening facility." The FBI "says the 
letter contained threats and demand that Mr. Trump abandon his reelection bid." 
The New York Times (9/22, 18.61M) reports the woman "wanted President Trump to drop 
out of the presidential race and pledged to find other ways to assassinate him if her poisoning 
plot failed, according to court documents unsealed on Tuesday." Ferrier had "a knife with her 
and a loaded gun holstered on her waist when she was arrested on Sunday." She "wrote in a 
threatening and scornful letter sent with the ricin that she believed Mr. Trump was a dictator 
who was hurting the United States." 
USA Today (9/22, 10.31M) reports that Ferrier, 53, "has been charged with threatening 
President Donald Trump for allegedly mailing a letter laced with the poison ricin along with a 
message that referred to Trump as an 'Ugly Tyrant Clown,' and called on him to 'remove your 
application for this election,' according to court documents. 'I made a special gift for you to 
make a decision,' Pascale Cecile Veronique Ferrier allegedly wrote, referring to the potentially 
lethal powdery substance inside. 'If it doesn't work, I'll find a better recipe for another poison or 
I might use my gun when I'll be able to come. Enjoy!'" 
The Washington Post (9/22, Hsu, 14.2M) reports that Ferrier "pleaded not guilty in federal 
court in New York to sending a threatening, ricin-laced letter to President Trump." Ferrier "was 
charged by complaint with one felony count of making a threat against the U.S. president. The 
FBI in charging papers also alleged that she was linked to similar letters sent to employees at 
detention facilities in Texas, where she was incarcerated last year." Ferrier, "a computer 
programmer from Quebec, was arrested Sunday in Buffalo upon reentering the United States 
from Canada. She made an initial court appearance Tuesday before U.S. Magistrate H. Kenneth 
Schroeder Jr. of Buffalo, who entered the not guilty plea." 
The Hill (9/22, Budryk, 2.98M) reports that FBI officials "said they had discovered six 
letters with similar language sent from Canada in September that appeared to have been 
received in Texas. Officials said the targets were people associated with places where Ferrier 
was incarcerated last year and that they had matched her fingerprints to four of the letters." 
The Hill adds, "Ferrier was jailed last March in Hidalgo County on weapons charges and a
