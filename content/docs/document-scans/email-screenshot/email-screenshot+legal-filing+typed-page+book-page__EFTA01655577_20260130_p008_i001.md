How ISIS and AI-Qaeda Are Using Al to Target American Jews 
Newsweek (02/05, Sager) reported that a digital safety coalition said that artificial intelligence (Al) has enhanced 
content for lone-wolf terrorist attacks by ISIS and Al-Qaeda against Jewish communities in the United States. "The 
trend is unmistakable," Marc Ginsberg, a former U.S. ambassador and the president of the Coalition for a Safer 
Web, said. "That is a whole new level of threat that I don't think anybody understands or appreciates how 
sophisticated the penetration operation has really become." According to the article, following the anniversary of 
October 7, the Coalition for a Safer Web found numerous ISIS and Al-Qaeda websites accompanied by generative Al 
videos, programs and memes of Gaza's destruction and injured Palestinians. The content is manipulated to appeal 
to potential lone-wolf recruits in the U.S. to start retribution against Israel's supporters in the U.S., particularly the 
Jewish community. Since mid-2024, ISIS and AI-Qaeda have been upgrading their propaganda by incorporating 
generative Al programs, according to Ginsberg and his team's research. The Al programs create a "super stylized" 
version of extremist web content. It also allows terrorist groups to manipulate algorithms and breach social media 
content, inciting antisemitic operations. "Generative Al has been hijacked by ISIS and Al-Qaeda in their respective 
campaigns to achieve global dominance over the other, to leverage the Gaza war, to incite and recruit domestic 
based U.S. nationals and not to attempt to infiltrate any personnel actually from their operations into the U.S.," 
Ginsberg said. The article mentioned that there is a surge In terror plots against U.S. Jewish targets since late 2024. 
The article noted that the FBI and Canadian authorities arrested 20-year-old Muhammad Shazeb Khan, a Pakistani 
citizen, while he was en route to a planned mass shooting in support of ISIS at a Jewish center in Brooklyn on 
September 4, 2024. The shooting would have coincided with the anniversary of the Hamas attack on Israel. The 
article added that the Houston FBI Counterterrorism Task Force arrested Anas Said on November 8. The 28-year-old 
Houston native was taken into custody for conspiring with ISIS web designers to plot a mass casualty attack against 
a Houston Jewish installation. 
Opinion: Trump's Plan for the Cartels Isn't Tough Enough 
An opinion piece by the New York Times (02/05, Freeman) stated that Trump is right about the immense power of 
Mexico's transnational drug cartels and the grave threat they pose to American lives. The author added that 
they agree that weakening and dismantling the cartels should rank at or near the top of U.S. foreign policy 
priorities. The author argued that the problem with Trump's plan to take them on is that it's not tough or serious 
enough. The author mentioned that Trump devoted some of his first hours back in the Oval Office to the threat of 
the cartels, including signing an executive order to designate some of them as terrorist organizations. The author 
claimed that the cartels are not terrorist groups like Al Qaeda or ISIS. Cartels like Mexico's two largest, the Sinaloa 
cartel and the Jalisco New Generation cartel, do not want to overthrow the state or remold society in their image. 
They have a less ambitious goal: limitless profits. The author provided the opinion that if Trump and those around 
him are serious about weakening the cartels, they need a serious plan. They need to see the cartels for what they 
truly are: predatory multinational businesses. He needs a strategy to hit them where it hurts — in the pocketbook.

Companies 
Decrypt (02/05, Edwards) reported that a former Google engineer faces up to 175 years in jail after being accused 
of stealing trade secrets in a DOJ indictment. Linwei (Leon) Ding, 38, was charged by a federal grand jury in San 
Francisco with seven counts of economic espionage and a further seven counts of theft of trade secrets. Ding, who 
was arrested in March 2024 and is currently under investigation by the FBI, is accused of having uploaded 
proprietary data on Google Al supercomputer hardware infrastructure and software to his personal account. The 
Dal claims he was doing this to benefit Chinese firms and, ultimately, "the PRC government and 
instrumentalities." Ding had allegedly been in talks with the chief technology officer of a Chinese tech company 
since June 2022 and is accused of uploading more than 1,000 Google documents to his personal cloud account 
between May 2022 and 2023. According to the DOJ, details about Google's SmartNIC, Tensor Processing Unit and 
Graphics Processing Unit chips were all stolen, while Ding is accused of leaking software built for next-gen Al
