time, AIPAC's sister organisation, The Washington Institute for Near East Policy, managed to place its member= in key 
posts in successive American administrations and generally shape A=erican policy towards the region. Pro-Israeli neo-
conservatives pushed the=United States into war against Iraq -- because Saddam Hussein was seen as a potential threat 
to Israel --=and are now echoing the call of Israel's Prime Minister Binyamin Netanya=u for war against Iran. Against this 
background, it is not altogether surp=ising that the United States has been unable to halt Israel's land-grab of Palestinian 
territory, let alo=e persuade it to make peace with the Palestinians and the rest of the Arab=world. 
• Yet another factor which helps explain the present disastrous situation=is the collapse of Arab nationalism and its 
replacement by the rise of mil=tant Islam. Arab leaders failed to coordinate their efforts in support of =oint policies. 
Equally, they failed in their dealings with Western powers to use their considerable financial =nd oil and gas resources in 
support of Arab causes. The Arab League, a vic=im of inter-Arab quarrels, remains something of a broken reed. 
What needs to be done? What are the key challenges facing the leading Arab =tates as well as the new American 
Administration? A great deal will hang o= the way the United States adapts to its changing position in the world. O=ce 
the world's dominant power, it must now come to terms with a new multi-polar international system. Ame=ica's relative 
decline (largely brought about by its catastrophic wars a=d the misbehaviour of its deregulated financial institutions) has 
been mat=hed by the rapid rise of China and a resurgent Russia. 
The challenges are daunting. First, an urgent effort needs to be made to re=olve the Arab-Israel conflict and bring to 
birth a Palestinian state. Noth=ng could better stabilise the region. Secondly, Arab leaders should work f=r a Sunni-Shia 
reconciliation, which must also require an entente with Iran. Iran should be the Arabs' =artner, not its enemy. The 
United States, in turn, should seek to negotiat= a 'win-win' deal with Tehran -- a perfectly feasible outcome which wo=ld 
at a stroke remove a major source of dangerous tension. Finally, the United States, the Arab states and the =est of the 
world should unite in finding a solution to the rise of Islamic=violence. This must surely be done by negotiation and re-
education -- and =y a change of state policies -- rather than by force. 
Is there even the slightest hope that any of this will be accomplished?

Stratfor 
The Next U.S.=Foreign Policy Team 
Robert D. Kaplan 
With the U.S. presi=ential election over, speculation now commences about the makeup of the de=ense and foreign 
policy team that will assume power following the presiden=ial inauguration Jan. 20. It is not only a matter of who will be 
the next secretary of defense, secretary of s=ate and national security adviser but also who will fill the critical depu=y 
positions one, two and three steps below, at the level where the real da=-to-day decisions are made. For what is often 
just one line in a newspaper -- the United States and Pakist=n resume cooperation on this or that, or the United States 
and Australia decide to upgrade their military relationship<=a> -- entails many hours of negotiations =ith several 
American officials present at all times overseas. <http://us4.account-
