nine major areas, including overall requirements, stock market, bond market, private equity, futures 
market, the competitiveness of the securities and futures sector, capital market openness, financial 
risks and market regulation. The policy is also referred as the "New National Nine Rules", in contrast to 
the earlier "National Nine Rules" issued in 2004. Under the nine broad guidelines, details on the 
directions and goals of reforms for thirty-three areas are specified, signaling the unprecedented 
resolution of Chinese government to push forward the comprehensive capital market reforms. It is 
government's aim to establish multi-layer capital markets, enlarge corporate and household investment 
channel, encourage efficient capital allocation as well as promote the economic 
restructuring. From macroeconomic perspective, we highlight the below reforms: 
Further opening up China's capital markets 
Following the recent announcement of Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect Scheme on Apr 10, the Guideline 
again emphasizes on opening up the capital markets, with an aim to facilitate the cross-border investment 
and financing activities. Both inward and outward investment quotas under QFII and QOII programs will be 
increased. The shareholding limits for foreign capital in listcos will be relaxed. Domestic capital 
market will be steadily opened up for the direct investment of foreign individuals, and the domestic 
individuals investing in foreign capital market will be orderly pushed forward. Moreover, Xiao Gang, 
chairman of CSRC said this march that the potential QFII expansion is huge, and he mentioned that CSRC 
has been working on the QFII tax policy with other government agencies, as part of the effort to help 
facilitate QFII expansion this year. 
we believed that this proposal will help inject more liquidity into china A share market, as well as 
expedite China's progresses in capital account liberalization in a boarder sense, including a) further 
relaxing the foreign investment management like holding period and remittance; b) implementing and 
expanding the Stock Connect scheme (see our Apr 11 note "A leap in China's efforts to liberalize capital 
accounts"); c) establishing capital account convertibility in SHFTZ and developing a domestic RMB 
offshore market; d) permitting cross-border RMB remittances by individuals and broadening channels for 
offshore banks to borrow/lend RM6 in domestic market.
