> Apollo flight is one that qualifies for Apollo reimbursement and Apollo p=ys for. 
> Pro forma depends on when Apollo gives us data. Hopefully very soon. 
> Gift tax case wasn't "advice". Just a blurb Joe read in a publication. =e might well have got it wrong. It was just 
something he thought he rememb=red and mentioned in passing. He was making the point that it might be a =ad idea 
for a tax return to have info that is factually wrong even if the =ax is right. Whether the case exists or not, that advice 
hardly seems craz=. 
> Joe V is the best person we saw and is doing a great job. We have hired t=p lawyers and accountants. Always glad to 
see better people but we are not=finding them. And very hard to find jacks of all trades. We tend to see n=rrow 
expertise. 
> S&C reviewed our estate planning and basically said everything we are doi=g is fine. EY reviewed our income tax 
planning and has been helpful, but h=s not had great suggestions for changing anything. 
> If you see specific things we should be doing differently let us know wha= they are. If you know of people who will 
have greater insight than the on=s we are using, we are eager to talk to them. 
> I too wish Leon would sell more art. We may have losses to partially off=et art gains. To the extent we do not, as you 
have pointed out, getting a =tep up on death may be preferable for the pieces with gain. In any event, =e don't know if 
Leon is willing to sell. So we cannot plan around that. My=goal is to be able to tell him "If you sell certain art you will 
achieve t=e following benefits." Not quite there yet. 
> On the CLATs, I hear you that no one has experience with art. But as you =ave pointed out, Leon's situation is unique. 
Unless we hear specific reaso=s why it doesn't work it is hard to ignore the unanimous chorus of opinion= that it is a 
sound planning tool.

cant be found be=ause it doesnt exist. you are getting childish advice and data. ? sor=y. I was very clear with leon 
that you need a senior tax advisor . per=on. Joe V is not it. 
you have bookkeepers , accountants and enad = 
compliance. you going around to others to see how they work is in my=opinion the height of silliness. 
I consider 
you tthe best thing that =appened to elysium . and have been quite vocal about it. hire the best =eople . they cost
