US Sanctions International Criminal Court Officials. 
Reuters (9/2, Psaledakis, Nichols) reports the US on Wednesday imposed sanctions "on 
International Criminal Court prosecutor Fatou Bensouda, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said, 
over her investigation into whether American forces committed war crimes in Afghanistan." 
Pompeo also "said Phakiso Mochochoko, the head of the ICC's Jurisdiction, Complementarity 
and Cooperation Division, had also been blacklisted under sanctions authorized by President 
Donald Trump in June that allow for asset freezes and travel bans." Pompeo also "said that 
individuals and entities that continue to materially support Bensouda and Mochochoko would 
risk exposure to sanctions as well." The ICC has dismissed the measures as "another attempt to 
interfere with the court's judicial and prosecutorial independence" and said in a statement that 
it stands by the work of its staff. 
CNN (9/2, Hansler, 83.16M) reports the sanctions are the Trump Administration's "most 
aggressive move yet to try to deter an ICC investigation into possible war crimes by US military 
and intelligence officials." Pompeo said, "Additionally, the State Department has restricted the 
issuance of visas for certain individuals involved in the ICC's efforts to investigate US 
personnel." 
The Wall Street Journal (9/2, Talley, McBride, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) reports the 
Treasury Department added the two ICC officials to its blacklist under a June executive order 
saying the ICC's work threatens US officials and national security.
