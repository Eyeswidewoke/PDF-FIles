Inside the Supreme Court Decision That Could Lop Years Off Sentences For Capitol Rioters 
Newsweek (06/05, Bond) reported that the U.S. Supreme Court is set to decide on Fischer v. United States, a case 
that could significantly impact the sentences of roughly 350 people charged with obstruction during the January 6, 
2021, Capitol riot. The case centers around the use of Section 1512(c)(2), a statute originally enacted to address 
evidence tampering and witness intimidation in the aftermath of the Enron scandal. According to the article, the 
statute's broad language makes it a crime to "obstruct, influence, or impede any official proceeding," which has 
been applied to many Capitol rioters. Joseph Fischer, a Pennsylvania police officer, was charged under this statute 
after entering the Capitol during the riot. His attorney argued that the statute was not intended to cover actions 
like those on January 6. The article explained that during oral arguments, Justice Neil Gorsuch questioned whether 
the statute's application could be too broad, potentially criminalizing actions such as heckling in court or pulling a 
fire alarm before a congressional vote. 
'Racial Resentment' a Factor in Violence of 6 January 2021, Study Says 
The Guardian (06/05, Herman) reported that a study found "racial resentment," rather than just partisanship, 
contributed to the violence of the January 6, 2021 Capitol riot. The study, conducted by David Wilson and Darren 
Davis, revealed that many of Trump's supporters believed they were victimized by election fraud and 
disadvantaged by African Americans and other minorities. The research showed a correlation between feelings of 
racial resentment and opposition to the House select committee investigating January 6, highlighting that white 
voters, including those affiliated with white-nationalist groups, were particularly influenced by claims of election 
rigging in heavily Black cities.

House Appropriators Reject GSA's $3.58 Plan for New FBI Headquarters 
Federal News Network (06/05, Doubleday) reported that House appropriators are pushing back on the General 
Services Administration's plan to invest billions in a new FBI headquarters in suburban Maryland. The GOP-led 
House Appropriations Committee's fiscal 2025 general government spending bill rejects a $3.5 billion proposal 
from the General Services Administration to finance a new FBI headquarters building in Greenbelt, Maryland. The 
article added that the spending bill passed out of the general government and financial services subcommittee 
along party lines on Wednesday morning. It's now slated to be considered by the full committee. Rep. Jim Jordan 
(R-OH) reportedly urged House Appropriations Committee Chairman Tom Cole (R-OK) to prohibit taxpayer funding 
for any new FBI headquarters facility. The article stated that the Biden administration nominally ended a decade-
long disagreement over the future of the FBI headquarters when GSA announced the new Greenbelt site last 
November. GSA selected a Maryland site over competing sites in Virginia.

prosecutors such as Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg (D) and Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis (D) 
in the wake of former President Trump's conviction in the hush money case. The article added that GOP lawmakers 
are calling for cutting funding for the DOJ and the FBI, even though relatively few federal dollars go to the local 
offices run by Willis and Bragg. The article stated that they're also seeking to hold Attorney General Merrick 
Garland in contempt of Congress, though they appear to lack the votes to do so. According to the article, it's all 
part of a broader attack on a justice system the GOP blames for the guilty verdict by a New York jury against Trump
