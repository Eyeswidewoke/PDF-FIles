FBI Joins Investigation as Body of Minnesota Teen Missing Since May Found in Landfill 
CBS News (07/01, Chapman, Kaplan) reported that a 16-year-old Twin Cities boy missing since early May has been 
found dead, authorities said Tuesday. According to the article, after nearly a month of searching the Waste 
Management Landfill in Elk River, authorities found the remains of Jordan Dupree Collins Jr., there on Saturday, 
Anoka County Sheriff Brad Wise said. An autopsy has been completed, but Collins' cause of death remains 
undetermined, according to Columbia Heights Police Chief Matt Markham. Collins was last seen May 8 near the 
4900 block of University Avenue Northeast in Columbia Heights, Minnesota. He had been living at an apartment 
building near there with his father since mid-April, according to Collins' mother. The article mentioned that Wise 
said the search shifted to the landfill on June 4 after authorities "were offered information that led to a video, and 
that video showed some evidence that would suggest the body might've made its way into a dumpster and into a 
garbage truck." The article added that the FBI is assisting in the investigation. Newsweek (07/01, Silverman) also 
reported on the story. 
DNA Evidence Ties Fugitive Father to Alleged Murder of Three Daughters as Manhunt Leads Run Cold 
Fox News (07/01, Bonavita) reported that as the manhunt for a survivalist father accused of killing his three 
daughters before disappearing into the Washington wilderness sails past the one-month mark, local authorities are 
expressing their frustration as the trail begins to run dry. "I'm still angry," Chelan County Sheriff's Deputy Mike 
McLeod said as he recounted the search for 33-year-old Travis Decker. "He still hasn't been found." Decker, a 
former member of the U.S. Army and a trained survivalist, is wanted for allegedly killing his three children — Paityn, 
9, Olivia, 5, and Evelyn, 8. The girls were reported missing by their mother, Whitney Decker, May 30 after they did 
not return home from a court-mandated custody visit with their father. Numerous local, state and federal agencies 
have continued to comb the wilderness for the fugitive father while experiencing several environmental hurdles, 
according to Chelan County Sheriff Mike Morrison. 
Continued Reporting: FBI Investigates Three Major Hospitals for Mutilating Children 
The Daily Citizen (07/01, Washburn) reported that the FBI has initiated criminal investigations into employees at 
Boston Children's Hospital, Children's Hospital Colorado and Children's Hospital Los Angeles for performing 
irreversible "transgender" medical procedures on children. The inquiries follow several statements from the Trump 
administration promising to prosecute so-called gender affirming care for children under laws preventing child 
abuse and female genital mutilation. On June 2, the FBI wrote on X and Facebook, "As the Attorney General has 
made clear, we will protect our children and hold accountable those who mutilate them under the guise of gender-
affirming care." 
MS-13 Leader to Be Sentenced in Racketeering Case Involving Eight Murders 
The Associated Press (07/01, Marcelo) reported that the leader of an MS-13 clique in the suburbs of New York City 
faces sentencing Wednesday in a federal racketeering case involving eight murders, including the 2016 killings of 
two high school girls that focused the nation's attention on the violent Central American street gang. According to 
the article, Alexi Saenz pleaded guilty last year for his role in ordering and approving the killings as well as other 
crimes during a rash of bloody violence that prompted President Donald Trump to make several visits to Long 
Island and call for the death penalty for Saenz and other gang members during his first term in the White House. 
35 People Charged in "Dismantling" of Pennsylvania Drug Rings That Flooded Montgomery County With 
Crack Cocaine 
CBS News (07/01, Brandt) reported that thirty-five people were criminally charged Tuesday after a months long 
investigative operation targeting the drug market in Norristown, Pennsylvania, Montgomery County District 
Attorney Kevin Steele said in a news release. Hundreds of pages of court documents show how "Operation Cocaine 
Goldmine" used wiretaps, confidential informants, controlled buys and other surveillance to track three drug 
trafficking organizations in Norristown — the county seat — from late 2024 to June 2025. Steele said the 
investigation took place as opioid and fentanyl use declined, but "cocaine and crack cocaine experienced a 
resurgence, in part due to the dramatic decline in wholesale cocaine prices." The article added that as bulk 
traffickers, mid-level suppliers, and street-level dealers were able to get easier access to large quantities of the drug 
due to the price shifts, county detectives worked with the Pennsylvania Attorney General's Office, FBI, DEA and 
Norristown police on targeting networks operating in Norristown. Steele said the investigation has helped identify 
"intertwined networks of individuals who are most responsible for the trafficking of bulk quantities of cocaine into 
Montgomery County."
