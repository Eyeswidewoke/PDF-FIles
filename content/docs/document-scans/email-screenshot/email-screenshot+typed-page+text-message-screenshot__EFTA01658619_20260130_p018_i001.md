The AP (9/22) reports from New York, "Two dealers of ancient art were indicted Tuesday for 
allegedly creating fake ownership histories for the antiquities they sold through auction houses 
in New York." Erdal Dere and Faisal Khan "used the identities of deceased collectors to create 
the fake histories for antiquities they sold through Dere's New York company, Fortuna Fine Arts 
Ltd, according to the indictment unsealed Tuesday." Federal prosecutors "alleged that beginning 
in 2015, Dere drafted fake documents to show ownership history for items his company 
possessed and for new items Khan bought, primarily in Asia. Khan, Dere's associate in the 
business, located buyers for the items in the U.S. and overseas. The FBI's art crime team and 
the New York City police department's major theft task force collaborated on the investigation, 
along with authorities in Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom, Spain, and France."

Shopify Says Customer Data Was Likely Exposed As Employees Accessed Records. 
Reuters (9/22) reports, "Shopify Inc said on Tuesday data of customers who shopped at fewer 
than 200 merchants listed on the company's e-commerce platform was likely exposed after two 
employees tried to steal transaction records." Reuters adds, "The data exposed includes email, 
name, and address, as well as order details, but does not involve complete payment card 
numbers or financial information, the Canadian company said." Shopify "said it immediately 
terminated the access of the individuals, who were part of its support team, to its network and 
was working with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other international agencies in the 
investigation." 
The Globe and Mail (CAN) (9/22, 1.04M) reports, "Shopify Inc. is working with the FBI 
after two 'rogue members' of its support team engaged in a scheme to illegitimately obtain 
customer transactional records of some merchants. The Ottawa-based tech firm says it 
terminated the employees' access to its network and referred the data breach to law 
enforcement. Shopify says it doesn't have evidence at this point in the investigation that the 
data was used." 
Trump's WeChat Restrictions "Could Hit Americans Instead." 
Politico (9/22, Wertime, 4.29M) reports that if a proposed US ban on WeChat introduced Friday 
passes judicial review, "there would be virtually no new users in the U.S. after that, while for 
existing ones, the app would quickly start to "degrade" and would get more hobbled over time." 
Politico says that the Trump Administration's move is "driven by serious concerns about the 
uses and abuses of data by an authoritarian government," but has "nonetheless caused deep 
consternation among technologists, China watchers and the Chinese diaspora because it not 
only bans WeChat from America; it also effectively bans Americans from WeChat." In the 
process, Politico says, "it begins to revoke the digital passport that the Internet has implicitly 
conferred on U.S. citizens for decades - effacing the freedom baked into the moral and 
technical architecture of their country's grandest modern invention." 
WPost: US Ban On WeChat Will Make Whole World Less Free. The Washington
