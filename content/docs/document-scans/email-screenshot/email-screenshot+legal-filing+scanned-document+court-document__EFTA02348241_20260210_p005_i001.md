Should that happen, the Israeli government would have no choice but to take=over the entire Gaza Strip. However, 
doing so could weaken Hamas so much t=at the ultra-extremist Palestinian groups could simply push it aside. 
For this reason, it is paradoxically in Israel's interest not to allow the =ngoing offensive to severely batter Hamas and

Netanyahu and Barak are now walking a perilous tightrope -- and one of thei= own making.

The World's Next Genocide 
Simon Adams 
November 15, 2012 -- AT a recent meeting hosted by the United States Holoc=ust Memorial Museum in Washington, 
Peter W. Galbraith, a former American a=bassador who witnessed ethnic cleansing in the former Yugoslavia, made a 
c=illing prediction. "The next genocide in the world," he said, "will =ikely be against the Alawites in 
Syria<http://topics.nytimes.com/top/newsAnternational/countriesandterritories/syria/index.html?inline=nyt-geo>.=94 
A few months ago, talk of possible massacres of Alawites, who dominate Bash=r al-
Assad<http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/a/ba=har_al_assad/index.html?inline=nyt-per>'s 
government in Syria, seemed =ike pro-regime propaganda. Now, it is a real possibility. 
For more than a year, Mr. Assad's government has been committing crimes a=ainst humanity in Syria. As it fights for 
survival on the streets of Alepp= and Damascus, the risk of unrestrained reprisals against Mr. Assad's Al=wite sect and 
Syria's other religious minorities is growing every day. 
Following the rise to power of Mr. Assad's father, Hafez, in 1970, Alawit=s were transformed from a persecuted minority 
sect to the controlling forc= within the army and government. With a system of perks similar to those i= other 
dictatorships, the elder Mr. Assad drew other religious and ethnic =inorities into his political orbit while rebellions by 
members of the Sunn= majority, like the one in Hama in 1982, were mercilessly crushed. 
When the Arab Spring reached Syria last year, it dredged up animosities tha= had been lurking for decades. The protest 
movement was avowedly nonsectar=an, attracting Syrians from all communities. But in the government's eye=, the 
opposition was simply a Sunni front seeking to topple the Assad fami=y and end Alawite rule. 
The Syrian government's actions have deepened the sectarian divide. As th= violent repression of protests gave way to 
the destruction of opposition-=ontrolled villages, the government moved from targeting individual dissent=rs to 
imposing collective punishment upon entire neighborhoods. Sunni area= were shelled by artillery and tanks, and the 
pro-government shabiha milit=a, made up mainly of Alawites, carried out ferocious massacres of men, wom=n and 
children. The majority of victims were Sunni civilians. 
As the civil war intensifies, Mr. Assad is increasingly outsourcing the dir=y work. In Damascus, militia groups within 
Druse, Christian and Shiite are=s are being armed by the government. While the justifications for these mi=itias are 
"neighborhood self-defense" and the protection of religious =ites, the shabiha emerged in a similar way before 
becoming killing squads =or Mr. Assad. And by drawing Christians, Druse, Shiites and Alawites into =he civil war on an 
explicitly sectarian basis, the Syrian government has a=l but guaranteed that there will be reprisals against these 
communities if=Mr. Assad falls. 
Indeed, as pro-democracy protests degenerated into civil war, the ideologic=l composition of the opposition changed. 
The Free Syrian Army's slogan r=mains, "We are all one people of one country." But inside Syria those =hanting 
"Christians to Beirut, Alawites to their graves!" have become =ore than a fringe element. Human Rights Watch and other 
groups have docume=ted cases of rebels executing Syrian soldiers and Alawites regarded as gov=rnment collaborators. 
Growing numbers of foreign Sunni extremist fighters are battling not just t= rid Syria of Mr. Assad, but to religiously 
cleanse it. As a result, many =yrian Christians now fear that their fate will mirror that of Iraqi Christ=ans, who were 
largely forced out of Iraq by war and sectarian terrorism. T=e city of Homs was once home to 80,000 Christians; there 
are now reportedl= fewer than 400. 
Three vetoes by Russia and China have blocked attempts by the United Nation= Security Council to hold the Syrian 
government accountable for its crimes= But those who have opted for a proxy war in Syria and who are now financi=g 
the rebels cannot avoid responsibility for what comes next. 
Governments that have publicly committed themselves to helping end Syria'= misery, including the United States, must 
immediately do two things to he=p prevent a violent backlash against Alawites and other minorities. First, they must
