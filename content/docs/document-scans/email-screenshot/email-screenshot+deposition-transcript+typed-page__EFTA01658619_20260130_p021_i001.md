Times (9/22, Swoyer, 492K), "Romney's support for moving the confirmation process forward 
so close to the Nov. 3 elections was a surprise." 
Reuters (9/22, Sullivan) reports "Romney's decision left Democrats with few hopes of 
blocking Senate confirmation of the Republican president's third appointment to the high court," 
Politico (9/22, Everett, 4.29M) that Senate Majority Leader McConnell "now has the votes he 
needs to move forward with a nominee," and The Hill (9/22, Carney, 2.98M) that McConnell 
"has essentially locked down support within his 53-member caucus to move a Supreme Court 
nominee this year." That is the likely outcome, says CQ Roll Call (9/22, Lesniewski, 154K), 
"barring a monumental surprise." The Federalist (9/22, Justice, 126K) also says "the GOP-
controlled Senate has enough votes to confirm," with Townhall (9/22, McCarthy, 177K), the 
Daily Caller (9/22, Rodgers, 716K), and Breitbart (9/22, Bleau, 673K), among other 
conservative news outlets, running similar analyses. 
To the New York Times (9/22, Fandos, 18.61M), "Romney's decision capped off an 
extraordinarily swift and enthusiastic rally by Republicans around Mr. Trump's position that 
underscored his iron grip on the party four years into his presidency. But it also reflected the 
political bargain that has been driving Republicans for much of the past four years," with 
"Republican senators...loyally" standing "behind the president at every turn, even as he 
trampled party principles, shattered institutional norms and made crass statements." Now, adds 
the Times, "with the biggest prize of all in reach - a third seat further tipping the Supreme 
Court to the right - they are rushing to collect on their bet, even if it is the last thing they do 
before they lose their Senate majority, Mr. Trump loses the presidency, or both." The Wall Street 
Journal (9/22, Subscription Publication, 7.57M), among other news outlets, also covers the 
story. 
Vice President Pence said on WRKO-AMVi Boston (9/22, 9K) that "the President is going 
to announce a strong, principled woman as our nominee to the Supreme Court. We welcome 
the fact that now a majority of members of the Senate, Republicans all, are willing to vote, and 
the President and I really believe that in the event that there are issues and controversies in 
this election that rise to the level of the Supreme Court, the American people deserve to have 
nine Justices on the court. ... We're going to be working around the clock with Republicans in 
the Senate to move that nomination forward and fill that seat before Election Day." Asked 
whether he expects to cast a vote in the event of a tie, Pence said, "As they see the caliber, 
quality, qualifications, and background of that extraordinary nominee, we have every 
confidence that we can secure a majority of votes in the Senate." 
Pence said on WABC-AMVi New York (9/22, 18K) that "it's outrageous that the Democrats 
in the Senate say that if the President does his duty under the Constitution of the United States 
to appoint a new Justice to the Supreme Court that they'll pack the court if they win the White 
House and win the Senate on November 3." 
Asked about the Democratic response on Fox Business' Lou Dobbs Tonight (9/22, 49K), 
Pence said, "The American people are tired of it, they know this is a time when we all ought to 
be focused on honoring the life and service of Justice Ginsburg, and I think the vast majority of 
the American people outside the radical left understand the responsibility the President has." 
White House Director of Strategic Communications Alyssa Farah said on Fox News' 
America's Newsroom (9/22, 896K), "We're moving forward. It looks like we have the support, 
but the big thing I would emphasize...is this isn't going to be a rushed process. These are going 
to be thoroughly vetted, highly qualified individuals, many of whom have appeared before the 
Senate beforehand and been confirmed for previous roles." Asked about the timeline for 
confirmation, she said, "While the Election Day is an important day, it's kind of an artificial 
deadline. Our priority is filling the seat with a highly qualified judge that meets the President's 
intent for what we'd like to see on the Supreme Court." 
In an appearance on Fox Business' Mornings With Maria (9/22), Chief of Staff Meadows 
said, "I think the vast majority of Americans overwhelmingly believe that it is this President's 
pick, and the vast majority that I talk to want someone confirmed before the election."
