According to Frida 's NY Post Jeffre E stein r riled to New York City "making wisecracks about his just-
ended jail stint for 
". "I'm not a sexual predator, I'm an 'offender,' " the Wall 
Street hedge fund manager told The Post. "It's the difference between a murderer and a person who steals a 
bagel," said Epstein. 
Well that's not exactly the correct analogy... 
Not onl are E stein's comments brazen, they arc arrogant and self-implicating. By telling a reporter 
Which brings me to the big question of the day. Why did Cyrus R. Vance Jr., the Manhattan D.A., allow a 
Level 3 sex offender (the most dangerous kind) to reside -- even for ten minutes -- in a house that is right next 
to Central Park and a school'? Isn't that unlailliten the housing guidelines for sex offenders? 
According to the NYPost, Epstein's Level 3 designation means that lie is at "high risk" to repeat his offense and 
poses "a threat to public safety." 
When I rang Vance (twice) to discuss Epstein's residential guidelines lie did not take my calls. 
According to a few of the attorneys who represented Epstein's victims in the civil eases, the financier never 
agreed to a psychological evaluation prior to or during his sentence, irequircusa. 
While Epstein's self-incriminating statements are published (this week he told the Post "the crime that was 
supposedly committed in Florida is not a crime in New York" -- an interesting choice of words — he continues 
to mock the law that applies to all other sex offenders who are found guilty of the same crime. 
Epstein served 13 months in the West Palm Beach Stockade and IX months under community control (a rather 
permissive version of house arrest), for groliiiilitSoliatilian 
In August of 2010, immediately following his release from "co,' : I I; 1:1:. 1/4 OM ror. Epstein returned to his 550 
million East 71st Street town house Shim 
by his former client and lonatnefliend LeslieWexner. 
Just in the last few weeks he held a house warming dinner to celebrate his release from jail and reportedly 
invited television reporters Katie Couric, Charlie Rose. George Stephanopoulus and his close friend, HRH 
Prince Andrew. according to the NY Post. 
You would think these professional television reporters would have done their homework prior to accepting his 
in% itat ion no matter how desperate they were to rub elbows with Prince Andrew.
According to a 5

 counts of stifutory 
rape, and child sex trafficking. 
Court documents in that case 
e routinely sought out girls as young as 14 and paid them $200 to.. 
$1,(00 for sexually explicit 
his homes in Palm Beach, Fla., and Manhattan. 
In the New York sex-offender database. Epstein isn't registered tinder a tip code rather a "name search" option 
that does not list his New York address. 
The reason for this is because Epstein's Upper East Side home is considered "temporary" and by NY state law, 
he is required to provide only his permanent address to the database. 
Epstein is currently listed under his Florida home even though he is no longer a Florida resident either MEM 
arrest lie immediately became a US VI resideth), but then again who's keeping count?
