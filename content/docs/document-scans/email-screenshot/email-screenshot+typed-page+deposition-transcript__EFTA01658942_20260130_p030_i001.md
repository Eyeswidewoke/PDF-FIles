On CBS' 60 MinutesVI (11/8, 10.22M), David Martin interviewed Gen. Gus Perna, chief 
operating officer of Operation Warp Speed. Perna said, "We literally built the team, this 
collaboration, as we were going. There was no doctrine. There was no strategy. There was no 
structure of people to this end." Martin added, "Perna tracks progress in what he calls deep 
dives...with leaders from the military and the Department of Health and Human Services and 
he does not want to hear happy talk." Perna: "It's not about, you know, a fagade of everything 
is good. we need to understand what is not right, and we need to get it right." The rest of the

With Divided Government, Biden Could Use Executive Actions To Influence Economy. 
The New York Times (11/8, Rappeport, Smialek, Swanson, Tankersley, 18.61M) reports 
President-elect Biden's efforts to address "a weak economy weighed down by the resurgence of 
the coronavirus, millions of Americans still unemployed and businesses struggling and 
shuttering as winter bears down," could be "complicated if Republicans maintain control of the 
Senate." But, "as President Trump has demonstrated time and again, Mr. Biden has the power 
to pull some levers unilaterally, without congressional approval, and could influence the federal 
government's economic policymaking machinery through an array of executive actions, 
regulations and personnel changes." The Times lists "some of the ways a Biden presidency 
could unilaterally influence economic policy." 
NYTimes Analysis: Biden Economy May Be Similar To Obama's. The New York 
Times (11/8, Irwin, 18.61M) reports in an analysis that the economy under President-elect 
Biden "appears likely to show uncanny similarities to the 2011-to-2016 Obama economy." When 
Biden takes office in January, the economy "is likely to be slowly recovering from collapse. The 
Senate will probably be in the hands of Republicans," who may be "unwilling to embrace the 
kind of multi-trillion dollar spending agenda that could generate a Biden boom. This 
combination would mean that the Federal Reserve would be left playing the dominant role in 
trying to propel an economic recovery, with the downsides that would entail." The Times adds 
while "much about that forecast is uncertain," the "reaction to the election in financial markets 
in recent days suggests that something like the Obama recovery is more likely: in short, a long 
slog back to health." 
Biden May Take Proactive Role In Stimulus Talks. 
The Washington Post (11/8, Viser, 14.2M) reports President-elect Biden "may take a more 
proactive role in coming weeks in congressional negotiations over an economic stimulus 
package." 
Biden Likely To Overturn Trump Order On Diversity Training. 
USA Today (11/8, Guynn, 10.31M) reports President-elect Biden's Administration is likely to 
overturn a Trump Administration executive order "that restricts the federal government and its 
contractors from offering diversity training that President Donald Trump labeled 'divisive' and 
'un-American:" USA Today says Trump's order "had an almost immediate chilling effect on 
reinvigorated efforts to address racial disparities in the workplace after the death of George 
Floyd. ... Critics say the executive order was a broadside against diversity and inclusion 
programs seeking to reverse patterns of discrimination and exclusion going back decades." 
Tropical Storm Eta Approaches South Florida. 
On ABC World News TonightVi (11/8, story 6, 1:05, Llamas, 4.21M), Victor Oquendo reported 
Tropical Storm Eta is "battering south Florida after crashing into Cuba." While Oquendo said the 
storm is "packing winds of up to 65 miles per hour, expected to strengthen into a hurricane 
before slamming the Florida Keys later tonight," Major Garrett said on the CBS Weekend News 
Vi (11/8, story 9, 0:20, 1.44M) that the storm "is expected to be just shy of hurricane strength
