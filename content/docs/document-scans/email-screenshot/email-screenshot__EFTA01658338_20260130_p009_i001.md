here to do ... That's why I'm here," and Johnson replied, "You're here to answer my questions." 
The Examiner said the exchange was "one of several instances on Tuesday during which 
Democrats asked Barr probing questions about his conversations with Trump and conduct as 
attorney general but did not allow Barr to offer a response." 
Department of Justice spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said on Fox News' Hannity (7/28, 535K) 
that she found it "particularly ironic" that "the Democrats were hurling their usual allegations at 
the attorney general, insisting that he was helping President Trump and helping President 
Trump's friends when in fact the only political pressure that I saw today was that from the 
Democrats towards the Attorney General as they berated him for not going harsher on Roger 
Stone, a first-time nonviolent offender, which as we saw when the Attorney General made the 
recommendation that he did, the judge in that case who is no friend of this Administration, 
ultimately agreed with the AG. So, if we are going to talk about political pressure that's where it 
was at." 
McEnany: Democrats' Criticism Of Barr Is Rooted In His Probe Of "Russia-gate." 
White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said on Fox News' Fox & Friends (7/28, 831K), 
"The real problem that Democrats have with Attorney General Barr is he's actually taking 
Russia-gate seriously, this bogus sham effort that was launched against President Trump when 
he was just a candidate and went into his Administration. The fact that Bill Barr is looking into 
why Obama Administration spied on Trump campaign is their real problem." 
Barr Says Bash Investigating "High Number Of Unmaskings" During Obama 
Administration. 
The Washington Times (7/28, Mordock, 492K) reports that in testimony before the House 
Judiciary Committee Tuesday, Attorney General Barr "revealed...that he's appointed another 
U.S. attorney to investigate requests by top Obama officials to 'unmask' President Trump's 
former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn." Barr "said he's asked John Bash, the U.S. 
attorney for the Western District of Texas, to look into the unmasking requests." Barr told the 
panel, "I've asked another US attorney to look into the issue of unmasking because of the high 
number of unmaskings and some that do not readily appear in the line of normal business." 
Barr "said that review will be independent of Connecticut U.S. Attorney John Durham's 
investigation into the origins of the Russia-collusion investigation." Townhall (7/28, Pavlich, 
177K) reports that Barr "reconfirmed" that Bash is investigating the unmaskings. 
A Wall Street Journal (7/28, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) editorial lauds the 
investigation and argues that Americans deserve a full accounting of the FBI and Justice 
Department's intervention in the 2016 election.

Memo Reveals Federal Agents Sought Role In Suppressing Protests Since Start. 
The New York Times (7/28, Al, Kanno-Youngs, Olmos, Baker, Goldman, 18.61M) reports that 
"from the earliest days of the recent protests against police brutality and racism, some top 
federal law enforcement officials viewed the demonstrators with alarm and called for an 
aggressive federal response that two months later continues to escalate." A memo from FBI 
Deputy Director David Bowdich dated June 2 "demanded an immediate mobilization," declaring 
the situation "a national crisis," and said that in addition to investigating "violent protesters, 
instigators" and "inciters," bureau leaders should collect information with "robust social media 
exploitation teams" and examine what appeared to be "highly organized behavior."

USA Today (7/28, Behrmann, 10.31M) reports, "Nearly two-thirds of Americans support the 
recent protests against racial injustice, a new Gallup poll released Tuesday revealed." The poll
