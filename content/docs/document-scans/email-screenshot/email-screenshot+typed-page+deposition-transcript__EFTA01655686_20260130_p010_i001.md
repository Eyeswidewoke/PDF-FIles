WAKA (CBS-8) (02/25, Staff Writer) reported that the FBI has issued a warning that Chinese cyberterrorists, known 
as "Ghost", are targeting Americans using malicious software to steal data and shut down computers. According to 
the article, the attack exploits vulnerabilities in outdated software, such as Adobe and Microsoft, and can be 
prevented by keeping software up-to-date and backing up important files. The article noted that the FBI specifically 
warned that religious organizations, hospitals, schools, and small to medium-sized businesses are particularly 
vulnerable. KOB (NBC-4) (02/25, Tucker) and WRDW/WAGT (CBS-12) (02/25, Tucker) also reported on the story.

FBI Looking Into James Comey's Off-The-Books 'Honeypot' Operation Targeting 2016 Trump Campaign 
The Washington Times (02/25, Picket) reported that FBI leadership is starting an investigation into the origins of 
the agency's plan a decade ago to infiltrate the campaign of presidential candidate Donald Trump using two female 
undercover "honeypot" agents. The off-the-books investigation, launched in 2015 by FBI Director James B. Comey, 
was revealed by an agency whistleblower in a protected disclosure to the House Judiciary Committee last year. In 
the intelligence community, a honeypot commonly refers to an undercover operative, usually a woman, who feigns 
sexual or romantic interest to obtain information from a target. According to the article, the whistleblower said two 
female FBI undercover employees infiltrated President Trump's 2016 campaign at high levels and were directed to 
act as "honeypots" while traveling with President Trump and his campaign staff. The Times has learned that the 
Bureau, now led by Director Patel and Deputy Director Bongino, is looking for those once-undercover employees 
under Comey's direction. According to the whistleblower disclosure, the investigation differed from Crossfire 
Hurricane, a later FBI counterintelligence operation that looked into never-proved allegations that the campaign 
was colluding with Russia. The article quoted the whistleblower's disclosure, who said, "The case had no 
predicated foundation, so Comey personally directed the investigation without creating an official case file in 
Sentinel or any other FBI system. The FBI has multiple methods of protecting highly sensitive investigations, so 
Comey did not have a legitimate reason not to officially create an official investigation file or have a file number." 
The article stated that the investigation was eventually closed because a major newspaper obtained a photograph 
of one of the undercovers and was about to publish it, but the FBI press office told the outlet that the photograph 
was an FBI informant who would be killed if the photograph was publicly released. In fact, it was a photograph of 
the FBI undercover employee. The FBI whistleblower employee noted in the disclosure that one of the undercovers 
agreed to be transferred to the CIA so she would not be available as a potential witness. The article added that the 
other undercover employee was rewarded for her activities through a promotion in the Bureau and is now a high-
level FBI executive in a major field office. The whistleblower employee observed one or more employees in 
the FBI being directed to never discuss the operation with anyone ever again, including other people involved in 
the 2016 Trump campaign infiltration operation. The FBI employee making this disclosure took this admonishment 
as a direct threat to the employees who received it. Daily Mail (02/25, Spiering), Daly Wire (02/25, Saavedra), 
Washington Times (02/25, Staff Writer), Newsmax (02/25, Koutsobinas), and Breitbart (02/25, Weibel) also 
reported on the story. 
Top GOP Senators Call On DOJ to Investigate Potential Criminal FBI Leaks to Media 
The Washington Times (02/25, Picket) reported that two senior Senate Republican lawmakers called on Attorney 
General Pam Bondi and Director Patel to investigate potential criminal leaks to the media of sensitive and classified 
information ahead of the 2024 presidential election. Sens. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) and Ron Johnson (R-WI) also asked 
Bondi and Director Patel to investigate former Assistant Special Agent in Charge Timothy Thibault and his 
associates' potential breach of FBI information sharing policies. According to the GOP lawmakers, legally protected 
whistleblower disclosures have revealed that Thibault shared sensitive, non-public investigative information from 
his FBI email account with a private citizen with whom he was romantically involved. The article quoted the 
senators, which wrote, "The FBI repeatedly lectures Congress, without any legitimate basis, that it can't share
