wSJournal: WTO Proposal To Remove Vaccine Patent Protections Would Be Theft. 
In an editorial, the Wall Street Journal (11/19, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) argues that a 
World Trade Organization proposal, led by India and South Africa, that would relinquish patent 
protections on coronavirus vaccines would be theft against the US and European companies 
that developed them. The Journal says the proposal would ultimately repress further innovation 
in the space, making it more difficult to end the existing and future pandemics. 
Top Iranian Military Official: Any US Strike Could Spark "Full-Fledged War." 
The AP (11/19, Karimi, Gambrell) reports that Hossein Dehghan, "an adviser to Iran's supreme 
leader who is a possible 2021 presidential candidate," is "warning that any American attack on 
the Islamic Republic could set off a `full-fledged war' in the Mideast in the waning days of the 
Trump administration." The AP says Dehghan "struck a hard-line tone familiar to those in Iran's 
paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, a force he long served in," and "warned against any American 
military escalation in Trump's final weeks in office. tA limited, tactical conflict can turn into a 
full-fledged war,' he said." 
NBC Nightly NewsVi (11/19, story 7, 0:50, Holt, 5.84M) reported, "A new report out from 
the UN today confirms Iran is breaching the rules of the international nuclear agreement. It 
says Iran is stockpiling a much higher amount of enriched uranium than agreed to." However, 
International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Rafael Grossi "is urging America not to 
consider military action." Grossi said, "I would hope there would never be a time for a military 
attack." 
McKenzie: Refugee Camps Are Breeding Ground For ISIS. 
The AP (11/19, Burns) reports that on Thursday, Marine Gen. Frank McKenzie, Commander of 
US Central Command, warned that "although the Islamic State extremist group is battered and 
scattered, it cannot be fully defeated until the world finds a way to reconcile and resettle the 
thousands of people displaced by years of war in Iraq and Syria." According to the AP, McKenzie 
"said there is no military means of solving the problem of Mideast refugees and internally 
displaced persons, or IDPs, who await repatriation or resettlement and represent what he called 
an unfortunate byproduct of armed conflicts." McKenzie, speaking to the National Council on 
US-Arab Relations, said, "The systemic indoctrination of IDP and refugee camp populations who 
are hostage to the receipt of ISIS ideology is an alarming development with potentially 
generational implications."
