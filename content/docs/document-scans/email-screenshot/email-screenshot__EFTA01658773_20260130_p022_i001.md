According to McClatchy, "The two non-parties in the now-settled civil dispute between Maxwell 
and accuser  
had until Nov. 5 to oppose the way their names would be 
redacted as well as references that might identify them," but "in a filing late Tuesday in New 
York by 
lawyers to U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska, they said no opposition came in 
against t e re ease of documents as proposed. A one-week eriod was to allow Maxwell lawyers 
to respond had there been opposition, ending Thursday. 
attorneys would then have 
had until Nov. 19 to respond. Instead, it appears the release of more documents is imminent." 
Sen. Whitehouse Criticizes FBI For Lack Of Transparency In Kavanaugh Sexual 
Assault Probe. 
National Review (11/10, Evans, 731K) reports, "Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D., R.I.) 
slammed the FBI for not investigating sexual assault allegations against Justice Brett 
Kavanaugh, during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Tuesday." National Review adds, 
"The hearing itself was organized by Committee head Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) to interview 
former deputy FBI director Andrew McCabe regarding the origins of the Crossfire Hurricane 
investigation. However, Whitehouse criticized the Republicans on the committee for not looking 
into other allegations of wrongdoing involving the FBI and Justice Department. 'We have what 
appears to have been a tanked FBI investigation into the Kavanaugh hearings, and I've asked 
questions about that, to which I've had no answer whatsoever,' Whitehouse said. 'We're highly 
selective in what we choose to look into, and we've been extremely solicitous of the 
stonewalling and non-responsiveness of this Department of Justice." 
Ailing New York Mobster Wins Compassionate Release From Prison. 
The New York Daily News (11/11, Goldberg, 2.52M) reports, "Ailing Brooklyn mobster Gregory 
Scarpa Jr. caught a break Wednesday when a judge ended his 32-year prison stretch on 
racketeering murder charges by ordering his compassionate release." Scarpa, 69, "a former 
Colombo crime family boss turned prison snitch - he helped the government probes of the 1995 
Oklahoma City bombing and the 1993 World Trade Center bombing - is currently at a federal 
Bureau of Prisons halfway house in Kansas City, Kan., records show. 'I do not minimize the evil 
acts Mr. Scarpa committed over the course of his criminal career; wrote Brooklyn Federal Judge 
Edward Korman in ordering Scarpa's release. `The reality, however, is that Mr. Scarpa is a 
seriously ill man who is unable to care for himself and has little prospect of recidivating." 
OTHER WASHINGTON NEWS 
Media Analyses Cast Trump Legal Fight As Unlikely To Succeed. 
Coverage of efforts by President Trump and his campaign team in pursuing legal recourse in 
last week's election portrays the push as an uphill fight. On the CBS Evening NewsVi (11/11, 
story 5, 1:45, O'Donnell, 4.25M), Ben Tracy reported, "The President continues to falsely claim 
the election was rigged and that he won, today attacking on Twitter the Republican City 
Commissioner of Philadelphia who has said there is no evidence of election fraud. Al Schmidt 
says he and his election staff are now getting death threats and require police protection." 
Lester Holt said on NBC Nightly NewsVi (11/11, story 4, 2:00, 5.8M), "As the pandemic 
worsens, the White House remains focused on the election tonight, winning a hand recount in 
Georgia as it pushes other legal challenge that will likely have little bearing on the results." 
David Muir said on ABC World News TonightVi (11/11, story 4, 0:25, 6.94M) that "a number of 
judges [are] now dismissing President Trump's legal challenges to this election," and ABC's 
Jonathan Karl said, "Let me be blunt about this: None of this is going anywhere. For Donald 
Trump to win, they would either have to disqualify or change tens of thousands of votes and 
overturn the results in at least three different states."
