without having to echo his most incendiary rhetoric." But now, Pence's "relationship with 
President Trump is facing what may be the vice president's toughest challenge yet." Pence 
"must now balance his loyalty to an enraged president making baseless claims of voter fraud 
against his own political future and reputation. He also has to deal with how Mr. Trump's talk of 
running for president again in 2024 could leave him with no lane to run in." 
Fauci Discusses Challenge Of Working Within Trump Administration. 
The Washington Post (11/11, 14.2M) reports that on Wednesday, NIAID Director Fauci 
"acknowledged...that working with" the Trump Administration has been "very stressful." Fauci is 
quoted as saying, "When you have public figures like [former chief strategist Stephen] Bannon 
calling for your beheading, that's really kind of unusual. ... That's not the kind of thing you 
think about when you're going through medical school to become a physician." 
Politico (11/11, Forgey, 4.29M) reports that on Tuesday, White House coronavirus 
pandemic adviser Scott Atlas "publicly attacked" Fauci, "accusing the nation's top infectious 
disease expert of being a 'political animal' who adjusted his dire assessments of the pandemic 
after Election Day." However, Politico says Atlas "appeared to walk back his attack on 
Wednesday afternoon, tweeting that 'there will no longer be personal criticisms in the media, 
regardless of differences in policy solutions or differing interpretations of data. The common 
goal is saving lives." 
Adams Urges Mask Use, Continued Caution In South Dakota Visit. 
KSFY-TVVi Sioux Fails, SD (11/11, 1K) reported that Surgeon General Adams urged the use of 
facial coverings during a visit to South Dakota to set up a mass C0VID-19 testing event. Adams 
said, "You don't have a mask mandate here, but what I would say to the people of South 
Dakota is, you really shouldn't need a mandate to do the right thing for your community, for 
your family, and for your friends." Adams said on KCL0-TVVi (11/11, 2K), "Please, do it 
because you care about your neighbors. Don't do it because anyone else told you to do it. Do it 
because you understand the science and you know it'll keep our kids in school, keep our 
workplaces open, and get us back to normal quicker." 
On K0TA-TVVi Rapid City, SD (11/11, 3.04M), Adams said, "Unlike other respiratory 
viruses, we now know that again up to 50% of people can spread this virus without ever having 
symptoms, and one of the most effective tools we have to prevent asymptomatic spread of the 
virus is encouraging everyone to wear a face mask, encouraging everyone to practice social 
distancing. ... It is a critical moment as we see cases and hospitalizations and deaths start to 
rise." KCL0-TVVi (11/11, 2K) reported that Adams said, "Too many young people out there 
especially think that this virus is harmless. We're hearing terrible, terrible stories of even young 
people having symptoms for months, months after they contracted this virus."

Moderna's Vaccine Trial Ready To Analyze Shot's Effectiveness. 
Bloomberg (11/11, Langreth, 4.73M) reports that the "same US explosion of Covid-19 cases 
that helped Pfizer Inc. get results for its vaccine trial earlier this week is helping speed along 
Moderna's trial." Moderna "said Wednesday its study has accumulated more than 53 infections, 
allowing a preliminary analysis of the shot's effectiveness to begin." The company "didn't 
predict how long it could take an independent monitoring committee to analyze the data, but 
said the company could get the data to the committee within days." As of now, Moderna is "still 
blinded to the data."
