Former UAW President Pleads Guilty To Embezzling From Union. 
The Detroit News (9/30, Snell, 825K) reports former UAW President Dennis Williams "pleaded 
guilty Wednesday to embezzling hundreds of thousands of dollars from the union, giving federal 
prosecutors a second landmark conviction in a years-long crackdown on auto industry 
corruption." Williams' plea comes nearly four months "after Gary Jones, his successor, admitted 
to helping steal more than $1 million from rank-and-file workers." Williams "is the 15th person 
convicted of a crime following an investigation that has revealed labor leaders and auto 
executives broke federal labor laws, stole union funds and received bribes and illegal benefits 
from union contractors and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV executives." 
The Detroit Free Press (9/30, Lawrence, 1.52M) says Williams "admitted Wednesday to a 
federal judge that he suspected the money that was paying for his golf, meals and other 
goodies connected to conferences, including lengthy rental stays in Palm Springs for him and 
his friends, was bought with union funds, but he chose to do nothing despite an obligation to 
act." Williams told Judge Paul Borman, "I made a deliberate and conscious decision not to press 
the matter even though I strongly suspected that If I looked into how Gary Jones was funding 
these benefits I would find union funds were being misused. As secretary-treasurer and (later) 
as president I could have investigated into the source of these funds or directed my staff to do 
so. It was within my power and it was my duty as a UAW officer to do so, but I deliberately 
looked away." The AP (9/30) reports former UAW president Gary Jones has also been convicted.

US Charges Former California Businessman In Alleged Ponzi Scheme. 
The Mann (CA) Independent Journal (9/30, Houston, 95K) reports, "Federal criminal 
investigators this week charged a former Novato businessman of operating a massive Ponzi 
scheme, defrauding more than a thousand investors and embezzling tens of millions of dollars 
to personally enrich himself." According to the Independent Journal, "The U.S. Securities and 
Exchange Commission and U.S. Attorney's Office alleged this week that the late Kenneth Casey 
and his business associate, Lewis Wallach, were co-conspirators who intentionally defrauded 
1,300 individuals who invested in their two Novato real estate investments companies, 
Professional Financial Investors Inc., or PFI, and its associated fund, Professional Investors 
Security Fund Inc., or PISF. Casey, who died after a heart attack in May, founded the 
companies." Wallach, 64, "has served as PFI's president and CEO since 1998. He is charged

money to buy personal items such as a Malibu vacation home and luxury cars."
