Eta Expected To Make Landfall In Western Florida On Thursday. 
NBC Nightly NewsVI (11/11, story 7, 0:10, Holt, 5.8M) reported, "Tropical Storm Eta is 
churning once again to Florida, with winds up to 70 mph. Landfall is expected north of Tampa 
tomorrow, with storm surge, rain, and wind." The CBS Evening NewsVI (11/11, story 8, 1:20, 
O'Donnell, 4.25M) reported, "The storm already dropped nearly two feet of rain in south 
Florida. ... Well, now Eta threatens Florida's other coast north of Tampa." Rob Marciano reported 
on ABC World News TonightVi (11/11, story 7, 0:30, Muir, 6.94M), "Western Florida has been 
getting hit with heavy rain, surging waves, and wind all day - even some tornado warnings. ... 
Tropical storm warnings are in place along with flood watches. It moves quickly out to sea 
tomorrow, but until then, going to be a dicey night ahead." 
The AP (11/11, Anderson, Frisaro) reports, "Eta weakened again to a tropical storm 
Wednesday afternoon just hours after regaining hurricane strength as Florida braced for a 
second hit from the storm along the Gulf of Mexico coast near the heavily populated Tampa Bay 
region." Eta's maximum sustained winds "decreased to around 70 mph (110 kph) off Florida's 
southwest coast as it moved northward. Additional weakening was expected as Eta approaches 
the coast." USA Today (11/11, Hauck, 10.31M), the New York Times (11/11, Morales, 18.61M),

Trump Installing "Loyalists" As Senior Defense Officials. 
The CBS Evening NewsVI (11/11, story 4, 1:00, O'Donnell, 4.25M) reported that on 
Wednesday, President Trump "installed more loyalists at the Pentagon in the wake of firings and 
resignations among top defense officials." Correspondent Ben Tracy said the President's latest 
appointments include Anthony Tata, "a retired general who has promoted conspiracy theories, 
and Kash Patel, a former aide to Republican congressman Devin Nunes." 
The New York Times (11/11, Sanger, Schmitt, 18.61M) reports Trump "made the 
appointments of four top Pentagon officials, including a new acting defense secretary, this 
week, leaving civilian and military officials to interpret whether this indicated a change in 
approach in the final two months of his presidency." In addition to Tata and Patel, Trump 
announced Ezra Cohen-Watnick as the Acting Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence and 
Security, and Michael Ellis as General Counsel of the National Security Agency. 
The New York Times (11/11, 18.61M) says the "purge of the senior civilians at the 
Pentagon and the ascension of a similar hard-line policy official to a top job at the National 
Security Agency have prompted concerns that the Trump administration may be planning new 
punishments for Iran and releasing classified documents about President Trump's interactions 
with Russia." NBC Nightly NewsVI (11/11, story 5, 1:45, Holt, 5.8M) reported that "current and 
former US military and intelligence officials [say] it is dangerous and could help America's 
adversaries." 
The New York Times (11/11, Savage, Schmitt, 18.61M) reports the appointment of Acting 
Defense Secretary Miller "capped a stunning rise for Mr. Miller, a former Green Beret officer who 
11 months ago was a counterterrorism adviser at the National Security Council and who lacks 
significant experience managing a sprawling organization." While there, Miller attempted to 
negotiate with a Somali terrorist group, but Secretary of State Pompeo "deemed the idea half-
baked and shut it down." According to the Times, the "awkward shuttering of the effort was an 
embarrassing outcome for the US government, in part because Qatar's emir had already 
apparently given his approval to explore Mr. Miller's proposal." It "could also portend the kind of
