Focus Europe: Dark clouds. no storm yet 
Europe 
I Economics 
Dark clouds, no storm yet 
• 
Dark clouds have been gathering since the beginning of the year, but we 
do not see a storm yet. Today, Europe is dealing with an external demand 
shock and a deflationary shock. Both threaten inflation, but the latter 
boosts domestic demand, for a more balanced impact on GDP growth. 
• 
Currently the external headwinds are not yet sufficient to revise down our 
central expectation for euro-area growth, but risks are rising. 
• 
On the contrary, the inflation outlook has deteriorated. The likely 
temporary return to negative inflation rates increases concerns about a 
possible dis-anchoring of inflation expectations given that inflation has 
already been below 1% for more than two years. 
• 
A modest weakening of the data, tighter financial conditions as well as a 
more dovish Fed, BoE and BoJ increase the potential for a more aggressive 
ECB easing. It is difficult to envisage the exact policy mix that the 
Governing Council will agree upon. But after January's dovish message, 
we see another miscommunication debacle, like in December, as unlikely. 
• 
(i) We continue to see a deposit rate cut as a near certainty, but it won't be 
enough. (ii) Hence, we persist with our call of an increase in the synergies 
between the negative deposit rate, QE and TLTROs to achieve more than 
the sum of the parts and counterbalance the decreasing effectiveness of 
the FX channel. (iii) Furthermore, we think that data will have to surprise 
on the upside to avoid a temporary acceleration of the monthly QE 
purchases. Further downward surprises could lead to a temporary 
acceleration that is not compensated by lower future monthly purchases. 
• 
The ECB cannot solve structural issues. We do not think that further fiscal 
easing is the answer for euro-area peripherals due to the still high level of 
debts. Fiscal expansion in countries such as Germany would not be a 
game changer. Unfortunately the rise of populism and anti-euro sentiment 
do not bode well for the necessary further reforms and integration. The 
euro-area has strengthened, but it is not healed. 
Dark clouds at the horizon.
Dark clouds have been gathering since the beginning of the year, but we do 
not see a storm yet. Although not healed, the euro-area is in better shape than 
in 2008 or 2012. During the two earlier events, Europe was suffering large 
internal hits to domestic demand (banking crisis, fiscal crisis). 
Today. Europe is cle.aling with an external demand shock and a deflationary 
shock. Both threaten inflation, but the latter boosts domestic demand, for a 
more balanced impact on growth. 
• 
While the current domestic growth momentum appears stable, short-term 
risks to our mediocre euro-area projections (1.6% in 2016) are coming from 
outside and markets' mood is gloomy. It is a picture of perilous mediocrity:
