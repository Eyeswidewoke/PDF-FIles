Communist Party's People's Liberation Army (PLA). According to the article, the indictment claims that Wei and his 
co-conspirators hacked an American company shortly after it sued a Chinese competitor for trade secret theft, 
obtaining sensitive documents related to military and civilian communication devices. The article highlighted that 
Director Wray has identified CCP-backed cyber attacks as a significant threat to national security, noting that PLA 
hackers have been implicated in numerous high-profile breaches, including the 2017 Equifax hack and the ongoing 
"Volt Typhoon" campaign targeting critical U.S. infrastructure. The article noted that if convicted, Wei faces severe 
penalties, including up to 20 years for wire fraud and additional charges related to computer intrusions and identity 
theft. Security Week (09/17, Arghire) added that on Monday, charges against Song Wu, who remains at large, were 
announced by the DOJ. The article explained that Wu allegedly created email accounts posing as US-based 
researchers and engineers and used them to send spear-phishing messages to NASA, Air Force, Navy, Army, and 
FAA employees. The article noted that according to the indictment, Song also targeted individuals working at major 
research universities across the U.S., as well as employees at private companies in the aerospace sector. A 
DOJ press release quoted Executive Assistant Director Robert Wells of the FBI's National Security Branch, who 
stated that, "It's no secret that the threats we face today are more complex and severe than ever before," 
continuing that, "The best way — and the only way — we can stay ahead of current and emerging threats is by 
working together. With these indictments, the Disruptive Technology Strike Force is an excellent example of the 
power of partnerships in practice." FedScoop (09/17, Alder) and Security Affairs (09/17, Paganini) also provided

Walz Appointee With Apparent CCP Ties Could Expose Potential Veep's National Security Weakness, 
Lawmaker Says 
Fox News (09/17, Creitz) reported that Minnesota Governor Tim Walz is under congressional scrutiny for his 
connections to Chinese entities, with Rep. James Comer requesting information from Director Wray in August 
regarding Walz's interactions with "Chinese entities and officials" amid concerns about "elite capture" by China. 
The article explained that the controversy escalated after it was revealed that Walz appointed Chang Wang, a 
member of China's third-largest political party, to a state council, prompting Comer to declare Walz's relationships 
with Chinese officials a "national security threat." The article revealed that Comer criticized the FBI for failing to 
provide requested information about any warnings regarding CCP influence operations related to Walz, calling their 
silence "inexcusable." The article undersocred that the ongoing investigation reflects broader concerns about 
foreign influence on U.S. officials, echoing similar past issues involving other political figures and the FBI's role in 
addressing such threats.
