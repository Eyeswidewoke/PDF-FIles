The New York Daily News (11/23, Matthews, 2.52M) reports, "Prosecutors allege in the 
indictment that each of the men are members and associates of the Sicilian criminal outfit La 
Cosa Nostra, colloquially known as the mafia or mob. Prosecutors said the men operated their 
criminal enterprise beginning in August 2015 and focused their activities in Philadelphia and 
Atlantic City by allegedly working to 'reclaim territory in Atlantic City by extorting local 
bookmakers and loansharks' and trying to muscle in on the area's cocaine, oxycodone, heroin 
and fentanyl sellers. The men also allegedly threatening and assaulted numerous people who 
had been unable to repay extremely high-interest loans." 
The AP (11/23) reports from Philadelphia, "Federal prosecutors allege the crime family 
sought to use its 'reputation and influence to exercise control over criminal rackets, like 
bookmaking and loansharking, in Philadelphia and southern New Jersey, particularly Atlantic 
City."The Philadelphia mob isn't what it used to be, and thank God for that,' said U.S. Attorney 
McSwain in a statement. 'But it is still a problem and is still allegedly committing serious federal 
crimes." The AP adds, "The announcement is part of a long-running investigation involving the 
FBI, Pennsylvania State Police, the Pennsylvania office of the Attorney General, and the 
Philadelphia Police Department." 
NBC News (11/23, 6.14M) reports, "Ten of the defendants were charged with allegedly 
conspiring to conduct and participate in activities related to the mob, according to court papers. 
The remaining five were charged with other offenses, including conspiracy to extort money and 
distribute controlled substances, the indictment said." 
The Washington Examiner (11/23, Smith, 448K) reports, "A statement from the Justice 
Department said the case was being investigated by the FBI as well as local authorities. Per 
court documents, all 15 men will appear before U.S. District Judge R. Barclay Surrick on Jan. 8. 
'This group should've learned by now that the FBI is as committed to eradicating organized 
crime as wise guys are to embracing it,' Michael Driscoll, special agent in charge of the FBI's 
Philadelphia Division, said in a statement." The Daily Beast (11/23, Briquelet, 1.39M) and the 
Daily Caller (11/23, Lancaster, 716K) also report.
