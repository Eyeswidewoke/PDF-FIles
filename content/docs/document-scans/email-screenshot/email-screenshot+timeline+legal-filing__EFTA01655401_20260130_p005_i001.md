directing violent attacks that harmed numerous civilians and government officials in the Republic of Cameroon, 
with targets including a market, an annual footrace, and a Youth Day celebration," said Assistant Director Donald 
Holstead of the FBI's Counterterrorism Division in the press release. "Although these violent acts occurred outside 
of U.S. borders, these charges should underscore that criminal actors cannot hide in the United States. The FBI does 
not condone violence and will work with our partners to ensure those who engage in, or direct criminal acts are 
held accountable for their actions." 
Federal Grand Jury in Chicago Indicts Suspected Mexican Cartel Leader 
The Chicago Sun-Times (09/05, Rush) reported that a federal grand jury in Chicago indicted Oscar Manuel Gastelum 
Iribe, known as "El Musico," the alleged leader of the Beltran Leyva Organization (BLO) faction of the Sinaloa Cartel, 
on narcoterrorism, drug, and firearms charges. According to the article, prosecutors said Gastelum Iribe oversaw 
the importation of heroin, cocaine, and fentanyl into the United States while directing attacks on rivals, law 
enforcement, and military personnel to protect cartel operations. The article explained that the indictment 
designates the Beltran Leyva faction as a foreign terrorist organization and accuses Gastelum Iribe of conspiring to 
traffic drugs on a massive scale. U.S. Attorney Andrew S. Boutros said, "Today's narcoterrorism indictment of El 
Musico sends a powerful message that this administration is going to aggressively pursue transnational criminal 
organizations and hold their highest-ranking members and associates accountable for poisoning the American 
public with illegal and harmful drugs." The article noted that Gastelum Iribe remains at large, with a federal arrest 
warrant issued, and faces mandatory life in prison if convicted. "As a leader of a faction of the Sinaloa Cartel, 
Gastelum Iribe allegedly directed the importation of cocaine, heroine, fentanyl, and other lethal drugs into the 
United States and oversaw atrocious acts of violence, including kidnappings and murders, in Mexico," said Special 
Agent in Charge Reid Davis of the FBI Washington Field Office's Criminal Division in the press release. "The 
superseding indictment against him is the result of years of collaboration among multiple federal agencies and 
judicial districts. The FBI and our partners will continue to work toward dismantling the Sinaloa Cartel and bringing 
its violent leaders — including El Musico — to justice." 
Feds Want 131/2 Years for Ex-Navy Sailor Who Plotted Terror Attack at Naval Station Great Lakes 
The Chicago Tribune (09/05, Meisner) reported that federal prosecutors are seeking a 1334-year prison sentence for 
Xuanyu Harry Pang, a former U.S. Navy sailor who pleaded guilty to plotting a terrorist attack at Naval Station Great 
Lakes and conspiring with what he believed were Iranian operatives. According to the article, Pang admitted to 
taking surveillance photos and videos of the base, offering military uniforms and a phone as a detonator, and 
scouting crowded locations like Michigan Avenue and Chicago's Cloud Gate for "max damage" attacks while 
expecting millions of dollars in payment. Prosecutors said Pang also discussed smuggling weapons and radioactive 
material, including polonium, into the United States and quoted his messages with an undercover FBI operative in 
which he agreed to help avenge the 2020 U.S. killing of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani. The article explained that 
FBI investigators uncovered Pang's plans through undercover contacts posing as affiliates of Iran's Quds Force, 
leading to his arrest before any attack could occur. Prosecutors described Pang's actions as a "monstrous betrayal" 
of his Navy service and asked for 20 years of supervised release following his prison term to ensure ongoing 
monitoring of his activities. 
One of America's Most Wanted Evaded the FBI for 21 Years - Only to Be Found in Wales 
The BBC (09/07, Thomas, Fyfe) reported that Daniel Andreas San Diego, a suspected animal rights extremist and 
bombing suspect on the FBI's most wanted list, was captured in Wales in November 2024 after evading authorities 
for 21 years following two 2003 bombings in the San Francisco Bay Area. According to the article, former FBI agents 
recalled "missed opportunities" to arrest him before his disappearance, including a 65-mile chase after which 
agents found a suspected "bomb-making factory" in his abandoned car but lost track of him when he fled on foot. 
The article explained that San Diego, indicted in 2004 and considered armed and dangerous, was the first domestic 
terror suspect added to the FBI's most wanted terrorist list and had a $250,000 bounty on his head. UK 
counterterrorism police and the National Crime Agency arrested him at a remote cottage in north Wales, where he 
had been living under the alias Danny Webb. At the time of his arrest, then FBI Director Christopher Wray said: 
"Daniel San Diego's arrest after more than 20 years as a fugitive for two bombings in the San Francisco area shows 
that no matter how long it takes, the FBI will find you and hold you accountable."
