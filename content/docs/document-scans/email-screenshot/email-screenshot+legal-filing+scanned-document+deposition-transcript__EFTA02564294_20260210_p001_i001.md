Re: Candidate 
I have a third guy I just thought of. His name is sam krugman. He has been = project manager for me since 1998. He 
oversaw the construction of yhg and=every personal residential construction project I have ever had. Married. =as 
worked in the vi and in the bahamas. Might love the idea of a gig like =his. He still works for me but is under-utilized and 
might welcome an opportunity like this. He has had myriad opptys to take advantage over the year= but simply does not 
have the constitution. I like him and trust him; he c=n manage the island but can also (and simultaneously) handle any 
other ren=vation and/or repair requirements you may have on 71st, at the ranch, in p=ris, etc simultaneously. A bit of a 
hippy looking dude, but utterly reliab=e.

There is a guy named Steve Gamble. Married, two kids, but they go to school=in New Zealand I think. His wife's name is 
Diann. He was captain of my bo=t (Kaori) for quite some time. We parted on very good terms (it was time f=r him to go 
tend to some family business). Responsible, smart, trustworthy= Not a "drinker" etc etc. I recommend him highly. Not 
sure if he would co=e w/ or w/o wife, but he was married with a young kid when he worked for m= and was apart from 
them for months at a time. It's the nature of the life= A second recommendation is another guy who also worked for me 
for many year=. His name is Martin Lucas. He was captain of my first boat and the second=for a time. He then worked 
for igy for a while. He is southern baptist. Ne=er had a drink in his life. Honest as the day is long. Single, never marri=d. 
Probably around sixty-ish by now. Knows his way around the virgin islan=s socially etc very well. Trust him completely 
too. 
I would suggest meeting with each of them.
