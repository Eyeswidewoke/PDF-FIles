stay or chances of survival," though the study has yet to be reviewed. Gilead "has questioned 
the potential for bias in the WHO study, which was not 'blinded; meaning that participants and 
their doctors were aware of which treatments were being used." 
Bloomberg (10/22, Langreth, 4.73M) reports the approval also allows "Gilead to market 
the drug and talk about its benefits to doctors, nurses, and patients. That could help solidify its 
position as a go-to medicine for Covid-19 patients even as other drugs for the disease begin to 
reach the market." 
USA Today (10/22, Rice, 10.31M) reports that Gilead Chief Medical Officer Merdad Parsey 
said the drug has approvals or authorizations in around 50 countries. 
The New York Times (10/22, Levenson, 18.61M) reports the FDA's announcement 
"indicated that the drug had cleared more rigorous regulatory hurdles involving a more 
thorough review of clinical data and manufacturing quality since it was given emergency 
authorization in May." FDA Commissioner Hahn said in a statement, "Today's approval is 
supported by data from multiple clinical trials that the agency has rigorously assessed and 
represents an important scientific milestone in the Covid-19 pandemic." The Times says that 
though "the drug did not go through an outside panel of experts, called an advisory committee, 
before being approved," Center for Science in the Public Interest President Peter Lurie "said that 
was not unusual." 
The Wall Street Journal (10/22, Walker, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) reports that prior 
to the pandemic, Gilead sought to test the drug's efficacy in treating other strains of 
coronavirus, including MERS. 
Azar Dismisses Report Of Tensions With Hahn. 
HHS Secretary Azar was asked on CBS This MorningVi (10/22, 2.09M) about a Politico report 
alleging tension between himself and FDA Commissioner Hahn. Azar said, "Commissioner Hahn 
and I speak almost every day, we have a very close productive relationship, and we're working 
together. As I have made very clear and the Commissioner has made clear, the FDA will make 
the decision whether to approve therapeutics or vaccines according to their science, data, 
regulatory, and legal standards. Those calls will be made ultimately by the top career officials at 
the FDA and I 100% support that approach." 
Azar: New CDC Guidelines On Close Contact A "Call To Action." 
Asked on CBS This MorningVi (10/22, 2.09M) about updated guidance from the CDC, HHS 
Secretary Azar said, "We in the past had said that to be a close contact of somebody who might 
be infectious, you needed to have 15 minutes of continuous, unbroken contact with them within 
six feet. Now the caution is that...if you have iterative interactions within that six feet, even if 
it's not 15 minutes unbroken, that you might also be a close contact. What this means is, it's a 
real call to action to reiterate: wash your hands, watch your distance, and when you cannot 
watch your distance, wear your face coverings." 
FDA Advisory Committee Debates Safety, Efficacy Standards For Vaccine. 
The Washington Post (10/22, McGinley, Johnson, 14.2M) reports that vaccine experts on 
Thursday "rigorously debated the Food and Drug Administration's planned standards for 
clearing a coronavirus vaccine quickly for broad use, discussing what level of evidence would be 
sufficient to establish safety and effectiveness." The FDA advisory committee, "in an all-day 
virtual meeting, did not consider any specific vaccine," and instead sought "to try to reassure 
the public that any vaccine will be held to a high standard, not the relatively low bar used this 
year for emergency use authorization for treatments." 
Calling the meeting "an usual step," the AP (10/22, Neergaard, Perrone) reports Dr. 
Marion Gruber, director of FDA's vaccine research office, told the advisers that public scrutiny "is 
critical to build trust and confidence" in whichever vaccines emerge.
