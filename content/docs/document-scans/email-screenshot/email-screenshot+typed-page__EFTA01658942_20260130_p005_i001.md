Response To Lafayette Demonstrations. 
The Hill (11/6, Beitsch, 2.98M) reports, "U.S. Park Police email traffic during the June protests 
at Lafayette Square shows that agency officials were unaware which law enforcement agencies 
were assisting with the heavily criticized government response as demonstrators were 
overwhelmed by chemical irritants." The redacted emails were disclosed on Friday "as part of a 
Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request from watchdog group Public Employees for

Park Police lacked a full "list of every law enforcement agency that had arrived to assist." The

balls."
