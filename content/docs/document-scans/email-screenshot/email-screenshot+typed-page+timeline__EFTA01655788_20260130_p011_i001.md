A Large Us Health Care Tech Company Was Hacked. It's Leading to Billing Delays and Security Concerns 
The Associated Press (02/29, Bose) reported that healthcare providers across the country are reeling from a 
cyberattack on a massive U.S. healthcare technology company that has threatened the security of patients' 
information and is delaying some prescriptions and paychecks for medical workers. The hack could also disrupt 
discharging people from the hospital, a major hospital association said. According to the article, Change Healthcare 
announced Thursday that a ransomware group that had claimed responsibility for the attack was at fault. Change 
Healthcare also said it is assessing the impact of the attack, which it first acknowledged on Feb. 21 and has affected 
billing and care-authorization portals across the country. The article added that the company said its investigation 
determined that Change Healthcare, Optum, UnitedHealthcare and UnitedHealth Group systems have been 
affected. Change also confirmed Thursday that ransomware group ALPHV, or Blackcat, made the breach. The article 
noted that an FBI spokesperson in Tennessee said he could not confirm or deny whether the FBI is investigating. 
The FBI also said it's "aware of this incident" but didn't have anything else to provide because the incident "is 
ongoing." Reuters (02/29, Satter, Bing, Wingrove), UPI (02/29, Cunningham), and CBS News (02/29, Sganga, Triay) 
also reported on the story.

ransomware strain on target networks. The advisory is part of an ongoing stop-ransomware effort by the two 
entities working in collaboration with the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC). It is 
similar to several alerts they have issued in recent months on particularly pernicious ransomware threats. The 
article added that with previous advisories, the latest one includes indicators of compromise that security and IT 
administrators can use to quickly spot and respond to potential Phobos infections.

Trump to Stay on Illinois Ballot as He Appeals Jan. 6 Ban 
Bloomberg (02/29, Willmer, Larson) reported that an Illinois judge has extended a hold on her previous decision to 
bar Donald Trump from the state's primary ballot due to his involvement in the January 6 Capitol riot, allowing 
Trump to remain on the ballot while the appeal process unfolds. According to the article, this procedural win for 
Trump delays any immediate impact on his candidacy until after the appeal, with a similar case in Colorado possibly 
being resolved by the US Supreme Court first. The article explained that the Supreme Court's review of the 
Colorado ruling, which also disqualified Trump under the 14th Amendment for his actions related to the Capitol 
riot, could set a precedent affecting Trump's eligibility in other states. Additional reporting on the story was
