activities and ends its nuclear programs. ... Today's actions will continue to allow for 
humanitarian transactions to support the Iranian people." 
The New York Times (10/8, Verma, 18.61M) reports critics, however, "said the new 
sanctions were unlikely to achieve the Trump administration's goal of forcing Iran back into 
negotiations - both to limit its nuclear program and to end its hostilities across the Middle East 
- and would further distance the United States from key European allies." 
Iranian Human Rights Advocate Freed Amid Health Concerns. 
The Washington Post (10/8, Berger, 14.2M) reports, "Prominent Iranian human rights advocate 
Narges Mohammadi was released from prison late Wednesday after authorities commuted her 
10-year sentence amid ongoing concerns about her health." The Post says "semiofficial Iranian 
news agencies reported her release after 81/2 years behind bars," though "officials cited by 
Iranian media did not elaborate on why her sentence was shortened." Mohammadi "suffers from 
neurological and lung diseases, which put her at high risk of complications if infected with the 
novel coronavirus." 
Trump's Troop Withdrawal Pledge Contradicts O'Brien, Alarms Military Officials. 
The AP (10/8, Baldor, Gannon) reports the US military "was blindsided Thursday" by President 
Trump's "assertion that all US troops will be out of Afghanistan by the end of the year, with US 
officials saying they are not aware of such a plan and have gotten no actual order to accelerate 
the more gradual pullout they've been executing." Trump "started with a tweet Wednesday 
saying 'we should have the small remaining number of our BRAVE Men and Women serving in 
Afghanistan home by Christmas," and "he reinforced early withdrawal plans Thursday morning, 
in a Fox Business Channel interview that understated the number of troops currently in 
Afghanistan." His announcements, which the AP says were "welcomed" by the Taliban, "alarmed 
Pentagon and State officials who fear that putting a definitive date on troop withdrawal could 
undercut negotiations to finalize a peace deal between the Taliban and the Afghan government." 
According to Reuters (10/8, Ali), President Trump's "abrupt vow to bring home troops 
from Afghanistan by year-end is a sign of how he may feel increasingly unchained to push 
through a foreign policy 'wish list' he hopes could appeal to voters, current and former officials 
say." The President's announcement "caught the National Security Council, State Department 
and Pentagon by surprise, according to three US officials, and they fear that it could reduce the 
limited leverage the Afghan government has in talks with the Taliban." The Washington Post 
(10/8, Ryan, DeYoung, 14.2M) similarly says "the Pentagon indicated it had received no orders 
to alter plans for a conditions-based withdrawal and Afghan negotiators voiced concern that a 
hasty exit would intensify challenges to peace talks." 
Politico (10/8, Seligman, 4.29M) says that with his comments, Trump "managed to 
undercut his own national security adviser," Robert O'Brien, "who just hours earlier said the US 
planned to draw down to 2,500 troops by early next year." Politico adds that "a senior 
administration official, asked about the conflicting timelines, noted on Thursday that 'POTUS 
really laid down a marker yesterday." Also on Thursday, White House Deputy Press Secretary 
Brian Morgenstern said on KTRH-AMVi Houston (10/8, 16K), "The President has been actively 
working and his negotiators, of course, of the Department of Defense and the National Security 
Advisor Robert O'Brien have been working very hard to make sure that the conditions on the 
ground, especially in Afghanistan, are such that we can bring troops home safely, we can 
reduce our footprint there. ... That's just one step that he is taking to take care of our veterans 
and our troops." 
Military Parade Could Include Showcase Of New North Korean Weapons. 
The Wall Street Journal (10/8, Martin, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) reports a North Korean
