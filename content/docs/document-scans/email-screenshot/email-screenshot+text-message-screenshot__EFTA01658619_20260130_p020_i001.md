Judge Keeps Alive Effort To Unseal FBI Files On Jeffrey Epstein. 
McClatchy (9/22, Hall, 19K) reports, "A federal judge on Tuesday kept alive a citizen 
muckraker's quest to pry loose for the public's benefit tens of thousands of FBI documents 
about disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein, including his time as a government informant." 
According to McClatchy, "Self-styled public information crusader Angela Clemente sued in May, 
seeking to force the FBI to release the documents on the grounds that Epstein is now dead, 
albeit under mysterious circumstances, and that there is an overarching public interest in 
releasing documents. The Justice Department, representing the FBI, is fighting the effort." In a 
status hearing on Tuesday morning, Judge Trevor N. McFadden, "who sits on the U.S. District 
Court for the District of Columbia, allowed Clemente's public-records lawsuit to continue. But he 
also put both sides on notice that he expected some agreement when they come before him 
again on Oct. 23."

Media Analyses: GOP Has Votes To Replace Ginsburg; "Momentum" Favors Lagoa. 
Following Tuesday's announcement by Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT), media reports are indicating 
Republicans seem poised to proceed with replacing the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. In its 
lead story, for example, NBC Nightly NewsVi (9/22, lead story, 3:15, Holt, 5.78M) reported 
"Republicans appear to have the votes they need," and that while Democrats are "calling foul," 
they have "no path to stop it." NBC's Peter Alexander added that "consensus is forming that the 
White House will push the Senate to confirm a nominee before the election." ABC World News 
TonightVi (9/22, story 3, 3:15, Muir, 6.19M) also reported "Senate Republicans [are] now 
signaling that they have the votes," and the CBS Evening NewsVi (9/22, story 4, 2:00, Cordes, 
4.31M) that "the GOP drumbeat to act fast grew louder" Tuesday. President Trump, added CBS, 
"will meet with one of his top contenders, Judge Barbara Lagoa, in Florida on Friday." 
The Washington Post (9/22, Gearan, Kim, Dawsey, Costa, 14.2M) reports "Democrats are 
largely powerless to stop the GOP from confirming whomever Trump picks," and USA Today 
(9/22, Wu, Fritze, 10.31M) that "Democrats acknowledged they can do little to delay the vote," 
with Senate Minority Whip Durbin telling reporters, "You can slow things down but you can't 
stop them." 
Reporting on the "two women who top the President's short list," the CBS Evening NewsVi 
(9/22, story 5, 1:35, Crawford, 4.31M) said "they are both federal appeals court judges, solid 
conservatives. They're both mothers and Catholics but different demographics. Amy Coney 
Barrett has been the front-runner." She "worked for Justice Antonin Scalia as a law clerk and 
religious conservatives support her because they believe she would be a vote to overturn Roe V. 
Wade, and that made her appeals court hearing pretty contentious." CBS added that "there's 
growing momentum behind...Lagoa." 
Bloomberg (9/22, Dennis, Litvan, 4.73M) quotes Romney as saying, "The historical 
precedent of election year nominations is that the Senate generally does not confirm an 
opposing party's nominee but does confirm a nominee of its own. ... I intend to follow the 
Constitution and precedent in considering the President's nominee. If the nominee reaches the 
Senate floor, I intend to vote based upon their qualifications." The Los Angeles Times (9/22, 
4.64M) reports Romney also said, "My liberal friends have over many decades gotten very used 
to the idea of having a liberal court. And that's not written in the stars." To the Washington
