Highlights from Analyst Day 
Rod. 7*Niii,:re. 
Taking the gloves off 
INTC's analyst mtg began with the Chairman stating that to his personal 
embarrassment the co had "lost its way". We believe this powerful admission 
was a positive first step toward INTC returning to growth, with the new CEO's 
aggressive stance toward entering new mkts further supporting this strategic 
change. While successful execution on this strategy remains paramount, we 
believe INTC can return to growth in 2H14/15 as the PC mkt stabilizes and 
share gains emerge in tablets, phones, foundry etc. Even incremental success 
in these areas should yield above consensus rev/EPS and a rising share price. 
Reiterate Buy rating and raise P/T to $28. 
Manufacturing advantage underpins
 
product success 
Despite some initial yield issues, Intel believes it can scale transistor costs at 
14nm and drive a significant gap between itself and the leading foundry. We 
believe the lower transistor cost will enable the company to better compete in 
lower priced segments of the PC, tablet, and eventually the smartphone 
market. The company outlined goals to boost share in entry level PC from 50% 
today, ship 40m tablets SoCs (+400% y/y), return to "double digit" growth in 
DCG, and drive growth in the convertible PC category. 
Trim estimates on revised 2o1a guidance 
Intel guided 2014 revenue to be flat y/y as growth DCG is offset by a decline 
PCG. GM is expected to be flat as lower startup charges is offset by increased 
spending on tablets. The company committed to keep opex flat but we are 
disappointed the company did not rationalize investment given another year of 
flat/declining revenue. We note Intel investment since 2006 has far outpaced 
revenue growth (page 5). We view the guidance as potentially conservative 
but trim our above-consensus 2014E from $55.6b(+5.7% y/y)/$2.15 to 
$53.4b(+ 1.5% y/y)/$2.00. 
Raise; PIT m $.2a 
Our $28 PIT is based on an EVIS of 2.3x our 2014E revs, a —10% discount to 
the five-yr avg (2.5x). This PIT equates to a P/E of -14x our 2014E EPS, well 
below large cap semi peers (16x) but in-line with the S&P500 multiple (14x). 
Our P/T is further supported by the co's -4% dividend yield and high GM. 
Downside risks include: slower PC/Server growth and lower ASPs for MPUs & 
flash memory.
