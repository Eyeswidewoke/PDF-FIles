US Charges Former Indiana Lawmaker, Gaming Executive In Campaign Donation 
Scheme. 
The Franklin (IN) Daily Journal (9/30, Doerflein, 49K) reports, "Local businessman and 
politician Brent Waltz - a former Johnson County Council member and state senator 
representing parts of the county — was indicted Tuesday and linked to a campaign donation 
scheme stemming from his unsuccessful congressional run in 2016. A gaming executive was 
also indicted and linked to the scheme." A federal grand jury "charged Waltz and gaming 
executive John Keeler with violations of federal campaign finance laws, false statements and 
falsification of records, for making illegal corporate contributions and conduit contributions to 
Waltz's congressional campaign." 
Hawaiian Defense Contractor Arrested For CARES Act Fraud. 
Honolulu Civil Beat (HI) (10/1) reports, "A politically connected defense contractor in Hawaii 
was arrested and charged Wednesday by the U.S. Justice Department for allegedly bilking the 
federal government out of $12.8 million in coronavirus relief aid meant to help small 
businesses." Martin Kao, 47, "is the CEO of Martin Defense Group, formerly known as Navatek 
LLC, a Honolulu-based company that over the years has received millions of dollars in federal 
contracts, primarily to design state-of-the-art ship hulls for the U.S. Navy. He's charged with 
bank fraud and money laundering for falsifying loan applications for the Paycheck Protection 
Program that was created by Congress as part of the $2 trillion CARES Act meant to stave off 
financial ruin for individuals and businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic." 
CYBER DIVISION 
FBI, CISA Warn Voters On Election-related Cyberattacks. 
The Washington Examiner (9/30, Soellner, 448K) reports voting information could face 
"blockades from cyberattacks aimed at slowing down election-related, public-facing websites, 
according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure 
Security Agency." Distributed Denial of Service attacks "could hinder voter access to sites 
regarding information on the voting process or even voting results but would not prevent actual 
voting." The attacks would prevent users "from accessing those online resources and could 
temporarily disrupt business activities." The joint warning reads, "The public should be aware 
that if foreign actors or cyber criminals were able to successfully conduct DDoS attacks against 
election infrastructure, the underlying data and internal systems would remain uncompromised, 
and anyone eligible to vote would still be able to cast a ballot." However, neither "the FBI nor 
CISA found evidence that a DDoS attack has ever prevented a registered voter from casting a 
ballot or compromised the integrity of ballots that have already been cast." 
Anthem Settles Data Breach Probe By State AGs For Nearly $40M. 
Reuters (9/30) reports, "Anthem Inc said on Wednesday it would pay $39.5 million as part of a 
settlement with U.S. states attorneys general following an investigation into a massive cyber-
attack at the company in 2015." Reuters adds, "The second largest U.S. health insurer said a 
state sponsored criminal group had perpetrated the attack, adding that it does not believe the 
company had violated the law in connection with its data security. Anthem said it has also 
undertaken commitments that align with its ongoing focus on protecting information." According 
to Reuters, "In February 2015, several U.S. states began a probe after the company disclosed 
that unknown hackers had penetrated a database with some 80 million records. Anthem had 
said it suspected the hackers had stolen information belonging to tens of millions of current and 
former customers as well as employees."
