The Cincinnati Enquirer (8/27, Balmert, 223K) reports, "Former Ohio Speaker Larry 
Householder faces 162 violations of state campaign finance laws in connection with allegations 
of a nearly $61 million bribery scheme." On Thursday, Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose 
"referred the alleged violations to the Ohio Elections Commission. Most violations are connected

candidates in 2018 and 2020." 
The Cleveland Plain Dealer (8/27, Caniglia, 895K) reports, "Steve Arndt says he 
remembers the conversation clearly: A lobbyist for FirstEnergy Corp. told Arndt, then a member 
of the Ohio House, that he needed to sponsor a bill to help a FirstEnergy subsidiary. The 
lobbyist, Arndt said, gave him an ultimatum: Put your name on the bill or your political future is 
over. Arndt refused," and "later, he suffered through a negative campaign, fueled by what he 
believes was dark money, that hit his district of Ottawa and Erie counties with fliers and radio 
ads, attacking his record as a Republican legislator. 'They wield a very heavy hand,' Arndt said 
of Akron-based FirstEnergy and its affiliates. 'They have a lot of political might. [Former House 
Speaker) Larry Householder and FirstEnergy are of the same ilk. They'll do whatever they have 
to get the job done:"
