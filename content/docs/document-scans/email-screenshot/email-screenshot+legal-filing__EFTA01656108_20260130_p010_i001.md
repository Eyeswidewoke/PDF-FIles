Child,' 
Fox News (11/20, Norman) reported that the leader of a preschool in Washington, D.C., is now facing a federal 
charge for allegedly directing an undercover officer posing as a father "to abuse his child," the Justice Department

The Associated Press (11/20, Neumeister) reported that the founder of Archegos Capital Management, a hedge 
fund, was sentenced to 18 years in prison on Wednesday for securities and market manipulation fraud in a scheme 
that prosecutors said cost global investment banks billions of dollars. Bill Hwang was told the length of the prison 
term in Manhattan federal court after he told Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein that he felt "really terrible for what 
happened at Archegos," alluding to the fund's demise over three years ago. The article added that Hellerstein 
estimated that up to nine financial institutions lost over $9 billion in the fraud. At Hwang's July trial, prosecutors 
blamed Hwang and his co-conspirators, saying they artificially inflated the values of nearly a dozen stocks before
