President was beginning his briefing. Our Kyra Phillips who was in the room said she heard a 
shot fired and a senior official tells us the suspect opened fire on a non-White House employee." 
Fox News (8/10, Pappas, 27.59M) reports "the Secret Service later tweeted: 'The Secret 
Service can confirm there has been an officer involved shooting at 17th Street and Pennsylvania 
Ave. Law enforcement officials are on the scene. More information to follow." 
The Washington Post (8/10, Williams, 14.2M) reports Thomas Sullivan, chief of the 
Uniformed Division of the Secret Service, said a "51-year-old man had approached an officer 
posted near 17th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue NW around 5:50 p.m. and said he had a 
weapon." Sullivan says "the man...withdrew an object from his clothing" and "crouched into a 
`shooter's stance.' The officer shot him, striking him in the torso, Sullivan said." USA Today 
(8/10, Fritze, Jackson, Subramanian, 10.31M), the Washington Times (8/10, Al, Boyer, 492K) 
and the New York Times (8/10, Baker, 18.61M), among other news outlets, also cover the story

DO) Seeks More Time To Decide On Tsarnaev Appeal. 
The AP (8/10) reports from Boston, "Federal prosecutors said Monday that they need more time 
to decide whether to ask an appeals court to reconsider the case of Boston Marathon bomber 
Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, whose death sentence was thrown out over concerns over about the jury 
selection process." The Justice Department "urged the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to give 
prosecutors until Sept. 14 to file a petition asking the full court to hear the case. They currently 
have until Friday to file a petition for rehearing. `The process of determining whether to seek 
further review takes time, particularly in a case of this magnitude, because it requires input 
from various components within the Department of Justice. Additional time is needed to make 
the decision in this,' DO) attorney William Glaser wrote in a court filing. The solicitor general will 
make the decision, Glaser wrote." 
The Boston Herald (8/10, Tiernan, 410K) reports, "Tsarnaev's lawyers did not object, 
according to the filing. Prosecutors could be buying time to appeal directly to the Supreme 
Court, where they are likely to earn a favorable ruling faster. Legal expert Robert Dunham of 
the Death Penalty Information Center said last week the high court `has been much more pro-
prosecution." The Herald adds, "A jury convicted Tsarnaev in 2015 on 30 counts, including 
using a weapon of mass destruction and bombing a public place, for the 2013 bombing that 
killed three people and injured 260 more — something his lawyers did not debate. Tsarnaev 
was subsequently sentenced to death." 
New York Man Pleads Guilty To Attempting To Support ISIS. 
The AP (8/10) reports, "A Brooklyn man charged with trying to help the Islamic State group by 
encouraging attacks on New York's subway system pleaded guilty Monday in Manhattan federal 
court." Zachary Clark, 41, "pleaded guilty to attempting to provide material support to the 
Islamic State of Iraq. He faces up to 20 years in prison when he is sentenced on Feb. 9. Acting 
U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said in a release that Clark admitted pledging allegiance to the 
terrorist group." 
The New York Post (8/10, Feuerherd, 4.57M) reports that Clark, "who uploaded 
instructional manuals online about how to conduct lone-wolf terror attacks in New York City 
pleaded guilty Monday to attempting to provide material support to ISIS." Clark "entered the 
plea in Manhattan federal court after he was arrested last fall for posting manuals such as `Knife 
Attacks' and `Make a bomb in the kitchen of your Mom' in encrypted chat rooms designed to 
recruit new ISIS members. One of the handbooks included maps of the New York City subway 
system and writings on how to commit attacks in the Big Apple, according to court papers." 
Clark "pledged support to ISIS twice in 2019, including in July when he stated his allegiance to 
the former leader of the terror group, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, prosecutors said." 
Voice of America (8/10, 48K) reports, "Daryl Johnson, a former senior domestic terrorism 
analyst at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, said many al-Qaida affiliates around the
