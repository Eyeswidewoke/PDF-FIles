Spanish Voters Favor "Right-Wing Leader" In Regional Elections. 
The New York Times (5/5, Minder, 20.6M) reports that "Isabel Diaz Ayuso is now a rising force 
in Spanish politics" as Madrid voters "rewarded the right-wing leader of the Madrid region with 
a landslide victory on Tuesday after she defied the central government by keeping the capital's 
bars and shops open throughout much of the pandemic." According to the Times, "Ayuso's 
Popular Party more than doubled its number of seats in Madrid's regional assembly, trouncing 
other parties" and, while her party did not secure an absolute majority, it "will hold onto power 
with support from the far-right Vox party." 
The Wall Street Journal (5/5, Subscription Publication, 8.41M) editorializes that the victory 
of the Popular Party in Madrid regional elections validates the leader's relaxed pandemic policy. 
Tories, Scottish Nationalists Likely To Gain In UK Local Elections. 
The New York Times (5/5, Landler, 20.6M) reports that, in local and regional elections in the UK 
on Thursday, the Conservative Party "stands to make gains against a Labour Party that has 
struggled" to capitalize on scandals and ethical accusations involving the Tory Prime Minister 
Boris Johnson. The Times adds, "the elections could extend a realignment in British politics that 
began in 2019 when the Conservative Party won a landslide general election victory." The 
Washington Post (5/5, Booth, Adam, 10.52M) reports that Scottish Nationalists are also 
"expected to perform well," but may fall short "of a smashing victory that would pressure 
Johnson to grant another independence referendum."

Negotiations With Iran Stall Over Centrifuge Issue. 
Axios (5/5, Ravid, 1.26M) reports that according to "European diplomats and former US 
officials," talks between the US and Iran to restore the 2015 nuclear accord have stalled "over 
what will happen to the new, more sophisticated centrifuges Iran has installed" in the years 
since 2015. The centrifuges are relevant to Iran's compliance with a "'breakout time" 
requirement that mandates the country keep the time it would require "to produce enough 
enriched uranium for a bomb" to at least one year. According to Axios, while the group of 
negotiators responsible for handling this and other nuclear questions have struggled to move 
forward, another group focusing on sanctions has made "significant progress."

the AP, Rivlin "spent the day consulting with all of the parties elected to Israel's parliament and 
announced late Wednesday that he believes Lapid has the best chance of forming a coalition." 
The AP says Lapid, "whose late father was a Cabinet minister and who himself is a veteran 
journalist and politician, now has four weeks to reach a deal with potential partners." Reuters 
(5/5) reports that Lapid, "who heads the Yesh Atid party, said he aimed to establish a
