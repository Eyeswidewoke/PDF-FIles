unrest and eventually overthrow the German government, prosecutors said Friday." German 
federal prosecutors "said eight of the men, led by Werner S. and Tony E., formed the 'Group 5' 
organization during a meeting in September 2019." The other three men "were accused of 
joining later, and a twelfth suspect was charged with supporting the group." 
Local Insurgency In Mozambique Increases Allegiance To Islamic State. 
The Washington Post (11/13, Chinaka, Wroughton, Warrick, 14.2M) reports, "In the densely 
forested, oil-and-gas-rich northeast corner of Mozambique, a local Islamic insurgency has 
steadily escalated with a growing allegiance to the Islamic State and the arrival of foreign 
fighters using operational techniques similar to those from conflicts in Syria, Afghanistan and 
Iraq." Earlier this month, "insurgents decapitated as many as 50 people in attacks on several 
villages...according to Police Commander Bernardino Rafael." 
COUNTER-INTELLIGENCE 
Biden Transition, Some Republicans Critical Of Trump's Refusal To Share Classified 
Information. 
On the CBS Weekend NewsVI (11/14, story 2, 2:13, Yuccas, 2.85M), Chip Reid reported that 
Biden's transition team "says planning is proceeding but it is hampered by President Trump's 
refusal to authorize the usual sharing of classified information. Even several Republican 
senators have called for President Trump to authorize comprehensive intelligence briefings for 
the Biden team." In a statement, former White House chief of staff John Kelly told CBS News, 
"It is not about the President or about Mr. Biden. It is about America and what is best for our 
people. Mr. Trump should order the transition process begin immediately. It is the right and 
moral thing to do." 
On NBC Nightly NewsVi (11/14, story 7, 1:46, Diaz-Balart, 5.38M), Geoff Bennett said 
that with the President "refusing to concede, the Biden transition team is shut out of the 
current Administration's pandemic planning." Bennett added, "Until the Trump Administration 
formally recognizes Biden as President-elect, outgoing Trump officials can't share critical COVID 
vaccine distribution plans with the incoming Biden team." Biden Chief of Staff Ron Klain: "The 
sooner we can get our transition experts into meetings with the folks who are planning the 
vaccination campaign, the more seamless the transition from a Biden presidency to a Trump 
presidency can be." 
In a New York Times (11/13, 18.61M) op-ed, Susan Rice, a member of the Biden-Harris 
transition advisory board but not of the transition team, asserted that in the week 
"since...Biden's victory became clear," Trump "and his administration have taken no steps 
toward starting the process of transition. The risks to our national security are mounting." She 
concluded, "Instead of acting in the national interest to orchestrate a responsible, democratic 
transition, Mr. Trump and many Republicans are spending time sowing false doubts about the 
legitimacy of Mr. Biden's election. Tragically, but not surprisingly, Mr. Trump appears determined 
to take a final wrecking ball to our democracy and national security on his inevitable way out 
the door." 
Following Promotion, Giuliani Spreads Conspiracy Theories About Electronic Voting 
Machines. 
On NBC Nightly NewsVi (11/14, story 6, 0:23, Diaz-Balart, 5.38M), Kelly O'Donnell reported 
the President's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, "tells us he'll be taking over the litigation team 
after another Trump adviser contracted COVID." O'Donnell added Giuliani "says he'll be filing 
additional actions in the coming week," although "so far nothing the Trump team has put 
forward provides enough evidence to overturn the Biden result."
