<=iv>Just landed in NY. Will call as soon as I can. We are going to hire a P= firm to help with the latest articles. I also 
need to hire a lawyer to ma=e sure everything I say is OK, but I'm sick of not saying anything. l&=39;ve written down a 
few thoughts on the plane: I'm sure it'= too much info, but here is first draft. 
I vehemently deny any allegations that I so cal=ed "helped procure" prostitutes for JE. I used to be an executiv= assistant 
who scheduled appointments for Mr E.; some of these appointment= were for massages. I was never privy to what took 
place during those mass=ges. I never had anyone complain to me that something untoward was happeni=g, nor did I 
ever witnesses anything questionable take place. I had never =een any of these masseuses before until they arrived at 
the house of their=own accord; they certainly did not look underage to me. I knew nothing abo=t them. I never spoke to 
them other than to schedule massage appointments.=l'm sorry if these women now regret their actions and professions, 
but=l had nothing to do with it. I'm sure the allure of making millions of= their regrettable decisions is enticing, 
especially when their lawyers ar= willing to work for free to make a name for themselves. I have been unfai=ly victimized 
by these lane Does, whom I don't even know who they are,=their lawyers, and by the media making up endless lies 
about me and making=up outrageous allegations all because I followed the advice of my lawyers =o plead the Fifth for 
every single question asked of me, even a que=tion as simple as "what is your name?" I plead the Fifth on, in = civil suit 
which I was subpoenaed for. I was a young woman whom all of a =udden my name was caught up in something which I 
had no involvement with. = wanted nothing more than to answer all the questions asked of me by those=unscrupulous 
lawyers, but felt it was best to follow the advice of my own =awyers to plead the Fifth; what did I know about the legal 
system? So that=#39;s what I did and am still paying the price 9 years later. I'm tire= of allowing the media to abuse me 
to sell newspapers and not defending my=elf against it. 
Tru=, I once worked for JE and lived in an apt on 
. I started my interi=r design business in 2006 while also working 
for JE. Since I couldn't =fford a separate office at the time, I used my home address for my busines= address. I no longer 
live at that address, nor have I conducted business =rom that address for many years. 
Yes, I cha=ged my last name because I wanted to distance myself from my family who di=owned me over not being the 
same religion as them. It was too painful for =e to use the same last name as parents and siblings who didn't want 
me=to be a part of their family anymore. If your family wasn't will=ng to speak to you over not wanting to be a 
Jehovah's Witness, would y=u want to keep the same last name as them?
