Re: 
Hi Jeffrey! 
how are you? 
I have just got back =rom my job :) working over hours. takes a lot of time and effort to manage=40 apartments, arrange 
my boss diary, do viewing and ect I feel =ike superwoman there :) will get super skinny soon... just like you like i= 
hehehhe. I like hard work and new experience though :) 
The company is very nice and exclusive as none of =he properties goes officially on the market all is done through special 
ag=nts and previous tenants. 
So if you will come along somebo=y that needs to rent/buy NICE apartment/PH/house(rent starts £1700-E25=000/week, 
sales depends,but there is houses something like yours on 71st f=r sale) let me know, because I was promised to get 
little %. So you would give me a chance=to earn for my school :) 
Actually i was s00000=close so close of getting in my school... 
just imagine! 
Evening. dark. Knightsbridge. quiet, most expensive houses in London a=ound. Erika and I walking together. Erika on the 
right side me on left. I =m after all day hard work going back home, Erika is going for dinner with =otential investor for 
her project. we chat and laugh. As we walk further=we see something on the right side walkway, Erika sees it first, she 
appro=ches it and picks it up... the minute she is squatting back with that myst=rious lace in her hand I see night time 
sparkles of diamonds!, 1
1 111=! it is diamond "tennis bracelet" that has best quality 53 diamo=ds in white gold!' III!! I 
and worth E20 000!!! 
I had tennis bracelet on my dream board for a year. tho=ght "one day i will have it". As I prioritize my dreams if I 
was=the one on right side of walkway and to find it I would sell it and go to =chool! 
but... i say that "everything hapends for a reason!" And i a= happy for my best friend and I think she is worth every 
diamond and even =ore! but to be honest with you I would be happier for her if I was not wal=ing down the road when 
she found it :) it put me in a lot of thinking abou= the destiny and why some people just find their dreams on the street 
and =ome have to work hard to earn it. 
At the end of the day, I have so much of none material things that I w=s blessed in life that sometimes I am angry on 
myself even to be upset abo=t it. 
And.... next evening on my way back home I =ound ES!!! so clean and new!!! that is the most valuable thing I have ev=r 
found!!! :) :) :) :) :) hehehhehehehe!!! 
that was my lesson and sign :) To tolerate and maintain good wishes in=the face of adversity requires tremendous inner 
strength. However the rewa=ds are great and will get bigger and bigger little by little for me every =ay! 
:) :) :) 
I think you are my diary for this we=k. sorry. 
I really hope you are good, healthy and happy. Life is=damn good and i believe you enjoy it! 
take careq=iv>
