Colombia Passes 1M Confirmed Coronavirus Cases. 
The AP (10/25) reports Colombia "reached 1 million confirmed coronavirus cases on Saturday, 
becoming the second country in Latin America to report that number in less than a week."

Malaysia's King Rejects PM's Proposal To Declare COVID State Of Emergency. 
The AP (10/25, Ng) reports Malaysia's king "rejected a proposal by embattled Prime Minister 
Muhyiddin Yassin to declare a state of emergency to fight a new outbreak of the coronavirus." 
In a statement, the palace said Sultan Abdullah Sultan Ahmad Shah "is of the opinion that 
there is currently no need for His Majesty to declare a state of emergency in this country or any 
part of Malaysia." The AP says Muhyiddin's plan, "which involves suspending Parliament, has 
sparked national outrage, with critics slamming the move as an undemocratic means for him to 
hang on to power amid challenges to his leadership." 
Iraqis Protest A Year After Demonstrations That Toppled Government. 
The Washington Post (10/25, Loveluck, Salim, 14.2M) reports thousands of Iraqis "took to the 
streets of Baghdad on Sunday, a year after large-scale protests over corruption and a lack of 
basic services swept Iraq and toppled the government." Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi 
"pledged that security forces would avoid the kind of harsh crackdown carried out during the 
months-long protest movement. More than 500 protesters were killed in the violence. Sunday's 
demonstrations, for the most part, stayed peaceful." 
As Peace Talks Continue, Taliban Fighters Stage Attacks Across Afghanistan. 
The Washington Post (10/25, Constable, 14.2M) reports Taliban fighters have, in recent weeks, 
"staged ground attacks and bombings in 24 of Afghanistan's 34 provinces, leaving scores dead. 
... The message of the surge is clear and coldblooded. Even as Taliban delegates continue to 
nominally participate in peace talks with Afghan leaders in Qatar, the insurgents have shown no 
intention of reducing violence. Instead, they appear out to prove they can wreak havoc 
everywhere." The Post says most Afghan observers "agreed that the violence is aimed at 
gaining advantage at the Doha talks, but some said it seemed more likely to destroy them. 
Several observers warned that the insurgents were taking dangerous risks in pushing things so 
far, and that instead of leading them to victory in battle or at the peace table, it could lead to 
chaos." 
Trump Announces Sudan Will Recognize Israel. 
President Trump on Friday announced Sudan will join the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain in 
normalizing relations with Israel. While the network newscasts did not provide coverage, the 
New York Times (10/23, Jakes, Walsh, Halbfinger, 18.61M) says the deal "began with opening 
economic and trade ties," but "it appeared to stop short of establishing full diplomatic relations, 
as Israel has planned with the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain in similar agreements that Mr. 
Trump helped negotiate, as he seeks to claim foreign policy achievements ahead of the Nov. 3 
election." 
The AP (10/23, Riechmann) reports Sudan is "the third Arab state to do so as part of U.S.-
brokered deals in the run-up to Election Day." The AP also says Sudan has "agreed to put $335 
million in an escrow account to be used to compensate American victims of terror attacks," 
including "the 1998 bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania by the al-Qaida 
network while its leader, Osama bin Laden, was living in Sudan. In exchange, Trump notified
