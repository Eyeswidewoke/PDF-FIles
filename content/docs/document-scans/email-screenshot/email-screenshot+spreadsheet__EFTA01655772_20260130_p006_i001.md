The Washington Examiner (02/15, Kaminsky) reported that Rep. Mike Lawler (R-NY) questioned Treasury 
Undersecretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Brian Nelson during a House Financial Services Committee 
hearing about why the Treasury Department has not investigated ActBlue for fundraising for an anti-Israel group 
accused of being linked to terrorism. According to the article, the inquiry followed a request by Rep. Darrell Issa (R-
CA) to the FBI and Treasury Department to review ActBlue Charities Inc.'s activities after reports emerged of the 
platform facilitating fundraising for the Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel, which 
is associated with the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions National Committee. The article noted that despite Issa's 
letter sent on September 21, 2023, asking whether ActBlue raised funds for international terrorism and requesting 
a review, Undersecretary Nelson indicated he was not aware of any such review being conducted.

COUNTERINTELLIGENCE 
Speaker Mike Johnson Forced to Delay House Vote on Controversial Surveillance Tool After GOP Mutiny 
Threats 
Fox News (02/15, Elkind) reported that Speaker Mike Johnson had to postpone a House vote on renewing Section 
702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) after a group of GOP lawmakers, led by members of the 
House Intelligence Committee, threatened to derail the legislation over concerns with an amendment proposed by 
Rep. Warren Davidson. According to the article, this amendment, which aimed to require a warrant for accessing 
U.S. citizens' communications and location data under FISA, was deemed "germane" after last-minute changes to 
the bill's text, raising concerns that it would undermine FISA's effectiveness as a national security tool. The article 
noted that the controversy over the amendment and the process by which the bill was altered led to a delay in the 
legislation, with House leadership needing to address these concerns before Section 702 expires on April 19. The 
article added that Rep. Darin LaHood agreed that FISA needed reforms and defended his panel's work on the 
matter but insisted the warrant aspect could hinder efforts to prevent threats to Americans. He said the 
committee's proposed emphasis on more transparency and oversight of the FISA court would "help remedy these 
problems and puts us on the best path forward to protect national security, and secondly, to hold the FBI 
accountable." 
Key Points of AP Report Into Missed Red Flags Surrounding Accused U.S. Diplomat-Turned-Cuban Spy 
The Associated Press (02/15, Goodman, Mustian) reported on the arrest of Manuel Rocha, once a U.S. diplomat, 
now charged as a Cuban spy since the 1970s. According to the article, this was a revelation initially met with 
disbelief even after a defected Cuban officer warned former CIA operative Felix Rodriguez in 2006, who then 
informed a skeptical CIA. The article explained that the FBI, involved in the investigation post-arrest, discovered 
Rocha had been closely tied to Cuba's intelligence agency since a trip to Chile in 1973, with Rocha's actions, 
including his interference in Bolivia's presidential election to aid a Castro ally, being scrutinized as acts of 
espionage. The report highlighted the missed opportunities and red flags that allowed Rocha to evade detection for 
decades, including a tip to the CIA in 1987 about a "super mole" within the U.S. government, potentially referring 
to Rocha, now considered a significant oversight by the FBI and other agencies, which have declined to comment 
on the ongoing case.

CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS 
Special Counsel Who Questioned Biden's Memory to Testify at House Hearing 
The Associated Press (02/15, Groves, Tucker) reported that House Republicans will hold a public hearing next 
month with the DO1 special counsel who found evidence that the president had mishandled classified information 
when he was out of office but who also concluded that criminal charges were not warranted. The article added 
that the House Judiciary Committee, chaired by conservative firebrand Rep. Jim Jordan, (R-OH), will hold a hearing 
with special counsel Robert Hur on March 12, according to two people familiar with the plans who spoke 
anonymously to discuss the yet-to-be-announced hearing. The article stated that the committee has spearheaded 
much of the House GOP's investigations into Biden, including the effort to impeach him. While that effort has 
floundered, Republicans want to hear from Hur after his report last week offered an unflattering assessment of 
Biden's competency and age. Fox News (02/15, Singman), the Guardian (02/15, Staff Writer), Axios (02/15,
