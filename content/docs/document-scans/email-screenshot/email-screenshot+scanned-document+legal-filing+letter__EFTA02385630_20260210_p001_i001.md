Re: 
Thank you, Jeffrey! This is from Noam, right? I would be very interested =n reading the responses of linguists and 
computational language =odelers to this. 
May I forward it to a friend at Google X? 
Some notes: 
> basic assumptions about human language that should I think be =ncontroversial, extensively discussed elsewhere, then 
turning to a =ample of challenges. A person's language is an internal =ystem, part of human biology, based on 
configurations of the brain, =eveloping in each person through interaction of specific biological =ndowment (the topic of 
UG — universal grammar in contemporary =erminology), external environment, and general properties and =rinciples of 
growth and development that are independent of language. = 
As far as I understand, there is not yet an agreement among linguists =rt. UG, i.e. how much is innate vs. do humans just 
converge on the =implest type 3 grammar that is consistent with the constraints they =bserve in their local environment. 
I think Noam argues that we have =ery specific circuitry for language, whereas the other camp would =uggest that we 
are general learners, with specific rewards that bias us =owards compositionality and systematicity. OTOH, this might 
also be =ead as a variant of Noam's "Strong Minimalist ThesisQ=9D (SMT). 
The controversy will be eventually resolved by progress in building =ystems that learn natural language. 
> The acquired system is an "internal language" =I-language), a computational system that yields an infinite array of 
=ierarchically structured expressions that are interpreted at the =onceptual-intentional CI interface as, in effect, a 
"language =f thought" (LOT), and that can be externalized to one or =nother sensorymotor system, typically sound. Also 
relevant are some =onsiderations about evolution of language. 
> Little is known about the evolution of cognitive faculties, a matter =iscussed in an important article by Richard 
Lewontin, whose own view =or the prospects was dim 
Most folks in cognitive science would probably agree that most cortical =ctivity is devoted to building a generative 
simulation of the outside =orld by a process of hierarchical learning. These simulations can be =apped on a conceptual 
manifold, something like an address space of our =ensory motor representations of the world, which we can use to 
evoke =nd shape our mental simulations. Language is our interface to that =onceptual space, and external language 
allows us to synchronize =oncepts even in the absence of matching sensory motor representations, =.e. we can build 
mental simulations of things that we never =xperienced, by interpolating between concepts that address mental 
=imulations we know. 
It seems that Noam's approach is unique in that he focuses =ntirely on language and concepts, while treating the 
understanding of =he underlying cognitive faculties as hopeless, while many others would =rgue that understanding 
language without first understanding =re-linguistic mental representations might be impossible. 
That said, Noam's characterization of I-language and LOT at the =E24140conceptual-intentional" interface, with an 
=xternalization through generative mechanisms, is probably a useful =asis, regardless of where individual researchers 
come from.
