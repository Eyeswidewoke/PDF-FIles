Jeffrey, 
The visit to Farnborogh England was well warranted I think. PremiAir=20 Aviation is the broker listing the Bell 430 For 
Sale,. Brokers name is Crai= Lamiman,. 
Static inspection of the engine compartment and cockpit panel was i= great condition, no visible leaks and cockpit 
indicated the 1660 total time=is within reason, as you can see in the photos below. 
The only area that indicates non-operation or age, are the Wheels and brakes. 
Here is the information on the owner of this Bell 430,.and its current=20 statue: 
Owners name is Mick Bailey, a Real Estate developer in Ireland,. He=20 ran low on money and parked the Helicopter at 
PremiAir Aviation in BlackBus=e airport in England in 2009, to be stored in hanger and engines where to b= run every 
month. Mick Bailey has accumulated an outstanding invoice for=20 maintenance of 65,000 lbs sterling, and 15,000 lbs 
sterling for hanger=20 to date owed to PremiAir Aviation and is unable to settle his invoice until=the helicopter sells. For 
this reason, Mr Bailey wants to sell the helicopter, =quot;As is, Where is" basis, since he can't afford to chance not 
closing. =A0Craig told me Mr. Bailey owns the Helicopter free and clear. 
Just a note, PremiAir houses and manages the Queens Helicopter, an Agusta 109, They supposedly got rid of their 
Sikorsky 576C=+ according to Craig Lamiman the Broker at PremiAir,. I included a photo of t=e maintenance shop at 
PremiAir which was most impressive, PremiAir is a Bel= 430 authorized repair facility. I spoke in great lengths with Ray, 
PremiAir=ff39;s Bell 430 expert, who was very knowledgeable and has taken care of this helicopter since 2009,.he 
personally runs and logs the engines runs every m=nth. 
The Queens Helicopter is also based at PremiAir Aviation, just to show you the caliber of operation PremiAir Avaiation 
is,. 
PremiAir wants this helicopter sold, and they are going to push Mr Bai=ey to pay his invoice or put a lien on the 
helicopter, so Craig the Broker is = little on our side. PremiAir is in contact with a vessel shipping company t= obtain a 
firm price to ship to Miami if you are interested in this purchase= Chuck emailed me quote of $55,000 to ship to 
Savannah Ga, which is nearest port of arrival for RoRo vessel shipping, same place we brought our=Bell 407 from UK. I 
will acquire a firm price for Port of Miami arrival, unless we comply with airworthy items at PremiAir to make helicopt=r 
airworthy before shipping, 
-The helicopter has an interesting window shade system, which is electric window tint, it acutally worked well today. you 
push a button next to the window frame and it tints the window from Clear to=20 dark tint. It is an old school design 
that was quit expensive when it was f=rst introduced, and acts as a noise damper for interior noise levels. 
interior recap: 
- Wood is an 8 out of 10 great condition 
- the seat belts and air outsets are antique brushed bronze, almost ex=ct to our S76C++ 
- paint is 8 out of 10, very good quality paint job 
- leather seats are 3 out of 10, needs new leather 
- headliner is perfect, not change needed
