Edge Question 
BTW, here's the final version of the essay that I wrote for =rockman's edge question... inspired in part by our 
=onversations. 
THE EDGE QUESTION-2015 
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT MACHINES THAT THINK? 
You can't think about thinking without thinking about thinking =bout something. —Seymour Papert 
What do I think about machines that think? I guess it depends on what =hey're supposed to be thinking about. I am 
clearly in the camp =f people who believe that Al and machine learning will contribute =reatly to society. I also think that 
we'll find machines to be =xceedingly good at things that we're not -- things that =nvolve massive amounts of data, 
speed, accuracy, reliability, =bedience, computation, distributed networking and parallel processing. 
The paradox is that at the same time we've developed machines =hat behave more and more like humans, we've 
developed educational =ystems that push children to think like computers and behave like =obots. It turns out that for 
our society to scale and grow at the speed =e now require, we need reliable, obedient, hardworking, physical and 
=omputational units. So we spend years converting sloppy, emotional, =andom, disobedient human beings into meat-
based versions of robots. =uckily, mechanical and digital robots and computers will soon help =educe if not eliminate the 
need for people taught to behave like them. 
We'll still need to overcome the fear and even disgust evoked =hen robot designs bring us closer and closer to the 
"uncanny =alley," in which robots and things demonstrate almost-human =ualities without quite reaching them. This is 
true for computer =nimation, zombies and even prosthetic hands. But we may be approaching =he valley from both 
ends. If you've ever modified your voice to =e understood by a voice-recognition system on the phone, you understand 
=ow, as humans, we can edge into the uncanny valley ourselves. 
There are a number of theories about why we feel this revulsion, but I =hink it has something to with human beings 
feeling they're =pecial — a kind of existential ego. This may have monotheistic =oots. Right around the time Western 
factory workers were smashing =obots with sledge hammers, Japanese workers were putting hats on the =ame robots in 
factories and giving them names. On April 7, 2003, Astro =oy, the Japanese robot character, was registered as a resident 
of the =ity of Niiza, Saitama. 
If these anecdotes tell us anything, it's that animist religions =ay have less trouble dealing with the idea that maybe 
we're not =eally in charge. If nature is a complex system in which all things Q=93 humans, trees, stones, rivers and 
homes -- are all animated in some =ay and all have their own spirits, then maybe it's okay that =od doesn't really look 
like us or think like us or think that =e're really that special. 
So perhaps one of the most useful aspects of being alive in the period =here we begin to ask this question is that it raises 
a larger question =bout the role of human consciousness. I think human beings are part of = massively complex system --
