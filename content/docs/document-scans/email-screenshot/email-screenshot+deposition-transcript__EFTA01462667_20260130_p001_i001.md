Jeffrey 
I like the Greek recovery story, i like Alpha Bank among the banks there and I 
think the 3.5yr call warrants issued a year ago which have very little time 
value priced in and priced close to intrinsic, are the best way to buy the 
stock and the broader story. 
Background 
1. Greece experienced a worse recession than the Eurozone. The wage and 
unemployment adjustments have been far more severe than the Eurozone. Greece's 
economy is showing signs of return to growth over the next year. IMF forecasts 
0.6% GDP growth 2014 and faster growth than broad Eurozone from 2015+. 
2. In the short term bank asset quality continues to deteriorate. NPL is 35, 
double the rate of Italy and > 3x that of Spain 
3. Greek banks raised eur50bn in 2013 to recapitalise losses from Greek Govt 
bond PSI (private sector involvement). The sector is now 35-70% state owned. 
Greek Banks 
Presently Greek banks rank as some of the least profitable in Europe (ROA 
<0.5%, ROE 2-2.5%). Looking forward to 2018 they should trade at least in line 
with European banks. Sector consolidation, NC asset disposal, rapidly 
declining cost of wholesale funds and efficiency savings will all contribute 
to that. The Sector comprises Alpha Bank, Eurobank, Nat Bk of Greece and 
Piraeus. The are no longer distressed and trade broadly in-line with European 
peers in terms of EPS and TBV multiples. 
Alpha Bank (ALPHA GA) 
Of the three, Alpha Bank looks the most interesting. It trades at a discount 
to the others and has less complex re-structuring. A recent capital raise 
increased CT1 to 12%. Most analysts prefer Alpha Bank to its peers for these 
reasons.

Warrants 
A year ago the bank issued 4.5year call warrants, exercisable every six months 
into the stock at a price schedule (appendix A) that varies over time 
the relationship between the warrant (which settles physically) and the stock 
price is: 
(current stock price (0.69) - next exercise price of warrant (0.4686)] x 
leverage ratio 7.408 = intrinsic warrant px = 1.64. 
Now, the warrant is offered at 1.83. The value here is that the difference 
between 1.83 and 1.64, in my view, doesnt compensate for the optionality you 
get holding the warrant compared to just holding the stock.

Were the stock to rise 10% over the next month the warrant would rise in value 
from 1.83 by approx 22%. Conversely if the stock were to fall the warrants 
would also fall - but its unlikely the warrant price trades at zero anytime 
soon due to the 3.5years of remaining time value. 
The warrants are quoted several thousand up ltick wide on exchange.
