Reuters (10/22, Layne) reports Walz "announced that he had activated the Minnesota 
National Guard as a `precautionary step' following the ruling, which he said marked 'a positive 
step in the path toward justice for George Floyd." Cahill also "upheld a manslaughter charge 
against Chauvin and all six charges against three other officers - Thomas Lane, J. Alexander 
Kueng and Tou Thao - for allegedly aiding and abetting Chauvin in the murder. Kueng and Lane 
helped hold Floyd down by restraining his back and legs, Cahill noted, while Thao kept a group 
of bystanders at bay." 
The New York Times (10/22, Ismay, 18.61M) reports that the ruling "came in response to 
a motion by lawyers representing Mr. Chauvin and three other former officers to dismiss all 
charges against them for lack of probable cause." Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said 
in a statement, "This is an important, positive step forward in the path toward justice for 
George Floyd, his family, our community, and Minnesota." Prosecutors also "announced charges 
against a truck driver who drove a fuel truck through a protest on a bridge in Minneapolis six 
days after Mr. Floyd was killed" on Thursday. Bogdan Vechirko "was charged with a felony count 
of threats of violence and a gross misdemeanor count of criminal vehicular operation." 
The Washington Post (10/22, Bailey, 14.2M) reports that the Floyd ruling is the first "in a 
series of major decisions expected in the case," as Cahill considers "whether the men will be 
tried together, as prosecutors have requested, or separately, as the former officers want. 
Defense attorneys have also requested to move the trial out of Hennepin County, questioning 
whether it is possible to seat an impartial jury in Minneapolis and citing security concerns in a 
city that was rocked by days of civil unrest after Floyd's death and remains deeply on edge." 
The Post says Walz acted "on a request from Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey" in the activation of 
"100 Minnesota National Guard troops" and state patrol officers. 
The Minneapolis Star Tribune (10/22, 1.04M) reports "Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey 
requested support from the guard 'out of an abundance of caution and for the sake of 
preparedness,' spokesman Mychal Vlatkovich said." The Tribune says "Cahill's rulings Thursday 
are his most significant pretrial decisions since he was assigned the case this past summer," 
resolving "issues that had some activists worried Floyd's death would go unheard in the court 
system like many previous cases of police killing Black civilians. And they quelled some fears 
that Minneapolis would once again erupt in protest, arson and looting if the former officers were 
to avoid criminal prosecution."

Protesters took to the streets today over the killing of 19-year-old Marcellis Stinnette and the 
wounding of 20-year-old Tafarra Williams. Investigators say the officer, who is Hispanic, opened 
fire, as the couple's car rolled in reverse towards him, and that the couple had fled from 
another officer earlier Tuesday night. No weapons were found in the car."
