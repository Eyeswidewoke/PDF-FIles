distancing, masking guidelines, washing your hands, or staying home if you're sick, this wave 
has the potential to become a surge." Murphy has "indicated he wants to pursue a 'scalpel' 
approach as opposed to statewide restrictions, and says he wants to work collaboratively with 
community leaders." 
Birx Praises UConn Coronavirus Response, Urges Continued Caution. 
WTNH-TVVi Hartford, CT (10/8, 81K) reported that White House Coronavirus Task Force 
Coordinator Deborah Birx gave "high marks to the University of Connecticut for its handling of a 
coronavirus outbreak" in a visit to the state. Birx said, "The kind of spread that we're seeing 
now is very different from the spread we experienced in March and April." 
WFSB-TVVi New Haven, CT (10/8, 72K) reported that Birx visited "with a warning for 
Connecticut" and "said people should follow CDC guidelines whenever they're out and about 
and they're around people they don't live with. ... That's because many people spreading the 
disease are asymptomatic." Birx said, "This is the moment to really increase asymptomatic 
testing, increase outreach to the communities." 
Birx said on 12-TVVi New Haven, CT (10/8), "All the people of Connecticut out there, 
really, if you're gathering together indoors, assume someone in that group that's outside of 
your family household that could be positive and wear your mask and continue to physically 
distance." The station reported Birx "did have encouraging words for the University of 
Connecticut, saying that the school is a model for the country in stemming the widescale 
outbreak of the virus on campus." 
Birx said on WPRI-TVVi Providence, RI (10/8, 2.22M), "What we wanted to carry for a 
message across the Northeast, that what you're doing in public is great, but we have to figure 
out how to bring that safety into the household and into any groups we bring into the 
household." 
Azar: Supplies Will Be Sufficient To Vaccinate All Americans By April. 
CNBC (10/8, Lovelace, Jr., 3.62M) reports on its website that on Thursday, HHS Secretary Azar 
"said...the U.S. could have enough Covid-19 vaccine doses for every American as early as 
March," which CNBC says is "a more optimistic estimate" than President Trump has publicly 
said. CNBC adds, "The Trump administration's coronavirus vaccine program Operation Warp 
Speed expects to have up to 100 million doses by the end of the year, Azar said during a 
keynote speech at the Goldman Sachs Healthcare virtual event on the coronavirus." Azar is 
quoted as saying that will be "enough to cover especially vulnerable populations. ... We project 
having enough for every American who wants a vaccine by March to April 2021." 
White House Deputy Press Secretary Brian Morgenstern said on KTRH-AMVi Houston 
(10/8, 16K), "Operation Warp Speed is unbelievable. ... We have a number of treatments that 
are already being used either through compassionate use or emergency use authorizations. We 
are seeing more and more treatments come to market all the time." He said, "We think there'll 
be a vaccine, we may see data at some point this month indicating that a vaccine could be safe 
and effective. ... We're confident that we can have up to 100 million doses by the end of the 
year, and then perhaps enough doses available for every American really in the early part of 
next year. So, none of this would have been possible without Warp Speed." 
Former CDC Director Urges Redfield To Stand Up To Trump. 
The New York Times (10/8, Mandavilli, Holt, 18.61M) reports former CDC Director William 
Foege "said Thursday that President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence have 'their knees on 
the neck of the public health community,' and called on" current CDC Director Redfield, "to 
stand up to them - even at the risk of getting fired." Foege said, "Silence becomes complicity 
and I think the one person that might have turned this around would be the director of the 
C.D.C. 
I think [Redfield] would level with C.D.C. employees and let them know what the
