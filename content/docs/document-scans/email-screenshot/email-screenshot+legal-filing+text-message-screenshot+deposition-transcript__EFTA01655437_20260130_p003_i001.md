IN THE NEWS 
Director Patel Says Agency Investigating 'Theories and Questions' Surrounding Charlie Kirk's Murder 
Fox News (09/21, Margolis) reported that Director Patel announced the agency is investigating "theories and 
questions" surrounding the Sept. 10 assassination of Charlie Kirk, pledging a "thorough and exhaustive" probe into 
the killing. Director Patel said the FBI is examining potential accomplices, the shooter's location, bullet trajectory, 
Discord chats, text message confessions, visitors to the suspect's residence, weapon transport, and even possible 
hand signals observed near Kirk before the assassination. According to the article, Director Patel also addressed 
speculation about a plane allegedly turning off its transponder near the assassination site, clarifying that interviews 
with the pilot and FAA showed incomplete flight data in rural areas created the apparent gap, not deliberate action. 
He emphasized that while some details are known, the FBI will not release all information publicly to protect the 
investigation and any future prosecution. The article noted that Director Patel vowed that the FBI "will not rest 
until justice is served" and confirmed the agency continues to pursue every lead to fully resolve the case. Just the 
News (09/21, Ballasy) reported that Deputy Director Bongino said the FBI is going to continue investigating those 
directly connected to the subject to find out what they knew in advance of the shooting. Additional reporting on 
the story was provided by ABC News (09/21, Forrester), Hindustan Times (09/21, Kukreti), Newsweek (09/21, 
Silverman), New York Post (09/21, McCormack), Raw Story (09/21, McAfee), The Hill (09/21, Suter), and The 
Independent (09/21, Bowden). 
'No Evidence' Found Yet of Ties Between Kirk's Shooting and Left-Wing Groups, Officials Say 
NBC News (09/20, Smith, Kosnar, et al.) reported that federal investigators have so far found no evidence linking 
Robinson to any left-wing groups despite President Trump and his allies vowing to target such 
organizations. Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff, said left-wing organizations amounted to a 
"vast domestic terror movement." He stated: "With God as my witness, we are going to use every resource we have 
at the Department of Justice, Homeland Security and throughout this government to identify, disrupt, dismantle 
and destroy these networks and make America safe again for the American people. It will happen, and we will do it 
in Charlie's name." Robinson currently faces state charges, including aggravated murder, with Utah prosecutors 
seeking the death penalty, while federal prosecutors weigh whether any charges can be brought at the federal 
level. The article explained that investigators revealed texts between Robinson and a roommate in which Robinson 
admitted to planning the attack for over a week, citing his anger at Kirk's political views as his motive. The article 
noted that the FBI, along with the Secret Service, ATF, and DHS, have also issued a joint bulletin warning of "several 
threats of unknown credibility" tied to Kirk's upcoming memorial, though no specific or credible danger has been 
identified. Additional reporting on Charlie Kirk was published by The BBC (09/19, Wendling, Sardarizadeh), CNN 
(09/19, Mascarenhas), The Daily Mail (09/21, Parnaby), NBC News (09/20, Schapiro, Blankstein), New York Post 
(09/20, Worrell), The New York Times (09/20, Healy), The Wall Street Journal (09/19, Chaffin), and NewsNation 
(09/19, Bohn, Meyer). 
AG Bondi Issues Bold Warning to Would-Be Copycats After Kirk, Zarutska Murders 
Fox News (09/21, Penley) reported that AG Bondi warned would-be copycats that federal authorities will "find you, 
catch you, and prosecute you" after the murders of Charlie Kirk and Iryna Zarutska. "Look at the work the FBI did 
with ATF on Charlie's assassination. How quickly the FBI had someone in custody for this murder, so we will find 
you, we will catch you, and we will prosecute you." She added, "I think that's a huge deterrent because I think a lot 
of people think they can get away with it, and they can't." 
Director Pate! Says He's 'Proud' to Lead FBI After Explosive Hearing 
Fox News (09/21, Pinedo) reported that Director Patel, facing heavy criticism from Senate Democrats during a 
Judiciary Committee hearing, declared he was "proud" to lead the FBI and highlighted the bureau's historic 
recruiting numbers, claiming it now has "the most applicants to become FBI agents and intel analysts in the history 
of the FBI." He defended his earlier social media post about conservative leader Charlie Kirk's alleged killer, 
admitting he could have worded it better but insisting it was issued in the name of transparency. According to the
