Nevada." The rare metal has been "used as an alloy to strengthen steel, aluminum and titanium 
in the construction, auto, aerospace and computer industries but must currently be imported -
primarily from Austria, Canada and Russia." The Bureau of Land Management "said in 
announcing plans earlier this month for the mine's expedited review that US dependence on 
foreign vanadium `creates a strategic vulnerability for both the economy and military to adverse 
government action or other events that can disrupt the supply of this key mineral." Vanadium 
has been "extracted in small amounts in the US but only as a minor byproduct of other mining 
operations, mostly uranium mines in Utah." 
Reality Winner Alleges "Dire" Conditions At Prison Facility Where Leaker Contracted 
Coronavirus. 
The Washington Times (7/23, Blake, 492K) reports government leaker Reality Leigh Winner 
"sought reprieve Wednesday from `dangerous' and 'dire' prison conditions that resulted in her 
recently contracting the novel coronavirus." Winner, an Air Force veteran and former intelligence 
contractor, "said inmates at the federal medical prison where she is incarcerated are being 
denied access to over-the-counter medication to try to fight COVID-19, the disease caused by 
the coronavirus that has infected herself and hundreds of others serving time at the same 
facility in Fort Worth, Texas." She also "said that mattresses slept on by sick prisoners 
subsequently removed from the facility, FMC Carswell, are eventually reused without ever being 
sanitized." Attorneys for Winner "propose the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals consider her COVID-
19 diagnosis and the conditions described in her declaration in determining if she has met her 
burden to show 'extraordinary and compelling' reasons exist to move forward with her request." 
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS 
Federal Judges Rule Against Maxwell's Gag-Order, Documents Requests. 
The AP (7/23) reports, "The judge presiding over the criminal sex abuse case against Jeffrey 
Epstein's ex-girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, refused Thursday to ban prosecutors or lawyers for 
alleged victims from commenting publicly." US District Judge Alison J. Nathan "said in a written 
order that she expects anyone involved in the case to exercise 'great care' to comply with rules 
designed to ensure a fair trial," but "the judge said she 'will not hesitate to take appropriate 
action' if circumstances change." Maxwell "is in a Brooklyn federal jail, awaiting trial after 
pleading not guilty to charges that she procured teenage girls, including a 14-year-old, for 
Epstein to sexually abuse in the 1990s." 
Reuters (7/23, Stempel) reports that Maxwell "suffered dual setbacks in a U.S. court on 
Thursday, as a judge authorized the release of new materials related to her, while another 
judge refused to block prosecutors and lawyers from publicly discussing her criminal case." US 
District Judge Loretta Preska in Manhattan "directed the release of large portions of more than 
80 documents from a 2015 civil lawsuit against Maxwell, the British socialite now facing 
criminal charges that she lured girls for Epstein, the late financier, to sexually abuse. These 
documents included flight logs from Epstein's private jets, deposition testimony in 2016 in 
which Maxwell's lawyers said she was asked about her sex life, and police reports from Palm 
Beach, Florida, where Epstein had a home." 
Former Pennsylvania Congressman Indicted For Voting Fraud. 
The Inquirer (PA) (7/23, Roebuck, 347K) reports former Pennsylvania Representative Michael 
Myers "was charged Thursday with new allegations that he bribed a poll worker to stuff ballot 
boxes in local elections." The indictment "alleged U.S. Rep. Michael 'Ozzie' Myers, now working 
as a campaign consultant, paid a South Philadelphia judge of elections to fraudulently add votes 
to candidates who had hired him to represent him in their races between 2014 and 2016."
