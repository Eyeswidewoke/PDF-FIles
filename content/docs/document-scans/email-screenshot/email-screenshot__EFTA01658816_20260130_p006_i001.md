Reuters (11/19) reports that Greek police arrested an IS suspect "on Thursday after a brawl at 
a migrant camp where he has been staying with his wife and children and said he was believed 
to have been involved in a number of killings." The Syrian man, "who arrived in Greece in March 
2018, was detained after an argument on Wednesday between two groups at the camp, a 
police official said." He is "accused of being a member of a terrorist group and participating in 
homicides." The man is "expected to appear before a prosecutor later in the day, according to a 
police statement." Greece "promised on Wednesday to build new reception centres for asylum 
seekers and cut the maximum stay in camps on its now-overcrowded islands." 
Watchdog: EU Relying On Treasury Department Program To Track Terror Financing. 
The Wall Street Journal (11/19, Tau, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) reports that the Treasury 
Department's Terrorist Finance Tracking Program (TFTP) has become widely used by European 
countries to monitor global financial transactions in an effort to track terror financing. According 
to the US Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, about 40% of the database searches on 
TFTP were done on behalf of EU member countries or Europol. The independent watchdog's 
chairman, Adam Klein, said, "though funded and operated by the United States, provides a 
steady stream of valuable intelligence to EU member states. ... That should be welcome news 
to every American." Klein added, "The EU has effectively deputized the U.S. Treasury to perform 
counterterrorism searches of European data."

Cybersecurity Community Worried About Political Pressure From White House On 
CISA. 
The Washington Post (11/19, Marks, 14.2M) reports, "Current and former cybersecurity officials 
fear it will be far more difficult to withstand political pressure from the Trump White House 
following a purge of its senior leadership." After the firing of former CISA Director Chris Krebs 
"and other top leaders...it could be far easier for the White House to force the agency to stop 
fact-checking phony claims about the election or to combat disinformation about other key 
issues such as coronavirus vaccine distribution." Former DHS cybersecurity operations head 
Suzanne Spaulding said, "It's going to be a challenge to overcome the chilling effect from 
having had a leader of the organization fired for telling the truth." It is rumored "Brandon 
Wales, a longtime Department of Homeland Security official with extensive experience who is 
well respected at CISA," will take Krebs' place. Spaulding said, "If Brandon Wales is allowed to 
stay in place as acting director, I think CISA is in good hands." 
Sources: Energy Official Eyeing CISA Job After Former Director's Ouster. 
CyberScoop (11/19, Lyngaas) reports, "Sean Plankey, currently a senior official at the 
Department of Energy, has in recent days contacted current and former officials at DHS to 
discuss working" at CISA following the removal of the former director, according to unnamed 
sources. The Energy official "indicated in one conversation that his move to CISA was 
'imminent,' one source said." His security clearance, "however, hangs in the balance," and its 
status "came up in the last year, prompting a review of his status as a clearance holder." It is 
"unclear if those issues have been resolved, and if Plankey still holds a clearance." Without a 
clearance, Plankey could not receive "the classified information that CISA officials draw on to 
help protect government agencies and the private sector from hacking." 
Opinion: Krebs Lost Job For "Standing His Ground." Opinion columnist David 
Ignatius writes in the Washington Post (11/19, 14.2M) that former CISA Director Chris Krebs 
"got fired for standing his ground," and his "story is a case study in how responsible officials 
who work for Trump can resist being manipulated." As CISA director, "his job was to coordinate 
security for the 2020 elections," and while the "main threat seemed to be from abroad," it 
"turned out that the real danger was at home." Krebs told Ignatius in August, "Election Day
