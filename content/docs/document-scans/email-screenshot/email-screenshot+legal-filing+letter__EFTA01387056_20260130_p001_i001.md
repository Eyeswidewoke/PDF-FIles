in so tang rejection points on KYC Case#01946825 
Let's set up a time to discuss when Brad is back next week. Some of these requests seem unreasonable, and AML should already have 
a lot of this info, particularly anything relating to Jeffrey Epstein personally (since we have so litany accounts for him). 
As for Chip's email, it predates me. And the other people on the email are no longer at DB. So I don't see how I can get hold of the 
full email. But again. Jeffrey has been through a complete rep risk process here and has been signed off on repeatedly by management 
as we've done any KYC remediation or new account opening. 
Anyway, let's regroup next week so we can go back to AML with a comprehensive set of responses. 
Thanks

Importance: High 
Hello Stewart. 
Hope you arc well!! 
I have received the following list of rejection points on KYC Casc#01946825 relating to customer - Prvtanee. LLC. 
I need your assistance in resolving below highlighted points. 
For Point 2 - As per attached constitutional doe, they (AML) are requesting to update address mentioned on Pg 11 (Royal Palms 
Professional Building address). I had updated address as per Pg 28 which is the IRS letter. Please confirm whether to keep this address 
or amend it as per Pg II? 
For Point 6 — Could you provide the email that the AML team is seeking? I only have the attached email (2nd pdf attachment) from the 
repositories. 
For Points 8 & 9 - Kindly provide SOW info for Jeffrey & Caroline. 
For Point 10 — This will be covered on Pts 8 & 9 
For Point 11— My existing comments on the DB deposit account is "the purpose of this account is to managing the monthly expenses 
of the company" as per previous KYC. Kindly advise, please? 
For Point 13 — I am unable to procure SoS for this entity from the US Virgin Islands company registry wcbsite - Department of 
Licensing and Consumer Affairs. Kindly provide this please? 
For Point 17 — Please provide the requested email. 
Rejection:1) Please add the account number for the deposit account. 
2) The address on the LLC Agreement does not match the address in the LLC Agreement. Please provide proof of address. 
3) Please expand on the nature of business. What do they do with the investment in art work? Re-sell it? 
4) Richard Kahn has been tagged as a signatory. However, as per the DB Resolution uploaded under KYC — 1704382. he is not listed 
as a signatory. If Darren is indeed not a signatory, please remove hint from this KYC. 
5) The Pierre Trust was created under the laws of USVI. Please re-run research with that country as well. 
6) Can you please locate the full e-mail chain that proves that Chip Packards approval actually refers to Epstein's jail sentence? The 
current c-mail attachment uploaded does not refer to what is actually being discuccrd.
