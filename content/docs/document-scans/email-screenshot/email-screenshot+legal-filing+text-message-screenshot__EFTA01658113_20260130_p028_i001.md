about 9,500 and 9,700, respectively. But in March 2020, it blocked more than double that 
amount: a whopping 23,692 gun sales." 
The New York Daily News (7/23, Theisen, 2.52M) reports, "The agency's figures, which 
were revealed after a Freedom of Information Act request by the advocacy group Everytown for 
Gun Safety, showed that 23,692 attempted gun sales were blocked by background checks in 
March 2020 alone. That is a dramatic increase from the previous month, which featured just 
9,700 blocks, and from March 2019, which had 9,500 blocks. The National Instant Criminal 
Background Check System, or NICS, can block Americans from buying guns for a few different 
reasons, including if they're subject to a restraining order or have been involuntarily committed 
to a mental institution," but "gun-control advocates are concerned about this huge spike in 
background checks because, with the NICS facing a significantly increased workload, more 
people can slip through the cracks in the law to buy guns when they're not supposed to." 
However, in a piece for the National Review (7/23, 731K) , David Harsanyi writes, 
"Reporters who lard up their pieces with adjectives such as 'jarring,"massive,"whopping,' and 
'raised concerns' are usually trying to convince readers of something that isn't true. And so it is 
here. Indeed, all this Politico piece tells us is that the National Instant Criminal Background 
Check System is working exactly as intended." 
LAWFUL ACCESS 
DO) Official Explains Law Enforcement's Worries About 5G. 
NextGov (7/23, Baksh) reports, "The advent of fifth generation networking architecture is going 
to make it a lot harder for law enforcement to serve and process wiretapping warrants, a senior 
Justice official said, also expressing concern about the main U.S. policy approach for competing 
with China in the space." NextGov adds, "Beyond faster connections with reduced latency, 5G is 
expected to greatly enable machine to machine communication, making for a more distributed 
system of connectivity. This promises huge potential for economic advancement, but also to 
exacerbate challenges the FBI and other law enforcement entities experience trying to 
overcome encrypted communication between devices. 'The big challenge as 5G gets 
increasingly deployed across the country,' said Associate Deputy Attorney General Sujit Raman, 
is 'let's say you serve a search warrant or a wiretap order. Where physically is that going to 
happen? Because right now, you just send the wiretap order to Verizon or T-Mobile or whoever. 
They've got a centralized server, they serve it, they create an interface and they produce the 
data. If there isn't that centralized architecture going forward, it's an engineering question, how 
do you actually make that happen?" 
Ninth Circuit Rules Against Bid For Access To Judge's Encryption Opinion. 
The Washington Post (7/23, Nakashima, 14.2M) reports that a three-judge panel of the Ninth 
Circuit Court of Appeals "this week denied The Washington Post and two civil liberties groups 
access to a lower court opinion blocking the government from forcing a tech company to break 
its encryption to help law enforcement." According to the Post, "At issue is a September 2018 
sealed opinion by a federal judge denying the government's request to compel Facebook under 
the Wiretap Act to break the encryption on its popular Messenger app so that authorities could 
monitor the calls of members of the MS-13 criminal gang." In February 2019, US District Judge 
Lawrence J. O'Neill in the Eastern District of California "denied a motion by The Post, the 
American Civil Liberties Union and the Electronic Frontier Foundation to unseal the opinion," and 
on Wednesday, the appeals panel "affirmed 0'Neill's denial."
