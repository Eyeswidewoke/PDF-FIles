State Police, Frederick County State's Attorney's Office, Frederick County Sheriff's Office and

that's up in Minnesota this year. A long-time FBI agent shared what drives thieves and bank 
robbers, and how the community helps solve these crimes." WCCO-AM adds, "Bank heists are 
glamorized in the movies with a coordinated crew of criminals like in `Oceans 11; or the 1991 
film `Point Break.' And while organized crews do exist, FBI Agent John Gainer says it's more 
common to see robbers working solo. 'We find people that are in a desperate situation is the 
typical type of person that gets involved in a bank robbery,' Gainer said." According to WCCO-
AM, "Suspected bank robbers run the gamut in Minnesota, from a range of backgrounds.
