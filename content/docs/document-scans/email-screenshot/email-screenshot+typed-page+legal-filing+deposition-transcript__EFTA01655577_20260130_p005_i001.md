New Attorney General Pam Bondi Orders Review of Dump Cases 
The Associated Press (02/05, Richer, Tucker) reported that new Attorney General Pam Bondi on Wednesday 
ordered a review of the federal prosecution of Donald Trump as she unveiled a series of directives designed to 
overhaul a DOJ the president claims is biased against conservatives. Hours after she was sworn in at the White 
House, Bondi called for the creation of "weaponization working group" that will scrutinize the work of special 
counsel Jack Smith, who charged Trump in two criminal cases. The group will also review "unethical prosecutions" 
stemming from the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol, among other things, according to the memo. The article 
mentioned that the memo satisfies the longstanding contention of Trump and his allies that the DOJ under the 
Biden administration had become "weaponized" against conservatives, even though some of its most high-profile 
probes concerned the Democratic president and his son, and there's been no evidence to support the idea that the 
prosecutions against Trump were launched for a partisan purpose. It was one of 14 directives signed by Bondi 
designed to roll back Biden administration policies and align the Justice Department with the priorities of a White 
House determined to exert control over federal law enforcement and purge agencies of career employees it views 
as disloyal. The article added that Bondi was sworn in by Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas earlier 
Wednesday alongside Trump in the Oval Office. It the first time that Trump had participated in a second-term 
swearing-in of a Cabinet member, underscoring Trump's intense personal interest in the operations of the 
department that investigated him during his first term and indicted him after he left office in 2021. Trump praised 
Bondi's record as a prosecutor and said she will restore "fair, equal and impartial justice" at the department. Bondi 
enters with the department roiled by the firings of career prosecutors and senior FBI officials, along with the highly 
unusual scrutiny of thousands of agents involved in the sprawling Jan. 6 investigation. Acting Deputy Attorney 
General Emil Bove said in a memo to the workforce Wednesday that FBI agents "who simply followed orders and 
carried out their duties in an ethical manner" are not at risk of being fired. The only employees who should be 
concerned, Bove wrote, "are those who acted with corrupt or partisan intent." "There is no honor in the ongoing 
efforts to distort that simple truth or protect culpable actors from scrutiny on these issues, which have politicized 
the Bureau, harmed its credibility and distracted the public from the excellent work being done everyday," Bove 
wrote. The Washington Post (02/05, Roebuck, Stein), NBC News (02/05, Doshi, McCulloch), the Hill (02/05,

U.S. Immigration Raids Target Illegal Immigrants in Aurora, Colorado 
Reuters (02/05, Brooks) reported that officers from several U.S. federal agencies searched for illegal immigrants on 
Wednesday in Aurora, the Colorado city with a large migrant population where President Donald Trump laid out his 
immigration policies during his campaign. Federal officials said they were targeting over 100 alleged members 
of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang with prison origins that has expanded throughout the Americas. According to 
the article, the Denver field office of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said on social media that it 
partnered with the FBI, Drug Enforcement Agency, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and U.S. 
Marshals Service to carry out the operations. Some residents say Tren de Aragua has infiltrated Aurora, a city in the 
Denver suburbs. Local officials have called assertions about Tren de Aragua's reach and activities in Aurora false 
and incendiary. On Wednesday, ICE Acting Director Caleb Vitello, speaking at the site of one of the Aurora 
operations, said in a video posted on social media the raids were taking place to target alleged gang members and 
that "as long as there are bad guys in the streets we're going to be out here arresting them." Colorado Governor 
Jared Polis, a Democrat, said in a statement his state would work "with federal law enforcement agencies in 
apprehending dangerous criminals to make Colorado safer for everyone." Polis added that he wants to see more 
transparency from the federal government about the immigration actions being taken in Colorado, in part to lessen 
the fears and uncertainty felt by immigrants. The New York Post (02/05, Taer), USA TODAY (02/05, Hughes, Jervis),
