A Wall Street Journal (8/2, Al, Hilsenrath, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) analysis of crime 
statistics among the nation's 50 largest cities found that homicides are up 24% so far this year, 
to 3,612. In total, 36 of the 50 cities studied saw homicide rise at double-digit rates. 
Along similar lines, the Washington Examiner (8/2, Dibble, 448K) reports that "crime 
statistics for the month of July painted a grim picture of Chicago as the city's murder rate more 
than doubled, with many of the victims being children." The total number of murders in July 
"climbed to 139% compared to the same month in 2019." 
In New York City, Fox News (8/2, Betz, 27.59M) reports on its website, shootings so far 
this year "have surpassed the number of shootings for all of 2019, police confirmed to Fox 
News on Sunday." There were "776 total shootings for all of 2019, according to data compiled 
by the New York Post, which first reported the numbers." 
Chicago Police: Homicides, Shootings In City Have Spiked This Year. 
The AP (8/1) reports Chicago has seen a spike in homicides and shootings over "the first seven 
months of the year." During that time frame, "there were 440 homicides in Chicago and 2,240 
people shot, including many of those who were killed, according to statistics released Saturday 
by the police department." The AP adds, "There were 290 homicides and 1,480 shootings, 
including people who were killed, in the first seven months of last year." July was particularly 
violent, with Chicago having "recorded 105 homicides and 584 shootings." 
NYTimes Analysis: First Step Act Leaves Some Prisoners With Little Recourse When 
Resentencing Applications Are Denied. 
A New York Times (8/1, Fuchs, 18.61M) analysis says the First Step Act has largely met its 
objective of lowering "federal sentences for nonviolent drug offenders, addressing a 
longstanding disparity in which crack cocaine convictions in particular led to far harsher 
penalties than other drug offenses and disproportionately increased imprisonment of Black 
men." However, "the law gives judges discretion in reducing sentences," thus resulting in some 
inmates not having a great deal of recourse when their resentencing applications are denied. 
The Times adds, "In those cases, activists and defense lawyers worry that the First Step Act 
gives too much authority to judges to determine who does and does not deserve early release." 
Democrats To Press For "Structural Court Reforms." 
The New York Times (7/31, Hulse, 18.61M) reports Democrats intend to utilize their upcoming 
"party platform to push for 'structural court reforms' to counter what they describe as a 
concerted Republican campaign to pack the judiciary with 'unqualified, partisan judges." 
However, the platform's wording does not indicate what those changes ought to be. 
Nonetheless, supporters of the plank "said the broad statement represents a significant 
advance toward beginning a conversation among Democrats about how to respond to the 
substantial imprint that President Trump and his conservative allies have made on the federal 
bench." 
Corona virus Has Courts Rethinking Jury Trial. The Washington Post (7/31, 
Marimow, Jouvenal, 14.2M) reports "many of the country's court systems are gradually 
reopening, having embraced technologies such as Zoom and YouTube to safely hold pleas, 
sentencings and even Supreme Court hearings." However, the jury trial continues to be largely 
stalled, and the Post adds that "prosecutors and the defense bar in many jurisdictions 
nationwide are racing to re-engineer" it "for the covid-19 era in the hopes of restarting the 
proceedings before the end of the year." According to the Post, "They face the tricky balancing 
act of protecting the health of jurors who are compelled by the law to serve, while also 
providing the constitutionally mandated right to a speedy and public trial to tens of thousands 
of defendants, some of whom have languished in jail for months awaiting their day in court."
