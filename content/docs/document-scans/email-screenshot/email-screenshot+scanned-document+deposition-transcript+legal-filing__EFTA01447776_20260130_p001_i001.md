Editas has become the first of the group not only to attract crossover backers, but to begin discussing 
the diseases that its targeting. Its first program, Bosley says, is a potential treatment for a form of 
leber congenital amaurosis (LCA), a genetically driven blindness. It's a different form of the LCA than 
the gene therapy company Spark Therapeutics (NASDAQ: ONCE) is targeting; Bosley says the one 
Editas is going after can't be solved by gene therapy. 
Beyond that, and Editas's ongoing immuno-oncology work with Juno, Editas has done some very 
early work in Duchenne muscular dystrophy and is exploring ways to repair a mutant hemoglobin 
gene—something that could have an impact in a range of bleeding disorders. That doesn't mean this 
is where Editas will ultimately focus—Bosley notes, for instance, that there are big technical 
challenges of producing an effective CRISPR-Cas9 therapy for Duchenne—but it's a glimpse into the 
company's thinking. 
Bosley won't estimate how long it'll be before the first Editas therapy begins human testing, noting 
that the company is in the midst of preclinical work, testing its technology in patient cells. "We have a 
little bit more work to do before we can really be explicit about a specific timeline," she says. 
Does that mean a few years? "I don't think it'll take that long," she says. "We'll move sooner than that 
if we have a construct that's good enough." 
For those new to the story, CRISPR-Cas9 is a two-part system derived from a defense mechanism 
that bacteria use to fend off viruses. Think of it as a pair of molecular scissors (an enzyme called 
CRISPR-associated protein 9, or Cas9) being carried into a cell's nucleus by a strand of RNA that 
serves as a guide (clustered, regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats, aka CRISPR). Once 
there, the scissors may be able to snip out a defective gene, and perhaps replace it with a new, 
functioning one. In the case of Editas's LCA program, for instance. Bosley says the company aims to 
make two specific cuts in two different DNA sites to eliminate the genetic mutation causing the 
disease. 
This isn't the first gene editing technique to emerge; Sangamo Biosciences (NASDAQ: SGMO) and 
its zinc finger nuclease platform have the most advanced gene editing candidate, a potential therapy 
for HIV in Phase 2 testing. But CRISPR-Cas9 has taken the medical world by storm because of how 
easy it is to use, and the broad potential it may have. CRISPR technology has already been used to 
modify the genomes of plants and animals, but that ease of use has also led to some serious ethical 
questions. One of the field's pioneers, UC Berkeley's Jennifer Doudna, and several others have 
called for a moratorium on using CRISPR-Cas9 to edit the human germline—making changes to 
sperm, eggs, and embryos that would then be passed along to future generations—and have warned 
against altering humans for non-medical reasons. 
There are also some practical concerns when it comes to using CRISPR-Cas9 for therapeutics. How 
can a therapy using this technology be delivered into the body effectively? Will it safely do its work, or 
cut DNA in the wrong places? One wrong snip—a so-called off-target effect—could cause serious 
unintended consequences, and ensuring that this doesn't happen is just one of the technical 
challenges that have to be faced before a CRISPR-Cas9 drug begins human testing. One need only
