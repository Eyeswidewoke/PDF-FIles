Re: Joi 
Dear Jeffrey, 
Here are some reflections. Of course I can only extrapolate over the =hings I get to hear and rationalize over the 
distribution, and I am not =ctively trying to solicit opinions about you. 
People reflect in the categories they know, so when they discuss you, =hey will end up putting you in categories that fit 
into their world =iew. (Which of course is also true for myself, I cannot know my blind =pots, but at least I am aware that 
I have no idea what it is like to =row up as an upper middle class Jewish boy in NYC.) 
The first sentence of your Wikipedia entry introduces you as a sex =ffender, which due to contemporary America's 
fascinating difficulty of =ealing with all things sex related establishes a strong prior on you =eing a pariah. It is also pretty 
much the only thing that people =utside of your circles know you for. Their null hypothesis will tend to =e that you 
combine the apparently suspicious trait of being wealthy =ith the apparently horrible trait of being too much interested 
in too =oung girls. 
This is a very strange contrast, because there are probably very few =ontemporary individuals that have had the same 
curiosity for and =nfluence on instigating foundational research across fields as you did. 
Once people get to know you in person and are interested in you, they =end to either compartementalize the topic (as a 
somehow difficult to =ccept aspect of an important friend), or treat it as somehow =nterestingly dark and edgy. It 
seemed to never have been met with =utright approval, and very rarely not been an issue at all, even when =t is 
balanced against your sharp, original and interesting mind. I have =eard two people call you a savant, and you appear to 
be somewhat =nscrutable and mysterious, to which the apparent darkness adds. Some =ighly moralistic Jewish 
intellectuals seem to see you as part of the =lock, but a black sheep, with relationships maintained because you are 
=oyal and reliable, but despite grave moral objections. 
The smart college student may not have had enough life experience to not =ort people into good and evil, and may have 
difficulty to assume that =ou could be anything but dangerous and corrupted by darkness. While she =ight be happy to 
accept any amount of nepotism from a female benefactor =s laudable mentorship and empowering feminism, accepting 
your support =ould have meant to join into the corruption of the darkest imaginable =otions of patriarchy. Trivers was 
faced with a similar sentiment when =e defended you publicly (even though it was to the tune of "well he did =rong and 
served a bit of time, not as much as we mortals would have, =ut still, and you should forgive him now"), and Krauss (who 
in public =nternet discussions maintained that you did nothing wrong, and took =eavy flak for it). The general public 
does not seem to be able to =nderstand how morality is constructed (which of course would defeat the =volutionary and 
social purpose of morality to keep the public in =heck), so they won't be able to see straight. 
If people are able to think outside of moralistic terms, they may simply =ark you down as an ephebophile but are bound 
to notice a few quirks. 
First of all, why did you let yourself get caught? In the German =urisdiction (and likely not just there) you may have not 
faced the same =isks, and you are good at calculating risks. Multiply the risk of a relationship to a girl getting sour or 
highjacked by an enemy by a =ufficiently large number of girls, and doom is almost certain. A power =rip? What does
