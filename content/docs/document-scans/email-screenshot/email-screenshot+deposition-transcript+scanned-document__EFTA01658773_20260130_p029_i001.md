Minnesota COVID Cases Up 125% Over Two Weeks. Gabe Guteirrez of NBC Nightly 
NewsVi (11/11, story 2, 2:00, Holt, 5.8M) said, "In the last two weeks, Minnesota has seen 
new COVID cases spike by 125%. ... Abbott Northwestern Hospital granted us rare access to 
show the pandemic's deadly impact. This hospital has 30 COVID ICU beds and right now, about 
three fourths of them are full. As we head into the winter, the concern is not just space but 
staffing." 
COVID Surging Across East Coast. On the CBS Evening NewsVi (11/11, story 2, 
1:00, O'Donnell, 4.25M), Meg Oliver said New York City's COVID positivity rate has risen to 
2.5%, and "if the city hits 3%, all schools will go remote." Oliver added, "The surge is worse in 
New Jersey; the city of Newark the hardest hit. For the next three weeks, parts of the city will 
enforce a 9:00 PM curfew, and all indoor and outdoor gatherings will be limited to 10 people. 
An urgent warning from Children's Hospital in Philadelphia recommending schools and 
businesses go all remote next week as infection rates in children are now outpacing those of 
adults in many areas of the country." 
The New York Times (11/11, Armstrong, Tully, 18.61M) reports that in Newark "over the 
last four days, there have been 842 new reported infections, and 19 percent of people tested 
over three days last week were found to have the virus, city and county officials said." The 
uptick "mirrors a troubling statewide trend that has resulted in a spike in Covid-19 
hospitalizations across New Jersey to levels not seen since June." 
Cuomo Orders 10PM Closure Of Restaurants, Bars, And Gyms Statewide. 
Bloomberg (11/11, 4.73M) reports that on Wednesday, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) 
announced that bars, restaurants, and gyms must close at 10 p.m. and "indoor gatherings" 
must not exceed 10 people. According to Bloomberg, "New York reported 4,820 additional virus 
cases, the most since April. The rate of positive tests has climbed to 2.9%. The state has 1,628 
people hospitalized for Covid, twice as many as a month ago." 
DeWine Warns Of New Restrictions If Ohio COVID Cases Continue To Rise. 
The Cleveland Plain Dealer (11/11, Hancock, 895K) reports Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine (R) -
"arguing that coronavirus cases, hospitalizations and deaths cannot continue at the current high 
levels - said he is reissuing the statewide mask order with new provisions." He "also said during 
a Wednesday evening broadcast that if cases and other trends continue to increase, the state 
will be forced to close restaurants, bars and fitness centers." DeWine's team "will look at the 
trends a week from Thursday and make a decision, he said." Ohio "is experiencing an 
exponential increase in the number of coronavirus cases: While it took over three months for 
the state to report 50,000 COVID-19 cases during the beginning of the pandemic, more 
recently the state added 50,000 cases over 13 days." 
The Hill (11/11, Coleman, 2.98M) reports DeWine also "warned on Wednesday that the 
state's hospitals could be overwhelmed with COVID-19 cases in 'just a few short weeks," 
painting "a stark picture in an address to residents, saying hospitals may not end up having 
enough staff to handle the coming winter." DeWine said, "Our health care workers are quite 
frankly exhausted. ... They've been running a marathon for nine months straight, and with this 
new wave and the onset of flu season, it's like they're starting the race all over again."

coronavirus being introduced into Ohio's Pickaway Correctional Institution, "23 inmates and 17 
staff members were found to be infected. One inmate, Charles Viney Jr., a 66-year-old with a 
collapsed lung, died hours after testing positive. Within a month, more than three-quarters of 
Pickaway's roughly 2,000 inmates were confirmed positive. By the end of May, 35 were dead." 
Pickaway, the Post says, "exemplifies the broad challenges facing the nation's jail and prison 
systems in the grip of the pandemic. Conditions long considered degrading - including
