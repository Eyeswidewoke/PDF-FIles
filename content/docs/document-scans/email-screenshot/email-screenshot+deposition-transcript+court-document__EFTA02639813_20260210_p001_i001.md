Leon, =C2 Congragulations on biting the bullet. =t least 18 months late , but I m encouraged and glad for you. = 
There is a HUGE amount of work to be done in the next 9 month=. mostly the exact same work that i outlined in my 
email of =AO 2 years ago. ( you can send it again if you like ) . Brad =echsler is a dope. . sorry, I have been sayingt he 
same thing =or a long time. he was a not a step up from eileen but a step sidewa=s. in the begiging there was eileen 
and Tom and ralph le=ner. all your hand picks. then brad. john, j=e. and threee others that i never met.. joslin wa= 
chosen from apool of 2 peopl. each that would be limited by a salar= of 250k. I did say hire both lisa to do the 
bookeeoing and jo=lin tax, 
He complained for over a year , re his directi=n by eileen and ada , and then brad. His 
breakdown was not a s=rprise after months and moths of warnings. though disabled =AO he ran your office this year. 
with john and Joe. He ran amok, and=as i told you he reminded me in most of our conversations that=you told him that 
he works for you and not for me and that brad need= to see everything becuase he pays him . 
=AO. Asking me who to hire 
I have taken heat for yea=s over the fact that i gave you no more than carlyns name, =AO. no follow up questions no 
interactions , not even a singl= question ( that was eilleen _) but somehow carlyns fuc= up was my doing. . 
when i 
told you th=t i thought eileen wasnt up to the task, you ybellowed that i was ta=king out of both sides of my mouth. . 
You to=d me this year , that by tryhing to protect you from crazy joslin, l=had in essence fired him and it was my 
responsiblity to do his work.=C2 it then turns out that he didnt consider himpself fired =t all just received less money. 
and continued to =ake a really complex mess.. Joshn castrucci, was also m= doing, though email after email said , I 
take no repsonsioity for him,=C2 i think you shouldbt hire him,  your respoinse was that was o=ly beacuse i didnt trust 
him. last jan you told me he was gone= however he too is still there, and a waste of mon=y and space. 
=C2 My time is complicated by donalds potentially eviseratin= any reason to have the foreign funds repatriation 
plan that i had p=t together. . however as you are aware I have some prett= severe decisions to make re my time in the 
next year or two. =o at least for a few weeks I am unable to commit much time and make =ny future plans to redo 
your procrastiantion produced mess.
