the judgement of an Insurer / =einsurer in determining whether to take the risk and, if so, on what =erms. If you are in 
any doubt whether a circumstance is material =e recommend that it should be disclosed. 
Disclosure will be considered fair =f it is made in a manner that is reasonably clear and accessible and =he facts 
represented are correct and made in good faith. Failure =o disclose a material circumstance may entitle an insurer to 
impose =ifferent terms on your cover or proportionately reduce the amount of =ny claim payable. In the event that 
non-disclosure was deliberate =r reckless an insurer will be entitled to avoid the polity from =nception and retain the 
premium paid. This would result in any claims =nder the policy not being paid. 
Conditions Precedent 
You must also take =articular note of any conditions precedent that appear in the =olicy. If a condition 
precedent to the validity of this policy or =o the commencement of the risk is not complied with, the insurer will =ot 
come on risk. If a condition precedent to the Insurers =iability under this policy is not complied with, the insurer may 
not be =iable for the loss in question. A condition precedent may exist =n the policy using other terminology and 
without reference to the words =E24>Qcondition precedent'. 
It is very important that you read =he full policy carefully when it is received and, if you are unsure of, =r are 
unable to comply with any provisions therein, please let Sturge =aylor & Assoc know immediately. 
Contracting Out 
Some Insurers have exercised their right to opt out of the =equirements of the new act. In the event that this 
effects the =nsurances we have placed for you we will advise you accordingly. 
We have =roduced a simple guide to help you through some of the changes within =he Insurance Act which, if 
not attached to this email it is available =n request. If you would like further information please contact =s and we will 
endeavour to help.
