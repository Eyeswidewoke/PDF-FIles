=ne of the most significant challenges the strategy identified remains a concern: the dedicated effort by some na=ions 
and groups to prevent access to parts of the "global commons&quo=; -- those areas of the air, sea, cyberspace, and 
space that no one "=wns,' but upon which we all depend. These "anti-access" strategies employ military capabilities, 
geography, diplomatic pressure, a=d international law to impede the free use of ungoverned spaces. The Air-S=a Battle 
concept -- which disrupts the so-called "kill chains" o= our potential adversaries -- is our services' approach to negate 
these efforts. 
A new form of coercion 
Nations seeking to intimidate their neighbors are turning=to anti-access strategies because they are cost-effective. 
Merely threaten=ng to close key maritime crossroads such as the Strait of Hormuz or demonstrating the ability to cut off 
a cou=try from cyberspace or international airspace can be an effective tool for=regional and international coercion. 
Similarly, these capabilities can be =pplied to prevent or slow U.S. or allied assistance from arriving in time to stop or 
repel an attack -- p=oviding an aggressor much greater leverage over neighbors who depend on al=ies for security. 
Three well-known developments made this shift in our comp=titors' strategy possible. One, the world economy has 
become more intercon=ected, so impediments at air or maritime chokepoints have a much faster global impact. Two, 
technological advances =n sensing and precision have spurred the development of more lethal air de=enses and anti-
ship cruise missiles; cheaper, more integrated surveillance=systems; and new weapons, such as anti-ship ballistic 
missiles. Improvements in automation have made thes= systems easier to use while proliferation has put them in the 
hands of a =ange of potential new adversaries. And three, the American way of projecti=g force changed from placing 
bases and garrisons close to potential battlefields to a more expeditionary stra=egy whereby a smaller overseas 
presence is supported by forces that can su=ge into the area from hundreds or thousands of miles away. 
In history there are numerous examples of anti-access cap=bilities and strategies. Field Marshal Erwin Rommel, the 
"Desert Fox,=quot; used aircraft, gun emplacements, and mines during World War II to disrupt access to France during 
the D-Day landings =t Normandy. Mines were used in the Arabian Gulf during the Iran-Iraq "=tanker war" of the 198Os to 
hinder the passage of both countries' oil= Serbian forces and Saddam Hussein each employed Cold War-era air defenses 
in an attempt to deter intervention by NATO and = U.S.-led coalition respectively. Anti-access strategies have always 
been =mployed to increase the cost of intervention beyond an acceptable level an= show potential victims of aggression 
that help is not likely to come. Today, however, anti-access capabilities =ave much greater range and lethality. And they 
are typically employed as p=rt of an overall strategy in peacetime alongside legal, diplomatic, and ge=graphic means to 
deny access even before a conflict occurs. 
Anti-access strategies also undermine our ability to stab=lize crises. Suppose an aggressor threatens to attack a country 
within ran=e of its anti-access military capabilities. If we cannot reliably defeat the aggressor's array of cruise and 
ballistic=missiles, submarines, aircraft, etc. and project power, U.S. forces will b= less able to move into the area to 
interdict attacks, reassure our allies= and defuse potential hostilities. 
The Air-Sea Battle concept 
The Air-Sea Battle concept, approved by the secretary of =efense in 2011, is designed to assure access, defeat anti-
access capabilit=es, and provide more options to national leaders and military commanders. Air-Sea Battle is one of the 
operational =oncepts nested within the overarching Joint Operational Access Concept (JO=C) -- the Joint Force's 
approach to defeating threats to access. Air-Sea B=ttle is not focused on one specific adversary, since the anti-access 
capabilities it is intended to defeat are=proliferating and, with automation, becoming easier to use. U.S. forces ne=d a 
credible means to assure access when needed to help deter aggression b= a range of potential adversaries, to assure 
allies, and to provide escalation control and crisis stability. =/span> 
Some examples of where Air-Sea Battle may apply indude t=e Arabian Gulf and Strait of Hormuz, where a favorable 
location provides l=an the ability to threaten the production and passage of almost 20 percent of the world's oil. If Iran 
can demonstra=e or credibly assert that it can prevent or slow a U.S. response to its ag=ression, it is more able to coerce
