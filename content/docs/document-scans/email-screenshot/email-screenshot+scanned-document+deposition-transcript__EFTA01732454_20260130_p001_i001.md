Leon, 
Yesterday was hou=s upon hours of my time spent,( speak to brad to get flavor) and you and = will discuss the results in 
gruesome detail on Friday. it mirrored many o=her weeks spent doing the things that I don;t have the time to do. 
In order to keep things in perspective, =AO reviewing an analogy I have used before with you, I thought might be 
he=pful. You and your family are a 6 billion dollar cor=. with income between 250 -50O million dollars per year. It 
contains=a few operating biz's , a large wide array of existing investmen=s, in various categories , a desire to enter into 
others. .a panoply=of loans, notes. purchases, wide range of taxes. =C2 , planes. boats homes.. trusts grats. a crazy 
number of=C2 bank accts. ( with no oversight ) . law firms, acct firms, 800 =age tax returns, foreign firms. art 
consultants. construction c=nsultants bill payers, home mgmt.,vast multitude of =Ic's , including foreign, and with all 
that you only have=C2 a combined overhead of less that 3 million dollars. =A0 
I have previously sent you the very same no=e that i have enclosed again below ,this time with highlights = I wrote 
it to you over a year ago. As my ac=te disability ( selective memory) seems to have been raised as =one of your 
concerns , as a rule I try to memorialize th=ngs in writing in an attempt to lay out issues that I fear may=C2 later turn 
out to be a problem. ie what i would and wouldn=#39;t do , - my responsibilities. and those things that =re not. 
including details of things that I thought needed to =e done, so that you wouldn't find yourself in the very =AO place 
where you currently find yourself. however ,you chose to de=er many of my suggestions- see below -,until only weeks 
ago. ! =you chose to defer the jpm acct. the art partnership on a=d on - into this year. and though the 60.50 40 timber 
emails all ca=ried with it a clear warning that you needed to do something re personnel=C2 if it were to stabilize,- you 
chose to wait. ( FYI the C=rlyns art partnershipthat you referenced is only similar in title. )=br> 
ONE YEAR AGO 
Feb 17 2014 i wr=te : 
With regard the more pressing issue I =m uncertain of just how to proceed. I am torn, as my very stro=g inclination is 
not to be involved at all . It is extremely time co=suming, delicate, fraught with many pitfall many that will make you 
very u=set and a major pain in the ass. I wrote you months ago that t=e quality of the people involved need to be 
upgraded. ( lucky for me=C2 these last issues arose way before the beginning of my involvement )= I am also aware 
however of my overarching friendship =AO obligations of ok, -given all the complexities who els= can do it? problem. 
Your family office needs a daddy. =AO children with good intentions are running around , sniping , nitpicking=with little 
direction. As a stopgap measure I am suggesting , we put=in Larry Delson to take charge Everyone would report to him. 
Eileen included. He=would however work for me. this is not, by a long shot my firs= choice as I prefer only being
