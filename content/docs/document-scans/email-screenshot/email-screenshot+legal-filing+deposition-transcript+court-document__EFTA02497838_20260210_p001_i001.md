Re: 
thanks, I met with misha gromov. . =if we are talking about the space of probablites and i underst=nd its only a 
metaphor. but if the information is widely dispe=sed. are their truly independent probabilites.? =AO and music is also 
probably constrained by an upper volume, =C2 i never thought of it . some limitation on sound waves interacting.=C2 
mu guess is there is an upper limit, certainly ver= loud would drown out very soft. etc. great work thanks<=r>

=div>My apologies for not responding sooner. I took an email v=cation for a week plus which turned out to be a 
mistake be=ause I fell irrevocably behind. 
That was a very f=n conversation with Noam in Cambridge: he is an amazing thinker (if a tad =nflexible at times). 
Your question about entropy =s an important one. The second law of thermodynamics tells us that<=div> 
systems go to states of high entropy where events are random and =ncorrelated, so that thermal 
fluctuations appear to be statistic=lly independent. However, if you 
look under the hood of t=e second law, you find that what is really going on is that the dynamics</=iv> that leads you to 
this high entropy state is actually generating h=ge amounts of correlations 
between the different parts of the sy=tem. 
In fact, the apparently random and independent 
fluctuations of the parts reflect large correlations with the other=parts of the system. But these 
correlations are effective=y smeared out over the whole system: to reveal the fact that they are not truly independent, 
one would have to make measurements on all the=parts together, and 
tease out the extensive but subtle correlati=ns between them. 
For example, even t=ough the apparent high entropy of a gas of molecules reflects all the correlations that are 
generated by the collisions of molecules over t=me, if one looks at just two molecules in the gas, their motions=will be 
statistically independent to a high degree of accuracy.<=div> 
On your second question, quantum su=erposition is indeed closely analogous to a chord in music: the =trangeness and 
power of quantum superposition arises out of the =nterference between the different waves in the superposition. 
<=iv>A classical computer can only register one set of logical values for it= 
bits at any given time. So a classical computation=is like plain chant: a 
single sequence of tones without in=erference. By contrast, a quantum computation 
is li=e a symphony: its power comes from the rich sequence of quantum 'chords.8<ft=9; 
There is a difference, however. The mor= waves that participate in a quantum 
superposition, the smaller =he amplitude of each wave: the sum of the 
square of the am=litudes is always 1. So unlike music, where the volume 
<=iv>can change, the total 'volume' of a quantum chord is always the sam= not matter how many tones are added. 
<=r> 
Hope these answers help.
