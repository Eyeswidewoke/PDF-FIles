The Washington Post (11/11, Fahrenthold, Helderman, Hamburger, 14.2M) reports, 
"Inside Detroit's absentee-ballot-counting center, one Republican poll watcher complained that 
workers were wearing Black Lives Matter gear. She thought one of them - a 'man of 
intimidating size' — had followed her too closely. Another Republican poll watcher complained 
about the public address system. Workers were using it to make announcements," allegedly 
making it hard to concentrate. A third poll watcher "noticed that when absentee ballots came in 
from military personnel, many showed votes for Democrats. He found that odd." The Trump 
campaign "promised 'shocking' evidence of misconduct" in Michigan as part of its litigation, but 
instead "produced 238 pages of affidavits from Republican poll watchers across Michigan 
containing no evidence of significant fraud." 
Boockvar Says Around 10K Ballots Were Received In Pennsylvania After Election 
But Before Deadline. Politico (11/11, Montellaro, 4.29M) reports Pennsylvania Secretary of 
the Commonwealth Kathy Boockvar (D) said Tuesday "that around 10,000 ballots were received 
between the close of polls on Election Day and the evening of Nov. 6 - a number far too small 
to undermine [Biden's) margin of victory in a critical battleground state." Those mail ballots 
"are at the center of a case in front of the Supreme Court" that Trump "and his allies have 
pushed for." 
Wisconsin Lawmakers Planning Subpoenas In Election Probe. The Milwaukee 
Journal Sentinel (11/11, 632K) reports, "Wisconsin lawmakers plan to issue their first 
subpoenas in decades as part of an investigation into the Nov. 3 election, even as the top 
Republican in the Assembly acknowledges the probe is unlikely to change the outcome." 
Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R) said, "I think it is unlikely we would find enough cases of fraud 
to overturn the election. I think it's unlikely, but I don't know that. That's why you have an 
investigation." 
Uncounted Votes Discovered In Puerto Rico. The New York Times (11/11, Robles, 
18.61M) reports, "Nearly 200 boxes of uncounted votes have surfaced in Puerto Rico, a full 
week after voters went to the polls to choose their governor, legislators and mayors across the 
island, dealing another black eye to the mistrusted government." The discovery "could have 
sweeping effects in close races around the island, in particular the tight contest for mayor of 
San Juan, where the sudden influx of new votes could force a recount." 
"Tens Of Thousands" Voted But Made No Choice For President. USA Today 
(11/11, Salman, Wynn, Voyles Pulver, 10.31M) looks at some of the "tens of thousands" of 
voters who made choices in downballot races but did not vote for president. A USA Today 
analysis "of unofficial results in Arizona, North Carolina, Nevada and Michigan found up to 
40,000 voters in each of these highly competitive states opted for none of the candidates listed 
on the presidential ballot by name." In 2016, 1.9% of voters made no selection for president, 
according to one study. 
Voter Fraud Decision Exacerbated Tensions Between Barr And DOJ Public 
Integrity Section. The New York Times (11/11, Benner, 18.61M) reports that Attorney 
General Barr's direction to leaders of the Justice Department's Criminal Division, "which 
oversees the Public Integrity Section, that he wanted to allow prosecutors to look into voter 
fraud allegations before the results of the presidential race had been certified" has increased 
tensions between Barr and prosecutors in the section, which were heightened during the period 
surrounding Trump's impeachment. Criminal Division chief Brian Rabbitt "pushed back," and "he 
and his staff considered the matter resolved when Election Day passed without Mr. Barr issuing 
any edict. But the attorney general concluded it was ultimately his call" in a move that 
"stunned" Rabbitt and Richard Pilger, who was in charge of overseeing voter fraud 
investigations. Pilger "stepped down from his post within hours for a nonsupervisory role at the 
department." 
NYTimes Analysis: Pence Faces "Toughest Challenge Yet." The New York Times 
(11/11, Karni, Schmidt, 18.61M) says Vice President Pence has since 2016 "walked the Trump 
tight rope more successfully than anyone else in the president's orbit, staying on his good side
