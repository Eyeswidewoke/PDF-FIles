Administration Suspicious Of China's Effort To Expand Its Influence In Caribbean. 
The New York Times (11/8, Semple, 18.61M) describes a "quiet but assertive push by China in 
recent years to expand its footprint and influence" in the Caribbean "through government 
grants and loans, investments by Chinese companies, and diplomatic, cultural and security 
efforts." While "governments in the region have welcomed Beijing's interest, the Trump 
administration has viewed China's growing presence - and its potential to challenge 
Washington's influence in the region — with concern and suspicion." The Times says "the region 
has strategic importance as a hub for logistics, banking and commerce, analyst say, and could 
have great security value in a military conflict because of its proximity to the United States." 
American Citizen Says He Was Denied Refuge At US Consulate In Hong Kong. 
The Wall Street Journal (11/8, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) reports Ansen Wong, an 
American citizen who is facing prosecution stemming from his role in pro-democracy protests in 
Hong Kong claims he was denied refuge at the US consulate in the city. Wong, who entered the 
US mission on Oct. 27 along with three other dissidents, says he asked to be granted refuge 
and was told by a consular officer it was not possible. Wong says the officer gave him advice on 
finding a lawyer and told him diplomats would monitor his case. 
Turkey's Finance Minister Resigns. 
The AP (11/8, Wilks) reports Turkey's finance minister Berak Albayrak "announced his 
resignation on social media Sunday." Albayrak, who is President Recep Tayyip Erdo6an's son-in-
law, "said on Instagram that he was stepping down from his post for health reasons and would 
spend more time with his family." Reuters (11/8, Devranoglu, Coskun) says Albayrak's 
resignation marks "the second surprise departure of a top economic policymaker in two days 
after the central bank chief was ousted." The Wall Street Journal (11/8, Subscription 
Publication, 7.57M) reports the shake up comes amid a currency selloff that has seen the 
Turkish lira decline 30% against the US dollar this year. 
The New York Times (11/8, Gall, 18.61M) says Albayrak's resignation "may also signal a 
recalibration by Mr. Erdogan in reaction to the election" of President-elect Biden. Part of 
Albayrak's "portfolio was to handle relations with the White House through his friendship with 
President Trump's daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner." 
Azerbaijan's President Says Forces Have Taken Control Of Shushi. 
The AP (11/8) reports Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev said in a televised address Sunday 
Azerbaijani forces have taken control of the city of Shushi in Nagorno-Karabakh. However, 
"Armenian Defense Ministry spokesman Artsrun Ovannisian said late Sunday that fighting in 
and around Shushi was continuing." The AP adds the city "is of significant military value 
because it sits on heights about 10 kilometers (six miles) south of the region's capital of 
Stepanakert and lies along the main road connecting Nagorno-Karabakh with Armenia." In 
addition, it is "significant as a onetime center of Azerbaijani culture, noted for music and poets." 
The New York Times (11/8, Kramer, 18.61M) says "the fact that fighting has reached the 
main road connecting Armenia with the ethnic Armenian towns and cities in Nagorno-Karabakh 
bodes ill for the Armenian side." The Wall Street Journal (11/8, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) 
provides similar coverage.

in Thailand" as protesters have been holding daily demonstrations "calling for a reform to the 
country's monarchy that includes more transparency and accountability." The AP (11/8, 
Ekvitthayavechnukul) says demonstrators "were confronted by riot police and sprayed by water 
cannons Sunday as they tried to approach Bangkok's Grand Palace to deliver letters about their 
political grievances addressed to the country's king." The AP adds, "The melee was brief, and
