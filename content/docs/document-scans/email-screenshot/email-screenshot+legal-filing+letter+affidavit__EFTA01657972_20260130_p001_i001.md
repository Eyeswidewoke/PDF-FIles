Director Patel Says FBI Leaving Longtime Headquarters 
USA TODAY (05/16, Meyer) reported that Director Patel announced in an interview with Fox News that he's redeploying 1,500 FBI agents, analysts, and 
other personnel from Washington to posts throughout the country, and shutting down the bureau's storied headquarters. Director Patel said that the FBI 
currently has about 11,000 of its 38,000 or so staff in the National Capital Region, a 50.mile radius around Washington, D.C. "It's like a third of the 
workforce. A third of the crime doesn't happen here. So we're taking 1,500 of those folks and moving them out," he said. "Every state's getting a plus 
up." According to the article, Director Patel didn't say much about the plans to move the FBI headquarters, something prior FBI directors and Congress 
acknowledged needed to be done because of the decrepit condition of the building. "I didn't know that I was going to do this, but I'm going to announce 
on your show anyway, this FBI is leaving the Hoover building because this building is unsafe for our workforce," Director Patel said, surprising Deputy 
Director Bongino, who was at his side for the interview. "But we want the American men and women to know if you're going to come work at the 
premier law enforcement agency in the world, we're going to give you a building that's commensurate with that, and that's not this place." Fox 
Mess (05/18, Penley) added that in the Interview Director Patel hinted at a "wave of transparency" to rebuild public trust, citing the agency's handling of 
the Hillary Clinton email investigation as an example of political bias. Director Patel claimed that senior officials, including James homey, "hijacked' the 
Department of Justice's constitutional responsibilities and selectively decided which cases to pursue. Director Patel vows to restore the FBI's reputation, 
accusing former leaders like Conley, Andrew McCabe, and Peter Strzok of weaponizing the agency for political purposes and withholding key evidence 
from the court. "They said the FBI was the most storied institution for law enforcement, and it was, and it will be again very soon: Director Patel vowed, 
tossing in an allegation that the former leadership used taxpayer funds, potentially illegally, to run their operation and withheld key evidence from the 
court. 'That's what broke the FBI. And then, when they were caught, they lied about it, and few media personalities were brave enough to cover it six, 
seven, eight years ago, and we're still talking about It today because Congress is working rigorously with us and the Crossfire Hurricane documents are 
coming fast and hard, and they're being sent there un•redacted so we can have full accountability. That's how you restore the trust that was lost to the 
American public when it comes to the FBI," Director Patel said. Additional reporting from Fox News (05/18, Spector) reported that in the interview, 
Director Patel and Deputy Director Bongino insisted that Jeffrey Epstein killed himself in his Manhattan Jail cell, after reviewing his file. "As someone who 
has worked as a public defender, as a prosecutor who's been in that prison system, who's been in the Metropolitan Detention Center, who's been in 
segregated housing, you know a suicide when you see one, and that's what that was," Director Patel said when questioned about Epstein's death. He 
added that those who disagree with him 'have a right to their opinion' Deputy Director Bongino added, 'He killed himself. I've seen the whole file, he 
killed himself." HuffPost (05/18, Vera) reported that in the interview, Director Patel downplayed President Trump's role in the Jan. 6 Capitol Riot, stating 
that the riot had been "politicized" by Trump's opponents. The article highlighted President Trump's words at his "Save America" rally, where he urged 
followers to "walk down to the Capitol" and "demand that Congress do the right thing." "We fight like hell," Trump also said that day. "And if you don't 
fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore." The article noted that Director Patel teased an upcoming document dump, which he claimed 
would debunk a disinformation campaign. "We Just found a trove of information, and it's on its way to Capitol Hill right now," he said. "They've asked, 
and they're getting it. And you're getting answers on January 6." The Dafralad (05/18, Caralle) reported that Deputy Director Bongino revealed in the 
interview that there is no evidence to support the claim that the assassination attempts on President Donald Trump were part of a foreign plot. "I know 
people — I get it. I understand. It's not there. If it were there, we would have told you," he said. Deputy Director Bongino said that he and Director Patel
