Responsive Memo 
I cut and pasted components Rich Kahn's memo into an email I sent to Frank =nd Tom. This is Frank's response to me 
after he and tom discussed it: 
I am flabbergasted at Rich Kahn's characterization and description. I did i= fact ask him why he wanted to know certain 
things but not in the way that=he has intimated. 
I don't know what documents he thinks he is missing. We identified 2 =tems in our call with Rich about 2 weeks ago 
and promptly provided those =tems to him. Rich said in that call that he would send to us any remaining=questions he 
had but has been radio silent since then. His characterizatio= of the math is very confusing and conflicts sharply with the 
information =e went over with him. He is in fact factually incorrect and I am surprise= as we went through the 50/50 
calculation with him and he seemed to unders=and and as stated above, he did not come back to us with any questions 
as =e indicated he would if he had any remaining. 
Rich appears either not to have read or understand the purchase agreement c=nstruct that provides for Jeffrey pay 50% 
of everything IGY paid and in re=urn receive a 50% interest in AYH. That is in fact what happened yet Rich=seems to be 
tangled up in GAAP accounting nuance. 
I know Jeffrey is a very important friend and partner and we should be =ompletely transparent. Any suggestion by 
Rich that we are not being so is =isplaced at best. I am a bit of a at a loss as to how to untangle given Ri=h's e-mail and its 
disconnect from the facts and our phone conversation. E=ther Rich does not understand or he does not want to 
understand, or worse,=has some other agenda. The innuendo in his e-mail is disturbing and unwarr=nted. 
I think if we had a third party acceptable to Jeffrey look at the informati=n including the purchase agreement, it could be 
clearly illustrated to Jef=rey that it was in fact a 50/50 deal as described. We are happy to take w=atever time it takes to 
review but we don't seem to be communicating with =ich very well. Let's discuss.
