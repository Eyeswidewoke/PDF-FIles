Whistleblower Says FBI Abuses Security Clearance to 'Purge' Conservatives, Views 
Them as 'Unworthy' of Employment 
The New York Post (07/02, Christenson) reported that the FBI is abusing its security clearance process to 
"purge" political conservatives from the Bureau, according to recent whistleblower disclosures reviewed 
by the Post. The article stated that the federal law enforcement agency's Security Division has been 
suspending or revoking clearances for employees whose political affiliation or COVID-19 
vaccination status are suspect, a supervisory special agent who formerly worked in the division alleges. 
According to the article, the unnamed agent, who is described as "a registered Democrat" and is 
represented by the nonprofit Empower Oversight, further claims that high-ranking officials in the division 
believed "if an FBI employee fit a certain profile as a political conservative, they were viewed as security 
concerns and unworthy to work at the FBI." The article mentioned the case of Marcus Allen, a former FBI 
staff operations specialist (SOS) suspended without pay for more than two years, the officials ignored 
"possibly exculpatory information" and overruled investigators who "concluded SOS Allen's 'Allegiance to 
the United States' was not in question and that the suspension of his security clearance was not 
warranted." That decision came after Allen informed his supervisors at the FBI's Charlotte Field Office that 
he did not intend to take the COVID-19 vaccine. The article noted that Empower President Tristan Leavitt 
revealed in a letter to members of Congress on Tuesday that the supervisory special agent has since been 
retaliated against for disclosing "the improper suspension and revocation of other employee's security 
clearances" besides Allen's. The article added that the agent's full whistleblower disclosure and 
retaliation complaint was also submitted by Empower to the Department of Justice's Office of the 
Inspector General (DOJ OIG) and Office of Professional Responsibility on June 28. The article 
quoted Leavitt, who said, "The outcomes of clearance investigations and adjudications were often pre-
determined by the Division's acting Deputy Assistant Director and the acting Section Chief responsible for 
security clearance investigations and adjudications, who often overruled line staff and even dictated the 
wording of documents in the clearance process, over the last few years, the FBI has used the clearance 
process as a means to force employees out of the FBI by inflicting severe financial distress: suspending 
their clearance, suspending them from duty without pay, requiring them to obtain permission to take any 
other job while stuck in this unpaid limbo, and delaying their final clearance adjudication indefinitely —
even years." Leavitt warned in his letter to lawmakers that "the same officials at the heart of much of this 
inappropriate behavior are either still leading the Division or rewarded with senior leadership positions 
within the FBI." He urged them to "independently corroborate" the whistleblower's disclosures "and pass 
legislation to fix the abusive security clearance process and successfully protect future whistleblowers." 
Leavitt also told DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz that the whistleblowing supervisory special 
agent — who was indefinitely suspended just a year before being eligible for retirement — "should be 
immediately returned to duty and provided back pay and benefits for his time on unpaid leave The 
Federalist (07/02, Justice), and Daily Signal (07/02, Lucas) also reported on the story. 
Continued Reporting: Teddy Roosevelt's Watch, Stolen in 1987, Turns up at Florida 
Auction House 
The Washington Post (07/02, Edwards) reported that on Thursday, officials returned a pocket watch 
engraved with President Theodore Roosevelt's name to Roosevelt's family home at Sagamore Hill 
National Historic Site in Oyster Bay, N.Y., on Long Island. The article stated that Sagamore had owned and 
displayed the watch since his death in 1919. But a thief stole the watch in 1987 while it was being loaned 
to another historic site associated with the 26th president, and it fell off the radar for more than 35 years 
until Edwin Bailey started advertising an auction for the piece online. The article mentioned that the
