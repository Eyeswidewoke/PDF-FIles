1 Leon had I known from the beginning what i kno= now, I would never have gotten involved with ana s issue never ! 
ever.! . /=C2 I have 40 years of experience dealing with the IRS , I n=ver have cheated ,evaded or crafted ridiculous 
returns . =C2 I am maniacal in taking carefully crafted thoughtf=l positions that even if we dont get the beneift of the 
full a=ount ( i have no recollection of any total loss on any position.) =C2 we get most of it.. Hence my credibility with 
the IRS=C2 is unsurpassed. my research is detailed and =he case laws are always relevant. 
Anas=situation is 
emblematic of my warning s and advice that conti=ues to go unheeded. . I have repeatedly told you that th=se girls, 
all want to show that they are clever, come from countrie= where taxes are rarely paud and on top of that , they have 
no exper=ence with real rules, money or biz . they always push th= envelope beyond the pale 
unfortunately usually 
ending=up getting the principal in serious trouble.. ( sometimes by design=C2 , but i m sure , not in this case ). For 
si= months I have asked you , her and her gay bookkeeper if there was somethi=g i didn't know , as I found this audit 
highly unus=al.- highly ! not helpful that you with the usual voice =f authority telling me in no uncertain terms "what 
the a=ent really wants" . I continue to be amazed how you , barry, and brad share ve=y strong detailed views without 
even one day of true experienc=. and relying on joslin and tom I will review with you the fa=ts on the phone . 
2. I can easily ignore the fact that=your concern of deductibity of the first 100 million that saved your finan=ial life. and 
provided a resurrection of 3 billion dollars of =span id="m_9001159257864568465:1e9.11">grats that had died =s not 
balanced by the recognition of what you had received and not to date=paid for . Each time you have chosen not to pay 
what we agreed. =AO or what has been written by me in many emails BEFORE the transact=ons are complete. you tell 
me that tom and joslins advice is one of the reasons that you=feel you shouldn't pay the amount owed writen or agreed. 
( =mind you , this only happens AFTER you have received the benefits of=my adivice ) 
you then add the easily refuted 
and =illy argument that it was Alan's idea. BTW =AO It is and would have been super easy for you to set a meeti=g if 
you had chosen to get to the bottom of this farce.. you =ave met with brad. there are memos. 
there are ema=ls
which you choose not even to look at , for , I can only assume = for fear that it is as clear as I suggest it to be . ). NOW -
lets =ssume that i show you alan 
3 It seems you have f=rgotten that you asked for my HELP! . Gigi, Carlyn= audit , gift tax audit audit. 8865, =C2 
gagosian cont=act. underpayment of Apollo offshore. tax. now AF and A . =AO - it is wholly unfair that after I tell you 
what I will charge , =ou say , don't worry _ as you know we always work it out, =omplete the transaction to your 
benefit and then and only then you d=cide not to pay , you then categorically state,( true ) that=C2 I never agreed to 
your emails or even read them, or ag=eed to follow our agreement which I unilaterally considered null and void = but 
this happens AFTER the fact.
