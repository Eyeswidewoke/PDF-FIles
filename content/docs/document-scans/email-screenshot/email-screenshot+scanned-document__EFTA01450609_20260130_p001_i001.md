substantially in a context of price stability. In judging when to moderate the 
pace of asset purchases, the Committee will, at its coming meetings, assess 
whether incoming information continues to support the committee's expectation 
of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back 
toward its longer-run objective. Asset purchases are not on a preset course, 
and the Committee's decisions about their pace will remain contingent on the 
Committee's economic outlook as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy 
and costs of such purchases. 
To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, 
the Committee today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of 
monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the 
asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens. In 
particular, the Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal 
funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that this 
exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at 
least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation 
between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half 
percentage point above the committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and 
longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored. In 
determining how long to maintain a highly accommodative stance of monetary 
policy, the committee will also consider other information, including 
additional measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation 
pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments. 
when the committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will 
take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum 
employment and inflation of 2 percent. 
Voting for the FOMC monetary policy action were: Ben S. Bernanke, Chairman; 
william C. Dudley, vice Chairman; James Bullard; Charles L. Evans; Jerome H. 
Powell; Eric S. Rosengren; Jeremy C. Stein; Daniel K. Tarullo; and Janet L. 
Yellen. voting against the action was Esther L. George, who was concerned that 
the continued high level of monetary accommodation increased the risks of 
future economic and financial imbalances and, over time, could cause an 
increase in long-term inflation expectations.
