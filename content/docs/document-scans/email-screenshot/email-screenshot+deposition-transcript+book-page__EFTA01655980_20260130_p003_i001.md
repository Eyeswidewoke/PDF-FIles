Federal Authorities Probe Effort to Impersonate White House Chief of Staff 
The Wall Street Journal (05/29, Dawsey) reported that federal authorities are investigating an effort to impersonate 
White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, who had her personal cellphone contacts hacked. The impersonator has 
been contacting prominent Republicans and business executives by text and phone, using artificial intelligence to 
imitate Wiles's voice and making requests that appeared to be official. The article noted that the FBI and White 
House are looking into the matter, with the FBI stating that they do not believe a foreign nation is involved and are 
working to determine the goal and identity of the impersonator. "The FBI takes all threats against the president, his 
staff, and our cybersecurity with the utmost seriousness," Director Patel said in a statement. "Safeguarding our 
administration officials' ability to securely communicate to accomplish the president's mission is a top

Director Bongino told "FOX & Friends" on Thursday, noting the case is a top priority. "We were told by partisan 
actors out there, this was the insurrection, the world was going to fall apart, and no one seemed to show any 
interest in this case," he argued, adding that he and Director Patel have made the pipe bomb investigation a 
priority for their department. Then Vice President-elect Kamala Harris was inside the DNC's offices when the pipe
