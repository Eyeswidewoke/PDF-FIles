• Judge Says Trump Administration Can't Use Travel Ban to Keep 80 Refugees Out of the U.S. 
WASHINGTON SCHEDULE 
IN THE NEWS 
Alleged Minnesota Shooter Confessed to Killings in Letter to Director Patel 
The Washington Post (07/15, Bailey) reported that Vance Boelter, a 57-year-old man from Minnesota, has been 
indicted on enhanced murder charges for the killings of state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark. 
According to the article, Boelter allegedly confessed to the shootings in a handwritten letter to Director Patel, 
claiming he was acting on secret orders from Governor Tim Walz, which authorities describe as a fantasy. Boelter 
also faces charges for the attempted murders of state Sen. John Hoffman, his wife Yvette, and their daughter Hope, 
with prosecutors considering the death penalty if he is convicted. The Associated Press (07/15, Karnowski) reported 
that U.S. Attorney Joseph Thompson stated that a decision on whether to seek the death penalty "will not come for 
several months" and will be up to AG Bondi. "Last month, the State of Minnesota experienced fear and panic. 
Today, Vance Boelter was indicted by a federal grand jury, marking another step forward in our pursuit of justice," 
said Special Agent in Charge Alvin M. Winston Sr. of FBI Minneapolis in the press release. "As alleged in the 
indictment, Boelter's actions took the lives of Minnesota House Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman and her husband 
Mark Hortman, both beloved members of our community. The indictment also alleges that Boelter seriously 
wounded Minnesota State Senator John Hoffman and his wife. This targeted violence was an attack on the rule of 
law, resulting in a manhunt involving hundreds of law enforcement officers who worked tirelessly until Boelter was 
apprehended. The FBI remains grateful to our federal, state, and local law enforcement partners for their 
dedication throughout this investigation. Together, we will ensure that justice is served and that a price is paid for 
the reign of terror and violence our community endured." Additional reporting on the story was provided by New 
York Post (07/15, Galvin), National Review (07/15, Lynch), Politico (07/15, Svirnovskiy), CBS News (07/15, Premo),

Continued Reporting: With Epstein Conspiracy Theories, President Trump Faces a Crisis of His Own 
Making 
The Associated Press (07/15, Swenson, Riccardi) reported that President Trump is facing a crisis due to conspiracy 
theories surrounding Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking investigation, which he helped create by stoking dark theories 
and embracing QAnon-tinged propaganda. According to the article, Trump's supporters are demanding 
transparency and the release of Epstein's files, which the Justice Department and FBI say do not exist, and are 
calling him "out of touch" for downplaying the issue. The article assessed that Trump's attempts to quell the uproar 
may not work, as his base is demanding answers and may lose faith in him if he doesn't provide transparency, 
potentially costing him support in the midterms. "I don't understand why the Jeffrey Epstein case would be of 
interest to anybody," Trump said to reporters on Tuesday. He called the Epstein case "pretty boring" and said the 
credible information had been given. The article added that the DOJ and the FBI recently walked back the notion 
that there is an Epstein client list of elites who participated in the trafficking of underage girls. Trump has praised 
AG Bondi's handling of the case and suggested that she should release "whatever she thinks is credible," but he has 
also claimed that there are credibility issues with the documents and suggested, without evidence, that they were 
"made up" by former FBI Director James Comey and former Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden. The article 
noted that AG Bondi and Deputy Director Bongino had a tense exchange last week at the White House over a story 
about Epstein. Laura Loomer, who's close to Trump, said Friday she was told that Deputy Director Bongino was 
"seriously thinking about resigning." The article stated that the FBI declined to comment. Additional reporting from 
the Associated Press (07/15, Richer) reported that AG Bondi dodged questions about Jeffrey Epstein and her clash 
with FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino, amid calls for her resignation from some high-profile members of President 
Donald Trump's base. AG Bondi suggested she has no plans to step down, stating she will remain attorney general 
as long as President Trump wants her to. Despite the turmoil, AG Bondi attempted to shift focus to other Justice 
Department efforts, such as recent drug seizures, and Trump defended her handling of the Epstein matter. The
