3. Hedge funds generally allow subscriptions on a monthly or quarterly basis. Your interest in a hedge fund or hedge fund of funds is generally as of the first business day of the subscription period. Due 
to early funding requirements by the applicable fund, your account may be debited for the subscription amount prior to the subscription date. Please refer to the applicable hedge fund's operative 
documentation for further details. 
Hedge fund redemptions are generally on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis but can sometimes be subject to a multi-year lockup before a redemption is permitted. For redemptions, there is generally 
a notification period that can be a long interval before the actual redemption date. Redemption proceeds are generally paid 15 calendar days after the final NAV is issued, but can be subject to a 
holdback of a portion of the proceeds until an annual audit of the Fund has been completed. Please refer to the applicable hedge funds operative documentation for further details. 
Global Access Portfolios share certain characteristics with hedge funds. In particular, an investor who withdraws from a Global Access Portfolio will not receive the withdrawal proceeds in their entirety 
until 30-60 days after completion of the Portfolio's audit, which may be 18 months or longer after the redemption date. Interest may not be paid on any proceeds pending distribution. These restrictions 
apply even if the investors account at JPMorgan is closed. The Confidential Private Placement Memorandum and applicable Supplements contain other important information about the Global Access 
Portfolios and are available upon request. 
4. Alternative assets may include publicly available mutual funds that utilize non-traditional investment management strategies, for example, strategies commonly employed by hedge funds. Mutual 
funds generally calculate the price (the "Net Asset Value" or "NAV') on a daily basis and mutual fund NAVs shown on your statement generally will be the NAV as of the close of the last business day for 
this statement period. Please refer to the applicable mutual fund prospectus for further details. If the applicable mutual fund is a JPMorgan Fund, please refer to disclosures on this statement conceming
