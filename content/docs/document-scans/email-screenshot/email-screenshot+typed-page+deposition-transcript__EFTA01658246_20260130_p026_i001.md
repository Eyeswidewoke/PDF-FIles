White House Coronavirus Task Force Response Coordinator Deborah Birx said in an 
interview with Sinclair Broadcasting GroupVi (7/29, 22K), "There's a very serious pandemic in 
the South. What you can see is that serious epidemic in the South is moving northward. This is 
the moment to make that change. ... By the time you see hospitalizations, you have incredible 
asymptomatic spread. The rural Americans often didn't experience that and now they are." 
On TelemundoVi (7/29, 249K), Surgeon General Adams said, "This absolutely can get 
worse for everyone but particularly for Latinos." Birx said, "Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana, Virginia, 
and a small part of West Virginia. This when you need to go back to your public and ask them 
to do the things that kept them, and kept the cases so low." 
Trump Stands By Retweet Of Doctors Touting Hydroxychloroquine. 
On NBC Nightly NewsVi (7/29, story 3, 1:05, Holt, 5.97M), Kristen Welker reported that 
President Trump "is digging in, after retweeting a video of doctors Monday promoting the 
controversial drug hydroxychloroquine, and saying social distancing and wearing masks is 
unnecessary. The doctor at the forefront pedals in conspiracy theories." Trump: "She was 
making a statement about hydroxychloroquine with other doctors that swear by it. They think 
it's great. She was not alone." NBC added, "Joe Biden excoriating the President today." Biden: 
"President Trump should stop tweeting and start doing something about it, dammit. ... And stop 
going on and talking about this crazy woman he talked about last night who is an absolute 
disgrace." 
On ABC World News TonightVi (7/29, story 2, 1:20, Muir, 7.22M), Mary Bruce said Trump 
"doubled down on his support for a fringe doctor who is spreading lies about the coronavirus, 
even after learning she claims demons and witches cause illnesses." The CBS Evening NewsVi 
(7/29, story 3, 0:35, O'Donnell, 4.28M) reported that Trump "doubled down on 
hydroxychloroquine, requiring his own health experts to once again remind Americans it doesn't 
actually work." CNBC (7/29, Lovelace, 3.62M) reports on its website that NIAID Director Fauci 
"said Wednesday that all the 'valid' scientific data shows...hydroxychloroquine isn't effective in 
treating the coronavirus." Appearing on MSNBC's Andrea Mitchell ReportsVi (7/29, 1.09M), 
Fauci said, "You look at the scientific data and the evidence. And the scientific data...on trials 
that are valid, that were randomized and controlled in the proper way, all of those trials show 
consistently that hydroxychloroquine is not effective in the treatment of coronavirus disease or 
COVID-19." 
Navarro: Hydroxychloroquine Can "Save Lives" And Should Be Prescribed More 
Frequently. Politico (7/29, Forgey, 4.29M) says the White House has "aggressively renewed 
their promotion of hydroxychloroquine." Politico says Director of Trade and Manufacturing Policy 
Navarro "led the charge Wednesday...in defiance of scientific evidence. But he declined to 
address the president's praise for a Houston-area physician who falsely claimed the drug was a 
coronavirus cure and has promoted other conspiracy theories." Navarro is quoted as saying, 
"I'm pleading with you...to look at this drug again. ... Because I literally have tens of millions of 
tablets sitting in the Strategic National Stockpile that — if we were allowed under the doctors' 
advice to get this stuff to people at the first sign of their symptoms - I guarantee you it would 
cut the amount of time of the symptoms, reduce the duration of the symptoms and save lives." 
Fauci, Birx, Carson Advocate Use Of Face Masks. 
NIAID Director Fauci said on MSNBC's Andrea Mitchell ReportsVi (7/29, 1.09M), "I'm not totally 
against mandating, but I don't want to step on the toes of people in the independent way they 
run their states and cities. But clearly the bottom line, without any distraction, is that it is very 
important for people to universally wear masks and there's no ambiguity about that statement. 
They just have got to do it." Fauci added, "I think right now you're seeing the situation has 
changed. Vice President Pence wears a mask now. We've seen the President wear a mask. And 
the President even has been recommending wearing of masks. He said that publicly, and I'm
