I am currently preparing a paper for Cosmos & History, the philosophy journal where the Foundation of Mind 
conference proceedings go. A late draft is attached. 
The title is "Notes from the existential underground: the universe as a complex emergent system." 
In it, I refer to Chris Langan's work from 2002 (CTMU) and my own from 2003 (Novel View): 
Implications of a novel view of the cosmological energy density and pressure 
relationship<https://independent.academia.edu/MichelleKMcGee> (Academia.edu<http://academia.edu> link) 
Your daring sensibility in deconstructing lack's pet retrocausality has been a pleasure to read. Many great 
teaching/learning points and connections.

Yes of course but how are the measurements communicated? 
rote: 
Say you have a box coupled electromagnetically to whatever its measuring and sending signals to control, how does the 
box communicate with the controller several miles away. By radio, yes, correct. What if the control communicates to the 
box by a quantum channel sending classical data with the measure/no-measure protocol"? 
At the bottom of it, relativity is all about metrology/horology. You're communicating time and length standards. 
let's look at a time standard (limit to SR). The usual thing is clocks in a frame are moved from the origin very slowly to 
their destinations in the frame. They ping off the seconds and a record of their time and we can say, although they all 
keep the same rate of time, the distant ones are retarded or delayed as we read their times pinging every second back 
at the origin. We know full well that this is just the transit time but it is verboten to speak of distant observers having the 
same instant of time as oneself. This is the failure of simultaneity in time. 
What if now we communicate our clock standard by a quantum channel and the collapse protocol (discernable by an 
interferometer, 0: no measurement, 1: measurement**)? We know that the collapse is instantaneous (let's not argue 
that, it's been measured, at least retrospectively*** ). We'd have simultaneity. 
Now we can compare putative retrocausal effects against this gold standard of simultaneity as, at least in one frame, we 
can say we have an absolute tick of the clock. To be truly retrocausal, with this time standard, I would need some 
phenomena where: variable = f( tl, t2, variable, d variable/dt, d this that/dt etc.) and not merely have some retarded 
time term t' = t - r/c because our gold standard quantum channel synchronised clocks would catch this (ha ha, light is 
"slow"). 
And it just may be... a gifted psychic person gets into a trance in a laboratory (today) and says, "let's all not meet here 
next week because the security guard goes mad at 11.30 Friday and kills us all" (and he does turns up next week and has 
no-one to kill, as predicted and avoided). That would be truly retrocausal. The effect from next week just pops into that 
locale (that point in space and absolute time) and his head with no discernable causality (no wave equation, no chugging 
of things through space-time, totally discontinuous). 
In fact the sine qua non of a retrocausal effect could only be this discontinuous generation of events on a space-time 
diagram and the retrospective cognizance (or correlation) that it was connected to a future event WITH the absolute 
quantum channel time standard.
