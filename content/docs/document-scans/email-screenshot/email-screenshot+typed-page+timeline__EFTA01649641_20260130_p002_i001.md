The Associated Press (07/07, Gonzalez Cline) reported that a man with an assault rifle fired dozens of rounds at federal agents and a US. Border 
Patrol facility in Texas on Monday, injuring a police officer, before authorities shot and killed him. Authorities identified the shooter as Ryan Louis 
Mosqueda, believed to be 27, who they said shot at agents exiting the building, which is near the US.•Mexico border. McAllen Police Chief Victor 
Rodriguez said Mosqueda had a "utility vest" in addition to the rifle when federal agents returned fire. Hours before the attack in McAllen, 
Mosqueda's father was stopped by Weslaco police around 2:30 a.m. for a traffic violation, according to police spokesperson Heriberto Caraveo. 
The father told police that he was looking for his son, who he said had psychological issues and was carrying weapons in his car, Caraveo told the 
outlet. Police say the white two•door sedan that Mosqueda drove to the facility had letters painted — possibly in Latin — on the driver's side door. 
"What it means, or whether or not it is an underlying reason for him being here, I do not know," Rodriguez said when asked about the 
graffiti. After Mosqueda was killed, law enforcement found other weaponry, ammunition and backpacks inside the vehicle. Rodriguez said his 
department received a call about the shooting around 5:50 a.m. One officer who responded to the shooting, a 10•year veteran, was injured after 
being struck in the knee. Rodriguez said it was unclear if the injury was from shrapnel or a bullet. Police say Mosqueda was linked to a Michigan 
address, but was reported missing from a Weslaco, Texas, address around 4 a.m. Monday. The exact details of the missing person report were not 
immediately shared with the media. Rodriguez said there is no ongoing threat to the public, but it is unknown if any other people were involved in 
the attack. He said the motive and events leading up to the attack are part of the ongoing investigation, which the FBI is taking the lead on. NBC 
News (07/07, Alsharif, Stridden et al.) clarified that according to the DHS, the suspect opened fire at the entrance of the federal government 
building• and Border Patrol agents and local police "helped neutralize the shooter." A Border Patrol employee and two officers were injured, DHS 
spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said, adding that one of them was shot in the knee. All were taken to a hospital. Fox News (07/07, Pinedo) 
revealed that in a statement emailed to the outlet, a spokesperson for FBI San Antonio said that McAllen police received calls of shots being heard 
by a local Border Patrol facility near the McAllen International Airport at approximately 5:53 a.m. The spokesperson said the armed suspect, who 
they did not identify as Mosqueda but rather an "adult male," "engaged the law enforcement officers responding to the scene and officers 
returned fire." The FBI representative said there is "currently no threat to public safety that we are aware of" and that the investigation is ongoing.

FBI Agent Accused Of Raping Clients In His Tattoo Parlor Goes On Trial 
The Washington Post (07/07, Morse) reported that on a witness stand three years ago, FBI agent Eduardo Valdivia's testimony hit home with 
jurors. Yes, he shot an unarmed panhandler while commuting to work aboard a moving Metro train. But it was an act of self-defense and not 
attempted murder, Valdivia said, because the man had backed him into a corner and was a threat to take his gun. The agent was acquitted on all 
counts and resumed active duty. On Monday, Valdivia returns to the same courthouse in Montgomery County, Maryland, for an entirely new case. 
Prosecutors say the 41•year•old raped three women — one who had just turned 18 — inside an offhours tattoo operation he quietly ran under 
the alias "Lilo Brown." Valdivia lured them in with offers of free tattoos and possible modeling work, according to prosecutors, and video• 
recorded at least some of the assaults. His defense for this trial: Yes, he engaged in sexual activity with the three women, but everything was 
consensual. Jury selection is scheduled to start Monday and last two days, owing in part to concerns about finding impartial jurors given extensive 
media coverage, according to recent court filings. The trial itself is scheduled to last eight days. Valdivia, who has been jailed since his arrest last 
year and is currently suspended by the FBI, had recently worked on domestic terrorism cases from the FBI's Washington headquarters, Bonsib 
said. If convicted of all charges, including eight counts of second-degree rape, he could be sentenced to decades in prison. WTOP•FM (07/07,

Cleveland FBI Seeks Tips on International Fugitive Accused of Smuggling Guns in Used Cars 
W0IO (CBS.19) (07/07, Staff Writer) reported that federal investigators are renewing their push for tips from the public to help track down a 
former North Olmsted man who is accused of smuggling guns overseas by hiding them in used vehicles. According to FBI Cleveland, George 
Nakhle Ajaltouni is a native of Lebanon and became a United States Citizen in 2009. Nearly a decade later, records show he was charged with 
naturalization fraud and a federal warrant was issued for his arrest after investigators found he lied on his citizenship and passport 
applications. Ajaltouni, who is now 50 years old, is also facing more serious charges in a separate federal case. The article noted that between 
2011 to 2014, records show he used cash to buy large quantities of pistols and rifles at gun shows and from private sellers. According to the FBI, 
Ajaltouni would then buy used cars and hide the weapons in the doors and body panels. The vehicles were later shipped to Lebanon with the 
smuggled guns concealed inside, records show. The FBI believes he is now living in Lebanon and may travel to Cyprus and France. Investigators 
say Ajaltouni is an associate of Nakhle Nader, who is also wanted by the FBI.
