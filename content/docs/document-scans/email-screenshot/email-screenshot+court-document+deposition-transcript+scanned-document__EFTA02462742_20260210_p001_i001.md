1. The audit has brou=ht to the fore the lack of your office quality that i have been viol=ntly squawking about. ie . 
children playing at at adult =ame. It is inconceivable to me that John castrucci is=C2 still there , joslin part time. , joe 
mistake afte= mistake and brad the corporate bandleader talking about the office&=39;s finance team, accounting dept, 
directing wendy to do things tha= make no sense for you ? !its nuts . non existent IT dep=. though it was the first thing 
on my suggested list of things to be=done 
\ no trading accounts to speak o=, though its prophylactic quality has 
been discussed over and over =or three years. As you said you wanted to save money by not pa=ing my high fees. . 
the result was predictable. =AO now you have a choice a simple choice. =AO very simple . 
you can pay me an= my team , I will oversee the audits. take charge of the TRA BRH ass=gnments and review 2012 
options. LOts of paper needs to be collected and r=ivewed, the outside team at my expense working for me, come 
in=for two to three weeks -they will review procedures and practices.=C2 . set up ,an up- to- date accounting system, 
, com=uterized timelines for filings etc. . household classifc=tions and reporting that makes sense. you will not be 
su=prised however that the price for my work has not changed sinc= day one. 40m per year, I m willing to discount to 
35 as I di= give you a bad number and should pay an embarassment fine. 1= also aware that you have paid what you 
consider a great deal of money, th=ugh, as you know , without a doubt , you have far and away recieved =ay more than 
called for in our agreement . please also =emember that you and i agreed no more demands on my time after the l=st 
payment. no more - so called after care etc. I stepp=d in as you had a mess on your plate and have worked many 
many hours=doing things that are not my responsiblity soley because of our uniq=e friendship. by the way , on 
antoher note you seem shy to di=cuss certain things. , please be assured I make no judgement on any=of your activities 
, whether or not i agree with it. not my ro=e. my role is, protection first. no matter what you do. =A0 
2. you can decide that brad , tom , and whomever =Ise you choose can oversee your audits . they are sensitive to the 
i=sue at hand. alan can be brought in but i would be extra careful ha=ing paul weiss given access to entire story. 
3. Remind me to talk to you about ..
