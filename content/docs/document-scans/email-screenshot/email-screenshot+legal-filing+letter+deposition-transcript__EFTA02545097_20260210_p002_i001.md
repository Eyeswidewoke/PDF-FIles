There's a simple way out of this impasse -- not =y setting up an adversary proceeding with a mediator, as you suggest, 
but =y you telling me what you disagree with in what i have outlined to you and=what your reasons are. You have not 
yet done that in a single letter= So, simply, why not do it right now, and then we can proceed. 
=div> 
Again, I've repeatedly spelled out the circumstance= in extensive detail. So, simply, tell me what you disagree with 
and=why. No mediators are necessary, just a direct response. Or if=you feel that you have already done so, then re-
send the letter in which y=u responded to my detailed account, telling me what you disagree with and =hy. 
Meanwhile, while the impasse continues, I'm compelled to face constant aggravating and painful circumstances, =ot to 
speak of humiliating demands and by now significant costs. Tha= can end if we simply resolve these matters quickly in a 
straightforward a=d simple way. 
I haven't responded to the last=part of your letter because it doesn't relate to the matter at hand.=C2 I was referring to 
Max's radical shift in stand, not to how affa=rs were managed in the past. To repeat, when distributions were made=to 
family from the IRA, and taxes and management fees for the entire estat= were drawn from the IRA -- exhausting the 
mandatory withdrawal -- Max, my=lawyer, raised no question about the financial circumstances of the benefi=iaries, nor 
should he have done so. But when i am requesting tax payments =rom the marital trust that was set up for M and me 
and the survivor for ou= lifetimes, all of a sudden he is making exorbitant and humiliating demand=. What you describe 
below has nothing to do with this simple matter.=/div>

Dear Doddoy, 
We've tried to talk to you a=out your financial situation several times over the past couple of years, in person, by phone, 
and by e-mail. The process has been extremely unpleasant for us, and we presume for you as well. More importantly, it 
has not led to any enlightenment on any of our parts. Much of what we've trie= to say you have flatly denied; some of it 
we think you simply haven't u=derstood. You seem absolutely convinced that your beliefs are correct and absolutely 
uninterested in trying to look at the situation in other ways, to the exten= that you can't even remember these 
exchanges. Much of what you I-=;ve said to us conflicts directly with our personal knowledge of your history and with 
legal and financial advice from every source we've heard from.=C2 So the conversations lead only to more stress and 
heartache. 
We are not willing to continue trying to discuss this with you unless somet=ing changes. One change would be to 
include a professional in the convers=tion who can resolve our differences in belief about basic facts. However, you 
have apparently decided that because you disapprove of some of the suggestions made by your former lawyer and 
financial managers -- many of which were based on choices you and Mommoy had made previously -- you will now not 
believe anything they tell you. That leaves us with no recour=e to determine the truth about anything that happened 
between 20O7 and 2016.<=r> We have suggested a mediator as a last resort. Perhaps with a mediato= we can at least 
listen to each other's beliefs and perspectives, even i= we can't come to agreement on key points. Perhaps a mediator 
coul= even help us find a way to investigate the questions of fact and come to some conclusions that we could all 
accept. <=ont size="2" face="Arial">
