intelligence." The FSB did not "name the serviceman or give his rank." Masked men in plain 
clothes "could be seen rushing out of a van, grabbing a man in the street and bundling him into 
the back of the vehicle before driving off in footage of the arrest shown by RIA." 
Belarus' Arrest Of Russian Wagner Soldiers May Have Been Staged To Postpone 
Elections. 
The Daily Beast (7/30, 1.39M) reports the videos were "certainly not what Russians have come 
to expect from their country's secret warriors abroad: powerful men in unmarked uniforms 
imposing Russian influence on Syria, Ukraine, and Africa." These men were "caught on camera 
by Belarusian security officers totally unprepared." Some were "naked except for underwear, 
with documents, propaganda leaflets, and condoms strewn around their hotel rooms." 
Belarusian state news agencies reported the "soldiers served as Russian security contractors 
with Wagner, a Russian private military group close to the government." Belarusian officials 
"said that they were in the country for 'destabilization' purposes before the elections." Moscow 
"denied any military involvement in Belarus, and some believe the mercenaries were simply 
using the country as a staging post on their way to or from their latest assignment." 
Op-Ed: Holding Syria Accountable For Chemical Attacks Will Be Tough Without 
Sharing Intelligence. 
In an op-ed in the Washington Post (7/30, Carnegie, Carson, 14.2M), Allison Carnegie And 
Austin Carson, authors of 'Secrets in Global Governance: Disclosure Dilemmas and the 
Challenge of International Cooperation,' write, "A chemical weapons confrontation is escalating 
in Syria, after an international watchdog agency concluded this month that Damascus used 
chemical weapons, lied to investigators and violated its commitment to dismantle its chemical 
weapons arsenal. Syria has 90 days to respond or face a referral to the UN Security Council for 
possible punishment. ... Our new book analyzes another source of evidence - information 
derived from national intelligence that is quietly shared with international organizations. 
Governments collectively spend billions of dollars each year on technologies and human 
networks that can provide precise and timely information on compliance with international 
rules." They conclude, "The experience in holding Syria accountable for its chemical weapons 
commitments shows that intelligence can help to fill in evidentiary gaps and give international 
law more bite." 
Anti-Tank Weapon Rarely Seen In Afghanistan Destroys Helicopter. 
The New York Times (7/30, Gibbons-Neff, Mashal, 18.61M) reports an Afghan helicopter was 
"attacked in the country's south this week by what US and Afghan officials say was a missile 
rarely seen in the hands of the Taliban, raising new concerns for a beleaguered Afghan military 
and questions about who supplied the weapon." A Black Hawk helicopter was returning on 
Monday from "a medical evacuation mission in Helmand Province and was preparing to land." 
American and Afghan officials "said it is unclear if the helicopter had touched down or was 
hovering just feet off the ground when it was struck by an anti-tank guided missile." Anti-tank 
guided missiles, which come in many variants, "are common in Syria, Iraq and Yemen, having 
been captured from military bases and supplied by countries such as the US, Russia and Iran." 
US military officials "said that the weapons have been rare in Afghanistan."
