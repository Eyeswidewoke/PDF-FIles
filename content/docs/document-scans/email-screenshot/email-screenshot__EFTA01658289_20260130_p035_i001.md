Study: Children May Carry Coronavirus At High Levels. 
NBC Nightly NewsVI (7/30, story 5, 2:10, Holt, 5.82M) reported, "As the death toll from 
COVID-19 rises in this country, there's new concerns tonight about children with the disease 
and their ability to spread it." NBC's Miguel Almaguer added, "With the nation fast approaching 
4.5 million cases, tonight a new study finds children under five may be able to spread COVID as 
well as older children and adults. A troubling finding for the young who are often in close 
quarters in schools and day cares." NBC's Dr. John Torres: "I think the study should have people 
think for a second about what we need to do to make sure that when we reopen schools, we're 
doing it in a safe manner. We can't assume that children don't get coronavirus or spread 
coronavirus."

Silver acknowledges the league's staying power amid this virus is no slam dunk." Silver: "If we 
have any significant spread whatsoever, we would certainly stop immediately and investigate 
whether we could move forward." On Thursday, the league announced new safety protocols. 
WPost: Gohmert Face Of GOP Coronavirus Ignorance. 
The Washington Post (7/30, 14.2M) editorializes that "it was a slip of the tongue," but House 
Minority Leader McCarthy's "reference to fellow Republican Rep. Louie Gohmert as 
'Congressman Covid' could not have been more apt. No one puts a better face on the 
heedlessness and ignorance that have helped fuel the spread of the deadly coronavirus than the 
Texas congressman who has made it a political badge of honor not to wear a mask."

Judge Blocks Administration's Green Card Eligibility Rules. 
The New York Times (7/30, Vigdor, 18.61M) reports that on Wednesday, "a federal judge 
blocked the Trump administration...from moving forward with plans to deny green cards to 
immigrants who have received Medicaid, food stamps or housing vouchers, even on a limited 
basis - a wealth test challenged by New York and other states in light of the coronavirus 
pandemic." Judge George B. Daniels of the US District Court in Manhattan "granted a 
nationwide temporary injunction, suspending the eligibility requirements that were introduced 
last year and have drawn several legal challenges, including before the Supreme Court." The 
Times says the Supreme Court "ruled in January that the Trump administration could move 
forward with the plan, but that was before the pandemic."

to be falsified," was "notified by the federal authorities this week that she had been placed in 
removal proceedings that could result in deportation. She can remain in the country only if an 
immigration judge approves her petition for asylum."
