Re: [External] 
Just last night I was reading an interview with my former teacher, Leonard =ernstein, where he was saying that Mozart 
was all about resolving into the=dominant. Ending a piece on a diminished 9th would be very cool. Would no= invoke 
much finality, but would be original!

I would much rather talk to you re do we end the piece with a diminished =inth or thirteenth. . a bit spooky if not in 
the dominant. . or if =e do is it preceded by a major 7th or 6th. is the key d major or minor =. will that change the 
resolution of the 7th. 
Is the tempo consistant=throught. should we put in some fortissimo otherwise it is boring. 
however what i hear is my music guys and the people here say you must al=ays resolve into the dominant key. and 
they read an article that said i= you dont , you will violate the basic principals that they write their mu=ic by. :):):)/ . 
and brads questions are why is a major chord ma=e up of thirds. AHHHHHHHHHHGHHHGHHGH

I feel like we have examined virtually all aspects of what you mention. Sti=I doing our work on publishing. Haven't 
discussed a Phaidon book on the c=llection. For publication? 
Haven't discussed gaming either. 
Would be glad to know more specifics on any of this.
