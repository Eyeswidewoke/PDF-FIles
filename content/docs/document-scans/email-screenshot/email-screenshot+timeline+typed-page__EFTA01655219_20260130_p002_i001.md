the new director has worked tirelessly since taking office. "Director Patel is working day and night to lead the Bureau and protect the homeland," he 
added. "The results so far speak for themselves — and we are Just getting started!' The article highlighted that the bureau has shifted resources to 
reflect the Trump administration's priorities of targeting Mexican drug cartels and Central American gangs, and FBI agents have had to help with 
immigration enforcement. But FBI agents are also still pursuing their traditional missions of countering terrorism, hunting spies, and investigating various 
federal crimes. On Thursday, in testimony to the Senate, Director Patel said he supported a White House budget proposal that includes a 5% cut in the 
FBI's budget. "My view is that we will make and agree with this budget as it stands," he said, "and make it work for the operational necessity of the 
F8l." Additional reporting on the story was provided by The Daily Beast (05/09, Brancolini), Fcnnnmic Times (05/10, Staff Writer), Independent (05/09,

Newark Mayor Denies Trespassing at Immigration Detention Center Following Arrest 
The Associated Press (05/10, Offenhartz, Lauer, Shipkowski) reported that Newark Mayor Ras Baraka on Saturday denied trespassing at a new federal 
immigration detention center during a confrontation that led to his arrest while the Democrat was at the facility with three members of Congress. 
According to the article, Baraka, who has been protesting the center's opening this week, was released around B p.m. Friday after spending several hours 
in custody. He was accused of trespassing and ignoring warnings to leave the Delaney Hall facility. "I'm shocked by all the lies that were told here," 
Baraka said, who said he had been invited there for a press conference. "No one else arrested, I was invited in, then they arrested me on the sidewalk!' 
The article explained that Baratta, who is running to succeed term-limited Gov. Phil Murphy, has embraced the fight with the Trump administration over 
Illegal immigration. He has aggressively pushed back against the construction and opening of a 1,000-bed detention center, arguing that it should not be 
allowed to open because of building permit issues. The article noted that video footage of the incident showed Baraka being arrested by ICE agents on 
the public side of the gate, with witnesses describing a heated argument and physical altercation between Baraka and federal officials. Additional

Judge Pauses Much of Trump Administration's Massive Downsizing of Federal Agencies 
Reuters (05/09, Hals, Singh) reported that a federal judge, U.S. District Judge Susan Illston, has temporarily halted the Trump administration's 
government overhaul due to a lack of Congressional authorization. The Judge blocked large-scale mass layoffs for 14 days, stating that the President may 
only restructure federal agencies when authorized by Congress. A hearing Is set for May 22 to consider a longer-lasting preliminary injunction, with the 
Judge indicating that the plaintiffs are likely to succeed on some of their claims that Trump exceeded his authority. Additional reporting on the story was

Families of Sept. 11 Victims Urge Lutnick to Help Extradite Saudi National 
The New York Times (05/11, Green, Haberman) reported that the families of Sept. 11 victims who worked for Cantor Fitzgerald are urging Commerce 
Secretary Howard Lutnick to help extradite Omar al-Bayoumi, a Saudi national potentially involved in the attacks. The families cite recently unsealed 
evidence showing al-Bayoumi's ties to the attackers and are asking Lutnick to make the case for his extradition during upcoming economic talks with 
Saudi Arabia. Lutnick, who lost his brother and 658 employees in the attack, is accompanying President Trump to Saudi Arabia, and the families hope he 
will use his position to push for accountability and justice. The article highlighted that British authorities turned the material over to the F.B.I. for its 
investigation of the attacks. But it remains unclear what happened to the drawing after that. It was not shared with the 9/11 Commission, a bipartisan 
group of lawmakers and experts responsible for writing the definitive account of the attacks. In its 2004 report, the commission called al-Bayoumi "an 
unlikely candidate for clandestine involvement with Islamic extremists!' 
Wove of Documents Unsealed in NYC Mayor's Criminal Case Offers a Glimpse of Thwarted Investigation 
The Associated Press (05/09, Offenhartz, Sisak) reported that federal agents investigating New York City Mayor Eric Adams were still seizing phones and 
applying for search warrants days before Justice Department leaders ordered prosecutors to drop the corruption case, according to documents released 
Friday. According to the article, the trove of court records, which had been sealed, opens a window into the criminal case and shows that even as 
Washington officials were backing away from the prosecution, investigators in Manhattan were moving forward. The documents also confirm something 
prosecutors revealed previously: That a federal investigation into whether Adams took improper campaign contributions began in August of 2021, when 
the Democrat was still in his old job of Brooklyn borough president but was widely expected to win the mayor's race that fall. Adams has repeatedly said 
he believed he was prosecuted because, much later, as mayor, he criticized former President Joe Biden's immigration policies. The article mentioned that 
the investigation first spilled into public view in November 2023, when FBI agents seized Adams' phones and IPad as he was leaving an event in 
Manhattan. He was charged 10 months later with accepting free travel and illegal campaign contributions from people seeking to buy his influence, 
including a Turkish diplomat. The New York Times (05/10, Rashbaum, Rothfeld, Rubinstein), Politico (05/09, Anuta, Coltin), the City (05/09, Smith, 
Gonen, Honan), nlewsnation (05/10, Lee), Gothamist (05/09, Max), Newyork Dally

Nis= (05/09, Fernandes) reported that a woman who threatened and beat two women, who were coerced to come to the United States and then 
forced to work non-stop, is headed to prison. Bolaji Bolarinwa, SO, of Moorestown, was sentenced on Friday to three years and nine months in federal 
prison, the U.S. Attorney's Office District of New Jersey said in a statement. A Jury convicted her last year of two counts of forced labor, two counts of 
document servitude and one count of alien harboring for financial gain. The article stated that her husband, 68-year-old Islaka Bolarinwa, was convicted 
of two counts of forced labor and one count of alien harboring for financial gain at the same trial. Prosecutors did not provide a date for his sentencing. 
Between December 2015 and October 2016, the Bolarinwas, originally from Nigeria but living in Burlington County as U.S. citizens, recruited two women
