former FBI Director James Comey, who oversaw the Crossfire Hurricane probe, has been charged with making false

Director Patel Visited China to Talk Fentanyl, Law Enforcement, Sources Say 
Reuters (11/10, Chen, Slodkowski) reported that Director Patel visited China last week to discuss fentanyl and law 
enforcement issues with Chinese officials, marking a significant development in the efforts of the two countries to 
address the flow of the deadly synthetic opioid. The visit, which was not officially announced by either the US or 
China, took place after a summit between President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, where both leaden 
hailed a "consensus" on the matter of fentanyl and law enforcement cooperation. The article explained that 
President Trump has said that Jinping will work "very hard to stop the flow" of fentanyl, which is the leading cause 
of American overdose deaths, and as a result, the US has halved the tariffs on Chinese goods imposed as a 
punishment over the flow of fentanyl to 10%. The article noted that Chinese officials have vehemently defended 
their record on fentanyl, saying they have already taken extensive action to regulate precursor chemicals used to 
make the drug, and have accused Washington of using the issue as "blackmail", while US Treasury Secretary Scott 
Bessent has said that the details of the fresh consensus will be hashed out through the new bilateral working 
group. 
Director Patel's Jet Use on Par With Predecessors but His Changes Are Saving Tax Dollars 
Just the News (11/09, Dunleavy, Solomon) reported that Director Patel's use of a government jet is similar to that 
of his predecessors, James Comey and Christopher Wray, with Director Patel averaging 2.48 flights per week. 
According to the article, Director Patel has taken steps to save taxpayers money by avoiding commercial airports 
and their expensive landing fees, instead using regional government-owned airports, which has likely saved the 
government substantial money. The article noted that the FBI contends that Director Patel's decision to use 
regional airports has saved around $2.2 million compared to Wray's use of Reagan National Airport, and Director 
Patel pays reimbursement in advance for personal travel, following Office of Management and Budget rules. The 
article highlighted that FBI spokesman Ben Williamson said on X in late October that the criticisms of Director 
Patel's travel are disingenuous. "FBI Directors are 'required use travelers' under federal regulations — meaning they 
are mandated by Congress to travel on a government plane, even on personal travel," Williamson said. "They're 
actually barred from flying commercial. The reason for this is to maintain access to secure communications 
equipment in the event of an emergency." Williamson argued on X in late October that "this FBI has taken steps to 
dramatically reduce costs of Director travel, both official and personal" and that "when Kash flies, he chooses to 
take a government airfield vs. airports like DCA, because the government option is about 2.5x cheaper." 
DOJ Moved "Swiftly and Decisively" to Stop ISIS-Linked Halloween Terror Plot Targeting Jews 
Fox News (11/08, Baehr) reported that federal prosecutors said the FBI dismantled an ISIS-linked network spanning 
from Michigan to New Jersey, charging several young men accused of plotting a Halloween mass shooting and 
conspiring to join the Islamic State. The Justice Department described the case as a "sprawling federal 
investigation," with US Attorney Alina Habba stating that the New Jersey defendants "had pledged themselves to 
ISIS" and that the department would "continue to move swiftly and decisively whenever terrorism or hate 
threatens our communities." According to the article, FBI agents seized firearms, ammunition, tactical vests, and 
GoPro cameras during Oct. 31 raids in Michigan, and the FBI's Detroit office said the agency would "continue to 
investigate, arrest and disrupt all attempts or plots to do harm ... to defend the homeland!' The article explained 
that US Attorney Jerome F. Gorgon Jr. in Detroit vowed to "follow the tentacles where they lead," while Habba 
praised coordination between the FBI's Michigan and New Jersey offices as "a model of coordination against 
extremist threats:' The article noted that FBI Special Agent Jennifer Runyan emphasized her team's commitment to 
ongoing investigations into the "Muslimeen" chat group, where suspects allegedly discussed the "pumpkin" 
timeline for an ISIS-inspired Halloween attack. Detroit News (11/08, Snell) reported that FBI counter-terrorism 
agents used a secret surveillance tool to investigate a group of individuals, including juveniles and adults from 
Michigan, who were allegedly planning a domestic terror attack on behalf of the Islamic State. The investigation,
