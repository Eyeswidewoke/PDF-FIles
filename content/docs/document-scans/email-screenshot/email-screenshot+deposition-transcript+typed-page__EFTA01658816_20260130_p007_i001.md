may look different than you've seen in the past, and with more Americans voting absentee, it 
will take longer to tabulate and report complete results." In addition to offering fact-checking on 
the CISA's website, Krebs' agency showed with evidence "the 2020 election `was the most 
secure in American history.' 
Voting Machine Company, State Officials Threatened, Harassed In Aftermath Of 
Election. 
ABC News (11/19, Rubin, Bruggeman, Mosk, 2.97M) reports that Dominion Voting Machines' 
"employees have been the subject of threats and online harassment" following "two weeks of 
false fraud claims from President Donald Trump." Trump "has tweeted or retweeted more than a 
dozen false claims about Dominion Voting Systems used across the country to his 89 million 
followers, calling the company `horrible, inaccurate and anything but secure,' despite no 
credible evidence to suggest its platforms were compromised in any way." The President has 
"resorted to promulgating progressively more outlandish claims online as part of an effort to 
delegitimize the outcome of the election." 
The Hill (11/19, Bowden, 2.98M) reports, "Election agencies or law enforcement 
organizations in five states, Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada and Pennsylvania, have 
witnessed threats or `acute security risks' to officials" connected to the election. In 
Pennsylvania, the FBI "arrested two Virginia men on firearms charges after receiving threats to 
`straighten things out,' the Philadelphia Inquirer first reported." Other states have also "been 
the site of protests against election officials in recent days following the results of the 
presidential election." Election Assistance Commission Benjamin Hovland said, "I've heard from 
election officials that they're concerned about the safety of their staff." Election Reform Program 
Director Lawrence Norden said, "There's no question in my mind that this is unprecedented in 
the personal attacks on election officials." 
Facebook: 180 Million Posts Debunked Ahead Of Election Day. 
The Washington Post (11/19, Lerman, Kelly, 14.2M) reports, "Facebook on Thursday said it 
slapped warnings on more than 180 million pieces of content that were debunked by fact-
checkers during the lead-up to the 2020 presidential election." The social media giant "also 
removed more than 265,000 pieces of content" in the US "for voter interference" between 
March 1 and November 3. It "did not reveal how effective its labels are, except to say that 
when a label obscures a post, 95 percent of people do not click to see what is behind the 
warning screen." Facebook's AI system "are getting significantly better at rooting out posts with 
hate speech, even as the content continues to proliferate on its social media sites," according to 
the company. Its technology "now identifies 95 percent of hate speech posts that the company 
eventually removes before a user reports them. Nearly three years ago, the AI proactively 
found about 24 percent of the violating posts." 
Media: Delayed Transition Creating "Gap" Between Biden, Harris Classified Briefings. 
Politico (11/19, Bertrand, 4.29M) reports, "President Donald Trump's refusal to concede to 
President-elect Joe Biden has resulted in an unusual national security predicament." As Sen. 
Kamala Harris (D-CA) cannot discuss the classified information she "is privy to" with former 
Vice President Biden, there is an "awkward gap between what Biden and Harris know about the 
biggest national security threats facing the country." Harris, as "a member of the Senate 
Intelligence Committee," has "access to regular classified briefings and documents up to the 
top-secret level, and can request intelligence briefings on specific topics," according to former 
CIA officer David Priess. Biden "will not be allowed access to classified information or any 
members of the intelligence community until the General Services Administration officially 
`ascertains' him as the president-elect." According to an unnamed transition official, "Harris's 
work on the Intelligence Committee `is entirely separate from her role as the Vice President-
Elect. There is no co-mingling of those roles and responsibilities whatsoever.'
