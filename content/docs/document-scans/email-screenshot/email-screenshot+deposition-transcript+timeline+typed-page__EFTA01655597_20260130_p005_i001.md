have traded memes and satirical clips celebrating him, offering a rare moment of levity as dismay and deep unease 
set in across the FBI and as Driscoll navigates the political perils of Washington and a president who is deeply 
hostile to the agency. The article stated that a heated confrontation on Friday with top Dal officials left many 
wondering at the time whether Driscoll had been fired. Scrutinizing agents and others involved in the sprawling 
investigation into the Capitol riot would touch a startling number of people: The FBI opened about 2,400 cases that 
involved about 6,000 intelligence analysts, agents, and other employees. In a defiant email Friday night, James 
Dennehy, the top agent in the New York field office, warned his staff that the FBI was "in the middle of a battle of 
our own." Praising Driscoll and his deputy, Robert C. Kissane, as "warriors," Dennehy asserted they were "fighting 
for this organization." In fact, Kissane, the top counterterrorism agent in New York, had been widely believed to be 
in line to be acting director, several current and former agents said, with Driscoll as the No. 2 official. However, 
when the White House unveiled its website to reflect its staff under the Trump administration, Driscoll was 
identified as the Bureau's chief. 
Continued Reporting: FBI's UFO Unit Fear Trump's January 6 Purge 
The Register (02/04, Lyons) reported that a previously undisclosed group of FBI agents who investigate UFOs, or 
"unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs)," are worried they may not survive an impending Trump-led political 
purge. The article added that some of these FBI agents may have also played a role in investigating those involved 
in the January 6 insurrection. The FBI's secretive group reportedly consists of more than a dozen agents across the 
US who dedicate significant time to track down UAPs. An FBI spokesperson said that the Bureau has "no comment" 
on personnel matters but added: "The FBI investigates Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena when there is 
potential for a violation of federal law - particularly unlawful acts that could adversely affect our national interests -
and to gather, share, and analyze intelligence to combat security threats facing the U.S." Newsnation (02/04, 
Whiteside) and the Independent (02/04, Lubin) also reported on the story. 
FBI's Top Agent in Miami Forced Out by Trump's DOJ in Escalating Purge 
The Miami Herald (02/04, Weaver) reported that Jeffrey Veltri was named as head of the FBI's Miami field office in 
March 2023, seven months after federal agents raided Donald Trump's Palm Beach estate in a search for classified 
documents that he allegedly took to Mar-a-Lago after losing the presidency. According to the article, Veltri has 
been forced out in an escalating purge by senior officials in the DOJ who took over the agency after Trump was 
sworn in as president for a second term last month. Veltri, like about a dozen high-ranking FBI officials in 
Washington, D.C., and in field offices around the country, was given an ultimatum: retire, resign, or be fired by 
Monday. Veltri, 50, chose to resign on Friday, according to several sources familiar with his departure. Veltri was 
immediately replaced in the Miami field office by an acting special agent in charge, Justin Fleck. He's an 18-year FBI 
veteran who previously worked as a deputy in the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office after graduating from Florida 
State University. 
The FBI Has Changed Leadership in New Orleans 
Nola.com (02/04, Simerman) reported that the FBI has reassigned the leader of its New Orleans field office, Lyonel 
Myrthil, the Bureau confirmed on Monday, one of several leadership shuffles at the FBI since President Donald 
Trump's inauguration. Replacing Myrthil on an interim basis is Stephen Cyrus, Special Agent in Charge of the Kansas 
City field office, the FBI said. Cyrus introduced himself as the FBI's new leader in New Orleans at a news conference 
Monday morning in the French Quarter. Cyrus said Monday that "SAC Myrthil is currently on assignment at 
headquarters in Washington helping to implement some of the new administration's executive orders." The FBI's 
national press office said in a statement Monday afternoon that Cyrus was named to the interim post "due to the 
recent reassignment of former SAC Lyonel Myrthil." 
Opinion: FBI Agents Risk Their Lives for Us. They Deserve Fair Treatment, Not Political Purging 
An opinion piece by the Miami Herald (02/04, Martinez, Jimenez) stated that in a quiet residential area of Miami 
sits a largely unnoticed plaque that reads: In memory of these two FBI agents who gave their lives in the line of 
duty during a gun battle at this site on April 11, 1986. The two agents were Jerry Dove and Ben Grogan. Other FBI 
agents were also seriously injured on that day during a gun battle with two very dangerous bank robbers who had 
committed a series of violent crimes in the Miami metropolitan area. These agents died or were seriously injured 
protecting the public. The author mentioned that more recently, on Feb. 2, 2021, FBI agents Daniel Alfin and Laura 
Schwartzenberger were shot and killed while executing a search warrant in Sunrise as part of an investigation 
involving child pornography and violent crimes against children. They were also assigned to the Miami Field Office.
