What To Know About A Large-Scale Immigration Raid At A Georgia Manufacturing Plant 
The Associated Press (09/06, Golden) and Reuters (09/06, lin) reported that federal agents detained 475 workers—
most of them South Korean nationals—during a large-scale immigration raid at a Hyundai manufacturing complex 
in Georgia, described by officials as the "largest single site enforcement operation" in Homeland Security 
Investigations' two-decade history. According to the articles, the raid stemmed from a months-long investigation 
into illegal hiring practices at the $7.6 billion Hyundai site and its adjacent HL-GA Battery Co. plant, a Hyundai—LG 
Energy Solution joint venture, though prosecutors admitted in court filings they do not yet know which contractor 
or company hired the undocumented workers. The articles explained that the South Korean government expressed 
"concern and regret" and is sending diplomats after confirming more than 300 of its citizens were detained, while 
advocacy groups criticized the raid as "unacceptable," citing families struggling to locate relatives held at a 
detention center in Folkston, Georgia. Hyundai and LG said they are reviewing their suppliers' compliance with U.S. 
employment laws, while Georgia officials emphasized that all employers in the state must follow immigration 
regulations. The articles noted that the raid has sparked mixed reactions locally, with some community members 
worried about economic fallout and others questioning whether the plant has delivered jobs for area residents as 
promised. The Times of India (09/07, Staff Writer) highlighted that the raid, code-named "Operation Low Voltage," 
was the result of months of planning by multiple agencies, including the FBI. Additional reporting on the story was
