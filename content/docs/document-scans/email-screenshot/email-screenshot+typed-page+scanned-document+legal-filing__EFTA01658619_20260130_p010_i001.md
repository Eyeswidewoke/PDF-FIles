The Guardian (UK) (9/22, Karp, 4.19M) reports far-right violent extremism constitutes "up to 
40% of the Australian domestic spy agency's counter-terrorism caseload, up from 10-15% 
before 2016, a senior official has said." The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation's 
(ASIO) "extraordinary increase in focus on the far right in Australia was revealed by its deputy 
director general of intelligence service delivery, Heather Cook, at a parliamentary inquiry on 
Tuesday." Cook called it an "enduring threat" that is "real and growing," and while she would 
not detail specific numbers of people under investigation, said "rightwing violent extremism... 
occupies approximately between 30 and 40% of Asio's current caseload in counter-terrorism 
work...an increase from 10 to 15% prior to 2016." Cook also "warned the Covid-19 pandemic 
had created both a greater opportunity for far-right extremists to recruit online and a powerful 
anti-government message for those that resent lockdowns to combat the pandemic." 
COUNTER-INTELLIGENCE 
China Calls Spying Allegations Against NYPD Officer "Pure Fabrication." 
The AP (9/22) reports, "China on Tuesday said allegations against a New York City police officer 
charged with being an 'intelligence asset' for the Chinese government are a 'pure fabrication' 
and part of a U.S. plot to smear Chinese diplomats in the United States." Baimadajie Angwang, 
"a naturalized U.S. citizen from Tibet, allegedly agreed to spy on U.S. supporters of the Tibetan 
independence movement since 2018 as an agent for China in its effort to suppress the 
movement, according to a criminal complaint filed in Brooklyn federal court. It says he secretly 
worked for unnamed handlers from the Chinese Consulate in New York." The AP adds, "Chinese 
foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin on Tuesday said the indictment against Angwang 
was full of hedging terms such as 'seems' and 'possibly,' giving the appearance that prosecutors 
were straining to make their case." 
The New York Post (9/22, Fonrouge, 4.57M) reports that Wang Wenbin told reporters, 
"The relevant accusations made by the US side are pure fabrication," adding that "the US plot 
to discredit the Chinese consulate and personnel in the United States will not succeed." 
NYPD Officer Accused Of Spying For China Raised Suspicions At Party Attended 
By AOC. The New York Post (9/22, Celona, Fonrouge, Golding, 4.57M) reports the NYPD 
officer charged this week with spying for China "raised alarms at a Tibetan New Year party that 
he attended in uniform — and during which he was photographed sitting next to US Rep. 
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez." Sonam Gyephel, a former president of the Tibetan Community of NY 
& NJ, "said the group became suspicious" of Officer Baimadajie Angwang, and "cut off the 
relationship" with him following the event last year. Gyephel "declined to say precisely what 
alerted members" to the officer. 
The New York Post (9/22, Fonrouge, Golding, 4.57M) reports that Angwang "exaggerated 
his military service record to his brothers in blue, The Post has learned." Angwang, "a 
suspended community affairs officer with the NYPD's 111th Precinct in Queens, was honored by 
the Police Benevolent Association at a November event last year to celebrate veterans, 
according to a since-deleted Facebook post on the union's page. 'The PBA honored its veterans 
at today's delegates meeting with PO Baimadajie Angwang presenting the colors. PO Angwang 
is a Sgt. in the USMC and served 1 tour in Iraq and 2 tours in Afghanistan,' the post reads 
alongside photos of Angwang posing with the union brass." The USMC "confirmed in a 
statement that Angwang, 33, was in fact a sergeant with the Devil Dogs but said he only served 
one tour in Afghanistan for Operation Enduring Freedom between July 2013 and February 2014. 
There were no records of a second Afghanistan tour or a tour in Iraq, according to the USMC."
