Re: Thanks 
I agree we need a top-down! Two thoughts: 
-- Yes, developing mapping circuit technology and then applying it to simple behaviors -- hard wired aversive stuff -- is 
indeed a way to go. As we plan out these mapping technologies, we're actually beginning experiments to map out these 
aversive things too. We are collaborating with many groups along these lines. We need to finish the fundamental 
technology building so that we can obtain maps at the right level, and then we can acquire datasets that are compatible 
with top-down theory, to be sure. 
-- Another way to think top-down is to work our way inwards, from the observables. We know that behavior --
movement, speech, other action 
-- is observable; if a feeling or thought is prominent enough, it will be manifest through these channels as an observable. 
Thus we can also try to infer internal states by their effects on observables, and then to associate neural activity with 
these internal states and observables. In theory this should scale to arbitrarily complex internal states, not just simple 
aversive states. 
Best, 
Ed
