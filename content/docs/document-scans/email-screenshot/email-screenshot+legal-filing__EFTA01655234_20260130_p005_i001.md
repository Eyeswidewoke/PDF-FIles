by the FBI so far, according to federal agents. "These arrests are the largest takedown of suspected Anti-Tren 
members and associates by the FBI, so far, and they happened right here in Houston," said Special Agent in Charge 
Douglas Williams of the FBI Houston Field Office. "These individuals are accused of engaging in a turf war with TdA 
members and carrying out numerous violent crimes throughout our city, including a mass shooting at a local sports 
bar that left six people wounded. Fortunately, for the good and safety of our community, these individuals are now 
in federal custody facing U.S. justice." 
Lone Wolf Actor Biggest Threat to 4th of July Festivities in New York, San Francisco 
ABC News (07/01, Barr) reported that the FBI and DHS have identified lone wolf actors as the biggest threat to 4th 
of July celebrations in New York and San Francisco. The threat includes potential copycat attacks inspired by the 
New Orleans terror attack and homegrown extremists motivated by various grievances. Authorities are also 
concerned about malicious actors exploiting demonstrations, using drones, and targeting large gatherings due to 
the conflict in the Middle East and bias against certain communities. Additional reporting on the story was 
provided by KGO (ABC-7) (07/01, Noyes) and New York Daily News (07/01, Matthews). 
Continued Reporting: Probe Into Idaho Firefighter Ambush Suspect Digging Into Childhood, Gun 
Familiarity 
ABC News (07/01, Levine, Pezenik, et al.) reported that the investigation into the Idaho firefighter ambush is 
ongoing, with authorities trying to determine the motive behind suspect Wess Roley's alleged actions. Roley, who 
was found dead with a shotgun and cell phone, is believed to have acted alone and had no connection to 
terrorism, according to Idaho police. The article highlighted that the FBI is taking the lead in the technical 
processing of the phone and what it holds, officials said in an update Tuesday night. Officials hope to exploit the 
contents of the device to glean any potential insight into a possible motive. In an interview on Tuesday, a former 
classmate of Roley's said that while the alleged sniper was always "really different," he still has "a hard time trying 
to correlate the same Wess that I grew up with to the Wess that did what he did." Dieter claimed Roley was 
someone who talked about Nazism, who was "very pro-gun," who spoke of wanting to join the military, who would 
often make drawings of bombs and military vehicles and who allegedly got in trouble once for drawing swastikas in 
a textbook. Additional reporting on the story was provided by Daily Mail (07/01, Hutchinson), Men's Journal 
(07/01, McBride), NBC News (07/01, Burke), New York Post (07/01, Oliveira), USA Today (07/01, Santucci), and 
Washington Examiner (07/01, Zimmermann).

murder of her 6-year-old son, Noel Rodriguez Alvarez, is now on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted list, authorities said 
Tuesday. A Tarrant County grand jury indicted Rodriguez Singh in October 2023 on capital murder and additional 
charges related to the disappearance of her son, who was reported missing in 2022. According to the article, the 
FBI has also increased the reward leading to her arrest, from $25,000 to $250,000. The FBI said it is confident that 
the increased reward will lead to her arrest. Joe Rothrock, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Dallas Field Office, 
said that law enforcement has been working diligently to locate Noel with the common goal of finding 
him. "Cindy's last confirmed sighting was on March 22, 2023, as she, her husband, and six juvenile children 
boarded an international flight bound for India," said Rothrock. "Noel was not with them, did not board that flight."

The Associated Press (07/01, Valdes, Johnson, Boone) reported that Bryan Kohberger 's attorneys had done what 
they could to spare his life.According to the article, they tried to bar prosecutors from seeking the death penalty in 
the stabbing deaths of four University of Idaho students on an array of grounds — that it would violate standards 
of decency or flout international law, that prosecutors had failed to provide evidence properly, that their client's 
autism diagnosis reduced any possible culpability. They challenged the legitimacy of DNA evidence and sought 
permission to suggest to a jury that someone else committed the crime. None of it worked. And with Kohberger's
