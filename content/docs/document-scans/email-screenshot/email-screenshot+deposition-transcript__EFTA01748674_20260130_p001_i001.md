Subject: Re: Library 
Dear Richard, 
For the first time in my life, I am facing the real prospect of dismissal from the project. 
This is due mainly to misunderstanding. 
Mr. Epstein came today and told me very bluntly that he is annoyed with me not doing the job. I prepared 
one column for him and the several feet of decorative molding, but this was a miss. He told me it looks like 
it was done yesterday. 
This is the very first time that I work like this. I did several projects for French customers in Greenwich, Conn., 
but always I produced the sample and than work 
according to the samples. The paneling I work on were early 19 c. so even the oak looked different. Even at 
the White House, when I was restoring Blue Room, which you can look at it on my Website, 
www.brandonthompsonrestoration.com I produced design, made samples and did the project. President 
Clinton told me this is the most beautiful Room, he was clearly impressed. 
This time I know exactly what Mr. Epstein wants. However it might be too late. He will come tomorrow to 
check. 
Today I did a lot of prep work for tomorrow. I will go tonight to work on some of the columns but the night 
light is deceiving and I may miss the last chance he gave me. 
So far I was rated the best finisher, until now I guess. 
Warm regards 
Brandon

Dear Richard, 
the samples are ready for approval. I finished one column about 95%, as I want to put some accents on it 
but after I discuss it with Mr. Epstein. I also finished upper section above the blackboard. I also finished 
some other columns, not completely, because I need the approval. My feeling is that someone was 
already working in the Library, as I can see a lot of waxing done. I finished one column so it will 
correspond with the rest of the decor. You can not remove the whitish color completely. There are some 
"bald" columns, which in my opinion do not sort of belong to the Library any more as they are completely 
brown. Everything has to have at least an shadow of what is around. The top carving, moldings columns 
and other elements in the Library, have to "bond" together. The upper small carvings, have to be finished 
individually, as a play between the whitish color and natural brown color of oak wood. I sort of model the 
shapes of the crabs, snails and other creatures and they come alive. I think I did good work but Mr. 
Epstein needs to approve it so I can go ahead and finish the project. 
Kindly,
