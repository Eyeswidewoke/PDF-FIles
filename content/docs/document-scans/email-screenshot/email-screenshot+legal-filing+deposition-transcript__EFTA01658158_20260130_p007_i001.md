Homeland Security." Washington Governor Jay Inslee (D) "warned federal officers might 'make 
the thing worse and throw gasoline on a fire." 
Seattle Police Clash With Demonstrators. The Wall Street Journal (7/25, Ansari, 
Subscription Publication, 7.57M) reports police officials in Seattle indicated that officers and 
demonstrators clashed in confrontations on Saturday. The demonstrations occurred in the wake 
of US District Judge James Robart on Friday having temporarily blocked a city law that would 
forbid police from utilizing tear gas. 
The AP (7/25, Ho, Grygiel) reports, "Seattle police declared a riot...following large 
demonstrations in the city's Capitol Hill neighborhood and deployed flash bangs and pepper 
spray to try to clear an area near where weeks earlier people had set up an 'occupied protest 
zone' that stretched for several blocks." Police tweeted that "they had made more than two 
dozen arrests for assault on officers, obstruction and failure to disperse." The AP adds, "They 
also said they were 'investigating a possible explosive damage' to the walls of the city's East 
Precinct police station." Authorities indicate that various projectiles, including bottles and 
mortars, were thrown "at officers as they attempted to clear the area over the course of several 
hours stretching into Saturday night. One officer was hospitalized with a leg injury caused by an 
explosive." 
Judge Orders Seattle Media To Turn Over Photos, Videos Of Rioters. The 
Washington Post (7/24, Elfrink, 14.2M) reports King County Superior Court Judge Nelson Lee on 
Thursday "ordered five news organizations to turn over...unpublished material" that would help 
police identify violent rioters in downtown Seattle "smashed windows, set police cars on fire and 
looted businesses." Seattle Times executive editor Michele Matassa Flores warned the decision 
could endanger reporters, arguing the media doesn't "work in concert with government, and it's 
important to our credibility and effectiveness to retain our independence from those we cover." 
Danny Gawlowski, the Times's assistant managing editor, said "the perception that a journalist 
might be collaborating with police or other public officials poses a very real, physical danger to 
journalists, particularly when they are covering protests or civil unrest...Enforcing the subpoena 
also will aggravate the distrust journalist already face in covering protests." 
Lightfoot Says She Won't Allow Federal Agents To "Play Police" In Chicago. 
The Washington Examiner (7/26, Soellner, 448K) reports Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot "remains 
adamant that she will not allow federal troops to quell her city despite President Trump's push 
to send them." Appearing on CNN's State Of The UnionVi, Lightfoot said, "We can't just allow 
anyone to come into Chicago, play police in our streets and our neighborhoods when they don't 
know the first thing about our city. That's a recipe for disaster, and that's what you're seeing 
playing out in Portland on a nightly basis. We don't need that here. That is not a value add, and 
it doesn't help enhance our public safety." 
Kansas City Mayor, New Mexico Governor Also Voice Concerns About 
Deployments. Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas (D), on Fox News SundayVi (7/26, 976K), 
said, "Our local US Attorney had contacted my office the day before a White House press 
briefing and said would you like federal support? Typically, we work with federal agencies all the 
time. The question is what type of support is it? And when we heard from the Press Secretary 
in a press conference, no real heads up on the nature of the scope and how long there was 
some surprise there. I would put it this way, yes, would we like help solving a violent crime? 
Absolutely. ... But do you want a thousand agents on the border of Kansas City with the state of 
Kansas, the answer to that would be no." 
New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham (D), on ABC's This WeekVi (7/26, 2.47M), 
said, "The issue of making sure [New Mexicans] civil rights are protected is forefront for 
everything we do every day. That stands less of a litigation threat but a re-recognition that 
we're going to put New Mexicans first. I have talked to the Attorney General and made it clear, 
we have 35 agents. ... They'll integrate into the operations that we already have, and he 
certainly gave me every indication that he's willing to do that. The interesting thing here is that
