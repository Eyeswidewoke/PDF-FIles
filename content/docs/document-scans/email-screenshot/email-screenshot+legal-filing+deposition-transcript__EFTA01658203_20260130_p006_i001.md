top-to-bottom overhaul of the force." According to veteran officers, "morale within the 
department is lower than they have ever experienced," and "some officers are scaling back their 
policing efforts, concerned that any contentious interactions on the street could land them in 
trouble." Others, meanwhile, "are calling it quits altogether." 
Minnesota Lawmakers Pass Police Accountability Measures. The Minneapolis Star 
Tribune (7/20, Bierschbach, 1.04M) reports the Minnesota state legislature passed "a sweeping 
package of police accountability measures early Tuesday morning following two months of 
touch-and-go negotiations after the killing of George Floyd." Calling the bill "one of the most 
substantial changes to the state's criminal justice system in years," the Star Tribune notes it 
"includes a statewide ban on chokeholds and neck restraints...and a prohibition on warrior-style 
training for officers." It also "enhances data collection around deadly force encounters, requires 
officers to intervene and creates a new state unit to investigate such cases." The Wall Street 
Journal (7/21, Barrett, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) reports Gov. Tim Walz (DFL) has not 
said whether he will sign the bill. 
Minneapolis Residents Propose Citywide Vote To End Police Department. The 
Minneapolis Star Tribune (7/20, Navratil, 1.04M) reports that a "public hearing Tuesday night 
was dominated by demands to allow Minneapolis residents to vote on a proposal that could end 
the city's Police Department." Dozens of residents "urged the city's Charter Commission to allow 
them to vote in November on a divisive proposal that would dramatically reshape public safety 
in the city." 
Charred Body Found Inside Minneapolis Pawn Shop Burned During Protests. The 
Washington Times (7/21, Ernst, 492K) reports that the "charred remains of a Minneapolis man 
have been found inside a pawn shop razed during the May riots." A "recent tip" to the 
Minneapolis Police Department, ATF and the state fire marshal's division "led authorities to the 
grim discovery Monday inside Max It Pawn, which was destroyed in an arson fire May 28." 
Portland Protests Continue As Trump Considers Sending Federal Officers To Chicago. 
The AP (7/21, Long, Fox, Colvin), in a piece titled "Trump's Show Of Federal Force Sparking 
Alarm In Cities," reports that President Trump's "plan to deploy federal agents to Chicago and 
perhaps other Democratic-run cities where violence is spiking represents Trump's latest effort to 
use an agency that was created after the Sept. 11 attacks to thwart terrorists to instead 
supplement local law enforcement in ways that bolster his reelection chances." Trump has 
"already deployed Homeland Security agents to Portland," and under Trump's "latest plan, yet 
to be publicly announced, about 150 Homeland Security Investigations agents would go to 
Chicago." 
According to the Wall Street Journal (7/21, Gurman, Ailworth, Subscription Publication, 
7.57M), sources familiar with the plans said more than 100 federal agents will be deployed to 
Chicago to focus on illegal gun sales, aiding federal gun prosecutions and arrests. 
USA Today (7/21, Hauck, 10.31M) reports Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot said Tuesday the 
Administration "would not be deploying unnamed federal officers to the city, as seen in Portland 
in recent days." Said the Mayor, "What I understand at this point, and I caveat that, is that the 
Trump administration is not going to foolishly deploy unnamed agents to the streets of Chicago. 
We have information that allows us to say, at least at this point, that we don't see a Portland-
style deployment coming to Chicago." Instead, she said the Administration is instead sending 
agents from the FBI, DEA and ATF. The Chicago Tribune (7/21, Pratt, Gorner, Munks, 2.65M), 
among other news outlets, also reports Lightfoot's comments. 
All three networks, meanwhile, reported Tuesday night on the ongoing protests in Portland 
and the deployment of federal agents to the city. ABC World News TonightVI (7/21, story 4, 
1:40, Muir, 7.14M) reported there were "new clashes" with "protesters facing off against federal 
agents there, despite the objections of the mayor and the governor." ABC (Whitworth) added, 
"In a 'NightlineVi ' interview, the acting DHS Deputy Secretary saying tonight those agents in 
Portland are within their rights to protect the courthouse." Acting DHS Deputy Secretary
