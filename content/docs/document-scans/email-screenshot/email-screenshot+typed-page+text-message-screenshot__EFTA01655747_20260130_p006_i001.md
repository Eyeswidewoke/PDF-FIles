The article added that these cases represent the ongoing, targeted efforts by U.S. Attorney's Offices to seize deadly

Justice Department Finds Cuomo Sexually Harassed Employees And Settles With New York State 
The Associated Press (01/26, Izaguirre) reported that a settlement announced Friday confirmed allegations from 
the damaging misconduct probe that led to the Democrat's resignation. According to the article, the U.S. Justice 
Department concluded former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo sexually harassed more than a dozen state 
employees. The article indicated that the settlement between New York and the Justice Department resolves the 
federal agency's sexual harassment investigation of Cuomo and outlines additional steps the state will take to 
change how it handles misconduct complaints. Cuomo, once a rising star in the Democratic party, the article 
continued, left office in 2021 after a report by Attorney General Letitia James concluded he sexually harassed at 
least 11 women. The article noted that he has denied wrongdoing and argued James' report was driven by politics, 
intended to force him from office so she could run for governor. The Justice Department investigation, the article 
detailed, found a similar pattern of sexual misconduct by Cuomo and said he subjected at least 13 state employees 
to a sexually hostile work environment. The report, the article elaborated, said Cuomo's staffers failed to 
adequately report allegations and retaliated against four women who raised complaints. The article added that the 
agency did not release a full report detailing its investigation but instead published a list of its findings. Politico 
(01/26, Reisman) detailed that the announcement was made as part of a civil rights settlement with his successor. 
The article detailed that the agreement concluded the governor's office under Cuomo violated federal Title VII 
rules against discrimination and retaliation between 2013 and 2021.The justice department, the article specified, 
found Cuomo "repeatedly subjected" women in his office to non-consensual sexual contact, ogling and gender-
based nicknames, while top Cuomo staff "were aware of the conduct and retaliated against four of the women he 
harassed." The article highlighted that Kristen Clarke, the assistant attorney general in the agency's civil rights 
division, said in a statement, "The conduct in the Executive Chamber under the former governor, the state's most 
powerful elected official, was especially egregious because of the stark power differential involved and the victims' 
lack of avenues to report and redress harassment:' CNN (01/26, Lybrand, Cole) noted that the department said the 
agreement "memorializes" many of the reforms enacted by Cuomo's successor, Gov. Kathy Hochul, "as well as 
additional reforms aimed at preventing sexual harassment and retaliation in the Executive Chamber." The article 
explained that the reforms include the governor's office creating a new "process for complaints against senior 
officials" so that individuals lodging complaints can have "confidence that their complaints will be handled as 
independently as possible," the Justice Department said. The governor's office, the article elaborated, will also 
have to build an "anti-retaliation monitoring policy" to help shield complainants from reprisal. The article added 
that Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke said in a statement, "With this settlement agreement, 
the Executive Chamber under Governor Hochul is undertaking additional actions that will address system failures of 
the past while helping prevent the recurrence of systemic sexual harassment and retaliation in the future." The 
Washington Post (01/26, Paybarah, Dawsey) highlighted that in announcing the settlement, the Justice Department 
also acknowledged Hochul's efforts to correct what it said had gone awry under her predecessor, with U.S. Attorney 
Breon Peace of the Eastern District of New York saying in a statement, "We appreciate the Governor's stated 
determination to make sure that sexual harassment does not recur at the highest level of New York State 
government." Bloomberg (01/26, Strohm) quoted an attorney for Cuomo, Rita Glavin, who said he "did not sexually 
harass anyone" and that the Justice Department investigation was based entirely on a "deeply flawed, inaccurate, 
biased and misleading report" in 2021 by New York Attorney General Letitia James. CNBC (01/26, Breuninger) 
highlighted that Cuomo's spokesman, Rich Azzopardi, suggested in a statement that Breon Peace, the U.S. attorney 
who signed off on the agreement, had a conflict of interest because he was the law partner of Joon Kim, who led 
the New York attorney general's 2021 investigation of Cuomo. The New York Times (01/26, Ashford) added that a 
person briefed on the Justice Department's process said the investigation included a review of the attorney 
general's report and public statements, as well as new interviews that turned up new victims. Additional reporting 
on the story was provided by Reuters (01/26, Harte), Wall Street Journal (01/26, Vielkind), The Hill (01/26, Polus),

York Post (01/26, Golden), The Guardian (01/26, Pengelly), and Salon (01/26, McClure).
