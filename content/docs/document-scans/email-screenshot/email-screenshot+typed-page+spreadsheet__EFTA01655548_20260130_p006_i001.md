state and federal law." The article further reported that CAIR responded by filing a lawsuit against Abbott, arguing 
that he lacks the authority to declare American civil rights groups as terrorist entities and warning that such 
unilateral actions threaten free speech and due process. The article noted that CAIR officials characterized Abbott's 
proclamation as a political stunt tied to criticism of U.S. policy on Gaza and said recent months have seen a surge in 
hate crimes targeting Muslims. 
Congress Takes One Step Closer to Challenging ISIS' Al Revolution 
Newsweek (11/20, O'Connor) reported that the House of Representatives unanimously passed the Generative Al 
Terrorism Risk Assessment Act, a bill introduced by Rep. August Pfluger to counter ISIS's growing use of artificial 
intelligence in propaganda, recruitment, and operational planning. Prosecutors noted that experts and intelligence 
agencies have documented ISIS and its affiliates experimenting with generative Al tools to create jihadi media, 
automate messaging, and potentially explore more advanced applications, while global security consultant David 
Wells warned that terrorist misuse of Al could escalate rapidly as barriers to entry continue to fall. According to the 
article, the bill would require the Department of Homeland Security to regularly brief Congress on AI-based 
terrorist threats, gather and disseminate related intelligence through fusion centers, and coordinate information 
sharing across federal agencies as DHS assessments already warn that ISIS-inspired actors have targeted the U.S., 
including in an FBI-foiled Halloween plot in Detroit. The article further reported that ISIS-linked attacks and plots 
continue worldwide — including recent large-scale operations by ISIS-K and deadly incidents in Europe and the U.S. 
— prompting officials like House Speaker Mike Johnson to describe the legislation as critical to preventing terrorist 
groups from exploiting generative Al to radicalize and incite violence on American soil. The article noted that 
significant obstacles remain, including the speed of Al development, declining online content-moderation 
standards, limited government technological capacity, and the need for broader multi-stakeholder cooperation, 
with experts recommending deeper engagement between law enforcement, Al companies, and tech platforms to 
anticipate and disrupt emerging AI-enabled terrorist threats.

the FBI and HSI San Antonio, and that some detainees are under investigation for human smuggling and money 
laundering. The article stated that two Honduran nationals also appeared in federal court on illegal re-entry 
charges, each facing up to two years in prison and a potential $250,000 fine. 
Florida Man Charged With Making Terror-Linked Threats While Residing in Maryland 
Hoodline (11/20, Robinson) reported that federal authorities detained 27-year-old Arsham Rashidi Dizajgan of 
Gainesville, Florida, after he was indicted on six counts of transmitting interstate threats while residing in 
Maryland. Prosecutors stated that the indictment alleges Dizajgan used TikTok between September 2024 and 
March 2025 to post imagery and language mirroring tactics linked to Hamas, including upside-down red triangles 
over the heads of Americans, alongside threatening comments. According to the article, he also allegedly posted 
content condemning Americans and non-Muslims while celebrating acts of violence against them. The article 
further reported that U.S. Attorney Kelly O. Hayes warned that "threats to the safety and security of American 
citizens will not be tolerated, particularly when such threats adopt the language and tactics of violent extremists 
and foreign terrorist organizations," while FBI Special Agent in Charge Jimmy Paul emphasized that the FBI takes 
such threats seriously to ensure "swift investigative and prosecutorial actions to prevent online vitriol from 
manifesting into tangible harm."

leadership, that the Inspection Division allowed retaliation against the reporting employee after the misconduct
