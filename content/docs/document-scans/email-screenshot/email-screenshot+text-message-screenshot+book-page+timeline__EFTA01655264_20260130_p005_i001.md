COUNTERINTELLIGENCE 
Chinese Spy Arrested on Texas University COVID Research Theft Charges 
The Center Square (07/09, Blankley) reported that Chinese national Xu Zewei, 33, has been arrested in Milan, Italy, 
for allegedly hacking a Texas university to steal COVID-19 research on behalf of the People's Republic of China. 
According to the article, Xu Zewei and another Chinese national, Zhang Yu, 44, were charged with computer 
intrusions, including the HAFNIUM hacking campaign, and stealing research from U.S.-based universities and 
immunologists. Xu Zewei awaits extradition to the United States, while Zhang Yu remains at large, with the FBI 
seeking information about his whereabouts. "While the world was reeling from a virus that originated in China, the 
Chinese government plotted to steal U.S. research critical to vaccine development," FBI Houston Special Agent in 
Charge Douglas Williams said. "Xu Zewei, an alleged hacker acting on behalf of China's primary spy agency, 
targeted COVID-19 data using sophisticated cyber techniques and tradecraft. His landmark arrest by FBI Houston 
agents in Italy proves that we will scour the ends of the earth to hold criminal foreign adversaries accountable." 
Additional reporting on the story was provided by Tampa Free Press (07/09, Grissom), TechRadar (07/09,

FISA Court Approves FBI Effort to Share New Evidence With Congress 
Just the News (07/09, Solomon, Dunleavy) reported that the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court has 
approved the Justice Department's request to review and share new evidence related to the Russiagate scandal 
with Congress, specifically regarding the FISA warrants targeting former Trump campaign associate Carter Page. 
According to the article, the DOJ is seeking to disclose information to Congress while redacting sensitive details, in 
response to requests from the GOP-led House and Senate Judiciary Committees for documents related to the 
Crossfire Hurricane investigation. The move is part of an effort to provide Congress with information to guide 
future hearings and determine if additional reforms of FISA are needed, with Director Patel working to hand over 
more evidence to Congress at the behest of President Donald Trump. The article clarified that the FBI's Crossfire 
Hurricane operation was flawed, and Special Counsel Durham's report found no evidence of collusion between the 
Trump campaign and Russia. Durham's investigation undercut the credibility of the Steele dossier, and his report 
noted that the FBI ignored the lack of corroboration for the dossier's allegations. The article noted that the Dal and 
FBI are responding to requests from Representative Jordan for documents and transcripts related to the Crossfire 
Hurricane investigation, including briefing documents and a comparison of the treatment of the Crossfire Hurricane 
and Clinton investigations.

Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, have been impersonated by malicious actors using AI-generated audio in "vishing" scams. 
According to the article, the scams involve impersonating well-known figures to manipulate officials and gain 
access to information or accounts, with the goal of exploiting them for sensitive information. The article noted that 
the FBI and other experts warn that verifying the identity of callers and being cautious of unsolicited requests for 
sensitive information can help prevent falling victim to these scams.
