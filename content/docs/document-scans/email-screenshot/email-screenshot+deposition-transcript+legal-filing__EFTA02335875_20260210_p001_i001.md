"Is my plane long range." Is that like a challenge to my manhood? You think 
when I fly, I am a short hitter? Over the past three days I have negotiated for 
42 hours. The guy I was up against is the best I have seen. In a funny way, we 
were a good match as well as a good team. Mutual respect does wonders. 
Seriously intense so you can imagine what my team thought last night when, in the 
heat of strategizing the next battle, I came up to my hotel room. They were a 
mess. I organized them, gave them their task and priorities and about 45 seconds 
after order descended, I said "sorry, I gotta go out now". My team is, I think, 
the most impressive set of brains and capabilities that I have seen on a single 
team. For some reason I don't understand, I have become the glue and the force. 
When I upped and said have a good night I thought they were going to shit. Our 
lawyer got pissed and kept grumbling at me, our CFO was fully bemused and my co 
Trustee was awestruck. They have no idea where I went. When I got back they had 
resculpted the document that we needed and today was full on focus for the 
jewels. In the end, I think I won over their lawyer's heart...but since it is 
made of ice that is of little consequence. 
There is background that is interesting in that I pulled a major U turn on 
the everyone. Their side and ours, with a totally different structure, that, I 
believe has the potential of being a ten strike... or maybe I should say an 8 
strike, meaning I got less than I had, but more than expected out of a dismal 
situation. It was fun to lead them around the U turn. The structure is, I 
think, sufficiently elegant that we have a 50% chance of pulling it off with 
aplumb, and of course plumbs are always tastey. The mental energy over the past 
month has been staggering. This has been an intense exercise in being flexible 
and creative with attitude, law, business, psychology and a whole lot of raw ass 
power. 
That's your lot. Don't stick this fucking email in your hot file. Just 
delete it and cut the complusive shit. I have no idea if I will pull Moscow. I 
don't see how, but I don't give up so easily. Problem is that I get word from 
the other side on Friday and I suspect I can't be too far away...but....
