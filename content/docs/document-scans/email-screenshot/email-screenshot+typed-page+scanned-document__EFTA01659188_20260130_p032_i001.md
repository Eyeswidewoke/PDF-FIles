Jenner Expresses Support For US-Mexico Border Wall. 
Politico (5/5, Marinucci, 6.73M) reports California gubernatorial candidate Caitlyn Jenner (R) 
"told Fox News that she is `all for the wall' - former President Trump's controversial southern 
border effort - and called it crucial to control" migration. In her "first major television interview 
since she entered the California governor's race nearly two weeks ago," Jenner told Sean 
Hannity, "I am all for the wall, I would secure the wall. We can't have a state, we can't have a 
country without a secure wall." 
Hohmann Says Virginia GOP Likely To Throw Away Chance At Gubernatorial Win. 
James Hohmann writes in the Washington Post (5/5, 10.52M) that the Virginia gubernatorial 
race is winnable for Republicans if the party "pick[s] someone electable" at their convention this 
weekend. However, Hohmann writes, "such rational behavior is not a given in this moment, as 
reflected by the expected purge" of Rep. Liz Cheney (R-WY) from the House leadership. 
Hohmann writes, "Virginia Republicans have reacted to a decade of losses by moving further 
outside the mainstream." They have "a chance to break the fever this weekend. Don't hold your 
breath." 
Adams Leads Yang In NYC Democratic Mayoral Primary Poll. 
Politico (5/5, 6.73M) reports, "Eric Adams is leading the field of [New York City] mayoral 
candidates in a new poll, marking the first time Andrew Yang is not the top contender since he 
shook up the race with his unexpected entry in mid-January." The GQR poll of 500 likely 
Democratic primary voters, "conducted over the course of three days last week," shows Adams 
at 21%, Yang 18%, and City Comptroller Scott Stringer 15%, with no other candidate 
"crack[ing] double digits."

WPost Analysis: Biden Shuns Trump-Friendly "Strongmen." 
The Washington Post (5/5, Gearan, 10.52M) reports that "a host of strongmen and nationalists 
who cozied up to" then-President Donald Trump, "benefiting from his `America First' foreign 
policy at the expense of traditional US allies" have received "the cold shoulder" from the Biden 
Administration. According to the Post, the shift in how the US views its relationships with these 
leaders is "part of a strategy in keeping with Biden's promise...that he would not coddle 
dictators or mistreat US allies." The Post reports that the group of leaders the Biden 
Administration has "snubbed" include the leaders of Brazil, Egypt, Hungary, Israel, the 
Philippines, Poland, and Saudi Arabia. 
Austin Makes Case For "Integrated Deterrence." 
The Washington Post (5/5, 10.52M) runs an essay adapted from an April 30 speech by Defense 
Secretary Austin in which he argues that "advances in technology mean important changes in 
the work we do to keep the United States secure not just through air, land and sea but also 
space and cyberspace. ... What we need is the right mix of technology, operational concepts 
and capabilities - all woven together in a networked way that is so credible, flexible and 
formidable that it will give any adversary pause." Austin makes the case for "integrated 
deterrence," which he says means "using some of our current capabilities differently. It means 
developing new operational concepts for things we already have. And it means investing in 
quantum computing and artificial intelligence, which will help us make decisions with more 
speed and rigor."
