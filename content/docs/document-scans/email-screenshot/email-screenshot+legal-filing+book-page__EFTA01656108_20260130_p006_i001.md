COUNTERINTELLIGENCE 
Lawmakers Are Concerned About Background Checks of Trump's Cabinet Picks as Red Flags Surface 
The Associated Press (11/20, Tucker, Miller, Jalonick) reported that lawmakers are concerned that President-elect 
Donald Trump's transition team has not signed the necessary agreements with the White House or Justice 
Department to allow the FBI to conduct background checks on his Cabinet picks, potentially bypassing a critical 
part of the confirmation process. According to the article, this could result in the Senate voting on nominees 
without the usual rigorous FBI vetting meant to uncover personal problems or red flags, raising security concerns—
particularly because some nominees, such as former Rep. Matt Gaetz and Pete Hegseth, have faced serious 
allegations in the past; Gaetz was investigated by the Justice Department for alleged involvement with underage 
girls (a probe that ended without charges) and faced a House Ethics inquiry, while Hegseth was accused of sexual 
assault in 2017 but was not charged after a police investigation. The article noted that Democrats have introduced 
legislation to codify the FBI's role in the background check process for political appointees, emphasizing the 
importance of thorough vetting to address potential security liabilities and that some lawmakers, including Senator 
Susan Collins, have expressed concerns about proceeding without comprehensive FBI background 
checks. Bloomberg (11/20, Dennis, Tarabay, et al.) also reported on the story.

by the People's Republic of China (PRC) on U.S. telecommunications companies. According to the article, PRC-
affiliated actors compromised networks at multiple telecom providers to steal customer call records, intercept 
private communications of individuals involved in government or political activities, and obtain information related 
to ongoing U.S. government legal cases. The article noted that experts emphasize the seriousness of these 
espionage activities, with cybersecurity advisor Morgan Wright underscoring the urgent need to address the threat 
from China and warning that ignoring it could be perilous. 
Continued Reporting: Allegations of China Harassment Surface in Texas 
KIAH (CW-39) (11/20, Estrada) reported that the Chinese government is facing allegations of cyberstalking, physical 
intimidation, and harassment against Chinese citizens, naturalized U.S. citizens, and families of dissidents in Texas 
who have spoken out against the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). According to the article, FBI Houston posted 
claims on social media raising concerns about potential overreach by the People's Republic of China (PRC) beyond 
its borders, accusing the PRC of targeting individuals who criticize the CCP. The article noted that local authorities 
and federal agencies, including the FBI, are reportedly monitoring the situation to address any actions that may 
violate U.S. laws or threaten the safety of residents, highlighting ongoing tensions between the U.S. and PRC over
