The AP (8/3) reports that on Monday, NIAID Director Fauci "warned against reopening schools 
in coronavirus hot spots," and "said while the nation's `default principle' should be that children 
return to school, `to say that every child has to go back to school is not really realizing the fact 
that we have such a diversity of viral activity.' Fauci "said there may be some areas where the 
level of virus is so high that it would not be prudent to bring children back to school." 
Fauci said on KDFW-TVVi Dallas (8/3, 95K), "What we need to do is to be careful, 
cautious, depending upon what the level of infection is in your community. I think the default 
position is that we should try as best as possible to get the schools open because we know that 
it has deleterious effects on the children when you don't have them in school and the secondary 
downstream unintended ripple effects on families. But having said that, there is a big however 
there: however, primary among everything, is the safety and the health and welfare of the 
children as well as of the teachers." Fauci was also interviewed on KTLA-TVVi Los Angeles (8/3, 
57K), KABC-TVVi Los Angeles (8/3, 51K), KSNV-TVVi Las Vegas (8/3, 10K) and WGN-TVVi
Chicago (8/3, 147K). 
NIH Director Collins said on KOCO-TVVi Oklahoma City (8/3, 36K), "I recognize, and we 
all do, that school is really important for kids, both the educational opportunities, the 
opportunities to socialize with your peers. ... At the same time, you don't want to do that in a 
fashion that is putting people at undue risk. I think the answer really has to be a local one. if 
you are in a part of the country where there is very little virus spreading, it might make sense 
to open up carefully of course, and keep a close track on what is happening. But if you are in 
the middle of a place where the virus is spreading actively, and you have all kinds of ways of 
showing that is the case, to open schools without considering the risk does not seem like a 
smart thing to do, especially when you consider with the risks are to teachers." Collins was also 
interviewed on KRIV-TVVi Houston (8/3, 829K), KSAZ-TVVi Phoenix (8/3, 50K), WFAA-TVVi
Dallas (8/3, 46K), WXIA-TVVi Atlanta (8/3, 100K), and WKRN-TVVi Nashville, TN (8/3, 24K). 
HUD Secretary Carson said on Fox News' Bill Hemmer Reports (8/3), "We have learned a 
lot about this virus, obviously. We need to use real science, not science fiction. That means 
those people who are vulnerable, who are elderly or who have comorbidities, obviously we can 
use them in a remote setting. But the vast majority of schoolteachers are young and vigorous 
people and should be able to handle this quite well. You have to realize the data shows us 
99+% of the people who die from coronavirus are those who are elderly and have 
comorbidities. So, why should we allow that to rule us when we know that it's detrimental to 
keep kids out of school? The socialization process is a very important part of education and that 
a good education is the most important tool when it comes to being a self-sufficient adult." 
Hogan Blocks Local Officials From Ordering Private Schools To Close. The 
Washington Post (8/3, Cox, 14.2M) reports that on Monday, Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) 
"curtailed the authority of local health officials to issue a blanket order to keep schools closed, 
undoing Montgomery County's decision to require all private schools to teach students online-
only as they reopen this fall." Hogan "sharply rebuked Maryland's most populous jurisdiction for 
barring in-person instruction at parochial and private schools, saying local officials overstepped 
his interest in giving leeway to local leaders." Hogan's executive order "makes clear school 
systems and private schools have sole authority to determine when and how to safely reopen; 
local health officials may shut down schools only on a case-by-case basis for health reasons." 
USA Today (8/3, Santucci, 10.31M) notes that Barron Trump's private school "is located in 
the Maryland county where nonpublic schools were mandated to remain closed to in-person 
instruction." 
Teachers In Dozens Of Districts Protest Reopening Schools. The Washington
Times (8/3, Richardson, 492K) reports that with the start of the school year "just a few weeks 
away, teachers' unions in many communities are setting up a major test for President Trump as 
he pushes for schools to reopen, holding anti-reopening rallies and warning that school districts 
that opt for in-person learning could be hit by `safety strikes.' Demand Safe Schools, "a
