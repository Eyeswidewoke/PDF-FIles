Ex-CIA Official Warns Intel Agencies Will Be Politically Active in 2024 Election 
The Epoch Times (01/04, Phillips) reported that a former CIA analyst, Dr. John Gentry, warned that the U.S. 
intelligence community, including the CIA and FBI, has become politicized and may interfere in the 2024 election. 
He cited the Hunter Biden laptop story, alleging that former intelligence officers, including ex-FBI worker Asha 
Rangappa, downplayed it to aid the Biden campaign. According to the article, Gentry highlighted how former acting 
CIA Director Michael Morell's involvement in drafting a letter about the laptop story aimed to provide talking points 
for the Biden campaign, indicating a politicized agenda within these agencies.

CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS 
The Biggest Names from Jeffrey Epstein's Unsealed Court Documents 
The Associated Press (01/04, Neumeister, Sisak) reported that a new batch of unsealed documents pertaining 
to Jeffrey Epstein's sexual abuse of teenage girls was released Thursday, adding several hundred pages to a trove of 
information detailing how the financier leveraged connections to the rich, powerful and famous to recruit his 
victims and cover up his crimes. According to the article, the documents so far were sprinkled with names of 
celebrities and politicians who socialized with Epstein or worked with him in the years before he was publicly 
accused nearly two decades ago of paying underage girls for sex. The Daily Mail (01/04, Smith) revealed that 
former FBI Director Louis Freeh was named in Epstein's list because he may have knowledge of former President 
Bill Clinton's travel. The article noted that former FBI Director Freeh served as FBI Director throughout Clinton's 
presidency from 1993-2001. The Daily Mail (01/04, Sexton) and Newsweek (01/04, Impel') reported that following 
Epstein's death, the FBI raided his Manhattan townhouse and found a cache of evidence from a safe including 
loose diamonds and large amounts of US currency. The articles noted that FBI agents did not have a valid warrant 
to remove the evidence, so instead, they photographed them. The articles highlighted that a few days later when 
they returned to obtain the evidence, it was gone. Time (01/04, Ewe, Burga) stated that Epstein was first 
investigated for sexual misconduct in 200S after a woman claimed that he had molested her teenage stepdaughter. 
The article continued that Palm Beach police eventually charged Epstein with counts of unlawful sex with a minor 
in May 2006, but then State Attorney Barry Krischer sent the case to a grand jury, which indicted him with one 
count of soliciting prostitution. The article cited that the charge was minor, leading to much criticism and causing 
the FBI to open a federal investigation against Epstein. USA Today (01/04, Bagchi, Jackson), Al Jazeera (01/04, Staff 
Writers), Financial Times (01/04, Chaffin, Miller), ABC News (01/04, Hill), Bloomberg (01/04, Benny-Morrison, 
Hurtado), the Independent (01/04, Ross, Dodds), CNN (01/04, Delouya, Winter, et. al.), The Guardian (01/04, 
Bekiempis), CNBC (01/04, Mangan), CBS News (01/04, Gibson), FOX News (01/04, Overhuitz), The Hill (01/04, 
Robertson), and the Washington Examiner (01/04, Deese) also reported the story. 
Florida Man Arrested for Threatening to Kill Bay Area Rep. Eric Swalwell 
The Associated Press (01/04, Staff Writers) reported that a Florida man is charged with threatening to kill Rep. Eric 
Swalwell (D-Calif.) and his children. According to the article, Michael Shapiro, 72, of Greenacres, Florida, was 
arrested Wednesday morning on a charge of transmitting a threatening communication. The article added 
that Shapiro also accused Rep. Swalwell of being a Chinese spy, despite multiple investigations revealing no 
evidence of such activity. The article stated that suspected spy, Christine Fang, came into contact with Rep. 
Swalwell's campaign as he was first running for Congress in 2012 and participated in fundraising for his 2014 
campaign. The Hill (01/04, Nazzaro) added that Rep. Swalwell confirmed to the FBI that he was targeted by a 
Chinese intelligence operative but stressed he immediately cooperated with law enforcement and was never 
accused of wrongdoing. The article noted that several of Rep. Swalwell's political opponents used the 
unsubstantiated rumors to attack him and later cost Rep. Swalwell his seat on the House Intelligence 
Committee. KPIX (CBS-5) (01/04, Pehling), FOX News (01/04, Elkind, Spunt), MSNBC (01/04, Lim), AXIOS (01/04, 
Falconer), the New York Post (01/04, Farberov), the Daily Mail (01/04, Laco), and ABC News (01/04, Barr).
