These agents died protecting our children. According to the author, over 100 FBI agents have given their lives in the 
line of duty. Most Americans don't know their names. They are not famous. Not one of them sought wealth or 
glory. They just did what they swore to do. To place their lives on the line each day to defend the American people 
and uphold the U.S. Constitution. They died fighting terrorism, performing dangerous undercover work, protecting 
children, rescuing hostages, engaging in gun battles with violent criminals, arresting fugitives and performing the 
perilous responsibilities assigned to them. The author added that today's FBI agents, like their fallen colleagues, live 
and work among us, mostly maintaining a low profile. They send their children to our local schools, raise their 
families in our communities, and maintain a modest and law-abiding lifestyle. They live like average Americans. Yet, 
on a daily basis, their jobs are not average. They are the ones that Americans have assigned the responsibility to 
shield us from terrorism and espionage, from predators targeting children, to ferret out public corruption, to 
protect us from fraud, from kidnappers, from violent predators. To guard our civil rights. They are located in cities 
and towns across our country and throughout the world. Their work is essential to a safe and free society. The 
author noted that regardless of one's political beliefs, it's important to not forget that just like Laura 
Schwartzenberger, Ben Grogan, Jerry Dove and Daniel Alfin, every morning the men and women of the FBI meet 
each day prepared to put their own lives in peril to keep us and our families safe. These heroes deserve to be 
treated fairly, to not have their families exposed to danger, and to know that Americans appreciate their value and 
courage.

Senate Confirms Pam Bondi as Attorney General 
The Associated Press (02/04, Richer, Groves) reported that the Senate confirmed Pam Bondi as U.S. attorney 
general Tuesday evening, putting a longtime ally of Donald Trump at the helm of a 0OJ that has already been 
rattled by the firings of career employees seen as disloyal to the Republican president. The vote fell almost entirely 
along party lines, with only Sen. John Fetterman, a Pennsylvania Democrat, joining with all Republicans to pass her 
confirmation 54-46. Bondi, a former Florida attorney general and corporate lobbyist, is expected to oversee a 
radical reshaping of the department that has been the target of Trump's ire over the criminal cases it brought 
against him. She enters with the FBI, which she will oversee, in turmoil over the scrutiny of agents involved in 
investigations related to the president, who has made clear his desire to seek revenge on his perceived 
adversaries. Republicans have praised Bondi as a highly qualified leader they contend will bring much-needed 
change to a department they believe unfairly pursued Trump through investigations resulting in two indictments.

Continued Reporting: Kash Patel Nomination Process and Commentary 
Grassley Eyes Next Week to Move FBI Director Pick 
Politico (02/04, Fuchs) reported that Senate Judiciary Chair Chuck Grassley said in a statement Tuesday his 
committee plans to take a final vote on FBI director nominee Kash Patel as early as next week. The article noted 
that the committee has a business meeting scheduled for Thursday to consider Patel's nomination. Under 
committee rules, Democrats can delay the full committee vote for one more week, at which point senators are 
expected to advance the nominee along party lines to the full Senate for confirmation. Senate Judiciary Democrats 
on Tuesday asked Grassley for another hearing to question Patel on several matters, including the recent personnel 
shakeup at the FBI. Grassley denied their request. "No one was convinced by the Minority's baseless efforts to 
mischaracterize and malign Kash Patel. It's additionally outrageous to assert that a nominee should come before 
the Senate to answer for government actions that occurred prior to their time at an agency," he said in a 
statement. "The Senate Judiciary Committee will not fall for Democrats' delay tactics." Politico (02/04, Fuchs), the 
Hill (02/04, Fortinsky), the Hill (02/04, Beitsch), and Law 360 (02/04, Buble) also reported on the story.
