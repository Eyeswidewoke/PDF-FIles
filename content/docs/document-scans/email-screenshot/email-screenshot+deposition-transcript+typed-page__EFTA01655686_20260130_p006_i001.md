for relatives. In the past, law enforcement officials would need to find a direct match between DNA at the crime 
scene and that of a specific suspect. Now, investigators can use consumer DNA data to build family trees that can 
zero in on a person of interest — within certain policy limits. NBC News (02/25, Ortiz) reported that Idaho 
prosecutors want to present an FBI-constructed 3D model of the home where four college students were found 
brutally stabbed to death in 2022 at the suspect's trial this summer. The request was part of a series of filings made 
public Tuesday, and comes after the three-story King Road house in Moscow, located on the edge of the University 
of Idaho campus, was demolished a year after the quadruple killings. According to the article, the FBI's 
reconstruction is "based on depictions, documentation, and measurements taken at the scene prior to demolition," 
and would "aid witnesses in their testimony," prosecutors said. The Associated Press (02/25, Boone), CNN (02/25, 
Yan, Casarez), Fox News (02/25, Ruiz), and USA TODAY (02/25, Santucci) also reported on the story. 
Attorneys for Buccaneers' Rachaad White Say FBI Is Investigating an Extortion Attempt Against Him 
The Associated Press (02/25, Staff Writer) reported that the FBI is investigating an extortion attempt against 
Rachaad White, lawyers for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers running back said Tuesday. "The FBI and other appropriate 
authorities are currently looking into an extortion attempt against Rachaad White," attorneys Michelle Gervais and 
TJ Grimaldi said in a statement. "Illegal and defamatory threats and demands against Rachaad and his family will be 
met with zero tolerance. We will continue to exercise all legal avenues to protect Rachaad's rights as a victim of 
extortion." The New York Post (02/25, Arnold), Fox News (02/25, Morik), KMBC (ABC-9) (02/25, Sloan), Sports 
Illustrated (02/25, McKeone), Daily Mail (02/25, Nisse), WFLA (NBC-8) (02/25, Wells), WANE (CBS-15) (02/25, 
McKeone), and CBS Sports (02/25, Dubin) also reported on the story. 
Man Who Was Mad About Chinese Spy Balloon Faces Sentencing for Threatening Ex-Speaker McCarthy 
The Associated Press (02/26, Brown) reported that a Montana man faces years in prison at his Wednesday 
sentencing for threatening to assault former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy after becoming upset with the 
government for not shooting down a Chinese spy balloon that floated over the defendant's home city. Richard 
Rogers, 45, of Billings, will appear before U.S. District Judge Susan Waiters after a jury convicted him last year for 
threatening a member of Congress and making harassing phone calls to the FBI and congressional staff in which he 
routinely made vulgar and obscene comments. According to the article, Rogers, a former phone customer service 
representative, delivered the threat to a McCarthy staffer during a series of more than 100 calls to the Republican 
speaker's office in just 75 minutes on Feb. 3, 2023, prosecutors said. That was one day after the Pentagon 
acknowledged it was tracking the spy balloon, which was later shot down off the Atlantic Coast. Rogers testified at 
trial that his outraged calls to the FBI and McCarthy's office were a form of civil disobedience. One of his lawyers 
said during the trial that Rogers "just wanted to be heard." 
Woman Will Plead Guilty in Scheme to Defraud Presleys and Sell Graceland 
The New York Times (02/25, Stevens) reported that a Missouri woman agreed to plead guilty to mail fraud on 
Tuesday for her role in orchestrating what the authorities described as a scheme to defraud Elvis Presley's heirs by 
claiming ownership of Graceland, his Memphis home, and threatening to sell it in a foreclosure auction. The 
woman, Lisa Jeanine Findley, of Kimberling City, Mo., will have a count of aggravated identity theft dismissed as 
part of the plea agreement, which was filed in United States District Court for the Western District of Tennessee. 
According to the article, the case involving Findley burst into the public eye in May, when lawyers for the actress 
Riley Keough, the granddaughter of Presley, went to court to stop what they said was a monthslong, fraudulent 
scheme to sell Graceland, which is now a lucrative tourist attraction that draws 600,000 visitors a year. The article 
mentioned that court papers revealed that the attempt had been made by a company known as Naussany 
Investments & Private Lending LLC, but exactly who was behind that company remained a mystery for many 
months. Naussany Investments had claimed in court papers that Presley's daughter, Lisa Marie Presley, who died in 
2023, had borrowed $3.8 million from the company and put Graceland up as collateral. The company subsequently 
scheduled a sale of Graceland. But a Tennessee judge blocked the sale and the state's attorney general said his 
office would look into the situation after no one showed up in court to represent the company. Eventually, federal 
officials came forward and claimed that the whole situation had been part of an elaborate fraud. The article added 
that in an affidavit filed in August in support of an arrest warrant, an FBI agent, wrote that Findley used "a series of 
aliases, email addresses and fake documents" to engage "in a scheme to defraud Elvis Presley's family for millions 
of dollars by threatening to foreclose on the 'Graceland' estate." The agent said in the 30-page affidavit that Findley 
had created fraudulent loan documents and unlawfully used Presley's name and signature as part of her scheme.
