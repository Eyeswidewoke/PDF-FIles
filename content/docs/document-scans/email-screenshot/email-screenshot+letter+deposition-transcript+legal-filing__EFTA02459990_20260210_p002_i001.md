Services. None of their clients have been audited, but, again, Chri=tie's has only been doing these appraisals for about a 
year. 
Sales Tax 
When I asked if Christie's was taking sales tax into account or how clients=were dealing with sales tax, he was 
completely perplexed. He said that he =ad spoken with "all" of the top NY Trusts & Estates lawyers when Christie'= was 
setting up their program and no one had ever mentioned sales tax to h=m. In addition, none of the clients or lawyers to 
whom Christie's has pro=ided rental value appraisals has raised sales tax as an issue. 
Insurance 
Paul said that clients have asked Christie's about insurance, specifically =hether the rental rate should be adjusted 
depending on which party is payi=g for insurance. Paul said that Christie's doesn't take insurance into acc=unt, and that 
he tells clients that if an entity which owns the art doesn'= have possession of it, you probably want a strong paper trail 
showing tha= the entity is acting the same way any other owner of art would act, i.e.,=the entity pays for insurance, 
shipping, storage, restoration, legal fees,=art advisory fees, etc. 
Rates 
Paul gave me the following general ranges for rents: 
Work of art valued in the range of $500,000 - rental value per annum in the=range of 2.5-3.5% of the value of the work 
Work valued around $2 million -=rental value per annum 1.8-2.2% Work valued in the range of $5 million - r=ntal value 
per annum 1-1.5% Work valued in the range of $12-15 million - r=ntal value per annum .80-.90% Work valued in the 
range of $25 million - re=tal value per annum .70-.75% 
Methodology 
To determine rental rates, Christie's researched all of the commercial enti=ies that rent art (corporate art rentals, real 
estate staging companies, p=op rental companies) and analyzed the rental rates they charged, which wer= always a 
percentage of the value of the art being rented. The higher the =alue of art, the lower the rental rate. The potential 
problem with Christi.'s data is that the most valuable art they found that was being rented was=around $30,000. 
Christie's does a quantitative analysis based on their market research desc=ibed above, and then they also do a 
qualitative analysis based on the work=itself. So they determine the fair market value for the work, then the fai= rental 
value based on market data, then they have their art specialists I=ok at the work and decide if the rental rate should be 
adjusted. Paul gave=this example: Lessor/owner rents a 1930s Picasso to lessee for a 3 year re=tal term. Because the 
market for 1930s Picassos is so hot right now, Chris=ie's specialists might adjust the rental rate up a little because of the 
o=portunity cost to lessor of the 3 year term. 
Ultimately, Christie's gives its clients a fair market value appraisal and = letter in which Christie's "recommends" an 
appropriate rental rate. 
Please let me know if you have any questions or if ou would like to discus=. I'm out of the office this afternoon and 
Monday morning, but reachable o= my mobile at 
except for 3:30-6:30 pm today and 8-11 am Monda= 
when I'm on planes. 
Best, 
Heather
