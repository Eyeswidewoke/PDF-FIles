CBS News (06/03, Delzer) reported that a growing Russian disinformation network is targeting European Union 
countries ahead of the EU Parliament elections scheduled for June, researchers say, largely focused on spreading 
false claims about the war in Ukraine and political leaders who are critical of Russia. According to the article, 
the disinformation network, which operates under the "Pravda" name and masquerades as news websites, is now 
targeting all 27 EU countries with its content. Researchers from the European Digital Media Observatory say the 
network's use of artificial intelligence to produce high volumes of content provides an insight into Russia's 
disinformation tactics ahead of the U.S. presidential election. The article added that Darren Linvill, a professor at 
Clemson University in South Carolina who specializes in social media disinformation research, told CBS News 
that Russian disinformation tactics have evolved. "Russians are masters at narrative laundering, the process of 
placing a false or misleading story and then weaving it into online conversations in such a way that the original 
source is obscured," he said. "They will discredit institutions, undermine the legitimacy of the democratic process, 
and attack moderate political candidates, both Democrat and Republican, in an attempt to drive further 
extremism," he said. The article noted that U.S. agencies have increasingly warned of the usage of generative Al by 
foreign actors to attempt to influence the 2024 election. Advances in generative Al are lowering the barrier to entry 
for U.S. adversaries including Russia to spread disinformation, Director Wray said in February, while also making 
their tactics "more realistic and difficult to detect." 
China Accuses U.K. of Recruiting Couple as Spies 
The Wall Street Journal (06/03, Wong) reported that China's Ministry of State Security (MSS) has accused British 
intelligence, MI6, of recruiting a Chinese couple as spies, claiming the couple gathered sensitive information from 
key state agencies. The couple, identified only by their surnames Wang and Zhou, allegedly began spying for the 
U.K. after Wang was targeted by MI6 during his application to study in the U.K. in 2015. According to the article, 
this case is part of a broader public campaign by China to highlight espionage activities, using social media to 
expose alleged Western spying efforts. The MSS described the recruitment of the couple as "uprooting a major 
'nail' that the British had implanted within" the Chinese government but did not disclose further details about their 
identities or the specific agencies involved. The U.K. has not commented on these allegations, which come amid 
heightened tensions and mutual accusations of spying between China and Western countries. The article added 
that Washington has also stepped up warnings against Chinese espionage, describing Beijing as a major source of 
spying and cyber threats against the U.S. In February, Director Wray said Beijing's efforts to covertly plant offensive 
malware inside critical infrastructure networks are at "a scale greater than we'd seen before." 
House Committee Seeks Biden Admin Briefing on Biotech Firm GenScript Amid Concerns Over CCP Ties 
Axios (06/03, Sullivan, Snyder) reported that the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) 
has requested a briefing from the Biden administration concerning GenScript, a biotech company, to evaluate its 
connections with the CCP and potential risks to the U.S. According to the article, the committee's request to 
Director Wray and Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines indicates possible expansions to the Biosecure Act, 
which aims to restrict U.S. government funding to companies with CCP ties. The Committee, led by Chair John 
Moolenaar and Democrat Raja Krishnamoorthi, expressed concerns over GenScript's potential role in creating 
strategic vulnerabilities in critical biotech sectors where the U.S. is a leader. The article noted that despite 
allegations of close ties with the CCP, GenScript insists on its independence and readiness to clarify its operations 
to the committee. The Biosecure Act, part of which targets GenScript, is set to be considered in the upcoming 
House vote on the defense authorization bill. 
Lawmakers Seek Status of Report From Biden Administration on Chinese Crane Threats at U.S. Ports 
The Epoch Times (06/03, Pan) reported that U.S. lawmakers, specifically Sen. Rick Scott and Rep. Carlos Gimenez, 
are pressing the Biden administration for updates on a report concerning the national security risks posed by 
China-manufactured cranes at U.S. ports. According to the article, these cranes, made by Shanghai Zhenhua Heavy 
Industries Co. Ltd. (ZPMC), are alleged to contain hidden communication equipment, posing espionage risks. This 
concern was heightened by the discovery of intelligence-gathering equipment on a cargo ship delivering ZPMC 
cranes to Baltimore port, identified by the FBI in 2021. The article noted that the report in question, required by 
the Fiscal Year 2023 National Defense Authorization Act, was overdue as of the end of May 2023.
