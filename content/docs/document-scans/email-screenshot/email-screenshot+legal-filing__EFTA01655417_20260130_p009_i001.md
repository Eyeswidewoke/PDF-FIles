ABA Foundation and FBI Release New Infographic to Help Americans Spot and Avoid Deepfake Scams 
American Bankers Association (09/03, Staff Writer) reported that the American Bankers Association Foundation 
and the FBI have released a new infographic to educate the public about deepfake scams. The article noted 
that according to the FBI, over 4.2 million fraud reports have been filed since 2020, resulting in over $50.5 billion in 
losses, with a growing portion stemming from deepfake scams. According to the article, the infographic provides 
tips to help consumers recognize and avoid deepfake scams, including verifying identities, stopping and thinking 
before responding to urgent requests, and reporting scams to the FBI. Quoted in the article, FBI Criminal 
Investigative Division Assistant Director Jose A. Perez stated, "The FBI continues to see a troubling rise in fraud 
reports involving deepfake media. Educating the public about this emerging threat is key to preventing these scams 
and minimizing their impact. We encourage consumers to stay informed and share what they learn with friends 
and family so they can spot deepfakes before they do any harm. Our partnership with the ABA Foundation reflects 
a shared commitment to protecting consumers and advancing this important public awareness effort." 
CCP-Backed Hacking Operations Breach Hundreds of U.S. Groups 
The Epoch Times (09/03, Thornebrooke) reported that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has been backing 
hacking operations against the U.S. and other nations since at least 2019, with the group known as Salt Typhoon 
breaching hundreds of organizations. According to the article, the hacking attempts have targeted various sectors, 
including telecommunications, government, transportation, and military infrastructure networks, with over 200 
U.S.-based organizations and foreign organizations in 80 nations affected. The article noted that the breached data 
has likely enabled the CCP to track the movements and communications of its targets in real time, with three 
China-based companies providing cyber-related products and services to China's intelligence services. "Active since 
at least 2019, these actors conducted a significant cyber-espionage campaign, breaching global 
telecommunications privacy and security norms," Brett Leatherman, head of the FBI's Cyber Division, said in a pre-
recorded statement. "Beijing's indiscriminate targeting of private communications demands our stronger 
collaboration with partners to identify and counter this activity at the earliest stages." The American Hospital 
Association (09/03, Staff Writer) also reported on the story. 
FBI Warns Seniors Are Being Targeted in Three-Phase Phantom Hacker Scams 
FORTRA (09/03, Cluley) reported that the FBI warned that seniors are being targeted in a three-phase "Phantom 
Hacker" scam, which combines social engineering and technology to steal funds. According to the article, the scam 
involves three phases: a tech support imposter, a financial institution imposter, and a U.S. government imposter, 
aiming to gain the victim's trust and access to their funds. The FBI advised seniors to be cautious and never click on 
unsolicited links, download software from unknown parties, or allow remote access to their devices, and to report 
any incidents to their local FBI field office and the IC3. 
Opinion: Cutting Cyber Intelligence Undermines National Security 
An opinion piece published by The Cipher Brief (09/03, McDowall, Montgomery) reported that the U.S. is 
undermining its national security by cutting its cyber intelligence capabilities, despite increasing threats from 
Russia, China, and Iran. According to the article, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) is 
planning to slash its intelligence processing and information sharing services, including the termination of the 
Cyber Threat Intelligence Integration Center (CTIIC) and the Foreign Malign Influence Center (FMIC). The cuts, part 
of the "ODNI 2.0" plan announced by Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, will reduce the U.S.'s ability to 
protect itself against cyber threats and foreign influence operations, and may send the nation back to pre-9/11 
dysfunction. The article explained that FMIC played a critical role in uncovering online influence operations against 
the United States from Iranian, Russian, and Chinese threats throughout the 2024 election cycle. It worked with the 
FBI and the CISA to release regular public updates debunking malign content circulated by adversaries. The author 
assessed that Gabbard falsely equates FMIC's work with the censorship of American citizens. Instead, cuts to the 
center will reduce Washington's ability to protect American citizens from the state-sponsored influence operations 
running rampant on the internet.
