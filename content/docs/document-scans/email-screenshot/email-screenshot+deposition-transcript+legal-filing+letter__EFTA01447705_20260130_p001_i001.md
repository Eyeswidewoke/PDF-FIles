we or our affiliates may make a market in, trade instruments economically related to, or have an 
investment banking or other relationship with the issuer of a security underlying an OTC derivative you 
enter into. These instruments are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or any 
other u.S. Interest rate swaps expose investors to interest rate, credit, counterparty default, and 
liquidity risks. In certain transactions, you can lose your entire investment or incur an unlimited loss. 
Any decision to enter into a swap, should only be made after reviewing the final swap confirmation and 
conducting an investigation in order to independently determine the suitability and consequence of 
participating in the swap. Any offering will be made only by means of offering documentation, including a 
long-form confirmation, if applicable. 
Transactions in options carry a high degree of risk, and selling (or "writing") uncovered options may 
entail considerably greater risk. options are not suitable for all investors. Before engaging in options 
trading, it is very important that you read the "characteristics and Risks of standardized Options" (the 
option Disclosure Document). This option Disclosure Document may be obtained directly from the option 
clearing corporation's website at www.optionsclearing.com in the "Publications" section, or you may 
request a copy from your Client Advisor. 
Before trading in a margin account, investors should be aware of the attendant risks which include, but 
are not limited to the fact that margin trading increases your level of market risk; loss is not limited 
to the collateral value in your margin account; and a purchase and/or sale of any securities in your 
account may be initiated without contacting you, to meet a margin call. Past Performance is not 
indicative of future results. 
Foreign exchange transactions involve multiple risks, including currency risks and settlement risk. 
Economic or financial instability, lack of timely or reliable financial information or unfavorable 
political or legal developments may substantially and permanently alter the conditions, terms, 
marketability, or price of a foreign currency. Profits and losses in transactions in FX will also be 
affected by fluctuations in currency where there is a need to convert the product's denominations to 
another currency. Time zone differences may cause several hours to elapse between a payment being made in 
one currency and an offsetting payment in another currency. Relevant movements in currencies during the 
settlement period may seriously erode potential profits or significantly increase any losses. Investors 
in foreign currency options should refer to the section entitled "Special Risks of Foreign Currency 
Options" in the "Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options" disclosure 
document.
