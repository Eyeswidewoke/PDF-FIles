Cybersecurity Experts Concerned Over Threat Of Disinformation From Within US. 
The New York Times (10/25, Niu, Bracken, Eaton, 18.61M) reports that experts "are more 
concerned with disinformation coming from our very own backyard" than that coming from 
Russia or other foreign countries. For instance, one man, "with a single tweet, disrupted a 
governor's race in Kentucky" in 2019. The incident "became one of the most viral pieces of 
disinformation in an already close election and cast doubt on the results." The Times says the 
"same pattern is already playing out this year, with the added layer of uncertainty caused by 
the coronavirus pandemic." Currently, "there is no unified policy from the major tech companies 
when it comes to combating election misinformation." 
Continuing Coverage: DOD, ODNI Release Intel Budget Requests For FY21. 
Bloomberg Government (10/23) reported that DOD and ODNI "released their intelligence 
budget requests for fiscal 2021 totaling $85 billion earlier this year." The agencies "released 
enacted 2020 figures Oct. 21, allowing for comparisons and revealing a slight decrease from 
$85.8 billion total in the fiscal 2021 request." The intelligence budget is "comprised of two 
primary categories, the Military Intelligence Program (MIP) and the National Intelligence 
Program (NIP)." MIP includes "spending for the intelligence components of the military services 
as well as some of the funding for intelligence agencies that fall under DOD" such as DIA and 
NGA. NIP includes funding for agencies such as CIA, "portions of the FBI," INR, "as well as 
some portion of the DOD-controlled agencies." 
Kremlin Laments US Election Campaigns' Focus On Dislike For Russia. 
Reuters (10/23, Antonov) reports, "The Kremlin said on Friday it regretted that US election 
campaigns seem like competitions for candidates to show how much they dislike Russia, but 
that it was only up to American voters to pick a new president on Nov. 3." 
US Imposes Sanctions On Russian Government Research Center Involved In 2017 
Cyberattack. 
The New York Times (10/23, Perlroth, 18.61M) reports that the US on Friday "imposed 
economic sanctions against a Russian government research organization that was responsible 
for a potentially deadly cyberattack on a Saudi petrochemical facility in 2017." Though the 
target was not named, "description of the attack matched with a hacking that year of Petro 
Rabigh, the Saudi oil giant, that shut off the safety systems that are used to prevent an 
explosion." The State Research Center of the Russian Institute of Chemistry and Mechanics 
"built the custom tools used in a spate of 2017 attacks on oil facilities in the Middle East as well 
as attempted hackings of at least 20 electric facilities in the United States." Officials said the 
tools had the "capability to cause significant physical damage and loss of life." The 2017 
episode "prompted an investigation" by the NSA, FBI, DHS, and "the Pentagon's Defense 
Advanced Research Projects Agency, as well as investigators at Schneider, the security firm 
FireEye's Mandiant security team and Dragos, a security firm that specializes in industrial 
control security." 
The Washington Post (10/23, Nakashima, 14.2M) reports, "The Treasury Department's 
designation of an institute of the State Research Center of the Russian Federation marks the 
first time the United States has sanctioned hackers for targeting industrial control systems, 
analysts said." Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said, "The Russian Government continues to 
engage in dangerous cyber activities aimed at the United States and our allies. ... This 
Administration will continue to aggressively defend the critical infrastructure of the United 
States from anyone attempting to disrupt it." Assets held by the institute in the US are frozen, 
"and Americans are barred from engaging in transactions with the lab." Treasury "said in a news 
release that the use of the Triton malware 'against our partners is particularly troubling given 
the Russian government's involvement in malicious and dangerous cyber-enabled activities."
