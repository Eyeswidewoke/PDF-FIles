Israeli pullout from parts of the West B=nk, coupled with a mutual cease-fire but without any interaction with or 
r=cognition of the Jewish state, is something Hamas would welcome as a victo=y without endorsing as a deal. 
Such an outcome wou=d promote the protagonists' short-term interests. Israel would mollify W=stern critics and 
neutralize the Palestinian demographic threat; Fatah cou=d continue building institutions of a future state; Hamas again 
may claim credit for pushing Israel back without=compromising on core principles. But the conflict would endure. Israel 
wou=d not achieve Arab recognition or an end to Palestinian claims; Fatah woul= not have produced a sovereign, 
independent state or resolved the refugee issue; and Hamas would have to a=quiesce in the continued presence of a 
Jewish state on what it considers P=lestinian land. The ultimate reckoning would still loom, arguably under co=ditions 
more inimical to the comprehensive resolution all claim to seek. 
Since the inception=of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the status of the land between the Jo=dan River and 
Mediterranean Sea has been determined almost invariably by a=ts of war or unilateral decisions. Even the Oslo Accords 
altered the status of Palestinian territory little o= the ground. Someday this may change. For now, events outside the 
negotiat=ng room again deserve far more consideration than what's happening insid= — and could shape Israeli-
Palestinian relations for some time to come.

Shimon Peres=92s Influence Wanes as Israel Grows More Bellicose Toward Iran 
Dan Ephron</=> 
March 2, 2012 -- The oddest odd couple in Israeli politics might just be Prime Minist=r Benjamin Netanyahu and 
President Shimon Peres, both of whom are in Washi=gton this week for meetings with President Obama 
<http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/02/26/obama-won-t-bac=-an-israeli-strike-on-iran.html> . Netanyahu is 
an unwavering skeptic with a deep devotio= to Greater Israel, Peres a relentlessly optimistic peacenik. Yet for much=of 
the past three years, Netanyahu had no bigger booster than Peres, who r=peatedly vouched for him with foreign leaders 
and assured people he genuinely wants peace. Netanyahu, in return,=allowed Peres a brief role in contacts with the 
Palestinians, though as pr=sident, his job description restricts him mostly to pomp and circumstance.=nbsp; Now the 
honeymoon =ight be ending. People familiar with the relationship say tensions have bu=bled to the surface in recent 
months over how to cope with Iran's nuclear ambitions <http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/02/07/u-s-jews-
should=heed-top-israeli-soldiers-who-oppose-bombing-iran.html> and what to offer the Pales=inians. So much so that 
while Netanyahu is expected to tell Obama that Isr=el will take action on its own 
<http://www.thedailybeast.com/cheats/2012/02/27/israel-won-t-warn=u-s-on-iran-strike.html> if sanctions against 
Iran don't produce quick results—ra=sing the specter of a regional war—Peres has different ideas. "When yo= see that 
the United States and Europe are taking steps Ito prevent Iran f=om getting nuclear weapons] ... that's the way right 
now," he told Newsweek in a recent interview in Jerusalem. "=e don't have to monopolize it."
