noted that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has filed a parallel civil action accusing Adani and two co-
defendants of violating antifraud provisions of U.S. securities laws and that shares in the Adani corporate empire 
plunged in India following the indictment. "Gautam S. Adani and seven other business executives allegedly bribed 
the Indian government to finance lucrative contracts designed to benefit their businesses. Adani and other 
defendants also defrauded investors by raising capital on the basis of false statements about bribery and 
corruption, while still other defendants allegedly attempted to conceal the bribery conspiracy by obstructing the 
government's investigation," stated FBI Assistant Director in Charge Dennehy in the press release. "The FBI 
maintains its steadfast mission to expose all corrupt agreements, especially with international governments, and 
protect investors from related harm." Additional reporting on the story was provided by the Associated Press

COUNTERTERRORISM 
Former Georgia Poll Worker Indicted for Mailing Bomb Threat to Polling Place 
Fox News (11/20, Hagstrom) reported that a Georgia poll worker named Nicholas Wimbish, 25, was arrested and 
charged by the FBI for allegedly mailing a bomb threat to a polling place ahead of Election Day. According to the 
article, the FBI alleges that on October 17, Wimbish mailed a threatening letter to the Jones County Elections 
superintendent, impersonating a voter and claiming that Wimbish had caused disruptions; the letter included 
threats such as "rage rape" against "the ladies" and warned officials to "look over their shoulder," concluding with a 
handwritten note stating, "PS boom toy in early vote place, cigar burning, be safe." The article noted that Wimbish 
was charged with multiple federal offenses—including mailing a bomb threat, conveying false information about a 
bomb threat, mailing a threatening letter, and making false statements to the FBI, who discovered a copy of the 
letter on his computer—and that if convicted, he faces up to 10 years in prison for the bomb threat charge and 
additional time for the other counts. The Hill (11/20, Suter) and the Atlanta Journal-Constitution (11/20, Stevens) 
also reported on the story. 
Man Who Bought a Gun to 'Shoot Up a Synagogue' is Sentenced to 10 Years 
The New York Times (11/20, Moynihan) reported that Christopher Brown, a 21-year-old man, was sentenced to 10 
years in prison after pleading guilty to possessing a weapon as a crime of terrorism, following his plan to "shoot up 
a synagogue." According to the article, Brown had posted threatening messages on social media expressing his 
intent to target a synagogue; he was arrested at Pennsylvania Station by the NYPD after members of a Jewish 
organization that monitors online threats alerted the authorities, and he was found carrying weapons and a 
swastika arm patch. The article noted that Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg stated that evidence indicated 
Brown had an interest in "accelerationism"—aiming to incite a race war—and that authorities had "averted a 
serious risk of terrorism". The article also noted that the FBI was involved in the investigation through the Joint 
Terrorism Task Force alongside the NYPD. WABC (ABC-7) (11/20, Katersky) and Hoodline (11/20, Langston) also 
reported on the story. 
Venezuelan Migrant Gang Tren de Aragua Now Operating in 16 States 
Fox News (11/20, Dorgan) reported that the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua (TdA) is now operating in 16 U.S. 
states, engaging in violent crimes such as murders, assaults, robberies, shootings of police officers, and gun 
smuggling, according to a Homeland Security memo cited by the New York Post. According to the article, Homeland 
Security recommended last month that more than 100 migrants identified as having possible ties to the gang be 
placed on an FBI watch list, after flagging over 600 individuals with possible connections. The article assessed that 
the gang's expansion has been facilitated by a lax southern border under the Biden-Harris administration. The 
article noted that TdA is involved in drug dealing and sex trafficking of migrant women, with Tennessee Bureau of 
Investigation Director David Rausch warning about the surge of human trafficking and describing law enforcement 
efforts as a dangerous "cat and mouse" game. Former Customs and Border Protection acting Commissioner Mark 
Morgan stated that TdA is "expanding its criminal operations like a slow-growing cancer across our nation and 
unleashing a preventable wave of crime that will be with us for decades."
