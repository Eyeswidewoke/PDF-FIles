This extract from a speach by Shaikh Mohammed this morning at a finacial forum 
The global financial crisis has not hamperedDubai's ambitions, its ruler said on Monday, adding that 
talk of tension between Dubaiand its bigger and richer neighbour, Abu Dhabi, was unfounded. 
Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, who is also prime minister of the United Arab Emirates, 
said Dubai had passed the worst of the economic downturn and that he had full confidence in its 
ability to act in the global market. "The worst is over and Dubaiis now well-placed," he said at an 
investment meeting. "The global economic crisis, despite its impact, will not deter Dubai's ambitions." 
Dubai's economy has been hit hard as the global credit crunch and a steep decline in crude prices 
ended a six-year boom in the region and sent the emirate's once-flourishing property sector into 
decline. 
On Monday, Sheikh Mohammed said real estate was not the only driver of Dubai's economy. 
Dubai's ruler said ties between Abu Dhabi -- the main contributor to the federal budget —
and Dubai should not be questioned. 
Widespread speculation that Abu Dhabiwould be obliged to support Dubai through the global crisis — 
either through the federal stimulus programmes or secret, bilateral deals -- led to talk of increasingly 
strained relations between the two. 
"There is no Dubai and Abu Dhabi, we are one," Sheikh Mohammed said. "Who doesn't understand 
this should do their homework before they start talking ... We will be there for each other when we 
need it. 
"And I want to tell those people who nag about Dubai and Abu Dhabi to shut up." 
Earlier this year, Dubai raised $10 billion in emergency cash from the UAE's central bank through a 
bond issue as part of a plan to raise a total of $20 billion, setting up a support fund to manage the 
proceeds. 
Sheikh Mohammed said the second tranche "will receive subscribers", suggesting it would not be 
purchased entirely by the UAE central bank, as the first had been. 
The Gulf emirate's ruler added the proceeds would be used to settle Dubai's future obligations. 
The emirate has about $4 billion worth of debt to restructure over the next two months, including the 
world's largest Islamic bond to date, a $3..5 billion issue, from developer Nakheel. Dubai, which 
jumped into the global spotlight with vast infrastructure projects such as man-made islands shaped 
like palms and the world's tallest building, successfully tapped global debt markets last month, in its 
first fixed income foray in more than a year.
