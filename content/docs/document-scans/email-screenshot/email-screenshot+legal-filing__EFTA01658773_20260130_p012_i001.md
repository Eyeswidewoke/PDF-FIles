law enforcement officials, though they did not specify which social media platform he used. 
Among the posts was a call for people to 'hit the streets while these scumbags are celebrating 
and start blowing them away,' referring to those cheering Biden's victory, and suggestions that 
the election had been 'fraudulently stolen' from President Trump. In an earlier post, Maiorana 
hinted he would throw 'pipe bombs' and 'mobs,' a reference to protesters demonstrating against 
racial inequality." 
The Washington Post (11/11, Elfrink, 14.2M) reports, "On Tuesday, federal agents 
arrested Maiorana at his home in Staten Island on charges of making threatening interstate 
communications. Although he's a convicted sex offender and is banned from owning guns, 
federal agents say they found evidence that Maiorana had bought gun parts and a crossbow. 
Maiorana's arrest comes amid an upswing in violent rhetoric on the right as Trump contests the 
election results and makes unfounded claims of fraud. Over the weekend, a police chief in 
Arkansas resigned after social media posts in his name called for Democrats to be killed, and 
last week, Trump's former chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon was banned from Twitter for 
calling for violence against federal officials." 
Federal Prosecutors Fear Whitmer Kidnap Plotters Could Target Informants. 
The Detroit News (11/10, Snell, 825K) reports, "Federal prosecutors asked a judge Tuesday to 
prevent men accused of plotting to kidnap Gov. Gretchen Whitmer from leaking the identities of 
informants and undercover agents who infiltrated the alleged conspiracy." Federal prosecutors 
"fear the premature identification of informants and undercover agents could lead to witness 
tampering or worse. On Tuesday, they asked U.S. Magistrate Judge Sally Berens to issue a 
protective order shielding evidence from anyone outside of the defense team, court officials and 
potential witnesses. 'Such premature identification might reasonably be expected to lead to 
witness tampering, intimidation and/or retaliation,' Assistant U.S. Attorney Nils Kessler wrote in 
a court filing. 'If not by the defendants themselves, by individuals or groups sympathetic to 
their perceived aims. In addition, pretrial dissemination of unadmitted evidence could taint the 
jury pool and create challenges to the selection of an unbiased venire (jury pool)." 
White Supremacist Group Distributes Recruitment Flyers In Texas. 
The Washington Post (11/10, Villegas Vargas, 14.2M) reports that "some residents in the San 
Antonio area woke up Sunday to find a smattering of anti-Black Lives Matter and white 
supremacist messages on their doorsteps" believed "to have been distributed by members of 
14First the Foundation, a self-described 'pro white organization fighting for the white race." 
According to The Post, the group appears "to have a multi-state presence," and Hollywood Park 
police chief Shad Prichard "acknowledged the extreme nature of the messages is a reason for 
concern." Prichard said, "My opinion is that they are trying to recruit and make it a larger 
organization." 
Man Arrested For Pointing Laser At Police Helicopter. 
The Atlanta (GA) Journal-Constitution (11/10, 895K) reports a 47-year-old man was arrested 
on charges of "obstruction and laser use against an aircraft" after confessing to pointing a laser 
pointer at a police helicopter in Gwinnett, Georgia. The man told investigators he pointed the 
laser at the helicopter "for fun." His case will be "referred to the Federal Aviation Administration 
and the U.S. Attorney for possible prosecution, Gwinnett police spokesman Cpl. Collin Flynn 
said Tuesday." Flynn said, "Pointing a laser at an aircraft is extremely dangerous as it can hinder 
the pilot's ability to handle the aircraft and interfere with the equipment on board." Additional 
coverage included Raleigh (NC) News & Observer (11/12, 425K), Fox News (11/11, Hollan, 
27.59M), and WSAV-TV Savannah, GA (11/10).
