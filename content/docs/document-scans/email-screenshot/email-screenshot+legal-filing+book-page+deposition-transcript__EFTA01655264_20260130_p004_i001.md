federal government multiple times over the flag, with two lawsuits remaining pending. The article noted that it is 
not clear why Soliman was flagged on the FBI's terror watch list. DailyWire (07/09, Lindquist) also reported on the

Continued Reporting: FBI Warns of an Escalating 764 Threat Leading Young Girls to Hurt Themselves 
KOAA (NBC-5) (07/09, Cloherty) reported that the FBI is warning about an escalating online threat called "764" that 
targets young girls, manipulating them into sending explicit images and videos, and coercing them to harm 
themselves. According to the article, the group, which originated as an online nihilistic gang, uses various 
platforms, including social media, online games, and email, to contact victims as young as 10 years old. The article 
explained that the FBI encourages parents and guardians to be vigilant, set parental controls, and look for signs of 
victimization, such as withdrawal, mood changes, and self-harm, and to report concerns to the FBI hotline. 
"Unfortunately, we have cases now in every FBI field office across the country, and that's just what we know about. 
I speculate that there are many, many thousands more," said Supervisory Special Agent Ash Thorne. "So, when a 
kid tries to get out or says no, that kind of retaliation goes out to their friends, and there's a great fear, right? 
Because ultimately, these criminal actors gain status within these communities by the sheer number of victims that 
they have. Ultimately, we've seen children and at-risk individuals commit suicide out of fear," said Thorne.

terrorism and weapons at their home. The teen is currently being held without bail at the Capital District Juvenile 
Secure Detention Center in Albany, NY, and the investigation remains ongoing. The article noted that the FBI's Joint 
Terrorism Task Force assisted with the case.
