Dems"Delay Tactic' to 'Malign' Patel and Stall FBI Confirmation Dismissed as 'Baseless' by Top Senate Leader 
Fox News (02/05, Deppisch) reported that the head of the Senate Judiciary Committee criticized Democrats on the 
panel this week for their attempts to schedule a second confirmation hearing for President Donald Trump's FBI 
director nominee, Kash Patel, describing the effort Tuesday night as a "delay tactic" designed to stall Patel from 
taking the reins of the sprawling law enforcement agency. According to the article, in a statement Tuesday night, 
Grassley criticized what he described as the "baseless" attempt by Sen. Dick Durbin, (0-IL), and other Democrats on 
the panel to push for a second hearing, noting that Patel testified for more than five hours before the committee 
and disclosed to the panel "thousands of pages" of records, as well as nearly 150 pages of responses to lawmakers' 
written questions. "No one was convinced by the minority's baseless efforts to mischaracterize and malign Kash 
Patel," Grassley said. "It's additionally outrageous to assert that a nominee should come before the Senate to 
answer for government actions that occurred prior to their time at an agency." "Further hearings on his nomination 
are unnecessary," Grassley concluded. He said the committee still intends to vote on Patel's confirmation as FBI 
director as early as next week. Grassley's remarks come after Durbin, the Senate Judiciary Committee's ranking 
Democrat, urged Grassley to delay Patel's confirmation vote Tuesday, citing what he described as "apparent 
falsehoods" in Patel's testimony last week, as well as the "recent removals and reassignments of FBI career civil 
servants." The letter, signed by all 10 Democrats on the panel, urged Grassley to delay Patel's confirmation vote 
until Patel agreed to testify for a second time under oath about the recent removals and reassignments of FBI civil 
servants; and until DO1 agrees to provide the panel with volume two of former special counsel Jack Smith's final 
report that refers or pertains to Patel's testimony or actions, among other things. Spectrum News (02/05, Gannon), 
and Just the News (02/05, Severi) also reported on the story. 
Was Kash Patel Aware of FBI Firings in Advance? 
MSNBC (02/05, Rubin) reported that in the wake of FBI director nominee Kash Patel's confirmation hearing last 
week, senators of both parties posed written questions to him to further explore his past comments, particularly 
with respect to the 2020 election and Jan. 6, 2021, and, perhaps more significantly, assess his response to a slew of 
recent firings within the FBI. According to the article, MSNBC has obtained those questions — known as "questions 
for the record" or "QFRs" — and Patel's answers, which comprise 174 pages and reflect inquiries from a dozen 
members of the Senate Judiciary Committee. According to a source familiar with Patel's nomination process, his 
responses were provided to the committee on Monday. In his responses, Patel repeatedly denied any involvement 
in or direction of any of the FBI firings that have taken place since President Donald Trump's inauguration, including 
those that have occurred since Patel's Jan. 30 confirmation hearing. The article stated that when asked more 
broadly whether, for example, he discussed with anyone on the Trump transition team or in the current 
administration the demotion or removal of officials who were still with the FBI as of Trump's inauguration, Patel 
responded, "Not that I recall." Similarly, when asked whether he knew before his Jan. 30 testimony that "scores of 
senior FBI officials and rank-and-file agents assigned to the federal cases against President Trump and the Jan. 6 
defendants have been told to resign or be fired," Patel replied, "Not that I recall." Patel's responses remained the 
same — "Not that I recall" — when asked whether, at the time of his Jan. 30 testimony, he was aware of personnel 
decisions impacting specific, named individuals or "any other plans to dismiss any FBI personnel" or conduct 
evaluations or reviews of those FBI personnel who worked on Jan. 6 cases or those related to Trump. 
The Washington Times (02/OS, Wasinger), San Antonio Express-News (02/05, Spinks), Just the News (02/05, 
Whedon), and the Economic Times (02/05, Staff Writer) also reported on Kash Patel
