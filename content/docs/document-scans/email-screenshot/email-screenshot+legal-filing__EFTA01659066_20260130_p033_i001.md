Reuters (10/21, Gutierrez, Dominguez) reports, "Spain became the first Western European 
country to exceed 1 million COVID-19 infections on Wednesday, doubling its tally in just six 
weeks despite a series of increasingly stringent measures to control the second wave of the 
virus." Data from the health ministry showed the "the infection rate accelerated to frequently 
exceed 10,000 cases a day from late August, hitting a new peak of more than 16,000 last 
week," with many blaming "impatience to be rid of state-imposed restrictions meant to contain 
coronavirus contagion, or weariness with social distancing guidelines" and "deeply entrenched 
political polarization" for the increase.

depending on how much citizens were adhering to personal hygiene and social distancing

'a full lockdown' were not on the agenda," with any new restrictions having "a narrower scope' 
to "protect the economy."

demonstrate against the government's handling of a wide range of issues including the

"had largely put a halt to demonstrations this year, but organizers were hoping to renew 
momentum after the government lifted six months of strict quarantine measures aimed at 
containing the virus." Colombia "is on track to reach 1 million confirmed virus cases this week," 
and "though President Ivan Duque's approval rating has improved during the pandemic, the 
country remains divided on a host of issues."
