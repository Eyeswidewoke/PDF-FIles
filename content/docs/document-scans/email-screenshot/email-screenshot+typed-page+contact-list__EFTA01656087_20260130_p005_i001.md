Fox News (09/18, Video) provided video coverage of Director Wray's statements. 
FBI Disrupts Second Chinese Hacking Group, Director Wray Says 
Reuters (09/18, Satter) reported that U.S. law enforcement has successfully disrupted a second Chinese hacking 
group, referred to as "Flax Typhoon," which had compromised thousands of devices. Director Wray announced the 
disruption at a cybersecurity conference in Washington, explaining that Flax Typhoon was run by a Chinese 
company called the Integrity Technology Group, which posed as an IT firm but actually "collected intelligence and 
performed reconnaissance for Chinese government security agencies." According to the article, Director Wray said 
the operation against Flax Typhoon took place last week "as part of our ongoing efforts to take China's botnets 
offline." Like Volt Typhoon, he said that Flax Typhoon was targeting critical infrastructure, but also corporations, 
media organizations, universities, and government agencies. To help camouflage their operations, Flax Typhoon 
routed their malicious traffic through something called "a botnet," a network of hijacked devices that in this case 
included cameras and digital storage devices, Director Wray said. He added that when the FBI tried to take control 
of the botnet's infrastructure, the hackers responded with a cyberattack before abandoning the fight. He then 
warned that the FBI would continue to clash with China's hackers. The Associated Press (09/18, Tucker) reported 
that Director Wray said that "Flax Typhoon's actions caused real harm to its victims, who had to devote precious 
time to clean up the mess when they discovered the malware." He also explained, "This was another successful 
disruption, but make no mistake — it's just one round in a much longer fight. The Chinese government is going to 
continue to target your organizations and our critical infrastructure, either by their own hand or concealed through 
their proxies, and we'll continue to work with our partners to identify their malicious activity, disrupt their hacking 
campaigns, and bring them to light." The press release quoted FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate: "The disruption of 
this worldwide botnet is part of the FBI's commitment to using technical operations to help protect victims, expose 
publicly the scope of these criminal hacking campaigns, and to use the adversary's tools against them to remove 
malicious infrastructure from the virtual battlefield. The FBI's unique legal authorities allowed it to lead an 
international operation with partners that collectively disconnected this botnet from its China-based hackers at 
Integrity Technology Group." Additional reporting on the story was provided by the Washington Post (09/18, Menn,

FBI Says Iranian Hackers Tried but Failed to Interest Biden's Campaign in Stolen Trump Info 
The Associated Press (09/18, Klepper, Tucker) reported that Iranian hackers attempted to interest President Joe 
Biden's campaign in stolen information from Donald Trump's campaign, according to statements from the FBI and 
other federal agencies. The emails, containing excerpts of non-public Trump campaign material, were sent in an 
effort to interfere in the 2024 election. According to the article, there is no indication that anyone associated with 
Biden's campaign responded to these emails, which were perceived as phishing attempts. The FBI and other 
agencies have linked these actions to Tehran, describing the hack as part of a broader effort to undermine voters' 
trust in the election. The article noted that the FBI informed Trump aides that hacked information had been sent to 
Biden's campaign, just days before the Trump campaign publicly acknowledged the breach. Additional reporting on 
the story was provided by Reuters (09/18, Pitas, Singh), the New York Times (09/18, Thrush), the Washington Post
