and the Cape Canaveral launch pads will make Florida competitive," according to Rep. Michael 
Waltz (R-FL). 
The Colorado SpringL(CO) Gazette (11/19, Roeder, 223K) reports, "The biggest 
categories are military needs, which includes the command's proximity to space units, having a 
solid civilian space work force, and quality of life for troops" - and Colorado Springs Chamber & 
EDC defense program chief Reggie Ash "said Colorado Springs has all those boxes checked." 
The Denver Post (11/19, Tabachnik, 720K) also provides coverage about Colorado Springs' 
selection as one of the six finalists. 
The San Antonio Express-News (11/19, Christenson, Jefferson, 762K) reports, "San 
Antonio had floated several possible sites" - including "Port San Antonio, Joint Base San 
Antonio-Lackland, and the former Brooks AFB, now a commercial development" - but "the Air 
Force narrowed them down to Port San Antonio, the former Kelly AFB." 
The Huntsville (AL) Times (11/19, Roop, Gattis, 861K) reports that Huntsville's Redstone 
Arsenal "is the only site on the new list that is not an Air Force base," though local officials have 
touted how the site "handled earlier growth through Army base closing and realignment efforts 
(BRAC)." 
Canadian Border Agent Says Huawei CFO Could Have Fled Country. 
Reuters (11/19, Berman) reports that Canada Border Services Agency Superintendent Sowmith 
Katragadda "told a court on Thursday" that Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou "was a flight risk and 
had the resources to escape the country without reporting to authorities." Katragadda said 
Meng "has the resources to depart Canada and not report for an examination," adding she "is a 
senior executive for one of the biggest companies in the world. And Canada is a very big 
country with a lot of small airports." Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Thursday "said he had no 
regrets about Meng's arrest regardless of foreign policy implications, pointing to the 
`longstanding extradition treaty with our closest ally' and adding that Canada's laws can't only 
be followed 'when it's convenient or when it's easy.'" 
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS 
Men Accused In Whitmer Kidnapping Plot Allegedly Planned Executions. 
WLS-TV Chicago (11/19, 391K) reports that according to new filings, the 14 men charged in 
"the alleged militia plot against" Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) drew up a Plan B "that 
involved a takeover of the Michigan capitol building by 200 combatants who would state a 
week-long series of televised executions of public officials." The documents also show a Plan C 
that involved "burning down the state house, leaving no survivors." WLS-TV says that "in 
southern Wisconsin Wednesday afternoon the 14th man charged in the plot, Brian Higgins, was 
closer to extradition to Michigan," though "several of the defendants have had bond reductions 
and are now free." 
McClatchy (11/19, Stunson, 19K) reports, "A militia group with plans to kidnap Michigan 
Gov. Gretchen Whitmer also considered executing hostages on television before their plot was 
foiled, according to new court documents. The new information was revealed by the Michigan 
Attorney General's Office, which was arguing against a bond reduction of one of the militia men, 
Pete Musico. Fourteen men have been charged in the case, which the attorney general's office is 
prosecuting, according to the Detroit Free Press." McClatchy adds, "Some of the accused 
extremists, known as the Wolverine Watchmen, had two plans during a 2nd Amendment rally 
they attended at Michigan's Capitol building in June, documents uploaded by WWMT revealed. 
The first plan involved them recruiting 200 men and storming the Capitol building while 
Congress was in session. 'They were to take hostages, execute tyrants and have it televised,' 
court documents show. 'It would take about one week and (said) that no one is coming out 
alive.'
