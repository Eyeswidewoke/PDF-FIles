In a commentary in The Conversation (7/21, 62K), Dorothy Denning of the Naval Postgraduate 
School writes, "A Russian cyberespionage group that hacked into election networks before the 
2016 US presidential election is now attempting to steal coronavirus vaccine information from 
researchers in the US, UK, and Canada." She contends, "This latest incident illustrates yet again 
how, beyond carrying all of our phone, text and Internet communications, cyberspace is an 
active battleground, with cybercriminals, government agents and even military personnel 
probing weaknesses in corporate, national and even personal online defenses. Some of the 
most talented and dangerous cybercrooks and cyberwarriors come from Russia, which is a 
longtime meddler in other countries' affairs." She concludes, "Although Russia poses a major 
cyberthreat, it is not the only country that threatens the US in cyberspace. ... The good news is 
that actions to protect an organization's cybersecurity...that work against Russia also work 
against other threat actors."

Carroll: Site Connects Local Leaders With Funding, Information To Fight Drug 
Addiction. 
ONDCP Director Carroll was asked on RFD-TVVI (7/21, 5K) about the Administration's new 
website which enables local leaders to access funding and resources to combat drug addiction. 
Carroll said, "We worked with 16 federal agencies and departments. But, more importantly, we 
worked with the people out in rural America to find out their needs. And once we did that, we 
came together and produced this website: ruralcommunitytoolbox.org. It allows community 
members to go to one stop, one place to look for funding which of course is so critical. But it 
also allows them to do assessments, to sort of look at the data that is as recent as possible for 
their community, get an understanding of the problems there and finding out some best 
practices, best ways to get people into treatment and also prevent drug use from ever 
happening in the first place."
