I hear you. There is no blue print. I think our numbers are finally thorough and accurate. We haven't 
discussed it much, but technology and security have been a huge focus for me since I joined Elysium. 
Making slow but steady progress.

I suggest you focus on large issues first. . the discussions re personal use of plane . parties travel. 
may be relevant at the tippy tip of the margins but these answers should flow from the structure. 
On 
what form will you use the deduction. ? which business. , its structure. different buisnesses etc. 
Barry , what you will find is that there is very few answers to be found on point as people in leons 
position rarely make cases to tax court. 
exception being estate issues. . planes owned by farmers 
salesman, bankers. are usually small planes. meaningless to leons issue. 
large biz gets are usually 
owned by corporations. . 
the facts. there are approx 400,000 planes in the states. out of that large 
number only about 13, 000 total private jets. 
out of that class only 2000 large jets and most owned 
by corporations. 
how many people have business of leons size . not including his art work. 
You asked , me what do we do now. as I told Brad years ago. First and foremost is accurate 
numbers presented in an organized fashion. 
that is 80 percent of the grunt work. Once all the 
numbers are in shape , ie materials for the building of the financial architecture. . Leons goals must 
be addressed and programatic . 
this takes hours of discussion. . next . plans are drawn up, . 
modifications are made, 
issues of sec regulation, tax, control, succession. mechanics. all need to be 
planned and adjusted to meet the goals. 
You need to recognize that there are few , very few examples of the house that in leons case needs 
to be re built. most people with leons wealth have a serious family office with a huge stock portfolio. , 
not art. 
and of those , few hold dormant assets ie apollo. . Its been ten years since apollo went 
public. and the house needs total renovation. 
upgrades in tech, security, and the family has changed 
all very similar to architecting a house after the children have grown and left.
