Matej Minac and entitled Nicholas Winton ICA The Power of Good, will be 
premiered in New York on Wednesday, September 18, 2002 at 7:00 pm, in 
SYMPHONY SPACE, Peter Jay Sharp Theatre, at Broadway and 95th Street, New 
York. It recounts the story of courage and determination of one man, like 
Oscar Schindler and Raoul Wallenberg who cared for Others. Mr. Winton is 
one of the last living rescuers; he is now 93 and has been persuaded to 
travel by Concorde from England for the New York. opening. He will be in New 
York from 14th to 21st September, accompanied by some of the reAchildrenra2 he

Your presence at the premiere would be a great honour to Nicholas Winton, 
and his many friends in Great Britain and Czechoslovakia, and would of 
course signify the US publicIz:As recognition for his efforts done 60 years 
ago, which could still repeated in our present day situation and remain a 
beacon for future generations. However, having only just been called upon 
myself to help, I do realise that it is very late in the day for such a 
request and would perfectly understand that with your very busy schedule you 
might not be able to attend. But if you could use your considerable 
influence to procure a space for my old and dear friend on one of the main 
TV shows, I would consider it a great personal favour. 
The Czech sponsors are prepared to send by FedEx either to you or any one 
you suggest, the whole package of materials, plus a tape of the film in 
NTSC. 
Thank you in advance for considering my double request and in the hope that 
our paths will cross again in the not too distant future, I send you my very 
best regards and best wishes for your success in your challenging new 
position. 
Yours most sincerely,
