Investigations, "touted the move as a positive step in the fight against corruption." Erichs said, 
"HSI remains committed to investigating corrupt officials like Moreno Perez, who exploited the 
Venezuelan court system for his personal benefit and laundered ill-gained proceeds in the 
United States. HSI welcomes the announcement by the Department of State's Transnational 
Organized Crime Rewards Program and sees this as an important step to ensuring that Moreno 
Perez faces justice for the crimes he allegedly committed."

Delaware Beer Distributor Says He Wore A Wire In FBI Probe Of Biden's Fundraising. 
In a more than 6,600-word story, Politico Magazine (7/21, Schreckinger, 4.24M) reports that 
Delaware beer distributor Christopher Tigani, who served as a bundler for Joe Biden's 2008 
presidential campaign and was caught reimbursing his employees for contributions made in 
their name, agreed in 2010 to "wear a wire for the FBI and record people close to the then-vice 
president, seeking, he said, to confirm his belief that they knew of his reimbursements and 
investigate whether they, or others close to Biden, engaged in any quid pro quo deals with 
donors." In the end, "only Tigani himself faced federal charges." The information he "provided 
to federal investigators was `not actionable' according to a confidential 2012 letter sent from 
the U.S. Attorney's Office in Delaware to the United States Probation Office detailing his 
attempted FBI cooperation." In 2011, a Biden spokeswoman "denied he had any knowledge of 
Tigani's crimes. Biden's 2020 campaign repeated the denial." 
Federal Prosecutors Oppose Early Release For Missouri Businessman. 
The St. Louis Post-Dispatch (7/21, Patrick, 685K) reports, "Federal prosecutors are opposing 
businessman John G. Rallo's request for early release from prison, saying he'd failed to provide 
any `extraordinary and compelling reasons." According to the Post-Dispatch, "Earlier this 
month, Rallo, 55, cited his thyroid cancer and the coronavirus pandemic in a request for early 
release. In a court filing Tuesday, Assistant U.S. Attorney Hal Goldsmith said the cancer can be 
successfully treated in prison. Goldsmith also said the Bureau of Prison was making efforts to 
mitigate the spread of coronavirus. Rallo would be an `economic danger' to a community more 
susceptible to fraud due to the pandemic if released, Goldsmith continued, adding that some 
courts have found that defendants are unlikely to follow the orders of health authorities if 
released." 
FBI Intel Analyst Admitted To Viewing Child Pornography. 
The Daily Caller (7/21, Ross, 716K) reports, "A senior FBI intelligence analyst admitted during a 
polygraph test that he viewed child pornography of girls as young as nine years old, according 
to a report of the investigation obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation." The Daily Caller 
adds, "The analyst, who is not identified in the report, was fired from the FBI, but the Justice 
Department and its child exploitation unit declined to file criminal charges against him." 
According to the Daily Caller, "The report goes into greater detail about the investigation into 
the analyst than did a summary of the probe released by the Justice Department's inspector 
general in April. That summary said that the supervisory intelligence analyst (SIA) admitted to 
viewing and downloading child pornography several years earlier, but did not give any other 
details about the nature of the content."
