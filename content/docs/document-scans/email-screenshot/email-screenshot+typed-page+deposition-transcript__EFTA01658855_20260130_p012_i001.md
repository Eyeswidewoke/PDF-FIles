The AP (11/30, Long) reports, "The coronavirus vaccine inching toward approval in the U.S. is 
desperately anticipated by weary Americans longing for a path back to normal life," but 
"criminals are waiting, too, ready to use that desperation to their advantage, federal 
investigators say." The AP adds, "Homeland Security investigators are working with Pfizer, 
Moderna and dozens of other drug companies racing to complete and distribute the vaccine and 
treatments for the virus. The goal: to prepare for the scams that are coming, especially after 
the mess of criminal activity this year with phony personal protective equipment, false cures 
and extortion schemes." According to the AP, "Homeland Security Investigations started using 
its 7,000 agents in tandem with border, FDA and FBI officials to investigate scams, seize phony 
products and arrest hundreds of people. The effort is headquartered at the National Intellectual 
Property Rights Coordination Center, a government watchdog aimed at enforcement of its 
international trade laws and combating intellectual property theft." 
The Columbia (SC) State (11/30, Willetts, 390K) reports, "As a COVID-19 vaccine nears, 
bringing hope for an end to the pandemic, criminal organizations big and small will be looking 
to take advantage by peddling fake and potentially dangerous vaccines of their own, federal 
authorities warn. Scammers have been selling fake cures, treatments and protective equipment 
since the coronavirus pandemic began eight months ago, but Immigration and Customs 
Enforcement is "preparing for a surge in anticipated fraud" as drug companies approach 
approval from the Federal Drug Administration and prepare to distribute their vaccines, ICE 
announced Monday." The State adds, "The FBI and Federal Drug Administration have been 
working with major drug manufacturers, including Pfizer and Moderna, to prepare for 
distribution, and put protections in place to combat fraud, outlets report." 
US Charges Former Los Angeles Deputy Mayor In City Hall Corruption Probe. 
The Los Angeles Times (11/30, Rubin, 4.64M) reports, "A former senior aide to Los Angeles 
Mayor Eric Garcetti has been charged with racketeering conspiracy, bribery and other crimes in 
the ongoing federal probe into corruption at City Hall, according to court records made public 
Monday." Raymond Chan, "a deputy mayor who oversaw economic development for Garcetti in 
2016 and 2017, is the latest figure to be accused of playing a role in a sprawling scheme 
allegedly run by ousted Councilman Jose Huizar. Prosecutors say both men were involved in 
shaking down developers seeking help pushing downtown real estate projects through the city's 
approval process." The Times adds, "In a statement, U.S. Atty. Nick Hanna said Huizar, Chan 
and their network of associates `repeatedly violated the public trust by soliciting and accepting 
numerous cash bribes and other financial benefits, turning Huizar's City Council seat into a 
money-making criminal enterprise." 
The Los Angeles Daily News (11/30, 232K) reports, "Huizar, 52, of Boyle Heights, was 
charged in July in a 34-count indictment that alleged a conspiracy to violate the Racketeer 
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act in which Huizar agreed to accept at least $1.5 million 
in illicit financial benefits. The racketeering charge alleges 402 overt acts that Huizar and his 
co-conspirators committed to further their criminal enterprise, including bribery, honest services 
fraud and money laundering. The 41-count superseding indictment unsealed Monday adds 50 
overt acts to the RICO conspiracy count. The racketeering count now also charges Chan, who 
formerly was the general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety and, 
more recently, was the city's deputy mayor of economic development."

The AP (11/30) reports from San Francisco, "The head of San Francisco's Public Utilities 
Commission, which oversees millions of dollars in city contracts, was charged with bribery 
Monday in an ongoing federal probe of corruption." According to the AP, "General Manager 
Harlan Kelly was indicted for honest services wire fraud for allegedly accepting meals, cash and 
other gifts from a San Francisco construction company in exchange for providing insider 
information on public contracts. Kelly, who isn't in custody, denied wrongdoing but resigned his
