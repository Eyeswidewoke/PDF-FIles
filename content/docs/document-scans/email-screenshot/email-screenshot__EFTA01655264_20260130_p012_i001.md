Sen. Chuck Grassley Reiterates Plans to Investigate DOJ, FBI Over Trump Indictments 
The Gazette (07/09, Hoff) reported that Iowa U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley said Wednesday he is committed to 
investigating the members of the DOJ and the FBI who served during the Biden administration over indictments 
against President Donald Trump. Grassley mentioned the investigation during Trump's visit to Des Moines on July 
3 at an event to kick off a yearlong event celebrating 250 years of American independence. Speaking to the 
crowded audience, Grassley doubled down on his investigation into federal indictments against Trump, which he 
referred to as "political weaponization." According to the article, during a press call Wednesday, Grassley, who 
chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, told reporters that he believes wrongdoing by federal prosecutors and 
investigators that he has pointed out rises to "the criminal level" after it was reported that the FBI is investigating 
former CIA director John Brennan and former FBI Director James Comey over possible false statements to 
Congress. "I can't say that the wrongdoing I have pointed out so far is more in the area of political weaponization of 
the FBI and the Department of Justice, and I can't say it rose to the criminal level, but evidently the Department of 
Justice has reason to believe that crime has been committed, and I'll have to defer to them. That's their job, not 
mine," Grassley told reporters. "My focus is on transparency and accountability for the American people." 
FBI Citizens Academy of Indianapolis Hosts Digital Defense Training Seminar 
WTWO/WAWV (NBC-2) (07/09, Gastineau) reported that small and medium-sized business owners and 
entrepreneurs gathered at the Terre Haute Chamber of Commerce to learn about cybersecurity. Around 30 people 
attended the seminar to learn ways to help prevent cyber-attacks and what to do if they or their business falls on 
the wrong end of a cyber-attack. Shelley Klingerman is the Outreach Director of the FBI Citizens Academy of 
Indianapolis, and she mentioned how an event like this can give important information to certain types of 
businesses. "We hope they gain some steps that they can take to protect their data," Klingerman said. "And in the 
event, it is compromised, some resources and initial steps that can start to be taken to regain that information." 
FBI Report on Sig Sauer 'Uncommanded Discharge' Incident Goes Public 
OutdoorLife (07/09, Snow) reported that a report by the FBI's Ballistic Research Facility that was recently made 
public has placed the Sig Sauer M18/P320 series of striker-fired semi-auto pistols back into the spotlight. The 
report was based on the BRF's tests of a Sig Sauer M18 that had been issued to a motor officer with the Michigan 
State Police. That pistol experienced an "uncommanded discharge" in July 2024, according to the document. The 
incident occurred while the gun was holstered, and in front of multiple witnesses. It joins a substantial list of 
similar reports, many of which have resulted in lawsuits. According to the article, the results of the August 2024 
report were inconclusive, but that hasn't stopped a renewed flow of online speculation by people questioning the 
pistol's design. The issue is whether the P320 and its variants are capable of an uncommanded discharge.
