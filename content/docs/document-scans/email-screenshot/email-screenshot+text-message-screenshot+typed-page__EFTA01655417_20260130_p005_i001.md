COUNTERINTELLIGENCE 
Sen. Tom Cotton Warns Biden-Era Pentagon Official Accused of Spying for Iran Still Has Access to U.S. 
Intelligence 
The New York Post (09/03, Moore) reported that Sen. Tom Cotton has warned that a Biden-era Pentagon official, 
Ariane Tabatabai, accused of spying for Iran, still has access to U.S. intelligence. Tabatabai, a senior policy advisor at 
the Pentagon, was allegedly involved in an influence operation run by Tehran's Foreign Ministry and has been 
suspected of collaborating with the Islamic regime. Sen. Cotton has urged the FBI and Pentagon to investigate the 
matter, citing concerns that Iranian government-linked affiliates may be influencing U.S. government operations 
and posing a significant danger to national security. "While the Biden administration ignored repeated calls from 
Republicans to remove officials affiliated with IEI and the Iranian government, the FBI and the DoD should now 
correct this mistake," the letter advised.

Vinge had a security clearance from his work with government contractor Tetra Tech, which may have raised 
suspicions. The article noted that an investigation appears to have been part of a larger effort to monitor 
individuals associated with TecNICA, an organization that aided Nicaragua during the Sandinista revolution, with 
the FBI allegedly overplaying its hand and eventually dropping the case.
