Japan is essential =or Asia's success in this regard, while failure on this front could be dev=stating. Thus, a binary view of 
Japan as either "in decline" or =quot;on the rise" is an unhelpful way for the United States to consider policy options in 
the future. The important point is ho= the two countries act as catalysts for cooperative strategies across a ra=ge of 
sectors. 
Japan's Troubles 
There is no doubt t=at Japan is suffering on a number of fronts. Economic growth has been anem=c for almost two 
decades-including five recessionary periods-and an aging =opulation will continue to drag down growth and consume 
national wealth. These challenges are most acute in Jap=n's countryside. The lack of opportunity has driven younger 
residents to b=g cities, feeding a vicious economic cycle for rural towns and prefectures= 
Fiscal stimulus opt=ons for the central government are limited after years of deficit spending= and Japan now spends 
nearly one-quarter of its national budget on debt se=vicing (compared with about 7 percent in the United States). 
Moreover, Japan's t=agic triple disaster-the earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear accident-in Marc= 2011 will require 
taxpayer support for an extended recovery period. The c=untry faces a chronic energy shortfall after the earthquake 
shook Japan's faith in nuclear power and cut a quarte= of its electricity production. 
This is all made mo=e difficult given the domestic political environment. Petty political game=manship and gridlock 
exacerbate these problems and delay effective solutio=s. 
Japan's Strengths</=pan> 
But it's not all ba= news out of Japan, and the situation is not as black and white as it seem=. After all, part of the reason 
that Japan will soon have the world's high=st median age is because it leads the world in life expectancy, thanks in large 
part to a solid healthcare syste=, low crime rate, and high per capita GOP. The demographics are both an ec=nomic 
challenge and a sign of success. 
There is also sufficient fertile ground for Japan to reinvent itself economically. Japan conti=ues to innovate in the fields 
of manufacturing, renewable energy, and heal=hcare. One sign of this is Japanese firms and individuals receive the most 
U.S. patents of any country outsiderof the United States, accounting for about one-fifth of the total and thre= times the 
number of its closest rival, Germany. 
In addition, Japan =oasts eleven Nobel Prize laureates since 2000, spanning chemistry, physics= physiology, and 
medicine. And basic research in areas such as advanced ma=erials and stem cells could have dramatic economic and 
social impacts, provided Japan can keep making progress foste=ing entrepreneurship that capitalizes on this work. 
Japan's economy is =till the third largest in the world. It has a well-educated, productive po=ulation and an adaptive and 
globally connected corporate sector, despite t=e headwinds buffeting some of Japan's most famous brands such as 
Sharp and Panasonic. Less well known are small =ut highly profitable Japanese firms created in the past two decades 
such a= Axell and Simplex. Japan is also an important investor overseas, becoming=the world's second largest source of 
foreign direct investment outflows in 2011 and China's biggest investor= 
Such interdependenc= in East Asia is one of the few positive factors helping to mitigate regio=al conflict over long-
standing territorial and historical disputes.=/p> 
Vital Partner in As=a 
A key question is h=w this interdependence will evolve and how actively Japan, the United Stat=s, and others will try to 
shape it in a coordinated and inclusive fashion.=Declining trade barriers and the diversification of economic growth in 
East Asia could help bolster the sense of community,=but only if the politics of regionalism can be managed 
effectively.=/p>
