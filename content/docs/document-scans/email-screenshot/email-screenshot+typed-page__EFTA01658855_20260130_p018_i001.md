population of a maximum-security prison could be for him, according to recordings that Nxivm's 
former publicist, Frank Parlato, posted on his blog the Frank Report. 'Well, with these charges

Robotics and Automation News (11/30, Edwards) reports, "The General Service Administration 
(GSA) has installed an automated record filing and retrieval system from robotics technology 
company AutoStore inside a recently completed Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) central 
records complex in Winchester, Virginia. The facility includes the country's first robotic filing and 
retrieval warehouse in a GSA project." According to RAN, "Certified by the National Archives and 
Records Administration, this secure, 'state-of-the-art', 250,000-square-foot facility was built to 
consolidate and contain records previously housed within 256 field offices around the world. 
After comparing several automation technologies in consultation with Swisslog, an AutoStore 
integration partner, GSA and the FBI selected the AutoStore solution for its cube storage 
technology to automate the filing and retrieval operation of more than 2 billion pages of official

Atlas Formally Resigns As White House Adviser. 
Fox News (11/30, Singman, 27.59M) reports on its website that Scott Atlas, President Trump's 
special adviser on the coronavirus pandemic since August, on Monday "formally resigned from 
his post" after speaking with the President. Fox News "exclusively obtained Atlas's resignation 
letter," which "touted the Trump administration's work on the coronavirus pandemic, while 
wishing 'all the best' to the incoming Biden administration." 
However, the New York Times (11/30, Stolberg, 18.61M) says his departure "was not 
entirely unexpected," though Atlas "had the ear of one person who mattered: Mr. Trump." The 
AP (11/30, Miller) reports that since joining the White House, the Stanford University 
neuroradiologist, "who had no formal experience in public health or infectious diseases," had 
"clashed with top government scientists, including Dr. Anthony Fauci and Dr. Deborah Birx, as 
he resisted stronger efforts to contain the COVID-19 pandemic that has killed more than 
267,000 Americans." The Hill (11/30, Samuels, 2.98M) says Atlas "pushed the widely disputed 
herd immunity theory," and "several other members of the White House coronavirus task force 
raised concerns about Atlas or openly disputed his views." 
The Washington Post (11/30, Dawsey, Abutaleb, 14.2M) reports that while Atlas "fell out 
of favor with senior White House advisers in recent weeks, he was for several months the only 
medical adviser the president met with regularly, according to several senior administration 
officials." The Post adds White House senior adviser Jared Kushner "brought in Atlas, who 
informally advised the president for several weeks before he was officially made a special 
government employee this summer with a 130-day detail, which expires this week," but aides 
"noted the president could have extended Atlas's tenure if he had desired to do so." 
Azar: Some Americans May Get Vaccinated Before End Of Year. 
Reuters (11/30, Whitcomb, Caspani) reports HHS Secretary Azar on Monday indicated some 
Americans "could begin receiving coronavirus vaccinations before Christmas," and that "Pfizer 
Inc's COVID-19 vaccine could be authorized and shipped within days of a Dec. 10 meeting of 
outside advisers to the Food and Drug Administration tasked with reviewing trial data and 
recommending whether it warrants approval. A vaccine from Moderna Inc could follow a week 
later, he said, after the company announced on Monday it would apply for U.S. and European
