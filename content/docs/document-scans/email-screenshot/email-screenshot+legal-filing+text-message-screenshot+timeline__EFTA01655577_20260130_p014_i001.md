Forbes (02/05, Doffman) reported that Google confirmed the latest "Al driven" attack on its account holders — for 
which you can read Gmail. The article highlighted that the intended victim was a highly tech savvy engineer, who 
described it as "the most sophisticated phishing attack I've ever seen." The article explained that the attack started 
with a call from Google's support team, warning that someone had tried to access the would-be victim's account 
overseas. The number looked legitimate and was backed up by an email from a Google domain. It went on for 
some time, and was only thwarted when the scam caller's fake boss got on the line and slipped up. The article 
noted that Google wants to emphasize that it should never have gotten that far; the company asked the outlet to 
"please reiterate to your readers that Google will not call you to reset your password or troubleshoot account 
issues." The article confirmed that Google has suspended that would-be scammer's account, "which abused an 
unverified Workspace account to send these misleading emails," and says it is "hardening our defenses against 
abusers leveraging g.co references at sign up to further protect users." The article mentioned that the FBI has 
responded to the latest wave of banking scam calls with a repeated warning to never take such calls, that banks will 
never place them. The article indicated that the FBI's blanket warning on this is clear: "Legitimate customer, 
security, or tech support companies will not initiate unsolicited contact with individuals." 
Law Enforcement, Victim Resilience Lead To 35% Year-Over-Year Drop In Ransomware Payments 
UPI (02/05, Benson) reported that payments for ransomware declined year-over-year through 2024 for the first 
time since 2022, according to data shared by blockchain analysis firm Chainanalysis on Wednesday. The total 
volume of ransom payments decreased year-over-year by approximately 35%, according to the Chainanalysis 202S 
Crypto Crime Report, which highlighted Russian ransomware group LockBit and Iran-based ransomware strains, 
Akira/Fog, and INC/Lynx, as bellwethers of the year's trends. The article emphasized that ransomware attackers, 
however, have gotten faster with negotiations often starting within hours of data exfiltration. Attackers have ranged 
from "nation-state actors" to ransomware-as-a-service operations, lone characters and data theft extortion groups. 
The article mentioned that LockBit claimed in June last year to have breached the U.S. Federal Reserve and 
threatened to release 33 terabytes of sensitive data, including "Americans' banking secrets." LockBit previously 
conducted a number of high-profile ransomware attacks on companies, banks and government departments 
around the world since 2019, including the U.S. DOJ, Japan's Port of Nagoya, Boeing, British Royal Mail and Fulton 
County in Georgia. The article pointed out that Dmitry Yuryevich Khoroshev, a Russian national accused of leading 
LockBit, was indicted and sanctioned last year in May by the U.S. and its allies. It came with a $10 million bounty 
for Khoroshev's arrest. The article indicated that LockBit saw H2 payments decrease by roughly 79% after it was 
disrupted early last year by the FBI and Britain's National Crime Agency which showcased the "effectiveness of 
international law enforcement collaboration." It published as high as 68% repeat or straight-up fabricated victims 
on its data leak site, according to experts.

Scandal 
The New York Post (02/05, Shakhnazarova) reported that Prince Andrew is reportedly too "terrified" to ever set
