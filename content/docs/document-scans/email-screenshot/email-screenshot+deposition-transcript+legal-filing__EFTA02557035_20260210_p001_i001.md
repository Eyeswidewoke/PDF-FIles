RE: follow up 
See Article II on pgs 1-2 of the 2006 Trust Doc attached to my last email f=r language related to distribution of 'trust 
accounting income' from opera=ing profits of 'relevant companies' which you will see detailed in II(A)3.=The 'relevant 
companies' are the Apollo entities Leon had ownership intere=ts in that he contributed into the GRATs that poured into 
the 2006 Trust. =here isn't specific language surrounding the principal. The trusts owns th= interests in Black Family 
Partners and the monetization of the value of t=e BRH interests would not constitute 'trust accounting income' from 
'opera=ing profits' and would therefore remain in the trust. 
I will next forward a summary entitled 'History/Structure' that I wrote for=myself early on as I was trying to come up to 
speed on what had been put i= place. I believe I left you a hard copy which was behind the org chart of=Black Family 
Partners. There is a section on the first page with comments =n FLPs-I was in an education mode and, with hindsight, did 
not fully under=tand the control issues but I think otherwise this will help you understan= where we came from. 
Importantly, you will see there were 2 sets of GRATs. The termination of GR=Ts A-K went as planned. But the second set, 
GRATs L-O lacked sufficient ca=h to make the final annuity payment to Leon so we did an inkind transfer o= the Black 
Family Partners these GRATs owned to Leon and then he contribut=d these into a new GRAT, the Judah 2009 Trust. We 
made that a 4 year GRAT =nstead of 2 years like the original ones we did because I felt we would no= have generated 
enough cash in 2 years to make the annuity payments to Leo=.

> Jeffrey, thinking back through dialogs with Carlyn & Elyse and looking at=some of my old notes from those dialogs that 
relate to our conversation th=s morning I offer the following: 
> Regarding the issue of why turning off the income right now works is that=it would be the independent trustees 
turning off the income right, not Leo=, and that the 2006 Trust was drafted purposely in anticipation of this. l=believe 
this relates to the language on page 30 in the attached. 
> Also, Ada (from US Trust) at one point had suggested to Carlyn that we co=sider having the trustees turn of the income 
right in the 2006 Trust and t=en decant the assets from the 2006 Trust into a new trust before proceedin= with the Art 
Partnership to insure a cleaner transaction. 
> Also, on the subject of the 2006 Trust and other trust paying their own t=xes-important implication for Black Family 
Partners would be that we no lo=ger have a single taxpayer.
