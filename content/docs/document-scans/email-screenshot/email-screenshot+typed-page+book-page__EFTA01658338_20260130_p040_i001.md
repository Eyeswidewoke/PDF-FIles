Chinese Hackers Infiltrated Vatican Network. The New York Times (7/28, Sanger, 
Wong, Horowitz, 18.61M) reports Chinese hackers "infiltrated the Vatican's computer networks 
in the past three months, a private monitoring group has concluded, in an apparent espionage 
effort before the beginning of sensitive negotiations with Beijing." While "Chinese hackers and 
state authorities have often used cyberattacks to try to gather information on groups of 
Buddhist Tibetans, Muslim Uighurs and Falun Gong practitioners outside China," the Times says 
this "appears to be the first time" they "have been publicly caught directly hacking into the 
Vatican and the Holy See's Study Mission to China."

ABC World News TonightVi (7/28, story 7, 0:15, Muir, 7.32M) reported the USDA is urging 
people "if you receive a package, leave it sealed, don't throw it out, and contact" the agency. 
Report: US, Russia Space Security Talks End. 
The Washington Free Beacon (7/28, Beyrer, 78K) reports the US and Russia "held their first 
talks regarding space militarization since 2013 on Monday, ending without any public progress, 
the Wall Street Journal reported" Tuesday. The talks in Vienna were "intended to decrease 
tension and increase cooperation," but "competing views of how to regulate international 
conduct in space...left the talks without a mutually agreed-upon foundation." Neither Moscow 
nor Washington released public statements regarding the talks. 
US Sanctions Two Former Venezuelan Officials. 
Reuters (7/28, Psaledakis) reports the US on Tuesday imposed sanctions "on two former 
officials of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's government, barring them from traveling to 
the United States over accusations they were involved in significant corruption." Secretary of 
State Pompeo said in a statement that the two former officials, Luis Motta and Eustiquio Jose 
Lugo Gomez, "had accepted bribes and kickbacks" to enrich themselves. The officials were 
"previously blacklisted by the United States last year in a decision that froze any of their U.S. 
assets and generally prohibits Americans from dealing with them." 
Gallup Poll: Global View Of US Leadership Remains Weak. 
USA Today (7/28, Pineda, 10.31M) reports that "for the third year in a row, Germany remains 
the top-rated global power, while the image of U.S., Chinese and Russian leadership stays 
consistently weak, according to a new Gallup poll." The poll results released Monday "measure 
global views of major powers and show worldwide approval of U.S. leadership continues to be 
'historically low.' Globally, 33% approved of U.S. leadership, a slight increase from a previous 
low of 30% during the first year of Donald Trump's presidency." Gallup said the world's view of 
the US "dropped 19 points in 2017, between President Barack Obama's last year in office and 
Trump's first year," and "the situation hasn't changed much since."
