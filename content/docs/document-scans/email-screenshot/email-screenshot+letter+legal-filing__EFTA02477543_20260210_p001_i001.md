Transaction complete ! 
<=iv> 
When we had our meeting in your ho=e in Bedford. You asked me for my help. I told yo= multiple times that i 
thought it was a very bad idea, in that I pre=erred to have no financial interactions. I dont h=ve many friends and didnt 
want money to intereferAlexandersson managing your accounting , le=al, investments. reporting, trusts etc. When I 
told you in no =ncertain terms that I firmly believed she was incompetent you =dmonished me for " speaking out of 
both sides of my mouth ". =AO With regard Brad Wechsler , there is no " both sides. =quota. I have consistantly 
maintained since day one that he was high=y unsuited for the job. When you initially asked me to help convince=him to 
take the role , promising him a postion to manage mira=e investments I sent you a note saying instead you should =AO 
pay up and get first class people. I have reiterated 
<=span> 
With Brad out of the office and una=le to run his usual interference , the level of his total and =tter incompetence was 
brought clearly, front and center. =AO He may be a step up from Eileen, but, if he is, then it is=C2 certainly not by 
much, A major difference i= that Eileen knew she was over her head. Brad struts his stupiditly =henever he gets a 
chance. 
A critical ex=mple. - =span>Though you and I have spent many many hours discu=sing the =span>importance of 
care and attention to details and mechani=s. with regard Phaidon I was not shown one single docum=nt , not one.!! 
Brad wanted to keep it private between he, and=his so called " advisors " ho=ever as he was out of the office during 
the most important transaction of =he year, I did get to spend time with joslin=Joe and john, - the situation in your 
office is totally =udicrous - to summarize - the list I provided to Brad I=st Decemb=r - of things I thought were a 
priority to=get done - still remains in the whole unresolved.= 
The IT, is virtually untouched and is still in d=sperate need of a format - reporting flawed cumbersome and inaccurat= . 
all done by hand as one -off exercises , when either you or b=ad ask for it - airplane: re structure, (my only suggested 
priority=in =une ) is really ,no further ahead, consultants up th= kazoo but nothing at all done.( the office was told by 
Brad not to =hare the outside proposals with me - brad has no =dea even as to what questions to ask. he knows little of 
finance, is bulls=itted over by almost everyone in the office. a little man , us=ng your power, to appear larger . Eileen 
was self aware enough to know she=was over her head , that is a huge difference. bad info is ram=ant a simple
