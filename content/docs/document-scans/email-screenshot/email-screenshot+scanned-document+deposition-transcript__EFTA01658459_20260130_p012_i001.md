Editorial: US "Must Unite" To Fight Foreign Electoral Interference. 
In an editorial, The Minneapolis Star Tribune (8/10, 1.04M) writes that in the face of electoral 
interference and in order to protect "our democracy, America - from the White House to 
Congress to the tech sector to everyday citizens - should unite as it would against any external 
attack." The Tribune cites a recent statement from William Evanina, director of the National 
Counterintelligence and Security Center, citing the motivations of China, Russia, and Iran in 
affecting the 2020 election. The outlet argues a declassification of the "intelligence assessment 
on the threat from the three countries would also benefit citizens and Silicon Valley, which must 
play its role in resisting disinformation disseminated by Moscow, Beijing, Tehran or elsewhere." 
The Tribune concludes election interference "should be acknowledged for what it is - an attack 
on the DNA of our democratic way of life." 
US, EU Evaluating Privacy Shield Follow-up Following EU Ruling. 
Bloomberg (8/10, Chapman, 4.73M) reports the Department of Commerce and "the European 
Union have started talks to evaluate the potential for 'an enhanced EU-US Privacy Shield 
framework' after the EU's top court threw out the current system for shipping data across the 
Atlantic." In a joint statement issued on Monday, Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross and EU 
Justice Commissioner Didier Reynders said both sides recognize the "vital importance of data 
protection and the significance of cross-border data transfers to our citizens and economies." 
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS 
FBI Releases Surveillance Photos In Probe Of Kentucky Woman's Disappearance. 
The Lexington (KY) Herald-Leader (8/9, Spears, 257K) reports, "The Federal Bureau of 
Investigation in Louisville has released new surveillance photos of vehicles related to the 
investigation of Crystal Rogers' 2015 disappearance in Nelson County. 'The surveillance 
photographs ... are ones where we need the public's assistance in identifying the drivers of 
those vehicles,' FBI spokesman Timothy Beam told the Herald-Leader Sunday. 'We believe the 
drivers of these vehicles may have important information related to Crystal's disappearance." 
Rogers "disappeared in Nelson County in July 2015, and the case has since gained national 
attention. The FBI was called into Nelson County on July 24 to help the sheriff's office retrieve 
possible human remains. Since then, the FBI has become the lead agency on the case." Beam 
"reiterated Sunday there was no update on whether or not those remains belonged to Rogers, 
but the FBI is now offering a $25,000 reward for information leading to the current 
whereabouts of Rogers." 
WDRB-TV Louisville, KY (8/10, 179K) reports from Bardstown, Kentucky, "The FBI was 
back in Bardstown Monday evening, canvassing a neighborhood in connection with the Crystal 
Rogers investigation." The FBI "said they went to Lookout Court in Valley View Estates to talk to 
neighbors after receiving multiple tips on the agency's case task force website, though it is 
unclear at this time what those tips were and how they relate to the Rogers investigation. The 
IRS was also in the neighborhood for the canvass, according to WDRB's Fallon Glick. Agents 
spent about 15 minutes at each home talking to residents, who said they did not want to 
discuss the conversations with WDRB News out of respect for the family and didn't want to 
jeopardize the investigation. This comes less than 24 hours after the agency announced that 
they had finished 'it's judicially authorized search activities' in Bardstown and thanked the 
Nelson County Sheriff's Office."
