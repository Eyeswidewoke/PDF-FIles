pressure on several fronts. Harztler introduced her version of the bill last month while Cruz 
dropped his in the evening on Tuesday." According to the Examiner, "Their goal is to empower 
the State Department to ensure that any espionage and illicit tech-transfer activity makes one 
ineligible for entry into the U.S. To do so, the Republicans aim to update the Immigration and 
Naturalization Act because, under current law, spies from China or elsewhere who are expelled 
from the U.S. are still allowed to then reapply for visas to regain entry." 
Report: US To Order Drastic Reduction In Chinese Diplomats. 
The Washington Times (7/28, Gertz, 492K) reports exclusively that the Administration is 
"preparing to order China to sharply reduce the number of diplomats posted in the United 
States to levels equal to the number of American diplomats stationed in China, senior State 
Department officials said." The official said the move "seeks in part to reduce the burden on FBI 
counterintelligence agents, who in recent months have devoted 2,000 special agents to 
catching Chinese spies and their agents." 
Op-Ed: The New "Cold War" Between The US And China Is A Dangerous Myth. 
In an op-ed in the Washington Post (7/28, 14.2M) reports former DNI Dan Coats writes, "China 
dominates current discussions of foreign policy, primarily because it poses the greatest 
challenges to our national interests. But China also dominates the discussion because the 
Covid-19 pandemic emerged there, a fact that has become a major theme in the President 
Trump's campaign for reelection. The trade relationship seems to be deteriorating along with 
the political relationship." He concludes, "Policies by the US and our allies must be aimed at 
expanding the diplomatic and political space to work these issues creatively and productively. 
... And it will also require the rebuilding of alliance cohesion and multilateral institutions capable 
of responding to China's long-term strategic vision with policies of comparable coherence and 
strength. Only the US can forge those tools. Our allies and other like-minded nations are 
beginning to recognize the threats China poses to our common future." 
Singapore Spy Case Stirs Fears China Recruiting On Island State. 
Reuters (7/28, Geddie, Aravindan) reports the case of a Singaporean "caught spying for China 
in the US has reawakened fears over China recruiting intelligence assets on an island state 
which has won trust among Western governments while keeping on good terms with Beijing." 
Jun Wei Yeo, "a 39-year-old academic who also goes by the name Dickson Yeo, pleaded guilty 
in a US court on Friday to acting as an illegal agent of Chinese intelligence." He will be 
"sentenced in October and faces up to 10 years in prison." Singapore's home ministry "said in a 
brief statement on Sunday that it had been aware of Yeo's case since his arrest by US 
authorities in November, and he is receiving consular assistance." Court documents "show Yeo 
was lured into becoming a Chinese asset four years earlier while attending a forum in Beijing to 
give a presentation on Southeast Asian politics." 
Revised Missile Pact With US To Facilitate South Korean Spy Satellite. 
Reuters (7/28, Shin) reports Deputy National Security Adviser Kim Hyun-chong "said on 
Tuesday. South Korea and the US have agreed to revise their joint missile guidelines to facilitate 
South Korea's plans to build a spy satellite by easing rules on rocket propellants." Under the 
current guidelines, "last amended in 2017, South Korea cannot build rockets using solid-fuel 
engines, posing a setback for its plans to develop a military spy satellite by the late 2020s." Kim 
"said at a briefing in Seoul that the change in the propellant rules took effect on Tuesday." He 
said, "This revision would allow us to have an unblinking eye that monitors the Korean 
peninsula 24/7. If we fire low-altitude launch vehicles based on our own solid fuel propellant as 
planned, it would dramatically improve our military's reconnaissance capabilities."
