New Lawsuit From Jeffrey Epstein Victims Accuses FBI of Enabling His Sex Trafficking 
The Independent (02/15, Reinstein) reported that twelve anonymous Jeffrey Epstein victims have filed a new 
lawsuit against the FBI, which they accuse of "repeated and continued failures" that allowed their abuser to run his 
sex trafficking operation for more than 20 years. The lawsuit, filed Wednesday in the Southern District of New York, 
alleges that the FBI turned a blind eye to evidence of Epstein's crimes since the 1990s. The article noted that 
between 1996 and 2006, the FBI received "reports, complaints and tips concerning the illegal sex trafficking of 
women and underage minors, sex abuse and human rights violations committed by Jeffrey Epstein and associates," 
the lawsuit claims. According to the article, the FBI allegedly "had photographs, videos and interviews and hard 
evidence of child prostitution" but failed to conduct a thorough investigation. The Guardian (02/15, Helmore), Fox 
News (02/15, Ruiz), and UPI (02/15, Hughes) also reported on the story.
