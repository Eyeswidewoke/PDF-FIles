Lexis Nexis, she holds a dentist license. Does she practice? Does she still work at JSC Interiors?) 
As per the last approved KYC (1790724) for Karyna Shuliak, her only SOW company is an interior designing firm called 
JSC Interiors LLC, on whom we have done all research. However as per the latest Research report ran on Karyna, shows 
that she holds a Dentist License from 2015 in CA & FL states of US. This report also evidences that she is renewing her 
license and her listed address, DOB & first 5 numbers of the SSN number matches with her profile, refer Pgs 4 & 5 from 
the report. Last approved KYC (1790724) lists Karyna's payslip from JSC Interiors LLC for the month of June 2017 as SOW 
evidence, also attached in this email for reference. 
In light of the above, kindly provide the following : 
• 
More info on Karyna's dental practice, i.e. please confirm whether her dental practice contributes 25% or more 
of her income, from SOW perspective, so researches can be run accordingly. 
• 
Finally, kindly confirm that she continues to work for JSC Interiors 11C and this is still part of her SOW? 
Request you to kindly provide response to this query at the earliest convenience so we can re-submit this case at the 
earliest, as this is the only unresolved rejection point in this case, thanks.
