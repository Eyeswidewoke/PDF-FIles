Liability Statement. American Express Travel Related Services Company, Inc. and its 
parent, subsidiaries, affiliates and representatives (collectively, "Amex") act as an agent for 
travel suppliers and you understand and agree that Amex shall not be liable for any loss, 
injury, expense or damage to persons or property resulting, directly or indirectly, from (1) 
the acts of omissions of travel suppliers, including but not limited to delays, overbooking's,

Intermediary Disclosure. Amex assists you in finding travel suppliers and making 
arrangements that meet your individual needs. We consider various factors in identifying 
travel suppliers to you and recommending specific itineraries. In this role, we are acting as 
an independent third party and not as a fiduciary. We want you to be aware that certain 
suppliers pay us commissions as well as incentives for reaching sales targets or other 
goals, and from time to time may also provide incentives to our travel counselors. Certain 
suppliers may also provide compensation to us for various marketing and administrative 
services that we perform for them, such as granting them access to our marketing 
channels, participating in marketing programs and supporting technology initiatives. In 
addition, we receive compensation from suppliers when customers use the American 
Express Card or other American Express products to pay for supplier products and 
services. From time to time we may enter into other business relationships with suppliers 
and these arrangements, including levels and types of compensation and incentives we 
receive, are subject to change. In identifying suppliers and recommending itineraries, we 
may consider a number of factors, including supplier availability and your preferences. 
The relationships we have with suppliers may also influence the suppliers we identify and 
the itineraries we recommend.
