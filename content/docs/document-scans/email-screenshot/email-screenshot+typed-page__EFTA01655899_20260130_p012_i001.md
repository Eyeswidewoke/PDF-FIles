Border Patrol Issues Warning After 'Significant Rise' In Attacks On Agents 
Newsweek (08/12, Rahman) reported that the U.S. Border Patrol El Paso Sector said it has seen a "significant rise" 
in attacks on border agents by migrants and issued a warning on the legal consequences of assaulting a federal 
officer. The article stated that sixty-six El Paso Sector Border Patrol agents have been assaulted in 2023-2024 fiscal 
year so far. The 2023-2024 fiscal year began on October 1, 2023, and ends September 30, 2024. According to U.S. 
Customs and Border Protection (CBP) data, 104 El Paso Sector agents were assaulted in 2022-2023 fiscal year. 
According to the article, the El Paso Sector Border Patrol said it is working alongside the FBI and the U.S. Attorney's 
Office to bring suspected attackers to justice. Authorities blamed the rise in assaults on an "influx of migrants" 
unlawfully entering the U.S. from the southern border. Texas faces the most significant obstacles in deterring 
unauthorized entry into the U.S. due to its extensive border with Mexico. Law enforcement officials said violent 
confrontations occur when migrants and smugglers attempt to evade border agents. According to reports from the 
CBP, migrants allegedly threw rocks and glass bottles at agents when evading apprehension from authorities.
