The Atlanta Journal-Constitution (9/18, Deere, scott Trubey, 895K) reports two years ago, US 
Attorney Byung J. "BJay" Pak "announced he had devoted nine prosecutors to the corruption 
investigation of City Hall" in Atlanta "-- a stunning amount of resources. The government had 
also added more IRS and FBI agents to the case, prompting a former federal prosecutor to 
compare the assets at Pak's disposal to Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation." 
Thus far, the biggest "payoff of that investment was announced Wednesday, when prosecutors 
made public a federal grand jury indictment of Jim Beard, the city's chief financial officer under 
former Mayor Kasim Reed." Beard "faces eight criminal charges including wire fraud and illegal 
possession of machine guns." 
Former Aide To Richard Daley Tied To Federal Corruption Investigation In Chicago. 
The Chicago Sun-Times (9/18, 875K) reports When Richard M. Daley was mayor of Chicago, 
"one of his most powerful - if least visible - aides was Victor Reyes, Daley's City Hall patronage 
chief." Reyes, now a major Chicago lobbyist, "still likes to stay out of the spotlight. But that's 
getting harder as federal authorities continue to pursue their wide-ranging investigation of 
political corruption in Chicago and the suburbs, a dragnet that so far has resulted in criminal 
charges against" several politicians. Reyes "hasn't been charged with any crime," but "he or one 
of his firms has come onto the radar of federal authorities in two of the cases they're 
investigating, records show." 
Federal Prosecutors Charge Six With Bribing Amazon Employees For Marketplace 
Advantage. 
CBS News (9/18, Brooks, 3.68M) reports federal prosecutors announced Friday that "six people 
allegedly conspired to bribe Amazon employees and contractors in order to gain a competitive 
advantage on the retailer's marketplace." DOJ says "those charged posed as consultants and 
worked with third-party sellers whose products had previously been removed from Amazon 
Marketplace get the items back on the platform. The six then paid a total of more than 
$100,000 in bribes to least 10 Amazon employees in exchange for their restoring the banned 
products or services, the indictment alleges." 
Reuters (9/18, Bose, Dastin) reported the Justice Department announced Friday that a 
grand jury in the State of Washington has indicted six individuals on charges of conspiring to 
bribe Amazon employees and contractors in an effort to obtain advantages on Amazon 
marketplace. The defendants are charged with using "bribery and fraud" to "reinstate products 
and accounts that Amazon had suspended or blocked entirely from doing business on its 
marketplace." Reuters added, "Those indicted planned to pay over $100,000 in exchange for an 
unfair competitive advantage on the Amazon marketplace - a platform where third-party 
merchants sell goods, the Department said." An Amazon spokesperson said, "We are especially 
disappointed by the actions of this limited group of now former employees, and appreciate the 
collaboration and support from law enforcement to bring them and the bad actors they were 
entwined with to justice." 
Bloomberg (9/18, Soper, 4.73M) reported FBI supervisor in Seattle Raymond Duda 
explained, "Realizing they could not compete on a level playing field, the subjects turned to 
bribery and fraud in order to gain the upper hand. What's equally concerning, not only did they 
attempt to increase sales of their own products, but sought to damage and discredit their 
competitors." To Amazon merchant turned consultant Jason Boyce, who runs the firm 
Avenue7Media, "This is just the tip of the tip of the iceberg. You can find people in online selling 
forums willing to put you in touch with someone who can get into Amazon's system to help you 
sell more products or sabotage your competitors." The Financial Times (9/18, Subscription 
Publication, 1.34M) also reports.
