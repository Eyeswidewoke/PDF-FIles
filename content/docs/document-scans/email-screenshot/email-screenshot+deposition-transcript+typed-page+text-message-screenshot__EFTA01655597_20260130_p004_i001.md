out an in-depth questionnaire about their participation in those probes, a step they worry could lead to 
termination. The article added that the FBI turned over personnel details of several thousand employees but 
identified them only through their unique identifier code rather than by name. The prospect of demotions, 
discipline or even termination for career agents has unnerved officials inside the FBI. Natalie Bara, the president of 
the FBI Agents Association, which also sued, told reporters Tuesday that one agent who had spent hours recovering 
body parts from the Potomac River following last week's plane crash "had to return to the office — not to debrief, 
not to work on cases, but to fill out a mandatory survey on any involvement in investigations related to Jan. 6." 
"This is the reality for our agents today. They're being scrutinized, placed on lists, and facing the possibility of losing 
their jobs," she said. The agents who brought Tuesday's two lawsuits are not identified by name and are instead 
referred to as anonymous "John and Jane Does." They say they were told on Sunday either to fill out surveys about 
their involvement in the Jan. 6 or Mar-a-Lago investigations or that their supervisors would do it for them and that 
their responses would be "forwarded to upper management," says one of the lawsuits. The complaint says it was 
filed on behalf of nine employees, but the class of plaintiffs could grow to include "at least 6,000 current and 
former" FBI workers. The article noted that the lawsuit notes that Trump on the campaign trail "repeatedly stated 
that he would personify 'the vengeance' or 'the retribution; for those whom he called 'political hostages; for their 
actions during the Jan. 6 attack." The agents contend that "the very act of compiling lists of persons who worked on 
matters that upset Donald Trump is retaliatory in nature, intended to intimidate FBI agents and other personnel 
and to discourage them from reporting any future malfeasance and by Donald Trump and his agents." The 
complaint also cites the DOJ's firing last week of prosecutors on special counsel Jack Smith's team, which brought 
two indictments against Trump, as proof that the effort to compile the list is rooted in a desire for 
retribution. "Donald Trump has made repeated public pronouncements of his intent to exact revenge upon persons 
he perceives to be disloyal to him by simply executing their duties in investigating acts incited by him and persons 
loyal to him," the complaint says. "Whatever the Trump administration believes about Plaintiffs' political affiliation, 
it clearly believes that persons who were involved in the investigation and prosecution of Jan. 6 and Mar-a-Lago 
cases are insufficiently politically affiliated with Donald Trump to be entitled to retain their employment" Another 
group of agents argued in a second lawsuit Tuesday that releasing their names publicly would subject them to 
dangerous threats and harassment. The complaint includes a screenshot of a social media post from the former 
Proud Boys national leader Enrique Tarrio calling for the arrest of an agent who testified in his Jan. 6 case after 
his recent pardon from Trump. "It is clear that the threatened disclosure is a prelude to an unlawful purge of the 
FBI solely driven by the Trump Administration's vengeful and political motivations," Chris Mattel, one of the lawyers 
who filed that lawsuit on behalf of the FBI Agents Association, said in a statement. "Releasing the names of these 
agents would ignite a firestorm of harassment towards them and their families and it must be stopped 
immediately." The lawsuit, also filed by the State Democracy Defenders Fund, a nonpartisan organization that says 
it fights "election sabotage and autocracy," seeks a temporary restraining order that would prevent the DOJ from 
releasing the names on the list. Other lawyers participating in the case include prominent Washington attorney 
Mark laid, who routinely represents government officials. Reuters (02/04, Lynch, Goudsward), New York

Acting Director Brian Driscoll Builds a Following as Agency's Defender 
The New York Times (02/04, Goldman) reported that Brian Driscoll, the acting director of the FBI, has become an 
improbable symbol of quiet resistance toward the DOJ's campaign to single out FBI employees who investigated 
the Jan. 6 riot. The article noted that Driscoll's appointment was an accident. Shortly after President Trump's 
inauguration, the White House identified the wrong agent as acting director on its website and never corrected the 
mistake. According to the article, even if he was not meant to be leading the agency, he has defended the rank-and-
file. His refusal at the time to furnish the names of employees, as top DOJ officials desired, and his insistence that a 
formal review process be put in place, has spurred widespread support for Driscoll. Former and current agents
