you know the US version used to say the convertible=into something. ( gold silver ) . now it says trust me. its wo=th 
one dollar.. the trading of dollars is well known. =C2 I wondered whether sentences ( concepts with=ut being 
necessarily written on paper. could be , looked at the same=way. some having intrinsic value and others being used a= 
exchange. I see no reason why not, does that set up an =conomics of sentences /concepts. .

the taste of a new math. 
I rea= your attached paper. I would suggest that the system of analysis su=fers from the use of early twentieth century 
reasoning ,=ie references =o Merge. minimal computation ( the set notation can be misleading =r modules. I think a 
system and notation that might, just might, he=p and add interesting insights is -category theory. fres=er, more useful 
then either the former popular set theory or group t=eory of the 20th century . where for example mc would be 
contain=d in a larger category. ( your Merge would fall into a subcategory o= operations that were a combination of 
associative , transitive oper=tions in a space etc . One then looks at the spaces of probabilitie= and realizes that some 
are just much more probable than others . =AO nothing more. these probabilities generate shapes only as = result of 
their statistical ensembles. - the age old st=dy of soap bubbles suffered from the same handicap.. the shap=s were 
analyzed by attempting to follow the mc rule. ie containing the most volume for=the least area. ( a broader category ) 
now i would propose =AO that the shape merely represents its most probable shape- nothing=more. given the 
statistical space. for ex, things on the=membrane , free to move but the shape not changing. 
I unders=and that 
language is not an input output system like vision.=C2 Shapes are not input /output devices but have very strong 
prop=rties , relationships etc. there are mappings onto those=spaces. the old version of functions expanded ei using

be represented as coheren= shapes. its very beautiful math.
