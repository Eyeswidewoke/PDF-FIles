Bleeping Computer (06/05, Gatlan) and CyberDaily (06/06, Croft) reported that the FBI has recovered over 7,000 
decryption keys from the LockBit ransomware and is urging past victims to come forward to reclaim their data for 
free. According to the articles, FBI Cyber Division Assistant Director Bryan Vorndran announced at the 2024 Boston 
Conference on Cyber Security, "From our ongoing disruption of LockBit, we now have over 7,000 decryption keys 
and can help victims reclaim their data and get back online." He further encouraged victims to visit the FBI's 
Internet Crime Complaint Center at ic3.gov. Vorndran's keynote provided an analysis of Operation Cronos and its 
findings, revealing that "LockBit was set up by a Russian coder named Dmitry Khoroshev," who uses online aliases 
like 'Putinkrab,"Nerowolfe,' and 'LockBitsupp.' Vorndran stated, "He maintains the image of a shadowy hacker... 
But, really, he is a criminal, more caught up in the bureaucracy of managing his company than in any covert 
activities." The articles explained that Khoroshev, who has been sanctioned by the US, UK, and Australia, attempted 
to mitigate his situation by betraying his competitors. "Khoroshev then tried to get us to go easy on him by turning 
on his competitors, naming other ransomware-as-a-service operators," said Vorndran. "So, it really is like dealing 
with organized crime gangs, where the boss rolls over and asks for leniency. We will not go easy on him." The 
articles noted that the FBI discovered that LockBit and its affiliates were keeping stolen data even after receiving 
ransom payments, despite assurances to victims that the data had been deleted. 
Appeals Court Halts Trump's Georgia Case During Appeal of Order 
The Associated Press (06/05, Brumback) and the Washington Post (06/05, Gardner) reported that an appeals court 
has paused the Georgia election interference case against former President Donald Trump while it reviews a ruling 
allowing Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis to remain on the case. According to the articles, Trump and 
eight others had sought to remove Willis, arguing that her relationship with special prosecutor Nathan Wade 
created a conflict of interest. Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee had previously found no conflict of 
interest but allowed the appeal to proceed. The Court of Appeals has scheduled a tentative hearing for October 4, 
with a ruling expected by mid-March, delaying any potential trial until after the November general election. The 
articles noted that this development makes it even more unlikely that the case will go to trial before Trump is 
expected to be the Republican nominee for president. The story was also reported on by ABC News (06/OS, Rubin), 
Axios (06/0S, Doherty), BBC (06/OS, Matza), CBS News (06/05, Quinn, Eggleston), CNBC (06/05, Mangan), CNN 
(06/05, Cohen, Murray, Morris), Fox News (06/05, Herlihy), The Hill (06/05, Lee, Schonfeld), NBC News (06/05, Gile, 
Gregorian), New York Times (06/OS, Fausset), Politico (06/05, Cheney), and Reuters (06/05, Goudsward).

COUNTERTERRORISM 
Washington Man Sentenced for 20 'Swatting' Calls of False Threats in U.S., Canada 
The Associated Press (06/05, Staff Writer) reported that Ashton Connor Garcia, a Washington state man, was 
sentenced to three years in prison for making 20 false reports of bombs and shootings across the U.S. and Canada. 
According to the article, Garcia pleaded guilty to extortion and threats regarding explosives, admitting he intended 
to cause the deployment of SWAT teams and bomb squads. The FBI was involved in responding to these false 
emergencies, which included fake bomb scares for Fox News in Cleveland and a flight from Honolulu to Los 
Angeles. Prosecutors noted that Garcia used voice-over-internet technology to conceal his identity and threatened 
to send emergency responses to victims' homes unless they provided money, credit card information, or explicit 
images. 
Counterterrorism Chief to Step Down After Three Years on the Job 
CBS News (06/05, Gazis) reported that Christy Abizaid will step down next month as the director of the National 
Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) after three years in the role. She will be succeeded by Brett Holmgren, the current 
director of the Bureau of Intelligence and Research, who will serve as the acting director. The article explained that 
the NCTC, housed in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, functions as the government's primary 
counterterrorism analysis hub, coordinating with agencies like the FBI and the Department of Homeland 
Security. In a statement, Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines said of the moves: "Christy Abizaid is an 
extraordinary leader who is not only incredibly effective but principled, courageous, and kind. We will miss her, but 
we are beyond fortunate to have Brett Holmgren taking on the leadership of NCTC — another truly exceptional 
leader in the counterterrorism field and a distinguished member of the IC leadership team." Additional reporting 
on the story was provided by UPI (06/05, Heuer), New York Times (06/05, Schmitt), and Reuters (06/OS, Staff 
Writer).
