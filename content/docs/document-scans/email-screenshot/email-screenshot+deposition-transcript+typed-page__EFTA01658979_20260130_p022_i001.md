Teen Plotted To Assassinate Joe Biden, Federal Authorities Say. 
The Washington Post (10/23, Bella, 14.2M) reports 19-year-old Alexander Hillel Treisman 
appears to have planned and threatened to assassinate Joe Biden, federal authorities say. The 
teen "searched online for Biden's home address and for night-vision goggles, and purchased an 
AR-15 in New Hampshire, according to federal court documents first reported Thursday by 
WBTV." In the spring, "Treisman ended up at a Wendy's within four miles of Biden's home in 
Delaware." After "he was arrested later that month in North Carolina, police searching his van 
found four rifles, a 9mm handgun, explosive materials, books on bomb making, and $509,000 
in cash that's believed to be his inheritance." These "revelations all come in an order that a 
federal magistrate judge filed earlier this month outlining why Treisman, who was indicted by a 
federal grand jury in September on child pornography charges, should remain in custody." It 
remains "unclear whether Treisman will face additional charges related to the alleged plot." 
ABC World News TonightVi (10/23, story 8, 1:09, Muir, 5.75M) reported, "In April, he 
allegedly posted a meme with the caption, 'Should I kill Joe Biden?" Authorities "also 
discovered he had an interest in terror attacks and mass shootings, and had traveled around 
the country purchasing weapons in various states." 
CBS Evening NewsVi (10/23, story 8, 1:59, O'Donnell, 1.93M) reported, "Prosecutors 
have only charged Treisman with child pornography. He has pleaded not guilty. His attorney 
says that he has Asperger's syndrome. Citing all the evidence in this case, a judge ordered that 
he remain behind bars." NBC Nightly NewsVi (10/23, story 7, 1:22, Holt, 1.82M) reported, 
"Police near Charlotte, North Carolina say when they checked out an abandoned van in this 
bank parking lot they found guns and cash inside." 
The AP (10/23) reports from Kannapolis, North Carolina that Treisman "had searched 
earlier this year for Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden's home online, traveled near
