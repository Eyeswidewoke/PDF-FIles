KXAN-TV Austin, TX (7/28, Powell, 495K) reports from Austin, Texas, "Monday evening, faculty, 
graduate and postdoctoral students at the University of Texas at Austin were sent a message 
from university leaders alerting them that the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation will be 
contacting researchers regarding efforts the Chinese government may have taken to illegally 
obtain research from American universities. This is `including coronavirus vaccine research." 
KXAN-TV adds, "UT Austin researchers are working on projects to further expedite the 
development of a COVID-19 vaccine. University leaders said this is part of a 'national situation' 
that may impact some in UT's research community. They explained the FBI told UT last week 
that because of the recently ordered closure of the Chinese Consulate in Houston, the bureau 
will be `contacting UT researchers about the role of the Consulate and efforts by the Chinese 
government to illegally procure research." 
Rubio Doubts IC Global Threats Hearing Will Happen This Year. 
Politico (7/28, Matishak, 4.29M) reports acting Senate Intelligence Chair Marco Rubio (R-FL) 
"raised doubts Tuesday that the panel will hold a public session on global threats facing the US 
this year, citing increased partisanship over the nation's intelligence apparatus." Rubio said, "I'm 
not sure we're going to have one, especially after the letters over the last ten days, seeing this 
sort of heavy politicization of it." He was referring to "a war of words that erupted between 
congressional Democrats and the Trump Administration and Republicans after the nation's top 
counterintelligence official issued a warning about election interference." Rubio added, "It's 
become harder to get to an agreement on a forum that doesn't turn into a political circus. Why 
would a career professional intelligence official, at any level at this point, want to be dragged 
into being turned into a political pretzel to further the narrative of one side or the other?" 
Russian Intelligence Services Spreading Coronavirus Disinformation. 
The New York Times (7/28, Barnes, Sanger, 18.61M) reports "Russian intelligence services have 
been spreading disinformation about the coronavirus pandemic, according to newly declassified 
intelligence, material that demonstrates how Moscow is continuing to try to influence Americans 
as the election draws closer." The Hill (7/28, Wise, 2.98M) reports the campaign reportedly 
includes "the dissemination of news articles with unfounded claims about the virus's origins and 
how Moscow and the US have responded to it, among other things." The AP (7/28, Tucker) 
reports US officials "said Tuesday Russian intelligence services are using a trio of English-
language websites to spread disinformation about the coronavirus pandemic, seeking to exploit 
a crisis that America is struggling to contain ahead of the presidential election in November." US 
government officials "said two Russians who have held senior roles in Moscow's military 
intelligence service known as the GRU have been identified as responsible for a disinformation 
effort meant to reach American and Western audiences."
