SIGNIFICANT NEWS EVENTS 
Continued Reporting: President Trump Won't Recommend Special Counsel in Epstein Investigation 
The Associated Press (07/17, Tucker) reported that the controversy surrounding the handling of records from the Jeffrey Epstein investigation 
has intensified after The Wall Street Journal (07/17, Safdar, Palazzolo) reported on a 2003 letter that allegedly bears frump's name and contains 
sexually suggestive content, which Trump has denied writing, calling it "false, malicious, and defamatory". The letter, which was reportedly 
collected by Ghlslaine Maxwell as part of a birthday album for Epstein, includes text framed by the outline of a hand-drawn naked woman and 
ends with the phrase "Happy Birthday — and may every day be another wonderful secret." President Trump has promised to sue The Wall Street 
Journal over the story claiming that the letter is "fake" and that he does not draw pictures or speak in the manner described in the letter, and Vice 
President JD Vance has also criticized the newspaper, saying it "should be ashamed" for publishing the story without showing the letter to the 
Trump administration beforehand. According to the article, the Trump administration has been struggling to contain the fallout from the DOJ's 
announcement that no more Epstein evidence would be released to the public, despite promises of transparency from AG Bondi. The article 
highlighted that the Dill's reversal on the Epstein flies sparked controversy and a testy exchange between AG Bondi and Deputy Director Bongino 
at the White House, which neither official has publicly addressed. The White House has closed the door on calls fora further inquiry into the 
Epstein investigation, with President 'frump refusing to recommend the appointment of a special counsel, and instead slamming his own 
supporters for their furor over the Epstein files saga, which he called a 'hoax' and tried to blame on Democrats. ABC News (07/17, Hill, 
Charalambous) reported that the DOJ and FBI declined to release a large portion of the Jeffrey Epstein files, citing the presence of child 
pornography and images of victims who appear to be minors. According to the article, the unreleased evidence includes logs of who visited 
Epstein's private island, records of a wiretap of Ghislalne Maxwell's phone, and documents related to Epstein's properties in the U.S. Virgin 
Islands. The files also contain physical evidence such as photographs, travel logs, and employee lists, as well as digital data stored on computers, 
storage drives, and other devices. Reuters (07/17, Lange) reported that 69% of Americans believe the Trump administration is concealing details 
about Jeffrey Epstein's clients, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll. Only 17% of Americans approve of President Donald Trump's handling of the 
Epstein case, with 35% of Republicans approving and 29% disapproving. Trump has responded to criticism by calling his supporters who are 
upset about the issue "weaklings" and stating that he no longer wants their support. The New York Times (07/17, Thrush) reported 
that President Trump authorized AG Bondi to seek the public release of grand Jury testimony from the Jeffrey Epstein case. AG Bondi will make 
the request in federal court, but It's unclear if she will succeed due to the secrecy of grand Jury transcripts. Additional reporting on the story was
