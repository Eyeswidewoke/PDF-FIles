Day

Trump's federal crime crackdown. According to the article, the city has marked its 12th consecutive day without a

deployment of federal agencies for the decrease in crime, saying it has made a significant difference in public safety 
in the capital. The article highlighted that Director Patel said 26 of Sunday's arrests came from FBI operations, 
including five drug seizures. "Keep getting after it," he posted on X. The Washington Post (08/25, George) reported

COUNTERINTELLIGENCE 
How China Influences Elections in America's Biggest City 
The New York Times (08/26, Forsythe, Root, et al.) reported that the Chinese government has used Manhattan-
based community groups—many tied to China's consulate and ruling Communist Party—to influence elections in 
New York City by backing sympathetic candidates and undermining those critical of Beijing. The article described a 
range of tactics, including threats to business interests, covert sabotage, and fundraising efforts by tax-exempt 
nonprofits, some of which violate U.S. election law. In one case, a Chinese Ministry of State Security agent 
attempted to compromise or physically harm a former Tiananmen protest leader who ran for Congress; the private 
investigator he hired was cooperating with the FBI, which later filed criminal charges. The article also noted that 
the FBI arrested leaders of a group operating a clandestine Chinese police station and interviewed Chinatown 
leaders about consular pressure. In another instance, a top FBI agent warned New York lawmakers that consulate 
officers use threats and inducements to influence U.S. politicians, especially those supporting Taiwan. These 
influence campaigns reportedly resulted in political defeats for figures critical of China and diverted city funding to 
consulate-aligned groups. The author assessed that China's efforts reflect a long-term strategy to suppress dissent 
within the diaspora and shape American political outcomes favorable to Beijing.

universities, and are pushing for stronger safeguards and transparency about foreign influence in U.S. higher
