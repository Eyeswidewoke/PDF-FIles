Wealth Management 
No assurance can be given that any forecast or target can be achieved. Forecasts are based on assumptions, estimates. opinions and hypothetical 
models which may prove to be incorrect. Past performance is not indicative of future returns. Investments come with risk. The value of an investment can 
fall as well as rise and you might not get back the amount originally invested at any point in time. Your capital may be at risk.

The search for growth 
Everything, you might say, is relative. But central banks 
still worry about GDP growth all around the world, 
whether their starting point is over 6% (as in China) or 
closer to 1%. Policy responses will remain key.

A U.S. rate hike looks 
possible in December, 
with economic data likely 
to be supportive. 
Eurozone "hard" data 
proves more mixed than 
-soft" data, signaling 
periphery weakness. 
Asian growth is under 
the spotlight with 
questions over China 
and external demand. 
I U.S. Fed speakers have provided divergent views on interest rates in 
recent weeks with some sounding markedly more dovish than others. Against 
this background, the markets have continued to grind higher, suggesting a 
degree of investor complacency. Now attention shifts to Janet Yellen, who may 
use her speech at next week's Jackson Hole symposium to establish a 
framework for preparing the markets about the timing and magnitude of future 
Fed rate hikes. We continue to think that a rate hike is still likely in December, 
largely because we believe that a range of economic data could continue to 
indicate that H1 U.S. economic growth weakness is increasingly behind us. 
Germany has posted some stronger recent economic data, for example 
industrial production and retail sales. The country's export-oriented economy 
appears to have benefited from EUR weakness in recent months. French 
economic performance is however lagging behind on both measures. Italy 
continues to give cause for concern, with industrial production and retail sales 
contracting on a YoY basis. Spain is better in absolute terms but also shows 
some signs of weakness. Across the Eurozone as a whole, domestic/services 
sectors continue to hold up rather better than the industrial sector. Our outlook 
remains for modest Eurozone GDP growth of 1.4% this year. 
Asian economies' growth outlooks are worth keeping under review. 
Japanese O2 growth was disappointing and slow growth in external demand 
could have an impact on a range of export-oriented economies across the 
region. Looming above everything, of course, is China. Recent slowdowns (if 
from high levels) in growth in indicators such as industrial production, fixed-
asset investment and retail sales may not appear encouraging, but Chinese 
exporters are continuing to benefit from a weaker currency. There also may be 
room for further policy stimulus here and in other regional economies.
