Tuesday during a one-on-one interview with The National News Desk's Jan Jeffcoat. The investigation is related to

The Secret Service Failure at Butler, Pa., A Year Later 
An editorial from the Wall Street Journal (07/15, Editorial) reported that a year after a gunman took 8 shots at 
Donald Trump at a campaign rally in Butler, Pa., it's unclear if enough has changed to prevent similar 
incidents. According to the article, the Senate report by Chairman Rand Paul calls the near miss a "cascade of 
preventable failures" due to inadequate preparation and breakdowns in communications among Secret Service 
agents and local law enforcement. The article noted that despite the severity of the situation, which killed an 
attendee and injured two others, not a single person has been fired, although several agents were put on 
temporary leave. The article highlighted that the Secret Service has struggled with a mission divided between 
protecting the President and other potential targets and the odd-duck pairing of financial investigations. Agents 
rotate between protective details and desk jobs, an arrangement that has left the Service with an annual attrition 
rate from 8% to more than 10% in recent years. The article noted that that's several times the rate at the FBI or CIA.

racketeering-related charges for crimes including shootings and a $2.9 million identity theft scheme. According to

profile shootout that injured eight people outside the Truth Lounge nightclub, and were involved in a long-running 
feud with a rival enterprise known as the Robles Park gang, whose members Keaujay "Plug" Hornsby and Kareem 
"Reem" Spann were already prosecuted and sentenced to 16 and 10 years in prison, respectively. The article noted 
that the investigation was conducted by Tampa police and the FBI, and Tampa police Chief Lee Bercaw said that the 
indictments make the streets of Tampa safer, as the "Glock Boys" had "wreaked havoc" on the 
community. Additional reporting on the story was provided by WFTS (ABC-28) (07/15, Gutierrez), WTVT (Fox-13) 
(07/15, Swanson), and WFLA (NBC-8) (07/15, Rodriguez).

61, faces 31 counts stemming from a scheme to defraud the unemployment compensation program during the

investigators.
