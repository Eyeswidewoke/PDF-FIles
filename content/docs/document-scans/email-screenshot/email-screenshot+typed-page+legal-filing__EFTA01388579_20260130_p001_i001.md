The limits of monetary policy 
.64 riTttl Ed,t,,r,j ?hoe, 2:ilf; 
protection strategy. You might also want to taken broader look at the assets you 
really have in your investment portfolio and in particular take your human capital 
in to account, when thinking about risks and rewards. Already, we are seeing clear 
signs that the advantages from taking a world-wide perspective when making 
investment decisions are once again growing. For example, a few individual 
emerging markets have performed quite well in recent months, after years of 
disappointing returns. Benefitting from such reversals requires a strong grasp of the 
trends shaping the global economy. To well-diversified investors, the increasingly 
volatile currency movements we are expecting are presenting opportunities, not 
just risks and it may be appropriate to integrate these into the portfolio decision-
making process. At a time when yields on traditional asset classes can be so low, 
currency investments may in some cases help generate added returns, as they 
will be directly affected by central banks' policy. Handling such sophisticated 
diversification however requires consideration of the fourth point below. 
Third: diversify but flexibly. 
Traditionally, the main idea of a multi asset approach has been to reduce portfolio 
risk through diversification. But if monetary policy is determining the overall 
risk sentiment of investors, affecting all conventional asset classes, traditional 
diversification effects (e.g. through combining equity and fixed income in a 
portfolio) are unlikely to contribute much to a portfolio's performance. But this is 
not to suggest that diversification no longer has a part to play: instead we would 
argue that it can still be extremely important, but to make it so, investors will need 
to broaden their investment horizon both regionally, within asset classes and with 
regard to other investments, e.g. alternatives/illiquids. 
Fourth: knowledge is king. 
Paradoxically, in such an uncertain world, specific knowledge becomes particularly 
important. We would distinguish two types of knowledge here. First, you need deep 
local knowledge of what is happening in different regions of the world, to identify 
structural trends early on, and select assets accordingly. As wealth managers, we 
fully intend to help our clients make the best of what has no doubt become a more 
difficult investment environment. Second, you need a data-driven understanding of 
what is going on at an overall investment level, so you can separate out the reality 
of what is going on from general perception. Only with this knowledge can you, for 
example, look deeper into concepts such as valuation, equity selection and risk. The 
environment will change and you need to be able to judge the likely implications for 
your own personal situation.

expected returns will be achieved. Allocations are subject to change without notice. Forecasts are based on assumptions, estimates,
