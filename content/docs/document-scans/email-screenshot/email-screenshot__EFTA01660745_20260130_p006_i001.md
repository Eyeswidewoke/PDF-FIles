in NYC or across the country. According to the article, a recent FBI terrorism bulletin emphasized the

U.S. Military Heightens Security Alert Level at European Bases in Response to 
Threats 
CBS News (07/02, Staff Writer) reported that the U.S. military has raised its security alert level to Charlie 
at bases throughout Europe due to various threats, including the ongoing wars in Ukraine and Gaza, 
upcoming major events like the Olympics, and recent elections in France and the U.K. According to the 
article, this heightened security follows a worldwide alert issued by the FBI and Homeland Security in 
May, warning of potential terrorist attacks by ISIS at Pride events in Europe. The article noted that raising 
the threat level to Charlie means additional security measures will be in place at U.S. military 
installations, but it's up to each commander's discretion to determine what those measures are. It also 
means service members and their families who are living in each community should be more aware of 
their surroundings and maintain a lower profile. Clearance Jobs (07/02, Suciu) also reported on the story.

local law enforcement agencies conducted a raid on the suspect's home, with charges against the teen 
still pending. 
Continued Reporting: 9/11 Families Say Biden, Trump Need to Address Saudi 
Video 
The New York Post (07/02, Morphet, Crane) reported that families of 9/11 victims criticized President 
Biden and former President Trump for their silence regarding new footage showing a suspected Saudi spy 
filming U.S. landmarks before the attacks. According to the article, Brett Eagleson, president of 9/11 
Justice, expressed the victims' frustration, saying, "It's 23 years later, and our government has failed to 
bring us accountability, closure and justice." The article noted that retired FBI Agent Richard Lambert, 
who is involved in the families' lawsuit against Saudi Arabia, suggested the footage could have informed al 
Qaeda's targeting decisions, highlighting the ongoing demand for justice and accountability from U.S. 
leaders. News Nation Now (07/02, Ingle) also reported on the story. 
Opinion: Alarmism About Terrorism Is Risky and Unjustified 
An opinion piece from Discourse (07/02, Nowrasteh, Ard) reported that authors Graham Allison and 
Michael J. Morell argued in Foreign Affairs about the imminent threat of terrorist attacks in the U.S., 
suggesting that complacency is riskier than alarmism. They emphasized the serious potential of an attack 
and urged action, particularly given the porous nature of the southern U.S. border. The article critiqued 
the Foreign Affair's piece as overly alarmist, citing statistics to demonstrate the rarity of foreign-born 
terrorist attacks on U.S. soil and the small impact of those that do occur. The article mentioned that 
Director Wray has expressed concerns about the possibility of terrorists entering the U.S. through the 
southern border and is investigating various plots. The article assessed that the evidence he provided 
doesn't strongly support claims of an immediate threat. The author assessed that alarmism about 
terrorism is risky and unjustified, and advocated for a balanced approach that avoids unnecessary panic.
