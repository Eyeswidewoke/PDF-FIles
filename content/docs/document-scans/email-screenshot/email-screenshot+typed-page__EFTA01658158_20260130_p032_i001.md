Reuters (7/24, Chee) reported the European Commission "said on Friday EU countries must 
take urgent action to diversify their 5G suppliers, a move set to shrink Huawei's presence in 
Europe as the US pressured the bloc to follow Britain and ban the Chinese company from 5G 
networks." The EU executive said, reporting on the progress made by the 27 EU countries, 
"Progress is urgently needed to mitigate the risk of dependency on high-risk suppliers, also with 
a view to reducing dependencies at (European) Union level. Challenges have been identified in 
designing and imposing appropriate multi-vendor strategies for individual MNOs (mobile 
network operator) or at national level due to technical or operational difficulties." 
France Says It's Not Banning Huawei Though Phase Out Started. 
Bloomberg (7/24, 4.73M) reported France is seeking "to assure China that it isn't banning 
Chinese telecom equipment supplier Huawei from participating in its fifth-generation mobile 
roll-out, even after announcing new security regulations that may effectively do just that." The 
head of the country's cybersecurity agency "said this month it will grant time-limited waivers on 
5G for wireless operators that use Huawei products, a decision that will likely begin a 'phasing 
out' of the company's products." The fact that Americans "are publicly praising France for its 
latest action has observers thinking that a change in policy is afoot." A spokesman for the 
finance ministry said "any talk of a ban is rumor and speculation." 
Op-Ed: Cyberattack Attribution And International Law Is Not Well Understood. 
In a commentary in Just Security (7/24, Eichensehr), Kristen Eichensehr wrote, "Last week the 
Department of Justice unsealed an indictment accusing two men linked to China's Ministry of 
State Security of a decade-long campaign of hacking dissidents, human rights activists, and a 
variety of private sector targets, including most recently entities working on COVID-19 
treatments, tests, and vaccines. ... But the relationship of these and other cyberattack 
attributions to international law is not well understood" He contended, "In a new article, I argue 
that states should establish a customary international law requirement that governments that 
make public attributions of cyberattacks to other states must provide enough evidence to 
enable crosschecking or corroboration of their attributions." He concluded, "But for now, the 
interplay between cyberattack attributions and the still unsettled rules for state behavior in 
cyberspace make establishing an evidentiary standard in the cyberattack context an important 
first step." 
CISA, NSA Release Security Advisory On Operational Technology. 
ExecutiveGov (7/24, Martin) reported the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency 
(CISA) "partnered with NSA to jointly issue a guidance document on the protection of critical 
infrastructure and control systems associated with operational technology." CISA said Thursday 
that the joint advisory "includes information on observed tactics and techniques employed by 
cyber actors and potential impacts on operational technology systems." Anne Neuberger, 
director of NSA's Cybersecurity Directorate, said, "Operational technology assets are pervasive 
and underpin many essential national security functions, as well as the Defense Industrial 
Base." The government released the advisory "to help operational technology users evaluate 
their cybersecurity against threats." 
Gov Info Security (7/25, Asokan) reported the alert also "warns of a `perfect storm' of 
vulnerabilities that hackers are looking to exploit." This includes "remote access to critical 
operational technology systems by a decentralized workforce." The agencies also "note that 
older OT systems are not designed to defend against modern attacks." Neuberger said, 
"Operational technology assets are pervasive and underpin many essential national security 
functions, as well as the defense industrial base."
