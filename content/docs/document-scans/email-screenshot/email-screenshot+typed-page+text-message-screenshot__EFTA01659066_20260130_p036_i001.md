"has pledged to immediately rejoin the Paris Climate Accord, the World Health Organization and 
other U.N. bodies." In addition, Biden "plans to return to the Iran nuclear deal, if Tehran also 
returns to compliance." The Post goes on to report that Biden "has said that on Day 1, he will 
remove the `gag order' prohibiting any health organization that performs or provides advice on 
abortions from receiving U.S. foreign aid," will "lift Trump's `Muslim ban," and will "reverse his 
`cruel and senseless' immigration policies." 
Reuters (10/21, Spicer) reports that Turkey "stands to lose more than most other 
countries if Joe Biden is elected president since he is expected to toughen the U.S. stance 
against President Tayyip Erdogan's foreign military interventions and closer cooperation with 
Russia." Reuters adds, "Investors and analysts say the beleaguered Turkish lira is especially 
vulnerable if a Biden White House pulls the trigger on long-threatened sanctions over Ankara's 
purchase of Russian S-400 missiles, which Washington says compromise NATO defences." 
Pope Francis Voices Support For Same-Sex Civil Unions. 
ABC World News TonightVi (10/21, story 6, 2:00, Muir, 6.08M) reported Pope Francis has 
become "the first Pope in history" to voice support for same-sex couples. ABC's James Longman 
added, "In an historic shift from the leader of an ancient institution," the Pope says in a new 
documentary, "Homosexual people have a right to be in a family. They are children of God and 
have a right to a family. ... What we have to create is a civil union law. That way they are 
legally covered. I stood up for that." The CBS Evening NewsVI (10/21, story 8, 1:30, O'Donnell, 
4.55M) called the development "stunning news and a major departure from his predecessors," 
and NBC Nightly NewsVI (10/21, story 7, 1:25, 5.81M) said Francis "cement[ed] his reputation 
as the Pope of surprises." 
The Washington Post (10/21, Harlan, Boorstein, Bailey, 14.2M) reports while the comment 
"does nothing to alter Catholic doctrine," it "represents a remarkable shift for a church that has 
fought against LGBT legal rights — with past popes calling same-sex unions inadmissible and 
deviant." The New York Times (10/21, Al, 18.61M) says Francis' remarks "had the potential to 
shift debates about the legal status of same-sex couples in nations around the globe and 
unsettle bishops worried that the unions threaten what the church considers traditional 
marriage - between one man and one woman." 
The AP (10/21, Winfield) reports the comments "spark[ed] cheers from gay Catholics and 
demands for clarification from conservatives, given the Vatican's official teaching on the issue." 
USA Today (10/21, Bote, 10.31M) reports, "For LGBTQ advocates, Pope Francis' message was 
not just an endorsement of same-sex civil unions - a stance that he has, indeed, tacitly taken 
before. It's also approval of same-sex parents having the privilege of raising families." The Wall 
Street Journal (10/21, Rocca, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) and the Washington Times 
(10/21, Vondracek, 492K) provide similar coverage.
