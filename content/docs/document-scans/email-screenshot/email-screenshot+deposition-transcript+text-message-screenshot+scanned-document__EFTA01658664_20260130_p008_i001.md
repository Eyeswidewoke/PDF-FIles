dubbed the FinCEN Files "reveals for the first time how the giants of Western banking move 
trillions of dollars in suspicious transactions, enriching themselves and their shareholders while 
facilitating the work of terrorists, kleptocrats, and drug kingpins." The documents "offer an 
unprecedented view of global financial corruption, the banks enabling it, and the government 
agencies that watch as it flourishes." The documents "expose the hollowness of banking 
safeguards, and the ease with which criminals have exploited them." 
Reuters (9/20) reports the documents indicate that top global banks including HSBC 
Holdings Plc, WMorgan Chase & Co, Deutsche Bank AG, Standard Chartered Plc, and Bank of 
New York Mellon Corp "moved large sums of allegedly illicit funds over a period of nearly two 
decades, despite red flags about the origins of the money." The documents include "leaked 
suspicious activity reports (SARs) filed by banks and other financial firms with the U.S. 
Department of Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCen)." These SARs "were 
obtained by BuzzFeed News and shared with the International Consortium of Investigative 
Journalists (ICIJ) and other media organizations." 
Bloomberg (9/20, Yang, Surane, Onaran, 4.73M) reports despite "a wave of hefty fines 
against major banks in the past decade" sparking "an explosion in the number of transactions 
that lenders flag as suspect to the U.S. government," it remains unclear whether this is "making 
a difference. Banks moved money for people or entities they couldn't identify, and in many 
cases failed to file the required suspicious activity reports until years afterward, according to an 
investigation released over the weekend by the International Consortium of Investigative 
Journalists." Moreover, in some cases banks "kept moving illicit funds after receiving warnings 
from U.S. officials." The documents "shed light on a faulty system where banks complain about 
reports that get no follow-up from authorities, while critics say lenders are checking off boxes 
without taking meaningful steps to stop financial crime." 
Business Insider (9/20, Dzhanova, 3.67M) reports the documents show "how some of the 
world's biggest banks have for years facilitated the movement of dirty money." This article lists 
a number of examples of questionable transactions documented in the files. 
The Miami Herald (9/20, 19K) also reports. 
CNN's Lemon: President Trump Ignores Domestic Threat Of White Supremacists. 
In a video on the website of CNN (9/18, 83.16M), CNN's Don Lemon says FBI Director 
Christopher Wray told Congress "that white supremacists are the largest group of racially 
motivated domestic terrorists. He says it accounts for the bulk of the bureau's work on 
domestic threats." Wray is shown saying, "Within the domsetic terrorism bucket, the category 
as a whole, racially motivated violent extremism is I think the biggest bucket within that larger 
group, and within the racially motivated violent extremist bucket, people subscribing to some 
kind of white supremacist type ideology is certainly the biggest chunk of that." Lemon 
complains that "people don't want to hear" that white supremacists are responsible for 
terrorism threats, and laments that "the president doesn't recognize the threat." 
Analysis: ISIS Has Sufficient Money To Launch Comeback. 
The Wall Street Journal (9/18, Al, Talley, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) reports an analysis 
of data from security officials and government documents indicates that Islamic State has 
ample cash reserves and continuing revenue streams despite recent setbacks, and the group 
has therefore sufficient resources to mount a resurgence. 
Oregon Arsons Feed Conspiracy Theories About Wildfires. 
The Oregonian (9/19, 1M) reports there have been at least six men charged with arson in 
Oregon as the state deals with devastating wildfires, but none "have ties to left- or right-wing 
groups or appear to have been motivated by politics, according to police and court records." 
Nevertheless, "the alleged acts have stoked fears amid a natural catastrophe unrivaled in 
Oregon's recent past and fueled speculation into the causes behind some of the state's largest
