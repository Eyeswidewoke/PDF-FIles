involved in manufacturing and can fine-tune their des=gns accordingly. Apple has said that it is investing $100 million in 
new U.S. plants — a move hailed as bringing manufacturing back to our shores. However, Ap=le has always done most 
of its prototype manufacturing in the United States. The company may mass-pr=duce iPhones in China, but it has 
maintained U.S. factories as laboratories to perfect its product= before launch. Now, rising wages in China and 
transportation costs have encouraged Apple to manufacture some of its Mac lines here. It is nai=e to think we can keep 
design in America without retaining some manufacturing capacity. 
Over the past decade, the growth of Chinese manufacturing has exceeded America's, so for the first time, China has 
taken the le=d in global manufacturing. Yet, for all the hype about the BRIC economies — Brazil, Russia, India and China 
&mdas=; the United States remains neck-and-neck with China in manufacturing output, and we sti=l far outstrip such 
traditional powerhouses as Japan and Germany. China=and the United States each produce about one-fifth of the 
world's manufacturing, yet we do so with only about =0 percent of our economy devoted to that sector, compared with 
nearly 40 percent of t=e Chinese economy. U.S. manufacturing workers are almost six times as productive as Chinese 
workers and 11 / 2 ti=es as productive as those in Japan and Germany. 
If you think of manufacturing as a tedious job with no intellectual stimulation, you haven't visited a U.S. factory floor 
la=ely. Whether making steel bars or suits for firefighters, many of to=ay's manufacturing jobs require the ability to 
operate complex machines, math sk=lls and an understanding of how to maximize efficiency. No doubt, every j=b has 
repetitive aspects. One of the advantages is that the best manufacturing workers are not just doing repetitive tasks; 
they are thinkin= about how to improve a product's design or production. 
America has long had a bipartisan consensus favoring government support for private manufacturers. In 1791, 
Alexander Hamilton argued that the nation should provide incentives a=d assistance to manufacturers to compete in the 
world economy. Even Thomas Jefferson came around to the view that government has a stake in building domestic 
manufacturing. These principles influenced Herbert Hoover, who before he was president was regarded as a gr=at 
commerce secretary and provided financial support for the aviation industry. Later, President Ronald Reagan supported 
Sematech to help our semiconductor industry. 
Of course, America's free-enterprise system is what enables our manufacturers to be the most innovative. No one is 
suggesting that the government pick winners or losers. Some bets on new companies, such as Solyndra, are bound to 
fail. But such failures should not deter the government from investing in DARPA, a strateg=c agency at the Defense 
Department, or ARPA-E, a strategic agency at the Ener=y Department, which can propel innovation, new technologies 
and new industrie=. As such we must do everything that we can to keep manufacturers at home through tax incentives, 
attract immigrants and better prepare a skilled workforce. And we must continue the collabor=tion between 
government and business that helped make America an economic superpower. 
In an article t=is week in Money Morning — Myths and Realities About the U.S. Economy, Ben Gersten uses graphs to 
po=nt out myths and misleading statistics about the US economy. Are taxes the highest=they've ever been? Is the 
country's spending at record levels? Are =he majority of products U.S. consumers buy produced by low-wage workers 
overseas? Th= answer often depends on the spin. Using Bureau of Economic Analy=is's graphs, Gersten points out 
seven myths and misperceptions about the U.S. economy to give a sense of what's real and what is the twisted truth 
7 Myths About the U.S. Economy 
1. Are Federal Taxes at a Record High? 
Even though Americans paid a record $2.7 trillion in fed=ral taxes in 2012, as a percentage of the economy, that 
amounted to 16%, below the long-=erm average. And both the Total Federal Taxes as a Share of the GDP=/i> and 
Personal Income Taxes as a Share of Personal Income<=i>, are both less than they were in 1971, and approximately 20%
