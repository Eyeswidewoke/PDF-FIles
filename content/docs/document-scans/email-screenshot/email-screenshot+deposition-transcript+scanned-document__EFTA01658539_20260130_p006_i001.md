The Detroit Free Press (10/19, Nerbovig, 1.52M) reports, "Encrypted apps may keep the FBI 
from ever knowing if there is more documentation of the plot to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen 
Whitmer." The Free Press adds, "On the second day of a preliminary examination in which 
sufficient evidence was found to bind five of the six accused men over for proceedings before a 
grand jury, FBI Special Agent Richard Trask on Friday mentioned the FBI was hindered in its 
investigation into the group because some data was stored on an overseas server. The 
communication the FBI was able to enter in as evidence came from a confidential informant." 
According to the Free Press, "Technology overall played a crucial role in the planning and 
formulation of the alleged plot, including the use of Facebook to connect the men, according to 
an affidavit filed by Brian Russell, a detective sergeant with the Michigan State Police." 
Administration Imposes Sanctions On Businessman Moving Al Qaeda Money 
Internationally. 
The New York Times (10/19, Verma, 18.61M) reports, "The Trump administration on Monday 
imposed sanctions on an Australian-based businessman and his gemstone company for helping 
Al Qaeda move money," according to the Treasury Department. Officials "said Ahmed Luqman 
Talib traded in precious stones, allowing him to 'move funds internationally' for Al Qaeda." Talib 
"works around the world, including in Brazil, Colombia, Sri Lanka, Tanzania, Turkey and the 
Persian Gulf region, the Treasury Department said in a statement." The Middle East Institute's 
Countering Terrorism and Extremism Program director, Charles Lister, said, "It goes to show 
that Al Qaeda still retains these kind of networks," adding they are now "kind of a miniature 
version of 10 or 15 years ago." The Washington Institute's director of counterterrorism and 
intelligence, Matthew Levitt, commented, "Governments and private sector have made it harder 
to move funds via formal and informal financial systems. ... It is interesting to see terrorists 
relying on gemstones, which are easy to move and hold value." 
Trump Says US Will Remove Sudan From Terrorism List If It Compensates Victims. 
President Trump on Monday tweeted, "GREAT news! New government of Sudan, which is 
making great progress, agreed to pay $335 MILLION to U.S. terror victims and families. Once 
deposited, I will lift Sudan from the State Sponsors of Terrorism list. At long last, JUSTICE for 
the American people and BIG step for Sudan!" The Wall Street Journal (10/19, Restuccia, 
McBride, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) reports Sudanese Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok 
thanked Trump after the tweet. 
The New York Times (10/19, lakes, Walsh, Schmitt, 18.61M) reports the State 
Department move "clear(s) the way for the East African nation's fragile government to seek 
international assistance and, potentially, normalized relations with Israel - a diplomatic goal for 
President Trump before the election next month." The Washington Post (10/19, Hudson, Bearak, 
14.2M) reports US officials "expect" the "pre-election gambit...will lead to the country's 
recognition of Israel and payment of millions of dollars to the families of terrorism victims." 
According to Reuters (10/19, Spetalnick, Eltahir, Abdelaziz), "Sudan's designation as a 
state sponsor of terrorism dates to its toppled ruler Omar al-Bashir and makes it difficult for its 
transitional government to access urgently needed debt relief and foreign financing." Reuters 
adds, "Many in Sudan say the designation, imposed in 1993 because Washington believed 
Bashir was supporting militant groups, has become outdated since he was removed last year 
and Sudan has long cooperated on counterterrorism." Meanwhile, the AP (10/19, Magdy) 
reports the announcement came after Treasury Secretary Mnuchin "traveled to Bahrain to 
cement the Gulf state's recognition of the Jewish state." 
Axios (10/19, Ravid, 521K) reports Sudan "is also expecting the U.S. to announce an aid 
package in coming days. It will include financial aid and wheat, medicine and oil shipments. 
Also in the mix are commitments by the Trump administration to mobilize private sector 
investments in Sudan and to organize a Sudan donors conference, according to Israeli and 
Sudanese sources."
