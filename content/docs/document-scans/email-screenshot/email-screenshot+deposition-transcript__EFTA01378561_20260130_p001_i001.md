Hi Chris — can you help with the below? 
Long story short — I reached out to a client who is a holder of MBLY. The company has a voluntary tender out there and 
the client asked what happens if they don't tender their shares? 
Will they potentially be hit by the withholding tax regardless? 
Best, 
Vahe
