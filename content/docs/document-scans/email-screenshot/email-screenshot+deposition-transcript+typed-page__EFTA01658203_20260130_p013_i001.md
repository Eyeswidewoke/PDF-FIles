CBS News (7/21, Gazis, 3.68M) reports that DNI Ratcliffe "has proposed appearing before the 
Senate Intelligence Committee for a partially open hearing on worldwide threats in early 
August. But he suggested that the majority of the hearing, including a traditional question and 
answer session, take place behind closed doors." 
Fox News (7/21, Singman, 27.59M) reports that Ratcliffe said in a letter to the SSCI 
leadership that "after 'consultation with other Intelligence Community element heads and with 
consideration for the collective concern about the exchange of information that is inherently 
classified,' he would appear before the committee in both an open and closed setting - with 
intelligence community heads like CIA Director Gina Haspel, FBI Director Christopher Wray, NSA 
Director Paul Nakasone and NGA Director Robert Sharp." Ratcliffe added that "a closed session 
with a thorough exchange of classified questions and answers between the panel and 
Committee members could be conducted to ensure members receive the threat information 
they need." 
The Wall Street Journal (7/21, Strobel, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) reports that a 
spokesman for SSCI Acting Chair Marco Rubio said he and Vice Chair Mark Warner had 
discussed the issue on Tuesday. The spokesman said, "They will continue to work with DNI 
Ratcliffe and are hopeful that the committee will hold a hearing on this important topic soon." 
CNN (7/21, Cohen, Leblanc, 83.16M) reports that the House and Senate intelligence 
committees "have been pushing for the top US intelligence officials to appear for a public 
hearing on the annual World Wide Threats Assessment for months but have been unable to 
reach an agreement with the Office of the Director of National Intelligence on scheduling, in 
part, because of the recent turnover at the director position." 
Meanwhile, the Washington Examiner (7/21, Dunleavy, 448K) reports that the terms laid 
out by Ratcliffe "will likely rankle Democrats not only because of the format but also since the 
House Intelligence Committee, led by Rep. Adam Schiff, has yet to receive such an opportunity." 
NSA Chief Says US Will Hit Back At Foreign Meddlers In 2020 Election. 
The New York Post (7/21, Jacobs, 4.57M) reports one of the top US spy chiefs "has vowed that 
the US would retaliate when foreign nations attempted to interfere in the 2020 presidential 
election, amid rising concerns about Russian hacking." Gen. Paul Nakasone, NSA director and 
US Cyber Command head, pledged, "We're going to act when we see adversaries attempting to 
interfere in our elections." The remarks come "amid accusations from the US, UK and Canada of 
Russian-backed hackers trying to steal coronavirus vaccine research from pharmaceutical 
companies and academic institutions." Nakasone "said that the 2018 US midterm elections had 
left the NSA's capabilities 'battle-tested' to protect against foreign interference in the 2020 
presidential election." He added, "We are going to know our adversaries better than they know 
themselves." 
Report: UK Government Did Not Take Russia's Election Interference Seriously. 
The Washington Post (7/21, Booth, Adam, 14.2M) reports the British Parliament's Intelligence 
and Security Committee released a report finding that the UK government "failed to conduct 
serious assessments of Russian attempts to interfere with British elections, including the 2016 
Brexit referendum." The report also found that the UK "welcomed the [Russian) oligarchs and 
their money with open arms, providing them with a means of recycling illicit finance through 
the London laundromar, and connections at the highest levels with access to UK companies 
and political figures." The report said, "This situation is in stark contrast to the US handling of 
allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, where an intelligence 
community assessment was produced within two months of the vote, with an unclassified 
summary being made public." The Post adds that the "report did not provide any striking 
evidence of Russian interference," but rather "found that the British government did not really 
seem to take the issue seriously."
