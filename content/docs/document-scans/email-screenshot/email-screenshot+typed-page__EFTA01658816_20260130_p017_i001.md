Reuters (11/19, Bartz, Dave) reports the FTC "and a bipartisan group of dozens of state 
attorneys general are in the final stages of filing one or more major antitrust complaints against 
Facebook." FTC staff "has recommended to commissioners that they sue the social media 
company in federal court, which would allow the group of states, led by New York, to join the 
lawsuit, according to one source. As many as 41 states may sign on to the lawsuit, three 
sources said." Reuters says the action "is expected to focus on Facebook's alleged violations of 
antitrust law to build and protect its gigantic market share in social media." 
The Washington Post (11/19, Romm, 14.2M) says state and federal investigators are

Instagram and WhatsApp, alleging that the deals helped create an anti-competitive social 
networking juggernaut that has left users with few quality alternatives." The Post adds that 
"government antitrust watchdogs have weighed whether to contend in lawsuits that these 
transactions have left users with worse services — and fewer privacy protections - than they 
might have had if the companies had remained independent."
