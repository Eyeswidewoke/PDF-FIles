Thanksgiving, that say very brief period of time, of travel and congregating. When you are 
talking about Christmas, you go through Christmas and Hanukkah, you go through the week 
between Christmas and New Year's, and then you have another celebration, on New Year. That 
extends that vulnerable period by two or three times what you do in Thanksgiving. That's the 
reason why the Christmas issue bothers me even more than Thanksgiving." 
Bloomberg (12/7, Court, 4.73M) also reports Fauci "said he won't celebrate the holiday 
with his daughters for the first time in more than 30 years." Bloomberg adds Christmas Eve also 
marks "Fauci's 80th birthday, for which he and his wife plan a Zoom celebration with their 
children." 
Azar Says Administration Ready To Distribute Vaccines. 
On NBC Nightly NewsVi (12/7, story 2, 3:25, 6.27M), Lester Holt reported the Administration 
"says it is ready to set the wheels in motion for the biggest mass vaccination program in the 
nation's history as soon as this week," and HHS Secretary Mar in an interview "played down 
concerns of potential vaccine shortages and described the first hours after the FDA approval of 
a vaccine." Asked about the distribution process, Azar stated, "Each week, we'll be able to 
vaccinate more and more people. Be thinking of our most vulnerable citizens, like our seniors in 
nursing homes or frontline healthcare workers, and as we move forward, well just see tens and 
tens of millions of more people getting vaccinated. Eventually, general vaccination programs 
that, by the second quarter of next year we believe we'll have enough vaccine across all of the 
manufacturers for every American who would like to be vaccinated." 
In an interview with Axios on HBOVi (12/7), Azar said, "By January 20, we will have 
actually vaccinated many tens of millions of American individuals by that point, okay? That 
process will be running, and the individuals taking over at that point I hope will continue that 
process because I believe it'll be a success." Azar added, "Vaccine hesitancy will decrease, 
vaccine confidence will increase as time goes by." 
Gottlieb Criticizes US Vaccine Distribution Plans. USA Today (12/7, Rodriguez, 
10.31M) reports the Administration "hopes to have close to 40 million doses of COVID-19 
vaccine" by the end of the year and "plans to distribute half of those in December and hold 
back the other half to give the same people their second dose of the two-shot regimen," but 
former FDA commissioner and Pfizer board member Scott Gottlieb "says that's a bad idea. 
Instead, Gottlieb says he would give out 35 million doses now, and presume the second doses 
will be available when people need them." In an interview, Gottlieb said, "We should get as 
many shots in our arms as possible right away." He added, "The idea that we need to cut [the 
doses] in half and give half of it now and hold onto it, so we have supply in January to get the 
second dose ... I just fundamentally disagree with that." 
Hospitals Working To Determine Which Healthcare Workers Will Receive COVID 
Vaccine First. The Wall Street Journal (12/7, Al, Evans, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) 
reports hospitals are rushing to finalize plans to determine which healthcare workers will 
receive the COVID vaccine first, as initial supplies are widely expected to fall below what is 
needed to ensure all high-priority workers are vaccinated. 
Giroir, Collins Defend FDA Vaccine Approval Process. 
Assistant NHS Secretary for Health Brett Giroir said on Fox News' America's Newsroom (12/7, 
896K), "We're not skipping any steps in safety and effectiveness." Giroir continued, "All the data 
we've seen thus far of Pfizer and of Modema have been very extraordinarily positive. But, this is 
an open, transparent process. The FDA will take its signal from the advisory committee and 
hopefully we'll see an authorization very soon after." Asked about skeptics of the vaccine, Giroir 
said, "Corners we've cut are only to take financial risks. Instead of doing things sequentially, 
the government has invested billions of dollars into manufacturing and into other steps. So 
instead of doing is sequentially, we did them in parallel. Remember, these vaccines have each
