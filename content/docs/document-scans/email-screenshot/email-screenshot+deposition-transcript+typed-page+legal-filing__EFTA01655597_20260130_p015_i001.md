whether they went through with the marriage. The article noted that Youngblut has been charged in connection 
with the Jan. 20 shooting death of Border Patrol agent David "Chris" Maland in Vermont near the Canadian border, 
according to court records. Youngblut has been charged with one count of using a deadly weapon while assaulting 
a U.S. Border Patrol agent and one count of using and discharging a firearm during that assault but has not been 
charged with actually killing Maland. Vincent Illuzzi, the Essex County State's Attorney, along with the FBI, is slowly 
piecing together a complicated and confusing situation. He suspects that Youngblut and Bauckholt opened fire on 
the Border Patrol over fears investigators had finally pieced together their connection to multiple other deaths. The 
article highlighted that FBI agent Leah Bogdanowicz, who signed Youngblut's arrest affidavit, hinted at a broader 
investigation: "Because this affidavit is being submitted for the limited purpose of establishing probable cause, it 
does not include all the facts that I have learned during the course of the investigation." The FBI declined to discuss 
the substance of the cases but acknowledged potential connections. The article quoted Sarah Ruane, a 
spokeswoman for the FBI's Albany, New York, who office said in a statement, "As stated in open court and in court 
filings, Teresa Youngblut is believed to have associations with other individuals suspected of violent acts in multiple 
states, to include Pennsylvania and California. The FBI is coordinating information sharing on any case related 
details with our partners from various law enforcement agencies to effectively follow every lead and aggressively 
investigate these connections." The article added that Youngblut remains in custody because a federal judge agreed 
with prosecutors about the potential for flight risk, in part, because of Youngblut's purported connections with 
other deaths, which prosecutors did not specify. NewsNation (02/04, Becker, Arnold), VICE (02/04, Prada), and 
California City News (02/04, Staff Writer) also reported on the story.

The Epoch Times (02/04, Smith) reported that former U.S. Rep. Terrance John "TJ" Cox (D-Calif.) pled guilty on 
Monday to wire fraud and wire fraud affecting a financial institution, federal prosecutors announced. The article 
stated that Cox, 61, who represented California's 21st Congressional District from 2019 to 2021, admitted to

Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of California, Cox executed multiple schemes between 2013 and 2018, 
diverting client payments and company funds into unauthorized bank accounts under his control. The article 
explained that his actions resulted in the misappropriation of funds from companies with which he was affiliated, 
prosecutors said. The article highlighted that the FBI and the IRS Criminal Investigation division conducted the 
probe of Cox's financial dealings, which uncovered a pattern of financial misconduct that spanned years and 
involved multiple fraudulent transactions, prosecutors said. The article mentioned that Cox was originally indicted 
in 2022 on multiple counts, including 10 counts of wire fraud, 11 counts of money laundering, five counts of wire 
fraud affecting a financial institution, financial institution fraud, and illegal campaign contributions. Investigators 
said that Cox used his various business and nonprofit ventures to secure fraudulent loans and misappropriate 
investor funds for personal expenses and unrelated business activities. The article confirmed that as part of his plea 
agreement, Cox pled guilty to two counts while prosecutors agreed to dismiss the remaining charges at sentencing. 
The plea deal requires Cox to accept responsibility for his actions, cooperate with investigators, and repay 
misappropriated funds.Cox also agreed to pay up to $3.5 million in restitution to victims. The article added that

November 2017 until his departure on April 7, 2023. Holding roles including vice president and controller, George 
had access to material non-public information (MNPI) regarding Celsius's financial performance. The article 
detailed that court documents reveal that on his last day of employment, George used a company computer to 
generate a consolidated income statement showing that Celsius Holdings Inc.'s first-quarter earnings for 2023 
greatly exceeded expectations. Aware that the information was confidential, George emailed the statement to 
himself using two personal email accounts. The article indicated that following his departure, George began trading 
Celsius stock on April 10, 2023, the first trading day after he left the company. Over the next several weeks, he 
purchased 20,000 shares of Celsius common stock and 300 call option contracts based on the inside information he
