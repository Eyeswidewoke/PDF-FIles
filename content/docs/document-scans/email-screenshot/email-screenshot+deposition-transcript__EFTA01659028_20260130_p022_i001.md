California Court Refuses To Hear Bayer's Appeal Of Roundup Verdict.

appeal by Bayer to reverse a jury verdict that its Roundup herbicide caused Dewayne "Lee"

Court's decision leaves Bayer few options to avoid paying the $20.4 million judgment.

EU, UK To Enforce Sanctions On GRU Officers Over 2015 Cyberattack On Germany. 
The AP (10/22) reports that the EU "on Thursday imposed sanctions on two Russian officials 
and part of Russia's GRU military intelligence agency over a cyberattack against the German 
parliament in 2015." The EU is imposing "travel bans and asset freezes...on the two men: Igor 
Kostyukov, head of the Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces, and 
Dmitry Badin, a military intelligence officer." Badin is "also being sought by U.S. authorities." An 
EU statement said, "This cyber-attack targeted the parliament's information system and 
affected its operation for several days. A significant amount of data was stolen and the email 
accounts of several MPs as well as of Chancellor Angela Merkel were affected." 
Reuters (10/22) reports, "Britain will enforce asset freezes and travel bans against" two 
GRU officers and one GRU unit "responsible for 2015 cyber attacks on Germany's parliament, 
the foreign office said on Thursday." The sanctions, "which come into force immediately, were 
made under the European Union's regime." UK Foreign Minister Dominic Raab said, "The UK 
stands shoulder-to-shoulder with Germany and our European partners to hold Russia to account 
for cyber attacks designed to undermine Western democracies." He added, "This criminal 
behaviour brings the Russian government into further disrepute." 
CyberScoop (10/22) reports that the sanctions "stand to bolster the U.S. position, too." 
Assistant Attorney General for National Security John Demers said it is "part of a broader trend 
toward international allies' attribution of attacks that is `very helpful' and something the U.S. 
has made an important objective." Demers added, "If it's just us, it's easy for the Chinese 
government or the Russian government or the Iranians to just say, 'Oh, no, this is just the U.S. 
being mad at us over whatever other issue, and they're just using this as a political tool." 
Reuters (10/22) reports that Assistant Attorney General for National Security John Demers 
"accused China on Thursday of helping North Korea launder money from massive cyber thefts it 
has carried out to raise funds in the face of international sanctions." Demers "also said North 
Korea was likely getting support from China in the form of cyber expertise and training." He 
said, "There is support through Chinese cyber infrastructure, there's likely support in terms of 
sharing expertise and training from the Chinese side." 
Security Researcher Says He Accessed Trump's Twitter Account. 
TechCrunch (10/22, 605K) reports Dutch security researcher Victor Gevers "says he accessed 
President Trump's @realDonaldTrump Twitter account last week by guessing his password: 
'maga2020!" The account "was not protected by two-factor authentication, granting Gevers 
access to the president's account. ... It's the second time Gevers has gained access to Trump's 
Twitter account." In 2016, Gevers and two others "extracted and cracked Trump's password 
from the 2012 Linkedln breach. The researchers took his password - 'yourefired' — his 
catchphrase from the television show The Apprentice - and found it let them into his Twitter 
account."
