misleading reporting in the mainstream media, according to election administrators, voting 
rights advocates and experts in online communication." According to the Post, "The confusion 
and chaos follow a months-long campaign by Trump and his allies to sow doubt about voting by 
mail, a method of casting ballots that has been embraced in Democratic- and Republican-
leaning states and has grown more popular this year because of the coronavirus pandemic." 
Meanwhile, the New York Times (10/23, Grady, 18.61M) highlighted a new Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention report that "cites lessons learned from Delaware's primary and 
suggests that voters could use some instruction in the right way to wear a mask." The Times 
reported that while "many states and cities have imposed safety measures to protect voters 
and poll workers from exposure to the coronavirus," the CDC on Friday warned that polling 
places "still have the potential to become `mass gathering events," and it announced "measures 
to prevent the spread of Covid-19 could be improved." CNN (10/23, 83.16M) reports similarly. 
Bloomberg View: US Election Security Effort Robust Despite President's Public 
Comments. The editorial board of Bloomberg View (10/25, 4.73M) wrote that the US 
government "has gone to extraordinary lengths to protect this year's election from foreign 
interference." Last week, for instance, DNI Ratcliffe and FBI Director Christopher Wray "held a 
joint briefing to warn that Iran and Russia had obtained registration data and (in Iran's case) 
sent fraudulent emails intended to intimidate voters." On October 15, DOJ "announced the 
indictment of six Russian intelligence officers who had engaged in politically motivated 
computer attacks around the world, including one who had previously been charged for the 
2016 incident." Behind the scenes, national security agencies "have frozen the assets of foreign 
hackers, imposed sanctions, revoked visas, knocked spies offline, prevented suspected 
adversaries from entering the U.S., and worked with social-media companies to take down 
suspect accounts, all in a preemptive effort to prevent further meddling." The moves are "in 
marked contrast to the president himself, who has said next to nothing about election 
interference publicly." 
Cuccinelli Addresses Foreign Interference In US Election. 
On the RJ Harris Show (10/23), Acting DHS Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli addressed the 
department's recent report on foreign interference in the election. On the Mike Broomhead 
Show (10/23), Cuccinelli explained "what information the Russians and Iranians got from us," 
and sought to reassure "Americans that their votes cannot be changed or negated." 
Ransomware Attack On Georgia County Government Disables Voter Signature 
Database. 
The AP (10/23, Bajak) reports, "A ransomware attack that hobbled a Georgia county 
government in early October reportedly disabled a database used to verify voter signatures in 
the authentication of absentee ballots." The ransomware attack marks "the first reported case 
of" such an attack impacting "an election-related system in the 2020 cycle." The attack on Hall 
County, which took place on October 7, "hit critical systems and interrupted phone services, the 
county said in a statement posted on its website." The AP paraphrases a Gainesville Times 
report as having said that "the attack also disabled the county's voter signature database." 
Atlanta Journal-Constitution: Georgia Voting System Vulnerable To Cyberattacks. 
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution (10/23, 895K) reports, "Georgia's new electronic voting 
system is vulnerable to cyberattacks that could undermine public confidence, create chaos at 
the polls or even manipulate the results on Election Day." While state officials "have dismissed" 
concerns over "security deficiencies in Georgia's system and in electronic voting in general," a 
Journal-Constitution investigation "shows...Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger's office 
weakened the system's defenses, disabling password protections on a key component that 
controls who is allowed to vote." His office has also "pushed out new software to each of the 
state's 30,000 voting machines through hundreds of thumb drives that experts say are prone to
