US Condemns Tigray Forces' Attacks On Eritrea. 
Reuters (11/15, Lewis) reports Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Tibor Nagy on 
Sunday "denounced attacks by Ethiopia's rebellious Tigray region on neighbouring Eritrea." 
Nagy tweeted, "The United States strongly condemns the TPLF's unjustifiable attacks against 
Eritrea on November 14 and its efforts to internationalize the conflict in Tigray. We continue to 
urge immediate action to protect civilians, deescalate tensions, and restore peace." 
The Washington Post (11/15, Wroughton, 14.2M) reports that "at least two rockets were 
fired from Ethiopia into neighboring Eritrea overnight Saturday as the conflict between regional 
rulers in Ethiopia's northern Tigray state and the federal government of Prime Minister Abiy 
Ahmed spilled across the border, further raising fears that more countries in the Horn of Africa 
could be drawn into the conflict." In what the Post calls "a major escalation of a two-week-old 
conflict, Tigray's president, Debretsion Gebremichael, said his forces had fired missiles" at the 
Eritrean capital of Asmara "because it had sided with Ahmed's government in Addis Ababa." The 
New York Times (11/15, Walsh, 18.61M) likewise says the risks of the fighting "could be even 
wider: the potential fracturing of Ethiopia and the upending of the entire Horn of Africa." 
The Wall Street Journal (11/15, Bariyo, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) quotes 
Gebremichael as saying, "The Eritrean and Ethiopian army are fighting us. We shall protect our 
country from invaders." In an interview the AP (11/15, Anna), Gebremichael said, "As long as 
troops are here fighting, we will take any legitimate military target and we will fire," accusing 
Eritrea of sending troops into the Tigray region and denying reports that Tigray regional forces 
have entered Eritrea. Reuters (11/15, Paravicini), among other outlets, also reports the 
fighting. 
UN: 20,000 Ethiopian Refugees Flee To Sudan. Reuters (11/15) reports the UNHCR 
said Sunday that "at least 20,000" people have fled into Sudan from the conflict in northern 
Ethiopia. 
Israel Advances Plan To Build 1,200 Apartments In East Jerusalem Settlement. 
Bloomberg (11/15, Levingston, 4.73M) reports Israel is "pushing forward with controversial 
plans to develop a Jewish enclave in a strategic area of East Jerusalem." On Sunday, the Israel 
Land Authority "solicited bids to build 1,257 apartments in the Givat Hamatos area, a project 
that was originally approved in 2014 but was delayed over international opposition." Reuters 
(11/15, Heller) reports critics said the announcement "was aimed at shoring up the project 
before U.S. President-elect Joe Biden takes office." 
Israel Seeks To Attract Gulf Tourists To Jerusalem. The AP (11/15, Hazboun, 
Krauss) reports that when the UAE agreed to normalize relations with Israel, "the Palestinians 
decried the move as a 'betrayal' of both Jerusalem...and the Al-Aqsa mosque compound, the 
city's holiest Muslim site." But with Israel "now courting wealthy Gulf tourists and establishing 
new air links to the major travel hubs of Dubai and Abu Dhabi, Palestinians in East Jerusalem 
could soon see a tourism boon." 
Macron: Europe Needs Its Own Sovereignty In Defense Strategy. 
Reuters (11/15) reports French President Emmanuel Macron said in an interview published 
Sunday that "Europe still needs its own independent and sovereign defense strategy, even if it 
is dealing with a new US government which may result in friendlier ties." In the interview with 
"Revue Grand Continent" publication, Macron "rebuffed comments from German Defense 
Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer to Politico on Nov. 2, in which the German minister said 
Europe would have to remain dependent on US military protection for the near future." Said 
Macron, "The United States will only respect us as allies if we are serious about our own 
position, and if we have our own sovereignty regarding our defense."
