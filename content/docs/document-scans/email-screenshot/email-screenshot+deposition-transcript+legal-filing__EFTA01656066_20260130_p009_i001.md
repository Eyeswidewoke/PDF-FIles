billionaire who once admitted to feds he worked for Chinese intelligence, according to reports. According to the 
article, while in that role, Tucker also approved an email putting forward ex-golf club hospitality worker Lin Gui'an 
for a top position in the New York Police Department, which he eventually got. Lin's links to the Chinese Communist 
Party were exposed by the Post last week. Before joining the FDNY, Tucker was boss of T&M USA LLC, a Manhattan-
based global private investigations firm that once counted controversial Chinese billionaire Miles Guo as a 
client. Guo — also known as Guo Wengui and Miles Kwok, among other names — was convicted in a billion-dollar 
fraud scheme in Manhattan federal court in July. He faces decades in jail when sentenced in November. The article 
noted that Guo, a pal of former President Donald Trump adviser Steve Bannon, admitted to having worked for 
China's Ministry of State Security, but also claimed to be a victim of CCP harassment, according to the New Yorker. 
His lavish apartment at the Sherry Netherland by Central Park was wired for sound to record his visitors, according 
to sources. A mysterious fire broke out while FBI agents searched that apartment last year. Authorities are 
investigating whether the blaze was sparked remotely, according to reports. T&M began working for Guo in 2017, 
according to Chinese-language media and court documents. The article mentioned that in March 2022, an email 
including Lin's resume was sent by a personal assistant at T&M, with Tucker copied, to then-NYPD Deputy 
Commissioner Edward Caban. The FDNY denied the commissioner had vouched for Lin, with a spokesperson saying: 
"Commissioner Tucker was not involved in any way and made no such recommendation." Caban rose to become 
NYPD commissioner last summer, but resigned last Thursday following an FBI raid on his home two weeks ago. Lin 
was hired in 2022 to fulfill a non-uniform position and quickly rose through the ranks, despite his limited police 
experience. Within a year, he became assistant general director of the Police Commissioner Liaison Unit, where he 
was described as Caban's "right hand." Lin, who was born in Fujian province in China, was previously vice chairman 
of the New York City-based Fujian Changle Nanxiang Benevolent Association for 12 years beginning in 1994, a year 
after he arrived in the US, according to Chinese-language media reports. The Rolling Stone (09/17, Ramirez) also 
reported on the story. 
Mississippi High Court Rejects the Latest Appeal by a Man on Death Row Since 1994 
The Associated Press (09/17, Pettus) reported that the Mississippi Supreme Court has denied the latest appeal by a 
man who has been on death row for 30 years after he was convicted of killing two college students. The decision 
could clear the way for the state to set an execution date for Willie Jerome Manning, but his attorney said Tuesday 
that his legal team will seek a rehearing. The court's majority wrote in a 5-4 ruling Monday that Manning "has had 
his days in court" Dissenting justices wrote that a trial court should hold a hearing about a witness who wants to 
recant his testimony against Manning, 56, who has spent more than half his life in prison. The article added 
that Manning's attorneys have filed multiple appeals since he was convicted in 1994 on two counts of capital 
murder in the December 1992 killings of Mississippi State University students Jon Steckler and Tiffany Miller. Their 
bodies were found in rural Oktibbeha County, and Miller's car was missing. The car was found the next morning. 
Prosecutors said Manning was arrested after he tried to sell items belonging to the victims. Krissy Nobile, 
Manning's attorney and director of the Mississippi Office of Capital Post-Conviction Counsel, said Tuesday that the 
justices' majority ruling ignores "newly discovered evidence with the recantation of several key witnesses," 
including one who said in a sworn statement that she was paid $17,500 for fraudulent testimony. The article noted 
that in 2013, shortly before Manning was scheduled to be executed, the DOJ said there had been errors in FBI 
agents' testimony about ballistics tests and hair analysis in the case. Manning's attorneys asked the Mississippi 
Supreme Court to stop the lethal injection, and justices voted 8-1 to delay the execution to allow the testing of 
evidence. Manning's attorneys asked an Oktibbeha County circuit judge for permission to send items to a more 
specialized lab. The judge denied that request, and the ruling was upheld by the Mississippi Supreme Court in 
2022. 
A Woman Found Dead in 1991 in an Illinois Cornfield Is Identified as Being From the Chicago Area 
The Associated Press (09/17, Staff Writer) reported that a person found dead in an Illinois cornfield in 1991 has 
been identified as a Chicago-area woman more than a decade after authorities began reexamining the cold case. 
An investigation relying on a posthumous DNA sample led to the identification of Paula Ann Lundgren last week. 
Now authorities hope they can piece together more details about her life and the circumstances of her death. Over 
the years, numerous authorities have tried to identify the woman. According to the article, her body was exhumed 
in 2013 to obtain DNA and employ investigative methods not in use in the early 1990s. In 2019, a professor at 
Illinois Valley Community College used investigative genetic genealogy to produce a list of the woman's possible 
living relatives. The LaSalle County coroner's office went through the list for years trying to find a match before 
involving the FBI in February. In July there was a break in the case. The article quoted Coroner Rich Ploch, who
