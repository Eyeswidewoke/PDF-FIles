"appointed three assistant U.S. attorneys, in three regions of the state, to serve as elections 
officers for the district and field complaints," and all "will be on duty while polls are open." 
WJAR-TV Providence, RI (10/22, 144K) reports that on Thursday, Rhode Island Secretary 
of State Nellie Gorbea was joined at a press briefing "by the FBI, Rhode Island State Police, 
Board of Elections and the Attorney General to discuss the upcoming election." The Rhode 
Island official "estimates about half of all voters in the state will cast their ballots before 
Election Day," and "early voting numbers won't be added to the total votes until 10 p.m. on 
election night." FBI Boston Special Agent in Charge Joseph Bonavolonta said, "As far as these 
disinformation campaigns, the reason why they're so powerful is because you look at 
everybody's reliance these days on social media platforms."

"Anarchist" Cities Sue Trump Administration Over Designation. 
The AP (10/22, Johnson, Matthews) reports, "New York, Seattle and Portland - three cities 
recently labeled 'anarchist jurisdictions' by the U.S. Justice Department - filed a lawsuit 
Thursday to invalidate the designation and fight off the Trump Administration's efforts to 
withhold federal dollars." The suit "ridiculed the designation, calling the President's action 
'offensive to both the Constitution and common sense," and "noted that the consequences of 
withholding federal money during a pandemic are 'deadly serious.'" The cities argue that "the 
President can't add conditions to money Congress has appropriated," and claims "the 
Administration violated due process rights and the 10th Amendment." 
The New York Times (10/22, Fitzsimmons, 18.61M) reports that the Administration's 
"attempt to strip New York City of federal funds...could cost the city as much as $12 billion -
money for the cash-starved subway, for the Police Department and for the city's efforts to treat 
coronavirus patients, city officials said on Thursday." According to the Times, "although the city 
was granted $2.65 billion in Covid-related funding from the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency, only $199.6 million of it has been doled out." 
The Oregonian (10/22, 1M) reports that Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler (D) "said the money 
at risk is 'critical to protecting vulnerable residents,'" including "federal funds for coronavirus 
relief, funds for HIV treatment, and funds for newborn screenings." New York City Corporation 
Counsel Jim Johnson "said the cities are acting now because the federal government has begun 
taking concrete steps to withhold funds." 
Judge Dismisses Third-Degree Murder Charge In Floyd Case. 
ABC World News TonightVi (10/22, story 7, 0:20, Muir, 6.71M) reported, "A Minnesota judge 
tonight has upheld eight of nine charges against the former police officers in the George Floyd 
case. Derek Chauvin, seen with his knee on Floyd's neck, still facing second degree 
unintentional murder and manslaughter charges, though a lesser charge was dropped. The 
other three officers had all charges upheld, each facing aiding and abetting murder and 
manslaughter. The trial for all four is set for March." 
The AP (10/22, Forliti) reports that Hennepin County District Judge Peter Cahill "dismissed 
a third-degree murder charge filed against the former Minneapolis police officer who pressed 
his knee against George Floyd's neck, saying there was not enough probable cause for that 
count to proceed to trial." Gov. Tim Walz (D) "activated the Minnesota National Guard in 
anticipation of protests" after similar demonstrations broke out "after Chauvin was released on 
bail earlier this month, resulting in dozens of arrests." Cahill "said Chauvin's decision to 
continue kneeling on Floyd's neck after he went silent and motionless 'is strong evidence of 
Chauvin's intent to inflict bodily harm," but that "nothing about the manner in which Chauvin 
pressed his knee down on Floyd's neck...was eminently dangerous to anyone other than Floyd," 
making the third-degree murder charge inappropriate in this case.
