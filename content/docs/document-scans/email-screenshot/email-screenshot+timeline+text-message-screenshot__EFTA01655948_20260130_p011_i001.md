routers, particularly those from 2010 or earlier that no longer receive software updates. According to the article, 
the FBI has received reports of breaches using TheMoon malware, which can infect routers without a password and 
allow cyber actors to conduct crimes anonymously. The article noted that users are advised to maintain and update 
their home routers, with Scott Gee recommending that hospital IT teams pay attention to remote workers' home 
equipment to prevent threats.

INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS 
Fugitive Accused of Several Bank Robberies Extradited to U.S. After Years of Hiding in Ukraine 
Fox News (05/21, Schmidbauer) reported that an international fugitive wanted for multiple bank robberies has 
been extradited from Ukraine after nearly three years on the run, according to authorities. Edward Deveaux of 
Berlin Township, New Jersey, was returned to the U.S. on Friday, wrote the Camden County Prosecutor's Office in a 
press release. Deveaux, 30, was taken into custody Feb. 25 in Lviv by the National Guard of Ukraine. Nearly three 
months later, he was taken to the Polish border and turned over to U.S. Marshals and Polish authorities. The article 
mentioned that his arrest is a "testament to what we can accomplish when law enforcement at all levels works 
together," Camden County Prosecutor Grace MacAulay said, according to the release. "We are grateful for the 
efforts of the U.S. Marshals Service, FBI, and our international colleagues." Deveaux was wanted in connection with 
three bank robberies in southern New Jersey, all of which took place between Sept. 22 and Sept. 28, 2022. He 
stands accused of robbing a Truist Bank in Waterford, a TD Bank in Willingboro and a Republic Bank in Winslow. 
During their investigation into the matter, authorities determined that Deveaux had flown to multiple European 
countries before finally settling in Ukraine in the days following the final robbery in Winslow. The article stated that 
additional information led them to Lviv, where the suspect was ultimately tracked down.

OTHER FBI NEWS 
Continued Reporting: James Comey Tells Colbert What Led to Him Posting Controversial '86 47 Instagram 
Post 
Fox News (05/21, Tamasco) reported that former FBI Director James Comey explained what led to his controversial 
"86 47" Instagram post directed at President Donald Trump during an appearance on "The Late Show" Tuesday 
night. Comey claimed that he and his wife, Patrice, saw the "clever political message" while walking on the beach 
when his wife suggested that he take a picture of the shells and post it online. The ex-FBI director posted an 
Instagram photo of seashells arranged to show the numbers "86 47," a message White House officials swiftly 
condemned as an attempt to put out a "hit" against the 47th president. According to the article, Comey told host 
Stephen Colbert that his wife initially questioned why someone would "put their address in the sand," before 
coming up with a second theory behind the message. Comey later deleted the post after online backlash from 
government officials, lawmakers and Trump's son. Trump has faced two assassination attempts in the past year, 
one of which resulted in him being wounded and a bystander being killed. The Washington Examiner (05/21, 
Goldsberry), the Independent (05/21, Sherratt), and the Daily Caller (05/21, Hart) also reported on the story.
