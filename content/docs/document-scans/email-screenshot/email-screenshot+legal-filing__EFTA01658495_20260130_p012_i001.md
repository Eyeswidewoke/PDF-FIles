Bloomberg (9/30, Davalos, 4.73M) reports, "U.S. national intelligence agencies released a 
movie Wednesday to raise awareness of how foreign intelligence entities use social media to 
target Americans." According to Bloomberg, "The film, called 'The Nevernight Connection,' tells 
the fictional account of a former U.S. intelligence official who went to spy for the Chinese. The 
official was targeted by a Chinese foreign intelligence service through a fake profile on a 
professional networking site and recruited to turn over classified information. It was inspired by 
the true story of former Central Intelligence Agency officer Kevin Mallory, who was sentenced to 
20 years in prison in 2019 for passing national defense information to a Chinese intelligence 
officer. The 30-minute film, released by the FBI and the National Counterintelligence and 
Security Center, is free and available on the FBI's website."

hacker is shown posting a notice on a fictional social networking site in a bid to contact people 
with access to secrets who may be recruited as spies. The email entices a U.S. intelligence 
community expert who was a former underwater warfare specialist at a Naval Support Facility 
Dahlgren in Virginia. The specialist is offered $1,500 to produce a white paper on how advanced 
technology will affect undersea exploration." The Times adds, "Alan E. Kohler, FBI assistant 
director for counterintelligence said in a statement the movie 'highlights [how] foreign 
intelligence services are posing as headhunters and consultants on professional networking 
sites to aggressively target Americans."
