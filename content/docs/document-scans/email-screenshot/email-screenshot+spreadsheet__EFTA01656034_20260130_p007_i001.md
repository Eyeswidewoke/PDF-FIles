collaborating with our law enforcement partners to protect the residents of Michigan and defend the United States 
against such grave threats." Fox News (06/05, Miller) added that Michael Sobolik, a senior fellow at the Hudson 
Institute, told Fox News after Director Patel announced the arrests, that the arrests should be a wake-up call, as the 
CCP aims to "kill Americans" and is in a "cold war" with the U.S. An opinion piece from the Washington Times 
(06/05, Sadler) quoted a statement from Director Patel: "This case is a sobering reminder that the CCP is working 
around the clock to deploy operatives and researchers to infiltrate American institutions and target our food 
supply, which would have grave consequences ... putting American lives and our economy at serious risk." The 
article added that when the China Initiative was launched in 2018, FBI Director Christopher A. Wray testified on the 
"naivete" of college administrators in admitting CCP agents. "The use of nontraditional collectors, especially in the 
academic setting — whether it's professors, scientists, students — we see in almost every field office that the FBI 
has around the country," he said. The Hill (06/05, Taub) and WXYZ (ABC-7) (06/05, Jones) also reported on the 
story. 
The Trump Administration Revives an Old Intimidation Tactic: The Polygraph Machine 
An analysis from CNN (06/05, Wolf) reported that the Trump administration is using polygraph tests as a method of 
intimidation to ferret out leakers, according to attorney Mark Zaid, who specializes in representing people who 
work in national security. According to the article, the use of polygraph tests has been reported at various agencies, 
including the FBI, Pentagon, and Department of Homeland Security, with officials defending the practice as a way 
to protect government information. The article noted that critics argue that polygraph tests are unreliable and can 
be used to falsely accuse innocent people, with examples including the failure to detect spies such as Aldrich Ames 
and Robert Hanssen, who either passed polygraph exams or were never given one. 
Continued Reporting: U.S. Intelligence Worker Arrested for 'Trying to Leak Secrets to Germany' 
The Times (06/05, Moody) reported that Nathan Vilas Laatsch, a 28-year-old U.S. intelligence worker, has been 
arrested for allegedly trying to leak state secrets to Germany's Federal Intelligence Service (BND). According to the 
article, Laatsch, who had "top secret" clearance, reportedly copied sensitive information onto paper files and a USB 
drive, and attempted to pass it to the BND via email, citing disagreement with the U.S. administration's values. The 
article noted that the BND tipped off American intelligence, leading to an FBI investigation, and Laatsch was caught 
after handing over classified information to an undercover FBI agent posing as a BND contact.

CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS 
North Carolina Judge Revokes Bond for House Party Shooting Suspect 
The Associated Press (06/05, Staff Writer) reported that a North Carolina judge ordered Thursday that a defendant 
accused in last weekend's shootings at a house party that left one person dead and 11 others injured stay in jail 
while awaiting trial. The decision came the day after another judge had set a $200,000 bond for Garon Nathaniel 
Killian, 20, of Lenoir, who is charged with one count of attempted first-degree murder related to the shootings. 
Prosecutors on Wednesday had asked that no bond be allowed. The article mentioned that Killian had not posted 
the amount to be released. On Thursday, when Killian had a court date for charges involving a different altercation 
in April, District Court Judge Scott Conrad revoked the $200,000 bond related to last weekend's violent fracas, 
according to the Catawba County Clerk of Court's office. Investigators of the shootings that happened early Sunday 
believe at least 80 shots were fired in a crime scene that spanned several properties along a road in the usually 
quiet residential neighborhood. FBI agents spent this week at the scene examining bullet trajectories. WLOS (ABC-
13) (06/05, Doty) and WCNC (NBC-36) (06/05, Lee, Pierre) also reported on the story. 
South Texas BORTAC Team Helping Search for Escaped Inmate 
Border Report (06/05, Sanchez) reported that the Border Patrol Tactical Unit (BORTAC) from the Rio Grande Valley 
Sector is heading to Arkansas to help with the manhunt for an escaped inmate, the agency announced 
Thursday. The BORTAC team's deployment from South Texas will help state and local law enforcement agencies 
who are looking for convicted murderer Grant Hardin. Hardin, 56, escaped May 25 from the North Central Unit 
state prison in Calico Rock, Arkansas, according to the Arkansas Department of Corrections. The FBI is offering a 
reward of up to $20,000 for information leading to his capture. Hardin is considered armed and dangerous and the 
public is urged to call law enforcement and the FBI with information on him, the FBI says.
