Simington Tried To Enlist Laura Ingraham In Fight Against Social Media 
Companies. Politico (11/23, Hendel, 4.29M) reports President Trump's FCC nominee Nathan 
Simington "reached out to Fox News this summer in an attempt at 'engaging' host Laura 
Ingraham to support...Trump's quest to make it easier to sue social media companies like 
Facebook and Twitter, according to emails obtained by POLITICO. Simington, a senior adviser in 
a key Commerce Department tech agency, wrote that the popular Fox News host could help 
sway the FCC to act on Trump's proposal before Election Day." In a June 22 to a Fox News 
staffer, Simington wrote, "Any additional support we might be able to obtain could help to get 
the FCC on board more quickly and thereby ensure a freer, fairer social media landscape going 
into the elections this fall." 
Feinstein To Step Down As Top Democrat On Senate Judiciary Committee. 
The Washington Post (11/23, Sonmez, Kim, 14.2M) reports Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) 
announced Monday that she will step down from the top Democratic spot on the Senate 
Judiciary Committee next year. The decision comes "after criticism from liberal groups for her 
handling of Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett's confirmation hearings." The New York 
Times (11/23, Fandos, 18.61M) says Feinstein is "bowing to intense pressure by progressives 
who said she was not up to the task of leading a crucial panel at the forefront of the partisan 
war over the courts in a new Biden administration." 
Bloomberg (11/23, Litvan, 4.73M) reports a statement from Feinstein "said she instead 
will focus attention on issues of importance to her, including the wildfires and droughts in her 
home state of California. She said she will continue to serve on the Judiciary panel, as well as 
three other committees: Intelligence, Appropriations and Rules." 
The AP (11/23, Jalonick, Daly) reports Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL), "the Senate's No. 2 
Democrat, said he will seek to replace Feinstein as the committee's top Democrat. He is third in 
seniority on the panel, after Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy, who is currently the top Democrat on 
the appropriations committee." The Wall Street Journal (11/23, Peterson, Subscription 
Publication, 7.57M), Politico (11/23, Levine, Everett, 4.29M), and The Hill (11/23, Bolton, 
2.98M) provide similar coverage. 
House Democrats Prepare To Govern With Tightest Majority in Two Decades. 
The Washington Post (11/23, DeBonis, 14.2M) reports House Democratic leaders, who are 
"facing the tightest House majority in at least two decades," are "already sketching out ways to 
manage a legislature that will spend two years on a razor's edge." The Post adds, "Pushing any 
sort of partisan measure through the House will require near-unanimity inside their party, 
forcing careful negotiations with various factions of lawmakers and perhaps fewer aspirational 
'messaging' bills meant to set out Democratic ideals but not necessarily become law." At the 
same time, "an emboldened Republican minority will look to wreak havoc and magnify internal 
disputes ahead of the 2022 midterms." House Minority Leader McCarthy "and other Republican 
leaders have already signaled they plan to use various procedural feints to frustrate Democrats 
and sow internal division."
