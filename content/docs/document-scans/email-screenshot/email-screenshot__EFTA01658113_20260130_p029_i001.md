The Louisville (KY) Courier-Journal (7/23, Sonka, 368K) reports, "The FBI kept more than 700 
pages of documents related to pardons and commutations issued by former Gov. Matt Bevin for 
about six months this year." The FBI "took possession of the documents in January, but recently 
returned them to the administration of current Gov. Andy Beshear. Obtained by The Courier 
Journal, the pardon review forms include handwritten notes from the governor's attorneys and 
Bevin himself, discussing the strengths and weaknesses of applicants and sometimes weighing 
in on their religious beliefs and the political optics of a pardon. On one form, Bevin even 
appears to have fully pardoned Mark Taylor - a Lexington man convicted in 2016 of murdering 
Alex Johnson in a high-profile case - though a clemency order was never filed with the 
secretary of state's office." 
Connecticut Supreme Court Upholds Alex Jones Sanctions In Sandy Hook Case. 
The AP (7/23, Collins) reports from Hartford, Connecticut, "The Connecticut Supreme Court on 
Thursday upheld a sanction against Infowars host Alex Jones over an angry outburst on his web 
show against an attorney for relatives of some of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting 
victims, who are suing him for defamation." The court "issued a 7-0 decision rejecting Jones' 
claims that his comments aimed at attorney Christopher Mattei were protected by free speech 
rights, and upholding a lower court's ruling that Jones violated numerous orders to turn over 
documents to the families' lawyers. The lower court judge barred Jones from filing a motion to 
dismiss the lawsuit, as a penalty for his actions." The AP adds, "The families of eight victims of 
the 2012 shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, and an FBI agent who responded to the massacre 
are suing Jones, Infowars and others for promoting a theory that the shooting was a hoax." 
Houston Police Officer Relieved Of Duty Amid Probe. 
The Houston Chronicle (7/23, Barned-Smith, 730K) reports, "A Houston Police narcotics officer 
is under investigation and has been relieved of duty, officials said." According to the Chronicle, 
"The officer, Juan Martinez, joined the department in 2005. He is assigned to the narcotics 
division and was relieved July 16, spokesman Kese Smith said. Several law enforcement 
sources said Martinez is being investigated for inappropriate conduct related to undercover 
operations and confidential informants, but officials have not yet provided additional details." 
The Chronicle adds, "The action is the latest to hit the narcotics division, which has come under 
scrutiny over the past 18 months after a January 2019 drug raid that led to the deaths of two 
homeowners and to the shooting of four officers. The officer who led the raid, Gerald Goines, 
was later accused of lying about buying drugs from the home, and Harris County District 
Attorney Kim Ogg subsequently announced prosecutors would be reviewing more than 14,000 
cases Goines and his former squadmates had handled." 
Bulger's Girlfriend Completes Prison Sentence. 
The AP (7/23) reports from Boston, "The longtime girlfriend of late Boston gangster James 
'Whitey' Bulger has completed her federal prison sentence and moved in with her twin sister." 
According to the AP, "Federal agents removed Catherine Greig's electronic monitoring bracelet 
Thursday, WBZ-TV reported. Greig, 69, spent the last year of her sentence living under home 
confinement with Bulger's relatives in the affluent Boston suburb of Hingham. She's moving 
back to her hometown of South Boston." Greig "joined Bulger on the run in 1995 shortly after 
he fled Boston to evade a federal racketeering indictment. The couple was captured in 2011 in 
Santa Monica, California."
