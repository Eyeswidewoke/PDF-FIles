homeland as they gain in capability and capacity. The situation in the Sahel region is further complicated by the 
influence of China and Russia, which are investing heavily in the region and forging alliances with local 
governments, as evidenced by the U.S. being asked to leave a military base in Niger last year, which was then 
occupied by Russian troops. The article noted that Gen. Langley's warning comes at a time when the Trump 
administration is canceling aid programs across the continent and considering consolidating military leadership in 
Africa with one already overseeing troops in Europe, highlighting the need for continued vigilance and attention to 
the growing terrorist threat in the region. The article highlighted that a former Army guardsman was arrested 
before an ISIS-inspired terror attack. The article mentioned that the FBI says the former Army guardsman thought 
he was conducting the attack with two ISIS radicals, but they were actually undercover FBI agents. Fox News 
(05/29, Casiano, Friden) also reported on the story. 
Jewish Community Faces Unprecedentedly High Threat Environment 
ADL (05/29, Staff Writer) reported that the Jewish community is facing an unprecedentedly high threat 
environment, with 15 terrorist plots or attacks targeting Jews, Zionists, or Jewish institutions in the US since 
January 2020. Eight of these incidents occurred in the past 11 months, including the May 21, 2025, murders of 
Israeli Embassy staffers Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim in Washington D.C. Other notable incidents include the 
arrest of individuals such as Forrest Pemberton, Abdullah Ezzeldin Taha Mohamed Hassan, and Muhammad 
Shahzeb Khan, who were allegedly plotting to harm Jewish targets, and the attacks by individuals like Sidi 
Mohamed Abdallahi, Hashem Younis Hashem Hnaihen, and Asghar Ali, who targeted Jewish individuals or 
institutions. The article noted the FBI's involvement in several of the ensuing investigations. 
Venezuela Weaponized Tren de Aragua Gang to Hurt the U.S., FBI Warned in January 
Miami Herald (05/29, Delgado) reported that a newly surfaced FBI memo from January stated that the Venezuelan 
regime, led by Nicolas Maduro, is using the Tren de Aragua gang to destabilize the U.S. and other neighboring 
countries. The gang, classified as a "megagang," has been deliberately enabled by the Venezuelan government to 
expand its operations across Latin America and into U.S. cities, including New York and Chicago. The FBI believes 
that senior Venezuelan officials, including Maduro, are involved in the gang's daily operations, using them as a 
covert arm of the country's security state to assassinate dissidents, threaten exiled opposition figures, and 
weaponize migration as a geopolitical tool. In response, the FBI calls for enhanced coordination among federal, 
state, and local law enforcement, increased education on TDA tactics, and robust intelligence-sharing protocols. 
Legal attaches across the Americas have reportedly built strong partnerships with regional police forces—networks 
the FBI believes are critical to tracking TDA across borders. 
FBI, Mississippi Sheriff's Office Warn of Online Terrorist Group 
WHBQ (Fox-13) (05/29, Bilyeu) reported that the FBI and Marshall County Sheriff's Office are warning parents 
about a satanic, neo-Nazi terrorist group called "764" that targets children online. According to the article, the 
group uses social media and online games to contact children, encouraging them to harm themselves and others, 
and has been known to target victims as young as 9 years old. The article explained that parents are advised to be 
vigilant and watch for warning signs such as sudden behavior changes, new online friends, and unexplained 
injuries, as the FBI and law enforcement work to combat the group, with two leaders already arrested last month. 
Michigan Gov. Whitmer Says Trump Promised Not to Pardon Kidnapping Plotters 
The Washington Post (05/29, Vazquez) reported that Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer claims President Donald 
Trump promised not to pardon two men, Barry Croft Jr. and Adam Fox, who were convicted of plotting to kidnap 
her. Trump recently stated he would consider pardoning the men, contradicting his alleged previous promise to 
Whitmer. Responding to Trump's comments, Whitmer told Michigan Public Radio, "I talked to the president about a 
month ago and he asked me how I'd feel about this, and I said, 'I think it would be the wrong decision.' When asked 
if she thinks Trump is serious about the potential pardons, Whitmer said that wasn't clear. "When I talked to him 
before, we had a thoughtful conversation about it, and he said he'd drop it. So, I'm not sure what to make of this 
new revelation," she said in Thursday's interview. The article noted that federal and state officials originally charged 
multiple people in the plot against Whitmer, arresting the men in an October 2020 sting that involved the use of 
informants and undercover FBI agents. The officers embedded with the men, who were associates of a militia 
group known as the Wolverine Watchmen. Additional reporting on the story was provided by the New York Post 
(05/29, Reilly), The Daily Beast (05/29, Vaillancourt), Washington Examiner (05/29, O'Keefe).
