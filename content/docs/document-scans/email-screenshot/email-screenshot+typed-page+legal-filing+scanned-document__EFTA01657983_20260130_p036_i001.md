Donald Trump announced he was leaving U.S. troops to 'secure the oil,' multiple people familiar

as autonomous." Partners at the company, Delta Crescent Energy LLC, include "former U.S.

who said it was fake news, Trump said, "I think a lot of people. if you look at some of the 
wonderful folks from the bush administration - some of them not any friends of mine - were 
saying that it's a fake issue." Trump added, "It never reached my desk. You know why? Because 
they didn't think it — intelligence, they didn't think it was real."
