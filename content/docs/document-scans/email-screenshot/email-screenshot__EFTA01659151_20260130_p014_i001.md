Fayne, 58, "was indicted on wire fraud charges in federal court. The Cleveland-area real-estate 
developer is accused of using a subsidiary of a nonprofit to embezzle money for personal use. 
According to a press release from U.S. Attorney's Office in Cleveland, Fayne owned Business

him to divert money to himself." The Beacon Jopurnal adds, "According to the FBI, Fayne used 
that money for personal interests, including gambling. He's accused of using and losing more

The Cleveland Plain Dealer (12/7, Heisig, 895K) reports, "Prosecutors said Fayne stole

payments made by a nonprofit behind the project. At the same time, Fayne was using his 
company's money to gamble, losing large amounts between 2016 and 2018, according to the 
FBI."
