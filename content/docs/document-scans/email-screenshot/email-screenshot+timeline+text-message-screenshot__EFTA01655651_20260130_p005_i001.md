investigated the January 6 assault on the Capitol. According to the article, Dennehy's removal comes after the 
departure of eight veteran FBI officials involved in criminal investigations into Trump, and may lead to further 
layoffs of career officers. The article noted that Dennehy had vowed to "dig in" and resist the purge, and his 
departure has raised concerns about the influence of Trump and his allies in the justice system. "Today, we find 
ourselves in the middle of a battle of our own as good people are being walked out of the FBI," Dennehy wrote to 
staff last month. "And others are being targeted because they did their jobs in accordance with the law and FBI 
policy." The article noted that in his farewell email on Monday, Dennehy urged FBI officials to maintain the agency's 
independence. "As I leave today, I have an immense feeling of pride — to have represented an office of professionals 
who will always do the right thing for the right reasons; who will always seek the truth while upholding the rule of 
law," he wrote. "Who will always handle cases and evidence with an overabundance of caution and care for the 
innocent, the victims, and the process first; and who will always remain independent". Additional reporting on the

Continued Reporting: AG Bondi Says 'Truckload of Evidence' Related to Epstein Case Has Been Delivered 
to FBI Headquarters 
The New York Post (03/04, Nava) reported that Attorney General Pam Bondi has received a large amount of 
evidence related to the Jeffrey Epstein case, which has been delivered to FBI headquarters. "I have the FBI going 
through them," AG Bondi said, adding that Director Patel "is going to get us a detailed report as to why" the 
documents had been withheld. "We're going to go through it, go through it as fast as we can, but go through it very 
cautiously to protect all the victims of Epstein because there are a lot of victims," she said. AG Bondi reiterated that 
a "team" assembled by Director Patel is going to look over the documents "as fast" as possible so "we can get it out 
to the American people, because the American people have a right to know." Additional reporting on the story was 
provided by ABC News (03/04, Steakin, Faulders, Mallin), Daily Mail (03/04, Chain), Daily Wire (03/04, Schow), The

COUNTERTERRORISM 
John Kerry 'Systematically Derailed' FBI Probe of Iranian Terrorists While Pursuing Nuclear Deal 
The New York Post (03/04, Christenson) reported that the Obama administration allegedly "systematically derailed" 
an FBI probe into Iranian terrorists to pursue a nuclear deal with Tehran. According to the article, then-Secretary of 
State John Kerry personally interfered to block arrests, contradicting his sworn testimony to Congress. The article 
noted that the administration's actions included abandoning dozens of Iran-related investigations and setting up a 
"shadow amnesty program" to protect Iranian criminals, according to whistleblowers. Newsmax (03/04, Reyner) 
also reported on the story. 
Jordanian Quantico Breach Suspect Freed Under Biden Arrested Again by ICE 
Fox News (03/04, Ruiz) reported that Hasan Yousef Hamdan, a 32-year-old Jordanian national, has been re-arrested 
by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) after being previously released on bond. According to the 
article, Hamdan and Mohammad Khair Dabous, 28, were initially arrested for allegedly trespassing at Marine Corps 
Base Quantico in May 2024. The men allegedly claimed they were contracted drivers for Amazon and were accused 
of posing as delivery drivers. Military police stopped them at the gate, but the driver allegedly ignored them and 
tried to move into the compound. "A student overstay somehow gets in contact with someone illegally crossing 
into the U.S. on the other side of the country. Both of them wind up in that truck," Dave Katz, a former federal 
firearms instructor who has worked at Quantico and is now the CEO of Global Security Group, said. "There is no 
possible explanation for what happened other than a sinister one." Quantico is a Marine Corps base that also 
houses training facilities and a lab for the FBI and Drug Enforcement Administration, which could be potential 
terror targets, Katz said. The article added that the reason for Hamdan's new arrest is unclear, but he and Dabous 
still face immigration proceedings after charges related to the breach were dismissed without prejudice.
