in Sept you and I agreed to 50% =f phaidon . , you then unilaterraly changed our agreement . and said only = m should 
go to me as you were going to reserve 5 for later. and ke=p 10 for yourself. ( though I'm certain that the debt, an= 
artspace will also be a write off. ) When I had =reviously said as you and I sat in my dining room that i require =AO 
most people to pay for advice up front. so that I am assured that=l will be properly compensated for my work when 
strategies that i de=ise get used. you appeared slighted and said " are=you suggesting that i would go back on my 
word " I said no , yo= are my closest of friends ,but my experience is that when amo=nts get large people tend to get 
unhappy when it comes time to have =o pay ,. From day zero I said I think the minimum of 50 = 60 million is the fair 
price of the transaction . though this was a=ready much less than our agreed number, never telling me that you 
t=ought that was out of the range , but asking that i provide step by step d=tails and review all documents so that they 
would be perfect which i=did. and Taking your position that Alans involvement warranted=a discount even in the best 
of light , who you will have to ad=it not one-,not -one time in three years has he ev=r initated a unique idea. 
(including the new tenant in common =dea,) lets say he made a contribution to the plan and say ,eve= that it was 50 %. 
though no one could posit such a large amount =AO unless they were wearing a brightly colored clown suit. -you , af=er 
knowing full well my price ,as I had both sent to you in wr=ting and told to you on the phone -then asking for my help in 
execut=on, having me prepare a detailed execution list. you then and only =hen told me that you had decided after a 
number of conversations =AO with brad karp that 20 was the right number for both transactions =. I thought you should 
know that I feel It was remarkably unf=ir. Did brad even know of our prior agreement.? =C2 As you always say , why 
cant we sit in a room together , so that he =aid she said is kept to a minimum , I would ask that you I and Brad karp s=t 
together. If you didn't do the transactions , its one t=ing, but knowing the price up front. , using the detailed plan and 
then no= paying the price that had been fully disclosed to you and =AO the reasons for the amount detailed has left 
me felling qui=e uneasy.
