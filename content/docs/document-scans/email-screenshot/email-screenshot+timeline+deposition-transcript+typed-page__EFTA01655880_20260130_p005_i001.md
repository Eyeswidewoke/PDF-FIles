Palestinian Terror Watchlist Suspect Nabbed at Southern Border 
The National Desk (08/15, Galka) reported that Omar Shehada, a 35-year-old Palestinian on the terror watchlist, 
was apprehended at the Southern border in Santa Teresa, New Mexico. According to the article, Shehada, caught 
with a group of seven, was linked to using explosives and is now facing removal proceedings, highlighting ongoing 
concerns about terrorism-related activities at the border. The article noted that this incident follows recent 
apprehensions of other individuals with possible terror ties, with Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares 
expressing concerns over the potential risks of terrorism via border crossings. "Ask yourself this question: If you're 
on the FBI terrorist watch list, why are you trying to sneak into this country? So many of us in law enforcement are 
so worried that the next 9/11 isn't going to be planes hijacked, it's going to be someone crossing at the southern 
border," Miyares told Fox News this week.

toward FBI personnel and indicating readiness to act on these threats. The article noted that the FBI is investigating 
the case, with federal prosecutors emphasizing the serious risks such threats pose to public safety and the

communities and our democracy," said Director Wray in the press release. "The men and women of the FBI work 
tirelessly every day to defend our homeland and protect the American people. I am proud of their selfless spirit —
putting themselves in harm's way to keep others safe — and we will hold accountable anyone who threatens 
them."

COUNTERINTELLIGENCE 
FBI Resumes Flagging Foreign Disinformation to Social Media Giants 
The New York Times (08/15, Myers) reported that the FBI has recommenced its coordination with major social 
media platforms to counteract foreign disinformation aimed at influencing U.S. elections, following a temporary 
halt due to legal challenges. According to the article, this renewed effort is a response to escalated disinformation 
activities by foreign adversaries like Russia and Iran, with the FBI playing a key role in identifying and 
communicating these threats to platforms like Facebook and X. The article noted that the FBI's involvement has 
been critical in enabling social media companies to take down harmful content, with new operational guidelines 
ensuring that these actions respect First Amendment rights and are based on credible intelligence linking the 
disinformation to foreign entities. NBC News (08/15, Collier) added that Meta announced Thursday that pro-
Russian propagandists are still working to influence Americans ahead of the 2024 presidential elections. In the 
company's latest quarterly Adversarial Threat Report, Meta said that it had dismantled five distinct Russian 
propaganda campaigns in the last three months. The article noted that Meta's investigation began as a tip from the 
FBI, the company said. The FBI's Foreign Influence Task Force has routinely warned U.S. social media companies 
when the U.S. intelligence community has noticed foreign influence operations targeting Americans. The practice 
was suspended for months last year following a lawsuit by Republican state attorneys general against the U.S.
