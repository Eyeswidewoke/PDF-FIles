and his other legal cases, which may not be decided until after the election. The article mentioned that House 
Judiciary Committee Chair Jim Jordan (R-OH) called for cutting back funds for a new FBI headquarters and 
recommended tying spending for the agency to policy changes aimed at promoting "transparency," like requiring 
the FBI to record interviews. He also pushed for "defunding" what Republicans say are politicized prosecutions 
from prosecutors engaged in "lawfare." Jordan said this included Willis, Bragg, and New York Attorney 
General Letitia James, as well as federal special counsel Jack Smith's office. While the FBI receives significant 
federal funding, prosecutors such as Bragg and Willis, whose offices are primarily run through state and local funds, 
do not. The Associated Press (06/05, Mascaro, Jalonick), and the New York Times (06/05, Feuer) also reported on 
the story. 
Chicago Police Claim Mass Arresting DNC Protesters Are 'Last Resort: 
The Huffington Post (06/05, Karanth) reported that Chicago is preparing to again host the Democratic National 
Convention in August, with police claiming that officers are trained and ready to de-escalate possible civil unrest 
amid anticipated protests. The article added that law enforcement has long been planning for how to enforce 
security at the DNC, which is expected to bring tens of thousands of visitors and massive protests. Police 
Superintendent Larry Snelling, a veteran Chicago cop who was confirmed last year as chief, said Tuesday that 
officers are prepared to handle anticipated protesters and possible mass arrests. The article noted that Snelling 
said at a press conference alongside Secret Service and FBI officials, "Make no mistake, we are ready,". The article 
stated that the proposed changes for how police handle mass arrests are yet to be finalized, but so far 
include more supervisor review onsite as well as debriefings after the event to discuss which actions were effective. 
Officers have also undergone new de-escalation training, with some also receiving specialized training to "respond 
directly to civil unrest and the possibility of riots," according to Snelling. 
'The Man Who Conned the Pentagon' Can't Pursue Lawsuit Against FBI for Raiding Home, Ninth Circuit 
Rules 
Courthouse News Service (06/05, Ribakoff) reported that a Ninth Circuit panel agreed with a lower court's ruling 
that a Nevadan dubbed "the man who conned the Pentagon" by Playboy magazine in 2010 and his wife can't 
pursue a lawsuit against an FBI agent that participated in a raid on their home and storage units because they 
missed the statute of limitations. The article added that in the mid-2000's Dennis Montgomery, a former 
confidential informant to Arizona's Maricopa County Sheriff's office turned computer programmer who contracted 
with the CIA, Air Force and White House, was accused by his co-workers of stealing source code and hardware, 
including "nine 'secret' hard drives" that they alleged had classified national defense information of Predator drone 
footage used by the company Montgomery co-founded, called eTreppid, to develop software for use in the war on 
terror. According to the article, the FBI then started to investigate Montgomery based on the claims he had 
classified documents. In 2006 the FBI, IRS, and Drug Enforcement Administration raided his home in Reno, where, 
according to a lawsuit filed with his wife Brenda in federal court in 2021, claimed federal law enforcement lied to 
and threatened his kids, and that the raid was based on a false affidavit that violated his constitutional rights. 
Montgomery's suit was brought against both specifically one of the FBI agents involved in the raid, and other 
federal law enforcement agents. Dennis Montgomery was given the moniker "the man who conned the Pentagon" 
by Playboy because of his involvement in schemes to convince the George W. Bush administration and the national 
security apparatus to take action to prevent elaborate conspiracy theories. 
FBI Holds Shooter Response Training in Massachusetts 
The Provincetown Independent (06/05, Benson) reported that almost 160 people, including many of 
Provincetown's nightclub owners, bar managers, and hotel and restaurant staff, came to town hall on June 3 for an 
unusual kind of civic meeting: an "Active Shooter Attack Prevention and Preparedness" training session given by FBI 
agents from offices in New York City, Boston, and Lakeville. The article added that the session was organized in the 
wake of a May 10 alert from the FBI and Dept. of Homeland Security on a "heightened threat environment" from 
"foreign terrorist organizations and their supporters" against LGBTQ gatherings and venues, especially during Pride 
celebrations in June. According to the article, Special Agent Michael Grecco Jr., came from the FBI's New York field 
office to deliver the attack prevention training. He also walked through 10 Provincetown venues on June 3 and 4 to 
help them assess their safety plans. The article quoted Grecco, who said, "We talked about their security plans, 
their exits, their medical response plans, we don't tell people what to do, but we do have a conversation about best 
practices."
