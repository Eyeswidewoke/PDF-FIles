on the release of the documents if it passes both chambers. The New York Times (11/14, Broadwater, Cameron) 
reported that President Trump has withdrawn his support and endorsement of Representative Marjorie Taylor 
Greene, calling her "wacky" and a "disgrace" after she broke ranks with him on several issues. Trump issued a not-
so-veiled threat about her seat in Congress. "I understand that wonderful, Conservative people are thinking about 
primarying Marjorie in her District of Georgia, that they too are fed up with her and her antics and, if the right 
person runs, they will have my Complete and Unyielding Support," he wrote. "She has gone Far Left, even doing 
The View, with their Low IQ Republican hating Anchors." Greene quickly shot back with her own post. "President 
Trump just attacked me and lied about me," she wrote on X, where she published a text message she said she had 
sent to the president asking him to "lean into" the Epstein investigation. "I haven't called him at all, but I did send 
these text messages today. Apparently this is what sent him over the edge. The Epstein ffies." Additional reporting

FBI Arrests Suspect In Attack on US Attorney Alina Habba's New Jersey Office 
Fox News (11/15, Norman, McAdams) reported that the FBI has arrested Keith Michael Lisa, the suspect wanted in 
connection with the attack on US Attorney Alina Habba's office in New Jersey. Lisa was charged with possession of 
a dangerous weapon in a federal facility and depredation of federal property after allegedly entering the office with 
a bat and damaging government property. The arrest was made possible through a joint effort by the FBI, US 
Marshals Service, and Homeland Security Investigations, with authorities stating that they will not tolerate acts of 
intimidation or violence toward law enforcement. "Today's arrest shows what coordinated federal law enforcement 
can do. Threats against our U.S. Attorneys aren't just attacks on individuals, they're attacks on the rule of law. And 
we will respond every time," Director Patel wrote on X. The article noted that AG Bondi announced Thursday that 
an individual had attempted to confront Habba on Wednesday night, "destroyed property in her office" and then 
"fled the scene." She added, "Thankfully, Alina is ok. Any violence or threats of violence against any federal officer 
will not be tolerated. Period. This is unfortunately becoming a trend as radicals continue to attack law enforcement 
agents around the country." Additional reporting on the story was provided by Associated Press (11/15, Staff

Trump Pardons Woman Convicted of Threatening to Shoot FBI Agents and Jan. 6 Rioter 
Associated Press (11/15, Richer, Mergerian) reported that President Donald Trump issued two new pardons 
connected to the Jan. 6 investigation, including one for Suzanne Ellen Kaye, who was convicted of threatening to 
shoot FBI agents after they contacted her in 2021 about a tip suggesting she might have been at the Capitol. In 
describing her case, the article detailed that Kaye posted a video threatening FBI agents, later testified she never 
intended the threat, and told authorities she was not at the Capitol. According to the article, Trump also pardoned 
Daniel Edwin Wilson, whose home was searched during the Jan. 6 probe, leading the FBI and other authorities to 
discover six guns and thousands of rounds of ammunition despite his prior felony convictions. The article also 
recounted prosecutors' claims that Wilson communicated with far-right groups, planned for the riot, and sent 
messages suggesting he envisioned a broader civil conflict. The article noted that both pardons came amid disputes 
over how far Trump's Jan. 6 clemency extends, and that a Trump-appointed judge criticized shifting Justice 
Department positions regarding whether the president's earlier pardons covered Wilson's firearms offense.
