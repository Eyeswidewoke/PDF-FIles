Although a money market mutual fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in a money market mutual fund. Shares of a money 
market mutual fund or the balance of a bank deposit product held in your brokerage account may be liquidated upon request with the proceeds credited to your brokerage account. Please see the 
money market mutual fund's prospectus or the bank deposit product's disclosure document or contact your advisor for additional information.
