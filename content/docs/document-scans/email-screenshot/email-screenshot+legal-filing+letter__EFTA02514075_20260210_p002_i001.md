complex beyond our comprehension. Like the =nimate trees, stones, rivers and homes, maybe algorithms running on 
=omputers are just another part of this complex ecosystem. 
As human beings we have evolved to have an ego and believe that there =uch a thing as a self, but mostly, that's a self-
deception to =Ilow each human unit to work within the parameters of evolutionary =ynamics in a useful way. Perhaps 
the morality that emerges from it is a =elf-deception of sorts, as well. For all we know, we might just be =lying in a 
simulation where nothing really actually matters. It =oesn't mean we shouldn't have ethics and good taste. I =ust think 
we can exercise our sense of responsibility in being part of = complex and interconnected system without having to rely 
on an =rgument that "I am special." As machines become an increasingly =mportant part of these systems, their 
prominence will make human =rguments about being special increasingly fraught. Maybe that's = GOOD THING. 
Perhaps what we think about machines that think doesn't really =atter — they will "think" and the system will =dapt. As 
with most complex systems, the outcome is mostly =npredictable. It is what it is and will be what it will be. Most of =hat 
we think is going to happen is probably hopelessly wrong and as we =now from climate change, knowing that something 
is happening and doing =omething about it often have little in common. 
That might sound extremely negative and defeatist, but I'm =ctually quite optimistic. I believe that the systems are quite 
adaptive =nd resilient and that whatever happens, beauty, happiness and fun will =ersist. Hopefully, human beings will 
have a role. My guess is that they =ill. 
It turns out that we don't make great robots, but we're =ery good at doing random and creative things that would be 
impossibly =omplex -- and probably a waste of resources -- to code into a machine. =deally, our educational system will 
evolve to more fully embrace our =niquely human strengths, rather than trying to shape us into =econd-rate machines. 
Human beings—though not necessarily our =urrent form of consciousness and the linear philosophy around it—=re 
quite good at transforming messiness and complexity into art, =ulture, and meaning. If we focus on what each of us is 
best at, I think =hat humans and machines will develop a wonderful yin-yang sort of =elationship, with humans feeding 
off of the efficiency of our =olid-state brethren, while they feed off of our messy, sloppy, =motional and creative bodies 
and brains. 
We are descending not into chaos, as many believe, but into complexity. =t the same time that the Internet connects 
everything outside of us =nto a vast, seemingly unmanageable system, we find an almost infinite =mount of complexity 
as we dig deeper inside our own biology. Much as =e're convinced that our brains run the show, all while our 
=icrobiomes alter our drives, desires, and behaviors to support their =wn reproduction and evolution, it may never be 
clear who's in =harge—us, or our machines. But maybe we've done more =amage by believing that humans are special 
than we possibly could by =mbracing a more humble relationship with the other creatures, objects, =nd machines 
around us.
