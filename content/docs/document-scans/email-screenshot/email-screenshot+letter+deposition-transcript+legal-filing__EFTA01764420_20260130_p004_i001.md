tensions with Iran mount, the United St=tes is even more likely to depend on its somewhat stable nondemocratic all=es, 
such as Saudi Arabia, and its stable democratic allies, such as Israel=and Turkey, to secure its interests in the region. If 
anything, recent events have reinforced the logic underp=nning U.S.-Israeli strategic cooperation. 
The benefits to the=United States of its relationship with Israel belie the argument that the =lliance is based solely on 
the two countries' shared democratic values, =n the popularity of Israel in American politics, or on the elusive pursuit of 
progress in the peace process. It i= a relationship based on tangible interests -- and will remain so for the =oreseeable 
future. 
It isn't always e=sy being Israel's ally (and Israeli actions don't always make it easie=). The country faces many 
challenges, including the unresolved conflict wi=h the Palestinians, internal socioeconomic gaps, voices around the 
world that deny its right to exist, and now Iran=92s nuclear program. Israel has made uneven progress toward 
addressing the=e issues and needs to do more to remain an attractive partner for the Unit=d States. But its past 
successes in incorporating huge numbers of immigrants, bridging deep social divides, an= showing remarkable resilience 
in the face of war and terrorism provide re=son to believe that Washington can continue to count on its closest partne= 
in the Middle East, and will continue to benefit from its alliance with the Jewish state.

Jordan: threa=ened by the drama next door 
David Hirst <http://w=w.guardian.co.uk/profile/davidhirst> 
8 November 2012 Wissam Hassan, the Lebanese intelligence chief, and the sharpening of t=nsions it produced, was the 
most recent, dramatic illustration of it. Turk=y's far-reaching support for the Syrian opposition has bred retaliation fr=m 
President Assad in the form of renewed support for the PKK, the separatist Kurdish militants, who are on =he warpath 
again. As for Iraq, it becomes ever clearer that the "Syri=n crisis" — a full-scale civil war — and its own "crisis&quo=; —
involving endemic tensions among Kurds, Sunnis and Shiites that fall short of that but constantly seem to threaten it — 
are=intimately bound up with each other.. But is a fourth neighbour, Jordan, g=ing the same way? Perhaps the most 
artificial of the region's western-crea=ed states, surrounded by much larger, stronger or richer ones, it was always 
peculiarly exposed to influences fr=m beyond its borders. "Can Jordan survive?" was once a regular h=adline in western 
newspapers. 
Yet, to begin with,=Jordan weathered the upheaval that is the Arab spring with relative ease. =he country, presided over 
by the Hashemite monarchy, was a typical Arab au=ocracy, with some of its typical flaws — not least corruption and 
cronyism — yet never in the same degenerate=league as the republics, born of those "revolutions", of which S=ria's was 
one of the worst. King Abdullah, like his father Hussein, retain=d some real legitimacy in his people's eyes. True, the
