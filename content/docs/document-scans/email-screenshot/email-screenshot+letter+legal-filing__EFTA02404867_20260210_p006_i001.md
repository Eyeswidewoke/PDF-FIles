Given—as several Israelis who have been senior figures in the-country's security establishment have noted—that an 
Iranian nuclear weap=n would not pose an existential threat to Israel, one has to look to other reasons for the Israeli 
agitation about t=e Iranian nuclear program. Besides Netanyahu's personal obsession, there a=e the broader Israeli fears 
and emotions, the desire to maintain a regiona= nuclear-weapons monopoly and the distraction that the Iran issue 
provides from outside attention to the Pal=stinians' lack of popular sovereignty. Columnist Richard Cohen, in a piece last 
week <http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/strike-on-iran-could-buy-=srael-needed-time-in-
mideast/2012/03/19/gIQAim44NS_story.html> [4) that is clearly sy=pathetic to Israel, mentions one more reason: a 
desire to stem a brain dra=n to the United States of Israelis who would rather live in a more secure =lace. Clearly there is 
no congruence with U.S. interests here. In fact, taking in the talent that is found amon= the Israeli émigrés is a net plus 
for the United States and the =S. economy. 
The Iranian nuclear issue only reconfirms the noncongruence of =S. and Israeli interests that should have been apparent 
from other issues= Most of those issues revolve around the continued Israeli occupation and colonization of disputed 
land inhabit=d by Palestinians. The United States has no positive interest in Israel cl=nging to that land—only the 
negative interest involving the opprobrium a=d anger directed at it for being so closely associated with Israeli policies 
and actions. Another reminder =f the lonely position in which the United States finds itself almost every=time it 
automatically condones Israeli behavior came last week, when the United Nations Human Rights Council voted 
chttp://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/24/world/middleeast/israeli-offic=als-denounce-move-by-united-nations-human-
rights-council-to-investigate-se=tlements-affect-on-palestinian-
rights.html?scp=3&sq=United%20Natio=s%20Human%20Rights&st=cse> [5) for an inquiry into how Israeli settlements 
in the occupied terri=ories affect the rights of Palestinians. Initiation of the inquiry was app=oved with thirty-six votes in 
favor, ten abstentions and a single no vote by the United States. 
If the United States escapes a war with Iran by achieving succe=s in negotiations (which Netanyahu and his government 
have in effect denou=ced and have helped to subvert by waging a covert war against Iran), Americans ought to reflect 
on how close they c=me to disaster by following the man who thinks he is King David. If it doe= not escape a war, it will 
be hard to find any silver lining in the conseq=ences. But perhaps one would be that Americans would then be more 
likely to understand how contrary to the=r own interests it has been to follow the preferences of the Israeli gover=ment. 
Perhaps that could be a first step toward a more normal—and more b=neficial for the United States—U.S. relationship 
with Israel.
