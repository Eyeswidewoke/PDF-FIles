attacks." The assessment is "consistent with intelligence officials' warning to lawmakers in 
January that Russia was interfering on Mr. Trump's behalf, a briefing that outraged Republicans 
and eventually helped oust Joseph Maguire from his post as acting director of national 
intelligence." 
The New York Times (9/22, Sanger, Kanno-Youngs, 18.61M) reports separately that "four 
years ago, when Russian intelligence agencies engaged in a systematic attempt to influence the 
American presidential election, the disinformation they fed American voters required some real 
imagination at the troll farms producing the ads." This year, however, they are "largely 
amplifying misleading statements from President Trump, mostly about the dangers of mail-in 
ballots." 
Cuccinelli: "No Meaningful Effort" On Election Interference. Acting Deputy DHS 
Secretary Ken Cuccinelli said on WILS 1320 (9/22) that "we've been very well-positioned. You 
compare where we are now in this presidential election with four years ago, we are working 
with all 50 Secretaries of State, regardless of party. Four years ago, they were working with 
about a third of them." Cuccinelli said, "It's a totally transformed environment, we have much 
better surveillance, and on the cyber side, in particular, which is where the federal responsibility 
lies, we have a high degree of confidence that up to this point, there has been no meaningful 
effort to penetrate election systems." 
NYTimes: Putin Must Be Held Accountable For Navalny Poisoning. The New York 
Times (9/22, 18.61M) editorializes, "It is now an established fact...that Alexei Navalny was 
poisoned with Novichok, a nerve agent developed by the Soviet Union." But in "the face of 
Kremlin stonewalling, many questions remain unanswered and are likely to remain so." Still, the 
Times argues that as President Vladimir Putin "looks intent on spending the rest of his life at 
Russia's helm and displays ever less concern for human rights or the rule of law, it is incumbent 
on the West to hold him accountable for murdering or trying to murder anyone he finds 
troublesome." 
India Cites Progress Made In Military Talks With China. 
The AP (9/22, Hussain) reports, "Senior Indian and Chinese military commanders have agreed 
to stop the further buildup of troops along their fast-militarizing disputed border in the 
mountainous Ladakh region where the two Asian giants have for months been locked in a bitter 
standoff, the Indian military said late Tuesday." In a statement, India's defense ministry said 
the two sides have also agreed to "strengthen communication on the ground" and "avoid 
misunderstandings and misjudgments" along the contested border. 
US Ambassador To Netherlands Draws Controversy Over Partisan Event. 
Politico Europe (9/22, 8K) reports that Pete Hoekstra, the US Ambassador to the Netherlands, 
"has been accused of interfering in national politics after hosting an event for the far-right 
Forum for Democracy party." The event, held at the American Embassy in Wassenaar on 
September 10, "featured between 30 and 40 'party officials and wealthy entrepreneurs." 
According to Politico, "other political parties, including Prime Minister Mark Rutte's VVD, have 
raised questions about the event and whether it should have been allowed." However, Dutch 
Trade Minister Sigrid Kaag "said the government had contacted the US Embassy and was told 
that invitations had been sent to all political parties." 
The Washington Post (9/22, Taylor, 14.2M) reports Dutch officials "demanded answers" 
from Hoekstra. The State Department "did not immediately respond to a request for comment," 
but "US officials told the Dutch media that the proceeding was nothing out of the ordinary."
