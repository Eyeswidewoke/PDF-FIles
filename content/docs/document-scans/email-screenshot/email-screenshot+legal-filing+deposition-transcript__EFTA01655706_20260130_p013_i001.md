FBI Daily News Briefing 
Continued Reporting: Atlanta Family in Mistaken FBI Raid Gets Case Before U.S. Supreme Court 
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution (01/30, Manins) reported that an Atlanta family who say they were traumatized 
by armed FBI agents in an accidental predawn raid on their house have persuaded the U.S. Supreme Court to 
consider whether their lawsuit against the federal government can proceed. Trina Martin, her then-partner Toi 
Cliatt, and her son Gabe Watson allege they were startled awake just before 5 a.m. on Oct. 18, 2017, when a six-
agent SWAT team busted down their front door, set off a flashbang grenade in their home entryway and pointed 
guns at them before realizing they had the wrong address. The article mentioned that the target was allegedly a 
violent gang member reportedly living a block away, case records show. Martin, Cliatt and Watson said they got an 
apology from the FBI agent who led the raid but were left with lasting trauma. In case filings, the federal 
government said the lead FBI agent had relied on a GPS device to find the target home in the dark, and later told 
Martin and Cliatt the FBI would cover the damage to their property. The federal government asked the Supreme 
Court to reject the family's attempt to revive the case. On Monday, the Supreme Court granted the family's request 
to review the case. Patrick Jaicomo, an attorney representing the family, said the court's final say will have 
implications for cases nationwide alleging wrongful actions by federal employees and law enforcement officers in 
particular. 
Special Agent in Charge Ashley T. Johnson Leads FBI St. Louis 
The St. Louis American (01/30, Brown) reported that if not for the old Matlock television series, Ashley T. Johnson 
may not have become the first Black female and first-ever woman to oversee the local FBI office. In October, former 
FBI Director Wray appointed Johnson as Special Agent in Charge of the St. Louis Field Office. According to the 
article, in an interview with the St. Louis American, Johnson chuckled as she admitted it was Matlock, which 
premiered in the late 1980s, starring the ever-affable Andy Griffith, that drew her into the arena of law 
enforcement. "I'd literally come inside from playing at 3 o'clock just to watch Matlock and all my friends would 
tease me and, until this day, I watch it whenever it's on." Johnson, who described herself as an "inquisitive child," 
explained what drew her to the TV show: "It was the investigative side of it. I was always intrigued how they put 
the pieces of the puzzle together, how they followed mysteries." The article stated that when asked about negative 
aspects attributes of the FBI's history -such as its 1950s and '60s-era COINTELPRO program that targeted, among 
others, Black civil rights leaders, and anti-war opponents or scandalous charges of sexism within the agency, 
Johnson's answers were matter of fact, without antisepsis or delusion. The article noted that Johnson credited and 
restated former FBI Wray's candid acknowledgement of the FBI's misdeeds in the past, adding that her position is a 
positive step in avoiding misdeeds of the future. 
Jan. 6 Rioter Pardoned by Trump Is Sentenced to 10 Years in Deadly DWI Crash 
NBC News (01/30, Helsel) reported that a Missouri woman convicted in the Jan. 6 Capitol riot and recently 
pardoned by President Donald Trump was sentenced to 10 years this week for killing a mother of two in a drunken-
driving crash. Emily Hernandez was seen holding the broken nameplate of then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, (D-
CA) after the mob of Trump supporters attacked the Capitol in 2021. She served 30 days in federal prison and was 
released. On Wednesday, she was sentenced in Missouri state court to 10 years in prison for a 2022 drunken-
driving crash that killed Victoria Wilson and seriously injured her husband, Ryan Wilson, court records show. The 
article mentioned that Hernandez, 24, pleaded guilty on Nov. 5 to one count of driving while intoxicated in which a 
person died, and another count of DWI in which a person was seriously injured. Hernandez was driving the wrong 
way on an interstate in Missouri on Jan. 5, 2022, when she crashed into a car with Victoria and Ryan Wilson, a 
couple out celebrating their 15th wedding anniversary. Newsweek (01/30, Clark), Huffington Post (01/30, 
Neammanee), and USA TODAY (01/30, Hauari) also reported on the story.
