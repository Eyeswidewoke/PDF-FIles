Trump: Wray Has Been "Disappointing" As FBI Director. 
President Trump was asked in an interview on Fox Business' Mornings With Maria (10/8) if he 
will replace FBI Director Wray if he is reelected. Trump said, "I don't want to say that yet. He 
has been disappointing." 
CBS News (10/8, Segers, 3.68M) reports that President Trump called Director Wray 
"disappointing" on Thursday, "criticizing him for not doing more to investigate voter fraud, after 
Wray said there is no evidence of any coordinated fraud ahead of the election. `He's been 
disappointing,' Mr. Trump said about Wray in an interview with Fox Business anchor Maria 
Bartiromo. 'He doesn't see the voting ballots as a problem." Wray "testified before Congress 
two weeks ago that the bureau has `not seen, historically, any kind of coordinated national 
voter fraud effort in a major election, whether it's by mail or otherwise:" Trump "declined to say 
whether he would replace Wray, whom he nominated in 2017, if elected to a second term." 
The Washington Times (10/8, Mordock, 492K) reports, "Trump hardly offered a ringing 
endorsement of the FBI director he appointed in 2017. But he stopped short of saying he would 
ax Mr. Wray. 'I don't want to say [whether Mr. Wray will be fired] yet,' Mr. Trump said in the 
interview. 'He has been disappointing. He talks about, you know, even the voting thing that he 
doesn't see the voting ballots as a problem. There are thousands of ballots right there. You pick 
up any paper in the country, practically, and they're cheating all over the place on ballots. How 
is that not a problem? That's a much bigger problem than China or Russia if you look at it,' Mr. 
Trump continued. 'It's a much bigger problem. So, you know, when you say that "Oh, I don't 
see that as a problem," pick up the newspaper and read.'"
