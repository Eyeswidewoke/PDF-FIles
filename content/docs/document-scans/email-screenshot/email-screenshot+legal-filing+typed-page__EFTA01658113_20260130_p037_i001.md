coronavirus-related stimulus measures, writing that the House wants to rush through at least 
$1 trillion in new spending without any accountability. The Wall Street Journal (7/23, 
Subscription Publication, 7.57M) similarly says in an editorial that the economy is strong and 
additional stimulus will harm, not hurt, further recovery. Bloomberg (7/23, Davison, Litvan, 
4.73M), the Wall Street Journal (7/23, Restuccia, Duehren, Subscription Publication, 7.57M), 
The Hill (7/23, Carney, 2.98M), and CQ Roll Call (7/23, Krawzak, 154K), among other sources, 
also have reports. 
Meatpacking Workers Sue OSHA For Allegedly Failing To Keep Them Safe. 
The Washington Post (7/23, Rosenberg, 14.2M) reports a lawsuit filed Thursday by three 
meatpacking workers says OSHA "is failing to do its job properly." The plaintiffs accuse OSHA 
"of leaving the workers in imminent danger due to what they say are hazardous working 
conditions at the factory they work at, run by Maid-Rite Specialty Foods in Pennsylvania, in the 
midst of the coronavirus pandemic." 
Officials Acknowledge DHS Made False Statements In Fight With New York. 
The New York Times (7/23, Shanahan, 18.61M) reports DHS officials "made false statements in 
a bid to justify expelling New York residents from programs that let United States travelers 
speed through borders and airport lines, federal government lawyers admitted on Thursday." 
The "surprise" admission, contained in a court filing, said the inaccuracies "undermine a central 
argument" in the Trump Administration's case "for barring New Yorkers from the programs after 
the state passed a law enabling undocumented immigrants to get driver's licenses." 
DACA Recipient Accused Of Killing Three In DUI. 
The Washington Times (7/23, Dinan, 492K) reports that an undocumented immigrant "who 
stands accused of killing three motorcyclists in a drunken-driving crash last week in Texas was 
once a 'Dreamer,' approved for the Obama-era DACA deportation amnesty in 2013, and 
protected from removal in 2016 despite another drunken-driving arrest." Ivan Robles Navejas 
was awarded DACA status in 2013, "about the same time he was charged with resisting arrest, 
but his status lapsed two years later," according to ICE. 
Delay Sought In Release Of Documentary Film Examining Trump's Immigration 
Crackdown. 
The New York Times (7/23, Al, Dickerson, 18.61M) reports on a new documentary that "peers 
inside the secretive world of immigration enforcement." The filmmakers, however, have "faced 
demands to delete scenes and delay broadcast until after the election." According to the Times, 
"some of the contentious scenes include ICE officers lying to immigrants to gain access to their 
homes and mocking them after taking them into custody." Another "shows an officer illegally 
picking the lock to an apartment building during a raid." 
Senate Passes Defense Bill With Veto-Proof Majority. 
Axios (7/23, Ayesh, 521K) reports the Senate on Thursday "passed the National Defense 
Authorization Act on Thursday on an 86-14 vote," including an amendment that "calls for 10 
military bases honoring the Confederacy to be renamed, which President Trump greatly 
opposes." The Washington Post (7/23, Demirjian, 14.2M) calls the vote "the latest sign that 
Congress is undeterred by...Trump's" veto threat, and USA Today (7/23, Wu, 10.31M) and 
Politico (7/23, O'Brien, 4.29M) describe lawmakers as "defying" Trump. The Hill (7/23, Carney, 
2.98M) cautions, however, that "senators could flip their votes on a potential override." 
Fox News (7/23, O'Reilly, 27.59M) recounts on its website that "the House earlier this 
week passed its own version of the defense bill earlier this week - also by a veto-proof margin," 
and now "both chambers of Congress must...hash out a unified version of the bill and pass it 
again, which most likely will not occur until the fall." Reuters (7/23, Zengerle) also says the
