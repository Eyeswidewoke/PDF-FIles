of inequality and m=de economic gains as a consequence. So, what do other countries have to learn from France,

How much money do you have to make to be rich?=span style="font-family:Georgia,seritfont-size:12pt;line-
height:107%">=C2*This is a question that people ask all of the time and in a Huffington Post article last month by 
David Sirota — That's rich! Why=so many wealthy Americans think they're middle class — based on recent remarks=from 
Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, to me it got more confusing instead of helping shed lig=t on a troubling phenomenon. 
Because according to Treasury Secretary Jack Lew's reckoning, being a milli=naire does not constitute living high above 
the ranks of ordinary people. =/span>Lew said that back when he was in the private sector enjoying six- and seven-
figure pay packages, "My own comp=nsation was never in the stratosphere." Lew made that pro=ouncement as he 
sought to defend President Barack Obama's embattled Treasury undersecretar= nominee Antonio Weiss from charges 
that as a financial executive, he is out of touc= with the interests of regular people. Lew was seeking to cast his own lot 
w=th the ranks of ordinary Americans at a time of growing economic inequality.</=pan> 
But in doing so, Lew shed light on a uniquely America= phenomenon — the tendency of extraordinarily rich people to 
cast th=mselves as everyday members of the middle class. Earlier this year, for example, Hillary Clinton made headlines 
when, in response to=a question about her personal fortune, she claimed her family was Q=9Cdead broke" when they 
left the White House. That statement followed New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo's top aide casting those making 
$500,000 a year as merely upper middle class. According =o IRS data, 99 percent of American households make less 
than $388,000 a year, and 95 percent make less than $167,000 a year. The true middle in terms of income — that is, the 
cutoff to be in the top 50 percent o= earners — is roughly $35,000 a year. 
While Lew claims his private-sector compensation was =ot "in the stratosphere," the data suggest otherwise. According 
to New York University records, Lew was usually paid between $700,000 and $800,000 a year as the school's vice 
president, while =lso receiving a $440,000 mortgage subsidy. Lew also earned $300,000 a yea= from Citigroup, with a 
"guaranteed incentive and retention award of not less than $1 million," according to =n employment agreement 
obtained by Businessweek. That agreement said that the seven-figure award would be terminated if he left for another 
job, but with one exception: He would indeed get the ca=h if he accepted "a full-time high-level position with the United 
States government or regulatory body.". Lew was given a $940,000 bonus from Citigroup in the same week the bank 
received a $300 billion bailout from the federal government.
