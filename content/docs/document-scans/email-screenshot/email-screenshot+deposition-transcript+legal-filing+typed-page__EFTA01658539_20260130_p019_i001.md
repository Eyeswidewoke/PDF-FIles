Liptak, 83.16M) and Fox News (10/19, Singman, 27.59M) websites, and Axios (10/19, 
Fernandez, 521K) also have reports. 
WPost Report: Atlas "Succeeded In Largely Sidelining" Other Task Force Members. 
Under the headline "Trump's Den Of Dissent: Inside The White House Task Force As Coronavirus 
Surges," the Washington Post (10/19, Abutaleb, Rucker, Dawsey, Costa, 14.2M) reports, "As 
summer faded into autumn and the novel coronavirus continued to ravage the nation unabated, 
Scott Atlas, a neuroradiologist whose commentary on Fox News led President Trump to recruit 
him to the White House, consolidated his power over the government's pandemic response." 
According to the Post, Atlas "shot down attempts to expand testing" and "openly feuded with 
other doctors on the coronavirus task force." The Post says Atlas "succeeded in largely 
sidelining them," and then "advanced fringe theories, such as that social distancing and mask-
wearing were meaningless and would not have changed the course of the virus in several hard-
hit areas." 
The New York Times (10/19, Wu, 18.61M) reports that a tweet by Atlas on Saturday 
questioning the efficacy of masks in containing coronavirus "was rapidly debunked by experts, 
who pointed to a wealth of evidence showing that face coverings reduce the risk that the 
coronavirus will hop from person to person." According to the Times, "Not long after, Dr. Atlas 
reshared his first tweet with a message that seemed to walk back his original statement: 'Use 
masks for their intended purpose - when close to others especially hi risk,' he said. 'Otherwise, 
social distance. No widespread mandates." On Sunday, "Twitter removed Dr. Atlas's first tweet, 
saying it violated the company's policy against false or misleading information about the 
coronavirus that could lead to harm." However, "the damage had already been done: The post 
had been retweeted at least 1,800 times, and generated over 7,300 likes and replies. The 
removal then set off a flurry of anti-mask posts, and accusations of tech censorship, across 
social media." 
Atlas Praises "Herd Immunity" Declaration, Though Other Experts Alarmed By 
Idea. The New York Times (10/19, Eddy, Pianigiani, Schaverien, Zraick, Gillet, 18.61M) 
reports Atlas and other Administration officials have praised ideas in a declaration by fellow 
Stanford University professor Jay Bhattacharya that "calls for allowing the coronavirus to spread 
in order to achieve 'herd immunity' - the point at which enough people have been infected to 
stall transmission of the pathogen." The "central proposition is that to contain the coronavirus, 
people 'who are not vulnerable should immediately be allowed to resume life as normal' while 
those at high risk are protected from infection." According to the Times, the idea "has alarmed 
and angered other public health researchers," and "on Wednesday, about 80 published a 
manifesto of their own...saying that this approach would endanger one-third of the US 
population who have conditions that put them at high risk from severe Covid-19, and result in 
perhaps a half-million deaths." 
In an op-ed for the New York Times (10/19, 18.61M), Tulane University School of Public 
Health professor John Barry argues, "Even if herd immunity can be achieved with only 40 
percent of the population infected or vaccinated," the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation 
at the University of Washington "estimates that a total of 800,000 Americans would die," and 
"the real death toll needed to reach herd immunity could far exceed one million." Moreover, "as 
horrific a price as that is, it could prove much worse if damage to the heart, lungs or other 
organs of those who recover from the immediate effects of the virus does not heal and instead 
leads to early deaths or incapacitation. But we won't know that for years." 
GAO To Investigate Administration's Influence Over CDC, FDA. 
USA Today (10/19, Behrmann, 10.31M) reports the Government Accountability Office (GAO) 
"has agreed to investigate alleged political influence from the Trump administration over the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration." The 
independent legislative agency "accepted a Senate request on Monday to examine potential
