argued that the idea that there is an "epidemic" of police shooting unarmed Black men is 
"simply a false narrative." Barr said, "I did say that I do think that there appears to be a 
phenomenon in the country where African Americans feel that they're treated, when they're 
stopped by police, frequently, as suspects before they are treated as citizens. I don't think that 
that necessarily reflects some deep-seated racism in police departments or in most police 
officers. I think the same kind of behavior is done by African American police officers." 
Administration Officials Criticize Portland Mayor's Handling Of Violence. 
Acting Deputy DHS Secretary Ken Cuccinelli said on Fox Business' Varney & Co. (9/2, 64K), 
"The first responsibility in these communities is state and local for policing, but we're seeing 
Portland intentionally not, and willfully, not police to the extent needed to stop the violence. You 
compare it to Kenosha. We saw the formula for a quick stop to violence and that was with a 
Democrat mayor and a Democrat governor. Partisanship shouldn't have anything to do with 
this. This is straight law enforcement." 
Acting CBP Commissioner Morgan said on Fox News' Bill Hemmer Reports that Portland 
Mayor Ted Wheeler's "solution is to sit back and burn itself out. Literally that's what has 
happened. The city will burn itself to the ground. That's his strategy. It's outrageous and absurd 
and putting politics above public safety." 
Acting DHS Secretary Wolf said on Fox News' Daily Briefing (9/2) that "we see some 
District Attorneys taking a very strange approach and posture" to charging protesters. He said, 
"For instance, the District Attorney in Portland has advertised a series of crimes that he's not 
going to prosecute, and that involves interfering with a law enforcement officer, I would say, 
criminal trespassing, and others. And that sets a very dangerous precedent, it fosters this 
environment that the violence is okay, and it draws people to those communities." 
Barn At Some Point, Federal Government Has To Step In. Attorney General Barr 
said on CNNVi (9/2, 2.25M) that "what we're trying to do is make clear that it's the state's 
responsibility and the locality to provide protection. If they are unable or unwilling to do that, at 
some point, things could reach a state where the federal government has to step in." He said, 
"It's very easy to maintain peace in these cities, in any city where the mayor backs the police, 
the police chief is doing his job, and the governor's willing to provide backup support, there will 
be peace on the streets and there has been peace on the streets." 
Portland Mayor Moving After Rioters Target His Condo Complex. The Washington 
Free Beacon (9/2, Nester, 78K) reports Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler (D) said Tuesday that he 
intends to move "after anti-police rioters repeatedly targeted" his condominium complex. The 
announcement comes after "a massive demonstration outside of the 114-unit high-rise on 
Monday, where more than 200 rioters gathered around the building, vandalized it with spray 
paint, and threw burning objects inside." In an email to his neighbors, Wheeler wrote, "I want 
to express my sincere apologies for the damage to our home and the fear that you are 
experiencing due to my position. ... It's unfair to all of you who have no role in politics or in my 
administration." Breitbart (9/2, Bleau, 673K) provides similar coverage of Wheeler's 
announcement. 
President Trump reacted to Wheeler's announcement in a tweet Wednesday afternoon. 
Trump wrote, "Mayor Wheeler just got harassed out of his own home in Portland by so-called 
'friendly protesters'. The Anarchists, Agitators and Looters treat him HORRIBLY, even though he 
is so nice and respectful to them. Criminals only understand strength!" 
Federal Prosecutors Charge Portland Man For Ramming Federal Officers With 
SUV. The Washington Times (9/2, Dinan, 492K) reports federal prosecutors have announced 
charges against Lonnie Vantewa Albert, "a Portland man they say targeted federal police 
officers for an attack, smashing his SUV into their vehicle then trying to run them down." The 
officers "were on their way back to their hotel early Sunday when they say an SUV began 
hounding them in their rental car. The SUV tried to block them in, and as they swerved, it 
smashed them, spinning out in the process. When one of the officers got out to check for
