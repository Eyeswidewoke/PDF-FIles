and deputies conducted a traffic stop. During the traffic stop, the family members refused to comply with the 
deputies' instructions and engaged in a physical altercation with both the deputies and Spinale, who remained in 
the area. 61-year-old Harold Chamberlain, Jr., a Stafford resident, heard the commotion in front of his home and

Social Media Creator Says FBI Knocked On Her Grandmother's Door After Failed Crypto Launch 
Forbes (05/20, Murray) reported that Haliey Welch, the internet creator best known for her viral meme, addressed 
her controversial failed cryptocurrency coin launch for the first time on an episode of her podcast Tuesday, stating 
the FBI and SEC both approached her to investigate after the value of her coin inflated and immediately crashed, 
though she denied wrongdoing. According to the article, Welch denied responsibility in the sudden crash of her 
Hawk Tuah coin and denied she intended to scam her followers, stating she "trusted the wrong people." The article 
added that once the coin crashed in December after reaching a high of $500 million in market capitalization value, 
Welch said the FBI knocked on the door of her grandmother's house, asked Welch questions and investigated her 
phone, after which Welch said the investigation was picked up by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which 
she says also examined her phone. Welch said the agencies cleared her of wrongdoing, and she said she was not 
named in any lawsuits in the aftermath of the coin crash. The New York Post (05/20, Kaplan), and Hollywood 
Reporter (05/20, Gajewski) also reported on the story. 
Three White Supremacists Sentenced to Prison for Racketeering Conspiracy; Two to Serve Life In Prison 
for Murder 
CBS News (05/20, Castaneda) reported that three white supremacists and members of the Aryan Brotherhood 
prison gang were sentenced to federal prison Monday after being convicted of ordering multiple murders while 
serving time in the California prison system, authorities said. According to the article, a federal judge in Fresno 
sentenced Francis Clement, 58, to life in prison for a racketeering conspiracy that included five murders, drug 
trafficking, fraud, and robbery, according to a press statement from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern 
District of California. The article added that each of the murders in Los Angeles County occurred when Clement was 
in state prison, the U.S. Attorney's Office said. Clement was convicted in February along with Kenneth Johnson, 63, 
who was convicted of two of the murders in the aid of racketeering, along with conspiracy. Johnson was also 
sentenced to life in federal prison, where there is no parole. The article mentioned that in addition, John Stinson, 
70, who was also serving a lengthy sentence in the California state prison system, was sentenced to 20 years in 
federal custody, the press statement said. He was already serving a life sentence for a 1979 murder, and court 
documents indicated Clement and Johnson held leadership roles in the Aryan Brotherhood and directed crimes by 
gang members inside and outside of prison using smuggled cellphones. Prosecutors said Johnson and Clement 
together ordered the killings between 2020 and 2022 because they believed their victims either violated gang rules 
or owed the gang money. A DOJ press release noted that the case was investigated under the Organized Crime 
Drug Enforcement Task Forces (OCDETF). OCDETF identifies, disrupts, and dismantles the highest-level criminal 
organizations that threaten the United States using a prosecutor-led, intelligence-driven, multi-agency approach.

Child Exploitation

and rescued over 100 children as part of a new FBI initiative dubbed "Operation Restore Justice." According to the

with National Child Abuse Prevention Month in April. The article quoted Akil Davis, assistant director of the FBI's 
Los Angeles Office, who said, "The amount of child predators arrested during Operation Restore Justice should 
shock the conscience of any law-abiding citizen and parents or guardians. Each day, our agents are tackling criminal 
allegations involving children, whether it be online dangers like sextortion, emerging nihilist extremist networks like 
764, or children being groomed by someone close to them." The Eagle (FM-100.9) (05/20, Holliday) also reported 
on the story.
