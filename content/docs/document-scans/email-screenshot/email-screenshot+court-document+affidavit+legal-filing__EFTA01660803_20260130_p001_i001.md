Director Patel Testifies Refore the Moose bulaclary Committee on rvitall 
Fox News (09/17, Oliver) and CNN (09/17, Blake) reported that Director Patel faced heated questioning in the House after a tense Senate 
hearing, with Republicans praising him for reforms they said ended "spying on parents at school board meetings" and pre-dawn raids on 
conservatives, while Democrats sharply criticized his handling of the Charlie Kirk assassination investigation, the firing of senior FBI officials, and 
the Jeffrey Epstein files. Director Patel defended releasing video of the Kirk suspect, saying, "It's important for this FBI to be transparent without 
Jeopardizing our investigation," though Democrats faulted him for initially tweeting the suspect was in custody before it was confirmed. On 
Epstein, Director Patel repeatedly resisted questions about Donald Trump's proximity to the files but did confirm one point when asked about 
alleged photos, stating, "No," there were none showing Trump with underage girls and adding, "Because that information would have been 
brought to light by multiple administrations and FBI investigators over the course of the last 20 years." Pressed on whether Epstein trafficked 
victims to others, Director Patel clarified, "Let me make something crystal clear: I never said Jeffrey Epstein didn't traffic other people, other 
women, and there are not other victims. This is the investigation we were given from 2006, '07, and '08, and the search warrants from 2006,'07, 
and '08. That's what we're working with: He also said, "We are also not in the habit of releasing incredible information. That's not what we do, 
but multiple authorities have looked at the entirety of what we have." At one point, responding to Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell's criticism, 
Director Patel shot back, "I'm going to borrow your terminology and call bullshit on your entire career in Congress because you've been a 
disgrace to the American people." The articles noted that when Rep. Jared Moskowitz pressed him on Trump's denial of the Epstein birthday 
letter, Director Patel agreed to an inquiry, saying, "Sure, I'll do it." The Washington Times (09/17, Dinan) added that Director Patel told Congress 
that the terrorism threat has shifted from the southern to the northern border, citing its "expansive" geography and saying, "The enemy has 
adapted... We need more focus on the northern border to stop known or suspected terrorists from coming in from places like China, Russia, the 
Middle East, Africa, Afghanistan: According to the article, Director Patel testified that the southern border has been largely sealed, with "almost 
zero" terrorism suspects encountered there recently, even as arrests of people on the FBI's Terrorist Screening Dataset have surged at official 
crossings after cartels were added to the terror watch list. The article noted that Director Patel also highlighted Russia, China, and Iran as top 
counterintelligence priorities, promising a review of data on Afghan evacuees flagged by U.S. intelligence and confirming a significant increase in 
FBI counterintelligence investigations involving those nations. Additional reporting on the story was provided by ABC News (09/17, Hensley, 
Barr), Associated Press (09/17, Tucker, Richer), Axlos (09/17, Rubin) (2), Bloomberg (09/17, Miller, Strohm), The Daily Beast (09/17, Fiallo),
