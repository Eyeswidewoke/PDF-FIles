man who fought and died in Syria for the Islamic State." Sedina Hodzic "also will be deported 
back to Bosnia when she is released from prison." Hodzic "was one of five defendants from the 
St. Louis area and elsewhere indicted in U.S. District Court in St. Louis in 2015. All have 
pleaded guilty and admitted helping Ramiz Hodzic, Sedina Hodzic's husband, send money, 
military uniforms, rifle scopes and other equipment to Abdullah Ramo Pazara and others 
overseas." Pazara, "who originally is from Bosnia like his co-defendants, lived in St. Louis 
County, became a U.S. citizen and then left in 2013 for Syria, where he rose to become an ISIS 
commander." 
KSDK-TV St. Louis (11/11, Cole, 493K) reports, "According to court documents, from May 
2013 to Feb. 5, 2015, Sedina Hodzic and her husband Ramiz Zijad Hodzic conspired with others 
to support the activities of Abdullah Ramo Pazara and others, including a conspiracy to commit 
outside the United States an act that would constitute the offense of murder or maiming if 
committed in the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States. Ramiz and 
Sedina Hodzic intended to and did provide support and resources to Pazara, according to court 
documents." KSDK-TV adds, "The support consisted of money, which was used by her co-
conspirators to purchase supplies such as military uniforms, rifle scopes, combat boots, tactical 
gear, clothing, firearms accessories, range finders and other supplies useful to fighters engaged 
in combat in Syria and elsewhere." 
Senate To Review Airport Security Bill November 18. 
Bloomberg Government (11/10, Courtney) reports that on November 18, the Senate 
Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee will take up measure 5.3730, which would 
"allow private Registered Traveler program companies to assume authority from TSA to screen 
airport passengers' identities." CLEAR is currently the sole participant in the TSA's Registered 
Traveler screening program. TSA Administrator David Pekoske wrote in a May letter to the 
Senate Commerce Committee that CLEAR's expanded role under the measure from allowing 
line-skipping to an airport vetting service was "a bridge too far." 
Austrian Chancellor's Cabinet Agrees On New Anti-Terror Measures. 
The AP (11/11) reports, "Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz's Cabinet on Wednesday agreed on 
a wide range of anti-terrorism measures meant to plug perceived security flaws identified after 
a deadly attack" last week. New measures include keeping "individuals convicted of terror 
offenses behind bars for life, [the] electronic surveillance of people convicted of terror-related 
offenses upon release and criminalizing religiously motivated political extremism." The 
measures "will be brought before parliament in December for a vote." They "take a two-
pronged approach, targeting both terror suspects and also the ideology that drives them." 
The New York Times (11/11, Eddy, 18.61M) reports that Austria's Chancellor Sebastian 
Kurz announced new proposals that "would allow courts to extend the sentences of convicted 
terrorists and...establish a new criminal offense for people who `create the breeding ground' for 
terrorism" the week after "an Islamic State sympathizer killed four people in Vienna." The 
package comes "a day after [Kurz] held talks with President Emmanuel Macron of France and 
other European Union leaders to coordinate efforts across the bloc to crack down on Islamist 
terrorism," and is expected to be "put before Parliament for approval before the end of the 
year."
