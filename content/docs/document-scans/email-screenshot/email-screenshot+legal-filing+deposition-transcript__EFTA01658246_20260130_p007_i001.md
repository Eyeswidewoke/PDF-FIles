intimidate your protesters. `Let me be perfectly clear ... there are no federal troops coming to 
Detroit, or anywhere in Michigan to interfere with protesters," Schneider said Wednesday. The 
Free Press adds, "Many Detroiters have expressed concern and fears about the federal 
intervention as it comes amidst a national Black Lives Matter movement that has turned violent 
in other cities across the country. Detroit protests have thus far been mostly peaceful, though 
many locals fear their city could turn into another Portland, where chaos and mayhem broke 
out following the arrival of federal agents," but "that's not why federal agents are coming here, 
the leaders stressed on Wednesday." 
MLive (MI> (7/29, Afana, 925K) reports, "The plan is to send 42 federal agents from the 
FBI, DEA, Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and U.S. Marshals to Detroit to fight gun 
and gang violence. The city will also get $1 million to combat gang and gun violence from the 
Bureau of Justice Assistance." Schneider "cited a spike in violent crime as the reason. He said 
homicides have increased by 31% in Detroit. `These numbers keep going up. This flood in 
violence keeps threatening our safety. More and more, our children are being caught in the 
crossfire and murdered in senseless gun violence; Schneider said, referring to the May 21 
death of Nathaniel Mesiah Roby, a 4-year-old who was shot in his home." 
The Detroit Metro Times (7/29, Neavling, 219K) reports, "As long as the agents leave 
protesters alone, Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan and police Chief James Craig said they support the 
additional resources." 
WDIV-TV Detroit (7/29, Johncox, 460K) reports from Detroit, "FBI Special Agent in Charge 
Steve D'Antuono announced during a news conference Wednesday a $25,000 reward for 
information leading to the arrest of those responsible for the death of a 4-year-old boy in 
Detroit." Nathaniel "Messiah" Roby-Townsend "died just after midnight on May 21 when 
someone fired shots into his family's home on Birwood Street near Seven Mile Road. Family 
members said the children were in bed when someone drove by and opened fire, hitting 
Nathaniel. He was rushed to a hospital where he was pronounced dead." Among local news

Cleveland To See 25 New Federal Agents In Operation Legend. 
The Cleveland Plain Dealer (7/29, Caniglia, 895K) reports, "Federal authorities said Wednesday 
that Cleveland will get 25 federal agents over the next several months to stem a spike in violent 
crime." The Plain Dealer adds, "Nearly $10 million in federal money also will go toward hiring 30 
Cleveland police officers and seven state officers, U.S. Attorney Justin Herdman told reporters 
at a press conference. 'We can't waste any time here; Herdman said, citing a 35 percent 
increase in shootings in the city over the same time last year. Homicides have jumped 32 
percent, according to the Cuyahoga County Medical Examiner's Office. Herdman's comments 
came days after the White House announced that the U.S. Justice Department selected 
Cleveland and a handful of other cities would receive additional federal officers." 
WEWS-TV Cleveland (7/29, Vanallen) reports, "On Wednesday, the U.S. Attorney's Office 
for the Northern District of Ohio, along with the Cleveland Division of Police, Mayor Frank 
Jackson, and other federal partners, dispelled rumors about `Operation Legend' and what's been 
done in the city as a result of an effort that has been in the planning stages since 2019. 'First 
Operation Legend is a violent crime reduction effort. Period; said Justin Herdman, U.S. Attorney 
for the Northern District of Ohio. 'There are additional resources that are being provided to 
state and local law enforcement to assist in traditional crime-fighting that will be directed at 
gang violence, narcotics-related shootings, and illegal firearms. What it is not is an introduction 
of federal police. It is not an introduction of federal uniform personnel and it's not an 
introduction of federal agents to protect federal property."
