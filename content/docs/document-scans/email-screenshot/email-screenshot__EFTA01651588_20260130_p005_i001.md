and you may retrieve your items at the conclusion of the meeting. 
We would like to confirm that support persons will be invited to enter the FBI Miami Field Office and attend 
the meeting at the in that space on November 12th. Thank you for your patience as we finalized the number 
of meeting attendees, in order to ensure COVID-19 protocols are followed. Please ensure you have submitted 
any support person's information as part of your RSVP questionnaire, so that they will be able to enter the 
building. Additionally, please remember to bring a cloth face mask and that everyone will be screened before 
entering.

Reimbursement: 
Attached you will find the Victim Services Division's form for reimbursement(s). One is blank if you prefer to print and 
mail, the other is a fillable form for emailing. We will also have hard copies of these forms available for you on 
Tuesday. Please complete the attached banking information form and include any of the applicable receipts (such as 
car rental, lodging, tolls, parking receipts, etc.) with the packet. Food is NOT a covered expense. Please note that our 
Finance Division requires receipts showing itemized expenses; please do not submit credit card statements, as this 
does not meet our documentation requirements and will not be accepted. If you are requesting reimbursement for 
lodging, please be aware we are only able to reimburse for the hotel room and taxes. Incidental expenses such as 
laundry or room service charges cannot be reimbursed. For mileage reimbursement, please include starting and 
ending addresses and dates of travel between them. We highly recommend making copies of the receipts and 
maintaining them for your records. Once approved, the funds will appear in your account, without notice, from the 
U.S. Treasury Department. Please monitor your account in the coming weeks.
