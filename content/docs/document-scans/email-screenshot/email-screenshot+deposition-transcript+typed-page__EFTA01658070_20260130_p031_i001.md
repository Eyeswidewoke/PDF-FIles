Trump Lawyers File To Block Manhattan DA's Subpoena For President's Tax Records. 
CNBC (7/27, Mangan, 3.62M) reports on its website that President Trump's lawyers on Monday 
"doubled-down on their efforts to block Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. from 
obtaining his tax records from the president's accountants with a grand jury subpoena." In a 
new filing in Manhattan federal court, "Trump's lawyers said that subpoena for the tax returns 
and other records from the accounting firm Mazars USA is `wildly overboard; and 'is not 
remotely confined to the grand jury investigation that began in 2018' at the direction of Vance." 
The filing argued that "the subpoena demands voluminous documents that relate to topics and 
entities far beyond the District Attorney's limited jurisdiction under New York law. ... This is not 
a properly tailored subpoena for the President's records." They also claim the subpoena "was 
issued in bad faith." 
The New York Times (7/27, Weiser, Rashbaum, 18.61M) describes the filing as Trump's 
"most forceful and detailed legal attack yet on the subpoena for his tax returns from the 
Manhattan district attorney." Trump's lawyers "asked that the judge issue an order barring Mr. 
Vance from 'taking any action to enforce' the subpoena...and that he block Mr. Trump's 
accounting firm, Mazars USA, from turning over any of the information." The Washington Post 
(7/27, Jacobs, 14.2M) says Trump's lawyers "are expected to push for Vance's office to reveal 
more about the scope of its investigation, a move the district attorney opposes." 
Senate GOP Relief Plan Would Cut Weekly Unemployment Aid To $200 Per Week. 
David Muir reported on ABC World News TonightVi (7/27, story 5, 1:40, 7.11M), "Millions of 
Americans on unemployment, out of work in this pandemic, are waiting for word from 
Washington, with that $600 supplemental payment now running out. Two months after the 
Democrats unveiled their plan, Republicans are out with theirs tonight. It proposes a cut in that 
payment." Peter Alexander said on NBC Nightly NewsVi (7/27, story 5, 0:20, Holt, 6.32M), "Top 
Senate Republicans unveiled their proposal for the next economic relief package that would cut 
emergency unemployment benefits for now from $600 to $200, and would green-light another 
round direct payments to Americans." Norah O'Donnell said on the CBS Evening NewsVi (7/27, 
story 5, 1:50, 4.46M), "A final agreement with Democrats could be weeks away, but...for 
millions of unemployed workers, time is running out." 
The AP (7/27, Mascaro, Taylor) reports that the GOP plan is "to cut the jobless boost to 
$200 a week as it phases out to a new system that ensures no more than 70% of an 
employee's previous pay," and "the boost would be available for up to four months to give 
states time to transition to the new system." The New York Times (7/27, 18.61M) says the 
"proposal to slash the jobless aid by two-thirds, part of a Republican plan they began rolling out 
on Monday afternoon, is likely to be among the most bitterly contested issues in bipartisan 
negotiations over the next round of pandemic relief." According to the Times, "Many 
Republicans detest the supplement to state jobless aid, put in place by the $2.2 trillion stimulus 
law, arguing that it is a disincentive to returning to work because it exceeds what some workers 
can earn in regular wages." 
The Washington Post (7/27, Al, Werner, Stein, Kim, 14.2M) reports House Speaker Pelosi 
and Senate Minority Leader Schumer were set to speak with Chief of Staff Meadows and 
Treasury Secretary Mnuchin Monday evening "as they rush to begin negotiations...bumping up 
against a tight deadline before expanded jobless aid expires later this week." The Wall Street 
Journal (7/27, Al, Duehren, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) says the proposed cut to the 
emergency jobless benefit will be the focus of negotiations. Schumer said, "Now our Republican 
friends are saying a bunch of things, some say they don't want to expand it at all, some are 
saying, `Let's give a 30% pay cut to these folks.' Well, they're losing their jobs through no fault 
of their own, and they should get a pay cut?" The Washington Times (7/27, Munoz, 492K) 
reports Pelosi criticized the 'piecemeal' coronavirus spending proposal Monday morning, 
blaming [Republicans] for slow rolling Congress' response to continued economic hardship."
