Justice Department's Investigation into her deceased partner, Jeffrey Epstein. The transfer has been criticized by victims of Epstein and Maxwell, 
who argue that Maxwell, a convicted sex offender, should not receive lenient treatment and should be held in a more secure facility. Additional

Maxwell Opposes Request to Unseal Epstein Grand July Papers 
The New York Times (08/05, Weiser) reported that Ghislaine Maxwell's lawyers have asked a Manhattan federal judge to deny the government's 
request to unseal grand Jury transcripts from the investigation into her and Jeffrey Epstein. The request to unseal the transcripts was made by the 
Trump Justice Department, citing public interest in the case, but Maxwell's la 
ers argue that it would be a broad intrusion into grand jury 
secrecy and violate her due process rights. Some victims, including 
support releasing the transcripts with redactions to protect 
their identities, while Maxwell's lawyers claim that she has become a scapegoat for Epstein's crimes after his death. Additional reporting on the 
story was provided by Associated Press (08/05, Peitz), Politico (08/05, Orden), CBS News (08/05, Rosen), Washington Post (08/05, Stein,

What's Known and Not Yet Known About the DOJ's Scrutiny of Trump•Russia Probe Origins 
The Associated Press (08/05, Tucker) reported that AG Bondi is advancing a criminal investigation into the Obama•era origins of the Trump. 
Russia investigation, using a grand Jury to gather evidence and potentially issue indictments. According to the article, the investigation's targets 
are unclear, but the 'frump administration has been challenging intelligence community conclusions about Russia's actions and intentions, and 
has released documents aimed at casting doubt on the extent of interference. The DOJ's inquiry is the latest in a series of investigations into 
Russian interference and the U.S. government's response to it, with previous reports from Robert Mueller and others documenting Russia's 
activities and identifying flaws in the FBI's investigation. The article highlighted that John Durham, the special counsel appointed by the first 
Trump administration to hunt for government misconduct in the Trump•Russia investigation, also identified significant flaws in the FBI's Russia 
investigation, including errors and omissions in applications the DOJ submitted to a secretive surveillance court to eavesdrop on a national 
security adviser to the 2016 Trump campaign. But Durham found no criminal wrongdoing among senior government officials, bringing three 
criminal cases — two against private citizens that resulted in acquittals at trial and a third against a Iittle•known FBI lawyer who pleaded guilty to 
doctoring an email. The article noted that it is unclear if there is any criminal misconduct that exists that Durham, who launched his investigation 
in 2019 and concluded it four years later, somehow missed during his sprawling inquiry. Axios (08/05, Lotz) reported that President Trump was 
"happy to hear' about the grand Jury probe. Asked Tuesday on CNBC's "Squawk Box" about reports that the DOJ was tapping a grand jury on the 
matter, Trump said he had "nothing to do with it" but added, "they deserve it." He then claimed the 2020 election was rigged, saying. "What they 
did in the 2020 election is grotesque." Additional reporting on the story was provided by The Guardian (08/05, Gedeon), USA Today (08/05, 
Bagchi), New York Times (08/05, Thrush, Feuer, et al.), and The Hill (08/05, Beitsch, Samuels). Opinion pieces on the story were published by The 
Hill (08/05, Mastrangelo), The Atlantic (08/05, Graham), and Mother Jones (08/05, Corn). 
US. Won't Seek Death Penalty For Mexican Drug Lords 
The Associated Press (08/05, Peitz) reported that U.S. prosecutors will not seek the death penalty for Mexican drug lords Ismael 'El Mayo' 
Zambada and Rafael Caro Quintero. Both Zambada and Caro Quintero have pleaded not guilty to drug trafficking charges, and their lawyers have 
welcomed the decision. The move to take the death penalty off the table may signal a possibility of a plea deal, but it is unclear what happens next 
in the cases against the two notorious cartel leaders. The article contains an image released by the FBI that shows the wanted poster for Rafael 
Caro Quintero. Additional reporting on the story was provided by New York Daily News (08/05, Annese), Reuters (08/05, Cohen), New York 
Times (08/05, Nerlcar), and Los Angeles Times (08/05, Hamilton). 
Continued Reporting: Police Records Detail Midtown Gunman's Mental Health Crises in Las Vegas 
The Wall Street Journal (08/05, Morphet) reported that police visited the home of gunman Shane Tamura, 27, twice in recent years due to 
concerns he was armed and suicidal. Tamura was subject to two mental health crisis interventions by Las Vegas police in 2022 and 2024. He was 
arrested for trespassing at a Las Vegas casino in 2023 before killing four people in a Midtown Manhattan skyscraper. It was previously reported 
that Deputy Director Bongino stated that the shooting is currently under investigation. 
FBI Raises Ransomware Threat Level From One To Four 
Forbes (08/05, Winder) reported that the FBI has raised the ransomware threat level from 1 to 4 due to the increasing use of quadruple extortion 
tactics by ransomware attackers. Quadruple extortion tactics involve encryption, data theft, DDoS attacks, and sending harassing messages to 
business partners, employees, and others to pressure the primary victim. The Akamai 2025 ransomware trends threat intelligence report warns 
that this evolution of tactics has proven effective for ransomware groups, resulting in escalated average ransom payments. The article highlighted 
that the days of just locking down access to your files and hoping you haven't got a recent backup have long gone, replaced by what is commonly 
known as a double extortion tactic. This is what the FBI warned of in the Scattered Spider advisory, where the attackers steal your data before 
encrypting it.
