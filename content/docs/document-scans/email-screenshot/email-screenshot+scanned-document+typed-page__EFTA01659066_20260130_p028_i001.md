Colorado, Illinois, Kentucky and Ohio." The AP (10/21, Pane, Johnson, Peters) reports hospitals 
"are starting to buckle from a resurgence of COVID-19 cases, with several states setting 
records for the number of people hospitalized and leaders scrambling to find extra beds and 
staff. New highs in cases have been reported in states big and small...in recent days." 
HHS Secretary Azar said on WDAK-AM (10/21), "We're seeing an increase in cases across 
a good part of the country right now. What that's driven by is we're getting colder weather in 
the North and folks are getting indoors...and we're really seeing a lot of the spread happening 
from just those household gatherings. ... Even if you're having those casual gatherings, please 
mind your protections, because you are very much at risk of getting it or giving it, even if 
you're related to someone or friends with someone." The New York Times (10/21, 18.61M) 
reports that Alaska's experience with events moving inside due to the cold may provide a 
suggestion of what lies ahead in the winter. 
California "Has Largely Avoided" New Wave Of Cases. The Los Angeles Times 
(10/21, 4.64M) reports California "has largely avoided a new wave of coronavirus cases that 
has sparked alarm elsewhere in the country, but the state faces new dangers in the coming 
weeks as key businesses reopen and the holidays arrive." Health experts credit Gov. Gavin 
Newsom (D) for an "overhauled system - introduced Aug. 28 and much tougher than the 
state's disastrous first reopening - as a big reason for California having so far staved off a new 
surge in cases." 
NYC Girds For New Wave. The New York Times (10/21, 18.61M) reports some New 
York City residents are preparing for a potential second wave of coronavirus cases. The Times 
describes people stockpiling supplies, staying at home more, and wearing masks more 
frequently in response. Recently, Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) and New York City Mayor Bill de 
Blasio (D) ordered "lockdowns in several parts of Brooklyn and Queens where the infection rate 
has risen most sharply." 
La Crosse, Wisconsin, Cases Spread From Students To Elderly. The Washington
Post (10/21, Al, Eilperin, Dennis, Mooney, 14.2M) looks at the spike in cases in La Crosse, 
Wisconsin - "a wildfire of infection that first appeared predominantly in the student-age 
population, spread throughout the community and ultimately ravaged elderly residents who had 
previously managed to avoid the worst of the pandemic." 
GOP Governors Seek Basic Public Health Precautions. 
Politico (10/21, Goldberg, Olistein, 4.29M) reports, "Republican governors are pleading for basic 
public health precautions" against COVID, even as President Trump "downplays the pandemic's 
severity and tells people to move on with their lives." Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine (R) "urged 
attendees at an upcoming Cincinnati campaign rally headlined by Vice President Mike Pence to 
wear masks," while Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee (R) on Tuesday "announced a new statewide ad 
campaign promoting face coverings." Earlier this week, Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves (R) "issued 
a mask mandate and limited indoor gatherings to 10 people and outdoor gatherings to 50 
people in nine counties." 
Adams To Be Arraigned Next Month Over Alleged Hawaii Emergency Order Violation. 
The Honolulu Star-Advertiser (10/21, Bernardo, 691K) reports Surgeon General Adams and an 
aide "will be arraigned in an Oahu court next month after police cited the two men in late 
August for being in a Kaneohe park during a COVID-19 emergency order-mandated closure of 
the island's beach parks." A videoconference hearing was held Wednesday, and "both men were 
cited for allegedly violating an emergency order." Adams' attorney said he intends to plead not 
guilty. The AP (10/21, Jones) reports, "Because the charge is a 'full misdemeanor,' the judge 
said the not guilty plea could not be entered until Adams decided if he would waive his right to 
a jury trial." Adams' attorney said he would not waive that right.
