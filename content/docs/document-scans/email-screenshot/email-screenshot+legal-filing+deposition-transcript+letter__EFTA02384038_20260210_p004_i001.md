Sunni and Shia — for his position at the forefront of the struggle against Israel. If anyone has taken over that role, 
at=least until recently, it is Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey's prime ministe=. Iran's appeal has been tainted by the brutal 
tactics of its allies, in=Damascus and Beirut, who may remain strong materially but have lost out in=terms of image and 
ideas. 
The long-term decline of the Islamic Republic in the Middle East presents a= opportunity for peace in the region, 
particularly in Syria. However, when=it comes to the nuclear issue, it may prove a double-edged sword: opting f=r 
nuclear weapons can be seen as the only way to avoid being pushed into a=corner. Preventing this scenario depends on 
the skill of the negotiating t=ams in Geneva and, ultimately, on the ability of the administration of US =resident Barack 
Obama to overcome resistance by Congress and offer a meani=gful deal to Tehran.

Iran's diplomatic thaw with the West 
Joel Rubin 
October 20 - Congratulations, Congress. Your Iran strategy is working. Now =hat? 
The diplomatic thaw between Iran and the West is advancing, and faster than=most of us had imagined. This is the 
result of years of painstaking effort= by the Obama administration and lawmakers to pressure the Islamic Republi= into 
deciding whether it's in Iran's interest to pursue diplomacy or =o continue suffering under crushing economic sanctions 
and international i=olation. Now that Iran has made a clear decision to engage seriously in di=lomatic negotiations with 
the West over its nuclear program, its intention= should be tested. Members of Congress should be open to seizing this 
oppo=tunity by making strategic decisions on sanctions policy. The economic san=tions against Iran that are in place 
have damaged the Iranian economy. A credible military threat — with more than 40,000 American troops in the Pe=sian 
Gulf — stands on alert. International inspectors are closely monito=ing Iran's every nuclear move. Iran has not yet made 
a decision to build=a bomb, does not have enough medium-enriched uranium to convert to weapons=grade material for 
one bomb and has neither a workable nuclear warhead nor=a means to deliver it at long ranges. If Iran were to make a 
dash for a bo=b, the U.S. intelligence community estimates that it would take roughly on= to two years to do so. 
Congress, with its power to authorize sanctions relief, plays a crucial rol= in deciding whether a deal will be achieved. 
This gives Congress the oppo=tunity to be a partner in what could potentially be a stunning success in =dvancing our 
country's security interests without firing a shot. 
Consider the alternative: If the administration negotiates a deal that Congress blocks, and Congress becomes a spoiler, 
Iran will most likely continue=to accelerate its nuclear program. Then lawmakers would be left with a sta=k choice: 
either acquiesce to an unconstrained Iranian nuclear program and=a potential Iranian bomb or endorse the use of force 
to attempt to stop it= Most military experts rate the odds of a successful bombing campaign low =nd worry that failed 
strikes would push Iran to get the bomb outright. Ira= and the United States need a political solution to this conflict. 
Now is =he time to test the Iranians at the negotiating table, not push them away. 
Congress is also being tested, but the conventional wisdom holds that lawma=ers won't show the flexibility required to 
make a deal. Such thinking mi=ses the political volatility just beneath the surface: Americans simply do='t support 
another war in the Middle East, as the congressional debate o=er Syria made crystal clear. Would they back much riskier 
military action =n Iran? Fortunately for Congress, President Barack Obama was agile enough =o seize the diplomatic 
route and begin to eliminate Syria's chemical wea=ons. These results are advancing U.S. security interests. And members 
of C=ngress breathed a collective sigh of relief as well as they didn't have =o either vote to undercut the commander in 
chief on a security issue or st=ck a finger in the eye of their constituents. 
The same can happen on Iran. By pursuing a deal, Obama can provide Congress=with an escape hatch, where it won't 
have to end up supporting unpopular=military action or have to explain to its constituents why it failed to bl=ck an 
Iranian bomb. A verifiable deal with Iran that would prevent it from=acquiring a nuclear weapon would require 
sanctions relief from Congress. B=t that's an opportunity to claim victory, not a burden. And it would mak= Congress a 
partner with the president on a core security issue. Congress =ould then say, with legitimacy, that its tough sanctions on 
Iran worked =97 and did so without starting another unpopular American war in the Middl= East.
