Naturally, I want make sure that when I die, Valeria will at lea=t have a place to live and something to live on. 0PQ: I 
might re-word this=as it is Noam's intent as expressed to me and Gene that Valeria re=eives the totality of Noam's 
estate, and not just an amount that w=ll give her subsistence. 
VC: Again, Deborah. This is the main and extreme=y important point of my letter. I might be entitled to receive 
whate=er will be left from one of the IRA, if something will be left, but not the "totality" of Noam's =state. DPQ: I 
hope=l was able to clarify above what I meant. I think the lack of clarit= here stems from the fact that Noam earned 
everything and a lot of those assets were placed in Carol's name prior to her death for estate t=x minimization purposes, 
so they became part of "Carol's e=tate". I am happy to include these items in the term 4>=9CNoam's estate" if you wish 
as that reflects the totality=of assets that pass at Noam's death, whether through trusts set up by Carol (the Marit=l 
Trusts) or from Noam directly. 
She came here, abandoning everything in Brazil, to be with me in-tiny last years. We are very happy together, and care 
for each other.=C2* It is a joy I never anticipated after Mommy died and after the years I spent alone.</=> 
That's the situation. It is entirely different from wh=t you heard. Again, I do not know what the source of your 
informatio= is, but it is completely inaccurate. 
I should add, perhaps, that in earlier years, I was indeed carel=ss about expenses, leaving it to Mommy. Valeria has 
taken over, and =or the past three years, both of us have been monitoring expenses carefully and know exactly what i= 
coming in and what is being spent. We have all the facts very clear=y laid out, and are planning accordingly. I am glad 
that the three o= you will be well taken care of from the estate, the way it was planned years ago. DPQ: As above the 
reference here should be to Carol.=99s Marital Trusts, just to be clear that the that is the children40=99s inheritance. 
VC: I disagree, Deborah. The reference here shou=d be to what corresponds to reality -- Noam's children will=be taken 
care from his estate. Not only from Carol's Marital Trust that were composed by Noam as the grantor, =stablished to 
make use of the guarantees for the children and tax issues, =ut still part of Noam's estate, as we all know. DPQ: 
Understood. 
Frankly, I always assumed that I would be able to disregard fina=cial concerns in my last years, but as a result of careless 
and faulty dec=sions taken long ago, and some bad recent advice, that is not the way things are turning ou=.

Dear Doddoy and Valeria, 
It was really nice to talk to both of you just now - we'll have to =o it more often. 
As I mentioned, I'm sending you a letter from all three of us (Avi =nd Harry in copy). 
<mailto 
> > 
We decided to write this letter because we are very worried about what =e've been hearing from you about your 
financial situation and the =mount of stress it is causing you. We have been worried for many months now, but the 
situation seems to be be=oming more and more dire and we feel like we can't just stand by a=d watch it happen any 
more. We want to help find solutions that might be l=ss drastic than what we understand you are considering.
