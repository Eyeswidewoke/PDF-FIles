FBI Phoenix Warns Of Chinese Efforts To Steal Data. 
KTAR-FM Glendale, AZ (11/23, Zetino, 125K) reports from Phoenix, Arizona, "The Phoenix FBI 
office warns that attempts from the Chinese government to steal sensitive information happen 
all across the country and even right here in Arizona. The targets are usually people whose jobs 
give them access to sensitive U.S. government or business information. `We have seen cases 
where individuals are being recruited, being incentivized to return to China and take a job for 
more money,' Assistant Special Agent Craig Moringiello said." Moringiello "is in charge of 
counterintelligence and cyber for the Phoenix FBI office. Just last week, a former engineer at 
Raytheon Missiles and Defense in Tucson was sentenced to more than three years in prison for 
taking sensitive military-related technology data in his company-issued computer to China. Wei 
Sun had been working with the company for 10 years and had access to information directly 
related to defense-related technology." 
Former DO) Official, "Anonymous" Author Miles Taylor Named As Witness In Flynn 
Probe. 
The Washington Times (11/23, Mordock, 492K) reports that former DHS official Miles Taylor 
was named as a "witness in the FBI's investigation into Michael Flynn, two Senate-panel 
chairmen said Monday." Taylor "authored an op-ed vowing resistance to President Trump." Sens. 
Charles Grassley (R-IA) and Ron Johnson (R-WI) "cited a newly-declassified May 2017 Justice 
Department document summarizing the FBI's efforts in its Russian collusion probe." The 
document "names Mr. Taylor as a witness in the Flynn investigation, but doesn't explain the 
FBI's interest in him or his connection to Flynn, who briefly served as Mr. Trump's national 
security adviser." The document says, "Witness interview of Miles Taylor, mentioned in the 
[Foreign Agents Registration Act] documents, indicated Flynn Intel Group's involvement with a 
late 2016 Turkey-related briefing to the now-National Security Adviser to the Vice President." 
National Review (11/23, Evans, 731K) reports that Johnson and Grassley have asked DOJ 
to declassify notes from the Taylor interview. They wrote in a letter to AG Barr, "We request all 
records relating to the FBI's interview of Miles Taylor, including all 302s and notes, to better 
understand his role in the Flynn investigation." 
The Washington Examiner (11/23, Dunleavy, 448K) adds that Johnson and Grassley 
wrote, "We believe that further declassification is appropriate at this time because, among other 
factors, the Inspector General's review of Crossfire Hurricane is closed; the investigation has 
already been the subject of years of oversight, public hearings, and document productions; and 
there is a strong public interest in knowing and understanding what really transpired between 
and among federal government officials relating to Crossfire Hurricane." 
Report: US Has Taken Kim Jong-un's Nephew Into Protective Custody. 
War Is Boring (11/23, 695K) reports that the CIA "took the family of Kim Jong-nam, the half 
brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, after Kim Jong-nam was murdered in February 
2017, although it is unclear where the family resides now, said a Korean American writer." Suki 
Kim, in a New Yorker article titled "The Underground Movement Trying to Topple the North 
Korean Government," discussed "the activities of Adrian Hong, the leader of Free Joseon, a 
group that has helped North Korean defectors reach third countries safely." According to the 
activist group, "Kim Jong-nam's son Han-sol called Hong for help because the Macao police who 
had been guarding his house disappeared after his father was killed by a nerve agent that two 
women smeared on his face at the Kuala Lumpur airport on Feb. 13, 2017."
