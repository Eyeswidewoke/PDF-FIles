Trump's re-election chances, a recent CIA analysis concluded, a signal that intelligence agencies 
continue to back their assessment of Russian activities despite the president's attacks." The 
assessment is "consistent with intelligence officials' warning to lawmakers in January that 
Russia was interfering on Mr. Trump's behalf." The CIA has "moderate confidence in its analysis," 
in part because the intelligence community "appears to lack intercepted communications or 
other direct evidence confirming his direction" of Derkach's efforts. According to people 
"familiar with the matter, the new analysis was published ahead of the sanctions in the CIA 
Worldwide Intelligence Review, a classified document that circulates to members of Congress 
and the Trump administration." 
The Washington Post (9/22, 14.2M) reports CIA analysts "compiled the assessment with 
input from the National Security Agency and the FBI, based on several dozen pieces of 
information gleaned from public, unclassified and classified intelligence sources." The 
assessment includes details "of the CIA's analysis of the activities of Ukrainian lawmaker Andriy 
Derkach to disseminate disparaging information about Biden inside the United States through 
lobbyists, Congress, the media and contacts with figures close to the president." ODNI and the 
Treasury Department have "identified Derkach as a Russian agent, but it has not been publicly 
reported that the CIA, NSA and FBI believed Putin may be personally directing the campaign." 
The CIA assessment described "Derkach's efforts in detail and said that his activities have 
included working through lobbyists, members of Congress and U.S. media organizations to 
disseminate and amplify his anti-Biden information." It also refers to "Derkach's interactions 
with a `prominent' person connected to the Trump campaign, the analysis does not identify the 
person." 
CNN (9/22, Stracqualursi, Cohen, Cohen, 83.16M) reports the assessment reads, "We 
assess that President Vladimir Putin and the senior most Russian officials are aware of and 
probably directing Russia's influence operations aimed at denigrating the former U.S. Vice 
President, supporting the U.S. president and fueling public discord ahead of the U.S. election in 
November." Former CIA officer Douglas London "told CNN that the agency's use of the word 
`probably' when concerning an issue of such importance means its `analysts are sufficiently 
confident based on their deep expertise to put their reputations on the line in making such a 
call." 
The New York Times (9/22, Sanger, Kanno-Youngs, 18.61M) reports separately that "four 
years ago, when Russian intelligence agencies engaged in a systematic attempt to influence the 
American presidential election, the disinformation they fed American voters required some real 
imagination at the troll farms producing the ads." This year, however, they are "largely 
amplifying misleading statements from President Trump, mostly about the dangers of mail-in 
ballots." In interviews, "a range of officials and private analysts said that Mr. Trump was feeding 
many of the disinformation campaigns they were struggling to halt." Intelligence officials are 
also described as "battling an effort by Mr. Trump and his top advisers to cast China and Iran as 
equal threats to the election, which runs counter to their intelligence." 
The Hill (9/22, Mastrangelo, 2.98M) reports, and CNN (9/22, 83.16M) also reports in a 
video. 
US Warns "Foreign Actors" May Introduce Disinformation On Delayed Election 
Results. 
Reuters (9/22, Lange) reports US federal law enforcement and "cybersecurity agencies on 
Tuesday warned that `foreign actors' will likely try to discredit the November presidential 
election by taking advantage of the slow counting of mail-in ballots." In a joint public 
statement, the CISA and FBI said that the additional time needed to count a higher volume of 
mail-in ballots "could leave officials with incomplete results on election night," the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said in a joint 
public service announcement. The agencies said, "Foreign actors and cybercriminals could 
exploit the time required to certify and announce elections' results by disseminating
