believe the money for the FBI construction was in the legislation. Told that it was, the Kentucky 
Republican said the administration insisted on it. 'You'll have to ask them why they insisted that 
be included,' he told reporters." The Times adds, "President Trump has expressed an interest in 
rebuilding the headquarters, which is located about a block from the Trump International Hotel. 
Earlier plans envisioned relocating the agency's headquarters outside Washington." 
CQ Roll Call (7/27, Lerman, 154K) reports, "Democrats have suggested that the 
president's interest in the Trump Hotel, also on Pennsylvania Avenue, may have influenced the 
decision to not redevelop the FBI site, potentially as a competing hotel. Top Senate Republicans 
were at pains to defend the provision in the coronavirus relief package, which the White House 
pushed for." 
CNN (7/27, Mattingly, Raju, Barrett, Kelly, 83.16M) reports, "McConnell initially indicated 
at a news conference Monday that he was not aware the FBI provision was in the bill but then 
moments later said the White House 'insisted that be included: 'I'm not sure that it is,' 
McConnell replied to a reporter when he was first asked why the money was in the Senate GOP 
proposal. An appropriations aide to McConnell then interjected and explained off camera to 
everyone in the room: 'There's a limitation to honing specifically to Covid-related matters, so 
we'll get more information for you." McConnell "was then asked if it was possible an almost $2 
billion could be in the measure without his knowledge, and he seemed to suggest he was 
aware. 'Well, in regard to that proposal, obviously we had to have an agreement with the 
administration in order get started. And they will have to answer the question as to why they 
insisted on that." 
Bloomberg (7/27, House, 4.73M) reports, "Plans to move the FBI from its current location 
about four blocks from the White House had been in the works since about 2012, but were 
scuttled after Trump took office. The president told reporters last week that other potential sites 
in nearby Maryland and Virginia were not preferable because 'you have to be near the Justice 
Department' and 'there's nothing better than the site," but Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-VA) "and 
other Democrats have accused Trump of trying to keep the bureau's headquarters at its current 
site because it occupies a significant chunk of real estate near the Trump International Hotel, 
and keeping it there would prevent other commercial development in the spot." 
Barr To Defend Administration In Congressional Testimony. 
The Washington Post (7/27, Zapotosky, Demirjian, 14.2M) reports Attorney General Barr "will 
tell the House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday that President Trump has not inappropriately 
intervened in Justice Department business - even though Barr has more than once moved in 
criminal cases to help the president's allies - and he will defend the administration's response 
to civil unrest in the country, according to a copy of his opening statement." Barr, according to 
the statement, "will take a defiant posture as he testifies before the panel for the first time 
since Democrats took control of it, alleging that they have attempted to 'discredit' him." Barr is 
quoted as saying in his opening statement, "From my experience, the President has played a 
role properly and traditionally played by Presidents." 
The New York Times (7/27, Savage, Fandos, 18.61M) says Tuesday's testimony "is 
expected to be a showdown over his interventions in the criminal cases of President Trump's 
allies and his role in deploying federal agents to confront protesters demanding racial justice in 
Washington and across the country." For Barr, the hearing "will offer the highest-profile platform 
to date to explain his rationale for the protest response and other issues, like voter fraud and 
the special counsel's Russia investigation." 
The Washington Times (7/27, Mordock, 492K) reports Barr is expected to "call on 
committee Democrats to condemn the violence." Barr will say, "To tacitly condone destruction 
and anarchy is to abandon the basic rule-of-law principles that should unite us even in a 
politically divisive time."
