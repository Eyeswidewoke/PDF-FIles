improved defenses. Wyden's letter to the FBI emphasizes the importance of strengthening defensive cyber advice 
to counter advanced cyber tools. 
Continued Reporting: Salt Typhoon 'Largely Contained' in Telecom Networks 
FedScoop (07/07, Staff Writer) reported that the Chinese hackers behind the massive telecommunications sector 
breach are "largely contained" and "dormant" in the networks, "locked into the location they're in" and "not 
actively infiltrating information," Brett Leatherman, the top FBI cyber official, stated. According to the article, 
Leatherman said in a recent interview that that doesn't mean the hackers, known as Salt Typhoon, no longer pose a 
threat. The article explained that while there's been some debate about whether Salt Typhoon should be getting 
more attention than fellow Chinese hackers Volt Typhoon — whom federal officials have said are prepositioned in 
U.S. critical infrastructure, poised for destructive action in the event of a conflict with the United States —
Leatherman said the groups aren't as different as some think. The number of telecommunications companies 
victimized in the United States stands at nine, according to Leatherman. 
Continued Reporting: FBI Warns of Phishing Scams Targeting Health Care Data 
WGAL (NBC-8) (07/07, Roche) reported that the FBI issued a warning about phishing scams targeting health and 
financial information. According to the article, scammers are impersonating fraud investigators from health 
insurance companies through emails and text messages to steal sensitive data. The article explained that to protect 
yourself, be cautious of unsolicited messages, use strong passwords, enable multi-factor authentication, and verify 
messages directly with your health insurance provider. 
Continued Reporting: FBI Warns Airline and Transportation Sectors About Scattered Spider 
JDSupra (07/07, Freedman) reported that the FBI warned the airline and transportation sectors about cyber attacks 
from the Scattered Spider criminal ring, which uses social engineering techniques to gain access. According to the 
article, Scattered Spider targets large corporations and third-party IT providers by impersonating employees or 
contractors and bypassing multi-factor authentication (MFA). The article noted that to defend against these attacks, 
organizations can take proactive steps such as training help desk staff and deploying phishing-resistant MFA. 
CyberScoop (07/07, Kapko), digwatch (07/07, Staff Writer), and Tech Republic (07/07, Abdullahi) also reported on 
the story. 
Opinion: The FBI's Dangerous Failure to Adapt to the Digital Age 
An opinion piece published by Lawfare Media (07/07, Landau) reported that the FBI has failed to adapt to the 
digital age, leaving agents and informants vulnerable to threats from adversaries who exploit technology, as seen in 
cases where Hezbollah and Iranian hackers used surveillance to target U.S. interests. A report by the U.S. 
Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General (DIG) found that the FBI's handling of ubiquitous technical 
surveillance (UTS) is "disjointed and inconsistent", with inadequate training for personnel, including a 45-minute 
UTS course that is repeated every two years. The article assessed that the FBI's failure to adapt to the digital age is 
a long-standing issue, with past attempts to update systems, such as the Automated Case Support system, failing 
due to a lack of understanding of the fundamental shift in investigative processes, and the bureau's opposition to 
end-to-end encryption has been misguided, as demonstrated by the Chinese government's Salt Typhoon cyber 
exploit.

Using Al to Go After Health Care Fraud 
Politico (07/07, Nguyen) reported that the federal government is using artificial intelligence to crack down on 
health care fraud schemes. The AI-powered crackdown provides the federal government with a tool to stay ahead 
of fraudsters and hasten the investigation process. According to the article, the effort, orchestrated by the Justice 
Department, the FBI and HHS's Office of the Inspector General, has led to criminal charges against 324 defendants, 
including 96 doctors, nurse practitioners, pharmacists and other medical professionals for alleged participation in 
health care fraud schemes. The article mentioned that Health care scams can be a significant drain on the 
healthcare system, and the Trump administration has emphasized that it aims to go after this.
