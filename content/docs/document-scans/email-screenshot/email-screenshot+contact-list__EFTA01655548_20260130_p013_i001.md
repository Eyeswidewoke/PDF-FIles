Tennessee Man Indicted on Federal Child Exploitation Charges Involving Six Minors 
Hoodline Memphis (11/20, Freeman) reported that John A. Bell, a 59-year-old man from McKenzie, Tennessee, has 
been indicted on federal child exploitation charges. According to the article, the charges involve six minors and 
include 14 counts of creating explicit material and one count of possessing illegal images. The investigation leading 
to these serious implications has been a tag-team effort, spearheaded by Special Agent Eric McCraw from the FBI 
Nashville Division's Jackson Resident Agency and Lt. David Andrews of the Henry County Sheriff's Office. The article 
noted that officials are urging anyone with additional information regarding Bell's case or any instance of child 
abuse to immediately reach out to the FBI Nashville Division.

CYBER DIVISION 
NSA Releases Guidance for ISPs and Network Defenders to Mitigate Malicious Activity 
Cyber Press (11/20, Staff Writer) reported that the National Security Agency, CISA, the FBI, and international 
cybersecurity partners jointly released new guidance to help internet service providers and network defenders 
mitigate malicious activity linked to bulletproof hosting providers used by cybercriminals. According to the article, 
bulletproof hosting services deliberately ignore legal takedown requests and are increasingly leveraged for 
ransomware operations, data extortion, phishing campaigns, command-and-control activity, and attacks on critical 
infrastructure, prompting the agencies to recommend strategies such as high-confidence malicious resource lists, 
continuous traffic analysis, ISP-led customer awareness efforts, and "know your customer" procedures. The article 
noted that the multinational framework —supported by partners from the United States, Australia, Canada, the 
Netherlands, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom—aims to raise operational costs for attackers and push them 
toward monitored infrastructure, thereby diminishing the advantages cybercriminals gain from bulletproof hosting. 
Top Senate Intel Dem Warns of 'Catastrophic' Cyber Consequences of Trump Admin National Security 
Firings 
CyberScoop (11/20, Starks) reported that Sen. Mark Warner warned that the Trump administration's politicization 
of intelligence and mass firings of national security personnel are leaving the United States dangerously vulnerable 
to cyberattacks and other foreign threats. According to the article, Warner criticized the firing of one-third of CISA's 
workforce, the dismissal of former NSA/Cyber Command leaders, and specifically the firing of Michael Nordwall, 
the former head of the FBI's criminal cyber response branch that oversaw the bureau's work against ransomware, 
online fraud, and other cybercrime. The article noted that Warner said these cutbacks come amid escalating 
warnings from Trump administration officials about threats from China, Russia, Iran, and other adversaries, arguing 
that eliminating agents who investigate terrorists, foreign spies, cyber hackers, and child predators "does not make 
America safer."

DNA Technology Links Jawbone Found in Oxnard to 1978 Boating Accident 
VC Reporter (11/20, Wilson) reported that a human jawbone found in 1984 at Silver Strand Beach in Oxnard has 
been identified as belonging to Donald Scott Reich, a 33-year-old professional organist. According to the 
article, Reich went missing in 1978 after a boating accident off the coast of Channel Islands Harbor, and his body 
was partially recovered. Still, the jawbone was not found until six years later. As DNA technology improved, a 
genetic profile obtained from the jawbone was entered into the FBI's Combined DNA Index System during 2006. 
Those efforts, which also involved the Sheriff's Major Crimes Bureau and Cold Case Unit, proved fruitless, since 
there were no matches to any missing persons. The article noted that the identification was made possible through 
advanced DNA technology provided by Othram, a private DNA laboratory, which built a comprehensive genetic 
profile that matched a relative of Reich's.
