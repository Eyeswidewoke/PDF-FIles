I was told that Toms office is sendin= someone in ,or some people in, to review something. brad told me ,t=e 
partnership accounting. is wendy overseeing? I know nothing more =han that. Having them review things without even 
asking for my input , or =et alone my direction ,is ridiculous. but.. I guess you wanted to save mon=y ? 
I would suggest you reorient your thinking. and to paraphrase anot=er client - the work of art you bought from me 
though not cheap. is =he most valuable piece in your collection , by a multiple. 
The =udit has brought to the fore the lack of your office quality that i =ave been violently squawking about. ie . 
children playin= at at adult game. It is inconceivable to me that John castruc=i is still there, joslin part time but relied 
on. , jo= mistake after mistake and brad a corporate bandleader talking about=the office's finance team, accounting 
dept, and directing wendy =o do things that are clearly not in your interest. ( saving mo=ey again ?) its nuts!! . a still 
non-existent IT =ept. impossible , it was the first thing on my list of things =hat were needed to be done. Still no 
trading accounts t= speak of , though its prophylactic quality has been discussed over and ov=r again the past three 
years . computer do not read page 6. =C2 the women at the IRS do. ! As you said your motivation to keep=this group 
of part timers was a consequence of my high =ees. . the unfortunate result was easily predictab=e. - now 
you can hire me and =AO my team or not. if yes , I will oversee the audits. take charge of the =RA BRH assignments 
and review 2012 options!! your redo of the estate fire =rill has not moved very much. Lots of paper needs to be 
collected a=d reviewed, At MY direction. the outside team will be brought in at =y expense working for me, coming in 
for two to three wee=s -they will review . sucession, technology, tax and compliance. inv=stment reporting „ 
computerized timelines for filings etc.=C2 . household classifcations and reporting that makes sens=. Have no fear 
the goal of this excercise is to end, not exten= , our financial interaction. you will have a machine that wor=s . to drive 
it is not complex , to build the car, another story, =C2 Unfortunatleyfor us both, the price for my work has not =hanged 
since day one. 40m per year, I m willing to discount i= to 35 as I did give you a bad number when asked and should 
pa= an embarassment fine. Im also aware, as you made perfectly c=ear . that you have paid what you consider a great 
deal of money, th=ugh, as you know, without a doubt, you have far and away recieved =ay more than called for in our 
agreement . please also =emember that you and i agreed no more demands on my time after the l=st payment , I 
stepped in to help , as you had an unexpected =ome mess on your plate ( not because i was responsible for joslin ha=ing 
a breakdown ). and have worked many many hours doing things that=were never my responsiblity ,soley because of 
our unique frien=ship. by the way , on another note you recently seemed =hy to discuss certain things. , please be 
assured I make no judgeme=t on any of your activities , whether or not i agree with them . =AO not my role. my role 
is, protection first. no matter what=you do. I am on your side. 
OR, you can decide that b=ad , tom , and whomever else you choose can oversee your audits . th=y are both aware and 
sensitive to the issue at hand. alan cou=d be brought in but i would be extra careful having paul weiss given=access to 
entire story. you can delay a decision to after your spa. =ut I wouldnt if i were you. 
3. =Remind me to talk to you about ..
