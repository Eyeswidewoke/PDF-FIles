example, why I have always selected the Trustees without question or discussion, and should continue to do so, just as 
M would have done had she been the survivor, as we anticipated. 
Perhaps, though you haven't said so, you agree =ith Max, and want to ensure that the survivor (me) does not have 
access to the funds and that they should go to you in addition to those of which you are already the beneficiaries. And 
that I should not have the right to leave anything to Valeria. If that's the case -- which i= hard for me to believe -- I think 
it would be best to say so straight out.=C24o If it's anything else, I just don't understand your letter. 
We have begged you to meet with us with a mediator. We renew that request. A mediator is a person trained to help 
different parties communicate and understand each other. This is what we want. We do not want to watch you engage 
in expensive legal battles, and we do not want to live in trepidation of the next angry and irrational email we might 
receive from you. 
You have received completely rational emails 
whi=h are sometimes annoyed, and for good reasons. I still am shocked 
at the refusal to pay part of the taxes without extensive financial scrutiny, particularly after the facts that I have again 
described. I don't know what you have heard about "expensive legal battles," but I strongly suspect that it is as 
mistaken as your beliefs about my financia= situation. I'd be glad to meet, or more easily to have a collecti=e phone call, 
but I cannot imagine why you want a mediator. If there are some issues, we can discuss them. In my mind at least, 
there is no adversarial conflict for which a mediator is in order. 
I do hope, again, that we can resolve this quickly.=C24> It is deeply disturbing, the one and only disturbing thing in my 
life.4>=A0 And unnecessary, unless you have something on your minds that you have not told me. 
A few more comments below. 
PS. About your earlier letter concerning the estate plan, though I responded explaining why you and Max are 
completely wrong about the Marital Trust, there are a few points I left out. 
One, I'm amazed, and not a little disturbed, th=t you have even looked into this in such extensive detail. These are 
matter= I never paid any attention to until I started looking into my affairs and discovered what was being done by my 
advisers, as I've just one again d=scribed. I do not comprehend why you felt that you should undertake this inquiry --
just it would have been unthinkable for me to have inquired into your affairs when you were making decisions I found 
questionable and was of course supporting them, financially and otherwise. 
But put that aside. 
The first sentence of your letter is Max's inte=pretation, which is flatly false, and surely ridiculous. We never thought of 
the crazy idea of setting up two separate Trusts, one to manage my "in=ividual property," and the other for M to 
manage her "individual property." It amazes me that this idea could even occur to you. We had common property, not 
divided into mine and hers. Technically, almost all of it was my earnings, but it would never have occurred to us to 
regard that as my "individual property," or even to imagine separate "individual properties." Again, Eric suggested this 
pretense solely for tax purposes. We agreed, but the idea that you (and Max) express could never have occurred to us, 
and I find it hard to understand how it occurred to you.
