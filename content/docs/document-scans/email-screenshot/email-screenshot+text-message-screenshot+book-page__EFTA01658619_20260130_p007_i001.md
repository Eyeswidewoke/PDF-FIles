OPERATION LEGEND 
Barr Announces Takedown Of Drug Trafficking Ring Under Operation LeGend. 
The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel (9/22, Vielmetti, 632K) reports, "U.S. Attorney General William 
Barr returned to Wisconsin Tuesday, three weeks after a visit to Kenosha to see the aftermath 
of arson, looting and vandalism that followed protests over the police shooting of a Black man 
in the back. This time, he was announcing the arrests of 26 people in Milwaukee and California, 
charged in a sprawling drug trafficking and money laundering conspiracy, as the latest victory in 
Operation Legend, launched in July to target violent street crime in a few major cities." 
According to the Journal Sentinel, US Attorney Matthew Krueger "said the roundup included 
seizures pursuant to 24 search warrants of at least 33 firearms - including one stolen from the 
Milwaukee Police Department recovered in California - at least $170,000 in cash and drugs, 
including 700 grams of heroin at a single location." 
The AP (9/22) reports, "Krueger said during a news conference that federal, state and 
local law enforcement officers arrested 21 of 26 suspects connected to the ring Tuesday 
morning. Officers executed search warrants in both California and Milwaukee. They seized about 
33 firearms, $170,000, marijuana, cocaine and more than 700 grams of heroin." Barr "said the 
investigation into the ring was part of Operation Legend, a project the U.S. Department of 
Justice launched this summer pairing federal agents and investigators with local and state 
police in nine U.S. cities, including Milwaukee, to address homicides and other violent crime." 
WITI-TV Milwaukee (9/22, Peterson, 159K) reports, "Officials say since Operation Legend's 
launch in July 2020, more than 3,500 arrests - including approximately 200 for homicide -
have been made; more than 1,000 firearms have been seized; and nearly 19 kilos of heroin, 
more than 11 kilos of fentanyl (enough to deliver more than five million fatal doses), more than 
94 kilos of methamphetamine, nearly 14 kilos of cocaine, and more than $6.5 million in drug 
proceeds have been seized. Of the more than 3,500 individuals arrested, approximately 815 
have been charged with federal offenses. More than 440 of those defendants have been 
charged with firearms offenses, while more than 300 have been charged with drug-related 
crimes. The remaining defendants have been charged with various offenses." 
Fox News (9/22, Betz, 27.59M) reports that Krueger "said state and local law enforcement 
officers arrested 21 of 26 suspects connected to the ring Tuesday morning. Officers in California 
and Milwaukee and seized about 33 firearms, $170,000 in cash, marijuana, cocaine, and more
