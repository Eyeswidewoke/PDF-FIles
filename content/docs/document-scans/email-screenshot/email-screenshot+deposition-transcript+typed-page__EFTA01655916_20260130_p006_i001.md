Ex-U.S. Soldier Charged in 'International Crime Spree' Extradited From Ukraine, Officials Say 
The Associated Press (06/03, Mattise) reported that a former U.S. soldier had been extradited from Ukraine on 
years-old charges that he went on an alleged "international crime spree including the 2018 killings and robbery of 
a couple in Florida to fund travel plans to Venezuela to wage military-style raids against its government, federal 
prosecutors announced Monday. The article added that authorities noted that 34-year-old Craig Austin Lang had 
faced federal indictments in Florida, North Carolina, and Arizona since 2019. The FBI brought Lang from Ukraine to 
the United States after the European Court of Human Rights rejected his claim challenging extradition, the release 
said. Lang, a U.S. citizen from Surprise, Arizona, pleaded not guilty in Florida on Monday, according to court 
documents. A DOJ press release quoted Executive Assistant Director Timothy Langan of the FBI's Criminal, Cyber, 
Response, and Services Branch, who said, "The alleged conduct of Craig Austin Lang, which includes homicide and 
armed robbery, will not be tolerated by the FBI, individuals that engage in such activity must face the consequences 
of their actions. We would like to thank our partner law enforcement agencies for their efforts in ensuring that 
criminals face justice. If you cause harm to the American public, we will relentlessly pursue you even if you are 
located beyond our borders." The New York Post (06/03, Gibbon), and BBC (06/03, Cabral) also reported on the 
story. 
University of Michigan Regent's Law Firm Vandalized in Antisemitic Attack That Police Chief Calls 'Horrific' 
The Associated Press (06/03, Williams) reported that pro-Palestinian graffiti spray-painted on the exterior of a 
Michigan law firm is being investigated as a hate crime, police in suburban Detroit said Monday. University of 
Michigan regent and attorney Jordan Acker called the vandalism "antisemitic" and said staff at the Goodman Acker 
law firm's Southfield headquarters discovered it Monday morning. According to the article, splotches of red paint 
were left on the "Goodman Acker" sign above the building's doors. "FREE PALESTINE" was spray-painted in black 
upon the building's walls, while "DIVEST NOW" and "U-M KILLS" — a reference to the University of Michigan —
were spray-painted in red upon at least one window and a sidewalk. Southfield Police Chief Elvin Barren said 
investigators believe the graffiti was left between 1:39 and 1:46 a.m. Monday. The FBI and other agencies are 
assisting in the investigation. CNN (06/03, Watson), M Live (06/03, Dodge), Business Insider (06/03, Goodwin), CBS 
News (06/03, Staff Writer), Michigan Daily (06/03, Baum), and the Detroit News (06/03, Mackay) also reported on 
the story. 
Rookie Police Officer Who Was Fatally Shot in Arizona Died on Duty Like His Dad Did 18 Years Earlier 
The Associated Press (06/03, Staff Writer) reported that Joshua Briese grew up in Montana wanting to work in law 
enforcement, just like his dad. He wasn't deterred even after his father died while on duty at age 38 in 2006. The 
article noted that Briese recently joined the Gila River Police Department, south of Phoenix, as a tribal police 
officer. He was still in field training and had been with the department for less than a year when he died Saturday 
while on duty, just like his dad. The 23-year-old was fatally shot in the pre-dawn hours Saturday while responding to 
a reported disturbance at a house party, according to the Gila River Indian Community. The article added that 
police said multiple gunshots were fired, striking Briese and another tribal police officer. The second officer was 
seriously injured but survived, police said. Four other people were also wounded, according to police, including one 
who later died. The other victims weren't immediately identified. The FBI in Phoenix said two suspects in the 
shooting, a man and a boy, were in custody, but no other information has been released. NBC News (06/03, Smith), 
Fox News (06/03, Coulter), and Arizona's Family (06/03, Bradley, Dominguez) also reported on the story. 
Continued Reporting: Aileen Cannon Hands Trump Deadline to Oppose Gag Order 
Newsweek (06/03, Fung) reported that U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon has given former President Donald 
Trump's lawyers a deadline to oppose the gag order that special counsel Jack Smith is pushing for in the classified 
documents case. The article noted that in a Sunday paperless order, Cannon, the Trump appointee overseeing the 
former president's classified documents case in Florida, set a mid-June deadline for Trump's legal team to respond 
to Smith's motion asking Cannon to modify Trump's bond conditions. The article mentioned that Smith has insisted 
that the judge impose a gag order on Trump, arguing that it is a necessary measure to protect law enforcement 
agents from the "significant, imminent, and foreseeable danger" that comes from the former president's public 
remarks. The article stated that Smith filed the motion on May 24, but Cannon had dismissed it after Trump's 
lawyers complained that the special counsel rushed to do so. She agreed that Smith failed to confer with the 
defense in a "meaningful" way and criticized the prosecution's filing for "wholly lacking in substance and 
professional courtesy." It was dismissed without prejudice, leading Smith to renew his efforts on Friday. Courthouse 
News Service (06/03, Garrison) also reported on the story.
