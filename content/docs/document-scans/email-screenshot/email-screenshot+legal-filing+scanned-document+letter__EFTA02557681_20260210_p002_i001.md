The question of whether Cubela was a double agent persisted for three =ecades and was only answered when Miguel 
Mir, who served in Castro's =ecurity office from 1986 to 1992, defected. He told the CIA that he =ad personally reviewed 
Cubela's file, and it showed that Cubela was =orking as a double agent under the control of Cuban intelligence from =he 
time when he allowed himself to be recruited in Brazil. 
His real mission was to ascertain whether President Kennedy was behind =he CIA plots — hence his request to meet 
with his brother and have =ords scripted by Cuban intelligence put in JFK's Miami speech. If =o, Castro knew 1) CIA 
officers in Brazil were recruiting an assassin =o kill him 2) the CIA was prepared to deliver an exotic assassination 
=eapon, and 3) the CIA was supported by President Kennedy. 
What Castro knew about Lee Harvey Oswald is less clear. During his stay =n Mexico City between September 27 and 
October 2, 1963, Oswald made at =east two visits to the Cuban Embassy. To convince the Cubans of his =ona fides —
and seriousness — he had prepared a 10-page dossier on =imself, according to the testimony of his wife, Marina. This 
resume =ncluded photographs he had taken of General Walker's home just prior =o Oswald's attempt to assassinate him 
with a high-powered rifle. So =he Cubans could have known that Oswald was a potential assassin with a =igh-powered 
rifle. 
When the Cuban Consul argued with him over the requisites he would need =or a Cuban visa, Oswald reportedly made 
claims about services he might =erform for the Cuban cause. According to the 2009 book Brothers in =rms: The 
Kennedys, the Castros, and the Politics of Murder, by Gus =usso and Stephen Molton, Oswald then met with at least one 
Cuban =ntelligence officer outside the embassy. Whatever was said in or =utside the embassy, Oswald's file, presumably 
containing this =nformation, was sent to Havana in support of his application, which =as conditionally granted. 
Five months after the assassination, Castro told Jack Childs, a courier =or the Communist Party USA, that Oswald had 
shouted in the Cuban =mbassy in Mexico that he was going to kill Kennedy. Unknown to Castro, =hilds was working as 
an informant for the FBI and duly reported his =onversation with Castro to US intelligence. 
While Castro's statement coincided with what other witnesses in the =mbassy claimed to have overheard, it was not 
evidence Castro had prior =nowledge. He could have been briefed on Oswald's file after the =ssassination. But if this 
threat was in Oswald's file, why was =swald's visa approved? 
Brian Latell now addresses this question in Castro's Secrets: The CIA =nd Cuba's Intelligence Machine. He reveals that 
Florentino =spillaga, who defected from Cuban intelligence in 1987, and whom he =nterviewed, told the CIA that just 
hours before Kennedy was =ssassinated on November 22, 1963, he had received an extraordinary =rder from the high 
command of Cuban intelligence when he was in charge =f the communications unit located near Castro's compound. 
Up until then, his unit had focused its antennae on Miami to monitor =landestine radio transmissions from anti-Castro 
groups. But now he was =nstructed to redirect all his antennae to Texas and report immediately =ny transmissions of 
interest. He assumed from his conversations with =is superiors that they had been desperately seeking a transmission 
=rom Texas. Latell deduces from this shift that Cuban intelligence had =rior knowledge of the Kennedy assassination. 
Such a conclusion, however, requires a leap about the purpose of the =hift. It is possible that it was not related to 
Oswald or the Kennedy =ssassination. Cuban intelligence may merely have been awaiting a burst =ransmission from an 
asset in Texas who had no connection with Oswald. =ut if Castro did have advance knowledge about Oswald, he had 
little =eason to stop him since he also knew by this time Kennedy;s CIA had =tans to kill him. Until we have further 
information about the =ctivities of Cuban intelligence on November 22, 1963, the antennae =hift, along with the visa 
approval, will remain a central part of the =ystery
