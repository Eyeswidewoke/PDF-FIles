those years serving as the senior scientist on the FBI's forensic response section within the lab division, where he 
also investigated Covid's origins. He retired in 2022, and has now spoken up as a private citizen to counter what he 
called inaccurate claims that Covid emerged naturally. The article noted that an FBI spokesperson said in a 
statement: "The FBI has long assessed that the origin of the Covid pandemic was likely a laboratory incident in 
Wuhan. Led by the FBI's Weapons of Mass Destruction Directorate, work began in early 2020 when FBI experts in 
such fields as virology, immunology, microbiology, biochemistry, and forensics began examining this issue. FBI 
agents and analysts studied intelligence and conducted over 200 interviews of more than 80 people since the 
beginning of the pandemic." 
Opinion: President Trump Should Not Be Afraid to Fire People at the FBI 
An opinion piece by the Washington Examiner (03/03, Papillon) stated that when a new president takes office, he 
gets to determine who will head the departments in and around the executive branch. However, people within the 
departments are often holdovers from previous administrations and may be hostile to the current president's 
agenda. The author noted that Elon Musk summed it up in a Feb. 28 post on X. The author quoted Elon, who 
said, "Imagine if you were suddenly appointed AG or head of the FBI. You were just thrown on a ship with a hostile 
crew. Until you appoint some new crew members and figure out the ropes, you can't steer the ship effectively. It's 
literally impossible." The author added that a president needs to have his Cabinet on his side if he wants to be 
effective. The author mentioned that in light of the recent disappointment regarding the release of the Jeffery 
Epstein files, Attorney General Pam Bondi called on Director Patel to release the entirety of the files. According to 
the author, it is likely not AG Bondi or Director Patel's fault that there were delays in releasing the files. Assuming 
AG Bondi and Director Patel are genuine in their attempts to release the files, those within their departments 
should take the blame. The author claimed that it is time for AG Bondi and Director Patel to take a deep look at the 
DOJ and the FBI and examine if anyone is involved in delaying the files' release. The author claimed that FBI agents 
can't be fired without just cause, but defying orders likely would qualify as such a cause.
