offences after Abdullakh Anzorov, 18, killed the teacher with a 30cm knife on Friday." Anzorov

US Military Quietly Helping Taliban Fight Isis In Afghanistan. 
The Washington Post (10/22, 14.2M) reports that "the U.S. military has been quietly helping 
the Taliban to weaken the Islamic State in its Konar stronghold and keep more of the country 
from falling into the hands" of ISIS, according to various sources. Unlike the Taliban, the US 
views ISIS "as an international terrorist organization with aspirations to strike America and 
Europe." The US coordinates with the Taliban merely "by observing battle conditions and 
listening in on the group." The Konar operations reflect the "outsourcing of what has long been 
a core U.S. military mission - fighting the Islamic State and al-Qaeda - to the uneasily 
coordinated forces of the Afghan government and the Taliban, with U.S. counterterrorism forces 
in some cases helping both." 
COUNTER-INTELLIGENCE 
Schumer, Wyden Urge FBI Not To Probe Biden Family Prior To Election. 
Fox News (10/22, 27.59M) reports, "Sens. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. 
wrote a letter to FBI Director Christopher Wray demanding the FBI 'reject pressure' to 
investigate the Biden family after the Hunter Biden email story from the New York Post. 'The 
FBI must reject pressure from Donald Trump to announce investigations of Joe Biden or his 
family to influence the presidential election, or else it risks doing lasting harm to our democracy 
and national security,' a news release of the letter read. 'We are deeply concerned about the 
possibility that in response to these reports the Trump Administration will take actions before 
Election Day that would seek to damage the Democratic presidential candidate and undermine 
the rule of law,' Wyden and Schumer wrote in their letter. 'In carrying out this critical national 
security mission, law enforcement's handling of this matter must be above politics and beyond 
reproach,' the lawmakers wrote." 
NBC News (10/22, 6.14M) reports, "They referred in a press release to 'a widely 
questioned article in the New York Post, that alleged to have obtained stolen Hunter Biden 
emails from the president's lawyer Rudy Giuliani' and noted that Trump has called on the 
Justice Department to investigate. They are urging Wray 'to resist pressure from President 
Trump and other partisan actors to take any actions intended to benefit President Trump 
politically on the eve of the election. Succumbing to such pressure would deeply undermine our 
national security interests and the credibility of law enforcement, and could have devastating 
consequences for the resiliency of our democracy.'"

were putting the Biden family name and its legacy on the line." 
White House Deputy Press Secretary Brian Morgenstern said on Newsmax TVVI (10/22),

name with foreign entities, with foreign powers, and that we may have Chinese energy deals
