America was not alone in embarking on a debt spree. In Britain household debt rose from 105% of disposable 
income in 2000 to 160% in 2008, according to the McKinsey Global Institute, and in Spain the ratio rose from 
69% to 130% over the same period. Only in the past couple of years have consumers paused for breath. In 
America the volume of consumer credit in 2009 declined by 4.4%. By March this year the annual growth rate had 
crept up only to 1%. In Britain credit-card lending fell in eight of the 16 months between January 2009 and April 
2010. 
In part, this is because consumers in many countries have become more frugal in response to the recession and 
the decline in house prices. In America houses turned into cash machines during the credit boom as people 
remortgaged to release equity and boost their spending. Mortgage equity withdrawal rose from less than $20 
billion a quarter in 1997 to more than $140 billion in some quarters of 2005 and 2006. After 2007 it slowed 
abruptly and even went negative (homeowners paid down debt) in 2009. Consumers are also more cautious about 
borrowing in view of sluggish wage growth and rising unemployment in most of the developed world. 
In part, too, borrowing has slowed down dramatically because lenders have become much more chary about 
extending consumer credit. A survey by the Federal Reserve in October 2008, when the financial crisis was at its 
peak, found that 60% of banks had reduced credit-card limits for both new and existing customers. Like mortgage 
lenders, credit-card companies found they had allowed lending standards to drop too far. This spring the default 
rate on American credit cards was a record 13%, according to Fitch. 
How do lenders decide whether consumers are creditworthy? In America one of the key determinants is an 
individual's FICO score, named after the Fair Isaac Corporation, which devised it. The idea goes back decades, to a 
time when small retailers, which needed to offer credit, pooled information on which customers were good and 
bad payers. These days the bulk of the information is provided by banks and lenders such as credit-card 
companies. This is translated into a score ranging from 350 to 800, with the most creditworthy customers getting 
the highest rating. 
Life's new essentials 
Andy Jennings of FICO says that customers' rankings remain remarkably steady over time; the best payers 
remain the best payers. What does change is the level of bad debts across all categories when the economy hits a 
recession. During the subprime-lending boom mortgages were offered to borrowers with lower FICO scores than in 
the past. An updated version of the FICO model, to reflect the subprime crisis, was released last year. 
The crisis has brought about one big change in consumer behaviour. The mortgage used to be the last debt 
people would default on. They did not want to lose their homes or to forfeit the substantial deposit they had had 
to find. But during the subprime boom many borrowers were able to buy homes without putting down any money, 
which changed their attitude. In effect, they were renting with an option to profit from higher house prices. 
In the current recession some borrowers have given priority to their credit-card and car loans rather than their 
mortgages. After all, they can usually find a new home to rent. But without a car many of them cannot get to 
work and without a credit card they find it hard to shop. 
Perhaps the housing crash will change attitudes towards home ownership. For a long time it seemed like a one-
way bet, with homeowners able to buy an appreciating asset with cheap debt. Having realised that prices can fall 
as well as rise and that houses are illiquid assets, many more people may opt for the greater flexibility of renting 
and hold their wealth in more diversified forms. That is what happens in Germany, which has a much lower rate of 
home ownership than Britain or America. 
Meanwhile, those who have maxed out their credit cards have been forced to turn elsewhere. One very expensive 
route is payday loans. As Jean Ann Fox of the Consumer Federation of America explains, this involves the 
borrower writing a cheque to the lender for the sum borrowed, plus the financing cost, which the lender cashes on 
payday. Over two weeks the cost works out at around $15 of interest for every $100 borrowed, which amounts to 
an annual interest rate of 400%. People who use the facility average nine payday loans annually, so they can end 
up paying more in interest than they have borrowed.
