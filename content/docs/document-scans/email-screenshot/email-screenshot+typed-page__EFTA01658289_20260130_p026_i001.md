and routers that forward traffic to the antennas." The Portuguese government has so far "not 
taken a stance, but Infrastructure Minister Pedro Nuno Santos told Reuters it has `no `a priori' 
issues with any manufacturer" Nuno Santos "revealed that a group created by the Portuguese 
government to assess risks and cybersecurity issues relating to 5G had completed its work and 
had not drawn any conclusions directed against any particular supplier." 
Hackers Post Fake Stories On Real News Sites. 
BBC News Online (yl) (7/30, 1.02M) reports a cyber-security firm has "warned hackers have 
broken into real news websites and posted fake stories stirring up anti-NATO sentiment." 
According to FireEye researchers, "the disinformation campaign, nicknamed `ghostwriter' has 
been ongoing since 2017." They "said that it is designed to `chip away' at support for NATO in 
Lithuania, Latvia, and Poland." While the false stories "are `aligned with Russian security 
interests,' it is not known who is behind the attack." FireEye "said that the disinformation 
campaign uses `falsified news articles, quotes, correspondence and other documents designed 
to appear as coming from military officials and political figures in the target countries." In some 
cases, false news stories "were posted on real news websites without permission." 
The Guardian (ILK). (7/30, 4.19M) reports part of the campaign - labeled `Ghostwriter' -
"involved gaining access to news sites publishing systems, deleting stories and replacing them 
with false news that sought to delegitimize the transatlantic alliance." In one example, a 
Lithuanian news site "was compromised last September and a false article was inserted into its 
archive wrongly claiming that German soldiers serving with NATO had desecrated a Jewish 
cemetery." A series of Polish sites in May "were targeted and stories published with fake quotes 
attributed to the commander of the US army in Europe, in which he was said to have ridiculed 
the capability of the Polish military." Emails purporting to be "from a local news service with 
links to the doctored articles were then sent out to other media and public institutions in an 
attempt to disseminate the fakes and give them further credibility." 
Gallagher Says Pentagon Needs Access To Defense Companies' Networks To Hunt 
Cyberthreats. 
C4ISR & Networks (7/30, Pomerleau) reports that, according to one of the leaders of the Cyber 
Solarium Commission, the Pentagon "must be able to hunt cyberthreats on the private 
networks of defense companies in order to strengthen national cybersecurity." Rep. Mike 
Gallagher (R-WI) who co-chairs the commission, "said in testimony before the House Armed 
Services Subcommittee on Intelligence and Emerging Threats and Capabilities that there must 
be greater visibility of these networks, in which much sensitive and classified information is 
kept." He said, "I think one of our biggest findings in the report was that while we are getting a 
better awareness of our own systems, we still - down to the level of some of our DOD 
contractors, subcontractors, all the small companies that work with the big defense primes -
don't have the level of visibility on the threat picture and the security of their networks that we 
need." 
Op-Ed: US Must Prevent Foreign Cyber Attacks On Texas Energy Infrastructure. 
In an op-ed in the Houston Chronicle (7/30, 730K), Rep. Will Hurd (R-TX) writes, "A company 
owned by a member of the Chinese Communist Party — Guanghui Energy Company — may gain 
access to our power grid through a large wind farm in the Devil's River Areas of West Texas, 
and the federal government is not moving fast enough to prevent it, and the state government 
lacks the power to stop it. ... When the Texas utility sector deregulated...those involved did not 
predict a company friendly with a hostile foreign government would try to connect to our power 
grid." He concludes, "The US and our allies are scrambling to prevent Huawei from infiltrating 
telecommunications networks globally. We must act to prevent a similar scenario in our power 
markets."
