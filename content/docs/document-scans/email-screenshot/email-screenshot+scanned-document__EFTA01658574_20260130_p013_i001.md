intelligence operations," and Assistant DNI for Strategic Communications Amanda Shoch said 
Ratcliffe's "top priority is our nation's security." 
Meanwhile, the Washington Times (10/8, Blake, 492K) reports Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D-MI), 
who before being elected to Congress served in the CIA and in the Office of the Director of 
National Intelligence, wrote to Ratcliffe criticizing him "over concerns about his recent handling 
of classified information." Slotkin asked Ratcliffe to testify about the issue, and "pointed out Mr. 
Ratcliffe seems to be politicizing intelligence for Mr. Trump's benefit, particularly with respect to

Johnson: Intelligence Committee Covering Up Coup Attempt. In an op-ed for the

Commentary: Clinton, Obama "Colluded" In 2016, But No Crime. 
In commentary for The Hill (10/8, 2.98M), National Review Institute Senior Fellow Andrew C. 
McCarthy writes President Trump "did himself no favors with Wednesday's ALL-CAPS tweet 
about how the latest disclosures from Director of National Intelligence (DNI) John Ratcliffe 
implicate President Obama, Vice President Biden and Hillary Clinton in a 'TREASONOUS PLOT." 
McCarthy writes that the documents "corroborate Ratcliffe's revelation, in a Sept. 29 letter to 
Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham, to wit: In late July 2016, Russian intelligence 
assessed that Mrs. Clinton approved her campaign advisers' proposal to blame Moscow's 
hacking of Democratic National Committee (DNC) emails on a conspiracy between Donald 
Trump and Vladimir Putin." However, even if true, "what is the crime?" McCarthy argues that 
the "real 'collusions" was between Clinton and the Obama administration, but stresses that no 
crime has been proven.

discuss the document request." The article says the letter is "a follow up to one the senators

Hurricane, the bureau's investigation of Trump associates' possible links to Russia."
