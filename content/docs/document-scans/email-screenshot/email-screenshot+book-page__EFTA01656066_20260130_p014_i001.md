A person posing as Abbott's new chief of staff in July attempted to set up a phony phone call between Luna and 
Abbott regarding Luna's re-election effort, according to screenshots of a text conversation. The article added 
that Luna said she believes the scheme was concocted by a liberal PAC that has targeted fellow lawmakers, 
including Colorado Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert. The article mentioned that Luna said she contacted the 
FBI, local sheriff's office and police regarding the threatening messages. The sheriff's office confirmed that it is 
investigating the matter. The FBI said when asked about the matter that under DOJ policy, it "can neither confirm 
nor deny the existence of a specific investigation," as the agency cannot "comment on complaints or tips we may or 
may not receive from the public." 
FBI in Search of Vendors for Facial Recognition Capabilities 
ExecutiveGov (09/17, Henry) reported that the FBI is conducting market research to identify qualified sources that 
can provide advanced facial recognition technology for its law enforcement operations. According to the 
article, FRT enables the development of investigative leads and detection of relevant case information, which could 
prove critical to catching perpetrators and mitigating threats, the agency said Monday. Through the request for 
information, the FBI wants to hear from parties with existing open-source and publicly available face image 
repositories and functioning FR capabilities to search the same database. The article stated that the potential 
vendors should also ensure they can deliver the required capabilities in a software-as-a-service package. The FBI 
envisions that open-source FRT would support its mission of safeguarding national security, protecting the 
American people and upholding the Constitution. The data gathered through the RFI will inform the Bureau's 
acquisition approach for an upcoming solicitation. Biometric Update (09/17, Burt) also reported on the story. 
Continued Reporting: AI, The Workplace And Inclusion: Insights From Altman, Gates And Oprah 
Forbes (09/17, Cox) reported that Oprah Winfrey had a challenging assignment with her recent "Al and the Future 
of Us" TV special. She had to help a broad TV audience understand complex technology, reveal and clarify how the 
technology would impact her audiences' day-to-day lives, and spark curiosity that could help the audience prepare 
for a fantastic yet scary future world. The show did a great job explaining some of the fundamentals of Al. However, 
Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, the first interview guest, offered few specifics about the future impact of Al. Microsoft 
founder Bill Gates provided more specific answers on that subject later in the show. According to the article, the 
overall show itself was more inclusive than Al. There was a definite mix of Al advocates, critics, and those in the 
middle. In addition to technology leaders like Altman and Gates, Oprah interviewed Tristan Harris and Aza Raskin 
from the Center for Humane Technology, Director Wray, YouTuber Marques Brownlee, chaplain Kaiser Aslam, and 
Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist and essayist Marilynne Robinson.
