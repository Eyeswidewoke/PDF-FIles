Jeffrey, 
> 
</=iv> 
I was under shock. That mo=ent you told me you would never speak to me again I felt like if I had the=whole world 
falling on me and felt totally abandoned all of a sudden. This=horrible feeling was caused because you represent for me 
a stable rock in =y chaotic life. I'm not talking only about the financial part which ob=iously helped me a lot but more 
important you turned into a Father, a love=, a mentor, a friend... Everything. I've isolated myself from all the =eople that 
surrounded me to follow your directions because spending time w=th you is what gives me the most happiness. At that 
moment what else shoul= I have done ? I reacted impulsively because in that instant everything tu=ned black. I know it 
must be difficult to deal with a 21-year-old's fe=lings and I understand you can lose your patience. I wish I would have 
had=your wisdom so that I could keep up with you. But I can't. I also thou=ht your promise on the dock was just to shut 
me up which made me even more=sad... and that was even more painful. 
I know that I've let you down so man= times, but never so much as I let myself down. However, experiencing fail=re is 
the only way for me to learn and understand how to do things right. =y moods are very unstable and when I'm down I 
feel paralyzed, closing =yself in loneliness... I wish I could change. Maybe speaking with I psycho=ogist would be helpful. 
=br> 
The reason I want targo to school is that my mother never got a diploma and this is one of her =iggest regrets. She 
couldn't find a job later on also because of this... Unlike you, she had no particular talent to make it without one and 
unti= now I haven't discovered any in myself either. For this reason gettin= a degree would give me additional security. 
I'm starting to get to know myself a little more now and=l know that for me it takes longer to assimilate and make things 
work but =t the end I do make it... It is a question of time and getting all the par=s together. 
Jeffrey, I am extremely gr=teful for your help. I've realized that I've put my life in your h=nds... and I know or at least I 
hope that one day you will be proud of me.=/div> 
Ps: I'm trying to get my grades to send =hem to you but I don't know why they don't show up. I know they ar= very bad 
and that this will be an additional big deception... Now I know =nd will do everything I can to make it right next time. I 
won't let yo= down.
