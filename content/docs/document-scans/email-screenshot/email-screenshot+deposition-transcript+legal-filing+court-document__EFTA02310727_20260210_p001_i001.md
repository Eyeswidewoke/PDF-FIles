Re: 
I currently have Kraft Maid cabinets which Pm very happy with and a =ubZero fridge. If you want, we can move all my 
appliances from 14G =itchen to the new apt and you can replace 14G with Ikea appliances. 
I have charcoal grey cabinets, but thinking of changing to a natural =ood color; I will confirm the color early next week 
and choose the =ounter top color, etc.

ice maker =nd water dispenser) Used it a few times and have had no problems. All =his is on IKEAs website. No problem 
to move the bathroom fixtures from =4G to 111( we may need to order a new shower body however) Will you be

someone staying in there now and she says it =till has an unpleasant smell to it. I agree.. it still has the smell =very time I 
go in there. So I have to check again if you have another =pt we can possibly switch it with? I don't want to renovate the 
whole =hing if it's going to have a strange smell the whole time.

well thought out. I'd =ike to use California Closets for the finishing of them. If they aren't =lready built out larger, I will 
need them to be. I'd like to do the =ame baseboards as 2G. I have all the tiles and finishes in mind for the =athroom and 
kitchen already. The kitchen I'd like the same layout, but =ossibly different color scheme.l'd like to put in the 
washer/dryer unit =nstead of a dishwasher. I have a whole list of things I have done to =y apt that I would like to 
replicate: I have double thick windows in =he bedroom for sound insulation, track lighting on the ceiling in =edroom and 
living room. If possible, I'd like to put a ceiling fan in =he bedroom. Light plank hardwood floors(l'm sourcing now) 
venetian =laster on all the walls(' will have the same guy do 11J as did 14G) =isal carpet in bedroom(same as the one I 
have now), I had my own guy =ake a very nice radiator cover in the living room with drawers which I =ill have him do the 
same for 11J in living room and bedroom. That would =e great to have the bathroom fixtures moved to new apt; will 
that work =ith the valves, etc? The brand is Dorn Braht.
