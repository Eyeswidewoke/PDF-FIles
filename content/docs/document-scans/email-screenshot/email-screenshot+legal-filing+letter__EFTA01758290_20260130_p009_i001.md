The April employment numbers are in and after a disappointing March report 
in which only 88,000 jobs were added to the US economy, the Department of 
Labor said that the nation added 165,000 jobs and unemployment fell to 
7.5%; a solid job creation in April. What is truly encouraging is that 
this positive news comes in the shadow of the sequester's automatic 
spending cuts, causing federal government employment (excluding postal 
service) to fall by 4,900. On top of this the new report revised the March 
numbers up from 88,000 to a healthier 138,000, suggesting that the labor 
market isn't slumping as much as it had appeared. Many of the details of 
the new report also point to a steady job market: The drop in the 
unemployment rate, for example, was driven by more people finding jobs, not 
by people leaving the labor force. Some 293,000 more people described 
themselves as employed in a survey of households, and 93,000 fewer said 
they were looking for a job but couldn't find one. The ratio of the 
population with a job ticked up to 58.6 percent, from 58.5 percent. And 
the number of long-term unemployed, those out of work and looking for a job 
for more than 27 weeks, fell by 258,000. * Good news I say....* 
Some of the numbers were disappointing such as, the average workweek fell 
to 34.4 hours, from 34.6 hours, suggesting businesses are relying on 
part-time workers and possibly reflecting the impact of the sequester. And 
a broader measure of unemployment, capturing people who have given up 
looking for a job out of frustration and those who are working part-time 
but want full-time work, actually rose to 13.9 percent from 13.8 percent. 
But the good news is that the job gains were concentrated entirely in 
private-sector service industries: Manufacturing employment was flat and 
construction was down. Government employment at all levels--federal, state 
and local--declined as well. And the bright spots for job creation 
included professional and business services, which added 73,000 positions, 
and leisure and hospitality, which added 43,000 jobs. We often hear the 
bad news, but Friday's jobs numbers is solid evidence that the US economy 
is rebounding. Add to the employment numbers, housing prices posted sharp 
gains across the country, with 15-year fixed home loans at an all-time low 
of 2.67%. So why are we not celebrating? And why isn't Congress not doing 
more to push job growth. Especially when every economist will tell you 
that because of the upward momentum, if the government moved forward with 
an aggressive government jobs program, jobs growth could easily double and 
unemployment dipping another 1% - hence back to a healthy economy. *T=is 
is not rocket science 
 Just common sense
