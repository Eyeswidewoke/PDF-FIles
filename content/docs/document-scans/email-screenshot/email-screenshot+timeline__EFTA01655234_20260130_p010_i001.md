investigations and operations that target every facet of transnational organized crime groups. "We want to target 
the entire enterprise," explained Mike, a supervisory special agent who serves as the FBI's program coordinator for 
the TOC-West assistant legal attaches (ALATs), vetted teams, and training. He's also an FBI liaison to the U.S. 
Department of Defense. "They have—as part of their own agencies—their own command structure, their own 
lieutenants, their own captains," Mike said of our international law enforcement partners who serve on TOC-West 
vetted teams. "But the FBI Criminal Investigative Division ALAT, as an advisor to the team, can provide guidance and 
direction?' The article stated that the TOC West Operations Unit within the FBI's Criminal Investigative Division 
(CID) oversees 17 ALATs in eight countries. The unit's work focuses primarily on transnational organized crime 
investigations. The FBI's International Operations Division, which manages the Bureau's overall ALAT program 
worldwide, provides additional oversight and operational support. 
DSS, FBI, and Ghana Police Collaborate to Extradite Alleged Romance Scam Leader 
Graphic Online (07/01, Zurek) reported that the U.S. Diplomatic Security Service (DSS) has confirmed that its 
special agents stationed at the United States Embassy in Accra collaborated with Ghanaian authorities to assist the 
FBI in the extradition of Joseph Kwadwo Badu Boateng, also known as "Dada Joe Remix." According to the article, 
in a Facebook post, the DSS stated, "Diplomatic Security Service special agents at U.S. Embassy Ghana worked with 
Ghanaian authorities to assist the FBI in the extradition of Joseph Badu Boateng aka Dada Joe Remix. Boateng was 
indicted on charges of running a fraud ring that used romance and inheritance schemes to defraud U.S. victims of 
several million dollars. The subject is now in the United States to face justice." Boateng was arrested in Ghana on 
May 28, 2025, following an extradition request from the United States based on an unsealed indictment issued by 
a grand jury in the District of Arizona. He is charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to 
commit money laundering. The Guardian Nigeria (07/01, Staff Writer) also reported on the story.

OTHER FBI NEWS 
FBI Supervisor Hired Prostitutes While on Assignment, Watchdog Says 
The Washington Post (07/01, Hawkins) reported that an FBI supervisory special agent solicited and had sex with 
prostitutes on numerous occasions while on assignment, violating Justice Department and FBI policy. According to 
the article, the agent misused an FBI-issued device to pay for the encounters and failed to self-report contact with 
foreign nationals, including those they paid for sex. The article noted that the inspector general's investigation 
substantiated the allegations, but criminal prosecution was declined, and it is unclear if disciplinary action was 
taken against the agent. Representatives from the FBI and DOJ headquarters did not immediately respond to 
requests for comment. The Independent reported that when asked about the investigation, the FBI told the outlet 
Tuesday, "While we cannot comment on specific employee matters, all FBI employees are held to the highest 
standards of professional and ethical conduct. "Allegations of misconduct are taken seriously and referred to the 
Inspection Division or the Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General;' the agency said. "After reviewing 
relevant information on misconduct, the FBI took appropriate action to uphold our standards of integrity. Through 
the disciplinary process, the FBI will continue to hold employees accountable for any substantiated misconduct." 
Mystery Surrounds the Jeffrey Epstein Files After AG Bondi Claims 'Tens of Thousands' of Videos 
The Associated Press (07/01, Tucker, Richer) reported that it was a surprising statement from Attorney General Pam 
Bondi as the Trump administration promises to release more files from its sex trafficking investigation of Jeffrey 
Epstein: The FBI, she said, was reviewing "tens of thousands of videos" of the wealthy financier "with children or 
child pom." According to the article, the comment, made to reporters at the White House days after a similar 
remark to a stranger with a hidden camera, raised the stakes for President Donald Trump's administration to prove 
it has in its possession previously unseen compelling evidence. That task is all the more pressing after an earlier 
document dump that Bondi hyped angered elements of Trump's base by failing to deliver new bombshells and as 
administration officials who had promised to unlock supposed secrets of the so-called government "deep state" 
struggle to fulfill that pledge. The article mentioned that the Associated Press spoke with lawyers and law 
enforcement officials in criminal cases of Epstein and socialite former girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell who said they 
hadn't seen and didn't know of a trove of recordings like what Bondi described. Indictments and detention memos 
do not reference the existence of videos of Epstein with children, and neither was charged with possession of child 
sex abuse material even though that offense would have been much easier to prove than the sex trafficking counts 
they faced.
