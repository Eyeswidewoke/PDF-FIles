others who we did not intend to target." 
COUNTER-INTELLIGENCE
Former FBI Agent Strzok Publishing Book In September About Trump, Russia. 
The AP (7/28, Tucker) reports former FBI counterintelligence agent Peter Strzok "is releasing a 
book on his concerns the president could be compromised." Publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt 
Books & Media "said in a statement that the book, `Compromised: Counterintelligence and the 
Threat of Donald J. Trump,' is due out September 8." The book will offer "an insider's view on 
some of the most sensational and politically freighted investigations in modern American 
history, including into whether the 2016 Trump campaign coordinated with Russia to sway the 
presidential election." Strzok said Tuesday in a statement accompanying the book 
announcement, "Russia has long regarded the US as its `Main Enemy,' and I spent decades 
trying to protect our country from their efforts to weaken and undermine us." 
The Hill (7/28, Scully, 2.98M) reports the book is expected "to provide an insider's view on 
some of the most notable and politically infamous investigations in modern American history, 
including the investigation into whether the Trump campaign coordinated with Russia to 
influence the presidential election." Also reporting on the story is Axios (7/28, Allassan, 521K). 
Declassified Senate Intelligence Report Highlights Doubts About Steele Dossier. 
Fox News (7/28, Olson, 27.59M) reports a declassified report from the Senate Intelligence 
Committee "released on Wednesday revealed internal conversations about the notorious Steele 
dossier between the FBI and CIA during the writing of an Intelligence Community Assessment 
(ICA) on Russian election interference and potential collusion between the Trump campaign and 
Russia during the 2016 presidential election." The Steele dossier was "at the center of the 
applications for FISA warrants against former Trump advisor Carter Page for alleged ties to 
Russia." The report, the "fourth in a series of such releases by Senate Republicans, adds more 
detail to information previously reported by Horowitz." The report reinforces the "deep divide 
regarding how much stock the IC put into the Steele information well before the three renewals 
of the Page FISA warrants, and that those in the FBI were rather uncritical of Steele's 
reliability." 
The Daily Caller (7/28, Ross, 716K) reports the documents "detail an intense debate 
between the CIA and FBI in late 2016 over the handling of information from Christopher Steele, 
with one CIA official telling the Senate Intelligence Committee that the former British spy's 
allegations about Trump-Russia collusion were `very unvetted." Despite the CIA's "concerns 
about Steele's allegations, the FBI successfully lobbied to include his information in an 
Intelligence Community Assessment (ICA) regarding Russian interference in the 2016 election." 
The bureau also continued "using information from Steele to conduct surveillance against 
former Trump campaign aide Carter Page." 
Jarrett Says It "Makes Sense" Steele's Source Worked At The Brookings 
Institution. Fox News (7/28, Musto, 27.59M) reports Fox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett 
"said Tuesday that the primary source for former British spy Christopher Steele's unverified 
dossier working for the Brookings Institution research group `makes sense." In an interview on 
`Fox & Friends,' Jarrett "explained that he had previously run into former Brookings Institution 
senior research analyst Igor Danchenko's name several times." He said, "I could never piece it 
together. Because frankly...it is so wild and stupid that Steele's source was not from Russia but 
- it's a guy in Washington, DC working for the liberal Brookings Institution. Now, it sort of 
makes sense because the president of Brookings at the time was Strobe Talbott: [a] long-time
