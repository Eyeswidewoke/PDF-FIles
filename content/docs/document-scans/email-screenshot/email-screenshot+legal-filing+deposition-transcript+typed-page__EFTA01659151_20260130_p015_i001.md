UK Man Who Hacked Webcams In 39 Countries Avoids Extradition To US. 
The Guardian (UK) (12/7, 4.19M) reports, "A 58-year-old man from Wigan who hacked into 
hundreds of webcams in dozens of countries has avoided extradition to the US after a judge 
ruled that it was not in the interests of justice." Christopher Taylor, "a full-time carer for his wife 
of 38 years, had faced up to 20 years in a US prison after he was charged with wire fraud and 
two counts of computer fraud in Georgia," but "on Monday a judge at Westminster magistrates 
court blocked the extradition, ruling that because of Taylor's strong family links in the UK, any 
prosecution for the offences should take place here." District judge Michael Fanning "also said 
that Taylor's extradition would breach both his and his wife's human rights, on the basis that 
disrupting his care for her would amount to a disproportionate interference with both of their 
Article 8 rights to a family life." 
Canadian Police Officer Says He Was FBI's Point Of Contact During Huawei CFO 
Arrest. 
Reuters (12/7, Berman) reports, "A police officer stationed at Vancouver's airport on the day" 
Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou "was arrested two years ago testified on Monday he found himself 
to be in a 'very uncomfortable position' as the point of contact" for the FBI. Royal Canadian 
Mounted Police (RCMP) Sergeant Ross Lundie testified, "At the end of the day, I'm not there to 
provide information and act on behalf of the FBI. I'm there working as an RCMP member." 
Lundie added, "Assisting the FBI, given my background - this is a very uncomfortable position 
to be in." In court, "Lundie testified that he was concerned about the appearance of collusion 
between the CBSA and the RCMP in the lead up to Meng's arrest. He told the court it was 
`reasonable' for CBSA to secure Meng's electronic devices in Mylar bags - which block all signals 
- before the RCMP arrested her." 
Business In Vancouver (CAN) (12/7, Chiang) reports that Lundie "said he has had contact 
with various law enforcement agencies throughout his career - and may have answered 
questions from the FBI on the Meng case's operations." However, he "emphasized that such 
contact was coincidental - that his main role was to serve the RCMP and assist in the 
operations of the police's central financial crimes unit." Defense lawyer Richard Peck "accused 
the RCMP sergeant of trying to cover up his role in having contact with the FBI throughout the 
case, noting the lack of the mentioning of the U.S. investigative agency in any of his written 
notes or legal Will Say." Peck also attacked "Lundie's lack of useful notes in the arrest process, 
to which the RCMP officer responded by admitting he should take better notes." 
NSA Warns Russia-Backed Hackers Are Exploiting VMware Products. 
Reuters (12/7, Bing) reports that a new NSA cybersecurity alert "warns that Russian 'state-
sponsored' hackers are actively exploiting a software vulnerability in multiple products made by 
cloud computing company VMware Inc." The agency "said organizations should apply `as soon 
as possible' a software patch provided by the company on Saturday." Hackers would be able to 
"execute operating system commands remotely on the infected device, allowing for the theft or 
corruption of data." VMware separately warns "that the hackers would first need to gain access 
to a user's account through a stolen password to fully take advantage of the vulnerability." 
Bloomberg (12/7, Sebenius, 4.73M) reports that the advisory warned "Russia was using 
the flaw to 'access protected data." The warning comes after a recent DHS alert "about Iranian 
hackers - saying that they are becoming more sophisticated and improving their offensive 
arsenal, leading to the possibility of `cyber-enabled kinetic attacks' in the future." A December 3 
CISA notice warned "Iranian actors are defacing web pages, taking sites offline by flooding 
them with traffic, stealing personal data and conducting influence operations on social media."
