Chinese institutions. `These alleged actions came to light through the tireless work of the FBI-
Bryan Resident Agency and NASA-OIG investigative teams,' said Perrye K. Turner, FBI Houston 
Special Agent in Charge." Courthouse News (8/24, Langford, 2K) , KBTX-TV College Station, TX 
(8/24, DeMoss, 91K) , and the Washington Examiner (8/24, Dunleavy, 448K) also report. 
Dozens Of American Universities Hosting Confucius Institute Despite Scrutiny. 
The Washington Free Beacon (8/24, Kakutani, 78K) reports, "Dozens of universities, including 
Columbia and Stanford, are hosting the Chinese government-funded Confucius Institute despite 
increasing scrutiny from the federal government." The universities "appear to be unfazed by the 
Trump administration's decision last week to designate" the Confucius Institute as a "foreign 
mission." Despite the move, "nearly 50 colleges and universities will continue their partnership 
with Confucius Institute programs." 
FBI FISA Requests Now Detail Whether Target Is Government Source. 
The Washington Examiner (8/24, Dunleavy, 448K) reports a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance 
Act reform "undertaken by the FBI is implementing more stringent requirements for asking 
whether a possible target has been a source for the US government." The change was revealed 
"following a related guilty plea in U.S. Attorney John Durham's inquiry into the Russia 
investigation." FBI Acting General Counsel Dawn Browning submitted a "declaration to the 
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court that was made public Monday." The filing "said that 
updated FISA request forms, specifically related to requests for business records and the use of 
pen register and trap and trace devices, `include a number of improvements,' including 
`questions about whether the target or subject of the request was previously interviewed by, or 
served as a confidential human source, asset, or operational contact of, the FBI, any other 
government agency, or a foreign government." 
Graham Says He Will Subpoena Priestap. 
The Washington Examiner (8/24, Dunleavy, 448K) reports Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsay 
Graham "said he plans to subpoena Bill Priestap, a key leader in the FBI's Trump-Russia 
investigation, after pushback from the former bureau official's lawyer." Graham told Fox News' 
Sunday Morning Futures "that he is escalating his effort to interview the FBI's former head of 
counterintelligence." Graham "said he believes Priestap gave misleading information to the 
Senate Intelligence Committee in 2018 about the reliability of British ex-spy Christopher 
Steele's discredited dossier." Graham said, "I don't know what Mr. Priestap did or didn't do, but 
I know the briefing given to the Intel Committee was an absolute lie about the reliability of the 
subsource. ... It does sound to me like there was an effort to mislead the Senate Intel 
Committee." 
Federal Government Has Made Progress, But Not Implemented, 2016 Election 
Security Recommendations. 
Politico (8/24, Starks, 4.29M) reports the federal government has "largely implemented the 
election security recommendations that the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security and 
NIST" issued in 2016, a "reflection of slow but steady progress that has nonetheless left room 
for improvement." The agencies advised "designating elections as critical infrastructure" and 
"suggested that DHS work with NIST and the Election Assistance Commission to incorporate the 
latest cybersecurity best practices into a new version of the Voluntary Voting System 
Guidelines." Many of the recommendations have been implemented, however, Politico says 
there are still some gaps including "no information-sharing alliance for U.S. political parties, nor 
is there a formal Election Infrastructure Cyber Response Plan." At the same time, "the growing 
problem of disinformation underscores the fact that some of the biggest election security 
threats target minds, not machines, and cannot be solved by security scans or threat indicator 
sharing."
