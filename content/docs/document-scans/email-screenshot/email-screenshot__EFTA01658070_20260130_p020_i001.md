CISA Says 62,000 QNAP NAS Devices Have Been Infected With The QSnatch Malware. 
ZDNet (7/27, Cimpanu, 299K) reports cyber-security agencies from the UK and the US "have 
published today a joint security alert about QSnatch, a strain of malware that has been 
infecting network-attached storage (NAS) devices from Taiwanese device maker QNAP." In 
alerts [1, 2) by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the UK's 
National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), the two agencies "say that attacks with the QSnatch 
malware have been traced back to 2014, but attacks intensified over the last year when the 
number of reported infections grew from 7,000 devices in October 2019 to more than 62,000 in 
mid-June 2020." Of these, LISA and the NSCS "say that approximately 7,600 of the infected 
devices are located in the US, and around 3,900 in the UK." CISA and the NCSC "say that the 
two campaigns used different versions of the QSnatch malware (also tracked under the name of 
Derek)." 
NDAA Would Create National Cyber Director Position In White House. 
Federal News Network (7/27, Serbu, 220) reports in the DOD reporter's Notebook that the US 
"may have a new top cybersecurity position within the White House as Jim Langevin, chairman 
of the House Armed Services Emerging Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee, got an 
amendment to the House version of the 2021 National Defense Authorization Act that will 
create a National Cyber Director within the executive office of the president." The position 
would serve "as the principal advisor to the president on cybersecurity strategy and policy." The 
role "would also consult with federal departments to develop the US national cyber strategy and 
supervise its implementation." Langevin "told Federal News Network that he pushed for the role 
because the Trump Administration got rid of the cybersecurity coordinator position on the 
National Security Council, and because cybersecurity needs a leadership position in the White 
House."

FBI Joins Probe Of Human Remains Found In Kentucky. 
The Lexington (KY) Herald-Leader (7/27, 257K) reports, "The Nelson County sheriff's office 
called in federal agents on Friday to help retrieve possible human remains, leading some in the 
community to wonder if authorities had found Crystal Rogers, a Bardstown resident missing 
since 2015." The sheriff's office "said in a Facebook post Sunday that possible remains were 
recovered and sent to the FBI lab at Quantico, Va., for testing. Investigators wouldn't be able to 
say if the remains are connected to Rogers until they get results back. 'Out of respect for family 
members of multiple missing persons in these areas, we will not be commenting on this until 
we have more information from the lab,' representatives from the sheriff's office said." The 
Herald-Leader adds, "Nelson County law enforcement became aware of the possible human 
remains near the border of Nelson and Washington counties on Thursday, according to the 
sheriff's office. The FBI's Evidence Response Team was called in because the location of the 
potential remains was difficult to reach, according to the sheriff's office." WDRB-TV Louisville, 
KY (7/27, 179K) also reports. 
NIST Study Finds Pandemic Masks Thwarting Face Recognition Technology. 
The AP (7/27, O'Brien) reports a preliminary study "published by a US agency on Monday found 
that even the best commercial facial recognition systems have error rates as high as 50% when 
trying to identify masked faces." The mask problem is why "Apple earlier this year made it 
easier for iPhone owners to unlock their phones without Face ID." It could also be "thwarting 
attempts by authorities to identify individual people at Black Lives Matter protests and other 
gatherings." The National Institute of Standards and Technology "says it is launching an 
investigation to better understand how facial recognition performs on covered faces." Its
