Important Information Regarding Auction Rate Securities (ARS). ARS are debt or preferred securities with an interest or dividend rate reset periodically in an auction. Although there may be daily, 
weekly and monthly resets. there is no guarantee that there will be liquidity. If there are not enough bids at an auction to redeem the securities available for sale, the result may be a failed auction. In the 
event of a failed auction, there is no assurance that a secondary market will develop or that the security will trade at par or any other price reflected on statements and online.Accordingly, investors 
should not rely on pricing information appearing in their statements or online with respect to ARS. Where J.P. Morgan was unable to obtain a price from an outside service for a particular ARS, the price 
column on your statement and online will indicate 'YO.a which however should not be relied on as the price at which ARS would trade.
