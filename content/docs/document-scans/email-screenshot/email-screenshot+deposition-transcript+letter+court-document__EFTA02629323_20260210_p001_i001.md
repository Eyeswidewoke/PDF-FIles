Re: 
Good morning, Sir, 
I understand that so=e issues regarding your personal space have been a disappointment. I will =ddress your concerns 
with top priority. Carlos has already been instructed=to purchase the hinges and Karen has provided instructions for the 
master.=/div> 
With little notice or direction, Mike, Patrick, a=d I picked up the ball and kept things moving forward the best we knew 
how= In a month's time we three have been doing what six people used to do=and we have made visible progress. I 
don't think we need more leadersh=p. We need more skilled labor and contractors. You have given us the go to=find it, 
so we will. With practice we expect exponential progress. We'=e got this. 
Plans are in place to address th= hinges and master straight away. We have steps in place for the tiki and =lready know 
what needs to be done. 
I am glad to h=ve met Anna. I'm happy to spend time with her and to learn from her an= ask her for help. I ask that you 
let me set the course for what she does =ere so that she's not in the middle of projects we already have lined =ut. For 
example, she went to GS1 after she left here yesterday and upset B=ian when she interjected herself in the dock wood 
collection for the tiki =roject. Everything was already in place for that, but Mike had to take tha= panicked call from Brian 
and contact others to straighten it back out. Ti=e is precious. This was frustrating for Mike. When she pulled crew, a 
boat= a captain, and machinery for the GS1 road project and I had NO IDEA this =as coming, it completely threw a 
wrench into everything we had already lin=d out for that week. I was EXTREMELY frustrated because I plan and work 
EF=ICIENTLY. 
Sir, you asked me what the most c=allenging part of this job has been. It has been the lack of clarification=to all about 
who is in charge and the consequential challenge of triangula=ion that occurs. One person needs to be your manager. 
Your manager should =e at your right hand and consequently responsible for being the conduit of=information and 
disseminating responsibilities with your priorities at the=forefront. Regardless of who you choose long-term for this 
responsibility,=the triangulation has to stop in order for that person to be successful. T=is means when people try to go 
over the manager's head to go to you orrRich, or sideline the manager by going around the manager to access crew, =he 
two of you need to refer that person back to the manager. Further, the =anager should not be micro-managed. 
Suggestions from you, Rich, others are=great, but give the manager the freedom to use her management skills to ge= 
the job done.The only way a manager will be successful is if you make it =tear that you've given the manager the 
authority to be so.
