Re: 
Following the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, Russia liberalized some of its anti-LGBT laws. Most notably, homosexual 
relationships we=e decriminalized in 1993. Transgender Russians have also been allowed =o change their legal gender 
on identity documents since 1997, although there are many obstacles to the process and invasive surgical requirements 
remain in place. Despite these liberalization trends during the immediate post-Soviet period, in recent years, Russian 
authorities have routinely denied permits for Pride parades, intimidated and arrested LGBT activists and condoned anti-
LGBT statements by government officials. ILGA-Europe <http://www.ilga-europe.org/home/about=us> , the European 
section of the International Lesbian, Ga=, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association, rates Russia <http://www.ilga-
eur=pe.org/home/publications/reports_and_other_materials/rainbow_europe/score_=heet/russia> as the least 
protective country in Europe for LGBT citizens, ranking it 49th out of the 49 European countries rated in its annual 
survey. 
In June 2013, the Russian duma in Moscow passed a ne= law banning the "propaganda of non-traditional sexual 
relationshi=s"to minors. The new federal law is closely related to several regional=20 laws that were already on the 
books, all of which seek to penalize "propaganda" of homosexuality, generally with the intent of="protecting" minors. 
The city of Sochi, which is the site of the upcoming Winter=20 Olympics, has one of those regional laws in place. And 
while the regional laws are not uniform, like the new federal law, they all tend to advance vague definitions of 
propaganda that lend themselves to the targeting and ongoing persecution of the country's LGBT community.=C2 The 
language of this new law focuses on "non-traditional" sexu=l relationships, to contrast with "traditional values" or =80 
traditional family" language that Russia is promoting at the UN to oppose posit=ve statements supporting the human 
rights of LGBT people. 
The federal anti-LGBT propaganda law, as signed by President Putin on June 29, entered into force in Russia on June 30 
of this year. (The official version in Russian is=20 published here <http://pravo.gov.ru:8080/page.aspx?50556> .) =C2 In 
the federal law, propaganda is defined as: "distribution of information that is aimed at the formation among minors of 
nontraditional sexual attitudes, attractiveness of non- traditional sexual relations, misperceptions of the social 
equivalence of traditional and non-traditional sexual relations, or enforcing information about non-traditional sexual 
relations that evokes interest to such relations . . . ." 
The new law sets administrative fines for LGBT propaganda at 4,000 to 5,000 rubles for individuals (about $120 - $150 
U.S. dollars) and up to 800,000 to 1 million rubles for NGOs, corporations or other legal entities (about $24,000 -
$30,000 U.S. dollars). More=20 severe administrative fines are allowed for propaganda transmitted via the Internet or 
other media networks or by a foreign citizen. 
It is too early to tell how aggressively the new federal law will be enforced, but several government officials have 
warned of a robust intent to enforce the legislation, including during the upcoming Sochi Olympics, and LGBT activists 
are themselves intent on challenging the law on human rights grounds. Moreover, while the law suggests that on=y 
information directed at children should expose an individual or an organization to liability, prosecutions under similar 
laws in the regions have not dwelled on this nexus to children and the federal law =80 s heightened focus on the 
internet, where minors have an opportunity to view such information, suggest that the law could be applied broadly and 
with little regard to any notion of child protection. LGBT citizens=20 and activists in Russia are increasingly concerned, 
as this law is being implemented at a time and in an environment of increasing violence and hatred of LGBT individuals 
and as LGBT defenders are being subjected to fines and prosecutions as "foreign agents."
