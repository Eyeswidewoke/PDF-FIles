An emerging consistent growth story 
with lower risk profile; initiate at Buy 
Initiating coverage with a Buy rating and $43 PT 
We see the following positive catalysts for CG units over the next 12 months: 
1) an inflection from among the weakest distributable earnings (DE) growth 
stories in 2013 to the second strongest (behind BX) in 2014-15 upon greater 
DE contribution from a broader array of funds, 2) greater investor appreciation 
over the next several quarters for CG's lower risk profile emanating from its 
conservative investing philosophy and greater diversification by product type, 
asset class and business line, and 3) a strong pace of fundraising over at least 
the next several quarters, bolstering CG's' ability to maintain positive DE 
growth post the current industry realization cycle over at least the next 1-2 
years. We see these dynamics helping CG narrow its P/E gap to traditional 
asset managers during 2014, though less so than peers given its current 
premium valuation to the group; hence the story is more DE growth-oriented. 
Earnings outlook 
We believe DE, from which cash distributions are paid to unit holders, is the 
most important earnings metric to value the Alts. rather than economic net 
income (ENI) that forms Consensus estimates. We forecast CG to grow DE per 
unit from $2.11 in 2013 to $2.84 in 2014E and $3.38 in 2015E. Key drivers are: 
1) a relatively stable pace of realizations 2014-16, 2) CEP III moving into carry 
position in 4Q13-1Q14. & 3) strong fundraising across business lines. 
Valuation & Risks 
We think the catalysts outlined above will drive CG' PIE from 11.4x 2014E ENI 
to 13-14x 2015 DE 12 months from now, narrowing its discount to the S&P 
500 P/E from -25% to -15%. This drives a $43 PT, which implies a total return 
of 25% over the next 12 months, inclusive of a 6.2% forecast distribution yield 
for 2014. Downside risks for CG are: 1) a slowdown in US/global economy, 2) 
a prolonged equity market correction, & 3) an inability to generate strong 
organic growth in 2014 that would jeopardize long-term growth in DE after a 
likely strong realization cycle over 2014-15 and 4) an inability to deploy capital 
effectively in its PE funds given the strong pace of fund raising.
