White House Clashed With DOJ Over Special Counsel Report 
The New York Times (02/15, Savage) reported that the White House clashed with the DOJ in the run-up to the 
release of a special counsel report last week about President Biden's handling of classified information, previously 
undisclosed correspondence shows. The letters, obtained by The New York Times, show that a top DOJ official 
rejected complaints from Biden's lawyers about disparaging comments in the report regarding the president. The 
article stated that the lawyers wrote to Attorney General Merrick B. Garland the day before he released the 
report by the special counsel, Robert K. Hur. They raised objections to passages in the report in which Hur 
suggested that Biden's memory was failing and questioned some of his actions, even though the special counsel 
had found no basis to prosecute the president. The lawyers said Hur's comments "openly, obviously and blatantly 
violate department policy and practice," the letters show. According to the article, as the department was 
preparing to make the report public, Bradley Weinsheimer — the department's senior career official, or 
nonpolitical appointee, who deals with ethics complaints or appeals of department decisions — wrote back 
rejecting their criticism. He insisted that the comments in the report "fall well within the department's standards 
for public release." The article noted that Hur had permitted Biden's White House and personal lawyers to review a 
copy of the report before turning it in to Garland, to allow for any comments and to see whether there was 
anything Biden might want to assert executive privilege over. While Biden did not invoke the privilege, the review 
prompted the lawyers' complaints to Garland. ABC News (02/15, Bruggeman, Barr, Faulders), CBS News (02/15, 
Becket, Cordes, Legare), Politico (02/15, Swan), and CNN (02/15, Liptak, Lee) also reported on the story. 
Jim Jordan Demands Interview Recordings, Transcripts from Joe Biden's Ghostwriter 
The National Review (02/15, Lynch) reported that House Judiciary Committee chairman Jim Jordan (R-OH) is 
seeking interview recordings and transcripts from Joe Biden's ghostwriter. The article added that Jordan wrote 
a letter Wednesday to ghostwriter Mark Zwonitzer demanding documents and information related to his work 
ghostwriting Joe Biden's memoirs, Promise Me Dad and Promises To Keep, in the wake of special counsel Robert 
Hur's final report on Biden's handling of classified materials. The article mentioned that Hur's investigation 
found Joe Biden shared classified information with Zwonitzer on at least three occasions by reading nearly 
verbatim from notebook entries written during his vice presidency. The article noted that Joe Biden read more 
classified portions of the notebook entry during a conversation with Zwonitzer two months later, Hur documented. 
According to the article, Jordan's request to Zwonitzer cites those portions of Hur's report and the special counsel's 
references to audio records and transcripts of conversations with Joe Biden. Hur suggested Zwonitzer deleted audio 
recordings from his computer after the classified-documents investigation began. The recordings were created 
during conversations for Promise Me Dad and FBI specialists ended up recovering them. Zwonitzer did turn over his 
laptop, an external hard drive, and transcripts of some of the tapes. The article stated that Hur opted not to bring 
charges against Zwonitzer for the alleged deletion of the recordings. He similarly decided against pursuing criminal 
charges against President Biden despite finding evidence Biden willfully retained classified documents related to 
Afghanistan policy and other national security matters.

The Associated Press (02/15, Staff Writer) reported that the mass shooting that unfolded amid throngs of people at 
the Kansas City Chiefs' Super Bowl celebration, killing one person and wounding almost two dozen others,

the 22 people injured Wednesday ranged between 8 and 47 years old, with half under 16. A mother of two was 
killed. The article added that police said they detained three juveniles but released one who they determined 
wasn't involved in the shooting, leaving two in custody. No charges have been filed. Police are looking for others 
who may have been involved and are calling for witnesses, victims, and people with cellphone video of the violence 
to call a dedicated hotline. The Hill (02/15, Crisp) reported that the FBI is seeking help from the public as it works 
with Kansas City, Mo., authorities to investigate the deadly shooting that followed the Wednesday celebration for 
the city's Super Bowl-winning Chiefs. An additional Associated Press (02/15, Staff Writer) article, an additional Hill
