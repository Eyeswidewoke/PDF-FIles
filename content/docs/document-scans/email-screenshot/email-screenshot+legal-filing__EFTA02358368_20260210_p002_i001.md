On 1--again think of Nabokov, whose favorite Russian poets were often obscure figures derided by all the other critics. 
He stood alone. The Marschner is beautiful opera and a crucial link between Beethoven and Wagner. So I stand in the 
Quixotic defense of works that are worth it--even if they are not as good as others. Music does not follow Darwinian 
patterns (a longer discussion). It is not science. That is, if i may say so, a commonplace; the idea that history is a judge 
that seems right but is not. One of the greatest plays was forgotten after the writer died and rediscovered in the 1920s, 
100 years later--Woyzeck. That is just one example. 
As to 2, that is one way to build an audience, by linking music to other forms of life--to pretentiously paraphrase 
Wittgenstein. 
And to No 3) I am still haunted by early criticisms by angry competitors and idiot ignorant critics who hated my ideas and 
the fact that I was an outsider with another career in scholarship and education. 
That being said, why not give me one last shot at proving the majority wrong. I have been at it for nearly 25 years, and in 
the next five, if there can be no measured improvement on the execution front--then that will be that. But 120,000 sales 
and a Grammy nomination for a rare work--a Popov symphony from the 19305,--and more than 20 years of some real 
success (we have generated a body of new scholarship in music history--is cause enough to inspire you to give us help. 
This is my plea. But I am not Moses, and if there were a God, he would not be on my side. (Another reason to help). 
I greatly cherish this new friendship and I have real admiration for how you go about doing things----tough as it is often I 
truly enjoy the argument. But this time I and not your preliminary findings and researchers--am right. Given the 
firestorm I created 20 years ago I am even surprised I did as well in your research, whatever grade you put on the result. 
It is not the final exam, only a badly constructed mid-term, I am a bit proud not to have gotten a top grade. True 
controversy rarely leads to praise in this business. Nabokov became famous and admired only at the end.
