Re: thought you find amusing 
Thanks. Agree. I haven't seen the video, but you'r= certainly right about the limits of mechanistic explanations. 
Economics i= an unusually clear example of a discipline where complexity and particula=ly emergence is of more use. I 
was struck in seeing Ray that he did seem t= be focused more on the particular transaction than the larger 
environment=that makes it possible and makes the results inevitable. 
Good seeing you as always. Hope you still own the house ;)</=iv>

Ray is a well meaning person . His funds show great results. He believes=20 himself to be both a critical thinker 
and a teacher. He is certain=y not the former. He stands high above many of his peers, but i believe that is due to the 
flatness of the landscape around him. The video is just wrong , over simplified and pedestrian. 1 . The economy that 
even the simplistic illustrations purport to represent=A0 on close examination is not a machine. certainly not as Ray 
suggests a simple machine - not at all, - quite the contrary , th= economy is a system. The antiquated machine analogy 
broke down 50 =20 years ago. A machine has an input and a predictable output. A system=20 may be comprised of 
simple machines, like the body being described as=a simple machine comprised of a digestive tract and a liver and 
some other simple machine called the brain.an <http://brain.an> input output device. Poincare the French 
mathematician did a great=20 deal of work on the "three body problem." three simple pendulu=s, three of the 
simplest of "machines". The movements when combi=ed are UNPREDICTABLE. because they are not independent.the 
proof is elegant =20 2. In Rays second two minutes he describes Banks as exchanging credit . It is not the same as 
creating credit. which in fact is their life blood. . He then makes the bold statement that Total spending drives the 
economy. I assume he understands inflation but his statement doesn't reflect it. Nazi germanys spending=20 went up 
dramatically as their currency went in the toilet. It did drive the economy, but it wasn't in the direction I think they had 
hoped for= He also ignores the international in his words" transactions"= which brings in goods but sends out money. 
and does not at the same time create income for your next door neighbor. I guess the idea is th=t if he uses the word 
" simple " enough , people will believe it =. The emperor has no clothes . sorry 
I will review more tomorow, or maybe he does h=ve clothes but they must have been a clown suit when he 
put this together or it was to be his 6th graders science fair project. Im not=20 sure of its "value". ( AH yes .the value 
word ) I ha=e not read his required reading for all his employees, of his things that he dictates they should know . 
but hopefully one of them , is to recognize ones own capabilities with a minimum of self deception.
