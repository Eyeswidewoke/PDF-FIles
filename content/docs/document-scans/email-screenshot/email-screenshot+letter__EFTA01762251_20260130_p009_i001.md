In its internal discussions, Hezbollah affirms that Qatar= funding stands behind the rise of Sheikh Ahmad al-Assir, who 
came to prom=nence in the last two years by challenging and criticizing Hezbollah from his Bilal bin Rabah mosque in 
Sidon. Hezbol=ah's information also indicates that Saudi Arabia is funding Salafist fa=tions in Lebanon that profess 
animosity towards the party. 
Yet, it's been obvious lately that the honeymoon betwee= Riyadh and Doha in Lebanon is ending. The main point of 
contention betwee= them this time is the issue of support for the Muslim Brotherhood in Syria. While Qatar and Turkey 
are planning t= make the Brotherhood the spearhead of their future influence in Syria fol=owing Assad's ouster, Riyadh, 
on the other hand, backs the advent to pow=r of moderate Sunni factions, most of which are comprised of Syrian Army 
defectors and other figures who don=92t belong to Islamist movements. From Riyadh's perspective, its disagre=ment 
with Qatar about the Brotherhood is a strategic one. For Saudi Arabians wary of the ties between the Muslim 
Brotherhood and the Islamist Sahwa movement in Saudi Arabia, which today represents the main internal opposit=on to 
the Saudi ruling family. Riyadh wants Qatar to abandon its plan to b=ck the Muslim Brotherhood because it would 
become a source of strength for=the Saudi Sahwa movement if it were to attain power in Syria.</=> 
Riyadh is therefore developing a new policy in Lebanon, a=d has begun opening up to all Lebanese political powers, 
including Iran'= ally Hezbollah and the Christian Free Patriotic Movement, which belongs to the Iranian-Syrian axis of 
resistance= Saudi Arabia is also bolstering its influence on Sunni Lebanese factions,=in order to minimize Qatari 
influence over them. There are indications tha= Riyadh has succeeded in dispelling Qatar's role in Lebanon, as evidenced 
by the lack of visits by Lebanese =fficials to Doha recently, and the resurgence of visits to Saudi Arabia instead. 
Furthermore, Sheikh Assir's vitriolic Qatari-influenced verbal att=cks on Hezbollah have ceased lately. 
Qatar's role in the region is the subject of behind-the=scenes attacks by factions close to Article 5. <http://www.al-

How Would a Nuclear Tehran Behave? 
(Summary) 
Alireza Nader</=> 
May 2013 -- Iran's acquisition of nuclear weapons is no= a foregone conclusion. The U.S. policy of imposing sanctions on 
Iran whil= pursuing diplomatic engagement may still dissuade the Islamic Republic from developing a nuclear weapons 
capability= However, that policy is not guaranteed to resolve the Iranian nuclear cri=is. Even an Israeli and/or U.S. 
military attack against Iran's nuclear f=cilities could not prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons; it could only 
delay such development. Therefor=, it is prudent to examine Iran's potential foreign policy, military doc=rine, and 
support for terrorism after it has obtained nuclear weapons. Thi= report seeks to explore how a nuclear-armed Iran 
would behave, if it would act aggressively, and what this would entai= for the United States and its main regional allies, 
including the Gulf Co=peration Council (GCC) and Israel. 
The key findings of the study are the following:
