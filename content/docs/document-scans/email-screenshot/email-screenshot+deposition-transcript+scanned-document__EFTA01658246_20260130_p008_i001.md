WKYC-TV Cleveland (7/29, 223K) reports, "As Cleveland authorities introduced the launch 
of 'Operation Legend' - a violent crime reduction effort in the city - they also announced a 
$25,000 reward regarding the murder of a 17-year-old boy." WKYC-TV adds, "Officials with the 
Cleveland Division of the FBI are asking for the public's help in finding the person(s) responsible 
for the May 25 shooting, which claimed the life of Eric Hakizimana as he stopped at a traffic 
light at the intersection of W. 80th and Detroit. Eric Smith, Special Agent in Charge of the 
Cleveland FBI, discussed details of the teen's death during a press conference Wednesday 
morning. 'Eric was violently pulled from his vehicle, shot and left to die on the streets of 
Cleveland. His murderer then drove away in Eric's vehicle." 
WEWS-TV Cleveland (7/29) reports, "Police said an unknown male approached 
Hakizimana's car, dragged him out of the vehicle, shot him and fled the area in his vehicle. 'Eric 
and his family are refugees from their home country of the Democratic Republic Congo, having 
fled violence and war there for a refugee camp in Uganda. Eric and his family came to the 
United States unable to imagine violence would follow them to a street light at West 80th and 
Detroit with the sudden and tragic loss of their son,' Smith said. A $25,000 reward is being 
offered as part of funds allocated from 'Operation Legend." WKYC-TV Cleveland (7/29, 223K)

will join work that's already underway by existing federal, state and local task forces, Krueger

often longer term investigations or who know how to do a deeper dive on things:" Milwaukee 
"is one of six cities currently involved in 'Operation Legend,' along with Detroit, Cleveland, 
Chicago, Kansas City and Albequerque." WDJT-TV adds, "The city's homicide rate is currently 85 
percent higher than it was at this time last year. 'That's the reason why we need to focus our

Hughes said."
