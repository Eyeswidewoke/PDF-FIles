WJLA (ABC-7) (07/09, Flores) reported that jury selection and opening arguments wrapped up Wednesday evening 
for the trial of the FBI agent accused of sexually assaulting three women after providing free tattoos and 
photoshoots. According to the article, police arrested Eduardo Valdivia in November 2024. Jury selection took up 
most of Wednesday's court proceedings, but opening arguments began around 3:20 p.m. Both sides took about an 
hour each to make their opening arguments. The main argument centered around whether or not the alleged 
sexual acts that took place were consensual. The prosecutor stated to the jury that Valdivia "preyed on, isolated, 
and sexually assaulted three women" at his tattoo studios. Meanwhile, Valdivia's lawyer told the jury the alleged 
acts were consensual and in exchange for the free services he provided to the women. The prosecution team 
brought up the fact that the FBI agent, who is currently suspended without pay, was trained to be undercover and 
used those skills in these alleged incidents by having different aliases. WUSA (CBS-9) (07/09, Video) also reported 
on the story. 
Federal Authorities End Idaho Search for Suspect in Kids' Deaths After Finding Look-Alike Hiker 
The Associated Press (07/09, Boone) reported that federal authorities in Idaho say they have ended a search in the 
Sawtooth National Forest after determining it was all case of mistaken identity. The search began Saturday after the 
U.S. Marshals Service Greater Idaho Fugitive Task Force said a family reported they saw a man who looked like 
Travis Decker, who is wanted in connection with the deaths of his three daughters in Washington state. The article 
added that Decker has been wanted since June 2, when a sheriff's deputy in Washington found his truck and the 
bodies of his three daughters. The family was near a Bear Creek area campsite when they saw a man who was the 
same height and roughly the same weight as Decker, and also had similar hair, beard and tattoos on his arm and 
calf. Additional tips followed, and federal, state and local law enforcement agencies joined the Marshals Service in 
the search. They found the man Wednesday afternoon, U.S. Marshals Service Supervisory Deputy Michael Leigh 
said in a press release, and determined he was not Decker. The Marshals Service is offering a reward of up to 
$20,000 for information leading to Decker's capture. 
Three Zizians Face Trial Together in Maryland Amid Sprawling Federal Investigation 
The Associated Press (07/09, Skene) reported that three members of a violent cultlike group, including its alleged 
ringleader, will be tried together on charges of trespassing, gun and drug possession after police discovered them 
camping in box trucks in rural western Maryland. The group known as Zizians, which attracted a fringe contingent 
of computer scientists who connected online over their shared anarchist beliefs, has been linked to six killings 
spanning three states in recent years. The Maryland cases were originally scheduled for separate trials, but the 
defendants requested a joint proceeding despite concerns from their attorneys; a judge granted the request 
following a court hearing Tuesday afternoon. According to the article, Jack "Ziz" LaSota and her associates, Michelle 
Zajko and Daniel Blank were arrested in February after a man told police that "suspicious" people had parked two 
box trucks on his property and asked to camp there for a month, according to authorities. The trucks were found in 
a largely remote wooded area near the Maryland-Pennsylvania line, a mountainous region dotted with small 
towns. The article mentioned that LaSota, a transgender woman who's regarded as the group leader, entered the 
courtroom Tuesday hoisting a brown paper bag filled with documents. Throughout the hearing, LaSota and Zajko 
repeatedly interjected to address the judge directly, disregarding conventional courtroom practices and 
occasionally speaking over their attorneys. The regular interruptions added to the already unusual circumstances of 
the case, which hinges on the findings of federal investigators despite being prosecuted in state court. The main 
issue discussed Tuesday was the timeline of the proceedings. After the trio was arrested in February on trespassing 
and illegal gun possession charges, prosecutors filed a superseding indictment last month with new allegations, 
including LSD possession. Defense attorneys argued prosecutors are trying to slow-walk the case while federal 
authorities continue investigating the Zizians. The article noted that Zajko faces federal firearms charges in Vermont 
because police allege she purchased weapons recovered in connection with a border patrol agent's killing. 
President Trump's Justice Department Targets Doctors, Clinics Who Provide Sex Change Procedures to 
Minors 
Fox News (07/09, Casiano) reported that the Dal on Wednesday said it has subpoenaed more than 20 doctors and 
clinics that are involved in providing minors with sex change procedures. The agency is investigating healthcare 
fraud, false statements and more, it said. "Medical professionals and organizations that mutilated children in the 
service of a warped ideology will be held accountable by this Department of Justice," Attorney General Pamela 
Bondi said in a statement. In April, Bondi issued a memo stating that the DOJ would be investigating and
