I've withheld writing because it is, frankly, not =asy. The concerns you express about my life are completely groundless. 
There is in fact one problem in my life, one and only one: your insistence on pursuing this matter instead of resolving it 
easily, as I have suggested= The one and only problem. 
Furthermore, your picture of what happened in the past= whatever its source, is almost completely false. I've written to 
you in detail about what did happen. You haven't yet responded, s=mply ignoring the detailed account I gave. I don't 
understand that.Q=A0 I'll go through it again and hope that this will finish the matter.Q=A0 Furthermore, you will find 
in due course that there has been serious wrongd=ing, much more than I told you about in the letters I have sent before, 
some repeated below. 
Easier to add comments below. I also think it wo=ld be useful to make more explicit comments about your earlier letter, 
and a few other things. 
First, an area of agreement. Just as you are dis=urbed, similarly all of this is disturbing to me, extremely so. It's the one 
seriously -- very seriously -- dark spot on the new lives that Valeria and I are shaping for ourselves, and I would therefore 
like to get it over with and resolved as soon as possible. As I wrote, I cannot understand why you are bringing any of 
these things up, and I think it would be very good to make everything clear, and keep nothing hidden or implicit. 
Second, it's clear that we are not communicating.=C2* The reason is clear: I write you long and detailed letters 
explaining the facts, and you completely ignore the letters, not responding to anything I wrote. Not once. I presume 
that includes the letter I wrote about my father, which you ignored, along with all the others. When I ask specific 
questions, you do not respond. I've repeatedly ask=cl you for the sources of your beliefs, but you have never told me, so 
I can only guess. To take the most recent case, I have asked several times where you received the information about the 
sale of our Cambridge apartmen= (incorrect information, as I wrote) and the purchase of our Tucson house -- and also, 
why you even wanted to look into the matter, which, frankly, seems to me very strange. 
Then come the areas of disagreement, which I hope we c=n iron out quickly and expeditiously so that we can pick up the 
warm and close relations that we always had, and that I'd always treasured.

Dear Doddoy, 
We really hesitated to write our long letter to you last month. We only finally decided to write it because you insisted so 
many times that we do so. We think, and have thought for a long time, that we need to sit down face-to-face and work 
through our very substantial differences with you in how we understand your estate plan, financial history, and current 
situation. But after you asked us so many times in December to discuss it by e-mail, we decided to give that a try. We 
definitely didn't intend to be legalistic and adversarial, and we really regret th=t that's how you found our writing. We 
meant our letter as a heartfelt ex=lanation of our perspective on the issues and how we want to help you understand 
the problem and fix it. But it doesn't sound like you've unde=stood what we were trying to explain and express. This 
strongly confirms our feeling that e-mail is not a useful way for us to communicate about these issues.
