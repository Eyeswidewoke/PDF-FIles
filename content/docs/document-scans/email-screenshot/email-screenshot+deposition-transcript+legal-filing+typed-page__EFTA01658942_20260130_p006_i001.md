WSJournal Argues Riots After Floyd's Killing Were Politically Motivated. 
In an editorial, the Wall Street Journal (11/8, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) argues the 
reaction to the election shows how the riots that grew out of protests over the death of George 
Floyd and police abuses were a politically motivated attempt to undermine President Trump's 
leadership. 
Mourners Call For Peace At Wallace's Funeral In Philadelphia. 
The AP (11/8) reports that several hundred people "gathered over the weekend to mourn 
[Walter Wallace Jr.) amid renewed calls for peace during the investigation into the Black man's 
shooting death last month by Philadelphia police." The AP adds a lawyer for his family "has said 
they do not want the officers charged with murder because they believe the officers lacked the 
proper training and equipment." 
NYTimes Analysis Discusses How Voters Were Divided In Their Perceptions Of Racial 
Justice Protests. 
A New York Times (11/7, Tavernise, Eligon, 18.61M) analysis says that "as the summer wore on 
and with it, sporadic looting and acts of vandalism, Americans became much more divided" with 
regard to their perceptions of the protests sparked by George Floyd's killing. However, as the 
country starts "sifting through the results" of the election, 'one thing is clear: The protests this 
summer and what came after weighed heavily on Americans' minds." Preliminary data from the 
AP shows that roughly "nine of every 10 voters said the protests over police violence were a 
factor in their voting, with more than three-fourths calling it a major factor." The Times says 
that interviews with voters this week indicated that "there were strong differences that often 
ran along racial lines - with many Black voters viewing the protests through the lens of police 
violence threatening their lives, while many conservative white voters saw unrest encroaching 
on their communities." 
NYTimes Analysis: Several GOP Candidates In New York "Appeared To Find Success 
By" Branding Swing-District Dems As Anti-Police. 
A New York Times (11/6, Ferre-Sadurni, McKinley, 18.61M) analysis says, "While the suburbs in 
many parts of the country seemed to reject [President) Trump's brand of brash, hard-right 
rhetoric and policy, several Republican candidates in New York appeared to find success by 
characterizing moderate Democrats in swing districts as anti-law enforcement. That message 
was often conflated with calls from the left to 'defund the police' and with occasionally violent 
clashes between authorities and Black Lives Matter protesters." Rep. Max Rose (D), who 
represents New York City's most conservative congressional district and who is on the verge of 
being ousted by GOP challenger Nicole Malliotakis, "was elected in a 'blue wave' in 2018, 
beating the incumbent, Dan Donovan, by running as an anti-establishment centrist." However, 
Malliotakis "easily found success linking Mr. Rose, a veteran, to the Black Lives Matter 
movement and the progressive factions of his party." 
Fairfax County Removes Three Civil War Monuments. 
The Washington Post (11/6, 14.2M) reports Fairfax County on Thursday "removed a trio of Civil 
War markers in front of the county's judicial complex, part of a broader effort in Virginia to turn 
a page on the state's Confederate legacy." Under a state law allotting localities discretion "over 
the fate of war monuments and memorials in their communities, the county's Board of 
Supervisors decided last month to donate a stone obelisk honoring John Quincy Marr - the first 
Confederate soldier to be killed in a land battle - to the Stuart Mosby Historical Society in 
Centreville." The Post adds, "A state historical marker commemorating the June 1, 1861, battle
