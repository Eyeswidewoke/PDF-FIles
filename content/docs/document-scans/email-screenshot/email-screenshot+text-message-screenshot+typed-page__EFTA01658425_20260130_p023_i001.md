clinical trial." The Post writes that "if Mr. Trump's intrusion in this case foreshadows attempts to 
short-circuit the rigorous testing of vaccines in order to distribute one before the election, the 
damage could be immense." 
The New York Times (8/24, 18.61M) editorializes that in announcing the new decision, 
"the president and his team have vastly overstated the promise of convalescent plasma." While 
this is "hardly the first time the Trump administration has sacrificed scientific integrity for the 
sake of political theater," the Times argues that "politicizing the regulatory 
process...undermines the entire system." 
The Wall Street Journal (8/24, Editorial Board, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) 
editorializes that Trump was wrong to tweet Saturday that "the deep state" at the FDA was 
thwarting development of therapies and vaccines until after the election. The Journal, however, 
argues that there is evidence that convalescent plasma may be effective and its potential 
benefits outweigh the risks. 
Atlas: Prolonged Lockdowns Are Harmful To Country. 
Special Adviser to the President Scott Atlas said on Fox News' The Story (8/24) that Joe Biden's 
claim that he would shut the country down again if scientists recommend it is a statement 
"from somebody who hasn't been paying attention to actually the science because by now I 
think we all know that the prolonged lockdown is severely harmful to our country. In fact, it's 
killing people." Atlas added, "We know the President has a strategic and appropriate policy, 
which is protecting the vulnerable. We know who is at risk here. It's not everybody. It's not 
about all the cases that's the most important metric. It's about saving lives by protecting the 
vulnerable, by preventing hospital overcrowding, which we are really doing well, and by 
opening the economy, opening the schools because American lives are being destroyed." 
Trump: Biden's Openness To New Lockdown "Crazy." President Trump tweeted 
Monday, "Joe Biden has said he would lock down the Country again. That's crazy! We're having 
record job growth and a booming stock market, but Joe would end it all and close it all down. 
Ridiculous!" 
The Washington Times (8/24, Richardson, 492K) reports Biden "drew a rash of criticism 
over his declaration Sunday that he would defer to scientists on whether to lock down the 
economy to control the novel coronavirus." Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) called the idea "madness," 
while others "argued that scientists have been divided in their response to COVID-19." 
Experts Skeptical Of Lockdowns As Means To Control Pandemic. The Wall Street 
Journal (8/24, Al, Ip, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) reports some experts now believe that 
lockdowns are too inclusive an effort to slow the spread of the coronavirus and that more 
targeted efforts, like mask mandates, would be more effective at lower cost. 
Meadows Says President, Congress Could Agree On Coronavirus Aid. 
Chief of Staff Meadows said on CBS This MorningVi (8/24, 2.43M), "Democrats on Capitol Hill 
failed to come together on anything that would address unemployment, enhanced 
unemployment, eviction protection. What does this President do? He took unprecedented 
executive action to do exactly that, to make sure that unemployment benefits continue." Asked 
what could be agreed on, Meadows said, "Enhanced unemployment benefits...school 
aid...additional assistance for small businesses" and "plussing up food stamps for some of those 
that have been hit hard by this along with eviction protection." 
Lawmakers Insert Funding For Pet Projects In Relief Bills. The Washington Times 
(8/24, Sherfinski, 492K) reports that although lawmakers "say money to fight COVID-19 is the 
overarching priority in spending debates, Congress isn't above leveraging the pandemic to 
secure extra money for their home districts or other special interests." Steve Ellis, President of 
Taxpayers for Common Sense, said, "They are going to, in many cases, take every opportunity 
to shove the cash to their favorite interests. ... In many cases, lawmakers know where the 
earmarks would have been, and they've plussed-up certain accounts or certain projects that
