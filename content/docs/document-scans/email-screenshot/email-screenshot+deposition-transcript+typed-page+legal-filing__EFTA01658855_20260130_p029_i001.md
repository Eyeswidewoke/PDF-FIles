could not immediately be confirmed, seemed to represent a coordinated effort at damage 
control by the nation's security apparatus after a public and official backlash after the 
embarrassingly public assassination of Mr. Fakhrizadeh, which Western intelligence officials have 
said was carried out by Israel." Reuters (11/30, Hafezi) reports that also on Monday, 
Shamkhani "said...an opposition group was suspected alongside Israel in the killing." 
In a separate story, the Washington Post (11/30, Hendrix, Rubin, 14.2M) says, 
"Commentators, brushing past Israel's refusal to comment on an assassination that showed the 
hallmarks of an Israeli clandestine operation, have moved on to asking what Israeli Prime 
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hoped to achieve." According to the Post, "The task of teasing out 
the strategy is complicated by the current complex brew of circumstances, which include the 
shifting alliances of the Middle East, Netanyahu's own legal and political trouble and, most 
critically, the winding down of the Trump era." The Post says Netanyahu is "wary of Biden's 
promise to offer Iran 'a diplomatic path' back to compliance and, by some accounts, he is 
pushing Trump to strike a decisive blow against Iran's nuclear program as a parting gambit." 
The Wall Street Journal (11/30, Rasmussen, Eqbali, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) says 
Israel has neither confirmed nor denied its involvement in the assassination. ABC World News 
TonightVi (11/30, 6:43 p.m. ET, story 4, Muir, 7.69M) provided similar coverage. 
Report Calls For "Significant Changes" To NATO Policy. 
The New York Times (11/30, Erlanger, 18.61M) reports that "a high-level look at NATO's next 
10 years" that covers "138 specific recommendations in some 60 pages" recommends 
"significant changes to confront the new challenges of an aggressive Russia and a rising China, 
urging overhauls to fortify the alliance's cohesion and to better coordinate with democratic allies 
around the world." The report "will be a major source of discussion on Tuesday, the start of a 
two-day meeting of NATO foreign ministers." 
Asian Pro-Democracy Activists Worry Biden Will Abandon Trump's Tough China 
Stance. 
The New York Times (11/30, Beech, 18.61M) reports that "a dissident once branded Enemy No. 
1 by the Chinese Communist Party is spreading conspiracy theories about vote-rigging in the 
American presidential election," in Hong Kong, "pro-democracy campaigners...are championing 
President Trump's claims of an electoral victory," and "human rights activists and religious 
leaders" in Burma and Vietnam "are expressing reservations" about Joe Biden's "ability to keep 
authoritarians in check." According to the Times, "it is precisely Mr. Trump's willingness to flout 
diplomatic protocol, abandon international accords and keep his opponents off-balance that 
have earned him plaudits as a leader strong enough to stand up to dictators and defend 
democratic ideals." The Times adds that many of these same prominent human rights expect 
Biden to "pursue accommodation rather than confrontation in the face of China's assertive 
moves." 
French Lawmakers To Overhaul Law On Sharing Images Of Police. 
The New York Times (11/30, Breeden, 18.61M) reports, "French lawmakers will completely 
rewrite a legislative provision restricting the sharing of images of police officers that was 
pushed by the government but has faced fierce opposition over the past week, a top official in 
President Emmanuel Macron's party announced on Monday." The provision "had come under fire 
from journalist unions, free speech advocates and left-wing opposition parties." The AP (11/30) 
reports that "in its current version, the article of the proposed law criminalizes the publishing of 
images of police officers with the intent of harming their 'physical or psychological integrity.' 
Anyone found guilty could be sentenced to up to a year in jail and fined 45,000 euros 
($53,000)."
