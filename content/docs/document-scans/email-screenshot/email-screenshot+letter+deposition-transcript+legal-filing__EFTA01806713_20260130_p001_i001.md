miserable week 
JE, 
»checking in, how are youop 
The second operation, scheduled for this past Tuesday. turned into a =iserable experience. We arrived at HSS on time at 
10:30 and were told =e were on schedule and to get ready. We were put in a double room for =repping. I had not eaten 
since midnight and stopped drinking liquids in =he morning. But I did manage to take a couple of Xanax walking in, to =et 
me through the ordeal. 
Instead of rapidly proceeding to surgery we sat in the room (with me in =ospital clothes in a bed) for at least four hours 
while three other =ets of patients came and went and had meetings with their doctors, =nesthesiologists, etc. In the 
meantime I was starving and desperately =rying not to hear the medical talk on the other side of the curtain =hat makes 
me ill. Finally, long after the xanax wore off, they came for =e, to me to OR, gave me the anesthesia, and fours later I 
awoke to find =ut they couldn't operate because my heart was racing much to fast wit =n irregular beat. The result was 
imprisonment in recuperative care for =4 hours - as though I was a heart attack victim - with beta blockers =nfusions of 
magnesium, constant checking about low blood pressure. 
But prior to being wheeled into OR a nurse took by blood pressure, said =t was low, and didn't tell anyone in OR. And the 
hospital doctor didn't =heck me (he had done so two weeks ago for the first operation). 
Patrick O'Leary, the surgeon, stopped in Wed am while I was still in the =ospital to say we has rethinking his plan for me 
and in this regard he =ad me get an MRI before I left. His latest thought: rest a month and =hen come back for the 
second operation. He also mentioned that the =econd operation was dangerous. But strange that all this conversation 
=appened after the operation was to have been finished. 
The hospital medical doctor - a Dr. Lefkowitz 
who clear =atients for surgery called to say O'Leary wants 
me to see him for a =tress test next week and other possible heart tests (echo - =ltrasound). He, or another hospital 
doctor - prescribed a bottle of =eta-blockers - Metraprolol XL 25MG 25 MG for Toprol X for me to take =very day but not 
the day of the stress test. 
I don't think there's anything wrong with my heart other being scared =nd starved to death by the environment at the 
hospital. And I'm not =eady to go see this other doctor or to start taking Beta Blockers. In =ther words, I go in for a 
cervical spine problem and suddenly I'm a =ardiac patient. I'm it buying it. It's also really strange and =isconcerting being 
in a hospital recuperation ward getting a lot of =rescription drugs fed intravenously by a nurse when the doctor who is 
=rdering them is not on the floor nor is someone connected to any of the =octors I already know. Finally, this was a 
major surgery scheduled for =t least 4 hours. It seems weird that they were planning to begin at 4pm =n the afternoon. 
O'Leary wanted me to come in Monday to talk, but he's away until a week =rom Monday when I have an appointment 
with him (April 11). In the =eantime, my internist (who I've been with for 40 years) has a hunch he =ay not want to 
operate. The 2nd opinion from Michael Mayer in Munich =as to operate, see how it goes and whether the second 
operation even =ecessary. 
I am definitely out of my depth on this one. Instead of coming our of =SS today with both surgeries done, I feel like I'm in 
Alice in =onderland.
