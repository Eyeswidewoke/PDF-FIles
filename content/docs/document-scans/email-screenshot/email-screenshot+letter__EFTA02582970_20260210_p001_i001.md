Re: Promised art 
This is exactly what i referred to as not a 100% / 0 effort. Works are joi=tly owned and there are requirements to 
properly insure by contract. From=accounting perspective I need to track down invoices, check what was paid,=and. 
compare to contracts or letters of intention. For example, in past, =nvoice did not indicate joint ownership but gift letter 
stated joint owner=hip. I figure I get all documentation and hand off to Ada to deal with es=ate issues. And given the 
mandate to be point person on art related item=, i lead the effort to gather facts and get complete our records so as to 
=ave global view of artworks. I must provide to Ada in her efforts. She re=ds for estate tax inclusion and understanding 
of any legal obligations etc= 
This should be a collaborative process. We work together and not separatel=. Ada can also lead this effort and I just 
need to be involved to tease o=t all issues germane to my efforts.
