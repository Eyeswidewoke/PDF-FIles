have been "personally briefed extensively on every single detail, nugget, tendril of this case" and said there was no proof of any foreign terrorism 
involvement. The Daily Beast (05/18, Staff Writer) reported that in the interview, Director Patel blamed Canada for the influx of fentanyl to the U.S., 
claiming it is being made in Canada and shipped to the U.S. "So, where's all the fentanyl and trafficking coming from still? Where are all the rum,-
traffickers going to keep bringing this stuff into the country? The Northern Border," Director Patel said on Sunday. "Who has to get to stepping? Canada," 
he added. "They're making fentanyl up there and shipping it down here." The article noted that less than 1 percent of the fentanyl intercepted by federal 
agents last year was found at the Canadian border, according to the New York Times. The article explained that Director Patel's comments are part of an 
increasingly hostile approach by the U.S. towards Canada, which has been exacerbated by President Trump's suggestions that Canada should become the 
51st U.S. state. WREG (CBS-3) (05/18, Moore, Moon) reported that during his appearance on Fox News, Director Patel called Memphis the "Homidde 
Capital of America." "I didn't know this until my confirmation process, but Memphis, Tennessee, is the homicide capital of America per capita — didn't 
know that, we have a problem there," Director Patel told Fox News. "We're now addressing it. We're rolling out one of our task forces to Tennessee!'

Ex-FBI Director Comey Meets With Secret Service Over '8647' Post 
Reuters (05/17, Trotta, Clilacu) reported that former FBI director James Comey met with the U.S. Secret Service on Friday, after he was called in to 
discuss a social media post that President Trump's supporters claimed was a threat against the president. According to the article, federal law 
enforcement agencies were investigating an Instagram post by Comey on Thursday with a photo of the number 8647 formed by seashells on sand with 
the comment, "Cool shell formation on my beach walk." The article explained that in U.S. slang, the number 86 can be used as a verb meaning to throw 
somebody out of a bar for being drunk or disorderly. President Trump is the 47th president of the United States. Comey, who was fired by Trump in 2017, 
took down the post after a backlash from Trump supporters, saying on Instagram, "It never occurred to me, but I oppose violence of any kind, so I took 
the post down." Some Trump supporters interpreted the message as a call to violently remove Trump from office, including through assassination. The 
Merriam-Webster Dictionary says on its website that one recent meaning of the term 86 was "to kill," but that it had not adopted it "due to its relative 
recency and sparseness of use." "He knew exactly what that meant," President Trump said in an interview with Fox News. The article added that the 
"8647" and "8646" themes have been used as political slogans and on T-shirts during the administrations of both President Trump and his predecessor, 
Democratic President Joe Biden, the 46th U.S. president. The article noted that President Trump himself posted on social media a video that featured an 
image of Biden, who was then president, with his hands and feet tied together in the back of a pickup truck. fox News (05/17, Baehr) added that Deputy 
Director Bongino publicly condemned Comey for his "86 47" Instagram post, which he believes brought shame to the FBI. Deputy Director Bongino noted 
that this latest controversy is part of a general legacy of dysfunction inherited from Comey's leadership, which he and Director Patel are working to fix 
from the inside out. "As I've stated in the past, I cannot post openly about all the things the Director and I are doing to reform the enterprise, but I assure 
you, they are happening," Deputy Director Bongino wrote. "Sadly, many of those agenda items are the result of former Director Comey's poor decision-
making and atrocious leadership. And to those who doubt me, I assure you, when you see what the Director and I see from the inside, it's even worse."

Mexican Indicted in U.S. In First After Cartel Designated as Terrorist Group 
Reuters (05/16, Morland) reported that Maria Del Rosario Navarro, a 39-year-old Mexican national, has been indicted in the U.S. for providing material 
support to Cartel de Jalisco Nueva Generacion (CJNG), a designated foreign terrorist organization. According to the article, Navarro is accused of 
conspiring to provide grenades to CJNG and faces additional charges, including gun trafficking, bulk cash smuggling, and conspiracy to possess a 
controlled substance. The article noted that the indictment is the first of its kind since the U.S. designated CJNG as a terrorist organization in February, 
with the U.S. Justice Department thanking Mexican law enforcement partners for their cooperation. "The arrest of Maria Del Rosario Navarro Sanchez 
should send a clear message to people who wish to align themselves with terrorist groups that they will be sought out and held to the highest extent of 
the law," Director Patel said in the statement. Additional reporting on the story was provided by Al Jazeere (05/17, Staff Writer), Associated Press (05/16,

Court Gives Go-Ahead to Trump's Plan to Halt Union Bargaining for Many Federal Workers 
Reuters (05/16, Raymond) reported that a federal appeals court has lifted an order blocking the Trump administration from stripping hundreds of 
thousands of federal employees of their ability to unionize and collectively bargain. According to the article, the court's decision allows President Donald 
Trump's executive order to move forward, exempting over a dozen federal agencies from obligations to bargain with unions, including the Departments 
of Justice, State, and Defense. The order affects about 75% of the roughly 1 million federal workers represented by unions, with the National Treasury 
Employees Union (NTEU) stating it applies to about 100,000 of its members. The article highlighted that the executive order significantly expanded an 
exception from collective bargaining for workers with duties affecting national security, such as certain employees of the CIA and FBI. Additional
