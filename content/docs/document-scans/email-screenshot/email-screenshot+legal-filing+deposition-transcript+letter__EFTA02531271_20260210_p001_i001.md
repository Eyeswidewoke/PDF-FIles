Re: PRIVATE 
Thank you for your interest I would remind you that the entire conversation=was off the record with your agreement

> Jeffrey, 
> Thank you for returning my call. I want to amplify on some things that we=discussed yesterday. 
> First, as I was not recording our conversation, I trust you too were not. A= much as I want to speak with you, I am 
doing so not as a friend rather as a=writer who is publishing a story. 
> You mentioned something about this 21 year old girl who was really 13 year= old when you met her, who lied to you 
and said she was 21, and ultimately w=s found to be 20 years old. Please can you clarify, thanks. 
> You asked me whether I was co writing a book with Cristine Dolan who had c=ntacted you over the weekend. Is that 
how you spell her name? Did she tell y=u she was co writing a book on child trafficking with me? 
> Since we once again discussed TVPA and the trafficking statutes, if you're=truly interested in learning about TVPA laws, 
ask your criminal attorneys w=o are representing you and Google the mandate per State since each varies. T=ank you for 
updating me on the 16 year old consent law. 
> I am curious why you asked me the reasons behind some of my bad decisions.=Just to clarify when I answered "out of 
a state of lack", I meant because o= a spiritual and physical lack. As you know lack comes from a spiritual emp=iness 
rather than physical-- which eventually manifests in the material. 
> Unfortunately, we all know that everyone's exit strategy is the same. We d=n't come out of this life alive. So whatever 
we do in this lifetime and how=we live our life is important in the big picture because our journey create= many ripples -
-some good and some not so good. Given your many blessings a=d abundance you have an even greater responsibility 
than most to create wav=s of prosperity. 
> Lastly, the reason I asked how you feel and can "live" with all that has t=anspired --now that it is all over-- and how this 
case has impacted your li=e, is important, because I believe there is an emotional component that wil= carry over into all 
your future actions. As you know the law of energy and=attraction are the two most powerful and ongoing physical 
laws. 
> Having known you in another light, I am disturbed that you are in this pre=icament and perplexed at the decisions you 
made given your intelligence. I s=ppose it is immaterial to you except that the repercussions of your actions=will carry 
over and impact future generations and society for many years to=come. I am truly saddened that all of this ugliness 
occurred to someone I k=ow and had great regard for.
