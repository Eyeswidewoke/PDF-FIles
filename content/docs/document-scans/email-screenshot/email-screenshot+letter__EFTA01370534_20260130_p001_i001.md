6) Can you please locate the full e-mail chain that proves that Chip Packards approval actually refers to Epstein's jail 
sentence? The current e-mail attachment uploaded does not refer to what is actually being discussed. — Exco approval 
(from Patrick Campion) already attached to the case (on 6/7/2018) which addresses Epstein's 21 month jail sentence. 
7) Please attach the RDC Alert for Richard Kahn. — Attached 
8) Please provide SOW verification for Jeffrey Epstein. — Attached 
9) Please complete SOW narrative for Caroline and provide SOW verification as well. — Now attached 
10) The SOW narrative for Jeffrey Epstein seems a bit outdated. It still refers to the Financial Trust Company as the SOW 
Company. However, based on the consent of board of directors meeting from 2013, Financial Trust Company merged 
into Southern Financial LLC with Southern Financial LLC as the surviving entity. Please updated the SOW narrative and 
provide research etc for the new entity. — Urgent rush request raised for Southern Financial LLC. SOW already updated 
to reflect the merger in the SOW section for Jeffrey Epstein. 
11) Please explain in detail what this account is being used for. What are the monthly expenses of the company? -
Updated 
12) Please complete the 90 and one year values. The one year value is listed as $1MM, however, the account currently 
has just less than $200K. - Updated 
13) Please provide COGS for Prytanee, LLC. - Attached 
14) The account opened date in the KYC does not match the account opened date in DbForce. Please re-concile. — I see 
the 'Date Opened" section reflects 1/20/2017 for this DB account accessed via the View Customer Accounts & Revenue 
option from the Customer page of this account. Kindly advise if this is still unacceptable? 
15) Please add the state to Darren Indyke and Richard Kahn's address. — Updated for Darren. Mr Kahn is not added as RP 
on this case. 
16) Please add the TAX ID/Identification number for Caroline. - Updated 
17) Please provide proof of delivery for the FinCEN form. Please ensure it was e-mailed by the same person who signed 
the form (Jeffrey Epstein). — Signature verification done through Corporate Resolution (now attached to case) where 
Jeffrey's signature matches with that on the COD form. 
18) Please provide google searches for the appropriate entities and individuals. Please ensure you use the most up to 
date search string that is located in the US country addendum to the KOPs. — Google & Panama searches attached for 
Southern Financial LIC. Latest data string used for all Google searches. 
Kindly advise on comments on Points 10 and 14 above and/or any other point which requires amendments and I will 
complete this case accordingly, thanks.
