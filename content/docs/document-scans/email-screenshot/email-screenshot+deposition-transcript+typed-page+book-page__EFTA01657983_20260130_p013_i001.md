Ninth Circuit Throws Out Oregon Man's Confession About Pointing Laser At Police 
Plane. 
The Oregonian (8/3, Bernstein, 1M) reports that the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals "has thrown 
out a Gresham man's confession to Multnomah County sheriff's deputies that he shined a laser 
at a police plane, finding they violated his Fourth Amendment rights by not telling him he was 
under arrest and questioning him without giving him Miranda warnings. Eight months later, an 
FBI agent arrived at the Gresham man's door, saying he was there to ask 'follow-up' questions 
about the laser incident, which led to an indictment." The appeals court "found that the 
constitutional violations from the Gresham man's first encounter with sheriff's deputies tainted 
the second encounter with the FBI agent. The court said all of the Gresham man's statements 
to investigators should have been suppressed." The Oregonian notes that "in July 2019, Nikolay 
P. Bocharnikov was sentenced to three years of federal probation for aiming the laser pointer at 
an aircraft."
