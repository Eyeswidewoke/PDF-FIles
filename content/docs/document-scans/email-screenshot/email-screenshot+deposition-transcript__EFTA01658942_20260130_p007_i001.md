easier for the police chief to discipline and fire officers by cutting out the role of the labor 
group." The Post adds that Boasberg "rejected arguments made by the union, including that the 
labor group was being unfairly stripped of its ability to help shape the disciplinary process

decision on how to proceed next week."
