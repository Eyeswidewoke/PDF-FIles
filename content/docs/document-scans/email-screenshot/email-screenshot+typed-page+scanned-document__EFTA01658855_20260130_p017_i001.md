FBI Reports Decline In Background Checks For Black Friday Gun Purchases. 
USA Today (11/30, Johnson, 10.31M) reports, "The FBI posted a nearly 8% decline in 
background checks for Black Friday gun purchases, even as the coronavirus pandemic, volatile 
social protests and election-year politics have driven a year-long surge in firearm sales. While 
the 186,645 checks represented a slight drop from 2019, this year's number still marked the 
fourth-largest one day total on record." 
Breitbart (11/30, 673K) reports, "This year has been a record for NICS checks in 
America." In early November, the National Rifle Association-Institute for Legislative Action 
"reported that the number of checks conducted January 2020 through October 2020 alone 
represented '13% more checks than the previous busiest year for the NICS office." 
The Hill (11/30, Budryk, 2.98M) reports, "The U.S. saw slightly fewer Black Friday gun 
sale background checks compared to a year ago but still posted the fourth-highest total on 
record, according to the FBI." The FBI "recorded 186,645 checks the day after Thanksgiving, 
down about 8 percent from 2019. While checks do not correspond directly to sales, they are 
typically an indicator of demand. Black Friday is usually one of the biggest days for background 
checks, and this year's came after civil unrest and the coronavirus pandemic contributed to a 
surge in background checks earlier in 2020."

Newsday (M. (11/30, Kessler, 932K) reports, "A federal judge has refused to overturn the 
convictions of former Suffolk County District Attorney Thomas Spota and a key aide, rejecting 
the defense bid for a new trial and its request to argue that a key government witness 
committed perjury." According to Newsday, "Spota and Christpher McPartland, the chief of the

have raised at the trial all those issues."
