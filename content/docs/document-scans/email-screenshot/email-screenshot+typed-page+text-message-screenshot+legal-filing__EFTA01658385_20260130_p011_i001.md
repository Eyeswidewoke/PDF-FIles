The Washington limes (8/27, Dinan, 492K) reports "Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler took aim 
Wednesday at what he called `a few dozen individuals engaged in violence' who he said have 
allowed the Oregon city to be wrongly portrayed as a dark dystopia' by President Trump and 
others." Wheeler "took some of the blame himself, saying he and other leaders have allowed 
the city's reputation for protest to be hijacked by rioters bent on violence, swamping what 
should have been a thoughtful conversation on racial justice and policing." Said Wheeler, 
"They're intent on creating mayhem and attacking and harming people, not just property. ... 
That's a line that we can't allow our community to cross. Not anymore. Enough is enough." The 
limes adds "the final straw [for the mayor[ appears to have been when rioters brought their 
violence to his doorstep," as "protesters marched on Portland's city hall Tuesday night, breaking 
in and scrawling graffiti." 
Virginia Senate Votes To Ease Sentences For Assaulting Police. 
The AP (8/27, Lavoie) reports that "the Virginia Senate on Wednesday approved legislation that 
would eliminate a six-month mandatory minimum sentence for assaulting a police officer, 
despite strenuous objections from Republicans who said the bill disrespects police at a time 
when they have come under attack during nationwide protests." The Federalist (8/27, Justice, 
126K) indicates the bill would allow "judges discretion to diminish charges from a felony to a 
misdemeanor," and the Washington Free Beacon (8/27, Beyrer, 78K) says "the new legislation 
follows Virginia governor Ralph Northam's (D) administration's recent decisions to grant parole 
to convicted murderers, including Vincent Martin, who was serving a life sentence for murdering 
a police officer." The Daily Caller (8/27, Lancaster, 716K), among other news outlets, also 
reports the story. 
Thousands To March Against Police Brutality In DC Friday. 
The Wall Street Journal (8/27, Jamerson, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) reports that 
thousands of people are expected to march in Washington on Friday to protest police brutality 
against Black Americans. The Journal says the event, which is being organized by Al Sharpton 
and his National Action Network, was planned following the George Floyd's death, but it is taken 
on new urgency in the wake of Jacob Blake's shooting. 
The Washington Post (8/27, Lang, 14.2M) reports that before the Blake shooting, "a group 
of Milwaukee activists set off on a protest march calling for an end to racist policing and 
injustice that would wind through mountains and cross state lines. ... They were heading to the 
2020 March on Washington the old fashioned way: by putting one foot in front of the other." 
The group "began its trek in a Milwaukee parking lot on Aug. 4. Twenty-five days later...the 
group plans to arrive early Friday in the nation's capital." 
PBS' Alcindor: Cawthorn Lifting Self From Wheelchair "Direct Rebuke" To Protesters. 
The Washington Times (8/27, Chasmar, 492K) reports "PBS White House correspondent 
Yamiche Alcindor felt the wrath of the Twitter ratio Wednesday night after she chose to politicize 
the inspiring moment Madison Cawthorn lifted himself from his wheelchair to stand on the 
Republican National Committee stage." Cawthorn, "the 25-year-old Republican nominee" in 
NC11, "was paralyzed from the waist down in a car accident at age 18," and "during his speech 
Wednesday night, he called on Americans to stand up for their country." As "he lifted himself 
into a standing position," Cawthome said, "Be a radical for liberty. Be a radical for our republic 
for which I stand." Alcindor, "who live-tweeted the event, said Mr. Cawthorn's gesture was a 
`direct rebuke' to people protesting against police brutality."
