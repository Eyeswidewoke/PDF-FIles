Judge Rules Dal Must Release Redacted Portions Of Mueller Report Before Election. 
BuzzFeed News (9/30, Leopold, Bensinger) reports a federal judge has ruled "that the Justice 
Department improperly redacted significant portions of the Mueller report and must release 
those sections by Nov. 2, just one day before the presidential election." In a 40-page opinion 
"released Wednesday, US District Court Judge Reggie Walton said the agency violated federal 
law when it redacted sections of the report dealing with, among other things, discussions within 
the special counsel's office about whether to charge certain individuals with crimes." At the 
same time, the judge "ruled that the government was right to redact much of the Mueller report 
under separate exemptions that are designed to protect the integrity of ongoing investigations, 
law enforcement techniques and procedures, and individuals' privacy." 
The Hill (9/30, Neidig, 2.98M) reports the specific redactions "he took issue with cover the 
decisionmaking process within former special counsel Robert Mueller's team over whether to 
charge certain people with crimes during the probe." Walton wrote "the Court concludes that 
the Department has failed to satisfy its burden to demonstrate that the withheld material is 
protected by the deliberative process privilege." 
Newsweek (9/30, Martin, 1.53M) also reports. 
Intel Officials Urged Ratcliffe Not To Disclose Unverified Russian Claims About 
Clinton. 
The Wall Street Journal (9/30, Volz, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) reports DNI Ratcliffe 
ignored pleas from senior US intelligence officials not to release information about Russian 
intelligence containing unverified allegations about Hillary Clinton and the 2016 election, 
according to people familiar with the matter. Intelligence officials feared that sharing the 
information with Congress would give credence to the unsubstantiated allegations. 
Politico (9/30, Desiderio, Cheney, 4.29M), meanwhile, reports that Ratcliffe "raced to 
arrange a briefing for senators on Tuesday night, according to three congressional sources, 
after declassifying [the] unverified Russian intelligence assessment." The "hastily assembled 
briefing...caught staffers off-guard and exacerbated concerns about what Democrats said was 
the deployment of Russian disinformation to support" President Trump's "effort to discredit the 
investigation into his 2016 campaign's contacts with the Russian government." 
Andrew Weissmann Says He Hasn't Been Subpoenaed In Durham Probe. 
CBS News (9/30, Quinn, 3.68M) reports Andrew Weissmann, a former federal prosecutor "who 
was a top official in special counsel Robert Mueller's office, said Wednesday he has not been 
subpoenaed by US Attorney John Durham, who is conducting a sweeping review of the origins 
of the FBI's investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election and the Trump 
campaign's ties to Russia." Weissmann told CBSN, "I have not been subpoenaed and I don't 
anticipate it," adding, "I'm happy to give any information I have. I don't think, given what I 
understand he's looking at, which is the genesis of the Russia investigation, which I was 
involved in, I don't suspect that I'm going to have particularly relevant information." 
The Washington Examiner (9/30, Chaitin, 448K) reports Weissman added, "I don't think, 
given what I understand he's looking at, which is the genesis of the Russia investigation, which 
I was involved in. I don't suspect that I'm going to have particularly relevant information." 
Sen. Graham Suggests Inviting Andrew Weissmann To Testify. The Washington 
Examiner (9/30, Chaitin, 448K) reports Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham 
during a hearing with former FBI Director James Comey on Wednesday "floated an invitation for 
a top prosecutor in former special counsel Robert Mueller's team who has criticized the Russia 
investigation." After noting "that Mueller had declined his invitation to testify, Graham delivered 
a general invitation to committee members in the room to request Weissmann as a witness." 
Graham told Comey, "If you want [Andrew] Weissmann to come, I would invite him." Mueller 
released a "rare statement on Tuesday to defend the Russia investigation as Weissmann has 
gone around in a media blitz to promote his new book and said the special counsel investigation
