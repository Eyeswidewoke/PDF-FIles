KENS-TV San Antonio (11/11, Lynch, 72K) reports from San Antonio, Texas, "A San Antonio 
businessman has been sentenced to 10 years behind bars and ordered to pay up more than $9 
million in restitution after he was convicted tricking investors into giving him money for 
company prospects that instead supplied an `extravagant lifestyle' of VIP Spurs seats and high-
end sports vehicles." Federal prosecutors said Brian Alfaro, "who owns the San Antonio-based 
company Primera Energy, was found guilty of mail fraud by a federal jury earlier this year. A 
release states prosecutors presented evidence showing Alfaro lied to victims over the course of 
three years about where their supposed investment money was going; one of those victims, the 
release states, had their retirement money wiped out by the scheme. Others had to rethink 
strategies of financing college for their children." 
McClatchy (11/10, Koop, 19K) reports, "Alfaro's purchases included VIP season tickets for 
the San Antonio Spurs that cost $100,000; a Lamborghini, Mercedes Benz and Porsche; and a 
"high-end" Rolex watch, prosecutors say. `Today's 10-year prison sentence guarantees that Mr. 
Alfaro will not be driving his Lamborghini to his $100,000 VIP seats at the AT&T Center. 
Instead, he must work to pay back almost $10 million to the victims of his criminal scheme, 
while serving time in prison,' U.S. Attorney Gregg Sofer said in a news release. Alfaro was fined 
$9,922,42 in addition to the prison sentence. 'Alfaro convinced his victims to invest their hard 
earned money in profitable oil and gas ventures, but he stole their money and used it to finance 
an extravagant lifestyle,' FBI Special Agent in Charge Christopher Combs said." 
Former Georgia Tax Official Sentenced For Blackmail, Bribery. 
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution (11/11, 895K) reports former DeKalb County tax official Gerald 
D. Harris was sentenced Wednesday to two years in prison after "admitting that he accepted 
more than $35,000 in bribes to illegally register vehicles, as well as threatened to blackmail a 
person who attempted to bribe him." U.S. Attorney BJay Pak said of the sentence, "By 
accepting bribe payments, Harris sold his integrity for money - and, in doing so, betrayed the 
trust of the citizens of DeKalb County." 
Former Louisiana Financial Adviser Sentenced For Role In Fraud Scheme. 
The Shreveport (LA) Times (11/10, 128K) reports, "Gregory Alan Smith, 58, of Shreveport was 
sentenced Tuesday by United States District Judge S. Maurice Hicks, Jr. to 72 months (6 years) 
in prison followed by three years of supervised release for conspiracy to commit wire fraud, 
Acting United States Attorney Alexander C. Van Hook said. Smith was ordered to pay restitution 
in the amount of $3,588,500, as well as a fine of $100,000." Smith, "formerly a financial 
investment advisor in Shreveport, persuaded multiple victims to invest approximately $3.5 
million with his co-defendant, Kirbyjon H. Caldwell. According to evidence presented to the 
court, Smith began approaching existing clients, friends, and acquaintances in the spring of 
2013 about an investment opportunity in historical Chinese bonds. Smith told these potential 
investors that they would be obtaining a partial ownership interest in the bonds and that they 
would receive exponential returns on their investments in a short period of time." 
WVLA-TV Baton Rouge, LA (11/11, Nadrich) reports, "Court documents reveal Smith 
received $1.08 million of the total $3.5 million and used it to pay down loans, purchase two 
luxury sport utility vehicles, place a down payment on a vacation property, and maintain his 
lifestyle. According to court documents, Smith persuaded multiple victims to invest the 
approximately $3.5 million with his co-defendant, Kirbyjon H. Caldwell, pastor of a Houston 
megachurch. In evidence presented to the court, Smith began approaching existing clients, 
friends, and acquaintances in the spring of 2013 about an investment opportunity in historical 
Chinese bonds. Smith told these potential investors that they would be obtaining a partial 
ownership interest in the bonds and that they would receive exponential returns on their 
investments in a short period of time." The FBI conducted the investigation.
