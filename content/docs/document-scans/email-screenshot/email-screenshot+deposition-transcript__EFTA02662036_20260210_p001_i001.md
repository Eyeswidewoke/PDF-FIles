Leon, 
Yesterday , I again spent hours upon hours of my time =A0with your office. ,( speak to brad to get flavor) and you and i 
wi=l discuss the results in gory gruesome detail on Friday. it mirrored=many other weeks spent doing the things that I 
don;t have the time t= do. 
In =rder to keep things in perspective, maybe reviewing an analogy I ha=e used before with you, might be helpful. 
You and your fa=ily are a 6 billion dollar corp. with an income between 250 -50= million dollars per year. It contains a 
few operating biz'=s , a large wide array of existing investments, in various categories, a=C2 desire to enter into others. 
A panoply of loans, notes. =urchases, wide range of all types of taxes. , pla=es. boats homes.. trusts ,grats. a crazy 
number of bank =ccts. ( with no oversight ) . law firms, acct firms, 800 page tax returns,=C2 foreign firms. art 
consultants. construction consultants =ill payers, home mgmt.,vast multitude of Ilc's , =ncluding foreign, and with all 
that you only have a combined=C2 overhead of less that 3 million dollars. 
=C2 I have previously sent you the very same note that i hav= enclosed again below ,this time with highlights . I 
wro=e it to you over a year ago. As my acute disability ( se=ective memory) seems to have been raised as one of your 
concer=s , as a rule I try to memorialize things in writing in =n attempt to lay out issues that I fear may later turn o=t 
to be a problem. ie what i would and wouldn't do , -=my responsibilities. etc and those things that are not. below =ou 
will find details of things that I thought needed to =be done, so that you wouldn't find yourself in the very =AO place 
where you currently find yourself. however ,you chose to de=er many of my suggestions- see below -,until only weeks 
ago. ! =you chose to defer the jpm acct. the art partnership on a=d on - into this year. and though the 60- 50 40 timber 
emails all ca=ried with it a clear warning that you needed to do something re personnel=C2 if it were to stabilize,- you 
chose to wait. 
=C2 
ONE YEAR =GO
