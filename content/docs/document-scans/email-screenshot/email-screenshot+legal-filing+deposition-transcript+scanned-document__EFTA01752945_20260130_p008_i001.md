the very word is treasonable. From a strictly aesthetic point of view, it would thus be preferable for O=ama 
administration officials to discard disingenuousness in favor of the f=ll Saudi: "It's up to Egypt to make its own 
decisions," etc. Aft=r all, the United States needs to stay on Egypt's good side in order to ensure immediate access to the 
Suez Canal, c=lm relations with Israel and so forth. And there's no reason to believe th=t Washington has any leverage 
with Cairo right now. Obama's decision to ha=t the delivery of those fighter planes, tanks, helicopters, and missiles --
baubles to which Egypt's milit=ry is addicted -- simply bounced off the hide of the generals now calling =he shots in 
Cairo. (Egypt's foreign minister has spoken of turnin= to Russia for arms.) If Eg=pt has become -- once again -- an 
autocratic ally, why should Washington b=ther to pretend otherwise? 
The answer is that =gypt is not Saudi Arabia: a people who have earned their freedom in the st=eets will not continue to 
passively accept the new military dispensation, =specially once the bogeyman of the Brotherhood has lost some of its 
scare value. The Napoleonic aura of coup =eader Abdel Fattah al-Sisi will fade, especially if he becomes president a=d is 
thus held responsible for the failures of government. If Egyptians tare to the streets again to protest against their 
government, and are once again mowed down by Army bullets or=thrown into jail for chanting in Tahrir, they will be 
looking to the U.S. =or support, as they did in 2011. For that reason, it would be a terrible m=stake for Washington to 
cut off all aid to Egypt and to declare the country a lost cause. In fact, the Oba=a administration should increase targeted 
economic assistance, whether or =ot it reduces military aid. But precisely because there is reason to hope =or a better 
future, the United States should hold Egypt to the democratic values of the revolution -- eve= at a moment when so 
many Egyptians have lost sight of them. Diplomacy is =ot, of course, about saying what is in your heart; it's about saying 
whate=er is most likely to produce the outcome you seek. Right now, nothing America says or does, positive or neg=tive, 
will do much to produce the outcome it seeks in Egypt. That being so= "mutual respect," to use another expression from 
Obama's 2009 s=eech, should dictate greater honesty about Egypt's failures.

Egypt-Ethiopi= Nile talks end on sour note 
=yah Aman <http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/contents/=uthors/ayah-aman.html> 
November 7, 2013-- =hartoum, Sudan — Disputes and disagreements erupted again between Egypt =nd Ethiopia 
concerning the Nile R=ver dam construction, after=both countries failed to reach an agreement governing the Ethiopian 
Renais=ance Dam in their initial negotiating session. The attempt at dialogue quickly ended, while the crisis of trust 
=etween the two countries resurfaced as their fears that the other might ap=ropriate the Nile's waters became evident. 
Egyptian, Ethiopian=and Sudanese ministers of water resources met in the Sudanese capital Khar=oum on Sunday, Nov. 
4, to begin the first round of negotiating sessions se= to deal with the Renaissance Dam, as well as to consult with each 
other on the mechanisms needed to complete=it, and how to implement the recommendations of an international 
committee=of technical experts. The latter concluded its activities on May 27 after =tudying the effects of the dam on 
the water security of Egypt and Sudan.
