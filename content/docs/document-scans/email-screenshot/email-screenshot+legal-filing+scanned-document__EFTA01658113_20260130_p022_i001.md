separate incidents." The arrests were part of Operation Cerberus, which was an undercover

Cohen Released From Prison, Ridge Says He Was Retaliated Against. 
ABC World News TonightVi (7/23, story 9, 0:15, Muir, 6.89M) reported that "the President's 
former fixer, Michael Cohen, is moving from prison back to home confinement" after a judge's 
finding that "the Justice Department abruptly sent Cohen back to prison as retaliation for 
writing a book about President Trump due out this fall." Cohen, said NBC Nichtly NewsVi (7/23, 
story 7, 0:20, Holt, 5.52M), "will serve the rest of his sentence for campaign finance violations 
at home." The Los Angeles Times (7/23, Megerian, 4.64M) indicates that "the startling 
accusation by the judge, who ordered officials to release Cohen on Friday, provided the latest 
accusation that government lawyers have been serving the president's personal interests, and it 
raised concerns that the administration was attempting to silence an adversary in an election 
year." 
The AP (7/23, Neumeister) reports that on Thursday, US District Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein 
ruled that Cohen's First Amendment rights "were violated when he was ordered back to prison 
on July 9 after probation authorities said he refused to sign a form banning him from publishing 
the book or communicating publicly in other manners. ... `How can I take any other inference 
than that it's retaliatory?' Hellerstein asked prosecutors, who insisted in court papers and again 
Thursday that Probation Department officers did not know about the book when they wrote a 
provision of home confinement that severely restricted Cohen's public communications." 
On its website, CNBC (7/23, Mangan, 3.62M) quotes Hellerstein as saying, "I've never 
seen such a clause, in 21 years in being a judge and sentencing people." According to CNBC, 
"At one point, when another prosecutor tried to come to the aid of the prosecutor who was 
answering the judge's questions, Hellerstein angrily cut him off, reminding him of the rule that 
only one lawyer argued for each side in a case." Hellerstein said "the purpose of transferring Mr. 
Cohen from furlough and home confinement to jail is retaliatory, and it's retaliatory because of 
his desire to exercise his First Amendment rights to publish a book and discuss anything about 
the book or anything else he wants on social media and others." 
The New York Times (7/23, Weiser, 18.61M) reports that Hellerstein "ordered that Mr. 
Cohen be released from prison on Friday to serve the rest of his sentence in home confinement 
at his Manhattan apartment." According to the Times, "In his suit, Mr. Cohen claimed that he 
never hid the fact that he was writing a book about Mr. Trump. He noted that he spent his 
mornings working on the manuscript `in plain sight' in the prison's law library, and said he also 
discussed the project openly with prison officials, staff members and even other inmates." 
Cohen's lawsuit reads, "The narrative describes pointedly certain anti-Semitic remarks against 
prominent Jewish people and virulently racist remarks against such Black leaders as President 
Barack Obama and Nelson Mandela." The Washington Post (7/23, Jacobs, 14.2M), Politico 
(7/23, Gerstein, 4.29M), Bloomberg (7/23, 4.73M), Reuters (7/23, Freifeld), Axios (7/23, 
Rummler, 521K), USA Today (7/23, Phillips, 10.31M), the Wall Street Journal (7/23, O'Brien, 
Subscription Publication, 7.57M), and Breitbart (7/23, Bleau, 673K), among other news outlets, 
have more on the ruling returning Cohen to home confinement.
