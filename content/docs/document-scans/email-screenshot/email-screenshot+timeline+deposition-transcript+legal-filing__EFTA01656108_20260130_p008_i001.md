miles away at Kelce's home in Leawood, Kansas, the next day. Twenty-thousand dollars was taken, according to a

Florida Man Pleads Guilty to Threatening to Kill Muslims in Michigan, Feds Say 
CBS News (11/20, Buczek) reported that a Florida man accused of repeatedly threatening to kill members of an 
American Muslim organization in Michigan has pleaded guilty to federal charges. According to court documents, 
Michael Shapiro, 72, of West Palm Beach, placed three phone calls to the Council on American-Islamic Relations 
Michigan Chapter (CAIR-MI) in Canton Township in December 2023. In all three instances, Shapiro reportedly left 
threatening voicemails. Prosecutors say Shapiro placed his first call to CAIR-MI on Dec. 8, 2023, twice saying, "I'm 
going to kill you bastards." The article quoted Cheyvoryea Gibson, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI in Michigan, 
who said, "Michael Shapiro's guilty plea for threats motivated by religious bias underscores the FBI's unwavering 
commitment to protecting individuals from hate and intolerance, this conviction serves as a powerful 
demonstration of the serious consequences faced by those who engage in hate-fueled threats, sending a clear 
warning to others." 
Urologist Who Sexually Abused Patients is Sentenced to Life in Prison 
The Associated Press (11/20, Staff Writer) reported that a former doctor was sentenced Wednesday to life in prison 
after being convicted of sexually abusing multiple patients, including children, over the span of years in the New 
York area. Darius A. Paduch, a former urologist, was found guilty in May following a trial where 11 victims testified 
about being abused by Paduch and dozens more submitted statements to the court, federal prosecutors said. The 
article added that Paduch, 57, has maintained his innocence and has said some of his methods of touching patients 
were medically necessary. Prosecutors said Paduch sexually abused patients at a prominent hospital in Manhattan 
from at least 2007 to 2019 and then continued to abuse patients after he began practicing at a different hospital on 
Long Island. He invited at least one victim to his boat, where prosecutors said Paduch provided the victim with 
sedatives and sexually assaulted him. A DOJ press release noted that the FBI was involved in the investigation. The 
New York Times (11/20, McFadden), and New York Post (11/20, Griffin) also reported on the story. 
Corrections Worker, Detainees Charged With Smuggling Contraband at D.C. Jail 
The Washington Post (11/20, Hermann) reported that a corrections officer at the D.C. jail and three people 
awaiting trial in murder and assault cases have been indicted on charges of smuggling contraband into the facility, 
including a knife, drugs, and cellphones, according to the U.S. attorney's office for D.C. The article added that two 
women were also indicted in the case on charges alleging they packaged the contraband into Tupperware 
containers concealed in prepared food and brought them to the jail, formally called the Central Detention 
Facility. Authorities identified the corrections officer as Rashaad Roper, 36, of Gaithersburg, Maryland. He was 
released following an initial appearance in U.S. District Court on Tuesday, where a judge ordered him to stay away 
from the D.C. jail and people incarcerated there. The article mentioned that the smuggling case was investigated by 
the FBI's Washington Field Office and the D.C. Department of Corrections Office of Investigative Services, court 
records show. The indictment covers a period starting in February but authorities said the alleged smuggling 
operation appears to have started many months earlier. D.C. corrections director Thomas Faust said through an 
agency spokesperson that the charges underscore how persistent issues with contraband are for correctional 
facilities. WUSA (CBS-9) (11/20, Gilstrap) also reported on the story.

The New York Post (11/20, Propper) reported that the family of the missing Hawaii woman who vanished in Los

worried after she sent a series of troubling texts to family and friends before she disappeared en route to New York 
for a "bucket list" trip. A missing persons report was filed with the Los Angeles Police Department on Nov. 10, but a 
new video has set off a heightened sense of concern for relatives, a family rep said Wednesday. According to the 
article, the family recently viewed surveillance footage of Kobayashi in downtown Los Angeles that shows she was 
with an unidentified individual near the Pico Metro station on Nov. 11, Kobayashi's aunt, Larie Pidgeon said. The
