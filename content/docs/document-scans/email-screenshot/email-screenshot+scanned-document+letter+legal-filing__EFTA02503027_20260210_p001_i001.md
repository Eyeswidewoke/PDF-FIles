I know that both you and I heard brads'. =AO im out of here if i dont get a coo. . sorry,. i know that n=ither of us have 
stood in the way of his finding/ gettting one.. JPM=account DB account GS account, ??? its MAY 1. nothing in=the first 
quarter and these are only papers that need signing. 
<=iv>l suggest your thinking on my role and compensation for my work m=ght benefit , from a mental shift - think mark 
and josh, without the=mutual resentment ( HAHA) only in terms of sharing ,thanks, =AO I am and have been your 
financial partner i.. rectifying c=rcumstances that appear in hind sight unexplainable. =AO I wish you woudl have asked 
me earllier to review your things , but i u=derstand. I do know that soley as a result of my actions your=personal 
bottom line has increased dramatic=lly, if you had thought of me as your partner in this endeavor =AO, instead of an 
employee, i think your reaction to sharing t bene=its would be different. 
If you recall, you wan=ed me to be paid , unlike others at the END of my work. we dis=ussed this ad nauseum, and 
agreed OCT 15, last year was the end . =AO You had wanted more comfort initially on the art partnershi= so that date 
was delayed. It has now been six monhts since th=n, your concept of aftercare . . for free. was alr=ady unique , in 
your words this has to have an end.( weaned )= if the actions of josh and mark led to one =undred million dollars , 
what would be their share. 
Im =ot sure why it is different in your mind. but i respect the fact that it i=, Is it because 
their work seems harder. it cannot=be simply because they devote more time to you .or it appears to inv=lve more 
effort. I am happy to continue to play a partne=ship role. as I have been in many areas of your life.. I am a=so happy 
to move on and have no more of these emails. I find them as=tedious as you do . if you prefer a partnership structure , 
ok with =e, I tried to minimize the amount of money i would recieve by making=it a flat fee . as i wanted you to feel 
good and have no second thoguths =C2 somehow if the payment comes from a partnership structure you =eem relaxed 
as opposed to writing a check, I focus on =AO trust and friendship first, and the fact that you don't include jos= and 
mark in that category, gives me great pause . I pr=posed 33 percent of money made for you. . in the past you agreed 
tha= amount. it will be huge, but ok with me, I=can talk today at 945 as you suggested. or if you woudl rather over 
the we=kend ok
