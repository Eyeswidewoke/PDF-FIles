COUNTERTERRORISM 
Romanian Citizen Pleads Guilty to 'Swatting' Numerous Members of Congress, Churches, and a Former 
U.S. President 
The Associated Press (06/02, Staff Writer) and Reuters (06/02, Satter) reported that Thomasz Szabo, a 26-year-old 
Romanian citizen, pleaded guilty to a "swatting" plot that targeted a former U.S. president and several members of 
Congress. According to the articles, Szabo pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy and one count of making bomb 
threats and is scheduled to be sentenced on October 23. The plot, which also involved Nemanja Radovanovic of 
Serbia, targeted roughly 100 people with bogus police emergencies, including a former elected official from the 
executive branch who was targeted with a false killing and explosion threat. "Swatting is a serious crime that 
wastes public resources, threatens individuals and communities, and jeopardizes law enforcement personnel," said 
Special Agent in Charge Alvin M. Winston Sr. of FBI Minneapolis in the press release. "This guilty plea is the result of 
significant efforts by the FBI and our law enforcement partners at home and abroad. Together, we will continue to 
ensure that there is no anonymity for offenders who use law enforcement to target public figures, institutions, and 
individuals." Additional reporting on the story was provided by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution (06/02, 
Baruchman), Roll Call (06/02, Tarinelli), Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (06/03, Staff Writer), and UPI (06/02, 
Cone). 
U.S. Citizen Who Trained and Fought for ISIS Sentenced to 10 Years in Federal Prison 
The Associated Press (06/02, Staff Writer) reported that Lirim Sylejmani, a 49-year-old naturalized U.S. citizen, was 
sentenced to 10 years in federal prison for receiving military training from the Islamic State group. According to the 
article, Sylejmani pleaded guilty to the charge and will also serve a lifetime of supervised release after his prison 
term. He had joined the Islamic State in Syria in 2015, engaging in battles against U.S.-led forces, and was captured 
in 2019. "The conduct is far more than a single, impulsive act. He chose to jeopardize the safety of his family by 
bringing them to a war-torn country to join and take up arms for ISIS," prosecutors wrote. The press release noted 
that the case was investigated by the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force. WUSA (CBS-9) (06/02, Sopher) also reported 
on the story. 
Former FBI AD Says U.S. Government Taking 'Dramatically Different Approach' Using Terrorism Charges 
Against Drug Cartels 
Fox News (06/02, Sabes, Papa) reported that the U.S. government is taking a "dramatically different approach" to 
fighting drug cartels by using terrorism charges, according to former FBI assistant director Chris Swecker. "This 
administration is taking a dramatically different approach to fighting drug cartels, who are the most powerful 
criminal organizations on the planet right now," Swecker said. "It is perfect for narco-traffickers because if you can 
go after anyone who supports these trafficking cartels and leaders and members in any way, if they give them a 
paperclip, if they provide financial support, if they work for them, they're a hit man." According to the 
article, Pedro Inzunza Noriega and his son, Pedro Inzunza Coronel, were charged with narco-terrorism, material 
support of terrorism, drug trafficking, and money laundering as members of the Sinaloa cartel's Beltran Leyva 
Organization (BLO) faction. "It also gives us some extra territorial punch, if you will. It gives us the ability, if we want 
to, to dip into foreign countries," he added. The article explained that this approach allows for increased penalties, 
extradition, and the ability to charge anyone who supports or is affiliated with a drug cartel, with potential 
sentences of up to 20 years.
