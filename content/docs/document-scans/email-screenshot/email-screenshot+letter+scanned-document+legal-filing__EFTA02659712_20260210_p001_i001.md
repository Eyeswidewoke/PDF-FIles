LAST YEAR 
transaction complete.!! 
in June and then a=ain Sept, we both agreed to a 50% of phaidon payout., then only after weeks, when you delayed 
any detailed=20 discussion of money wanting to give the issue a thoughtful resp=nse ( which I fully understand ► . you 
unilaterally changed changed our agreement. . Sm would be reserved for the future ? . and out of=the remaining 15m 
,? i would receive only a third. ( note : lim=confident that both the debt , and the artspace investment will also lead to 
a write off of another 30 m. plus=C2 ) In my dining room ,you were surprised when I said that i require most=20 
people to pay their advisory fee up front so that I am assured =hat I will be properly compensated for my work when 
strategies are implemented . you may recall that you appeared offended a=d said " are you suggesting that i would 
go back on my word " I said no = of course not ! you are my closest of friends ,but my experience is that=C2 when 
amounts get large, people tend to get unhappy when it actually comes time for them to pay 
I included in this letter the email i sent to you on April 15, t=e day i was examining your returns It laid out my 
understanding of the compensation for a=20 transaction of the magnitude to the penny of the one just completed. =20 
though the number was great it was clear. When it appeared that the=20 details could now be worked out I was the 
first to say , it is too mu=h money, however. 
From day zero I proposed to di=count to 50 - 60 million the fair price of the transacti=n just completed . including 
Phaidon. . though this amount was already substantially les= than our agreed and negotiated formula. - 
I was never 
told that this =AO was out of range. in fact, alternative methods of payment . plane, =r an -in-kind payment were 
discussed ( ie including keeping the 30m portion of fee outstanding till Marc= ) ,I provided as you specifically 
requested a detailed step b= step execution plan and reviewed all documents that i was given access to.=( Ph=idon 
was not forthcoming ) in order to make my m=ny corrections . I was then told that Alans involvement warranted a 
discount . Even in the best of l=ght , though it is beyond question that not one time in the three ye=rs of his retainer 
has he ever proposed a unique idea. (includin= any wayt to deal with the use issue on debras death ,or eve= the most 
basic review of your largest asset by far , the BRH agreement. ) O.K. - lets say he made a contribution to the pla= and 
stretch reality beyond the pale and say it was 50 %. though no =ne could posit such a large amount unless they were 
wearing a brightly=20 colored clown suit. , the payment associated with the deal was =flown . It had both sent in 
writing and spoken about on the phone nume=ous times , a detailed execution plan was provided . then an= only then 
after all was laid out for the group I was told that after a number o= conversations with brad karp that a total of only 
20m would be paid , (and even that was more tha= originally contemplated ) for both transactions . Leon I feel 1= was 
remarkably unfair. I wondered whether brad even knew of o=r prior agreement.? I called him and he said he was 
never told.?, I wou=d ask that you I and Brad karp sit together if you think it would be helpful. . I would like to sen= him 
this email, with your consent of course. If the transactio=s were never consummated , i would not be owed a dime, 
however , the expect=d fee was known up front. , the detailed step by step plan was f=llowed and overseen by me, the 
amount that I had requested befo=e the transaction was even begun, and had already been heavily discou=ted, out of 
friendship, from our agreement . I believe the decision re onl= paying 20 m has frankly , left me felling quite une=sy.
