NYTimes Examines "Democrats' Doomsday Scenario." Trip Gabriel writes in the 
New York Times (9/2, 18.61M) about "Democrats' Doomsday Scenario for Election Night" -
early results showing President Trump ahead, leading him to declare victory "before heavily 
Democratic mail-in votes, which he has falsely linked with fraud, are fully counted." Twelve 
states currently "do not allow mail-in ballots to be processed before Election Day, including the 
battlegrounds of Michigan, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin." 
The CBS Evening NewsVi (9/2, story 6, 0:40, O'Donnell, 4M) reported, "The potential for 
unrest around the election is a concern for Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. In an exclusive 
interview with Gayle King, Zuckerberg warns what could happen if one candidate declares 
victory prematurely." Zuckerberg: "We're going to take this seriously and make sure that people 
aren't declaring victory and saying that any ongoing counting of votes is evidence of a rigged 
election or anything like that." 
Rich Lowry of Politico (9/2, 4.29M) writes, "Mail-in voting has, like many things in our 
politics, taken on the aspect of tribal warfare. ... Trump shouldn't be trying to delegitimize the 
process, a point that journalists have often made, rightly. Yet there hasn't been enough focus 
on the other side of equation: Does it make sense for Democrats to be such fervent boosters of 
a process that may lead to a historic number of votes cast in a presidential election not 
counting?" Karl Rove writes in the Wall Street Journal (9/2, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) 
that several days without a clear victor in the presidential race could result in extended 
controversy and doubts about the legitimacy of the ultimate winner. 
Groups Plan Campaign To Bolster Faith In Integrity Of Results. Reuters (9/2, 
Reid) reports, "At least a dozen groups are planning a large-scale, bipartisan public relations 
campaign to counter any attempt" by President Trump to "cast doubt on the integrity of the 
November election or dispute the result should he lose." The National Task Force on Election 
Crises "is contacting leading politicians from both major parties, military figures, star athletes, 
faith leaders and business executives, asking them to reassure voters about the integrity of the 
election result if chaos ensues." 
Audit: 68,000 Pieces Of Election Mail "Sat Untouched" At Baltimore Facility 
Before Primary. The Baltimore Sun (9/2, Opilo, 1.33M) reports an audit of US Postal Service 
performance during the Maryland primary election season "has found 68,000 pieces of political 
mail sat untouched at a Baltimore mail processing facility for five days ahead of the June 2 
primary. The audit published Monday says the mail, sent on May 12, 'sat unprocessed' for five 
days before being discovered by management at the facility." 
INTERNATIONAL NEWS 
US To Contribute Funds For Some WHO Programs Despite Withdrawal. 
Bloomberg (9/2, Wadhams, 4.73M) reports President Trump has "agreed to contribute $108 
million to the World Health Organization to fight Covid-19, polio, flu and other diseases in 
vulnerable countries, even as the U.S. prepares to withdraw from the institution he blames for 
early missteps in the coronavirus pandemic." The decision "represents a victory for 
administration moderates who had argued the U.S. would imperil the lives of millions of people 
and undercut its own national security interests if it followed through with Trump's order, made 
in April, to halt all funding for the WHO." The move is "a recognition that no other group has the 
infrastructure or government relationships to fight polio or coronavirus in the countries at risk." 
WPost: Trump's Refusal To Join Global Vaccine Effort Leaves America "Isolated 
And Weak." The Washington Post (9/2, 14.2M) editorializes that President Trump's "refusal to 
join a global vaccine effort organized in part by the World Health Organization is yet another 
example of America isolated and weak." In the past, the United States would "gladly embrace 
such a program as an expression of leadership and lofty ideals - why generations looked to 
America as a beacon of hope." But Trump's "America First" is "a prescription for retreat from the
