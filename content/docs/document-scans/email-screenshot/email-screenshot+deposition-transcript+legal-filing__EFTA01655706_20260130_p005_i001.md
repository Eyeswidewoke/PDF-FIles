the agency's labs for evaluation. The plane was found upside-down in three sections in waist-deep water, and first 
responders were searching miles of the Potomac, John Donnelly, the fire chief in the nation's capital said. The 
helicopter wreckage was also found. Images from the river showed boats around the partly submerged wing and 
the mangled wreckage of the plane's fuselage. American Airlines CEO Robert Isom said the plane was making a 
normal approach when "the military aircraft came into the path" of the jet. The article added that Wednesday's 
crash was the deadliest in the U.S. since Nov. 12, 2001, when an American Airlines flight slammed into a residential 
area of Belle Harbor, New York, just after takeoff from Kennedy Airport, killing all 260 people aboard and five 
people on the ground. The last major fatal crash involving a U.S. commercial airline occurred in 2009 near Buffalo, 
New York. Everyone aboard the Bombardier DHC-8 propeller plane was killed, along with one person on the 
ground, bringing the total death toll to SO. The Associated Press (01/30, Golden, Collins), Associated Press (01/30,

-frump Administration Shakes Up Senior FBI Ranks 
The New York Times (01/30, Goldman, Barrett) reported that a handful of senior FBI employees have been told to 
resign in a matter of days or be fired, as the Trump administration moves to shake up the agency's upper ranks, 
according to people familiar with the discussions. The article stated that the steps came as Kash Patel, the 
president's nominee to lead the agency, sought to assure lawmakers during a contentious, hourslong Senate 
confirmation hearing that he would not begin a campaign of retribution or look backward by pursuing perceived 
rivals. It is unclear whether he was informed of the decisions. The employees given the apparent ultimatum had 
been promoted under former Director Wray, who stepped down as FBI director this month. In an email to 
colleagues, one of the senior agents said he had learned he would be dismissed "from the rolls of the FBI" as soon 
as Monday morning. "I was given no rationale for this decision, which, as you might imagine, has come as a shock," 
he wrote. CNN (01/30, Perez, Cohen) reported that the senior officials are at the executive assistant director level 
or special agent in charge level and include those who oversee cyber, national security, and criminal investigations. 
According to the article, the leadership changes have drawn internal consternation, in part because these officials 
didn't have anything to do with prosecutions of Donald Trump, which have been the focus of the president's ire. 
The article added that Trump has falsely accused agents of abuse in their court-ordered search of his Mar-a-Lago 
home and of their treatment of Capitol rioters and that some agents say the criticism belies the fact that FBI agents 
and supervisors can't choose which assignments they are given as part of their job. The FBI workforce is broadly 
conservative, and many agents initially had qualms about being assigned to the Capitol attack and Trump cases, 
viewing the prosecutions as heavy-handed, people familiar with the matter say. Some DOJ lawyers leading January 
6 cases complained that they believed agents sometimes slow-walked some of their work. NBC News (01/30, 
Dilanian, Richards), the Guardian (01/30, Mackey, Fong, et al.), Washington Post (01/30, Stein, Roebuck), Fox 
News (01/31, Shaw, Spunt), USA TODAY (01/30, Chambers), and KGW (NBC-8) (01/30, Video) also reported on the 
story. 
Internal Emalls Offer Glimpse Into Early Days of Trump Election Inquiry 
The New York Times (01/30, Feuer, Goldman) reported that a series of internal FBI emails released on Thursday 
showed that agents and officials followed standard procedure nearly three years ago when they opened the 
historic criminal investigation into Donald J. Trump's attempts to stay in power after he lost the 2020 election. 
According to the article, the emails were released by the Senate Judiciary Committee in the middle of a 
contentious hearing for the nominee for FBI director, Kash Patel, at which Republicans sought to paint the FBI as a 
politicized agency that improperly went after targets like Trump. The article stated that the emails showed that FBI 
investigators took normal bureaucratic steps and precautions when opening the extraordinarily sensitive inquiry 
into Trump's attempts to overturn the election using slates of electors pledged to him in states he had actually lost. 
According to the article, the emails also revealed the names of several FBI agents and Bureau officials who worked 
on the Trump investigation. The article noted that it is rare for the FBI or the DOJ to disclose the names of specific 
agents working on cases — particularly at a time when public servants are facing rampant threats. Fox 
News (01/30, Singman), and the Washington Times (01/30, Picket) also reported on the story.
