Fox News (9/2, O'Reilly, 27.59M) reports the NSA last year "reportedly recommended that 
the White House abandon the controversial surveillance program, claiming the legal and 
logistical burdens of maintaining it outweigh its benefits to the intelligence community." 
Among outlets also reporting are The Hill (9/2, Neidig, 2.98M), Axios (9/2, Knutson, 
521K), Law360 (9/2, Subscription Publication, 8K), and San Diego (CA) Union-Tribune (9/3, 
Kristina Davis The San Diego Union-Tribune (TNS), 755K). 
Sudanese Government, Citizens Differ On US Deal To Remove Terrorism Label. 
The Christian Science Monitor (9/2, Luck, 246K) reports Secretary of State Mike Pompeo 
recently "offered to lift the U.S. terrorism label off post-revolution Sudan" in exchange for $330 
million in compensation for "Al Qaeda attacks from over two decades ago." Sudan's transitional 
government "reportedly favors the US offer," but among Sudanese citizens "mired in recession 
and lingering poverty, a legacy of ousted dictator Omar al-Bashir's destructive 30-year rule, the 
proposal is encountering resistance." The US has "already lifted sanctions from Sudan in 2017," 
but the terrorism designation "has continued to deter investment in the country." The civilian-
led transitional government "believes that by honoring the previous regime's debts and paying 
compensation for his crimes - and ridding the country of the terrorism list designation and 
stigma - the subsequent access to international financial relief and foreign investment will save 
Sudan's economy." The hope is the benefits "will outweigh any immediate costs several-fold." 
Trial Of Alleged Accomplices In 2015 Attacks Opens In Paris. 
The New York Times (9/2, Breeden, Meheut, 18.61M) reports that on Wednesday, France 
"began revisiting one of the worst chapters in its modern history...as a landmark trial opened in 
Paris for the January 2015 terrorist attacks that killed 17 people in and around the French 
capital." According to the Times, "Over at least the next two months, before the glare of the 
world's media and under tight security, the court is expected to meticulously examine three 
harrowing days that traumatized France, starting with a daytime assault on the offices of 
Charlie Hebdo, a satirical magazine that Islamic extremists targeted after it published cartoons 
lampooning Islam." The Times adds, "The killings were followed by a string of deadly jihadist 
attacks, culminating with assaults in November that year in and around Paris that killed 130 
people, vaulting France into a yearslong state of emergency." 
The AP (9/2, Hinnant, Vaux-Montagny) reports that "those on trial in France's terrorism 
court are accused of buying weapons, cars, and helping with logistics in the January 2015 
attacks." According to the AP, "Most say they thought they were helping plan an ordinary crime. 
Three, including the only woman accused, are being tried in absentia after leaving to join 
Islamic State." 
COUNTER-INTELLIGENCE 
Draft DHS Bulletin Warning Foreign Actors Targeting Biden, Trump Health Not 
Released. 
Jonathan Karl reported on ABC World News TonightVi (9/2, story 6, 2:25, Llamas, 6.93M) that 
a draft DHS intelligence bulletin "alerting local, state and federal law enforcement to a Russian 
scheme to damage Joe Biden's campaign by spreading misinformation that Biden isn't mentally 
fit to be president" was withheld. According to "an email obtained by ABC News, the bulletin 
was supposed to go out on July 9, but it never did. The Chief of Staff to Acting Secretary of 
Homeland Security Chad Wolf put the brakes on, writing, 'Please hold on sending this one out 
until you have a chance to speak to AS1.' AS1 is Acting Secretary Wolf. That was nearly two 
months ago, and the bulletin still has not gone out." Reuters (9/2, Hosenball, Hesson) reports 
that the draft bulletin "also said that Iranian and Chinese media had published materials 
questioning the mental health" of President Trump.
