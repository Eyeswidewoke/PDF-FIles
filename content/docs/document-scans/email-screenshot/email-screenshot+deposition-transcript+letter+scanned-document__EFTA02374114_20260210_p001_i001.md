Time for another video-chat? 
Hi Jeffrey, 
Hope you had a great holiday interval! 
I wonder if you'd have time/interest to schedule another video-chat sometime in the next couple weeks? I'm back in 
Hong Kong now. 
Your generous donation to help support the OpenCog team at HK Poly U 
is very much appreciated; thanks again. Yet, I am also very 
cognizant of how great it would be to move faster.... Al is picking up speed in media and industry these days; yet in spite 
of the exciting progress, there is not so much focus on AGI in the deeper sense (and hence still not that much progress 
being made on the real problem of AGI). Together we could make a big difference in this situation, and move things 
forward dramatically, if we could find a mutually agreeable way forward. 
I had an interesting meeting with Ray Kurzweil and his team at Google a few weeks ago, and if we video-chat I can tell 
you about that, among other things... 
I tried to put together a "grand AGI proposal" for you when you requested it late last year, but apparently it wasn't quite 
to your 
expectation - sorry about that. If you give some more specific 
feedback as to what sort of proposal you'd find most amenable I can probably write one accordingly.... I know what core 
AGI work needs to be done; but project-wise it can be organized and ordered in many different ways. 
Here is one thing on my mind on a personal level. At the moment I'm dividing my time between helping the OpenCog 
AGI team, and 
participating in various narrow-Al projects to pay the bills. It 
would be great to be able to focus solely on AGI. I wonder if you'd 
be willing to sponsor a research fellowship for me at HK Poly U, similar to what you've done for Joscha at MIT, and what 
you did for me at UNM in 2001-2002. 
I realize HK Poly U isn't MIT; but it happens to be where I have an R&D team funded now; and as you know, getting a 
team funded is not an easy trick even at MIT. So having a team funded here for the next 2 years is a Good Thing and a 
Rare Thing, and if I had a research fellowship so I didn't have to spend time on commercial narrow Al projects, then I 
could focus more of my time on leveraging this 
resource. (Also, David Hanson is planning to move here in a couple 
months, which will be good for AGI/robotics collaboration, though of course that's not as key a point as having an AGI 
team funded here.) 
Also, I could spend time on working with you, Joscha or others on shaping the grand AGI proposal into a form where it 
would be more likely fundable by you and your contacts -- so we could move forward with the big-time AGI project we'd 
both really like to see....
