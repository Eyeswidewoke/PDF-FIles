Thirteen Michigan Residents Charged in Nationwide Health Care Fraud Investigation 
CBS News (07/02, Singleton) reported that more than a dozen people in Michigan are facing charges in state and 
federal court in connection with a nationwide health fraud investigation that resulted in charges against 324 
individuals. The charges were filed under the Justice Department's 2025 National Health Care Fraud Enforcement 
Action. According to the U.S. Attorney's Office, the nationwide schemes involved Medicaid fraud as well as the sale 
of controlled substance prescriptions in exchange for cash. Federal investigators seized more than $245 million in 
cash, luxury cars, and other items. Investigators estimated the schemes would have resulted in a $14.6 billion 
financial loss and 15 billion pills illegally distributed. "Today's record-setting Health Care Fraud Takedown sends a 
crystal-clear message to criminal actors, both foreign and domestic, intent on preying upon our most vulnerable 
citizens and stealing from hardworking American taxpayers: we will find you; we will prosecute you, and we will 
hold you accountable to the fullest extent of the law," said Attorney General Pamela Bondi in a statement. "Make 
no mistake — this administration will not tolerate criminals who line their pockets with taxpayer dollars while 
endangering the health and safety of our communities." 
FBI Executes Search Warrant at California Home 
KTTV (Fox-11) (07/01, Staff Writer) reported that a federal search warrant was executed by agents with the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation at a home in Los Angeles Tuesday morning. The FBI and LAPD activity was reported at a 
home in the 1400 block of N. Marine Avenue in the Wilmington neighborhood. The article added that video from 
the scene showed multiple people wearing FBI jackets in the front yard of the home. Under a white awning, people 
who appeared to be residents of the home were seen covered in blankets. According to the FBI, its SWAT team 
was used during the execution of that warrant. The LAPD confirmed units were on scene around 4:35 a.m. 
Continued Reporting: Judge Says Federal Investigators Should Probe Harmony Montgomery's Death 
CBS News (07/01, Staff Writer) reported that a former judge is requesting that federal authorities start an 
investigation into the death of Harmony Montgomery. On Tuesday, retired Judge Carol Erskine handed over pages 
from her own investigation to the U.S. Attorney and FBI in New Hampshire. Erskine wants investigators to look at 
New Hampshire's Division of Children, Youth and Families and whether the department's workers falsified 
records. A New Hampshire jury found Harmony's father, Adam Montgomery, guilty of murder and other charges in 
connection with Harmony's death. Investigators also found Harmony was placed in her father's care even though 
there was evidence she would not be safe there. According to the article, Erskine said she feels New Hampshire's 
legal settlement with Harmony's motherwas an attempt to make the case go away. Harmony's mother, Crystal 
Sorey, filed a negligence lawsuit in 2024. She accused social workers of ignoring signs that Harmony's father 
physically abused her. Earlier this year, New Hampshire agreed to pay Sorey $2.25 million to settle the 
lawsuit. WFXT (Fox-25) (07/01, Kavanaugh, et al.) and the New Hampshire Union Leader (07/01, Phelps) also 
reported on the story.

Continued Reporting: DOJ Announces Arrest, Indictments in North Korean IT Worker Scheme 
The Washington Examiner (07/01, Goldsberry) reported that the Dal arrested a North Korean operative for running 
a fraudulent IT team that stole $900,000 in virtual currency and $5 million in revenue from around 100 U.S. 
companies. According to the article, the scheme, which involved fake identities and shell companies, resulted in $3 
million in damages and compromised 80 identities between 2021 and 2024. The article highlighted that the FBI 
conducted searches across 14 states between June 10 and June 17, resulting in the seizure of 137 laptops and 29 
financial accounts. As the scheme involved shell companies to shield the North Korean actors and the other 
conspirators from China, Taiwan, and the UAE, 21 fake websites were also at the center of the scheme. The Hacker 
News (07/01, Lakshmanan) quoted Assistant Director Roman Rozhaysky of the FBI Counterintelligence Division: 
"North Korea remains intent on funding its weapons programs by defrauding U.S. companies and exploiting 
American victims of identity theft. North Korean IT workers posing as U.S. citizens fraudulently obtained 
employment with American businesses so they could funnel hundreds of millions of dollars to North Korea's 
authoritarian regime." SC World (07/01, Staff Writer) also reported on the story.
