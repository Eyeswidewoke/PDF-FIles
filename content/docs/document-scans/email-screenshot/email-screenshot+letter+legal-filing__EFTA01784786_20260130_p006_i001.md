"In many respects it is now private interests that benefit most fro= our use of military force," he continued. "Whether 
its private=security contractors that are still all over Iraq or Afghanistan, or it's th= bigger-known defense contractors, 
like the number one in the world, Lockheed Martin." 
Journalist Antony Loewenstein detailed how the U.S. privatized its wars in Iraq and Afghanistan in another interview 
with Salon. There are an estimated 30,000 military contractors working for the Pentagon in Afghanistan today; they 
outnumber U.S. troops three-to-one. Thousands more are in Iraq. Lockheed Martin simply "plans to sell every aspect 
of=missile defense that it can," regardless of whether it is needed, Wilkerson=said. 
And what is best to maximize corporate interest is by no means necessarily the same as what is best for average citizens. 
"We dwarf the Russi=ns or anyone else who sells weapons in the world," the retired Army colon.' continued. 
Most importantly we have to deny the corporate interests that demand we go abroad to slay monsters and admit that 
we are the death merchant of the world — and not a titled that we should be proud of.... 
Tipping — Yes or No? 
Or a reason for employers to underpay their employees

As a middle-age African American male who eats in restaurants at least three times a week, down from five times a 
week and being told by close friends that I didn't always tip enough, I was drawn to an article =n *Mother Jones 
Magazine* by Maddlie Oatman *—The Racist, Twisted History of=Tipping 
—* with the sub-titled — Gratuities were once an excuse to =hortchange black people. In fact, they still are. But is it true? 
Most of us don't think twice about handing over 15% to 25% of our bill after eating out at a full-service restaurant. What 
is today considered a given started as a purely aristocratic practice — a mere "'allowance*" that the upper =lass would 
offer to the socially inferior. 
A tip (which is a gratuity) is a sum of money customarily tendered, in addition to the basic price, to certain service sector 
workers for a service performed or anticipated. Depending on the country or location, it may be customary to tip servers 
in bars and restaurants, taxi drivers, hair stylists, and so on. Tips and their amount are a matter of social custom and 
etiquette, and the custom varies between countries and settings. In some locations tipping is discouraged and 
considered insulting; while in some other locations tipping is expected from customers. The customary amo=nt of a tip 
can be a specific range of monetary amounts or a certain percentage of the bill. 
In some circumstances, such as with U.S. government workers and more widely with police officers, receiving gratuities 
(or even offering them) is 
illegal: they may be regarded as bribery. In most European restaurants a fixed percentage service charge is often added 
to bills in restaurants and tipping may not be expected when a fee is explicitly charged for the service. 
From a theoretical economic point of view, gratuities solve the principal-agent problem, and many managers say they 
provide incentive for greater worker effort. However studies of the real world practice show that tipping is often 
discriminatory: workers receive different levels of gratuity based on factors such as age, sex, race, hair color and even 
breast size, and the size of the gratuity is found to be only very weakly related to the quality of service.
