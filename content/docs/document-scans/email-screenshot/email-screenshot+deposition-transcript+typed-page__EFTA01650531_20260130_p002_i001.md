victim, and that there is "no cover-up," "no foreign connection," and "no second shooter," while also disputing public claims that the bureau failed 
to access encrypted devices or overlooked co-conspirators. According to the article, FBI officials detailed months of investigative steps including 
reviewing 2,000 tips, executing search warrants and subpoenas, analyzing Crooks' online activity—Including political statements from 2019-
2020—and reconstructing the explosive device found in his vehicle, which they determined was switched off. The article stated that Director 
Patel and Deputy Director Bongino addressed widespread criticism by explaining why Crooks' posts could not have been acted on without a 
lawful predicate, emphasized that the FBI collected all physical and digital evidence, and noted that the family—not the FBI—chose to cremate 
Crooks after the bureau obtained required DNA samples. The article noted that the FBI has turned over more than 40,000 documents to Congress, 
maintains that Crooks left no manifesto or indication of his motive, and reiterated that the bureau remains open to any credible new leads while 
firmly standing by its conclusion that Crooks acted alone. "Dan and I have been on this since we got here eight months ago. We not only had to 
maintain the chain of command to President Trump, but we had to remind the world that President Trump was the victim — one of the four 
victims — on that day," Director Patel said. "There are victims' rights rules that apply to him, and they don't get erased because he is the 
president." He continued, "We fully briefed the president as a victim of this case, at the White House, providing him with all of the details of our 
investigation, and the president was satisfied with the results and where we left it." Deputy Director Bongino told Fox News: "We are very 
confident in the outcomes of this investigation. We have pulled on every threat We are absolutely confident, and if information surfaces, please, 
immediately get it over to us for instant action. I would ask the public: What motivation would Kash Patel and Dan Bongino possibly have to hide 
from their personal friend — not Just their boss — the president — information about a crime where he was the victim?" Bongino asked. "I don't 
understand what the motivation would be Additional reporting on the story was provided by The Daily Beast (11/22, Neal), The Daily

DOJ Makes a New Attempt to Unseal Epstein Grand Jury Records 
Politico (11/21, Cheney) reported that the justice Department renewed its effort to unseal grand Jury records from the Jeffrey Epstein and 
Ghislaine Maxwell prosecutions, arguing that President 'frump's newly signed Epstein Files Transparency Act now requires public release of 
nearly all investigative flies held by the Justice Department and the FBI. According to the article, DOJ officials said the new law supersedes typical 
grand Jury secrecy rules, even as Judges in Florida and New York had previously rejected unsealing requests and noted that the department 
already possessed large amounts of material it could release without court action. The article noted that the push to unseal the records followed 
backlash among Trump supporters after the FBI announced it had no evidence linking Epstein's alleged trafficking ring to numerous high-profile 
associates, and that the new law mandates the release of DOJ-FBI records by mid-December. Bloomberg (11/21, Leopold) added that the FBI 
deployed uniformed police officers to guard its Central Records Complex in Winchester, Virginia, after online commenters—reacting to 
unsubstantiated claims by Mark Epstein that Director Patel was leading a "coverup"—suggested protesting or even attempting to obtain the 
Epstein files themselves. According to the article, FBI personnel interpreted the social-media comments as potentially threatening and assigned 
officers who normally patrol FBI headquarters to protect the facility, its staff, and top officials, while an FBI spokesperson did not respond to 
requests for comment. The article noted that FBI agents had previously spent months at the Winchester facility reviewing and redacting the 
Epstein files—over 300 gigabytes of material—before sending processed records to AG Bondi. USA TODAY (11/21, Schermele) reported that Bill 
and Hillary Clinton have been called to give depositions at the House Oversight Committee in December. The depositions are part of a GOP-led 
probe into Jeffrey Epstein, with Rep. James Comer warning that avoiding them would defy congressional subpoenas. The article explained that 
both Bill Clinton and President Donald Trump had friendships with Epstein in the past, but have denied knowledge of his alleged criminal 
conduct The Associated Press (11/22, Riddle) reported that several of Jeffrey Epstein's accusers are experiencing a mix of hope, fear, and anxiety 
ahead of the forthcoming release of Justice Department files that President Trump ordered to be made public, with some survivors believing the 
records may fill in gaps in their memories or reveal the broader sco 
of abuse. According to the article, the FBI and police in Palm Beach first 
began investigating Epstein in the mid-2000s, and accusers such as 
and 
said they hope the files will finally 
provide transparency, accountability, and answers that court proceedings and past investigations never delivered. The article noted that many 
survivors remain deeply concerned that the documents might be redacted, manipulated, or expose victims who wish to remain anonymous, 
creating renewed trauma even as some cautiously celebrate what feels like their first real step toward Justice in nearly two decades. Additional

Director Patel Visits St. Louis Field Office for Update on Regional Crime Operations 
Spectrum Local News (11/21, Palermo) reported that the FBI's "St. Louis Summer Heat" operation resulted in 276 arrests, recovery of 111 
weapons, and seizure of large quantities of methamphetamine and fentanyl. According to the article, the operation is part of a larger effort to 
address violent crime in the St. Louis region, which includes an influx of FBI agents and a permanent commitment to providing additional law 
enforcement resources. The article noted that Deputy Co-Director Andrew Bailey and Missouri Sen. Eric Schmitt announced the results, with 
Schmitt emphasizing that this is a longterm effort to make communities safer, not a one-time Initiative. The article highlighted that Director 
Patel was also in St Louis Friday for meetings with agency personnel and local law enforcement Deputy Co-Director Bailey said the operation 
falls in line with Director Patel's push to move personnel out of the agency's headquarters and into field offices to address violent crime. The 
article also noted that earlier this year, Schmitt and Director Patel announced an influx of FBI personnel to the St. Louis field office that was 
described at the time as the largest per capita infusions of full-time agents and Intel personnel in the nation:' After the news conference, Schmitt 
posted a video with Director Patel talking about the visit, and Patel said "You're gonna see what we can do just like we did in places like Memphis 
right here in St Louis and we're excited to get to work." Additional reporting on the story was provided by KMOV (CBS-4) (11/21, Trager), KTVI

FBI Letters Send Shivers Through California's Political Inner Circle 
The New York Times (11/21, Rosenhall) and the Washington Examiner (11/21, Chakraborty) reported that the indictment of Gov. Gavin 
Newsom's former chief of staff, Dana Williamson, on 23 felony counts — and the arrival of FBI letters notifying California politicians, aides, and 
lobbyists that their calls and texts had been captured on a wiretap — has sent shock waves through Sacramento's tightknit political class. Federal 
prosecutors say Williamson was at the center of a scheme to divert $225,000 from a dormant campaign account for Xavier Becerra to his top aide 
Sean McCluskle via businesses tied to Williamson and lobbyist Greg Campbell, while numerous letter recipients now worry about how far the
