YE progress - please edit (I] 
Classification: For Internal use only 
Andrew, 
I was hoping to get this to you before you started working on YE reviews. I know you have a ton of reviews to do every 
year, but given our last breakfast conversation, I would like you to spend some extra time on mine this year. Happy to 
catch up whenever you like to refine the conversation and the broader messaging. And apologies for the length of this —
lots to cover and I thought it would be best to start with an email to lay it all out. 
I think you and I have consistently been on the same page about the opportunities and challenges I have here and my 
performance in light of both. I appreciate the support you've given me and hope you know how much I value having 
you in my corner, especially since Chip left. As you know, I'm focused on a short list of things here. Primarily, I want to 
add value to DB and our clients above all else. You know I enjoy what I do, so results and progress are really what 
matter to me. After three years here during an extremely difficult time for the bank (and our group specifically), I feel I 
need to be recognized for both my efforts and contributions and need to progress to the next level in terms of 
compensation and title. 
Brief history: 
Hired in 2014 to focus on investments given 16yr+ (now 20yr) career in structured fixed income and equity products 
12yr relationship with Chip ensured that he knew my capabilities and deep level of client relationships 
Initially teamed up with Paul Morris, who left DB in early 2016 
When I joined, KCP was fairly new and ISG was nonexistent. Paul was having limited success. 
At various times, I have been offered positions as head of ISG or part of KCP 
Financial progress: 
2014 revenues (Paul)— $0.9mm 
2015 revenues (combined) — 1.3mm

2017 performance highlights: 
Third Lake — had major relationship breakthrough in 2016. Won $107mm in deposits in DBTCA across 18 accounts. All 
deposits and 16 accounts were gone by the end of the year due to the DOJ news (the two remaining open accounts had 
less than $1 in them). Family CIO also left in 2016. Rebuilt trust in DB throughout 2017. Have opened 37 new accounts 
this year, including for family office employee who isn't part of the family. Have received $130mm in new deposits this
