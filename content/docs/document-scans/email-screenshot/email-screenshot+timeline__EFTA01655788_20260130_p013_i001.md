The Houston Chronicle (02/29, Ferguson) reported that Brian Scott Jackson, a 48-year-old man from Katy, pleaded 
guilty on Wednesday to assault charges for his actions during the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot, as stated by the U.S. 
Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia. Jackson, who was arrested in June 2022 alongside his brother Adam 
Lejay Jackson, threw an American flag attached to a long pole at police officers trying to block rioters from storming 
the Capitol. According to the article, both brothers had attended former President Donald Trump's "Stop the Steal" 
rally and later boasted about their involvement in the riot on social media and in text messages, with Brian Jackson 
expressing pride in his actions and using racial slurs. The article noted that Adam Jackson also pleaded guilty to 
assaulting officers and is scheduled for sentencing in March. 
Trump's Immunity Bid Isn't the Only Jan. 6 Case at the Supreme Court in April 
MSNBC (02/29, Rubin) reported that the Supreme Court is set to hear not only former President Donald Trump's 
immunity claim in April but also the case of Joseph Fischer, an alleged January 6 rioter, a week earlier. Both cases 
involve the same obstruction law, but their circumstances differ significantly. According to the article, Trump's case 
pertains to the broader attempt to overturn the 2020 election results, while Fischer's focuses on the statute's 
application against him specifically. The article explained that the outcome of Fischer's case could inform the 
federal election interference trial involving Trump, particularly if the Supreme Court's decision impacts how the 
obstruction charge can be utilized. The article noted that this sequencing potentially benefits Special Counsel Jack 
Smith, as it clarifies the legal landscape regarding the obstruction statute before Trump's trial proceeds, assuming 
the Supreme Court does not grant him immunity. 
Opinion: The Pipe Bombs Before Jan. 6: Capital Mystery That Doesn't Add Up 
An opinion piece by The Epoch Times (02/29, Kelly) reported that the discovery of pipe bombs near the DNC and 
RNC headquarters on January 6, 2021, remains an unsolved case filled with anomalies, including a bomb-sniffing 
dog's failure to detect the bombs and the mysterious circumstances surrounding their placement and potential to 
detonate. According to the article, despite the DOD's extensive investigations into the Capitol riot, the individual 
responsible for planting the bombs has not been apprehended, and interest in solving this act of domestic 
terrorism seems to have waned among official Washington and major news organizations. The author assessed 
that the unresolved nature of the case, combined with the lack of transparency and accountability, has contributed 
to a growing distrust in the govemment's handling of the situation.

OTHER FBI NEWS 
Judge Fines Ex-Fox News Reporter, Catherine Herridge, for Not Revealing Sources 
The New York Times (02/29, Robertson) reported that a federal judge held a veteran investigative reporter in 
contempt of court on Thursday for not revealing her sources for articles she wrote about a scientist who was 
investigated by the FBI. The article added that the journalist, Catherine Herridge, formerly of CBS News and Fox 
News, was ordered to pay $800 a day until she divulged the information. The judge, Christopher Cooper of the U.S. 
District Court in Washington, stayed the fine for 30 days to give Herridge time to appeal. The article stated that the 
case, which has alarmed First Amendment advocates, relates to a series of articles that were written by Herridge 
and her colleagues in 2017, while she worked at Fox News. The articles revealed that the FBI had investigated the 
scientist, Dr. Yanping Chen, a Chinese American who is the president of the University of Management and 
Technology in Arlington, Va., over suspicions of Chinese military ties and whether she had lied on U.S. immigration 
forms. The FBI ended its investigation without bringing charges against Dr. Chen, a year before Herridge and her 
colleagues published and aired their reporting. According to the article, in 2018, Dr. Chen sued the FBI and other 
government agencies, accusing them of violating the Privacy Act by leaking information to Herridge. The Privacy 
Act has protections for personal information collected by federal agencies. The article stated that Judge Cooper 
ruled last year that Herridge must reveal her confidential sources. On Thursday, he held her in civil contempt for 
disobeying that order. He said he had not issued the order lightly, deciding that Dr. Chen's need for the information 
overcame Herridge's First Amendment protections. The Associated Press (02/29, Richer, Tucker), National 
Review (02/29, Bernstein), Washington Post (02/29, Barr), CNN (02/29, Darcy), Daily Wire (02/29, Saavedra), Daily 
Caller (02/29, Angela), and the Los Angeles Times (02/29, Battaglia) also reported on the story.
