The New York Times (10/8, Sijabat, Paddock, 18.61M) reports that on Thursday, riot police 
"fired tear gas and water cannons" in Jakarta as "they tried to disperse large crowds of people 
protesting a sweeping new law that slashes protections for workers and the environment." Tens 
of thousands of workers "took part in the third day of a national strike against the deregulation 
law," marching on foot and riding "in motorbike parades as sound trucks blared protest 
messages." Union leaders "denounced Parliament and President Joko Widodo for pushing the 
measure through." 
NYTimes: Russia Must Step In To Freeze Conflict In South Caucasus. 
In an editorial, the New York Times (10/8, 18.61M) says that, "once again, the bitterly 
contested claims to the mountainous region of Nagorno-Karabakh in the South Caucasus have 
erupted into violence" between Azerbaijan and Armenia. In the past, the US, Russia, and 
France "have managed to restore calm, though never establish a permanent peace," but this 
time "a dangerous new element has to be confronted. That is Turkey." The Times says that the 
Trump Administration "is not one likely to care about the fighting, even if it were not deeply 
embroiled in the pandemic and the election campaign," and "France alone can do little." 
However, "doing nothing is not an option for dealing with a wildfire that, left unchecked, can 
rapidly spread," so whether Russia President Vladimir Putin "likes it or not, he has the greatest 
responsibility and the most effective levers to restrain his former empire-mates and dissuade" 
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan "from a dangerous adventure." 
WPost: Jailed Vietnamese Dissident A "Champion Of Democracy." 
In an editorial, the Washington Post (10/8, 14.2M) says the arrest of Vietnamese democracy 
activist Pham Doan Trang "is the latest and one of the most flagrant in Vietnam's long practice 
of squelching freedom of expression and political dissent, including arrests of bloggers and 
independent journalists." The "repression appears to be intensifying ahead of a Congress of the 
Communist Party of Vietnam, held every five years, expected in January." Her arrest "came just 
hours after the United States and Vietnam had finished the 24th Annual US-Vietnam Human 
Rights Dialogue." The Post says, "That Vietnam would seize its best-known democracy activist 
on the heels of the meeting says much about the diminished standing of the United States in 
the world under President Trump, who has repeatedly ignored human rights abuses while 
cozying up to the world's despots." The Post concludes by calling Trang "a selfless and 
courageous champion of democracy."
