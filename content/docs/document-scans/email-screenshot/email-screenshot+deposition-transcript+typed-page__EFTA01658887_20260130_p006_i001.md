FBI Probing Post-Election Vandalism Targeting Government. 
The Oregonian (11/13, Bernstein, 1M) reports, "Federal officials are investigating a cluster of 
vandalism that appears to target government employees in the Pacific Northwest and Portland 
area in the wake of the presidential election, according to a federal source familiar with the 
cases." According to the Oregonian, "On Wednesday morning, a federal law enforcement 
officer's unmarked take-home work vehicle was set on fire outside his Washington County 
home. The officer works at a federal building in downtown Portland, the source said. The FBI, 
the U.S Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, Washington County Sheriff's 
Office and Tualatin Valley Fire & Rescue are investigating the fire. No arrest has been made, 
sheriff's Sgt. Robert L. Rookhu9zen said Friday." 
Trump Denounces "Antifa Scum" For Clashes After His Supporters DC Rally. 
The Washington Times (11/15, Mordock, 492K) reports President Trump on Saturday "slammed 
'ANTIFA SCUM', the media and D.C. mayor Muriel Bowser as pro-Trump supporters and leftist 
activists violently clashed in Washington." The Times adds, "More than 20 people were arrested, 
according to statements from the U.S. Park Police and the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department. 
D.C. Police said two of its officers were injured late Saturday evening." 
Trump campaign senior adviser Jason Miller said on Fox News' MediaBuzz (11/15, 536K) it 
is "shameful that some of the competing networks whether it be CNN or MSNBC have not 
covered it the way that they should. The fact of the matter is these were peaceful protesters, so 
to speak, folks who were going to talk about their support for President Trump, and out of 
nowhere Antifa and these BLM protesters come in and start hitting them. ... These aren't Trump 
supporters that are showing up and committing the violence. I think the media needs to cover 
this, and I do think that whether it be the DC police or the DOJ, there have to be immediate 
crackdowns on groups like Antifa because this isn't how society is supposed to wok." 
Nearly Two Dozen Arrested In Washington, DC Trump Protests. 
The AP (11/15, Khalil, Freking) reports, "Demonstrations over President Donald Trump's loss at 
the polls have resulted in charges against nearly two dozen people in Washington, including a 
person accused of setting off a commercial firework and four people accused in an assault that 
left the victim unconscious on the street." According to the AP, "The arrests came during and 
after protesters and counterdemonstrators clashed Saturday in Northwest Washington. Several 
thousand people rallied during the day in support of Trump, whose motorcade briefly drove by 
the gathering protesters Saturday morning on the way to the president's Northern Virginia golf 
club. Trump supporters marched from Freedom Plaza to the Supreme Court Building, across 
from the Capitol, during the day. Their activities and those of counterdemonstrators grew 
increasing tense and took a violent turn in the early evening." 
WPost Analysis: Following Summer Of Demonstrations, Americans Voted In Favor Of 
Criminal Justice Reform. 
A Washington Post (11/13, Berman, Jackman, 14.2M) analysis says that after going into "the 
streets for extended demonstrations this summer to protest police violence and racial injustice," 
Americans "took to the voting booth" on Election Day "to endorse criminal justice and policing 
reforms." Americans "backed a string of measures increasing police oversight, elected reform-
minded prosecutors, loosened drug laws and passed other proposals rethinking key elements of 
law enforcement and justice in their communities." The Post adds, "These votes, taken together, 
signal that after a summer of protest brought renewed scrutiny to the justice system, many 
Americans were open to rethinking how it functions - particularly on the state and local level, 
where policies have a stark impact on how people interact with the justice system."
