COUNTERINTELLIGENCE 
Continued Reporting: Director Patel Scraps FBI Unit Monitoring Surveillance Rules Compliance 
The Guardian (05/20, Tait) reported that Director Patel has scrapped the FBI's office of internal auditing, a unit set 
up to monitor compliance with surveillance rules under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). The office 
was established in 2020 by William Barr to uncover misuses of FISA's section 702, which allows for the electronic 
tracking of foreign nationals. The article noted that the closure of the office may renew calls for FISA to be 
scrapped when it comes up for renewal in 2026, amid concerns that it violates Americans' constitutional right to 
privacy. Additional reporting on the story was provided by the Daily Caller (05/20, VanBuskirk), The Independent 
(05/20, Kilander), and Raw Story (05/20, Gettys). 
Drone Videos Of U.S. Military Bases Were Posted On YouTube, FBI Says 
Forbes (05/20, Brewster) reported that the FBI found YouTube videos posted by a user named Billy Cruz, showing 
aerial footage of restricted U.S. military bases, including Camp Blaz and Andersen Air Force Base in Guam, taken 
with a drone. According to the article, Cruz has been indicted for violating national defense airspace and failing to 
register his drone, despite previously agreeing not to take footage over a Defense Department facility after a 
similar incident in 2021. The article noted that the incidents raise concerns about the lack of anti-drone measures 
at these strategically important bases, particularly in relation to national security and surveillance.

CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS 
Comey Claims He Had No 'Dark Intention' With '86 47' Seashell Post 
Fox News (05/20, Guidice) reported that former FBI Director James Comey told MSNBC Monday that he had no ill 
intent with his controversial "86 47" Instagram post and that he is not intimidated by President Donald Trump's 
administration. The article noted that Comey posted a photo of shells on Thursday that were configured to say "86 
47." The number "86" generally means to get rid of something or someone and "47" refers to Trump being the 
47th president. Some saw this as a threat, but Comey maintained he thought it was a clever political statement 
against Trump and didn't have any violent intentions. According to the article, MSNBC's Nicolle Wallace asked 
Comey, "Between posting the picture and getting a call from the Secret Service, did you have any sort of gut check 
of like, 'Well, they've audited me in an extraordinary way. I was under investigation for years after he fired me.... 
Did you have any regret about posting the picture?" "I regret the distraction and the controversy around it," Comey 
replied. "But again, it's hard to have regret about something that, even in hindsight, looks to me to be totally 
innocent." The article mentioned that the U.S. Secret Service has already interviewed Comey about the situation, 
and Director Patel said in an X post on Thursday, "We are aware of the recent social media post by former FBI 
Director James Comey, directed at President Trump. We are in communication with the Secret Service and Director 
Curran. Primary jurisdiction is with SS on these matters and we, the FBI, will provide all necessary support." The 
Daily Signal (05/20, Crozier), New York Post (05/20, Nava), NBC News (05/20, Rohde), MSNBC (05/20, Wiley), CNN 
(05/20, Video), AA (05/20, Oguc, Celik), and the Epoch Times (05/20, Phillips) also reported on the story. 
FBI Agent Facing Gun Charges In Death Of Good Samaritan 
WTTG (Fox-5) (05/20, Salamy) reported that an FBI agent is facing gun charges, two of which are in connection to 
the fatal shooting of a good samaritan in February. The article noted that Benjamin Spinale has been charged with 
four Counts of Brandishing a Firearm. Only two of those charges are connected to the death on February 28 of a 
61-year-old man who was shot and killed while trying to help deputies involved in an altercation. The other two 
charges stem from incidents that occurred on October 11, 2024 and February 10, 2025. The article stated that 
according to the Stafford County Sheriff's Office, deputies responded to a reckless driver on an off-road motorcycle 
on February 28. Spinale, who was off-duty at the time, confronted the motorcyclist and the motorcyclist fled the
