IN THE NEWS 
Epstein 'Client List' Doesn't Exist, Justice Department Says, Walking Back Theory AG Bondi Had Promoted 
The Associated Press (07/07, Tucker, Richer) reported that the DOJ has stated that Jeffrey Epstein did not maintain 
a "client list" of individuals to whom underage girls were trafficked. Attorney General Pam Bondi had previously 
suggested that such a document existed and was being reviewed, but the department has now walked back this 
claim. After the first release of Epstein documents in February, AG Bondi stated that officials were poring over a 
"truckload" of previously withheld evidence she said had been handed over by the FBI. In a March TV interview, 
she claimed the Biden administration "sat on these documents, no one did anything with them," adding: "Sadly 
these people don't believe in transparency, but I think more unfortunately, I think a lot of them don't believe in 
honesty." The article noted that the DOJ will not release any further files related to Epstein's sex trafficking 
investigation, citing the need to protect victims and prevent the spread of unfounded theories. The article 
highlighted that Director Patel and Deputy Director Bongino recently insisted in television and podcast interviews 
that the evidence was clear that Epstein had killed himself. The Washington Post (07/07, Stein) noted that the 
White House on Monday defended AG Bondi's handling of the Epstein investigation. The White House and the 
Justice Department said AG Bondi was not referring to a client list in the Fox News interview but rather to the 
entire investigatory file, which could include private jet flight logs and people associated with Epstein. "Yes, she was 
saying the entirety of all of the paperwork, all of the paper in relation to Jeffrey Epstein's crimes. That's what the 
attorney general was referring to. And I'll let her speak for that," White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said 
Monday. The Justice Department "committed to an exhaustive investigation," she added. "That's what they did, 
and they provided the results of that. That's transparency." Fox News (07/07, Oliver) detailed that when asked for 
comment, a DOJ spokesperson pointed to Leavitt's remarks and said the Trump administration has been more 
transparent than its predecessor. "We've delivered more transparency in 6 months than the Biden administration 
did in 4 years," the spokesperson told Fox News Digital. The Wall Street Journal (07/07, Gurman) added that DOJ 
spokesman Chad Gilmartin said Monday that AG Bondi was referring to the Epstein files more broadly during the 
Fox interview, namely the flight manifests and address book that were included in the first release. The FBI referred 
other questions to the Justice Department, which referred them to the White House. The New York Post (07/07, 
King) pointed out that tech billionaire Elon Musk launched into a meme-based social media tirade early Monday 
over the Justice Department's reported conclusion that notorious sex predator Jeffrey Epstein's much-hyped client 
list doesn't actually exist. Through a flurry of memes and terse replies to various users, Musk, S4, insinuated that 
the federal government was protecting the late pedophile's associates and threw shade at AG Bondi. "This is the 
final straw," the world's richest man ominously replied to a post from user "Autism Capital" who alluded to AG 
Bondi's claims in February that she had the client list "sitting on my desk right now to review." Additional reporting

Man With An Assault Rifle Killed After Shooting At A Border Patrol Facility in Texas 
The Associated Press (07/07, Gonzalez, Cline) reported that a man with an assault rifle fired dozens of rounds at 
federal agents and a U.S. Border Patrol facility in Texas on Monday, injuring a police officer, before authorities shot 
and killed him. Authorities identified the shooter as Ryan Louis Mosqueda, believed to be 27, who they said shot at 
agents exiting the building, which is near the U.S.-Mexico border. McAllen Police Chief Victor Rodriguez said 
Mosqueda had a "utility vest" in addition to the rifle when federal agents returned fire. Hours before the attack in 
McAllen, Mosqueda's father was stopped by Weslaco police around 2:30 a.m. for a traffic violation, according to 
police spokesperson Heriberto Caraveo. The father told police that he was looking for his son, who he said had 
psychological issues and was carrying weapons in his car, Caraveo told the outlet. Police say the white two-door 
sedan that Mosqueda drove to the facility had letters painted — possibly in Latin — on the driver's side door. 
"What it means, or whether or not it is an underlying reason for him being here, I do not know," Rodriguez said 
when asked about the graffiti. After Mosqueda was killed, law enforcement found other weaponry, ammunition 
and backpacks inside the vehicle. Rodriguez said his department received a call about the shooting around S:S0 
a.m. One officer who responded to the shooting, a 10-year veteran, was injured after being struck in the knee.
