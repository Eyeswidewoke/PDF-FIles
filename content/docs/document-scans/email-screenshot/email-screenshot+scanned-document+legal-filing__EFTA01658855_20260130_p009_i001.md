How is North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's health? Is a fringe terror group showing signs of 
developing larger ambitions?" 
The AP (11/30, Riechmann, Miller) reports that previously, Biden "was given some 
intelligence background briefings as a candidate. But they were more general and did not 
include the nation's top secrets." 
Analysis: Biden Presidency Could Have Implications For Data Privacy Litigation. 
Law360 (11/30, de la Torre, Brown, Bryan, Subscription Publication, 8K) reports, "Assuming 
that President-elect Joe Biden is sworn in as president on Jan. 20, the area of data privacy will 
likely be of particular focus under the Biden administration, with consequences for data privacy 
litigation." The analysis addresses some "top-of-mind questions regarding the anticipated 
impact a Biden presidency may have in this area." For instance, "a Biden administration will 
likely focus on the passage of federal data privacy legislation, renegotiate conditions for EU data 
transfers to the U.S., reintroduce a cybersecurity coordinator to the White House and increase 
Federal Trade Commission enforcement activity." Additionally, the "legal issues involved include 
U.S. surveillance under Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act" and other 
directives. The next administration "opens the door to potential reconsideration of, or 
modifications to," some of these, "which could pave the way for agreement on a new 
transatlantic framework for the transfer of EU personal data to the U.S." 
Report: UAE Apparently Funding Russian Mercenary Group In Libya. 
Foreign Policy (11/30, Mackinnon, Detsch, 340K) reports that the UAE "is apparently helping to 
finance the Russian mercenary group Wagner in Libya," according to a Pentagon IG report last 
week. The report's findings, which discussed "counterterrorism operations in Africa," are "likely 
to complicate the United States' close relationship with the Gulf state." This marks the "first 
public, official assessment of the arrangement" in which "the UAE may be using Russian private 
military contractors to help obfuscate its role in the conflict," as suspected by experts. The 
revelation that "Russian mercenaries may have been bankrolled by one of America's closest 
military allies in the Middle East further complicates the calculus for Washington, and comes as 
Democrats in Congress have been mounting a campaign to oppose the Trump administration's 
proposed $23 billion sale of F-35 fighter jets to Abu Dhabi." 
Report: Czech President Calls For List Of Russian Spies, Triggering Security Concerns. 
Radio Free Europe (11/30, 9K) reports, "Czech President Milos Zeman has reportedly demanded 
a list of all Russian spies active in the Czech Republic, which security experts say could 
endanger secret sources of the Czech counterintelligence service." The president "made the 
request to Michal Koudelka, director of the Security Intelligence Service (BIS)." A Cesky Rozhlas 
report "said Zeman also called on the BIS to provide him with documentation about all known 
Russian intelligence operations in the Czech Republic." Lawmakers in the country "said on 
November 30 that committees from both chambers of parliament would discuss the matter." 
Senate Security Committee Chairman Pavel Fischer "said Zeman's requests could threaten the 
security of the state." 
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS 
Whitmer Kidnap Plotters Reportedly Exchanged Encrypted Messages. 
WDIV-TV Detroit (11/30, Ley, Hutchinson, 460K) reports, "The Local 4 Defenders have obtained 
secret encrypted messages that were exchanged between some of the men involved in the 
alleged domestic terror plot targeting Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. Those messages played 
a key role in the government's case against the 14 men allegedly involved in the plot." 
According to WDIV-TV, "Three of the men were from Metro Detroit, and federal officials said the
