you've agreed that 
Your office is a multi billion dollar responsibility. your children will inheri= it, in order to oversee their financial lives- I 
feel for yo=, truly ,but the facts are the facts, your ceo ( Brad) has provi=ed one bad document after another for over 
a year, no getting away from it„ =C2 bad cash flows no new IT, each time with " its gettting better " no in fact -! its 
=ot. - the excuse, that Brad is not the numbers guy, is ludicrous. of course he=20 didnt actually prepare the 
statements. - no ceo would ,-=but over and over he presented them to you and me , after , holding them back =or his 
personal review multiple times and after multiple drafts. weeks of his editing,=C2 the consistant but "inexplicable 
"missing the obvious serious errors . ( gaming ) inaccuracies, = cashflow ) and mistakes (tax returns). why, ?! the 
simple answer i= that at best, he is a c minus, (note. I, like you ,also give points for effort. )- ! a= elegant art 
partnership gone fallow. ??Ill and its core reason =o exist. not used ? no docs for plane?, still ! why?=no docs for 
decantings why? the docs for deal 1 received last night, 
no docs at all for deal 2, the biggest " . why wasn't Tom 
brought in , =C2 after 4 times of my incessant reminders your admonition etc. the trading accounts ? =AO 
Barry Cohen is great. more like him please .= 
you asked , - I did my best trying to train your brad chosen people in the face of my telling you that they were never 
going to be more than c-minuses, thousands of emails thousands=? 
Brad at its head . you can't as a ceo,=have an 
accountant give you multiple pages with the most important numbers missing altogether=and not notice, you and I 
saw the errrors right away ,as did my very junior=20 bookeeper after only a cursory glance. He told me he didnt know 
the d=tails of his note? ! , my guess is that he wanted to pay less. no mo=e than that, any other story is blather. its 
silly. =AO Talk to richard yourself. 
re your estate. Y=s another Brad issue - your will, needs revision. the tenants in common structure I as=ume Alan has 
carefully walked you through. it is way overdue, needed and exciting. I won't list the more serious issues in an e=ail 
but we can speak over the weekend. 
How can I help?= We agreed at the time when you hired Castrucci , that when you fired him= I would bear no 
responsibility because it was clear that he shouldnt be hired. brad and you both said ," its on us", but... =C2 the 
equivalent of your art consultant pointing to a picasso =AO and calling it a renoir. then a brancusi and calling =t a 
michaelangelo. those were the types of erros that i saw im=ediatily, you said give them more time. at l=ast they saw 
it was a painting and not a photo? 
b=ing weaned of our biz /pay realtionship has been our mutual goal.=C2 However since novemebr, you chose to do so 
by ignoring L=; our agreement re, phaidon,and your oft stated commitment to me of larg= payments for large value,
37 percent was our number ). chose to pay me=C2 a number picked by what appears to be only by whim,- have =et 
to justify it except for telling me that you and Brad Karp t=lked.. . 
What should we do? the next two years in=biz world appears to both you and I , very fragile. =AO Im happy to have 
brad sit in ?
