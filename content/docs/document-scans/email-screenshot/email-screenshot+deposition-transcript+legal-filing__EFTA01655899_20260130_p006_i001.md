Sikh Activists in U.S., Canada Face Threats a Year After Trudeau Linked Leader's Killing to India 
Reuters (08/12, Lynch, Lone, Garcia) reported that Dr. Jasmeet Bains, a Sikh American elected to the California 
Assembly, has faced significant threats and harassment since advocating for recognition of the 1984 Sikh genocide 
in India. According to the article, after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau implicated the Indian government in 
the killing of a Sikh separatist leader, Bains received heightened security assessments and contact from the FBI 
regarding threats at her office. The article noted that the FBI has been actively involved in warning Sikh community 
members about potential dangers, emphasizing the risk of "transnational repression" and advising vigilance against 
threats originating from foreign states. Additionally, the FBI has facilitated meetings for Sikh advocacy groups to 
discuss security concerns amid ongoing investigations into assassinations and assassination attempts of Sikh 
leaders in North America, attributed to possible Indian government involvement or its supporters. 
U.S. Government Sued Over Alleged Discrimination Against Palestinian Americans

the FBI and other U.S. government agencies, alleging discriminatory practices that resulted in the placement of two 
Palestinian Americans on a watch list. According to the article, the lawsuit challenges the placement of Mustafa 
Zeidan on the no-fly list and the seizure of Osama Abu Irshaid's electronic device by federal agents, who questioned 
him about his activism related to Israel's actions in Gaza. The article noted that the FBI's Terrorist Screening Center, 
responsible for administering the no-fly list, stated that individuals are not listed based on race, religion, or free 
speech activities, although the plaintiffs argue their rights were violated under these very grounds.

Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid claimed they are holding only two American citizens and denied holding 
Habibi, amidst discussions of a possible prisoner exchange involving U.S. prisoners held by the Taliban. "It has been 
two years since Mr. Habibi's disappearance, and the FBI continues to work diligently to return him to his family," 
David Sundberg, assistant director in charge of the FBI Washington Field Office, said in a news release. "The FBI has 
a commitment to our citizens, victims and their families to seek answers on their behalf. We are once again asking 
for the public's help and encourage anyone who has information to contact the FBI."

Famed Spy Catcher Warns of Foreign Penetration of U.S. Government Happening Now 
Washington Times (08/12, Lovelace) reported that Eric O'Neill, a former FBI investigator renowned for his role in 
capturing Robert Hanssen, a notorious Russian spy, warned of ongoing foreign espionage activities within the U.S. 
government. According to the article, O'Neill, speaking at the Black Hat USA conference, expressed concerns about 
current threats from insiders akin to Hanssen, stating, "There probably is somebody else right now somewhere in a 
government agency giving up secrets." The article noted that despite advancements in security protocols since the 
Hanssen case, O'Neill remains cautious, emphasizing that espionage has evolved with technology, making it easier 
for foreign entities to exploit digital vulnerabilities rather than relying solely on human spies.
