The Washington Times (9/2, Dinan, Boyer, 492K) says Trump directed Attorney General 
Barr "to come up with a list of communities that have forbidden police to step in to stop 
violence, have declared no-go zones for officers, or pursued 'Defund Police' policies. Mr. Barr is 
also to look at communities that have rebuffed Mr. Trump's offers of federal law enforcement." 
The Washington Post (9/2, Stein, 14.2M) says the memo "comes as the president seeks to 
intensify his attacks on Democratic mayors of cities that have faced civil unrest amid protests 
against police brutality." 
In a tweet Wednesday evening, Trump wrote, "My Administration will do everything in its 
power to prevent weak mayors and lawless cities from taking Federal dollars while they let 
anarchists harm people, burn buildings, and ruin lives and businesses. We're putting them on 
notice today. @RussVought45" 
The New York Times (9/2, Haberman, McKinley, 18.61M) reports that the move "is almost 
certain to face legal challenges, and Democrats and city officials reacted furiously." Politico (9/2, 
Choi, 4.29M) says Senate Minority Leader Schumer "quickly denounced the Wednesday memo 
as a 'foolish stunt,' urging the president to focus on the coronavirus pandemic instead of 
threatening federal funding for some of the country's largest cities." 
Cuomo: Trump Would Need An Army To Walk NYC Streets. Politico New York (9/2, 
Mahoney) reports that in response to Trump's threat "to withdraw federal funds from 'anarchist' 
municipalities" like New York City, Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) launched his "harshest attack yet on 
his fellow Queens native, saying he is 'persona non grata' in the city of his birth." Cuomo said, 
"He can't have enough bodyguards to walk through New York City. ... Forget bodyguards, he 
better have an army if he thinks he's going to walk down the streets in New York. ... He is 
persona non grata in New York City, and I think he knows that, and he'll never come back to 
New York, because New Yorkers will never forget how gratuitously mean he has been." A 
spokesperson for Cuomo "later clarified that Cuomo did not mean that the president would 
literally need such additional protection, but was simply illustrating how unwelcome he would 
be in the city." 
Shootings In NYC More Than Doubled In August. The New York Times (9/2, Zaveri, 
18.61M) reports that New York City "recorded 242 shootings in August, up from 91 last year, 
continuing a summer spike in gun violence that has become an issue in the presidential race." 
The "steep rise in gun violence...continued at an alarming rate in August, as shootings more 
than doubled over the same period last year and murders rose by nearly 50 percent, the police 
said." The Times says Trump "has seized" on the increase as he has "tried to shift the public's 
attention away from his response to the pandemic to what he depicts is out-of-control crime in 
New York City and other urban areas. He has tried to blame the rise in violence on local 
Democratic leaders." 
PROTESTS 
Barr: DO] Received Reports Of People Flying To DC To Exploit Protests. 
The New York Times (9/2, Benner, 18.61M) reports that in an interview with CNNVi Wednesday, 
Attorney General Barr "sidestepped questions...about President Trump's incendiary conspiracy 
theory about a plane 'loaded with thugs' headed to Washington over the weekend." Barr said 
that he did not know "what the president was specifically referring to," but that the F.B.I. was 
investigating reports that outsiders had traveled to the city to cause trouble. Barr "said the 
Justice Department had received reports that people from the West Coast and other parts of 
the country had flown to Washington to exploit protests for racial justice as opportunities to 
attack law enforcement and damage property." Barr said, "We received numerous reports of 
individuals coming from Portland, Washington - Seattle - and several other cities to come into 
Washington for the specific purpose of causing a riot. ... I think there were many on planes."
