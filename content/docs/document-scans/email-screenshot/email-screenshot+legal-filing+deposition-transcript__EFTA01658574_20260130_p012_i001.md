investment fund and, separately, to return outspoken Chinese exile Guo Wengui to his home 
country." According to the Post, the charges "are the latest blow to the RNC's fundraising 
leadership under Trump." 
Bloomberg (10/8, Melby, Voreacos, 4.73M) describes Broidy as "a former top political 
fundraiser" for President Trump, and says he is accused of having "participated in a scheme to 
illegally lobby the Trump administration to stop investigating the embezzlement scandal at the 
1MDB Malaysian state investment fund." Bloomberg reports that Jho Low, "a Malaysian fugitive 
and the accused mastermind of the 1MDB fraud, initially paid Broidy $6 million to lobby the 
Justice Department to stop its investigation and promised an additional $75 million if the 
lobbying succeeded." Broidy has been "charged with conspiring to lobby for a foreign national 
without registering." The Wall Street Journal (10/8, Viswanatha, Subscription Publication, 
7.57M) says cases emerging from the investiation into the 1MDB fraud exposed an extensive 
effort by Low to attempt scaling back the US investigation by hiring top GOP consultants and 
lawyers with ties to the President. 
The Daily Beast (10/8, 1.39M) reports prosecutors "say Broidy conspired in the scheme 
with a Hawaii businesswoman named Nickie Lum Davis, who pleaded guilty in August to one 
count of conspiracy to violate FARA, and an unnamed co-conspirator who, based on previous 
reporting, is believed to be Pras Michel, best known as a founding member of the Fugees." The 
government "is also seeking to seize any assets derived from the lobbying campaign." 
NCSC Director Warns Of COVID-19 Disinformation Before Election. 
Hearst Television (10/8, Albert) reports National Counterintelligence and Security Center 
Director Bill Evanina "warned in a rare interview that 'more aggressive activity' to spread 
coronavirus disinformation is expected before the Nov. 3 election - and beyond - and 
acknowledged the government needs to do a 'much better job' to protect Americans from being 
fooled." Evanina "told the Hearst Television National Investigative Unit in a more than hour-long 
interview this week he 'absolutely' expects more foreign influence operations targeting 
American audiences with false information about COVID-19, the pandemic and President 
Donald Trump's infection with the virus." 
Evanina: Foreign Adversaries Exploiting Trump's False Claims To Influence 
Election. CNN (10/8, Marquardt, 83.16M) reports Evanina told Hearst Television "that foreign 
adversaries are exploiting lies by President Donald Trump in their campaigns to influence the 
2020 election." Evanina "agreed...that foreign powers are using the numerous exaggerated and 
false claims Trump has made about mail-in voting, voting multiple times and 2020 being the 
most fraudulent election in history." CNN quotes Evanina saying, "If they see a reference made 
by the President of the United States, a prominent US Senator, a business person, someone 
who America looks at as a voice of reason, and they believe it suits their interests, they will 
amplify that by a thousand to make sure that the most amount of people see it." 
Ratcliffe Accused Of Politicizing Intelligence. 
The Washington Post (10/8, Harris, 14.2M) reports Director of National Intelligence Ratcliffe, 
"failed to meet his commitments when he recently declassified documents that included 
sensitive intelligence about Russians discussing Hillary Clinton and her 2016 presidential 
campaign, current and former officials said." The disclosures, "which he told lawmakers came 
'at the direction of the president of the United States,' amount to a disinformation operation run 
by the nation's top intelligence official, in service of a president who has long accused the 
intelligence agencies of conspiring against him, the current and former intelligence officials 
said." Former CIA Officer Marc Polymeropoulos said Ratcliffe "is cherry-picking intelligence, and 
seriously risks exposing sources and methods for absolutely no reason other than to promote 
and protect the president before the election." Ratcliffe's defenders "said he has been careful to 
balance the president's direction to declassify more information with the need to protect
