David Muir reported on ABC World News TonightVi (10/21, story 4, 3:05, 6.08M) that the CDC 
"is out with new guidance on close contact with an infected person." ABC's Whit Johnson added, 
"A new CDC study find[s] that even multiple brief exposures within six feet in a 24-hour period 
may increase the risk of COVID-19 transmission. Until now, health officials had said you can 
contract the virus if you spend at least 15 minutes within close proximity of an infected person. 
Today, in a rare briefing in Atlanta, CDC doctors urg[ed] Americans not to let their guard down." 
On NBC Nightly NewsVi (10/21, story 3, 1:55, Holt, 5.81M), Miguel Almaguer said, "The 
new guidelines come as new outbreaks or superspreader events are tied to close gatherings. In 
Minnesota, at least 20 Salvation Army employees contracted the virus during a conference. At 
church events in North Carolina and in Maine, nearly 100 tested positive after few took 
precautions. Some Americans are still spreading the virus because they don't know they're 
infected." The AP (10/21, Stobbe) reports, "The definition change was triggered by a study of a 
20-year-old Vermont correctional officer, who was diagnosed with a coronavirus infection in 
August. The guard, who wore a mask and goggles, had multiple brief encounters with six 
transferred prisoners before test results showed they were positive. At times, the prisoners 
wore masks, but there were encounters in cell doorways or in a recreational room where 
prisoners did not have them on, the report said." The CBS Evening NewsVi (10/21, story 5, 
0:20, O'Donnell, 4.55M), the Washington Post (10/21, Sun, 14.2M), and the Wall Street Journal 
(10/21, Abbott, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) also have reports. 
Human Vaccine Results Expected Soon From Pfizer And Moderna. 
The Washington Post (10/21, Johnson, 14.2M) reports that "in a matter of weeks, one of the 
most closely watched human experiments in history will start to report early results, with data 
on prospective coronavirus vaccines possibly coming this month or in November from the 
pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and the biotechnology company Modema." According to the Post, 
"Amid the turmoil, chaos and misinformation that have defined the U.S. response to the 
pandemic, progress toward a vaccine, or vaccines, has been steady, reassuring and scientific." 
The Post adds that "political meddling has so far been largely deflected," and "drug companies, 
working closely with the U.S. government and fueled by an infusion of more than $10 billion of 
taxpayer money, have developed, tested and scaled up a half-dozen potential vaccines at 
unprecedented speed." 
Asked on WDAK-AM (10/21) about the politicization of coronavirus vaccines, HHS 
Secretary Azar said, "There are many out there who, for whatever reason, are jumping in with 
the anti-vaccine crowd, and are really impairing public health. ... Frankly, it's disgusting to see, 
because these are decisions that are going to be made, there are at least five totally 
independent checks on the vaccine approval process." WSB-TVVI Atlanta (10/21, 149K) 
reported Azar "visited Grady Memorial Hospital and the CDC" on Wednesday and "told [WSB-
TV] he believes a limited supply of one or more vaccines could be available to part of the 
population as soon as the end of December," which "he says is crucial given the expected surge 
of cases during the colder months." 
The Wall Street Journal (10/21, Al, Woo, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) reports on the 
controversy surrounding the University of Oxford's vaccine program, while the AP (10/21, 
Neergaard) reports that "the global hunt for a COVID-19 vaccine for kids is only just beginning 
- a lagging start that has some U.S. pediatricians worried they may not know if any shots work 
for young children in time for the next school year." 
COVID Cases Spike Across US. 
Norah O'Donnell said on the CBS Evening NewsVi (10/21, story 6, 2:40, 4.55M) that "almost 
every state in the US is seeing a surge in new COVID cases." Reuters (10/21, Caspani, Meijer) 
reports COVID deaths "hit fresh daily records in Hawaii, Kansas, Iowa, Minnesota, Montana and 
Wisconsin, a state that also reported a record daily increase in new cases together with
