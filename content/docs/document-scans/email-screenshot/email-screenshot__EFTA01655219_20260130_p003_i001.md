Special Agent in Charge Terence G. Reilly of the FBI Newark Field Office, who said, "Human nature is generally good. There are situations though that 
prove some people display more cruel and inhumane behavior. Bolarinwa lured women with false promises, held them captive, and forced them clean 
her home and care for her children. Then took it a sickening step further by physically abusing them. Luckily, one of the victims had the courage to tell

hiding in plain sight! 
Alexander Brothers Face New Charges, Including Sex Trafficking of a Minor 
ABC News (05/11, Katersky) reported that a high-profile case against prominent real estate moguls took a new turn last week as federal prosecutors filed 
new charges against Oren and Tal Alexander, as well as their brother Alon, on May 8. Filed as part of a superseding indictment, which overrides the first 
indictment, the charges against the Alexander brothers include additional counts of alleged sex trafficking -- one of which involves a minor. According to 
the article, brothers Oren and Tal Alexander gained notoriety in New York's luxury real estate market through their company, Alexander Group, and have 
been under federal investigation alongside Oren's twin, Alon, since late 2024. They have been accused of luring women to nightclubs and parties, then 
drugging and sexually assaulting them. All three previously pleaded not guilty to the first set of sex trafficking charges. In addition to new charges, the 
superseding indictment included more alleged victims. Six alleged victims now form the basis for the criminal charges. CBS News (05/09, Staff Writer) 
also reported on the story.
