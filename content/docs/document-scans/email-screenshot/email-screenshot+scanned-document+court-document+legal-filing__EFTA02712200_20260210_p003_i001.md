I have a VERY thick skin, and love to=hear criticism. One of the best ways to learn. And I'v= often given 
up closely held beliefs on the basis of persuasive argumentation. =AO But in this case, I just don't see the arguments.=u> 
It's true that the mathematic= lacks rigor, but that's for the same reason that publications in 
=rofessional math journals lack rigor. The steps that are not spelled out are str=ightforward enough so that they can be 
easily filled in. I don =99t know of any problems about set theory, apart from the classic ones. =AO Some version of set 
theory is presupposed in every branch of math, including category theory. As for the brain as a com=uter, I'm not sure 
what you see as the problem. The papers l=sent you do assume that I-language is a computational system, with the 
pro=erties mentioned, easily formalized. I don't know of any coherent alternative. Actually, very good professional 
mathem=ticians and physicists, one working primarily on quantum computers, have a=tended my regular seminars for 
years, but I've never heard a sugge=tion as to how mathematical ideas used in quantum theory would be relevant to 
systems of the kind we're considering.=C2 The "displacement conjecture" is, in fact, an immedi=te consequence of what 
would be the best possible theory if it's t=ue: SMT, in particular, the assumption that the basic combinatorial operation 
is the simplest one possible. Merge is simply set-formatio=, presupposed in all of mathematics. I agree that it's na 
=AFve, if by that you mean very simple, arguably optimally so. But ha=n't that been the pretty explicit goal of science, at 
least since Galileo, quantum theory included? I'd like to hear the=objections, and hope to learn from them.

Subject: 
I will take your word that you share my thick skin f=r criticism and share a strange pleasure in learning, 
even if it mea=s having to accept that some formerly closely held beliefs might need strong correction. I have no 
particular knowl=dge re politics or history, so I will never offer an opinion. =owever re mathematics and or money , I 
feel on strong ground. =hat being said, thought puzzles in the paper are brilliant and=insightful. the mathematical 
descriptions lack rigor , and the metaphors suffer =rom the common science limitation of trying to describe things using 
the e=gineering metaphors or the tools of the moment.ex. The =uman or its brain as a computer ., set theory . It was 
popular in the early 20th as you know to describe the body as an elect=ic machine.. the mathematics used today in 
quantum show =ore promise , as it attempts to describe things that appear counter intuit=ve. or difficult to comprehend 
, ( your displacement conjecture) 
your simple X and Y, Merge, is quit= naive and unfortunately incorrect. 
2. from the paper you sent. ; a much more elegant way of conveying =AO what i had failed to do re 
sentences and money 
European structuralism commonly adopted the Saussurean conception of langua=e ( MONEY) (in the 
relevant sense) =s a social entity; as Saussure put it, a storehouse of word images ( values ) in the brains of a collectivity 
o= individuals founded on a "sort of contract."
