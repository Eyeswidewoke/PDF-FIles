The New York Times (7/26, Fink, 18.61M) reports that Elaine Roberts, a bagger at a 
supermarket in Houston, took steps to protect herself from the coronavirus, including wearing 
masks and gloves, but many of the customers at the store where she works did not wear 
masks. Roberts, "who has autism and lives with her parents, got sick first, sneezing and 
coughing. Then her father, Paul, and mother, Sheryl, who had been so cautious after the 
pandemic struck that their rare ventures out were mostly for bird-watching in a nearly empty 
park, were hospitalized with breathing problems." The Times says that what happened to the 
Roberts family "is in many ways the story of Texas. ... For weeks, politicians were divided over 
keeping the economy open, citizens were polarized about wearing masks, doctors were warning 
that careless behavior could imperil others, and families were put at risk by their young." 
WTimes Analysis: Administration Believes DACA Ruling Confirms Executive Action 
Authority. 
The Washington Times (7/26, Boyer, 492K) reports President Trump "is turning increasingly to 
executive action to push through his election-year agenda, buoyed by" the June Supreme Court 
ruling on President Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which the 
Administration "believes has expanded the president's power of the pen." Trump "signed five 
executive actions last week alone. Four orders Friday were aimed at lowering prescription drug 
prices," while one eliminated undocumented immigrants from the census count for 
reapportionment.

WPost Analysis: US Global Standing "At A Low Ebb," Made Worse By Pandemic. 
The Washington Post (7/26, Balz, 14.2M) reports in an analysis that the United States' 
"standing in the world is at a low ebb." The nation "is now seen as withdrawn and inward-
looking, a reluctant and unreliable partner at a dangerous moment for the world. The 
coronavirus pandemic has only made things worse." In place of the "principle of robust 
American leadership in the world through alliances and multilateral institutions," President 
Trump "has substituted his America First doctrine and what his critics say is a zero-sum-game 
sensibility about international relationships." The world "sees the United States not as a leader 
in dealing with the coronavirus but as the country with the highest number of coronavirus 
infections and covid-19 deaths, and with the disease far from under control." 
North Korea Locks Down Border Town As First Suspected COVID Cases Emerges. 
Reuters (7/26, Cha, Smith) reports North Korean state media said Sunday that Kim Jong-un 
has "declared an emergency and a lockdown in a border town after a person suspected of being 
infected with the novel coronavirus returned from South Korea after illegally crossing the 
border." The case, if confirmed, would be the first officially acknowledged by North Korean 
officials. North Korea's KCNA state news reported that a person who defected to South Korea 
three years ago, returned to the town Kaesong this month with symptoms of COVID-19. 
The Washington Post (7/26, Kim, 14.2M) says test results "were described as 'uncertain' 
but the person was still put under quarantine while health officials launched an investigation 
into those who might have come in contact with the individual in Kaesong, the state media 
reported." The Post adds that an outbreak "would pose a significant threat to North Korea's 
limited health system, which lacks basic protective equipment and medical supplies."
