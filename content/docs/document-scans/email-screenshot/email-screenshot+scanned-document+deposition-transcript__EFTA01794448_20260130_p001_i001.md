RE: 
hi jeffrey, 
sorry for bothering with e-mails.. 
&nb=p; so we finished venetian plaster in master bedroom and the vestibule o=ly. now the vestibule needs the design in 
top, but you are not sure yet =bout the sample. anyway i will finish that sample monday in the morning th=n you can 
decide and i can start the design in the vestibule. 
=eside this i have to do cabana no3 (close to the pool) with those vertical=lines.. and the bathroom with diamonds 
(brown bags color), and then ther= are two small rooms in the master bedroom in the between vestibule and th= master 
bathroom, they need white venetian plaster. 
now, f=r the cabana no3, and the vestibule, i dont need help..if i keep my fr=end here i dont know what to give him to 
do.. otherwise i would have asked=you for the begening that i need help. when i have to comp=se things like lets say 
those small blue cross lines like the sample i do =or the vestibule in master bedroom, or even the verticals lines i have t= 
do in cabana no3, or even the dimonds in its bathroom, i like to work=alone..otherwise i get distracted..i cannot 
concentrate 
=3B the only thing my friend can do is the venetian plaster in those small =ooms in the master bedroom, and that 
would take one week for one person =o do them or 2-3 days if two persons work, but we cannot do the venetian=plaster 
in there because they are not ready for us. when i left before chr=stmas garry told me they going to be ready at the 
begining of january, t=ats why i sgheduled my friend for one or two weeks of work. 
bu= then when we got here at the begening of this week and i i saw that those=two small rooms are not ready, i've i 
asked garry when are they finish t=e floor and instaling the counter top and the sink, and he said is goin= to take one 
week to finish the floor and sanding and then they ordered th= counter top and they will get it after after a week or 
two..so he said th=y will be done in two weeks. 
if i do venetian plaster before =hey finish instaling the counter top, basebords etc, and sending the floor, then they will 
damage the walls. when you sand the floor it makes a brown-redish dust and gets stuck on the walls and you cannot 
remove that..you have to redo all the walls. 
anyway, after this talking to garry, i=had to tell my friend that there is only one week of work, so he will go=back 
saturday or sunday. after that he sheduled a job in new york =or the next week, so now he has to be in new york 
monday morning. he wor=s usually at the guggenheim museum as a freelancer, its his main job. 
thank you,
