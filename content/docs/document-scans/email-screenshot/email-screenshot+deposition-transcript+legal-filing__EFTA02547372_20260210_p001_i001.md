Items/Issues I am working on 
Jeff, 
Here is what I am working on: 
1. I have started outlining SOPs for the island. I am breaking it down =o engineering, land fleet, marine fleet, and 
Housekeeping. As I have =aid, this will take time to write as it is being done from scratch as =othing is in place. 
2. I am in the process of reviewing a Fleet Maintenance piece of =oftware. This was being used and then stopped. You 
have enough =quipment (both marine and land based) to warrant a piece of software =hat can track them. This will pay 
for itself as it will extend the =seful life of the equipment. It will also give the staff a maintenance =chedule and put the 
responsibility on them to follow the schedule and =ake sure equipment is ready to use when needed. 
3. I am going over the all the contracts that are in place to see if we =re getting what you pay for. 
4. I have tasked Jermaine to complete a full IT asset listing as nobody =flows what we have on island. When Jermaine is 
on island and working in = particular area he will make note of everything IT/electronic in =ature from computers to 
servers to switches. I hope he can have this =one in about a month based on his needs at FTC. 
5. I am reviewing, along with Rich, invoices from the island. Rich and I =eed to discuss a process to reduce the load on 
Rich on the approval =rocess. 
6. Pools- got a message from Bart that you called and wanted to see what =e said. I get the feeling you don't want want 
to pay him on the =emainder of his contract and also get the re-plastering done 7. I will re-send the interior design 
questions that we need answered on =ive Palms 8. The Necker Island contact finally got back to me and we have a call 
=cheduled for tomorrow. I will give you an update of what he wants after =he call. 
9. Hanger- I have helped Larry fill out paperwork to submit to the Port =uthority for the hanger door project. I have also 
spoke with Tom on the =unch list for the Hanger and he is going to look at what he can do but =ithout taking resources 
away from the island. Jermaine is getting the =hone and coax installation scheduled and will have a date for that by =he 
end of the week. 
10. I have comments for you on the RO plant, transformer, generator =epairs, and fire system that I will be forwarding 
tomorrow (11/29) 11. I continue to have to massage the relationship with 
=hey do not like to release 
control of anything and I will have to gain =heir trust to make them see my way. 
12. While on island, I will be evaluating the staff and review changes =hat need to take place. 
13. Based on today;s conversation, I need to start looking for a =ualified landscaping manager. 
14. Construction - I will continue to help direct Tom to what you want. = will do my best to follow the vision that you 
want. 
Most of these items will take time. I have been here two weeks and =ontinue to ask what I have accomplished and the 
answer is, honestly, =ot much. I have spent my time trying to get my hands around issues =hat have been going on for 
some time. I have been put in the middle of =hings that I have to go to people on the ground to get answers because = 
was not here for them. Everything so far that I have told you has been =hru those people on the ground. That is the 
source of information. I =ave asked Rich and you to a point as well. 
Give me some time to do the job you hired me to do. 
I think it is better that I work the rest of the week from here and then =ome to island next week. Please let know if that 
is ok with you.
