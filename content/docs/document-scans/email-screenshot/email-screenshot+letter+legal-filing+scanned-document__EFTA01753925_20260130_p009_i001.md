"With a decade of-experience now to draw from, this is the moment to ask ourselves hard ques=ions — about the 
nature of today's threats and how we should confront =hem," he said in May. "America is at a crossroads. We must 
define the nature and scope of this struggle, or else it will defi=e us." 
Obama also seemed t= be confessing to a degree of overreliance on tools like drones, when he d=clared: 'The very 
precision of drone strikes and the necessary secrecy o=ten involved in such actions.... can also lead a president and his 
team to view drone strikes as a cure-all for terr=rism." 
Some analysts see O=ama recalibrating in part out of concern that his foreign policy and natio=al security legacy was at 
risk of being defined in shorthand as "drones =nd surveillance." 
"In every adminis=ration, the first term is about the election and the second term is about =egacy," said former State 
Department spokesman P.J. Crowley. "At the m=dway point, the White House did look at what was promised in 2008, 
what we will be judged on in 2017 and what still rem=ins on the to-do list." The recent shifts may have been inspired by 
or a= least fueled by a reshuffle in senior national security positions that sa= Susan Rice replace Tom Donilon to National 
Security Adviser and installed Samantha Power as the U.S. Ambassa=or at the United Nations. 
'The playbook has='t changed, but when you change the coaching staff, you do change the fi=st instinct," Crowley said. 
"It's possible that over time we'll se= a different play selection." 
Rice and Power are =oth seen as more activist and willing to take action in humanitarian crise=, such as Libya and Syria. 
They may also be more inclined to incur the wra=h of authoritarian regimes like Egypt's military government in order to 
signal U.S. support for democracy and huma= rights. 
When the U.S. annou=ced Wednesday that Obama had decided suspending delivery of cash assistanc= and major 
weapons systems to Egypt's government, officials acknowledged=that more conciliatory efforts to coax military leaders 
into returning to democracy had failed. "I =on't think anyone would claim there's going to be any direct line betw=en 
decisions that we're announcing on assistance and immediate changes o= the ground in Egypt exactly in line with what 
we are urging the Egyptians to do," said a senior administration official w=o spoke on condition of anonymity. "But at 
the same time, the president =ade clear how important these things are to us and this decision just unde=scores that 
the United States will not support actions that run contrary to our interest and our principles. =nd it's important to be 
clear about those things." M=ny national security experts sense that a shift is underway on various fro=ts, but say it's 
hard to divine with certainty since the foreign policy and national security sphere involves responding to cri=es as they 
arise. 
"It's like clim=te change," said Ben Wittes of the Brookings Institution. "You have we=ther events and some sort of 
aggregate change, but to what extent should y=u attribute any weather event to climate change?" The pair of U.S. 
military operations in Libya and Somalia last weekend cau=ht the eye of many experts because the raids seemed 
squarely aimed at capt=ring terrorism suspects rather than killing them with drones, as the admin=stration sought to do 
on hundreds of occasions during Obama's first term.
