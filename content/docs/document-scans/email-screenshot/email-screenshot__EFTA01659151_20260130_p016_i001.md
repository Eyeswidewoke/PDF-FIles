Chinese Telecom Giants Scramble To Meet New Requirements Abroad. 
According to CNET News (12/7, Keane, 1.99M), "countries like the UK and Sweden have banned 
the use" of Huawei's "equipment as their 5G networks develop. The company's phones are also 
virtually invisible in the US, despite its massive presence around the world." CNET provides a 
timeline of regulatory news relating to Huawei "going back to 2018." Most recently, on 
December 7, Huawei was "reportedly willing to meet Sweden's requirements after its equipment 
was banned from the country's 5G network." 
Meanwhile, Sky News (UK) (12/7) reports, Finland is "expected to introduce a new law 
which could see Chinese telecommunications equipment excluded from the nation's networks." 
Finland's transportation and communications minister, Timo Harakka, has stated "the country 
would not directly be banning Huawei equipment with the law." Though not named, Huawei and 
ZTE "are expected to be covered by legislation that prohibits including any equipment within 
the core of a network if it 'would endanger national security or defence." 
Trump Signs Bill Requiring Minimum Cybersecurity Requirements For Feds. 
Reuters (12/7, Merken) reports that President Trump "has signed new legislation aimed at 
limiting the risks to government and incentivizing manufacturers to address (cyber) security 
gaps" through the Internet of Things Cybersecurity Improvement Act of 2020. The legislation 
"will require minimum security requirements for procurement and use of Internet of Things 
(IoT) devices by the federal government. Trump signed the bipartisan bill into law on Friday, the 
White House said." 
Companies Attempting To Lure In Hackers With "Honey Pots." 
The Wall Street Journal (12/7, Mitchell, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) reports that some 
companies are attempting to "lure cybercriminals into thinking they're getting close" to valuable 
information, and then "they trap them." Land 0'Lakes Chief uses DeceptionGrid, a tool that 
"deploys an array of decoys and booby traps throughout the Land 0' Lakes network that mimic 
crucial information." The company aims to "convince hackers that they have gotten access to 
the company's crown jewels." Another technology, from Illusive "plants dozens of fake but 
believable data points into every company-issued laptop or cellphone." 
Opinion: Public Schools Could Offer Practical Cybersecurity Aid. 
Heidi Boghosian, an attorney, writes in an op-ed in the Philadelphia Inquirer (12/7, Boghosian, 
347K) reports that the day before Thanksgiving, attackers "inserted malicious software" in 
Baltimore County School District's systems - or ransomware - "then threatened to block access 
or publish data unless the district paid a ransom." The attack "closed County schools 
(surrounding the city of Baltimore, which has its own school system) for two days on Nov. 30 
and Dec. 1." The Inquirer says school administrators "weren't equipped to guard against this 
threat." However, colleges "with advanced cybersecurity expertise" could "step up to help stop 
the epidemic of cyberattacks." Public school systems "could provide these university-level 
programs with a real-world clinic for practical learning." 
Report: Global Losses From Cybercrime Expected To Be Just Under $1T For 2020. 
The Washington Post (12/7, Riley, 14.2M) reports, "Estimated global losses from cybercrime are 
projected to hit just under a record $1 trillion for 2020," according to a study from CSIS and 
McAfee. The $945 billion in losses "is almost double the monetary loss from cybercrime than 
the $500 billion in 2018." The pandemic "provided new opportunities for hackers to target 
consumers and businesses," as it "inspired an unprecedented number of online scams preying 
on the fears of both consumers and businesses - and a mass migration of employees to remote
