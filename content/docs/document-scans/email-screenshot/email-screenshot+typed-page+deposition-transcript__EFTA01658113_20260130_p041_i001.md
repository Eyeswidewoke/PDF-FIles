roadside bombs and airstrikes kill "dozens of Afghans everyday," but "as the war has spread, 
the exact nature of the attacks and their toll, particularly on civilians, has increasingly grown 
opaque." 
Pompeo Urges Chinese People To Change Communist Party. 
The Wall Street Journal (7/23, O'Keeffe, Mauldin, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) reports 
Secretary of State Pompeo on Thursday called on the Chinese people to change the ruling 
Communist Party's direction. In a speech, Pompeo stopped short of calling for regime change, 
instead urging the Chinese people to work with the US to change the Communist Party's 
behavior. 
The Washington Times (7/23, Gertz, 492K) quotes Pompeo as saying, "We, the free 
nations of the world, must induce change in the CCP's behavior in more creative and assertive 
ways, because Beijing's actions threaten our people and our prosperity. Securing our freedoms 
from the Chinese Communist Party is the mission of our time, and America is perfectly 
positioned to lead it because of our founding principles." 
The Washington Post (7/23, Nakamura, Morello, 14.2M) reports Pompeo's address 
Thursday at the Nixon Presidential Library comes as the Administration is "moving to expand on 
[President Trump's) rhetorical blasts and marshal a broader campaign to punish Beijing on a 
host of unrelated issues." 
The Washington Post (7/23, 14.2M) editorializes that "President Trump is pursuing a 
reckless, incoherent and unilateral offensive against Beijing that appears designed to boost his 
reelection campaign, not manage the complicated challenge posed by the regime of Xi Jinping." 
The Post argues that "Trump's crusade...would be more plausible if it did not represent an 
abrupt, election-season U-turn. Until March, Mr. Trump was publicly praising Mr. Xi as a great 
leader, including in his response to the coronavirus." 
Trump And Putin Discuss Coronavirus, Arms Control. 
Axios (7/23, Rummler, 521K) reports President Trump spoke with Russian President Vladimir 
Putin "about the coronavirus pandemic and arms control on Thursday, the Kremlin announced 
and the White House later confirmed." Trump "reiterated his hope of avoiding an expensive 
three-way arms race between China, Russia, and the United States and looked forward to 
progress on upcoming arms control negotiations in Vienna," White House spokesperson Judd 
Deere said. 
US Accuses Russia Of Testing Anti-Satellite Weapon In Space. 
The AP (7/23, Burns) reports the US on Thursday accused Russia of "conducting a test of an 
anti-satellite weapon in space, asserting that it exposed Moscow's intent to deploy weapons 
that threaten U.S. and allied satellites." In Moscow, the Defense Ministry said the July 15 test 
involved "a small space vehicle" that "inspected one of the national satellites from a close 
distance using special equipment." The US, however, "said the Russian actions were 
inconsistent with the stated mission of an inspector satellite." 
The Washington Times (7/23, Gertz, 492K) reports Air Force Gen. John W. "Jay" 
Raymond, commander of US Space Command, said the test is "further evidence of Russia's 
continuing efforts to develop and test space-based systems, and consistent with the Kremlin's 
published military doctrine to employ weapons that hold U.S. and allied space assets at risk." 
US, Baltic States Oppose Russian "Rewriting Of History." 
Reuters (7/23, Sytas) reports the US on Thursday joined Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia "in 
opposing any Russian attempts to rewrite history after President Vladimir Putin said the Baltic 
states had consented to their 1940 annexation by the Soviet Union." In a joint statement with 
the foreign ministers of the three Baltic countries, Secretary of State Pompeo said, "We stand
