"increasingly concerned with new attacks from New York to California on Asian Americans." 
Hate crimes targeting Asian American hate crimes "are up over 160% in major cities across the 
country," and New York City data shows a 223% increase in such attacks. 
Many Native American Missing Persons Cases Go Unsolved. 
Great Falls (MT) Tribune (5/5, Mabie, 108K) reports Native Americans in the US "go missing and 
are killed at disproportionately high rates nationwide," and "with jurisdictional challenges 
among law enforcement entities and little public outrage, political consequence or media 
attention, cases of missing or murdered Indigenous people often go unsolved." Montana Gov. 
Greg Gianforte "in April signed three bills addressing the missing persons crisis in Montana. Two 
bills will extend a task force and grant program to help tribes report missing people and the 
other will create a review commission under the state Department of Justice to recommend 
policy changes." 
FBI's Closing Of 2004 Child Murder Case Contrasted With Local Detectives' 
Unsuccessful Investigation. 
ABC News (5/5, 2.44M) reports after Kevin Fox of Wilmington, Illinois, was exonerated in the 
killing of his three-year-old daughter Riley, and five years after the murder, the FBI began 
investigating the case. FBI Special Agent Lori Warren "said the FBI started the investigation 
from scratch, as if the murder had just happened." The article contrasts the FBI's investigation 
with that of local detectives. "In 2010, then-Sheriff Paul Kaupas admitted his department 
'obviously dropped the ball' and commissioned an outside review to see what mistakes were 
made during its handling of the case."

Atlanta Police Officer Reinstated Following Brooks Shooting. 
The AP (5/5, Brumback) reports former Atlanta police officer Garrett Rolfe, who has been 
"charged with murder in the shooting death of Rayshard Brooks," was reinstated after a review 
panel "found the city failed to follow its own procedures for disciplinary actions." The Atlanta 
Civil Service Board said in its statement, "Due to the City's failure to comply with several 
provisions of the Code and the information received during witnesses' testimony, the Board 
concludes the Appellant was not afforded his right to due process." Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance 
Bottoms (D) added that Rolfe will "remain on administrative leave until the criminal charges 
against him are resolved." The New York Times (5/5, Fausset, 20.6M) reports that the decision 
"turned not on whether the shooting was justified, but on whether the city had followed proper 
procedures when firing him." The decision "cited the testimony of Sgt. William Dean of the 
Atlanta police's internal affairs division, who said that the firing 'seemed rushed." 
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution (5/5, 1.46M) reports that the Atlanta Police Department 
said of the ruling, "The Civil Service Board (CSB) has reversed the termination of officer Garrett 
Rolfe only on the basis that they were not done in accordance with the Atlanta City Code." It 
added, "It is important to note that the CSB did not make a determination as to whether officer 
Rolfe violated Atlanta Police Department policies. In light of the CSB's rulings, APD will conduct 
an assessment to determine if additional investigative actions are needed." 
The Washington Post (5/5, 10.52M) reports Rolfe "shot Brooks on June 12 after he and his 
partner responded to calls about a man sleeping in a car at a Wendy's drive-through." While 
Brooks "was cooperative at first," he "was shot by Rolfe as he tried to run away, surveillance 
video showed, sparking protests across the city." USA Today (5/5, Miller, 12.7M) reports Rolfe's 
attorney Lance LoRusso said of the ruling, "We are very pleased at this action and consider it 
the first step in the total vindication of Officer Garrett Rolfe."
