=div class="gmail_quote">On Tue, Aug 7, 2018 at 4:35 PM, Dylan Kogan <I have been involved with the Junior Tennis 
Champion Center (JTCC) a non-=rofit 501(c)3 organization based in College Park, Maryland, for the past t=ree years. I 
have trained at JTCC on a number of occasions, and this summe= I am continuing my mission to work with their 
Community Outreach Manager =o introduce tennis to youth and adults of all ages and to develop their sk=lls in a the 
lifetime sport. 
<mailto 
> 
JTCC provides opportunities to children of all demographics and backgrou=ds. It was very personally fulfilling to work 
again with the Community Out=each program, as JTCC sends its own coaches, players and equipment to elem=ntary 
schools and recreation centers in underserved neighborhoods in the g=eater Washington D.C. area. Since its inception in 
2009, the program has i=troduced tennis to over 4,000 children between the ages of five and twelve= Over 100 of the 
most talented and motivated players from the =ommunity Outreach have been invited at no cost to join JTCC programs 
in Co=lege Park, Maryland. They are put on a tennis pathway with the aim of prod=cing graduates who earn a tennis 
scholarship to play at a Division I colle=e. A top-level coaching team monitors the progression of each player at ev=ry 
stage of their development. The combination of tennis and academic inst=uction has led to many success stories. In the 
last seven years, 85 J=CC graduates have earned Division I tennis scholarships worth eight millio= dollars in value, 11 
students have gone on to play tennis for an Ivy Leag=e University and 18 graduates have represented Division III college 
teams.=/span> The sport of tennis teaches an individual to be a self-s=fficient problem solver, but as we all know it can 
lead to being self-cent=red. JTCC believes strongly that their players must learn to "give=back" to the community by 
coaching tennis at Community Outreach si=es. Participants in JTCC's Champions program are required contribu=e at 
least 30 hours of their time each year, providing free tennis instruc=ion at sites in underserved areas. They are 
responsible for helping mentor=and coach those at the start of their own tennis journeys. 
As I mentioned above, JTCC is a 501(c)3 organization and needs to genera=e charitable donations. They have a very 
appealing business model that dep=nds on only a third of their revenue from charitable contributions. This m=ans that 
your donations will be used entirely for community outreach and a=d kids who have been vetted for real financial need. 
My goal this year is =ci raise $100,000(last year i raised $60,000 with your help) for these amaz=ng kids. With your help I 
can make this mission a reality. If you would li=e to send a donation please send it to JTCC 5200 Campus Drive College 
PARK, MD 20740 
<https://maps.google=com/?q=5200+Campus+Drive+College+PARK,+MD+20740&entry=gmail&sorrce=g> attention Ray 
Benton= If you are interested in learning more about JTCC and i=s programs I would love to set up a meeting with you 
and JTCC's CE=, Ray Benton. Also, some of the recipients of your generosity will be comi=g to the Hamptons on August 
24-26 and I can arrange for you to hit with th=m. Thank you for your interest in JTCC. 
=/span> 
Thank you so much for your consideration and for sha=ing in my journey. 
Best,
