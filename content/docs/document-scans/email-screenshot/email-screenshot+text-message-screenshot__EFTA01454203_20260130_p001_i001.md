Under such endeavor, China capital markets will be much more diverse, structured and transparent in the future, and will 
a) mobilize massive private savings; b) encourage inward portfolio flows; and c) lift market sentiment and valuation. 
Promoting mixed ownership reform 
Echoing the on-going SOE reform, the statement said to "actively" develop a mixed ownership economy, to improve the 
modem enterprise system and corporate govemance structure, and to promote equity transfer. Specifically, it 
encouraged the employee stock ownership as well as M&A among companies of different ownership. Entry barrier and 
acquisition restriction on private companies will be further removed. 
In our view, the mixed ownership reform is the key for China reform package on corporate level, which will help enhance 
SOEs' performance, unleash potential of private companies, better allocate resources as well as boost economic 
potential growth. According to our calculation, by Feb 2014,62% of all Chinese listcos' market cap was SOEs either 
central or local ones, while private-owned only accounted for 38%. Among listed SOEs, 54% operated in monopolized 
sectors like oil & gas, banking, telecom and transportation, 42% operated in competitive sectors like food & beverage, 
auto, equipment, etc. Going forward, we expect 1) more monopolized central SOEs, in oil & gas, telecom and 
transportation, to open up for private capital investment with minority shares; 2) large chunk of local SOE shares in 
competitive sectors like F&B, apparel, electrics and healthcare will be taken over by private capitals; 3) more local SOEs 
assets to be listed or injected into listcos. More details of this reform will be elaborated in the upcoming SOE reform plan. 
Managing a balance between innovation, development and financial risk prevention 
While encouraging the innovation and modernization in China capital market, the authorities still keep the financial 
stability as paramount. Risk control, monitoring, reporting and disposal will go side by side with financial market 
evolvement. And most importantly, the bottom line of "no systemic or regional risk" will be firmly held, as per the 
Guideline. The policy also requires good management on the relationships of market vs. government, and investors at 
their own risk vs. investor protection. Investors should have a rational investment principle, awareness of risks, 
responsible for their actions and self-protection ability. Regulators will provide investors, especially small investors, the 
rights to know, to participate, to appeal and to supervise. 
The statement is in line with the "orderly default" concept proposed by regulators in regard of trust market and other 
shadow banking market risk.
