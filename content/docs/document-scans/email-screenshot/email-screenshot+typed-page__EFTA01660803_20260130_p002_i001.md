figundifacing Backlash After Saying She'll Target 'Hate S  — 
CNN (09/17, Collinson) reported that Attorney General Pam Bondi spent Tuesday backtracking after threatening to crack down on "hate speech" 
following Charlie Kirk's assassination and warning of investigations into businesses that refused to print memorial posters. The network noted 
this was the second time AG Bondi had overpromised to please Trump's base — first on a supposed Jeffrey Epstein document dump and now on 
hate speech — only to retreat when backlash mounted. CNN assessed that serving as Trump's attorney general is an "impossible job," as she must 
keep pace with the president's political whims without repeating the mistakes of Jeff Sessions and Bill Ban; who ultimately lost Trump's favor. 
ABC News (09/17, Staff Writer) highlighted that AG Bondi faced criticism from major MAGA influencers and the Wall Street journal editorial 
board, which wrote that Charlie Kirk himself "would want a word" about her remarks and asked, "Is a basic understanding of the First 
Amendment too much to expect from the nation's Attorney General?" The board also dismissed her follow•up comments as incoherent, saying she 
"mixed in everything from 'violent rhetoric to doming" while trying to explain herself. The Daily Beast (09/17, Staff Writer), citing CNN 
statistician Harry Enten, reported that Bondi's approval rating dropped to -19 after the controversy, making her "the least liked member of 
Donald Trump's cabinet, and it ain't even close," followed by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth at •13 and ICE Director Kristi Noem at 
-11. Additional reporting on the story was provided by CNN (09/17, Fritze, Cole), Fox News (09/17, Tamasco), The Guardian (09/17, Berger), The

fontinued Reporting• unresoiveiftoesftons Hong Over Case Against Charlie Kirk's Accused Killer 
Reuters (09/17, Ax, McKay, Harte) and the Associated Press (09/17, Staff Writer) reported that Tyler Robinson, the 22•year•old charged with 
killing conservative activist Charlie Kirk, faces questions about his motives, planning, and whether anyone else knew about his intentions before 
the shooting. Prosecutors said Robinson told his family he had planned the attack for over a week, but they have not released further details 
about his motivations or possible accomplices. According to the articles, Robinson's arrest came after his family, fearing a violent confrontation 
with law enforcement, helped negotiate a "delicate" surrender through a retired deputy who knew the family personally. Investigators found 
Robinson's DNA on the rifle's trigger, confirmed the weapon belonged to his grandfather, and said his mother reported his political views had 
shifted left in the last year, supporting LGBTQ+ rights in contrast to his father's pro:frump stance. The articles noted that authorities are still 
reviewing campus security, investigating whether Robinson acted alone, and trying to understand what drove him to target Kirk, whose politics 
and rhetoric had drawn both loyal supporters and fierce critics. Newsweek (09/17, Mesa) reported that the killing of Kirk has drawn attention to 
the FBI's use of the term "nihilistic violent extremism" (NVE) to describe certain domestic threats, though investigators have not classified 
suspect Tyler Robinson under this label. Director Patel told the Senate judiciary Committee that domestic terrorism cases have surged to more 
than 1,700 this year, with "a large chunk" involving individuals motivated by a "deep hatred of society" and confirmed the bureau is reviewing 
Robinson's online activity, including a Discord chat with over 20 members. According to the article, prosecutors revealed text messages in which 
Robinson admitted to killing Kirk, described hiding his rifle, and left a handwritten note saying he planned the attack for over a week, while 
leaked Discord messages obtained by journalist Ken Klippenstein suggested Robinson was politically disengaged and more focused on gaming 
culture than ideology. Experts cautioned against applying the NVE label too broadly, noting that NVE typically refers to actors driven by 
generalized animosity toward society rather than a clear political agenda, with Director Patel emphasizing that the FBI will "run out every lead" 
in its investigation of Robinson's online contacts. The article noted that while Robinson's digital footprint included memes and video game 
references rather than overt extremism, the FBI continues to investigate whether any coordinated influence or encouragement played a role in 
the attack. Additional reporting on the story was provided by ABC News (09/17, Forrester), the Associated Press (09/17, Bedayn, Schoenbaum, 
Seewer), CBS News (09/17, Kaufman), NBC News (09/17, Orozco), and USA Today (09/17, Nguyen, Cann, et aL).

 He'll Designate Antifa as a Terrorist Group but Offers Few !Walk 
The Associated Press (09/17, Kim) reported that President Trump announced plans to designate antifa as a "major terrorist organization: 
though the White House has not provided details on how the administration would label a decentralized movement as a terror group. Trump, 
speaking from the United Kingdom and later in the Oval Office, called antifa a "SICK, DANGEROUS, RADICAL LEFT DISASTER" and said he would 
move forward with the designation if supported by AG Bondi and others in his Cabinet According to the article, antifa is a domestic entity and 
therefore not eligible for the State Department's foreign terror organization list, and there is currently no domestic equivalent because of First 
Amendment protections and the absence of a singular federal domestic terrorism statute. The article noted that Trump's previous FBI director, 
Christopher Wray, testified in 2020 that antifa is "an ideology, not an organization," lacking the structure typically required for a terrorism 
designation. It also highlighted that Republican lawmakers like Sen. Bill Cassidy and Sen. Ted Cruz have previously supported efforts to classify 
antifa as a domestic terror group, citing its role in promoting violence and anarchy. Hindustan Times (09/17, Biswas) also reported on the story. 
Microsoft Disrupts Global Phishing Campaign That Led to Widespread Credential Theji 
Cyheriecurityltiste (09/17, Jones) reported that Microsoft dismantled the infrastructure of "Raccoon0365," a phishing•as-a•service operation 
responsible for widespread credential theft and attacks on U.S. healthcare organizations. Working with Cloudflare and armed with a court order 
from the Southern District of New York, Microsoft seized 338 web domains linked to Raccoon0365, whose phishing kits had stolen roughly 5,000 
Microsoft 365 credentials in 94 countries since July 2024. According to the article, the phishing service sold subscriptions via Telegram, had at 
least 850 members, collected over S100,000 in cryptocurrency, and was linked to breaches at more than 20 American hospitals, where stolen 
credentials were often used to deploy ransomware. Microsoft identified Nigerian programmer Joseph Ogundipe as the alleged ringleader and 
referred the case to international law enforcement, though the FBI did not immediately comment on the operation. The article noted that Health• 
ISAC supported Microsoft's lawsuit to curb the threat to healthcare systems.
