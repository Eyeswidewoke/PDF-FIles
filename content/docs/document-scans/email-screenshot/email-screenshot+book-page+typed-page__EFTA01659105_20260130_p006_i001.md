with a half-filled gas container with a Christian church pamphlet stuck in its spout as a wick.

where he had been for the first two weeks in April, and his familiarity with the elder care 
campus off Converse Street. The jury found him guilty of lying about his whereabouts over 
those two weeks." US District Judge Mark Mastroianni "declared a mistrial on counts one and 
two, the most onerous of the bunch tethered to a 20-year maximum prison sentence."

Biden Names Prospective Heads Of ODNI, DHS, State, Others. 
CNN (11/23, Mucha, Krieg, 83.16M) reports that on Monday, Joe Biden "unveiled a slate of top 
foreign policy and national security picks." Biden's team confirmed that Antony Blinken would 
be tapped as Secretary of State, while Avril Haines was selected for DNI and Alejandro 
Mayorkas was named as Biden's selection for DHS Secretary. Former Secretary of State John 
Kerry, meanwhile, has been selected "to serve as Biden's climate czar." Biden said, "These 
individuals are equally as experienced and crisis-tested as they are innovative and imaginative. 
Their accomplishments in diplomacy are unmatched, but they also reflect the idea that we 
cannot meet the profound challenges of this new moment with old thinking and unchanged 
habits - or without diversity of background and perspective. It's why I've selected them." 
The Washington Post (11/23, 14.2M) reports that "other high-profile choices announced 
Monday were Jake Sullivan, a Biden adviser who will become national security adviser, and 
Linda Thomas-Greenfield, a longtime diplomat tapped to represent the United States at the 
United Nations." The team named by Biden "have longtime relationships with many 
Republicans. As a group, they inject a new diversity into the foreign policy leadership and signal 
that Biden intends to show the world a different face after the Trump years." 
On NBC Nightly NewsVi (11/23, story 2, 1:45, Holt, 6.28M), Geoff Bennett said that after 
four years of President Trump "often at odds with the foreign policy establishment," Biden "is 
pulling from that group for his first Cabinet picks." On the CBS Evening NewsVi (11/23, story 5, 
1:45, Brennan, 4.43M), Nikole Killion said Biden's national security team is "notable for their 
diverse personal backgrounds, but all with something in common. They served under President 
0bama."
