CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS 
Two US Park Police Officers Surrender To Face Manslaughter Charges. 
On ABC World News TonightVI (10/19, story 5, 1:25, Muir, 7.01M), Adrienne Bankert reported 
two US Park Police officers "are turning themselves in, nearly three years after officials say they 
shot an unarmed motorist." Bankert added dash cam video "shows officers Lucas Vinyard and 
Alejandro Amaya chasing 25-year-old Bijan Ghaisar after he left the scene of a crash where he 
was rear-ended. The officers attempt to approach his vehicle twice with guns pointed at the car. 
Both times Ghaisar pulls away. The third time, officers block the 25-year-old, approaching the 
SUV, again guns drawn. The Jeep moves slightly. The officers then open fire into the car. In all, 
ten shots were fired." Bankert said that while the Justice Department in 2019 "found that 
Vinyard and Amaya had not committed any federal civil rights violations," a state investigation 
"followed, and the officers are now charged with manslaughter and reckless discharge of a 
firearm." 
The Washington Post (10/19, Jackman, 14.2M) says the officers "were booked into the 
jail, and appeared in green jail jumpsuits by video conference for their arraignment later 
Monday morning before Fairfax Circuit Court Judge Richard C. Gardiner. Gardiner allowed both 
Amaya and Vinyard to be released on a $10,000 personal recognizance bond, meaning they did 
not have to pay any money to be released but will owe $10,000 if they fail to appear for court." 
FBI Investigating Murder In Missouri. 
The St. Louis Post-Dispatch (10/19, Rice, 685K) reports that the FBI will "join St. Louis police 
and other law enforcement agencies this week in searching a lake at Forest Park for evidence in 
an ongoing homicide investigation." 
West Virginia Man Sentenced Over Child Pornography. 
The Huntington (WV) Herald-Dispatch (10/19, 87K) reports Jeremiah Alexander Taylor, who 
"pleaded guilty to distribution of child pornography," was "sentenced in U.S. District Court in 
Huntington to serve a seven-and-a-half year prison sentence." The investigation began after an 
undercover FBI agent "posted several online bulletin messages on social media forums" 
frequented by individuals who have a sexual interest in children and incest. Taylor messaged 
agent, who later "determined Taylor appeared to be a member and participant of a child 
pornography group where group members posted thousands of images and videos of child 
porn." 
Texas Man Charged With Bribery. 
KRGV-TV Harlingen, TX (10/19) reports Brownsville school board trustee Sylvia P. Atkinson will

board's agenda.

The Lansing (MI) State Journal (10/19, 206K) reports that the FBI supported the investigation 
into the disappearance of two-year-old Phoenix Washington Jr, who was kidnapped by his

theft and parental kidnapping."
