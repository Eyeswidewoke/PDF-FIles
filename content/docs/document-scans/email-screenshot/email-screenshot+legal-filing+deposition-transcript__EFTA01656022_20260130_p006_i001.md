COUNTERINTELLIGENCE 
Europe Worries About Its Dependence on U.S. Intelligence Under Trump 
The Washington Post (06/05, Miller, Mekhennet, Francis) reported that European security officials are worried 
about their dependence on U.S. intelligence under President Donald Trump, fearing being cut off from crucial 
information or facing reduced intelligence gathering on Russia. According to the article, the concerns stem from 
Trump's history of siding with the Kremlin and perceived purges of U.S. intelligence officers and analysts, which 
could damage U.S. spy agencies and impact the flow of intelligence to European allies. The article explained that in 
response, European countries, including Germany and the UK, are trying to preserve their relationship with the U.S. 
while also exploring ways to reduce their dependence on U.S. intelligence, such as boosting their own spy agencies 
and deepening continental cooperation. The article highlighted that America's closest ally, the United Kingdom, has 
cultivated members of Trump's security team with royal treatment. Last month, Director Patel and Deputy Director 
Bongino dined with King Charles III and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer at Windsor Castle. They were joined by 
other spy chiefs gathered in London for a summit of the "Five Eyes" partnership, an exclusive intelligence-sharing 
arrangement involving the United States, the U.K., Canada, Australia and New Zealand. The article noted that 
Charles used the occasion to praise the ongoing value of the Five Eyes alliance, officials said, which Trump trade 
adviser Peter Navarro suggested dismembering earlier this year with a proposal to expel Canada. The FBI declined 
to comment. 
Continued Reporting: Chinese Nationals Charged With Conspiracy, Smuggling Dangerous Biological 
Pathogen 
The Fence Post (06/05, Staff Writer) reported that Yunqing liar) and Zunyong Liu, Chinese nationals, have been 
charged with conspiracy and smuggling a dangerous biological pathogen, Fusarium graminearum, into the U.S. The 
pathogen is a potential agroterrorism weapon that can cause significant economic losses and harm to humans and 
livestock. Jian and Liu allegedly smuggled the pathogen into the U.S. through the Detroit Metropolitan Airport, 
intending to conduct research on it at the University of Michigan laboratory where Jian worked. "The federal 
charges announced today against Yunqing Jian and Zunyong Liu, both residents of the People's Republic of China, 
signify a crucial advancement in our efforts to safeguard our communities and uphold national security," said 
Cheyvoryea Gibson, special agent in charge of the FBI Detroit Field Office. "These individuals exploited their access 
to laboratory facilities at a local university to engage in the smuggling of biological pathogens, an act that posed an 
imminent threat to public safety. Thanks to the exceptional investigative efforts of the FBI Detroit 
Counterintelligence Task Force, in close cooperation with U.S. Customs and Border Protection's Office of Field 
Operations these dangerous activities have been effectively halted. The FBI remains resolutely committed to 
collaborating with our law enforcement partners to protect the residents of Michigan and defend the United States 
against such grave threats." Fox News (06/05, Miller) added that Michael Sobolik, a senior fellow at the Hudson 
Institute, told Fox News after Director Patel announced the arrests, that the arrests should be a wake-up call, as the 
CCP aims to "kill Americans" and is in a "cold war" with the U.S. An opinion piece from the Washington Times 
(06/05, Sadler) quoted a statement from Director Patel: "This case is a sobering reminder that the CCP is working 
around the clock to deploy operatives and researchers to infiltrate American institutions and target our food 
supply, which would have grave consequences ... putting American lives and our economy at serious risk." The 
article added that when the China Initiative was launched in 2018, FBI Director Christopher A. Wray testified on the 
"naivete" of college administrators in admitting CCP agents. "The use of nontraditional collectors, especially in the 
academic setting — whether it's professors, scientists, students — we see in almost every field office that the FBI 
has around the country," he said. The Hill (06/05, Taub) and WXYZ (ABC-7) (06/05, Jones) also reported on the 
story. 
The Trump Administration Revives an Old Intimidation Tactic: The Polygraph Machine 
An analysis from CNN (06/05, Wolf) reported that the Trump administration is using polygraph tests as a method of 
intimidation to ferret out leakers, according to attorney Mark Zaid, who specializes in representing people who 
work in national security. According to the article, the use of polygraph tests has been reported at various agencies, 
including the FBI, Pentagon, and Department of Homeland Security, with officials defending the practice as a way 
to protect government information. The article noted that critics argue that polygraph tests are unreliable and can 
be used to falsely accuse innocent people, with examples including the failure to detect spies such as Aldrich Ames 
and Robert Hanssen, who either passed polygraph exams or were never given one.
