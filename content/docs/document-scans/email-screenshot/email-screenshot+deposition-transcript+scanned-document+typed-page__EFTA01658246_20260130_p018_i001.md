the unsealing and release of documents in a 2015 civil lawsuit that included a deposition given 
by Maxwell in the case brought by Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre. Less than three hours later, 
Preska denied it, citing `eleventh-hour request for reconsideration.' She allowed Maxwell's 
attorneys two days to seek a stay from an appeals court on two key depositions but otherwise 
ordered the unsealing of other documents to begin Thursday." 
The Washington Post (7/29, Jacobs, 14.2M) reports that Maxwell's attorneys "asked a 
federal judge Wednesday to block the planned unsealing of depositions she gave as part of a 
lawsuit, alleging the transcripts were leaked illegally to prosecutors seeking her conviction." 
Judge Preska "gave Maxwell's lawyers until Friday to appeal" her Wednesday ruling. The Post 
adds, "In his letter to Preska, Maxwell's lawyer Ty Gee argued that a protective order prevented 
the deposition transcripts from being made available to anyone, including law enforcement, and 
that releasing the documents could jeopardize Maxwell's ability to have a fair trial. Preska said 
the potential for Maxwell to be indicted has been looming throughout discussions as to what to 
unseal, and was considered in her rulings. It was not a new issue requiring additional litigation, 
the judge wrote."

white striped jumpsuit, the man accused of shooting a task force agent last week in Gautier 
appeared in federal court Wednesday morning." WDBD-TV adds, "Before the preliminary hearing 
began, Joseph Sonnier could be seen whispering to his mom, telling her he loved her. Only one 
witness took the stand during the hearing, a FBI agent who recounted the events of July 21, 
2020, when Sonnier allegedly fired two shots at U.S. marshals who were attempting to arrest 
him." Sonnier "admitted to authorities that he knew there were multiple officers outside the 
hotel room at the Siegel Select in Gautier when he fired his weapon towards them, said the FBI 
agent. The remaining officers then returned fire. According to the affidavit, Sonnier said he was 
trying to commit suicide and hoped the officers would kill him."
