Wednesday." In the letter, "Barra said GM expects to have a strong first half with adjusted

Lawmakers Seek Administration's Help To Eliminate Vietnamese Pork Tariffs. 
Bloomberg (5/5, Boudreau, 3.57M) reports a bipartisan group of 72 House lawmakers have 
written to US Trade Representative Tai asking the Administration "to seek the elimination of

Southeast Asian country over currency and trade practices." Vietnam's domestic pig firms have 
been devastated by the African swine fever, creating a high demand for imported pork, but the 
lawmakers said in the letter that "significant tariff and non-tariff barriers unfortunately prevent 
U.S. pork from competing in that country, even as it seeks reliable sources of non-domestic 
pork."

business investment deal with Beijing hangs in the balance because of a rapidly deteriorating 
political climate over accusations that China abuses an ethnic minority."
