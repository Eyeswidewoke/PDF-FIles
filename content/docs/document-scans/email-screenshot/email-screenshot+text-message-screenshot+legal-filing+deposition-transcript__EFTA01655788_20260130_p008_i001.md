An opinion piece by The Hill (02/29, Moore) reported that President Biden's TikTok debut on Super Bowl Sunday, 
aimed at engaging "Gen 2" voters, has sparked debate over the contradictory nature of his administration's China 
policy, particularly given the platform's Chinese ownership and concerns over Communist Party control. According 
to the article, this move came despite Biden's stated goal of "de-risking" the U.S. economy from China and previous 
actions by his administration, including banning TikTok on official devices due to national security concerns. The 
article explained that Director Wray had previously warned about the potential for China to use TikTok to harvest 
personal data from American users, framing it as a significant national security concern.

CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS 
Special Counsel Wants to Know if Potential Jurors in Classified Documents Case Believe 2020 Election Was 
Stolen 
CNN (02/29, Sneed, Rabinowitz) reported that prosecutors want to ask potential jurors in the Mar-a-
Lago classified documents case against former President Donald Trump whether they believe the 2020 election was 
stolen — one of several proposed queries for the jury pool that prosecutors and the defendants are at odds over, 
according to a new court filing. The article added that prosecutors and defense attorneys submitted a list of 
questions for potential jurors for the judge overseeing the case to review. The filing outlines which questions the 
parties agree are necessary to ask people called for jury duty when the case goes to trial, and which questions they 
disagree on asking. The article stated that according to the new jury questionnaire filing, defense attorneys object 
to asking questions about potential jurors' feelings on the DOJ and FBI, and their opinions and news consumption 
around the FBI's 2022 search of Mar-a-Lago. The defense also opposes specific references to Trump's properties, 
including the Mar-a-Lago estate, in some of the questions. According to the article, meanwhile, the defendants are 
proposing — to the objection of special counsel Jack Smith's office — that jurors be asked if they're registered to vote 
if they voted in 2020 and whether they have a registered party affiliation. The special counsel also opposes a 
question proposed by the defense seeking negative views potential jurors have of politicians. The Washington 
Examiner (02/29, Deese) also reported on the story. 
FBI Informant in Hunter Biden Case Left Trail of Broken Promises 
The Wall Street Journal (02/29, Forrest, Balhaus, Viswanatha) reported that for years, the man now charged with 
lying about President Biden and his son Hunter brought information to the FBI while trying to cash in on his 
connections with the agency. The article added that Alexander Smirnov pitched himself to business associates in 
the U.S. as everything from an expert on taking companies public to being a de facto FBI official with vast 
operational authority in Ukraine, according to interviews. Associates often questioned whether Smirnov could 
deliver, including on claims that he could leverage his relationships with the Ukrainian president and the ruler of 
Dubai to help them. The FBI, over time, began to question the veracity of its confidential source's tips, too. The 
article noted that after telling Smirnov a half-dozen times between 2010 and 2020 that he might need to testify in 
court over information he provided the agency, the FBI in recent years grew skeptical of some of his claims, 
according to court filings. That included allegations central to Republican lawmakers' effort to impeach Biden that 
the president and his son had received millions of dollars in bribes from a Ukrainian company, Burisma. The article 
mentioned that prosecutors now say the Biden allegations were fabrications, and Smirnov recently acknowledged 
that one story about Hunter Biden came from Russian intelligence sources. Smirnov, 43 years old, has been 
detained as he awaits trial on charges of lying to the FBI, with a federal judge in Los Angeles declaring there was 
"nothing garden-variety" about the case. Smirnov has pleaded not guilty. 
Jeffrey Epstein Grand Jury Records From Underage Girl Abuse Probe to Be Released Under Florida Law 
The Associated Press (02/29, Anderson) reported that grand jury transcripts from a 2006 Florida investigation 
into Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of dozens of underage girls will be released publicly later this year under legislation 
signed into law Thursday by Gov. Ron DeSantis. A local judge cited the new law in denying the release of the 
records for now. According to the article, the measure, which takes effect July 1, would carve out a limited 
exception to the secrecy that generally shrouds grand jury testimony in specific cases such as that involving Epstein, 
DeSantis said at a signing ceremony in Palm Beach, Florida, where many of the crimes took place at Epstein's 
home. The Hill (02/29, Timotija), NPR (02/29, Allen), Business Insider (02/29, Griffiths, Shamsian), the Daily 
Beast (02/29, Yen), and Fox News (02/29, Ruiz) also reported on the story.
