SC World (06/02, Staff Writer) reported that the personal mobile device of White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles 
was infiltrated in a cyberattack, allowing attackers to impersonate her in messages and calls to various officials. 
According to the article, the incident is under federal investigation, with the FBI emphasizing its commitment to 
protecting the administration's communication security. The article noted that this is not the first time Wiles' 
messages have been compromised, as she was previously targeted by alleged Iranian state-sponsored threat actors 
during Donald Trump's presidential campaign. "Safeguarding our administration officials' ability to securely 
communicate to accomplish the president's mission is a top priority," said Director Patel in a statement. ABC News 
(06/02, Murray) also reported on the story. 
FBI Cracks Down on Crypting Crew in a Global Counter-Antivirus Service Disruption 
CSO Online (06/02, Sharma) reported that U.S. law enforcement, in coordination with global efforts, has disrupted 
counter-antivirus (CAV) operations by seizing four leading domains, including AVCheck.net, Cryptor.biz, and 
Crypt.guru. According to the article, the seized domains were part of an "online software crypting syndicate" that 
helped cybercriminals evade detection by scrambling malware codes and refining their tools to slip past security 
systems. The article noted that the takedown, part of Operation Endgame, aims to disrupt the activities of 
cybercriminals and prevent victims, with the FBI and other authorities working together to shut down providers of 
malicious tools for cybercriminals. "Cybercriminals don't just create malware; they perfect it for maximum 
destruction," said the release, citing FBI Houston Special Agent in Charge Douglas Wiliams. "By leveraging counter 
antivirus services, malicious actors refine their weapons against the world's toughest security systems to better slip 
past firewalls, evade forensic analysis, and wreak havoc across victims' systems." Tech Monitor (06/02, Bairaboina) 
also reported on the story. 
U.S. Cyber Agency CISA Faces Stiff Budget Cuts 
The Wall Street Journal (06/02, Rundle) reported that CISA faces a $495 million funding cut to $2.38 billion in 
President Trump's proposed budget for fiscal 2026. According to the article, the budget proposes a head-count 
reduction of approximately 1,000 positions, or around one-third of CISA's workforce, with significant cuts to 
outreach programs and the election-security program. The cuts have been criticized by Democrats and some 
Republicans, who argue that reducing CISA's operations will weaken the country's cyber defenses at a time when 
cyber threats are perceived to be at a record high. Computer Weekly (06/02, Scroxton) reported that other planned 
cuts potentially affecting the U.S. cyber security mission include proposals to trim the budget allocated to the FBI, 
which deals with cyber crime in the U.S., and a unit at the Department of Energy that deals with threats to 
CNI. Additional reporting on the story was provided by Nextgov (06/02, Dimolfetta), CyberScoop (06/02, Starks), 
and Cybersecurity Dive (06/02, Geller). 
Funnull Infrastructure Provider Hit With OFAC Sanctions Over Role in Cyber Scams 
CPO Magazine (06/02, Ikeda) reported that the Philippines-based company Funnull Technology and its 
administrator Liu Lizhi have been sanctioned by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) for providing 
infrastructure for hundreds of thousands of malicious sites engaging in cyber scams. According to the 
article, Funnull has facilitated over $200 million in fraud by supporting "pig butchering" schemes, including 
cryptocurrency and romance scams, with the help of legitimate U.S. IP addresses and secure "https" URLs. The 
article noted that the FBI has issued a cybersecurity advisory warning about the company's role in these scams, 
which have been linked to crime rings in Southeast Asia and have used forced labor to communicate with victims.
