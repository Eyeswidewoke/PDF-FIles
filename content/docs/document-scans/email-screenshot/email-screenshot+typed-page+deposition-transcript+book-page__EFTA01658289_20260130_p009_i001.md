blow up New York City buildings in 1993 - and then alarmed federal officials by vowing to stop 
taking his meds. Victor Alvarez's return to society got off to a rocky start in Manhattan Federal 
Court as he began a three-year term of supervised release for what prosecutors called a 
conspiracy to 'wage a war of urban terrorism' by bombing the FBI building in New York, United 
Nations and other targets. He insisted on an in-person hearing so he and his court-appointed 
attorney could explain that he would refuse mental health treatment and medicine to treat his 
mental illness while on home confinement at the Bellevue Men's Shelter."

Full DC Appeals Court To Review DO3's Decision To Drop Flynn Case. 
The Washington Post (7/30, Marimow, 14.2M) reports that on Thursday, the full US Court of 
Appeals for the DC Circuit "agreed...to revisit US District Judge Emmet G. Sullivan's plan to 
examine" the Justice Department's decision to drop its case against former national security 
adviser Michael Flynn, thereby "reviving the unusual case testing the limits of the judiciary's 
power to check the executive branch." The Post adds "the decision to rehear the case before a 
full complement of judges wipes out the June ruling from a three-judge panel that ordered 
Sullivan to immediately dismiss the case and said Sullivan was wrong to appoint a retired 
federal judge to argue against the government's move to undo Flynn's guilty plea." Politico 
(7/30, Gerstein, Cheney, 4.29M) says Thursday's announcement is "a setback for Flynn, who 
scored an unexpected victory on the issue last month." Fox News (7/30, Olson, 27.59M) calls 
the move "the latest twist in the long-running legal drama that stemmed from the FBI's 
investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia in 2016." 
NPR (7/30, Johnson, 3.12M) reports that the full appeals court "likely will assess whether 
Sullivan can go ahead with the consideration and investigation of the government's change of 
heart; the smaller panel of judges ruled that he had overstepped himself and violated the 
privilege of the executive branch to reach decisions about prosecutions confidentially." 
The Washington Times (7/30, Mordock, 492K) points out "the DC Circuit is currently 
composed of seven judges appointed by three Democrats and four Republican appointees." 
Bloomberg (7/30, Larson, Yaffe-Bellany, 4.73M) reports that the appellate court "said in a one-
page order that the `parties should be prepared to address whether there are "no other 
adequate means to attain the relief" desired." The Wall Street Journal (7/30, Tau, Subscription 
Publication, 7.57M) reports that arguments are set for August 11. 
USA Today (7/30, Phillips, 10.31M) indicates that "rehearing a case that had already been 
ruled on is very rare, a request granted only in proceedings that involve `a question of 
exceptional importance' and when the court feels the need to 'maintain uniformity' in its 
decisions." USA Today adds "the move set off an unusual legal battle in the appeals court, 
where both the defense and prosecution wanted to dismiss the case while the presiding judge -
himself represented by an attorney - argued he's entitled to scrutinize the Justice Department's 
motives for dropping the prosecution." CNBC (7/30, Mangan, Breuninger, 3.62M) says the 
decision "implies that at least some judges on the appeals court believe Sullivan should be 
given the opportunity to rule on the dismissal request before an appeal is heard of his refusal to 
do so." The AP (7/30, Tucker) reports "Sidney Powell, a lawyer for Flynn, did not immediately 
return an email seeking comment, but did tweet the news and wrote, `WOW!" 
Powell said on Fox News' Hannity (7/30, 535K), "It is a sad day for the rule of law. Judge 
Sullivan's petition for rehearing should not have even been considered by the court because he 
had no standing to file it. He's not a party in the case. He is supposed to be a neutral umpire. 
And yet, he has taken on the role of an advocate for some sort of hearing that he wants to 
conduct back in his court on an issue that the government has decided to dismiss, a case it has 
decided to drop. ... He cannot act as a prosecutor because only the Department of Justice can 
under Article II of the Constitution. So, there are two Constitutional provisions that preclude
