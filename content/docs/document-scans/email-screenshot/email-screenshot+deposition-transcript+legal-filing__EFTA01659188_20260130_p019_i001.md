The New York Times (5/5, Rosa, 20.6M) reports that an estimated 68% of New York City's Asian 
American community "has received at least one dose, despite many New Yorkers of Asian 
descent facing language barriers and a fear of violence." The article attributes some of the 
success to Mekong NYC, which "is one of several community-based organizations that have 
been instrumental in helping Asian-American communities schedule vaccine appointments and 
translate Covid-19 information accurately." 
Cuomo Announces September Resumption For Broadway. 
The New York Times (5/5, Paulson, 20.6M) reports that while New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio 
(D) "says he wants the city to fully reopen on July 1," New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) "said 
Wednesday that Broadway shows would start selling tickets for full-capacity shows with some 
performances starting Sept. 14." The delay is attributed to concerns that tourists and arts 
patrons will not be comfortable with attending a tightly packed shows for another few months. 
The Wall Street Journal (5/5, Passy, Subscription Publication, 8.41M) reports Cuomo declined to 
demand that Broadway shows mandate vaccinations to purchase tickets. 
Biden Open To Compromise On Jobs Plan, But Says He Will Not "Deficit-Spend." 
The Washington Post (5/5, Wagner, 10.52M) reports that on Wednesday, President Biden 
"said...he is open to compromise on his $2 trillion infrastructure and jobs plan but that he 
stands by his proposal to finance the plan by increasing taxes on corporations and wealthy 
Americans - an idea Republicans have soundly rejected." Biden said , "I'm willing to 
compromise, but I'm not willing to not pay for what we're talking about. I'm not willing to 
deficit-spend." Fox Business (5/5, Lea, 3.06M) reports on its website that Biden suggested "that 
he is open to negotiating with Republicans on his proposed corporate tax hike, indicating that 
nothing that he has put forward is set in stone." Asked if he would consider a 25 percent 
corporate tax rate instead of the 28 percent rate he proposed, Biden said he was "open to 
compromising, yes." 
But the New York Times (5/5, Tankersley, Karni, 20.6M) says Biden "defended with gusto 
his plans to increase taxes on high earners and the wealthy." Biden told reporters, "We're not 
going to deprive any of these executives of their second or third home, travel privately by jet. 
... It's not going to affect their standard of living at all. Not a little tiny bit. But I can affect the 
standard of living that people I grew up with." The Hill (5/5, 5.69M) quotes Biden as saying, 
"I'm going to have to be able to explain this and I'm going to keep banging on it." 
Asked on MSNBCVi (5/5, 832K) about the Administration's willingness to compromise, 
HHS Secretary Becerra said, "I think the most important thing to the President is getting 
something done that helps the American people. ... We understand how important it is...to have 
paid family or medical leave. ... I think the President has said he's willing to discuss the path 
that we get there; he just wants to make sure we reach the destination, and one of those 
things in the American Family Plan is providing paid family and medical leave to American 
workers." 
E.J. Dionne writes in the Washington Post (5/5, 10.52M) that the "real game-changer in 
Biden's raft of policy proposals is the revenue he would raise from the wealthy." His plans "are 
routinely described as big, bold and progressive. This is true but incomplete." What is "really 
bold," Dionne argues, "is Biden's effort to create a stream of revenue through higher taxes on 
the wealthy and corporations that would support his efforts on education, child care, 
infrastructure and more help for low-income families." 
Biden Touts High Demand For Restaurant Assistance Funds. 
The New York Times (5/5, Karni, 20.6M) reports President Biden said Wednesday that 186,200 
restaurants, bars and other eligible businesses applied for help through the $28.6 billion 
Restaurant Revitalization Fund in the first two days it was accepting applications. The numbers 
"indicat[e) huge demand from a struggling industry for a limited pot of relief funds." The Times
