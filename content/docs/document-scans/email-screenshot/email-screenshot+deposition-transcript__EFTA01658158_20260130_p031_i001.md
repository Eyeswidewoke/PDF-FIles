through the weekend, causing disruption to the company's online services for millions of users, 
including Garmin Connect, which syncs user activity and data to the cloud and other devices." 
The attack also" took down flyGarmin, its aviation navigation and route-planning service." 
Garmin has "said little about the incident so far." A banner on its website reads: "We are 
currently experiencing an outage that affects Garmin.com and Garmin Connect. This outage 
also affects our call centers, and we are currently unable to receive any calls, emails or online 
chats. We are working to resolve this issue as quickly as possible and apologize for this 
inconvenience." 
Op-Ed: Cyberespionage Is Now A Permanent Part Of Geopolitics. 
In an op-ed in the Globe and Mail (CAN) (7/24, 1.04M), Ben Buchanan, an assistant teaching 
professor at Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service, wrote, "In the past week, 
citizens of Canada, the US and the UK have had a behind-the-curtain peek on how espionage 
works today. The governments of the three countries warned that hackers working for Russian 
intelligence services had spied on COVID-19 vaccine research. ... These incidents confirm just 
how vital hacking to steal secrets is to modern statecraft." He concludes, "We should recognize 
that cyberespionage is here to stay as part of modern geopolitics, whether we like it or not. ... 
For some, this realization will be saddening and will suggest that norms of restraint are further 
away than they might like; for others, it is simply a recognition of the inevitable, of how far we 
are from the optimal world of greater co-operation against disease and other shared risks." 
Russia's GRU Hackers Hit US Government And Energy Targets. 
Ars Technica (7/25, 1.36M) reported the FBI notified organizations in May "that Russia's elite 
hackers had targeted them." The campaign "likely remains ongoing." Russia's GRU military 
intelligence agency "has carried out many of the most aggressive acts of hacking in history: 
destructive worms, blackouts, and - closest to home for Americans — a broad hacking-and-
leaking operation designed to influence the outcome of the 2016 US presidential election." Now 
it "appears the GRU has been hitting US networks again, in a series of previously unreported 
intrusions that targeted organizations ranging from government agencies to critical 
infrastructure." The revelation of a "potentially ongoing US-targeted GRU hacking spree is 
especially troubling in light of the GRU's past operations, which have often gone beyond mere 
espionage to include embarrassing email leaks or even disruptive cyberattacks." 
FBI Warns US Companies About Backdoors In Chinese Tax Software. 
ZDNet (7/24, Cimpanu, 299K) reported the FBI "has sent an alert on Thursday warning US 
companies about backdoor malware that is silently being installed on the networks of foreign 
companies operating in China via government-mandated tax software." The backdoors "allow 
threat actors to execute unauthorized code, infiltrate networks, and steal proprietary data from 
branches operating in China." The FBI "says that all foreign companies are required by local 
Chinese laws to install this particular piece of software in order to handle value-added tax (VAT) 
payments to the Chinese tax authority." FBI officials "said the backdoor malware was spotted in 
the VAT software of two Chinese tech companies - namely Baiwang and Aisino." 
WPost: Countries Should Be Figuring Out To Share Vaccine Information, Not Steal It. 
The US and China "in particular have been playing a coronavirus blame game over the past few 
months," exemplified by reporting hacking attempts to steal vaccine research, the Washington 
Post (7/25, 14.2M) editorializes. The Post editorial board writes: "The reality is that every 
country will benefit from every other country having access to a vaccine. They should be 
figuring out how to share the wealth, not how to steal it."
