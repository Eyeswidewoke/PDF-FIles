"The conflict shows how much the region has changed since the Arab uprisi=gs began," said Nathan Thrall, who 
researches Israel and the Palestinian=territories for the International Crisis Group, which works to prevent con=lict. 
"Now when Gaza is under fire, the loudest voices come not from the=so-called Axis of Resistance — Iran, Syria and 
Hezbollah — but from U.=. allies like Egypt and Qatar." 
One possible way out of the crisis, Mr. Thrall suggested, would be a three-=arty deal in which Hamas vows to contain 
Gaza's more extreme elements in=exchange for improved trade through Rafah, the border crossing controlled =y Egypt, 
as well as Kerem Shalom, the commercial crossing managed by Israe=. 
"The new X-factor is that Egypt is now part of that mix," said David Ma=ovsky of the Washington Institute for Near East 
Policy. Hamas, he said, ho=es the message to Israel will be: "You don't want to mess with us in G=za because you'll hurt 
your relationship with Cairo." 
President Mohamed Morsi of Egypt has so far rallied to Hamas's side: he n=t only recalled his ambassador from Israel 
but is sending his prime minste=, Hesham Kandil, here on to "confirm Egypt's solidarity with the peopl= of Gaza in the 
face of the wanton Israeli aggression," according to a s=atement from his spokesman on Thursday. 
Ismail Haniyeh, the Hamas prime minister, thanked Mr. Morsi in a televised =peech on Thursday night "for the quick and 
brave decisions he made," a=ding, 'Today's Egypt is unlike that of yesterday." 
Coming weeks after the emir of Qatar became the first head of state to step=foot in Gaza since Hamas took control in 
2007, the visit of such a high-ra=king Egyptian creates a dilemma for Israel. Intense bombing during or befo=e Mr. 
Kandil's visit could be a public relations disaster internationall=, but agreeing to a cease-fire without responding harshly 
to the rocket fi=e near Tel Aviv and the three civilian deaths near Gaza would be difficult=for those at home to swallow. 
"If this had happened before, there would have been more pressure on the =alestinians," said Waleed al-Modallal, a 
political science professor at =he Islamic University of Gaza. "Now the resistance is working freely." 
Not entirely freely. Mourners broke into a jog on Thursday morning as they =ccompanied Mr. Jabari's remains from his 
home to a mosque for his funera= because Israeli planes were dropping bombs nearby. High-ranking Hamas off=cials 
were not among the crowds, heeding Israel's warning to stay out of=sight or risk the same fate. 
Among the Palestinian fatalities were five children, two men over 55 and a =regnant 19-year-old, according to relatives 
and Gaza health officials. 
"We heard an explosion that shook the house, and in a moment a shell hit =he house," said Um Jihad, the mother-in-law 
of the pregnant woman, Heba =I-Mash'harawi, and grandmother of one of the babies, 11-month-old Omar. 
Furniture and curtains were ablaze in seconds, and the baby suffocated from=smoke, family members said. 
As bombing continued — a dozen an hour, according to an Israeli military =pokesman — schools were closed and most 
Gazans huddled indoors, some fle=ing the harder-hit outskirts of the cities for relatives' homes in more =opulated areas. 
Amnah Hassan, 53, said 25 people from three generations crowded into the ce=ter of the ground floor of their home, 
away from windows and only venturin= out in the late afternoon to buy a battery-operated radio to monitor 
news=when electricity went out. 
Israel dropped leaflets warning Gazans to stay away from facilities used by=Hamas to store weapons and accused Hamas 
of using civilians as human shiel=s by setting up such storehouses in residential neighborhoods. 
"Their father was killed in Cast Lead, so they are more terrified," Ms.=Hassan said of three of her grandchildren. "In Cast 
Lead the bombings di= not stop. Here, it becomes quiet for a while, then we think it's going =o be quiet, then suddenly 
the airstrikes resume. We don't know what's =oing to happen later." 
Thursday was the Islamic New Year, but there were no parties here. Normally=traffic-clogged boulevards were mostly 
empty, and marketplaces had shutter=d shops instead of shoppers. 
"Who will think of eating sweets in these bitter circumstances?" asked =ohammed Elmzaner outside his bakery.

Netanyahu's Extremely Risky Gamble
