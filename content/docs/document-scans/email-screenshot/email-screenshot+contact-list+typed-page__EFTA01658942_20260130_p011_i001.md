Austria Acknowledges Mistakes Preceding Terror Attack, Orders Vienna Mosque 
Closed. 
Reuters (11/6, Murphy, Knolle, Grulovic) reports that on Friday, Austrian officials "admitted 
'intolerable mistakes' in the handling of intelligence on the jihadist who killed four people in 
Vienna on Monday, saying it could have considered him a greater threat and monitored him 
more closely." According to Reuters, "Austria had already admitted fumbling intelligence from 
Slovakia that the 20-year-old gunman, who was shot dead by police during his rampage in the 
centre of the capital, had attempted to buy ammunition there." Reuters says Austria has 
"ordered the closure of a mosque and a prayer room in Vienna that the attacker visited 
frequently and which had contributed to his radicalisation." In addition, The Washington Post 
(11/6, Morris, 14.2M) reports Austrian Interior Minister Karl Nehammer "said Friday that there 
were 'immediate personnel consequences,' as Austrian News Agency APA reported that Erich 
Zwettler, head of Vienna's local intelligence office, had resigned." 
Ivory Coast's State Prosecutor Accuses Opposition Leaders Of Terrorism.

disobedience campaign and a transitional government."

Election Security Funding More Likely To Come From Biden Administration. 
The Washington Post (11/6, Marks, 14.2M) reports, "Election security advocates are pushing for 
up to $3 billion from Congress they say is vital to help protect election systems against 
hacking." As President-elect Biden "has described election security as a major challenge," that 
funding "will be far more likely to come through in a Biden administration." President Trump, on 
the other hand, "has paid little attention to the topic" and "repeatedly questioned intelligence 
agencies' conclusion that Russia interfered in the 2016 election and spread disinformation about 
the 2020 contest." Republicans have "consistently rebuffed Democratic efforts to deliver far 
more money and to couple it with cybersecurity mandates for states." Democrats have long 
sought mandating "that states make specific improvements such as using paper ballots and 
meeting minimum cybersecurity standards," measures which "Republicans have opposed." 
Opinion: New OPM, ODNI Report Shows USAGM Needs A "Shakeup." 
James S. Robbins, senior fellow for national security affairs at the American Foreign Policy 
Council, writes in an op-ed in The Hill (11/7, 2.98M) that OPM and the ODNI found "previous 
senior leaders knew about" the "severe shortcomings" at USAGM and "did little to nothing to fix 
them," according to a 2020 follow-up report. The agencies "identified glaring deficiencies in the 
agency's handling of personnel security and the safeguarding of classified documents" between 
2010 and 2014. For instance, people "were given clearances who lied on forms, left required 
sections blank, and even used fake names." Robbins says the problems "long predated both the 
Trump administration and the confirmation of Michael Pack as the agency's CEO." USAGM is "a 
disorganized, moribund bureaucracy - one that has in fact long been in need of a shakeup." 
NNSA Administrator Resigns After Clash With Energy Secretary Brouillette. 
Bloomberg (11/7, Natter, Jacobs, 4.73M) reports that NNSA administrator and undersecretary 
of Energy for nuclear security Lisa E. Gordon-Hagerty "resigned Friday after clashing with 
Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette." Gordon-Hagerty "resigned after being told by Brouillette's 
office that President Donald Trump had lost faith in her ability to do her job," according to 
unnamed sources. NNSA said in a statement, "As administrator, Ms. Gordon-Hagerty oversaw
