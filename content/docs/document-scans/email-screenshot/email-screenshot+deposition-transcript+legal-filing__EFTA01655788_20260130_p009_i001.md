Florida Couple Arrested for Allegedly Kidnapping Cousin's Baby, Posing as Amazon Delivery Driver 
Fox News (02/29, Price) reported that a Florida couple has been arrested for allegedly kidnapping a baby from a 
Washington state city where one of the suspects posed as an Amazon delivery driver in an elaborate ruse, 
according to court documents. The article stated that King County prosecutors have charged Marlly Jarina Ardila-
Urrego, 33, and Chun Ho Vincent Lai, 42, with first-degree kidnapping, first-degree burglary, second-degree assault 
of a child, first-degree robbery, and second-degree assault, with aggravating factors for preying on a vulnerable 
victim and the sophistication of planning. The article added that the two planned to kidnap the infant of one of 
Ardila-Urrego's relatives. The couple lives in Florida, and traveled up to Washington state solely to kidnap the 7-
month-old baby, prosecutors said. The article mentioned that shortly after the victim's husband left for work, 
Vincent Lai, allegedly posed as an Amazon deliveryman holding a box, and knocked on the mother's Federal Way 
apartment door, prosecutors said. The woman, who was expecting a delivery, opened the door after looking 
through the peephole and was punched multiple times in the face and knocked to the ground. The article noted 
that after collecting evidence and surveillance video, FBI agents were able to track the location of Ardila-Urrego's 
phone, according to charging documents. They also found a prior police incident of a domestic-violence-related 
"involvement" between Ardila-Urrego and Lai in Florida, linking the FBI to information about Lai's car, prosecutors 
said. Ardila-Urrego, Lai, and the kidnapped 7-month-old were all in the car, and the Florida couple were 
arrested. The baby was returned home. Bail for Ardila-Urrego and Lai was set at $750,000. USA TODAY (02/29, 
Arshani) also reported on the story.

The Associated Press (02/29, Staff Writer) reported that a man already serving a life sentence for the 2014 death of 
an Arizona teenager was convicted Thursday of first-degree murder in the killing of another Tucson girl years 
earlier. Pima County Superior Court jurors also found Christopher Clements, 42, guilty of kidnapping and burglary in 
the death of Isabel Celis, who was 6 when she vanished from her parents' home in 2012. According to the 
article, Clements became a suspect in Celis' death in 2017, when he told FBI agents that he could lead them to the 
girl's remains — but said he had nothing to do with her death — in exchange for having charges in an unrelated 
burglary case dropped, Tucson police said.
