DOJ of attempting to cover up an alleged quid pro quo to drop the corruption charges against Adams if he assisted 
the Trump administration in carrying out its immigration policies. According to the article, in their letter to the DOJ, 
Raskin and Crockett said the department "has strayed far from its principles of equal justice under the law by 
dismissing a serious criminal public corruption matter in exchange for assistance with the White House's 
immigration priorities." The lawmakers have requested that the Dal turn over notes related to a Jan. 31 meeting 
between federal prosecutors and Adams' lawyers, and asked whether any of the documents have been destroyed. 
They also requested the White House and DOJ communications related to the investigation into Adams. The New 
York Times (03/03, Stack), and MSNBC (03/03, Rubin) also reported on the story. 
EPA Calls for Watchdog to Probe $20 Billion Climate Fund 
Politico (03/03, Colman) reported that Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin on Monday 
requested an inspector general probe of the management of a $20 billion climate fund held by Citibank that has 
become embroiled in the Trump administration's efforts to claw back Biden-era spending. The fund is at the center 
of a fight between the Trump administration and environmental groups seeking access to the funds that Congress 
approved under its massive climate legislation, the Inflation Reduction Act — and which Republicans are seeking to 
gut to help pay for trillions of dollars in tax cuts. According to the article, Zeldin wants the agency watchdog to 
investigate possible conflicts of interest, waste and fraud linked to the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. Zeldin has 
been increasingly vocal in television appearances that the program was rife with malfeasance, though he has not 
provided evidence of illegal activity or wrongdoing. The new administrator has homed in on the program after 
an undercover video recording released by a conservative group in December showed a person identified as an EPA 
adviser comparing the Biden administration's effort to spend climate money before Trump's inauguration to 
"throwing gold bars" off the Titanic. The article mentioned that in a statement, EPA said the Dal and FBI are 
conducting "concurrent investigations" of the fund, which is held at Citibank under an arrangement with the 
federal government. 
Suspect Shot, Killed During FBI Response in Northern Arizona 
Arizona's Family (03/03, Koch) reported that a suspect was shot and killed Monday morning as FBI agents served a 
warrant on the Hopi reservation in northern Arizona. The incident happened just before 7:30 a.m. when FBI agents 
executed the warrant in the Moenkopi village near Tuba City. The Navajo Police Department said a suspect pulled 
out a weapon on the agents, leading to the suspect being shot. FBI agents administered first aid before the suspect 
was taken to Tuba City Regional Health Care Corporation for treatment. According to the article, the suspect was 
later pronounced dead, according to FBI Phoenix. Police did not say what the warrant was for, and the suspect has 
not been identified. No agents or officers were injured in this shooting. The scene is now secured with FBI agents, 
and the FBI is monitoring the suspect at the hospital, according to police. The Arizona Republic (03/03, 
Bartunek), KNXV (ABC-15) (03/03, Staff Writer), Navajo-Hopi Observer (03/03, Staff Writer), KAAF News (03/03, 
Zorn), KSAZ (Fox-10) (03/03, Wong), KTAR News (03/03, Stone), and KPNX (NBC-12) (03/03, Reagan) also reported

FBI Agent Testifies at Feeding Our Future Trial 
The Minnesota Star-Tribune (03/03, Meitrodt) reported that Aimee Bock compared her nonprofit, Feeding Our 
Future, to the "mob" in text messages to her business associates and continued to pay fraudulent food distribution 
operators even when her employees raised questions about their legitimacy, an FBI agent testified Monday. 
According to the article, as the federal trial of Bock and co-defendant Salim Said entered the fifth week, FBI agent 
Travis Wilmer took the witness stand to testify about the agency's investigation into the massive $250 million fraud 
scheme centered around federally funded programs to feed low-income kids during the summer and after 
school. Wilmer said Bock's associates began informing her of their concerns in early 2021, but instead of 
conducting an internal investigation, Bock took steps to shut up her critics. The article stated that Feeding Our 
Future went from receiving about $3 million in federal funds in 2019 to nearly $200 million in 2021. Prosecutors 
have alleged throughout the case that meal counts were grossly inflated with fake attendance rosters and invoices 
to rake in millions of dollars from the U.S. Department of Agriculture programs, which participants used to buy 
luxury cars and houses, not feed kids. Several former food site operators who have pleaded guilty in the case have 
also testified about kickbacks and bribes between associates in the pay-to-play scheme. MPR News (03/03, Sepic), 
and KMSP (Fox-9) (03/03, Olson) also reported on the story.
