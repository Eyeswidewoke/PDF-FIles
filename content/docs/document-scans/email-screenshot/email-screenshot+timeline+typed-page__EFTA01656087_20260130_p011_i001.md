car from the 1970s. The FBI said they were looking for a Ford Thunderbird or Lincoln Mark IV in connection with 
Degree's disappearance. The article noted that last week, several search scenes around Cleveland County and 
beyond stirred the community with curiosity and hope. Evidence collected included an older green vehicle similar 
in appearance to the one wanted in connection with Degree's disappearance. Days later, investigators confirmed 
the scenes were related to Asha's case and that new evidence pointed to her being a "victim of homicide," with her 
death concealed. While it is not the break in the case many were hoping to hear, it is a break that, Shaffer hopes, is 
the start of more answers for the Degree family. The Independent (09/18, Del Rey) also reported on the story.

FINANCIAL CRIME & CORPORATE SCANDALS 
SEC Settles Insider Trading Case Tied to Theft From Law Firm 
Reuters (09/18, Thomas) reported that the cousin of an FBI trainee who illegally obtained information about a 
planned Merck & Co acquisition from U.S. law firm Covington & Burling has agreed to pay nearly $33,000 to 
settle civil insider trading charges brought by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The article added that 
the SEC on Wednesday entered a consent judgment against Philip Markin, who was accused of making more than 
$16,000 trading illegally on shares of Pandion Therapeutics after receiving information stolen by his cousin Seth, a 
former FBI agent-in-training. The article mentioned that Seth Markin pleaded guilty last year after prosecutors said 
he stole information about Merck's then-pending $1.85 billion acquisition of Pandion from his girlfriend at the 
time, a law firm associate at Covington who was working on the Merck deal at home due to the COVID-19 
pandemic. Seth Markin then tipped off others about the deal, including his cousin Philip, the SEC alleged. Seth 
Markin pleaded guilty to related criminal charges last year. The SEC also brought civil complaints against Seth 
Markin and two others who allegedly traded on Pandion stock, all of which have resulted in consent judgments 
against them.

Hackers Demand $6 Million for Files Stolen From Seattle Airport Operator in Cyberattack 
The Associated Press (09/18, Staff Writer) reported that hackers are demanding $6 million in bitcoin from the 
operator of the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport for documents they stole during a cyberattack last month and 
posted on the dark web this week, an airport official said Wednesday. The article added that the Port of Seattle, 
which owns and runs the airport, has decided not to pay, the official said. The airport previously linked the attack 
to a ransomware gang called Rhysida, and now the FBI is conducting a criminal investigation, said Lance Lyttle, the 
port's managing director of aviation. Lyttle told a U.S. Senate committee that the airport appears to have stopped 
the attack, but the hackers were able to encrypt some data. The article mentioned that port officials have said 
paying the ransomware would not be a good use of taxpayer money. The airport is still recovering from the attack, 
which began Aug. 24. The attack was launched at a busy time, a week before the Labor Day holiday weekend. The 
Seattle Times (09/18, Takahama) also reported on the story. 
CISA, FBI Issue Alert on Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerabilities 
ExecutiveGov (09/18, Petersen) reported that the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and the FBI 
have released a Secure by Design Alert concerning cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, or XSS. CISA said Tuesday that 
XSS can be prevented and ought not to be present in software products, yet they continue to appear, providing 
threat actors with exploit opportunities. The article added that according to the alert, XSS can be brought about by 
the failure of a software maker to properly escape, validate or sanitize inputs, making it possible for threat actors to 
inject malicious scripts into web applications. The alert calls on leaders at technology manufacturers to instruct 
personnel to conduct a review of such deficiencies and develop a strategic plan to prevent them moving forward. 
The alert also recommends that technology manufacturers review the principles of secure by design software as 
outlined in a previous guidance.
