Custody. 
The Washington Post (9/30, Marimow, 14.2M) reports the Administration "will no longer block 
immigrant teens in federal custody from accessing abortion services, according to an

Malinowski Faces QAnon Death Threats Following False Republican Ad. 
The New York Times (9/30, Edmondson, 18.61M) reports Rep. Tom Malinowski (D-N3) is 
receiving "death threats from QAnon supporters after the House Republicans' campaign arm 
falsely accused him of lobbying to protect sexual predators." QAnon supporters targeted the 
lawmakers "on Tuesday, after he led a bipartisan resolution condemning the movement, which 
spreads a baseless conspiracy theory that President Trump is battling a cabal of Democratic 
pedophiles. QAnon believers seized on an advertisement released last month by the campaign 
arm, the National Republican Congressional Committee, that falsely claimed that Mr. 
Malinowski, then a lobbyist for Human Rights Watch, worked to block a provision in a 2006 
crime bill that would have expanded registration requirements for sex offenders."

vote in the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee sets up a full floor vote as 
early as next week. 
CQ Roll Call (9/30, Misra, 154K) reports that at his confirmation hearing last week, Wolf 
"faced pushback from committee Democrats for his role in implementing controversial 
immigration policies and over clashes between federal law enforcement agents and people 
protesting police brutality."
