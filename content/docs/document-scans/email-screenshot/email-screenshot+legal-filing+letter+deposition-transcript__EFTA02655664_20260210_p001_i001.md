you've agreed that 
Your office is a multi billion dollar responsibility. your children will inherit it , in order to oversee their financial lives- I 
feel =or you, truly ,but the facts are the facts, your ceo ( Brad) has provi=ed one bad document after another for over 
a year, no getting away from it„ =C2 bad cash flows no new IT, each time with " its gettting better " no in fact -! its 
=ot. - the excuse, that Brad is not the numbers guy, is ludicrous. of course he=20 didnt actually prepare the 
statements. - no ceo would ,-=but over and over he presented them to you and me , after , holding them back=20 for 
his personal review multiple times and after multiple drafts. weeks of his editing,=C2 the consistant but "inexplicable 
"missing the obvious serious errors . ( gaming ) inaccuracies, = cashflow ► and mistakes (tax returns). why, ?! the 
simple answer i= that at best, he is a c minus, (note. I, like you ,also give points for effort. )- ! a= elegant art 
partnership gone fallow. ??!!I and its core reason =o exist. not used ? no docs for plane?, still ! why?=no docs for 
decantings why? the docs for deal 1 received last night , "= no docs at all for deal 2, the biggest " . why wasn't Tom 
brought in , =C2 after 4 times of my incessant reminders i spoke to him , he knows little of either tran=action except 
for over view. never saw pahidon anything except=projections until yesterday ? ?and this after your =clear 
admonition etc. re the trading accounts no activity, at all, =C2 
Barry Cohen is great. more like him please .= 
you asked , - 
I did my best trying to train your brad chosen people in the face of my telling you that they were never 
going to be more than c-minuses, thousands of emails thousands=? 
Brad at its head . you can't as a ceo,=have an 
accountant give you multiple pages with the most important numbers missing altogether=20 and not notice, you and I 
saw the errrors right away ,as did my very junior=20 bookeeper after only a cursory glance. He told me he didnt know 
the=20 details of his note? ! , my guess is that he wanted to pay less. no=20 more than that, any other story is blather. 
its silly.=C2 Talk to richard yourself. 
re your estate. Yes another Brad is=ue - your will, needs revision. the tenants in common structure I as=ume Alan has 
carefully walked you through. it is way overdue, needed and exciting. I won't list the more serious issues in an e=ail 
but we can speak over the weekend. 
How can I help?= We agreed at the time when you hired Castrucci , that when you fired him= I would bear no 
responsibility because it was clear that he shouldnt be hired. brad and you both said ," its on us", but... =C2 the 
equivalent of your art consultant pointing to a picasso and calling it a renoir. then a brancusi and calling it a 
michaelangelo.=C2 those were the types of erros that i saw immediatily, you said give =hem more time. at least they 
saw it was a painting and not a photo? =AO
