just hope to God he has the decency in him to man-up and say, you know what? We fought 
hard, we lost the election, good luck to Joe Biden, I love America." 
In addition, The Hill (11/15, Budryk, 2.98M) reports that as the President continues to 
refuse to concede, "Republican governors and officials called on the Trump administration to 
begin the transition process." On CNN's "State of the Union" on Sunday, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine 
(R) said, "It's clear that, certainly, based on what we know now, that Joe Biden is the president-
elect and that transition, for the country's sake, it's important for a normal transition to start 
through." DeWine added, "The president can go on his other track and his legal track. We 
should respect that, but we also need to begin that process." The Hill (11/15, Rahman, 2.98M) 
also reports DeWine said, "I was certainly a supporter of and remain a supporter of the 
president, but the president has every right to go into court, every right to bring any kind of 
evidence that he has and no one should begrudge him that or say that there's anything 
irregular about that." 
The Hill (11/15, Budryk, 2.98M) reports Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson (R) on Sunday 
"echoed some Republican senators' calls for Biden to begin receiving briefing materials during 
the transition period." On NBC's Meet The PressVi (11/15, 2.85M), Hutchinson said, "I expect 
Joe Biden to be the next President of the United States. It was good actually to see President 
Trump tweet out that he won. I think that's the start of an acknowledgment, and it is very 
important that Joe Biden have access to the intelligence briefings to make sure that he is 
prepared during times of transition: our enemies have an opportunity to try to take advantage 
of us. We want to make sure that there is a smooth transition, particularly when it comes to the 
vaccine distribution, that everybody understands what we're doing there and what the plan is 
for the future." 
TV Networks Discuss Reforms For Election Night Coverage. The Washington Post 
(11/14, Farhi, 14.2M) says the "piecemeal reporting" on the TV networks "created a whipsaw 
effect on election night and for several days thereafter, as officials whittled down a historic 
number of mail-in ballots," yet the question is "was the whipsaw necessary?" According to the 
Post, "News organizations knew weeks beforehand that the pandemic had created an 
unprecedented demand for mail-in voting - and that such ballots were favored by Democrats, a 
dynamic geared to shift the count dramatically depending on when they were counted." 
However, the Post adds the networks "say they told viewers that early results could give a 
distorted picture of the race," and "there is little appetite, among either state officials or 
journalists, for ending the traditional system of reporting incomplete results as they trickle in -
no matter how misleading they may be." 
NYTimes Analysis: No Mandate From Election, But Rather "Muddled Plea To Move 
On From Trump-Style Chaos." In a more than 3,100-word analysis headlined "With Trench 
Warfare Deepening, Parties Face Unsettled Electoral Map," the New York Times (11/15, Burns, 
18.61M) asserts that as Biden "prepares to take office and preside over a closely divided 
government, leaders in both camps are acknowledging that voters seem to have issued not a 
mandate for the left or the right but a muddled plea to move on from Trump-style chaos." The 
Times adds that "on the electoral landscape, both parties find themselves stretched thin and 
battling on new fronts, with their traditional strongholds increasingly under siege. Indeed, 
Democrats and Republicans are facing perhaps the most unsettled and up-for-grabs electoral 
map the country has seen in a generation, since the parties were still fighting over California in 
the late 1980s." 
US Adds Another Million Coronavirus Cases In Under A Week. 
The Washington Post (11/15, Al, Firozi, 14.2M) says coronavirus cases "reported in the United 
States passed 11 million on Sunday, as the nation shatters records for hospitalizations and daily 
new infections and as leaders turn to new, painful restrictions to stem the pandemic's long-
predicted surge." According to the Post, "The milestone came one week after the country hit 10
