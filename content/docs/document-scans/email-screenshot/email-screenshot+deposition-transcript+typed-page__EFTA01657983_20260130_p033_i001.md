investigate any complaints of anti-Christian bias Ms. Corrigan has raised during her tenure at 
the Agency." 
To Politico (8/3, Lippman, 4.29M), Corrigan "is leaving the agency after a short and 
tumultuous tenure marred by calls for her removal over controversial comments she had made 
on LGBT rights, according to two USAID officials and another person familiar with the matter." 
Her tweets Monday were "unusual even for an administration that has been marked by constant 
personnel shakeups and palace intrigue." Politico adds "a Trump administration official said 
USAID's acting administrator, John Barsa, fired Corrigan on Monday after she began posting her 
tweets." 
The New York Post (8/3, Nelson, 4.57M) reports the President "rarely mentions gay rights, 
but posed with a rainbow flag as a candidate in 2016 and nominated gay judges as president. 
This year, Trump hailed [Richard] Grenell, then acting intelligence chief, as the 'first openly gay 
cabinet secretary' and told fellow officials at a meeting 'it's a big deal." Moreover, "White House 
adviser Kellyanne Conway said last year that Trump was 'the first president to start as president 
approving of gay marriage" and last year Trump celebrated LGBT pride month with a tweet that 
condemned "dozens of countries worldwide that punish, imprison, or even execute individuals 
on the basis of their sexual orientation." 
House Panel Subpoenas Pompeo Aides Over IG's Firing. 
The AP (8/3, Jalonick) reports that on Monday, House Democrats "subpoenaed four top aides to 
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, saying that the Trump administration is stonewalling their 
investigation into the firing of the State Department's top independent watchdog earlier this 
year." Former State Department Inspector General Steve Linick "appeared for a closed-door 
interview in the probe in June and told investigators that top department officials tried to bully 
him and dissuade his office from conducting a review of a multibillion-dollar arms sale to Saudi 
Arabia before he was fired." According to the AP, Linick "also said he was looking into previously 
reported allegations that...Pompeo and his wife may have misused government staff to run 
personal errands and several other matters." 
Politico (8/3, Cheney, 4.29M) reports that House Foreign Affairs Chairman Eliot Engel 
"issued the subpoenas Monday to Brian Bulatao, the undersecretary of State for management 
and a longtime Pompeo associate, as well as Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Mike Miller, 
former Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Marik String and senior adviser Toni Porter. 'The 
Administration continues to cover up the real reasons for Mr. Linick's firing by stonewalling the 
Committees' investigation and refusing to engage in good faith," Engel, House Oversight 
Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney, and Senate Foreign Affairs Committee ranking member Sen. Bob 
Menendez (D-NJ) "said in a joint statement. 'That stonewalling has made today's subpoenas 
necessary." Reuters (8/3, Zengerle) reports that "the three panels are looking into the May 15 
firing of Linick, one of a series of federal government watchdogs fired by Trump." Reuters (8/3, 
Zengerle) and the Washington Free Beacon (8/3, Beyrer, 78K), among other news outlets, also 
report the story. 
Democrats Object To Tata's Pentagon Appointment. 
The AP (8/3, Baldor) reports Democrats are "condemning" President Trump's appointment of 
retired Brig. Gen. Anthony Tata "to a senior Pentagon job after it became clear that getting the 
retired general confirmed to a higher post would be difficult if not impossible." Trump appointed 
Tata "to a job performing the duties of the deputy undersecretary for defense policy" after a 
Senate panel "canceled a hearing on Tata's nomination to become defense undersecretary for 
policy, the third-highest civilian post at the Pentagon." Sen. Jack Reed (D-RI), the ranking 
member on the Senate Armed Services Committee, "said Tata was on the verge of being 
rejected by the panel, and 'until the issues raised by senators of both parties can be resolved, 
Gen. Tata should not be serving in a position in the Defense Department:"
