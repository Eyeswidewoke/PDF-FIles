China's Spying Efforts Growing, With U.S. A Top Target 
CBS News (05/18, O'Donnell, Sharman, et al.) reported that China's spying efforts, led by the Ministry of State Security (MSS), have increased significantly 
since President Xi limping came to power in 2012, with the U.S. being a top target. According to the article, the MSS has a large network of covert agents 
worldwide, including in the U.S., to monitor and influence events, and has been known to surveil and intimidate Chinese dissidents living in the U.S. The 
article noted that over 140 people have been indicted in the U.S. for felonies related to harassment, hacking, and spying for China in the last five years, 
including Shujun Wang, a retired historian who was convicted of acting as an unregistered foreign agent of China. The article highlighted that in 2021, an 
undercover FBI agent posing as an operative from the Ministry of State Security showed up at Wang's door, offering to help delete communications from 
his computer that might incriminate him, should the U.S. try to prosecute him. Video from the encounter showed Wang welcomed the man's help. 
Additional reporting from CBS News (05/18, O'Donnell) explained that, according to the FBI, Beijing opened an overseas Chinese police station right in 
the middle of New York City. It was discovered in 2022, hidden among businesses in a commercial building in Manhattan's Chinatown. While Chinese 
expats could renew government documents there, like driver's licenses, federal prosecutors said the main purpose of the outpost was to target and 
harass Chinese dissidents.
