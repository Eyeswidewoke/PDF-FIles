The AP (7/30, Taylor, Mascaro) says Friday's expiration of the $600 benefit "sent 
Republicans controlling the Senate scrambling to respond." Senate Majority Leader McConnell 
"made a procedural move to make it easier to reach a potential compromise next week that 
would extend the bonus unemployment benefit while talks on a broader COVID-19 relief 
measure grind on. But ahead of late-night talks at the Capitol, the outlook dimmed." The Hill 
(7/30, Carney, 2.98M) quotes McConnell as saying on the Senate floor, "We've had enough rope 
a dope. We've had enough empty talk. It's time to go on the record." 
The Washington Times (7/30, Swoyer, Munoz, 492K) says McConnell "explained that the 
'shell' bill would be amendable, giving lawmakers more time over the weekend to continue 
negotiations." However, Senate Minority Leader Schumer called the move a "stunt." The 
Washington Examiner (7/30, Ferrechio, 448K) reports that Schumer "accused Republicans of 
failing to negotiate adequately on a larger spending deal." Schumer said, "Unemployment is a 
crisis. ... There are many crises. All of your constituents are saying why can't we open our 
schools safely? They need dollars. We can't negotiate that proposal." Mary Bruce said on ABC 
World News TonigISVI (7/30, story 5, 0:50, Muir, 7.06M), "Bottom line, even if the two sides 
can reach an agreement here, it looks like it is going to take weeks, potentially, taking a huge 
toll on millions of Americans and the economy." 
The Washington Post (7/30, Kim, Werner, Stein, 14.2M) reports that on Wednesday, 
President Trump "urged Congress to quickly approve some extension in unemployment benefits 
and a federal eviction moratorium that expired last week." On Thursday, Chief of Staff Meadows 
"told reporters Trump would support a one-week extension of unemployment benefits at $600." 
A New York Times (7/30, 18.61M) editorial laments "lack of action on Capitol Hill" on 
coronavirus relief and calls on lawmakers "to extend the emergency aid programs that were 
created in March to help Americans endure a broad suspension of economic activity." The Times 
argues that this "abject failure to act is not the fault of Congress in a collective sense. ... 
Responsibility for the current debacle rests specifically and squarely on the shoulders of 
[McConnell] and the other 52 Senate Republicans." 
Kimberley Strassel writes in the Wall Street Journal (7/30, Subscription Publication, 
7.57M) that Republicans realized this week that Democrats do not want a bill, they want an 
issue that will help them win the election. Strassel lauds McConnell's plan to hold a vote on a 
plan to extend the unemployment benefit at $200, which will make Democrats go on the record 
opposing it and force them to explain why. Strassell argues Republicans will lose an election 
over which part can spend more and should instead use it as an opportunity to highlight their 
competing vision. 
Liability Protection For Businesses Proving To Be A Sticking Point. The 
Washington Times (7/30, Swoyer, 492K) reports that Senate Republicans hope to prevent "a 
flood of coronavirus lawsuits" by "granting liability protection to businesses as part of the next 
round of coronavirus relief." But, liability protection, which is "a top priority" for McConnell, 
"also is a chief sticking point in negotiating the $1 trillion-plus package." While McConnell 
"vowed not to bring to the floor any relief package without liability protection," Democrats, 
"who usually side with trial lawyers, say the Republican plan goes too far and is a giveaway to 
big business at the expense of consumer protection." 
Trump, DeVos Reiterate Call For Schools To Reopen. 
Ben Tracy briefly reported on the CBS Evening NewsVi (7/30, story 5, 0:30, O'Donnell, 4.19M), 
"Despite questioning the safety of holding an election during coronavirus, the President 
continues to push for schools to reopen, saying there isn't much risk to children." Trump: "The 
younger the better. Amazing. The immune system. But children, the lower they are in age, the 
lower the risk." On NBC Nightly NewsVi (7/30, story 4, 0:15, Holt, 5.82M), Peter Alexander 
said, "Trump was pressed whether he can assure people that schools will be safe if they reopen, 
something he has been pushing for for weeks. The President did not convey confidence, 
responding with a question, saying, 'Can you assure anybody of anything?'"
