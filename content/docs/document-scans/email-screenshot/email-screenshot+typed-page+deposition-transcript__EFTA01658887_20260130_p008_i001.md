NYC Pilot Program Will See Dispatchers Send Mental Health Units To Respond To 
Mental Health Calls Instead Of Police. 
Bloomberg (11/13, Akinnibi, 4.73M) reports that New York City "plans to test out a program 
where dispatchers send out emergency medical services and mental health crisis workers, 
instead of police officers, to mental health-related calls, making it the latest city to attempt a 
pivot away from policing as a cure-all." Bloomberg adds, "The city's mental health teams will 
work in two high-need communities starting in February." The teams are going to respond 
instead of the conventional "police and paramedic teams, except in cases that involve a weapon 
or imminent danger, according to a statement from Mayor Bill de Blasio's office this week." 
Louisville Family Still Getting Harassed By Neighbor Who Allegedly Painted Racist 
Message On Their Driveway. 
The Washington Post (11/13, Salcedo, 14.2M) says that in June, Connie and Michella Pineda 
went outside their Louisville home and discovered "a bright orange swastika and a racist 
message spray-painted on their driveway." Upon checking a security camera, the Pinedas, "who 
are Latina and Filipina, respectively," discovered "they knew the attacker, they later told police," 
with the perpetrator being their neighbor. That individual, Suzanne Craft, in July "was charged 
with criminal mischief and later sentenced to seven days of jail and house arrest for violating a 
no-contact order with the couple, as reported by the Louisville Courier-Journal." Now, however, 
the Pinedas indicate that "they suspect Craft is still targeting them and their five children with 
racist harassment." The Post says it was told by the Pineda's attorney that their security 
cameras during recent weeks captured Craft putting "cat litter in their fountain and" leaving 
"what appeared to be a bag of threatening letters on their lawn."
