FBI Shares Tips With Farmers on How to Protect Agriculture Infrastructure 
WOWT (NBC-6) (08/12, Cade) reported that members of the FBI met Omaha, sharing tips to protect critical 
infrastructure, like agriculture, from threats that can come from technology. The President of the Nebraska Farm 
Bureau says the industry throughout the heartland generates around $100 billion each year. An FBI spokesperson 
says they are working to protect the ag industry from four major threats: business operations stopping, data 
technology theft, malware making its way onto farming equipment, and any threats from bioterrorism. The article 
quoted Special Agent in Charge Gene Kowel, who said, "Basic cyber hygiene, multifactor authentication, air gap 
backups of your most critical data, the greater degree that our farmers, our producers, our ranchers are aware of 
this, are cognizant of what the risk is and are willing to come to law enforcement to report it, the greater degree we 
can protect the entire industry." Nebraska Public Media (08/12, Beach), and KEN (ABC-7) (08/12, Messel) also 
reported on the story. 
Director Wray Names FBI Special Agent in Charge for OKC 
The Journal Record (08/12, Staff Writer) reported that Director Wray has appointed Douglas M. Goodwater as the 
new special agent in charge of the FBI's Oklahoma City Field Office. Goodwater, a seasoned FBI veteran, most 
recently served as a section chief in the Office of Public Affairs at FBI Headquarters in Washington, D.C., where he 
oversaw the National Press Office and the Community Relations Unit. The article stated that Goodwater began his 
FBI career in 2007 as a special agent in the Oklahoma City Field Office, investigating gangs and drug trafficking 
organizations as part of the Safe Streets Task Force. 
FBI to Host Teen Academy in West Virginia 
WDTV (CBS-5) (08/12, Staff Writer) reported that the FBI Criminal Justice Information Services Division in 
Clarksburg has opened applications for the 2024 CJIS Division FBI Teen Academy. The opportunity is open to 
students who will be in 11th and 12th grade during the 2024-2025 school year. The article stated that the program 
aims to bring a diverse set of students together to develop leadership skills and explore various career options. It 
offers a comprehensive look into today's FBI. Students are provided with several presentations on topics including 
terrorism, cybercrime, public corruption, polygraph exams, evidence response, SWAT and the day-to-day 
operations of a typical FBI office. Students also learn from special agents, intelligence analysts, language specialists, 
and professional staff about investigative tactics that include gathering evidence, interviewing witnesses and 
assisting with cases. 
DC Church Wrestles With FBI Connection 
UM News (08/12, Patterson) reported that in 1966, Capitol Hill Methodist Church in Washington hung a plaque to 
dedicate a large, beautiful stained-glass window of Jesus to J. Edgar Hoover, who ran the FBI from 1924 to 1972. 
The article stated that the church's parking lot is the former site of Hoover's home from childhood until he was 43 
years old. After much discussion, the church will rededicate the window at a ceremony on Sept. 29, and the old 
plaque will be displayed elsewhere in the church, along with an explanation of the circumstances. The article 
quoted Rev. Stephanie Vader, who said, "The plaque signals to me that you agree that J. Edgar Hoover is a good 
model for Christian virtues, because otherwise, why would you have it up there?" The article added that the 
congregation plans to address the situation, and hopefully reconcile it, with a Sept. 29 rededication ceremony for 
the window to distance it from Hoover. The original plaque will be moved elsewhere in the church, along with an 
explanation of the circumstances. The article quoted Lerone A. Martin, a professor at Stanford University and 
author of "The Gospel of J. Edgar Hoover: How the FBI Aided and Abetted the Rise of White Christian Nationalism.", 
who said, "The FBI was spying on student groups and women's groups and civil rights groups — and not for crimes 
committed or alleged crimes, but really for their political beliefs." 
Data Gaps Allow Campaigns to 'Pick and Choose' Their Own Crime Story: Criminologist 
The Epoch Times (08/12, Haughey) reported that crime is a standard election issue, but rarely have parties and 
candidates offered such starkly polar narratives about public safety than in 2024 campaigns, criminal justice 
experts say. That's not surprising when local and state law enforcement agencies define, collect, and report crime 
data differently, and at different times, leading to incomplete statistics that allow candidates to "pick and choose 
what story to tell," maintains professor Alex Piquero, sociology and criminology chair at the University of Miami.
