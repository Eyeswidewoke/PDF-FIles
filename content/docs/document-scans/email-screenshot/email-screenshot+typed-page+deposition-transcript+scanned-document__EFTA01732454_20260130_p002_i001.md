responsible and standing behind my ow= personal work ( ie the word DONE will no longer be =ransmitted to reflect 
status stated by others ) 
=AO With no commitment on my part whatsoever, to do it. So far =s I have failed in my attempt in trying to think 
t=rough the problem creatively . My organizations handling of the more complex issues I believe you=might find very 
costly, very ! ( however many structures=available some risk sharing, maybe risk caps ,etc ) but would <=pan 
style="color:rgb(255,0,0)">require my teams doing the work =AO , not yours. Ada should be only a trust, grat 
adm=nistrator. not sure what role you prefer for Eileen as you hir=d her initially to oversee investments. whether Rich 
your cont=oller stays or not, is not urgent. having Tom report to a new =erson,- is. coordination with Suydam Kathy 
Gre=ory, I would suggest limiting to one person. The increasing public p=ofile needs to be taken into consideration. 
talk lat=r..c 
TODAY 
With your consent ., Eil=en did not report to Delson ( he acting as conduit directl= to me), she continued to provide 
bad info to both you ( cashflows , stock accts, structures. sales Etc) and me. and e=ch time with my many annoying 
calls to you that she was g 
y !! N= one was hired to run YOUR office until two months ago , no one was even 
i=terviewed and even now, Brad is not full time,(crazy )=Hours upon hours of time need to be spent training him . and 
new staff. =C2 Eileen followed your instructions. not mine. in fact she conti=ued to ignore mine saying " but Leon " its 
on" L=ons desk" , You would become frustrated when i poin=ed out each instance. of her obfuscation. you were given 
the clear=C2 choice but to save money you chose not to hire my team . I was=hired to do the architecture, you kept 
your own team. with Eile=n at the head. instructions were given by me, detailed =ut ignored by your people. ( except 
in the instances where I inserted myse=f and personally had to do weeks of grunt work ),ex. =AO jpm morgan acct still 
not in use? that being said =f you do the cold calculation starting from where you we=e, to where you are currently . 
you made a hell of a deal. =AO -- negotiating down my original amount requested , calling=C2 upon our friendship and 
suggesting that the Carlyn m=ss was partially my fault. ( though in that specific example ,=I had never been asked to do 
more than provide you the name of the m=st highly recognized atty in the field, not co=sulted,or asked again for 
guidance along the way. =). I accepted the discount as your friend. ( suggesting=now, that Tom is now that last word 
on tax characterization, frankly is a =it much,-). however - that is all in the past. 
=C2 
In order to move forward 
I would ask tha= you realize that unlike yours, My business is only comprised =f my personal attention and my 
personal time . time that=l was forced to grossly overspend on your issues last year. . =s you are my very close friend 
I will not have you participate in a =idding process that I will have this year for my time . =hopefully a more fair way ) I 
would also ask that you keep in mind =hat though our deal expired months ago. (even apart from the f=ct that your 
understanding of the final terms neither reflected the =mails or my memory, we finished it up your way. ) I have 
answered ev=ry call brad , joslin, Ada or you, have made . revie=ed docs over and over/ until once again, I was forced 
to =C2 insert myself strongly as I thought it dangerous not to. l=made serious dollar and time concessions last year.very 
serious I a= wiling to continue to accommodate some of your concerns , but =1 am under no circumstances , none, 
willing to spend my time for fre=. its not fair. After cleaning up Carlyn's mess , which was a few week= and 30 million 
dollars . We were both highly aware of t=e dire circumstances in which you found yourself last year, and in fact du= 
predominately to its seriousness. and those very circumstance= I took extra care in our negotiations . (you had claimed 
I had you =ver a barrel , ( a horrible position to be in with my very close friend.),=unfortunately I fear that if you are not 
very careful ,in the near future,=another barrel will appear of your own design ) 
=A0I heard you when you said you believed i had already been paid for the w=rk that is now required. You will recall 
that you required that my payment= be at the end of my work not at the beginning as everyone else. I eventua=ly 
agreed, this of course should make clear that t=e 2014 tax year that will close Oct 2015 is not covered at all= I 
pointed this very fact out to you when I initially proposed a multi yea= agreement right out of the box. you said you 
preferred not. A= you said ,I have produced results to date, far in e=cess of even my own exalted opinion of my 
projections. I have devoted a monumental amount of my limited amount of time-- way, way in excess of =ur agreement. 
I will be fair, I am willing to roll in the amo=nt still outstanding from last year if that helps .. However, =s my best 
student , and my only one, you are now capable=of doing most not all of the required work yourself. I c=n put my 
whiteboard away when you come to eat and just have fun, trade sto=ies,. share moments ideas etc. . lam of course
