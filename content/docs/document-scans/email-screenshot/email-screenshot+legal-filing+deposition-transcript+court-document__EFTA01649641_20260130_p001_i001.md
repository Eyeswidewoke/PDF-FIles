Epstein 'Client List' Doesn't Exist, Justice Department Says, Walking Back Theory AG Bondi Had Promoted 
The Associated Press (07/07, Tucker, Richer) reported that the DOJ has stated that Jeffrey Epstein did not maintain a "client list" of individuals to 
whom underage girls were trafficked. Attorney General Pam Bondi had previously suggested that such a document existed and was being 
reviewed, but the department has now walked back this claim. After the first release of Epstein documents in February, AG Bondi stated that 
officials were poring over a "truckload" of previously withheld evidence she said had been handed over by the FBI. In a March TV Interview, she 
claimed the Biden administration "sat on these documents, no one did anything with them," adding: "Sadly these people don't believe in 
transparency, but I think more unfortunately, I think a lot of them don't believe in honesty" The article noted that the DOJ will not release any 
further files related to Epstein's sex trafficking investigation, citing the need to protect victims and prevent the spread of unfounded theories. The 
article highlighted that Director Patel and Deputy Director Bongino recently insisted in television and podcast interviews that the evidence was 
clear that Epstein had killed himself. The Washington Post (07/07, Stein) noted that the White House on Monday defended AG Bondi's handling of 
the Epstein investigation. The White House and the Justice Department said AG Bondi was not referring to a client list in the Fox News interview 
but rather to the entire investigatory file, which could include private Jet flight logs and people associated with Epstein. "Yes, she was saying the 
entirety of all of the paperwork, all of the paper in relation to Jeffrey Epstein's crimes. That's what the attorney general was referring to. And I'll 
let her speak for that," White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Monday. The Justice Department "committed to an exhaustive 
Investigation; she added. "That's what they did, and they provided the results of that That's transparency" Fox News (07/07, Oliver) detailed that 
when asked for comment, a DOJ spokesperson pointed to Leavitt's remarks and said the Trump administration has been more transparent than 
its predecessor. "We've delivered more transparency in 6 months than the Biden administration did in 4 years,' the spokesperson told Fox News 
Digital. The Wall Street Journal (07/07, Gurman) added that DOJ spokesman Chad Gilmartin said Monday that AG Bondi was referring to the 
Epstein files more broadly during the Fox interview, namely the flight manifests and address book that were included in the first release. The FBI 
referred other questions to the justice Department, which referred them to the White House. The New York Post (07/07, King) pointed out that 
tech billionaire Elon Musk launched into a meme•based social media tirade early Monday over the Justice Departments reported conclusion that 
notorious sex predator Jeffrey Epstein's much•hyped client list doesn't actually exist. Through a flurry of memes and terse replies to various users, 
Musk, 54, insinuated that the federal government was protecting the late pedophile's associates and threw shade at AG Bondi. This Is the final 
straw," the world's richest man ominously replied to a post from user "Autism Capital" who alluded to AG Bondi's claims in February that she had 
the client list "sitting on my desk right now to reviewr Additional reporting on the story was provided by ABC News (07/07, Faulders, Hill,
