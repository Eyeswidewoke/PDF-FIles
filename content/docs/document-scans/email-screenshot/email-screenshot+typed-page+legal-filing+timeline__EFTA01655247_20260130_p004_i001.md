Rodriguez said it was unclear if the injury was from shrapnel or a bullet. Police say Mosqueda was linked to a 
Michigan address, but was reported missing from a Weslaco, Texas, address around 4 a.m. Monday. The exact 
details of the missing person report were not immediately shared with the media. Rodriguez said there is no 
ongoing threat to the public, but it is unknown if any other people were involved in the attack. He said the motive 
and events leading up to the attack are part of the ongoing investigation, which the FBI is taking the lead on. NBC 
News (07/07, Alsharif, Strickler, et al.) clarified that according to the OHS, the suspect opened fire at the entrance 
of the federal government building, and Border Patrol agents and local police "helped neutralize the shooter." A 
Border Patrol employee and two officers were injured, DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said, adding that one 
of them was shot in the knee. All were taken to a hospital. Fox News (07/07, Pinedo) revealed that in a statement 
emailed to the outlet, a spokesperson for FBI San Antonio said that McAllen police received calls of shots being 
heard by a local Border Patrol facility near the McAllen International Airport at approximately 5:53 a.m. The 
spokesperson said the armed suspect, who they did not identify as Mosqueda but rather an "adult male," "engaged 
the law enforcement officers responding to the scene and officers returned fire." The FBI representative said there 
is "currently no threat to public safety that we are aware of" and that the investigation is ongoing. Additional

FBI Agent Accused Of Raping Clients In His Tattoo Parlor Goes On Trial 
The Washington Post (07/07, Morse) reported that on a witness stand three years ago, FBI agent Eduardo Valdivia's 
testimony hit home with jurors. Yes, he shot an unarmed panhandler while commuting to work aboard a moving 
Metro train. But it was an act of self-defense and not attempted murder, Valdivia said, because the man had 
backed him into a corner and was a threat to take his gun. The agent was acquitted on all counts and resumed 
active duty. On Monday, Valdivia returns to the same courthouse in Montgomery County, Maryland, for an entirely 
new case. Prosecutors say the 41-year-old raped three women — one who had just turned 18 — inside an off-hours 
tattoo operation he quietly ran under the alias "Lalo Brown." Valdivia lured them in with offers of free tattoos and 
possible modeling work, according to prosecutors, and video-recorded at least some of the assaults. His defense for 
this trial: Yes, he engaged in sexual activity with the three women, but everything was consensual. Jury selection is 
scheduled to start Monday and last two days, owing in part to concerns about finding impartial jurors given 
extensive media coverage, according to recent court filings. The trial itself is scheduled to last eight days. Valdivia, 
who has been jailed since his arrest last year and is currently suspended by the FBI, had recently worked on 
domestic terrorism cases from the FBI's Washington headquarters, Bonsib said. If convicted of all charges, including 
eight counts of second-degree rape, he could be sentenced to decades in prison. WTOP-FM (07/07, Augenstein) 
also reported on the story.

that the FBI is working alongside local and state law enforcement on this investigation. Additional reporting on the
