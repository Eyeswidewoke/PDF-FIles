Florida Schools Announce Remote Classes As DeSantis Says State Will Have In-Person 
Learning. 
Politico (7/29, Atterbury, 4.29M) reports that as Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) "insists" his state 
will have in-person learning this fall, Florida's largest school district will begin the year "with 
remote classes, joining others that are keeping campuses closed." Miami Dade County schools 
Superintendent Alberto Carvalho "announced the move Wednesday, a day after nearby Monroe 
County said it would rely on digital instruction for the immediate future." Schools in Broward 
and Palm Beach counties "also intend to start the school year with online courses." Nonetheless, 
DeSantis and state Education Commissioner Richard Corcoran "were unwavering in their 
confidence that brick-and-mortar schools will reopen their doors this fall." 
DHS Draws Judicial Rebuke Over False Statements In New York Travel Case. 
Politico New York (7/29, Durkin) reports US District Judge Jesse Furman "rebuked the 
Department of Homeland Security for making statements it has admitted were false in seeking 
to ban New York state from travel programs." But last week, DHS officials "admitted in court 
papers they had made false statements in an effort to push the ban, which New York was suing 
to overturn." The officials "had said that New York placed restrictions unlike any other state on 
the access immigration authorities have to Department of Motor Vehicles records. In fact, they 
later acknowledged, several other states have the same restrictions but have never faced 
attempts to block them from travel programs." Furman called the admissions "deeply troubling 
revelations." He demanded that the federal government provide "a comprehensive record of any 
and all 'inaccurate' or 'misleading' statements in their prior submissions" by Aug. 12. 
Cuccinelli Defends Administration's Actions On DACA. 
Acting Deputy DHS Secretary Cuccinelli said on NPR's Morning EditionVI (7/29, 7.5M), "The 
Supreme Court said overwhelmingly the Trump Administration can move forward to rescind 
DACA but that you haven't done it the right way. ... The Maryland ruling was last Friday and 
then following that Maryland ruling, we took interim action. ... We frequently undertake interim 
actions to give direction to our employees as to how to proceed in any particular area. This sort 
of interim guidance, I will call it, is entirely common. It is entirely within the legal authority of 
the Department of Homeland Security to do that and to set a system in place and the system 
does not allow new applicants." 
Trump Says He Will Act Against Big Tech If Congress Does Not. 
President Trump tweeted Wednesday around noon, "If Congress doesn't bring fairness to Big 
Tech, which they should have done years ago, I will do it myself with Executive Orders. In 
Washington, it has been ALL TALK and NO ACTION for years, and the people of our Country are 
sick and tired of it!" Reuters (7/29) covers the tweet. The Washington Times (7/29, Sherfinski, 
492K) reports the White House said Wednesday that the Administration "is moving forward to 
implement a recent presidential executive order on social media, ahead of testimony from top 
tech company executives on Capitol Hill. The Commerce Department this week filed a petition 
to clarify that social media companies can be held liable if they 'alter or editorialize users' 
speech,' according to the White House."

story 6, 2:00, Holt, 5.97M) that "the antitrust hearing was contentious from the start." Bezos 
testified "before Congress for the first time, facing criticism over a Wall Street Journal report
