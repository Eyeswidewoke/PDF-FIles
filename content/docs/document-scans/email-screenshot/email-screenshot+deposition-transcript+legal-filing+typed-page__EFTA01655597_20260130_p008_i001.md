officials said Tuesday. Now, their attention turns to clearing the remaining wreckage. The Bombardier CR1700 jet 
operating as American Airlines Flight 5342 and an Army Black Hawk helicopter on a training mission ran into each 
other over the river nearly a week ago in an accident that remains unexplained. The article added that more parts 
of the plane were pulled from the river Tuesday morning. One section of the plane's fuselage lay sideways on a 
barge, a row of cabin windows clearly visible. By afternoon, the plane's tail was removed from the murky water. 
Officials have said they would likely recover the American Airlines cockpit later Tuesday, wind gusts and tidal levels 
permitting. As of Tuesday, 66 of the 67 victims recovered have been identified. For the second day in a row 
Tuesday, the National Transportation Safety Board — which has been reviewing data from the Black Hawk's flight 
data recorder that was recovered over the weekend — backed away from announced plans for a public briefing on 
its investigation. "NTSB needs additional information to verify data points from the Black Hawk," the agency said in 
a post on X, adding that a written update would be released later in the day. As a salvage team continues to work in 
cold winter conditions to lift debris from the frigid water, key questions about the cause of the fatal collision remain 
— though answers may not be immediately clear for weeks. The recovery effort has been extensive, involving 
nearly every dive team in the area, including those from the US Coast Guard, the FBI's Washington Field Office dive 
team, DC Fire, and the International Association of Fire Fighters. ABC News (02/04, Shapiro), CBS News (02/04,

COUNTERTERRORISM 
FBI Seeking Information on Two Iranian Intel Officers Allegedly Involved in Robert Levinson Abduction 
CBS News (02/04, Czachor) reported that federal authorities have released a pair of seeking information posters for 
two Iranian intelligence officers accused of authorizing the 2007 abduction of retired FBI special agent Robert 
Levinson. The posters come as part of a decades-long investigation into Levinson's disappearance, the FBI's 
Washington field office said Tuesday, noting their "commitment to resolving the case for his long-suffering family." 
According to the article, since Levinson vanished, the United States has maintained the view that he was abducted 
during an unauthorized CIA mission in Iran and held wrongfully by the Iranian government. The former agent was 
thought to be alive until U.S. officials said in 2020 that intelligence suggested he may have been dead for "some 
time." The posters include images of Mohammad Baseri and Ahmad Khazai, the Iranian senior intelligence officers 
believed to be responsible for Levinson's abduction, subsequent detention and probable death. The men are 
described as high-ranking officers in Iran's Ministry of Intelligence and Security, according to the FBI. The article 
stated that Levinson has not been seen or heard from since March 9, 2007, one day after the retired agent traveled 
to the Iranian island of Kish, according to the FBI. U.S. officials say Levinson's family received video and 
photographs of Levinson in anonymous emails several years later, in 2010 and 2011, which showed him in captivity. 
They ultimately released the footage and an image publicly but could not trace the emails back to their senders. 
The U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned Baseri and Khazai under the Trump administration in 2020, the first time 
the country formally blamed Iran for Levinson's disappearance. At the time, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in 
a statement that Iranian officials "authorized Levinson's abduction and detention and launched a disinformation 
campaign to deflect blame for the regime." The article added that federal officials claim Baseri has been involved in 
counterespionage activities within and outside of Iran, in addition to sensitive investigations related to Iranian 
national security, and "has worked directly with intelligence officials from other countries to harm U.S. interests." 
Khazai has allegedly led Iranian intelligence and security delegations to other countries, the FBI said. The State 
Department is offering a reward of up to $20 million for information that leads to Levinson's recovery and return, 
while the FBI put forward a prize of up to $5 million for the same. The article quoted Sanjay Virmani, special agent 
in charge of the counterterrorism division at the FBI's Washington field office, who said, "The FBI remains steadfast 
in our commitment to return Bob to his family. Our extensive investigation continues to develop new leads and 
intelligence, and we will pursue all options to hold every Iranian official involved in his abduction accountable." Fox 
News (02/04, Norman), Iran News Update (02/04, Aslani), the Algemeiner (02/04, Walker), Iran 
International (02/04, Staff Writer), and CNN (02/04, Shelton) also reported on the story.
