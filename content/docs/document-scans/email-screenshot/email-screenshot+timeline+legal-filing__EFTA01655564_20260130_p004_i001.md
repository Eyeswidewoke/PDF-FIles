White House Denies Report of Trump Considering Removing FBI Director 
USA TODAY (11/25, Anderson) reported that the White House has denied a report that President Trump is 
considering removing Director Patel. According to the article, the denial came after a report from MS NOW (11/25, 
Leonnig, Barron-Lopez, Dilanian) cited unnamed sources saying Trump and his team were concerned about 
Director Patel amid scrutiny of his use of Bureau resources. The article highlighted that Trump himself stated "No" 
when asked if he's considering replacing Director Patel, and White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt posted a 
photo of Trump and Director Patel together to show support. Additional reporting on the story was provided by 
Bloomberg Law (11/25, Sullivan), Daily Mail (11/25, Staff Writer), The Independent (11/25, Rascius), The National 
Desk (11/25, Hazard), Newsweek (11/25, Gooding, Whisnant), Raw Story (11/25, Charky-Chami), and Reuters 
(11/25, Staff Writer). 
Director Patel Says Epstein Estate Refuses to Share Key Records With the FBI 
Newsweek (11/25, Gooding, Whisnant) reported that Director Patel said this week in an interview with journalist 
Catherine Herridge that Jeffrey Epstein's estate is refusing to share key records sought by investigators. He said the 
government and the estate hold "separate boxes" of information, limiting what the FBI can access as it reviews a 
new referral in the case. Director Patel noted that federal officials have repeatedly requested materials from the 
estate without success. He said the FBI will evaluate whatever evidence it can obtain as the inquiry moves forward. 
"Based on the new referral, we'll take a look at that and see what evidence comes, but there's an important 
distinction. The information that the government possesses versus the information that the Epstein estate 
possesses, those are two separate boxes of information and the Epstein estate has not been willing to share 
information with the U.S. government...and so even though we've requested them to do so," Director Patel stated. 
Bloomberg (11/25, Leopold) reported that the FBI has released dozens of emails related to the review and 
redaction of Jeffrey Epstein files, which were obtained through a FOIA request by Jason Leopold. The emails reveal 
that FBI personnel underwent special training for the "Epstein Transparency Project" and worked extensive hours, 
including nights and weekends, with the FBI paying $851,344 in overtime between March 17 and March 22. The 
article noted that the FBI reviewed and redacted a large volume of documents and videos, including "search 
warrant execution photos", "street surveillance video", and "aerial footage from FBI search warrant execution", 
with over 161 pages withheld due to ongoing law enforcement proceedings and other FOIA exemptions. Additional 
reporting on the story was provided by ABC News (11/25, Barr), Raw Story (11/25, Charky-Chami) (2), and 
Telegraph (11/25, Coen). 
FBI Surge Leads to Charges in 2020 Killing in Native American Community 
The Associated Press (11/26, Bryan) reported that federal authorities charged three people in the 2020 killing of 
Zachariah Shorty on the Navajo Nation following a surge of more than 60 extra FBI agents, analysts, and personnel 
deployed under Operation Not Forgotten. According to the article, the FBI's Indian Country program had roughly 
4,300 open investigations at the start of fiscal year 2025, and the FBI's intensified operations this year resulted in 
1,123 arrests, the recovery of more than 300 weapons, the identification or location of over 450 child victims. 
Director Patel acknowledged Monday that the challenge of covering such large jurisdictions is complicated by a lack 
of resources. He described Operation Not Forgotten as "a major step forward" in giving tribal communities the 
justice that they deserve. The article noted that this year's operation was the longest and most intense deployment 
of FBI resources in Indian Country to date, that an FBI initiative helped advance the Shorty case, and that the FBI's 
expanded efforts have raised hopes among families and advocates who want the investment made permanent. 
Drug Arrests and Gun Seizures Fell as Homeland Security Pursued Immigration 
The New York Times (11/25, Aleaziz, Nehamas, et al.) reported that narcotics arrests by Homeland Security special 
agents fell by 11% and weapon seizures dropped by 73% due to a shift in priorities to focus on immigration 
enforcement. According to the article, the shift in priorities has hindered investigations into major crimes, including 
child exploitation and terrorism financing, with a 28% drop in indictments for child exploitation crimes and a 17% 
drop in the number of child victims identified or rescued. The article highlighted that the FBI also devoted 
resources to the immigration crackdown. In a statement to The Independent (11/25, Woodward), Homeland 
Security assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin accused The New York Times of "peddling a false narrative" about 
HSI's report and touted an increase in arrests for human smuggling and the seizure of more than 2.5 million pounds 
of narcotics. "The facts are child exploitation, human trafficking, terrorism, financial scams, and smuggling all have 
a nexus to illegal immigration," she said. "Nearly every day, DHS law enforcement — including HSI — are arresting 
pedophiles, known or suspected terrorists, kidnappers, child smugglers, and sex traffickers, including those who
