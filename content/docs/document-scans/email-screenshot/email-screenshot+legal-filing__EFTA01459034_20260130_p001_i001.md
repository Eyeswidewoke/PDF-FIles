Special Report 
Euroglut a year on: alive and kicking, 
EUR/USD to break parity 
▪ 
Back in October 2014 we introduced our "Euroglut" hypothesis. We predicted 
a wave of European capital outflows to the rest of the world that would keep 
global yields unusually low and cause dramatic euro weakness despite the 
region's large current account surplus.' 
▪ 
In this report, we take the opportunity to review the evidence so far. We show 
that "Euroglut" is no longer a hypothesis but a reality: the Eurozone has 
experienced a historically unprecedented shift in portfolio flows, with net fixed 
income outflows running at a staggering 500bn EUR over the last twelve 
months, the largest on record. These flows are mostly directed towards US 
bond markets and have exceeded the Eurozone's current account surplus. 
They have pushed the basic balance into deficit over the past year contributing 
to EUR/USD weakness. 
▪ 
We show that Euro-area portfolio outflows will likely remain in the driving seat 
for years to come as core Europe's (mostly Germany's) vast savings are 
deployed overseas, while American and Asian investors retreat from European 
assets. Quantitative Tightening, the reserve draw-down by the major central 
banks in emerging markets, has only helped to accelerate this process. 
Bearish pressure on the euro from this structural adjustment is therefore likely 
to continue irrespective of how much easing the ECB delivers in December. 
• 
We re-iterate our forecast for continued EURNSD weakness over the course 
of this decade, with a move below parity in 2016 and a terminal forecast of 
85cents by 2017. We also re-iterate our expectation that European demand for 
foreign assets and bonds in particular is likely to be a persistent source of 
downward pressure on global bond yields in years to come. 
• 
In this piece we also address some common criticisms of our thesis, not least 
in a recent article by economists et the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. 
We counter their arguments that capital outflows have not been a driver of 
euro weakness. 
Introduction 
It has been more than a year since we first introduced our Euroglut thesis2 which 
has since drawn criticism from many corners, not least in a recent article by 
economists at the New York Fed. Partly in response to such criticism, we take the 
opportunity to review developments in the Euro-area balance of payments over 
the last year and compare our predictions to realized outcomes. 
08 Special Report. "Euroglut a new phase of global imbalances-. 6 October 2014. In this report we 
argued that the European current account surplus was not an obstacle to significant euro weakness but 
rather a symptom of a huge pool of excess savngs. We predicted that the combination of large European 
savings with aggressive EC8 easing would unleash a wave of capital outflows from the eurourea with 
signdicant global implications: the euro would weaken dramatically and global fixed income yields would 
stay persistently low as Europeans invested abroad. The portfolio reosancing progress wood not be 
compete until the Euro-area's net international investment position shifted into significam positive 
terntory, similar to other economies running large cuirent account surpluses.
