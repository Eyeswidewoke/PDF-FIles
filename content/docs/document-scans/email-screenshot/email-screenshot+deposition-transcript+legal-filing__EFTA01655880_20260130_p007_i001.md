CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS 
NYC Mayor Eric Adams and Others Subpoenaed in Long-Standing Federal Probe 
CNN (08/15, Pazmino, Morales) reported that New York City Mayor Eric Adams has been issued a federal grand jury 
subpoena as part of an investigation into corruption and illegal campaign donations, according to two sources 
familiar with the matter. The article mentioned that City Hall and Adams' 2021 mayoral campaign committee also 
received a set of subpoenas, which were issued in July and cover a variety of materials including text messages, 
communications and other documents, one of the sources said. The subpoenas are the latest development in the 
monthslong investigation into Adams and his campaign that has focused on possible public corruption and foreign 
influence. Adams was not personally served, according to a source familiar. There's no appearance and no 
deposition in this request. Letters were delivered to his attorneys and to City Hall's counsel. The article noted that it 
is not the first time Adams has been the target of federal investigators. Last year, FBI agents seized his cellphones 
and iPad pursuant to a court warrant. The article added that CNN has previously reported the investigation into 
Adams is focused on campaign money, possible favors and foreign influence. The investigation has dragged on for 
several months and first became public after it was reported the FBI and investigators with the US Attorney's Office 
for the Southern District of New York raided the home of Brianna Suggs, Adams' chief fundraiser. The New York 
Post (08/15, McCarthy, Bhole, et al.), Fox News (08/15, Whitten), CBS News (08/15, Brennan), ABC News (08/15, 
Katersky), Bloomberg (08/15, Porzecanski), the Daily Beast (08/15, Folk), New York Daily News (08/15, 
Sommerfeldt), New York Times (08/15, Rashbaum, Rubinstein), Reuters (08/15, Staff Writer), and the Gothamist 
(08/15, Lane) also reported on the story. 
Mexico Waiting on U.S. For Flight Details Behind Capture of Drug Kingpins 
Reuters (08/15, Diaz) reported that Mexico's attorney general's office said on Thursday it has yet to receive detailed 
information from U.S. authorities about a flight that carried two notorious drug traffickers to the U.S. last month, 
amid rising tensions between the two countries over the arrests. In a statement, the office said it requested details 
from the DOJ about the flight, including detailed records on its pilot, the aircraft, and related migration and 
customs authorizations. The article stated that Ismael "El Mayo" Zambada, a co-founder of the Sinaloa Cartel, 
was detained on July 25 at a New Mexico airfield along with one of the sons of his incarcerated Sinaloa Cartel co-
founder Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman. Mexico is investigating the events to determine whether treason was 
committed via the forcible abduction of a Mexican citizen and their delivery to U.S. authorities. The dramatic arrest 
was a major coup for U.S. law enforcement but has provoked consternation from the Mexican government, which 
was not given prior warning and was not involved. The Associated Press (08/15, Peitz) reported that Zambada, 76, 
has so far appeared in U.S. federal court in El Paso, Texas, which is in one of the jurisdictions where he has been 
indicted. He has pleaded not guilty to racketeering conspiracy, drug conspiracy and other charges. Federal 
prosecutors in Texas asked a court Thursday to hold a hearing to take the procedural steps needed to move him to 
the New York jurisdiction that includes Brooklyn, where the elder Guzman was convicted in 2019 of drug and 
conspiracy charges and sentenced to life in prison. If prosecutors get their wish, the case against Zambada in Texas 
would proceed after the one in New York. 
Bob Menendez to Be Replaced by New Jersey Governor's Former Top Aide 
The Associated Press (08/15, Catalini) reported that New Jersey Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy will name his former 
chief of staff George Helmy to serve as interim senator when Bob Menendez resigns later this month after 
his conviction on federal bribery charges, according to a person familiar with the decision. Helmy served as 
Murphy's top aide from 2019 to 2023 and is now an executive at RWJ Barnabas Health, a large health care provider 
in the state. He was formerly an aide to Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey. The source spoke on condition of 
anonymity because the decision was not yet public ahead of an expected announcement on Friday in Newark. The 
article noted that Menendez wrote in a letter to Murphy last month that he's resigning on Aug. 20, just over a 
month after the jury's verdict. He said he planned to appeal. The article mentioned that Menendez, 70, was 
convicted of charges that he sold the power of his office to three New Jersey businessmen who sought a variety of 
favors. Prosecutors said Menendez used his influence to meddle in three different state and federal criminal 
investigations to protect his associates. They said he helped one bribe-paying friend get a multimillion-dollar deal 
with a Qatari investment fund and another keep a contract to provide religious certification for meat bound for 
Egypt. He was also convicted of taking actions that benefited Egypt's government in exchange for bribes, including 
providing details on personnel at the U.S. embassy in Cairo, ghostwriting a letter to fellow senators regarding lifting 
a hold on military aid to Egypt. FBI agents found stacks of gold bars and $480,000 hidden in Menendez's house.
