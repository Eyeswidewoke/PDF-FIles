two Camden County banks two days apart, authorities said Thursday." Leon Stanford, 51, of

Illinois House Speaker Madigan Responds To Bribery Charges Against Associates. 
WGEM-TV Quincy, IL (11/19, Roberts) reports from Chicago, "House Speaker Mike Madigan 
released a written statement Thursday following the issuing of charges on Wednesday against 
several former executives and lobbyists for Commonwealth Edison." WGEM-TV adds, 
"Prosecutors haven't charged Madigan and in the statement Madigan maintains the indictment 
alleges no criminal misconduct or wrong doing on his part." According to WGEM-TV, 
"Wednesday's indictment named five individuals including Mike McClain, a former Quincy 
lawmaker, lobbyist, and close confidant of Madigan. Each of the five individuals was charged 
with bribery conspiracy, bribery, and willfully falsifying ComEd and Exelon books, records, and 
accounts. The indictment also names former ComEd CEO Anne Pramaggiore, former executive 
John Hooker, and lobbyist Jay Doherty." 
The Chicago Sun-Times (11/19, Hinton, 875K) reports, "After members of Madigan's inner 
circle were indicted for an alleged bribery scheme designed to influence him, four more state 
House Democrats say they won't be voting for Madigan to maintain his powerful position in 
January, effectively blocking him from another term in that seat if they hold to their 
statements. Madigan said in a lengthy, two-page statement that to the extent anyone at 
Commonwealth Edison thought they could 'influence my conduct as a legislator ... they were 
fundamentally mistaken: 'If they even harbored the thought that they could bribe or influence 
me, they would have failed miserably,' Madigan said. 'I take offense at any notion otherwise. To 
the extent anyone may have suggested to others that I could be influenced, then they, too, 
were wrong. Had I known about it, I would have made every effort to put a stop to it." 
The Chicago Tribune (11/19, Pearson, Munks, Petrella, 2.65M) reports, "Madigan, long 
undisputed in his role as Illinois' most powerful politician, now finds his leadership hanging on
