Re: 
Hi Eva! 
There are several different sources, and it is a very competitive fie=d. Few have been able to differentiate themselves 
enough to get attention=of funders.You also need to be clear on what you want to do, how you will=do it, and why you 
are the best positioned to do it. 
1. Infrastructural costs: bldgs and equipment are usually offered by=rich individuals who have been touched by the 
disease in one way or anoth=r. Most will require matched funding and also request naming rights. 
2. Operational expensee: no one funds this. Donors are all looking to=see that the business model is profitable and can 
sustain growth over at=least the intermediate period. A few of the large infrastructure folks ha=e offered a small grant 
for the non-recoverable costs associated with sta=t up (like ads for hiring and other HR stuff) 
3. Science: this is a mixed bag. Clinical trials and such are funded=by drug companies and in some cases the NIH. There 
are some groups like=the Komen foundation, Avon or Revlon that offer support but they have a=notoriously short 
attention span and usually fit into the last category.adiv> 
4. Awareness: I think this is a dumb category but it seems to get the=most publicity since celebrities and donors looking 
for name recognition=(=CSR) are always trolling for opportunity. In addition to the names ab=ve, you might also look at 
Atena (a water company). You can go to IRS.gov=and do a scan for charities and search "breast". Then you can look 
throug= 990s and see who actually funds what they say they do and how much they=give. The main problem will be that 
you can only search by name and some=are family foundations without the word "breast" in them. Charity Navigat=r 
(http://www.charityna=igator.org/ <http://www.charitynavigator.org/> ) is also a great place to search and you can use 
any term= you'd like. 
I have a few ideas for you, some very outside the box. 
1. As a charitable organization, like COUQ or maybe some others that=you know about, you can make loans in addition 
to grants. They are called=PRls (or program-related grants). They must meet with the charitable miss=on of the org and 
do require some painful due diligence but they result=in below market rate loans. If what you need money for will 
eventually ge=erate revenue or pay itself off, this might be a great use of a PRI. You=just need to find a charitable 
organization that can leverage their balan=e sheet and has the same interests. Depending on who they are, you 
might=talk about an equity stake and/or loan forgiveness (they need to be sophi=ticated...) or you can go the easy route 
with regular debt. 
2. JEE might not like this idea but I have always thought that Victor=a's Secret doesn't do enough here. They are all 
about breasts...If they=have a foundation you should structure something really cool like a 5 yea= grant, some publicity 
and a PRI. But you'd have to have a unique story=a super business plan. The IRS watches closely. 
Hope that is helpful,
