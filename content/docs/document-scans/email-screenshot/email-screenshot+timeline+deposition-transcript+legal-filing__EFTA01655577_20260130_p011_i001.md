she had been stabbed more than a dozen times. The article stated that days later, a judge in Cook County, Illinois 
signed an arrest warrant for Carrera's newlywed husband, Arnoldo Jimenez in connection his wife's slaying at her 
Burbank home. The article highlighted that after being on the run for almost 13 years, the FBI announced, Jimenez 
has been found and taken into custody in Mexico in connection to Carrera's "gruesome" killing. At the time of his 
arrest, Jimenez was on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted list. The article quoted Burbank Police Department Deputy Chief 
William Casey, who said in a statement following Jimenez' Friday arrest in Mexico, "The FBI and Burbank Police 
Department were committed to bringing justice for Estrella Carrera and her family." The article detailed that 
according to the FBI, on May 12, 2012 - one day after the couple wed - Jimenez allegedly stabbed his wife to death 
in his black, four-door, 2006 Maserati. An FBI agent told CBS News Jimenez stabbed his wife 18 times. The article 
indicated that he then reportedly dragged her body into the bathroom tub of her apartment, the FBI said. A motive 
in the slaying was not immediately known. The article outlined that Jimenez was charged with first-degree murder, 
and on May 15, 2012, a judge issued a warrant for his arrest. Two days later, according to a news release issued by 
the FBI last week, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois issued a federal arrest warrant 
for Jimenez after prosecutors charged him federally with unlawful flight to avoid prosecution. The article confirmed 
that FBI, an FBI legal attaché in Mexico City, and federal court officials collaborated to locate Jimenez, arrested by 
agents of the Fiscalia General de la RepUblica (Mexico's Attorney General's Office) in conjunction with Interpol. The 
article added that Jimenez remained in custody Wednesday pending extradition proceedings, the FBI told the 
reporting outlet. His extradition hearing date was not immediately known on Wednesday. Patch (02/05, Swanson) 
also reported on the story. 
FBI Warn iPhone And Android Users 
Forbes (02/05, Doffman) reported that the FBI is warning smartphone users to beware the threat from dangerous 
calls that will cost you a significant amount of money if you make a mistake. The article explained that the FBI's 
warning focuses on scam calls pretending to from banks or technical support, that trick users into moving money 
from their account or installing dangerous software on their device. The Bureau says such scam calls may even be 
able to "spoof" the caller ID number, making the threat even harder to detect. The article indicated that the FBI 
advised that any such call that comes at you unsolicited, where you haven't first reach out to your bank or technical 
support, will be a scam. The chance of such a call being legitimate is so small that it's never worth taking the risk. 
You need to be absolutely sure — beyond any doubt — that the caller is legitimate. The article highlighted that per 
another recent FBI warning, the scammers insist the matter is urgent, giving you little time to think. If you find 
yourself talking to a law enforcement officer who is demanding money or any other similar request, then you can 
hang up. The article pointed out that if you're concerned, then call local law enforcement using a publicly available 
number and explain what has happened. The article added that the advice is always the same — end the call as 
soon as the coercion starts, and don't listen to the well-rehearsed script. 
Continued Reporting: Trump's Top D.C. Prosecutor Vows to Wield the Law Against Those Who Get In Elon 
Musk's Way 
MSNBC (02/05, Rubin) reported that shortly after Donald Trump's interim U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia 
started in his position, he launched a probe of the office's Jan. 6 work, while the DOJ fired prosecutors who worked 
on those cases against Trump supporters. The article explained that Ed Martin, who was a "Stop the Steal" 
advocate and lawyer for Jan. 6 defendants, proceeded this week to pledge support for Elon Musk and his 
"Department of Government Efficiency" workers, assuring Musk that he'd bring the office's full weight to bear 
"against anyone who impedes your work or threatens your people." The article noted that Martin wrote to Musk 
on Monday, "We will protect DOGE and other workers no matter what," calling it important to keep American 
employees safe and to protect "the American people's property." The article mentioned that separately, the federal 
prosecutor's office for D.C. issued an official statement saying that an initial review showed that "certain individuals 
and/or groups have committed acts that appear to violate the law in targeting DOGE employees" and that the 
office has "our prosecutors preparing." The article explained that Martin's letter followed reporting from Wired 
that identified "six young men — all apparently between the ages of 19 and 24, according to public databases, their 
online presences, and other records — who have little to no government experience and are now playing critical 
roles" in Musk's crew. Reuters (02/05, Hals, Queen) also reported on the story.
