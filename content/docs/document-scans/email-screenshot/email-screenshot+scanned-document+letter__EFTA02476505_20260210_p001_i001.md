Radical but my preferred idea. . START from total =A0scratch. there is absolutely nothing worth keeping in your 
family =ffice except for heather , nothing at all . I remember when i bought=my first house in order to renovate and jack 
robertson said forget i=. knock it down start again, I could n't believe it. =A0but he was right. like your tax returns 
that were done in triplic=te. TOM RICH ALAN. . tom and rich were not really usef=l in the end. Alan was the only 
smart one. you should in my opinion =C2 Start a brand new office. hire cfo. bring joe ove=. heather and samantha, 
run parallel for 6 months =A0and close down the mess of elysium forever. leave you= kids a functioning operation 
professionally constructed and managed. =AO NOT BY ME!!! 
lAst nov i laid out priorities IT, being=the first nothing as of today. 
in July I said fo=us on airplane as a test . to 
examine procedure and proficiency, =AO so far mostly a waste of resources time people =tc. Only last week told 
debra owns 49 percent of plane. no IT= to speak of. bens house unaccounted for. t=x returns very very sloppy, . 
boat still argued as =A0third home.. pilots bonuses? , structure unkown by all. ca=h sitlling at the same time loans 
outstanding. 
Phaidon , looks like close to breakeven in a few years. =C2 others totally unknown. 
Query , do you really wan= this ? : 
I m not sure how you both want to have an investmen= office and have cash flow being eaten by publishing and loans 
amounts out=tanding increased by art. --interest rates will be going =A0up.- . your plane will cost 10 million to 
refinance - so will boat=if sold next year-. art space and regan , both needs more cash. with littl= return, taxes, art 
purchases . Part of radical solut=tion is to sell publishing.altogether. (are the children really inte=ested.) . 
restrucuture plane from scratch. layers unnc=ssary. simplify crazy structure s bank accounts trading accoun=s 
accounts payble. credit cards. etc. The =est way to wean yourself away from me is to have someone else do the 
whole=thing from scratch. . move brad to be the replacement for Rich=rd.. he is nice but this is not what he does. 
Him sayi=g it is s0000 fucked up to me , was only an echo of me sayint it to you. =C2 .
