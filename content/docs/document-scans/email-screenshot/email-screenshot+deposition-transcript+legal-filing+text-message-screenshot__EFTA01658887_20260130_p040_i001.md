this country over 245,000 lives, those numbers are going up every single day. I think common 
sense suggests that we needed a vaccine as quickly as possible. Now, as you heard Dr. Fauci 
say, the challenge now is once you get the vaccine, how do you get it out to 300 million people 
as quickly and as effectively as possible? And I look forward to the Biden administration 
working right now, as I know they are, on plans to do that. One of the concerns that we have is 
that as a result of the pandemic in all 50 states in this country right now, you're 
seeing...resources, doctors, nurses, hospitals being stretched to the limit." 
More States Enact Tough Restrictions As Coronavirus Spreads. 
On the lead NBC Nightly NewsVi (11/15, lead story, 3:05, Snow, 3.53M) segment, Kate Snow 
reported state and local officials nationwide "are scrambling to combat COVID as we head into 
another work and school week. At least 15 states have ordered increased restrictions, made 
changes to business rules, or rolled back re-opening plans just in this past week." Meagan 
Fitzgerald added Washington Gov. Gov. Jay Inslee (D) on Sunday became "the latest to tighten 
restrictions after daily cases surged to a record Saturday." 
Bloomberg (11/15, Yang, 4.73M) reports that under the new Washington state 
restrictions, "restaurants will no longer be allowed to serve patrons indoors, and outdoor dining 
will be limited to no more than five people under the new measures," while "gatherings with 
people outside of the same household indoors will also be prohibited, unless visitors follow 
quarantine rules." Reuters (11/15, Layne) reports "most" of the restrictions "will take effect 
Monday at 11:59 p.m. and last for one month." 
In addition, Reuters (11/15, Heavey) reports Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer (D) on 
Sunday "ordered a ban on in-person high school and college classes as well as indoor dining 
service for three weeks starting on Wednesday as increasingly cold weather drives people 
indoors where the virus can spread more easily." Reuters adds Whitmer "banned public events 
at concert halls, casinos, movie theaters, skating rinks and other venues, while in-home 
gatherings will be limited to 10 people from no more than two households." 
Meanwhile, The Hill (11/15, Bowden, 2.98M) reports that after White House Coronavirus 
Task Force member Dr. Scott Atlas "criticized" the new Michigan restrictions, Whitmer "fired 
back." Whitmer "told CNN on Saturday that the remarks were the latest effort by the White 
House to single her out, as the Democratic governor of a swing state, over her response to the 
COVID-19 pandemic which has surged in the form of risings rates of new cases around the 
nation in recent days." 
The Washington Post (11/15, Knowles, 14.2M) reports North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum 
(R) on Friday "acknowledged that his state and country were in dire straits," prompting him to 
reduce capacity for "bars, restaurants and event venues" while announcing masks "must be 
worn inside businesses, indoors in public spaces and outdoors in public when social distancing 
can't be maintained, backed by potential fines of up to $1,000 for the first offense." However, 
the AP (11/15, MacPherson, Groves) reports nurses in North Dakota "fear things are about to 
get even harder now that...Burgum has allowed the state's beleaguered hospitals to use 
infected but asymptomatic workers to treat COVID-19 patients." 
In addition, the New York Times (11/15, Estrin, 18.61M) reports New York "may soon" 
impose new restrictions on religious services as the number of cases in New York City continue 
to rise. 
However, the Wall Street Journal (11/15, Hawkins, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) 
reports that schools in New York City will stay open on Monday after the city on Sunday 
remained below the 3% seven-day positivity threshold required for them to close, which the 
New York Times (11/15, Shapiro, Rubinstein, 18.61M) describes as a "relatively conservative" 
figure, but Kathy Park reported on NBC Nightly NewsVI (11/15, story 2, 1:50, Snow, 3.53M) 
that with "infections spiking, some schools in Georgia and Boston have temporarily closed. The 
same for Sheridan, Colorado."
