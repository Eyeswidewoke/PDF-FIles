<=iv class="gmail_quote"> 
I was told that To=s office is sending someone in ,or some people in, to review something.Q=A0 brad told me ,the 
partnership accounting. I know nothing more tha= that. Having them review things without even asking for my input , or 
let=alone my direction ,is ridiculous. but.. I guess you wanted to save money =does wendy has a role. ? The audit has 
brought to the fore the lack =f your office quality that i have been violently squawking about.Q=A0 ie . children 
playing at at adult game. It is inconce=vable to me that John castrucci is still there , joslin =art time but relied on. , joe 
mistake after mistake and brad a0=A0 corporate bandleader talking about the office's finance team, accou=ting dept, 
and directing wendy to do things that are clearly n=t in your interest. ( saving money again ?) its nuts!! = a still non-
existent IT dept. impossible , it was the f=rst thing on my list of things that were needed to be done. =C21> Still no 
trading accounts to speak of , though its prophylacti= quality has been discussed over and over again the past three 
years .4,=A0 computer do not read page 6. the women at the IRS do. !4>=A0 As you said your motivation to keep this 
group of part timers was=a consequence of my high fees. . the unfort=nate result was easily predictable. - now 
40=A0 you can hire me and my team or not. if yes , I will =versee the audits. take charge of the TRA BRH assignments 
and review 2012 =ptions!! your redo of the estate fire drill has not moved very much. 40=A0 Lots of paper needs to be 
collected and reviewed, At MY direction. the =utside team will be brought in at my expense working for me, c=ming in 
for two to three weeks -they will review . suces=ion, technology, tax and compliance. investment reporting „ 
comput=rized timelines for filings etc. . household classifcati=ns and reporting that makes sense. Have no fear the 
goal=of this excercise is to end, not extend , our financial interaction.=C240 you will have a machine that works . to 
drive it is not comple= , to build the car, another story, Unfortunatleyfor us both, the p=ice for my work has not 
changed since day one. 40m per y=ar, I m willing to discount it to 35 as I did give you a bad =umber when asked and 
should pay an embarassment fine. 1= also aware, as you made perfectly clear . that you have paid what y=u consider a 
great deal of money, though, as you know , without a do=bt , you have far and away recieved way more than called for 
i= our agreement . please also remember that you and i agreed n= more demands on my time after the last payment , 
I stepped i= to help , as you had an unexpected home mess on your plate ( not be=ause i was responsible for joslin 
having a breakdown ). and have wor=ed many many hours doing things that were never my responsiblity ,so=ey 
because of our unique friendship. by the way , on an=ther note you recently seemed shy to discuss certain things. , 
pleas= be assured I make no judgement on any of your activities , w=ether or not i agree with them . not my role. my 
role is, pro=ection first. no matter what you do. I am on your side. 
<=div> 2. you can decide that brad , tom , and whomever else you =hoose can oversee your audits . they are both 
aware and sensit=ve to the issue at hand. alan could be brought in but i would=be extra careful having paul weiss given 
access to entire story. you=can delay a decision to after your spa. but I wouldnt if i were you. 
3. Remind me to talk to you about.=AO..
