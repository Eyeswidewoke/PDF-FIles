PROTESTS
Federal Buildings Fortify In Anticipation Of Breonna Taylor Grand Jury Decision. 
Fox News (9/20, Wallace, 27.59M) reports the federal courthouse and at least one other federal 
building in Louisville, Kentucky, "will be closed to the public this week amid widespread 
anticipation that the state will decide whether to bring criminal charges against the officers 
involved in the Breonna Taylor shooting." The "courthouse and attached offices were being 
boarded up Sunday ahead what could be a controversial grand jury decision." Protestors are 
calling for all three officers involved in Taylor's death to be "charged with at least second-
degree manslaughter. But legal experts tell Fox News it's possible some of the officers will not 
face homicide charges." 
NBC News (9/19, 6.14M) reports the federal buildings "are closing for the week starting 
Monday as the city waits for a possible announcement by the state attorney general on the 
Breonna Taylor investigation. Federal officials have not announced why" the buildings "are 
closing. But the Louisville Courier-Journal reported that a courthouse official said that building is 
closing in anticipation of an announcement."

confidence' in Mayor Greg Fischer over his handling of the death of Breonna Taylor and the 
subsequent unrest but also offered him a list of ways to regain the city's trust." Language 
calling on Fischer to resign was removed before the resolution "passed 22 to 4 after three hours 
of debate." The resolution called for a public investigation into "the killings of Taylor and David 
McAtee and subsequent civil unrest," a complete review of police procedures, and support for 
"home ownership without displacement in impoverished areas."

Tamika Palmer, the mother of Breonna Taylor, who "was fatally shot by Louisville police during a 
botched narcotics raid" in March. When asked what she will do if charges are not brought 
against the police officers involved in that shooting, Palmer said, "I won't go away, I'll still 
fight." The NPR article highlighted that late last month, Kentucky Attorney General Daniel
