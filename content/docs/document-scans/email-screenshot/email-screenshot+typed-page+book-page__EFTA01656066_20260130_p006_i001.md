ABC News (09/17, Barr) reported that Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas stated that the U.S. is 
facing a "heightened threat environment," particularly in light of an apparent second assassination attempt against 
former President Donald Trump, which the FBI is investigating. According to the article, Mayorkas highlighted the
