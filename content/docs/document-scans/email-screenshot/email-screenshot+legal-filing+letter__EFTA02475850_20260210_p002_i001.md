I include below the=email i sent to you on April 15, the day i was examining your returnsQ=A0 It laid out my 
understanding of the compensation for a transaction of the magnitude to the penny of the one just completed. though 
the number was great it=20 was clear. When it appeared that the details could now be worked out=C2* I was the first 
to say, it is too much money, however. 
From day zero I proposed to discount to 50 - 60 million =the fair price of the transaction just completed . including 
<=pan>Phaidon.. though this amount was already substantially les= than our agreed and negotiated formula. - I was 
never told that thisl,=A0 was out of range. in fact, alternative methods of payment . plane, =r an -in-kind payment 
were discussed ( ie =20 including keeping the 30m portion of fee outstanding till March=) ,I provided as you 
specifically requested a detailed step b= step execution plan and reviewed all documents that i was given access to.=( 
Phaidon was not forthcoming ) in or=er to make my many corrections . I was then told t=at =span>Alans involvement 
warranted a discount . Even in the best of I=ght , though it is beyond question that not one time in the three ye=rs of 
his retainer has he ever proposed a unique idea. (includin= any wayt to deal with the use issue on debras death ,or 
even the most basic review of your=largest asset by far , the BRH agreement. ) O.K. - lets say he made a contribution to 
the pla= and stretch reality beyond the pale and say it was 50 %. though no =ne could posit such a large amount unless 
they were wearing a brightly=20 colored clown suit. , the payment associated with the deal was =nown . It had both 
sent in writing and spoken about on the phone nume=ous times , a detailed execution plan was provided . then an= 
only then after all was laid out for the group I was told that after a number o= conversations with brad karp that a 
total of only 20m would be paid , (and even that was more tha= originally contemplated ) for both transactions . Leon I 
feel l= was remarkably unfair. I wondered whether brad even knew of o=r prior agreement.? I called him and he said 
he was never told.?, I wou=d ask that you I and Brad karp sit together if you think it would be helpful.. I would like to 
sen= him this email, with your consent of course. If the transactio=s were never consummated , i would not be owed a 
dime, however , the expect=d fee was known up front. , the detailed step by step plan was f=llowed and overseen by 
me, the amount that I had requested befo=e the transaction was even begun, and had already been heavily 
discou=ted, out of friendship, from our agreement . I believe the decision re onl= paying 20 m has frankly , left me 
felling quite une=sy.

Please take the following in the spirit in which it is meant 
<=r>With Brad out of the office and unable to run his usual inte=ference , the level of his total and utter incompetence 
was brought =learly, , front and center. He may be a step up from Eileen= but, if he is, then it is certainly not by 
much,Q=A0 A major difference is that Eileen knew she was over =er head. Brad struts his stupiditly whenever he gets a 
chance= The list of things that were done and not done he refused to let be=prepared as it will exemplify the 
outrageious lack of progres= and prioirties 
A critical=example. - Though you and I have spent many many hours di=cussing the importance of attentive care
