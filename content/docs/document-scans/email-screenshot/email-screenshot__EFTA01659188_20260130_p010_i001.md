FINANCIAL CRIME & CORPORATE SCANDALS 
Former Adidas Consultant Says Firm Gave Airline Tickets, Gifts To College Players. 
The Louisville (KY) Courier-Journal (5/5, Wolfson, 554K) reports former Adidas consultant Dan 
Cutler says in a sworn deposition that the firm "provided airfare and other benefits to college 
players, including former Duke basketball star Zion Williamson." Cutler "said an Adidas 
representative provided four airline tickets for Williamson's family before he enrolled at Duke." 
The deposition is part of "a lawsuit filed by disqualified University of Louisville recruit Brian 
Bowen Jr." The piece explains that a number of colleges have "been accused of misconduct by 
the NCAA stemming from an FBI investigation into men's college basketball that resulted in the 
2018 trial and convictions of James Gatto, an Adidas executive; Merl Code, an Adidas 
consultant; and Christian Dawkins, an aspiring sports agent." 
The Louisville (KY) Courier-Journal (5/5, 554K) reports the University of Louisville "insists 
the bribery scheme preceding former basketball recruit Brian Bowen's enrollment was all 
Adidas' doing and should not be held against the school that stood to benefit from his five-star 
talents." However, depositions and other court documents filed in the case "could undermine 
that argument in U of L's infractions case with the NCAA's Independent Accountability 
Resolution Process." Bowen "was prevented from playing college basketball amid allegations 
arising from an FBI probe that his signing was induced by a promise of $100,000, in violation of 
NCAA rules."
