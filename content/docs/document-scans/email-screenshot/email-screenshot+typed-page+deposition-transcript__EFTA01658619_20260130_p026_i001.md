Meanwhile, former Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd and Daniel Rosen, a founding 
partner of Rhodium Group, argue in the Wall Street Journal (9/22, Subscription Publication, 
7.57M) that despite repeated commitments from China to reform its economy, the nation has 
delayed, and in some cases, backtracked on its pledges. 
Xi Vows China Will Achieve "Carbon Neutrality" Before 2060. The New York Times 
(9/22, Sengupta, 18.61M) reports in during his UN General Assembly address Tuesday, Chinese 
President Xi Jinping pledged that his country, "the world's top producer of greenhouse gases, 
would adopt much stronger climate targets" and achieve what he called "carbon neutrality 
before 2060." If realized, the Time says, the pledges "would be crucial in the global fight 
against climate change." 
Chinese Tycoon Who Criticized Xi Sentenced To 18 Years In Prison. The New York 
Times (9/22, 18.61M) reports Ren Zhicliang, "the property tycoon...notorious for his blunt 
criticisms of the Communist Party," was sentenced Tuesday in Beijing to 18 years in prison after 
a court found him "guilty of graft, taking bribes, misusing public funds and abusing his power 
during and after his time as an executive at a property development company." Ren's 
"supporters and sympathizers said that his real crime was criticizing the Communist Party and 
calling the country's hard-line leader, Xi Jinping, a 'clown." The Washington Post (9/22, Dou, 
14.2M) reports "scholars say the harsh punishment indicates the growing dissent Xi is facing 
from his own Chinese Communist Party elite, as he takes the country down a more 
authoritarian path." 
Pence: "Reckless" For Biden To Undermine Vaccine. 
Vice President Pence said on WABC-AMVi New York (9/22, 18K) that "when it comes to the 
vaccine issue, I just think it is, it really is reckless and irresponsible that Joe Biden and Kamala 
Harris are undermining confidence in a vaccine." He said, "They need to stop playing politics 
with American lives. We know that the day that the FDA approves a safe and effective vaccine 
because of Operation Warp Speed, we're going to have tens of millions of doses available for 
the American people, and the last thing we need is people like Joe Biden and Kamala Harris 
undermining the confidence of the American people." 
Pfizer's COVID Vaccine Trial On Track To Beat Rivals. 
Bloomberg (9/22, Langreth, 4.73M) reports, "The Covid-19 vaccine trial designed by Pfizer Inc. 
and its German partner BioNTech SE may allow them to find whether their shot works before 
their fastest-moving rivals." The firms "plan a first look after a mere 32 coronavirus infections 
have accumulated in their massive 44,000-person trial," which could happen as early as Sept. 
27. Pfizer has also "given itself four chances to get a preliminary result, before reaching the 
final goal of 164." Moderna won't "dive in until 53 cases have occurred; its ultimate goal is to 
make a judgment at 151 diagnoses." AstraZeneca will "take its first look at 75 cases, and not 
again until the trial is complete with 150." 
Federal Advisory Committee Postpones Vote On Vaccine Rollout. 
The Wall Street Journal (9/22, Loftus, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) reports the Advisory 
Committee on Immunization Practices, which advises the CDC, will delay a vote on who should 
get the first doses of potential coronavirus vaccines. The committee was initially expected to 
vote on Tuesday, but it may wait until government officials approve a specific vaccine or 
vaccines. 
FDA Expected To Announce New Standard For Emergency Authorization Of Vaccine. 
The Washington Post (9/22, Al, McGinley, Johnson, 14.2M) reports the FDA "is expected to 
spell out a tough, new standard for an emergency authorization of a coronavirus vaccine as 
soon as this week that will make it exceedingly difficult for any vaccine to be cleared before 
Election Day." The agency is releasing "the guidance to boost transparency and public trust as it
