The reason why one would do the trade below is for its embedded leverage. While it requires upfront premium, there is 
no IA required besides it. A premium neutral risk reversal utilizes your capital as it requires Initial Amount under your 
Credit Support Annex terms. 
We will send risk reversals quotes when market reopens. Could you please clarify what expiries you would like to look 
at?

Jeffrey — we wanted to share this note with you as it relates to what we perceive to be your macro views. 
James Malcolm is updating his view on the Bol - he thinks there is now material event risk for the July meeting which 
warrants some 3-month vol premium on Yen assets and a close following of domestic data and news in the interim. Is

So invest 4m$ upfront to make 50m$ if the level trades at any point during the lifetime of the trade

From James Malcolm : 
Minor tweaks or comments in recent BoJ reports suggest the central bank is becoming more nervous about missing its 
inflation target a little over two years after it was lifted and a radical new QE program to achieve it was 
implemented. They suggest that if the economy does not pick up substantial momentum over the next ten weeks 
additional easing may be warranted. The July 15 monetary policy meeting is key as it provides for an interim assessment 
of policy board member's price and growth forecasts, and comes just after the Bank's quarterly Tankan and public 
opinion survey. Beyond the hard data, these will show whether spending intentions and inflation expectations are lifting 
in response to higher profits and wages absent the consumption-tax drag. 
What has changed? This week's semiannual Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices report ('The Bank's View') replaced 
its assessment that "there are downside risks" for prices with the starker phrase that "risks are skewed to the 
downside." A research study on the impact of GE thus far, published today, concluded that "in order to achieve the price 
stability target of 2% in a stable manner, a further increase in inflation expectations is necessary." It also said that while
