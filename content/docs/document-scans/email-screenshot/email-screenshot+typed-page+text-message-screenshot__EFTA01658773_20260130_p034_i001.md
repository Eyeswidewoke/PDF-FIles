Fighting Among Republicans Come To Light Over CIA's Haspel. 
The New York Times (11/11, Barnes, 18.61M) reports, "Internal Republican divisions over the 
fate of Gina Haspel's tenure as CIA director have come tumbling into view as some Senate 
leaders showed support while President Trump's allies pushed for her ouster, in part over the 
agency's role in disseminating the whistle-blower complaint that prompted impeachment, 
according to current and former administration officials." Senate Majority Leader McConnell 
invited Haspel "for a conspicuous meeting in his office" on Tuesday, prompting Donald Trump Jr. 
adviser Arthur Schwartz to accuse Republicans of trying to manipulate the President. Sen. John 
Cornyn (R-TX) responded via Twitter, "saying intelligence should not be partisan and is 'about 
preserving impartial, nonpartisan information necessary to inform policy makers."

Developers Say Russian Vaccine Is 92% Effective. 
NBC Nightly NewsVi (11/11, story 8, 1:30, Holt, 5.8M) reported, "In the race for a COVID 
vaccine, Russia claimed Tuesday that the trial of its vaccine shows it's highly effective," but 
questions remain about whether the information can be trusted or if the vaccine will make it 
outside the country. 
The AP (11/11, Litvinova) reports, "Developers of Sputnik V, Russia's experimental 
COVID-19 vaccine, announced Wednesday that early, interim data from a large trial suggests 
the shot appears to be 92% effective." The statement, "which did not include detailed 
information about the trial, comes just two days after a similar one from Pfizer Inc., but is 
based on far fewer virus cases. Some experts suggest the data may have been rushed out in an 
effort to keep up with the worldwide race for a successful coronavirus vaccine."
