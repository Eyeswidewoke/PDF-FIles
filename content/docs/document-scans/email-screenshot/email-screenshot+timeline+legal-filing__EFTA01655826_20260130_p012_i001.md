The Hill (03/12, Irwin) reported that U.S. Capitol Police defended their actions during a House hearing regarding the 
pipe bombs found on January 6, 2021, near the DNC and RNC, amidst the Capitol riot. According to the article, 
Assistant Chief of Police Sean Gallagher highlighted the chaotic nature of the day as a reason for the department's 
failures in properly responding to the bombs. The hearing, led by Rep. Barry Loudermilk, criticized the previous Jan. 
6 Select Committee for not thoroughly investigating the pipe bombs and focused on law enforcement's response 
after discovering the devices. The article noted that Gallagher acknowledged the police force's shortcomings, 
emphasizing that the lack of officers and the chaos contributed to the failures in handling the situation. Daily Mail 
(03/12, Raasch) added that Loudermilk said the FBI has failed to provide adequate detail about the individual who 
is still at-large. He also said at a hearing Tuesday there are still many missing details about the two pipe bombs that 
were planted outside of the Republican and Democrat headquarters in Washington, D.C., the evening before the 
January 6 Capitol protest. Further, the FBI, which is still leading the investigation into the plot - and has offered up 
to $500,000 to those with information on the bomber - declined to be a part of the hearing, casting a larger 
shadow on the current state of the investigation. "The suspect still remains at large," Loudermilk said Tuesday. 
"Unfortunately, the FBI has failed to provide substantive updates on the investigation despite numerous requests 
from congressional committees. Although it has been more than three years, we still have many unanswered 
questions," he continued. "According to the FBI, there are still no suspects as to who planted the devices." RollCall 
(03/12, Marquette) and The Independent (03/12, Hawkinson) also reported on the story. 
House GOP Report Alleges Jan 6 Committee 'Deleted Records and Hid Evidence' 
Fox News (03/12, Colton) reported that House Republicans have accused the Jan. 6 select committee of deleting 
records and manipulating evidence to suit a political narrative against former President Donald Trump. According to 
the article, Rep. Barry Loudermilk highlighted in an 81-page report that the committee, led by Democrats and 
including two Republicans, Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, selectively promoted information and hired Hollywood 
producers for their hearings. The report also alleged that the committee failed to investigate security failures 
adequately and focused unfairly on Trump and his supporters, with accusations of hiding witness testimonies that 
could challenge the committee's findings. 
Missouri Woman Sentenced to Jail for Repeated Probation Violations in Capitol Riot Case 
The Kansas City Star (03/12, Thomas) reported that a Missouri woman, Mahailya Pryer, who participated in the 
January 6, 2021, Capitol riot, was sentenced to 30 days in jail for repeated probation violations, including the use of 
methamphetamine and fentanyl. According to the article, U.S. District Judge Royce C. Lamberth revoked her 
probation, denying Pryer's motion for early termination based on a previous federal appeals court ruling. The 
article noted that Pryer had pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor count of parading in a Capitol building and was 
initially sentenced to 45 days of incarceration followed by 36 months' probation. Despite her regret expressed at 
sentencing, Pryer faced multiple probation violations, leading to her jail sentence without a subsequent probation 
period. 
Trump Was Informed of Prohibited Items in Jan. 6 Rally Crowd, His Driver Testified 
Politico (03/12, Cheney) reported that on January 6, 2021, Donald Trump's driver testified to congressional 
investigators that Trump was informed by his Secret Service detail about prohibited items in the crowd at his rally, 
indicating potential security risks. This testimony adds evidence that Trump was aware of the security concerns 
before the Capitol riot. According to the article, the driver described an exchange where Trump was told by Robert 
Engel, the head of his Secret Service detail, about the crowd carrying prohibited items, which Trump was agitated 
about. The testimony, which had been in the Department of Homeland Security's custody, was part of the evidence 
considered in the federal prosecution to subvert the election. The article explained that Cassidy Hutchinson's 
previous testimony to the select committee, which mentioned Trump's frustration over the crowd size and his 
demand to remove magnetometers, was corroborated by the driver's account. Trump has denied Hutchinson's 
claims, especially the one about him lunging at the steering wheel, a detail the driver did not recall happening. The 
article noted that this testimony provides a detailed view of Trump's insistence on joining his supporters at the 
Capitol and his disregard for the safety concerns expressed by his security detail. USA TODAY (03/12, Bagchi, 
Jackson) also reported on the story.
