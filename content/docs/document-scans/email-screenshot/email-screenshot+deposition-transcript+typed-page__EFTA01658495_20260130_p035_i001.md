Pennsylvania "took the first step on Wednesday to create a committee that would have wide-
ranging powers to investigate the vote, including the ability to subpoena election officials and 
members of the U.S. Postal Service while the election and vote counting are in progress." A 
resolution to create the "select committee on election integrity" in the Pennsylvania House of 
Representatives "passed in committee along party lines on Wednesday and could be voted on 
by the full House on Thursday." Pennsylvania Democrats "expressed alarm" that the proposed 
committee "could disrupt the election by subpoenaing ballots and bringing in election officials 
and others to testify before the vote count is certified." 
Appeals Court Rules Against Republicans In Wisconsin Voting Case. The 
Milwaukee Journal Sentinel (9/30, 632K) reports, "Republicans sought Wednesday to kick a 
lawsuit over Wisconsin's voting laws to the state Supreme Court," but the Seventh Circuit Court 
of Appeals in Chicago "quickly blocked their effort." It was "the second ruling against 
Republicans in less than 24 hours by a panel of three federal judges appointed by GOP 
presidents." On Tuesday, the panel "allowed extended deadlines for absentee voting to go into 
effect in Wisconsin." The decision was based, in part, "on a state Supreme Court decision from 
July that it said limited the ability of lawmakers to be involved in litigation involving the state." 
GOP lawyers "said they disagreed with the meaning of the state Supreme Court ruling and 
asked the appeals court to allow the state justices to weigh in directly on what they meant. ... 
But the appeals panel quickly rejected the request from Republicans to send the case to the 
state Supreme Court." 
Appeals Judges Uphold Lower Court's Order To Continue Census Count. 
The Washington Post (9/30, Bahrampour, 14.2M) reports a federal court of appeals Wednesday 
denied the Administration's request for "a temporary stay on a lower court's ruling that the 
2020 Census count should be extended." A three-judge panel on the US Ninth Circuit "found, 2 
to 1, that blocking the ruling would allow the Census Bureau to continue winding down 
operations as it had started to do before a temporary restraining order and a preliminary 
injunction this month." The ruling comes" a day after US District Judge Lucy Koh said she might 
hold the government in contempt after it suddenly announced Monday that the count would end 
Oct. 5."

northern California "are now threatening tens of thousands of homes." NBC's Miguel Almaguer

threatening twice as many structures. More than 24,000. Hundreds of homes are lost." The Los 
Angeles Times (9/30, 4.64M) reports that officials announced Wednesday that a fourth person 
"has died as a result of the fast-moving Zogg fire burning in Shasta County." The CBS Evening 
NewsVi (9/30, story 4, 1:40, O'Donnell, 3.95M) reported 30 lives have been "lost to fires in 
California since last month." ABC World News TonightVi (9/30, story 4, 1:50, Muir, 6.98M)

Denver Moves To Rectify "Decades Of Discriminatory Municipal Planning." 
The New York Times (9/30, Penney, 18.61M) reports that while white residents of most US 
cities "live near parks, trees and baseball fields...communities of color are left with concrete 
and the heat that comes with it." In an effort the Times says could "provide a road map for 
other cities, officials in Denver are working to rectify that historical inequity." The push, which 
"has been bolstered by an environmental tax that added tens of millions of dollars to the city 
budget," involves "purchasing land for new parks, repairing derelict playgrounds, adding 
recreation centers and planting trees in areas where shade is sparse." To the Times, addressing 
"decades of discriminatory municipal planning is especially important as climate change heats 
up American cities. Adding green space, researchers have found, can help residents cope with
