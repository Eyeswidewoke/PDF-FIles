entered our country illegally," she added. The article added that up to 45 percent of FBI agents working in 
counterterrorism, cyber, espionage and child exploitation cases were moved to immigration enforcement, 
according to data collected by the office of Democratic Senator Mark Warner. The article noted that critics have 
warned that the administration's government-wide response to immigration — combined with the mass purge of 
FBI agents and leadership — has left the nation in a vulnerable position and sharply reduced federal law 
enforcement's capacity to combat crime. 
Portland Protester Accused of Threatening to Kill Officers, Sexually Assault Their Wives at ICE Facility 
Fox News (11/23, Margolis) reported that John Paul Cupp, a 45-year-old Portland man, is accused of threatening to 
kill law enforcement officers and sexually assault their wives at an ICE facility. Cupp has been charged with making 
threats against a federal law enforcement officer and has a history of posting violent and aggressive content online. 
Director Patel told Fox News that the agency is committed to fighting extremism. "If you threaten to kill law 
enforcement officers or harm their families, you will face the full weight of the federal government," he said. "This 
FBI will use every investigative tool we have to identify violent extremists and remove them from our 
communities." The article added that Acting FBI Portland Special Agent in Charge Matt Torres said in a statement 
that threats against law enforcement have no place in the community. "Attempts to intimidate those sworn to 
protect the American people and uphold our Constitution degrade efforts to keep all of us safe," Torres said. "The 
FBI will use all investigative means available to us to seek out and arrest anyone using violent rhetoric to express 
themselves." Director Patel made a statement on X on November 25: "Yesterday, the FBI arrested a violent 
protestor out of Portland who allegedly threatened to murder officers and assault their families. Under President 
Trump's order to counter domestic terrorism and organized political violence, we are working aggressively with 
partners all across the country to take these offenders off the streets one by one."

Security operation in South Texas that resulted in 143 arrests tied to the Tren de Aragua terrorist organization, 
according to an FBI update. According to the article, the action followed the launch of the Homeland Security Task 
Force—South Texas, a new initiative led by the FBI San Antonio Field Office and Homeland Security Investigations, 
and the FBI said that 51 of those arrested were confirmed TdA members. The article noted that all 143 individuals 
were taken into ICE custody for immigration proceedings and that the operation involved a coalition of federal, 
state, and local agencies working to counter transnational criminal threats. Additional reporting on the story was 
provided by San Antonio Express-News (11/25, Zavala), KENS (CBS-5) (11/25, Carden, Lynch), KSAT (ABC-12) (11/25,

Continued Reporting: Director Patel and Deputy Director Bongino on ISIS Halloween Bust 
Broadcast coverage published by Fox News (11/25, Video) reported that the FBI thwarted a massive terror attack in 
Michigan ahead of Halloween, preventing the killing of countless Americans and exposing a global terror network 
with connections to ISIS. Eight suspects were arrested, including Mohamed Ali and Majed Mahmoud, who have 
been charged with transferring firearms and ammunition to support terrorism and providing material support to 
ISIS. The video highlighted that Director Patel and Deputy Director Dan Bongino stated that if the FBI hadn't acted 
when they did, "people would have died" and the entire global network may not have been exposed, with arrests 
also made overseas in relation to the plot. 
How an Innocent Woman's Name Was Tied to the Jan. 6 Pipe Bombs 
CBS News (11/25, Jacobs, Milton, et al.) reported that a federal security officer was publicly and incorrectly linked 
to the Jan. 6 pipe bombs until she cleared her name with an alibi, and that the FBI ultimately ruled her out as a 
suspect in the 2021 plot. According to the article, an unfinished ODNI draft memo naming her circulated among 
officials and caught some at the FBI off guard. The FBI has continued to lead the pipe bomb investigation and 
maintained that the bombs were viable but did not detonate. The article noted that the woman cooperated with 
the FBI, that an FBI spokesperson did not comment on the matter, and that FBI officials have said they are still 
pursuing leads in the nearly five-year-old case.
