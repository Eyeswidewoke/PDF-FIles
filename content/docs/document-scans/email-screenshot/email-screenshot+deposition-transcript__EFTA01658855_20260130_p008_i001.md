Bloomberg (11/30, 4.73M) reports the Justice Department argued in a filing with US District 
Judge Emmet Sullivan in Washington that former national security adviser Michael Flynn's 
prosecution for lying to federal agents should be dismissed because Flynn accepted a full 
pardon from President Trump. The Department wrote in its filing, "The president's pardon, 
which General Flynn has accepted, moots this case. ... No further proceedings are necessary or 
appropriate, as the court must immediately dismiss the case." 
The New York Times (11/30, Savage, 18.61M) says DOJ's filing "was accompanied by the 
text of the pardon itself, which had not previously been released." The Times says the pardon 
"was written broadly not only to cover lying to the F.B.I., but to foreclose any legal jeopardy Mr. 
Flynn might face from a future Justice Department arising" from his work as an unregistered 
foreign agent of Turkey in 2016, "his inconsistent statements under oath to Judge Sullivan and 
any potential perjury or false statements to [special counsel Robert] Mueller's team or to the 
grand juries it used." The CNN (11/30, Polantz, 83.16M) website, Politico (11/30, Cheney, 
Gerstein, 4.29M), The Hill (11/30, Neidig, 2.98M), the New York Post (11/30, Nelson, 4.57M), 
and Courthouse News (11/30, Mineiro, 2K) provide similar coverage. 
Parnas, Fruman Plead Not Guilty In Federal Court In Manhattan. 
Reuters (11/30, Stempel, Freifeld) reports Ukraine-born businessman Lev Parnas, "who once 
helped Donald Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani gather information" about Joe Biden, 
"pleaded not guilty to cheating investors in a fraud-insurance company, even after his former 
partner in the venture pleaded guilty." During a hearing Monday before US District Judge Paul 
Oetken in Manhattan, Parnas "and another former Giuliani associate, Belarus-born Igor Fruman, 
also pleaded not guilty to violating campaign finance laws and other charges in an amended 
indictment." 
The Washington Post (11/30, Jacobs, 14.2M) reports Parnas, Fruman, and a third man, 
Andrey Kukushkin, "are set to stand trial together. All are free on bail, though lawyers for each 
argued Monday that their ability to prepare a defense has been inhibited by the pandemic." 
Former Trump Advisor Says FBI Agent Used Alias During 2017 Interviews. 
The Daily Caller (11/30, Ross, 716K) reports, "Former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page 
alleges that an FBI counterintelligence agent used an alias during multiple interviews with him 
in 2017." Page is suing the FBI, DOJ, "and multiple current and former FBI officials over what 
he says was `unlawful spying' against him as part of the FBI's investigation of the Trump 
campaign." Page alleges "veteran FBI counterintelligence agent Stephen Somma introduced 
himself as Steve Holt during five interviews conducted as part of Crossfire Hurricane, the code 
name for the FBI probe." According to a retired FBI official, "an agent using an alias in that 
situation would be highly unusual." 
Biden, Harris Receive First Intelligence Briefings. 
The New York Times (11/30, Barnes, 18.61M) reports that President-elect Biden and Sen. 
Kamala Harris (D-CA) both received their first full intelligence briefings on Monday, receiving 
the President's Daily Brief for the first time. Mary Bruce said on ABC World News TonightVI 
(11/30, 6:40 p.m. ET, story 3, Muir, 7.69M) that "after weeks of stonewalling by President 
Trump...Biden today finally received his first Presidential Daily Briefing of classified national 
security information." Newsweek (11/30, Crisp, 1.53M) reports that it is "unclear what format 
Biden received his brief in on Monday. The transition revealed only the location where Harris 
received it but no details on format. Biden was at his home in Delaware on Monday." 
In a preview of Biden's receipt of the PDB, CNN (11/30, Gaouette, Marquardt, Salama, 
83.16M) reported that the briefing "could give Biden and Harris their first deep insight into 
urgent questions - including how Iran is planning to respond to the assassination of its premier 
nuclear scientist and what is known about that killing - and on longer term strategic concerns.
