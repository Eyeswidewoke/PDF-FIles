Continued Reporting: Director Patel Holds Interview at FBI Headquarters for "The Armstrong Williams 
Show." 
The Baltimore Sun (10/07, Williams) reported that, in an exclusive interview at FBI headquarters in Washington, 
D.C., Director Patel defended the bureau's handling of major investigations—including the manhunt for Turning 
Point USA founder Charlie Kirk's alleged assassin—while pledging continued transparency, accountability, and 
reform. Director Patel recounted that the FBI apprehended the suspect within 33 hours by mobilizing nationwide 
resources and publicly releasing enhanced surveillance footage, emphasizing that social media misinformation and 
conspiracy theories had complicated the public's understanding of the case. According to the article, Director Patel 
said the bureau is pursuing "scores of witnesses and companies" tied to the Kirk assassination and remains 
committed to investigating extremist groups, domestic terror threats, and foreign espionage, especially from the 
Chinese Communist Party, which he called "the greatest level of espionage against the United States." He also 
highlighted the FBI's expanded counterterrorism and counterintelligence efforts, revealing ongoing operations that 
have disrupted attacks in multiple states and emphasizing partnerships with social media companies to intercept 
threats, such as a recently foiled New York school shooting. The article noted that Director Patel contrasted his 
leadership with that of predecessors James Comey and Christopher Wray, arguing that the FBI's trust with the 
public is being restored through unprecedented document releases and congressional cooperation, asserting that 
"weaponization" claims are hypocritical and concluding, "We're just warming up."

COUNTERTERRORISM 
Violent Drug Gang Threatens US Tourists and Director Patel 
The Daily Mail (10/07, Chain) reported that members of the Los Chapitos faction of Mexico's Sinaloa cartel 
threatened U.S. tourists and Director Patel through banners allegedly displayed in Baja California after recent FBI-
led raids and weapons seizures. According to the article, the Spanish-language messages warned of attacks 
beginning May 10, 2025, against Americans in Cabo San Lucas and San Jose del Cabo if authorities did not stop 
"arresting our people and decommissioning our loads and weapons," though local officials denied finding the 
banners and said investigations were ongoing. The article noted that the threats came as the Trump administration 
declared the United States to be in an "armed conflict" with designated terrorist organizations, authorized 
Pentagon operations under the law of armed conflict, and imposed sanctions on Mexico-based companies accused 
of supplying chemicals to the Sinaloa cartel. 
Former LA Deputy Mayor Sentenced to Probation, $5,000 Fine for Fake Bomb Threat to City Hall 
KABC (ABC-7) (10/08, Staff Writer) reported that former Los Angeles deputy mayor Brian K. Williams was sentenced 
to one year of federal probation, 50 hours of community service, and a $5,000 fine after pleading guilty to making a 
false bomb threat to City Hall while serving as Mayor Karen Bass' deputy mayor of public safety. According to the 
article, Williams fabricated the October 2024 threat by calling his own phone, falsely claiming that a man angry 
over the city's support of Israel had planted a bomb, prompting a full police response and subsequent FBI 
investigation before he was placed on administrative leave. The article noted that Akil Davis, the assistant director 
in charge of the FBI's Los Angeles bureau, condemned Williams' actions as a betrayal of public trust, emphasizing 
that government officials "are held to a heightened standard" and expressing relief that Williams had accepted 
responsibility for his conduct. Hoodline (10/07, Levine) and Jerusalem Post (10/07, Marnin) also reported on the 
story.

COUNTERINTELLIGENCE 
US Law Firm With Major Political Clients Hacked in Spying Spree Linked to China 
CNN (10/07, Lyngaas) reported that suspected Chinese government-backed hackers breached the computer 
systems of the U.S. law firm Williams & Connolly—whose clients have included Bill and Hillary Clinton—as part of a 
broader espionage campaign targeting multiple U.S. law firms. The hackers allegedly exploited a previously 
unknown software vulnerability to infiltrate the firm's email network, and while the firm has since blocked the 
intrusion, experts said the attack was part of China's ongoing effort to gather intelligence on U.S. national security,
