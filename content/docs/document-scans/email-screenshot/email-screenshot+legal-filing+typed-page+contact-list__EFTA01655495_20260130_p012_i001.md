CNBC (11/07, MacBride) reported that the Trump administration's budget cuts and government agency gutting,

risk of hacks than a year ago, according to expert assessments. On Thursday, the Washington Post reported that the 
Congressional Budget Office was hacked by a foreign nation-state actor. "We were surprised and disappointed," 
said Ret. Admiral Mark Montgomery, the executive director of bipartisan group Cybersolarium.org, of its recently

forward by the bipartisan U.S. Cyberspace Solarium Commission, found that the US was slipping in its progress

Berkshire Warns of Al Deepfakes Impersonating Warren Buffett 
Reuters (11/07, Staff Writer) reported that Berkshire Hathaway warns that AI-generated deepfakes are 
impersonating Warren Buffett, with fake videos circulating on YouTube featuring comments he never made. The 
company highlights that the audio in these videos often features a flat, generic speech that is clearly not Buffett's 
voice, and may mislead those less familiar with him. According to the article, Warren Buffett is concerned about 
the spread of these fraudulent videos, which are made possible by the rise of deepfake technology and AI-driven 
voice tools, and can cause reputational damage and misinformation. The article noted that in May, the FBI reported 
that malicious actors had used AI-generated voice calls and text messages to impersonate senior US officials in 
attempts to access government employees' personal accounts.
