Section 3.2(b) - Requires the Payor to notify the Noteholder promptly =ut in any event no later than 5 business days 
upon the Payor becoming awar= of "any material adverse change in Payor's financial position.&=8221; What is a 
material adverse change? Too open ended .!=br> 
Section 3.4 also makes reference to the Initial Net Worth statement pr=vided pursuant to Section 5.1 and requires the 
Payor, as of December 31 =f each year, to maintain a Net Worth of not less than 110% of the then out=tanding principal 
amount. It defines net worth as total assets minus=leons total liabilities.? 
Section 3.5 prohibits the Payor from incurring "any liens or =ny debt for bored money if the incurrence of any such debt 
or liens would =ave a material adverse effect on Payor's ability to make the payment= contemplated by this Note as 
such payments become due." "Material Adverse Effect" is too =ague and open-ended. 
Section 3.6 requires Payor to "furnish Noteholder with such a=ditional information as Noteholder shall reasonably 
request in order to en=ble Noteholder to determine whether the terms, covenants, provisions and c=nditions of this 
Note have been complied with by Payor." This seems like a very broad license to re=uire Leon to provide info, 
particularly financial info, at any time. =This is especially true when terms like "material adverse effect"= are used to 
trigger reporting obligations and violations of debt covenants. 
Section 6.2. Waivers of presentment, demand, protest, notice of =ntent to accelerate, notice of acceleration of 
maturity, notice of protest= notice of non-payment, except as are expressly provided in the Note are n=t unusual or 
overreaching, but they do limit Leon's defenses to enforcement actions. The consent i= Section 6.2(b) to "all waivers of 
any term hereof", is probably intended a= a consent to the Noteholder waiving an enforcement term against the Payor= 
but could be interpreted to mean that Payor even consents to waivers of a=y term that provides the Payor with any 
protections like prior notice, for example. This should be modified to make it c=ear that it is only a consent to a waiver 
by the Noteholder of any enforcement term of the Note. 
Section 6.3 permits an assignment of the Note by the Noteholder withou= consent by the Payor. Leon's consent should 
be required if th= Notheolder wants to assign the note. 
Section 6.4 makes Leon responsible to pay any stamp or oth=r documentary taxes that are due in connection with the 
execution or deliv=ry of this Note. What are they? If there are none, then delete=this provision. 
Section 6.5 seems to make the Payor liable for the costs and expenses =f the Noteholder's "attempted enforcement" of 
the Note. That could be=read to make Leon liable even if the Noteholder improperly commenced an en=orcement 
action and Leon won that case. It should only be payable i= the Noteholder is the prevailing party. Moreover why not 
make this a reciprocal provision, so that if the Noteholder commences =ction and the Payor is the prevailing party then 
the Noteholder pays cost =nd expenses? Also, the Note provides that the Payor should pay the c=sts and expenses 
incurred in any workout? Why? 
Section 6.7 Jury Trial waiver is an attempt to exclude a jury from hea=ing a dispute over the Note because the amounts 
are so big, and that might=impact the ability to get a proper result. Why not arbitration?
