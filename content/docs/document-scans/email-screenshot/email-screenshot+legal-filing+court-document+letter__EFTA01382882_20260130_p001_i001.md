HI Rich — we're reaching out as Southern Financial holds 800 MBLY in account ending x804. As you likely 
saw - there is an MBLY currently tender offer that is set to expire on 6/16/17, for which a mailing should 
have been sent to you over the last few weeks. Regardless, we wanted to make sure the details were in 
front of you in case you had questions. 
Long story short — the tender was set at S63.54 per share for holders of Mobileye, N.V. (details are 
attached). The offer is subject to Israeli withholding tax of 25% unless holders provide an affidavit that 
they are exempt. Holders who are EXEMPT from Israeli tax must declare so by fully completing the 
attached Israeli Tax Declaration form to avoid the withholding. 
If you believe that Southern Financial is exempt — please complete and send us the Tax Declaration 
Form. The deadline to instruct and submit paperwork will be on or around 6/16/17. 
A few key points: 
1. 
Part I, section 7 (Contact Details): This is normally the beneficially owner. 
2. 
Part I, section 8. Select "through a Broker", and write in Pershing, LLC 
3. 
Part II, Be sure this is fully completed in the proper category (individual, corporation, 
partnership, or trust.) 
4. 
Part III: DO NOT COMPLETE—unless you are an Israeli Bank, Broker of Financial Institution. 
5. 
Part IV: Beneficial owner must sign. Unclear whether Power or Attorney or Authorized Individual 
will be recognized 
6. 
Part IV: Don't forget to enter number of shares! 
I will be traveling over the next two weeks, so please make sure to CC this group in case you have any 
questions. 
Thank you, 
Vahe
