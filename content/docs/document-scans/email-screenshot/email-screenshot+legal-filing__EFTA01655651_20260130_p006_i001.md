Fired U.S. Government Workers With Top Security Clearances Were Not Given Exit Briefings, Sources Say 
Reuters (03/04, Gardner, Landay) reported that some U.S. government workers with top security clearances, fired 
in recent mass layoffs overseen by Elon Musk, were not given standard exit briefings, posing a counterintelligence 
risk. According to the article, the lack of exit briefings means these workers were not reminded of non-disclosure 
agreements and were not instructed on what to do if approached by foreign adversaries. The article noted that 
Kevin Carroll, a former undercover CIA officer, said the failure to conduct final briefings for U.S. officials holding 
top-secret clearances was a "terrible" counterintelligence risk. "When you get read off the program, they remind 
you that you agreed to keep information confidential and it would violate the Espionage Act if you don't," he said. 
The article does not contain a direct FBI mention. An opinion piece from The Bulletin (03/04, Walton) assessed 
that Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) poses a counterintelligence disaster due to 
inadequate security standards when accessing sensitive U.S. databases. According to the article, the abrupt layoff 
of hundreds of thousands of US federal civil servants creates a fertile ground for hostile foreign intelligence services 
to recruit disgruntled employees.

CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS 
Democrats Lodge Complaint Against Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove in New York Over Eric 
Adams Case 
The New York Times (03/04, Bromwich) reported that Senate Democrats on Tuesday asked a New York committee 
that disciplines lawyers to investigate whether the acting deputy attorney general violated rules of professional 
conduct by demanding that prosecutors abandon a corruption case against Mayor Eric Adams of New York City. The 
request, filed by the 10 Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee, asked the New York group to determine 
whether the official, Emil Bove III, "should be subject to disciplinary action." According to the article, New York's 
attorney grievance committees allow lawyers to police their own. The committees, which work in private, can 
recommend disciplinary measures to an appeals court, including disbarment in extraordinary cases. The article 
mentioned that last month, Bove, a former criminal defense lawyer for President Trump, ordered Manhattan 
prosecutors to abandon their case against Adams. The order caused upheaval within the Department of Justice, 
leading to the resignation of at least eight prosecutors, including the acting U.S. attorney in Manhattan, Danielle R. 
Sassoon. The article noted that the Democratic senators cited Sassoon's resignation letter as they detailed their 
concerns to an attorney grievance committee in Manhattan, writing that Bove had "explicitly premised the 
dismissal of charges against Mayor Eric L. Adams upon the extraction of a political favor." The senators also noted 
that prosecutors have asked that the case be dismissed without prejudice, meaning that they could bring charges 
anew, calling the arrangement "inherently coercive." Forbes (03/04, Durkee), and CNN (03/04, Rabinowitz) also 
reported on the story. 
California Man Sentenced to Over Four Years in Federal Prison for Hate Crime Beating in Culver City 
CBS News (03/04, Rodriguez) reported that a federal judge sentenced a homeless man from California to more than 
four years in prison for a racially motivated attack in 2021. The DOJ said 38-year-old Jesse Allen Lindsey, a transient 
with a last known address in Fontana, pleaded guilty to one hate crime count in December 2024. Prosecutors said 
he was already in state prison on an unrelated conviction when a federal grand jury indicted him earlier this 
year. The attack happened on June 14, 2021, in Culver City. Investigators claimed that Lindsey punched the woman 
in the face after she did not give him a lighter or cigarette. The article quoted FBI Assistant Director Akil Davis, who 
said, "The facts of this case shock the conscience. Mr. Lindsey's actions were heinous, despicable, and inhumane." 
Michigan Man Sentenced to Prison for Distributing Child Pornography 
CBS News (03/04, Singleton) reported that a Michigan man was sentenced to 17.5 years in federal prison for 
distributing child pornography online. Ethan Eversman, 25, of Ionia, was accused of requesting explicit videos from 
a 15-year-old in New York and sharing the videos with another person, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office. 
Officials say Eversman was a corrections officer with the Eaton County Sheriffs Office. The article 
quoted Cheyvoryea Gibson, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI in Michigan, who said, "Today's sentencing of Ethan 
Eversman, a former Corrections Deputy, reinforces the FBI's unwavering commitment to enforcing the highest 
standards of integrity in law enforcement. Members from the FBI's Lansing Resident Agency, in collaboration with 
our law enforcement partners at the Michigan State Police, worked tirelessly throughout this investigation, in an
