General Michael Horowitz outlined the department's actions related to ransomware from April 2021 to September 
2023. The report also takes into consideration the takedown of LockBit, which took place in early 2024. The article 
added that the inquiry found three areas the D0J and FBI need to improve on to more effectively fight 
ransomware. The D0J needs a better way "to determine what metrics for the ransomware threat, including metrics 
tracking disruption efforts, are most impactful, and which demonstrate the effectiveness of its actions to combat 
the ransomware threat." According to the article, documents examined by the investigators found that "success" at 
the D01 in relation to ransomware is based on increasing the percentage of reported ransomware incidents "where 
cases are opened, added to existing cases, resolved or action was taken within 72 hours to 65 percent." The FBI said 
action was taken within 72 hours in 47% of ransomware incidents, an improvement on the 39% for 2022. The FBI 
and D0J also sought to increase the number of seizures or forfeitures in ransomware matters by 10 percent in 2022 
and 2023. The article noted that the report lauds the D0J and FBI for several infrastructure takedowns involving 
ransomware gangs like LockBit, Hive and AlphV — which allowed them to distribute hundreds of decryption keys to 
current and past victims. The FBI specifically has developed a strategy centered on targeting the actors, 
infrastructure, and finances that comprise and enable the ransomware ecosystem. The investigators said they 
believed ransomware disruptions — including the number of disruptions and the number of decryptor keys 
provided to victims — should be tracked by the D0J as important metrics of success. But according to the audit the 
D0J has not published an action plan around ransomware for the next two-year period nor reported any progress 
over the previous two fiscal years on performance.gov, as required. The article mentioned that Bradley 
Weinsheimer, associate deputy attorney general, sent a letter in response to the report concurring with the 
findings and pledging to work on the issues. FBI Assistant Director of the Cyber Division Bryan Vorndran similarly 
agreed with the recommendations and said the FBI would better define the role of the National Cyber Investigative 
Joint Task Force.

51 Arrested Globally as Police Dismantle Encrypted Network, Ghost 
The Epoch Times (09/18, Summers) reported that a global police operation has dismantled an encrypted 
communication platform called Ghost, which was allegedly used by criminals, leading to 51 arrests worldwide. The 
Europol-led operation involved a series of "coordinated raids and technical interventions" and took down Ghost 
servers in France and Iceland, according to Europol's Sept. 18 statement. According to the article, Ghost was used 
as a tool to "carry out a wide range of criminal activities, including large-scale drug trafficking, money laundering, 
instances of extreme violence and other forms of serious and organized crime," Europol stated. The European 
Union's law enforcement agency stated that 51 suspects were arrested: 38 in Australia, 11 in the Republic of 
Ireland, one in Canada, and one in Italy. Among those arrested in Australia was Jay Je Yoon Jung, 32, who is 
allegedly the platform's creator and administrator. The article added that an operational task force to tackle and 
track the network was established by Europol in March 2022, involving law enforcement authorities from Australia, 
Canada, France, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United States. A joint investigation team was then 
set up between French and U.S. authorities in January. Although the FBI was involved in the operation, there have 
been no arrests in the United States so far as a result of intercepted messages on Ghost. The Independent (09/18, 
Aodha) reported that the infiltration of the platform led to a series of searches carried out on Monday evening at 
27 premises across Dublin and counties in the east of Ireland, involving 300 gardai. Representatives from Europol, 
the Australian Federal Police and the FBI were in Ireland for the operation. 9 News (09/18, Staff Writer), Computer 
Weekly (09/18, Skelton), Aljazeera (09/18, Staff Writer), Info Security (09/18, Poireault), and BBC (09/18, Halpin) 
also reported on the story.
