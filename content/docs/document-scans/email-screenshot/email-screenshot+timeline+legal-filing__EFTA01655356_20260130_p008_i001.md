FBI Daily News Briefing 
Animal-Rights Activists Targets Vogue Editors at Their Homes 
New York Post (08/11, Settembre) reported that the Coalition to Abolish the Fur Trade (CAFT USA), an animal-rights 
group co-founded by longtime activist Tyler Lang, has been staging aggressive protests outside the homes of Vogue 
editors in Manhattan and Brooklyn, accusing them of promoting fur and labeling them "killers" through 
megaphones. Protest tactics have included chalking editors' names and social media handles on sidewalks with 
messages like "Leave our city," slipping flyers under residents' doors, and even entering apartment buildings—
actions neighbors have described as invasive and intimidating. CAFT USA is demanding that Conde Nast, Vogue's 
publisher, pledge to eliminate all fur content, citing a resurgence of fur in fashion worn by celebrities such as 
Rihanna, Dua Lipa, and Kendall Jenner, and claiming Vogue is "singlehandedly responsible" for reviving the fur 
industry. According to the FBI, in 2013, Tyler Lang attacked a family-owned mink farm in Morris, Illinois, releasing 
2,000 minks from their cages, pouring an acidic substance over two trucks on the property, and spray-painting 
"Liberation is Love" on a barn. 
Utah Resident Arrested for Allegedly Abusing Child and Uploading Video 
KSTU (Fox-13) (08/11, Martin) reported that Jodee Davis, a 31-year-old Salt Lake County resident, has been 
arrested by West Valley City police on charges of aggravated sexual abuse of a child and aggravated sexual 
exploitation of a minor. The FBI's Child Exploitation and Human Trafficking Task Force, acting on a lead from its 
Jacksonville office, traced the online upload of child sexual abuse material to Davis' home. A search warrant 
executed at the residence led to Davis' arrest and an alleged confession, with Davis admitting the video had been 
uploaded and distributed over 200 times online. Davis is being held without bail as federal and local authorities 
continue their coordinated investigation into the case. Additional reporting provided by Gephardt Daily (08/11, 
Staff Writer). 
Son of Missing Indiana Woman Files Lawsuit Against City and Police Department 
WFIE (NBC-14) (08/11, Calvert) reported that Thomas Rainey Jr., whose mother Donna Hatfield has been missing 
since 2019, has filed a federal lawsuit against the City of Boonville, its police department, and several officers, 
alleging they violated his constitutional rights by wrongfully targeting him as a suspect and arresting him on fraud 
and forgery charges later dismissed. Rainey claims the arrest was an attempt to coerce a confession, asserting he 
had legal authority to sell his mother's car under a notarized power of attorney, which police allegedly ignored. The 
lawsuit accuses the city of failing to train officers on constitutional protections and seeks compensatory and 
punitive damages. While the case moves forward in U.S. District Court, Hatfield's disappearance remains unsolved, 
with the FBI renewing public appeals and officials continuing to name Rainey as a person of interest. Additional 
reporting provided by Courier & Press (08/11, Harwood). 
Houston Gang Member Sentenced for Trafficking Girl Through Family-Run Brothel 
Houston Chronicle (08/11, Ferguson) reported that Hector "Pantera" Reyna, a 34-year-old senior member of the 
Southwest Cholos gang, was sentenced to federal prison for his involvement in a sex trafficking operation that 
exploited at least 13 women, including a 14-year-old runaway. As the leader of the gang's Bellaire set, Reyna 
manipulated one victim into a relationship at age 22 and later forced her into prostitution using fabricated debts, 
threats, and by branding her with a tattoo of his name. The trafficking network operated across six apartment 
complexes in Houston and a brothel in Cancun, which served as a recruitment and training site before victims were 
transported to Texas. The case originated in 2015 when the victim disclosed the abuse to a school administrator at 
Jane Long Middle School, triggering a multi-agency investigation involving the FBI, DEA, and Harris County Sheriff's 
Office. 
Alabama Man Sentenced for Attempted Child Exploitation 
WBMA (ABC-33/40) (08/11, Staff Writer) reported that Justin Warren Lindstrom, 43, of Shelby County, was 
sentenced to 10 years in federal prison for attempted enticement of a minor and possession of child pornography. 
He pleaded guilty in April and will be required to register as a sex offender, followed by a lifetime of supervised 
release after his prison term. The case was investigated with assistance from the FBI in Birmingham, as part of a 
collaborative effort to protect children from exploitation. "This sentencing confirms that the FBI and our partners 
will stop at nothing to protect our children from predators who seek to exploit them. Together, we have ensured 
one less predator is victimizing the most innocent and vulnerable members of our community," added FBI Special 
Agent David R. Fitzgibbons. Additional reporting provided by WIAT (CBS-42) (08/11, Goffin) and Trussville 
Tribune (08/11, Gurley).
