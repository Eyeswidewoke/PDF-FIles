Deutsche Bank Opens Probe Into Personal Banker for Trump, Kushner. 
The New York Times (8/2, Drucker, Enrich, 18.61M) reports Deutsche Bank "has opened an 
internal investigation" into Rosemary Vrablic, "the longtime personal banker" of President 
Trump and Jared Kushner, "over a 2013 real estate transaction between the banker and a 
company part-owned by Mr. Kushner." According to the Times, "Vrablic, and two of her 
Deutsche Bank colleagues purchased a Park Avenue apartment for about $1.5 million from a 
company called Bergel 715 Associates" in June 2013. The Times cites "a person familiar with 
Mr. Kushner's finances" who "said he held an ownership stake in the entity at the time of the 
transaction." At the time, Trump and Kushner were Vrablic's clients at Deutsche Bank. Banks 
typically "restrict employees from doing personal business with clients because of the potential 
for conflicts between the employees' interests and those of the bank." A bank spokesman said, 
"The bank will closely examine the information that came to light on Friday and the fact pattern 
from 2013." 
LAWFUL ACCESS 
House Members Propose Encryption Bill Backed By Barr. 
The Washington Times (7/31, Blake, 492K) reports, "Encryption legislation being considered in 
the Senate spawned a companion bill proposed Thursday by Rep. Ann Wagner, Missouri 
Republican, quickly backed by the nation's top federal law enforcement official." Attorney 
General Barr "applauded Ms. Wagner for offering the House bill, the Lawful Access to Encrypted 
Data Act, and said he believed it is needed to keep criminals from evading authorities." The 
proposal "has previously received firm pushback from cybersecurity experts and Silicon Valley, 
however, who argue it would effectively require companies to build so-called 'back doors' into 
their products. Proponents of the proposal reason that encryption allows criminals to operate 
undetected online by making it difficult to impossible for authorities to intercept and decipher 
their digital communications." 
CyberScoop (7/31, Vavra) reports, "It's just the latest series of GOP-backed bills 
introduced in the last year on Capitol Hill, including the EARN IT Act, that could degrade 
encryption's security and privacy benefits at the peril of all users, for the benefit of some law 
enforcement probes, security and privacy experts say. The EARN IT Act, which would make tech 
companies liable for content on their platforms, has already passed through the Senate 
Judiciary Committee." Security Week (7/31) also reports.
