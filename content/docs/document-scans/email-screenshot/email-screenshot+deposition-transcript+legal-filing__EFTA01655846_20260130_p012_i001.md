residents at even greater risk than the wildfires themselves. The article stated that the official cause of the fires is 
still under investigation. The FBI is offering a $10,000 reward for any information that could lead to the arrest of 
those responsible for starting the fire. 
New Sherri Papini Documentary Will Showcase Infamous Kidnapping Hoax 'In Her Own Words' 
USA TODAY (07/01, Limehouse) reported that Sherri Papini will now tell her side of the story during a multi-part 
documentary airing on the Investigation Discovery (ID) channel, concerning her arrest in 2022 for an apparent 
kidnapping hoax. The article mentioned that Papini disappeared on Nov. 2, 2016, while running in her Mountain 
Gate, California neighborhood. Following an exhaustive three-week search by authorities and Papini's family, the 
then-34-year-old was found on the side of a Yolo County, California road, bruised, chained up, and with a brand on 
her right shoulder. Once found, Papini told police that she was kidnapped at gunpoint by two Hispanic women and 
held against her will. Investigators determined Papini's claims were fabricated, and authorities believed she was 
staying with a former boyfriend in Costa Mesa, California, and harmed herself to make her fake kidnapping look 
real. According to the article, despite an FBI special agent and a detective with the Shasta County Sheriff's Office 
telling Papini on Aug. 13, 2020, that it was a crime to lie to federal agents, she continued to claim she was 
kidnapped, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office. Papini was even told by the agent and detective that they had 
DNA and telephone evidence showing that she was with her former boyfriend, but she continued to lie. The article 
added that in addition to Papini being sentenced to prison, she was ordered to pay $309,902 in restitution for 
losses incurred by the California Victim Compensation Board, the Social Security Administration, the Shasta County 
Sheriff's Office, and the FBI. The Rolling Stone (07/01, Richardson), UPI (07/01, Inman), and People (07/01, Cesaric) 
also reported on the story. 
Opinion: The Weaponization of Security Clearances 
An opinion piece by the Washington Times (07/01, Moyar) stated that twenty-seven months ago, the FBI 
suspended the security clearance of employee Marcus Allen after he questioned the agency's handling of the Jan. 6 
investigations. When congressional Republicans questioned the official who signed the clearance suspension, 
Jennifer Leigh Moore, she testified that the FBI "does not use a suspension as a punitive measure ever." Moore 
returned to Capitol Hill a short time later to say that the DOJ had revoked Allen's clearance because he had 
"expressed sympathy" for people who sought to obstruct the government by illegal means. According to the 
author, Allen's fate would have been sealed had his advocates not persuaded the department's inspector general to 
look into the case. The DOJ has yet to release the investigation report, but it is believed to have vindicated Allen, 
for it led the DOJ to reinstate his security clearance and compensate him for lost pay. The author provided the 
opinion that, with Allen, the FBI had used the security clearance system in a punitive manner, and on false 
pretenses. The author added that Allen's case extends a larger pattern of the weaponization of the security 
clearance system against political opponents and that it also provides further evidence of two-tiered justice, 
whereby supporters of former President Donald Trump are punished on dubious or unsubstantiated charges while 
Democrats go unpunished. 
Opinion: I Deeply Respect the FBI. It's in That Spirit That I Say They're Getting This Very Wrong 
CNN (07/01, Zandt) published an opinion piece where the author stated that they support law enforcement and 
are grateful for the excellent job the FBI does in keeping the U.S. safe every day. The author called on Director 
Wray to right a wrong by reversing his opposition to the potential parole of Native American activist Leonard 
Peltier. The author quoted Director Wray, who said, "Peltier is a ruthless murderer who has shown an utter lack of 
remorse for his many crimes. His release would strike a serious blow to the rule of law." The author claimed that 
the Director's words do not reflect the full story, and added that the historical context for this incident was the 
war that former FBI director J. Edgar Hoover was waging against anyone and everyone that he perceived as a 
threat. The author added that Director Wray's outreach in opposition to Peltier's release seeks to deny a 79-year-
old man on a walker not just parole, but compassionate release. The author asked why Director Wray would feel 
the need to defend Hoover's FBI by condemning Peltier to die in prison when he has been an integral part of 
making the contemporary FBI into the law-abiding organization in the righteous defense of the American people it 
is today. The author noted that it is their hope that Director Wray will do as much due diligence as he possibly can 
on this case and consider writing new letters, explaining that with additional light on the subject, and in the 
interest of American justice, Leonard Peltier should be released from prison immediately.
