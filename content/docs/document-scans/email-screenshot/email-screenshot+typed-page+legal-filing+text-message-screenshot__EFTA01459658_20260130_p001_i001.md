Among high-yield issuers in the United States, "riskier credits have an increasingly 
difficult time raising money in the bond market ", notes Gary Russell, High-Yield 
Portfolio Manager at Deutsche AM. "The decrease in liquidity combined with the 
low oil price has increased the expectations of defaults in the market." An additional 
negative factor are low recovery rates. According to Deutsche Bank research, the 
market may currently be pricing in an implied five-year cumulative default rate of 
almost 50% for U.S. high-yield bonds as a whole, assuming a 40% recovery rate. 
If, instead, a 20% recovery rate is assumed, that proportion falls to just under 40%. 
At the first glance, this may appear counterintuitive. The reason is that there are 
different ways to explain the same yield you observe on the market. In one case, you 
might imagine that many companies default, but default turns out to be not so bad, 
because for each default, the sale of each company's assets allows bondholders to 
recover a large chunk of what they would otherwise have gotten. In the alternative 
scenario, fewer companies default, but if they do. investors are only able to recover 
a smaller fraction of their losses. 
Both default rates implied by above calculation look excessive, not least because 
of energy issuers' declining share of the market and because we do not, as yet, see 
the broader U.S. economic recovery as being at risk. However, the recent widening 
of spreads and deteriorating liquidity conditions imply that things may get worse 
for U.S. high yield before they get any better. As a result, Deutsche AM is expecting 
default rates to be around 7% in 2016. Consequently we are increasing the forecast 
spread we expect to see in U.S. high yield by December 2016 to 800 basis points. 
Spreads are currently at 790 basis poinZ (as of January 21). 
Simultaneously, we are revising our end-2016 call for euro high yield, to 500 basis 
points. Our overall view on euro high yield remains constructive, as we expect 
default rates to be only 2.5% in 2016. 
With the exception of such international issuers as Petrobras" and Gazprom• 
from outside Europe, the Eurozone has little exposure to commodities-related 
companies, but higher rating quality and more robust investment flows. At the 
same time, Euro high yield has clearly seen some spill-over effects from the 
problems in the U.S. market. Contagion is also a risk for investment-grade bonds. 
Energy accounts for only 10 % of this market in the U.S. If oil prices stay low, that 
proportion is likely to shrink, partly because market values would shrink and partly 
because a growing number of riskier energy bonds would be downgraded. Indeed, 
some of the energy bonds recently downgraded from investment grade to junk 
stopped trading like investment-grade instruments well before the downgrade. 
In the short term, we expect forthcoming quarterly reports to show continuing 
trends of low earnings growth, slowly increasing leverage and weakening coverage 
measures. Key credit metrics (on a net-debt basis) remain in the middle of the 
historical range, but this adds little comfort as market-risk aversion increases. 
The recent spate of primary issuance has left support for the secondary market 
lukewarm at best. As in the high-yield segment, there are also strong signs of 
bifurcation; better credits have held up fairly well, while much of the selling is 
concentrated among less-credit-worthy issuers. Against this background, we 
remain positive on U.S. investment grade in the longer term. However, we are 
monitoring macro-economic developments carefully for signs of gloomier financial-
market assessments impacting the real economy.
