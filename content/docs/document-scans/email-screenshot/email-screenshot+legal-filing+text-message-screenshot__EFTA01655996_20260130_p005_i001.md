go after anyone who supports these trafficking cartels and leaders and members in any way, if they give them a 
paperclip, if they provide financial support, if they work for them, they're a hit man." According to the 
article, Pedro Inzunza Noriega and his son, Pedro Inzunza Coronel, were charged with narco-terrorism, material 
support of terrorism, drug trafficking, and money laundering as members of the Sinaloa cartel's Beltran Leyva 
Organization (BLO) faction. "It also gives us some extra territorial punch, if you will. It gives us the ability, if we want 
to, to dip into foreign countries," he added. The article explained that this approach allows for increased penalties, 
extradition, and the ability to charge anyone who supports or is affiliated with a drug cartel, with potential 
sentences of up to 20 years. 
How the FBI Started Treating Animal Rights Activists as Bioterrorists 
The Intercept (06/02, Sledge) reported that the FBI has been working together to treat animal rights activists as 
bioterrorists, with the FBI citing the potential spread of diseases like bird flu as a threat to the food chain. 
According to the article, documents obtained by Property of the People, a nonprofit, show a close relationship 
between law enforcement and agriculture industry groups, with the FBI sharing information with groups like the 
Animal Agriculture Alliance. The article stated that animal rights activists, such as those from Direct Action 
Everywhere, have been targeted and labeled as "animal rights violent extremists" by the industry and law 
enforcement, with some facing serious charges and prison time, like Zoe Rosenberg, who is accused of being a 
"biosecurity risk" for participating in an "open rescue" of chickens. The article highlighted that in a statement, the 
FBI defended its relationship with members of the private sector. "Our goal is to protect our communities from 
unlawful activity while at the same time upholding the Constitution," the agency said in an unsigned statement. 
"The FBI focuses on individuals who commit or intend to commit violence and activity that constitutes a federal 
crime or poses a threat to national security. The FBI can never open an investigation based solely on First 
Amendment-protected activity!"

Speculation 
The Washington Examiner (06/02, Deese) reported that President Trump is considering pardons for men convicted 
of plotting to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, citing potential flaws in the case. According to the article, 
the convictions of Barry Croft Jr. and Adam Fox are under scrutiny, with defense attorneys arguing they were 
manipulated by an FBI sting operation. The article noted that the case's integrity is being questioned, with 
journalist Julie Kelly meeting with pardon attorney Ed Martin to review alleged flaws in the FBI's handling of the 
case. "The number of FBI informants that were embedded in this operation, the undercover agents, what they did 
when they were introduced to the operation, how they targeted these men, how they organized various events —
so they got them stoned and drunk and then recorded them to use as evidence later," Kelly told the Washington 
Examiner. "Just the level of granular involvement by the informants and agents, but also how so much of it was 
dictated from higher-ups, including the handling agents out of the Detroit FBI field office." The article highlighted 
that the FBI's counterterrorism strategy came under fire during the prosecution of men accused of plotting to 
kidnap Whitmer, with critics alleging that the bureau's use of informants veered into outright entrapment.
