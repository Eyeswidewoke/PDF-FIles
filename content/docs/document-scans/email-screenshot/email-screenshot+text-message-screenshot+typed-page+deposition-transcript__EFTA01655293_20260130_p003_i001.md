Leonard Benardo indicated that Democratic operatives, including members of Hillary Clinton's campaign, planned 
to "put more oil into the fire" by involving the FBI and media. Senator Chuck Grassley described the findings as 
exposing "one of the biggest political scandals and cover-ups in American history," while officials such as CIA 
Director John Ratcliffe and Director Patel emphasized the need for transparency and accountability. The Open 
Society Foundations firmly denied the accusations, calling them "malicious disinformation traced to Russian 
intelligence:' According to the Washington Post (07/31, Strobel), the declassified document included in the Durham 
report showed that while the FBI investigated claims that Hillary Clinton had approved a campaign plan to tie 
Donald Trump to Russia, the bureau ultimately could not verify the allegations. The annex detailed email exchanges 
among Clinton campaign aides about using Trump's alleged Russia ties for political advantage, but lacked evidence 
of any formal scheme involving senior Obama administration officials. The report noted that some of the 
intelligence was obtained through Russian hacking of U.S. think tanks, but Durham's team was unable to conclude 
whether the materials were genuine or fabrications. Former intelligence officials maintained that Russia had 
interfered in the 2016 election to help Trump, and Durham criticized the FBI's inconsistent investigative approach 
to Clinton versus Trump-related matters. The New York Post (07/31, Christenson) added that newly declassified 
intelligence revealed confidential 2016 conversations between Open Society officials Leonard Benardo and Jeffrey 
Goldstein and DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz about discrediting Trump and deflecting attention from 
Clinton's scandals. The memos, allegedly obtained via Russian cyber-espionage, portrayed a deliberate effort to 
involve intelligence agencies or use the Steele dossier to push a collusion narrative, with Clinton approving a plan 
to "demonize Putin and Trump." The Post noted that these files were reportedly shared with DOJ leadership but 
never fully investigated, despite internal FBI disagreements on their credibility. Statements from Soros Foundation 
representatives and others denied any coordination or authenticity of the emails, while Durham's annex concluded 
the Clinton campaign may have hoped the FBI would escalate the investigation for political effect. The New York 
Times (07/31, Savage, Goldman) concluded that the annex undermines claims of a Clinton-led conspiracy, revealing 
that the key emails cited as evidence were likely fabricated by Russian intelligence. According to the Times, Special 
Counsel Durham determined that emails purportedly written by Leonard Benardo of the Open Society Foundations 
were almost certainly forged composites based on legitimate documents hacked from liberal think tanks. While 
Durham criticized the FBI for not exercising more skepticism during the Crossfire Hurricane probe, the report also 
showed that Benardo and Clinton aide Julianne Smith denied any knowledge of the emails, and Durham ultimately 
buried exculpatory evidence in the annex. The Times emphasized that while Trump allies cited the declassified 
report to support claims of political targeting, Durham's findings offered no proof of a Clinton campaign conspiracy 
and instead pointed to Russian disinformation as the likely source of the so-called "Clinton Plan" intelligence. The 
article highlighted that Director Patel declared on social media that the annex revealed "evidence that the Clinton 
campaign plotted to frame President Trump and fabricate the Russia collusion hoax." The Washington Examiner 
(07/31, Schindler) reported that despite their initial promises to tackle corruption, Director Patel and Deputy 
Director Bongino have remained silent on the scandal surrounding Charles McGonigal, a disgraced top FBI agent 
who went rogue and worked for Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, raising troubling questions about FBI 
management and values. McGonigal's case is particularly significant, as he was involved in Operation Crossfire 
Hurricane in 2016 and may have played a role in collecting false information used to smear Trump and his 
campaign, and his guilty plea and prison sentence have not been fully explained by the FBI leadership. The author 
suggested that if the White House is serious about unraveling Russiagate, it should investigate McGonigal and his 
circle. The press release quoted a statement from Director Patel: "The American people deserve the full, unfiltered 
truth about the Russia collusion hoax and the political abuse of our justice system it exposed. Today's 
declassification and release of documents tied to the Durham report is another step toward that accountability. 
The FBI will continue working tirelessly with our federal partners at the DOJ, CIA, and more to uncover the facts 
that should have been brought to light years ago. I'm grateful to Chairman Grassley for his steadfast leadership on 
this issue, and I look forward to our continued partnership in exposing one of the most shameful frauds ever 
perpetrated on the American public." Additional reporting on the story was provided by Washington Examiner
