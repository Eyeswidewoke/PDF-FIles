Pennsylvania Man Jailed Twenty Nine Years for Enticing Teens Into Producing Child Pornography 
WPMT (Fox-43) (09/05, Schweigert) reported that Michael Boyd Damgaard, 37, of Dauphin County, Pennsylvania, 
has been sentenced to 29 years in federal prison for producing child pornography. According to the 
article, Damgaard pleaded guilty in September 2024 to charges of producing child pornography and admitted to all 
offenses in a federal indictment, including producing, receiving, and possessing child sexual abuse material, as well 
as coercing minors into illicit sexual activity. Prosecutors said he contacted two victims, ages 14 and 15, through 
online platforms, knowingly engaged in sexual activity with them, created videos and images of the abuse, and 
persuaded both to send explicit images via messaging apps. The article noted that the FBI and the Pennsylvania 
State Police investigated the case.

FBI, Cybersecurity Experts Warns of 3-Phase Scam That Is Draining Bank Accounts 
KTLA (CW-5) (09/05, Tanner) reported that the FBI and cybersecurity experts warned about a growing "Phantom 
Hacker" scam that has stolen more than $1 billion since 2024, primarily targeting older Americans. According to the 
article, the scam unfolds in three phases: first, criminals posing as tech support trick victims into granting remote 
computer access; second, another scammer impersonates the victim's bank and convinces them their account is 
hacked and must be "secured"; third, a fake government representative pressures the victim to move their money, 
sometimes sending official-looking letters to maintain the illusion. The article explained that these scams use 
spoofed numbers, coordinated follow-ups, and sometimes AI-analyzed social media data to create convincing, 
personalized messages exploiting victims' interests. FBI officials and cybersecurity experts urged the public to never 
give remote access to unknown callers, verify all claims directly with financial institutions, and break the scammers' 
cycle of secrecy and urgency by consulting trusted family, friends, or law enforcement before acting. The article 
noted that victims should report such crimes to the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) or local field 
offices. 
China-Backed Hackers 'Almost Certainly' Targeted Canada During Theft of Millions of Americans' Data 
CBC (09/05, Tunney) reported that a Chinese state-sponsored hacking group known as Salt Typhoon, which may 
have stolen data from nearly every American, also "almost certainly" targeted a Canadian telecommunications 
company, according to Canada's Communications Security Establishment (CSE). According to the article, the U.S.-
led joint statement—co-signed by intelligence agencies from Canada, Australia, and others—warned that Salt 
Typhoon has conducted a "deliberate and sustained campaign" since at least 2021 against telecommunications, 
government, transportation, lodging, and military networks worldwide. The FBI said the hackers "recklessly stole 
personal data belonging to millions of Americans, and in some instances surveilled communications — all in 
support of the Chinese Communist Party," adding that the operation violated global expectations of privacy. The 
article explained that Canadian officials confirmed Salt Typhoon actors compromised devices at a Canadian telecom 
company in February to enable traffic collection, though they did not disclose which company was hit or how many 
Canadians may have been affected. Experts quoted in the article described Salt Typhoon as one of the most 
sophisticated and persistent cyber threats to Western infrastructure, warning that it represents a major front in the 
growing "digital battle space" between China and its rivals. 
ISP, FBI Investigating Sextortion Case Involving Indiana Rep. Maureen Bauer 
WBND (ABC-57) (09/05, Wolak) reported that Indiana State Rep. Maureen Bauer (D-South Bend) is the victim of a 
sextortion case now under investigation by both the FBI and the Indiana State Police. According to the article, 
Bauer's office said she was first notified by email on September 3 about a fabricated, digitally manipulated image 
intended to harass and intimidate her, and reports were filed immediately. The article explained that the image is 
considered false and non-consensual, and that creating, sharing, or distributing it could result in criminal charges 
under Indiana's non-consensual image and deepfake statutes as well as potential federal laws. Bauer's office 
confirmed the material has since been removed and that she is fully cooperating with authorities. The article noted 
that officials urged anyone facing similar threats to report them through Indiana's Cybersecurity Hub. 
Federal Cyber Information-Sharing Bill Renewal Inches Forward
