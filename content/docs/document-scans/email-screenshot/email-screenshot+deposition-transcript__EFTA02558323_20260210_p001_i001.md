430 Hell update 
Jeffrey,. 
Edwards/Bell is no different than Gulfstream service center, neither facilities complete the project on time. 
here is the window install update as of today,. Monday this week = was told by Edwards we where on track for 
completion Wednesday evening and go i=to paint shop on Thursday this week. 
I need your direction, are we willing to pay two days=20 of overtime charge for this weekend to complete Bell 430 
Sun=ay night? $4,800.00 additional Edwards gave me an estimate of $11,130.00 to install both windshields=20 labor, 
and I was trying to keep to that figure, however, yesterday&nbs=;the manager David Burch whom I've mention during 
the EFIS deal stated he was go=ng request additional money for labor since its taking his mechanics longer th=n 
anticipated to complete this installation due to the fact we are insta=ling heated bird resistant windshield on captains 
side, and only heated glass windshield on co-pilots side, David Burch stated its harder to shimm t=e windows when two 
different types of windows are installed. The du=l window change is by far the hardest task to accomplish on the Bell 
430, plu= the "risk of cracking the window" on the first flight, Bell =ould have to install another window at their cost, 
neither Edwards or ourselves =ant this to happen, so Edwards is taking their time and making sure the windows are 
installed properly. David Burch has assigned his thre= best mechanics for this install, this shop is quit smal= and employs 
only an estimated 11 mechanics. Bell is not willing=to pay the weekend overtime, I think its most important to get the 
helicopter=20 completed and ready to fly to St Thomas asap,. here is our =wo options: 
option #1 
Pay additional $4,800 labor to complete the helicopter Sunday night if=20 Edwards can provide the mechanics to work 
this weekend overtime. I need one=full day for painting the window edge trim piece. 
12th Sunday night window completion, 
13th Monday paint shop, 
14th Tuesday & Wednesday fly to St Thomas ar=ive by Wednesday night, a lot of tropical activity off the coast of Africa, 
I'd=plan two days to get the 430 to St Thomas could be one day weather dependant, .=20 Wednesday or Thursday fly to 
Zorro to be in position =or ABQ/Zorro to NY flight on Saturday the 18th. 
option #2 
No additional money paid for labor to install windows, window install=20 completed on Tuesday 14th or Wednesday 
morning 15th, Paint shop Wednes=ay night 15th, leave helicopter parked in West Palm Beach until after Gulfstream 
flight to New York. 
18th Fly Gulfstream to NY 
19th airline NY to Palm beach start heli flight to LSJ,. 
20th arrive in St Thomas, 
21st airline to NY in position for Gulfstream departure to LSJ,. 
pls advise option 1 or 2 ? 
Thank You, 
Larry 
arm rest update: 
The Toy store was completed with the arm rest by the time I ar=ived at their shop on Wednesday, I was pleased with 
their modific=tion to the arm rest, when arm rest is extended it rests on the l=wer seat bottom to firm the wobbling,
