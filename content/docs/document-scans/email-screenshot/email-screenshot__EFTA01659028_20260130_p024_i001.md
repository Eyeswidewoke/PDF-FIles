Rep. Scott Perry (R-PA) writes in an op-ed in The Hill (10/22, 2.98M) that the Chinese 
Communist Party "is an aggressive criminal organization, and...Americans are finally waking up 
to the threat" it poses to the US. The CCP has "allowed a local outbreak of coronavirus to 
develop into a global pandemic, all for its attempt at self-preservation." This year has also seen 
"the arrest of two Chinese military agents at the Houston Consulate for attempted theft of 
coronavirus vaccine research; the arrest of a NYPD officer accused of spying for the CCP;" and 
more. Perry is sponsoring H.R. 8491, a bill that would "designate the CCP as a transnational 
organized crime group and a member of the Top International Criminal Organization Target 
(TICOT) list."

Professional Gambler Sues Bharara, DO) Claiming Misconduct In Insider Trading 
Case. 
Reuters (10/22) reports, "Professional gambler Billy Walters sued former U.S. Attorney Preet 
Bharara and others on Thursday, alleging that leaks to the media were part of a conspiracy to 
violate his due process rights in the run-up to his insider trading conviction." According to 
Reuters, "The Manhattan federal court lawsuit seeks unspecified damages and a declaration 
that Bharara, former FBI agent David Chaves and other agents and prosecutors violated his 
Fifth Amendment right to a fair trial by leaking information about their investigation of Walters 
to the media. Walters was convicted in 2017 of insider trading charges and sentenced to five 
years in prison. He was released to home confinement earlier this year due to the pandemic." 
The Las Vegas Review-Journal (10/22, 345K) reports, "Walters, who served more than 
half of a five-year prison sentence before he was released because of the coronavirus 
pandemic, alleged that authorities tried to get Walters to incriminate himself over a wiretap by 
planting news stories. Federal prosecutors admitted in 2016, before Walters was indicted, that 
an FBI agent leaked confidential details of an investigation to reporters at The Wall Street 
Journal and The New York Times." The lawsuit named Bharara "and the Department of Justice, 
alleging prosecutors initially made no effort to stop the leaks or find the source. Walters went to 
trial and was found guilty in New York of masterminding a six-year insider trading scheme with 
former Dean Foods Co. Chairman Tom Davis. In addition to his prison sentence, Walters was 
fined $10 million."
