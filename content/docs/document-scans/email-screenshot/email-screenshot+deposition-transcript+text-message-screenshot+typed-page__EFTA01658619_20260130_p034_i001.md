won't allow "race or sex stereotyping or scapegoating in the federal workforce" and won't 
permit contractors "to inculcate such views in their employees." Such ideas, Trump said, "may

WTimes Analysis: Trump-Pelosi Relationship At "All-Time Low." 
The Washington Times (9/22, Dinan, 492K) reports President Trump hasn't spoken to House 
Speaker Pelosi "in nearly a year, though they have exchanged insults." To the Times, "rarely 
have relations between a president and a speaker been this toxic." Darrell West of the 
Brookings Institution says their relations are at an "all-time low." Adds West, "There have been 
other presidents and speakers who didn't see eye-to-eye, yet they maintained a cordial 
relationship and talked from time-to-time. Trump and Pelosi have not talked in a year and their 
lack of a relationship has ruined legislative policymaking and oversight." 
In Leaked Tapes, Mine Executives Detail Influence Over Politicians. 
The Washington Post (9/22, Eilperin, 14.2M) reports, "A direct line to the White House, but 
routed through a third party to hide it from public view. Easy access to Alaska's governor, as 
well as the state's two US senators. ... Those were some of the boasts made by two top 
executives of a company trying to build the Pebble Mine in videotapes secretly recorded by an 
environmental group and made public Monday." The Post calls the recordings "a rare glimpse 
into the private discussions surrounding the company's heated campaign to win federal permits 
for the project, which environmentalists say will destroy a pristine part of Alaska and decimate 
its world-famous sockeye salmon fishery." The conversations were "secretly recorded over the 
past month and a half by the nonprofit Environmental Investigation Agency."

of the aircraft, which was carrying Vice President Mike Pence and some staff." It then returned
