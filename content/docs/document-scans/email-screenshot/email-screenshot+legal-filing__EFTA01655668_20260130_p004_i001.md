article, the letter once again laid bare the tensions between the Trump administration and the FBI over the 
bureau's investigative actions during the previous administration. Director Patel, who started in the director job 
only days before, said in a statement that "there will be no cover-ups, no missing documents, and no stone left 
unturned — and anyone from the prior or current Bureau who undermines this will be swiftly pursued. If there are 
gaps, we will find them. If records have been hidden, we will uncover them." Additional reporting on the story was 
provided by New York Post (03/04, Nava), NY Sun (03/03, Rice), The Daily Beast (03/03, Martinez), The Hill (03/03, 
Crisp) (2), and The Independent (03/03, fLiddel). Fox News (03/03, Video) also published broadcast coverage of the 
story. 
Director Patel Disputes Whistieblower Revelation About FBI 'Honeypot' Agent Spying on -frump Campaign 
The Washington Times (03/03, Picket) reported that Director Patel is disputing a bureau whistleblower who 
identified a female undercover FBI agent as a "honeypot" who infiltrated President Trump's 2016 campaign. He 
took to social media to dispute that the female agent was not a honeypot. The article explained that a honeypot is 
an undercover operative who feigns sexual or romantic interest to obtain information from a target. "Just like when 
I exposed grotesque violations and fraud leading the House Intelligence Committee's investigation into Crossfire 
Hurricane calling out corrupt actors; I will equally defend those attacked falsely," Director Patel said. "A female 
agent was falsely referenced in the media this week as part of an alleged whistleblower disclosure- she was NOT a 
honeypot." The article added that the agent's actions related to the Trump campaign were also reviewed by special 
counsel John Durham, who also found no evidence of wrongdoing by her, he said. "I will always be the first to push 
for accountability from within, my track record has established that, but we do not establish guilt by association in 
this FBI," Director Patel said. 
Opinion: Director Patel's Vendetta Against FBI Headquarters 
An opinion piece from the Washington Times (03/03, Kessler) reported that Director Patel wants to shut down the 
FBI headquarters and reopen it as a museum, citing past violations of President Trump's rights. According to the 
author, Director Patel's plan to focus on violent crime and disperse agents from headquarters to field offices may 
compromise the FBI's national security mission and hinder its ability to counter terrorism and espionage. This 
approach may replicate the pre-9/11 "wall" that prevented information sharing between agents, which could 
increase the risk of a foreign terrorist attack, according to author Ronald Kessler, a former investigative reporter 
and author of books on the FBI. 
Continued Reporting: Dan Bongino Named Deputy Director of the FBI 
NPR (03/03, Dreisbach, McMillan) reported that on his show, Deputy Director Bongino has previously embraced 
conspiracy theories about supposed complicity of the FBI in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack; called for investigating and 
imprisoning former Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden; and discussed his own belief in the "spirit realm" and 
his view that some Democrats were infected with "demon energy." According to the article, Deputy Director 
Bongino is the first FBI director to win confirmation with the support of only one political party. However, 
Newsmax (03/03, Hall) reported that Deputy Director Bongino's background in law enforcement, public 
communication skills, commitment to accountability, understanding of national security issues, and conservative 
perspective make him a strong candidate for the role of Deputy Director. The article highlighted that Deputy 
Director Bongino wants the FBI to refocus back to its roots as the premiere law enforcement and investigative arm 
of the federal government. In the past, Bongino has sharply criticized the agency for focusing on so-called domestic 
terrorism, including targeting Jan. 6 protesters and pro-life activists. "These are threats to the United States?" 
Bongino asked his audience last year. "Grandma is in the gulag for a trespassing charge on Jan. 6." SLATE (03/03, 
Lithwick) posted an opinion piece on Deputy Director Bongino entitled: "Dan Bongino's Appointment Is a Slap in 
the Face to FBI Officers".
