Taliferro, who was fatally shot last month in Kansas City." Shannon Walz, 45, "was charged with 
illegally possessing a firearm and ammunition after Kansas City police arrested him following a 
foot chase in May. Shortly before, he was accused of threatening a witness to keep their mouth 
shut about a shooting that led to the victim's death weeks later." The Star adds, "The other 
defendant whose charges were announced Thursday was 20-year-old Maricela Delores Lozano, 
who was accused of stealing a car at gunpoint in July from a County Club Plaza parking garage." 
KSHB-TV Kansas City, MO (7/30, White, 90K) reports that Lozano "allegedly brandished 
an 'AK-47 style pistol' in a Plaza parking garage and demanded the keys and cellphone of the 
victim. A Missouri State Highway Patrol trooper spotted her in Fulton two days later and took 
her into custody, according to U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Missouri Timothy 
Garrison." Walz "was charged with being a felon in possession of a firearm in a criminal 
complaint unsealed on Wednesday. Walz was arrested by Kansas City police on May 30, nearly 
six weeks before Operation LeGend launched in Kansas City. Walz had allegedly told a person to 
'keep their mouth shut' about a shooting that had occurred the week before while waving a 
handgun 'in a threatening manner,' according to Garrison's office. The victim in that shooting 
died on June 10." 
Operation LeGend Prosecution Underway In Albuquerque. 
The Albuquerque (NM) Journal (7/30, Kaplan, 196K) reports, "The U.S. Attorney's Office is 
prosecuting what appears to be its first Operation Legend case in Albuquerque - charging a 
defendant with being a felon in possession of a firearm during an incident last month." Carlos 
Trevon Morris, 44, "was arrested by federal officers on Tuesday. But the incident, a homicide, 
happened more than a month ago and federal agents have been investigating it for weeks. In 
response to questions about what makes the case part of Operation Legend, a spokesman for 
the U.S. Attorney's Office in New Mexico said the main goal is to get guns out of the hands of 
convicted felons and others who are prohibited from having them. Last week, on July 22, 
Attorney General William Barr and President Donald Trump announced more than 25 federal 
officers are coming to Albuquerque as part of the operation, which is also being conducted in 
Kansas City, Missouri, and Chicago." 
Trump: Feds Will Not Leave Portland Until Governor Clears Protesters. 
President Trump took to Twitter Thursday to write, "Kate Brown, Governor of Oregon, isn't 
doing her job. She must clear out, and in some cases arrest, the Anarchists & Agitators in 
Portland. If she can't do it, the Federal Government will do it for her. We will not be leaving until 
there is safety!" 
The Hill (7/30, Chalfant, 2.98M) reports Brown responded on Twitter to Trump, writing, "I 
think we've had enough political grandstanding from DC. The President's plan to 'dominate' the 
streets of American cities has failed. We will protect free speech and the right to protest 
peacefully." 
Echoing the President, Deputy CBP Commissioner Robert Perez said on the Lars Larson 
ShowVi (7/30), "We're not going anywhere. We're going to remain in the city. The Federal 
Protective Service...along with the US Marshals, they are the ones charged with protecting that 
courthouse and those federal buildings. That said...we constantly and continually are 
collaborating and working alongside our state and local law enforcement. So we welcome and 
we've been wanting the sort of typical collaboration that we've always had there in Portland to 
quell this violence that has been occurring and all this criminal activity around the courthouse." 
Perez was also interviewed on America FirstVi (7/30). 
Police Move To Take Over Defense Of Federal Buildings. Reuters (7/30) reports 
that on Thursday in Portland, police "cleared a downtown park, making at least one arrest, as 
part of a plan for federal tactical police to leave the city following weeks of clashes with 
protesters." A day after Brown and US officials announced a phased withdrawal deal, "Oregon
