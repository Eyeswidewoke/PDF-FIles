Continued Reporting: Director Patel and Deputy Director Bongino Draw Scrutiny From Previous 
Supporters 
The Hill (05/21, Samuels) reported that Director Patel and Deputy Director Bongino sat for a joint interview with 
Maria Bartiromo on Fox News's "Sunday Morning Futures." According to the article, FBI leadership is facing scrutiny 
from the MAGA world due to their past statements and the reality of running a law enforcement agency. During 
the interview, Director Patel spoke about how his predecessors "intentionally failed the American public" and 
pledged that declassifying documents related to the investigation into his 2016 campaign's potential ties to Russia 
would help "restore the trust that was lost to the American public when it comes to the FBI." The article added that 
Director Patel and Deputy Director Bongino plainly stated that notorious financier Jeffrey Epstein died by suicide in 
prison. "I was asked about some of the details surrounding the Jeffrey Epstein case. I have reviewed the case. 
Jeffrey Epstein killed himself. There's no evidence in the case file indicating otherwise," Deputy Director Bongino 
posted on the social platform X after the interview. "I'm not asking you to believe me, or not. I'm telling you what 
exists and what doesn't. If new evidence surfaces, I'm happy to reevaluate:' The article noted that the FBI has 
racked up some notable wins in Director Patel's early months at the helm. "You're about to see a wave of 
transparency;' Director Patel told Bartiromo. "What do you mean?" Bartiromo asked. "Just give us about a week or 
two," he responded.

COUNTERTERRORISM 
IVF Clinic Bombing Suspect Was Linked to 'Anti-Life' Ideology. Experts Fear Its Growing Influence 
WIRED (05/21, Krishman) reported that the suspect in the IVF clinic bombing, Guy Bartkus, was linked to 
antinatalism, the belief that life is a form of suffering imposed without consent. According to the article, Bartkus' 
online presence revealed nihilistic ideations and a desire to minimize suffering, with statements indicating he was 
"anti-life" and opposed to IVF as a "pro-life ideology". The article explained that the bombing is believed to have 
been motivated by promortalism, a distinct ideology that seeks to reduce human suffering by preventing new life, 
according to experts like Katherine Keneally, director of threat analysis and prevention at the Institute for Strategic 
Dialogue (ISD). "The subject had nihilistic ideations and this was a targeted attack," Akil Davis, assistant director in 
charge of the FBI's Los Angeles field office, said in a press conference. Bartkus was attempting to live stream the 
attack, Davis added. Fox News (05/21, Rumpf-Whitten) added that a newly released video shows the moment the 
car bomb detonated outside the American Reproductive Centers fertility clinic in Palm Springs. The article stated 
that the incident is being treated as an act of domestic terrorism. Bomb technicians scoured the blast site over the 
weekend as part of the ongoing investigation, which was led by the Joint Terrorism Task Force. The article noted 
that despite significant damage to the clinic, all embryos and reproductive materials were preserved, and the 
facility has since resumed operations. Additional reporting on the story was provided by The Guardian (05/21, 
Visser), Hi-Desert Star (05/21, Moore), and Telegraph (05/21, Smith, Henderson).

The Associated Press (05/21, Kunzelman) reported that Taylor Taranto, a military veteran, was convicted of illegally

behind the wheel of his van. He stated that he had been "working on a detonator" and indicated to his audience 
that he would drive a car bomb into the National Institute of Standards and Technology. The press release stated 
that the FBI's Washington Field Office and the Joint Terrorism Task Force mobilized immediately to find Taranto, 
alerting regional law enforcement agencies of the potential bomb threat. The following day, the FBI discovered 
Taranto's location when he broadcast another livestream that showed him driving around D.C.'s Kalorama 
neighborhood. Law enforcement officers arrested Taranto at Kalorama and discovered that the bomb threat was a 
hoax. Additional reporting on the story was provided by Chronl
