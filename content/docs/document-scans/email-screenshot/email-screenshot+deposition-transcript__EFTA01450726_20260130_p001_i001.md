Subject: S Month Maturity, Greek Sovereign Paper, 2.5x Leverage (provided 
by us) Yields 10% [C] 
Classification: Confidential 
Summary 
As some of you may know we are in touch with a large block of illiquid 5month 
Greek paper. Levered 2.5x it yields 10% which may be of interest to those 
clients presently comfortable with Greek risk. 
The seller, a Greek bank who currently finances them with the ECB, is 
shrinking its balance sheet, we presume ahead of the upcoming AQR and stress 
tests. 
To diversified and well capitalized clients we can lend, with recourse, 
against this bond assuming 40% haircut (60% LTV / 2.5x leverage) at Euribor + 
270bp. In addition there is a 15bp arrangement fee on the loan amount (dirty 
price x 60%). 
we have been advised by the seller's agent (but are still in the process of 
verifying): 
"The bond is issued under local law - same as T-bills, and together with the 
August2014 floater is the only GGB bond (large size issues in any case), 
excluded from the PSI. These bonds were issued in 2009 by Greece as payment 
for the preference shares that the State got from all greek banks (in lieu of 
cash, which at the time was scarce). 
They are held primarily by Greek banks 
with 10-20% held by foreign institutions including ECB. The bonds have no 
collective action clause (CAC) and symmetric no cross-default with other Greek 
securities." 
Salient points 
The bond is a floater (vs 6m Euribor). Its last fix took place on 19th Nov 
2013 so both remaining cashflows due May2014, the final coupon and 
principal, are known 
Yield of 10% assuming 2.5x leverage for 5 months. Unlevered the bond yields 
5.6%. 
There is at least EUR100mm available 
These bonds are believed to be without CAC and with no-symmetric 
cross-default (note: still to be verified) 
This bond is illiquid. Some dealers make 2-3point wide prices in EUR1-2mm 
only. DB doesn't quote it. 
The higher yield reflects among other things a risk of restructuring. This 
risk is present in all Greek bonds. Personally I believe these shorter 
bonds have a lower probability of restructuring than the longer (9y+) 
ones... the seller's agent advises these bonds are 80-90% owned by Greek 
banks, the balance being owned by international real money + ECB. While 
Greece could conceivably restructure short dated GGB's held by Greek banks, 
restructuring a relatively small quantity of internationally held bonds 
would be highly counterproductive to Greece realizing its ambition of 
quickly returning to capital markets. 
In July 2013 the IMF estimated Greece had a 2014 financing deficit of 
EUR4bn. Various subsequent unofficial estimates have put this number around 
EuR2bn. Greek Government estimates have been closer to EURO.Sbn
