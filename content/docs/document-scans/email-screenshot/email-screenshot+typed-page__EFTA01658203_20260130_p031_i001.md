serious. We're going to continue to focus great energy and attention on it and partner very 
closely with your governor." 
Trump's Push To Reopen Schools Draws Pushback From Areas Where He Is 
Popular. The Washington Post (7/21, Balingit, 14.2M) reports President Trump has "launched 
an aggressive campaign to return children to school full time, threatening to withhold federal 
funding from schools that do not comply - which he does not have the power to do - and 
lashing out against his own public health agency's school guidelines." But he is getting 
"pushback even in places like Greenville County, [South Carolina], where Trump won by 25 
points in 2016, by school officials who worry that reopening schools could accelerate the spread 
of the virus." While Trump "has successfully drawn some Republican allies into his fight, 
including the governors of South Carolina, Florida and Texas," the Post says "many allies are 
resisting him. Shortly after the president began his campaign, West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice 
(R), a longtime supporter of the president, broke rank and postponed the start of the school 
year."

Nightly NewsVi (7/21, story 7, 2:15, Holt, 6.23M) reported that in advance of the school year, 
"summer camps have been viewed as a test run of sorts for getting kids back together in 
groups. But after an outbreak in one major US city, camps there are shutting down." NBC 
(Gosk) added that while "any educators see summer camp as the canary in the coal mine for 
reopening schools," there have been "mixed results." Park-run day camps in Miami "shut down 
early after four cases of COVID were discovered among campers and staffer[s]." Earlier this 
month in Missouri, "82 kids and staff got sick at an overnight camp...even with extra safety 
measures in place." Meanwhile, one day camp in Pennsylvania saw success this summer.

month." 
Florida Nursing Homes Report Big Increases In COVID-19 Cases. 
The CBS Evening NewsVi (7/21, story 2, 1:35, O'Donnell, 4.49M) reported, "cases keep rising 
in" Florida's "nursing homes: up 153% among residents and 126% for staff since June," and 
Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) "touted the state's COVID-only adult care centers, intended to keep 
seniors from infecting each other." 
NBC Nightly NewsVi (7/21, story 4, 1:55, Holt, 6.23M) reported, "There's a new warning 
tonight about the growing impact on older Americans." NBC (Sanders) added, "The Villages in 
central Florida, home to an estimated 51,000 retirees. Hospital admissions of Village residents 
with COVID have increased nearly 40 percent in just three days." NBC continued, "Health 
officials say it's been difficult to get a handle on the problem among the elderly in large part 
because nursing homes continue to be overlooked." NBC also reported that in Florida, "The 
number of infected residents and staff at elder care facilities has more than doubled in just the 
past three weeks."

across the country." ABC also reports, "COVID-19 symptoms are generally milder in children
