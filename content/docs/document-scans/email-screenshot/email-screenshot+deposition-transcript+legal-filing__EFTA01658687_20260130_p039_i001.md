invited into the salon in violation of city rules - setup or not - might have helped calm the 
kerfuffle. Instead, she kept it alive for another news cycle." 
Ernst Backtracks After Suggesting Coronavirus Figures Are Inflated. 
The New York Times (9/2, Gabriel, 18.61M) reports Sen. Joni Ernst (R-IA) on Monday "echoed a 
debunked conspiracy theory that Covid-19 deaths were being greatly inflated and suggested 
that health care providers had a financial motive to falsify cases." Ernst "said she was 'so 
skeptical' of the government's national statistics about virus fatalities during a visit on Monday 
to Waterloo, a city in northeast Iowa." On Wednesday, Ernst backtracked on "her skepticism 
over the death toll." She said, "Over 180,000 Americans have died because of COVID-19. What 
matters is that we are getting the resources to Iowa that are needed to fight this virus and 
continuing to support our health care workers on the front lines, and that's what I'm focused 
on." 
Coronavirus Cases Rising In Midwest. 
On the CBS Evening NewsVi (9/2, story 2, 1:20, O'Donnell, 4M), Carter Evans reported that 
"coronavirus cases are surging out of control" in South Dakota and in Iowa. And "even states 
where numbers are declining are seeing a disturbing trend." 
First Coronavirus Death Tied To Sturgis Motorcycle Rally Reported In Minnesota. 
The Washington Post (9/2, Shammas, Sun, 14.2M) reports, "A Minnesota biker who attended 
the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally has died of covid-19 - the first fatality from the virus traced to the 
10-day event that drew more than 400,000 to South Dakota." The victim was "in his 60s, had 
underlying conditions and was hospitalized in intensive care for several weeks after returning 
from the rally, said Kris Ehresmann, infectious-disease director at the Minnesota Department of 
Health." According to the Post, a little over two weeks "after the conclusion of the rally, the 
Midwest and the Dakotas in particular are seeing a spike in coronavirus cases even as infections 
decline or plateau in the rest of the country." 
Health Officials Urge Americans To Take Precautions Over Labor Day Weekend. 
ABC World News TonightVi 's (9/2, story 3, 0:35, Llamas, 6.93M) Victor Oquendo reported, "As 
the country heads into Labor Day weekend, doctors are warning about the risks." NBC Nightly 
NewsVI (9/2, lead story, 2:05, Jackson, 5.53M) reported that Labor Day presents "a possible 
turning point" in the battle against the coronavirus, as "experts predict if people don't follow 
the precautions this weekend, our progression against the pandemic might evaporate with an 
end-of-summer spike." NBC's Miguel Almaguer added that ahead of the holiday weekend, US 
health officials are "sounding the alarm." White House Coronavirus Task Force coordinator 
Deborah Birx and NIAID Director Fauci were shown "warning Americans need to take personal 
responsibility before making plans for Labor Day." 
Fauci said on NBC's TodayVI (9/2, 1.49M) that "when you have a holiday like Labor Day, 
we have seen after the Fourth of July, we saw after Memorial Day, a surge in cases. Wear a 
mask, keep social distancing, avoid crowds. You can avoid those kind of surges. You don't want 
to be someone who's propagating the outbreak. You want to be part of the solution, not part of 
the problem." He said, "What I would really like to see is kind of a full court press to get us way 
down as a baseline, so that when you get these cases in the fall, they won't surge up. They'll be 
controllable." 
Fauci said on MSNBC's Andrea Mitchell ReportsVi (9/2, 1.2M) that "we're right around 
40,000 new cases, that's an unacceptably high baseline, we've got to get it down. I'd like to see 
it 10,000 or less — hopefully less." He said, "We've got to impress upon people, and I'd like to 
do that now, that it's not only an individual responsibility, it's a societal responsibility" and "if 
we do that, I think that we can get through this weekend without seeing a surge."
