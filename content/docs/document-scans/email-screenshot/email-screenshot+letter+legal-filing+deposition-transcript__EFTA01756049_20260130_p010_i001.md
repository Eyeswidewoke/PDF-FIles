Secretary Kerry's=big bet on Middle East diplomacy can pay big dividends if backed by a forc=ful presidential 
commitment, a coherent strategic vision, integrated lines=of policy, and an active array of interagency tools of influence. 
The keys to success or failure now rest largely in Pre=ident Obama's hands. 
Ambassador Bloom=ield is a former US Special Envoy, Assistant Secretary of State for Politi=al Military Affairs and 
Deputy Assistant Secretary for Near Eastern Affair=. He is Chairman of the Stimson Center.

Israel Pushed=lran to the Table, Says Hagel 
Jeffrey Goldberg 
Nov 4, 2013 -- Last=week, Secretary of State John Kerry, the Obama administration's most fer=ent supporter of nuclear 
negotiations with Iran, by the conservative wing of the pro-Israel camp as a danger to the Jewish state, portrayed as 
someone who is soft on =ran and naive about the Palestinians and their intentions. 
<http://www.voanews.com/content/iran-world-powers-meet-nuc=ear-issues/1782679.html> 
These accusations a=e now mainly forgotten. Hagel has worked assiduously to ensure that Israel=maintains its so-called 
qualitative military edge over its foes; he has de=eloped close working ties with Israel's defense minister and its top 
generals; and Jewish groups, once wary, have =mbraced him. Last week, he spoke to a national meeting of the Anti-
Defamat=on League, and publicly confirmed that the Pentagon has fast-tracked the d=livery of six V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor 
airplanes to Israel. "They're going to the head of the line," he sai=. These are aircraft that could be used to stealthily 
insert commandos int= such hostile and distant locales as ... Iran. Still, Israel isn't getti=g all it wants from the U.S. --
specifically, the sort of munitions that could blast through the reinforced roofs of Ira=ian nuclear facilities. 
"I suspect the Is=aelis would like an inventory of everything, but certain things we do keep=as proprietary, and they 
know that," Hagel said. "On the standoff weap=ns piece, that's right on track -- the Israelis are signed off on that," he 
said, referring to weapons that can be fired=at targets from far distances. 
In a 75-minute conv=rsation, Hagel gave me his version of the Middle East crisis tour. Talking=with him, I found, was not 
like talking to Donald Rumsfeld. Interviewing R=msfeld at this table was like interviewing a razor blade; one wrong move 
and you'd get cut. Hagel, on the other han=, is tranquil, conversational, and very, very discursive. I found it diffi=ult, at 
certain moments in the conversation, to make out any obvious theme= in the Obama administration's approach to the 
region. This might not be Hagel's fault, of course. The administr=tion's current approach is, to borrow from Churchill, a 
kind of themeles= pudding. 
Circumstances have =onspired to curse Hagel with a challenging diplomatic portfolio, even as h= is forced to spend much 
of his time wrestling the Pentagon budget to the =round. It is well known that he is the main point of American contact 
for General Abdelfatah al-Seesi, the le=der of the Egyptian military junta; the two men have spoken more than 25 t=mes 
since the July couplike event that deposed the elected president, the =uslim Brotherhood's Mohamed Mursi. But Hagel
