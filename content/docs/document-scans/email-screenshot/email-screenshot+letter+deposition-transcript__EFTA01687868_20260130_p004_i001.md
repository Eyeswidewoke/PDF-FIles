; Aida Leisenring; 
Bruce, 
My apologies for the delay yesterday. The institution was short-staffed, and they were actively 
finding personnel to process you in the lobby and to oversee the attorney conference room area. If you 
experience any delays on the weekends, please ask to speak to the Duty Officer and/or the Operations 
Lieutenant as they were aware of the visit and could have expedited your admission to the facility. They also 
could have called me at home to resolve any issues. LikewisUfai are visiting during the week and we have 
made arrangements to expedite your visits, please contact 
and me if there are any delays so we 
can facilitate matters immediately. Please also let us know when you meet in an attorney conference room 
that has a non-working computer so that we can have Computer Services fix it expeditiously. We continue to 
work to address Mr. Tartaglione's complaints, so please let us know if there are outstanding issues that have 
not yet been appropriately addressed. 
Thank you,

While I do appreciate your effort, for reasons that aren't entirely clear to me, the personal seem unable to 
allow Nick reasonable access to his lawyers. 
Today, I arrived at the faculty at 7:56. I was told "not until 8:00" by the guard in the booth. At 8:00 I was told 
"we will let you know. We are waiting for relief." I waited outside for 35 minutes. 
(I am lucky to be healthy, as I was forced to stand because the waiting area was inexplicably locked). I finally 
got to see Nick just after 9:00, less than 30 minutes before the cut off to leave before the count. 
Unfortunately, this is not a recent problem. Long delays, unexpected closures of the facility and lockdowns 
have all occurred frequently since Mr. Tartaglione was first arrested, over 3 years ago and have significantly 
hampered our ability to communicate with our client, who is facing the death penalty. 
Because the BOP has chosen to monitor emails and phone calls between Lawyers and their clients, we are 
forced to meet with Nick to discuss every aspect of the case, even relatively benign things that typically 
could be handled with a quick call or a short email. 
As you know, I have been writing about these problems, speaking to you and bringing the issues to the 
attention of Judge Karas over the course of the years of Nick's Pretrial detention. 
On a personal note, this was a particularly frustrating day because I again took time away from my family on 
a Sunday to drive into NYC with anticipation that would be able to leave at 9:30. Today's trip, as you know, 
was necessary because Ms. Leisenring and I arrived on Thursday at 7:55 but were not permitted to see our 
client until 9:30.
