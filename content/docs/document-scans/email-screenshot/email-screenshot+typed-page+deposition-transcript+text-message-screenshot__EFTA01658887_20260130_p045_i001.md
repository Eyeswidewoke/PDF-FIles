Klein: Relief Bill Could Be The First Example Of Post-Election Bipartisanship. The 
Hill (11/15, Choi, 2.98M) reports Joe Biden's chief of staff Ron Klain told NBC's Meet The Press 
Vi Sunday "that passing a COVID-19 relief bill could be the first bipartisan action made after 
the election as the Biden team continues to wait for access government officials and resources 
to begin the formal transition process." Klain said, "There's a lot of things that are going to have 
to wait until Joe Biden is president, but this is not one of them. ... This is a national crisis. It 
needs bipartisan national action now." Klain "offered praise of Pelosi, insisting the incoming 
administration would 'have her back." He said, "What I want her to hear is that we have her 
back in handling this. But we have the backs of the American people. ... I mean...it's not that 
she hasn't been at the table. She's been at the table. We just now see the administration -
current administration - has walked away from the table. So, our message to Speaker Pelosi is 
keep doing what you're doing. To the Republicans, let's get this done. I mean, this could be a 
first example of bipartisan action post the election." 
Trump Allies See Newsmax As Potential Rival To Fox News. 
In an exclusive, the Wall Street Journal (11/15, Mullin, Chung, Hagey, Ballhaus, Subscription 
Publication, 7.57M) reports allies of President Trump see Newsmax TV as a possible competitor 
to Fox News among pro-Trump voters who view Fox's news division as insufficiently supportive 
of the President. Sources told the Journal that Hicks Equity Partners, which has ties to a 
Republican National Committee co-chair, has been in talks to acquire and invest in Newsmax, 
although Newsmax Media CEO Chris Ruddy said no deal was ever reached with the private 
equity firm. 
Judge Rules Wolf Serving Illegally, Invalidates His Suspension Of DACA. 
The Washington Post (11/15, Sacchetti, 14.2M) reports US District Judge Nicholas G. Garaufis 
of New York "has ruled that acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf lacked the authority 
to limit the work permits of hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants who came to 
the United States as children because his appointment to the top position in the department did 
not appear to be lawful." In "an unusual Saturday ruling" Garaufis "said...that the 'plain text' of 
the department's order of succession showed that Wolf's ascension to acting secretary did not 
follow established law and was part of several hastily crafted administration moves designed to 
get people into the top DHS position outside of standard operating procedures." The AP (11/14, 
Porter) reports Garaufis wrote, "DHS failed to follow the order of succession as it was lawfully 
designated. ... Therefore, the actions taken by purported Acting Secretaries, who were not 
properly in their roles according to the lawful order of succession, were taken without legal 
authority." 
The Washington Times (11/14, Dinan, 492K) says the ruling "is the latest blow to 
President Trump, who for more than three years has been trying to unwind the deportation 
amnesty for illegal immigrant 'Dreamers,' his predecessor began in 2012." The Wall Street 
Journal (11/15, Hackman, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) provides similar coverage. 
Miller: Americans Are "Not A People Of Perpetual War." 
The Washington Times (11/15, Wolfgang, 492K) reports in a written message to the Defense 
Department over the weekend, Acting Defense Secretary Miller made "clear that he'll use his 
brief time atop the Pentagon to implement President Trump's vision of winding down 'endless 
wars' abroad." In the message, Miller "stressed that the nation must continue its decades-long 
effort to defeat al Qaeda and other extremist groups" but he "also made clear that the 
American mission must change and that the U.S. military must adopt a more supportive role 
abroad." Miller wrote, "We are not a people of perpetual war - it is the antithesis of everything 
for which we stand and for which our ancestors fought. ... All wars must end. Ending wars 
requires compromise and partnership. We met the challenge; we gave it our all. Now, it's time 
to come home."
