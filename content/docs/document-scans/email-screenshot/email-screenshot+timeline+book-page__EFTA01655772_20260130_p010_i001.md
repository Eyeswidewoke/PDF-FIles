State Department Offers $10M for Information on Blackcat Ransomware Ring 
UPI (02/15, Wynder) reported that the U.S. State Department announced Thursday a reward of up to $10 million 
for information about anyone who holds a key leadership position in the ALPHV or Blackcat ransomware group. The 
State Department also is offering a reward of up to $5 million for information leading to the arrest or conviction of 
anyone involved in Blackcat ransomware attacks. The article added that the Blackcat group has targeted over 1,000 
entities globally since its inception, including networks that support critical United States infrastructure, such as 
government facilities, health care, emergency services, and manufacturing. The FBI in December disrupted 
Blackcat's operations through a decryption tool that enabled over 500 victims to restore their computer systems, 
saving them from ransom demands totaling about $99 million. The article quoted FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate, 
who said in December, "Helping victims of crime is the FBI's highest priority and is reflected here in the provision of 
tools to assist those victimized in decrypting compromised networks and systems,".

U.S. Charges Suspected Mexican Drug Lord Zambada With Fentanyl Crimes 
Reuters (02/15, Staff Writer) reported that U.S. federal prosecutors charged Ismael "El Mayo" Zambada, the co-
founder of Mexico's notorious Sinaloa drug cartel, with conspiracy to manufacture and distribute fentanyl, 
prosecutors in New York said on Thursday. Zambada founded the Sinaloa Cartel along with now-jailed drug lord 
Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, and U.S. prosecutors allege he continues to lead the organization from hiding. 
Thursday's fentanyl-related charges add to a litany of indictments for crimes relating to drug trafficking and 
organized crime. A DOJ press release quoted FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge of the Washington Field Office David 
Sundberg, who said, "As alleged, Zambada Garcia has, for decades, overseen the trafficking of tens of thousands of 
pounds of cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, and fentanyl into the U.S. along with scores of related violence, this 
superseding indictment is yet another example of our commitment to bringing cartel leaders to justice. We vow to 
continue to work with our domestic and foreign partners to dismantle violent transnational criminal organizations 
like the Sinaloa Cartel."

CAPITOL VIOLENCE NEWS 
Trump Makes Final Pitch to Supreme Court as It Prepares to Rule on Presidential Immunity 
The Washington Examiner (02/15, Deese) reported that former President Donald Trump appealed to the Supreme 
Court, seeking to pause his trial over 2020 election subversion charges, asserting that former presidents should 
have immunity for actions taken in office. According to the article, Special Counsel Jack Smith countered, arguing 
against delaying Trump's pretrial proceedings before U.S. District Court Judge Tanya Chutkan, emphasizing the 
urgency of proceeding with the trial months before the 2024 election. The Supreme Court faces a decision on 
Trump's request, which challenges the lower federal courts' rejection of his immunity claim and the notion of 
double jeopardy in relation to his impeachment and acquittal by the Senate for the same allegations. The article 
noted that the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, including two judges appointed by President Biden and one by a 
Republican president, had previously dismissed Trump's claim of absolute immunity. 
Jack Smith Used Donald Trump's Own Arguments Against Him: Legal Analyst 
Newsweek (02/15, Dobkin) reported that Special Counsel Jack Smith challenged former President Donald Trump's 
appeal for presidential immunity in the Supreme Court, regarding charges stemming from Trump's actions related 
to the January 6 Capitol riot. Smith argued against delaying Trump's trial, emphasizing the serious nature of the 
allegations and the public's interest in a quick resolution. The article noted that legal analyst Lisa Rubin noted on 
MSNBC that Smith effectively turned Trump's arguments on their head, asserting that the gravity of Trump's 
alleged actions to subvert the democratic process warrants prioritizing the trial over Trump's claims of political 
motivation and potential harm to his supporters.
