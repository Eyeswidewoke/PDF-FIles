I would like to renew my request that you arrange for Max t= resign as trustee for the marital trusts, and expeditiously, 
for reasons = will explain below. 
I have already spelled out s=me of the reasons why I cannot trust Max. I hope you have read those=detailed letters, 
which only tell part of the story, though it was more th=n enough. By now the situation has become completely 
intolerable.Q=A0 
During the years when Max was serving as=my lawyer, he saw no problem when the IRA that is my source of income 
was =eing depleted by distributions to 10 family members -- which alone amounte= to half of the mandatory 
withdrawals -- along with payment of taxes and m=nagement fees for the entire estate. All of that exhausted the 
annua= withdrawal, and the IRA was exhausted further by payments for the Wellfle=t house, Alex's medical expenses, 
and others that you know about, comp=lling me to make further withdrawals just for ordinary daily expenses, 
and=imposing the exorbitant taxes charged for such withdrawals. Max saw =o problem with that. He never suggested 
any financial accounting fro= any of the beneficiaries. I trusted him, mistakenly, as in the case=of the purchase of the 
apartment and the outlandish loan from the marital =rust, which I assumed would be for a few weeks until the 
Lexington house w=s sold, not realizing -- though he surely did -- that I would receive noth=ng for that and would be 
stuck with an expensive apartment I could not pos=ibly afford and a loan that I never would have agreed to had I 
understood.=/div> 
Now, all of a sudden, everything has changed. Suddenly= Max has all sorts of scruples and legalistic demands. What 
caused t=e sudden change? It is because now I am requesting that taxes be pai= by the marital trust. For the first time, 
Max insists on extensive =and of course outrageous) financial surveillance, claiming that as trustee= he is concerned 
with life expectancy (I might live too long) and with the=long-term effect on the trust -- matters that never concerned 
him while he=watched my IRA being depleted with payment of taxes and management fees fo= the entire estate, in 
addition to distributions to family. No scrup=es, no concerns, all fine as long as it was rapidly depleting my source 
of=income. 
To make this even more outrageous, the ma=ital trust is, of course, intended for the use of the married couple who 
e=tablished it, to be their main resource during their lifetimes, and the li=etime of the surviving spouse. That is the 
obvious intention of a ma=ital trust, and that should end the matter, within a family. But it =s even true of the wording, 
if we have to descend to legalities. Not=just for taxes, which is what I am requesting, but for daily life.
