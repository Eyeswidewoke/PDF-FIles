WPost Analysis: Dissonance Between Trump, National Security Team Shows Lack 
Of Strategic Approach To Russia. In an analysis, the Washington Post (8/1, Deyoung, 
14.2M) said, "The public dissonance between President Trump and his top national security 
team over Russia reached new heights in the past week," in some ways overshadowing what 
several experts describe as the Administration's lack of strategic approach to dealing with 
Moscow. For example, a former senior Administration official who spoke on the condition of 
anonymity said that to the extent President Trump "'undermines US policy,' it is not necessarily 
because of his lauding of Putin, but 'because there is no coherent policy." The official added, 
"There is no devolution to fill out the details of the kind of deals he wants to make." 
Detentions Of 33 Suspected Russian Mercenaries In Belarus Pits Minsk Against 
Moscow Just Before Election. 
The Washington Post (8/1, Khurshudyan, 14.2M) reported the detentions of "33 suspected 
Russian mercenaries near Minsk" earlier this week "have expanded an unusual run of tension 
between Belarus and Russia, once tight allies that have drifted apart as Belarus's president, 
Alexander Lukashenko, tests policies independent of Moscow's backing. The rare friction with 
Russia is now part of the backdrop for an Aug. 9 election that is expected to extend 
Lukashenko's 26-year authoritarian grip on power." However, "Lukashenko also appears to be 
using the showdown with Moscow to bolster his populist credentials and to try to discredit 
opposition candidate Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, a newcomer who has led a surprisingly strong 
campaign. Belarus claims - without making any evidence public - that the alleged mercenaries 
are part of Russia's shadowy Wagner Group paramilitary outfit and were sent to Minsk to 
destabilize the country ahead of presidential elections." 
CIA Declassifies Details Of 1970s Stealth Drone. 
Forbes (7/31, Hambling, 9.71M) reported The CIA's Project Aquiline was "a drone with a ten-
foot wingspan which would carry out spy missions deep into the Soviet Union." The CIA has 
"declassified a new stash of documents about the project from the early 1970s, revealing 
among other things, plans to fit nuclear propulsion and have it operating out of the celebrated 
Area 51." Project Aquiline never "became operational, for reasons which we will explore." But, 
as the CIA "notes in a preface to the new release, 'the concept proved invaluable as a 
forerunner to today's multi-capability UAVs [Unmanned Aerial Vehicles]." The project originated 
"in the 1960s." After the shooting down "of Gary Powers U-2 spy plane over the Soviet Union, 
manned flights were becoming politically too risky." Satellites could peer "over the Iron Curtain, 
but only provided grainy long-range photographs." What was needed was "a small, unmanned 
aircraft for strategic reconnaissance from close-up." 
Retrial Of Accused CIA Leaker Josh Schulte Delayed At Request Of Defense Lawyers. 
The Washington Times (7/31, Blake, 492K) reported a federal court judge "pushed back 
proceedings Friday in the government's longstanding criminal case against Joshua Adam 
Schulte, a former CIA engineer suspected of leaking classified documents to WikiLeaks." Senior 
US District Court Judge Paul A. Crotty "agreed to postpone a status conference in the Schulte 
case previously scheduled for August 3 in light of defense layers recently asking for an 
adjournment." The conference has been "rescheduled for Oct. 17, per the judge's order, 
indicating Schulte's yearslong legal saga is unlikely to come to a conclusion anytime soon."
