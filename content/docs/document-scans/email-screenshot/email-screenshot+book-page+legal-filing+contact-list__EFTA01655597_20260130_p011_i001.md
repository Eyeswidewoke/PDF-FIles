in federal court in Manhattan. Trump recently revoked government security protection for former Secretary of 
State Mike Pompeo and his top aide, Brian Hook, as well as his former national security adviser John Bolton, who 
have all faced threats from Iran after they took hardline stances against the Islamic Republic during Trump's first 
administration. 
Was a Guantanamo Confession Voluntary? A Judge Will Soon Decide. 
The New York Times (02/04, Rosenberg) reported that the CIA interrogated Ammar al-Baluchi 1,119 times over 
more than three years before he was ever charged in connection to the Sept. 11 attacks. At first, he was beaten, 
deprived of sleep, and kept shackled and naked in a secret prison in Afghanistan. Even after the brutality stopped, 
the questioning continued while he was kept in isolation and incommunicado during that time. Then, in 2006, he 
was transferred to Guantanamo Bay, and the FBI took over the interrogations. During those sessions, in 2007, 
Baluchi was fully clothed, with an ankle shackled to the floor. That is when he explained to agents building a 
criminal case against him how he sent money and provided other support to some of the hijackers who attacked 
the United States on Sept. 11, 2001. Now a military judge will decide whether that 2007 confession can be used 
against Baluchi at his death-penalty trial. According to the article, the central question is: Was his confession to the 
FBI voluntary, or was it the result of a campaign of state-sponsored torture that spanned his time in CIA custody? 
The Sept. 11 case is once again at a crossroads at Guantanamo Bay. Three defendants, including Baluchi's 
uncle, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, are awaiting resolution of a dispute over whether they can plead guilty in 
exchange for life sentences. A fourth defendant has been ruled not mentally fit to face trial. Baluchi is the only 
prisoner currently on the path to trial for the attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people in New York, Pennsylvania and 
at the Pentagon. The article added that for three days last month, between sporadic power outages at 
Guantanamo's court complex at Camp Justice, defense and prosecution lawyers offered starkly different portrayals 
of whether Baluchi was able to shed years of CIA domination to voluntarily help FBI agents who questioned him 
after his transfer to Guantanamo. The agents described those three days of interrogations in January 2007 in a 45-
page memo, which the prosecutors consider the most crucial evidence against him.

COUNTERINTELLIGENCE 
Ex-Google Engineer Faces New U.S. Charges He Stole Al Secrets for Chinese Companies 
Reuters (02/04, Stempel) reported that U.S. prosecutors on Tuesday unveiled an expanded 14-count indictment 
accusing former Google software engineer Linwei Ding of stealing artificial intelligence trade secrets to benefit two 
Chinese companies he was secretly working for. Ding, 38, a Chinese national, was charged by a federal grand jury in 
San Francisco with seven counts each of economic espionage and theft of trade secrets. The defendant, also known 
as Leon Ding, was indicted last March on four counts of theft of trade secrets. Ding's case was coordinated through 
an interagency Disruptive Technology Strike Force created in 2023 by the Biden administration. A DOJ press release 
noted that the prosecution is the result of an investigation by the FBI. CBS News (02/04, Fang), and Bloomberg 
(02/04, Nayak) also reported on the story.

CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS 
FBI Adds Alleged Leader of Meza-Flores Transnational Criminal Organization to Ten Most Wanted 
Fugitives List 
Fox News (02/04, Arias, Gibson) reported that the FBI announced that they have added the alleged head of the 
Meza-Flores transnational criminal organization to its Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list. The article stated that Fausto 
Isidro Meza-Flores, 42, also known as "Chapo Isidro," is accused of spearheading the Sinaloa, Mexico-based group, 
which the FBI said is "responsible for the possession, distribution, and importation of large quantities of cocaine, 
fentanyl, heroin, methamphetamine, and marijuana into the U.S." Meza-Flores' criminal activity has spanned over 
20 years, the FBI said. The article noted that ten years ago, Meza-Flores was flagged as one of three major cartel 
bosses remaining in Mexico. The article quoted acting FBI Director Brian Driscoll, who said in a video statement, "In 
addition to the scourge of illicit drugs Meza-Flores and his organization have unleashed into the United States from 
across our southern border, they're also accused of heinous crimes ranging from kidnapping and extortion to 
torture and murder." The article also quoted Special Agent in Charge Sean Ryan, who said in a statement, "For
