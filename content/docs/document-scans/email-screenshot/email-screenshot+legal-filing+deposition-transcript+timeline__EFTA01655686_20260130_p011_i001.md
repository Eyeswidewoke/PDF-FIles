information with Congress because the matter is an ongoing investigation. The FBI has asserted to Congress that 
[For Official Use Only] information and FBI email accounts and personnel names should remain non-public. Yet, 
here, Thibault sent all of that type of information to a private citizen while the FBI stiff-arms Congress and the 
American people." The lawmakers noted news reports released just before the November 2024 election containing 
potentially "classified U.S. intelligence" as a further example of DO1 and FBI officials sharing investigative 
information while ignoring congressional requests for the same. The article added that the senators asked the DOJ 
and FBI to open a criminal media-leak investigation to hold accountable those responsible for sharing potentially 
classified and other sensitive information to the press. Last month, the senators released internal FBI emails and 
documents that exposed a purported political scheme against President Trump by Thibault. According to the 
lawmakers, he went outside established agency protocols for opening probes to help launch the federal election 
interference case against President Trump. The New York Post (02/25, Christenson), and Daily Mail (02/25, Caralle) 
also reported on the story. 
Jim Jordan Confident Director Patel and Deputy Director Bongino Will Give Answers on FBI 'Soon' 
The Washington Examiner (02/25, Notheis) reported that House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-OH) 
was enthusiastic about Congress working with Director Patel and the recently announced Deputy Director Bongino, 
who he said are "two great guys" qualified for the job. According to the article, Jordan said he is looking forward to 
getting "answers" and weaponization documents from the agency. The lawmaker added that both Congress and 
voters are "entitled" to know why the Biden administration targeted concerned parents at school boards and that 
answers will be provided "soon," predicting within the next two weeks. The article added that Jordan confirmed 
that Congress has issued subpoenas to the FBI for information. Critical information he wants answers to include 
finding out who planted the pipe bombs on Jan. 6, who leaked the Dobbs opinion in May 2022, and who placed 
cocaine within the White House in 2023. "So we're just wanting answers that we think the folks we get the 
privilege of representing and serving would like to have answers to," Jordan said. Jordan's letter to Director Patel 
was delivered on Monday, just a day after Deputy Director Bongino was announced as the agency's deputy director. 
Prosecutors Conclude Army Veteran's Capitol Riot Pardon Also Covers a Separate Weapons Case 
The Associated Press (02/25, Kunzelman) reported that the DO1 has concluded that a military veteran's presidential 
pardon for charges that he stormed the U.S. Capitol also extends to his separate conviction for illegally possessing 
stolen grenades and classified information, according to a court filing Tuesday. Jeremy Brown, a 20-year veteran of 
the U.S. Army, was sentenced in April 2023 to seven years and three months in prison after a federal jury in Florida 
convicted him of weapons charges. Federal agents investigating Brown's alleged role in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on 
the U.S. Capitol were searching Brown's home in Florida when they found stolen Army grenades, an unregistered 
rifle and a stolen classified document. Brown's charges related to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack in the nation's capital 
were still pending last month when President Donald President Trump pardoned him and hundreds of other 
Capitol riot defendants on his first day back in the White House. The article added that the DOJ said it believes 
President Trump's pardon of Brown also covers his conviction in Florida. A court filing by the U.S. Attorney's office 
says it reached that conclusion after consulting DOJ "leadership." Politico (02/25, Cheney) reported that the only 
Jan. 6 defendant who appears to be facing continued prosecution is Edward Kelley, who was convicted by a 
Tennessee jury last year for conspiring to murder the FBI agents and other law enforcement who investigated him. 
Kelley has argued that President Trump's pardon should cover those offenses too — but so far the DOJ has said 
President Trump's pardon doesn't stretch that far. The Tampa Bay Times (02/25, Spata), MSNBC (02/25, Rubin), and 
the New York Times (02/25, Feuer) also reported on the story. 
DOJ's No. 2 Targets Old Office Where He Rose as a Prosecutor 
The New York Times (02/25, Goldman, Thrush, et al.) reported that Emil Bove III, the acting deputy attorney 
general, stood stone-faced and alone at the prosecution table inside the federal courthouse in Manhattan last 
week to do a job his onetime colleagues in the U.S. attorney's office for the Southern District of New York would 
not. Bove, who runs the day-to-day operations of the Dal under President Trump, was there to seek the dismissal 
of corruption charges against Mayor Eric Adams, a task seen as so dubious that two prosecutors in a prideful office 
known as the "Sovereign District of New York" resigned rather than carry out his demands to do it. According to 
the article, he lashed out at the office after the hearing. "There are no separate sovereigns in this executive 
branch," he wrote in a statement that also suggested his former co-workers prepare to resign if they disagreed. It 
was the latest chapter in Bove's estranged-family feud with the Southern District, where he rose to prominence as 
a top terrorism prosecutor and departed in December 2021 after a case he oversaw crumbled over procedural 
violations by members of his team. The article stated that Bove, 44, has quashed dissent at the Southern District is
