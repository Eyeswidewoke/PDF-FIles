Former Detective's Admission Prompts New Trial Request For Reputed Gang 
Members. The Baltimore Sun (11/7, Fenton, 1.33M) reported that defense attorneys have 
formally requested a new trial for five reputed members of the "Murdaland Mafia Piru Bloods 
gang." The request comes after Dante Bailey, Corloyd Anderson, Randy Banks, Shakeen Davis 
and Jamal Lockley were "convicted of racketeering in April 2019," based in part on testimony 
given by No Louvado, who has admitted that "he lied to FBI agents pursuing leads in the fallout 
of the Baltimore Police Gun Trace Task Force corruption scandal." The Sun article said the 
defense attorneys argued in their new trial request that their clients should have been made 
aware of Louvado's admission. 
FBI Probing Discovery Of Tracking Devices On Two Missouri Officials' Cars. 
The AP (11/6) reports, "Missouri Gov. Mike Parson's office said law enforcement authorities are 
investigating after tracking devices were placed on the vehicles of two administration officials." 
According to the AP, "The devices were found on the vehicles of Drew Erdmann, Missouri's chief 
operating officer, and Sarah Steelman, commissioner of the Office of the Administration. The 
Office of Administration procures goods and services for the state, while the chief operating 
officer oversees the management and distribution of state resources. 'Unfortunately, a governor 
staff member and cabinet member were victims of potential criminal activity that was tied to 
their roles as public servants,' Parson spokeswoman Kelli Jones said in a statement." 
The Kansas City (MO) Star (11/6, 549K) reports, "A private investigator says he helped 
install tracking devices on the vehicles of two high-ranking officials in Missouri Gov. Mike 
Parson's administration at the behest of a man working for a private security firm, spurring an 
FBI investigation." The Star adds, "For several days in August, two GPS devices monitored the 
movements of vehicles used by" Steelman and Erdmann, "according to Mike Bland, a licensed 
private investigator in Missouri. Bland said he was hired by John Wall of Asymmetric Solutions, 
a security firm based in Farmington, Mo., to track Steelman and Erdmann. He said Wall wanted 
the surveillance because his other company, the software firm Redlyst, hadn't been selected to 
provide facial recognition services to the state."

The AP (11/6) reports from Minneapolis, "A former Minneapolis police officer has been charged

Minneapolis police officer to obtain controlled substances, including meth, heroine and cocaine 
from September 2017 through October 2019. He got the drugs through deception, extortion 
and unconstitutional searches and seizures, prosecutors said. Jindra made his initial court 
appearance Friday and was released with conditions." US Attorney Erica MacDonald "said Jindra, 
28, of Elk River, was charged with 11 counts, including acquiring controlled substances by 
deception, extortion under color of official right, and deprivation of rights under color of law." 
The Minneapolis Star Tribune (11/7, Mannix, 1.04M) reports that Jindra "ran a scheme 
from September 2017 to October 2019 to steal drugs by means of 'deception, extortion, and 
conducting unconstitutional searches and seizures,' according to a grand jury indictment 
unsealed in Minnesota U.S. District Court Friday. This included confiscating drugs during a 
search without his partner looking, then failing to log them as evidence or filing a report, 
according to the indictment. Jindra pocketed drugs turned in to police by a concerned citizen 
and skimmed from bags before logging them into evidence, according to the indictment. In one
