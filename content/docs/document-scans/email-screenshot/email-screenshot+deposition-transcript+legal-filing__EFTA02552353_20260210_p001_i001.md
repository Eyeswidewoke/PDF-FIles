I suspect that forcing children to do anything is probably=harmful. But it's possible to introduce writing and

). Back in the early =#39;50s, a philosopher friend of mine (Israel Scheffler) brought me some p=ges on which his two-
year old son had written things that he thought were =ibberish, wondering if I could make something of it. It was 
immediat=ly obvious that the kind had learned the names of the letters and was spon=aneously stringing them together 
to express himself in writing. And raking interesting generalizations. Thus the letter "A", pr=nounced /ey/, he used for 
the words "came," "pet", &qu=t;pat"; the letter "i", pronounced /ay/, he used for "=ie", "pot," "but," . And so on. It all 
made=sense. Our kids did the same thing. Carol wrote some papers ab=ut it, Charles Read and others carried it 
forward. Turns out to be a=great way to teach reading too. Kids spontaneously express themselves, oft=n in creative 
way, and the transition to official orthography is not that =ifficult now that they have the general idea. 
The=e's a debate about it in educational circles, and though I haven't=followed it, my impression is that old-fashioned 
forcing into a mold proba=ly wins out, undermining the joy of self-expression and possibly reading.<=div>

Shortly after, the same observati=n was made about the more fundamental matter of sounds (Port Royal Grammar=
