"The Armenian military rejected the claim as a 'cynical lie." The AP reports that Azerbaijani 
President Ilham Aliyev "has said that to end hostilities Armenian forces must withdraw from 
Nagorno-Karabakh. He has insisted that Azerbaijan has the right to reclaim its territory by force 
since nearly three decades of international mediation hasn't yielded progress." Reuters (10/22) 
reports that on Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin "said...Moscow believed that nearly 
5,000 people had been killed." Putin is quoted as saying, "There are a lot of casualties from 
both sides, more than 2,000 from each side." 
Sudanese Government Prepared To Normalize Relations With Israel As Part Of US 
Deal. 
Reuters (10/22, Abdelaziz) reports that Sudan's Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok is "ready to 
proceed with normalizing relations with Israel once a yet-to-be-formed transitional parliament 
has approved the step," according to "two Sudanese government sources." Reuters says "the 
comments are the clearest sign that Hamdok, under pressure from the United States, is willing 
to contemplate Sudan establishing ties with former adversary Israel." However, "such a move 
would not be imminent, because the parliament still needs to be established under a power-
sharing deal between the military officers and civilians who have been running Sudan jointly 
since the overthrow of autocrat Omar al-Bashir in 2019." 
The AP (10/22, Federman, Magdy) reports that on Thursday, Sudanese officials 
"confirmed...that a senior U.S.-Israeli delegation flew to Sudan on a private jet this week to 
wrap up a deal that would make Sudan the third Arab country to normalize ties with Israel this 
year." The AP says "such a deal would deepen Sudan's engagement with the West after 
President Donald Trump's conditional agreement this week to remove the North African nation 
from the list of state sponsors of terrorism." 
Hariri Named Lebanon's Prime Minister For Fourth Time. 
Reuters (10/22, Francis, Dahan) reports that on Thursday, Saad al-Hariri was named Lebanon's 
prime minister "for a fourth time...and pledged to form a new government to tackle the 
country's worst crisis since its 1975-1990 civil war." According to Reuters, "after his nomination, 
Hariri said he would quickly form a cabinet of specialists to bring in economic and financial 
reforms set out in a French plan to get foreign aid. But he faces major challenges to navigate 
Lebanon's sectarian politics to agree a cabinet, which must then fix a mounting list of woes: a 
banking crisis, currency crash, rising poverty and state debts." 
The Washington Post (10/22, Dadouch, 14.2M) says, "Hariri's return as prime minister 
brings Lebanon back full circle, fueling anger at a static political system that has been 
controlled by the same families for decades." The Post adds, "His designation came amid one of 
Lebanon's most tumultuous periods: The spread of the novel coronavirus and government-
enforced lockdowns exacerbated a titanic economic struggle - but both crises briefly paled in 
comparison to a massive blast that tore through the capital, Beirut, on Aug. 4, killing nearly 
200 people and damaging much of the city." 
Nigeria's Buhari Does Not Mention Shooting Of Protesters In Speech On Unrest. 
The AP (10/22, Olukoya) reports Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari "spoke to the nation 
about the unrest that has gripped the country in recent days, but without making any mention 
of the shootings of peaceful protesters at Lekki toll plaza on Tuesday night that prompted 
international outrage." Buhari "called on Nigeria's youths 'to discontinue the street protests and 
constructively engage the government in finding solutions. Your voice has been heard loud and 
clear and we are responding." Reuters (10/22, Onuah, George) says the unrest "has become a 
political crisis for Buhari, a former military leader who came to power at the ballot box in 2015 
and is commander-in-chief of the armed forces."
