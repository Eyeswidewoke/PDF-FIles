PROTESTS 
NYTimes Analysis: Majority Of Cases Against Protesters Dismissed In Court. 
The New York Times (11/19, Al, MacFarquhar, 18.61M) reports that "more than five months" 
after protests over the deaths of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, "a vast majority of cases 
against protesters are being dismissed" in the courtroom and "only cases involving more 
substantial charges like property destruction or other violence remain." Prosecutors "called the 
scale of both the mass arrests and mass dismissals...unrivaled, at least since the civil rights 
protests of the early 1960s," testing "the limitations of the court system." Many cases have 
been dropped as prosecutors "concluded that the protesters were exercising their basic civil 
rights," cases which "rarely succeed in court." 
Federal Lawsuit Against Chicago Police Alleges "Brutal Attacks On Protesters." 
USA Today (11/19, Hauck, 10.31M) reports that Chicago "police officers used 'brutal, violent 
and unconstitutional tactics' to quell protests over the killings of Black Americans last summer, 
with victims claiming they were beaten with batons and sprayed with chemicals, a federal 
lawsuit filed Thursday alleges." Civil rights attorneys "filed the 203-page suit on behalf of 60" 
plaintiffs, claiming "violations of protesters' First, Fourth and fourteenth Amendment rights and 
more." The 17-count suit "names Chicago Police Superintendent David Brown, along with 20 
officers." Chicago's law department spokesperson Kathleen Fieweger said, "It is important to 
remember that these are allegations at this stage and not proof." 
WPost Analysis: Rittenhouse, Rosenbaum's Encounter "Divided The Nation." 
The Washington Post (11/19, Lee, O'Harrow, Samuels, 14.2M) reports that an "examination of 
video and police records, along with other documents, sheds new light on the mindsets" of 17-
year-old Kyle Rittenhouse and 36-year-old Joseph Rosenbaum during protests in Kenosha, 
Wisconsin following the police shooting of Jacob Blake. The Post says Rittenhouse, "a gun 
enthusiast," thought "of himself as a medic." In his first public comments "since his arrest," 
Rittenhouse "said he did not regret that he had a gun that night," despite being too young to 
own a rifle. Rittenhouse said, "I feel I had to protect myself. I would have died that night if I 
didn't." 
Rittenhouse Says He Used Stimulus Money To Buy Gun. The Hill (11/19, Coleman, 
2.98M) reports, "Accused Kenosha, Wis., shooter Kyle Rittenhouse told The Washington Post 
that he used stimulus money from the government to buy his gun in an interview published 
Thursday." Rittenhouse, "who at 17 was too young to buy a rifle, had an adult friend purchase 
the AR-15 for him using stimulus money he got through an Illinois unemployment program 
when he was furloughed due to the pandemic. 'I got my twelve hundred dollars from the 
coronavirus Illinois unemployment 'cause I was on furlough from YMCA,' he said. 'And I got my 
first unemployment check, so I was like, "Oh, Ill use this to buy it."' A family friend Dominick 
Black bought the gun for Rittenhouse in the spring of 2020, the Post reported, citing 
Rittenhouse and statements Black gave police."
