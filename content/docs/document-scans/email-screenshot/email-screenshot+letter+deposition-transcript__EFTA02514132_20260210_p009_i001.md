dollars to Max for things like making a will, which, when he finally sent it to us, was so outlandish that we simpl= trashed 
it -- for example, with a demand that we list all of our tangible assets, including teaspoons and pillow cases, presumably 
to make sure that nothing would go to Valeria. And other such conditions. So yes, those were expenses. If you know of 
other ones, please let me know. 
You clearly trust Max and are accepting his version of events and circumstances rather than mine. That surprises me, 
but to repeat,=C24)I don't trust him at all, for good reasons, which I've explained repe=tedly -- leaving out a fair amount. 
Could add more, but won't. To go back to the beginning, I fin= it difficult to understand why you are persisting in these 
inquiries. We are a family. We care for each other. I don't unders=and why you are doing this. 
=br> 
There are some other reasons why it looks simple to me, and I think it would be helpful to make them clear and open. 
Throughout this whole business, thoughts have been coming to my mind that I'm sure must have occurred to you too. 
Namely my own experiences= 
When my mother died, in 1972, my father was 78 years old, not a good time to be alone. Knew that well enough then, 
but it came home like a hammer blow when Mommoy was diagnosed in 2006 with incurable brain and lung cancer, and I 
was privately told by her physician that she had at most months to live -- never told her of course. I couldn't help 
realizing that if I had died before her, and she was alone, she would have had to be put in some facility where she would 
suffer and die soon in miser=. Since I was there, I could take care of her at home and to the great surpri=e of her 
doctors, she had two years that were tolerable and sometimes very enjoyable even as she wasted away and reverted to 
infancy, and was able to pass away in peace, at home. 
i didn't think of all of that when my mother died, but I did understand enough to realize -- we all did -- that my father 
was facing a very difficu=t and dangerous period. 
We were therefore all delighted when, a year later, he met and married Ruth. They spent the rest of his life together, 
happy and secure, and he too was able to pass away at home, in peace, his wife taking care of him and his children and 
Judy nearby. 
We were, of course, very grateful that he had found Ruth, and very grateful to her. David and I owned the house, but of 
course we just gave it to her for the rest of her life, and for whatever she wanted to do with it. 
There was never a question, a problem, a concern. All entirely natura= within a family, very simple. 
Like other cases I know of.
