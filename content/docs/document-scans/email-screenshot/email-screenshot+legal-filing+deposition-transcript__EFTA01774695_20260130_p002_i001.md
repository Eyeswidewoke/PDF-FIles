Clinton vs. Trump: A sweep by either =arty would likely rattle markets 
Our S&P targets and sector strategy assume a =alanced outcome from the US general election on Nov 8th that maintains 
=he current split in power. However, if Democrats keep the Presidency and take Senate or Republicans take =he 
Presidency and keep Senate, it likely brings policy uncertainty and =arket volatility. Longer-term, it will be the policies 
and =mplementation that will influence markets, which both parties, many individuals and circumstances will craft. This 
note =dentifies sectors, industries and stocks that we think would be price =ensitive to an unbalanced election outcome 
tilted toward one party. 
Dividing issues: Taxes, trade, favored =nfrastructure types and monetary policy 
It's difficult to pin down specific =olicies from either candidate, but on several economic issues their =eneral bias is clear. 
These issues include taxes, trade deals, favored types of infrastructure — such as green vs =onventional energy, 
preference for monetary policy, and also their =xpressed views on industries such as Health Care and Energy. It is the 
=ist of the candidate's preference on these issues that we used to identify sectors and stocks sensitive to a sweep. 
Big banks might outperform small banks =nd oil might go down on Rep sweep 
While many of our conclusions align with =onventional judgment, we think we differ in that we think a Rep sweep =ould: 
1) be good for some domestic oil producers, as it should permit more drilling, but negative to the =ecovery in oil and gas 
prices, as more supply, and thus negative for =he broad Energy sector, 2) bring somewhat faster Fed hikes and a 
=tronger dollar than otherwise, 3) the first two could lead to lower inflation and a flatter yield curve than otherwise 
would =e. One could argue that Trump sized tax cuts and an infrastructure and =efense spending spree would steepen 
the curve, but we think this =nlikely while Republicans control the House. If Fed hikes bring yield curve flattening then 
big banks and capital =arkets likely outperform small banks and insurance companies. Slow =ikes that allow inflation to 
accelerate and steepen the curve might =avor smaller banks and insurance, but this could pressure PEs at non-financials. 
If the Fed falls too far behind the curve, =igher long-term rates could threaten the stock market, real estate and =he 
overall economy. 
Equity strategy election themes: Party =weep better for investor confidence on 
Taxes-R, Trade-D, Infrastructure-RID, Faster Fed =ikes-R, Higher inflation target-D, Steeper curve-D, stronger dollar-R, 
=tock market-R/D, large caps-R, small caps-D, globally exposed S&P stocks-R, domestically exposed =&P-D, higher

Industry pair trades and ETF ideas for =emocratic vs. Republican Sweep 
1) Favor Health Care Services & Facilities =ver Drugs & Medical Devices 
2) Favor Engineering & =onstruction over Defense stocks 
3) Favor Small Banks & =ife Insurance over Big Banks and Capital Mkts 
4) Favor Energy majors over Oil Services and =mailer domestic E&Ps 
5) Favor Clean Energy & =ocial Media over Cheap Energy & Telco/Cable 
6) Favor Metals & Mining over Chemicals =amp; Construction Materials
