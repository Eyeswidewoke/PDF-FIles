candy to minority children. According to the article, Chichikvishvili provided bomb•making and ricin instructions and directed what he thought 
was an accomplice—actually an undercover FBI agent—to carry out bombings and arson, and the FBI foiled the plot before it could be executed. 
The article noted that ChkItikvishvill's "Hater's Handbook" has been tied to violent incidents abroad and in the U.S., and that he now faces up to 40 
years in prison, with prosecutors recommending a sentence of 14 to 17 years ahead of a scheduled March sentencing. 
For Victims of Sexual Assault on Cruise Ships, Justice Can Be Elusive 
The New York Times (11/19, Yeginsu) reported that sexual assaults on cruise ships have risen sharply as cruising reaches record demand, with 
120 alleged assaults reported to the FBI in 2024 and more than 100 already reported in 2025, while victims often struggle to obtain Justice in an 
environment where their rights on land do not fully apply at sea. In describing one case involving a 20•year•old passenger identified as Jane Doe, 
the article detailed how ship security delayed reporting her assault and how the FBI's Involvement was hampered by Jurisdictional challenges, 
slow response times, and limited communication with the victim's family. According to the article, cruise lines are required under the 2010 Cruise 
Vessel Security and Safety Act to report certain crimes to the FBI, but the database only logs incident numbers, not investigative outcomes, and 
numerous lawsuits reveal recurring failures in evidence preservation, victim support, and investigative follow-through. The article further 
described how the FBI's investigative process is often constrained by ships' foreign registration, logistical bafflers to boarding vessels, and 
inconsistent cooperation from onboard security teams, leaving victims in a system where evidence is frequently mishandled or withheld. The 
article noted that despite ongoing efforts to strengthen cruise•ship safety laws and procedures, the lack of independent oversight, heavy industry 
lobbying, and limited transparency continue to impede accountability, leaving many victims to pursue civil sults that are commonly settled under 
nondisclosure agreements.

Times Herald-Record (11/18, Randall) reported that Dominic Mamaat, a 46-year•old New Windsor man, pleaded guilty to flrst•degree rape, a 
felony charge from May 2020. According to the article, Mamaat had fled to the Philippines in October 2020 but was found and returned to Orange 
County in August 2025 with the help of the FBI and other agencies. The article noted that he is expected to be sentenced to 20 years in state 
prison, followed by 20 years of post•release supervision, and will be registered as a sex offender. Additional reporting was provided by Mid 
Hudson News (11/18, Staff Writer). 
Law Enforcement Warns of Scams Targeting Android Users 
WBNG (CBS-12) (11/18, Hemminger) reported that law enforcement officials are warning Android users about a new malware threat called'N-
Gate," which can steal sensitive financial information—including card numbers and PINs—by mimicking fake "tap•to•pay" or "card validation" 
screens. According to the article, scammers use the captured information to immediately withdraw money at ATMs, and the New York State 
Sheriff's Association advised users to install apps only from trusted sources, avoid unsolicited bank calls, ignore suspicious links, and use 
reputable mobile security tools. The article noted that victims should contact their local sheriff's office and file a report with the FBI Internet 
Crime Complaint Center if they believe they've been targeted. 
Continued Reporting: Letitia James and Lisa Cook Lawyer Pushes Back on Mortgage Fraud Allegations 
The Washington Examiner (11/18, Deese) reported that Defense attorney Abbe Lowell is criticizing the DOJ's mortgage fraud investigations into 
New York Attorney General Letitia James and Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. According to the article, Lowell accuses federal officials of 
using thin claims to target the president's perceived enemies, calling it a "shocking course of government conduct". The article noted that Lowell 
has submitted a motion to dismiss the indictment against James and a letter defending Cook, arguing that the charges stem from an attempt to use 
the mortgage oversight agency as a "political weapon".
