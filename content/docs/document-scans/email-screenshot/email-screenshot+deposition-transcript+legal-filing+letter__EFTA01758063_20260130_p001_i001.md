The table cloths were made by a place o= 3rd and 58th..lnteriors by Royale. We just have to pick a fabricpfrom D&am=;D 
Building and they can make whatever we want. I am planning on being in N= next week for a few days. I can look for 
fabric then if you like; just let=me know what kind. If you want Chinese print, maybe the Chinese place in so=o sells 
fabrics. 
I appreciate and am very grateful for all o= your support and generosity in every aspect of my life. It's been a bit of=an 
emotional roller coaster for me the past few months dealing with transit=oning into a new life and everything changing 
for me in my life. It's very e=citing, but extremely stressful and confusing at the same time. Not to ment=on traveling 
every 2-3 days to some remote town around the country trying t= figure how to have my own identity in these new 
surroundings and new life w=th all new people around me. It hasn't been easy and I haven't figured it o=t yet. Yes, the 
wedding planning has taken most of my free time but its tem=orary. It will hopefully be a one time occurrence in my life 
and I want it t= be special. And since I've never planned a real wedding before, it's takin= a bit more time and there's a 
lot more involved than just any old party. l=m OCD..I want it to be perfect. I have done alot of thought about to do nex= 
for myself. I don't know yet. I have to try and figure something out which=l can do on the road. I've discussed more 
projects with Kathryn which would=involve a website which would need to be updated and managed every week, wh=ch 
would be something I can do just with my computer. Even if it doesn't ma=e money, it would be a good skill to have 
practice with. 
My=life is making a 180 degree change. It's going to take time to adapt and fi=ure out the best way to make a transition. 
You are my family and most trust=d friend as well. That hasn't changed. I'm sorry if I've been distant. I'm j=st trying to 
figure it all out.
