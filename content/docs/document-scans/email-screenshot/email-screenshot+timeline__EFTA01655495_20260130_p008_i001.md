WXIA (NBC-11) (11/07, Woods) reported that Jarvis Matthews, a 46-year-old inmate, was convicted of running a 
multi-million dollar drug and money laundering operation from behind bars in Calhoun State Prison. According to 
the article, Matthews used contraband cellphones to direct the distribution of drugs, including methamphetamine, 
heroin, and fentanyl, in and around Atlanta, with the help of his family members. The investigations began in July 
when FBI agents identified a social media account that Matthews used to conduct dozens of drug deals. Agents say 
Matthews used his fiancée, girlfriends, nephew, and two adult sons to distribute drugs and collect and launder 
money. "Jarvis Matthews used the confines of a prison cell to orchestrate a multi-million-dollar drug trafficking and 
money laundering operation, exploiting his family and the prison system to further his criminal enterprise," said 
Paul Brown, Special Agent in Charge of FBI Atlanta. "This case underscores the FBI's commitment to dismantling 
transnational criminal organizations and holding accountable those who think they can operate beyond the reach 
of the law." The article noted that he faces a mandatory minimum of 25 years in federal prison, to be served 
consecutively to his current life without parole sentence, after being found guilty of conspiracy and money 
laundering charges. Additional reporting was provided by WAGA (FOX-5) (11/07, Daniel), WUPA (CBS-69) (11/07, 
Raby), and WSB (ABC-2) (11/07, Staff Writer).

fentanyl trafficking case. According to the article, the operation, which is part of the FBI's Operation Summer Heat, 
aimed to disrupt violent crime and combat the opioid epidemic in the Tahoe bi-state region by targeting cartel-
supplied gang members and drug traffickers. The article noted that around 24 people have been arrested in 
connection with the operation, with one suspect, Cole Williams, still at large, and more arrests expected in the 
future.

corruption probe. According to the article, he pleaded guilty to four felonies, including wire fraud, and his 
cooperation led to the conviction of former Anaheim Mayor Harry Sidhu. The article noted that Ament is now 
seeking to undo his plea deal, claiming he received poor legal advice and that the facts alleged in the plea

Former Diocesan Fundraising Director Indicted on Wire Fraud 
OSV News (11/07, Christian) reported that Jeremy Lillig, former director of stewardship and development for the 
Diocese of Kansas City-St. Joseph, Missouri, has been indicted on one count of wire fraud for allegedly stealing over 
$150,000. The diocese "became aware of Mr. Lillig's potentially criminal financial activity shortly after his 
departure," and had "promptly reported" the matter "to local law enforcement and the FBI," Bishop James V. 
Johnston Jr. said. According to the article, the alleged theft occurred from 2017 to 2021 using a diocesan credit 
card, with Lillig purchasing and activating Visa gift cards for personal benefit. "Importantly, the FBI has assured us 
that their investigation did not find any individual donor funds which were diverted prior to secure deposit into the 
Bright Futures Fund," the bishop stressed. The article noted that if convicted, Lillig faces a maximum sentence of 20 
years' imprisonment, a $250,000 fine, and three years' supervised release, with his trial scheduled for March 16, 
2026. Additional reporting was provided by Christian Post (11/07, Foley). 
Prison for Kansas Credit Union Manager's $700K Embezzlement Scheme 
Hays Post (11/08, Staff Writer) reported that Rita Hartman, a 71-year-old former manager of Muddy River Credit 
Union in Atchison, Kansas, was sentenced to 63 months in prison for embezzling over $750,000. According to the 
article, Hartman pleaded guilty to one count of false entries in federal credit union records and was ordered to pay 
$778,361 in restitution. "The defendant was entrusted with the fiscal responsibility of the credit union's members. 
In using the money for her personal benefit, the defendant's actions were a betrayal of that trust," said Special 
Agent in Charge Stephen A. Cyrus of the FBI Kansas City Field Office. "This sentencing demonstrates the FBI's 
longstanding commitment to working financial fraud investigations and to hold individuals accountable for their 
actions." The article noted that her embezzlement scheme, which occurred between 2007 and 2021, wiped out the 
credit union's capital and forced it to merge with another credit union to continue operations.
