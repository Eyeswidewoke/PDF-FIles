frustration. When the other party seems eager and keeps getting 
ahead of what seems to be the natural rhythm, that may make one feel 
loved or at least desired; a lackluster or overly robotic rhythm may 
make one feel that the other party isn't really into it; etc. The 
arousal of these emotions is more variable among different people, 
whereas the basic logic of arousal via expectation and frustration is 
more generic. A person's specific physiological and emotional 
makeup, layered on top of the basic biology of human physical pleasure 
and the math of expectation fulfillment and frustration, add up to 
form that person's personal sexual pleasure calculus... 
The next ingredient to introduce into the story is PATTERNS. In a 
sexual context, stimulation is not just a matter of delivering 
pleasure to one or another tissue; pleasure may be delivered in 
specific patterns of touch geometry and intensity, and the body comes 
to expect these patterns. A "French corkscrew twist" move=ent of one 
sex organ within or around the other; or a stroke of the hand 
repeatedly up and down the lover's hip; etc. etc. Such a movement 
pattern will typically have a certain timing, and can be accelerated 
or delayed, inducing dynamics of expectation, fulfillment, 
frustration, tension, etc. Furthermore, movement patterns impact 
each other, as they may involve adjacent, overlapping or more subtly 
cross•connected parts of the body ... so that fulfillment of one may 
cause deferral of another, etc. Kissing on the neck faster and faster 
may cause what's happening with the genitals to temporarily get slo=er 
and softer, etc. — pleasure via acceleration in one place correlate= 
with pleasure via temporary frustration and then fulfillment in 
another place. 
And this complexity brings us finally back to music. In music we 
have many complex patterns unfolding through time, each eliciting 
expectations regarding what will come next. The symmetries of musical 
scales and chords are instrumental in forming these expectations. 
When a chord pattern has been repeating, one expects it will continue. 
When a melodic line has been going up a certain scale, one expects it 
will continue. When a melodic line has been going up and down within 
a certain scale, one thinks it will stay within that scale. When two 
melodic patterns have occurred, each immediately followed by their 
inversions ... and then a third one occurs, one expects it will be 
immediately followed by its inversion. And so forth. 
So what we have in music is a collection of interlocking patterns, 
each giving rise to expectations. Each of these expectations may 
happen a little sooner or a little later than expected, thus causing 
extra bursts of pleasure in accordance with the basic logic of 
anticipation, frustration and pleasure. Making one pattern continue 
sooner or more intensely, will generally cause some other pattern to 
continue later or less intensely — thus weaving a complex web of 
fulfillments and frustrations, which reminds us of the complex webs of 
fulfillment and expectation in our inner and outer lives.
