World Outlook 2016: Managing with less liquidity 
Back-end and swap spreads convergence 
The rationale outlined above would be consistent with a possible 
underperformance of the European back-end relative to the US. This macro 
assessment is supported by valuation arguments. Long-term valuation 
arguments which ignore flow effects such as OE suggest a significant richness 
of 5Y5Y rates in Europe relative to the US. Accounting for flows, the relative 
richness is less clear. The corollary however is that any pricing out of flow 
effect should lead to an underpeformance of European fixed income in the 
long end of the curve. At the same time, the structural drivers of the cheapness 
of swap spreads in the US are likely to become more prominent in Europe. This 
should also lead to a relative cheapening of the long end of the German curve 
vs. USTs. 
Figure 12: 5Y5Y adjusted risk premium (which ignores 
flow effects) indicate some scope for underperformance 
of European fixed income

Key risks to the outlook: 
As always, there are important risks to this outlook. These include external 
risks such es China and the dynamics of oil prices, but also domestic risks 
such as a change in the fiscal policy outlook, political risks in Europe or a turn 
in the US credit cycle. We summarise the key risks below. 
Cii;n:i• We argued earlier this year that China rather than Europe was the main 
disinflationary source at the global level. In contrast to Europe, credit growth 
remains relatively high, long-term real rates are above 4%, the GDP deflator is 
in negative territory and the currency has appreciated close to 30% and is now 
overvalued on some metrics. Our economists are positive on the short-term 
outlook for growth and China's ability/desire to maintain a relatively stable 
currency. However, they also recognize the secular decline in growth. Putting 
it all together, China could continue to exert background disinflationary 
pressures, but without creating a significant financial shock. Relative to this 
scenario, the risks would come from a more aggressive adjustment and/or 
policy response. For instance, a more aggressive devaluation would increase 
the disinflationary pressures that would be exported to the rest of the world, 
while enabling a rebuild of FX reserves. Both factors would contribute to a 
flattening of the curve and would likely lead to more dovish ECB and Fed. 
Conversely, a more aggressive domestic easing (fiscal and monetary policy) 
while maintaining the currency stable is likely to reduce disinflationary forces 
while at the same time putting more pressure on FX reserves. Both factors 
would lead to steeper core curves.
