The AP (8/27, Contreras, Bryan) reports on Albuquerque, which is "10th in the nation for 
violent crime, ranks No. 2 for car thefts and has experienced a spike in homicides." President 
Trump "included Albuquerque earlier this summer among the Democrat-led cities where he has 
dispatched more federal law enforcement agents to beef up local policing efforts." Albuquerque 
Mayor Tim Keller "insists the city is making progress" and "Keller and fellow New Mexico 
Democrat politicians bristled at Trump's July move to send agents to Albuquerque," though US 
Attorney John Anderson of New Mexico "defended the deployment." The federal agents "are 
working with local police officers, sheriff's deputies and prosecutors to investigate cases and 
serve search warrants." 
Three Charged After Kansas City Carjacking. 
KCTV-TV Kansas City, MO (8/27, Brown, 133K) reports from Kansas City, Missouri, "Three 
young Kansas City, Missouri, men have been charged in federal court as part of Operation 
LeGend. The charges come after an armed carjacking on Monday night that led to a high-speed 
chase and a crash that killed another driver." KCTV-TV adds, "The three charged are 19-year-old 
Derrell 'Derrelle' M. Wade, 18-year-old Curtis R. Daniels, and 18-year-old Michael A. Brown. 
Each has been charged with participating in the carjacking. Wade is also charged with 
brandishing a firearm during a crime of violence." 
COUNTER-INTELLIGENCE 
Tony Blinken Agrees To Voluntary Deposition In House Ukraine Probe. 
Politico (8/27, Bertrand, 4.29M) reports Tony Blinken, former deputy national security adviser 
and deputy secretary of state and a top foreign policy adviser "to Joe Biden's presidential 
campaign has agreed to a voluntary deposition before a GOP-led Senate committee probing the 
former vice president's relationship with Ukraine, according to a congressional source and two 
other people familiar with the matter." Blinken sent a letter to "Senate Homeland Security and 
Governmental Affairs committee chairman Ron Johnson (R-WI) earlier this week agreeing to the 
interview." The panel also has "secured a voluntary interview with Amos Hochstein, a former 
special envoy for international energy in the Obama administration who also served as a close 
Biden adviser, ending speculation that Johnson would compel his and Blinken's testimony." The 
interviews are expected "to take place in early September." Democratic lawmakers have "raised 
concerns, including in a letter last month to the FBI, that Johnson's probe has become a vehicle 
for 'laundering' a foreign influence campaign to damage Biden." 
Christopher Steele: FBI Did Not Pay For Dossier Research. 
The Washington Times (8/27, Scarborough, 492K) reports Christopher Steele testified at a 
"defamation trial in London that the FBI stiffed him out of payments he was due for travel in his 
anti-Trump investigation." Steele's testimony came as part of a "lawsuit brought by Russian 
entrepreneur Aleksej Gubarev." Mr. Steele's dossier accused Gubarve "of being the culprit who 
hacked into Democratic Party computers in 2016." Following the release of the dossier, the FBI 
concluded the hacking "was done by Russian military intelligence units in Moscow, not Mr. 
Gubarev." According to transcripts "obtained by The Washington Times, Mr. Steele testified that 
he became unhappy with the lack of public disclosure and FBI follow-through on his 
investigation." As result, he conducted a Skype interview with David Corn of "Mother Jones," 
after which Steele says the FBI refused to pay agreed sums and expenses. 
Washington Examiner: Senate Report Raises "Further Questions" About Steele's 
Relationship With Deripaska. The Washington Examiner (8/27, Dunleavy, 448K) reports a 
recently released Senate Intelligence Committee "report detailed the business relationship that 
Christopher Steele" had with Russian businessman Oleg Deripaska, "raising further questions 
about the British ex-spy's discredited dossier." The Examiner says the Senate panel "sought to
