amassed in his campaign war chest," but "now Sittenfeld is the third member of the nine-
person council arrested by the FBI and indicted on bribery, attempted extortion and other 
corruption-related charges this year for allegedly taking bribes for favorable votes on 
development deals." 
WLWT-TV Cincinnati (11/23, 319K) reports, "Word of the 36-year-old Sittenfeld's arrest at 
his East Walnut Hills home Thursday morning sent shockwaves through City Hall, where there 
have been calls for him to step down. The Hamilton County Democratic Party issued a 
statement saying if the allegations are true, Sittenfeld should resign." Cincinnati Mayor John 
Cranley "called it 'a sad day' and, although he said Sittenfeld is entitled to due process, he 
should focus on that and resign from his elected position. According to the six-count indictment, 
two years ago this month at a downtown restaurant, Sittenfeld met with someone he thought 
was an investor and laid out his terms for approving a development project. Those terms, 
federal investigators said, added up to $20,000." 
WXIX-TV Cincinnati (11/23, Schupp, 42K) reports, "Sittenfeld posted a 'message of 
gratitude' after being indicted on federal corruption-related charges." Sittenfeld "was indicted on 
two counts of honest services wire fraud, two counts of bribery, and two counts of attempted 
extortion by a government official. 'I want to say thank you to the people of Cincinnati, my 
family, friends, to folks I've heard from all across the city, our state, the country for your 
incredible outpouring of love and support,' he said in a video statement on Twitter Monday 
morning." 
WLWT-TV Cincinnati (11/23, 319K) reports, "Sittenfeld released a video on Twitter 
Monday, saying he's not giving up and will continue to fight the charges. 'The allegations 
against me are simply not true,' Sittenfeld said. 'I stand strongly on my record of public service, 
including providing help that's in the public interest to anyone whether they've ever made a 
political contribution to me or not." 
Missouri Woman Sentenced In Walmart Fraud Scheme. 
The Wisconsin State Journal (11/23, Richgels, 372K) reports, "A Missouri woman was sentenced 
to 30 months in federal prison in a scheme that defrauded Walmart of more than $860,000, 
according to U.S. Attorney Scott C. Blader." Heather Bishop, 31, of Lee's Summit, Missouri, "was 
sentenced last week by U.S. District Judge William M. Conley for conspiring with Crystal Austin, 
Shelly Scott, Jason Edge, and others to commit wire fraud throughout the country." Austin, of 
Belton, Missouri, "was sentenced in September to 65 months in federal prison. Scott and Edge, 
both of Kansas City, were sentenced by Conley in November 2018 to four years in prison." The 
State Journal adds, "Between November 2016 and February 2018, the group conspired to 
defraud Walmart through use of stolen personal checks, identity fraud, and methods to bypass 
electronic check authorization measures, resulting in Walmart losing more than $860,000, 
Blader's office said." 
Former New York Medical Firm Owner Sentenced For Healthcare Fraud Scheme. 
Newsday (NY) (11/23, Kessler, 932K) reports, "The former owner of a Hicksville medical 
company who had been a federal fugitive for 11 years was sentenced to 36 months in federal 
prison Monday for his role in a multimillion-dollar health care fraud scheme." Etienne Allonce, 
56, "a Haitian citizen who had been on a federal Most Wanted list before he was captured in his 
native Haiti in 2018, also was ordered to make $4.4 million in restitution by U.S. Circuit Court 
Judge Joseph Bianco at a telephonic hearing in federal court in Central Islip. In addition, Bianco 
said Allonce probably would be deported after he serves his sentence, but as long as he 
remains in the United States, he should serve two years' supervised release. Because he has 
been in custody for 26 months, Allonce will have at most 10 months remaining on his 
sentence."
