OTHER WASHINGTON NEWS 
Trump Says "I Concede Nothing," Criticizes Media For Calling 2020 Election For Biden. 
President Trump on Sunday tweeted, "He won because the Election was Rigged. NO VOTE 
WATCHERS OR OBSERVERS allowed, vote tabulated by a Radical Left privately owned company, 
Dominion, with a bad reputation & bum equipment that couldn't even qualify for Texas (which I 
won by a lot!), the Fake & Silent Media, & more!" Trump added, "He only won in the eyes of the 
FAKE NEWS MEDIA. I concede NOTHING! We have a long way to go. This was a RIGGED 
ELECTION!" 
Typical of the tone of the coverage, Kelly O'Donnell reported on NBC Nightly NewsVI 
(11/15, story 4, 2:25, Snow, 3.53M) that "the President's veneer of election denial cracked 
today when these two words jumped out: 'He won.' A concession by tweet, building on this 
Friday verbal slip." Trump: "Whatever happens in the future, who knows which administration it 
will be, I guess time will tell." However, O'Donnell added it "was short lived. Ninety-two minutes 
elapsed and the President blasted out this. 'I concede nothing. We have a long way to go." 
Similarly, the Washington Post (11/15, Sonmez, Hamburger, Firozi, 14.2M) says that the 
President "doubled down on his refusal to concede the election to President-elect Joe Biden, 
even after suffering resounding court defeats over his election challenges and amid a growing 
popular-vote margin for the Democrat." The Post adds that as Trump "continued to falsely 
accuse Democrats of fraud, an influential Michigan Republican said Sunday that the certification 
of the state's election results should not be delayed, in a move likely to further ramp up 
pressure on the president. And Trump's campaign on Sunday scrapped a major part of its 
federal lawsuit challenging the election in Pennsylvania." 
Per the AP (11/15, Freking), "There has been no widespread fraud in the 2020 election. In 
fact, election officials from both political parties have stated publicly that the election went well 
and international observers confirmed there were no serious irregularities." The AP adds that 
Trump's campaign "has tried to mount legal challenges across the country, but many of the 
lawsuits have been thrown out and none has included any evidence that the outcome might be 
reversed." Similarly, the Washington Times (11/15, Howell, 492K) says that while Trump "says 
a mix of software issues and mail-in ballot chicanery cost him the election," his legal battles 
"have largely fallen flat."
