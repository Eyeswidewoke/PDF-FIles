on coronavirus aid." She said, "We're not budging. Understand this. They have to move. ... 
They're just going to have to come up with more money." 
On its website, CNBC (8/27, Pramuk, 3.62M) says the conversation "failed to crack [the] 
stalemate." f_Q Roll Call (8/27, Lerman, 154K) says Pelosi and Meadows "spoke by phone for 25 
minutes," but "there was no indication after the call that either side had given any ground." 
Pelosi said in a statement, "This conversation made clear that the White House continues to 
disregard the needs of the American people as the coronavirus crisis devastates lives and 
livelihoods. ... The Administration's continued failure to acknowledge the funding levels that 
experts, scientists and the American people know is needed leaves our nation at a tragic 
impasse." 
Kudlow Says Another Relief Bill Is Not Necessary. Meanwhile, the Washington 
Examiner (8/27, Krishan, 448K) reports NEC Director Kudlow "said on Thursday that another 
pandemic relief package from Congress is not necessary." Kudlow was asked during a virtual 
event for the Republican National Convention "if the economy is strong enough to go without 
more fiscal stimulus from the federal government." Kudlow said, "I think we are." 
Politico (8/27, Oprysko, 4.29M) reports that Kudlow "said...the Trump administration 
would be willing to compromise with Democrats on a new coronavirus relief package, but 
continued to draw a red line at the multitrillion-dollar price tag House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has 
pushed for." Kudlow told Politico, "There has to be a limit." He "suggested that he thought the 
economy would scrape by without another relief package." 
White House, Treasury Debate Has Delayed Guidance On Payroll Tax Suspension. 
The New York Times (8/27, Rappeport, 18.61M) reports, "A debate between the White House 
and the Treasury Department over President Trump's payroll tax suspension has delayed crucial 
information about how the executive order will be carried out, according to people familiar with 
the matter." The White House "wants the Treasury guidance to ensure that companies, not 
workers, are held liable for paying the employee portion of the tax when the tax holiday ends. 
It is unclear why the Treasury Department has not been willing to issue such guidance, but 
businesses, which have been fielding questions from their employees about when the tax cuts 
will begin, would prefer that Congress legislate any changes to tax policy." The Post adds that it 
is unclear "that the White House would have the legal authority to shift the tax burden in such a 
manner." 
Much Of $4546 Congress Gave To Treasury For Coronavirus Relief Remains Unused. 
The Wall Street Journal (8/27, Kiernan, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) reports that as talks 
continue over the next coronavirus relief bill, more than half of the $454 billion Congress gave 
the Treasury Department in March to support Federal Reserve lending to businesses and state 
and local governments is still unused. According to the Journal, five months after those funds 
were approved, $259 billion remains uncommitted. 
WPost: Unemployed Americans "Furious" Congress Let $600 A Week Benefit Expire. 
The Washington Post (8/27, Al, Rosenberg, Long, 14.2M) reports that Congress "split town in 
August after letting the $600-a-week unemployment bonus that millions of people...have been 
relying on expire," and "millions of desperate Americans, many of whom have never relied on 
emergency government assistance before, are flabbergasted and furious, believing they have 
been cut loose by a Washington political structure that doesn't care about their predicament 
during the pandemic." The Post "spoke to 20 people who have lost their livelihoods in recent 
months, and all said they felt immense pressure to stay afloat without the extra $600." In 
addition, "every person interviewed said they were furious at Washington policymakers for 
letting such a critical benefit lapse amid the nation's worst economic crisis in a century. Often 
the anger was directed at Republicans, who control the White House and the Senate, although a 
few credited President Trump for at least trying to take action on his own."
