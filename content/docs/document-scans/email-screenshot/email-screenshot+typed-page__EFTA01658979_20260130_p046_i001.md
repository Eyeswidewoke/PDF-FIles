Magro is due to a "hateful and slanderous propaganda against France, testifying to a desire to 
stir up hatred against us and our heart," as well as "direct insults against the President of the 
Republic, expressed at the highest level of the Turkish state." The AP (10/25, Ganley) reports, 
"A day after saying that Macron needed his head examined, [Erdo§an] said Sunday that the 
French leader has 'lost his way." Bloomberg (10/25, Ozsoy, Nussbaum, 4.73M) provides similar 
coverage.

The New York Times (10/25, Bonnefoy, 18.61M) reports Chileans voted Sunday to do way with 
its "dictatorship-era" constitution "and write a new one — a process that could transform the 
politics of a country that has long been regarded as one of the most stable and prosperous in 
Latin America." The referendum appeared "headed for a landslide victory; with 62 percent of 
the votes counted, 78 percent were cast in favor of a new Constitution, and it was leading in 
almost every part of the country." 
Bloomberg (10/25, Malinowski, Thomson, 4.73M) reports, "The referendum was one of 
several concessions that the government and lawmakers agreed to in order to quell riots that 
started last October." the protests, which began over "a metro fare increase...quickly spiraled 
into a broader social movement with grievances ranging from pensions to education."

Fiftieth Country Ratifies Treaty On The Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. 
The New York Times (10/25, Gladstone, 18.61M) reports Honduras has become the 50th 
country to ratify the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, which is "aimed at 
destroying all nuclear weapons and forever prohibiting their." Fifty countries ratifying the accord 
is "an important benchmark" because it is "the minimum needed for it to enter into force as 
international law." The Times adds that the treaty "is not binding on those nations that refuse to 
sign on to it. The United States and the world's eight other nuclear-armed countries — Russia, 
China, Britain, France, India, Pakistan, North Korea and Israel - boycotted the negotiations that 
created the treaty and have shown no inclination to accept it." 
WPost Urges Openness About Invisible Attacks On US Diplomats, Intel Officers. 
A Washington Post (10/25, 14.2M) editorial calls for "more openness from the U.S. 
government" about the "invisible attacks on American diplomats and intelligence officers 
abroad." The attacks, which "began in Cuba and China," left "U.S. officials with headaches, 
dizziness, blurred vision and memory loss after hearing strange noises and feeling odd 
sensations." The Post says Congress should have "a report commissioned by the State 
Department and completed some months ago into the attacks" and make it public. The Post 
argues, "That is the first of many steps still needed to identify the perpetrators, protect 
Americans abroad and respond properly."
