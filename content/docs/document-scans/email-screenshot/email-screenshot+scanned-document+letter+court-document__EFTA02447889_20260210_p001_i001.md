june ) is really ,no further ahead, consultants up the kazoo but nothing at all done.( the office was told that i cannot 
even see the proposals=20 received without brads specific authorization ) - brad has no idea ev=n as to what questions 
to ask. he knows little of finance, is run roughshod over by almost everyone in the office. he is a little man ,=20 using 
your power, to appear larger . Eileen was self aware enough to know she was over her head , that is a huge difference. 
bad inf= is rampant ie 3 million in deductions Im told are taken for art space but on closer examination i= turns out 
they cannot be used at all. ( ZERO benefit ► though you will be told=20 yes they were deducted on the return they said 
that is the question=20 they get asked ! " were they deducted " not -" i= there a benefit " !!

49percent of <=pan>phaid=n merged into artspance and have Richard buy artspace. re-do bank loans. no need to pay 
interest at higher rates on b=at or plane. . as Richard is now no longer trustee. re- do will, =AO make suydam executor , 
with Barry, =nd john as back up. pay 1 million a year for executor role. =AO get rid of Judy Black trust, deal with gifts 
and their=tax returns, . review amounts to kids at fixed ages. put more protec=ions in for Alex and Victoria. , distribute 
some money to kids let them make decisions. =, decide art division with children in attendance . have fire drill 
done=on estate. fill out estate returns as if you and Debra died today, choos= advisers=/span> - rick bronstein said the 
only 1040 he ever=filled out was his own. ( this is brads chosen advisor??!) Halperin has a conflict that should be 
addressed., Debra should enter a tenants in common agreement with kids. you have airplane consultants tax 
consultants it consultants. plan= operation consultant. . boat consultants. architects, lighting , art, =AO legal, .
