"Hillary Clinton never accepted them. She still doesn't accept them, and she got beaten very 
easily." Trump added, "So we have a new phenomenon. It's called mail-in voting. ... You look at 
some of the corruption having to do with universal mail-in voting. Absentee voting is okay. You 
have to apply. You have to go through a process. Absentee voting is good. ... There is no way 
you can go through a mail-in vote without massive cheating." 
Vice President Pence said on Fox News' Ingraham Angle (8/3), "The President made it 
very clear, whether it's the power grab in Nevada, that the governor of Nevada was signing that 
allowed not only for universal mail-in ballots but also vote harvesting, as it's called, we are 
headed to the courts. The right to vote, the one person, one vote right is at the very center of 
our democracy and the President has made it very clear that we are not going to stand idly by 
while you see Democrat states and Democrat governors use the backdrop of the coronavirus to 
send millions of ballots all across their states and all across this country. Let's be clear though. 
Absentee balloting is perfectly acceptable. ... But this universal mail-in loaded voting where 
you're going to see literally ballots showered all across the state is ripe for fraud and we are 
headed straight to the courts to put a stop to it." 
The Washington Post (8/3, Gardner, Dawsey, 14.2M) says the President's "unfounded 
attacks on mail balloting are discouraging his own supporters from embracing the practice, 
according to polls and Republican leaders across the country, prompting growing alarm that one 
of the central strategies of his campaign is threatening GOP prospects in November." The Post 
adds, "As a result, state and local Republicans across the country fear they are falling 
dramatically behind in a practice that is expected to be key to voter turnout this year. Through 
mailers and Facebook ads, they are racing to promote absentee balloting among their own." 
According to Reuters (8/3, Ax), "Election experts say voter fraud of any kind, including 
incidents related to mail-in ballots, is vanishingly rare." The Hill (8/3, Chalfant, 2.98M), the Fox 
News (8/3, Olson, 27.59M) website, and the New York Post (8/3, Nelson, 4.57M), among other 
news outlets, also cover the story. 
Deputy White House Communications Director Brian Morgenstern said on the John 
Fredericks ShowVi (8/3), "What you're seeing in the media and from many on the left are 
trying to conflate mail-in balloting and absentee balloting and saying they are the same thing. 
They are not. Absentee ballot is where somebody proactively contacts the board of elections, 
they certify that they actually where they say they live, that they will receive it and they will 
return it. Universal mail-in balloting is they just spray ballots to anybody who might be on the 
voter rolls. We know that voter rolls can be outdated. People move around. People 
unfortunately pass away. ... There is a tremendous opportunity for mistakes or fraud with a 
universal mail-in balloting program as opposed to an absentee program."

targeting the farmers. I was targeting china. We were doing good. Then all of a sudden, the
