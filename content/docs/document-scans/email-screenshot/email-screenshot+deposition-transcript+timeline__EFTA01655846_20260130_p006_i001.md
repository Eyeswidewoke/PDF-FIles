COUNTERINTELLIGENCE 
Satellite Images Show Expansion of Suspected Chinese Spy Bases in Cuba 
The Wall Street Journal (07/02, Strobel) reported that satellite images have revealed the expansion of electronic 
eavesdropping stations in Cuba, suspected to be linked to China, including a new site near the U.S. Naval Base at 
Guantanamo Bay. This expansion was detailed in a report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, 
which identified four significant sites, suggesting that China may be using these facilities to intercept sensitive 
communications from the southeastern U.S., including military and commercial signals. According to the article, the 
most recent site, still under construction near Santiago de Cuba, could potentially monitor communications from 
Guantanamo. In its annual threat assessment released in February, the U.S. intelligence community said publicly for 
the first time that China is pursuing military facilities in Cuba, without providing details. The article added 
that Chinese officials stress that the U.S. has a vast global network of military bases and listening posts. "The U.S. is 
no doubt the leading power in terms of eavesdropping and does not even spare its Allies," Liu Pengyu, a spokesman 
for China's embassy in Washington, wrote in a statement. "The U.S. side has repeatedly hyped up China's 
establishment of spy bases or conducting surveillance activities in Cuba." The article explained that the concern 
about the stations, former officials and analysts say, is that China is using Cuba's geographical proximity to the 
southeastern U.S. to scoop up sensitive electronic communications from American military bases, space-launch 
facilities, and military and commercial shipping. Chinese facilities on the island "could also bolster China's use of 
telecommunications networks to spy on U.S. citizens," said Leland Lazarus, an expert on China-Latin America 
relations at Florida International University. The article does not contain a direct FBI mention. 
Former U.S. Air Force Member Faces Charges for Leaking Classified Defense Secrets 
Clearance Jobs (07/01, Suciu) reported that Paul Freeman, a former U.S. Air Force member from Niceville, FL, has 
been charged with leaking classified national defense information about U.S. Air Force aircraft and weapons 
systems between November 2020 and March 2021. According to the article, the FBI, along with the United States 
Air Force Office of Special Investigations, is handling the investigation, although details of the recipients of the 
leaked information or their potential connections to foreign governments have not been disclosed. In addition to 
Freeman's case, the article mentioned several other recent espionage-related incidents within the U.S. military. 
Chief Petty Officer Bryce Pedicini was convicted of attempted espionage for providing classified documents to a 
foreign government employee. This took place between November 2022 and May 2023, and he faced multiple 
charges, resulting in a conviction that included failure to obey a lawful order and violation of a lawful general order. 
Furthermore, two U.S. Navy sailors, Petty Officer Wenheng Zhao (also known as Thomas Zhao) and Jinchao Wei, 
were arrested in separate cases for their attempts to pass military secrets to Chinese intelligence. Zhao was 
sentenced to over two years in federal prison after accepting nearly $15,000 in bribes in exchange for sensitive 
information, including video recordings and documents related to U.S. radar and military exercises in the Indo-
Pacific Region. Wei, on the other hand, is facing life in prison after allegedly revealing sensitive information about 
U.S. Navy ships and has pleaded not guilty.

CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS 
House Republicans Sue Attorney General Garland Over Access to Biden Special Counsel Interview Audio 
The Associated Press (07/01, Amiri) reported that House Republicans on Monday filed a lawsuit against Attorney 
General Merrick Garland for the audio recording of President Joe Biden's interview with a special counsel in his 
classified documents case, asking the courts to enforce their subpoena and reject the White House's effort to 
withhold the materials from Congress. The article added that the lawsuit filed by the House Judiciary Committee 
marks Republicans' latest broadside against the Justice Department as partisan conflict over the rule of law 
animates the 2024 presidential campaign. The legal action comes weeks after the White House blocked Garland 
from releasing the audio recording to Congress by asserting executive privilege. The article stated that Republicans 
in the House responded by voting to make Garland the third attorney general in U.S. history to be held in contempt 
of Congress. But the Justice Department refused to take up the contempt referral, citing the agency's "longstanding 
position and uniform practice" to not prosecute officials who don't comply with subpoenas because of a
