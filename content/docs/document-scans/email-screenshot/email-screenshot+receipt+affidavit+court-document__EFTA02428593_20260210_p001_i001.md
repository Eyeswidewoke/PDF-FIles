CAMBRIDGE, MA -- The John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University announced today a $5 
million gift from Glenn Dubin, co-founder and CEO of Highbridge Capital Management. This gift will be used to 
launch a graduate fellowship fund to support and develop new programs for emerging leaders from the United 
States and around the world. 
The Dubin Graduate Fellowships for Emerging Leaders will be based at Harvard Kennedy School's Center for 
Public Leadership (CPL). Dubin Fellowships wil be awarded on a competitive basis and will provide full tuition 
for up to ten students each year, beginning in the 2010-11 academic year. Fellowship applicants will be judged 
on demonstrated academic excellence, leadership potential, and depth of commitment to making a 
transformative impact on the communities they intend to serve. 
Dubin Fellows will enjoy a distinctive and close-knit experience both during and after their time at the Kennedy 
School. As the program grows, so will the value of the network of alumnilae that remains committed to 
transforming communities around the world. In addition to their formal coursework, Dubin Fellows will have the 
opportunity to participate in a broad set of supporting activities, including leadership workshops, an 
interdisciplinary discussion series with eminent practitioners and thought leaders, field experience in a range of 
settings and mentorship with Kennedy School graduates. 
Harvard Kennedy School Dean David T. Ellwood, who has set increasing student financial aid as one of his top 
priorities, remarked that the Dubin Fellowships will serve as 'strategic investments in outstanding individuals with 
demonstrated promise." 
'The Dubin Fellowships will transform the lives of their recipients—and perhaps the world they will go on to lead 
and to serve," said Ellwood. "We are deeply grateful to the Dubin family and delighted to honor Glenn's example 
of distinguished leadership.' 
'Glenn Dubin is a rare individual," said David R. Gergen, director of CPL and public service professor of public 
leadership at Harvard Kennedy School. "He brings to his very active philanthropic life the same creativity, 
strategic insight, and passion that have taken him to the pinnacle of his profession. Coming on the heels of a 
2009 donation to support CPL's teaching and research, this new gift enables us to extend our time-tested model 
of graduate fellowships supported by robust cocurricular programming. Just as important, Glenn's engagement 
with us as a 'thinking partner' is leading our Center to new heights of strategic innovation and operational 
excellence.' 
Glenn Dubin is the Chief Executive Officer and co-founder of Highbridge Capital Management, LLC, an 
alternative asset management firm launched in 1992. Highbridge's diversified investment platform includes 
hedge funds, traditional investment management products, and debt and private equity investments with longer-
term holding periods. Dubin is a founding member of the Board of Directors and former Board chair of the Robin 
Hood Foundation, and a Trustee of Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York. He is an alumnus of the State 
University of New York at Stony Brook. 
'The ideas behind this new fellowship are some of those which have guided my professional and philanthropic 
life," said Dubin. "My hope for this program is to identify extraordinarily talented and passionate individuals who 
have been able to overcome challenges in life, and provide them with a unique experience that will ultimately 
allow them to make a lasting impact on communities around the world. I am delighted to be partnering with the 
Harvard Kennedy School and its Center for Public Leadership in this program." 
Established in 2000 through a generous grant from the Wexner Foundation, the Center for Public Leadership is 
celebrating its tenth anniversary of advancing the frontiers of knowledge about leadership and deepening the 
pool of leaders for the common good.
