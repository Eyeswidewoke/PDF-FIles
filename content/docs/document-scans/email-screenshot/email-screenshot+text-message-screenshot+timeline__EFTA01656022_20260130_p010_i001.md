which exploits internet-connected devices in homes, including smart TVs and loT devices. According to the article, 
the botnet compromises devices, often manufactured in China, by pre-loading them with malicious software or 
infecting them through apps with hidden backdoors, and uses them for illegal online activities. The article noted

software updated, and monitor network activity to prevent exploitation by the BADBOX 2.0 botnet. Bleeping
