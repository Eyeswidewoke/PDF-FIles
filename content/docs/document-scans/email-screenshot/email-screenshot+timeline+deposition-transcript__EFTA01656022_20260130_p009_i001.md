GirlsDoPorn Owner Pleads Guilty to Sex Trafficking, Conspiracy Charges in San Diego Court 
KFMB (CBS-8) (06/05, Hargrove) reported that the ringleader of a San Diego-based adult website accused of 
coercing young women to appear in adult videos pleaded guilty in federal court to sex trafficking and conspiracy to 
commit sex trafficking. Michael Pratt, who founded Girls Do Porn and ran the website from his downtown San 
Diego penthouse, is now asking a federal judge to sentence him to less than 22 years for the long-running scheme 
that involved dozens of young women. From 2012 through 2019, Pratt set up an elaborate plan to lure and entice 
young women to travel to San Diego and appear in the illicit videos. Pratt set up a fake modeling agency and posted 
ads on Craigslist and other sites seeking models aged 23 and younger. When women responded to ads, Pratt and 
his cohorts would tell the women that the modeling jobs included having sex on video. The article noted that Pratt 
was added to the FBI's Top Ten Most Wanted list and remained a fugitive for three years until he was arrested in 
Spain in December 2022 and extradited to San Diego in March 2024.
