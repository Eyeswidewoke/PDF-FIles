oversaw consolidation in the wireless market through approval of the T-Mobile-Sprint merger, 
but blocked conservative Sinclair Broadcast Group from buying Tribune media." 
The Washington Post (11/30, Romm, 14.2M) says, "[Pars] departure...is set to unleash a 
wave of uncertainty at the FCC." The Post says Joe Biden "can tap an acting chairperson from 
the agency's two Democratic members once he takes the White House as he decides on a more 
permanent leader, which may require Senate confirmation. But it seems increasingly likely that 
the FCC will be deadlocked at two Democrats and two Republicans entering 2021." The Wall 
Street Journal (11/30, Tracy, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) reports Democratic 
Commissioners Jessica Rosenworcel and Geoffrey Starks are both contenders to succeed Pai, as 
is former Commissioner Mignon Clyburn. 
NYTimes Analysis: Barrett Could Be Deciding SCOTUS Vote On Gun Rights. 
Adam Liptak of the New York Times (11/30, 18.61M) writes that Justice Amy Coney Barrett 
"seems poised to supply the fifth vote" on the Supreme Court needed "to expand Second 
Amendment rights." A Second Amendment case "decided last week by the federal appeals court 
in Philadelphia is a promising candidate for Supreme Court review, not least because it presents 
an issue on which Justice Barrett has already taken a stand." Though the appeals court rejected 
a felon's assertion that she should have the right to buy a gun, a dissenting judge who argued 
in favor of the woman's right to bear arms "wrote that his analysis had drawn heavily from a 
dissent last year," written by Barrett, "in a similar case concerning a man convicted of mail 
fraud."

Leaked Documents Show Failings Of Chinese Institutions In Combatting Virus. 
A 4,800-word CNN (11/30, Paton Walsh, 83.16M) article says that on the same day that 
Chinese authorities "reported 2,478 new confirmed cases - raising the total global number to 
more than 40,000, with fewer than 400 cases occurring outside of mainland China," 117 pages 
of leaked internal documents from the Hubei Provincial Center for Disease Control and 
Prevention between October 2019 to April 2020 "provide the first clear window into what local 
authorities knew internally and when." CNN says the documents "reveal what appears to be an 
inflexible health care system constrained by top-down bureaucracy and rigid procedures that 
were ill-equipped to deal with the emerging crisis. At several critical moments in the early 
phase of the pandemic, the documents show evidence of clear missteps and point to a pattern 
of institutional failings."

European countries "announce nationwide strategies to vaccinate their citizens, the UK's plan 
begins with immediate vaccinations in care homes for elderly residents and those who work in 
them. Next up, people 80 years and older along with all healthcare workers, they're followed by 
people in the 70s and late 60s. After them, adults with underlying medical conditions. Mass 
distribution later in 2021. Volunteers are already being trained."

coronavirus tests in France are coming back positive, "students have kept going to school, while 
New York City shut its public schools on Nov. 19, after the positive test rate reached 3 percent."

transmitters of the virus, and at least some American officials are reconsidering their approach:
