Immigration Services website." On its website, CBS News (9/22, Montoya-Galvez, 3.68M) says 
the "move likely [is] to alarm advocates, who have warned about the policy's impact on 
immigrant communities ravaged by the coronavirus." 
The Hill (9/22, Weixel, 2.98M) reports that "under the rule, any immigrant who receives at 
least one designated public benefit - including Medicaid, food stamps, welfare or public housing 
vouchers - for more than 12 months within any three-year period will be considered a 'public 
charge' and will be more likely to be denied a green card." 
House Approves Stopgap Spending Bill Including Farm Aid Sought By GOP. 
Politico (9/22, Ferris, Emma, Caygle, 4.29M) reports "the House on Tuesday overwhelmingly 
voted to extend federal funding through Dec. 11, while punting the threat of a government 
shutdown until after the presidential election." Last night's "bipartisan vote comes hours after" 
House Speaker Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin "clinched a last-minute deal to include 
billions in nutrition assistance and trade relief payments for farmers, capping weeks of 
contentious negotiations." Reuters (9/22, Cornwell) recalls that "the measure, which now heads 
to the Senate, appeared in danger on Monday when Democrats left out key farm aid that 
President Donald Trump had promised last week during a political rally in Wisconsin, a key 
battleground state in his bid for re-election." 
The New York Times (9/22, Cochrane, 18.61M) reports "House Democratic leaders had 
initially sought to advance the bill without the" farm aid, but "moderate Democrats who count 
farmers and agriculture businesses as significant constituencies within their districts lobbied Ms. 
Pelosi to reconsider." Axios (9/22, Treene, 521K) reports Pelosi "said Tuesday that...Mnuchin 
had agreed to 'increase accountability' in the farmer bailout fund in order to prevent it from 
being 'misused for a Big Oil bailout" and that "Republicans had agreed to add nearly $8 billion 
in 'desperately needed nutrition assistance for hungry schoolchildren and families." 
The Washington Times (9/22, Murioz, 492K) indicates the tally in the House was 359-57.
The Senate, says the Washington Post (9/22, Werner, 14.2M), "could take" the measure "up 
later this week and send it to...Trump. White House officials say they don't want a shutdown, 
and Trump is expected to sign the bill, though he's wavered at the last minute in such scenarios 
in the past." 
Meadows Memo: Administration To Replace White House Liaisons At Many Agencies. 
Axios (9/22, Swan, 521K) reports Chief of Staff Meadows "told administration officials Monday 
to expect senior aides to be replaced at many government agencies, according to an internal 
email obtained by Axios." Meadows asked Director of the White House Presidential Personnel 
Office John McEntee "to look at replacing the White House Liaisons (WHLs) at many of your 
agencies," according to the email. Meadows wrote, "Please welcome incoming liaisons as they 
begin their new roles. I ask that you encourage your teams to equip the WHLs with everything 
they need to support your agency and the President's agenda. It is important that WHLs have 
direct access to principals and senior staff regarding all political hiring decisions." 
DeVos Reportedly Under Investigation For Possibly Violating Hatch Act. 
The Daily Caller (9/22, Corkery, 716K) reports Education Secretary DeVos is "reportedly under 
investigation for possibly violating the Hatch Act during an interview with Fox News, Politico 
reported Monday." The Office of Special Counsel "reportedly started the investigation after 
DeVos criticized former Vice President Joe Biden during the interview, according to Politico." Her 
criticism "came in response to a question about his commitment to undo her school choice 
policies." DeVos said during the interview, "Today he's turned his back on the kids that we're 
talking about and he's turned his face in favor of the teachers union and what they have to say 
and what they have to demand and it's really shameful."
