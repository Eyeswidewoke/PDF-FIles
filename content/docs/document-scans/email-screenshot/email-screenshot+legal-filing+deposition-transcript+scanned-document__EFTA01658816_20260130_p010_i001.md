The Detroit Free Press (11/19, Guillen, Moran, 1.52M) reports, "A Wisconsin man accused 
of helping with the alleged surveillance of Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's vacation home was denied 
bail on Thursday while his lawyer prepares to fight his extradition to Michigan." Brian Higgins, 
52, "will remain in custody in Columbia County, Wisc., until an extradition hearing scheduled for 
Dec. 15. The hearing will focus on extradition paperwork Whitmer signed. Higgins' lawyer, 
Christopher Van Wagner, said Wednesday that Whitmer should not have signed the document 
because she has a conflict of interest as the potential victim in the alleged kidnap plot." The 
Free Press adds, "A Columbia County prosecutor argued Thursday that Higgins should not be 
released before the extradition hearing because Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers — after receiving 
Whitmer's paperwork - has now signed a warrant for his delivery to Michigan, changing his 
status in the eyes of the law." 
The Portage (WI) Daily Register (11/19, 28K) reports, "Judge Todd Hepler ultimately 
decided that Higgins will be held without bail until further proceedings. Van Wagner has 
indicated that he will pursue habeas corpus proceedings, or a request that the court determine 
whether someone's detention is unlawful. Van Wagner has until Dec. 2 to file motions and 
documents. The state has until Dec. 11 to respond. Van Wagner has until Dec. 14 to respond to 
the state. A motion hearing is then scheduled for Dec. 15." Also reporting on their websites are

Louisville, Kentucky Sergeants Testify Explorer Records Could Have Been Accessed By 
Newspaper. 
The Louisville (KY) Courier-Journal (11/19, Wolfson, 368K) reports, "A retired Louisville Metro 
Police sergeant and another still on the force testified Thursday the investigative file on the 
scandal-plagued Explorer Scout program was available when The Courier Journal requested it 
last year - despite LMPD and the Jefferson County attorney's office saying it had been moved to 
the FBI. 'It was all there,' Sgt. Kristen Downs of the Public Integrity Unit testified in a 
deposition." Downs "swore under oath she delivered copies of the file in 2017 to then-Chief 
Steve Conrad and to the office of County Attorney Mike O'Connell. She and retired Sgt. Robert 
Banta testified as well they believe the records still exist on the city's back-up computer server." 
US Charges 14 In Bust Of Wisconsin Drug Trafficking Ring. 
The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel (11/19, Hughes, 632K) reports, "Federal prosecutors Thursday 
14 people in connection with a Racine drug trafficking organization that distributed heroin, 
fentanyl and crack cocaine." According to the Journal Sentinel, "Ten of the 14 individuals were 
arrested by law enforcement Wednesday and face between five and 40 years in prison if 
convicted, according to a statement released Thursday from the U.S. Attorney's Office in the 
Eastern District of Wisconsin. Officers seized seven guns, 200 grams of heroin, 100 grams of 
crack cocaine, more than 50 grams of fentanyl and various quantities of suboxone strips, 
oxycodone pills and PCP, and $8,000 in cash in the Wednesday operation, the statement said. 
The organization also had Chicago connections." 
The Racine (WI) Journal Times (11/19, 114K) reports, "FBI Special Agent in Charge 
Robert Hughes said, 'Shared resources and intelligence among law enforcement partners led to 
the successful takedown of an organized drug trafficking operation, and the arrests of multiple 
subjects. The FBI's Southeastern Wisconsin Regional Gang Task Force in Racine will continue to 
work with our partners to keep our communities free of drugs and violence." 
WITI-TV Milwaukee (11/19, Jewell, 159K) reports, "Officials noted just two milligrams of 
fentanyl is a lethal dose - and used a picture of a penny to illustrate just how little two 
milligrams is. 'Such small amounts of fentanyl can be mixed with substances and then sold on 
the street as heroin. But it's incredibly lethal,' said Matt Krueger, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern 
District of Wisconsin. 'Users don't know what's in a mix and it's taking lives." WISN-TV 
Milwaukee (11/19, 265K) also reports.
