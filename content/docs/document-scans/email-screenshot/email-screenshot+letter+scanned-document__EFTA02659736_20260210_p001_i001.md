=C2 LAST YEAR 
transaction complete.!! 
in June and then again Sept, =e both agreed to a 50% of phaidon payout., then only after weeks, when you delayed 
any detailed=20 discussion of money wanting to give the issue a thoughtful resp=nse ( which I fully understand ► . you 
unilaterally changed changed our agreement.. 5m would be reserved for the future ? . and out of=the remaining 15m 
,? i would receive only a third. ( note : I'm=confident that both the debt , and the artspace investment will also lead to 
a write off of another 30 m. plus=C2 ) In my dining room ,you were surprised when I said that i require most=20 
people to pay their advisory fee up front so that I am assured =hat I will be properly compensated for my work when 
strategies are implemented . you may recall that you appeared offended a=d said " are you suggesting that i would 
go back on my word " I said no = of course not ! you are my closest of friends ,but my experience is that=C2 when 
amounts get large, people tend to get unhappy when it actually comes time for them to pay 
I included in this letter the email i sent to you on April 15, t=e day i was examining your returns It laid out my 
understanding of the compensation for a=20 transaction of the magnitude to the penny of the one just completed. =20

From day zero I proposed to di=count to 50 - 60 million the fair price of the transacti=n just completed . including 
Phaidon. . though this amount was already substantially les= than our agreed and negotiated formula. - 
I was never 
told that this =AO was out of range. in fact, alternative methods of payment . plane, =r an -in-kind payment were 
discussed ( ie including keeping the 30m portion of fee outstanding till Marc= ) ,I provided as you specifically 
requested a detailed step b= step execution plan and reviewed all documents that i was given access to.=( Phaidon 
was not forthcoming ) in ord=r to make my many corrections . I was then told th=t Alans involvement warranted a 
discount . Even in the best of l=ght , though it is beyond question that not one time in the three ye=rs of his retainer 
has he ever proposed a unique idea. (includin= any wayt to deal with the use issue on debras death ,or even the most 
basic review of your l=rgest asset by far , the BRH agreement. ) O.K. - lets say he made a contribution to the pla= and 
stretch reality beyond the pale and say it was 50 %. though no =ne could posit such a large amount unless they were 
wearing a brightly=20 colored clown suit. , the payment associated with the deal was =nown . It had both sent in
