the encrypted messaging app TeleGuard, which led to Google revealing email addresses associated with the token. 
This method traced back to Michael Aspinwall in Toledo, who was charged and arrested for sexual exploitation of 
minors and distributing child pornography. According to the article, the technique has sparked privacy concerns, 
especially with potential applications extending to surveilling individuals for activities like violating state abortion 
bans. Privacy advocates and the Electronic Frontier Foundation have expressed worry that such surveillance 
methods, initially intended for extreme cases, could broaden to less universally accepted applications, including 
political surveillance. 
Biden Administration Moves to Renew FBI Spy Tool While Bill Is Stalled in Congress 
Washington Examiner (02/29, Oliver) reported that the Biden administration announced plans to renew Section 
702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), a surveillance program allowing warrantless surveillance of 
foreigners for national security purposes, despite concerns over FBI misuse and calls for reform from Congress. 
According to the article, the FBI had been criticized for inappropriately querying this database for information on 
U.S. citizens, including campaign donors and individuals involved in protests. The article noted that despite internal 
reforms initiated by Director Wray that led to a significant reduction in noncompliance, the renewal process, set to 
begin in March, proceeds amid congressional deadlock over statutory reforms. The article also noted that critics, 
including senior policy analysts and congressional members, expressed concerns that the DOJ's move to secure a 
year-long renewal could bypass necessary congressional oversight and reforms. 
Inside the White House Program to Share America's Secrets 
Time (02/29, Calabresi) reported that the Biden Administration has developed a program to strategically declassify 
intelligence, a move that started with the U.S. response to Russia's preparations to invade Ukraine in the fall of 
2021. This effort, led by National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines, and 
CIA Director William Burns, aims to counter misinformation and support strategic goals, such as deterring Serbian 
aggression against Kosovo by revealing troop buildups. According to the article, the program has been used to 
expose Russian, Chinese, and Iranian activities, and to counter false narratives, demonstrating a shift in how the 
U.S. leverages classified information for national security and diplomatic purposes. The article explained that 
Congress has faced challenges in renewing Section 702 of the mass-surveillance program, crucial for national 
security but controversial due to past FBI abuses, including misleading surveillance applications related to Carter 
Page and the Trump campaign. Additionally, the FBI's discovery of classified documents at Mar-a-Lago, leading to 
charges against former President Trump for obstructing the retrieval of these documents, underscored ongoing 
security and privacy concerns. The article explained that the Justice Department Inspector General's report in 
2019, revealing the FBI's warrant application abuses, and the FBI's extensive warrantless searches on Americans, 
have contributed to a crisis of public trust in the intelligence community. The article assessed that this environment 
has fueled conspiracy theories and skepticism towards the intelligence apparatus, highlighting the complexities of 
balancing transparency, national security, and civil liberties. 
White House: Chinese Cars On U.S. Roads Could 'Undermine Our National Security' 
Reuters (02/29, Staff Writer) reported that Maxim Marchenko, a 51-year-old Russian based in Hong Kong, pled 
guilty to charges of smuggling American-made, military-grade microelectronics to Russia and money laundering, as 
announced by top U.S. justice officials. According to the article, he was accused alongside two unnamed co-
conspirators of using shell companies to fraudulently procure OLED micro-displays, which have both civilian and 
military uses, including in advanced weaponry systems like rifle scopes and night-vision goggles. Assistant Attorney 
General Matthew Olsen emphasized the Justice Department's commitment to holding those accountable who 
support the Kremlin's actions against Ukraine. The press release noted the FBI's involvement. 
Opinion: Obama's CIA Asked Foreign Intel Agencies to Spy on Trump Campaign 
An opinion piece by The Epoch Times (02/29, Chernin) discussed how the U.S. intelligence community, during the 
Obama administration, reportedly sought help from the "Five Eyes" intelligence alliance to spy on Donald Trump's 
campaign before the 2016 presidential election. According to the article, this operation, which allegedly involved 
foreign intelligence services like British intelligence targeting Trump's associates, predates the FBI's Crossfire 
Hurricane investigation and suggests political weaponization of intelligence. The article raised concerns about the 
integrity of democratic processes and the potential collusion between U.S. intelligence agencies and their foreign 
counterparts to influence the election outcome.
