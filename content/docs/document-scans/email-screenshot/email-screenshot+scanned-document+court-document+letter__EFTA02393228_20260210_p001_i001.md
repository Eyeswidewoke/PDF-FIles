UK Bell 430 update 
Jeffrey, 
The visit to Farnborogh England was well warranted I think. PremiAir=20 Aviation is the broker listing the Bell 430 For 
Sale,. Brokers name is Crai= Lamiman,. 
Static inspection of the engine compartment and cockpit panel wa= in great condition, no visible leaks and cockpit 
indicated the 1660 total time=is within reason, as you can see in the photos below. 
The only area that indicates non-operation or age, are the=20 Wheels and brakes. 
Here is the information on the owner of this Bell 430,.and its current=20 statue: 
Owners name is Mick Bailey, a Real Estate developer in Ireland,. =e ran low on money and parked the Helicopter at 
PremiAir Aviation in BlackBus=e airport in England in 2009, to be stored in hanger and engines where t= be run every 
month. Mick Bailey has accumulated an outstanding invoice fo= maintenance of 65,000 lbs sterling, and 15,000 lbs 
sterling for h=nger to date owed to PremiAir Aviation and is unable to settle his invoice until=the helicopter sells. For this 
reason, Mr Bailey wants to sell the helicopter, =As is, Where is" basis, since he can't afford to chance not closing. Cra=g 
told me Mr. Bailey owns the Helicopter free and clear. 
Just a note, PremiAir houses and manages the Queens=20 Helicopter, an Agusta 109, They supposedly got rid of their 
Sikorsky S=6C++ according to Craig Lamiman the Broker at PremiAir,. I included a photo of t=e maintenance shop at 
PremiAir which was most impressive, PremiAir is a =ell 430 authorized repair facility. I spoke in great lengths with Ray, 
PremiAir=s Bell 430 expert, who was very knowledgeable and has taken care of this helicopter since 2009,.he personally 
runs and logs the engines runs every m=nth. 
The Queens Helicopter is also based at PremiAir Aviation, just to show you the caliber of operation PremiAir 
Avaiation=20 is,. 
PremiAir wants this helicopter sold, and they are going to push Mr Bai=ey to pay his invoice or put a lien on the 
helicopter, so Craig the Broker is = little on our side. PremiAir is in contact with a vessel shipping company t= obtain a 
firm price to ship to Miami if you are interested in this purchase= Chuck emailed me quote of $55,000 to ship to 
Savannah Ga, which =s nearest port of arrival for RoRo vessel shipping, same place we brought our=Bell 407 from UK. I 
will acquire a firm price for Port of Miami=20 arrival, unless we comply with airworthy items at PremiAir to make 
helicopt=r airworthy before shipping, 
-The helicopter has an interesting window shade system, which is electric window tint, it acutally worked well today. you 
pus= a button next to the window frame and it tints the window from Clea= to dark tint. It is an old school design that 
was quit expensive when it was f=rst introduced, and acts as a noise damper for interior noise levels. 
interior recap: 
- Wood is an 8 out of 10 great condition 
- the seat belts and air outsets are antique brushed bronze, almost ex=ct to our S76C++ 
- paint is 8 out of 10, very good quality paint job 
- leather seats are 3 out of 10, needs new leather 
- headliner is perfect, not change needed 
- Carpet is 6 out of 10 
- side panel trim is 5 out of 10, needs re-cover 
- USA registered still, 
items needed to comply: 
- new front cockpit windshield's, Captains definitely, co-pilots =aybe ok,.
