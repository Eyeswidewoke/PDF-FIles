More volatility ahead? 
Of course, much of the world's oil production is still under the sway of companies 
closely affiliated with governments and located in the Middle East and other volatile 
places. That share looks set to grow again in coming years. 
In December 2015, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) 
decided to abandon its usual production target. For Saudi Arabia in particular, the 
main goal appears to be to maintain market share by driving higher cost producers 
out of the market. Among Gulf producers, fears are also growing that some of the 
oil demand might eventually be replaced by alternatives due to changes such as the 
growth in hybrid or electric cars in corning decades. This could make it even harder 
to maintain cartel discipline if and when prices recover. 
Tensions within OPEC are nothing new. Nor are wild swings in the oil price - as you 
might expect given high capital expenditure but low operating expenses in both 
shale and traditional oil exploration. Average short-run cash costs for all production 
methods are probably at about 
0/b, maybe even below. And cash costs might not 
even represent the lower limit of how far prices could fall in the short term. Some of 
the costliest sources of oil, such as Canada's oil sands, are also costly to shut down 
once production gets going. Add concerns about dollar strengthening, possible 
bottlenecks in storage capacity, the vagaries and delays in physically moving crude 
oil and its derivatives. not to mention significant speculative inflows, and large 
movements - in both directions are all too plausible. 
Worse still, oil-price volatility might well be here to stay. Shale has added a new 
set of swing producers at price points along much of the supply curve. Many of 
their costs, including funding costs, will fluctuate across the economic cycle, and 
probably much more so than for traditional producers. And Saudi Arabia appears 
to be less ready than in previous cycles to step in and stabilize prices. For the rest of 
the world, this could create significant challenges, not least in monetary policy.

Decline in price, rise in volatility 
While market participants ars still vigilantly 
disc-Ins:Mg the positive and negative effects of 
lower oil pncas on economies and companies, 
this chart shows two factors that have 
undoubtedly contributed to the anxiety that 
oil has created the speed of the price decline 
and the increase in volatility, vdhich makes 
deaing with oil more tricky fortieth industrY 
and capital markets.
