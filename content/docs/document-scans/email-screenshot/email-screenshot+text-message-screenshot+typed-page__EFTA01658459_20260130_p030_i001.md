The New York Times (8/10, Hong, Rashbaum, Weiser, 18.61M) reports that President Trump, 
"seeking to block a subpoena for his tax returns, plans to ask a federal judge to order the 
Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., to disclose details about his investigation into 
the president's business practices, according to a letter filed on Monday." The Times says the 
letter, "which Mr. Trump's lawyers wrote to the federal judge in Manhattan, was in response to a 
filing from prosecutors in Mr. Vance's office, who argued last week that they had wide legal 
basis to subpoena eight years of the president's tax records and other financial documents." 
The Times adds that "in their letter, Mr. Trump's lawyers asked for a hearing to discuss whether 
Mr. Vance's office should be forced to disclose the justifications for the subpoena." 
Bloomberg (8/10, Van Voris, 4.73M) says Trump "disputed a suggestion" by Vance "that 
the panel may be looking into bank and insurance fraud at the Trump Organization." Vance "is 
investigating hush-money payments made before the 2016 presidential election to Stormy 
Daniels," but in a filing last week, he "suggested there might be grounds to look at possible 
fraud at the Trump Organization beyond the Daniels payment." Trump's lawyers argued, "If the 
district attorney convened the grand jury in order to investigate allegations discussed in these 
articles, he could've said so. ... But the bare fact that `there were public allegations of possible 
criminal activity; which is all these citations show, provides no insight into whether the grand 
jury is in fact investigating them and whether they were a basis for issuing this subpoena." 
INTERNATIONAL NEWS 
Azar Praises Taiwan's Coronavirus Response. 
The Washington Post (8/10, Shih, 14.2M) reports HHS Secretary Mar on Monday "praised 
Taiwan's handling of the novel coronavirus pandemic and reiterated US support for the island." 
Azar's three-day visit was prompted, he said, by Taiwan's "world-class" response to the 
coronavirus. To the Post, however, the trip, "in optics and rhetoric, was framed squarely against 
the backdrop of the escalating conflict between the Trump administration and the Chinese 
government." 
The AP (8/9, Lai) says Mar, whose visit "will likely exacerbate mounting tensions between 
Washington and Beijing," said Monday, "This visit represents an acknowledgment of the United 
States and Taiwan's deep friendship and partnership across security, economics, health care, 
and democratic open transparent values." The Wall Street Journal (8/10, Wong, Subscription 
Publication, 7.57M) reports Mar met Monday with President Tsai Ing-wen, who welcomed the 
Secretary saying, "Your visit testifies to the fact that over the past 40 years or so Taiwan-US. 
relations have never been better." 
China Deploys Fighter Jets As Azar Meets With Tsai. The Washington Times (8/10, 
Meier, 492K) reports China on Monday "briefly deployed two fighter jets across the midline of 
the Taiwan Strait" ahead of Azar's meeting with and Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen. The New 
York Times (8/9, Qin, 18.61M) reports the Chinese jets "were driven out by patrolling 
Taiwanese aircraft, Taiwan's Air Force Command said in a statement released by the defense 
ministry." Beijing also "lodged a formal complaint with Washington about Mr. Azar's visit, vowing 
to take countermeasure"s as it warned the United States not to "gravely damage" relations. 
US Ignored Taiwan's Early Warnings About China Hiding Coronavirus. The 
Washington Post (8/9, Rauhala, 14.2M) reports, "It was Jan. 13, and Chuang Yin-ching, an 
infectious-disease specialist with the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control, was sitting in a 
conference room in Wuhan, China, listening to local health officials describe a mysterious new 
virus." By the time Chuang returned to Taiwan "two days later, he was convinced that China was 
hiding critical information. The next day, he held a news conference to warn the world. Taiwan 
took immediate action. The United States did not." To the Post, Azar's visit this week is "a 
chance for the United States and Taiwan to compare notes on the pandemic."
