For the reasons outlined above under "Background and Purpose of the Of=er", on May 3, 1999, the Company entered 
into an agreement with Mr. Wexner and t=e Trust (the "Rescission Agreement") rescinding the Contingent Stoc= 
Redemption Agreement, releasing the approximately $352 million of restricted funds thereunder and enabling the 
Company to discontinue the credit support arrangements relating to its obligations under the Contingent Stock 
Redempt=on Agreement. Pursuant to the Rescission Agreement, Mr. Wexner, affiliated entities and members of Mr. 
Wexner's immediate family have agreed not t= tender any Shares pursuant to the Offer and have represented that they 
have=no current plan or intention to sell or otherwise dispose of any Shares or sto=k in Limited Too after the Limited 
Too spinoff. 
12. Regulatory Approvals. 
The Company is not aware of any approval or other action by any government or governmental, administrative or 
regulatory authority or agency, domestic=or foreign, that would be required for the Company's acquisition or owners=ip 
of Shares as contemplated by the Offer or of any license or regulatory permit that appears to be material to its business 
that might be adversely affecte= by its acquisition of Shares as contemplated in the Offer. Should any such approval or 
other action be required, the Company currently contemplates th=t it will seek such approval or other action. The 
Company cannot predict whet=er it may determine that it is required to delay the acceptance of, or payment for, Shares 
tendered pursuant to the Offer pending the outcome of any such matter. There can be no assurance that any such 
approval or other action, i= needed, would be obtained or would be obtained without substantial conditio=s or that the 
failure to obtain any such approval or other action might not result in adverse consequences to the Company's business. 
The Company&#=9;s obligations under the Offer to accept for payment and pay for Shares are subject to certain 
conditions. See Section 6. 
13. Certain Federal Income Tax Consequences. 
The following describes the material United States federal tax consequences relevant to the Offer. This discussion is 
based upon the Internal Revenue C=de of 1986, as amended to the date hereof (the "Code"), existing and=proposed 
Treasury Regulations, administrative pronouncements and judicial decisions, changes to which could materially affect 
the tax consequences described her=in and could be made on a retroactive basis. 
This discussion deals only with Shares held as capital assets and does not deal with all tax consequences that may be 
relevant to all categories of holders (such as dealers in securities or commodities, insurance companies, tax-exempt 
organizations or persons who hold Shares as a position in a straddle). In particular, different rules may apply to Shares 
acquired as compensation (including Shares acquired upon the exercise of options, the vesting of restricted Shares or 
Shares held by the Trustee of the Company&#=9;s Savings and Retirement Plan). This discussion does not address the 
state, local or foreign tax consequences of participating in the Offer. Holders of Shares should consult their tax advisors 
as to the particular consequences =o them of participation in the Offer. 
As used herein, a "Holder" means a beneficial holder of Shares th=t is a citizen or resident of the United States, a 
corporation or a partnership created or organized under the laws of the United States or any State there=f, or an estate 
or trust the income of which is subject to United States feder=l income taxation regardless of its source. 
Non-Participation in the Offer. Holders of Shares who do not participate in the Offer will not incur any tax liability as a 
result of the consummation =f the Offer. 
Exchange of Shares Pursuant to the Offer. An exchange of Shares for cash pursuant to the Offer will be a taxable 
transaction for United States feder=l income tax purposes. A Holder who participates in the Offer will, depending=on 
such Holder's particular circumstances, be treated either as recognizin= gain or loss from the disposition of the Shares or 
as receiving a dividend distribution from the Company.
