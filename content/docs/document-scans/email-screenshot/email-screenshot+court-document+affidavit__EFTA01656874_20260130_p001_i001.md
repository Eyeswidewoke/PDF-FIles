SIGNIFICANT NEWS EVENTS 
FBI Agents Are Again Pulled From Their Day Jobs to Address a Trump Priority 
CNN (08/13, Lybrand, Perez, Campbell) reported that FBI agents are being pulled from their day jobs to patrol the streets of Washington, DC, as part of President 
Donald Trump's declaration of a crime emergency, despite not being trained for community policing. According to the article, agents are being assigned to roles 
outside their expertise, including patrolling with local police, reviewing Jeffrey Epstein files, and assisting ICE with immigration enforcement, which may hinder 
national security investigations. The article noted that the reassignments have raised concerns among agents and law enforcement officials, who fear a brain drain 
and low morale, with many considering departing the FBI for other agencies or the private sector. 
Former Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan Exec Gambled Away Investor Funds for His Online Casino Company 
CNBC (08/13, Mangan) reported that federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York have unsealed an indictment against Richard Kim, former CEO of 
Zero Edge Corporation, charging him with securities and wire fraud for allegedly defrauding investors by misrepresenting the use of their funds. Kim founded Zero 
Edge in March 2024, claiming he would develop a blockchain-based casino app, but prosecutors allege he diverted roughly $3.8 million from a $4.3 million seed 
financing round into personal cryptocurrency accounts for speculative trades and gambling on an online casino, losing most of the funds within a week. Although 
he admitted in emails to being solely responsible for the $3.67 million loss, Kim initially misled investors by attributing the losses to a "treasury management 
strategy" rather than personal gambling. Kim admitted to the FBI that his actions were "clearly wrong from the beginning" and "completely unjustifiable," citing a 
gambling addiction. In a joint press release, New York Field Office FBI Assistant Director in Charge Christopher G. Raia stated, "Richard Kim allegedly 
misappropriated millions of investors' dollars intended to develop his online casino company by redirecting these funds for personal gambling and trading 
ventures, Kim allegedly hedged his bets that false assurances would induce more investments and conceal the true nature of his spending. The FBI remains 
committed to apprehending any individual who leverages executive positions to defraud others for selfish purposes!' 
New York Man Accused of Stalking, Harassing Family of Slain Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson 
NBC News (08/13, Li) reported that federal prosecutors in Albany have charged 40-year-old Shane Daley of Galway, New York, with stalking and harassing the 
family of slain UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. Authorities allege that between December 4 and December 7—just days after Thompson was fatally shot in 
midtown Manhattan—Daley left threatening and disturbing voicemails for one of Thompson's family members, expressing satisfaction over the killing and saying 
Thompson's children deserved the same fate. Christopher Raia, assistant director in charge of the FBI's New York office, said Daley's calls were "more than callous
