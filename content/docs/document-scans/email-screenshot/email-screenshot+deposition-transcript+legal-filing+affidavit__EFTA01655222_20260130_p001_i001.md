Director Patel Supports President Trump's FBI Budget Proposal After House Testimony 
Fox News (05/08, Chu, Arias) and the New York Times (05/08, Barrett) reported that Director Patel on Wednesday said he fully backed the 
Trump administration's proposed FBI budget after testifying to a House panel. "As I said today during my testimony, I am in full support of 
President Trump's budget, which fully funds the FBI and its critical mission. Any suggestion to the contrary is wrong and dishonest," Director 
Patel said following the hearing before the House Appropriations Committee. The article explained that the proposal, introduced last Friday, 
would cut the FBI's budget by $545 million as part of President Donald Trump's plan to slash government spending by $163 billion. "We cannot 
cover down on the mission at the levels that we would have to go to, which would be the 2011 levels, should all the budget cuts you just outlined 
be implemented," Director Patel said during his testimony. He also urged the panel to approve a budget that would combat what he described as 
increased levels of crime and terrorism across the country. Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, noted that the agency's deadline for 
submitting its spending plan for the current year had passed a week ago, and that lawmakers could not draft a budget without one. Asked by 
Murray when lawmakers would see the spending plan, Director Patel replied, "I don't have an answer." "I am doing the best I can: he added. "I 
can't make up answers: Murray called that response "insufficient and deeply disturbing." Senator John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana, pressed 
him on the expected release of more documents involving the financier Jeffrey Epstein, who hung himself in a federal Jail while awaiting trial on 
sex•trafficking charges. An earlier release of some material was met with derision by right•wing pundits and online influencers, who have long 
insisted that the government is covering up evidence of broader crimes committed by elites. "When do you think you'll have it done, Kash?" 
Kennedy asked. "I think in the near future, sir," Director Patel replied. "Like before I die?" Kennedy responded tartly. "Senator, we've been working 
on that, and we're doing it in a way that protects victims and also doesn't put out into the ether information that is irrelevant," he said. The 
Washington Times (05/08, Picket) added that Senator Murray clashed with Director Patel over accusations of weaponizing the bureau against 
President 'frump's "perceived enemies". Director Patel denied the accusations, citing the FBI's achievements, such as 8,276 federal arrests and 
3,000 firearms seized, and stated that he is not politicizing the bureau. WVNews (05/08, Staff Writer) reported that among senators who 
questioned Director Patel was Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R•WV). Capito directed much of her questioning toward the FBI's Criminal justice 
Information System facility in Clarksburg., know on April 17, you traveled to West Virginia to visit the CJIS facility: Capito told Director Patel. "I 
think It's amazing the work that they do out there. The employees out there really appreciated your visit. You've already mentioned that maybe 
some of the diffusing of some of the Washington, D.C. FBI would be going to, hopefully, into the Clarksburg facility. What was your impression 
when you were there; did they have the resources to do everything they need to do?" Director Patel responded: "My general impression aligns 
with yours. I was wildly impressed with the work that's done out there. It's the unsexy work that the FBI does on a daily basis, whether it's gun 
background checks, national criminal information background checks. State and local law enforcement relies on us, and every time they have a 
traffic stop, they're calling and adjudicate the individual they're confronting or when they're going to get a search warrant" Director Patel noted 
he would like to see further expansion of the facility's capabilities. "You can never have enough computer data being ingested: he said. "What I'm 
working on specifically to improve CJIS, which will improve the work that happens in every single state, is the reporting in data cycle from state 
and local authorities, because without that, CJIS doesn't work." Capito then asked about the agency's recruiting efforts, which Director Patel said 
have increased significantly, growing from an average monthly application pool of about 2,700 to about 5,700 per month for his first two full 
months as FBI director. WGME (CBS•13) (05/08, Staff Writer) reported that the FBI says it's ramping up its response to illegal marijuana grow
