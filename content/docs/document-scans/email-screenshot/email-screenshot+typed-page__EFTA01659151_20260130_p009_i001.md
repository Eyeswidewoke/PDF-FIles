Fox News (12/7, McKay, 27.59M) reports that amid speculation "over the declining health of 
Iran's Supreme Leader, the Grand Ayatollah Ali Khamenei," there were "unconfirmed reports 
over the weekend" he had "transferred power to his son, cleric Sayyid Mojtaba Hosseini 
Khamenei." The son "has seen as a potential successor to his father's throne" for over a decade, 
and his "increasingly dogmatic role overseeing numerous security and intelligence departments 
are viewed as part of the grooming process to ascend to the top spot, according to the 
Jerusalem Post." He has "been profiled as a mostly hardline, conservative figure - even more 
refractory than his father - with especially tight ties" to the IRGC. However, the "process of 
succession isn't quite as simple as the Ayatollah merely making a preference. Iran has 
constitutional laws with regards to the process of choosing the next-in-line."

whether Aubrey Trail will get the death penalty for the killing of a 24-year-old Lincoln woman

the Journal Star, "On Friday, the defense filed a motion to continue the aggravation and 
mitigation hearing, which was set to start next week in Wilber. In the filing, attorney Ben 
Murray listed a number of COVID-related reasons prompting him to ask for a continuance. 
Among them, that the pandemic was making it impossible for out-of-state witnesses, who 
included Trail's relatives in Tennessee, to travel to Nebraska. 'The present pandemic 
substantially impairs counsel's ability to take on the "extraordinary responsibility" of 
representing a person whose life is at stake and provide effective representation,' he wrote."

The Independence (MO) Examiner (12/7, Hancock, 13K) reports, "The head of Missouri's 
medical marijuana program testified under oath that a grand jury subpoena his agency received 
late last year was likely connected to an FBI investigation in Independence." The Examiner 
adds, "The revelation by Lyndall Fraker, director of medical marijuana regulation at the Missouri

subpoena. In November 2019, the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services received

demanded the agency turn over all records pertaining to four medical marijuana license
