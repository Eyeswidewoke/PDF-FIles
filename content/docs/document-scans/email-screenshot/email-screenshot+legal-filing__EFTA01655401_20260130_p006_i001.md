Virginia Man Gets Four Years for Sending National Defense Information to Agents of Chinese Government 
The Associated Press (09/05, Cullum) reported that Michael Charles Schena, a former State Department foreign 
affairs officer, was sentenced to four years in prison for conspiring to pass national defense information to 
individuals he believed were agents of the Chinese government. According to the article, Schena admitted upon his 
arrest, "I'm a traitor," after investigators discovered he had provided classified documents in exchange for 
payments totaling over $37,000 between 2023 and 2025, including a $10,000 cash handoff at a hotel in Lima, Peru, 
along with an iPhone for secret communications. The article explained that Schena was caught in February 
photographing classified materials at his workstation, later confessing he planned to send them to Chinese 
government contacts. U.S. Attorney Erik S. Siebert said, "The price of Michael Schena's disgraceful betrayal of his 
country is far more than the paltry amount for which he traded his honor: while Assistant Attorney General John A. 
Eisenberg warned the sentence should deter others from "betraying their country." The article noted that FBI 
Counterintelligence Division Assistant Director Roman Rozhaysky said Schena put American lives at risk: "The 
Chinese government continues to aggressively target U.S. government employees to steal our classified 
information, and this sentencing makes clear the FBI and our partners will do everything in our power to defend 
the Homeland. Anyone thinking of betraying their oath to the United States should consider the severe 
consequences and know the FBI will work tirelessly to bring them to justice." The case was investigated by the FBI 
Washington Field Office, the FBI Richmond Field Office, the Department of Justice's Office of Enforcement 
Operations, and the Department of State's Diplomatic Security Service Office of Counterintelligence. NTD and KATV 
(ABC-7) (09/05, Domingo) also reported on the story. 
FBI Must Combat CCP-Linked Threats Targeting Faith Group on U.S. Soil, Lawmaker Says 
The Epoch Times (09/06, Li) reported that Rep. Barry Loudermilk (R-Ga.) said the FBI and U.S. intelligence agencies 
must prioritize countering the CCP's transnational repression campaigns, which he described as a direct threat to 
U.S. interests and even "a form of terrorism." According to the article, Loudermilk cited bomb threats falsely linking 
Falun Gong practitioners to planned attacks at the Kennedy Center in February and during the U.S. Army's 250th 
anniversary parade in June, as well as past CCP efforts to intimidate Shen Yun Performing Arts and strip it of 
nonprofit status through bribery and lawsuits. The article explained that one bribery attempt in New York was 
foiled after the intermediary turned out to be an FBI informant, leading to a 20-month prison sentence for Chen 
Jun, a Chinese community leader acting under CCP orders. Loudermilk said, "One of the measures to address this is 
rebuilding the FBI to get the FBI refocused on looking at issues of domestic terrorism or international terrorism 
here on our shores. We need to return the FBI to its real job—which is protecting the American people, not being a 
political arm of one party or the other." The article noted that Loudermilk emphasized expanding executive 
authority to crack down on CCP infiltration across U.S. institutions, including universities, arts organizations, and 
technology companies, warning that many Chinese nationals in these sectors may be advancing CCP interests 
rather than purely academic or professional goals. 
Feds Are 'Pretty Confident' They Have a Strong Case Against John Bokon 
The Sun (09/05, Rosen) reported that the August FBI raid at former National Security Advisor John Bolton's 
Maryland home was part of a federal investigation into potential violations of the Espionage Act and laws on 
unauthorized retention of classified documents, according to a newly unsealed search warrant. According to the 
article, FBI investigators recovered computers, phones, hard drives, and folders labeled "Trump I-IV," with a senior 
law enforcement official telling the Sun that the Trump administration is "pretty confident" it now has a strong case 
against Bolton. The article explained that the raid was ordered by Director Patel, who described it as the reopening 
of a "national security probe" launched in 2020 after the Trump White House accused Bolton of mishandling 
classified information in his memoir The Room Where It Happened, a case later dropped by the Biden 
administration. The article noted that Trump denied direct involvement in the raid but drew parallels to the 2022 
FBI search of Mar-a-Lago, which led to now-dismissed Espionage Act charges against him, while expressing rare 
sympathy for Bolton despite their personal feud. The article added that the raid has not silenced Bolton's criticism 
of Trump, as he continues to accuse the former president of strategic failures benefiting U.S. adversaries like China 
and Russia.

National Review (09/05, Lynch) reported that former FBI official Charles McGonigal, who once led the bureau's

conglomerate CEFC to an employee tied to Hunter Biden, according to a Justice Department inspector general
