Department." USA TODAY (06/05, Russell) explained that Garland testified for nearly five hours on a variety of 
topics before the House Judiciary Committee, addressing allegations from former President Donald Trump's 
Republican allies who questioned the integrity of the Justice Department. Committee chair Representative Jim 
Jordan of Ohio stated, "Many Americans believe there's now a double standard of our justice system. They believe 
that because there is." In his defense, Garland emphasized the importance of maintaining the integrity of the 
Justice Department's operations, saying, "I view contempt as a serious matter. But I will not jeopardize the ability of 
our prosecutors and agents to do their jobs effectively in future investigations. I will not be intimidated." 
Director Wray Testifies Before Senate Appropriations Subcommittee 
According to the New York Post article, Director Wray echoed these concerns in his testimony earlier the same day 
before a subcommittee of the Senate Appropriations Committee. Director Wray emphasized the elevated nature of 
current threats, stating, "I'd be hard-pressed to think of a time where so many threats to our public safety and 
national security were so elevated all at once." He further noted that the ongoing conflict in Gaza has significantly 
increased the threats against the U.S., bringing them to "a whole 'nother level" and contributing to a rise in 
antisemitism and hate crimes. The Epoch Times (06/05, Duchamps) noted that Director Wray also made his case on 
the FBI's budget request totaling $11.3 billion for Fiscal Year 2025, saying the requested resources are crucial for 
the law enforcement agency to continue "national security, intelligence, criminal law enforcement, and criminal 
justice services missions." In a statement, Director Wray said, "As described in this threat summary, our adversaries 
are not scaling back their efforts because of the constrained budget environment. In fact, threat actors may try to 
take advantage of federal budget reductions to conduct nefarious activities. The FBI cannot afford to be playing 
catch-up to the People's Republic of China, Hamas, transnational organized criminals coming across the border, and 
cyber actors. With the requested resources, the FBI will have the talent, tools, and authorities to do more to 
protect the American people and uphold the Constitution." Director Wray also noted that the FBI has no 
information to indicate whether Hamas has either the intent or capability to conduct a terrorist attack inside the 
United States but pointed out that the agency cannot discount that possibility because of the likelihood of "Hamas 
supporters engaging in violence on the group's behalf." "We are concerned with any FTO (Foreign Terrorist 
Organization) that may exploit the attacks in Israel as a tool to mobilize their followers around the world. In recent 
years, there have been several events and incidents in the United States that were purportedly motivated, at least 
in part, by the conflict between Israel and Hamas," he said. Another article from The Epoch Times (06/05, Phillips) 
reported that Director Wray stated that the United States needs "a whole lot more from Mexico" to effectively 
combat drug cartels and stop the flow of narcotics into the country. Director Wray acknowledged some successes 
with Mexico but emphasized, "We need a whole lot more from Mexico than we've gotten in terms of shutting 
down the cartels and stopping the flow of the precursors." He also highlighted a recent FBI raid in New Mexico that 
uncovered enough fentanyl to kill hundreds of thousands of people, along with "hand grenades, ballistic vests, you 
know, the whole nine yards." Additionally, Director Wray testified that threats against the Jewish community in the 
U.S. have risen since the Hamas attack on Israeli civilians on October 7, noting, "Religiously motivated hate crimes, 
close to 60 percent of them, are targeted at the Jewish community." 
Additionally, WABI (CBS-5) (06/05, Whaley) and WGME (CBS-13) (06/05, Murtagh) reported that Director Wray 
addressed the issue of illegal marijuana grow operations in Maine, following questioning from Sen. Susan Collins. 
Collins highlighted a recent bust in Somerset County involving 1,500 marijuana plants and other drug-related 
materials. Director Wray explained, "Our assessment is that it's a combination of the fact that it is activity that can 
be done relatively cheaply, and by comparison to other drugs in the United States, the consequences that they face 
from a legal perspective are not as severe as that they might be in other countries where they might also want to 
operate. So, it makes for an attractive business proposition." He noted the absence of ties to the Chinese 
government but confirmed links to Chinese organized crime and mentioned that illegal grows are also appearing on 
tribal lands.
