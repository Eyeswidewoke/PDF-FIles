vaccine availability." On CNN's "State of the Union," Giroir said, "In front of the Senate, Dr. 
Redfield and I both said that a vaccine that would be widely available in hundreds of millions of 
doses would not likely happen until mid-2021. That is a fact." However, he also said the 
President was correct in saying that "we could have as many as a hundred million doses by the 
end of this year. That is correct. I think everybody is right." 
Former FDA Chiefs: Vaccine Approval Process Can Be Trusted. Former FDA 
commissioners Scott Gottlieb and Mark McClellan write in the Wall Street Journal (9/20, 
Subscription Publication, 7.57M) that the health agency's thorough and transparent approval 
process for a potential coronavirus vaccine won't be compromised and the public should be 
reassured.

US To Sanction Two Dozen Targets Tied To Iran Arms Sales. 
Reuters (9/20, Mohammed) reports the US on Monday will sanction "more than two dozen 
people and entities involved in Iran's nuclear, missile and conventional arms programs, a senior 
US official said." The official "said Iran could have enough fissile material for a nuclear weapon 
by the end of the year and that Tehran has resumed long-range missile cooperation with 
nuclear-armed North Korea." However, he "did not provide detailed evidence regarding either 
assertion." The senior US official told Reuters, "Iran is clearly doing everything it can to keep in 
existence a virtual turnkey capability to get back into the weatherization business at a 
moment's notice should it choose to do so." 
Rouhani Dismisses US Efforts To Reimpose UN Sanctions. 
The AP (9/20, Vandat) reports Iranian President Hassan Rouhani "dismissed US efforts to 
restore all UN sanctions on the country as mounting economic pressure from Washington 
pushed the local currency down to its lowest level ever on Sunday." Iran's currency "has lost 
more than 30% of its value to the dollar since June." Still, Rouhani "slammed the Trump 
Administration's declaration Saturday that all UN sanctions against Iran have been reimposed 
because Tehran is not complying with the nuclear deal." Said Rouhani, "If America uses its 
bullying...and does something in practice, it will have to face our decisive response." 
UN Chief: No UN Support For Reimposing Sanctions Now. The AP (9/20, Lederer) 
reports Secretary-General Antonio Guterres "says the United Nations will not support 
reimposing sanctions on Iran as the United States is demanding until he gets a green light from 
the Security Council." In a letter to the council president obtained Sunday, Guterres wrote that 
"there would appear to be uncertainty" on whether or not Secretary of State Pompeo triggered 
the "snapback" mechanism in the 2015 nuclear deal. The AP says the Administration "declared 
Saturday that all UN sanctions against Iran have been restored, a move most of the rest of the 
world rejects as illegal and is likely to ignore." 
The Washington Post (9/20, Morello, 14.2M) similarly says that "most of the world 
brushed off the US move and acted as if nothing had changed." To the Post, the US declaration 
Saturday "ushers in a new period of uncertainty and tension." 
Secretary of State Pompeo, on Fox News Sunday Morning FuturesVi (9/20, 1.66M), said, 
"There would have been a whole lot more things that would have taken place, absent the UN 
Security Council resolutions coming back into effect last night. Air defense system, arms sales, 
all of those in a couple weeks would have been permitted to have been sold and the Europeans 
have not joined us in this. They know we're right. They tell us privately we don't want the arm 
sales to come back and they put it in the letter they are very concerned about these sales, but 
they haven't lifted a finger and done the work that needs to be done. ... I hope they will get to 
the right place. They are still wedded to this silly nuclear deal that was signed now five years 
ago."
