appears to have decided, for reasons that remain murky, to scrap its proposal. ... Some of 
those who worked on the plan were told that it would be presented to President Trump and 
likely announced in the Rose Garden in early April. ... But no nationally coordinated testing 
strategy was ever announced. The plan, according to the participant, 'just went pool into thin 
air.'" 
FDA Issues Guidance For Companies Making At-Home Tests. 
Bloomberg (7/30, Alexander, Subscription Publication, 4K) reports "companies making at-home 
Covid-19 tests got new directions from the FDA Wednesday on submitting their tests for 
approval under emergency use conditions." The agency's "template is intended to help get 
simple at-home or over-the-counter diagnostic tests on the market, comparable to home 
pregnancy tests," according to FDA Commissioner Hahn. 
USA Today (7/30, Weintraub, Alltucker, 10.31M) reports Hahn said of the rapid-result at-
home tests, "These types of tests will be a game-changer in our fight against COVID-19 and will 
be crucial as the nation looks toward reopening." However, the agency has yet to approve a test 
for at-home use. The theory is that "screening at home, maybe once or twice a week, would 
allow people to test themselves before going to work or school, getting on an airplane, 
attending an event, or visiting an elderly relative" as the tests would provide relatively 
accurate, real-time results for consumers. 
Pentagon Researchers At Work On Developing COVID Antibody. 
The Washington Post (7/30, Sonne, 14.2M) reports on the Defense Advanced Research Projects 
Agency's efforts to develop "an antibody for covid-19. ... 'We have been thinking about and 
preparing for this for a long time, and it's almost a bit surreal,' said Amy Jenkins, manager of 
DARPA's antibody program, which is known as the Pandemic Prevention Platform, or P3." 
According to the Post, "In that program and others, DARPA has quietly been seeding the ground 
for the United States to produce a rapid cure for a pathogen like covid-19 for years." 
Johnson & Johnson Starts Human Vaccine Trials. 
The New York Post (7/30, O'Neill, 4.57M) reports Johnson & Johnson began human trials of its 
experimental COVID-19 vaccine on Thursday, "after the shots already proved successful in 
protecting monkeys, the drugmaker announced." The company pointed to a new study 
published Thursday in the journal Nature "which found that five out of six primates who got the 
single-dose shot were protected from infection when exposed to the coronavirus." 
WPost Weighs Use Of Volunteers In COVID Vaccine Trials. In a Spanish-language 
editorial, the Washington Post (7/30, Board, 14.2M) ponders the ethical questions behind the 
use of volunteers in coronavirus vaccine clinical trials. The Post does not come out on either 
side of the debate, but calls for the crafting of a "regulatory, medical and ethical infrastructure" 
for the use of volunteers now, even ahead of a decision on whether they will ultimately be used. 
Data Suggest Native American Communities Disproportionately Impacted By 
Coronavirus. 
The New York Times (7/30, Conger, Gebeloff, Oppel, 18.61M) reports that despite "significant 
gaps" in available data, "there are strong indications that Native Americans have been 
disproportionately affected by the coronavirus." A Times analysis found that the "rate of known 
cases in the eight counties with the largest populations of Native Americans is nearly double the 
national average." Although the "analysis cannot determine which individuals are testing 
positive for the virus," those counties "are home to one in six U.S. residents who describe 
themselves in census surveys as non-Hispanic and American Indian or Alaska Native." The 
Times adds that there are "many smaller counties with significant populations of Native 
Americans that have elevated case rates."
