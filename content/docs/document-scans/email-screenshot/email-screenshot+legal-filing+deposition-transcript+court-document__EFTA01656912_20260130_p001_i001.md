SIGNIFICANT NEWS EVENTS 
US. Violent Crime Fell 4.5% In 2024, Down for Second Year Running, FBI Says 
Reuters (08/05, Winter) reported that the FBI has reported that violent crime in the United States decreased by 4.5% in 2024, marking the 
second consecutive year of decline, with hate crimes also decreasing by 1.5%. According to the FBI's annual national crime report, which is based 
on data collected from 16,675 state and local law enforcement agencies, there was a significant decline in overall crime across the country 
following a pandemic•ea spike. The report highlighted a 14.9% drop in murder and non•negligent manslaughter, which is the lowest rate in nine 
years, and a 5.2% decline in incidents of rape, contributing to the overall decrease in violent crime. Additionally, the report noted that property 
crime offenses decreased nationwide in 2024, with an 8.1% decline in property crime, including an 8.6% decrease in burglaries and an 18.6% 
decline in motor vehicle theft. The article added that assaults on law enforcement officers reached a 10•year high in 2024, with 85,730 officers 
assaulted in the line of duty, and 64 law enforcement officers were feloniously killed in the line of duty, with firearms involved in 46 of those 
deaths. "Relevant data helps police fight violent crime by aiding in resource allocation, and it helps families learn more about their communities," 
FBI Assistant Director Timothy Ferguson said on a call with reporters on Tuesday. The article highlighted that in the next few weeks, FBI officials 
said, the bureau will start releasing monthly reports to better assist law enforcement agencies. "As we move toward monthly data releases and 
more agencies submit diverse data on a more frequent basis, we can produce an even more timely and accurate picture of crimes in the United 
States," Ferguson said. According to the Washington Examiner (08/05, Hallas), the FBI revealed on Tuesday that it is conducting a 'behavioral 
analysis study" into the uptick of attacks on law enforcement officers. "It's going to be a longer study, because we are doing a real, in•depth 
behavioral analysis study of why these are occurring," an official said. Additional reporting on the story was provided by CBS News (08/05, 
Schecter, Freiman), Fox News (08/05, Deppisch), Washington Times (08/05, Delaney), Associated Press (08/05, Staff Writer), NBC News (08/05, 
Atkins), Newsweek (08/05, Silverman, Mordowanec), CNN (08/05, Lybrand), USA Today (08/05, Palmer), and Center for American 
Progress (08/OS, Hall, Wilson, Eisenberg). 
House Oversight Chair Issues Subpoenas for Epstein Files 
CBS News (08/05, Quinn) reported that the House Oversight Committee has issued subpoenas to several former high•ranking government 
officials, Including former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, as part of an investigation into the case of convicted 
sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The subpoenas, which were approved by Republicans and Democrats on a House Oversight subcommittee last 
month, also target former attorneys general and FBI directors, including Merrick Garland, Bill Barr, Alberto Gonzales, Jeff Sessions, Loretta Lynch, 
Eric Holder, James Comey, and Robert Mueller, seeking their testimony about the Epstein case. According to the article, the committee is seeking 
information about the Justice Department's Investigation into Epstein and his associate Ghislalne Maxwell, and has also subpoenaed AG Bondi for 
related documents. The subpoenas are part of Congress's efforts to obtain more information about Epstein and to conduct oversight of the federal 
government's enforcement of sex trafficking laws. The Washington Post (08/05, Hawkins) reported that Maxwell, convicted of sex trafficking, has 
been transferred to the Bryan Federal Prison Camp in Texas, a minlmum•security facility, despite federal guidelines suggesting she should not be 
held in such a location. Corrections experts say Maxwell's transfer appears to be special treatment, possibly due to her cooperation with the
