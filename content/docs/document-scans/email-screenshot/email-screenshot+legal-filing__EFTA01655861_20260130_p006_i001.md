California Man Found Convicted for Threatening to 'Unabomb' FBI Field Office in L.A. 
KTLA (CW-5) (06/05, Schlepp) reported that Mark William Anten, a Los Angeles man, was found guilty of making 
violent threats, including threatening to "Unabomb" the FBI Field Office in Los Angeles. According to the article, 
Anten, who has been in custody since his arrest last December, sent multiple threatening emails to the FBI, 
boasting about his similarities to the Unabomber Ted Kaczynski. Despite being warned by FBI officers, Anten 
continued his threats, even sending emails about committing mass murder and making a dirty bomb. The article 
noted that the FBI investigated and arrested Anten, who was found guilty after a three-day trial and faces up to five 
years in federal prison for each count. "Even after being warned, Mr. Anten double-downed on his threats to 
murder FBI employees," said Krysti Hawkins, acting assistant director in charge of the FBI Field Office in L.A. "The 
FBI will not tolerate credible death threats to individuals or institutions and, as evidenced during the trial, neither 
did the jury." 
Canada Court Upholds Conviction and Life Sentence in Via Rail Terror Plot Case 
CBC (06/05, Loriggio) reported that Ontario's highest court upheld the conviction and life sentence of Raed Jaser, 
one of the men convicted in the plot to derail a passenger train between Canada and the U.S. According to the 
article, laser's appeal argued that the trial judge's refusal to separate his case from co-accused Chiheb Esseghaier's 
compromised the trial's fairness, but the Court of Appeal found the joint trial decision reasonable. The article 
noted that Jaser also claimed the trial was influenced by an undercover FBI agent's involvement, but the court 
rejected this, noting the terrorist plot was already planned. The court confirmed that the trial was fair and 
dismissed Jaser's appeal. The article explained that this is the second time the Appeal Court has weighed in on 
Jaser and Esseghaier's case. They were found guilty in 2015 on a total of eight terror-related charges between 
them. 
Opinion: Russian Migrant Terrorist Case Clearly Shows the Danger of Open Borders 
An opinion piece from the New York Post (06/05, Bensman) reported that Russian national Murat Kurashev, who 
entered the U.S. illegally via the Southwest Border, was sentenced to 12 years in prison for financing terrorism. 
According to the article, Kurashev, from the terrorism-prone Kabardino-Balkaria region, sent $13,000 to the al-
Qaeda-affiliated group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which used the funds to buy combat equipment. "The FBI assesses 
that, had he not been arrested, he may have become an operational participant in terrorist activities," the 
investigating FBI agent told the Sacrament court at one point. "Kurashev's behavior firmly places him on the 
continuum for mobilizing to violence." The article noted that Director Wray, and a variety of former homeland 
security officials have warned that these circumstances have exposed America to an unprecedented risk of Islamic 
terrorist infiltration and attack. The author assessed that Kurashev's case exemplifies the dangers of open borders 
and raises concerns about other potential terrorists entering the U.S. undetected.

US, 'Five Eyes' Allies Warn China Recruiting Western Military Trainers 
Reuters (06/05, Landay, Martina) reported that the U.S. and its "Five Eyes" allies issued a warning about China 
recruiting current and former Western military pilots to train the Chinese military, which could reduce Western 
deterrence capabilities. According to the article, the intelligence services of the U.S., UK, Canada, Australia, and 
New Zealand highlighted concerns over Chinese espionage, cyber hacking, and intellectual property theft, with the 
PLA using private companies to hire Western personnel. The article noted that the Five Eyes agencies asked people 
to guard against such offers, which they said often entail promises of lucrative salaries or excessive flattery, and to 
report any attempts to the FBI or military investigators in their countries. The article referenced the case of former 
U.S. Marine pilot Daniel Duggan, who faces charges in the U.S. for training Chinese military pilots. NBC News 
(06/05, Luce) added that in March, U.S. Army intelligence analyst Korbein Schultz was arrested and charged with 
conspiring to sell sensitive defense information to China. He has pleaded not guilty. And in August last year, two 
Navy sailors were arrested for allegedly relaying sensitive military information to China. Wenheng 
Zhao pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 27 months. Jinchao Wei has pleaded not guilty. "These arrests are a 
reminder of the relentless, aggressive efforts of the People's Republic of China to undermine our democracy and 
threaten those who defend it," assistant director of the FBI's Counterintelligence Division Suzanne Turner said at 
the time. Additional reporting on the story was provided by VOA News (06/05, Seldin), CNN (06/05, Lillis, Britzky),
