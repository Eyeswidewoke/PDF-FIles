a cyberattack at one of its key vendors exposed data." According to a statement from an SEI 
spokesperson, the attack involved data "on clients of SEI Investments Co." The spokesperson 
"said one of SEI Investments' vendors, M.J. Brunner Inc., was breached in a ransomware attack 
that occurred on May 17, and the root cause was not related to vulnerability of SEI's systems." 
The spokesperson said, "We take our clients' security very seriously, and we are working with 
Brunner, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and our impacted clients to understand the extent 
to which SEI's or our clients' data has been exposed." A representative for M.J. Brunner "said 
the firm is `confident that we have contained the incident and there is no further risk to our 
network." 
The Wall Street Journal (7/27, Tokar, Rundle, Chung, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) 
reports the ransomware attack uncovered in May exposed the personal data of investors in 
about 100 of the fund administrator's clients. Angelo Gordon & Co., Graham Capital 
Management, Fortress Investment Group LLC, Centerbridge Partners and Pacific Investment 
Management Co. were cited as funds effected by the attack. 
House Spending Bill Details Funding For Cyber Defenses. 
Politico (7/27, Starks, 4.29M) reports in its Cybersecurity newsletter that the House this week 
"is set to consider a $1.4 trillion, seven-bill spending package (H.R. 7667) - although one of 
them, the DHS bill, is so controversial it might derail the whole shebang, what with constant 
border fights and disputes over the Trump Administration deploying federal officers to protests." 
The division-by-division summary "said the bill would provide nearly $12 million to create a 
Joint Cyber Center for National Cyber Defense, but doesn't say much about what it would do." 
The committee report "said it would `serve as a coordinating entity that will help the 
Department identify strategic priorities and synchronize cyber-related activities across the 
operational components." It also "spells out cyber-spending increases at CISA for specific 
purposes, such as ransomware against state and local governments, awareness campaigns, 
supply chain risks, vulnerability management and the Multi-State Information Sharing and 
Analysis Center." 
Cyberstalker Gets Four Years In Prison For "War" On Woman. 
The AP (7/27, Kunzelman) reports that, "less than two months after their office romance 
ended, Ahmad Kazzelbach began tampering with the email and social media accounts of the 
Baltimore woman who broke up with him." He "changed her Instagram username to include the 
word `whore." That was only the "start of a vicious cyberstalking campaign that would escalate 
steadily over the next year." Before FBI agents "arrested her ex-boyfriend, the woman was 
wrongfully arrested twice and spent four nights in jail based on a string of false police reports 
that he made." Kazzelbach "was sentenced on Monday to four years in prison for his online 
harassment of the woman, who is identified by her initials "J.K." in court records." US District 
Judge James Bredar "said Kazzelbach repeatedly lied to police and court officials to essentially 
`wage war' against his ex-girlfriend." 
DOD Issues RFI With Goal Of Advancing Cybersecurity Technology. 
FedScoop (7/27, Mitchell) reports that the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and 
Engineering "issued a request for information late last week, asking for help building out a 
roadmap of science and technology activities related to advances in cybersecurity over the next 
two-and-a-half decades in line with the 2018 National Defense Strategy." The solicitation "asks 
interested parties to help inform the Pentagon's future cybersecurity guideposts by sharing 
`their R&D projections, technical capabilities, and demonstrated experiences in cybersecurity 
and cyberspace operations,' the RFI says." Under the 2020 National Defense Authorization Act -
not yet passed - the Undersecretary of Defense for Research and Engineering "will be required 
to submit annual reports on cyber S&T starting in fiscal 2021."
