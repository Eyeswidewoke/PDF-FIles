and the Trump administration ramps up its attacks on Beijing." The survey, published Thursday 
by the nonpartisan Pew Research Center, "found a sharp uptick in the number of Americans 
who see China unfavorably." In 2018, "just 47% of Americans held unfavorable views of China, 
but that figure has jumped 26% since then - to 73%, the highest level in the 15 years Pew has 
measured Americans' attitudes toward Beijing." To the Washington Examiner (7/30, Crilly, 
448K), the Pew findings "cement the issue as one of the top election questions facing two 
candidates who have tussled over who can better play hardball with Beijing." 
Four Hong Kong Activists Arrested For Online Posts Under New Security Law. 
The Washington Post (7/30, O'Grady, 14.2M) reports that in "some of the most high-profile 
detentions" in Hong Kong since Beijing imposed "a controversial national security law late last 
month," police arrested four people between the ages of 16 and 21 on suspicion of inciting 
secession. The New York Times (7/30, Ramzy, Yu, 18.61M) reports the four were arrested "over 
social media posts that called for the city to become independent from China, in what appears 
to be the first targeted detentions of activists" under the new law. 
US Ambassador To Russia Dismisses Conviction Of Marine Vet As "Absurd." 
The New York Times (7/30, Nechepurenko, 18.61M) reports Trevor Reed, a former US Marine 
who "traveled to Moscow" in May 2019 "to spend the summer with his Russian girlfriend and 
take some language lessons," was, "by August...in jail, facing charges of assaulting and 
endangering the lives of two police officers, accusations that his family and supporters say are 
fraudulent and politically motivated." On Thursday, "a court in Moscow sentenced Mr. Reed to 
nine years in prison for the August 2019 episode. He has already spent more than 11 months in 
a Russian jail." 
The Washington Post (7/30, Dixon, 14.2M) reports that Reed "told journalists the case 
was `clearly political,' and John Sullivan, the US Ambassador to Russia, "described the evidence 
used to convict Reed as `ridiculous." Sullivan is quoted as saying, "Today, US citizen Trevor 
Reed was convicted and sentenced to nine years in a Russian prison based on evidence so 
ridiculous that even the judge laughed in court. This was theater of the absurd." 
Russia Demands Belarus Explain "Odious" Detention Of Alleged Mercenaries. 
Reuters (7/30, Osborn, Makhovsky) reports Russia "demanded an explanation" from Belarus on 
Thursday over "what it called Minsk's wrongful arrest of a group of alleged Russian mercenaries 
accused of plotting acts of terrorism." Belarusian state television broadcast footage on 
Wednesday of "more than 30 suspected Russian private military contractors being detained" 
near Minsk. Authorities "said they had received information that over 200 fighters had entered 
the country to destabilize it before an Aug. 9 presidential election." Kremlin spokesman Dmitry 
Peskov "said Moscow wanted an exhaustive explanation from Belarus about the detention." 
Democrats Slam Decision To Move US Troops Out Of Germany As Gift To Putin. 
The Washington Post (7/30, Hudson, 14.2M) reports on Thursday, Secretary of State Pompeo 
"clashed bitterly with Democrats on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee." Pompeo was 
"grilled" about the Administration's "decision to withdraw 12,000 troops from Germany and 
Pompeo's firing of the department's internal watchdog, who had been investigating alleged 
wrongdoing by him and his wife." Ranking member Sen. Robert Menendez (D-NJ) "said the U.S. 
administration had 'abetted' Russian President Vladimir Putin by withdrawing the troops from 
Germany and took aim at the central focus of Pompeo's tenure, Iran, noting that the country `is 
much closer to a nuclear bomb than when you came into office.' Menendez also "said that for 
all of Pompeo's `bluster against China,' it has not stopped Beijing's `march in the South China 
Sea' or its `suppressing and oppressing its own people' in Hong Kong." 
Politico (7/30, Toosi, 4.29M) reports that in his Senate testimony, Pompeo "claimed he did 
not interact significantly with Marie Yovanovitch, the former ambassador to Ukraine who was 
ousted in 2019 after she defied Trump administration orders by cooperating with House 
investigations" into President Trump. Pompeo "also defended the Trump administration's
