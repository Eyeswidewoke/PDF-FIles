was raised, and that these practices created a "blind spot" that compromised national security. According to the 
article, the disclosure detailed multiple instances in which senior FBI counterintelligence officials refused to open 
investigations into executives—even when provided credible intelligence—including a case involving a retired 
assistant director suspected of keeping classified material at home and another in which an official blocked the 
opening of a case in which he was himself a potential anonymous subject. The article further reported that the 
whistleblower said the FBI had not apprehended any employee involved in espionage since the 2001 Robert 
Hanssen case, that significant portions of former counterintelligence chief Charles McGonigal's activities went 
unexamined, and that internal failures allowed espionage to continue for years and cost millions due to 
compromised technology. The article noted that Rep. Thomas Massie called the situation an intentional "blind 
spot," that the disclosure claimed certain officials involved in the Mar-a-Lago search had also run off-the-books 
operations against Trump's first campaign, and that the whistleblower and a retired FBI supervisor are willing to 
provide further testimony to Congress regarding systemic failures in FBI counterintelligence oversight. 
China Just Escalated Its Al War Against America 
Daily Signal (11/20, Pavlich) reported that China has escalated its cyber-aggression against the United States by 
weaponizing artificial intelligence to autonomously carry out sophisticated cyberattacks on critical infrastructure. 
Prosecutors noted that Anthropic detected in September 2025 an unprecedented espionage campaign in which a 
Chinese state-sponsored group manipulated its Claude Code tool to attempt infiltration of roughly thirty global 
targets, successfully breaching a small number involving major tech companies, financial institutions, chemical 
manufacturers, and government agencies. According to the article, Anthropic assessed with high confidence that 
the attack represented "the first documented case of a large-scale cyberattack executed without substantial human 
intervention," relying on advanced Al capabilities that did not exist in comparable form just a year earlier. The 
article further reported that the Chinese Communist Party is simultaneously targeting local infrastructure—
including water systems, electric grids, gas plants, ports, communication networks, and transportation systems—
thereby "stretching the capacity of the FBI and other federal agencies" as they attempt to thwart these attacks. The 
article noted that officials warn the U.S. must rapidly strengthen both defensive and offensive Al capabilities, with 
national security leaders deeming American victory in the Al race "non-negotiable" in order to protect civilians and 
prevent China from triggering a crisis of its own making. 
Analysis: Five Eyes Become Three Blind Mice 
An analysis from the Washington Monthly (11/20, Kounalakis) reported that the longstanding Five Eyes intelligence 
alliance is now strained because member nations increasingly distrust U.S. intelligence practices under the Trump 
administration. Prosecutors noted that recent American actions — including tightened NOFORN restrictions after 
the Discord leaks and British concerns about U.S. legality in Caribbean operations — have eroded confidence, with 
the U.K. suspending some intelligence sharing after Director Patel allegedly broke promises to MI5 regarding 
protection of a bureau operative in London. According to the article, this distrust is compounded by global political 
pressures: Canada's response to Chinese election interference, New Zealand's delicate balance with Beijing, and 
Australia's AUKUS commitments, as well as Pacific-region complications involving China's security pacts and shifting 
maritime cooperation. The article further reported that domestic U.S. dynamics mirror these international 
fractures, as state and local officials increasingly resist federal data-sharing over fears of surveillance or 
immigration enforcement, generating a "NOFORN-like" reluctance that undermines public services and counter-
threat coordination; meanwhile, past successes like the FBI—Australian Federal Police ANOM sting demonstrate 
what strong trust can achieve. The article noted that restoring the alliance requires limiting excessive classification, 
strengthening safeguards on shared intelligence, and rebuilding trust so that democratic allies can continue 
coordinating effectively against authoritarian adversaries who face no such internal constraints.

CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS 
Continued Reporting: Former GOP Staffer Natalie Greene Charged for Paying Artist $500 to Stage Her 
Own Assault and Mislead FBI Agents 
Inquisitr (11/20, Choudhury, Battacharjee) reported that Natalie Greene, a 26-year-old former congressional staffer 
for Republican Rep. Jeff Van Drew, has been charged with conspiracy and making false statements to federal 
investigators. The FBI visited the Pennsylvania studio and obtained documentation, which included a consent form 
with Greene's signature and a copy of her driver's license, and even the photos of the cuts matched with the ones
