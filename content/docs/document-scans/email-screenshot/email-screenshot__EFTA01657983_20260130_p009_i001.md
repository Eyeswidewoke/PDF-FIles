Police Officers In Colorado Mistakenly Detain Black Family. 
ABC World News TonightVi (8/3, story 8, 1:30, Muir, 7.08M) reported on "new allegations 
against the Aurora, Colorado Police Department. Officers now accused of confronting a Black 
family, mistakenly believing they were in a stolen vehicle. Children forced to the ground." ABC's 
Clayton Sandell added, "Tonight, confusion and questions about why police in Aurora, Colorado, 
responding to reports of a stolen vehicle, approached a Black family in their car, handcuffing 
several children on the pavement. Police say a license plate scanner alerted them that Brittany 
Gilliam's car was stolen. ... But the department now says Gilliam's license plate had the same 
number as the real stolen vehicle, but that was a motorcycle from another state." The 
department is "already under fire for several high profile cases." 
"Back The Blue" Mural Painted Outside Tampa Police Headquarters.

the weekend outside the Tampa Police Department's headquarters "is drawing praise and

WPost Calls For Congress To Mandate US Park Police Wear Body Cameras. 
The Washington Post (8/3, 14.2M) editorializes that "given its execrable recent record, you'd 
think the Park Police would be doing everything in its power to regain the public's trust and 
confidence." The Post argues that "body-worn cameras, standard equipment at many major 
police departments across the country, would be a useful first step to signal that the Park Police 
is determined to make itself accountable for its actions. A bill to mandate their use for all 
federal police officers is included in a legislative police package introduced in the House of 
Representatives. Its passage would be a tonic - whether or not the Park Police thinks it is 'in a 
position' to comply."

US Attorney Mulls Appeal Of Tsarnaev Ruling. 
The Boston Herald (8/3, Tiernan, 410K) reports, "The day after President Trump called for a 
'do-over' in seeking the death penalty against convicted Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar 
Tsarnaev, the U.S. attorney said his office is still mulling an appeal." US Attorney Andrew Lelling 
"said his office is continuing to review a federal appellate court's Friday decision to toss out the 
death sentence and would 'have more information in the coming days and weeks: The 
government has two weeks to file a petition for an appeal, but could request an extension." The 
Herald adds, "The ruling ripped open old wounds for the families of the three people who died 
and the more than 260 who were injured in the April 15, 2013, twin bombings on Boylston 
Street at the end of the Boston Marathon route." 
ISIS Attacks Eastern Afghan Prison, Frees Nearly 400 Prisoners. 
The AP (8/3, Gul, Faiez) reports that "militants affiliated with the Islamic State group stormed a 
prison in eastern Afghanistan in a daylong siege that left at least 39 people dead, including the 
assailants, and freed nearly 400 of their fighters before security forces restored order." The AP 
adds "the attack underscored that the Islamic State affiliate in Afghanistan is still a formidable 
presence, and it highlighted the challenges ahead as U.S. and NATO forces begin to withdraw 
following Washington's peace deal with the Taliban." The AP also reports "the peace accord aims 
to recruit the Taliban to battle the militants from IS, which US officials have told The Associated
