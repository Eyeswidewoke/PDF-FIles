Afghanistan To Include Mother's Names On National ID Cards. 
The New York Times (9/2, Mashal, Rahim, 18.61M) reports, "Afghan citizens will soon have their 
mothers' names printed along with their fathers' on their national identification cards, the 
government said on Tuesday, after years of campaigning by activists to do away with the shame 
associated with female names in public." The move is "seen as a small boost for women's rights 
at a time when the future of women's role in Afghan society hangs in the balance amid 
imminent government negotiations over a power-sharing deal with the Taliban." However, 
"while Afghan social media has been full of celebration since Tuesday over the announced 
change, many also feared that its introduction would deter people in conservative rural areas 
from registering for the national identity cards." 
Biegun Warns Putin Against Deploying Troops To Belarus. 
The Washington Examiner (9/2, Gehrke, 448K) reports, "Russian President Vladimir Putin will 
face 'substantial consequences' if he deploys forces into Belarus to help beleaguered autocrat 
Alexander Lukashenko control the mass protests against his rule, a top American diplomat 
warned." Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun said, "There would be substantial 
consequences for the relationship between Russia and the United States, between Russia and 
Europe. The last four years has been very challenging for US-Russian relations, but it is 
possible that it could be worse." 
State Department Imposes New Restrictions On Chinese Diplomats In US. 
Reuters (9/2, Pamuk, Brunnstrom) reports that on Wednesday, the State Department 
announced that the US "would now require senior Chinese diplomats to get State Department 
approval before visiting U.S. university campuses and holding cultural events with more than 50 
people outside mission grounds." According to Reuters, the Trump Administration "cast the 
move as a response to what it said was Beijing's restrictions on American diplomats based in 
China." Reuters adds that it also "comes as part of a Trump administration campaign against 
alleged Chinese influence operations and espionage activity." Secretary of State Pompeo is 
quoted as saying, "We're simply demanding reciprocity. Access for our diplomats in China 
should be reflective of the access that Chinese diplomats in the United States have, and today's 
steps will move us substantially in that direction." 
Politico (9/2, Oprysko, 4.29M) says Pompeo told reporters at the State Department that 
China utilizes "a system of opaque approval processes designed to prevent American diplomats 
from conducting regular business, attending events, securing meetings and connecting with the 
Chinese people." The AP (9/2, Lee) reports that Pompeo also indicated that the State 
Department "would act to ensure that the social media accounts of Chinese officials be 
identified as belonging to the People's Republic of China and the Chinese Communist Party." 
Pompeo said on Fox News' Hannity (9/2, 535K) that "we took the simple action of telling 
Chinese diplomats working here in the United States that the free ride is over, their ability to 
conduct espionage here in the United States has, the time has passed, and so we've put 
restrictions on them. ... These are the kinds of restrictions they've had on us, our diplomats in 
China, and now we've got a reciprocal arrangement." He said, "For 40 years...the United States 
took a knee, it bent a knee to the Chinese Communist Party and President Trump has said 
enough, whether it's on trade, or on their stealing of intellectual property and trade secrets, 
destroying jobs here in the United States. We're simply not going to take it anymore." 
Chinese FM Pressed On A Host Of Issues While Touring Europe. The Washington
Post (9/2, Shih, 14.2M) says that on Tuesday, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi "headed 
home...from a five-stop European tour that had been designed to mend fences with European 
governments - or at least wage a charm offensive" after Pompeo called for a "Cold War-style 
alliance of Western democracies to counter China." However, according to the Post, "the 
reception in Europe was decidedly chilly." The Post reports that in Rome, Wang "was pressed on 
the question of autonomy and freedoms in Hong Kong," in Paris, he was "asked about Beijing's
