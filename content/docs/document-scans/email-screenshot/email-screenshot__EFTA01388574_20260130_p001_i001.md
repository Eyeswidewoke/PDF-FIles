These are early signs that CIE euphoria has come at a cost. It may have assisted 
generating high returns in financial markets in recent years, but investors should 
expect leaner times ahead. 
In the meantime, there are likely to be dramatic swings - in both directions. Over 
the medium term, it appears likely that confidence in the ability of central banks 
to stabilize financial markets will continue to erode. Just because this is likely to 
happen eventually, however, does not mean we are quite there yet. Central banks 
still have options —and willingness too, it would seem, to creatively use any readily 
available tool remaining. 
However, betting on their magic touch is getting riskier. Look at how last December, 
the ECB caught investors on the wrong foot. Markets had grown used to its 
President Mario Draghi over-delivering. Instead the ECB underwhelmed in the short 
term. It only tinkered on the edges of its existing QE program, focusing instead on 
cutting (its already negative) deposit rate further in the wake of similar decisions 
in several smaller European economies. Sweden, Denmark and Switzerland have 
increasingly relied on negative interest rates to discourage capital inflows (see box). 
Beyond the zero bound 
Negative interest-rate policies (NIRP) have always been controversial in the 
academic community, and even less systematic research has been done on their 
effectiveness than with respect to DE. We believe, their growing use raises at 
least three issues: 
1. What's the point of negative nominal interest rates? 
The answer to this question should be clear from section 2. If they can be 
implemented without too many detrimental side-effects, NIRP offer a neat way 
out of the liquidity trap. Monetary policy regains its power to push real interest 
rates lower, even in a low-inflation environment. 
Old correlations aro breaking down 
Until recently, investors could imunt on 
returns from equities to bo negauvishr 
correlated with returns on government bonds 
for most of the lime As the chart comparing 
the German Dax and t0-year Bunds 
illustrates, this relationship was not stable, 
hut the tendency was clear. In recent montha. 
by contract correlations have turned positive.
This meant that adding government bonds to 
an equity portfolio has become a much less 
of fectnaa tool to reduce the overall risk profile.
