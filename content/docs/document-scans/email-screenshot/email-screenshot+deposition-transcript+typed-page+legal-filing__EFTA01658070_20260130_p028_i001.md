Birx: "So, it's calling on all Tennesseans to make that sacrifice for your family, for your children 
- so they can go back to school to really wear a mask and protect each other." 
Miguel Almaguer of NBC Nightly NewsVi (7/27, story 2, 2:25, Holt, 6.32M) reported that 
Birx made a "public plea" for rural mayors to mandate masks, and WSMV-TVVI Nashville, TN 
(7/27, 422K) reported that Birx "had an urgent message to mayors who haven't imposed a 
mask mandate, particularly rural mayors who have not imposed a mask mandate." Birx: "If 
every rural mayor could mandate mask-wearing. The virus is there. You may not see it today 
because it may still be in young people, but it's spreading and it will hit your nursing homes and 
it will hit those that have serious consequences to this virus." 
WZTV-TVVi Nashville, TN (7/27, 28K) reported that Birx "emphasiz[ed] social distancing, 
closing bars and wearing masks" but "she stop[ped) short of supporting a state-wide mandate." 
Birx: "We are asking everybody to make a personal sacrifice of responsibility to one another, to 
really decrease these caseloads by doing these recommendations." WTVF-TVVI Nashville, TN 
(7/27, 7.33M) reported that Birx "was asked multiple times if she recommended the state 
implement a mask mandate, and she wouldn't say yes or no. She did stress that that wearing 
masks and closing bars are some of the most effective ways of flattening the curve." WTVF 
added that Birx said Tennessee "is at the inflection point" and "she urges every mayor to 
mandate masks, to which once again she was asked, why shouldn't the state issue a mandate 
across the board." Birx: "I think in this case, we know that the rural mayors understand their 
communities the best and would know how to mandate masks specifically. We've talked to the 
governor about the importance of mask mandates. I think he has a sound strategy that he's 
working through the state." 
The Tennessean (7/27, Kelman, 458K) reports that while Birx said the state should close 
bars and limit indoor dining, moments later, Gov. Bill Lee (R) "said he had no plans to follow 
this recommendation. Lee said he would not close bars or limit restaurants or give county 
mayors the authority to take these actions locally." Lee said, "I've said from the very beginning 
of this pandemic that there's nothing off the table. I've also said that we are not going to close 
the economy back down, and we are not going to. But I appreciate their recommendations and 
we take them seriously." 
Azar Credits Mask-Wearing For "Plateauing" Of COVID Cases In Key States. 
HHS Secretary Azar said on Fox News' Fox & Friends (7/27, 831K) that while White House 
coronavirus task force coordinator Deborah Birx "says we are seeing signs of plateauing, we are 
not out of the woods yet. It is really important that people remain vigilant. We think it's due to 
the fact that people are actually wearing their masks. ... They are social distancing. They are 
engaging in good personal hygiene. The governors have closed some of these bars where you 
just can't keep socially distant, and you are not going to wear a face covering." Azar added, "I 
really hope people will remain vigilant and we go through this because we need to make it 
through the next several months because we have so much promise there in terms of just 
really credible shots at therapeutics, the next generation of therapeutics, as well as vaccines."
