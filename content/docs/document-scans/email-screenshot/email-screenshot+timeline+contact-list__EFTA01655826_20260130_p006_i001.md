Uvalde Police Chief Who Was on Vacation During Robb Elementary Shooting Resigns 
The Associated Press (3/13, Coronado) and the Washington Post (3/12, Kaur) reported that the Uvalde police chief 
who was on vacation during the Robb Elementary School shooting submitted his resignation Tuesday, less than a 
week after a report ordered by the city defended the police department's response to the attack but outraged 
some family members of those who were killed. The articles stated that before an Uvalde City Council meeting, 
Uvalde Police Chief Daniel Rodriguez submitted his resignation letter, and then did not attend the meeting. The 
articles noted that the US DOJ had carried a report submitted last January that laid out critical failures of the 
Uvalde Police Department during the shooting. The New York Times (3/12, Sandoval) added that the chief's 
resignation would be effective on April 6, and in the meantime an assistant chief of police, Homer Delgado, would 
serve as the interim police chief while a search for a replacement is conducted. This story was also reported on by 
NBC News (3/12, Burke, Helsel), Reuters (3/12, Brooks), CBS News (3/12, Falcon), Axios (3/12, Habeshian), The

separate incidents for violent threats against election officials in Arizona, demonstrating federal efforts to combat 
this trend of harassment against public servants.

An opinion piece from the Jerusalem Post (03/12, Fard) reported that the FBI is engaged in a silent battle against 
Iranian sleeper cells within the United States, focusing on the threat these cells pose to national security. According
