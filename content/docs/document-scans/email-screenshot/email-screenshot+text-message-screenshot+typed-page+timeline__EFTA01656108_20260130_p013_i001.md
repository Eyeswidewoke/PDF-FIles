The Hill (11/20, Lee) reported that former Oath Keeper Brian Ulrich was sentenced to three years of probation, six 
months of home detention, and 120 hours of community service for his role in the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, after pleading 
guilty to seditious conspiracy and cooperating with federal prosecutors. According to the article, Ulrich provided 
significant assistance in the prosecution of other Oath Keepers, including testifying against members of the group 
accused of plotting to use violence to stop the certification of the 2020 presidential election. The article noted that 
prosecutors highlighted the Oath Keepers' planning, including encrypted communications and the stashing of 
weapons in Virginia, while U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta commended Ulrich's efforts to help the nation "heal and 
move forward." Atlanta Journal-Constitution (11/20, Joyner) also reported on the story. 
Jan. 6 Defendants With Florida Ties Await Possible Pardons From Trump 
The Lakeland Ledger (11/20, White) reported that President-elect Donald Trump's campaign promise to pardon Jan. 
6 defendants has sparked legal and political discussions, particularly for several Polk County residents charged with 
crimes related to the Capitol riot, including assaulting police officers. According to the article, Trump referred to 
Jan. 6 defendants as "patriots" and vowed to pardon them on "day one" of his presidency, though legal motions 
citing this promise, including one by defendant Thomas Osborne, have been denied by federal judges like Amit 
Mehta, who emphasized the public's interest in adjudicating these cases promptly. The article noted that the FBI 
has continued its efforts to track down and arrest Capitol riot participants, including Jonathan and Olivia Pollock, 
who were captured after fleeing for years, and detailed the broader implications of mass pardons, which experts 
suggest could undermine public confidence in the legal system while reinforcing Trump's political agenda.

violent actions in the "Tunnel" on the Capitol's Lower West Terrace, where she pushed against police and took a 
riot shield from an officer to assist other rioters. The article noted that the Tunnel was the site of some of the most 
violent attacks on law enforcement during the riot, with Tryon-Castro spending 35 minutes there actively engaging 
in confrontational behavior.

Philadelphia Loses Lawsuit That Sought Greater Power for the City to Regulate Firearms 
The Associated Press (11/20, Scolforo, Levy) reported that Philadelphia cannot impose stricter firearms regulations 
than are allowed by state law, Pennsylvania's Democratic-majority state Supreme Court ruled unanimously 
Wednesday, a blow to city leaders looking for ways to stem gun violence. The justices ruled 6-0 to uphold a lower 
court's dismissal of a lawsuit filed by the city, the nonprofit group CeaseFirePA and family members of gun violence 
victims. According to the article, they had sought to throw out a state law that has long prohibited municipalities 
from regulating the ownership or possession of guns or ammunition. Under it, courts in Pennsylvania have thrown 
out decades of local firearms measures, including a 1990s-era assault weapons ban in Pittsburgh. Justice Kevin 
Brobson's majority opinion acknowledged the tragedy of gun violence and that "a serious problem exists." But, he 
wrote, the court's role was not to decide whether laws passed by the Legislature are adequate to address the 
challenge. The article mentioned that researchers say gun violence is down in most big cities this year. The Center 
for American Progress said earlier this year that Philadelphia had seen the most significant decline in gun violence 
in 2024 of the 50 most populous U.S. cities. The FBI reported violent crime in the U.S. had dropped in 2023 by 
about 3% from the year before, including a drop of 12% in murders and non-negligent manslaughter. That was in 
line with findings by the nonpartisan Council on Criminal Justice, which reported 13% fewer homicides across 29 
cities during the first half of 2024 from the year before.
