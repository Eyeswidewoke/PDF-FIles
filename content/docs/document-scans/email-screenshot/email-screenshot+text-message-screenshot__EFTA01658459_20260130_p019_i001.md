allowing their children to use TikTok could put them at the mercy of Chinese spies." Nigel 
Inkster "said that the controversial social media app could provide a backdoor for Beijing to 
steal secrets from high-ranking members of the Government." Inkster "said that as long as its 
owners were based there, it would be seen as a risk." He told the Telegraph separately, "Where 
the Chinese intelligence services are very strong is in identifying non-obvious entry points to 
certain targets. They have shown a lot of skill in this regard." 
Senators Seek To Include National Cyber Director In 2021 NDAA. 
The Wall Street Journal (8/10, Uberti, Rundle, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) reports 
Congressional lawmakers say that stand-alone legislation to create a national cyberdirector will 
be difficult to pass as Congress is deadlocked on coronavirus relief aid. Instead, Sen. Angus 
King (I-ME) and other supporters are seeking to include the position in the National Defense 
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 currently being crafted in Congress. The current proposal 
would provide for as many as 75 staffers in the new office, but the White House believes such 
an office may conflict with existing cyber capabilities. 
US Cyber Command Employing Unclassified Networks "To Fight Election 
Interference." 
C4ISR & Networks (8/10, Pomerleau) reports US Cyber Command is using "unclassified 
networks and publicly available communication platforms as it works to prevent foreign 
interference in the next presidential election, a CYBERCOM official has revealed." During an 
August 7 DEFCON panel, US Cyber Command Cyber National Mission Force head Brig. Gen. 
William Hartman said, "From a CYBERCOM standpoint, one of the big changes for us is we 
historically had been focused working inside [sensitive compartmented information facilities] 
SCIFs. One of the things we've done in support of 2020 is we have organizations now that live 
outside SCIFs." Hartman "said forces are now working on unclassified networks, Slack channels 
and other platforms to communicate with the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security and 
private industry." 
FBI Among Those Monitoring Iranian "Fox Kitten" Hacking Group. 
National Interest (8/10, Suciu, 81K) reports sources "reportedly told ZDNet on Monday" that a 
group known as "Fox Kitten" has been "tracked by the cybersecurity community under the 
codenames Fox Kitten and Parisite, and that its primary task is providing an `initial beachhead' 
for other Iranian hacking groups, such as APT33 (Shamoon), Oilrig (APT34) or Chafer." The FBI 
issued the alert "last week and warned companies that Fox Kitten has upgraded its attack 
arsenal to include an exploit for CVE-2020-5902, a vulnerability disclosed in July that could 
impact BIG-IP, which is a popular multi-purpose networking device manufactured by F5 
Networks." The technology is "widely used in data centers and cloud environments." The FBI 
has instructed companies "to patch their on-premise BIG-IP devices as a preventative measure 
against such cyberattacks." While the FBI warning didn't "indicate whether any companies have 
been breached in a recent cyberattack, sources told ZDNet that Fox Kitten has been successful 
in cyberattacks against BIG-IP devices in at least two companies this year."
