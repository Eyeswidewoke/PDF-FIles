program in untrained young =emales did not show a change in weight and authors reported a small but =ignificant 
increase of fat free mass[321. On =he whole, further research combining the analysis of the changes of fat =ree mass and 
lean mass is needed to elucidate this controversy and the =echanisms of weight change. 
Limitations 
The main limitations of the current study are the sample =ize, the characteristics of the sample and the type of 
device employed. =he size of sample could limit the chance of finding a significant =ffect on the BMD of the lumbar 
spine, but the mean of change (-0.01 =r/cm2) and the mean effect compared to walking group (0%) =acked of clinical 
relevance. In addition, this lack of effect is =onsistent with previous studies115]. =hanger of BMD at the trochanter and 
Ward's triangle were close to reach =tatistical significance, possibly due to the small sample size because =he statistical 
power was 30%. In addition, the observed mean effect =3-5%) was greater than the reliability of the measurements 
=1.2%). Therefore, we could consider that the WBV was more effective to =revent the bone mass density loss at hip area 
(femoral neck, Ward's Triangle and trochanter) than the walking programme. 
The generalisation of results =as to be largely confined to healthy postmenopausal women, because we 
=ecruited this type of population to reduce the influence of some =otentially contaminant variables (hormone 
replacement therapy, =etabolic disorders, malnutrition etc.)1211. =ubin et al. 125] and =orvinen et al. 131 =peculated that 
a population with osteopenia or osteoporosis could =btain greater increases of BMD due to low baseline scores. In this 
=ense, the Walking group showed a trend of lowers BMI, BMD and balance =t baseline because the randomisation 
procedure applied to sample was =ot blocked by means of these variables. The imbalance of BMD could =ifficult to find 
more positive effects of the WBV group compared to the =alking group, but the imbalance of BMI could benefit to find 
=omparative ameliorations in WBV. 
On the other hand, the results obtained has to be =estricted to devices designed to produce reciprocating 
vertical =isplacements on the left and right side of a fulcrum, which increases =he lateral accelerations. Nevertheless, 
this type of device is one of =he most frequently chosen for clinical use and for sport training. In =ddition, because the 
vertical strain was lower than the lateral strain, =he effects of vibratory training on the lumbar spine could require a 
=onger period of training or extra loading (e.g. a back-pack with =eights, a higher amplitude of vibration or less knee 
flexion to reduce =he attenuation of vibration throughout the body). 
Implications and future research 
Professionals could expect =reater reductions of bone fracture risk by prescribing WBV exercise =ather than a 
walking program alone. Therefore, a vibration loading with =ow amplitude (3 mm) and medium intensity (12.6 Hz), could 
be used to =revent age-related bone loss at the hip, specially in frail =opulations. However, knowledge of the optimal 
dosage of vibratory =xercise requires further research. In addition, the effects of =ifferent doses of vibratory exercise 
and the effects of a mixed =ibratory and walking exercise are unknown.

Conclusion 
The 8-month vibratory =xercise is feasible and more effective than walking to improve two =ajor determinants 
of bone fractures: hip BMD and =alance.
