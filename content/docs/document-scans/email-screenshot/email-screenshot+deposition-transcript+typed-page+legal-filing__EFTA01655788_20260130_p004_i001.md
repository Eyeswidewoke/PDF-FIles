The Hill (02/29, Schonfeld) reported that the Supreme Court's decision to consider former President Trump's claims 
of criminal immunity has thrown the timing of his federal Jan. 6 trial into uncertainty, potentially delaying it until 
summer or later, which may clash with the final stages of the upcoming general election. According to the article, 
Special Counsel Jack Smith, who has charged Trump with four felonies related to attempts to subvert the 2020 
election results, had sought a swift trial. The article explained that Trump, pleading not guilty, leveraged his 
immunity claims to postpone the trial initially set for March 4. The Supreme Court's intervention, described as 
finding a middle ground, has thus extended the delay, with arguments scheduled for the week of April 22. The 
article noted that critics and legal experts expressed concerns that the delay plays into Trump's hands, potentially 
affecting the trial's occurrence before the election. Additional reporting on the story was provided by the

FBI Raids TWo Homes Owned by Top Aide to New York City Mayor Eric Adams 
The Associated Press (02/29, Offenhartz, Neumeister) reported that federal agents conducted raids on two homes 
owned by Winnie Greco, a top adviser and the director of Asian affairs for New York City Mayor Eric Adams, in the 
Bronx. According to the article, an FBI spokesperson confirmed the operation, which is part of an investigation 
overseen by the U.S. attorney's office in Brooklyn, distinct from another inquiry involving Adams himself. The 
reasons behind the raids were not disclosed, adding another layer to the scrutiny surrounding Adams and his 
associates. The article explained that Greco, who has been a key figure in connecting Adams with the city's Asian-
American communities and faced previous probes regarding her fundraising activities, was placed on 
administrative leave following the raids. The article noted that this event marks at least the third instance of federal 
agents targeting aides close to Mayor Adams, with the investigations hinting at broader inquiries into the 
administration's conduct and fundraising practices. Additional reporting on the story was provided by The Hill

Trump Seeks to Move Florida Trial to 2025, While Prosecutors Push for July 
The Washington Post (02/29, Stein, Barrett) reported that federal prosecutors have proposed delaying Donald 
Trump's classified documents trial in Florida to July 8, pending the Supreme Court's decision on his presidential 
immunity claim, while Trump's legal team is pushing for a postponement until after the 2024 presidential election. 
According to the article, U.S. District Judge Aileen M. Cannon is expected to delay the trial's start from its initial late 
May date due to complex evidentiary issues and Trump's ongoing immunity appeal. The article explained that the 
Supreme Court's forthcoming April hearing on Trump's immunity could further delay his D.C. federal trial for 
allegedly attempting to block President Biden's 2020 election victory. The article noted that Trump faces multiple 
criminal trials, including state charges in New York and Georgia, and has pleaded not guilty in all cases. The article 
also explained that the Florida case involves dozens of counts of mishandling classified information post-
presidency, with recent court proceedings largely held behind closed doors to navigate the legal complexities of 
trials involving restricted government information. Additional reporting on the story was provided by Associated
