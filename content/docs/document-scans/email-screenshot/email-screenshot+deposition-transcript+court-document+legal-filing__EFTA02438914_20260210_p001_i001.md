I was just looking at all the other writing this fellow Andrew Critchlow puts out including his 
Twitter; it's incredible. He not only doesn't get it he seems to hate the Arab world!

Dubai Inc. Needs Change at the Top• By ANDREW cltrictiLow Faced with a continuing financial crisis of savage 
proportions, Dubai risks retreating into its past rather than facing up to its new reality. The Gulf emirate needs to 
radically overhaul its state-controlled companies if it is to overcome its $80 billion mountain of debt. Yet rather than 
seize the opportunity to introduce international standards of governance and transparency, the people whose poor 
judgment led Dubai to the brink have kept their jobs. For western lenders with billions of dollars still at stake, that is 
troubling.Take Dubai World, the conglomerate that has just been radically restructured after running up almost $60 
billion of liabilities on an ill-judged acquisition spree. Its deals included buying struggling Madison Avenue retailer 
Bameys for $800 million, investing in an $8.8 billion Las Vegas casino development and paying $100 million for the 
Queen Elizabeth 11 liner, which has since spent most of its time languishing in a Dubai dry dock.Dubai World has 
now cut its work force by 15% in an effort to save $800 million over the next three years. Surprisingly, its senior 
managers remain in place, including Sultan bin Sulayem, the chairman who masterminded the expansion. That has 
disappointed bankers who fear that, unless senior managers are held more accountable, the mistakes of the past will be 
repeated.But holding senior Emirati officials like Mr. Sulayem responsible for their decisions will be tricky. The 
Sulayem family's ties to Dubai's ruling Maktourns run deep. Mr. Sulayem's father was a key adviser to the family. The 
same is true of many other of the emirate's business leaders whose reputations have been damaged by the 
crisis.Westem lenders would rather sec experienced and suitably qualified executives running Dubai's companies with 
proper accountability to an independent board and creditors. Yet Dubai's ruler, Sheik Mohammed bin Rashid Al 
Maktoum, appears to be heading in the opposite direction, possibly handing more power to his sons after being let 
down by some of his key lieutenants. This could mean a bigger role in Dubai's corporate affairs for the popular but 
inexperienced 26-year-old Crown Prince Hamdan.Long term, this looks unsustainable. The scale of Dubars financial 
woes means painful changes can't be resisted for long. if the easy credit of the past decade allowed officials like Mr. 
Sulayem to build Dubai World into a truly international company, the next 10 years will see banks demanding greater 
transparency in return for capital.Write to Andrew Critchlow at
