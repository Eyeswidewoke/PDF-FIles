administration. The FBI obtained the email and set up an undercover operation, posing as representatives of the foreign country, and received 
classified material from Laatsch at a pre-arranged location in northern Virginia, leading to his arrest on Thursday. According to court documents, 
Laatsch expressed his dissatisfaction with the current administration and stated that he intended to act in support of the values that the United 
States once stood for, and he was also seeking citizenship in a foreign country due to conditions in the U.S. The FBI Washington Field Office is 
investigating the case, and Laatsch is scheduled to make an initial court appearance in Alexandria, Virginia. "This case underscores the persistent 
risk of insider threats: Director Patel wrote on X. The FBI remains steadfast in protecting our national security and thanks our law enforcement 
partners for their critical support" Additional reporting on the story was provided by AlxNow (05/29, Belmore), Associated Press (05/29, Staff

Passenger Accused of Dragging American Airlines Flight Attendant 
CBS News (05/29, Breen) reported that a Kansas man who allegedly dragged an American Airlines flight attendant up the aisle of a plane is facing 
charges, the DOJ said on Wednesday. Julius Jordan Priester, 24, was traveling from Bradley International Airport in Windsor Locks, Connecticut, to 
Chicago on Tuesday night, the DOJ said. American Airlines said in a statement that the plane was bound for O'Hare International Airport. 
According to the article, the flight took off around 9:30 p.m. Less than an hour into the flight, Priester allegedly stood up, began to take off his 
shirt, and ran to the back of the plane yelling "Help me," federal prosecutors said. Priester then allegedly grabbed a seated flight attendant and 
shouted "You're coming with me," the DOJ said. Priester allegedly pulled the flight attendant to the ground, then attempted to drag the attendant 
up the aisle. Other staff and passengers intervened in the incident, the DOJ and American Airlines said. Priester was returned to his seat, but 
continued to "act erratically and make incoherent statements: The pilot declared an emergency, and the flight was diverted back to Bradley 
International Airport. The article noted that once the plane landed, the Connecticut State Police removed Priester. He was taken to a local hospital 
for evaluation, the DOJ said. The FBI and the Connecticut State Police are investigating.
