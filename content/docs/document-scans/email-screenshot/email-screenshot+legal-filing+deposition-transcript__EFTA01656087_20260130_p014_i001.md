FBI Launches Awareness Campaign After Sharp Increase in Various Scams 
KVOA (NBC-4) (09/18, Nylander) reported that the FBI is trying to raise awareness of various schemes as it sees a 
sharp increase in victims. The FBI has just launched a new attempt at trying to save people's money. It's called 
"Take a Beat." As in, pause and think before ever sending that random person or robot over the phone your money. 
The article quoted Agent Paul Sparke of FBI Tucson, who said, "They end up scamming them out of thousands 
sometimes tens of thousands of dollars. Especially here in Tucson and up in Phoenix, we have a high percentage of 
retirees, people who are living on fixed incomes so we really see the harsh impact and the reality." According to the 
article, to try and turn things around, the FBI has launched its "Take a Beat" initiative to raise awareness about the 
many scams out there from the classic romance scams and fishy phone calls, to more elaborate cryptocurrency 
schemes. 
How an Overlooked County Landed the New FBI Headquarters and Tech Jobs 
The Christian Science Monitor (09/18, Hills) reported that the change in Prince George's County, Maryland, is 
obvious to people who've long lived and worked in this community bordering Washington, D.C., and the Potomac 
River. The county has nearly completely recovered from the considerable job losses caused by the pandemic and 
rebounded from the Great Recession, when it had the highest foreclosure rate in the state. The article added 
that Prince George's, with a population of almost 1 million people, is also America's second-wealthiest majority-
Black county —just recently surpassed by neighboring Charles County — but businesses and people here struggled 
during the pandemic, like the rest of the country. The article stated that signals of the county's revitalization range 
from splashy announcements, like the FBI last year picking Prince George's as the site of its headquarters, to 
ambitious infrastructure projects, like plans for 10 additional Metro subway stations. Between 2011 and 2021, the 
county led the state in job growth. The article mentioned that Maryland officials also raised equity 
arguments during and after their bid to woo the FBI headquarters across the border from Washington. A 2023 
report from Urban Institute found that investment has not been evenly distributed across the Washington region. 
In particular, average investment per household in Prince George's County is significantly lower than in other area 
counties. 
Congress Attempts to Dodge a Government Shutdown as Funding Push Fails to the House Over 
Controversial Voting Bill 
USA TODAY (09/18, Beggin) reported that with just 12 days to go until a potential government shutdown, the 
House attempted — and failed — to pass a 6-month funding extension that was tied to a contentious piece of voting 
legislation on Wednesday. The article added that the chamber voted 220-202 to defeat the measure, which would 
fund the government at existing levels through the end of March 2025 and advance a bill that would require people 
to show proof of citizenship in order to vote. The effort has been a pet project of House Speaker Mike Johnson, (R-
LA), and former President Donald Trump. However, the legislation has received widespread criticism from 
Democrats, as non-citizens already can't vote in federal elections. Critics also argued it could make voting harder 
for millions of Americans who don't have easy access to their citizenship documents. The article stated that during 
a government shutdown, federal agencies that are classified as "nonessential" are sent home and paid once the 
government reopens. "Essential" workers — those necessary to keep the most crucial elements of the federal 
government functioning — would keep working and receive their pay. The U.S. military and federal law enforcement 
agencies including the FBI, DEA, and prison staff, as well as the Secret Service, Coast Guard and border security 
agents would also keep working. 
Los Angeles Sheriff's Department Announces Long-Awaited Policy Banning Deputy Gangs 
The Los Angeles Times (09/18, Blakinger) reported that nearly two years after Sheriff Robert Luna took office and 
promised to eradicate deputy gangs, and three years after state lawmakers greenlit a measure requiring police 
agencies to ban the groups, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department unveiled a much-awaited anti-gang policy 
Wednesday to comply with the law. According to the article, the controversial tattooed groups and their alleged 
misconduct have plagued the nation's largest Sheriff's Department for decades, spurring oversight investigations, 
an FBI probe and a stream of lawsuits. But leaders have been hamstrung in their efforts to eradicate the inked 
groups, in part because being in a gang was never explicitly grounds for firing. The article noted that when it takes 
effect in 30 days, officials say the policy will ban being in a deputy gang or hate group and require department 
employees to participate in investigations into the groups. It also will require that allegations of gang membership 
be referred to the state commission responsible for certifying — or revoking the certification of — peace officers 
across California. Violating the policy can result in discipline, including termination.
