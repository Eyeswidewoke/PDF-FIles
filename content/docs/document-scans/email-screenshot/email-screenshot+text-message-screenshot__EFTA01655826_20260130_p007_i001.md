Benz convertible in exchange for attempting to disrupt criminal cases and misuse his Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee position. According to the article, this follows a 2017 trial where jurors were uncertain if the gifts and 
favors he received were illegal or typical of friendship. The Supreme Court's 2016 decision, which narrowed the 
definition of corruption by requiring a specific quid pro quo for conviction, has made prosecuting such cases 
challenging. However, recent retrials and a focus on explicit quid pro quo have led to convictions, signaling a 
potential shift in how these cases might be approached, including Menendez's, which relies on new charges.

CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS 
Ghislaine Maxwell's Lawyer Tell Appeals Judges That Jeffrey Epstein's Florida Plea Deal Protects Her 
The Associated Press (03/12, Neumeister) reported that imprisoned British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell's lawyer 
asked a federal appeals court Tuesday to toss out her sex trafficking conviction and 20-year prison sentence, saying 
Jeffrey Epstein's 2007 non-prosecution deal with a U.S. attorney in Florida should have prevented her prosecution. 
The article added that attorney Diana Fabi Samson's argument was repeatedly challenged by one judge on the 2nd 
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals before the three-judge panel reserved decision. Lawyers for Maxwell are challenging 
her December 2021 conviction on multiple grounds, but the only topic at oral arguments was whether the deal 
Epstein struck in Florida to prevent a federal case against him there also protected Maxwell in New York. Samson 
said it did. A prosecutor said it didn't. Maxwell, 62, is serving her sentence at a low-security federal prison in 
Tallahassee, Florida, where yoga, Pilates, and movies are available. According to the article, Epstein's lawyers made 
a similar argument about the force of his non-prosecution deal in Florida after his July 2019, sex trafficking arrest in 
Manhattan. But the legal question became moot in his case after he took his own life a month later in a federal 
lockup as he awaited trial. ABC News (03/12, Katersky, Hill), BBC (03/12, Wendling), Business Insider (03/12, 
Shamsian), Independent (03/12, Bedigan), Fox News (03/12, Ruiz), Washington Examiner (03/12, Deese), Reuters 
(03/12, Stempel), New York Post (03/12, Kochman), and the Daily Beast (03/12, Briquelet) also reported on the 
story. 
Republicans Subpoenaed 15 Years of Hunter Biden Phone Records, Democrats Reveal 
The Hill (03/12, Beitsch) reported that House Republicans have subpoenaed AT&T for 15 years of Hunter Biden's 
phone records, Democrats revealed on Tuesday, the latest sign that GOP lawmakers are plowing ahead with their 
impeachment inquiry into President Biden despite his son testifying that his father was not involved in his business 
ventures. The article added that the subpoena — issued last week but first disclosed in a Democratic memo — asks 
AT&T to provide information "regarding the account information, communication records, and payment history of 
all AT&T accounts affiliated with Robert Hunter Biden," as part of the GOP impeachment inquiry into the president. 
The article mentioned that House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer (R-KY) said the records are "probative" 
of whether Joe Biden communicated with Hunter Biden's business associates if Hunter Biden was communicating 
with his father during important parts of his business dealings, and if the president's son was speaking with other 
Executive Branch officials. The article noted that the move by Comer comes after the FBI arrested a former 
informant on charges related to lying to the agency about the president accepting a bribe — undercutting a key 
element of the GOP's probe. But the memo from House Democrats criticizes Republicans for failing to disclose the 
recent subpoena as it has with other demands of the president's family. The Huffington Post (03/12, Delaney), and 
the Daily Mail (03/12, Phillips) also reported on the story. 
Ex-Mar-a-Lago Employee Says He Unwittingly Helped Load Trump Classified Papers Onto Plane 
The Independent (03/12, Baio) reported that Brian Butler, a former Mar-a-Lago employee who has publicly 
identified himself as a witness in the classified documents case against Donald Trump, recounted how he 
unknowingly helped load boxes of those documents onto the former president's plane on CNN's The Source with 
Kaitlin Collins. The article added that Butler, a valet and manager at Mar-a-Lago, said that in June 2022 he and Walt 
Nauta, another former employee who is also a co-defendant in the case, loaded approximately 10 to 15 white 
banker's boxes from a car to Trump's plane. The article stated that Butler said he had "no clue" the boxes contained 
potential national security secrets at the time. He recalled that he often helped load the Trump family's luggage or 
the former president's things from cars to the plane. It wasn't until later that Butler realized those boxes, the same 
ones that appeared in the government's indictment, contained classified information. The article noted that Butler, 
who revealed himself to be "Trump Employee 5" in the government's case against the former president, said he is
