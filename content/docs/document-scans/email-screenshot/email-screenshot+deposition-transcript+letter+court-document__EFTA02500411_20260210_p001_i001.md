Re: 
this is what lye sent chomsky today, we =ave been going at language and money for hours every day, 
Al= Biology is composed of redundant and degenerative systems. fractalized to a degree.i.e. single cell , multi cell. 
organisms etc. The =ingle cell subordinating its description in the description of the whole. Both you and I agree that all 
mathematical models fall far short of getting to the essence of life- most have tried. I propose that your UG , I- language, 
is just one of many " cells " in the =ystem. There is likely a VG for vision.( the input part can be ignored) and and a 
CG=20 for cognition.( shared in some similar form by other animals ). Nothi=g really meaningful to date has been said 
about how any one of these=20 "cells" ,nor in fact any living system, accomplishes what i= does. UG=/span> included . 
While the UG is found only in humans Are =he structures of UG- VG- CG homologous? probably ,- more likely than 
not - as they =ould have evolved all being embedded in the same local e=vironment. In keeping with biology's 
redundancy they may have also =ried many combinations in attempting to form into a UVC-G organism . ( turtles all 
the way down). CG, VG and=C2 UG are parts of a living system. All their well kept secrets of operation - still=20 safe. 
Im afraid your cries against subsidies ,is akin the blind man feeling the tail of th= elephant.. I will set aside my caustic 
jewish side and present it in suffi terms . 
"The sensual eye is just like the palm of=the hand. The palm has not the means of covering the whole of the 
beast.&q=ot; sweet ? <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_men_and_an_elepha=t#cite_note-Rumi-10> 
The difficulty is the essence of money. what is it? It i= nothing more than an accounting means. this is constantly 
overlooked . =x, we " loan " Israel " three billion dollars a year " . with=that loan they must use it to buy U.S. military 
equipme=t. or Boe=ngs. we record the transaction as a sale of us goods to a foreign country , alongside every other 
export.. increasing and puffing up our =alance of trade numbers . all a fiction. we print the mo=ey, loan it out and 
account for it as income. - at the same time we pro=ibit direct subsidies of Airbus by the EU. as a violation of the 
agr=ements of fair trade. 
2ex . we pay lmillion soldier salaries. out=of the defense budget . a standing army that plays war games for most of the 
past 50 years.trains for battles that are never actualized . we could not do it as a welfare=20 payment, but the 
accounting would make it virtually impossi
