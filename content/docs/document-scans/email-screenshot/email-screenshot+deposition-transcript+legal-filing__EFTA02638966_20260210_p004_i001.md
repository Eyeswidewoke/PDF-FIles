I am sorry. I realize you are under tremendous stress, In Bedfor= you asked me for my help I could not have been 
more clear that thou=ht it very unwise as in my words I did not want any financial arrangm=nt between us, it risked 
conflict and tension what neither of us n=eded more of. and did not want to risk torturing our friendship into the likes 
of the kind you have with Mark nor Josh, : now,4=A0 I dont have anyone but you yelling at me, in my own house. no 
one. it is highly unpleasant but I am trying my best to be understanding . sorry = From the outset and as you told me 
you recall. i tsuggested t=at three years should be the period of engagment. as planning is not a o=e year excericse . 
you declined to commit to a number of alternatives presented to you for payment of the third year. I told yo= in nov 
that you should decide whether to now sign on for that very third year as the vast majority of my work ended on oct 15. 
you recently t=ld me you thought i was kidding. .you hired brad patting him on the back=20 that after months of 
inquiry he can now, finallly tell you which Ilc=20 owns the cars?? 
once he has all the facts what next ??. whether or not you refer to a portion of the third y=ar as after care, or 
whatever term besides 'scoundrel you choose to use,Q=A0 I m not sure why you assume now it should be free.( I HATE 
THIS CONVERSATION=20 < HATE , ) and i heard you when you said you told me what wasi>=A0 I work still to be done 
you thought valuable enough to pay for. please=20 tell me . and then we can decide the next steps „, if any. I consider 
my work rarefied art. I guess the value is in the eye of the beholder=. IT reminds me of those people looking at a 
modern art piece and saying40=A0 " my child could do that " . hope you are feeling be=ter.
