Iran Moves Mock Aircraft Carrier Into Strait Of Hormuz. 
The AP (7/27, Gambrell) reports satellite photos released Monday show that Iran "has moved a 
mock aircraft carrier to the strategic Strait of Hormuz amid heightened tensions with the United 
States." The AP describes the move as a signal that Iran "soon plans to use it for live-fire drills." 
While "Iranian state media and officials have yet to acknowledge bringing the replica out to the 
Strait of Hormuz, through which 20% of the world's oil passes," its "appearance there suggests 
Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard is preparing an encore of a similar mock-sinking it 
conducted in 2015." 
Israel Says It Fired On Hezbollah Fighters Who Crossed Over From Lebanon. 
The New York Times (7/27, Kershner, 18.61M) reports that on Monday, the Israeli military 
"said...that it had thwarted a raid by a Hezbollah 'terrorist squad' in a disputed area along its 
northern border with Lebanon, resulting in an exchange of fire that capped days of mounting 
tension there." Hezbollah "denied that there had been an exchange of fire, saying the only firing 
had come from the Israeli side." The Times says Israel "had been bracing for retaliation from 
Hezbollah since the killing of one of its operatives in a strike in Syria last week that was 
attributed to Israel." 
The Washington Post (7/27, Eglash, Dadouch, 14.2M) reports Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, 
an Israeli army spokesman, "said the flare-up was sparked by an 'infiltration attempt by a 
terrorist squad that crossed the Blue Line by a few meters." The Post reports that Conricus" 
said that the group was monitored by Israeli army field observers and that the 'infiltration was 
successfully thwarted." The Post adds that although the Israel Defense Forces "identified the 
fighters as a Hezbollah cell...there were doubts in Lebanon" because Hezbollah "does not shy 
from claiming its operations or losses." Reuters (7/27) reports that "the incident occurred in the 
Shebaa Farms area, occupied by Israel and claimed by Lebanon." Reuters says the United 
Nations "regards the territory as part of Syrian land captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East 
war." 
Taliban Executes Prison Guard As UN Releases Report On Violence Against Civilians. 
The New York Times (7/27, Mashal, Rahim, 18.61M) reports, "The Taliban abducted and 
executed a female prison guard in the eastern Afghan province of Ghazni, officials and relatives 
said Monday, as the United Nations expressed concern over the war's unending toll on civilians." 
Fatima Rajabi, 23, was abducted "on her way to her home village in the Jaghori district two 
weeks ago," and after keeping her in captivity "for two weeks, the Taliban executed the young 
woman and sent her body to her family, her brother, Samiullah Rajabi, said." The United 
Nations, "in a report released on Monday on civilian harm in the Afghan conflict in the first six 
months of the year, expressed particular concern about the rise of abductions and executions 
by the Taliban." 
China Takes Control Of US Consulate In Chengdu. 
Reuters (7/27, Pollard, Peter) reports that China on Monday took control of "the premises of the 
U.S. consulate in the southwestern city of Chengdu...after ordering the facility to be vacated in 
retaliation for China's ouster last week from its consulate in Houston, Texas." The US consulate 
"was closed as of 10 a.m (0200) on Monday, and Chinese authorities had entered the building 
from the front door, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement." Reuters says the 
move "capped a dramatic escalation in tensions between the world's two biggest economies 
that began when employees at China's Houston consulate were seen burning documents in a 
courtyard last Tuesday, hours before Beijing announced that it had been ordered to leave the 
facility."
