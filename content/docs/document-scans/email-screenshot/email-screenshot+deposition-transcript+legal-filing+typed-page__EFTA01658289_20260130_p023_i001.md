The AP (7/30, Sainz) reports from Memphis, Tennessee, "A Tennessee state senator was 
indicted Thursday on dozens of counts of stealing more than $600,000 in federal funds received 
by a health care school she directed and using the money to pay for personal items and 
expenses." The AP adds, "A federal grand jury in Memphis handed down the indictment against 
Democratic state Sen. Katrina Robinson, one day after the U.S. attorney's office unsealed a 
criminal complaint alleging she used grant money earmarked for health care worker training to 
pay for her wedding and honeymoon, home improvements, a Jeep Renegade for her daughter, 
her children's snow cone business, a campaign event, legal fees for her divorce, and other 
things. The indictment includes 24 counts of theft and embezzlement involving government 
programs, and 24 counts of wire fraud, U.S. attorney Michael Dunavant said in a statement." 
Los Angeles City Councilman Charged In Corruption Probe. 
CBS News (7/30, 3.68M) reports, "A federal grand jury on Thursday returned a 34-count 
indictment against Los Angeles City Councilman Jose Huizar as part of an ongoing corruption 
investigation, CBS Los Angeles reports. Huizar, 51, has been accused of leading a criminal 
enterprise where prosecutors say he used his position at City Hall to enrich himself and his 
close associates." Huizar "was charged last month with one count of conspiracy to violate the 
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act. Thursday's indictment charges 
Huizar with the following criminal charges: 12 counts of honest services wire fraud; two counts 
of honest services mail fraud; four counts of traveling interstate in aid of racketeering; six 
counts of bribery; five counts of money laundering; one count of structuring cash deposits to 
conceal bribes; one count of making a false statement to a financial institution; one count of 
making false statements to federal law enforcement; and one count of tax evasion, according to 
prosecutors." 
NBC News (7/31, 6.14M) reports, "A previous federal charge of conspiracy to violate the 
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act was incorporated into Thursday's 
indictment, said Ciaran McEvoy, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney's office in Los Angeles. 
The new allegations include multiple counts of wire fraud, mail fraud, traveling interstate in aid 
of racketeering, bribery and money laundering and single counts of structuring cash deposits to 
conceal bribes, making a false statement to a financial institution, making false statements to 
federal law enforcement and tax evasion. The case stems from allegations that Huizar took 
bribes from an unnamed Chinese billionaire developer and others in exchange for weighing in 
favorably on proposed construction projects." 
The Los Angeles Times (7/30, 4.64M) reports, "He is the fifth person to be charged in the 
ongoing investigation, which has netted guilty pleas from former Huizar aide George Esparza, 
real estate consultant George Chiang, political fundraiser Justin Jangwoo Kim and former 
Councilman Mitchell Englander. The indictment alleges that Huizar tried to cover up the illicit 
money in several ways, including guiding his aide on how to avoid bank reporting requirements 
and using family members to launder hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes. It also alleges 
that he made false statements to federal prosecutors and the FBI." 
Texas Man Sentenced For Wire Fraud In New Hampshire. 
The AP (7/30) reports from Concord, New Hampshire, "A former college student from Texas 
who posed as a film producer has been sentenced in New Hampshire to more than a year in jail 
for defrauding several foreign citizens living in the United States." Shiva Chandan Reddy Thudi, 
26, of Irving, Texas, "was sentenced to 12 months and a day in federal prison for wire fraud, 
United States Attorney Scott Murray announced Thursday. Thudi attended college in New 
Hampshire from 2015 to 2017, where he met and defrauded several people, according to court 
documents and witness statements. Thudi falsely claimed he was seeking investors to share in 
profits from a business that produced and distributed films in the United States. He was neither 
a film producer nor a film distributor."
