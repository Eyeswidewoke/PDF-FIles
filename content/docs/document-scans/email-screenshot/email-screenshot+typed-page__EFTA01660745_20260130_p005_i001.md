Continued Reporting: The FBI Is Starting a New Program to Prevent Mass Violence 
Spectrum News (07/02, Thompson) reported that the FBI Cleveland and FBI Behavioral Analysis Unit 
(BAU) are urging the public to be aware of behaviors that might indicate someone is on a "pathway to 
violence." In a release, Greg Nelsen, FBI Cleveland Special Agent in Charge, emphasized the importance of 
reporting suspicious behavior, saying, "As bystanders, we might think we are overreacting... The reality is 
that it is vitally important to report suspicious behavior, whether to the FBI or to local law enforcement." 
According to the article, the BAU's Prevent Mass Violence campaign encourages reporting troubling 
behaviors to authorities or trusted individuals. These behaviors include threats, fantasies about violence, 
creating materials explaining future violence, and increasing isolation. The article quoted Brad Hentschel, 
a supervisory special agent in BAU: "Mass shooters don't just snap. Recognizing and reporting the 
warning signs of someone thinking about and preparing for violence can be lifesaving." Utah News 
Dispatch (07/02, Dunphey) reported that the FBI's new Prevent Mass Violence campaign aims to help the 
public recognize and report warning signs of potential mass shooters. Shohini Sinha, the special agent in 
charge of the Salt Lake City FBI Field Office, emphasized, "Active shooters, mass shooters, do not just 
snap. They consider, they plan and they prepare for their attacks over time, sometimes as long as years. 
Often, people around them see what's happening." She highlighted behaviors such as making violent 
jokes or comments, experiencing unusual difficulty coping with stress, and isolating from others. Sinha 
also stated, "If you notice somebody doing any of these things, it's important that you talk to somebody 
you trust. What is important is that you tell somebody, because we can't do anything about it if we don't 
know." The article also detailed cases illustrating these warning signs, including a local shooting incident 
and a foiled school attack. WOIO (CBS-19) (07/02, McSweeney) and KSL-FM (07/02, Peterson) also 
reported on the story.

COUNTERTERRORISM 
Heavy Security Presence Planned for July 4th Boston Pops Fireworks Spectacular 
Boston Globe (07/02, Sweeney) reported that despite no credible threats being detected, there will be a 
heavy security presence at the Boston Pops Fireworks Spectacular on July 4th, and attendees are urged to 
avoid bringing prohibited items. According to the article, Jodi Cohen, the special agent in charge of the 
FBI's Boston Division, said the FBI "is not aware of any specific or credible threats" targeting the Boston 
Pops Fireworks Spectacular or any other July 4th festivities. "That said ... we must maintain a heightened 
state of vigilance, given that we are home to many patriotic and historical landmarks, and this event is an 
attractive and symbolic target," Cohen said at Tuesday's news conference. "The threats we are facing 
from domestic, international, and state-sponsored terrorism actors are all elevated. But the law 
enforcement team standing here today is actively collecting and sharing intelligence about the possible 
threats in real-time so that we can make informed decisions on the best use of our resources should 
potential threats to public safety arise." The article noted that Cohen asked the public to be "an extension 
of our eyes and ears" and "reach out to law enforcement if you come across someone or something that 
doesn't seem quite right." She continued, "Before many mass attacks, perpetrators have shown signs they 
were on the pathway to violence, including comments, jokes, or threats about violent plans, reduced 
interest in hobbies, or other activities, increasing isolation from family, friends or others, and angry 
outbursts or physical aggression. In many cases, a witness to these signs did not know who to alert about 
their concern. Please report them to us or local law enforcement because working together, we increase 
our chances of preventing mass violence." WABC (ABC-7) (07/02, Staff Writer) noted that one of the 
scenarios the FBI is warning about is the use of drones to attack large groups that are watching fireworks
