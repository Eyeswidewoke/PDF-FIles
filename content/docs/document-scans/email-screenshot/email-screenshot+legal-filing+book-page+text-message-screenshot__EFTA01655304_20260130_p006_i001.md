Opinion: How to Combat China's Transnational Repression 
An opinion piece published by The National Interest (07/30, Pang) reported that the Chinese government is using 
transnational repression to silence critics and exert control over diaspora communities in Western countries, often 
through coercive tactics such as computer hacking, doxxing, and threatening victims and their families. According 
to the article, the U.S. government has recently ramped up efforts to combat transnational repression, with 
Congress introducing bipartisan bills such as the Transnational Repression Policy Act and the SHIELD Against CCP 
Act to establish a working group and implement stricter sanctions against perpetrators. The author assessed 
that the securitization of transnational repression has led to a trade-off between progressive human rights 
advocacy and a security-oriented approach, with some bills proposing measures that could tighten border controls 
and restrict immigration, potentially compromising efforts to reform the immigration system and protect 
vulnerable diaspora communities. The author highlighted that only recently have Congress, the FBI, the DOJ, and 
the DHS ramped up their efforts to combat this chronically overlooked, non-conventional security threat.
