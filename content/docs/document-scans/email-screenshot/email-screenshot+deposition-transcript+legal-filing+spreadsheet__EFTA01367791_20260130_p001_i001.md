S&P hits record high on 18 trailing PE, 
PE will be sensitive to Treasury yields 
PE at j)O8(.cr isis high on delayed Fed hike expectations boosts S&P to record 
S&P grinds higher despite continued soft macro data on dovish central bank 
communications. S&P trades at 18x trailing 4-qtr EPS (2O14-1O15). the highest 
since 2010. Fed lowered its 2015-16 FF rate outlook in March and the April 
minutes dismiss the June hike. Market liftoff expectations are slipping to after 
Sept. ECB reiterates its asset purchase goals. Liftoff accompanied by Fed 
forecasts of a 2% plateau rate this cycle would pave the road for a S&P trailing 
PE of 18.5 at 2015 end and perhaps higher in later years if 10yr Treasury yields 
do not materially exceed 3%. But waiting too long to hike raises the risk of unit 
labor cost acceleration and a disorderly climb to higher 10yr yields. 
Median steak PE remains high, 
s tieing above historic norms is broad based 
Many metrics suggest S&P valuation is full and dependent on low bond yields. 
S&P's 18 trailing PE and 17.3 forward PE are 12% and 22% above the averages 
since 1960. The median trailing PE of all S&P stocks is 18.7, 2 full points higher 
than its historic average. The index is entering 1997-2000 valuations ex. Tech. 
It's time to buy the Big & Loy.; 25 stock basket again as Energy names tall ow 
The 25 stocks that most lower the S&P PE are attractive again. These stocks 
have big market cap and earnings weights and trade at low PEs vs. the S&P. 
These 25 stocks are: 9 Financials (JPM, C, WFC, BAC, GS, MET, PRU, AIG, 
C0F), 8 Tech (AAPL, IBM, HPO, CSCO, MU, OCOM, INTC, ORCL), 2 Airlines 
(AAL, DAL), 2 Telecom (VZ, T), 2 Autos (GM, F), 1 Health Care (GILD), and 1 
Energy (VLO). The aggregate PE on 2015 EPS of these 25 stocks is 12 vs. 20x 
for the S&P excluding them. We see value at Telecom. but return it to EW from 
the OW set Jan end and put Media/Cable back to EW from UW. We OW 
HealthCare, Tech, Financials & Utilities. We UW Energy, Indus. & Materials. 
Market ‘:ornplacenev r eiernet pus in both cash equities and derivatives 
Our PENIX market emotion indicator climbed to 1.3 on S&P trailing PE of 18 
and 3m avg VIX of 14. A level between 1.2-1.5 signals complacency. There 
was similar complacency going into summer last year, with S&P trailing PE at 
17.5 and a calm market kept VIX at 10-14. The complacency persisted to July 
but then faded as the risk of higher yields came on falling unemployment, but 
yields ultimately stayed subdued preventing any major summer sell-off. Yet a 
selloff began in late Sept as oil prices started cracking and the dollar climbing. 
Risk of a near ter;r: 
dip is high 
We believe the probability of a 5%+ dip is high this summer and our tactical 
call remains Down given the S&P now at an even higher PE than a year ago, 
heightened uncertainty in 10yr yields, weak earnings growth and continued 
soft economic data. We haven't had a 5%+ dip this year. Historically 5%+ dips 
are common and happen at least once a year since 1960, except 1964, 1993 & 
1995. It has been 916 trading days (3.6 years) since a 10% correction. Selloff 
triggers could be a further rise in Irlyr yields especially if UE keeps falling 
amidst slow economic growth and Fed remains unclear on first hike timing, or 
a jump in the dollar upon the Fed expressing firm intentions to hike in Sept. 
There is also the possibility of central banks competing to out-dove each other 
this summer, such that yields climb upon delayed Fed hikes (PE bad) & yet the 
dollar climbs too (EPS bad) as other central banks stay determined to keep 
their currencies weak vs. dollar. We know central banks want to be supportive 
of markets and confidence, but this has its risks now especially in the US.
