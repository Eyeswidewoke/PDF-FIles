enforcement and removal operations. The article noted that other law enforcement agencies, including the US 
Marshals Service, Customs and Border Protection, and the Drug Enforcement Administration, are also being 
diverted to support immigration enforcement efforts, straining their resources and raising concerns about 
prioritization. The article highlighted that top FBI officials have provided little guidance to field offices on how 
agents are expected to increase immigration arrest numbers while also working their top priority cases, the sources 
said. The article stated that FBI agents have been told by supervisors not to document moving resources away from 
high-priority cases toward immigration-related work, according to one person familiar with the matter. "While the 
FBI does not comment on specific personnel decisions, our agents and support staff are dedicated professionals 
working around the clock to defend the homeland and crush violent crime — a mission which certainly overlaps 
with the consequences of the previous administration's four-year open border policies," FBI spokesperson Ben 
Williamson said in a statement to CNN. "We are proud to work with our interagency partners to keep the American 
people safe." The article added that the all-hands-on-deck-for-immigration approach is raising critical questions 
inside the FBI and other law enforcement agencies about how they use limited resources to execute their mission. 
"Should we have highly trained FBI agents going to support OHS priorities?" the former FBI agent said. "Is this just a 
surge that's going to be temporary?" 
FBI Email Instructs Employees Not to Promote Pride Month on Bureau Time 
Fox News (05/29, Miller) reported that the FBI has instructed employees not to promote Pride Month in their 
professional capacity, as stated in an email from Assistant Director for Public Affairs Ben Williamson. According to 
the article, employees are allowed to participate in Pride Month activities in their personal capacity, but not using 
FBI resources or their Bureau affiliation. "I've received several questions about the FBI's stance on Pride Month and 
what related activities FBI divisions and employees should or should not participate in," Williamson said in the 
email. "So, I want to take the opportunity to make FBI leadership's expectations clear: There should be no official 
FBI actions, events, or messaging regarding Pride Month." The article noted that the email comes after the Trump 
administration has shifted away from diversity, equity, and inclusion messaging and programs in the federal 
government, instead focusing on meritocracy and the individual missions of departments. "Let good cops be cops—
and rebuild trust in the FBI," Director Patel said in his first statement after being sworn in to lead the bureau.
