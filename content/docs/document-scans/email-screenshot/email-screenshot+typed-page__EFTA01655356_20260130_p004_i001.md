FBI Daily News Briefing 
FBI Agents Association Denounces Firings as Unlawful Amid Democratic Accusations of DOJ Weaponization' 
MSNBC (08/11, Benen) and The Hill (08/11, Beitsch) reported that Democrats are criticizing the DOJ and the 
intelligence community for actions they see as abuses of power and threats to independence, including the FBI's 
involvement in tracking down Democratic Texas lawmakers. According to the article, the DOJ has subpoenaed New 
York Attorney General Letitia James and launched a grand jury investigation into Obama-era officials, prompting 
accusations of politicization and retaliation. The FBI has fired several agents who worked on controversial cases, 
including those related to President Trump, sparking claims of retribution and abuse of power, with Democrats 
arguing that these moves are part of a broader pattern of "weaponization" of the DOJ and intelligence community. 
The FBI Agents Association criticized the firings as unlawful. "The FBI Agents Association strongly condemns today's 
unlawful firing of FBI Special Agents. These Agents were carrying out the assignments given to them and did their 
jobs professionally and with integrity," the group said in a Friday statement. "This action sets a dangerous 
precedent. It increases our vulnerability to criminal and national security threats at home and abroad. It prioritizes 
division over unity, stokes anger instead of solidarity within our ranks, and threatens to chill the work of agents 
rather than support it." The group added, "The aim, it seems, is to transform the FBI from a respected, 
constitutionally grounded investigative service into a personal enforcement arm of a political figure. We have seen 
these dynamics abroad — leaders who demand loyalty from security services not to the law, but to themselves. 
These regimes do not end well." They highlighted, "FBI Agents—the rank-and-file men and women who protect this 
country every day—asked only for Bureau leadership to follow the law by providing Agents with fair treatment and 
due process. Director Patel committed to providing that—to Agents, to Congress, and to the American people. 
Today, he failed to honor that commitment." The articles noted that the Trump administration has broadly 
defended such moves, consistently arguing the FBI and the Justice Department were political tools of previous 
administrations while arguing their own actions help confront those abuses. "President Trump is restoring integrity 
to the Department of Justice after four years of weaponization, hoaxes, and attempts to imprison him. The DOJ is 
upholding Lady Justice and working to execute President Trump's Make America Safe Again agenda, which is 
lowering crime, holding criminals accountable, and empowering our law enforcement community," White House 
spokesperson Harrison Fields said in a statement. Newsmax (08/11, Weatherholtz) also reported on the story.

COUNTERTERRORISM 
California Woman Admits Leading White Supremacist Terrorist Group, DOJ Says 
The Jerusalem Post (08/11, Sadikman) reported that Dallas Humber, the leader of the Terrorgram Collective, has 
pleaded guilty to charges including soliciting hate crimes and orchestrating murders of federal officials. Humber 
admitted to leading the white supremacist terror group from July 2022 until her arrest in September 2024, and is 
facing 2S-30 years in federal prison. Under her leadership, the Terrorgram Collective carried out violent acts in the 
U.S. and internationally, including assassination attempts, murders, and terror attacks in countries such as 
Australia, Slovakia, Brazil, and Turkey. The article highlighted that the FBI Sacramento Field Office investigated this 
case in collaboration with various other foreign and domestic law enforcement agencies. "The leader of the 
Terrorgram Collective influenced hate and violence across the globe while living in a quiet suburb," said Special 
Agent in Charge Sid Patel of the FBI Sacramento Field Office in the press release. "Through close collaboration with 
our domestic and international partners, we defended the homeland and dismantled a dangerous network intent 
on inciting violence to advance its extremist ideology. Those who direct or commit acts of terror in our 
communities will face justice." KTXL (Fox-40) (08/11, Ayoubgoulan) also reported on the story. 
Continued Reporting: FBI on the Case After Fourth Bomb Threat in Boston 
Boston.com (08/11, Lucchesi) reported that the FBI has joined the Nantucket Police Department, Massachusetts 
State Police, and the Massachusetts Bomb Squad in investigating four false bomb threats made over three nights, 
all targeting 16 Main Street, home to a Ralph Lauren store. The threats—reported on Tuesday, Friday, and Saturday 
—varied in details, with claims of improvised explosive devices placed in a vehicle, a box, or to be planted in the 
store, and one caller also claimed to be armed. Each incident prompted perimeter security and searches, but no 
explosives were found. The store had previously been shut down following a false bomb report in March 2024, and 
the current investigation remains ongoing. Additional reporting was provided by WFXT (Fox-25) (08/11,
