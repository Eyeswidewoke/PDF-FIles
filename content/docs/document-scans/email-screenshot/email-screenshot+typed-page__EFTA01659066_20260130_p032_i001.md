Ex-Spy Recruited By Prince Had Key Role In Project Veritas Hiring. 
The New York Times (10/21, Goldman, Mazzetti, 18.61M) reports, "A British former spy 
recruited by Erik Prince, the security contractor close to the Trump administration, played a 
central role in a secretive effort to hire dozens of operatives for the conservative group Project 
Veritas, deposition testimony shows." Job applicants traveled to Wyoming for interviews with 
Richard Seddon "as Project Veritas sought to expand its operations" in 2017. The Times says

intelligence-gathering apparatus to infiltrate Democratic congressional campaigns, labor 
organizations, news media and other groups."

"rejected...the announced purchase of 46 million doses of a potential vaccine against COVID-19 
being developed by a Chinese company and tested in the state governed by his political rival, 
prompting concern he was allowing politics to steer public health decisions. 'The Brazilian 
people will not be anyone's guinea pig,' Bolsonaro said on his social media channels, adding 
that the shot is yet to complete testing - which is true of all potential vaccines." According to

Brazilian Volunteer In AstraZeneca Vaccine Trial Dies. The CBS Evening NewsVi 
(10/21, story 4, 0:25, O'Donnell, 4.55M) reported, "Tonight, health officials in Brazil report that 
a volunteer in AstraZeneca's COVID vaccine trial has died. Now, a photo was released of the 
male volunteer. It's unclear whether he received the vaccine or a placebo shot. AstraZeneca 
says there are no concerns about continuing the study in Brazil. ... Its trial here in the US was 
put on hold last month after a volunteer in Europe developed neurological symptoms." 
Reuters (10/21, Burger) reports that "a source familiar with the matter told Reuters that 
the trial would have been suspended if the volunteer who died had received the COVID-19 
vaccine, suggesting the person was part of the control group that was given a meningitis 
vaccine." CNN Brasil "reported that the volunteer was a 28-year-old man who lived in Rio de 
Janeiro and died from COVID-19 complications," though Brazilian health authority Anvisa 
"provided no further details, citing medical confidentiality of those involved in trials."

Agency "said the international safety committee had recommended the trial continue." The Post 
says, "The death of the patient casts more uncertainty over trials that were suspended last
