As you can now attest to, 
can be a bit overwhelming with her emails and phone calls some of which are starting 
to read like a personal vendetta. I think I should state for the record that all of us have advised her in one way or another 
that we are not going to give her blow-by-blow details on what the FBI is doing, or not, with Epstein despite her insistence 
that we make a move to arrest him now. She insists that every phone call or email she gets regarding Epstein be passed 
along to someone here at the FBI. Therefore, I'm not sure what to recommend at this juncture about what I'm sure will be 
a summer full of emails and phone calls on him from her. 
Judy if you would like to weigh in, we would appreciate it. To give you some background, 
recently reached out to 
us to sa that E stein's email address was found in her daughter's address book and she was concerned about her safety. 
SA 
at WFO looked into it. I guess what I need to know from Miami is whether you want me, or us, to pass on 
the information she provides or not. Trust me - it's a daily log of informational emails. 
El thanks for looking into the situation with her kid.

Hi all, 
I have had several email exchanges with 
most of which at least one of you is usually included on the exchange 
somewhere. I have kept all the emails and printed them to refer to. 
I have spoken with 
once at length, the day after I received an email to follow up on this situation. 
provided a great deal of information regarding Epstein, MC2, And her belief that children were being trafficked through this 
modeling agency. However, my initial concern was any threat posed to her daughter as a result of Epstein's email 
appearing on her daughters contact list. 
It turns out that her daughter is 25 years old, and resides in New York. I obtained the email address of her daughter and 
Epstein's that appeared and can speculate how it got there. At this time 
did not feel the level of risk was too great, 
but assured me that she would provide her daughter my information in case she needed to reach someone familiar with the 
situation. 
The situation continues now to focus on the child sex trafficking allegations and all the information she has gathered. I don't 
believe the venue is DC/Northern VA, but am happy to assist however you feel necessary. 
Do you know if there is someone that she should talk to in Miami about her knowledge, or should she speak to the media 
rep through the agent there? 
I am at a juncture and need some guidance. I know this is not a ball to get dropped, but don't want to involve us here in 
DC, out of our territory, unless requested to do so, especially if this is all being investigated and uncovered already by 
agents in other field offices. 
Please advise. 
Thanks so much,
