Leon, 
I h=te having to write this. however . I wanted you to understand the seriousness of your dysfunctional family office. I 
spent the last week reviewing it.. The office has su=fered from lack of control and clear direction. Eileen has been a 
ni=htmare for you . she hammmered together the office in a willy nilly fashion either trying to hire c quality people or 
once h=red guying no defined roles. she and ada protecting what they see as their turf, errors upon errors upon error=. 
millions of dollars unaccounted for. 500k again found in a drawre=20 last week In early sept I notified you that joslin 
was unable to deal=20 with ada eileen . I sent delson in the referee.. i again notifed you in early oct that she needed to 
go. but needed them until=oct 15. I pointed out the risk of keeping the dynamic duo was their effect on j=slin. . in nov I 
sent you a emil telling you i thought he could not=take more of their interefernce.. this week, in the first face to face = 
had with him since dec he could not respond to simple questions , spoke finnacial gibberish, had misleading answers. 
bad answers i, wild elliptical statements. As=you asked i confronted brad with this , and to my amazment brad said that 
his take was=the same but this is how he found him in early jan and thought it was just his normal behavior,=C24, In 
mid nov you suggested thtat your choice to run the office was Brad.and he w=uld replace eileen. from mid dec he 
audited until early jan, when he assumed your job t=at im told is only 75% of his time. HE might be capable of runing 
you= office but i have yet to see any indication that that is true. ON thu=s I handed the same spread sheet that I had 
sent to brad, to fourt>=A0 financial execs. (only to mine with actual numbers), to a person each=20 withim minutes 
said this makes no sense. no sense whatsoe=er, bad numbers bad cagtegories. bad inputs outputs numbers that dont 
add. if=20 it was an mri , of joslin i woudl say serious breakdown. Q=A0l had him over to explain to my team what had 
happend, and then sent my do to speak to him and others at elysium. I pointed out to you that joslon could =ot make 
the first pass at hiring a finance person . I was right. HE is a g=eat tax person, period. no social skills reporting skills or 
mgmt skills.=C240 ITS a mess and a larger one than I thought. sorry, I have begun to interview some cfo.s 40=A0and 
have put out more feelers. if you feel comfortable i think you should ask at apollo for=help.. It is now too late to 
remove eileen entirely as i had been re=uesting. I have not spokein to her in months . but during this crazy=delay in 
doing so, she is now significantly more entrenched. A re-do is ne=essary . top down. 
you have repeatedly pointed out that you beleive you have paid me =hat you consider a great deal of money. you are 
one of my best friends. to=say you made a good deal would be an understatment. I have spent the majority of the last 
year restructuring your things. I had cancel= my europe trips for the last six months of last year. I am down money, 
friends and clients doing so. I take our friendhsip very serio=lsy and feel not one iota of regret though I made a bad 
deal but lived=up to it. and more much more 
that being said, you will need to bring i= a few people to start from the top down. apollo review, coordination, 
ilgo=A0bill pay, book keeping, legal reporting,filings, sec gaming foreign, pfic=20 fbar gift gtax use tax, corporate admin, 
Ilc etc. investments art. household personla. taxes. gifts, grats trusts children, chjecks and balances. banking doc review, 
tra review, brh review . review of will given=new info.. jpm goldman, db bam, check writing , foundation decision 
art consultants. boat plane. construction. travel. insurance, IT,. staff mgmt. w= will have to deal with tom ada, eileen, 
now joslin,
