FBI Agents Visit Home of New Hampshire Libertarian Party Member After Post About Harris 
WMUR (ABC-9) (09/17, Mitropoulos) reported that the FBI has responded to a social media post by a member of 
the New Hampshire Libertarian Party that referenced killing Vice President Kamala Harris. The FBI visited the home 
of Jeremy Kauffman, a member of the Libertarian Party who has acknowledged that the state party was behind the 
original post on X. The article added that Kauffman shared a video on his own X account of two FBI agents asking to 
speak with him. The two left after going back and forth with Kauffman for a few minutes. The initial post that 
apparently sparked the FBI visit was made over the weekend and said that anyone who murders Harris would be an 
"American hero." The post was later deleted, with the New Hampshire Libertarian Party saying it "did not want to 
break the terms of the website we agreed to." Time (09/17, Ewe), Newsweek (09/17, Nicholls), Daily Mail (09/17, 
Hammer), and the New York Sun (09/17, McCaughey) also reported on the story. 
Hundreds of Homes Near Houston Still Under Evacuation Orders as Pipeline Fire Burns for Second Day 
The Associated Press (09/17, Lozano, Murphy) reported that a pipeline fire that erupted in a suburban Houston 
neighborhood burned throughout a second day and into the night Tuesday with still no definitive word on when 
the blaze would finally go out, when nearby residents may be able to return home or why a car drove through a 
fence and hit a valve before the destructive explosion. The article stated that over 36 hours after the blast — which 
shot towering flames like a blowtorch above the suburbs of Deer Park and La Porte — authorities have provided 
few details about the circumstances leading up to the explosion. Investigators said it happened after the driver of a 
sport utility vehicle went through a fence near the Walmart and struck an above-ground valve. As of Tuesday 
evening, authorities had not still not identified the driver or said what happened to them. The article mentioned 
that Deer Park officials have said police and FBI agents found no preliminary evidence to suggest the explosion of 
the pipeline, which carried natural gas liquids, was a coordinated or terrorist attack. In a statement Monday night, 
the city said it "appears to be an isolated incident" but officials have not provided details on how they came to that 
conclusion. CNN (09/17, Chavez, Boyette, et al.), KHOU (CBS-11) (09/17, Villarreal), Fox News (09/17, Sorace), USA 
TODAY (09/17, Cervantes), Newsweek (09/17, Impelli), and the Los Angeles Times (09/17, Lozano, Murphy) also 
reported on the story. 
Baltimore Bridge Victims' Families Filing Suit to Prevent Shipowner From Shirking Legal Liability 
Fox News (09/17, Dorgan) reported that families of some of the immigrant workers who died when a cargo ship 
plowed into the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore in March are expected to announce Tuesday that they will 
take legal action to hold the owners of the vessel legally liable for the deadly collapse, according to a report. The 
families of three of the six victims will be asking a federal court to prevent Grace Ocean Private Limited, a 
Singapore-based company which owns the Dali, from escaping legal liability with regard to the maritime disaster. 
According to the article, in April, Grace Ocean Private Limited and Synergy Marine Pte Ltd., as manager of the Dali, 
filed a petition for exoneration from or limitation of liability in the federal district court in Maryland over the deadly 
incident. The Dali lost power on two occasions when it was little more than half a mile from the bridge in the early 
hours of March 26, which ultimately led the 117,000 ton vessel to slam into a main support pier on the bridge, 
causing part of the 47-year-old structure to collapse into the water within seconds. The Associated Press (09/17, 
Skene) reported that several other interested parties, including city officials and local businesses, have already filed 
opposing claims accusing the companies of negligence. Preliminary findings from a National Transportation Safety 
Board investigation show that the Dali experienced a series of electrical issues before and after leaving the Port of 
Baltimore. The ship was destined for Sri Lanka when it experienced a power blackout and lost steering at the worst 
possible moment. The article mentioned that the FBI launched an investigation into the circumstances leading up 
to the crash. 
Democrat Operative Fished for Oppo Research in Antisemitic, Lewd Text Messages, House Republican 
Charges 
Fox News (09/17, Colton) reported that several Republican members of Congress are accusing a liberal political 
action committee of impersonating a GOP staffer to extract potentially damaging information from elected officials 
and raise funds for Democrats — with one text exchange that targeted a female lawmaker including antisemitic and 
sexist language. According to the article, Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, (R-FL), said she received a text this summer from 
a person posing as Texas Gov. Greg Abbott's chief of staff. Before long, however, the individual launched into 
personal attacks, denigrating Luna as a "fake" Jew and making lewd comments about her. Luna says she's currently 
facing a different harassment campaign, too, as her re-election bid comes down to its final weeks. She revealed the 
bizarre details about the opposition research scheme when Fox News Digital inquired about the other allegations.
