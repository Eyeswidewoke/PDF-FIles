Navalny as they have no evidence a crime was committed. 
Trump Has Yet To Condemn Poisoning. The Washington Post (8/27, Taylor, 14.2M) 
reports, "The suspected poisoning of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny has drawn global 
condemnation" but President Trump "has not added his condemnation to the list." To the Post, 
"Trump's silence is easy fuel for his critics." 
Putin Says Prepared To Help Lukashenko If Belarus Protests Turn Violent. 
The AP (8/27, Karmanau, Isachenkov) reports on Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin 
"warned that he stands ready to send police to Belarus if protests there turn violent" and 
"Belarusian police dispersed a protest in the capital with renewed vigor Thursday, detaining 
about 180 people and raising pressure on the opposition." Putin said Belarusian President 
Alexander Lukashenko "asked him to prepare a Russian law enforcement contingent to deploy 
to Belarus if necessary." Putin said, "We have agreed not to use it until the situation starts 
spinning out of control and extremist elements acting under the cover of political slogans cross 
certain borders and engage in banditry and start burning cars, houses and banks or take over 
administrative buildings." 
The New York Times (8/27, Higgins, 18.61M) called it "an ominous warning...to protesters 
in Belarus not to push too hard to topple their country's embattled president," while the 
Washington Post (8/27, Khurshudyan, 14.2M) calls Putin's statement "the most definitive 
indication that Moscow is backing its longtime ally Lukashenko after nearly three weeks of mass 
protests calling for the strongman's ouster." 
Intelligence Officials Say US To Offer Little Support For Belarusian Protesters. 
TIME (8/27, Walcott, 18.47M) reports that demonstrators in Belarus "can expect little more 
than rhetorical support from the United States, Trump administration officials say." While some 
US diplomats "have argued for imposing sanctions on Lukashenko's regime, U.S. intelligence 
officials have concluded he is likely to remain in power despite this month's allegedly rigged 
election because he retains the support of the leadership of the nation's military, internal 
security, government-controlled news media, and intelligence services." In addition, intelligence 
officials "in the US and Western Europe say, Russia's foreign and military intelligence agencies 
have," in the words of one European official, "thoroughly penetrated or intimidated their 
comrades in Belarus." 
Citing Health, Abe Announces Resignation. 
The New York Times (8/28, Rich, 18.61M) reports Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe 
announced Friday "he will resign because of ill health...just four days after he exceeded the 
record for the longest consecutive run as leader in Japanese history." The Japanese news media 
had been speculating about Abe's health "for weeks, particularly after he significantly dialed 
back public appearances as a new wave of coronavirus infections erupted in clusters throughout 
the country. When Mr. Abe visited a hospital twice in the span of a week, the rumor mill went 
into overdrive." 
EU Leaders Divided Amid Rising Turkish, Greek Tensions. 
The New York Times (8/27, Erlanger, 18.61M) reports that an "escalating dispute between 
Greece and Turkey over energy resources in the eastern Mediterranean is fast becoming 
militarized, raising the risks of a clash among NATO allies." German Foreign Minister Heiko 
Maas, "who visited Greece and Turkey this week urging dialogue, warned both governments 
against further military escalation." As Germany tries to mediate, France, Greece, Cyprus and 
Italy are "engaged in military exercises involving ships and planes off the Cypriot coast" to 
"deter Turkey from further energy exploration in disputed waters."
