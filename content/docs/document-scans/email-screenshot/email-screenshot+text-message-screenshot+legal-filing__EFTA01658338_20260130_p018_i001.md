The New York Daily News (7/28, Brown, 2.52M) reports, "Federal prosecutors slammed 
Ghislaine Maxwell's 'absurd' effort Tuesday to name the underage girls she's accused of 
grooming for Jeffrey Epstein's sexual abuse." According to the Daily News, "Maxwell's legal 
team says they should be allowed to identify women who have previously spoken publicly about 
the British socialite's alleged role recruiting girls into Epstein's trafficking scheme. Prosecutors 
have not named any of the women they consider victims of Maxwell's sex abuse trap. In a new 
filing, Assistant U.S. Attorney Alex Rossmiller wrote that it was important to maintain that 
anonymity. 'The Government has repeatedly asked defense counsel to explain how or why it 
would need to publicly name victims of sexual abuse to prepare for trial, and the defense 
repeatedly has declined to do so, presumably because the argument borders on the absurd,' 
Rossmiller wrote in Manhattan Federal Court." 
Illinois Woman Pleads Guilty To Forced Labor. 
The Chicago Sun-Times (7/28, Seidel, 875K) reports, "A woman accused last year of keeping 
'enslaved' Guatemalan immigrants in her squalid Cicero home pleaded guilty Tuesday to forced 
labor." Concepcion Malinek, 50, "admitted through her lawyer that she helped several people 
enter the United States between 2009 and 2014, only to charge them fees and demand 
payment while threatening to have them deported. She also helped some of them obtain 
fraudulent IDs. In one case, she admitted she offered to help a Guatemalan citizen enter the 
United States illegally for $8,000 before increasing and adding fees for 'additional services.' 
Robert Rascia, Malinek's attorney, said Malinek let that person stay at her home while she paid 
off the debt."
