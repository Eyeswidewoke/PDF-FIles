FBI Probing Whether China Spied On Universities' Coronavirus Research. 
The Houston Chronicle (7/30, Britto, 730K) reports, "The FBI is investigating whether the 
Chinese government attempted to illegally obtain COVID-19 research from American 
universities, including the University of Texas at Austin, UT officials confirmed to the Houston 
Chronicle." The FBI "told UT officials last week that the closure of the Chinese Consulate in 
Houston sparked the probe, wrote Daniel Jaffe, UT's interim executive vice president and 
provost, in an email to the university's faculty, graduate and post-doctorate students on 
Monday. As a result of this `ongoing and evolving national situation,' the FBI will contact UT 
researchers `about the role of the consulate and efforts by the Chinese government to illegally 
procure research from American universities,' Jaffe said." 
The Austin ca() American Statesman (7/30, Korte, Subscription Publication, 343K) 
reports, "The FBI is looking into whether the Chinese government tried to illegally procure 
coronavirus vaccine research from American universities, including the University of Texas, UT 
officials said this week." The American Statesman adds, "In an email to faculty and graduate 
students Monday evening, UT interim Executive Vice President and Provost Dan Jaffe said the 
FBI notified the university last week that, due to the recent closure of the Chinese Consulate in 
Houston, it will be contacting UT researchers about the role of the consulate and efforts by the 
Chinese government to illegally procure research. The U.S. government took over the Chinese 
Consulate in Houston last week amid allegations of espionage. `We do not know whom the FBI 
intends to contact or what they plan to discuss, nor have we shared anyone's information or 
details about ongoing research with FBI agents,' Jaffe said in his email. `It's not unusual for 
federal law enforcement officers to ask to speak with researchers if deemed necessary to 
support criminal or national security investigations." KEYE-TV Austin, TX (7/30, Bontke) also 
reports. 
Democrats Press Nunes For Details On Anti-Biden Package Provided By Ukrainian 
Official. 
Politico (7/30, Cheney, 4.29M) reports Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA) this week "declined to answer 
a colleague's question about whether he had received derogatory information about Vice 
President Joe Biden from Andrii Derkach, a Kremlin-linked Ukrainian lawmaker who has worked 
to foment allegations of corruption by Biden and his son Hunter." During a closed-door business 
meeting "of the panel on Wednesday - a transcript of which was made publicly available 
Thursday - Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney (D-NY) pressed Nunes about news reports indicating that 
he was one of several GOP lawmakers who was delivered packets of information from Derkach 
containing allegations about Biden in December 2019." Derkach has "confirmed that he sent the 
packages to Nunes, as well as Sens. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) and Lindsey Graham (R-SC)." 
Derkach has provoked "growing alarm among Democrats, who have noted his increasingly 
public efforts to promote anti-Biden allegations." 
Lessons From The KGB On Dirty Tricks In 2020 Election. 
CNN (7/30, O'Sullivan, Naik, Scott, 83.16M) reports it's a "modern-day digital disinformation 
playbook that US intelligence agencies will almost certainly be watching out for ahead of 
November's presidential election — especially after Russia's efforts to interfere in the 2016 
election caught the country off guard." But to fully understand "Russia's use of tactics like false 
news stories and leaked materials, it's useful to examine the country's long history of 
painstaking influence operations dating back to an analog era." Jack Barsky, a former KGB spy 
"who lived undercover in the US in the 1980s, explained how it was done back in his day in an 
interview with CNN Business last year." The KGB would take "great care to furnish a convincing 
forgery of a US government document, often with the goal of implicating the US in something 
tawdry and designed to appear to confirm an existing conspiracy theory. That forgery would 
then be given to a sympathetic, unwitting reporter."
