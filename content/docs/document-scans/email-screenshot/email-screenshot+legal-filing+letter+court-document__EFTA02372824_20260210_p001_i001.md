CRUISING a Walmart in Clayton County, Georgia, with Sergeant Russel= Haney of US army recruiting, it would be easy to 
think most Americans are=aching to serve Uncle Sam. Almost every teenager or 20-something he hails, in his cheery 
Tennessee drawl, amid the mounds of plastic bucket= and cut-price tortilla chips, appears tempted by his offer. 
Lemeanfa, a 1=-year-old former football star, says he is halfway sold on it; Dseanna, an=18-year-old shopper, says she is 
too, provided she won't have to go to war. Serving in the coffee sho=, Archel and Lily, a brother and sister from the US 
Virgin Islands, listen=greedily to the education, training and other benefits the recruiting serg=ant reels off. "You don't 
want a job, you want a career!" he tells them, as a passer-by thrusts a packet o= cookies into his hands, to thank him for 
his service.</=> 
Southern, poorer than the national average, mostly black and with l=ngstanding ties to the army, the inhabitants of 
Clayton County are among t=e army's likeliest recruits. Last year they furnished it with more soldiers than most of the 
rest of the greater Atlanta area pu= together. Yet Sergeant's Haney's battalion, which is responsi=le for it, still failed to 
make its annual recruiting target—and a d=y out with the unit suggests why. 
Much of the friendly reception for Sergeant Haney he puts down to f=ne southern manners; in fact, no one in Walmart is 
likely to enlist. Lemea=fa has a tattoo behind his ear, an immediate disqualifier. Dseanna has a one-year-old baby, and 
would have to sign away custody of hi=. Lily's girlfriend has a toddler she does not want to leave; Archel=won't leave his 
sister. Even the cookie-giver is less propitious tha= he seems: he symbolises, Sergeant Haney says ruefully, as he bins his 
gift, that paying lip-service to the armed forces= as opposed to doing military service, is all most Americans are good 
for.=nbsp; 
In a society given to ostentatious public obeisance to the services=#8212;during National Military Appreciation Month, 
on Military Spouse Day =nd on countless other such public holidays and occasions—the figures that support this claim 
are astonishing. In the financial year tha= ended on September 30th America's four armed services—army, n=vy, air 
force and marines—aimed to recruit 177,000 people, mainly fr=m among the 21m Americans aged 17-21. Yet all 
struggled, and the army, which accounted for nearly half that target, made its number= at great cost and the eleventh 
hour, only by cannibalising its store of r=cruits for the current year. It failed by 2,000 to meet its target of 17,3=0 recruits 
for the army reserve, which is becoming more important to national security as the full-time arm= shrinks from a recent 
peak of 566,000 to a projected 440,000 by 2019=;its lowest level since the second world war. "I find it 
remarkable,=#8221; says the commander of army recruiting, Major-General Jeffrey Snow. "That we have been in two 
protracted land campaigns an= we have an American public that thinks very highly of the military, yet t=e vast majority 
has lost touch with it. Less than 1% of Americans are will=ng and able to serve."
