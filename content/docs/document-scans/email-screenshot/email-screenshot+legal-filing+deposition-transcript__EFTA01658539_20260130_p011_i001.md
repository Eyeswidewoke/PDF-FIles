radiation caused by natural decay, the agency said." An NNSA statement is quoted saying the

Congressman: US Must Sanction Russian Sovereign Debt To Protect Elections. 
Rep. Brad Sherman (D-CA) writes in an opinion piece for The Hill (10/19, 2.98M) that the 
Trump Administration has done "very little" to "hold Russia accountable for...attacks on our 
democracy." Since 2016, the intelligence community has warned "that the government of 
Russia is actively interfering in U.S. elections." More recently, ODNI, the director of the FBI, and 
the Treasury Department "have each publicly confirmed that Russia is working to influence the 
2020 U.S. election." Sherman argues that of the "limited actions the administration has a taken 
to respond to Russian's malign activity, few of them have imposed any meaningful new 
penalties directly on the Russian government or Russian President Vladimir Putin." The 
California Congressman concludes the US needs to "deliver a clear message to Vladimir Putin 
that there will be meaningful consequences for his government violating our sovereignty 
through election interference," and that cutting off Russian access to "U.S. capital markets is 
the first and most critical step the United States can take towards doing that." 
EU Struggles To Defend Against Russian Disinformation Campaigns. 
Bloomberg (10/19, Halpin, 4.73M) reports, "More than five years after it began trying in 
earnest to combat Russian disinformation, the European Union is yet to substantially curtail its 
reach, Alberto Nardelli writes." The bloc "still has few defenses against sophisticated Kremlin 
campaigns designed to weaken cohesion in the west." After "Russian opposition leader Alexey 
Navalny was poisoned," the EU found "that some of the most popular coverage in Germany 
came from Kremlin-funded news organizations casting doubt on Berlin's conclusion that Moscow 
was to blame," for instance. However, the "limitations of the Kremlin's strategies also have been 
exposed in its attempts to promote far-right political parties and sow division in the EU." 
Bloomberg concludes that "while the virus of Kremlin information warfare can raise the 
temperature of already bitter social discourses in Europe and the U.S., competent, clear-eyed 
leadership remains the best antidote." 
Syrian Paper: US Officials Have Made Four Secret Trips To Damascus. 
Following up on reporting from the Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post (10/19, Dadouch, 
14.2M) reports that in August, U.S. Ambassador Roger Carstens, "an envoy for hostage affairs," 
and Kash Patel, "a top White House counterterrorism adviser," traveled to Syria "for secret talks 
about the fate of missing American journalist Austin Tice, sanctions and the U.S. military 
presence in Syria, in rare high-level negotiations." The Post cites Al Watan, "a newspaper 
aligned with the Syrian government," which reported that Carstens and Patel "met with Ali 
Mamlouk, the head of Syria's intelligence agency, in his office in Damascus." The Post adds that 
Al Watan "said the trip was not the first visit by high-level U.S. diplomats and that three similar 
visits to Damascus have taken place in past years." In addition, "The newspaper stressed that, 
during the August visit, the Syrian government refused to discuss 'kidnapped' Americans and 
sanctions until effective talks on U.S. withdrawal from Syria were underway." 
The New York Times (10/19, Perez-Perla, 18.61M) reports that in 2017, former CIA 
Director Pompeo "called Mr. Mamlouk to open back-channel communications on Mr. Tice. 
Washington then sent an intermediary to see Mr. Mamlouk, the officials said." A year later, the 
CIA "sent a top agency official with expertise in the Middle East to meet Mr. Mamlouk in 
Damascus, where the official raised the case of Mr. Tice." Last year, after President Trump 
"ordered the withdrawal of most of the American troops in Syria," critics "questioned why the 
administration had not demanded anything from Syria in return, like the release of prisoners."
