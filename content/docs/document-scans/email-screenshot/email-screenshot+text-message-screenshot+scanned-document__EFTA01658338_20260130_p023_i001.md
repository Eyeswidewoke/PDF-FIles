Reuters (7/28, Prentice) reports, "The internal watchdog at the U.S. government agency 
responsible for managing COVID-19 emergency loans and grants to small business owners and 
nonprofits said it has found 'strong indicators of widespread potential fraud' in the disaster loan 
program." The Office of the Inspector General at the Small Business Administration (SBA) "said 
it has been 'inundated' with contacts to investigative field offices, receiving complaints of more 
than 5,000 instances of suspected fraud from financial institutions receiving economic injury 
loan deposits through the Economic Injury Disaster Loan and Advance grant programs, 
according to a public memo on Tuesday." SBA inspectors have commenced several probes "into 
reports of suspected fraud in the disaster loan program, the memo from SBA Inspector General 
Hannibal 'Mike' Ware to SBA Administrator Jovita Carranza said." 
The Washington Post (7/28, Gregg, 14.2M) reports the SBA's office of inspector general 
indicated "that it has identified $250 million in taxpayer-subsidized coronavirus loan funds given 
to 'potentially ineligible recipients." The Post adds, "Among the potentially fraudulent 
transactions detailed in the report are $1.9 million in pending SBA transactions made to 
accounts outside the United States, roughly 3,000 'suspicious' transactions worth $73 million 
that were flagged by a banking service provider." A credit union informed the Justice 
Department that of the 60 SBA deposits it received, 59 seemed to be fraudulent. The inspector 
general said, "We are alarmed by these reports, but they are consistent with our investigations, 
which indicate pervasive fraudulent activity." The report included a response from Carranza, 
who "said the findings were 'unexpected' and challenged the contention that the SBA did not 
put appropriate internal controls in place. Said Carranza, "The reality is that SBA has developed 
and implemented a comprehensive, rigorous, end-to-end infrastructure to reduce the risk of 
fraud in the EIDL COVID program." 
The Hill (7/28, Moreno, 2.98M) says, "According to the report, nine financial institutions 
have reported a combined total of $187.3 million in suspected fraudulent transactions through 
the program." 
Meanwhile, the New York Times (7/28, Cowley, 18.61M) says the Economic Injury 
Disaster Loan program "offers eligible companies low-interest loans and small grants." In 
contrast to the Paycheck Protection Program, "the disaster program does not rely on banks to 
vet applicants and issue loans." Ware "recommended 'immediate action and attention' to 
prevent further losses." The Times adds that Ware "identified one especially glaring shortfall: 
The S.B.A. has no formal process for working with financial institutions to review possible fraud 
cases."

Republicans Raise Concerns TikTok Could Be Used By Chinese Government Interfere 
In Elections. 
The Hill (7/28, Miller, 2.98M) reports a group of Republican senators "led by Sen. Tom Cotton 
(R-AR) on Tuesday raised concerns that popular social media app TikTok could be used by the 
Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to spread disinformation around US elections." The lawmakers 
- who also "included Sens. Ted Cruz (R-TX), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Thom 
Tillis (R-NC), Joni Ernst (R-IA) and Rick Scott (R-FL) - wrote to the FBI, the DHS and ODNI 
raising concerns that the app could be used by China to interfere in American elections." Cotton 
and his colleagues wrote, "TikTok has become a popular forum for Americans - particularly 
younger Americans - to engage in political conversations. I'm greatly concerned that the CCP 
could use its control over TikTok to distort or manipulate these conversations to sow discord 
among Americans and to achieve its preferred political outcomes." The Washington Examiner 
(7/28, Neale, 448K) reports the senators "asked each agency what sort of punishment could be 
leveled if the app is used in disinformation campaigns during election cycles." 
Reuters (7/28, Alper) reports a spokesperson for the company "said that TikTok, though 
not a `go-to' for political news, was 'proactively investing to safeguard our app; and taking cues
