The reality is that income inequality has grown drama=ically since the 1970s and that increasing inequality has not been 
matched with growing economic mobility. Instead, the rungs on the ladder of economic advancement are being pulled 
further apart:=in 1970, the upper-class household at the ninety-fifth percentile of income ($122,294 in 2012 constant 
dollars) had an income roughly three times that =f the middle-class household at the fortieth percentile of income 
($37,282 in 2012 constant dollars), but by 2012, the household at the ninety-five percentile ($191,156) received nearly 
five times the income of the fortieth percentile household ($39,674).

Increasing income inequality has contributed to risin= levels of residential segregation by income in large metropolitan 
areas.40=A0 As high-income families share fewer neighborhoods with middle-class and lower-income families, the U.S. 
is characterized by increasingly unequal social contexts that contribute to widening disparities in educational 
achievements by wealth and income.Q=A0 This growing divide presents fundamental obstacles to individuals' efforts to 
realize their full potential, and in tur=, the nation's ability to make the most of the potential human capital of=its 
residents. 
Given the ways in which income inequality and segrega=ion can harm the broader society by denying each individual a 
fair chance to achieve his or her potential, this rise in inequality and the effects on economic mobility are increasingly 
recognized as defining issues for Americ='s future. The Declaration of Independence proclaimed a continuing 
commitment to the ideal of human equality.</=> 
While =his ideal has often been challenged, the most significant social movements and legislative initiatives have sought 
to vindicate the ideal of equality of opportunity and to live up to the promis=s of judgments based on the contents of 
one's character — not=on one's race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, physical abilities or socioeconomic 
backgroun=. As a result we need real/serious policy-based solutions in order to meet the profound challenges of income 
and wealth inequality and growing poverty now facing American society. These sol=tions have to be based on putting 
money in as many American families' hands as possible, and not the =ew at the top no matter how many jobs they claim 
that they can produce. 
Investments to help fight climat= change can also spur economic growth, rather than slow it as widely feared, but time is 
running short for a trillion-dollar shift to transform cities and energy use, an international report said on Tuesday. The 
study, by former heads of government, business leaders, economists and othe= experts, said the next 15 years were 
critical for a bigger shift to clean energies from fossil fuels to combat global warming and cut health bills fr=m pollution. 
"It is possible to tackle climate change and it is possible to have economic growth at the same time," Feli=e Calderon, a 
former Mexican president and head of the Global Commission on t=e Economy and Climate, told a news conference. 
Many governments and businesses wrongly fear that measures to slow climate change will undermine jobs and growth, 
he said. The report is=meant to guide world leaders at a Sept. 23 climate summit hosted by U.N. Secretary-General Ban 
Ki-moon.Q=A0
