Focus 
The limits to monetary policy 
Central banks were seen as saviors during the financial crisis. 
Where does their power end? 
The interaction of power and markets has always been an issue 
for economists. A hundred years ago, for example, they argued 
that, in the long run, wages should be determined by demand 
and supply and not by industrial relations. They realized that 
market distortions could lead to unemployment and falling 
wages. However, Immediately after the financial crisis, more 
hopes than ever before were put on monetary policy since it had 
obviously managed to moderate the effects of the crisis and 
end recession. But it has become more and more apparent that 
money and capital markets react in a similar way to the labor 
market: policy intervention has its limits. 
In 1928, the economist Ludwig von Mises postulated that 
excessive monetary growth led to artificially low interest rates 
and swelling credit' and that part of the borrowed money would 
be misallocated, leading to defaults. In his view, the world 
depression from 1929 to 1933 had been triggered by monetary-
policy mistakes. This train of thought was revived in the wake of 
the financial crisis that started in 2007. 
Most countries had enjoyed a high level of employment and 
price stability before the financial crisis. Central banks were 
therefore surprised by the Lehman default and the resulting 
chain reaction in the financial system. And just like during the 
Asian crisis of 19974998 and the New Economy crisis of 2000, 
central banks in the advanced economies responded to the 
financial crisis with official rata cuts and the provision of liquidity 
for their banking systems. Despite those efforts, their economies 
continued to deteriorate in 2008 and 2009. The belief that 
cyclical downswings and crises could be overcome with the help 
of monetary policy alone suffered a blow. 
Models on trjal 
Some central banks had to fall back on unconventional measures 
such as asset-purchasing programs in order to stabilize the 
situation. The unexpectedness and depth of the crisis triggered 
intense research from 2008 onwards as to whether the central 
banks' economic management models were sufficient. Based on 
these models, central bankers had tried to align the demand and 
supply of goods in times of normal capacity utilization. Pivotal 
targets were therefore full employment and moderate Inflation.

Research on these models' failings soon focused on the capita€ 
markets. In the years up to 2007, credit volumes had increased 
sharply. The money borrowed was invested in properties and 
equities so that asset prices rose accordingly. Market volatility 
was, moreover, reduced during this credit boom as high liquidity 
made investors feel sate. When the financial boom ended 
in 2007, credit defaults triggered additional selling pressure 
resulting in an increased supply of real. estate properties and 
equities, which in its turn sent asset prices further down. 
The result was an additional increase in loan defaults and a 
deepening of the financial crisis. 
New challenge 
Analysis also revealed that the credit market behaves like a 
rubber band: During a credit boom, the volume of credit quickly 
expands while it quickly contracts in times of crisis. It is therefore 
no surprise that the Bank for International Settlements has 
examined potential credit booms and asset-price bubbles in its 
most recent annual report.2 And indeed, warning signals are 
already to be found in several countries. The central banks of 
these countries are now faced with a new challenge: They must 
harmonize the two targets of a balanced economy and avoiding 
a credit boom. But those targets may be corn€iwing. 
So governments will have to take a more prominent role. 
Governments have tended to focus on the management of 
aggregate demand. So they borrowed money to increase 
economic demand. Strengthening the supply-side has proved to 
be a more challenging task for governments in many countries. 
Meanwhile, many politicians have realized that only structural 
reforms will help to further deregulate product and labor markets 
and to promote entrepreneurship and innovation This should 
fosteradditional growth which would, in turn, allow a more 
restrictive monetary policy so that unhealthy credit growth could 
he reined in sooner.
