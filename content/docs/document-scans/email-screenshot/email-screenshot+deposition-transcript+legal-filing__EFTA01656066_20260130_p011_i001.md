A Porn Actress Had Her Photos Used To Extort As Many As 60 Kids On Instagram And Kik 
Forbes (09/17, Brewster) reported that on Tuesday, Instagram announced it was going to set teenager accounts to 
private by default. According to the article, a recent sextortion case on the platform, one of many to have plagued 
Instagram over recent years, highlights why Meta has felt the need to lock down accounts owned by younger users. 
The article added that a Virginia man was charged in May this year with carrying out a sextortion campaign over 
Instagram and Kik Messenger, using a real-life porn actress' photos to trick as many as 60 victims into sharing nude 
images, previously-unreported court records show. Gary Owens Jr. has pleaded not guilty to the charges, which 
allege he grabbed online photos of the porn star, who now lives in Florida, and convinced victims he was a real 
young teenage woman named Jessica Lincon who wanted to engage in a sexual relationship with them. The 
government did not say why Owens was doing it other than to trick victims into producing child sexual abuse 
material (CSAM) for him. The article stated that after the cops searched Owens' iPad, they discovered Google 
searches for the adult entertainment actress and evidence he'd visited porn sites to view images of the porn star, as 
well as hundreds of photos and videos of her undressed or performing sex acts. Investigators also found over 900 
images of "males in some stage of undress or engaged in a sex act," according to a search warrant. The article 
mentioned that the government gathered evidence indicating Owens operated his sextortion campaign from 2021 
through to 2024. In its criminal complaint against the defendant, the government said it had identified 13 minors as 
definitive victims, but said "there are at least 51 additional potential victims that have not yet been fully 
identified." In the search warrant, filed after the complaint, the FBI said it had identified more than 30 minor 
victims and was continuing to investigate. 
Florida Man Downloaded Videos of Child Sexual Abuse Material From Dark Web 
The Herald (09/17, Moore) reported that a Florida man is charged with possession of child sexual abuse material 
after investigators say he downloaded images from the "dark web." Christopher David Clark, 52, is facing charges 
after the FBI searched his home and found an external hard drive with multiple images of child sexual abuse 
material, the United States Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Florida announced Tuesday. The article 
stated that in May, an investigation revealed an internet account that was "part of an online community of 
individuals who regularly send and receive" child sexual abuse materials anonymously on an encrypted dark web 
platform, according to an arrest record. Investigators say the user requested suspected child sexual abuse material 
"on multiple occasions." Investigators say the IP address was connected to a one-bedroom apartment in Bradenton 
where Clark lived alone. When the FBI executed a search warrant on Clark's home, they say agents discovered more 
than 40 electronic devices, including computers, cell phones and external hard drives. A preview of an external 
hard drive revealed multiple images of child sexual abuse material, prosecutors say. 
Update on North Carolina Girl Who Vanished Over Two Decades Ago 
Newsweek (09/17, Sundel) reported that North Carolina officials now believe that Asha Degree, who was 9 years 
old when she went missing over two decades ago, was killed. Degree went missing from her home in Shelby in 
February of 2000. According to the article, investigators with the Cleveland County Sheriff's Office, the North 
Carolina State Bureau of Investigation and the FBI executed search warrants at multiple properties in the county on 
Monday. The article mentioned that a construction crew discovered two sealed black plastic bags along Highway 18 
near Morganton seventeen months after Degree was reported missing. Investigators said the contents of the bags 
included Degree's backpack and clothing. Two of the items in the garbage bags were determined to have 
"evidentiary results" with DNA samples. The DNA connected to two people. The article added that one result was 
Russell Underhill, who died in 2004. The other piece of evidence was a hair stem on Degree's shirt, which 
connected to a daughter of Roy Dedmon. Officials determined that Degree "is a victim of homicide, with her body 
concealed," because no one has had contact with her since her disappearance. The warrant refers to Roy Dedmon 
and wife Connie Dedmon as "suspects." The Dedmons' three daughters were not listed as suspects. The article 
stated that investigators found that Underhill was under the care of Roy Dedmon at the time of the alleged crime.
