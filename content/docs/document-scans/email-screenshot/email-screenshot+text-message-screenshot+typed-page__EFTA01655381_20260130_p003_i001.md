FBI Daily News Briefing 
The New York Times (08/25, Nerkar) reported that Ismael Zambada Garcia, better known as El Mayo and one of the 
founders of the Sinaloa cartel, pleaded guilty in Brooklyn federal court to charges of operating a continuing criminal 
enterprise and racketeering conspiracy. The 75-year-old cartel leader admitted to his decades-long role in 
trafficking cocaine, heroin, and other narcotics across the U.S.-Mexico border, acknowledging the immense harm 
caused by the drug trade. According to the article, Zambada Garcia, who co-founded the Sinaloa cartel alongside 
Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, was arrested in Texas in July 2024 after being lured into a trap by El Chapo's son, 
Joaquin Guzman Lopez. The arrest sparked violent clashes between rival cartel factions—Los Mayos and Los 
Chapitos—prompting Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum to deploy thousands of troops to restore 
order. Associated Press (08/25, Sisak) highlighted that the Trump administration has declared drug cartels to be 
terrorist organizations, positioned military assets off Venezuela, and compelled the Mexican government to hand 
over several dozen high-ranking cartel officials for prosecution. In a DOJ press release, Director Patel 
stated, "Today's plea is a proud moment for the FBI and its partners as the founders of a notoriously violent drug 
trafficking organization, one that engages in an array of illegal activity, including murder and corruption, face the 
consequences of their actions. Our work does not end here. We will continue to relentlessly leverage everything at 
our disposal in our efforts to thwart the Sinaloa Cartel and put an end to their drug trafficking operations and the 
carnage that goes along with it" The FBI, HSI, and DEA investigated the case. Additional reporting was provided

President Trump Threatens New Investigation of Chris Christie Over 'Bridgegate' Scandal 
The Washington Post (08/25, Svitek) reported that President Donald Trump is threatening to launch a new 
investigation into former New Jersey governor Chris Christie over the "Bridgegate" scandal. According to the article, 
the threat came after Christie criticized Trump on television, prompting Trump to suggest that Christie should be 
held accountable for the scandal. Trump claims that Christie "refused to take responsibility" for the actions of his 
aides, who were involved in the 2013 scandal that caused traffic jams on the George Washington Bridge. The New 
York Post (08/25, Crane) detailed that Trump hinted at investigating his former ally-turned-foe for "criminal acts" 
after Christie suggested the president doesn't care about separating himself from federal probes — just days after 
former National Security Adviser John Bolton was targeted in an FBI raid. "I just watched Sloppy Chris Christie be 
interviewed on a ratings-challenged 'News' Show, 'This Week With George Slopadopolus,' on ABC Fake News;' 
Trump wrote on Truth Social late Sunday. "Can anyone believe anything that Sloppy Chris says? Do you remember 
the way he lied about the dangerous and deadly closure of the George Washington Bridge in order to stay out of 
prison, at the same time sacrificing people who worked for him, including a young mother, who spent years trying 
to fight off the vicious charges against her," Trump raged on Truth Social late Sunday. "Chris refused to take 
responsibility for these criminal acts. For the sake of JUSTICE, perhaps we should start looking at that very serious 
situation again? NO ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW!" Trump wrote — the same words Director Patel said after Bolton was 
raided on Friday. Additional reporting on the story was provided by Politico (08/25, Svirnovskiy), CNN (08/25, Reilly, 
Jaramillo, D'Antonio), UPI (08/25, Coote), Los Angeles Magazine (08/25, Su), The Independent (08/25, Liddell),

Continued Reporting: John Bolton Breaks Silence After Home Was Raided by FBI 
Daily Mail (08/25, Lepore) reported that John Bolton's home was raided by the FBI on Friday morning, with over a 
dozen agents searching his house and office. The raid is part of an investigation into Bolton allegedly sending 
private national security documents to his wife and daughter from his work account before he was fired by Donald 
Trump in 2019. Director Patel appeared to publicly address the raid on Friday, posting to X: 'NO ONE is above the 
law... @FBI agents on mission.' Despite the raid, Bolton broke his silence to criticize Trump's policies, particularly 
his recent summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin, in a Monday morning op-ed for the Washington Examiner 
(08/25, Bolton). MSNBC (08/25, Benen) reported that Vice President JD Vance defended the investigation, implying 
that the White House is involved, and stated "we are investigating Ambassador Bolton", raising concerns about the 
administration's potential retribution against a critic. The article added that President Trump stated that he wasn't 
directly responsible for what he described as the FBI's "raid" on Bolton's home and office, but he added, "I could 
know about it. I could be the one starting it. I'm actually the chief law enforcement officer!" Additional reporting on
