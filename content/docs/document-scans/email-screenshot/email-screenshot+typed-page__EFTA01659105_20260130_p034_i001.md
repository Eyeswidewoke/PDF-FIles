"plans to call a special session of the state legislature to pass spending bills that provide relief 
to small businesses impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic." During a press conference Monday, 
Walz said, "It's absolutely critical that we get something quickly to these businesses, we get 
something that makes a material difference to them, and bridge the gap until the federal 
government can do what they need to do: make a substantial impact on the economics and 
well being of Americans." Walz "said he'll unveil his relief package Tuesday." He said it will 
include "sales tax forgiveness for businesses that sell food or beverages and a tax credit for 
food donations available to the hospitality industry." In addition, "assistance will also be 
provided to long-term care facilities and the state's homeless shelters."

Huntington, West Virginia, Mayor Ron Dulaney Jr. (D) of Morgantown, West Virginia, and Mayor 
Greg Fischer (D) of Louisville call for "an ambitious federal response to save our industries and 
communities from destruction: a Marshall Plan for Middle America." They write, "Like postwar

obsolescence of business and government institutions, and the need for upskilling and reskilling 
the workforce."

House Democrats' Disagreement Over Confederate Bases Could Doom Defense Bill. 
Politico (11/23, Caygle, O'Brien, Ferris, 4.29M) reports "an internal fight" has emerged among 
House Democrats "over renaming military bases that honor Confederates" and is "threatening 
to doom the popular bipartisan provision." The "provision in the annual defense policy bill has 
caused a splinter within the Democratic Caucus as lawmakers weigh what's more important -
axing the language and ensuring the $740 billion bill is passed on time, or forcing the issue, all 
but guaranteeing a showdown with Republicans and President Donald Trump, who has 
threatened to veto the bill if it remains." 
Major Trump Donor Received $25M Low-Interest Government-Backed Pandemic Loan. 
The Washington Post (11/23, Frankel, 14.2M) reports, "A company owned by a major donor to 
President Trump that operates auto-title loan stores with names such as LoanStar and 
Moneymax secured a $25 million low-interest loan from a government pandemic aid program, 
using what consumer advocates describe as a loophole to a rule designed to prevent most 
lenders from getting this federal help." This "cash infusion to Wellshire Financial Services - part 
of a multi-state title loan empire run by Atlanta businessman Rod Aycox - came from the 
Federal Reserve's $600 billion Main Street Lending program for small- and medium-size 
businesses."

month...potentially beating a more widely anticipated lawsuit from a different group of states 
led by Texas." The group, which includes Colorado, Iowa, Nebraska, New York, North Carolina, 
Tennessee, and Utah, "is sometimes referred to as the Colorado/Nebraska group and has said it 
planned to combine its case with the federal government's." Reuters says the "people briefed on 
the matter said the Colorado/Nebraska group planned to file their lawsuit around mid-
December, with one of the people saying a filing was expected in federal district court."
