that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes or was in any way compromised." 
McFadden added, "In the last few days, NBC News has spoken to more than a dozen state 
election chiefs across the country, Republicans and Democrats alike, who say there is simply no 
evidence backing up the President's claims of wide scale fraud or even mistakes that would 
change the ultimate outcome." 
Washington Reacts To Possible Ouster Of CISA Director. 
The Washington Post (11/13, Marks, 14.2M) reports that news of CISA Director Christopher 
Krebs "could be ousted in a post-election firing rampage" at DHS "sent shockwaves through 
Washington." Krebs "has been overseeing the largest-ever operation to secure a U.S. 
election...presiding over a 24/7 war room with state and local election officials that launched on 
Election Day and is still operating." The CISA Director "apparently drew the ire of White House 
officials with a rumor control page that knocked back phony claims about election fraud." 
Congressional Cybersecurity Caucus co-founder Rep. Jim Langevin (D-RI) said, "The public 
needs to have accurate information, and when there are rumors and disinformation and 
misinformation we need a trusted source in government to say, 'Yes, this is true' or'No, it 
isn't." Senate Intelligence Committee Vice Chairman Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA) said, "Chris 
Krebs has done a great job protecting our elections. ... There is no possible justification to 
remove him from office." 
Wolf Reportedly Defying Trump's Order To Fire Krebs. The New York Post (11/13, 
Nelson, 4.57M) reports, "Department of Homeland Security acting Secretary Chad Wolf is 
defying President Trump's order to terminate election cybersecurity official Christopher Krebs, 
multiple sources tell The Post." 
Extremists Turn To Fringe Social Networks To Spread Post-Election Disinformation. 
Politico (11/13, Scott, 4.29M) reports that Facebook and Twitter have sought to "squash claims 
from...Trump and others of electoral fraud." However, the companies "are hitting a big obstacle: 
The messages are running wild on smaller fringe networks popular among the far right - then 
boomeranging back onto the mainstream platforms." Politico adds its review of Telegram, 
4Chan, and Parler reveals "extremist groups, white nationalists and conspiracy theorists — some 
claiming ties to QAnon, which alleges a so-called deep-state plot to undermine Trump - have 
taken to encrypted messaging apps and online message boards." Meanwhile, others "promoted 
rumors that WikiLeaks was about to publish evidence of voter fraud, and called on people to 
share it widely across the web." According to Politico, "The fringe forums also have acted as 
staging grounds for coordinated misinformation campaigns targeting the major social networks, 
as well as repositories for extreme content." 
McCabe Says Further Trump-Russia Declassifications "Unflattering" For President. 
The Washington Examiner (11/14, Dunleavy, 448K) reports that former FBI Deputy Director 
Andrew McCabe "seemed to try to warn President Trump off from declassifying further 
information related to the Trump-Russia investigation." He said "there was still secretive 
classified intelligence that could 'risk casting the president in a very negative light." McCabe 
told CNN's Chris Cuomo last week, "It's almost incomprehensible to me that he would want that 
information out. I don't see how he spins it to his advantage, because quite frankly, I don't 
believe it's flattering." Asked if there is more to know about Trump, McCabe said, "the original 
version of that report was classified at the absolute highest level I have ever seen. We're 
talking about top secret, compartmentalized, code word stuff, and it would be tragic to 
American intelligence collection for those sources to be put at risk." Also reporting is the Daily 
Caller (11/14, Ross, 716K).
