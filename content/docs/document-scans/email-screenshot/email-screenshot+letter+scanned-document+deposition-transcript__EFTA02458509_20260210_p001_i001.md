Mechanisms for learning 
Dear Jeffrey, 
thank you for your support and encouragement, even where I fail. 
Sorry for being such an embarrassment today. I will spell out today's =rgument a bit better and cohesive when I get to it. 
Also, I should have =ecognized that the main point I tried to make would trigger Noam (who =as as always very 
generous, patient, kind and humble on the personal =evel, even though he did not feel like conceding anything on the 
=onceptual one). Almost all of Noam's work focused on the idea that =umans have very specific circuits or modules 
(even when most people in =is field began to have other ideas), and his frustration is that it is =o hard to find or explain 
them. 
I found Noam's hypothesis very compelling in the past. I still think =hat the idea that language is somehow a cultural or 
social invention of =ur species is wrong. But I think that there is a chance (we don't know =hat, but it seems to most 
promising hypothesis IMHO) that the =ifference between humans and apes is not a very intricate special =ircuit, but 
genetically simple developmental switches. The =ootstrapping of cognition works layer by layer during the first 20 =ears 
of our life. Each layer takes between a few months and a few years =o train in humans. While a layer is learned, there is 
not much going on =n the higher layers yet, and after the low level learning is finished, =t does not change very much. 
This leads to the characteristic bursts in =hild development, that have famously been described by Piaget. 
The first few layers are simple perceptual stuff, the last ones learn =ocial structure and self-in-society. The switching 
works with something =ike a genetic clock, very slowly in humans, but much more quickly in =ther apes, and very fast in 
small mammals. As a result, human children =ake nine months before their brains are mature enough to crawl, and =ore 
than a year before they can walk. Many African populations are =uite a bit faster. In the US, black children outperform 
white children =n motor development, even in very poor and socially disadvantaged =ouseholds, but they lag behind 
(and never catch up) in cognitive =evelopment even after controlling for family income. 
Gorillas can crawl after 2 months, and build their own nests after 2.5 =ears. They leave their mothers at 3-4 years. 
Human children are pretty =uch useless during the first 10-12 years, but during each phase, their =rains have the 
opportunity to encounter many times as much training =ata as a gorilla brain. Humans are literally smarter on every 
level, =nd because the abilities of the higher levels depend on those of the =ower levels, they can perform abstractions 
that mature gorillas will =ever learn, no matter how much we try to train them. 
The second set of mechanisms is in the motivational system. Motivation =ells the brain what to pay attention to, by 
giving reward and =unishment. If a brain does not get much reward for solving puzzles, the =ndividual will find 
mathematics very boring and won't learn much of it. =f a brain gets lots of rewards for discovering other people's 
=ntentions, it will learn a lot of social cognition. 
Language might be the result of three things that are different in =umans: 
- extended training periods per layer (after the respective layer is =one, it is difficult to learn a new set of phonemes or 
the first =anguage) 
- more layers
