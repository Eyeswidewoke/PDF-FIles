1) not expensive in terms of valuations 
2) favoured by the upper trending of WTI and Brent prices 
3) impacted by better capital discipline (capex) expectations 
Lucas Herrmann, DB research on ROE trend is starting to be more optimistic as well: 
"Central to the deterioration in return on capital at the integrated oils has been the balance sheet 
build of non-productive capital. At the super-majors alone, the addition over a decade of c.5250bn of 
work in progress and exploration assets has proven a material drag on sector profitability clipping an 
estimated 3-4% from reported RoCE. Yet, with 2013 registering the first decline in non-productive capital 
for a decade are there now signs that yet another source of returns drag across the oil sector may be at 
a tipping point? we think so with our analysis suggesting scope for a 10% uplift to reported returns over 
the next five years". 
Interestingly, today also the Lex column in "Oil change, please" is mentioning the need to improve 
capital returns to fill the valuation gap (ENI the company mentioned in the article, also for the new 
management) 
short term it could make sense to play the momentum via relative spread and with outperformance calls 
SXEP vs cyclical sector like chemical sx4P
