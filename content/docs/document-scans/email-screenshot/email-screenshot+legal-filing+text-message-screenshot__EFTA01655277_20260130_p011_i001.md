FBI Impersonator Has Made a Deal With Prosecutors 
Hawaii News Now (07/09, Staff Writer) reported that a Waialua man found with a fake FBI badge and several guns 
has made a deal with federal prosecutors. Keone Toguchi pleaded guilty on Tuesday to possessing an unregistered 
gun silencer. In return, officials dropped two other charges, including one for pretending to be a federal agent. 
Oklahoma Man Charged With Producing, Receiving, and Possessing Child Pornography and Aggravated 
Sexual Abuse 
Hoodline (07/09, Donovan) reported that a Stillwater resident faces multiple federal charges involving child 
pornography and aggravated sexual abuse, as announced by U.S. Attorney Robert J. Troester. Lee Grant Clark, aged 
78, has been indicted on two counts of production of child pornography, alongside individual counts for receipt, 
possession of said material, and the aggravated sexual abuse of minors. Detailed in a press release from the U.S. 
Attorney's Office, the indictment followed an investigation that started with the FBI's scrutiny of a computer user 
soliciting child sexual abuse material (CSAM). A DOJ press release noted that this case is the result of an 
investigation by the FBI Oklahoma City Field Office (Stillwater Resident Agency) and the Stillwater Police 
Department. KOKH (Fox-25) (07/09, Sharfman) also reported on the story. 
Former School Custodian Sentenced for Possessing Child Pornography 
KTVI (Fox-2) (07/09, Schneider) reported that a former Missouri high school custodian was sentenced to federal 
prison Wednesday over possession of child pornography. A federal judge sentenced Bernard Ray Mennemeier, 58, 
of O'Fallon, Missouri, to five years and three months in prison, along with a lifetime of supervised 
release. Investigators say Mennemeier uploaded five videos containing child sexual abuse material to Dropbox, 
triggering an FBI investigation. The FBI conducted a court-approved search of Mennemeier's Dropbox account and 
his home, finding him in possession of child sexual abuse material. Mennemeier pleaded guilty in April to one 
count of possession of child pornography. According to his plea agreement, he admitted messaging someone on 
Twitter who sold him child sexual abuse material "numerous" times. "This case was especially concerning given 
that Bernard Mennemeier was working in a high school at the time he possessed child sexual abuse material," said 
Special Agent in Charge Chris Crocker of the FBI St. Louis Division via a news release. "In addition to spending 63 
months in federal prison, Mennemeier will never be allowed to work around children again because he will have to 
register as a sex offender." 
Mom Tried to Get $400 From Man to Let Him Rape Her Seven-Month-Old Daughter, Police Say 
The Independent (07/09, Cavallier) reported that an Indiana mother has been charged with attempted sex 
trafficking after police say she tried to get $400 from a man in exchange for raping her seven-month-old 
daughter. Morgan Stapp, 32, was arrested on Tuesday at a home in Indianapolis following a months-long 
investigation that stemmed from disturbing messages and photos shared on Snapchat. The FBI launched the 
investigation in November after they received a report from the social media platform that included the messages 
sent by user "morgan-stapp." When Stapp was interviewed by the FBI on November 11, 2024, she reportedly 
claimed that her Snapchat had been "hacked" and that she no longer had access to her "morgan-stapp" account.

Tennessee Resident Sentenced to 30 Months in Federal Prison on Multiple Cyber Stalking Charges 
WZTV (Fox-17) (07/09, Griffin) reported that McKenzie McClure, a 31-year-old Franklin resident, has been 
sentenced to 30 months in prison for cyberstalking 14 victims. The victims included individuals tied to Christ 
Presbyterian Academy (CPA), where McClure made threatening statements and attempted to enter locked 
buildings. After serving her prison term, McClure will serve three years of supervised release with restrictions on 
communication and travel involving CPA and related entities. "McClure's relentless cyberstalking disrupted many 
lives, incited fear, and posed significant risks to the Christ Presbyterian Academy and Christ Presbyterian Church 
community," said Special Agent in Charge Joseph E. Carrico of the FBI Nashville Field Office in the press release. "As 
demonstrated in this case, those who target innocent lives and threaten violence will be held accountable for their 
actions. I hope the victims can find some closure to the nightmares they endured during McClure's reign of 
harassment."
