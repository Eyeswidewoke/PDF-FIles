You may encounter cookies from third parties when using the PayPal Services on websites that we do not control (for 
example, if you view a web page created by a third party or use an application developed by a third party, there may be 
a cookie placed by that web page or application.) 
How we protect and store personal information 
Throughout this policy, we use the term "personal information" to describe information that can be associated with a 
specific person and can be used to identify that person. We do not consider personal information to include information 
that has been anonymized so that it does not identify a specific user. 
We store and process your personal information on our computers in the US and elsewhere in the world where PayPal 
facilities are located, and we protect it by maintaining physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in compliance with 
applicable US federal and state regulations. We use computer safeguards such as firewalls and data encryption, we 
enforce physical access controls to our buildings and files, and we authorize access to personal information only for 
those employees who require it to fulfill their job responsibilities. 
How we use the personal information we collect 
Our primary purpose in collecting personal information is to provide you with a secure, smooth, efficient, and 
customized experience. We may use your personal information to: 
• 
provide the PayPal Services and customer support you request; 
• 
process transactions and send notices about your transactions; 
• 
resolve disputes, collect fees, and troubleshoot problems; 
• 
prevent potentially prohibited or illegal activities, and enforce our User Agreement; 
• 
customize, measure, and improve the PayPal Services and the content and layout of our 
website and applications; 
• 
deliver targeted marketing, service update notices, and promotional offers based on your 
communication preferences; 
• 
compare information for accuracy and verify it with third parties. 
Marketing 
We don't sell or rent your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes without your explicit 
consent. We may combine your information with information we collect from other companies and use it to improve 
and personalize the PayPal Services, content and advertising. If you don't wish to receive marketing communications 
from us or participate in our ad-customization programs, simply indicate your preference by logging into your account 
and going to the Profile subtab under the My Account tab and adjusting your preferences under Account Information, or 
by following the directions provided with the communication or advertisement. 
How we share personal information with other PayPal users 
To process your payments, we may share some of your personal information with the person or company that you are 
paying or that is paying you. Your contact information, date of sign-up, the number of payments you have received from 
verified PayPal users, and whether you have verified control of a bank account are provided to other PayPal users who 
you transact with through PayPal. In addition, this and other information may also be shared with third parties when you 
use these third parties to access the PayPal Services. Unless you have agreed to it, these third parties are not allowed to 
use this information for any purpose other than to enable the PayPal Services. 
If you are buying goods or services and pay through PayPal, we may also provide the seller with your confirmed credit 
card billing address to help complete your transaction with the seller. The seller is not allowed to use this information to 
market their services to you unless you have agreed to it. If an attempt to pay your seller fails, or is later invalidated, we
