says the restaurant industry's return "will serve as a major test of Mr. Biden's goal of bringing 
the country back to some version of normal by this summer." Biden on Wednesday "described 
restaurants as important foundations of their communities and gateways to opportunities that" 
were "more than a major part of our country." Biden said, "They're woven into the fabric of our 
communities." 
Harris Takes Lead On Small Business Outreach As Administration Sells Recovery 
Plans. 
CNBC (5/5, Mui, 7.34M) reports on its website that Vice President Harris is "taking on a lead 
role as an ambassador to small business, particularly in underrepresented communities," as the 
Administration sells President Biden's rescue and recovery plans. Harris "has held events with 
the Black Chamber of Commerce and spoken directly with community lenders who work with 
Native American tribes." In addition, she has "pushed the country's biggest banks to get federal 
relief to the smallest players." 
Harris Focuses On Small Businesses In Visit To Rhode Island. As part of her 
outreach to small businesses, the Vice President visited Rhode Island on Wednesday. WJAR-TV 
Providence, RI (5/5, 157K) reports on its website that the purpose of Harris' visit was to "focus 
on small businesses." Harris, who was accompanied by Commerce Secretary Raimondo, 
"listened to pitches by entrepreneurs at the Social Enterprise Greenhouse, a small business 
incubator with a social impact mission." Harris "spoke about the importance of small 
businesses." She said, "When I think of our small business leaders, I think not only of business 
leaders but civic leaders, community leaders. It is you who are involved and engaged in the 
community, a reflection of the best of the community." The Boston Globe (5/5, 1.04M) says 
Harris told the small-business owners, "Keep doing what you are doing because you are models 
of the best of what we are doing in the country. ... It's about helping people see the 
possibilities." 
Harris and Raimondo later attended a women-led small-business roundtable. The 
Providence (RI) Journal (5/5, 376K) reports that before she introduced the Vice President at the 
roundtable, Raimondo "sounded the alarm on the exodus of women from the workforce during 
the pandemic, calling it 'an emergency." Raimondo said, "Women were clustered in service 
industries, low-wage industries that got hit hardest in the pandemic." Harris "echoed 
Raimondo's remarks, pointing to 'devastation across the board' and emphasizing that women 
were 'among those who suffered the most." The Washington Post (5/5, Wagner, 10.52M) and 
the AP (5/5) provide similar coverage. 
Raimondo Says Infrastructure Bill Has Bipartisan Support. 
Commerce Secretary Raimondo was asked on Bloomberg TVVi (5/5, 3.57M) if she expects the 
President's infrastructure plan to pass. Raimondo said, "I have had numerous conversations 
with people on Capitol Hill, and there is bipartisan support for the bill, maybe not all of the bill 
and all aspects of it, but I think there's a growing recognition that we've kicked the can long 
enough, and...there's a backlog of infrastructure in every state in America, and I think this will 
be the moment. And the President is determined." 
Analysis Concludes White House Underestimated Cost Of Families Plan By $700B. 
Bloomberg (5/5, Dmitrieva, 3.57M) reports that according to a new analysis by the Penn 
Wharton Budget Model, President Biden's American Families Plan "will cost about $700 billion 
more than advertised because the White House underestimated the cost of its child-care and 
education policies." The analysis concludes that "the plan, which includes child tax credits, paid 
leave and tuition-free community college, would boost government spending by $2.5 trillion 
over a decade, compared with the $1.8 trillion estimated by the White House." The analysis also 
"found that the program's tax increases on wealthy households and corporations would raise
