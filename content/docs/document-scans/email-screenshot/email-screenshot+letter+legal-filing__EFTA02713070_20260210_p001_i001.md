One of the first words that I learned when I joined the Media Lab was "=antidisciplinary." It was listed an a requirement 
in an ad seeking ap=licants for a new faculty position. The word defies easy definition. But w=at it means to me is 
someone or something that doesn't fit within trad=tional academic discipline---a field of study with=its own particular 
words, frameworks, and methods. Most academics are judg=d by how many times they have published in prestigious, 
peer-reviewed jour=als. Peer review usually consists of the influential members of your field=reviewing your work and 
deciding whether it is important and unique. This =rchitecture often leads to a dynamic where researchers focus more 
on impre=sing a small number of experts in their own field than on taking the high =isk of an unconventional approach. 
This dynamic reinforces the cliche=of academics—learning more and more about less and less. It causes=a hyper-
specialization where people in different areas have a very difficu=t time collaborating—or even communicating—with 
people in =ifferent fields. For me, antidisciplinary research is akin to mathematicia= Stanislaw Ulam's famous 
observation that the study of non-linear =hysics is like the study of "non-elephant animals." Antidi=ciplinary is all about 
the non-elephant animals. 
The Media Lab focuses on "uniqueness, impact and magic." What our=students and faculty do should be unique. We 
shouldn't be doing so=ething that someone else is doing. If someone else starts doing it, we sho=ld stop. Everything we 
do should have impact. Lastly, things should induce=us to be passionate and should go beyond incremental thinking. 
"Magic=quot; means that we take on projects that inspire us. In theLifelong Kinde=garten group, researchers often 
describe the "Four Ps of Creative Lea=ning" as Projects, Peers, Passion and Play. Play is extremely importa=t for creative 
learning. There is a great deal of research showing that re=ards and pressure can motivate people to "produce," but 
creative=learning and thinking requires the "space" that play creates. Pr=ssure and rewards can often diminish that 
space, and thus, squash creative=thinking. 
The kind of scholars we are looking for at the Media Lab are people who don=#39;t fit in any existing discipline either 
because they are between =94or simply beyond—disciplines. I often say that if you can do wha= you want to do in any 
other lab or department, you should go do it there.=Only come to the Media Lab if there is nowhere else where you 
could do wha= you want to do. We are the home of the misfits—the antidisciplina=ians. 
When I think about the "space" that we've created, I like=to think about a huge piece of paper that represents "all 
science.&qu=t; The disciplines are little black dots on this paper. The massive amount= of white space between the dots 
represent antidisciplinary space. Many pe=ple would like to play in this white space, but there is very little fundi=g for 
this, and it's even harder to get a tenured positions without so=e sort of disciplinary anchor in one of the black dots.
