which would "open the way for the East African country to move toward economic stability, and 
potentially greater democracy, after a generation of oppression." The disparity has also "divided 
Congress and created a rift between the victims and their lawyers as the United States grapples 
with how to correct unequal or discriminatory standards in its legal system." 
Peter Kassig's Family Calls On Trump Administration To Bring ISIS Members To Trial 
In US. 
The Indianapolis Star (7/24, Gerike, 633K) reported the parents of slain Indianapolis 
humanitarian worker Abdul-Rahman (Peter) Kassig "addressed the media Monday, saying their 
'hearts are battered but they will mend." The family of Peter Kassig, "an Indianapolis native 
and aid worker who was beheaded by the Islamic State in 2014, joined three other families 
Thursday in asking the Trump Administration to bring two ISIS members back to the US to 
stand trial." Kassig, who "converted to Islam and went by Abdul-Rahman Kassig at the time of 
his death, was captured in 2013 while doing humanitarian work in the Middle East." British and 
US authorities "say Alexanda Kotey and El Shafee Elsheikh, ISIS members who are part of a 
group nicknamed the 'Beatles,' are responsible for 27 killings, including Kassig's." 
Hezbollah Says All-out War With Israel Unlikely In Coming Months. 
Reuters (7/26, Bassam) reports the deputy leader of Lebanon's powerful Hezbollah movement 
on Sunday "dismissed the prospect of an escalation of violence between the Iran-backed 
movement and Israel despite increased tensions in the last week." Sheikh Naim Qassem said in 
an interview with pro-Damascus television station al Mayadeen, "The atmosphere does not 
indicate a war ... It's unlikely, the atmosphere of war in the next few months." Tensions rose 
"along Israel's frontier with Syria and Lebanon after Lebanon's Hezbollah militia said a fighter 
was killed in an apparent Israeli strike on the edge of Damascus last week." The Israeli military 
has since "boosted its forces on its northern front." An Israeli military spokeswoman "said on 
Sunday that an Israeli drone crashed inside Lebanon during operational activity along the 
border." 
COUNTER-INTELLIGENCE 
Graham: FBI Lied To Congress About Steele Dossier. 
The Daily Caller (7/26, Ross, 716K) reports that on Fox News Sunday Morning Futures (7/26) 
Sunday, Senate Judiciary Chairman Graham "teased the release of evidence showing that the 
FBI 'lied their a$$ off' to Congress regarding the reliability of the Steele dossier, which the 
bureau used as part of its investigation of the Trump campaign." Graham said, "Here is what I 
think I'm going to be able to show to the public. Not only did the FBI lie to the court about the 
reliability about the Steele dossier, they also lied to the Congress. That's a separate crime. ... 
Stay tuned next week, you're going to find that not only did the FBI lie to the FISA court, they 
lied their a$$ off to the Congress." 
The Washington Examiner (7/26, Dunleavy, 448K) quotes Graham as saying, "Not only do 
we now know that the FBI lied to the FISA court about the reliability of dossier, they told the 
court that the subsource was truthful and cooperative and Russian-based - the truth is that the 
subsource was American-based. ... He was an employee of Christopher Steele, who was on the 
payroll of the Democratic Party, and he told Christopher Steele this is all a bunch hearsay. And 
when the FBI understood the dossier was no longer reliable they continued to use it." In a 
separate article, the Washington Examiner (7/25, Chaitin, 448K) reported sources "told the 
outlet that Danchenko agreed to talk to investigators in 2017 about the dossier on the condition 
that the bureau keep his identity secret to protect himself, his sources, family, and friends in 
Russia safe."
