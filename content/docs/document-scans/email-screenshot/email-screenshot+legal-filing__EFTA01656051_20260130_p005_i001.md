FBI Daily News Briefing 
Russian agents to incite political unrest and interfere in U.S. elections. According to the article, prosecutors alleged 
that the group, under the direction of the Russian government, organized protests and engaged in activities, 
including opposition to U.S. policy in Ukraine, to create division within the United States. The article noted that 
defense attorneys argued that the group's actions while aligning with those of a Russian organization, were 
consistent with their long-standing advocacy for Black empowerment and opposition to colonialism, dating back to 
the organization's founding in 1972. A 2023 press release announcing the charges quoted Acting Assistant Director 
Kurt Ronnow of the FBI's Counterintelligence Division: "Today's announcement paints a harrowing picture of 
Russian government actions and the lengths to which the FSB will go to interfere with our elections, sow discord in 
our nation and ultimately recruit U.S citizens to their efforts. All Americans should be deeply concerned by the 
tactics employed by the FSB and remain vigilant to any attempt to undermine our democracy. The FBI remains 
committed to confronting this egregious behavior and ultimately disrupting our adversaries and those who act on 
their behalf." The New York Times (09/03, Mazzei) also reported on the story. 
China-Linked 'Spamouflage' Network Mimics Americans Online to Sway U.S. Political Debate 
The Associated Press (09/03, Klepper) reported that a recent investigation by Graphika, a firm specializing in 
tracking online networks, has revealed a Chinese disinformation group known as "Spamouflage" is creating fake 
social media profiles to manipulate American political discourse. These profiles, often posing as Americans, spread 
divisive content on platforms like X and TikTok, aiming to sow discord among U.S. voters. According to the article, 
intelligence and national security officials have said that Russia, China, and Iran have all mounted online influence 
operations targeting U.S. voters ahead of the November election. Russia remains the top threat, intelligence 
officials say, even as Iran has become more aggressive in recent months, covertly supporting U.S. protests against 
the war in Gaza and attempting to hack into the email systems of the two presidential candidates. The article noted 
that China, however, has taken a more cautious, nuanced approach. Beijing sees little advantage in supporting one 
presidential candidate over the other, intelligence analysts say. Instead, China's disinformation efforts focus on 
campaign issues particularly important to Beijing — such as American policy toward Taiwan — while seeking to 
undermine confidence in elections, voting, and the U.S. in general. "One of the world's largest covert online 
influence operations — an operation run by Chinese state actors — has become more aggressive in its efforts to 
infiltrate and to sway U.S. political conversations ahead of the election," said Jack Stubbs, Graphika's chief 
intelligence officer. The article does not contain a direct FBI mention.

CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS 
Continued Reporting: Trump Assassination Attempt 
Donald Trump Stokes 'Inside Job' Conspiracy Theory Of Assassination Attempt 
The Huffington Post (09/03, Dicker) reported that Donald Trump ran with a podcast host's unfounded speculation 
of an "inside job" behind the attempt on his life recently, saying, "You do have to wonder." According to the article, 
former Fox News personality Monica Crowley, who worked for the Treasury Department during Trump's 
administration, stoked the conspiracy chatter by accusing officials of "slow-walking" the investigation. "Does it look 
increasingly to you like this was a suspicious, maybe even inside job?" she asked the Republican nominee. The 
article stated that Trump suggested without proof that Democrats are paying for the legal fees of the father of the 
dead gunman Thomas Crooks. While the FBI unlocked Crooks' phone fairly easily after his July 13 assassination 
attempt, Trump claimed the FBI couldn't open the apps and that was "suspicious." That piled on to conservatives' 
dubious speculation about Crooks' contacts before July 13. The article mentioned that Trump also said Director 
Wray's early disclosure that the agency wasn't sure if Trump had been hit by shrapnel or a bullet was perhaps a 
sign of something afoot. 
Investigators Vet New Tips After $25,000 Reward Offered for Texas Mom Accused of Murdering 6-Year-Old 
Son 
CBS News (09/03, Vandergriff) reported that investigators are going through new tips in the hopes of finding the 
Everman mother charged with capital murder in the disappearance of her six-year-old son. The FBI announced 
a $25,000 reward for information leading to Cindy Rodriguez Singh's arrest and conviction just five days ago. The 
agency confirmed Tuesday it has received tips since then and will be vetting each one carefully for any information 
that could lead to Singh's location. Everman Police Chief Craig Spencer joined federal and local investigators last 
week to announce the reward. The article noted that the FBI has translated the wanted posters for Singh into
