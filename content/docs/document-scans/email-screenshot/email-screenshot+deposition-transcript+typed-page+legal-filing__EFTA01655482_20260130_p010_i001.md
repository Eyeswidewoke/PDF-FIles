exploitation sting in Battle Ground that resulted in 12 arrests and a 2023-2024 operation that dismantled a drug

House Judiciary Accuses Biden FBI of Retaliating Against Whistleblower 
Just the News (10/27, Severi) reported that the House Judiciary Committee, led by Chairman Jim Jordan, sent a 
letter to Director Patel on Monday, accusing the Biden FBI of retaliating against a whistleblower, Special Agent 
Valentine Fertitta. According to the article, the FBI allegedly used a security-clearance process to investigate 
Fertitta, who blew the whistle on the bureau's misuse of "law-enforcement authorities", and also questioned his 
wife, Emily Fertitta. The article noted that the Judiciary Committee has requested that the FBI provide all 
documents related to the investigation of the Fertitta family by November 10,2025, citing concerns over potential 
violations of whistleblower protections and spousal privilege. "Documents available to the Committee show that 
SecD investigators denied Mrs. Fertitta the right to receive advice from an attorney during her interview and the 
opportunity to review FBI guidelines regarding the interview process beforehand," the letter states.

Conservative Watchdog Sues FBI Over 'Pattern' of Blocking Records Requests 
The Washington Examiner (10/27, Deese) reported that the Oversight Project, a conservative transparency group, 
filed a federal lawsuit accusing the FBI of a long-standing "pattern and practice" of blocking access to public records 
and violating the Freedom of Information Act. According to the article, Oversight Project President Mike Howell 
said, "The FBI's FOIA process is broken. We can't rely on Director Patel finding documents in burn bags and closets 
for lasting transparency," arguing that the bureau's culture of secrecy "has outlasted multiple directors and political 
eras." Vice President of Legal Kyle Brosnan added that "the deep state that's running the FOIA shop is not aligning 
with the transparency of the administration." The article noted that the lawsuit seeks a court order to overhaul the 
FBI's FOIA process, potentially forcing the release of documents related to major controversies, including the 
Russiagate probe, the Mar-a-Lago raid, and Operation Arctic Frost, while Howell warned that "the FBI will also 
never be able to fully investigate itself. Selective transparency is always going to be problematic."
