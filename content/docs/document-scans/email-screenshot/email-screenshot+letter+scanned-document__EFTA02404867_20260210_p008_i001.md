might now have no choice in the matter if things c=ntinue as they have. After all, if we only take his suggestion that 
Assad's forces are killing women and c=ildren in cold blood, then the party understands perfectly well that this =egime 
will also have little regard for sucking its ally into a regional co=flict whose timing, scope, and terrain the party would 
realistically prefer to avoid for now. 
As if this was not enough, Hezbollah also know= that there are a multitude of ways by which Assad and his minions could 
g= about accomplishing this task with relative ease -- not least by pulling Israel and Hezbollah into yet another conflic= 
which both parties ideologically crave and which both will be enormously =ard pressed to limit, given the underlying 
mechanics of the relationship. 
Even so, all may not be lost or given over onl= to even more violence. 
Assad's regime has been significantly weakened=over the past few months, evidently less as a result of any fighting and 
e=ternal intervention than as a result of its own wanton and strategically stupid actions. It may have the upper han=, at 
least for the moment, on the field of battle, but it has done enormou= damage to its moral, ideological, economic, 
political, and diplomatic sta=ding. 
Further, Hamas has abandoned Assad. Russia and=China have at least some limits to their support, even if these are only 
s=owly coming into focus. And Nasrallah, still one of the most popular leaders in the Middle East, is apparently tr=ing to 
grab back some leverage over the pace of events by publically rebuk=ng the regime to stop fanning the violence before 
it's logic overwhelms ev=ryone and Hezbollah is forced, willingly or not, to "resist." Crucially, too, the United States=has 
privately and publically rejected the path of increased militarization=of the Syrian conflict and even signaled a 
willingness to step back from t=e demand Assad himself must go as a precondition for any political process. 
When you add up all of these factors, now migh= be exactly the time to get the severely wounded regime caught up in a 
con=erted international process that begins protecting Syrians while slowly and steadily draining Assad's ability and 
=esire to exercise violence. This may not be an ideal situation since the r=gime's brutality will likely continue and the 
democratic aspirations of Sy=ians will only be met gradually. But the alternative of full-blown civil war, and quite 
possibly a regional=war, would be far worse. 
Hezbollah, for one, now seems ready to succumb=to this logic -- and encourage the regime to bend -- if such a process 
rej=cts the use and encouragement of more direct violence. Without this key proviso, however, Nasrallah will likely find 
hi=self in the distasteful position of going to battle on the side of an ally=that has done so much to undermine the 
party's claim to represent the weak=and the oppressed.
