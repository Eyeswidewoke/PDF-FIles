Atlanta News First (03/04, Quinn) reported that on Tuesday, Special Agent Paul Brown detailed his 
priorities as the new Special Agent in Charge of FBI Atlanta. "I want Georgians to see their FBI," said

assisting with arrests of those in the country illegally. The article quoted Brown, who said, "The additional 
resources we expect to get will most likely come from the Washington region, and that's something that 
Director Patel has been clear about. He wants to put every available resource possible, we still have to 
have a functioning headquarters and there are some capabilities to maintain, but he wants to streamline 
that as much as possible." WSB (ABC-2) (03/04, Staff Writer) also reported on the story.
