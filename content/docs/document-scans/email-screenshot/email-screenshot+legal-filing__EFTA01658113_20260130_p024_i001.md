keep supporting the reactors." The SCANA executives "didn't want anyone outside the company 
to discover the reactors at the V.C. Summer Plant north of Columbia would not be finished by 
the end of 2020, missing a deadline for $1.4 billion in federal tax credits needed to keep the 
$10 billion project from swamping the utility." Following the project's demise, SCANA was 
bought out in 2019 by Dominion Energy, which has "cooperated with all investigations and 
given money back to investors and ratepayers through reduced power rates and rebates." 
Bloomberg Law (7/23, Roth, Subscription Publication, 4K) reports Dominion Energy said in 
a statement on the matter, "Dominion Energy continues to cooperate fully with state and 
federal authorities in this ongoing investigation, pursuant to the terms of the cooperation 
agreement." 
The Charleston (SC) Post and Courier (7/23, Brown, Wilks, 290K) reports that during the 
plea hearing, Byrne "admitted to falsely telling regulators, investors and the public that the 
project was on track in order to win rate hikes on customers and keep the venture going, failing 
to raise alarms about critical flaws that were dooming the expansion effort." 
The Columbia (SC) State (7/23, Monk, 390K) reports that so far, Byrne is "the only former 
SCANA official to be formally charged in the case," but more charges are "expected against 
other former SCANA officials." 
FITSNews (7/23) News Director Mandy Matney says that as part of Byrne's plea 
agreement, the former executive "must cooperate with law enforcement officials and work with 
Dominion Energy on an agreement that 'will provide at least four billion dollars of South 
Carolina ratepayer relief:"

The Arkansas Democrat Gazette (7/23, Oman, 307K) reports, "The Arkansas Department of 
Transportation has recovered all but $316,000 in a fraud that almost cost the agency $2.4 
million, a top department official said Wednesday." According to the Democrat Gazette, "The 
department also has changed its fiscal office's protocols for handling financial arrangements 
with contractors to prevent such an occurrence from happening again, said Randy Ort, the 
agency's deputy director and chief operating officer." Ort "briefed the Arkansas Highway 
Commission on the fallout from a nearly seven-week period in 2016 that began when someone 
purporting to be an employee of a contractor asked to change the bank accounts where money 
that the department owed the contractor was sent. Ort attributed the ability to recover the 
money to the swift action of an agency fiscal official once the fraud was discovered."
