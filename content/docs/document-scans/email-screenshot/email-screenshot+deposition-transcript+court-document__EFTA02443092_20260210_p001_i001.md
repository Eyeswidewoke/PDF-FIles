STUFF from Plantation FL to JEE 
HI.. Big Boy . You forget me so soon.??? 
I thought you were my pal. 
So I hear maybe we'll get to see you some time soon ; TRUE? or whenever . Would like that. 
My Big Guy (BML) 
and I up in North Car. this past 5 days trying to set up the house. 
Seems like it should be more fun yet time consuming and expensive . Wish we could have 
done what Jack did 1-2-3 . 
Bru with Jack for lunch today so thought of it and always , YOU 
But he is for real HAPPY! After the year he's had he deserves it . I'm glad. 
Would like to take the SONY up but I think we need a 46 " or 47" for the first level and even 
Bigger (much) for the DOWN "entertainment center long wall when we have a new budget -
as my husband tells me I've already exceeded mine ! shock. a "shonda" (sp) 
I'm not good at that . You were better ! 
Anyway hoping all getting better for you and that things should look UP. Always on your side. 
!Are you for real OKAY ? 
WE here headed for BIG moments too - think I told you - MY 60 th B. D. June 10th (oy) -
Yes , you'll always be younger . 
OUR ANNIVERSARY as you might remember JUNE 8 th - . Will never forget you for that . ever. 
THIS ONE IS a hard - to - believe , 25 th . 
WOW 
(amazing feat as a matter of fad that deserves celebration and recognition for sure) 
and 
tho poor timing , I'm needing rotator cuff surgery June 17 th (a big ich ) . Very sadly had to 
cancel our special trip to The Cove /Atlantis for just 4 days with our family (they too will 
have to survive but being me ,i was /am, guilty) or had to put off the surgery for another 
month (and I just mentally or painfully , can't - need it over with - hear it's awful but a must-
do). Lot's of re-hab . Like to think by the Fall , and Holidays , I'll be nearly perfect ! 
Maybe will hear from you TODAY - somehow , someway . please . 
I just wasn't blessed with a great spinal section or your brains. 
Trying to look on the brighter side. House occupying my time and brain so , I'll live... hopefully. 
Don't know what to do quickly for Bruce for anniversary but will do - - - 
. Any idea ?? !! 
You would have great idea maybe , but you have all your own things to handle so I wish you 
only the best. 
Will call upon you if desperate , yes ? 
Too long a note for you . Sorry/ . Drop me a "hey" , yes again ? 
your Brooklyn girl; MARSH (ever so much NOT like your other friends or acquaintances) 
Still, and sincerely , 
a Big HUG
