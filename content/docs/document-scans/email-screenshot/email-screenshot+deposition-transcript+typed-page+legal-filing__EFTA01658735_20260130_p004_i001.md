CISA said, "While we know there are many unfounded claims and opportunities for 
misinformation about the process of our elections, we can assure you we have the utmost 
confidence in the security and integrity of our elections, and you should too." The statement 
added, "When you have questions, turn to elections officials as trusted voices as they 
administer elections." It "echoed repeated assertions by election experts and state officials over 
the last week that the election unfolded smoothly without broad irregularities." 
USA Today (11/12, Johnson, 10.31M) reports that the group of agencies, which included 
the National Association of State Election Directors, "issued what appeared to be a definitive 
coda to the 2020 vote." The statement "offered a decidedly different message than that 
delivered last month" by DNI Ratcliffe, "who abruptly announced that that voter registration 
information had been obtained by Iran and Russia in an attempt to undermine confidence in the 
2020 election." Ratcliffe also "said that Russia has obtained voter information just as the 
Kremlin had done in when it interfered in the 2016 election." 
The New York Times (11/12, Sanger, Stevens, Perlroth, 18.61M) reports that the 
statement came "directly from one of Mr. Trump's own cabinet agencies." It "also came as a 
previously unified Republican Party showed signs of cracking on the question of whether to 
keep backing the president." Senate Republicans have "insisted that Mr. Biden should at least 
be given access to the President's Daily Brief," their call amounting "to an acknowledgment that 
Mr. Biden will be declared the victor in the election." Sen. Roy Blunt (R-MO) said, "I think they 
do need to know some things, and national security would be one of them." 
The Washington Post (11/12, Itkowitz, 14.2M) reports that the statement from security 
agencies "comes on the heels of reporting earlier in the day by Reuters that Christopher Krebs, 
the head of the CISA, expected to be fired over his efforts to debunk misinformation about 
voting fraud." Krebs has "retweeted an election law expert who called out Trump for spreading 
misinformation." Center for Election Innovation & Research Executive Director David Becker 
wrote, "Please don't retweet wild and baseless claims about voting machines, even if they're 
made by the president. These fantasies have been debunked many times." 
Axios (11/12, Chen, 521K) reports that the Election Infrastructure Government 
Coordinating Council (GCC) Executive Committee wrote, "There is no evidence that any voting 
system deleted or lost votes, changed votes or was in any way compromised." The statement 
"acknowledged 'opportunities for misinformation' and urged voters to seek out election officials 
as 'trusted voices." 
Reuters (11/12) reports, "The groups, the Election Infrastructure Government 
Coordinating Council Executive Committee (GCC) and the Election Infrastructure Sector 
Coordinating Council (SCC), said the election was the most secure in U.S. history." CISA's 
"Rumor Control" website "debunks misinformation about the election," and CISA Director Krebs 
"has told associates he expects to be fired, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters." 
The Washington Times (11/12, Lovelace, 492K) reports that among the parties issuing the 
statement are "members such as CISA assistant director Bob Kolasky, U.S. Election Assistance 
Commission chair Benjamin Hovland, and National Association of Secretaries of State president 
Maggie Toulouse Oliver, among several others." ,

York Times (1 and 2), Bloomberg (11/13, Sebenius, 4.73M), Axios (11/12, 521K), NPR (11/12, 
Wise, 3.12M), Federal Computer Week (11/12, 263K), and Newsweek (11/12, Grzeszczak,
