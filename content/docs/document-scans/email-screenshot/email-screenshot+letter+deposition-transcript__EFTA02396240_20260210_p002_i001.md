In the 60s in hyde park there was speakers corner, when someone thought the= had something important to say and 
truly blieved they were on the right s=de of history god. the argument, they got on a box , did their thing , and=some in 
the crowd, appluded, slept. walked away, are were inspired to get =n a box next weekend. I personally think the 
performance needs to change t=e lives ,thinkning of some in the crowd. new insights, new illumination. ,=forever 
changed. at least for a week or so. yesterdays, performnace , had =o redeening quality, none. it was joke telling in a 
foreign language. wher= the teller found it hysterical and his audience just stared blankly, even=a bakers hat. key on the 
mayor. a smile on the girlfriends. . it was as a =ehearsal for a recording, suits and ties. a black man singing german out o= 
the side of his mouth , in mimicking porgy and bess. the triangle was the=only alive thing in the hall.

You should not worry about this aspect.Never trust anyone who is not emotio=ally tied to what they have spent their life

music is different--it is a deep experience that exposes v=lnerability in real space and time--one that involves emotional 
risks that=most people do not take, at least for me. There are artists who have detac=ment, for whom making music is 
just a job. It is not that way for me. And = am asking for help on the brink of a great chance to make the kind of 
dif=erence that would have a fighting chance to solve the problem we both see-=so I am anxious. You'll see much 
greater equanimity if I have a fighting c=ance. 
So the problem is mine, and, all things considered, I take criticism well, =s well as anyone can for whom what does is 
more than a game--and I am depe=dent on others even on the stage. So hand out the real opinions, even thou=h I 
cannot promise you lack of comfort. And the hurt passes quickly. My se=ond child was killed when she was 8, so you 
can't really hurt me, so have =o fear. By being brutally honest--using your word--you invoke, in the very=use of language 
an image of harshness and pain. So in some cases expect th= worst. Do not trust anyone who takes it lightly in matters 
of such power.=And of course I am in a position in which I need your trust and support. A=d I am rattled, as well albeit 
temporarily, because I really like and resp=ct you. 
As to Strauss, he just thought he was better than everyone else in the fief= of music and he needed no one. In secret 
however, he took every critic se=iously and suffered with them, even though he never showed it publicly. 
See you this week.

that. I myself prefer brut=l honesty . chats how i learn. otherwise i like you can argue myself into =elieving my own
