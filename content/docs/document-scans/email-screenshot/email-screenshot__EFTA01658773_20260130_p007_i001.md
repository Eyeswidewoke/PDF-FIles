Muhammad by the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo." 
The Washington Post (11/11, McAuley, Fahim, 14.2M) says while "details of the incident 
remain unclear, it follows a knife attack on a security guard at the French Consulate in Jiddah 
late last month after France doubled down on defending caricatures of the prophet Muhammad, 
a stance that triggered protests and boycotts across the Muslim world." 
Islamic State Increases Attacks In Mozambique. 
The New York Times (11/11, Walsh, 18.61M) reports that Islamic State militants "armed with 
machetes" attacked 24 de Marco, a village in northern Mozambique, and "beheaded as many as 
20 boys and men" in early November. The "atrocity...was just one episode in a brutal conflict 
unfolding" in the region as the insurgents have stepped up territory seizures, including the 
capture of the port of Mocimboa de Praia in August, and "brutal attacks on civilians that often 
involve beheadings." The success of the campaign "is also a sign of a worrisome trend" as the 
group's "influence wanes in the Middle East" and surges "in pockets of Africa" beyond 
Mozambique's borders.

Facebook Takes Down Pages Tied To Steve Bannon For Spreading Misinformation. 
The Washington Examiner (11/10, Brest, 448K) reports, "Facebook took down a handful of 
pages tied to Steve Bannon because they were spreading misinformation about the election." 
The pages taken down "had accrued more than 2.4 million followers and pushed the 'Stop the 
steal' motto, which promotes unverified claims of mass voter fraud." A Facebook spokesperson 
said, "We've removed several clusters of activity for using inauthentic behavior tactics to 
artificially boost how many people saw their content." Bannon also was suspended from Twitter 
recently "after he said he'd like to see Dr. Anthony Fauci and FBI Director Christopher Wray 
beheaded during an episode of the podcast War Room: Pandemic." The Hill (11/10, Klar, 2.98M) 
also reports.

legal vote is counted and every illegal vote is disqualified." 
Current, Former DO) Officials Stunned By AG Barr's Memo About Voter Fraud. 
The Washington Post (11/10, Barrett, Zapotosky, 14.2M) reports that current and former DOJ 
officials "said Tuesday they were stunned and frustrated" by AG Barr's "move to loosen internal 
restrictions on how and when federal prosecutors investigate certain election-fraud cases before 
the results are certified." When Barr first proposed the move, "Criminal Division officials -
including political leadership - had pushed back vigorously and thought they had dissuaded the 
attorney general from taking such a step." Richard Pilger, DOJ's head of the department's 
election crimes branch, "told colleagues he was stepping down from that job to a lesser position 
at the department, citing the new guidance, as others privately seethed." DOJ officials have 
"said they were unaware of any such cases amid the myriad allegations raised by the Trump 
campaign and the president's supporters."
