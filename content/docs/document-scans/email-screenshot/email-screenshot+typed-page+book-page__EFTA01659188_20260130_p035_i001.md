government of the left, right and centre 'that will reflect the fact that we don't hate one 
another.' But Lapid, 57, has ruled out serving in a government with Netanyahu, citing the 
criminal indictment against the prime minister." 
Axios (5/5, Ravid, 1.26M) says Rivlin "held consultations with Israel's political 
parties...over the mandate decision, with both the centrist Lapid and right-wing kingmaker 
Naftali Bennett putting themselves forward." Axios adds, "As expected, Rivlin opted to give the 
mandate to Lapid, who has managed to get 56 members of the Knesset to support him so far, 
including the six members of Gideon Sa'ar's breakaway right-wing party." Axios reports that 
Bennett "said he was determined to prevent a fifth election and would thus work to form a unity 
government with Lapid and the center-left." According to Axios, Lapid and Bennett are 
"expected to resume power-sharing negotiations toward a government that would see Bennett 
serve first as prime minister for two years before Lapid rotates into the job." 
The New York Times (5/5, Kingsley, 20.6M) describes Bennett as an "ultranationalist." The 
Times says Bennett is "a former settler leader who opposes Palestinian statehood and seeks to 
annex large parts of the occupied West Bank." According to the Times, Lapid "will need to 
persuade an ideologically incoherent array of other parties to set aside their differences to form 
an alliance of 61 lawmakers, the minimum for a parliamentary majority. Such an alliance might 
have to encompass far-right lawmakers who reject a two-state solution to the Israeli-
Palestinian conflict, left-wing parties that support a two-state solution, Arab nationalists and 
Islamists, none of them natural political bedfellows." 
The Washington Post (5/5, 10.52M) says Lapid "entered politics in 2012, on the heels of 
grass-roots social protests that demanded more government focus on issues of justice, income 
inequality and support for the middle class." The Post adds that "in the past year, Lapid has 
again tried to tap the energy of hundreds of thousands of Israelis who gather in weekly protests 
...calling for an end to state corruption and for Netanyahu to step down." The Post also reports 
that Lapid is "one of the few national politicians willing to express support for a Palestinian 
state." The New York Times (5/5, Kershner, 20.6M) has a profile of Lapid. 
Duckworth Calls For Biden To Pressure Turkey To Stop Attacks On Syrian Kurds. 
Politico (5/5, Seligman, 6.73M) reports, in a letter on Wednesday, Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-
IL) urged President Biden "to increase pressure on Turkey to curb its "malign activities" on the 
Kurdish population in Syria." According to Politico, Duckworth's letter "turns the heat up on 
Biden to take a stronger line on Ankara, even as the US-Turkey relationship sours further over 
the president's decision to recognize the 1915 Armenian massacres as genocide." 
In Video, French Journalist Claims To Be Kidnapped In Mali, Pleads For Rescue. 
The New York Times (5/5, Breeden, 20.6M) reports that Oliver Dubois, a French journalist who 
disappeared in Mali last month, "said in a video that circulated Wednesday on social media, but 
that could not be independently verified, that he had been kidnapped by a jihadist group 
operating in the region as he appealed for help from the authorities in France." The Washington
Post (5/5, 10.52M) reports that Dubois "was kidnapped in the northeastern city of Gao on April 
8 by an al-Qaeda-linked affiliate known as Jamaa Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM), or the 
Support Group for Islam and Muslim."
