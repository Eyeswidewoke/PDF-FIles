Re: URGENT: BuzzFeed News inquiry re allegations of sexual harassment 
Importance: 
High 
I appreciate the opportunity to respond to your email. I am =urrently on a plane until noon pacific time, and then 
heading to a =eeting right after landing, till about 2 pm or so. While I am =unning the risk that you will report my 
comments, if you do, either out =f context, or incompletely, I am responding with an effort to be =omplete, as I always 
try and do with reporters. If you decide to =o ahead with a story, which, after reading my responses, I hope you =ecide 
is inappropriate, I would like you to quote my responses fully in =rder not to distort them. 
It is hard to know how to respond to a =ist of false and/or distorted allegations, along with misleading =tatements. I 
treat people I interact with with respect, and I work hard =o support and mentor students, colleagues, and members of 
the general =ublic, and this is supported by the institutions of which I am a part. =nbsp;I do not sexually harass people. 
If the purpose of your =eporting is to somehow argue that Universities and other institutions =re lax in dealing with well 
known individuals like myself, then in fact =he situation is quite the opposite. My high public profile opens =e up to 
more scrutiny at these institutions, not less, and it also =pens me up to a host of unfounded outside complaints and 
allegations =hat other faculty do not receive, each of which the University has to =espond to. The fact that I have 
remained a professor in all =niversities with which I have been associated, in good standing, and =Iso an officer or an 
invited speaker at organizations like CFI, which =ave strict harassment policies, is a confirmation of the fact that =heir 
experience validates a trust in my behavior. I was asked to =e an honorary director of CFI, and continue to be invited to 
their last = meetings to speak, specifically because, as they have written me after =he fact, the attendees universally 
appreciated my talks, my courtesy, =nd graciousness in spending time with the attendees. If the =urpose of your report 
is to impugn my integrity or suggest I have a =istory of harassment, that too is false. As noted in one of your 
=miscellaneous facts', as a scientist I try and remain =keptical, and rely on empirical evidence, rather than allegations 
and =nnuendo by people whose motives I cannot judge. I also try and =udge the facts in context. The fact that 
Universities and other =rganizations employ me or have me on their boards, or invite me to =eetings is because they 
value my contributions and my =ctions. 
The items you list are false or distorted. Item 1 refers to a =onsensual encounter in my hotel room in 2006 where we 
mutually decided, =n a polite discussion in fact, that taking it any further would not be =ppropriate, and there were 
respectful and platonic encounters =fterwards. There is nothing to comment on in item 3, which involves an =nonymous 
3rd party claim because I know nothing about it, there =re no details provided, and it clearly was not taken seriously 
enough =o result in any university action. Item 4 is confusing. Are =ou saying that because I decided I didn't want to go 
out to a =ar with a group of attendees that I was harassing them? The =econd part did not happen. Re incident 5: The 
'female =ompanion' in this case is my wife, who accompanied me on the =ruise, and has attested to the fact that the 
claim is false. This =s what I wrote at the time in response to the blog in question, causing =t to be taken down. 
It is worth responding to Item 2 =nd 6 in more detail, 
Re item 2: the student in question was interested in =cience communication, and on dozens of occasions came to me, 
asked me =o talk over coffee, or wrote to me with questions. When she asked =bout advice for after graduation I DID 
tell her she was different than =he other students in her year. The rest of them were interested =n going on to graduate 
school in physics, but she was interested in =cience communication so I told her that she might want to take a =ifferent 
path. Since she was the only woman in her year, as I =ecall, I did ask her on one of these occasions if that made it
