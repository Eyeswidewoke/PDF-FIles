We're sorry to hear that you h=ven't considered the trustee candidates we proposed. We do not accept your counte=-
proposal that Max step down and then you choose the new trustee. For one thing, if there is going to be a new trustee, 
it will have to be somebody we are all four comfortable with. 
We will need some time to figure o=t if we still see a viable path toward replacing Max. 
We realize there are a lot of othe= issues you've brought up, some of which involve serious and deep disagr=ements 
between you and us. Unfortunately, our experiences trying to discuss those issues with you have convinced us that we 
can't make any progress by em=il or telephone, so we're not going to respond here. 
Love, Avi, Diane and Harry

Subject: =C24o Re: Fwd: Response to your letter 
Harry Chomsky 
Just back from some days away, includin= a talk in Oakland, at MECA. We spent some time with Amy and Alex, who 
visited us at our hotel. Even went to visit Alex's school.Q=A0 Amy told us that Alex came to the talk and stayed through. 
She said that Harry, Inti and his friend, and some others were there, but I couldn't see anyone in the audience (lights 
were too bright) and no one came up afterwards, a little to my surprise. We spent most of the day at the Oakland 
airport. 
Alex had written to me that Sandi was p=egnant, but I didn't know whether to believe it. Amy confirmed it, and sa=d 
she would have the baby in Japan. Very welcome news. 
About your letter, it's perfectly t=ue that this controversy, which I do not understand, is very painful. And I'd very much 
like to see it resolved. It is the one blight on my current life, and an extremely severe one. 
I'd of course like to end the inter=hange, but it can't really be ended in a satisfactory way by just sweeping the issues --
whatever they are, I don't understand them -- under the rug..C24, I can't help supposing that there is something that 
you are not telling me, and it's important that I know what it is. What you have writ=en can't be the basis for problems, 
whatever they are, for reasons Iv= explained in detail. I've informed you in great detail, and fully accuratel=, about what 
has been going on -- and as I mentioned, there is further seriou= malfeasance that you'll find out about in due course. 
But that is all under control now, and there is no reason that I can see for you to have the concerns that you expressed 
in your previous, as I already explain=d. If there is some other reason, you really should tell me about it. 
One particular matter that I wrote you =bout remains a matter of serious concern to me. I described Max's 
inte=pretation of the marital trust, based on unpleasant legalistic chicanery. To repeat the main points, Eric set up the 
Trust in Mommoy's name for esta=e purposes. Trust law requires that the funds first pass through a Carol Chomsky 
Revocable Trust, then be transferred to the Marital Trust, where, of course, it is intended for the survivor. Seizing on 
this technicality, Max contrived a story about our dividing up our resources, with me responsible for my portion, and 
Carol responsible for her portion and for the children. This mad idea of course never occurred either to us, or to Eric.
