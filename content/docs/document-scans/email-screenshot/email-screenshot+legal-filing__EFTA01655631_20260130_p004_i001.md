the terrorists responsible for the murder of the 13 American soldiers at Abbey Gate during the disastrous

U.S. Lists DOJ, FBI Buildings in Washington for Possible Sale 
The Associated Press (03/04, Colvin, Sisak) reported that the Trump administration has released a list of 
over 440 federal properties targeted for potential sale, including the FBI headquarters and the main 
Department of Justice building. According to the article, the list was later revised to 320 entries, with all 
properties in Washington, D.C. removed, including the J. Edgar Hoover Building and the Robert F. Kennedy 
Department of Justice Building. The goal of selling these properties is to eliminate costly maintenance 
and save taxpayer dollars, with estimated annual savings of over $430 million in operating costs. The 
article explained that several of the buildings on the initial chopping block house agencies that Trump has 
long criticized and targeted, notably the FBI and Justice Department. The FBI and HUD headquarters are 
also prime examples of the brutalist architectural style that Trump has tried for years to eliminate, 
preferring traditional, neo-classical architecture instead. Additional reporting on the story was provided

Trump Administration Expels Senior FBI Officials, Sparks Fears of Wider Purge 
Amid Jan. 6 Inquiry 
The Wall Street Journal (03/04, Gurman, Barber, Viswanatha) reported that the Trump administration has 
ordered the expulsion of senior FBI officials, with over two dozen already pushed out. The expulsions 
target investigators and prosecutors involved in Trump probes, with thousands more potentially at risk of 
being fired, sparking fears of a mass purge. According to the article, Director Patel is expected to shrink 
the bureau's counterintelligence and counterterrorism work, and move agents from securities fraud, 
antitrust violations, and other white-collar cases to pursue drug-trafficking and violent street crime. 
Additionally, the article explained that thousands of FBI agents were ordered to answer a 12-question 
survey about their work on the Jan. 6 riot. Agents paused field work to complete the survey. The central 
question asked, "What was your role in the investigations or prosecutions relating to events that occurred 
at or near the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021." The article highlighted that last Thursday, Director Patel told 
lawmakers at his FBI confirmation that FBI employees would be protected from political 
retribution. "Every FBI employee will be held to the same standard and no one will be terminated for case 
assignments;' he said under oath. On Saturday, the FBI agents association in a note told its members not 
to resign or offer to resign: "While we would never advocate for physical noncompliance, you need to be 
clear your removal is not voluntary." The agents association followed up with another message Sunday, 
telling members to answer the Jan. 6 survey with a response that included the sentence, "I have not been 
advised of my rights in this matter." The article noted that the senior FBI executives given the Justice 
Department ultimatum last week had by the Monday deadline cleared out their offices and turned in 
their badges. Together, they represented close to 200 years of FBI experience. 
'Everything Is on the Table' on DOJ Purge of Trump Haters, AG Pam Bondi Says 
USA TODAY (03/04, Meyer) reported that the DOJ has fired all of Jan. 6 special counsel Jack Smith's staff 
and is working to "root out" anyone at the department and FBI who it believes doesn't like President
