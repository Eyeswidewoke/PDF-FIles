In the sixth season of "Scrubs," the show's creator, Bill L=wrence (also a major fan of musical comedy), decided to do a 
musical episode. It was the first time I had done musical comedy since I was at camp, and it instantly reminded me how 
much I loved it. My favorite song from the episode was called "Guy Love." 
<http://w=w.youtube.com/watch?v=IL4L4Uv5rf0> In it, Donald Faison (my best friend in real life and on the show) and I 
sang about how our homoerotic love for each other was nothing to apologize for. ("It's guy love, that's all it is.")=The 
experience replanted the seed, and I made a promise to myself: One day I would sing on Broadway.

I'd be curled in the fetal position spooning a pillow right now, though, if it weren't for my current director, Susan 
Stroman. Directing and choreographing a musical is the most epic undertaking for one human being, yet Susan (or Stro, 
as the cool Broadway kids call her) handles it with aplomb. 
And she's not just choreographing the actors and dancers, but also the=20 magnificent set designed by Santo Loquasto, 
which moves in ways I didn&rsqu=;t know scenery could move. It's a dance of men and women and machines =nd 
winches and elevators and lights. The wings of the St. James are very narrow, so when a giant piece of scenery 
disappears from the audience&rsquo=s view, the most elaborate game of Tetris begins, as the outstanding stage crew 
turns and lifts and twists; not an inch is wasted. The second the orchestra strikes the first note of the overture, no one 
stops moving until the final curtain hits the deck. 
During "Manhattan Murder Mystery," I had every word of my lines memor=zed down to the punctuation mark. I'll never 
forget: The first thing Woody sa=d to me was, "We're probably not going to say exactly what'= on the page so ... you 
know ... just try to keep up. ..." While we've been =n previews on "Bullets," he and Stro have been giving us notes ea=h 
day on the previous night's performance. One night, I dropped a great joke =y accident. He said to me with a smile, 
"You'll probably get a bi=ger laugh if you actually say it onstage." 
All the people on Broadway are the best at what they do. All dancers want to work with Stro, so she gets the best 
dancers in New York City. Is there an oboist in the orchestra? You can guarantee he's the best obo=st on the island of 
Manhattan. Need to recreate the look of 1929? The six-time Tony winner William Ivey Long is here to design the 
costumes. And the voices! I am in awe. There has yet to be a time when I don't =et goose bumps when Betsy Wolfe, who 
plays my girlfriend, belts out the final notes of our duet, "I Found a New Baby." 
Zach Braff is an actor, writer a=d director. His new film, "Wish I Was Here," opens July 18.
