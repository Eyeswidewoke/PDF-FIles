Virologists Say Unlikely Coronavirus Was Made Or Escaped From Wuhan Lab. In 
an NBC Nightly NewsVi (8/10, story 6, 2:10, Holt, 6.1M) exclusive, Janice Mackey Frayer 
reported on "the high security lab inside the Wuhan Institute, at the center of a political storm 
over how the pandemic started. ... While there's some skepticism regarding the lab's claims, 
five leading virologists familiar with lab protocol told us it was improbable that the virus was 
made or escaped. ... Scrutiny of the lab was fueled by a State Department cable from US 
officials in January 2018 about safety and a shortage of trained staff. Lab officials claim US 
diplomats visited only once in March 2018 and didn't see the high containment labs. The State 
Department declined to clarify." 
Spain Defends Pandemic Response As Case Numbers Overtake Britain. 
Reuters (8/10, Allen) reports Spain "defended its response to the coronavirus pandemic on 
Monday after official data showed the country had overtaken Britain to register the highest total 
number of cases in Western Europe." In a statement, the government said, "Appropriate 
measures are being taken to control the pandemic in coordination" with the regions. Spain's 
government added, "The data shows that we are being very active in tracking and detecting the 
virus." Health ministry data showed 1,486 new cases were diagnosed Monday, "bringing the 
cumulative total to 322,980, compared with 311,641 in Britain." 
Poor Dying In Brazil At Higher Rate Than Wealthy. 
The Washington Post (8/10, McCoy, 14.2M) reports that as the coronavirus has spread across 
Brazil, "the poor are dying at a much higher rate than the wealthy." In Rio de Janeiro, "the rich 
and poor live on top of each other. ... But despite the proximity and intimacy between the 
classes, two people who are the same in every other way — age, sex, health, city — can end up 
having completely different experiences with the virus." The Post attributes the disparities to 
quality of care in the private health system, versus the public health system, "where shortages 
in equipment and personnel can mean the difference between life and death." 
Craft Calls For UN To Extend Iran Arms Embargo. 
UN Ambassador Craft, asked on Fox News The Story (8/10) about US efforts to extend the UN 
arms embargo against Iran, said, "We have a clear choice. There is a choice between the 
number one state sponsor of terrorism or peace and security around the world. The US stands 
very firm. There is only one way and that is the right way. This is not a popularity contest and 
we understand that. We also understand that Russia and China are waiting to be able to sell 
arms to Iran. So if you think about waking up on October 19 and the arms embargo is not 
renewed, China and Russia will be able to sell arms to Iran. Iran will be able to export these 
modernized weapons, these lethal weapons to their terrorist organizations all throughout the 
world. ... We have no other choice than to renew the arms embargo and promote peace and 
security around the world." 
Pakistani Ambassador Not Ruling Out Another War With India Over Kashmir. 
The Washington Times (8/10, Glenn, 492K) reports Pakistan's ambassador to the US on Monday 
would not rule out another war between India and Pakistan after India revoked the special 
status of the disputed Kashmir region. In an interview with The Washington Times, Ambassador 
Asad Majeed Khan "offered a generally pessimistic view of any chance for successfully walking 
back tension between the two nuclear-power neighbors." Said Ambassador Khan, "You have a 
border where you have over 2,000 violations since January. The Line of Control is hot. No one 
can or should rule out the possibility of a larger confrontation."
