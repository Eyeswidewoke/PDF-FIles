New Jersey Lawmakers Could Vote For Early Release Of 20% Of Prison Inmates. 
The New York Times (7/30, Tully, 18.61M) reports "New Jersey lawmakers seemed close to 
supporting legislation on Thursday that could free more than 3,000 prisoners - about 20 
percent of the state's prison population - months before their release dates in response to the 
extraordinary threat posed by the coronavirus in tightly packed correctional facilities." The 
limes adds "inmates who are within a year of completing their state prison sentences would be 
eligible to be released up to eight months early based on credits awarded for time served 
during the pandemic." The measure, "which the American Civil Liberties Union believes to be 
the first legislative initiative of its kind in the United States, would not permit the release of 
most sex offenders, but would apply to inmates sentenced for other violent crimes, including 
murder."

Accessing Unclassified Data Poses Remote-Work Challenges For FBI. 
FedScoop (7/30, Nyczepir) reports, "The coronavirus pandemic is forcing the FBI to rethink how 
it organizes its unclassified data, with the goal of making more of it available through remote 
access in the cloud." FedScoop adds, "The challenge is that a lot of unclassified data resides on 
FBI legacy systems that otherwise are not available remotely, said Gurvais Griss, assistant 
director of the Science and Technology Branch at the FBI Laboratory. With much of its 
workforce online from home, the bureau now wants confidential, secret and top secret networks 
`appropriately' integrated with a cloud platform so 'relevant' intelligence within them can be 
shared more easily, he said. The job involves tagging, flagging and moving the unclassified data 
to a lower-classification environment, Griss said during an Armed Forces Communications and 
Electronics Association, Bethesda forum Thursday." 
Cohen Free To Publish Anti-Trump Book While Serving Sentence At Home. 
The AP (7/30, Neumeister) reports, "The US government dropped its effort to silence President 
Donald Trump's former personal lawyer on Thursday, saying it will no longer demand that 
Michael Cohen not speak with the media in the weeks before his book critical of his former boss 
is released." The AP adds "an agreement between lawyers for the government and Cohen 
attorney Danya Perry lifting the media ban that had prevented Cohen from speaking publicly 
awaited a signature by a federal judge." Cohen "was released from prison in May amid 
coronavirus fears in U.S. prisons, only to be returned earlier this month after making it known 
that he planned to publish" the book. 
Reuters (7/30, Freifeld) reports that "federal authorities returned him to prison on July 9, 
one week after Cohen tweeted he was close to finishing his book, when Cohen questioned their 
new requirement that he agree to steer clear of media." A federal judge subsequently ruled that 
"the return to prison amounted to government retaliation against Cohen's desire to exercise his 
First Amendment rights," and "gave both sides a week to negotiate a media provision that is 
'consistent with the First Amendment but yet serves the purposes of confinement." The New 
York Times (7/30, Weiser, 18.61M), New York Post (7/30, Feuerherd, 4.57M) and New York 
Daily News (7/30, Sommerfeldt, 2.52M), among other outlets, also report the story.
