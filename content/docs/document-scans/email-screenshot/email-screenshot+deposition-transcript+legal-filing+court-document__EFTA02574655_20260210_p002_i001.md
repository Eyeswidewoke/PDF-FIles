a memo for you outlin=ng your options in light of the trust terms. I anticipate being able=to spend some time on this 
over the weekend, along with reviewing the draf=s of your estate planning documents. Once I have sent the memo to 
yo= we can discuss your thoughts and we can then respond to Max. Unfortunatel= this is a difficult situation, not simple 
and straightforward, because of=the terms of the trust and fiduciary law applicable to trusts. Pleas= see my email of 
10/17 for an explanation of some of the issues. 
> In some situations a trust is drafted so that you would have the right=to remove and replace the trustee, and in doing 
so perhaps find a trustee =hat would not inquire so diligently as to your personal financial circumst=nces before making 
a principal distribution to you. In this regard, =lease refer to my email of 10/17 where I summarize the trustee removal, 
re=ignation and appointment provisions. The trustees can both resign at any t=me. They appoint successors subject to 
your approval. If they agree to res=gn you can find a new independent trustee whom they can appoint. If not, y=u can 
remove them but only with the approval of a majority of your childre=. Do you think your daughters would agree to 
remove Max and Harry? If so y=u could then appoint a successor. You would need to find an independent tr=stee. I can 
help you craft a letter to your daughters if you think t=ey might agree to do this. 
> My one additional thought right now that I need to review more closely=is that Harry, not being the independent 
trustee, should not have a say in=the distribution decision. If there is nothing in the trust to contradict =his 
interpretation (I need to review the trust again) then Max alone has t=e power. However this would likely not change 
the analysis that Max believ=s he needs to go through since he is accountable to all beneficiaries..=A0 He believes he 
needs some level of financial information from you but i= my view that does not need to be detailed. I can discuss with 
him w=at level of detail would satisfy him; however, if my understanding is corr=ct that you do not wish to provide him 
with any backup for his distributio= decision, then we should evaluate the removal option and any other strate=ies I may 
be able to come up with. 
> Unfortunately this is not a simple situation and I will do my best to =utline some additional options for you. In the 
meantime please let me know=your thoughts regarding the above. I am available for a call as well= at your 
convenience.
