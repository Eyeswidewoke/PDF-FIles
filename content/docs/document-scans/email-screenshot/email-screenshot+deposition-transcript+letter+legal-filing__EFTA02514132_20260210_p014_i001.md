possible lifelong needs. Nothing in the long and detailed letters you've s=nt us can begin to explain why your personal 
spending has shot up the way it has. We can see only little pieces of your situation, because of the secretive posture 
you've adopted in recent years, but the pieces we do see suggest a set of problems very different from the ones you've 
descr=bed. 
We hope this helps to explain our position and our real concern. You are right that in our last emails (and in this one) we 
haven't gone point b= point through your affirmations, explaining our different understanding of the basic facts, but as 
we said at the beginning of this email, we tried to do that in the past and it didn't work. We truly hope we can find a way 
to talk openly about the situation. 
Love, Avi, Diane and Harry

I just don't understand this. I've explained the facts in det=il, repeatedly, with no response. You've told me that you 
have a diff=rent understanding of the basic facts, but haven't told me what it is, or wh=t are the questions to which you 
want answers other than what I have told you. That is why communication cannot proceed. So, yes, frustra=ing. 
Evidently you regard this as an adversarial proceeding, requiring a mediato=. I don't understand this either. I thought 
we were a family discus=ing matters relating to us. I have no idea what a mediator would before.=C2. Mediating 
what? Another reason for my frustration. 
As for Bainco and Max, I have explained in part what they have been doing, causing me plenty of harm. In part. As I've 
told you, there is a lot more. But what I have told you is more than enough to explain that they are not reliable sources 
who can be trusted. 
If you want them to answer your questions, OK, but it would seem rather strange if I were to ask them about your 
financial affairs -- a matter into which I've of course never inquired, except by asking you question= if they came up. So I 
find all of this quite strange. If I have questions about your lives and circumstances, I would ask you, not some 
investment firm or lawyer, and I wouldn't request a mediator.Q=A0 I don't understand why it is different in my case, 
and this is somethin= else I'd like to know the explanation for. 
So, yes, frustrating. For these reasons.

Dear Doddoy, 
We have tried to discuss this with you but we have been frustrated—=nd even frightened—by the results. That's why 
wei>=99ve asked you if we could meet with a mediator who could facilitate the discussion and make sure that we are 
able to actually hear each other. We would still like to do this if you are willing. Because some of the disagreements 
seem to be about basic facts—which could be clarified by outside so=rces—we have also asked if these outside sources
