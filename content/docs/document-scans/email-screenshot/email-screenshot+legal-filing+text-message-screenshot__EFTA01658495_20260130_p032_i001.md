Mnuchin said on Fox Business' Lou Dobbs Tonight (9/30, 49K), "I did have a productive 
meeting with the Speaker [Wednesday]. ... I went through a very detailed proposal that I had 
just come from the Oval Office and reviewed with Mark Meadows and the President, so all three 
of us were very clear on what we wanted to do. I think it was a very fair proposal that provides 
a lot of relief for hardworking Americans that have been hurt by this virus, particularly many of 
the small businesses, kids, and jobs that are impacted by this." Mnuchin added, "This is the first 
time we've seriously reengaged in what has been several weeks. ... If there's a fair 
compromise, we're prepared to do it." 
Reuters (9/30, Lawder, Cornwell) reports Mnuchin "said talks with...Pelosi made progress" 
but adds that Pelosi "avoided use of the term 'progress:" CQ Roll Call (9/30, Lerman, 154K) 
describes Pelosi's statement as "more circumspect." Bloomberg (9/30, Wasson, House, 4.73M) 
reports Pelosi's statement "said she and Mnuchin were seeking some 'further clarification' on 
each others' positions and that 'our conversations will continue." 
Senate Majority Leader McConnell was more pessimistic about the prospects for an 
agreement. The Washington Post (9/30, Werner, Stein, 14.2M) reports he said the sides were 
"very, very far apart." The Post says his comments left it "uncertain whether any agreement 
struck by Pelosi and Mnuchin could even pass muster with Senate Republicans." USA Today 
(9/30, Wu, 10.31M) quotes McConnell as saying, "I mean we had 52 out of 53 republicans 
willing to spend roughly a half a trillion dollars. ... The thought that Senate Republicans would 
go up to 2.2 trillion is outlandish." 
The Washington Times (9/30, Munoz, 492K) says McConnell "dismiss[ed]" House 
Democrats' measure as "unserious." He said, "House Democrats are trying to save face by 
introducing yet another multi-trillion-dollar far-left wish list with virtually all the same non-
COVID-related poison-pills as their last unserious bill. ... If they continue to refuse to get 
serious then American families will continue to hurt." 
Rubio: More Aid For Small Businesses Needed Immediately. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-
FL) said on Fox News' Fox & Friends (9/30, 831K), the Paycheck Protection Program has 
"helped...millions of people keep their jobs and hundreds of thousands of small businesses stay 
afloat. And we are working to do that again. We need to do that again. ... I feel a little bit more 
optimistic about it simply because I know Secretary Mnuchin has been talking to Speaker Pelosi 
over in the House about what they are going to do. ... I don't think there is any issue getting 
PPP passed. I think the issue is they want it to be part of a bill that has other things, and its the 
other things there is no agreement on. But we can't wait until November." 
Senate Approves Stopgap Spending Bill. 
The New York Times (9/30, Cochrane, 18.61M) reports the Senate on Wednesday 
"overwhelmingly approved" a stopgap measure "to keep the government funded through early 
December, punting the threat of a government shutdown and a series of thorny debates about 
federal funding until after the general election." The Senate "passed the measure 84 to 10, with 
only Republicans voting against the legislation." Politico (9/30, Emma, 4.29M) says passage of 
the measure "prevent[ed) an unlikely but potentially disastrous scenario that would kneecap 
federal agencies in the weeks before the presidential election." 
Wheeler Defends EPA Regulations During COVID. 
Asked on WRFH Radio (9/30) about the EPA's regulatory actions during the coronavirus 
pandemic, EPA Administrator Wheeler said, "It would have been irresponsible, I believe, to 
require employees to go into a closed facility to fill out reports, saying there are zero emissions 
to send to us. ... Facilities were very appreciative of that across the board and, you know, it's 
important for them to get back up and running, get their workforce, make sure that everybody 
is safe and healthy, get production going to make products for the American people and for 
export, and we didn't want to be an impediment to that happening and we weren't."
