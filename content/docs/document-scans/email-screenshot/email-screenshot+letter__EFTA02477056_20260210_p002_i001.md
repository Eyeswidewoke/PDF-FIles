savings was just accomplished. though you left the 30 million outstanding that I had said should only be done" if" that 
was my=20 additional fee. not used for non biz purposes and not art 
in June and then again Sept, we both agreed to a=50% of phaidon payout first projected at 20 . but less when artspace 
and debt taken out, = then only after weeks, when you delayed any detailed discussion of money wanting to give the 
issue a thoughtful resp=nse ( which I fully understand ) . you unilaterally changed our agreement. . 5m would be 
reserved for the future ? . and out of=the remaining 15m ,? i would receive only a third. ( note : Imrconfident that 
both the debt , and the art space investment will also lead to a write- off of another 30 m. plu= ) In my dining room 
,you were surprised when I said that i require most=20 people to pay their advisory fee up front so that I am assured 
=hat I will be properly compensated for my work when strategies are implemented . you may recall that you appeared 
offended a=d said " are you suggesting that i would go back on my word " I said no = of course not ! you are my 
closest of friends ,but my experience is that=C2 when amounts get large, people tend to get unhappy when it actually 
comes time for them to pay. 
I include b=low the email i sent to you on April 15, the day i was examining your returns =AO It laid out my 
understanding of the compensation agreed for a transaction of the magnitud= to the penny of the one just completed.ie 
<http://completed.ie> 600m 
When it appeared that the transc=tion would and could go foward I was the first to 
point out that our agreement would cost you too much mone=, therefore 
From day one I proposed to discount our =greement to a 50 - 60 million range. An extremely =fair price for all the 
transactions just completed . including=Phaidon. - I was never =old that this was out of range. in fact, alternative 
methods of payment . ie my p=ane, or an -in-kind payment were discussed ( ie =20 including keeping the 30m portion 
of the fee outstanding till M=rch ) ,I provided , only because you specifically requested a detailed =C2 step by step 
execution plan and reviewed all documents that i was given access to.=( Phaidon was never forthcoming ) =AO in order 
to make my many corrections . ( as i said more needed on=phaidon ) . I was then told that Alans<=span> involvement 
warranted a discount . Even in the best of l=ght , though it is beyond question that not one time in the three ye=rs of 
his retainer has he ever proposed a unique idea. (includin= any way to deal with the use issue on debras death ,or 
even the most basic review of your =argest asset by far , the BRH agreement. ) O.K. - lets say he made a contribution to 
the pla= and stretch reality beyond the pale and say it was 50 %. though no =ne could posit such a large amount unless 
they were wearing a clow= suit. , the payment and our formula of 37 percent associated with=C2 the deal was known . 
It had both sent in writing and spoken about on the phone numerous times, a detailed execution plan was provided . 
then an= only then, after the entire transaction was laid out for the group to follow =AO You told me that after a 
number of conversations with brad karp that a total of only 20m would be paid , (and even that was more tha= you 
originally contemplated ) for both transactions . Leon I feel =AO It was remarkably unfair. Did brad even knew of our 
prior agreements.? ?, I would ask that you I and Brad karp sit together if you think it would be helpful.. I would like to 
sen= him this email, with your consent of course. If the transactio=s were never consummated , i would not be owed a 
dime, however , the expect=d fee was known up front. , the detailed step by step plan was frllowed and overseen by 
me, the amount that I had requested before the transaction had even begun, had already been heavily discounted= 
out of friendship, . I believe the decision re only paying 20 m has frankly , left me felling quite une=sy. and colors the 
view about the Athene or Rothschild transaction. 
email from apr=I 15
