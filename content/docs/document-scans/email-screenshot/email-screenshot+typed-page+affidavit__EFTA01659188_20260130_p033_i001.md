Reuters (5/5, Hesson, Spetalnick) reports that, according to Ricardo Zuniga, a special envoy 
who is President Biden's "point man for Central America's Northern Triangle," the Administration 
is planning "to release...a list of corrupt Central American officials who may be subject to 
sanctions." Reuters continues that "US officials see corruption as one of the main drivers for the 
flow of migrants - along with poverty, gang violence and the fallout from hurricanes last year -
and want to make sure a $4 billion aid package being put together for the region does not fall 
prey to graft." 
Colombian Police Lead Forceful Crackdown On Protests. 
The New York Times (5/5, Turkewitz, Villamil, 20.6M) reports that "Colombians demonstrating 
over the past week against the poverty and inequality that have worsened the lives of millions 
since the Covid-19 pandemic began have been met with a powerful crackdown by their 
government, which has responded to the protests with the same militarized police force it often 
uses against rebel fighters and organized crime." According to the Times, "experts say" the 
events in Colombia "could presage unrest across Latin America, where several countries face 
the same combustible mix of an unrelenting pandemic, growing hardship and plummeting 
government revenue." 
Afghan Militants Kill Four Pakistani Soldiers In Ambush. 
Reuters (5/5) reports that "four Pakistani soldiers were killed and six wounded in an ambush by 
militants from Afghanistan along the border between the two countries on Wednesday." 
According to Reuters, the Tehrik-e-Taliban, "a banned militant outfit operating along the border," 
claimed responsibility for the attack the same day. 
In Ukraine, Blinken To Offer Support Against Russia, Pressure On Graft Issues. 
The New York Times (5/5, Crowley, Kramer, 20.6M) reports that when Secretary of State 
Blinken travels to the Ukraine on Thursday, "his task...will be to reassure" President Volodymyr 
Zelensky of "American support against Russia's ongoing aggression." But, the Times adds, "at 
the same time, Blinken will also renew American calls for change in Ukraine's notoriously 
corrupt political system" - an issue that "acquired new urgency after Ukraine's government last 
month ousted the head of the country's national energy company in a move" the State 
Department has "condemned." 
The AP (5/5) reports that Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Victoria Nuland will 
accompany Blinken on the trip. According to the AP, Nuland's mere presence in the Ukraine "is 
likely to irritate Russia," since, as "a Russia hawk," she is "reviled by the Kremlin." Reuters (5/5, 
Williams, Zinets) quotes the Ukrainian Deputy Foreign Minister Yevhenii Yenin as saying of the 
trip, "We see this visit as a signal of extremely strong support from the United States in 
countering Russian hybrid aggression." 
Russian Troops Remain At Ukrainian Border Amid NATO Exercises. The Wall 
Street Journal (5/5, Marson, Mauldin, Subscription Publication, 8.41M) reports that, despite 
announcing last month that it would withdraw forces from the Ukrainian border, Moscow has 
maintained a strong military presence in the area. The New York Times (5/5, Cooper, Barnes, 
20.6M) reports that "Senior Defense Department officials said that close to 80,000 Russian 
troops remained near various strips" of the Russian-Ukrainian border - "still the biggest force 
Russia has amassed there since Moscow annexed Crimea in 2014." 
Political Aides Struggle To Find Suitable Location For Biden-Putin Summit. 
Politico (5/5, Toosi, 6.73M) reports that as President Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin 
"prepare for a potential face-to-face meeting, their aides are trying to nail down the best 
location for what could prove a tense affair. They already have offers from several other 
countries eager to host. But they're finding that - for reasons ranging from recent wars to the 
jaw-dropping performance of a certain former U.S. president - there are few ideal options."
