California Bar Owner Arrested For Selling Bogus COVID-19 Vaccine Cards. 
McClatchy (5/5, Capron, 29K) reports Todd Anderson, owner of the Old Corner Saloon in 
Clements, California, "was arrested after officials said he sold fake C0VID-19 vaccine cards 
from his business." Anderson "was arrested Tuesday after undercover agents bought bogus 
coronavirus vaccination cards from the bar." Since having the cards could be necessary for 
travel or other purposes in the coming months, "it's become a growing trend to buy or sell fake 
cards. The FBI has said that's illegal." 
ABC News (5/5, 2.44M) reports the bar owner "was arrested this week for making fake 
IDs that had nothing to do with drinking," saying the California Department of Alcoholic 
Beverage Control "announced on Wednesday that it arrested the owner of the Old Corner 
Saloon in Clements, California, allegedly for selling fraudulent C0VID-19 vaccination cards." The 
agency launched an undercover investigation on a tip that Anderson "was making and selling 
the cards at his bar." In March, the FBI released a statement saying, "By misrepresenting 
yourself as vaccinated when entering schools, mass transit, workplaces, gyms or places of 
worship, you put yourself and others around you at risk of contracting C0VID-19."

murder." Barry Morphew was arrested "and charged with murder, tampering with physical 
evidence and attempting to influence a public servant, authorities said." Though Suzanne 
Morphew's body has yet to be found, Spezze said, "our belief is that Suzanne is not alive at this 
time." 
Fox News (5/5, Pagones, 23.99M) reports Spezze "thanked the FBI, Colorado's Bureau of 
Investigation and the office of 11th Judicial District Attorney Linda Stanley for their roles in 
breaking the case almost a full year after Morphew's disappearance. ... Stanley said the 
investigation remained active and that the missing woman's remains have still not been found."

The Providence (RI) Journal (5/5, 376K) reports on the "corruption and fraud trial against" 
former Fall River, Massachusetts, Mayor Jasiel Correia II Tuesday, "with a focus on allegations 
that the former Fall River mayor extorted hundreds of thousands of dollars from marjivana 
companies. The day was capped by stunning testimony from" alleged co-conspirator Hildegar 
Camara, who "testified that though he arranged the terms of a $250,000 bribe for David 
Brayton, he became concerned around the time co-conspirator Tony Costa placed a bribe from

brought it to his basement, where Correia was sitting, and opened it to see a stack of bills 
totaling $50,000."

In a column in the Long Beach  (CA) Press-Telegram (5/4, 121K), Susan Shelley writes, "As the 
FBI's investigation into public corruption at Los Angeles City Hall drags into another year, the 
really astonishing revelation so far is how much of the corruption is allowed by law," citing a 
recent Los Angeles Times article describing "what the U.S. attorney's office is calling 'indirect 
bribes." Prosecutors say former Deputy Mayor Raymond Chan "made some arrangements that 
benefited close family members of city employees and officials who had a hand in the approval 
process for the developers' projects. ... Chan's attorney, Harland Braun, says his client's
