OTHER FBI NEWS 
Former President Biden Covered up Ukrainian Complaints of Corruption 'Double Standard,' Secret CIA 
Files Reveal 
New York Post (10/07, Devine) reported newly declassified FBI source files released last month reportedly allege 
that two CIA officers pressured former Ukrainian Prosecutor General Yuriy Lutsenko to halt an investigation into 
Burisma founder Mykola Zlochevslcy because he was "protected by the U.S. According to the article, the files also 
reveal that Ukrainian officials were frustrated by then—Vice President Joe Biden's 2015 visit to Kyiv, where he 
condemned corruption despite his family's financial ties to Burisma, the energy company under scrutiny for alleged 
misconduct. According to the report, a CIA assessment documenting Ukrainian officials' complaints was suppressed 
at the request of Biden's national security adviser, Colin Kahl, and excluded from the Presidential Daily Brief. The 
article noted that a senior CIA official called the suppression "extremely rare and unusual," stating that it was 
"inappropriate to go outside of the intelligence community and inquire with the White House on the dissemination 
of a particular report for what appears to be political reasons." Career CIA analysts later concluded that the report 
contained intelligence of value and should have been shared with appropriate U.S. government officials, describing 
the decision to withhold it as highly irregular and politically motivated. Additional reporting was provided by Fox 
News (10/07, Singman), Daily Mail UK (10/07, Raasch), and National Review (10/07, Lynch).
