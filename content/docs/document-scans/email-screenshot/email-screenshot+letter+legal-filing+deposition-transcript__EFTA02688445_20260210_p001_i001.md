"HeadCon '14: WHAT'S NEW IN SOCIAL SCIENCE?' 
> 
A year ago, on the weekend after Labor Day, EDGE ran a rehearsal, or dry =un, towards a possible annual event which 
would be an EDGE weekend =eminar at Eastover Farm focusing on the state of the art of what the social sciences have 
to tell us about human nature. For want of =omething more serious, we called it "THE HEAD CONFERENCE", =hich 
morphed into "HEADCON 2013: WHAT'S NEW IN THE =OCTAL SCIENCES". The ten speakers were Sendhil Mullainathan, 
June =ruber, Fiery Cushman, Rob Kurzban, Nicholas Christakis, Joshua Greene, =aurie Santos, Joshua Knobe, David 
Pizarro, Daniel C. Dennett. Also =articipating as kibitzers were Daniel Kahneman, Anne Treisman, and =ennifer Jacquet. 
We asked to them consider the following questions in a =alf hour talk, with the expectation that they would be 
challenged in a =alf hour discussion period: 
"WHAT'S NEW IN YOUR FIELD OF SOCIAL SCIENCE IN THE LAST YEAR OR TWO, AND =HY SHOULD WE CARE?" "WHY DO 
WE WANT OR NEED TO KNOW ABOUT IT?" =HOW DOES IT CHANGE OUR VIEW OF HUMAN NATURE?" 
We also asked the speakers to focus broadly and address the major =evelopments in their field (including but not limited 
to their own =esearch agenda). The goal: to get new, fresh, and original up-to-date =field reports on different areas of 
social science. We asked for, and =he speakers delivered, new, fresh, and original talks: an up-to-date =field report on 
their area of social science — conversational =alks: "new, true, important, and well said", and NOT canned =ower-Point 
or slide-driven conference talks, or material they had =reviously presented. (In fact, power-point, slides, and other such 
=isual aids were, and are, off-limits at EDGE events). 
HeadCon '13: WHAT'S NEW IN SOCIAL SCIENCE was also an experiment in =nline video designed to capture the dynamic 
of an EDGE seminar, =ocusing on the interaction of ideas, and of people. The documentary =ilm-maker Jason Wishnow, 
the pioneer of "TED Talks" during his tenure =s director of film and video at TED (2006-2012), helped us develop this =ew 
iteration of Edge Video, filming the ten sessions in split-screen =ith five cameras, presenting each speaker and the 
surrounding =articipants from multiple simultaneous camera perspectives. 
The event consisted of a dinner Friday night, followed by an all-day =ession Saturday at the Farm for a series of talks. We 
wrapped up with =n early dinner at a restaurant ending 8-8:30pm. The participants stayed =t a nearby conference hotel. 
EDGE picked up transportation expenses =air, train, car rental) and hotel room charges. 
We published the program in its entirety on EDGE - nearly six hours of =dge Video and a downloadable PDF of the 
58,000-word transcript - to a ride global audience and to acclaim within the social sciences. As =lways, as a public 
service, it is available to the public free of =harge.
