Transaction complete ! 
. this - in spite of yo=r collection of Elysium misfits.. 
With Brad out of the o=fice and unable to run his usual interference , the level of h=s utter incompetence was 
brought front and center, he may be a=step up from Eileen, but , if, then it is not by mu=h, . Though you and I have 
spent many many =ours discussing the importance of details and mecha=ics. I was not shown one document re 
phaidon<=span>, not one.. Brad wanted to keep it private between him and his=C240. so called " advisors " 40=A0 
however with him gone I did get to spend time with Joe and john, - the situation in your officeQ=A0 is totally 
ludicrous - to summarize - the list I pro=ided to Brad last December . of things =1 thought were a priority to get done 
is virtually still=C240 undone. 
IT, still desperately needed- re=orting flawed cumbersome and inaccurate . all done by hand as a one =ff exercises , -
airplane re structure, (my =nly suggested priority in June ) is really nowhere=,consultants up the kazoo but nothing at all 
done.( office told i c=nnot even see the proposals received without brads specific authorization = - brad has no idea 
even as to what questions to ask. he knows littl= of finance, is run roughshod over by almost everyone in the 
office..C2* he is a little man , using your power, to appear larger . Eileen kne= she was over her head , that was the 
difference. the bad inf= is rampant ie 3 million deduc=ions Im told are taken for art space =ut on closer 
examination it turns out they cannot be used at all. ( =ERO benefit ) though you will be told yes they were deducted on 
the =eturn they said that is the question they get asked ! not &quo=; is there a benefit " !! ( ridiculous ) 
I asked for 
th= balance sheet and P and L for regan arts =, a basic first step in order to check your financials. "=sorry we never got 
one?" though 9.8 million invested, no p&=, nothing , a construction project run amok , no budget, the=C240 coo fired 
after only 3 months. , no clue . I can add that artspace financ=als are also a total mess. 
As you friend=and To turn the page in order try to be constructive the foll=wing is a list of things I think would be in 
your interest*=A0 to get done asap .but definitely not by me . 
i su=gest you form new grats= , hire a high level tax partner. use your trading=accounts as they remain the 
paramount requirement 16 months af=er i emailed to you their importance. , I suggest you have the 49pe=cent of 
phaidon merged into artspance and have Richard buy <=pan>artspace. re-do bank loan=. no need to pay interest at 
higher rates on boat or plane.. as Ric=ard is now no longer trustee. re- do will, make suydam executor, with Barry, 
and john as back up. pay 1 million a year for executor ro=e. get rid of Judy Black trust= deal with gifts. review amounts 
to kids at fixed ages. put more pro=ections in for Alex and Victoria. , =istribute some money to kids let them make 
decisions. , =ecide art division with children in attendance . have fire dri=l done on estate. fill out estate returns as if 
you and Debra died t=day, choose advisers - rick bro=stein said the only 1040 he ever filled out was his o=n. ( this is 
brads chosen advisor??!) Halperin has a conflict that should be addressed., deb=a should enter a tenants in common 
agreement with kids= you have airplane consultants tax consultants it consul=ants. plane operation consultant. . boat 
consultants. architec=s, lights , art, legal, . foundation , deal with TRA , BRH = rationalize investments. cash flow.
