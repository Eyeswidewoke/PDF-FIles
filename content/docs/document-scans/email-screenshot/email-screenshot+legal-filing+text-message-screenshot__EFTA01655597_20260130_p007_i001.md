deals, his latest financial disclosure shows. Patel's main source of income -- accounting for more than $2.1 million —
was national security, defense, and intelligence consulting through his firm Trishul LLC, according to the 
disclosure. Among his clients were Trump's social media company Trump Media & Technology Group, the Embassy 
of Qatar, and Czech financial services company CSGM — though the disclosure doesn't say how much he received 
from each client. Bloomberg (02/04, Massa, Allison) reported that Patel received a stock award last week from 
Truth Social's parent company worth more than $800,000. But the grant of restricted shares in Trump Media & 
Technology Group Corp. didn't appear on Patel's financial disclosure or ethics agreement, which detail how federal 
appointees will handle potential conflicts of interest. The article stated that the award and the lack of an 
explanation of how Patel would handle it comes as senators weigh whether he should be confirmed to lead the 
country's top law enforcement agency. Disclosures around the new grant fall into a gray area given its timing, 
according to experts who study how the government handles such conflicts. If Patel were to hold on to the 
restricted shares while running the FBI, "it gives him a financial incentive not to take any actions that would 
undermine the value of Trump Media," said Kathleen Clark, a professor at Washington University in St. Louis School 
of Law, who specializes in government ethics. "That would include investigations?' The Hill (02/04, Beitsch) 
reported that Patel worked as a consultant to the government of Qatar, newly released disclosures show, raising 
questions from ethics experts about his failure to register as a foreign agent. Patel listed the U.S. Embassy of Qatar 
as among the clients of his consulting company Trishul, which he has managed since shortly after Trump left office 
in 2021. State Democracy Defenders Action said Patel failed to register his consulting work, something they said 
could violate the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA). "It appears neither Patel nor Trishul is registered under 
FARA for services provided to Qatar, leaving open the important question of exactly what Patel did for Qatar when 
he was serving as a national security advisor to President Trump during the 2024 election," Norm Eisen, the group's 
founder and a former Trump impeachment lawyer, wrote in the letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee. "If 
confirmed as the head of the FBI, Patel will be responsible for law enforcement investigations into possible FARA 
violations. And he will be expected to carry out this duty faithfully and impartially" Eisen wrote, noting recent FARA 
cases involving those who failed to disclose work for the Qatari government. 
Coalition of Attorneys General Urges Senate to Interrogate FBI Nominee Pate! on Agent Dismissals 
Insider NJ (02/04, Staff Writer) reported that a coalition of attorneys general today sent a letter to Senate Judiciary 
Chairman Chuck Grassley, urging the Senate to require Kash Patel, President Trump's nominee for FBI Director, to 
return for further questioning before the Senate Judiciary Committee. The request follows alarming reports of 
politically motivated firings at the FBI and efforts to compile a list of agents involved in investigating the January 
6th Capitol riots. The attorneys general note how critical it is for Patel to address recent reports of retaliatory firings 
at the FBI, stating in their joint letter, "Shortly after his confirmation hearing, we learned from news reports that 
more than a dozen high-ranking FBI officials were fired and that the FBI is developing a list of all agents and staff 
who worked investigations and prosecutions related to the January 6th Capitol riots. It is critical for Mr. Patel to 
answer questions about this unprecedented attack on the FBI before Senators vote on his confirmation." The letter 
raises additional concerns over reports that "the Administration plans to fire at least six high-ranking career FBI 
officials if they do not retire" and that "acting deputy attorney general Emil Bove directed FBI staff to compile a list 
of all staff who were 'assigned at any time to investigations and/or prosecutions' relating to the January 6th riots?' 
The attorneys general state, "If true, this is a purge of FBI employees?' The attorneys general stress that before any 
confirmation vote, "the United States Senate should know what Mr. Patel plans to do with the list of FBI agents and 
staff that is currently being compiled." Beyond the FBI purge, the letter condemns additional attacks on law 
enforcement by the Trump administration, stating, "The President's efforts to undermine the FBI follow 
unprecedented attacks on our country's public safety. In just two weeks, the President has fired United States 
Attorneys, pardoned rioters who killed and injured Capitol Police Officers, and cut off funding for law enforcement 
across the country?' The Brooklyn Eagle (02/04, Staff Writer), WLNS (CBS-6) (02/04, King), and KOLO (ABC-8) 
(02/04, Sheridan) also reported on the story. 
The Blaze (02/04, Gottfried), Financial Express (02/04, Siddiqui), the Juggernaut (02/04, Sampath, Bose), Mother 
Jones (02/04, Friedman), and the Nevada Independent (02/04, Bredderman) also reported on Kash Patel.
