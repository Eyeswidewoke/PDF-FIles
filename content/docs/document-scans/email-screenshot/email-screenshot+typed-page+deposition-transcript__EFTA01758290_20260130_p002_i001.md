diplomacy, "when 
you don't know move slow." 
The President is right to dial back the "red 
line", especially when none of his options are good and there is no clear 
long-term goals or strong local partners. Leaving Afghanistan in the hands 
of Karzai and Iraq with Chalabi, Allawi and Maliki has proven to be a 
disaster, and in Syria it could be even worse. 
Although I applaud John McCain as a patriot, he is totally out of touch 
with reality. This is a person who believes that the 'Surge In Iraq* was a 
success, when in reality is was a temporary band-aid that for a time, 
overwhelming several violent factions while paying off others, but doing 
nothing to address the underlying core problems and dysfunctionality in the 
country. I believe that Lindsey Graham is right when he says that Syria 
looks like it is going to end up a failed state. As such I believe that 
tjat Senator McCain and the other Sunday experts are wrong when they insist 
that American should act alone, when there is nothing that the US can do 
other than putting a band-aid on a festering situation, especially with 
little or no public support at home, and regional non-existent partners, 
will put the blame on the last man standing. Because of this, all of the 
President's options are bad. Bombing a foreign country is -- an *act of 
war*, however you spin it. And as Collin Powell once caution, President 
George W. Bush "if it breaks you will own it"*, the same is true in 
Syria. It is estimated that 70,000 people have already died in Syria as a 
result of this current civil war, and to use the death of 20 to 30 more as 
a pretense to go to war seems a bit hypocritical to me. Although Sarin is 
categorized as a WMD, less people died worldwide during the same period in 
the US due to firearms. Still, we couldn't even get background checks 
approved in Congress last week. I watched the *Sunday Morning News 
Programs*, with their guests advocating that we do something immediately, 
even when they all agree that there are no good options. Maybe when there 
are no good options, we should wait. And if this is truly a problem, let's 
wait for the Arab League, EU or the UN to take the lead, because as General 
Powell explained, •"if we break it we will end up owning it."' And the 
Syrian war, will be our war.... game-changer or not. So again, *if you 
don't know, sip slow.'

If Lindsey Graham has his way, the U.S. soon will be fighting four wars. 
On Tuesday, Jon Stewart took a look at Obama's "red line"* that Syria may 
or may not have crossed by using chemical weapons, and then took apart the 
Republican march to war, but not "boots on the ground"' war. Apparently, 
we'll be fighting this one with* "remote freedom magic."' But Stewart gave 
Graham some credit when he said we just have to get the right weapons to 
the right people.* "Oh, the right weapons to the right people... maybe we
