WUSA-TV Washington (11/23, Wainman, 98K) reports from Gaithersburg, Maryland, "Two 
brothers from Gaithersburg, Maryland have been arrested on federal charges stemming from an 
alleged romance scam involving 200 victims worldwide." David Annor, 27, and Lesley Annor, 22, 
"were arrested on Nov. 16 and charged with money laundering, according to Robert Hur, the 
U.S. Attorney for Maryland. The criminal complaint alleges that the Annors, along with co-
conspirators, were part of a romance scheme in which they connected with their victims online, 
typically through social media and dating websites, and convinced them to send money based 
on a misrepresentation that they were in a romantic relationship with the victim. The co-
conspirators would make contact with the victims, convince them they were in a romantic 
relationship and then request money, often reassuring the victim they would be repaid, and 
give details of where to send the money, which was typically an account controlled by the Annor 
brothers."
