Section 4. Glendower Capital Secondary Opportunities Fund IV. LP 
Glendower Capital Secondary Opportunities Fund IV, LP 
The Manager believes it will be able to source less intermediated deal flow and work directly with sellers to address their 
objectives. which often include non-monetary factors such as confidentiality, speed of transaction and certainty of 
execution. 
Differentiated Sourcing 
The Glendower SOF Team maintains an extensive network of relationships and referral sources amongst fund investors. 
fund sponsors, managers, portfolio companies. intermediaries/placement agents. investment banks and other 
counterparties in the financial industry which they can leverage to source proprietary, less intermediated, deal flow. 
The Manager believes that its global sourcing approach is critical to achieving attractive risk-adjusted returns for the 
Fund by allocating capital to what the Manager considers to be the best investment opportunities on a global basis. 
Since inception, the SOF Program has benefitted from a diversified pool of sellers as well as assets. More specifically: 
• 
The secondary investments represented in the SOF Funds are comprised of assets located in (by fair market value) 
North America 47%, Europe 47%. Asia and Pacific 3% and the rest of the world 4%.45
• 
Sellers of the assets purchased by the SOF Funds were located in (by value) North America 43%, Western Europe 
55% and the rest of the world 3%.0
The Manager expects to leverage non-monetary factors. such as confidentiality. trust, speed and certainty of execution. 
In Glendower's experience, these factors become particularly relevant to sellers in distressed financial conditions or who 
are keen to mitigate execution risk in rapidly changing markets. In sourcing transactions for the Fund, the Manager 
expects the Glendower SOF Team to focus on sellers who ascribe value to non-monetary factors that the Fund may be 
in a position to offer.
