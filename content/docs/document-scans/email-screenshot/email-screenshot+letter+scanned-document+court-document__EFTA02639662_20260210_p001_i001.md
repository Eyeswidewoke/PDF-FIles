1 had I known in the beginning what i know now, = would never have gotten involved with ana s issue never ! ever.! . 
/ I have=40 years of experience dealing with the IRS , I never have che=ted ,evaded or crafted ridiculous returns . 
=C2 I am manical in taking carefully crafted thoughtful positions=C2 that even if I dont win the full amount ,( and i 
have no recol=ection of any total loss on any position.) . my credibility w=th the IRS is unsurpassed. my research is 
detailed=C2 and the case laws are always relevant. 
=C2 Ana is emblematic of my warning s and advice that 
contin=es to go unheeded. . I have repeatedly told you that the=e girls , all want to show that they are clever, they 
have no =xperience with the rules, money or biz . and always push the e=velope beyond the pale 
unfortunately 
usually ending up=getting the principal in trouble.. ( sometimes by design , bu= i m sure , not in this case ). For six 
months I have a=ked you , her and her gay bookkeeper if there was something i didn't k=ow , as I found this entire 
exercise highly unusual. highly =C2 after you with the usual voice of authority telling me in no uncerta=n terms "what 
the agent really wants" . =1 continue to be amazed how you „ and brad share very strong detailed views =ithout even 
one day of true experience. I will review with you=the facts on the phone . 
2. I can easily ignore the fa=t that your concern of deductibity of the first 100 million that saved you= financial life. and 
provided a resurrection of 3 billion dollars of=C2 grats that had died=C2 is not balanced by the recognition of what you 
had received and not =hen even paid for . Each time you have chosen not to pay what we ag=eed. or what has been 
written by me in many emails BEFORE the =ransactions are complete. you tell me that tom and joslins advice is one of 
the reasons =hat you feel you shouldn't pay the amount owed writen or agreed. =( this only happens AFTER you have 
received the beneifts of co=rse ) 
you then add the easily refuted argument th=t it was Alan's idea. NW It is and 
woul= have been super easy for you to set a meeting if you had chosen to.=C2 you met with brad. there are memos. 
t=ere are emails ( which you choose not even to look at , for , I can =nly assume . for the fear that it is as clear as I 
suggest it is . ). =AO lets assume that i show you alan had minuscule input,at the very end . way after the=fact , no 
invovlement in the crafting of the idea - to a transaction=that saved your family 600 million dollars. or that in f=ct the 
first hundred or the full 175 actually now gets you a benefit=that you have been going on about . . what then ?! 
will=there be more reasons that appear why agreed amounts should not be paid.=C2 or are you suggesting we going to 
go through this exercise for =its amusement value 
3 It seems you have forgott=n that you asked for my HELP! . Gigi, Carlyn, =AO audit , gift tax audit audit. 8865, =C2 
gagosian contract.=C2 underpayment of Apollo offshore. tax. now AF and A . - i= is wholly unfair that after I tell you 
what I will charge , you say=, don't worry _ we always work it out, complete the transanion to your benefit and then
