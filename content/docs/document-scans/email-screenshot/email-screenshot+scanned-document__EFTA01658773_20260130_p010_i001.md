ODNI Says It Will Transition To President-Elect After Ascertainment. 
NBC News (11/10, Dilanian, Memoli, 6.14M) reports, "The Trump administration's unwillingness 
to acknowledge that former Vice President Joe Biden won the election has led to an unusual 
restriction on the flow of national security information to the president-elect." In a statement, 
ODNI "said it will not interface with the Biden transition" until GSA "decides it's clear who won, 
a process known as `ascertainment:" The statement said, "ODNI follows the statutory direction 
provided in the Presidential Transition Act, which requires ascertainment of the candidate by the 
administrator of GSA prior to supporting a potential presidential transition," adding the agency 
"would not have contact with any transition team until notified by the GSA administrator." The 
State Department "is not facilitating calls between Biden and foreign leaders." 
Chinese-Canadians Advocate For Hotline To Report Intimidation By Beijing. 
The Globe and Mail (CAN) (11/11, 1.04M) reports, "Chinese-Canadian groups are urging the 
federal government to set up a dedicated national hotline where they can report intimidation or 
harassment by agents of the Chinese government." According to the Canadian Security 
Intelligence Service, "Beijing is routinely using undercover state security officials and 'trusted 
agents,' or proxies, to target members of Canada's Chinese community." The government wants 
to "silence critics of President Xi Jinping and often includes threats of retribution against 
families back in China, CSIS said." 
The Globe and Mail (CAN) (11/10, 1.04M) reports that CSIS "says Beijing routinely uses 
undercover state security officials and 'trusted agents,' or proxies, to target members of 
Canada's Chinese community in an effort to silence critics of President Xi Jinping, including 
threats of retribution against their families back in China." The agency "says these illegal 
activities in Canada are part of a global campaign of intimidation that constitutes a threat to 
this country's sovereignty and the safety of Canadians." A high-profile effort, called Operation 
Fox Hunt, is "directed by Beijing's Ministry of Public Security" and "has been under way since 
2014." FBI Director Wray "said in July that Operation Fox Hunt's principal aim now is to 
suppress dissent among the Chinese diaspora. He called Fox Hunt nothing more than a 
sweeping bid by Mr. Xi to 'target Chinese nationals who he sees as threats and who live outside 
China, around the world.'

Vatican Report Reveals Cardinal Was Targeted By KGB As Asset. 
NJ News (11/10, Sherman, 1.72M) reports, "long before he was made a cardinal, Theodore 
McCarrick was targeted by the Soviet Union as a possible intelligence asset, according to the 
long-awaited Vatican report released Tuesday." The report "offered unprecedented detail into 
the life and long-hidden allegations of sexual abuse by the now defrocked 90-year-old." 
However, investigators also "recounted one of the more bizarre episodes unrelated to the 
scandal that led to his downfall." McCarrick's rise in the church "attracted the attention of the 
KGB," which "led to an encounter with the Soviet Union's intelligence service." The report said 
the FBI "asked him to serve as a counterintelligence asset with respect to the activities of the 
KGB."
