Washington Technology (03/12, Wakeman) reported that SMX is getting a second chance at a $7 billion FBI IT 
contract now that the agency has agreed to let the company back into the competition. The company was removed 
from the competition for the set of blanket purchase agreements known as the Information Technology Supplies 
and Support Services 2nd Generation, or ITSSS-2. The article added that SMX went to the Government 
Accountability Office with arguments that the FBI improperly evaluated the company's proposal, applied unstated 
evaluation criteria, and conducted an unequal evaluation. The FBI told GAO that it would reevaluate the company's 
proposal in light of the protest. Because of the corrective action, GAO has dismissed the protest. Previously, the FBI 
said the awards were delayed until late May because of the protests. The article noted that one protest remains 
active and that involves Computer World Services Corp., for which GAO has a ruling due date of May 15. The FBI 
cannot announce awards while a protest is pending, but it can continue to evaluate proposals.

were part of the Latino civil rights movement. They include labor leader Cesar Chavez and the American G.I. Forum, 
a civil rights group founded by Mexican American veterans, according to the letter.

The Washington Post (03/12, Meckler, Natanson, Harden) reported that school hate crimes targeting LGBTQ+ 
people have sharply risen in recent years, climbing fastest in states that have passed laws restricting LGBTQ student 
rights and education, a Washington Post analysis of FBI data finds. The article noted that in states with restrictive 
laws, the number of hate crimes on K-12 campuses has more than quadrupled since the onset of a divisive culture 
war that has often centered on the rights of LGBTQ+ youth. At the same time, calls to LGBTQ+ youth crisis hotlines
