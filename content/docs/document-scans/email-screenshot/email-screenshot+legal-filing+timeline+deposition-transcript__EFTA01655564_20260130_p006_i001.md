CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS 
James Comey Warns President Trump's Revenge Push Isn't Over 
Axios (11/25, Walker) reported that former FBI Director James Comey says he expects President Trump to "come 
after him again" despite a judge dismissing the case against him. According to the article, the case was dismissed 
due to the prosecutor's appointment being "defective", but the Trump administration plans to appeal the ruling. 
Comey slammed Trump's attempts to prosecute him as "fundamentally un-American" and a threat to the rule of 
law, stating he is not afraid and believes in an independent federal judiciary. In related reporting, USA Today (11/25, 
Bagchi) reported that the Justice Department has time to seek new charges against James, who was charged with 
bank fraud and making false statements, but the deadline for charging Comey with lying to Congress and 
obstructing a congressional proceeding may have expired. The article noted that the Trump administration could 
try to appoint a new prosecutor, such as a "special attorney", to bring new charges against James and Comey, but 
the defendants may argue that the charges are vindictive and should be dismissed. Additional reporting was 
provided by Forbes (11/25, Durkee), The Hill (11/25, Lee, Beitsch), The New York Times (11/25, Barrett), The 
Washington Post (11/25, Roebuck, Rizzo, et al.), Associated Press (11/25, Tucker), NPR (11/25, Treisman), and The 
Guardian (11/25, Sarat). 
Continued Reporting: NBA Betting Scandal, FBI Investigation Timeline: Arrests to Arraignments 
The Athletic (11/25, Andrejev) reported that Chauncey Billups, Terry Rozier, and Damon Jones were arrested and 
charged in a federal investigation into a multi-state gambling scandal involving the NBA. According to the 
article, Billups and Jones have pleaded not guilty to the charges, while Rozier is due in court on December 8. NBA 
Commissioner Adam Silver is navigating two scandals facing the league, including a betting scandal that has led to 
the arrest of several individuals, including Terry Rozier and Chauncey Billups. "The fraud is mind-boggling," Director 
Patel says. "We're talking tens of millions of dollars in theft and fraud and robbery." 
New York Man Sentenced to Fifteen Years for Sex Trafficking 
Hoodline New York City (11/25, Carlisle) reported that Justin Dixon, a Staten Island man, was sentenced to 15 years 
in prison for sex trafficking and illegal firearm possession. According to the article, Dixon pled guilty to coercing and 
enticing a minor as young as 14 into prostitution, using violence and intimidation to control his victims. The article 
noted that the NYPD, along with the FBI, played critical roles in the successful prosecution; their collaborative 
efforts to address sex trafficking were reaffirmed by the substantial prison term handed to Dixon. "Justin Dixon 
forced multiple women, including a 14-year-old minor, to engage in sexual acts for his own financial gain, wielding 
threats of violence to maintain control," stated FBI Assistant Director in Charge Raia in the press release. "Dixon 
repeatedly violated his victims' autonomy through degrading and manipulative grooming techniques designed to 
entrap them into his servitude. May today's sentencing emphasize the FBI's commitment to continued 
collaboration with our law enforcement partners to hold accountable any sexual predator who targets and uses 
others for personal financial enrichment." Additional reporting was provided by the New York Daily News (11/25, 
Annese).

of life in prison if found guilty. A special agent with the FBI wrote in the affidavit that carpet had been removed 
from the living room between early March searches and a follow-up visit on March 17, 2024. The article noted 
that DNA evidence links Hunt to a violent fight with his brother, and the remains of Isaac Hunt were found on the 
Spirit Lake Reservation.
