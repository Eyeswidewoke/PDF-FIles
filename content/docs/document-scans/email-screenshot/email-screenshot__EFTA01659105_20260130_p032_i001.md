plants, prisons, health care settings, and restaurants and bars are still the leading sources of

members contract the coronavirus "after a small indoor birthday celebration earlier this month 
where no one wore masks." According to the Post, the family "is begging others to avoid 
gathering with anyone outside their immediate household."

for mask usage on the sideline and is threatening discipline for those who violate the league's 
updated COVID-19 protocols." The league "told teams in a memo on Monday that players who

Gottlieb Issues Warning About Long-Term COVID Effects. 
The Hill (11/23, Weixel, 2.98M) reports former Food and Drug Administration commissioner 
Scott Gottlieb spoke Monday at a American Enterprise Institute panel discussion, where he 
warned that medical community does not have enough data to understand the long-term 
medical impacts of COVID-19. He "said the coronavirus is so widespread in the U.S. it's hard to 
tell if there are more incidences of post-viral complications than other diseases like the flu." 
Gottlieb also "defended the White House's slow response to the pandemic, saying the U.S.'s 
broad initial failure was not the fault of 'just one person."

Maryland Governor Challenges WPost Reporting On Imported COVID Tests. 
The Washington Times (11/23, Zantow, 492K) reports Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) "disputed 
a Washington Post report that his administration spent $9.46 million on 500,000 faulty 
coronavirus tests from South Korea earlier this year." The Washington Post reported that the 
first batch of tests, which Hogan reportedly paid $9.46 million to receive, "were defective," and 
he later "paid the [LabGenomics] $2.5 million for another 500,000 in replacement tests." Hogan 
"denied the allegations on the webpage and stated that the 'initial tests were successfully 
validated and usable' but 'a change in FDA emergency protocols' prompted LabGenomics to 
replace and upgrade the tests." 
Study: One In 12 Early COVID Cases Linked To Outbreaks In Meatpacking Plants. 
Bloomberg (11/23, Doming, 4.73M) reports a study by researchers at Columbia University's 
School of International and Public Affairs and the University of Chicago's Booth School of 
Business found that "as many as one in 12 cases of Covid-19 in the early stage of the pandemic 
in the U.S. can be tied to outbreaks at meatpacking plants and subsequent spread in 
surrounding communities." Bloomberg says the study's findings "draw attention to the role of 
the meatpacking industry in the pandemic and the Trump administration's controversial 
approach to workplace safety as outbreaks at slaughterhouses emerged. Trump issued an 
executive order on April 28 directing meatpackers to reopen closed facilities, and the 
administration eschewed mandatory Covid-19 safety regulation, opting instead for voluntary 
industry guidelines."
