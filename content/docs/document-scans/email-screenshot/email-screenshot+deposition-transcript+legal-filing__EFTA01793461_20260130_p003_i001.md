» 3. The idea of getting to artificial intelligence _just_ by "looking 
» =t" (blind deep learning) on complex data flows is not new. I think that =here are at least two aspects to it: deriving a 
content structure that =flows the identification and exploitation of meaningful semantic =elationships (for instance, 
discerning space, color, texture, causal =rder, social structure, ... for instance simply by analyzing all of =outube, or by 
collecting data from a robotic body and camera in a =hysical world), and the integration of that structure with an 
=rchitecture that is capable of thought, language, intention, goal =irected action, decision making, and so on. The former 
is tricky, the =atter impossible. Complexity itself does not define intentional action, =nd the differences between 
individuals and species should not be =educed to differences in complexity perceived by the respective agents. =» I 
agree that we need to gain a much better understanding of "complex = complex" cognition, but that must integrate, not 
replace what we =lready know about the organization of cognitive processes. I am certain =hat our current models are a 
long way off from capturing the richness =f conscious experience of our inner processes, and even more so from =he 
much greater complexity of those processes that cannot be =xperienced.

» Another interesting point I gathered from Takashi's talk is the idea =f something we might call "hyper-complex" 
cognition. The complexity =andled by our human minds (as well as the one of Andrew Ng's deep =earning Youtube 
watching networks) builds on very simple stimuli. But =hat if the atoms themselves are abstract or highly complex, for 
=nstance because they are already semantic internet content? The =ognitive agents handling those elements may 
essentially be operating at = level above human cognition if they are capable of operating on that =omplexity without 
reducing it. Unlike humans which are forced to =ranslate and reduce all content into their individual frame of =eference, 
and access it only through a single perspective at a time, =rtificial agents do not need to obey such restrictions. Today's 
Big =ata moniker probably marks just the beginnings of the abilities of =achines to make sense of abstract and complex 
input data.

>»» For me, this is similar to the discussions that you and I and =evin have been having about auto-didactism: starting 
from complexity =ather than abstraction (which is generally antithetical to academic =earning). It would seem to me 
that most artificial intelligence =esearch has started from abstraction (and forgive my ignorance if I'm =ff base here) and 
attempted to build up to complexity. My very cursory =ook at the Joscha's MicroPSl work seems to show an approach 
moving in =he direction of the what Ikegami did with the MTM from the classical =bstraction-first approach. MicroPSl 
places its constructs in a reduced =idelity virtual environment, has lower-level abstractions, and brain 
=tructures/dynamic pre-synthesized for things like motivation, emotion, =please correct me if I'm off base - like I said: 
cursory). The brain =tructures in living systems have have evolved as low-energy means of =rocessing brain signals (both 
sensory data flows and internally routed =creams) once they have showed fitness - ultimately, they were =and-blasted 
into their shape by generations of massive data flows. We =ave an understanding of what purpose they serve but not a 
good =nderstanding of how they work (maybe I'm behind on the state of the art =n neuroscience on that point?).
