Republican-led states, including Mississippi, Louisiana, and Tennessee, have been deployed to Washington, D.C. at 
the request of the Trump administration. The move has faced legal challenges and opposition from local officials, 
with critics accusing Trump of manufacturing an emergency to seize greater control of Washington and target 
Democratic cities. The Washington Examiner (08/19, Hunter) reported that AG Bondi announced the arrest of an 
MS-13 gang member as part of a federal crime crackdown in Washington, D.C. The crackdown has resulted in 465 
arrests and 68 firearms seized since it began, with nearly half of the arrests occurring in high-crime areas. President 
Donald Trump and his administration are touting the results as a success in making the nation's capital a safer 
place, with AG Bondi declaring, "Make DC Safe Again!" According to the Washington Post (08/19, Stein, Davies), the 
DOJ is investigating the Washington, D.C. police department over alleged manipulation of crime data to make crime 
rates appear lower. The investigation, led by U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro, will examine the actions of multiple police 
officials and could potentially lead to charges of fraud, obstruction, or making false statements. The probe is linked 
to a dispute between the Trump administration and local officials, including D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser, over the 
need for a federal takeover of law enforcement in the city. The article highlighted that crime statistics reported by 
the D.C. police were generally in line with trends seen nationally. The District's violent crimes — which include 
homicide, aggravated assault, rape, and robbery — fell 10 percent from 2023 to 2024. At the same time, FBI data 
showed, those crimes across the country decreased 13 percent. Additional reporting on the story was provided by 
The Washington Post (08/19, Rizzo), The Guardian (08/19, Lerner), New York Times (08/19, Barrett), and The Daily 
Beast (08/19, Kimmins). 
Continued Reporting: Deputy Director Bongino to Work Alongside 'Co-Deputy Director' of FBI 
The Independent (08/19, Sommerlad) reported that the FBI has appointed Missouri Attorney General Andrew 
Bailey as its new "co-deputy director", who will share duties with current Deputy Director Dan Bongino. The 
appointment comes after Bongino reportedly clashed with Attorney General Pam Bondi over the release of Jeffrey 
Epstein files. "I am proud to announce I have accepted the role of Co-Deputy Director of the FEW" Bailey wrote in a 
brief post on X. "I extend my thanks to President Donald Trump and AG Bondi for the opportunity to serve in the 
mission to Make America Safe Again. I will protect America and uphold the Constitution." Deputy Director Bongino 
responded to a journalist's post about the appointment by writing simply, "Welcome," accompanied by three Stars 
and Stripes emojis. Explaining the decision, Director Patel stated that the FBI "will always bring the greatest talent 
this country has to offer in order to accomplish the goals set forth when an overwhelming majority of American 
people elected President Donald J Trump again. Andrew Bailey will be an integral part of this important mission, 
and I look forward to the continued fight to save America together." Additional reporting on the story was provided 
by MSNBC (08/19, Benen), New York Magazine (08/19, Hartmann), HuffPost (08/19, Zhou), and Raw Story (08/19, 
Davis).

COUNTERTERRORISM 
Analysis: Trump Is Turning the FBI Away From Investigating Terrorism and Corruption, Sources Say 
An analysis from MSNBC (08/19, Dilanian) reported that the Trump administration, led by Director Patel, is shifting 
the FBI's priorities to focus more on investigating violent crimes, with agents expected to spend time on such cases. 
According to the article, this change in priorities is coming at the expense of the FBI's role in protecting the U.S. 
from national security threats, such as terrorism, hackers, and spies, with a planned 15% reduction in the 
workforce. The article noted that current and former FBI officials, including Rob D'Amico, are expressing concern 
that these changes will put the nation in jeopardy and make the FBI a national police force, potentially 
compromising its ability to address traditional missions like white-collar fraud and public corruption. "Morale is low 
and people are stressed;' one FBI official in Washington said in a text, adding that a senior colleague reported that 
"people are coming into her office in tears, talking about how they are really uncomfortable with these orders and 
their supervisors are at a loss to help them:'
