House Speaker Pelosi said, "It is fitting that John Lewis joins this pantheon of patriots, resting 
upon the same catafalque as President Abraham Lincoln. We knew that he always worked on 
the side of the angels - and now, we know that he is with them." The New York Times (7/27, 
Broadwater, 18.61M) reports Senate Majority Leader McConnell "invoked the Rev. Dr. Martin 
Luther King Jr., a friend of Mr. Lewis's, who once said that 'the arc of the moral universe is long, 
but it bends toward justice." McConnell said, "But that is never automatic. History only bent 
toward what's right because people like John paid the price to help bend it." Politico (7/27, 
Caygle, Ferris, 4.29M) also reports. 
NBC Nightly NewsVi (7/27, story 10, 1:45, Holt, 6.32M) also aired a piece on the Bloody 
Sunday protest in Selma, Alabama in 1965, while the CBS Evening NewsVI (7/27, story 11, 
1:40, O'Donnell, 4.46M) looked at the history of the Edmund Pettus Bridge, which some want 
renamed to honor Lewis. 
INTERNATIONAL NEWS 
Cases Surge Around World, Prompting Lockdowns And Travel Bans. 
The Wall Street Journal (7/27, Wen, Wang, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) reports that areas 
such as Australia, Hong Kong, and Japan, which had seen minimal cases earlier in the spring 
and summer, reported new highs in daily infections in the past week, illustrating the difficulty of 
keeping the virus under control. 
Reuters (7/27, Coates, Graff) reports that on Monday, "nations in Asia imposed new 
restrictions...while an abrupt British quarantine on travellers from Spain threw Europe's vaunted 
summer reopening into disarray, as the world confronted the prospect of a second wave of 
COVID-19 infections." According to Reuters, "Surges were reported in a number of countries 
previously singled out as places where the virus was under control." Reuters reports that 
Vietnam "locked down the city of Danang, forcing tens of thousands of visitors to evacuate," 
and China "confirmed the most locally transmitted cases since early March." Meanwhile, Hong 
Kong "banned gatherings of more than two people," and "a surge in infections in Spain 
prompted Britain to order all travellers from there to quarantine for two weeks." 
Bloomberg (7/27, 4.73M) also says that on Monday, China "reported the most domestic 
coronavirus infections in more than four months as it battles outbreaks in its western and 
northeastern regions, raising fears of a serious resurgence." According to Bloomberg, "Of the 61 
infections reported Monday, 57 were local cases with 41 of them in Xinjiang, the politically 
fraught western province where China's treatment of the local Muslim Uighur population has 
come under global criticism." 
Reuters (7/27, Strauss, Blenkinsop) reports, "Belgium announced measures on Monday 
including a sharp reduction in permitted social contact designed to prevent a return to a 
nationwide lockdown after a surge of coronavirus infections in the past three weeks." Prime 
Minister Sophie Wilmes said that, "from Wednesday, a Belgian family or those living together 
would only be able to meet five other people, sharply down from 15 now." Wilmes said, "We are 
acting again today to keep the situation under control and to prevent a general lockdown." 
Navarro Says He Predicted China Would Create A Deadly Pandemic. 
Director of Trade and Manufacturing Policy Navarro said on Bannon's War Room Podcast (7/27) 
that in his 2006 book "The Coming China Wars," he said that "because of the way the Chinese 
Communist Party runs that country, there was a high likelihood...that China would create a viral 
pandemic that could possibly kill millions. ... The reason why I made that prediction was 
because of a close study of how China operates. And back then, the big concern there was the 
animal husbandry, the way they did their fisheries, just the filthiness with which they created 
what I called a viral soup. This was a couple of years after SARS. I looked at it, it's like, 'Wow, 
this is coming again."
