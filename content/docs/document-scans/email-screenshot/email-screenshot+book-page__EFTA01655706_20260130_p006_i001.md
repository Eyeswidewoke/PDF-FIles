Congressional Delegation to Review Super Bowl Security

security ahead of the Feb. 9 Super Bowl following a New Year's Day attack in the city that killed 14 people and

officials from the Department of Homeland Security, FBI, and New Orleans police. The article added that they will 
then tour the city's convention center and Caesars Superdome where they will be briefed by NFL and law 
enforcement officials. The NFL this week said they modified their security plans including adding more law 
enforcement support after a U.S. Army veteran rammed a truck into a crowd of revelers in the early hours of Jan. 1 
in the city's popular French Quarter district. The FBI said 42-year-old Shamsud-Din Jabbar, who had pledged 
allegiance to the Islamic State extremist group, acted on his own. NFL Chief Security Officer Cathy Lanier told 
reporters on Wednesday that law enforcement would number in the "thousands" between state, local, and federal 
agencies. Lanier said there have not been any credible threats made on the event since Jan. 1. Louisiana Governor 
Jeff Landry this week renewed a state of emergency established after the New Year's Day attack and said that 
checkpoints would be in place around the French Quarter. Axios (01/30, Solender, Brasted) also reported on the
