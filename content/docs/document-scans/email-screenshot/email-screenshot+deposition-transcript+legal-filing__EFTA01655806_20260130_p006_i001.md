Boeing, was found dead in a car outside a Holiday Inn from what appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound. 
The articles explained that Barnett had been involved in several whistleblower cases regarding concerns over 
quality and safety at Boeing, including discarded metal shavings near wiring for flight controls, and problems with 
the oxygen system on the Boeing 787. The articles noted that the Charleston County Police Department is actively 
investigating the case, and awaiting a formal cause of death, as well as any additional findings that might shed light 
on the circumstances of Barnett's death. The Washington Post (3/12, Duncan, Aratani) added that at the time of his 
death, Barnett was due to finish the final day of depositions ahead of a June trial date in another whistleblower 
case he filed against Boeing in 2017. The article also explained that the previous week, the National Transportation 
Safety Board issued a preliminary report about an incident in which a United Airlines 737 Max experienced a stuck 
rudder pedal, and which Boeing said it had addressed the problem. This story was also reported on by CNN (3/12,

Pentagon Will Give Ukraine $300 Million in Weapons Even As It Lacks Funds to Replenish US Stockpile 
The Associated Press (3/12, Groves) and the Wall Street Journal (3/12, Youssef, Gordon) reported a White House 
announcement on Tuesday that the Pentagon plans to send about $300 million in weapons to Ukraine after finding 
some cost savings in its contracts. The articles stated that while this is the first announced security package since 
December, it wasn't until recently that Pentagon officials publicly acknowledged they weren't just out of money to 
buy replacement weapons, but $10 billion overdrawn. The articles explained that US officials have insisted for 
months that the US wouldn't be able to resume weapons deliveries until Congress provided additional 
replenishment funds, which are part of the supplemental spending bill stalled in Congress. The articles added that 
the Pentagon also has a separate Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, which allows it to fund longer-term 
contracts with the defense industry to produce new weapons for Ukraine. The articles also described a last effort 
by House Democrats to force a vote on the aid bill for Ukraine and Israel, as they would begin accepting signatures 
on a discharge petition Tuesday morning which allows rank-and-file members to bypass House leaders and put 
legislation directly on the floor provided they can garner 218 signatures—or a majority of the seats in the House.

Uvalde Police Chief Who Was on Vacation During Robb Elementary Shooting Resigns 
The Associated Press (3/13, Coronado) and the Washington Post (3/12, Kaur) reported that the Uvalde police chief 
who was on vacation during the Robb Elementary School shooting submitted his resignation Tuesday, less than a 
week after a report ordered by the city defended the police department's response to the attack but outraged 
some family members of those who were killed. The articles stated that before a Uvalde City Council meeting, 
Uvalde Police Chief Daniel Rodriguez submitted his resignation letter, and then did not attend the meeting. The 
articles noted that the US DO1 had carried a report submitted last January that laid out critical failures of the 
Uvalde Police Department during the shooting. The New York Times (3/12, Sandoval) added that the chiefs 
resignation would be effective on April 6, and in the meantime, Assistant Chief of police, Homer Delgado, would 
serve as the interim police chief while a search for a replacement is conducted. This story was also reported on by 
NBC News (3/12, Burke, Helsel), Reuters (3/12, Brooks), CBS News (3/12, Falcon), Axios (3/12, Habeshian), The
