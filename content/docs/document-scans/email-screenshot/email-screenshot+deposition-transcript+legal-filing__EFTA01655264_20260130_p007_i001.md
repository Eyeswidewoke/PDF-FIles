article, in recent weeks, former UnitedHealth employees said they had been questioned by prosecutors working for 
the healthcare-fraud unit. The FBI and the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Inspector General 
also participated in some of the interviews, the former employees said. The former employees said the 
investigators asked detailed questions about UnitedHealth's efforts to encourage the documentation of certain 
lucrative diagnoses, including testing patients, implementing procedures to ensure that medical conditions were 
captured, and sending nurses to patients' homes. The New York Post (07/09, Herzlich) and Reuters (07/09, Staff

DC Police and FBI Offer $40,000 Reward for Info on Shooting of Intern Eric Tarpinian-Jachym 
ABC News (07/09, Peterson, Forrester) reported that officials have increased the reward for information leading to 
the person who fatally shot a 21-year-old congressional intern in Washington, D.C., last month. Eric Tarpinian-
Jachym, of Granby, Massachusetts, was killed on June 30 at approximately 10:28 p.m. after getting caught in 
gunfire in northwest Washington, D.C., police said. According to the article, the Metropolitan Police Department 
said on Tuesday that a reward of $40,000 is available for anyone who is able to provide information that leads to 
the "arrest and conviction of the person or persons responsible." Police were offering a previous award of $25,000, 
but increased it by an additional $15,000 "thanks to a contribution from our partners at the FBI Washington Field 
Office," officials said. Investigators said they recovered the suspect vehicle last week and stated that while the 
shooting was targeted, Tarpinian-Jachym was not among the intended victims. D.C. Police Chief Pamela Smith told 
reporters last week, "We do have some good video footage, and I say good video footage that's a little grainy, so 
we're bringing in the FBI to kind of help enhance the video resolution so we can see a little bit better." The 
Washington Examiner (07/09, Rosciglione) also reported on the story. 
Opening Arguments Wrap Up for Trial of FBI Agent Accused of Sexually Assaulting Three Women 
WJLA (ABC-7) (07/09, Flores) reported that jury selection and opening arguments wrapped up Wednesday evening 
for the trial of the FBI agent accused of sexually assaulting three women after providing free tattoos and 
photoshoots. According to the article, police arrested Eduardo Valdivia in November 2024. Jury selection took up 
most of Wednesday's court proceedings, but opening arguments began around 3:20 p.m. Both sides took about an 
hour each to make their opening arguments. The main argument centered around whether or not the alleged 
sexual acts that took place were consensual. The prosecutor stated to the jury that Valdivia "preyed on, isolated, 
and sexually assaulted three women" at his tattoo studios. Meanwhile, Valdivia's lawyer told the jury the alleged 
acts were consensual and in exchange for the free services he provided to the women. The prosecution team 
brought up the fact that the FBI agent, who is currently suspended without pay, was trained to be undercover and 
used those skills in these alleged incidents by having different aliases. WUSA (CBS-9) (07/09, Video) also reported 
on the story. 
Federal Authorities End Idaho Search for Suspect in Kids' Deaths After Finding Look-Alike Hiker 
The Associated Press (07/09, Boone) reported that federal authorities in Idaho say they have ended a search in the 
Sawtooth National Forest after determining it was all case of mistaken identity. The search began Saturday after the 
U.S. Marshals Service Greater Idaho Fugitive Task Force said a family reported they saw a man who looked like 
Travis Decker, who is wanted in connection with the deaths of his three daughters in Washington state. The article 
added that Decker has been wanted since June 2, when a sheriff's deputy in Washington found his truck and the 
bodies of his three daughters. The family was near a Bear Creek area campsite when they saw a man who was the 
same height and roughly the same weight as Decker, and also had similar hair, beard and tattoos on his arm and 
calf. Additional tips followed, and federal, state and local law enforcement agencies joined the Marshals Service in 
the search. They found the man Wednesday afternoon, U.S. Marshals Service Supervisory Deputy Michael Leigh 
said in a press release, and determined he was not Decker. The Marshals Service is offering a reward of up to 
$20,000 for information leading to Decker's capture. 
Three Zizians Face Trial Together in Maryland Amid Sprawling Federal Investigation 
The Associated Press (07/09, Skene) reported that three members of a violent cultlike group, including its alleged 
ringleader, will be tried together on charges of trespassing, gun and drug possession after police discovered them 
camping in box trucks in rural western Maryland. The group known as Zizians, which attracted a fringe contingent 
of computer scientists who connected online over their shared anarchist beliefs, has been linked to six killings 
spanning three states in recent years. The Maryland cases were originally scheduled for separate trials, but the 
defendants requested a joint proceeding despite concerns from their attorneys; a judge granted the request 
following a court hearing Tuesday afternoon. According to the article, Jack "Ziz" LaSota and her associates, Michelle
