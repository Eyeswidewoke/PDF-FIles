younger side. No doubt about it — Jeffrey enjoys his social life." 
There's also at least one other Trump sex case, dating from 1997 and 
reported on by Law Newz in February 2016. On April 25, 1997, Jill 
Harth, then in her early thirties, filed for $125 million in damages caused 
by Trump's alleged sexual assaults (short of rape). She said that 
Trump told her he "would be the best lover you ever had." At the time, her 
husband and Trump were in a breach-of contract dispute. 
Trump denied Harth's claims, but she withdrew her suit after Trump settled 
his dispute with her husband. The record of the case has been 
sealed, but the detailed 12-page complaint offers a lurid portrait of Trump 
behavior. Harth has been ambiguous about the case recently, 
telling Law Newz in February: "Everything could be looked at in different 
way.... I have nothing but good things to say about Donald." At 
about the same time, Harth told the Guardian that she stands by her 
allegations against Trump in the 1997 lawsuit. 
That's more or less what Trump's ex-wife Ivana says now, too, though she 
accused him of raping her in 1989. A Trump spokesman said at 
one point, "You cannot rape your spouse," although it's illegal in 50 
states. Ivana Trump made the allegation in a sworn deposition that 
was reported in 1993 in "Lost Tycoon: The Many Lives of Donald J. Trump," by 
Harry Hurt III, who wrote that Ivana told friends that Donald 
"raped me." But Trump had that covered, according to the Mirror: 
Before Lost Tycoon was printed, Trump and his lawyers provided a statement 
from Ivana, published beneath the allegation of rape. It 
read: "During a deposition given by me in connection with my matrimonial 
case, I stated that my husband had raped me. I wish to say that 
on one occasion during 1989, Mr. Trump and I had marital relations in which 
he behaved very differently toward me than he had during 
our marriage. As a woman, I felt violated, as the love and tenderness which 
he normally exhibited toward me, was absent. I referred to this 
as a "rape," but I do not want my words to be interpreted in a literal or 
criminal sense. Any contrary conclusion would be an incorrect and 
most unfortunate interpretation of my statement which I do not want to be 
interpreted in a speculative fashion and I do not want the press 
or media to misconstrue any of the facts set forth above. All I wish is for 
this matter to be put to rest. 
Will the Trump rape lawsuit gain significant media traction? 
Since the June 20 filing in New York there has been some increase in 
considered coverage of the accusations against Trump, but the 
story remains a sideshow with little traction in early July. Snopes.com 
looked at the case (June 23) broadly but inconclusively and without 
new insight. 
"Yes, Donald Trump was accused of raping a 13 year old, but this lawsuit has 
little chance of succeeding," argued Law Newz on June 21, 
the day after the New York filing. Reporter Rachel Stockman noted that 
electronic summonses have been sent to co-defendants Trump 
and Epstein, but she devoted most of her article to speculative arguments 
that the lawsuit will fail, apparently reflecting the views of 
Trump's attorney Alan Garten, who "is threatening to file for sanctions 
against [Attorney] Meagher if he even proceeds with the lawsuit." 
Meagher was unavailable for comment. Calling the allegations "unequivocally
