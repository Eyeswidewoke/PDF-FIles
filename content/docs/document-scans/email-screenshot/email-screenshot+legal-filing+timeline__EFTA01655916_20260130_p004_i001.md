Epoch Times Executive Accused of Laundering $67 Million 
The New York Times (06/03, Bensinger, Homans) reported that Weidong Guan, a top executive at The Epoch Times, 
was arrested and charged with laundering at least $67 million through the company's accounts. According to the 
article, he faces three counts, including money laundering and bank fraud, with allegations that he boosted the 
company's revenue by nearly 400% by using funds obtained from fraudulent unemployment benefits and other 
illicit activities. The Justice Department emphasized the operation did not concern the media company's 
journalistic activities, but highlighted the severe impact of Guan's actions on the integrity of the U.S. financial 
system. The press release noted that this prosecution is part of an Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces 
("OCDETF") operation. "OCDETF identifies, disrupts, and dismantles high-level criminal organizations using a 
prosecutor-led, intelligence-driven, multi-agency approach," the press release explained. Additional reporting on 
the story was provided by The Daily Beast (06/03, Baragona), Business Insider (06/03, Newsham), New York

COUNTERTERRORISM 
FBI Previously Dismissed Claims Against British Bank Now Accused of Funding Terrorist Groups 
The BBC (06/03, Staff Writer) reported that Standard Chartered, a major UK bank, allegedly conducted transactions 
amounting to over $100 billion that breached sanctions against Iran from 2008 to 2013, according to new U.S. 
court documents. These transactions reportedly supported entities like Hezbollah, Hamas, al-Qaeda, and the 
Taliban, with independent expert David Scantling identifying $9.6 billion in transactions linked to these terrorist 
groups. The article explained that the bank has twice admitted breaching sanctions against Iran and other countries 
- first in 2012 and then in 2019 - paying fines totaling more than $1.7bn. However it has not admitted to conducting 
transactions for "terrorist" organizations. The article added that in 2019, the FBI and other U.S. authorities applied 
to have their case against the bank dismissed, with an FBI agent stating in court that nothing "indicated or 
suggested that the bank had engaged in improper US dollar transactions" after 2007. The article noted that both 
the FBI and the DOJ have declined to comment on these latest disclosures. 
Detroit Man Arrested and Charged After Attempting to Provide Money to ISIS 
Homeland Security Today (06/03, Seldon) reported that Jibreel Pratt, a 25-year-old from Detroit, was arrested and 
charged with attempting to provide material support to ISIS, a designated foreign terrorist organization. According 
to the article, the arrest followed an indictment detailing Pratt's efforts to send currency to ISIS in March and May 
of 2023. U.S. Attorney Dawn N. Ison emphasized the gravity of the charges, stating, "The indictment alleges that 
the defendant attempted to support and join ISIS, which is one of the most brutal terrorist organizations in the 
world. These charges reflect our commitment to hold accountable anyone who tries to help terrorists." Adding to 
this, FBI Special Agent Cheyvoryea Gibson highlighted the coordinated efforts to thwart such threats, "The 
protection of the American people and our communities remains a top priority for the FBI. Through joint and 
coordinated efforts by our law enforcement and intelligence partners, and vigilant citizens, we will continue to 
disrupt plots by those who desire to harm others on behalf of a foreign terrorist organization. I would like to thank 
our Joint Terrorism Task Force for their work in this investigation and for their steadfast commitment to protecting 
our nation." The article noted that Pratt faces up to 20 years in prison per charge if convicted.
