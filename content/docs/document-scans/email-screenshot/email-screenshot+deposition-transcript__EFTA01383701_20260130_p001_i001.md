Important information 
— Bond funds may lose value, as the principal is not guaranteed and the fund's net asset value will fluctuate, as bond prices fluctuate and individual bonds will be bought 
and sold by the Investment Advisor, resulting in gains or losses. Generally, when interest rates go up, bond prices decline, which will negatively impact the fund's share price. Bond 
funds are also exposed to credit risk, or the risk that the fund's individual bonds will be downgraded, and inflation risk, or the risk that the rate of the bonds' yield will not provide a 
positive return over the rate of inflation.

— The value of an Exchange Traded Product is derived from other investment instruments such as a commodity, currency, share price or interest rate. 
Generally, exchange traded products are benchmarked to stocks, commodities, indices or they can be actively managed funds. Exchange traded products include exchange traded 
funds (ETFs), exchange traded vehicles (ETVs),and exchange traded notes (ETNs). An Exchange Traded Product does not provide investors with entitlements to the underlying 
security. ETPs are subject to market risk and will fluctuate in value based on movements in the underlying securities. Investors should realize that redemption values of ETPs are 
based upon the market value at the time of order and not at the net asset value as is the case for mutual funds. Investments in ETPs are subject to management fees.

— Investing in high yield bonds, which tend to be more volatile than investment grade fixed income securities, is speculative. These bonds are 
affected by interest rate changes and the creditworthiness of the issuers, and investing in high yield bonds poses additional credit risk, as well as greater risk of default.

— Such investments may be or become nonperforming after acquisition for a wide variety of reasons. Nonperforming real estate investments may require 
substantial workout negotiations and / or restructuring. Environmental liabilities may pose a risk such that the owner or operator of real property may become liable for the costs of 
removal or remediation of certain hazardous substances released on, about, under or in its property. Additionally, to the extent real estate investments are made in foreign countries, 
such countries may prove to be politically or economically unstable. Finally, exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates may affect the value of a real estate investment. 
— The risk of loss in trading commodities can be substantial. The price of commodities (e.g.. raw industrial materials such as gold, copper and aluminum) may be 
subject to substantial fluctuations over short periods of time and may be affected by unpredicted international monetary and political policies. Valuations of commodities may be 
susceptible to such adverse global economic, political or regulatory developments. Prospective investors must independently assess the appropriateness of an investment in 
commodities in light of their own financial condition and objectives.

Ownership in an exchange traded fund does not provide investors with entitlements to the underlying security. Rather investors own a 'creation unit" in a 
portfolio of stocks, bonds, or other securities. ETFs are subject to market risk and will fluctuate in value based on movements in the underlying security. Investors should realize 
that redemption values of ETFs are based upon the market value at the time of order and not at the net asset value as is the case for mutual funds. Investments in ETFs are subject 
to commission charges and management fees. Deutsche Bank may have certain conflicts of interest in recommending investments in certain funds, including the fact that we may 
receive 12b-1 fees and other compensation from the funds and their investment advisors and that funds may execute transactions through Deutsche Bank. Carefully consider a 
Fund's investment objectives, risk factors and charges and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus, which may be obtained by 
calling 1.855-DBX-ETFS (1.855.329-3837), or by viewing or downloading a prospectus. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.
