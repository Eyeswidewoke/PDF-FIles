Parents Accused of Torturing Their Six-Year-Old Adopted Daughter to Death and Burying Her in the 
Backyard 
The Independent (02/04, Rissman) reported that a Kansas couple was arrested in connection to the death of their 
six-year-old adopted daughter, whose remains were found in their backyard. The article explained that in 
September 2024, authorities were called after receiving a report that human remains were possibly buried in the 
backyard of a home, according to the Rose Hill Police Department. The following day, after obtaining a search 
warrant, officers and cadaver dogs searched the "overgrown" area to find the decomposed remains of a human 
child in a trash bag buried 23 inches deep in the backyard. The article noted that a DNA test revealed the remains 
belonged to Kennedy Schroer, whose birth name was Natalie Garcia, police said. A November postmortem report 
found the little girl's cause of death was probable suffocation — and her manner of death was homicide. The article 
indicated that she was believed to have died in 2020, police previously said, making her six years old at the time. 
Five months after police discovered the remains, on February 3, the child's adoptive parents were arrested. The 
article confirmed that Crystina Elizabeth Schroer, 50, was charged with first-degree murder, aggravated kidnapping, 
four counts of child abuse (torture) felony theft, four counts of forgery, Medicaid fraud and desecration of a corpse. 
Joseph Shane Schroer, 53, was charged with four counts of child abuse (torture), liability for crimes of another, 
interference with law enforcement, felony theft, and Medicaid fraud. The article highlighted that the Rose Hill 
Police detectives dedicated more than 2,000 hours to the case, while other agencies, including the Butler County 
Attorney's Office, FBI, and Department of Children and Families, also dedicated hundreds of hours, police said.

Fugitive Found Hiding in Caribbean Decades After Killing Man in Alaska, Officials Say 
The Charlotte Observer (02/04, Schilling) reported that a man spent nearly three decades living under different 
identities in the Caribbean after fleeing Alaska in the wake of a shooting that left an 18-year-old dead, prosecutors 
said. But Ruben Fernandez, 50, is now back in the United States and was sentenced by an Alaska judge on Jan. 30 
to spend 20 years behind bars in connection with the fatal 1995 shooting of David Burdette, prosecutors said. 
According to the article, Fernandez pleaded guilty in August 2024 to second-degree murder, the Alaska Department 
of Law said in a news release. The U.S. Marshals Service arrested him in 2022 after tracking him to the town of La 
Cuesta, according to the agency. The article detailed that Fernandez, a U.S. citizen, is accused of shooting Burdette 
on May 20, 1995, outside an Anchorage fast food restaurant, according to prosecutors. Fernandez was 21 years old 
at the time, court records show. The article explained that he and Burdette got into a verbal fight, and Fernandez 
shot Burdette in the head as Burdette walked away, prosecutors said. The article noted that after Burdette was on 
the ground, Fernandez shot him in the chest and "continued to shoot out the window of a vehicle" while leaving 
the scene, prosecutors said. Fernandez used four different identities after fleeing to the Dominican Republic, an 
island nation next to Haiti, the marshals service said. The identities led marshals to La Cuesta, the agency said. The 
article highlighted that the Anchorage Police Department spent 27 years investigating and working to find 
Fernandez with help from the marshals service and the FBI, prosecutors said.

article, the FBI is offering a $5,000 reward for information that leads to the arrest and conviction of the person or 
people responsible for Azure's death. The article instructed that anyone with information should contact the FBI at 
(763) 569-8000 or submit a tip to tips.fbi.gov. KVLY (NBC-11) (02/04, Nygren), The Jamestown Sun (02/04, Staff 
Writer), WDAY (FM-93.1) (02/04, Erickson), and The Bismarck Tribune (02/04, Nygaard) also reported on the story. 
Probe of Six Murders Takes Feds Into Strange Territory 
USA Today (02/04, Hughes) reported that police, court records and witnesses are beginning to link a series of six 
seemingly unconnected deaths across the country. The article indicated that two people — who may or may not be 
married to each other — have been detained in connection with two deaths separated by 3,000 miles. The gun used 
in one of those incidents has been linked to the 2022 homicides of two people in Pennsylvania. The article detailed 
that behind bars are Seattle-area natives Teresa Youngblut, 21, detained in Vermont, and Maximilian Snyder, 22, 
detained in California. Records show the two got a marriage license in Washington state last year, but it's unclear
