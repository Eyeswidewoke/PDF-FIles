that cost taxpayers $250 million. Eighteen others have pleaded guilty, and authorities said they recovered about 
$50 million in one of the nation's largest pandemic-related fraud cases. Prosecutors say just a fraction of the money 
went to feed low-income kids, while the rest was spent on luxury cars, jewelry, travel, and property. The article 
mentioned that during the trial that began in April, defense attorneys questioned the quality of the FBI's 
investigation and suggested that this might be more of a case of record-keeping problems than fraud as these 
defendants sought to keep up with rapidly changing rules for the food aid program. These seven initial defendants 
were affiliated with a restaurant that participated in the food aid program. Those still awaiting trial include Feeding 
our Future's founder Aimee Bock, who has pleaded not guilty and denied any wrongdoing. The article stated that 
the 23-year-old juror said she immediately turned over the bag of cash to police. She said a woman left it with her 
father-in-law Sunday with the message that she'd get another bag of cash if she voted to acquit. The Independent 
(06/03, Baio), Daily Beast (06/03, McDougall), and New York Post (06/03, Oliveira) also reported on the story. 
FBI Searches Office Of National Apartment Developer Cortland In Connection With Antitrust Probe 
BISNOW (06/03, Armbrister) reported that national apartment developer Cortland Management's Atlanta office 
was searched by the FBI under a limited search warrant, a representative for Cortland confirmed. The article added 
that the warrant was connected to an investigation by the DOJ into potential antitrust violations in the multifamily 
housing industry, according to a statement from Cortland. According to the article, the DOJ is investigating 
multifamily software company RealPage and some large property owners in connection with allegations of price-
fixing. The DOJ in March expanded the probe, opening a criminal investigation in addition to the civil proceedings. 
Continued Reporting: Indiana Serial Killer's Home Was Littered With 10,000 Human Remains 
The Independent (06/03, McHardy) reported that a man who was reported missing in 1993 has been named as a 
victim of an Indiana serial killer whose property was found littered with 10,000 "burnt and crushed" skeletal 
remains. Herb Baumeister, a successful businessman who was a married father of three children, is believed to 
have killed at least 25 people between the late 1980s and the early 1990s. He hunted mostly gay men in 
the Indianapolis suburb of Westfield, Indiana, where he lived on an 18-acre property known as Fox Hollow 
Farm. Four decades after Baumeister started his killing spree, authorities have finally begun naming his victims, 
with Jeffrey A. Jones, who disappeared in 1993, becoming the latest to be identified by the Hamilton County 
Coroner's Office. The article noted that Jones was identified after scientists developed a DNA profile for him using 
Genome Sequencing Othram, which is the largest forensic genetic genealogy lab in the country, said in a statement. 
The article quoted the statement, which said, "After successfully completing the process, the DNA profile was 
delivered to the FBI's forensic genetic genealogy team and the FBI team performed the necessary genealogical 
research to generate new investigative leads in the case," The article added that a 2005 report by the FBI said 
Baumeister led a double life while he was alive — one as a seemingly ordinary husband and father who went to 
work and came home, and another as a serial killer who went by the fake name of "Brian Smart" and kidnapped 
and killed mostly young, gay men whom he met in bars. 
Missing North Carolina Girl's Stepfather Convicted of Failing to Report Child's Disappearance 
Fox News (06/03, Conklin) reported that a North Carolina jury on May 31 found Christopher Palmiter, stepfather 
of missing Cornelius girl Madalina Cojocari, guilty of failure to report the disappearance of a child to law 
enforcement. The Mecklenburg County jury took 15 minutes after Palmiter's weeklong trial to reach a verdict. The 
article added that Madalina was last seen getting off a school bus in her hometown of Cornelius, just north of 
Charlotte, on Nov. 21, 2022, when she was 11 years old. Authorities have been unable to locate her since. The 
article noted that her mother, Diana Cojocari, pleaded guilty last month to the same charge as Palmiter. Diana, a 
Moldova native, and Pamliter did not report the 11-year-old girl missing to police until weeks later on Dec. 15, 
2022, despite telling police the last time they saw their daughter was at home the evening of Nov. 23, 2022. The 
article mentioned that Palmiter's defense attorneys argued that Diana manipulated him and made him believe his 
stepdaughter was safe at the time of her disappearance. Prosecutors, however, included testimony from an FBI 
analyst, who presented phone and email evidence that suggested Palmiter knew Madalina was missing yet did not 
report her disappearance to authorities.
