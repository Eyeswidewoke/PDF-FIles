The Batavia (NY) Daily News (11/20, DeSmit, 38K) reports from Buffalo, New York, "He boasted 
of having a Mercedes and gold around his wrist and neck and money, cars and toys," and 
"Anthony Allee once wrote on Facebook, his wife was the reason for his success in life. Drugs 
were the reason and on Wednesday, Allee, of Ridgeway, was sentenced in U.S. District Court to 
serve 12 years and six months in federal prison." Allee, 29, "pleaded guilty in July to possessing 
with intent to distribute and distributing cocaine and unlawful possession of a short-barreled 
shotgun in furtherance of drug trafficking." Allee "and his wife, Tashira, 37, were first arrested

Two Arrested After Missing California Man's Body Found. 
KTLA-TV Los Angeles (11/20, 766K) reports, "Two people were arrested Thursday on suspicion 
of murder after the body of a missing man from South Los Angeles was discovered in a shallow 
grave in the San Bernardino County desert, officials said." Juan Hernandez, 21, "was last seen 
Sept. 22 when he left home for his job at VIP Collective, a cannabis dispensary in South L.A. 
His family reported him missing after he didn't return from work that night. His mother, Yajaira 
Hernandez, previously told KTLA the dispensary's security guards said they parted ways with 
her son when they closed up the shop at 10 p.m. Within a week of his disappearance, someone 
tried to extort money from the family for his safe return, according to the Los Angeles Police 
Department. LAPD says it led them to determine Hernandez was most likely the victim of a 
crime, and detectives enlisted the FBI's help in the case." 
The Los Angeles Times (11/19, Ormseth, 4.64M) reports, "Hernandez's family had 
reported him missing the night of Sept. 22. A student at El Camino College in Torrance, 
Hernandez, known to family and friends as 'Cookie,' was a semester shy of transferring to USC, 
where he planned to study engineering, his mother previously told The Times. Hernandez was 
last seen at a marijuana dispensary on the corner of Western Avenue and 81st Street, where on 
Sept. 22 he worked a shift from 3 p.m. to 10 p.m. A few minutes before 10 p.m., he sent his 
mother a text message saying he'd be home soon. He'd driven her car, a 2020 Honda Civic, to 
work. Police found the car two days later in the 6400 block of South Figueroa Street, about two 
miles from the dispensary."

The man "is the fourth member of the ring busted for carrying out a 12-year crime spree that 
hit more than a half-dozen jewelry stores in Manhattan and Brooklyn," according to the US 
Attorney's Office. The ring "even attempted to rob a jewelry store in Germany in 2008 and 
almost made off with nearly $12 million in gold, prosecutors said." One was living in New York, 
"where neighbors knew him as 'Damian from The Bronx,' when the FBI caught up with him in 
October 2018."
