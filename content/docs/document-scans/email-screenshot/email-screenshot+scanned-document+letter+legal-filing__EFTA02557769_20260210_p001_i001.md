history of cardini 
Below is a copy of an article that appeared in the business profile section of Ar=bian Knight Magazine in autumn 2004 
titled 'Aristocratic Globetrotter': 
Aristocrat businessman Gaddo Lensi Orlandi Cardini - the longest family name in Italy = says after travelling the world for 
the last 40 years, that globetrotting i= a sort of addiction, an energetic and heavenly sickness. 
In fact the name of his company is Heaven Energy. 
Yet it is very clear that as a descendant of one of the oldest families in Ital= and with a sister married to royalty he would 
not want it any other way. 
The longest name came about because our family twice failed to have sons to kee= the name going. Therefore following 
permission from the king, the ancient Cardi=i name became Orlandi Cardini, and then it happened again, Orlandi Cardini 
be=ame Lensi Orlandi Cardini. 
To be honest it is easiest when I am called Gaddo, for at times during my education, and after checking into hotels 
people have asked for Mr Lensi an= I have been listed as Mr Cardini which leads to total confusion, he says. 
For this reason the name Cardini, is now a trademark name like Rolex, like Roll= Royce, Ferrari, Chanel & Cartier. 
As Chief Executive Officer and major shareholder of Heaven Energy, a Swiss bas=d company involved in private banking 
and buys and sells aircraft and helicop=ers, his business interests extend worldwide and he has pursued important 
contra=ts in South and North America and Canada, South Africa, Europe, the Middle Eas= and Far East. 
Once a year I do a tour of the world taking in everything and anywhere, includin= China and Indonesia, he says. 
As most business dealings see him mixing with the royal and the rich - they ar= people who own private aircraft the 
world over - Cardini frequently becomes=20 involved in other areas of business and during a visit to Bahrain where 
has=was among invited Formula One spectators in April, he found himself in discussi=ns with Ruling Family members 
over local involvement with the Washington-based=20 Prostate Cancer Foundation. It is dedicated to globally finding 
better treatments and a cure for the sickness that affects 230,000 new men each year. 
Yet in Cardini's life, chance opportunities are frequent. Destiny is a strange=20 thing, for through meeting people all over 
the world, anywhere from on plan=s, socially and in business talks, I often find myself almost as a special env=y, he says. 
I meet somebody - obviously confidentiality is all-important on many occasion= - and then through networking things 
begin to happen for I have friends and=20 contacts at the very highest levels in many various fields. 
With a family home in Verona, Italy as well as property in Florence where he spe=t part of his schooling, Cardini 
estimates he travels at least 150 days each=20 year. 
I travel so much I do not have a favourite country, but clearly identify with=20 being happy where I am. Equally though I 
am never totally settled anywhere=20 because I am addicted to travel so I do not stay in a place for six months =n end.
