MWC 2014: It is an LTE world 
S2N #491 - LTE proliferation and cheaper handsets push data demand 
The buzz returned this year to Mobile World Congress and we contributed as 
best we could, running between meetings, downing café con leches and 
snacking on jamon sandwiches. What was different was the focus of the buzz, 
which if last year was centered on smartphone growth and LTE unit volumes, 
then this year it was infrastructure. Almost every network equipment vendor 
we met with sounded optimistic about operator spending in the year ahead, 
especially with regard to LTE. 
State of the Baseband number two still undecided 
As most of our readers know, we suggested a few months ago that Quakomm 
would see little competition in 2014. In short, Mobile World Congress only 
reinforced this viewpoint. We met with most of the merchant baseband 
players and a number of industry contacts across the handset foodchain, and 
what is increasingly clear to us, is that this year the fight will be for a foothold, 
in hopes to make a play for meaningful volume, and the second spot, behind 
Qualcomm in 2015. While we have argued that Mediatek was the clear 
number two behind Quakomm (they remain so in unit volumes and profits), 
this point has been muddied a bit by the mixed progress in LTE of a few 
others. Bottom line - all of QCOM's competitors have their challenges, which 
we detail inside. 
Smartphones high end struggles to differentiate. while Firefox redefines cheap 
It is strikingly obvious that differentiating on the high-end with hardware is 
limited. Every major handset OEM at the show had shiny new handsets (and 
tablets), as well as a wearable to go along with it. The good news for many 
across the globe is that smartphones are only getting cheaper. Firefox (Mozilla) 
took this one step further, introducing a $25 smartphone at the show. 
The front-end end uanx. 
Last year we suggested that there would be consolidation in the frontend 
space, engineered by the active players - a result of Qualcomm's then 
announcement of RF 360. Before the show, RFMD announced a bid for 
Triquint. We do not feel like this is the end of the match-making, possibly with 
Triquint, and certainly outside of this deal, with other players attempting to 
redefine their own positions. Bottom line, the front end active players are 
merging with the front-end passive players (and other active players) in an 
attempt to develop fully integrated FEM's to compete with Qualcomm. 
Infrastructure poised for growth: 
Almost every network equipment vendor we met with sounded optimistic 
about operator spending in the year ahead. With LTE rollouts continuing 
around the globe, and beginning in earnest in places like Europe, China, Africa 
and CALA, we believe this will be a solid year for infrastructure spend. 
Stock implications 
We left MWC feeling incrementally positive on OCOM (limited LTE competition), FFIV 
(tisk° wins raising price target to $130), COMM (LIT builds), and MVNR (VoLTE builds), 
constructive on LIEN (see our separate preview note). neutral but constructive on RKUS 
(cable traction), CAVM (small cells), PSMI (CMOS PA performance) ADNC (Motion 0), 
slightly more cautious on CSCO (SP execution) BBRY (increasing security competition) 
and XXiA (testing vinualization)
