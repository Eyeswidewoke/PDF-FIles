Sen. Chuck Grassley Reiterates Plans to Investigate DOJ, FBI Over Trump Indictments 
The Gazette (07/09, Hoff) reported that Iowa U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley said Wednesday he is committed to 
investigating the members of the DOJ and the FBI who served during the Biden administration over indictments 
against President Donald Trump. Grassley mentioned the investigation during Trump's visit to Des Moines on July 
3 at an event to kick off a yearlong event celebrating 250 years of American independence. Speaking to the 
crowded audience, Grassley doubled down on his investigation into federal indictments against Trump, which he 
referred to as "political weaponization." According to the article, during a press call Wednesday, Grassley, who 
chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, told reporters that he believes wrongdoing by federal prosecutors and 
investigators that he has pointed out rises to "the criminal level" after it was reported that the FBI is investigating 
former CIA director John Brennan and former FBI Director James Comey over possible false statements to 
Congress. "I can't say that the wrongdoing I have pointed out so far is more in the area of political weaponization of 
the FBI and the Department of Justice, and I can't say it rose to the criminal level, but evidently the Department of 
Justice has reason to believe that crime has been committed, and I'll have to defer to them. That's their job, not 
mine," Grassley told reporters. "My focus is on transparency and accountability for the American people."
