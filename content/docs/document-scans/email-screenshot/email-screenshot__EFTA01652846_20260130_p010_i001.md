ABVD chemotherapy, used to treat Hodgkin 
lymphoma, can cause a variety of side effects, 
both short-term and long-term. Common short-
term side effects include hair loss, low blood 
counts, nausea, vomiting, and mucositis. Long-
term side effects can include infertility, 
neuropathy, and increased risk of other 
cancers. 
Common Short-Term Side Effects: 
Hair Loss: 
Hair loss is a very common side effect, affecting a 
significant portion of patients. * 
Low Blood Counts: 
ABVD can suppress the bone marrow, leading to low 
white blood cell counts (increased risk of infection), 
low red blood cell counts (anemia), and low platelet 
counts (increased risk of bleeding and bruising). * 
Nausea and Vomiting: 
These can occur during treatment and may be 
managed with anti-emetic medications. * 
Mucositis: 
This involves inflammation and sores in the mouth, 
throat, and digestive tract. 
Fatigue:
Feeling tired and weak is a common experience 
during and after treatment. * 
Prof Cough; 
Bleomycin, one of the drugs in ABVD, can cause a dry 
cough. 
Neuropathy:
Numbness or tingling in the fingers and toes can 
occur, especially with bleomycin. 9

During chemotherapy for stage 3 lymphoma. just following brain radiation surgery for a separate cancer/brain tumor. just after being SAd by my own council...Sigrid McCawley and 
David BOIES FORCED ME to file the affidavit which initiated Epstein's arrest. They claimed they would get Wexner for me in exchange for using my legal name and that I could 
testify in front of Congress. Neither promise was fulfilled. (Brad laughed when I told him I had been diagnosed with a brain tumor and lost all hearing in right car. Stan said Brad 
declared my only health problem was "fat", yet I actually had 2 cancers and extreme inflammation). 
They used me to file the affidavit and used my name (knowing I had hidden 23 years from MaxwellAVexner/Epstein/TrumpiClinton/Dershowitz/Guggenheimietc...), then told me I 
was too shameful to testify. They based this "shame" on my description of the elites surrounding Epstein, as I was asked by an irresponsible "independent journalist" who recorded 
me illegally. She claimed it was for "book research". To this day this hack has used illegally recording me with brain trauma to declare herselfITIE SOURCE on Epstein, and now 
this bleeds over to her being THE SOURCE on Diddy and THE SOURCE on Tate. e) 
Simultaneously, while shaming me, BSF used my mother and sister to testify in the federal trial enabled by my 1996 & 2006 FBI/NY PD reports. They then sought compensation 
only for JANE DOE culpable long term 6-13 year Epstein employees who did "sex work" as adults. They used my name and never rewarded me. They used my sister's and never 
rewarded her. THEY PUNISHED US INSTEAD. They grotesquely provided compensation to the coconspirators who stayed YEARS-ON-PURPOSE, while also guarding the names 
of these culpable female adults.
