article, Director Patel touted the FBI's record under his leadership, citing tens of thousands of arrests, a crackdown 
on illicit drugs, and efforts to "crush violent crime and defend the homeland," while challenging critics to "bring it 
on" if they questioned his 16 years of service. Democratic senators, including Dick Durbin and Mazie Hirono, 
criticized Director Patel over alleged "loyalty tests," mass firings, physical fitness standards for agents, and what 
they described as deference to President Trump. The article noted that Director Patel dismissed these attacks, 
arguing the FBI remains focused on its mission and asserting, "I'm not going anywhere." 
DOJ Ended Probe of `Border Czar' Tom Homan for Allegedly Accepting $SOK in FBI Sting 
MSNBC (09/20, Leonnig, Dilanian) reported that Tom Homan, the White House border czar, was investigated by the 
FBI for accepting $50,000 in cash from undercover agents posing as business executives. According to the 
article, the investigation, which began in 2024, was shut down by the Trump Justice Department after Homan 
became border czar, despite evidence of a potential bribery case. The article explained that Homan had promised 
to help the undercover agents secure government contracts in exchange for the money, once he was in a position 
of power in a potential second Trump administration. In a statement provided to MSNBC, Director Patel and Deputy 
Attorney General Todd Blanche said, "This matter originated under the previous administration and was subjected 
to a full review by FBI agents and Justice Department prosecutors. They found no credible evidence of any criminal 
wrongdoing. The Department's resources must remain focused on real threats to the American people, not 
baseless investigations. As a result, the investigation has been closed." Additional reporting was provided by News

President Trump Ramps up Retribution Campaign With Push for AG Bondi to Pursue Cases Against His 
Foes 
The Associated Press (09/21, Kinnard) reported that President Donald Trump has escalated his campaign for 
retribution against political opponents, publicly urging AG Bondi on social media to advance investigations into his 
adversaries, including a possible threat case involving former FBI Director James Comey. Trump posted that 
"nothing is being done" on investigations into some of his foes. "We can't delay any longer, it's killing our 
reputation and credibility," he said. Noting that he was impeached and criminally charged, "JUSTICE MUST BE 
SERVED, NOWIII" He posted that he had "reviewed over 30 statements and posts" that he characterized as 
criticizing his administration for a lack of action on investigations. "We have to act fast — one way or the other," 
Trump told reporters later that night at the White House. "They're guilty, they're not guilty — we have to act fast. If 
they're not guilty, that's fine. If they are guilty or if they should be charged, they should be charged. And we have 
to do it now." According to the article, critics such as Sen. Chris Murphy argued that Trump's moves risk turning 
federal law enforcement into a tool for punishing opponents and undermining democratic norms, while Sen. Rand 
Paul warned against "lawfare in all forms." The article also highlighted new Pentagon restrictions on journalists 
requiring them to pledge not to report unauthorized information, as well as the FCC chairman's warning to ABC 
over Jimmy Kimmel's comments about Charlie Kirk's killing before ABC suspended Kimmel's show. The article noted 
that these actions have raised broader concerns about free speech, censorship, and the use of federal power to 
intimidate critics in Trump's second term. Additional reporting on the story was provided by ABC News (09/21,

Trump Nominates White House Aide to Be Top U.S. Prosecutor for Office Probing Letitia James 
The Associated Press (09/20, Richer, Kinnard) reported that President Trump announced he would nominate senior 
White House aide Lindsey Halligan to serve as U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia after the office's top 
prosecutor, Erik Siebert, resigned amid pressure from Trump administration officials to bring charges against New 
York Attorney General Letitia James in a mortgage fraud probe. The article explained that the investigation has so 
far produced no evidence warranting criminal charges, with James' attorneys denouncing it as political retaliation. 
According to the article, Halligan previously served as one of Trump's attorneys during the FBI's investigation into 
his handling of classified documents at Mar-a-Lago and was recently involved in a White House effort to address
