the most prestigious colleg= in Saint Petersburg receiving a full merit scholarship. I was afraid to s=atter the image of 
myself that I had so carefully crafted. 
Since there were not many places or websites were LGBT community c=uld interact and meet others, my wife and 
myself, decided to create a some=hat secret society using the Internet. Currently, we are developing =ur own website 
for LGBT people around the world, especially for those who =iving in isolated areas such as former Soviet Union's. Our 
mission wit= this website is to create an interactive social platform where gays, lesb=ans and transgender can 
communicate freely with each other and make friend=. The name of the website is Unq.one as it perfectly defines who 
we are. H=wever, the challenging part of this project was to advertise our sit= to Russian-speaking users letting them 
know that we exist. Any attempts t= use the internet to expand politically unpopular views are usually =C2 suppressed 
by the authorities The Internet domains in countries=of former Soviet Union are tracked and can be shut off even to a 
slight hi=t on LGBT. Thus, we also created a specially customized application for iP=one and android that can't be be as 
easily blocked as IP. =AO Although the entire investment into this project came from our ow= budget, the website will 
be completely free for our users. We believe tha= someday our social network will expand and become successful and 
that the=e will be people who will want to support our project. 
While my primary goal is a career in environmental sustainability and=its areas of influence. I feel that as the world is 
joined more closely on=the internet, the differences are more accentuated rather than diminished.=Having served in 
senior positions in both Harvard and the United Nations d=aling with water scarcitywa a major accomplishment , I spoke 
with the high=st ranking diplomats about water issues in the same hushed tones as =ere once reserved for racial and 
sexual differences that underlie most of =y life 
While my life were taking me from one plac= to another, I learned to understand the world and myself in a completely 
=ifferent way. My experience of leading was emotionally and cognitively int=nse but in return, my identity changed in a 
very fundamental way. I have n=w come to understand who I am and what I am capable of doing.
