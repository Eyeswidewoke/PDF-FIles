Axios (7/30, Treene, 521K) reports, "FBI Director Christopher Wray and other intelligence 
community officials warned about China's increased capability to interfere in U.S. elections in 
separate classified hearings with the Senate Intelligence Committee this week, two sources 
familiar with the hearings tell Axios." Wray and other officials "cited concerns that China is 
developing the ability to interfere with local election systems and target members of Congress 
to influence China policy, sources said." Wray "briefed committee members on Tuesday 
afternoon, and the other intel officials, including William Evanina, the director of the National 
Counterintelligence and Security Center (NCSC) briefed them on Wednesday. An official with the 
Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which includes the NCSC, said it has been 
providing `robust intelligence-based briefings on election security to the presidential campaigns, 
political committees, and Congressional audiences' but declined to comment on the details." 
The Washington Examiner (7/30, Dunleavy, 448K) reports that "following last week's 
revelation by" Evanina "that the U.S. intelligence community is most concerned about China, 
Russia, and Iran seeking to meddle in November's election and" Director Wray "reportedly 
warning the Senate Intelligence Committee this week about the Chinese government's growing 
ability to interference in U.S. elections, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo testified to the Senate 
Foreign Relations Committee on Thursday that Beijing has not just the capability but the 
intention of conducting influence operations inside the United States." 
Pompeo Says Tech Leaders Must Be Aware China Steals IP. CNBC (7/30, Macias, 
3.62M) reports on its website that in an appearance before the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee on Thursday, Secretary of State Pompeo "slammed U.S. tech companies...for their 
lack of transparency in regards to the breadth and depth of intellectual property theft the 
Chinese government conducts on American industries." Pompeo is quoted as saying, "The idea 
that anyone in the tech space could not know of what the Chinese Communist Party is 
attempting to steal and the cyberattacks they are making seems incredulous to me."

that the Department of Justice investigate and determine whether Zoom and TikTok's business 
relationships, data handling practices, and operational connections to China pose a risk to 
Americans." The senators charged that "both Zoom and TikTok have failed to answer even basic 
questions about their business operations, including who has access to personal information 
and when they comply with request from China or other governments."
