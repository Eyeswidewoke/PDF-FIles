Ohio attorney general called a string of burglaries at multimillion-dollar homes. But he declined to say whether 
professional athletes were the targets. The article indicated that Nezhinskiy, 43, a Georgian national who lives in 
North Bergen, New Jersey, and Villar, 48, of the Queens section of New York City, were arrested Tuesday and are 
scheduled to be arraigned in court Wednesday. They are charged with multiple counts of receiving stolen goods. 
The article noted that prosecutors said a large amount of suspected stolen property was found at the two men's 
business and at storage units in New Jersey belonging to Nezhinskiy. The article quoted FBI Assistant Director in 
Charge James E. Dennehy, who said, "For almost five years, Dimitriy Nezhinskiy and Juan Villar allegedly served as 
unlawful brokers to perpetuate the sale of stolen luxury items by purchasing them from burglary crews. The 
defendants' alleged actions incentivized highly organized South American Theft Groups to continue their 
meticulous looting scheme against a myriad of affluent residences and businesses across the country. With our law 
enforcement partners, the FBI will continue to dismantle any criminal activity curated to capitalize on victims' 
losses and establish an economic demand for ill-obtained merchandise within our city." CBS News (02/04, Bauman, 
ganger) detailed that FBI agents executed a search warrant Tuesday at the second-floor Diamond District pawn 
shop the two operate, where they allegedly fenced the stolen goods. NBC News (02/04, Dienst, et al.), ABC News

Man Pleads Guilty to Federal Charges for Firing Gun Outside Jewish Temple in Upstate New York 
The Associated Press (02/04, Hill) reported that a 29-year-old man pleaded guilty to federal charges Tuesday for 
firing a shotgun outside an upstate New York synagogue during the early months of the Israel-Hamas war. The 
article explained that Mufid Fawaz Alkhader was arrested in December 2023 after firing two shots in the air and 
shouting "Free Palestine!" outside Temple Israel of Albany. Alkhader's shotgun jammed before he could fire a third 
time. The Iraqi-born U.S. citizen was arrested soon after and complained about events in the Middle East, according 
to federal prosecutors. The article noted that the gunfire in New York's capital city happened on the first night of 
Hanukkah and two months after the surprise incursion by Hamas triggered the war. No one was injured, but 61 
children attending preschool sheltered in place while police searched the area. Prosecutors said Alkhader took a 
ride-share vehicle to the temple from his home in nearby Schenectady. The article stated that under a deal with 
prosecutors, Alkhader pleaded guilty to obstructing the free exercise of religious beliefs by threat of force, 
brandishing a firearm during the commission of that offense and conspiring to purchase a firearm unlawfully. The 
article mentioned that federal prosecutors initially charged Alkhader with possession of a firearm by a prohibited 
person — a charge authorities said was related to his admitted use of marijuana. He was later charged with 
conspiracy to make a false statement during the purchase of a firearm. Alkhader, who is being held in the county 
jail, faces at least 7 years and up to life in prison when he is sentenced June 6. A DOJ press release quoted Special 
Agent in Charge Craig Tremaroli of the FBI Albany Field Office, who said, "Mr. Alkhader's plea confirms his 
deliberate and premeditated intentions to illegally acquire a gun and use it to bring terror to the Temple Israel 
community as they were preparing to celebrate the first night of Hanukkah. Thanks to the swift actions of the 
Temple Israel community and our law enforcement partners, justice has been served. The FBI remains steadfast in 
our mission to ensure all our communities can live without fear of hateful violence." USA Today (02/04, Nguyen) 
and Times Union (02/04, Tine) also reported on the story. 
Tennessee Star Says FBI Considering Offer to Drop Suit, End in Release of Covenant Shooter's Writings 
WSMV (NBC-4) (02/04, Wethington) reported that the Tennessee Star is reporting that the FBI is now considering 
an offer to release the full writings of the Covenant School shooter for the publication to drop a lawsuit. The article 
explained that The Star's CEO, Michael Patrick Leahy, posted on X that they received a letter from the Department 
of Justice confirming their consideration of the offer. However, the full terms of the offer have not been made 
public. The article mentioned that there have been ongoing battles in state and federal court over the release of 
the writings since the shooting occurred in March 2023. The Star sued the FBI, wanting its copy of the writings 
released. The article noted that parents of the children who attend The Covenant School have continuously pushed 
against the release of the writings. So, everything has been tied up in litigation for nearly two years and some of 
the pages have been leaked. Some of those leaks came from the Tennessee Star. The article added that the 
reporting outlet has reached out to the FBI for confirmation of Leahy's post and more details on the alleged offer.
