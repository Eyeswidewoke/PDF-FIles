FBI Arrests Man Accused Of Colliding Drone With LAPD Helicopter. 
The Los Angeles Times (11/19, Winton, 4.64M) reports Andrew Rene Hernandez, 22, accused of 
"recklessly operating a drone and crashing it into a Los Angeles Police Department helicopter 
earlier this year" was arrested by the FBI on Thursday. Hernandez was "charged with unsafe 
operation of an unmanned aircraft after an investigation by the FBI, the LAPD and the Federal 
Aviation Administration." The incident took place on September 18 after Los Angeles police 
officers "responding to a predawn burglary call at a Hollywood pharmacy requested air 
support." 
The AP (11/19) reports, "FBI special agents arrested...Hernandez...on a complaint 
charging him with one count of unsafe operation of an unmanned aircraft, a statement said. 
The complaint states that police officers responding to a burglary call at a Hollywood pharmacy 
on Sept. 18 requested air support. The police helicopter was approaching the pharmacy when 
the pilot saw the drone and unsuccessfully attempted to evade it. The helicopter's nose, 
antenna and bottom cowlings were damaged. The complaint states that if the drone had struck 
the main rotor it could have brought down the helicopter." Officers "found parts of the drone on 
the ground and a vehicle that had been damaged as it fell from the sky," and "the drone's 
camera and memory card led to identification of Hernandez as the operator, the U.S. attorney's 
office said." 
The Los Angeles Daily News (11/19, Escobar, 232K) reports, "Hernandez admitted to 
flying the drone - controlled by a device attached to his smartphone - to 'see what was going 
on,' according to the department. There is no indication that Hernandez, who lives nearby, was 
involved in the pharmacy burglary, according to Thom Mrozek, a spokesman for the U.S. 
Attorney's Office. Authorities are concerned about illegal drone activity, he said." KTLA-TV Los 
Angeles (11/19, Wenzke, 766K) also reports on its website. 
Three Former Philadelphia Revenue Employees Charged After FBI Sting. 
The Inquirer (PA) (11/19, Steele, 347K) reports, "Three former employees of Philadelphia's 
Department of Revenue were charged Thursday by federal prosecutors with soliciting and 
accepting bribes." The employees "were caught in an FBI sting operation, according to charges 
outlined by federal prosecutors." They all "accepted bribes in exchange for erasing fees owed by 
taxpayers, U.S. Attorney William McSwain and Philadelphia Inspector General Alexander 
DeSantis said in their announcement." FBI Philadelphia Division Special Agent in Charge Michael 
3. Driscoll said, "When municipal employees decide to take bribes, they're openly putting their 
own interests above those of the city they serve. ... The defendants' alleged actions benefited 
themselves and those who paid them off, at the expense of Philadelphia's revenues and its 
residents." Also reporting is WHYY-TV Philadelphia (11/19, Scott, 24K).

pornography," and the FBI "believes there are more victims." FBI Agent Pao Mei Fisher said the 
tutor "'mailed, transported and shipped' the child pornography maintained on his iPhone from 
his home in Westchester County to Fairfield County in Connecticut, according to the sworn 
statement." The man "has worked at several locations over the years," and has "done private 
tutoring for more than 30 years in the Bronx, Westchester County and in Connecticut, according 
to the FBI."
