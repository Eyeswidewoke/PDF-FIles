P. S. 
Of course, complex development of themes and counter and sub themes and so forth is not exclusive to Western 
classical music.... For instance this 30 minute instrumental-rock song composed by Buckethead in memoriam for his 
mother has incredible subtlety of development 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5PXYehriYY 
... so many themes introduced in the first half and then complexly, genetically crossed over and synergized in the second 
half.. It is my firm conviction that Buckethead will be remembered as the Beethoven of the early 21st century ;) 
For me the ultimate is Prometheus, by Scriabin, though...

do you know it? Wow.... This is cognitive and emotional development 
beyond the ordinary human level, such as only a true genius madman 
could produce. I had an amazing mental experience in San Francisco 
in 2012 listening to Prometheus 10 times in succession ... try it sometime...
