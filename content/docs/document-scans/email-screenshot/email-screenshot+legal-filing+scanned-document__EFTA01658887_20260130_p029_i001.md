Judge Provides DOJ With Single Day To Explain Why Woman's Execution Should Not 
Be Put Off Due To COVID Infections Among Lawyers. 
The Washington Times (11/13, Mordock, 492K) reports US District Judge Randolph Moss on 
Friday "gave the Justice Department just one day to explain why the scheduled execution of the 
only woman on federal death row should not be postponed because her lawyers have 
contracted serious cases of COVID-19." Government attorneys requested Randolph for 
additional "time to make their case, saying they needed until Wednesday to file their 
arguments." Moss, "however, was unmoved, saying the dispute has to move quickly so lawyers 
for Lisa Montgomery could still have time to appeal her execution." 
Democratic Legislators Press Administration To Cease Federal Executions During 
Presidential Transition. The Washington Times (11/13, Mordock, 492K) reports a number of 
Democratic legislators on Friday pressed the Administration "to suspend all federal executions 
during the transition of power to presumptive President-elect Joseph R. Biden." The Democrats 
"say Mr. Biden deserves an opportunity to evaluate the death penalty, which was restarted 
earlier this year by Attorney General William P. Barr." In a letter to Barr, the legislators said, "A 
record number of Americans voted in favor of President-Elect Biden and Vice-President Elect 
Harris and they deserve an opportunity to implement their policy agenda without the Trump 
administration rushing into to take preemptive steps." According to the Times, "The letter was 
signed by Democratic Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey, Patrick Leahy of Vermont, Dick Durbin 
of Illinois, and Rep. Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts." 
Maryland Judiciary Halts Jury Trials For Remainder Of 2020 Amid Rising Coronavirus 
Cases. 
The Washington Post (11/13, Mettler, Morse, 14.2M) reports, "As coronavirus cases continue to 
surge nationwide and across the Washington region, the Maryland Judiciary announced this 
week that it will reimpose certain restrictions on court operations - shifting some proceedings 
back online and halting jury trials through the end of the year." The Post adds that "since early 
October, the courts had been operating normally under the freedom designated in the 
judiciary's fifth phase of progressive reopening." However, the return to Phase 3 "will go into 
effect Monday and last through Dec. 31. Under the new guidelines, grand juries can continue at 
the discretion of administrative judges and new grand juries can be empaneled." Jury trials that 
had been slated to commence during that timeframe "will be rescheduled, the orders say. Trials 
that have already empaneled a jury may continue." The Post adds, "All other jury trials are 
expected to resume Jan. 4." 
Arlington's Leading Prosecutor, Public Defender Engaged In Legal Challenges To 
County Judge. 
The Washington Post (11/13, Weiner, 14.2M) says that Arlington residents in 2019 voted in "a 
progressive top prosecutor backed by the county's public defender." The Post adds, "Now 
Commonwealth's Attorney Parisa Dehghani-Tafti and Public Defender Brad Haywood are 
engaged in an unusual set of legal challenges to one county judge." Dehghani-Tafti on Monday 
"filed a motion in circuit court challenging Judge Daniel S. Fiore II's handling of a plea 
agreement her office offered to a man allegedly found with 50 pounds of marijuana at Reagan 
National Airport. Separately, Haywood recently went to the Virginia Supreme Court and accused 
Fiore of violating his clients' due process rights in ways that are `basic and rare' by refusing to 
schedule hearings for some defendants who are asking to be released from jail on bond or to 
have their sentences reconsidered."
