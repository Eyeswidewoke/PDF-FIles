Local Charges Dropped as Feds Target Venezuelan Accused of Posing as Teen at Ohio High School 
Fox News (05/29, Price) reported that an illegal immigrant from Venezuela who was allegedly caught posing as 
a high school student in Ohio will no longer face local charges and is now being prosecuted in a federal 
court. Anthony Labrador-Sierra, 24, was arrested May 21, after he allegedly enrolled in a public high school using 
fraudulent documents. According to the article, on Thursday, the Perrysburg Municipal Court confirmed to Fox 
News Digital all local charges had been dropped against Labrador-Sierra and that his case had been handed over to 
federal authorities. The article added that according to a criminal complaint, Perrysburg Schools reported to the 
Perrysburg Police Department that they had received information that Labrador-Sierra, a student attending 
Perrysburg High School, was actually a 24-year-old man who fraudulently enrolled. Detectives worked with U.S. 
Customs and Border Protection and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and discovered Labrador-
Sierra is a 24-year-old from Venezuela. The article mentioned that Sen. Bernie Moreno, (R-OH), called the discovery 
and allegations "shocking." The senator shared a letter he sent to Department of Homeland Security (DHS) 
Secretary Kristi Noem and Director Patel on X, writing, "Unreal. Thanks to Joe Biden's abuse of TPS, a 24-year-old 
illegal alien was caught on a fake asylum claim pretending to be a teenager at a high school in Ohio."

Cash Reward Hiked to $50,000 as Manhunt Continues for Two New Orleans Jail Escapees Still at Large 
CBS News (05/29, Weis) reported that as the search continues for the last two New Orleans jail escapees who are 
still at large, several agencies have pitched in to increase the cash reward for information leading to their 
arrests. The reward has been hiked to $50,000 per escapee, authorities announced Thursday, a hefty increase from 
the $20,000 amount that had been in place for more than a week following the brazen May 16 escape of 10 
inmates from the Orleans Justice Center. Eight of the 10 have been captured. According to the article, one of the 
men still at large — Derrick Groves — was convicted of murder for the shooting deaths of Jamar Robinson and 
Byron Jackson in 2024. The other escapee — Antoine Massey — was being held on charges of domestic abuse 
involving strangulation prior to the jailbreak. Louisiana State Police Col. Robert Hodges said in a news conference 
Thursday that while he does not believe Groves or Massey have the resources to flee the U.S., they may have 
escaped Louisiana thanks to the help from other potential accomplices, and given the amount of time that has 
passed. Authorities said even some family members of the 10 escapees have called in with tips to help track down 
the escapees. "Some of you might be reporting a friend, a loved one, a relative," said Jonathan Tapp, Special Agent 
in Charge of the FBI New Orleans Field Office, during the news conference. "It might not be easy." The article noted 
that officials with the U.S. Marshals Service, the FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, 
Louisiana State Police and the New Orleans Police Department said Thursday they remain laser-focused on getting 
Massey and Groves back in cuffs. ABC News (05/29, Deliso), WWL (CBS-4) (05/29, Moses), Nola.com (05/29, 
Wilkinson), NBC News (05/29, Burke), and CNN (05/29, Yan) also reported on the story.
