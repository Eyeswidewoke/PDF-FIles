The Austin (TX) American Statesman (8/24, Hall, Subscription Publication, 343K) reports, "A 
grand jury last week delivered Travis County District Attorney Margaret Moore's first indictment 
in a law enforcement shooting in the case of a former state trooper accused of wounding a 
driver in 2018." The American Statesman adds, "Austin Johnston, who was a Department of 
Public Safety trooper in September 2018, shot Dustin Dougherty in the back after Dougherty 
had rammed a pickup truck into Johnston's vehicle, according to court documents. Dougherty 
backed up onto the hood of Johnston's vehicle, according to Johnston's lawyers. Dougherty 
survived and later pleaded guilty to aggravated assault on a public servant with a deadly 
weapon, records show. Johnston was not injured during the incident." On Friday, Johnston, 
"now an FBI special agent," was "indicted on charges of aggravated assault by a public servant, 
deadly conduct and tampering with physical evidence, his lawyers said." 
Scheduled Execution Of Navajo Man Raises Sovereignty Concerns. 
The Arizona Republic (8/24, Castle, 869K) reports, "For nearly two decades, an Arizona man 
has sat in prison awaiting a sentence no other Native American has faced in modern history: a 
federal execution." Federal authorities are "scheduled to execute Lezmond Mitchell, a 38-year-
old member of the Navajo Nation, in Indiana on Aug. 26," and "people around the country are 
raising concerns over whether it's even legal under tribal sovereignty laws. Mitchell is the only 
Native American on federal death row. He was convicted of the murder of grandmother Alyce 
Slim, 63, and her granddaughter Tiffany Lee, 9, in 2001." The Republic adds, "The Navajo 
Nation has consistently objected to the federal government pursuing the death penalty against 
Mitchell."
