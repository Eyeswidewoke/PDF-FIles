The Independent (05/21, Keller) reported that a man was fatally shot in Washington, D.C., Tuesday, just steps away 
from an elementary school track meet, sending dozens of children and parents scrambling for safety and prompting

elementary school track and field championships. The suspects left the area in a car, which was later found burned

FBI Atlanta Warns of Scam Targeting International Students 
WABE (05/21, Felto, Murry) reported that the FBI's Atlanta office is warning of a scam targeting international 
students who are legally in the United States. This comes as Immigration and Customs Enforcement canceled —
and then said it would restore — hundreds of student visas across the country. According to a May 13 FBI release, 
the scammers impersonate agents from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Homeland Security 
Investigations (HSI) or U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) as a way to build credibility. From there, 
the perpetrators tell the students that they are in violation of their student visas. Victims are then threatened with 
prosecution or deportation if they do not pay a fine that the scammers claim is used to process immigration 
paperwork, pay university registration fees or pay a legal fee. 
Human Remains Found by Hunter Belong to Missing Utah Woman Who Disappeared in 2023 
USA TODAY (05/21, Alund) reported that remains found along a Utah mountain range have been identified as 
belonging to Courtney Lynne Townsend, a local woman reported missing nearly two years ago. According to the 
article, on May 8, a hunter discovered human remains on Cedar Mountain, and after alerting authorities about the 
finding, law enforcement responded to the area and retrieved them, the Kane County Sheriffs Office reported this 
week. The mountain is in Tooele County, about 160 miles southeast of Salt Lake City. According to a May 19 sheriffs 
office release, authorities transported the remains to the Utah State Medical Examiner's Office, where they were 
positively identified as belonging to Townsend. According to a fundraiser created by her sister, Dallas Jimenez, her 
family continues to seek answers in her disappearance and death. "Please help us with solving her case," Jimenez 
wrote on the page, which as of May 21, had raised more than $5,000 to help hire a private investigator. "Courtney's 
death remains mysterious and suspicious despite the involvement of authorities, including the FBI. While they 
claim to have exhausted all resources, we still have no answers — and the family deserves justice." 
Former Arkansas Judge Sentenced to Prison for Falsifying Statements to FBI 
THV (CBS-11) (05/21, Godinez) reported that an Arkansas man who has previously served as a judge, prosecutor, 
and defense attorney has now been sentenced to prison for making false statements to the FBI. According to 
reports, 64-year-old Thomas David Carruth served as an elected Monroe County district court judge and presided 
over both criminal and civil matters. The article added that reports say that in April 2022, Carruth allegedly met 
with the girlfriend of a defendant in a criminal case, and she sought his help in getting her boyfriend's case 
dismissed. The girlfriend recorded video evidence where Carruth reportedly solicited sex and a lingerie show from 
her in exchange for him helping out her boyfriend. A jury later uncovered that when he was questioned by the FBI, 
Carruth lied to agents about the incident and falsely stated that he did not "request," "ask," "offer", make 
"overturels] about", "insinuate," or "even [think] about," sex with the girlfriend. Ultimately, the jury convicted him 
of one count of making false statements. Carruth was acquitted of charges of honest services fraud, bribery, and 
violations of the travel act. Carruth will now spend the next 24 months in federal prison for making false 
statements to the FBI.

concrete work that was completed at the station three or four years ago. "It appears to be related to building 
maintenance, and we do not handle that," Horan added.
