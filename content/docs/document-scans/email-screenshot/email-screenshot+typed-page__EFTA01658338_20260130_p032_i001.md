frequent tactics - pushing evidence-deficient claims, interweaving political attacks with policy 
announcements - only to revert within days." 
WPost Analysis: Trump One Factor In Nation's "Fraught Relationship With Masks." 
The Washington Post (7/28, Witte, Cha, Dawsey, 14.2M) looks at the nation's "fraught 
relationship with masks," writing that "faulty guidance from health authorities, a cultural 
aversion to masks and a deeply polarized politics have all contributed" to skepticism, as has "a 
president who resisted role modeling the benefits of face coverings, and who belittled those 
who did. The result, experts say, is a country that squandered one of its best opportunities to 
beat back the coronavirus pandemic this spring and summer." The Wall Street Journal (7/28, 
Hufford, Williams, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) runs a feature titled "How Face Masks Work 
And Which Types Offer The Best Covid-19 Protection." 
Transportation Unions Seek Mandate Mask Requirements On Planes, Buses, 
Trains. The Washington Post (7/28, Duncan, 14.2M) reports the Transportation Trades 
Department, a coalition of 33 unions, formally asked the Transportation Department this week 
"to issue an emergency rule ordering passengers to wear masks on planes, buses and trains or 
be denied a ride." 
Politico Analysis: Pandemic Is Pushing Biden, Democrats To Left On Healthcare. 
Politico (7/28, Ollstein, 4.29M) reports in an analysis that the coronavirus pandemic and the 
resulting "economic devastation...are pushing Joe Biden and the Democratic Party further to the 
left on health care," it "may not be far enough for some progressives." Politico says Biden is 
"inching closer to the Bernie Sanders wing of the party without embracing 'Medicare for All,' by 
proposing to lower the eligibility age of the entitlement program from 65 to 60 and potentially 
extend government coverage to an additional 23 million people." In addition, Biden is "backing 
a robust government-run public health insurance option that would auto-enroll low-income 
people who lose their jobs and provide another choice for Americans covered under Obamacare 
or at their job." Politico says the proposals "could tamp down the kind of infighting that roiled 
Democrats in the leadup to 2008 and 2016 elections," but "they come as emboldened 
progressives" are demanding the party embrace "Medicare for All" in its platform. 
Third Church Will Take Challenge To State Worship Restrictions To Supreme Court. 
The Washington Examiner (7/28, Rowan, 448K) reports that Elim Romanian Pentecostal Church 
in Chicago "on Tuesday announced its intentions to appeal to the Supreme Court, following an 
unfavorable ruling from an Illinois federal appeals court upholding Gov. J.B. Pritzker's worship 
ban." The church "has been embroiled in a legal war with Chicago and the state of Illinois since 
early May when it began opposing the 10-person limit on in-person services." If the Supreme 
Court accepts the case, it will be "the first coronavirus church closure case to reach the highest 
court." The Court "has rejected two emergency injunctions filed by churches in California and 
Nevada" since May. 
Future Of MLB Season In Doubt Amid COVID Outbreak. 
NBC Nightly NewsVi (7/28, story 11, 1:20, Holt, 6.05M) reported that the new Major League 
Baseball season's future "is already in doubt." NBC (Brock) added that the league announced 
Tuesday that "the Miami Marlins' games are postponed through Sunday, after four more players 
tested positive for COVID-19, taking the total to 15 since opening day, or roughly half the 
team's traveling roster. ... The league says its positivity rate through last Thursday is below 1%, 
as it tries to keep an infectious disease from stopping sports."
