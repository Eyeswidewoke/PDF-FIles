poisoning, Russia has "accused Navalny of working with" the CIA, "prompting the pro-
government Federal News Agency to report that Navalny could be guilty of treason." Volkov 
said, "We see all kinds of intimidation by them: 'let's arrest his apartment ... let's open cases 
into state treason," adding it is "clear these are all just fakes designed to intimidate." 
House Independent Throws Support Behind Resolution Clearing Snowden, Assange. 
The Washington Times (10/21, Blake, 492K) reports that Rep. Justin Amash (I-MI) on 
Wednesday supported "congressional resolutions calling for the U.S. government to abandon its 
cases against wanted leakers Edward J. Snowden and Julian Assange." Amash announced "he 
signed on to become a co-sponsor of separate, similar resolutions urging the government to 
drop the charges facing the two secret-spillers." The resolutions were introduced by Rep. Tulsi 
Gabbard (D-HI) "and had already gained slight bipartisan support before Mr. Amash...joined in." 
Snowden is "wanted in the U.S. to face charges related to admittedly leaking classified material 
to members of the media in 2013." Assange "was charged last year under the Espionage Act 
with crimes stemming from his longtime role as founder and publisher of the WikiLeaks anti-
secrecy website."

Maryland Man Faces Federal Charges For Threatening Biden And Harris. 
The CBS Evening NewsVi (10/21, story 3, 1:45, O'Donnell, 4.55M) reported, "A Maryland man 
is facing three federal charges after threatening to kill Joe Biden and Kamala Harris." CBS' Jeff 
Pegues added, "Federal prosecutors say this is James Reed, captured on a door camera, leaving 
his threatening handwritten note at the Maryland home of a Biden supporter. The note says, 
'We're the ones with those scary guns. When we capture grandpa Biden, we will all severely 
beat him to the point of death and would execute both Biden and Kamala Harris on national 
television." 
The Baltimore Sun (10/21, Prudente, 1.33M) reports Reed "was arrested last week by 
Frederick Police and remains held without bail. After agents asked for his fingerprints and a 
handwriting sample, he confessed to writing the letter because he was upset at the political 
situation, they wrote in charging documents." The New York Times (10/21, Dewan, 18.61M) 
reports Reed "provided a palm print and handwriting sample and acknowledged having written 
the letter, according to the complaint. He is charged with the federal offense of threatening a 
major candidate, which carries a penalty of up to five years in prison, and two violations of 
state law: threatening mass violence and voter intimidation." USA Today (10/21, Peter, 
10.31M), the Wall Street Journal (10/21, Viswanatha, Subscription Publication, 7.57M), the New
