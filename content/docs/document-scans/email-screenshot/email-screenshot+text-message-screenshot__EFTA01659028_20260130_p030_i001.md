Southwest Will No Longer Block Middle Seat Starting In December. 
NBC Nightly NewsVi (10/22, story 9, 1:40, Holt, 5.51M) reported, "Southwest Airlines says it 
will not block the middle seat on planes starting December 1st, leaving just Delta and Alaska 
keeping those seats empty." NBC's Tom Costello added, "Southwest and Delta have been 
blocking middle seats to give passengers a few feet of social distance in the pandemic, but with 
new research suggesting it is safe to fly, Southwest says it will sell every available seat starting 
December 1st. American and United are already filling middle seats, Delta plans to do so in the 
first half of next year." 
USA Today Criticizes Administration's Consideration Of Herd Immunity Strategy. 
USA Today (10/22, 10.31M) editorializes that a "White House struggling to show competence as 
a pandemic surges in the midst of a reelection campaign" has been considering, according to 
news reports, herd immunity. USA Today argues that it is "a convenient solution for Donald 
Trump" that "fits neatly within his failure to produce a national plan for curtailing coronavirus 
with rapid testing, contact tracing and isolating the infected. And it endorses his mantra that 
states fully reopen for economic recovery, even as the disease spreads." However, USA Today 
write, "infectious disease experts say it's junk science, and worse, would risk doubling or 
tripling the number of Americans dead from COVID-19." 
Court Bars Census Bureau From Giving Administration Data On Migrants. 
In what the New York Times (10/22, Wines, 18.61M) describes as "a blow to President Trump's 
plan to upend the centuries-old method of apportioning seats in the House of Representatives," 
a three-judge panel in the US District Court for the Northern District of California "on Thursday 
barred the Census Bureau from giving the White House a count of the nation's unauthorized 
immigrants." In July, Trump ordered the Bureau "to give him a state-by-state count of people 
living in the United States without authorization, saying he planned to subtract them from the 
2020 census totals that will be used to divvy up House seats among the states next year." 
Trump Says He Is Looking Forward To Supreme Court Overturning ACA. 
The New York Times (10/22, Grynbaum, Haberman, 18.61M) reports that in an interview with 
CBS' Lesley Stahl, footage of which was released by the White House on Thursday, President 
Trump "makes a notable pronouncement about his opinion of the Affordable Care Act, telling 
Ms. Stahl that he wants the Supreme Court to abolish" the law. Trump is quoted as saying, "I 
hope that they end it; it'll be so good if they end it." Pressed by Stahl "on how he would handle 
a scenario where millions of Americans abruptly lost their health insurance, Mr. Trump said 
repeatedly that he had `a plan.' When Ms. Stahl pointed out that he has not shown a plan 
publicly, Mr. Trump falsely claimed that he had."

Business Insider (10/22, LoBianco, Moses, 3.67M) reports White House senior adviser Jared 
Kushner "has been talking up the idea of starting a Donald Trump-themed news outlet or some
