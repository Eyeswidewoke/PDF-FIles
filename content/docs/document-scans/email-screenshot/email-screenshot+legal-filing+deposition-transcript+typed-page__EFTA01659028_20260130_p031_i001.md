throughout the year, according to three of the people. But the increased chatter about the rise 
of another conservative media outlet, possibly branded under the Trump name, has kicked up 
even more over the past few weeks as the president's reelection chances continue to sink." 
Trump Issues Order Removing Protections For Federal Workers. 
The New York Times (10/22, Lipton, 18.61M) reports President Trump signed an executive 
order issued late Wednesday "that could substantially expand his ability to hire and fire tens of 
thousands of federal workers during a second term, potentially allowing him to weed out what 
he sees as a 'deep state' bureaucracy working to undermine him." The executive order, 
"described by one prominent federal union leader as 'the most profound undermining of the 
Civil Service in our lifetimes," would allow federal agencies to "go through their employee 
rosters and reclassify certain workers in a way that would strip them of job protections that 
now cover most federal employees." In a statement, the White House said the new employee 
classification was justified because under current rules "removing poor performers, even from 
these critical positions, is time-consuming and difficult." 
The Washington Post (10/22, Yoder, 14.2M) reports the order would "shift those 
employees from what is called the 'competitive service' - covering the bulk of the 2.1 million 
executive branch employees - into the 'excepted service,' which in general applies to political 
appointees below the level requiring Senate confirmation." American Federation of Government 
Employees President Everett Kelley said in a statement, "This is the most profound undermining 
of the civil service in our lifetimes. The president has doubled down on his effort to politicize 
and corrupt the professional service." 
Politico (10/22, Mueller, 4.29M) reports unions and Democrats "were quick to criticize the 
move as a bid to inject politics into the public sector workforce." House Oversight and Reform 
Chair Carolyn Maloney said in a statement, "President Trump's new executive order would 
overturn a 150-year-old precedent that created an expert non-partisan civil service and return 
us to the 'spoils system' of political governance." The Hill (10/22, Beitsch, 2.98M), among other 
news outlets, similarly report the order. 
USPS IG: Mail Service Deteriorated Under DeJoy. 
The Wall Street Journal (10/22, Palazzolo, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) reports an analysis 
by the US Postal Service's inspector general found that a dramatic slowdown in mail delivery 
resulted from actions that Postmaster General Louis DeJoy initiated or accelerated after he took 
office in June. 
Colorado Wildfire Grows By More Than 100,000 Acres, Forcing Evacuation. 
The CBS Evening NewsVI (10/22, story 4, 1:20, O'Donnell, 3.96M) reported, "Two rapidly 
growing wildfires could merge into one mega fire in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado." CBS' 
Omar Villafranca added, "Driven by high winds and dead, dry timber, the fire grew at a 
staggering pace overnight, exploding from 19,000 acres to more than 125,000 acres in mere 
hours." Thousands of residents are under mandatory evacuation orders. 
The Washington Post (10/22, 14.2M) reports the "East Troublesome Fire, burning in Grand 
County and extending now into Rocky Mountain National Park, forced hundreds to quickly 
evacuate from Grand Lake and Granby overnight, with more evacuations taking place 
Thursday." 
The Denver Post (10/22, Tabachnik, 720K) reports the "raging fire has firefighters and 
emergency officials concerned about the possibility that it could merge with the Cameron Peak 
fire, the largest fire in state history, as the two have each burned into Rocky Mountain National 
Park." The two fires are "about 10 miles apart." The New York Times (10/22, Brennan, Healy, 
18.61M) reports the National Weather Service "said the critical danger posed by gusting winds 
was likely to last through Monday."
