O'Brien Warns China Of New Sanctions Over Hong Kong. 
Bloomberg (11/11, Harney, Wadhams, 4.73M) reports National Security Adviser O'Brien on 
Wednesday "said China's latest clampdown in Hong Kong shows that the one country, two 
systems arrangement for the territory amounts to a 'fig leaf' for dictatorship, and warned of 
new sanctions." The warning followed China's top legislative body passing "a resolution allowing 
for the disqualification of any Hong Kong lawmakers who were not deemed sufficiently loyal. 
Chief Executive Carrie Lam's government immediately banished four legislators." In a statement 
released Wednesday evening, O'Brien said the US would "continue to utilize all the powers 
granted" under various laws and "identify and sanction those responsible for extinguishing Hong 
Kong's freedom." 
Reuters (11/11, Pang, Tam) reports that after the resolution was adopted, Hong Kong's 
"pro-democracy opposition lawmakers said...they would resign in protest against the dismissal 
of four of their colleagues." The New York Times (11/11, Ramzy, May, Yu, 18.61M) says the 
ouster of the four lawmakers and the subsequent mass resignations "will reshape the city's 
political landscape." The Times says the lawmakers who resigned maintain that the legislature is 
"now so compromised by the government's power to stamp out opposition that they must work 
outside the system." 
The Washington Post (11/11, Mahtani, 14.2M) reports that "almost a dozen pro-
democracy legislators have been arrested in recent months on various charges, an indication of 
the pressure on them after backing anti-government protests last year." The Post adds, 
"Chinese analysts expect tensions between the United States and China, including over Hong 
Kong, to persist under a Biden administration." 
Pompeo To Announce Process For US To Declare Groups Anti-Semitic. 
Politico (11/11, Toosi, 4.29M) reports Secretary of State Pompeo "has decided to establish a 
new process by which the United States can declare groups, including NGOs, to be anti-
Semitic," but for now, he "won't be naming any names." According to Politico, "the decision is a 
compromise." Pompeo has, in recent weeks, "been weighing whether to label Amnesty 
International, Human Rights Watch and Oxfam as anti-Semitic because of their alleged actions 
toward the Israeli government." Had he named them, "the plan was to say the U.S. would not 
support the organizations and to urge other governments also not to support such groups, 
financially or otherwise." But the proposal "drew fierce internal pushback from some State 
Department staffers, as well as external condemnation from lawmakers and other critics." 
CIA, German Intelligence Used Swiss Company As Platform For Espionage Operation. 
The Washington Post (11/11, Miller, 14.2M) reports according to a report released Tuesday by 
members of the Swiss parliament, the CIA and German intelligence used a Swiss company to 
conduct a global espionage operation for decades, putting Switzerland's reputation for neutrality 
in jeopardy. Investigators found "that Swiss authorities were aware of, and at times complicit 
in, an elaborate espionage operation in which the CIA covertly owned and controlled a Swiss 
company, Crypto AG, that secretly sold rigged encryption systems to foreign governments." 
According to the report, the operation exploited "Switzerland's image abroad as a neutral state." 
US Defense Bill Includes Sanctions Tied To Russia-Germany Natural Gas Pipeline. 
Reuters (11/11) reports that "sanctions that could hinder one of Moscow's most important 
projects in Europe, the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline, have been included in the annual 
U.S. defense policy bill." According to Reuters, the sanctions included in the National Defense 
Authorization Act "would penalize companies facilitating the construction of the pipeline, 
including ships helping operations to lay pipelines or moving rock formations on the sea bed." 
Reuters adds that the sanctions "also target companies providing insurance or secondary 
insurance for its construction and certification for the pipeline in Denmark." Reuters reports that
