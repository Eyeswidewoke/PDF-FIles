-'ortfOlt0 Holdings (continued) 
Generally, securities acquired before 2011, in retirement accounts or held by Non-U.S. entities are not subject to the cost basis reporting rules set forth in the Internal Revenue Code of 
1986, as amended by the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, and are marked as "noncovered". Securities marked as "covered", were identified as securities potentially 
subject to the cost basis reporting rules and may be reported to the IRS on form V99-8 for the applicable tax year in which the securities are disposed. 
Note: In the event where we cannot easily determine the taxability of an account, we may mark the account as noncovered. However, if the account does not receive a 10998. the cost 
basiswill not be reported to the IRS. 
" The cost basis of this security has been provided to us by the delivering firm or transferring agent and Pershing makes no representation as to the accuracy of this information.

may be included in the figures for certain securities, thereby overstating them. Refer to www pershing.comf disclosures for specific details as to formulas used to calculate the figures.
