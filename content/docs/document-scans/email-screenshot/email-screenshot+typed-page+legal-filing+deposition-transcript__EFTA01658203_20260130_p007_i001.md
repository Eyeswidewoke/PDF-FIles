Cuccinelli: "This is a long established federal practice. It's well within the authority of the 
federal government." 
Cuccinelli said on Mornings on the Mall (7/21) (interview begins at 2:08:04) that Portland 
has "had 54 straight says of violence which is just extraordinary, longer than any place in the 
country. ... And part of that violence has been directed at federal facilities and federal officers. 
The law gives DHS the responsibility of protecting those facilities like the Hatfield Courthouse. 
... This is not a new mission for us and the idea that we would suspend that mission...is really 
quite silly." Cuccinelli said on Fox News' Your World, "We certainly are well within the boundaries 
of the law and the Constitution." Cuccinelli was also interviewed on the Rush Limbaugh ShowVI 
(7/21, 165K), the Lars Larson ShowVi (7/21), 
The Washington Post (7/21, Miroff, Zapotosky, 14.2M) reports "legal analysts say that 
while the department has broad authority to enforce federal laws, officers' actions — especially 
in Portland, Ore. — seemed to be pushing the boundaries and pulling DHS into a domestic 
policing role." DHS officials, however, "defended their tactics in Portland again Tuesday, saying 
the department has an obligation to protect government buildings in the city that have been 
targeted" by protesters. 
The New York Times (7/21, Al, Baker, 18.61M) reports Acting DHS Secretary Wolf "said at 
a news conference on Tuesday that he had tried to collaborate with Mayor Wheeler and Gov. 
Kate Brown, asking them this month whether they were overwhelmed and wanted resources, 
including personnel." Wolf "said that when he asked what they needed to 'bring the violence to 
a close and still allow the peaceful protesters to protest each and every night,' they told him to 
stay out of the city." The Washington Times (7/21, Richardson, 492K), among other news 
outlets, also reports Wolf's comments. 
Wolf, on The Hugh Hewitt ShowVi (7/21) Tuesday, said DHS is "taking a proactive 
approach in Portland where we are in the midst of making sure that we have federal properties, 
including the courthouse there, safe and secure overnight. What we have seen in Portland is 
that the Mayor has abdicated his responsibility there in letting these violent crowds form night 
after night, targeting that courthouse and our law enforcement officers. So, that is of concern 
to us and we will continue to protect that building." 
On Fox News The Story (7/21), Wolf said, "We have clear authority. We outlined that on 
several occasions. The Federal Protective Service, part of the Department of Homeland Security 
protects almost 9,000 federal facilities across the country. They do that in Portland. Portland is 
the only city that we have this radical violence night after night. We are on our 52nd night of 
violence against that courthouse against other federal facilities and other law enforcement 
officers. I would say we don't have this issue and rails because we have local officials and local 
law enforcement working with us to protect our facilities." Wolf was also interviewed on The 
Brian Kilmeade Show (Radio) (7/21). 
NBC Nightly NewsVi (7/21, story 6, 2:10, Holt, 6.23M) reported, "The Trump 
Administration says it sent federal agents to Portland, Oregon, to defend federal buildings 
against violent attacks. But the mayor there says that escalated the conflict. Now, mayors from 
six major cities are sending this letter to the Attorney General, blasting that deployment." In 
the letter, the CBS Evening NewsVi (7/21, story 6, 1:50, O'Donnell, 4.49M) reported, "mayors 
from six cities...demand[ed] the President take immediate action to withdraw" federal agents. 
Elsewhere on Tuesday, Defense Secretary Esper "raised concerns about the officers' military-
style fatigues." Esper, Politico (7/21, Seligman, 4.29M) reports, "has raised concerns within the 
administration about federal agents patrolling the streets of U.S. cities in camouflage uniforms 
similar to those worn by troops in war zones, his spokesperson said Tuesday." 
In a report headlined "Facing Federal Agents, Portland Protests Find New Momentum," the 
AP (7/21, Flaccus) reports that "crowds in Portland had recently numbered fewer than 100 
people but swelled to more than 1,000 over the weekend — and they're once again attracting a 
broader base in a city that's increasingly outraged" of the deployment of federal agents.
