approach to Russia as well as his push to oust an inspector general amid withering criticism 
from Senate Democrats." Pompeo is quoted as saying, "I can assure you and the American 
people that each time I've spoken with [Russian Foreign Minister Sergey] Lavrov, I have raised 
all of the issues that put any American interests at risk, whether it's our soldiers on the ground 
in Syria, soldiers on the ground in Afghanistan, the activities that are taking place in Libya, the 
actions in Ukraine." 
Citing "three former senior officials," Reuters (7/30, Emmott, Siebold) reports that the US 
"will take years to move its main military command in Europe from Germany to NATO 
headquarters in Belgium and updating facilities will be costly." However, "despite concerns that 
the move announced on Wednesday is politically motivated, they told Reuters that 'streamlining 
and rationalising' the U.S. military presence in Europe made some strategic sense." Reuters 
notes that Defense Secretary Esper "said the decision was part of a review of U.S. troop 
presence around the world." 
Polish Towns That Declared Themselves "LGBT-Free Zones" Are Denied EU Funds. 
The New York Times (7/30, Pronczuk, 18.61M) reports the EU "will not provide funding to six 
Polish towns that have declared themselves 1.G.B.T.-free zones,' a rare financial sanction of a 
member nation for issues related to the equal treatment of its citizens." While the amounts of 
money being withheld "are modest - from $6,000 to $29,000 - the exclusion of the towns from 
funding for a program that connects local communities across Europe was intended to have a 
deeper symbolic resonance." EU Commissioner for Equality Helena Dalli tweeted, "E.U. values 
and fundamental rights must be respected by Member States and state authorities." 
Violence In Darfur Increasing After Bashir's Overthrow. 
The New York Times (7/30, Walsh, 18.61M) reports it has been just over a year since "euphoric 
protests toppled Omar Hassan al-Bashir, the detested dictator whose alleged atrocities in Darfur 
earned him an indictment on genocide charges in an international court." Sudan is now "run by 
a joint civilian-military government that has promised to usher in a new era of democracy, and 
finally — after 17 years of suffering - bring peace to Darfur." But this month, the "tempo of 
violence quickened" with 60 civilians massacred on Saturday in "the deadliest attack in 
months." 
Trudeau Defends Charity Deal In Rare Testimony Before Parliament. 
In what the Washington Post (7/30, Coletta, 14.2M) calls an "unusual for a sitting prime 
minister," Justin Trudeau testified in a Parliament hearing broadcast live on Canadian television 
that "WE Charity received no preferential treatment - not from me, not from anyone else." The 
Canadian leader "apologized again for his failure to recuse himself from cabinet discussions on 
the deal" amid a "burgeoning ethics scandal that has cast a pall over his minority government." 
In his testimony Thursday, Trudeau "said he did not learn that public servants were 
recommending that the Toronto-based WE Charity administer the program until a briefing 
before a cabinet meeting on May 8."
