Cash Flow Projections 
My comments are as follows: 
Leon & =eborah Black 
1) having a head with multiple dates is very confusing - =ayment dates should be on line below actual payment amounts 
2) cash balance (last line) of 18,444,902 makes no sense =ithout a beginning balance - a line should be added to show 
each months =eginning balance and ending balance and should be properly =abeled 
3) overall statement needs to have =onsistency or scope of dollars to be included - examples 
=/span>a) inflows - other refunds / receipts of 3,266 and =1,779 in Jan / Feb - why include with such small amounts -
should have =isc to capture this - also why only in Jan and Feb? 
b) inflows - does Leon earn = salary at APO? 273,000 not included ?? 
= 
c) outflows - rare books of 18,304 - again a =isc should be used to capture this along with items in d and e =elow 
d) =nbsp;outflows - support - children - 20,000 (i am sure number is larger =han this on an annual basis) - why only 1 
month? don't we have =istory to project a full year 
=nbsp; e) outflows - misc - only 3 months projected ?? 
4) household / transfers to ms - 17,000,000 continues to be =hown yet Rich Joslin told me when we met that number 
probably is =,000,000 per month - why in lumps each quarter? should be presented =onthly.. 
a) we should highlight how =7,000,000 is spent as opposed to 5 lumps.. household operating expenses = capital 
improvements / RE taxes 
5) art =onsultant receives a check lx per year in May 2015- why is this not =aid from Narrows? Family office? Deduction 
for expense? 
6) Art loan shows interest paid quarterly yet 2 other loans =how monthly payments - inconsistent and probably incorrect 
- loan =xpires in May 2015 - renewal?? 
7) plane - was =here no debt service or use expense in January 2015 as this was left =lank? 
8) Townhouse construction - are payments =ctually made quarterly? monthly? how was amount =erived? 
9) Narrows transfers - are they =ctually made quarterly? monthly? how was amount =erived? 
10) Insurance / Property tax figures =eems low overall - insurance for what? if households then why is it not =nclude in 
households above - does 688,000 include townhouse? 
11) Legal and Accounting - why are there two line items =Current and Prior Year) - with all the in-house accountants and 
=ttorneys this number seems to high.. 
12) Charity - =umps again - does Leon only make contributions in 3 months during the =ear 
13) IRS Taxes 
a) =anuary - based on my knowledge estimated payments are due Jan 15th - if =rue then why are state payments shown 
in Jan 16-31 column (would that =ake them late??) 
b) =pril payments for Fed and State should show what amounts relate to =xtension vs 2015 Q1 estimate 
=nbsp; c) Taxes overall seem low for 2015 yet this can be function of =ncome.. 
d) I =nderstand probably in AMT each year but why are state taxes for Q4 not =aid in Dec?? 
14) Overall presentation is =oor 
a) print should be larger and =asier to read 
b) headings and footings should =e bolded and stand out - to many lines and numbers in headers and =ooters 
c) all running balances show =mounts in 25mm + range yet why are we breaking out Jan and April into =ays 1.15 and 16-
30/31 - seems silly..
