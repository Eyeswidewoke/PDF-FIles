shown here, of hi= personally edited writings of his poetry - something you can't find on You=ube, a presentation or in a 
book, or perhaps anywhere but this app. 
9. 
10. 
This is an important point: if=you Google Richard Wurman, you come up with perhaps 450,000 citations. 
&nbs=;The number changes daily. This would amount to 40,000+ pages, which o= course nobody looks at. Basically it's 
junk big data, and people mos=ly focus on one article and a wikipedia entry. The attempt here is to=have the first 
primitive development of a platform for beginning to assuage=some curiosity in the beginning of looking at a visual 
biography of at leas= these 50 people. If the platform works it's scalable. That's t=e idea of a new modality. If it works 
for people perhaps it will work=for healthcare and other subjects. 
11. 
I'm putting toge=her a team of people consisting of Ali Smolans, who will help curate some o= the 
materials for many of you, Paul Kandarian, a magazine writer friend of=mine from Rhode Island, and three others plus 
Blaise Zerega, CEO of FORA.tv=who has agreed to make some original, simple videos such as Frank Gehry wal=ing 
around his office showing and discussing models of buildings that he ha= not built, or variations of for instance the 8 
Spruce Street tower in New Y=rk or hopefully Craig Venter's laboratories in a walk-through, etc. etc. 
12. 
So this is a request for the following: please start thinking about th= stuff that you've never shown: 
everything from baby pictures, pictur=s of your pets, pictures of your office, pictures of your home, things that=make 
you real. Multiple photographs of yourself, perhaps a strip of p=otographs of you taken in a photo booth at an 
amusement park that you have i= a drawer. Writings that you've done that show your edits, something t=at shows 
you're real, human, and shows your process. Pictures of your=laboratories. Agree to have somebody do a 5- or 10-
minute walk throug= with you in your office or your lab or your place of work or your architec=ural studio. Videos or 
dvd's that for example I know Moshe Safdie has=which he makes to describe what a building will look like in computer 
graph=cs to a client. I know he has a fantastic one of an apartment house i= Singapore. And I'm sure Bjarke has similar 
things that he generally d=es not release. Covers of books about you, covers of books by you. &n=sp;A list of articles 
that you think critically describes you and links to Y=uTubes or other videos or other citations that you think and you 
have curat=d yourself that make you particularly interesting, not the half a million a=ailable on line. 
13. 
We hope to have this put together, along wi=h the entire conference, for release by 1 December and 
promote it immediate=y after Thanksgiving. I am going to ask for your cooperation out in R=dlands at the conference 
and I will have additional copies of this and the o=her memo to give you when you register. 
14. 
Attached are technic=l specifications for those of you who understand them yourself or have some=ody 
in your office under the age of 30 who automatically understands them t=at would help us translate whatever you send 
us in usable form. Pleas= read them or give them to somebody to read. I don't understand them m=self but I'm sure 
some of you have a better handle on this than I do but th=s would make the process extremely more smooth and 
efficient and less expen=ive.
