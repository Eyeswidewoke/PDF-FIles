axis of moderation, while also excluding jihadists from the scene.=Saudi and UAE diplomacy supported an American 
military strike against Assa=. They communicated with Russia to give assurances and incentives to ensur= that the 
Russians would refrain from effective rejection of any strikes. =owever, the Russian-American deal to disarm Syria's 
chemical weapons was a=surprise. This was then followed by the developing closeness between Iran =nd both the US 
and Britain<http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/02/ob=ma-rouhani-phone-call-us-iran>, which further 
complicated the situation an= derailed the aims of the axis of moderation. 
The restructuring of regional alliances is still ongoing. The two countries=that would benefit most from being politically 
close would be Turkey and l=an. Iran, burdened by an economic blockade and on the verge of talks with =he 
west<http://www.latimes.com/world/worldnow/la-fg-wn-iran-nuclear-talks-=0131014,0,2879074.story>, has an 
interest in the Iraqi and Syrian crises b=ing resolved in a manner that would guarantee the preservation of its powe= 
while bringing stability to the region. 
Meanwhile, Turkey also has an interest in putting an end to the bloodshed i= Syria and Iraq because of the detrimental 
impact the conflicts are having=on Turkey's own stability and economic development. In addition, Turkey's =elationship 
with the axis of moderation has deteriorated since the coup in=Egypt, and it needs to make diplomatic moves to revive 
its regional influe=ce. 
However, the transformations in the region are expected not only to affect =he position of countries, but that of the 
Islamist movements as well. In p=rticular it will be interesting to see how Hamas re-evaluates its regional=relations and 
whether the targeting of the movement in Gaza will drive it =o restore close relations with Iran. 
The region as a whole has suffered from conflict between the two axes for y=ars, and this has led to civil wars and 
sectarian conflict. It is now clea= that the struggle in Syria has reached a critical point for both sides, a=d there will be no 
solution unless Iranians, Turks and Arabs can work toge=her. As for Iraq, its legislative elections will be held in a few 
months. =ectarian polarisation in the country is claiming hundreds of lives on a mo=thly basis. Without reconciling 
Sunnis, Shias and Kurds, Iraq too is headi=g for more violence. 
Conflicting axes cannot achieve stability in the region; only co-operative =lions of all the parties and countries involved 
can hope to do that. Toda= this all seems a distant hope, and the region may have to experience more=turmoil and 
chaos before this fact is accepted.

The Middle East Pendulum 
Roger Cohen<http://topics.nytimes.com/topinews/international/columns/rogerc=henk 
October 14, 2013 -- The Middle Eastern strongmen are back. The counterrevol=tion is in full swing. Islamists and secular 
liberals do battle. The Shiit= and Sunni worlds confront each other. A two•state Israeli-Palestinian pea=e looks 
impossible. Freedom is equated with chaos. For this region there i= no future, only endless rehearsals of the past. 
Poisoned by colonialism, stymied by Islam's battle with modernity, inebri=ted by oil, blocked by the absence of 
institutions that can mediate the fu=y of tribe and ethnicity, Middle Eastern states turn in circles. Syria is =ow the 
regional emblem, a vacuum in which only the violent nihilism of the=jihadi thrives. 
Just two and a half years after the Arab Spring, talk of the future — any=future — seems preposterous. Countries build 
futures on the basis of thi=gs that do not exist here: consensus as to the nature of the state, the ru=e of law, a concept 
of citizenship that overrides sectarian allegiance, an= the ability to place the next generation's prosperity above the 
settlin= of past scores. 
Syria's Bashar al-Assad has gassed his own people. Iraq is again engulfed=in Sunni-Shiite violence. The U.S.-trained 
Egyptian Army has slaughtered m=mbers of the Muslim Brotherhood. It is hard to recall the heady season of =011 when 
despots fell and Arabs spoke with passion of freedom and personal=empowerment. The Arab security state has shown 
its resilience; it breeds e=tremism. As the political theorist Benjamin Barber has noted, "Fundament=lism is religion 
under siege." 
A scenario of endless conflict is plausible. Yet there are glimmerings. Rep=essive systems have survived but mind-sets 
have changed. The young people =f the region (the median age in Egypt, where nearly one quarter of all Ara=s live, is 25)
