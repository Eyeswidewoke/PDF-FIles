Swedish market." Swedish police and military agencies "concluded that Chinese state influence 
over the private sector `brings with it strong incentives for privately owned companies to act in

Next US President Will Face Challenges In SG Race With China. 
In a report headlined "The 5G Challenges The Next White House Will Inherit," Politico (11/6, 
Hendel, 4.29M) tech reporter John Hendel said US wireless providers "don't have the right 
airwaves or network architecture to really allow for widespread, robust 5G use just yet, which 
will be a pressing challenge for whoever occupies the White House - especially as China bursts 
into the lead in the so-called race to 5G." Should presumed President-elect Joe Biden succeed 
Donald Trump in 2021, "5G could prove a source of rare bipartisan unity." Connectivity during 
the COVID-19 pandemic "has never seemed more vital," and though "Trump economic adviser 
Larry Kudlow dismisses `pessimistic' assessments" of the United States' SG position, "reassuring 
wireless officials last month that the U.S. is doing just fine," his opinion "comes in stark contrast 
to warnings from others like former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, who recently claimed a `national 
emergency' over China's SG dominance."

draws closer." GCHQ has "a close relationship" with the NSA, "as well as the eavesdropping 
agencies of Australia, Canada and New Zealand in an intelligence alliance known as the `Five 
Eyes.' 
Experts Expect Biden Administration To Ramp Up Sanctions For Cyberattacks. 
Law360 (11/8, Kochman, Grande, Subscription Publication, 8K) reports, "Joe Biden's presidency 
could lead to tougher sanctions for state-backed actors who target the U.S. with cyberattacks 
and carve out an easier path for a key transatlantic data transfer deal," according to experts. 
The next presidential term is "likely to feature stronger privacy enforcement" by the FTC and 
"consistent messaging from the White House about cybersecurity threats, as well as enhanced 
cooperation with other countries on those issues." Biden is "expected to continue the trend of 
calling out adversaries for destructive cyberattacks." DLA Piper partner Ed McAndrew said the 
incoming Administration "would be more aggressive in imposing financial costs to malicious 
cyber activity, and specifically with sanctions."

Department of Justice (DOJ) "said it is moving to have...69,370" seized bitcoins forfeited to the

including the sale of drugs and guns as well as money laundering."
