worked extensive hours on the operation. YCSO Criminal Intelligence/Homeland Security Unit Director Robert

Federal Indictment Alleges Kidnapping, Robbery Scheme Operated From Texas Tire Shop 
KRIS (NBC-6) (10/01, Jenkins) reported that a federal indictment alleges a kidnapping and robbery scheme 
operated from Danny's Tire Service in Corpus Christi, with Victor Daniel Almaguer-Cantu, Robert Luis Saldan, and 
another co-conspirator involved. According to the article, the scheme used a fake Facebook Marketplace post to 
lure a victim to the tire shop, where they were locked in an office, beaten, and threatened, then forced to withdraw 
cash and make a jewelry purchase. The defendants allegedly stole the jewelry, used the victim's private information 
to apply for loans, and threatened to kill the victim and their family if they did not cooperate. The article noted 
that KRIS 6 reached out to CCPD for comment, who tells us they are not involved, as this is a case for the FBI.

FBI Warns of 'Phantom Hacker' Scam That Has Stolen $542 Million From Seniors This Year 
WFTX (Fox-4) (10/01, Kruger) reported that the FBI has issued a warning about a sophisticated "phantom hacker" 
scam that has stolen more than $542 million this year, with nearly half of the victims being seniors over 60. 
According to the article, the scam unfolds in three phases: fake tech support convinces victims their computer is 
hacked, scammers posing as bank representatives direct them to move money to supposed safe accounts, and 
impersonators of government officials pressure them to wire funds overseas or buy cryptocurrency. The article 
noted that the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center received 19,000 tech support scam complaints between 
January and June 2023, with seniors making up nearly 50% of reports and 66% of total losses, and the FBI stressed 
that legitimate agencies never request money transfers via wire, cryptocurrency, or gift cards. 
Shutdown Snares Federal Cybersecurity Personnel 
Bank Info Security (10/01, Riotta) reported that the federal government shutdown has severely impacted the 
Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), which furloughed 
about 65% of its workforce, leaving fewer than 900 staff on duty since its creation in 2018. According to the article, 
the cuts have stalled grants to state and local governments, frozen many CISA programs, and ended funding for the 
Center for Internet Security's MS-ISAC, which previously provided no-cost cyber hygiene and incident response 
support to municipalities. The article noted that while the Department of Justice has kept nearly 90% of its 
workforce, including all FBI cyber agents and support staff, investigators may face slower intelligence feeds and 
fewer analytic products due to diminished support from agencies like CISA. It further highlighted that the 
Department of Defense's U.S. Cyber Command and NSA operations remain fully exempt from furloughs, but 
coordination with civilian cyber agencies and public-private partnerships may suffer as the shutdown continues. 
NextGov (10/01, Dimolfetta) quoted Cynthia Kaiser, a former deputy assistant director in the FBI's Cyber 
Division: "As a new solution is formalized, information sharing needs to continue to be a top priority across the 
private sector. Our hope is that a renewal of CISA 2015 — whether or not the name of the statute stays the same —
will be part of a bill to reopen the federal government." 
WestJet Breach Hits 1.2 Million People, Affects Passports, IDs

affecting the personal data of 1.2 million people, including names, dates of birth, addresses, passports, government 
IDs, and travel-related details. According to the article, the company said no passwords or credit card numbers
