Hi Vijay, 
See responses in blue below: 
Reason for Rejection:7/31 
A — Please provide a recent document that will serve as address proof. The IRS document is from September, 2016. - Could you 
provide latest (July 18) bank statement for this entity? This should resolve this request. 
• 
Attached 
B — Nature of Business: What do they do with the artwork? Do they purchase it and re-sell it? Does the trust only hold artwork as 
assets? — As per constitutional does. the purpose of Prytanee LLC is for engaging in the acquisition, ownership & management of 
artwork for investment purposes. I had already updated this but it seems they want more info on re-selling part. Could you advise on 
this please? 
• 
This is hysterical. Private Art collectors am constantly buying and selling art work. They do whatever they please with 
it...put it on the wall. loan it to museums. keep it in the shipping box it came in. Artwork and cash to purchase the artwork are the 
only assets 
• 
Please tell them to call me if th:p reject this... 
• 
Still laughing 
C — Please check to see if there is a memo that was accompanied by Chip Packard's approval. If there is none. I recommend 
"refreshing" the approval with current senior management. The current e-mail approval does not address what exactly is being 
discussed and approved. — Kindly provide this please. 
• 
Recent ExCo approval was obtained and attached. All alcns have been cleared. What do they need here — an updated ExCo 
approval? 
D — The address of employer for Caroline is missing. In addition, please include how long she has been with that company etc. — For 
Caroline. I have now updated Sotheby's Switzerland address & already updated that she was appointed them in 2012. Please advise if 
you have any additional points to add? 
• 
Thank you. No. 
E - The "How Was the Client(s) introduced? How long has the RM personally known the client?" field talks about Zorro 
Management Please amend. - Updated as appropriate.
