(11/11, 14.2M) that AG Barr's letter opening the door "for federal prosecutors to launch 
criminal probes of election fraud" is a "terrible idea." The author says voter fraud "is a serious 
violation," but his office "had not prosecuted any voter fraud cases in over 10 years; that 
prosecution involved only two individuals." After Iglesias worked with DOJ's Public Integrity 
Section's Election Crimes, he "did not have a single case" he could "prove beyond a reasonable 
doubt." Under DOJ policy, "federal prosecutors...wait until the election had been concluded and 
certified to file voter fraud cases," because, "even assuming voter fraud exists, its minuscule 
numbers would not affect the outcome of the election." 
Internet Rife With Misinformation, Searches For Evidence Of Voter Fraud. 
USA Today (11/11, Nerbovig, 10.31M) reports, "Armchair internet sleuths, amplified by Donald 
Trump Jr. and the creator of the comic strip Dilbert, are trying to prove dead people voted in 
the 2020 election" by posting lists of voters who are at least 100 years old. Of the 14,000 
registered voters whose names were posted on Pastebin, "some haven't been recorded as 
having cast a ballot, and at least one woman is alive." Michigan Secretary of State 
spokesperson Tracy Wimmer said, "Lists of unknown origin circulating on various social media 
channels do not constitute credible evidence." The Bipartisan Policy Center's director of the 
Elections Project, Matthew Weil, said, "The fact that there are internet sleuths looking into this, 
I don't understand what data they're going to use to begin with, but I know states go to a lot of 
effort to make sure their elections have integrity." 
NBC News (11/11, Zadrozny, 6.14M) reports that for Trump supporters searching for it, 
"proof of the president's claims that the 2020 election was `stolen' is everywhere." For instance, 
in one video, a Colorado man "claiming to be a poll worker, dressed in a yellow vest, rips up 
Trump ballots (it was a TikTok prank)." Other evidence "of a so-called Democratic plot could be 
found in the numbers." Meanwhile, "no evidence of significant, widespread or even small-time 
voter fraud has been found." Still, the "years of groundwork laid by Trump and his supporters 
have blossomed into a flood of misleading - and importantly, fractured — claims of a rigged 
election." University of Washington postdoctoral fellow Joe Bak-Coleman said, "Instead of 
evidence, we're assaulted with a plethora of claims seeking to undermine faith in the election, 
ranging from confusing to clearly fabricated. ... Individually, none of these claims could stand 
up to a moment's scrutiny, but collectively they're deafening, urging the average citizen to give 
up and accept the ambiguity." 
State Officials, Election Experts Say Election Was Run Smoothly. 
NBC News (11/11, 6.14M) reports, "The 2020 election unfolded smoothly across the country 
and without any widespread irregularities, according to state officials and election experts." The 
increase "in advance voting — 107 million people voting early in person and by mail - helped 
take pressure off Election Day operations." Ben Hovland, who serves on the Election Assistance 
Commission, said, "The 2020 general election was one of the smoothest and most well-run 
elections that we have ever seen, and that is remarkable considering all the challenges." 
University of Iowa computer scientist Doug Jones said, "The practical consequence of Trump's 
call to vigilance to prevent fraud was increased scrutiny from both sides, and this increased 
scrutiny seems to have worked. ... Election officials have been more careful, and election 
procedures have been followed more scrupulously than usual." 
Postal Worker Admits He Fabricated Claims Of Voter Irregularities. 
The Washington Post (11/10, Boburg, Bogage, 14.2M) reports, "A Pennsylvania postal worker 
whose claims have been cited by top Republicans as potential evidence of widespread voting 
irregularities admitted" to USPS investigators "that he fabricated the allegations." The man's 
claim "that a postmaster in Erie, Pa., instructed postal workers to backdate ballots mailed after 
Election Day was cited by" Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) in a letter to DOJ "calling for a federal 
investigation." AG Barr "subsequently authorized federal prosecutors to open probes into
