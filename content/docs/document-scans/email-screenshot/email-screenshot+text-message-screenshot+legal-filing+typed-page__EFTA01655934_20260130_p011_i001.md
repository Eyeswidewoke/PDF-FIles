FBI, Oregon Police Investigate Rise In 'Gore Group' Crimes Targeting Teens Online 
KPTV (Fox-12) (05/20, Thomas) reported that the FBI and Oregon police are investigating a rise in "gore group" 
crimes, where online communities lure and exploit vulnerable teens with violence and psychological 
manipulation. According to the article, a recent case involved a 14-year-old girl in the Portland metro area who was 
groomed by a man, Juan Sebastian Perez, through social media apps, leading to his arrest and a 30-year prison 
sentence. The article explained that with the victim's parents' consent, FBI agents posed as the teen online to 
gather more evidence and locate the suspect. The article noted that FBI Portland Special Agent in Charge Doug 
Olsen said that these crimes are becoming more common and difficult to track, with multiple active cases currently 
being worked on in Oregon.

American Hospital Association (05/20, Staff Writer) reported that the FBI warned of cyber actors exploiting 
vulnerabilities in end-of-life routers, particularly those dated 2010 or earlier that no longer receive software 
updates. According to the article, the FBI has received reports of obsolete routers being breached by individuals 
using variants of TheMoon malware, which can infect routers without a password. The article noted that Scott Gee, 
AHA deputy national advisor for cybersecurity and risk, advises users, especially remote workers, to maintain and 
update their home routers to prevent cyber threats. 
FBI Agents in North Carolina Warn of New Scams Using Al 
WFMY (CBS-2) (05/20, Rivera) reported that the FBI warned that scammers are using Al to make themselves more 
believable. "And so Al is obviously very useful for us and maybe our daily lives. We use it because it makes things 
easier for us. They're using it for the exact same reason. It's making the job of the scammer easier in these 
particular cases. So, for those scammers that are coming from overseas, this allows them to use proper grammar 
to portray themselves as somebody who speaks English as a first language. It's a very effective use of Al," said Phil 
VanWyngarden, FBI Assistant Special Agent In Charge in Charlotte. The article noted that VanWyngarden said 
scammers are not calling, texting, and emailing simply to get money from you; now the focus is on information, 
which is why you should never click on a link or log in to your account from a message sent to you.

Dstl and FBI Collaborate on HME Manufacturing Training 
Advance (05/20, Staff Writer) reported that the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl) has enabled the 
FBI to deliver training on homemade explosives (HME) manufacturing for the UK and other partner nations in early 
2025, at Cranfield Ordnance Test and Evaluation Centre (COTEC). The FBI was supported by Dstl's Forensic 
Explosives Laboratory (FEL) to successfully carry out the practical course. The article stated that this course is 
important for the explosives' community because it has helped develop participants' knowledge and 
understanding of homemade explosives. It also enhanced knowledge of how to safely handle these materials. For 
Dstl's FEL, the course has been instrumental in enhancing professional credibility when supporting the UK criminal 
justice system with expert witness testimonies. The Dstl team worked for about a year to refine the training 
content and develop safe working practices so the FBI could undertake this essential training within the UK. 
Man on FBI's Most Wanted List Found Living in Sydney 
ABC (05/20, Greenbank) reported that a fugitive on the FBI's most wanted list has been quietly living in Sydney for 
almost two decades. Geoffrey John Busch is wanted over an alleged investment scam in Florida in the early 
2000s. The 78-year-old is accused of taking part in a $12.3 million get-rich-quick scheme between 2002 and 2006, 
according to US court documents. Investors were allegedly told their funds would be placed in a non-existent 
"high-yield trading program", but the cash was siphoned into personal bank accounts. The article mentioned 
that Busch was indicted by a grand jury in Florida in 2007, charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire 
fraud and money laundering. The maximum sentence for wire fraud alone is 20 years in prison. In December, the 
FBI issued a new alert asking for public tip-offs about his whereabouts. The ABC tracked Busch down to a red brick
