NPR (06/05, Lucas) reported that Director Patel, a former critic of the agency, has begun to implement changes 
since taking the helm over 100 days ago, including redeploying agents and analysts from Washington, D.C. to field 
offices across the country. The article explained that Director Patel and his deputy, Dan Bongino, are shifting the 
FBI's focus from traditional law enforcement work to immigration enforcement, with most field offices now 
working on immigration cases. A spokesman for the FBI, Ben Williamson, said the agency does not comment on 
specific personnel decisions. But he added that the bureau's "agents and support staff are dedicated professionals 
working around the clock to defend the homeland and crush violent crime — a mission which certainly overlaps 
with the consequences of the previous administration's open border policies for four years." The article added that 
the new leadership has also disbanded the premier public corruption squad, which investigated public officials, and 
is instead prioritizing cases such as the pipe bombs found near the Capitol and the leak of the Supreme Court's 
Dobbs decision. "We come in in the morning, there's a portfolio of 100 level 10 items. If it's a level nine, which is a 
pretty big frickin' deal, someone else fixed it," Deputy Director Bongino told Fox's Maria Bartiromo in a joint sit-
down interview with Director Patel last month. "The only thing that gets to my desk or his is a level 10. That's the 
entire day." In that same interview, Director Patel said his priorities for the bureau were crushing violent crime, 
defending the homeland, rigorous constitutional accountability, and aggressive constitutional oversight with 
Congress. He also has promised a "wave of transparency," including on the investigation into possible ties between 
the 2016 Trump campaign and Russia and the death of disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein. The Daily Mail (06/05, 
Spiering) reported that Deputy Director Bongino claims to have video evidence proving Jeffrey Epstein's death was 
a suicide in his cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center. Bongino says the video shows Epstein was alone in his 
cell and that guards checked on him regularly, with no one else entering the area. He conceded the Epstein case 
was "a hot potato for folks" but also cautioned people against putting too much emphasis on the video he was 
preparing to release. "It's not the greatest video in the world. I don't want to set expectations on fire." Additional

Epoch Times (06/05, Phillips), and Washington Examiner (06/05, Notheis).

Fox News (06/05, Wehner) reported that the FBI arrested a teenager in Columbia County, Oregon, for allegedly

teen shared nihilistic, violent extremist ideology and detailed plans in online chats, including using a chlorine bomb 
and shooting mall patrons. The FBI, along with the Columbia County Sheriff's Office, thwarted the plot, with Special 
Agent in Charge Doug Olson stating that the plot was "as serious as it gets" and the community was protected.

FBI, DHS Warn of 'Elevated Threat' to Jewish Communities After Recent Attacks 
Fox News (06/05, Wehner) reported that the FBI and DHS have issued a joint warning of an "elevated threat" to 
Jewish and Israeli communities in the US due to the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict. According to the article, recent 
incidents include a Molotov cocktail attack by Mohamed Sabry Soliman in Boulder, Colorado, and a shooting by 
Elias Rodriguez that killed two Israeli embassy staff members, Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim, in Washington, 
D.C. The article noted that the FBI and DHS urge the public to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activity to 
law enforcement, as the conflict may motivate other violent extremists to conduct attacks against Jewish and Israeli 
communities. CBS News (06/05, Erblat) added that Soliman has been formally charged with 118 state criminal 
charges, including 28 counts of attempted murder, in connection with the Boulder attack. Additional reporting on
