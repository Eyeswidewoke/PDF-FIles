California Man Charged With Murdering College Student Whose Remains Were Found 
In Mojave. 
The My News LA (CA) (11/23) reports that a California man "was charged Monday with 
murdering a 21-year-old community college student whose remains were found in a remote 
area of the Mojave Desert nearly two months after he went missing in South Los Angeles." The 
man "appeared in a downtown courtroom and pleaded not guilty in the killing of Juan 'Cookie' 
Carlos Hernandez, according to the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office." Another man, 
"who is charged with being an accessory after the fact, also entered a not guilty plea." The 
primary suspect "faces a possible maximum sentence of 25 years to life in state prison," while 
the accessory "could be sentenced to up to three years in prison. Bail is set at $10 million for 
each defendant." LAPD worked with the FBI to investigate the disappearance, and "'their efforts 
provided detectives with a sequence of events to find Hernandez,' according to a police 
statement." 
FINANCIAL CRIME & CORPORATE SCANDALS 
Former Cincinnati City Council Member Dennard To Be Sentenced Today. 
WCPO-TV Cincinnati (11/23, Murphy, 139K) reports, "A federal judge will sentence former 
Cincinnati City Council member Tamaya Dennard on Tuesday for her role in the first of three 
corruption scandals to rock City Hall this year." WCPO-TV adds, "The U.S. Probation Office 
recommends a sentence of 24 to 30 months in prison for Dennard, according to the pre-
sentence report the office prepared in her case," but "Dennard's attorney is asking for home 
confinement, in part due to COVID-19 fears. Her attorney also believes Dennard, a Democrat 
who won a council seat in a storybook election in 2017, has suffered enough." FBI agents 
"arrested Dennard on Feb. 25 near a Downtown Starbucks before a council committee meeting. 
At the time, longtime politicians said they could not remember a corruption scandal of this 
magnitude in the city's history," but "they were unaware of the scope of the FBI's probe, or that 
two more council members would be arrested on corruption charges...months later." 
Pastor Suspended From Cincinnati City Council After Bribery Arrest. The 
Cincinnati Enquirer (11/23, Coolidge, 223K) reports, "Cincinnati City Councilman Jeff Pastor has 
been suspended, a process initiated by Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost after Pastor was 
arrested on federal bribery charges. Pastor accepted the suspension without a fight. Pastor will 
be paid his $65,000 salary while temporarily suspended. 'While allegations of public corruption 
are resolved in the courtroom, a suspension is the right course of action as even the 
appearance of corruption has no place in government,' Yost said." Pastor "is one of three 
Cincinnati councilmembers arrested and accused of pay-to-play schemes this year. 
Councilwoman Tamaya Dennard was arrested in February and pleaded guilty to honest services 
wire fraud in July. Councilman P.G. Sittenfeld was arrested Nov. 21 on federal bribery charges 
alleging he sold a vote on a development deal in exchange for campaign contributions." 
WXIX-TV Cincinnati (11/23, Baker, 42K) reports that Pastor "is facing felony charges of 
bribery, extortion, wire fraud, money laundering and other crimes. The Republican, 36, has 
pleaded not guilty and remains free on his own recognizance. The arrangement would allow 
Pastor to keep collecting his $65,000 annual council salary and healthcare benefits for not only 
him but his family, including his pregnant wife and four children, according to the source." 
Ohio AG Asks State Supreme Court To Begin Suspension Proceedings Against 
Sittenfeld. WXIX-TV Cincinnati (11/23, Baker, 42K) reports, "Ohio Attorney General Dave 
Yost has asked the Ohio Supreme Court to begin suspension proceedings against Cincinnati City 
Councilman P.G. Sittenfeld. 'While allegations of public corruption are resolved in the 
courtroom, a suspension is the right course of action even as the appearance of corruption has 
no place in government,' Yost wrote in a statement Monday." Sittenfeld (D) "was considered by 
many to be the front-runner in Cincinnati's 2021 mayor's race with more than $700,000
