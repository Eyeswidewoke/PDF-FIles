SIGNIFICANT NEWS EVENTS 
DOJ Expected to Interview Epstein Associate Ghislaine Maxwell In Florida on Thursday 
The New York Times (07/24, Thrush, Feuer) reported that Justice Department officials interviewed Ghislaine Maxwell, Jeffrey Epstein's associate, 
in a Florida prison as part of an effort to address criticism over the handling of Epstein's case. According to the article, Maxwell answered all 
questions posed by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, who will meet with her again, and her responses will be shared at a later time. The 
interview is related to the department's attempt to quell criticism over the concealment of details about Epstein's crimes and interactions with 
high•proflle figures, including President Trump. The Washington Times (07/24, Ferrechlo) reported that AG Bondi informed President Trump in 
May that his name was among hundreds of people identified in the Jeffrey Epstein files that the president's MAGA base and Democrats want 
released to the public. The news, first reported by The Wall Street Journal, fueled accusations by Democrats that Trump is concealing the files to 
protect himself. The article stated that Trump told reporters on July 15 that AG Bondi did not tell him his name was in the files. "Trump told the 
press he was not informed that his name was in the Epstein files. Now we learn that this was a lie; Sen. Adam B. Schiff, California Democrat, 
posted on /L AG Bondi indicated that Trump's name, among many others, was not the focus of any criminal investigation and was not associated 
with wrongdoing. She said the files contained "unverified hearsay about many people, including Trump, who had socialized with Epstein in the 
past," an unnamed official told the newspaper. ABC News (07/24, O'Brien, Pecorin, et al.) reported that Senate Republicans are facing pressure to 
address President Trump's ties to Jeffrey Epstein after recent reports highlighted their past friendship. Several GOP senators, including Lindsey 
Graham and Josh Hawley, are calling for transparency and the release of Epstein files, with Graham advising Trump to "get it all out". Democrats, 
such as Senator Richard Blumenthal, are also pushing for the release of files and demanding that AG Bondi testify about her discussions with 
Trump regarding the Epstein case. Raw Story (07/24, Pengelly) reported that Epstein believed Trump was the "rat" who informed the FBI about 
his activities, leading to his 2006 arrest. According to Trump biographer Michael Wolff, Epstein thought Trump used his knowledge of Epstein's 
actions against him after they fell out over a money laundering scheme in 2004. The article highlighted that on Wednesday, Wolff repeated his 
description of compromising photographs of Trump and Epstein with young girls, which he says Epstein showed him and which Wolff says would 
presumably have been confiscated by the FBI in 2019. Additional reporting on the story was provided by BBC (07/24, Halpert), The 
Guardian (07/24, Betts), Al Jazeera (07/24, Staff Writer), CNN (07/24, Collins, Shelton), CNBC (07/24, Mangan), USA Today (07/24, Bagchi) (2), 
The Hill (07/24, Fields), ABC News (07/24, Katersky, Hill, et al.), Newsweek (07/24, Bickerton), CBS News (07/24, Rosen, Quinn), The 
Independent (07/24, Rissman), and United Press International (07/24, Stark). 
DOJ Forms Russiagate 'Strike Force' to Investigate Declassified Obama•Era Evidence 
Fox News (07/24, Singman) reported that the DOJ has formed a "strike force" to investigate declassified evidence related to the origins of the 
Trump•Russia collusion narrative, which suggests that Obama administration officials "manufactured" intelligence to support the claim. 
According to the article, the investigation will review evidence declassified by Director of National Intelligence Tuts! Gabbard, including 
documents that allegedly show Obama•era officials laying the groundwork for the Trump•Russia probe after the 2016 election. The article noted 
that the DOJ's National Security Division will be involved in the investigation, which will examine potential wrongdoing by former Obama officials,
