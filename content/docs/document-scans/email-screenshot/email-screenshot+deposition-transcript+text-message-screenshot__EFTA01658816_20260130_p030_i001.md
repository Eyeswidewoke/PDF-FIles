CBP Reports Record Arrests In October. 
The Washington Post (11/19, Miroff, 14.2M) reports that authorities "made more than 69,000 
arrests and detentions last month along the border with Mexico, a 21 percent increase from 
September and the highest total for any October since 2005," according to Customs and Border 
Protection figures released Thursday. The Post says the surge "was partly fueled by a soaring 
number of repeat arrests along the border resulting from the Trump administration's practice of 
quickly 'expelling' people to Mexico after they enter the country," with "at least one-third of 
those taken into custody each month...repeat offenders." Acting CBP Commissioner Morgan 
"blamed the economic impacts of the pandemic for the latest increase in border crossings, as 
well as [Joe Biden's] stated plans to reverse many of Trump's immigration policies." 
Democrats Demand Release For Female Detainees In ICE Custody. 
The Washington Post (11/19, Armus, 14.2M) reports that "a group of more than 100 
congressional Democrats demanded Thursday" in a letter to Acting ICE Director Pham, the 
Justice Department, FBI, and DHS Office of the Inspector General that ICE "release female 
detainees from a Georgia detention facility who allege they received subpar gynecological care 
while detained there." The letter argues that the women could be witnesses in a federal 
investigation into physician Mahendra Amin and "calls for the women to receive necessary 
certifications for a chance to apply for U-visas." The lawmakers wrote, "Deporting these 
witnesses - especially when none of them have received independent physical or mental health 
evaluations by medical experts — amounts to a de facto destruction of evidence." 
Schumer Says McConnell Has Agreed To Resume COVID Relief Talks. 
Reuters (11/19) reports Senate Minority Leader Schumer said Thursday that Senate Majority 
Leader McConnell has agreed to resume COVID relief talks. According to CNBC, Schumer said, 
"[Wednesday] night, they've agreed to sit down and the staffs are going to sit down today or 
tomorrow to try to begin to see if we can get a real good COVID relief bill. ... So there's been a 
little bit of a breakthrough in that McConnell's folks are finally sitting down and talking to us." 
Reuters cites a "senior Democratic aide" who "said there was a midafternoon meeting on 
Thursday of aides" representing McConnell, Schumer, House Speaker Pelosi, and House Minority 
Leader McCarthy. However, Politico (11/19, Levine, 4.29M) says GOP aides "disputed Schumer's 
characterization and said that Democrats were conflating the omnibus spending bill and a Covid 
relief bill:' 
The New York Post (11/19, Bowden, 4.57M) reports during his weekly news conference 
Thursday, McCarthy "ripped" Pelosi over the ongoing impasse. McCarthy said, "Things are still 
at the same place. There's one road block. There's one big wall that's stopped this the entire 
time and it's Speaker Pelosi. ... I would think after the politics she played and the election being 
over, that she'd now put the American public first. She still seems to be in the same position." 
Stocks Close Higher On Word Of Renewed Stimulus Talks. Media reports stocks 
gains on Thursday to reports that stimulus talks are going to resume. The Dow added 44.81 
points to finish at 29,483.23, the S&P 500 rose 14.08 points to 3,581.87 and the Nasdaq ended 
the day 103.11 points higher at 11,904.71. The Wall Street Journal (11/19, Horner, 
Subscription Publication, 7.57M) says all three indexes started the day lower but seemed to 
gain momentum on word that stimulus talks would resume. Similarly, Reuters (11/19, Scott) 
reports stocks rose "following a report that U.S. lawmakers may restart negotiations on 
economic stimulus, which lifted gloom that had persisted through most of the global day," while 
the AP (11/19, Choe, Troise, Veiga) describes an ongoing "tug of war" between "worries about 
the worsening pandemic in the present and optimism that a vaccine will rescue the economy in 
the future."
