HI Anthony, 
The company we used for all the supplies was Porcelanosa. I will ask =hem about a converter for the faucet. 
=ttp://www.porcelanosa-usa.com/home/products/tile/wall.aspx/d=13449/titl==Glass_Blanco 
I was going to use the same wall tiles as 8H in my new apt, and possibly =he same floor tiles, but for walls as well in 4M if 
we decide to keep =hat apt. We have someone staying in there now and she says it still has =n unpleasant smell to it. I 
agree.. it still has the smell every time I =o in there. So I have to check again if you have another apt we can =ossibly 
switch it with? I don't want to renovate the whole thing if =t's going to have a strange smell the whole time. 
Regarding my new apt, I would like to be very involved with the =enovations. I want to do the closets properly and well 
thought out. I'd =ike to use California Closets for the finishing of them. If they aren't =lready built out larger, I will need 
them to be. I'd like to do the =ame baseboards as 2G. I have all the tiles and finishes in mind for the =athroom and 
kitchen already. The kitchen I'd like the same layout, but =ossibly different color scheme.l'd like to put in the 
washer/dryer unit =nstead of a dishwasher. I have a whole list of things I have done to =y apt that I would like to 
replicate: I have double thick windows in =he bedroom for sound insulation, track lighting on the ceiling in =edroom and 
living room. If possible, I'd like to put a ceiling fan in =he bedroom. Light plank hardwood floors(I'm sourcing now) 
venetian =laster on all the walls(' will have the same guy do 11J as did 14G) =isal carpet in bedroom(same as the one I 
have now), I had my own guy =ake a very nice radiator cover in the living room with drawers which I =ill have him do the 
same for 1D in living room and bedroom. That would =e great to have the bathroom fixtures moved to new apt; will 
that work =ith the valves, etc? The brand is Dorn Braht. 
I should be in the city on the 12th to have a look so I can sort out =hat I'd like done. Of course I know the basic layout, 
but it seems =very apt is a bit different and can't say for sure what should be done =ill seeing it. 
In the meantime, I will confirm the wood floor and bedroom carpet =hoices as well as the kitchen cabinets and tiles and 
bathroom tiles =opefully by the end of this week.

14G - are there =ny things in particular that you want changed. I can also arrange to =ave the bathroom fixtures 
relocated to the new apartment. =Nfortunately I can only get you access on this date - will you be in =Y?
