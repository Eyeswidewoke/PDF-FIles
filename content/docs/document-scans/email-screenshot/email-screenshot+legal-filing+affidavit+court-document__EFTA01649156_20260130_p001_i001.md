SIGNIFICANT NEWS EVENTS 
FBI Investigating Attempts to Impersonate White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles 
The Associated Press (05/30, Price) reported that the U.S. government is investigating messages impersonating Susie Wiles, President Donald Trump's chief of staff, 
which were sent to elected officials, business executives, and other prominent figures. According to the article, the messages, including text messages and AI-
generated voice calls, appeared to come from Wiles' contacts but not her actual phone number, and some recipients reported that they did not sound like her. The 
FBI warned in a public service announcement this month of a "malicious text and voice messaging campaign" in which unidentified "malicious actors" have been 
impersonating senior U.S. government officials. The scheme, according to the FBI, has relied on text messages and AI-generated voice messages that purport to 
come from a senior U.S. official and that aim to dupe other government officials as well as the victim's associates and contacts. "Safeguarding our administration 
officials' ability to securely communicate to accomplish the president's mission is a top priority," Director Patel said in a statement Friday. Additional reporting on 
the story was provided by ABC News (05/30, Barr, Stoddart), Al Jazeera (05/30, Staff Writer), CNN (05/30, Collins, Treene), The Daily Beast (05/31, Neal), Fox 
News (05/30, Nitzberg), The Guardian (05/30, Aratani), The Independent (05/30, Papenfuss), The Telegraph (05/30, Stringer), the Washington Post (05/31, Ho), 
Washington Examiner (05/30, Bide), Newsweek (05/30, King, Croucher), New York Post (05/30, Nava), Reuters (05/30, Bose), Wired (05/30, Greenberg, Burgess, 
Newman). Fox News (05/30, Video) published broadcast coverage of the story. 
British Man Charged Over Plot to Smuggle U.S. Military Technology to China 
The Independent (06/01, Garnsworthy) reported that a British man, John Miller, 63, from Tunbridge Wells in Kent, has been charged with spying for allegedly trying 
to smuggle sensitive American military technology to China. According to the article, Miller, along with his co-accused, Cui Guanghai, 43, of China, face charges 
including conspiracy, smuggling, and violations of the Arms Export Control Act, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. The U.S. is seeking to 
extradite Miller from Serbia, where he is currently located, in connection with the alleged plot to export military technology, including missiles, air defense radar, 
drones, and cryptographic devices, to China. Akil Davis, the assistant director in charge of the FBI's Los Angeles field office, said: "The FBI will not tolerate 
transnational repression targeting those in the United States who express dissenting opinions about foreign leaders. Both defendants face serious stalking charges 
in Los Angeles, and my office intends to hold them accountable for bullying a victim, a critic of the PRC, and targeting him with violence." The press release quoted 
Deputy Director Bongino: "The defendants allegedly plotted to harass and interfere with an individual who criticized the actions of the People's Republic of China 
while exercising their constitutionally protected free speech rights within the United States of America. The same individuals are also charged with trying to obtain 
and export sensitive U.S. military technology to China. I want to commend the good work of the FBI and our partners in the U.S and overseas in putting a stop to 
these illegal activities." Additional reporting on the story was provided by BBC (06/01, Chisholm), Daily Mail (05/31, Graham, Taher, et at), Politico Europe (06/01, 
Jack), The Times (06/01, Beal), The Telegraph (06/01, Mendelson, Johnston. Tait), The Guardian (06/01, Quinn). 
Two Utah Men Charged With Supporting Mexican Cartel Designated as Terrorist Group 
Fox News (05/30, Sabes) reported that Maxwell Sterling Jensen, 25, and James Lael Jensen, 68, from Utah, were charged with conspiring to support the Jalisco New 
Generation cartel, a designated terrorist organization. According to the article, the men allegedly conspired to conceal and disguise the source of proceeds from 
illegally smuggled crude oil, in addition to aiding and abetting the fraudulent entry of 2,881 shipments of oil. The DO1 said they allegedly operated an enterprise in 
Rio Hondo, Texas, named Arroyo Terminals. "It is a top priority of the FBI to eliminate foreign terrorist organizations by depriving them of the funding they need to 
operate and by seizing their most valued assets," said FBI Special Agent in Charge Aaron Tapp of the San Antonio Field Office in the press release. "Together with 
our law enforcement partners, we will use every resource and capability at our disposal to ensure violent cartels and anyone who corruptly facilitates their 
operations are held accountable to the American people and unable to establish a foothold in our communities."
