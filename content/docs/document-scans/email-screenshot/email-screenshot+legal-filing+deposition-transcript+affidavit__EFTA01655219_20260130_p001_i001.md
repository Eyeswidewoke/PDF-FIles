SIGNIFICANT NEWS EVENTS 
Deputy Director Bongino Says Illegal Alien Criminals and Child Predator 
Fox News (05/11, Baehr) reported that Deputy Director Bongino shared a detailed update Saturday about the bureau's operations, making clear the 
agency is focused on removing dangerous criminals and protecting children. In a post on X, Deputy Director Bongino outlined several priorities and took 
aim at what he called misleading media coverage of the FBI's work. "The workforce has been working overtime on task force operations to remove 
dangerous illegal aliens from the country. The work continues," Deputy Director Bongino wrote. "If you came here illegally to prey on our citizens, your 
days here are numbered." He said these operations are only getting started and will ramp up in the coming weeks. "These removal and Incarceration 
operations will dramatically change the crime landscape in the country when combined with the administration's laser-focus on sealing the border shut," 
he added. Deputy Director Bongino also pointed to a new initiative to protect children from predators. "Crimes against children are a priority for the 
workforce. Operation 'Restoring Justice, where we locked up child predators and 764 subjects, in every part of the country, is just the beginning,' he 
said. 'We are going to take your freedom if you take away a child's innocence' He promised more enforcement efforts to come and warned those 
targeting children to 'think twice." Additionally, Deputy Director Bongino addressed the FBI's efforts to respond to Congress and the public about several 
high-profile eases. These include the attack on Rep. Steve Scalise, the Nashville school shooting, the Crossfire Hurricane investigation, and the origins of 
COVID-19. He also mentioned the ongoing work with the Department of Justice in the Jeffrey Epstein case. "There are voluminous amounts of 
downloaded child sexual abuse material that we are dealing with,' he wrote. 'There are also victims' statements that are entitled to specific protections. 
We need to do this correctly, but I do understand the public's desire to get the information out there.' He also responded to what he described as false 
stories being spread by some in the media and came to the defense of Director Patel. "He spends anywhere between 10 to 12 hours in the office 
attending meetings with everyone from foreign heads of law enforcement to our counter-terror teams,' Bongino wrote. "Any assertion otherwise is a 
verifiable lie designed to stop our reforms and fracture your trust. I will die on this hill. You are being dearly lied to by people with an agenda, and It's not 
your agenda." The article noted that Deputy Director Bongino dosed by thanking the public for its attention and encouraged Americans to keep watching 
the FBI's progress. "God bless America, and all those who defend Her," he wrote. Additional reporting on the story was provided by The Texan (05/09, 
Cosgray), WRAY(ALISS) (05/09, Staff Writer), and Wahli(Ca5z10) (05/09, Staff Writer). 
Director Patel Has Reduced the Number of Morning Intel Briefings 
NBC Newc (05/09, Miamian) reported that Director Patel has reduced the number of morning intel briefings from five days a week to two days. According 
to the article, Director Patel has also stopped holding the weekly Wednesday-afternoon video teleconference with FBI leaders. The article stated that 
Director Paters approach to his new Job has raised concerns that he is not taking the position seriously enough. Ben Williamson, an FBI spokesman, 
confirmed the reduction in 8:30 a.m. director's briefings. He said Director Patel still attends five morning meetings each week, including three that are 
smaller than the director's brief. "This change was based on feedback from people in the Bureau — NOT the Director's schedule or attendance," 
Williamson said. "He still has S morning meetings per week. These meetings are critical to keeping America safe:" The article added that FBI officials 
said the director's weekly teleconference with field office leaders was stopped after "attempted leaks" led to a spate of news stories. But Director Patel 
still regularly speaks to the field office leaders. According to the article, two officials said Director Patel sometimes seemed uninterested in the material, 
and his intelligence briefers are struggling to craft a briefing that captures his attention. Williamson denied that Director Patel was uninterested and said
