Chinese government plotted to steal U.S. research critical to vaccine development," FBI Houston Special Agent in 
Charge Douglas Williams said. "Xu Zewei, an alleged hacker acting on behalf of China's primary spy agency, targeted 
COVID-19 data using sophisticated cyber techniques and tradecraft. His landmark arrest by FBI Houston agents in 
Italy proves that we will scour the ends of the earth to hold criminal foreign adversaries accountable." Additional 
reporting on the story was provided by Tampa Free Press (07/09, Grissom), TechRadar (07/09, Fadilpasic), Texas 
Scorecard (07/09, Wilson), and The Epoch Times (07/09, Fang). 
FISA Court Approves FBI Effort to Share New Evidence With Congress 
Just the News (07/09, Solomon, Dunleavy) reported that the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court has 
approved the Justice Department's request to review and share new evidence related to the Russiagate scandal 
with Congress, specifically regarding the FISA warrants targeting former Trump campaign associate Carter Page. 
According to the article, the DOJ is seeking to disclose information to Congress while redacting sensitive details, in 
response to requests from the GOP-led House and Senate Judiciary Committees for documents related to the 
Crossfire Hurricane investigation. The move is part of an effort to provide Congress with information to guide 
future hearings and determine if additional reforms of FISA are needed, with Director Patel working to hand over 
more evidence to Congress at the behest of President Donald Trump. The article clarified that the FBI's Crossfire 
Hurricane operation was flawed, and Special Counsel Durham's report found no evidence of collusion between the 
Trump campaign and Russia. Durham's investigation undercut the credibility of the Steele dossier, and his report 
noted that the FBI ignored the lack of corroboration for the dossier's allegations. The article noted that the DOJ and 
FBI are responding to requests from Representative Jordan for documents and transcripts related to the Crossfire 
Hurricane investigation, including briefing documents and a comparison of the treatment of the Crossfire Hurricane 
and Clinton investigations. 
Trump Officials Keep Getting Impersonated by A.I. 'Vishing' Scammers 
Time (07/09, Guzman) reported that Trump officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio and White House 
Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, have been impersonated by malicious actors using AI-generated audio in "vishing" scams. 
According to the article, the scams involve impersonating well-known figures to manipulate officials and gain 
access to information or accounts, with the goal of exploiting them for sensitive information. The article noted that 
the FBI and other experts warn that verifying the identity of callers and being cautious of unsolicited requests for 
sensitive information can help prevent falling victim to these scams. 
Opinion: Trump Administration's Lie Detector Campaign Against Leakers Threatens National Security 
Priorities 
An opinion piece published by The Conversation (07/09, O'Neill) reported that the Trump administration's 
campaign to use polygraphs to uncover leaks to the press is unlikely to succeed due to the subjective nature of 
polygraph results. Polygraphs measure physiological responses, but there are no specific reactions associated with 
lying, and results are not generally admissible in U.S. courts. The author assessed that the use of polygraphs may 
have a chilling effect, discouraging internal candor and diverting energy away from national security priorities, 
potentially hindering institutional resilience and adaptation to complex threats. The article noted that at agencies 
such as the DHS and the FBI, polygraphs are reportedly being used more frequently — and more punitively — to 
identify internal dissenters. 
Opinion: Counterintelligence in the Absence of Evidence 
An opinion piece published by Clearance Jobs (07/09, Burgess) reported that the British Security Service's 
Operation Wedlock was a decades-long surveillance campaign sparked by a CIA tip about a potential MI6 mole, 
with no direct evidence ever found. The operation's logic was influenced by James Jesus Angleton's worldview, 
which held that the absence of evidence could indicate a skilled concealment, leading to a mole hunt that damaged 
trust and careers. The cases of Aldrich Ames, Robert Hanssen, and Yuri Nosenko illustrate the dangers of recursive 
logic and the need for 360-degree vision in counterintelligence, where the search for certainty can lead to 
distortion and false accusations. The article highlighted that the cases of Aldrich Ames and Robert Hanssen, who 
were both found to be moles within the CIA and FBI, respectively, are also examined, and it is noted that these 
breaches were not detected through the use of intuition or speculation, but rather through concrete evidence and 
careful investigation.
