according to the Portland Police Bureau, hurled an open pocketknife at the officers guarding the 
courthouse." According to the Times, the "nightly assault on the federal courthouse has been

including longtime Black Lives Matter protesters" and the Wall of Moms group filed a lawsuit

internally acknowledging they have contributed to the quick escalation between law 
enforcement and groups of protesters, which had dwindled to a couple hundred people or less 
earlier this month. 'Anytime you shoot someone in the face and beat them with a baton, it's 
going to be criticized,' said one federal law enforcement official. 'That's not a controversial 
statement:" One "federal law enforcement source" said of Donavan La Bella, who was "shot...in 
the head with a crowd control weapon" by US Marshals, "Crowds were very small and the
