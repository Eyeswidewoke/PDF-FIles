The Daily Caller (11/12, Lancaster, 716K) reports that TikTok would be "barred from using 
the web-hosting services of any U.S. based company, like Amazon and Alphabet, making the 
app essentially useless." The company is "asking for an injunction from U.S. District Judge Carl 
Nichols because they say different plaintiffs who have different interests are involved in the 
Philadelphia case." If the preliminary junction "were lifted, it would be 'leaving Tik Tok's entire 
business in jeopardy."
