article highlighted that AG Bondi stressed that she had spent the morning with Director Patel, adding that: "I think 
we all are committed to working together now to make America safe again and that's what we're doing." The 
article added that AG Bondi had already been under scrutiny after an earlier document release in February that she 
hyped and handed out in binders to conservative influencers at the White House lacked any new revelations. When 
that first release flopped, AG Bondi accused officials of withholding files from her and claimed that the FBI later 
turned over a "truckload" of evidence with thousands of pages of additional documents. The Guardian (07/15, 
Stein) reported that Democratic members of the House judiciary committee are demanding that Republicans 
summon AG Bondi, Director Patel, and their deputies for a hearing into Jeffrey Epstein's death and sex-trafficking 
case. Democrats argue that a bipartisan public hearing with AG Bondi and Director Patel is necessary to restore 
public trust and resolve questions about a potential cover-up over Epstein's death. Wired (07/15, Mehrotra) 
reported that nearly three minutes of footage were cut from the surveillance video of Jeffrey Epstein's prison cell, 
contradicting the DOJ's claim that the released video was "full raw" footage. The cut footage was discovered 
through metadata analysis, which showed that one of the source clips was approximately 2 minutes and 53 
seconds longer than the segment included in the final video. The article noted that the FBI and DOJ have declined 
to comment on how the video was assembled and edited, raising questions about the integrity of the investigation 
into Epstein's death. Axios (07/15, Solender, Santaliz) reported that House Republicans voted down a Democratic 
attempt to force the Justice Department to release documents related to Jeffrey Epstein, with the vote falling along 
party lines (211-210). This is the second time this week Democrats have tried to bring the issue to a vote, pitting 
Republican loyalty to President Trump against their base's demand for transparency on the Epstein files. Despite 
the rejection, House Speaker Mike Johnson expressed support for releasing the documents, saying, "We should put 
everything out there and let the people decide it." Additional reporting on the story was provided by Rolling Stone

FBI Captures Former Marine Corps Reservist Accused of Shooting at ICE Officers at Texas Detention Center 
Fox News (07/15, Wehner) reported that the FBI has arrested Benjamin Song, a 32-year-old former Marine Corps 
reservist, in connection with a shooting at an ICE detention center in Texas on July 4. Song is accused of firing at ICE 
officers and faces charges including attempted murder of a federal officer and discharging a firearm in furtherance 
of a crime of violence. He had evaded capture for nearly 11 days before being apprehended by the FBI Dallas Field 
Office in Dallas. "The FBI has worked tirelessly to arrest everyone associated with the shooting at the Prairieland 
Detention Center," FBI Dallas Field Office Special Agent in Charge R. Joseph Rothrock said. "We would like to thank 
all the entities that publicized this case and assisted in our efforts to successfully locate Benjamin Song. His arrest is 
the result of our determination to protect not only the community, but also our law enforcement partners that 
were the targets of a coordinated attack," Rothrock continued. "We have said it before, the FBI will not tolerate 
acts of violence toward law enforcement and will thoroughly investigate anyone who commits these types of 
offenses." An additional article from Fox News (07/15, Bonavita) reported that federal authorities have charged 
John Phillip Thomas and Lynette Read Sharp with alleged accessory after the fact in connection with the targeted 
attack on a Texas ICE detention facility. Thomas and Sharp are accused of helping Song escape after the 
shooting. Dallas News (07/15, Nguyen) and Dallas Express (07/15, Washburn) also reported on the story. 
President Trump Accuses Sen. Adam Schiff of Mortgage Fraud in New Attack on Critic 
The Washington Post (07/15, Siegel) reported that President Trump accused Sen. Adam Schiff of mortgage fraud, 
claiming he misstated which home was his primary residence to secure a cheaper mortgage. A senior 
administration official stated that a criminal case had been referred to the Justice Department, but Schiff denied 
any wrongdoing, calling it "political retaliation" by Trump. The article assessed that the accusation is part of a larger 
pattern of the Trump administration targeting its critics, with experts questioning the timing and credibility of the 
allegations against Schiff. Additional reporting on the story was provided by Los Angeles Times (07/15, Rector, 
Nelson), New York Post (07/15, Nelson), CNN (07/15, Kaczynski, Steck), Axias (07/15, Walker), The Daily Beast
