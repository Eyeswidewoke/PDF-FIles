Warden Ousted From Federal Women's Prison Plagued by Sex Abuse 
The New York Times (03/12, Arango) reported that the warden of a federal women's prison in Northern California 
that has long been plagued by rampant sexual abuse was ousted from his job after a raid on the facility by FBI 
agents. The article added that the federal government said in a court filing on Monday that it had removed the 
acting warden, Arthur Dulgov, as well as the associate warden and two other top leaders at the Federal 
Correctional Institution, Dublin. The Federal Bureau of Prisons said it had installed new leaders to overhaul the 
facility in Dublin, Calif., about 40 miles east of San Francisco. The article noted that the scandal has resulted in an 
avalanche of litigation and allegations that sexual abuse has continued despite past leadership shake-ups. A 
spokesman for the Bureau of Prisons, in a statement, said the firings and the appointments of new leaders were 
meant to "create a positive change in culture" at the minimum-security prison. Nancy T. McKinney, a longtime 
Bureau of Prisons official, was installed as the interim warden. According to the article, the changes came hours 
after FBI agents raided the prison, carried away documents and computers, and sought to interview prison 
employees. Forbes (03/12, Pavlo) also reported on the story. 
Officials Warn of 'Alarming Increase' in Sex Attacks on Female Plane Passengers 
The Independent (03/12, Gooding) reported that two offenders have pleaded guilty to separate incidents of sexual 
assault on planes flying into Seattle, as prosecutors warn that reports of incidents keep on coming. On Friday, Jack 
Roberson, 69, entered his guilty plea over an incident on a flight from Vancouver in July 2023. The article noted 
that the FBI investigated 27 sexual misconduct cases aboard aircraft in 2018. By 2022 that number had more than 
tripled to 90 cases. By August 2023 62 cases were under investigation. That trend appears to have continued, with 
the attorney announcing another indictment in the past week. The article mentioned that in August 2023, FBI 
Special Agent Richard A Collodi said the bureau was committed to investigating such crimes. The article 
quoted Collodi, who said, "It is imperative for people to understand those who commit these types of crimes 
aboard aircraft will be held accountable, I'm concerned at the increase of these incidents and assure the traveling 
public the FBI and our partners will continue to investigate and prosecute any offender who victimizes someone on 
a plane." In 2022, the FBI explained that sexual assaults on aircraft were often different from other scenarios, as 
the victims tend to not know the perpetrator. 
FBI Warns Families of Sextortion, a Growing Threat Targeting Teen Boys in Philadelphia 
CBS News (03/12, Crawford) reported that sextortion is on the rise in the Philadelphia area, and the FBI wants 
minors and families to be aware of the crime. Sextortion is when someone online poses as a young person, 
convinces a real teenager to send them explicit photos and then once they have the photos, the scammer 
blackmails the young person for money. The threats become so intense, that the FBI says sextortion has led to at 
least 20 suicides nationwide. The article added that according to the FBI, the connection between criminals and 
teens can start anywhere young people communicate online, including a messaging platform, app, or video game. 
Step one for the scammer is getting a sexually explicit picture from a teenager. The article quoted Alexis Krieger, a 
victims specialist with FBI Philadelphia, who said, "That reciprocity. I'll show you if you show me. Sometimes they 
have photos from other victims that they then use to entice that child, almost a catfishing kind of scam," The article 
stated that the crime has become more common in the last few years. According to FBI statistics, there were 14 
reports of sextortion in 2021 in the Philadelphia region. In 2022, that number jumped to 110, and in 2023, there 
were 130 reports. The article quoted Donald Asper, a Supervisory Special Agent with FBI Philadelphia, who 
said, "It's not just a single actor, you're looking at organizations, you're looking at people that this is their sole 
source of income, often they're overseas, so this makes it harder to track down." 
Former Jacksonville Jaguars Employee Who Stole $22 Million Sentenced to Three Years in Jail 
The Associated Press (03/12, Long) reported that a former Jacksonville Jaguars financial manager who pled guilty to 
stealing more than $22 million from the NFL franchise through its virtual credit card program was sentenced to 78 
months in federal prison Tuesday. The article added that Judge Henry Lee Adams Jr. sentenced Amit Patel, 31, in 
the U.S. District Court in Jacksonville. Patel, wearing a charcoal suit and a burgundy tie, showed no emotion inside 
the packed courthouse as the punishment was handed down. Prosecutors said Patel has returned $1.89 million, 
leaving his restitution tab at $21,132,454.40 — a figure the judge acknowledged he will never be able to pay back 
following a felony conviction. Patel pled guilty in December to one count of wire fraud and one count of making an 
illegal monetary transaction. According to the article, Patel's lawyers said he gambled away "approximately 99%" of
