Department of Homeland Security who recently stepped down and has since been pointedly 
critical of Trump." 
In an opinion piece for the Washington Post (10/8, 14.2M) , Kathleen Belew writes, "This 
isn't just a one-off event or the work of a few mad actors — it's part of a rising tide of white 
power activity, one that poses an imminent danger to American democracy. The Department of 
Homeland Security's threat assessment report, released earlier this week after a long wait, 
made that clear: White power movement violence and affiliated extremism is, by far, the 
greatest terrorist threat to our nation." Belew adds, "Not only does this kind of extremist 
violence outstrip any violence carried out by what President Trump has referred to as 'antifa 
and the left; but white power violence now also exceeds the threat of radical Islamist terror. 
The DHS assessment makes clear that '2019 was the most lethal year for extremism in the 
United States since the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995.w

Texas Police Officer Charged With Price Murder Fired. 
CNN (10/8, Razek, Chavez, 83.16M) reports on its website that Wolfe City, Texas, officials on 
Thursday said police officer Shaun Lucas was terminated from his position "for his egregious 
violation of the City's and police department's policies" in the fatal shooting of 31-year-old Black 
man Jonathan Price. CNN says Lucas was charged with murder earlier this week. He "was 
responding to a report of a disturbance and a possible fight in progress Saturday at a 
convenience store in Wolfe City when he shot Price four times in the torso, the probable cause 
affidavit released by the Hunt County District Clerk said." 
The Washington Post (10/8, Berman, 14.2M) calls Lucas "one of the rare law enforcement 
officers to face criminal prosecution for shooting and killing someone while on duty." 
Cole's Family Vows To Continue Fight Against Officer Who Killed Him. 
The AP (10/8, Richmond) reports Kimberley Motley, an attorney for the family of Black teen 
Alvin Cole, who was killed by Wauwatosa Police Officer Joseph Mensah, "vowed Thursday to 
keep fighting and working to prove racism pervades the officer's department, after a prosecutor 
declined to file charges in the case." Motley said she intends to file a federal lawsuit against 
Mensah, and "sued in state court on Tuesday seeking department documents that she believes 
will show Mensah's supervisors are racist and that officers have racially profiled Black drivers for 
years." She also seeks to have both Mensah and Police Chief Barry Weber fired. In addition, 
Cole's sister Taleavia said to protesters Wednesday that Milwaukee County District Attorney 
John Chisholm, who is white, must step down; she "said he has shown bias against Black 
families in his more than 20 years as a prosecutor," though "she didn't cite examples."

The Kansas City Star (10/8, Rice, Kite, 549K) reports the office of Jackson County Prosecutor 
Jean Peters Baker is reviewing the arrest of Deja Stallings, a pregnant Black woman, and is 
asking the Kansas City Police Department to conduct its own investigation. According to the
