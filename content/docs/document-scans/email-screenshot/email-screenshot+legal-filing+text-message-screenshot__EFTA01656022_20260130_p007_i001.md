The Times (06/05, Moody) reported that Nathan Vilas Laatsch, a 28-year-old U.S. intelligence worker, has been 
arrested for allegedly trying to leak state secrets to Germany's Federal Intelligence Service (BND). According to the 
article, Laatsch, who had "top secret" clearance, reportedly copied sensitive information onto paper files and a USB 
drive, and attempted to pass it to the BND via email, citing disagreement with the U.S. administration's values. The 
article noted that the BND tipped off American intelligence, leading to an FBI investigation, and Laatsch was caught 
after handing over classified information to an undercover FBI agent posing as a BND contact.

CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS 
North Carolina Judge Revokes Bond for House Party Shooting Suspect 
The Associated Press (06/05, Staff Writer) reported that a North Carolina judge ordered Thursday that a defendant 
accused in last weekend's shootings at a house party that left one person dead and 11 others injured stay in jail 
while awaiting trial. The decision came the day after another judge had set a $200,000 bond for Garon Nathaniel 
Killian, 20, of Lenoir, who is charged with one count of attempted first-degree murder related to the shootings. 
Prosecutors on Wednesday had asked that no bond be allowed. The article mentioned that Killian had not posted 
the amount to be released. On Thursday, when Killian had a court date for charges involving a different altercation 
in April, District Court Judge Scott Conrad revoked the $200,000 bond related to last weekend's violent fracas, 
according to the Catawba County Clerk of Court's office. Investigators of the shootings that happened early Sunday 
believe at least 80 shots were fired in a crime scene that spanned several properties along a road in the usually 
quiet residential neighborhood. FBI agents spent this week at the scene examining bullet trajectories. WLOS (ABC-
13) (06/05, Doty) and WCNC (NBC-36) (06/05, Lee, Pierre) also reported on the story.

Thursday. The BORTAC team's deployment from South Texas will help state and local law enforcement agencies 
who are looking for convicted murderer Grant Hardin. Hardin, 56, escaped May 25 from the North Central Unit 
state prison in Calico Rock, Arkansas, according to the Arkansas Department of Corrections. The FBI is offering a 
reward of up to $20,000 for information leading to his capture. Hardin is considered armed and dangerous and the 
public is urged to call law enforcement and the FBI with information on him, the FBI says. 
Five Highs Gang Members Convicted by Jury of RICO Conspiracy, Drug Trafficking, and Firearms Offenses 
KARE (NBC-11) (06/05, Staff Writer) reported that five members of a prominent north Minneapolis street gang 
were convicted Thursday in the second major federal racketeering (RICO) case involving the gang. Following a 
three-week trial, a jury found five members of the Highs gang out of north Minneapolis guilty of several federal 
crimes, including murder, drug trafficking, weapons violations, robberies and assaults. "The Highs have long 
terrorized north Minneapolis, bringing drugs, violence, and murder into our community," said Acting U.S. Attorney 
Joseph H. Thompson in a press release. "This verdict represents yet another step in our fight against gang 
violence." A DOJ press release noted that the ATF, FBI, Minneapolis Police Department, IRS Criminal Investigation, 
U.S. Postal Inspection Service, Hennepin County Sheriff's Office, Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, and 
Minnesota Department of Corrections are investigating the case. 
FBI Warns Students and Parents Over Online Sextortiont 
WBFF (Fox-45) (06/05, Depietro) reported that the FBI is warning students and parents about a growing threat 
online called 'sextortion, so they know how to avoid risky situations and ask for help if they're being victimized. 
According to the article, the growing online threat is on the rise this summer, with students home from school for 
the summer. The outlet spoke with FBI Supervisory Special Agent, Leslie Adamczyk, to discuss those growing 
concerns. She says there are both sexually motivated predators as well as financially motivated predators. The 
article quoted Adamczyk, who said, "It's not for large amounts of money; usually, it's for gift cards, $50 or $100, 
never more than a couple hundred dollars. Those happen really quickly and what is alarming about is we've had a 
lot of death by suicide in those cases." Adamczyk says that the concern for sextortion ranges from young children 
all the way to teenagers. She says that as soon as a child is in front of a device, they are subject to sextortion.
