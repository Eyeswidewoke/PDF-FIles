fees may change. we recommend that you contact the airline you are traveling on for the latest information 
regarding airline specific baggage rules, requirements and fees. 
SEATS 
If you have requested a seat to be assigned, we will send your request to the airline. Airline may or may not be 
able to confirm your request. We recommend that you choose our Enhanced Seat Assignment program for 
specialized seating allocation assistance by our dedicated seat assignment team. At times airlines may not be able 
to assign specific seats or seats sitting together. Occasionally seats can be assigned only at the check-in counter 
at the airport. 
VOLUNTARY CHANGES 
Although most itineraries ticketed by CheapOair allow for changes, the majority of these itinerary changes require 
the issuance of a new ticket, as per airline policy. All changes are subject to availability, airline rules and 
regulations, penalties and a difference from the original airfare and our service fees. The airline has the final 
authority regarding itinerary changes and penalties. 
INVOLUNTARY CHANGES (CHANGES DONE DIRECTLY BY THE AIRLINE) 
Airlines may make changes to a scheduled flight itinerary that is beyond our control. In these cases, if the airline 
notifies us with a viable option, we will send you an e-mail with the changes as well as the option the airline is 
offering. If the airline does not provide us with a viable option, as a valued customer, your reservation will be 
reviewed and assisted by one of our Schedule Change Specialists.

effective only once the insurance premium is received in full. The coverage you have purchased will only cover the
