DOJ Urges Supreme Court to Turn Away Epstein Accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell's Appeal 
ABC News (07/14, Hill) reported that the DOJ has urged the Supreme Court to reject Ghislaine Maxwell's appeal, arguing that her prosecution was 
not barred by Jeffrey Epstein's 2007 non-prosecution agreement. According to the article, Maxwell, who is serving a 20•year prison sentence for 
conspiring with Epstein to abuse underage girls, claims that the agreement's co-conspirator clause should have protected her from prosecution in 
New York. The article noted that the DOJ argues that the clause only applied to the Southern District of Florida and was not intended to bind other 
federal districts, and that Maxwell was not an intended beneficiary of the agreement. Additional reporting on the story was provided by The Daily 
Beast (07/14, Vaillancourt), Fox News (07/14, Oliver), Law & Crime (07/14, Naham), Newsweek (07/14, Plummer), Washington

Reuters (07/14, Erickson) reported that the Trump administration is being criticized for lacking transparency in its spending decisions, leaving

the Trump administration has provided less detail on how it plans to spend taxpayer dollars, drawing criticism from some Republicans in 
Congress. "Delayed budgets, missing details, and omitted spend plans make the federal budget less transparent and less accountable to the people 
and their elected representatives,' Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine told Russell Vought, director of the U.S. Office of Management and 
Budget, at a June 25 hearing. The article noted that the administration's reluctance to share detailed spending plans has placed Cabinet 
secretaries in the hot seat on Capitol Hill for the last several weeks, as the funding law required these details by the end of April. al'm doing the 
best I can; Director Patel said at his May hearing, pointing the finger at other parts of the administration when hounded about the lack of 
spending details.

classified information about the Russia-Ukraine war on a foreign online dating platform. According to the article, Slater, who had top secret 
clearance, shared secret information about military targets and Russian military capabilities with an unnamed coconspirator claiming to be a 
woman living in Ukraine. The article noted that Slater faces a potential prison sentence of between 5 years and 10 months and 7 years and 3 
months, with the government recommending a term at the low end of that range. "Mr. Slater betrayed an oath he made to safeguard our nation's
