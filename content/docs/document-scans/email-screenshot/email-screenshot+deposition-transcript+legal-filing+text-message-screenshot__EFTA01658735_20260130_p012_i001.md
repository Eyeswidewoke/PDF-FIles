tried to hire a contract killer to do away with a federal prosecutor and the key witness in a 
Kentucky drug case in which Gilbert was convicted, the complaint said. Gilbert is charged with 
retaliating against an informant, murder for hire and money laundering, the complaint said. 
Unknown to Gilbert, the `hit man' he was talking with was an undercover FBI agent, the 
complaint said." 
The Greenwood (SC) Index-Journal (11/12, 35K) reports, "Gilbert, who is currently 
confined in Edgefield Federal Correctional Institution, was indicted on counts of murder for hire, 
retaliation against an informant and money laundering. Gilbert, 51, was arrested in 2017 after 
selling methamphetamine to two undercover officers in Kentucky. Last year, he was sentenced 
to 130 months in prison." The Index-Journal adds, "Last month, a confidential informant in the 
prison told authorities Gilbert planned to have the informant associated with his 2017 arrest 
killed. Afterward, the affidavit said, Gilbert was hoping to have someone kill an assistant U.S. 
attorney and perhaps a Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives agent who worked 
his case. The informant's notes included names of the individuals. At the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation's direction, the informant arranged a number of phone conversations between 
Gilbert and an undercover agent that included discussion of how to kill the target and how 
Gilbert would compensate him. He even told the agent how to drive to the target's house while 
avoiding cameras." 
The Spartanburg (SC) Herald-Journal (11/12, Boyd, 134K) reports, "Following multiple 
recorded phone calls, Gilbert sent the undercover officer a $2,000 check from his prison 
canteen account as a down payment for the retaliatory murder-for-hire, investigators say. 
Masking the true purpose of this payment, Gilbert attempted to mislead prison officials by 
saying the payment was for an `investment firm; investigators say. Gilbert drew maps of where 
he believed the witness from Kentucky lived, and he provided directions on how to avoid 
detection by nearby surveillance cameras, investigators say. Gilbert planned to use the income 
from two rental properties in Kentucky to facilitate the attempted murder-for-hire and 
retaliation plot, according to investigators." Also reporting are WSPA-TV Greenville, SC (11/12,

Documents Show Alleged Whitmer Kidnapping Plot Ringleader Planned To Take 
Hostages At Capitol Building. 
WXYZ-TV Detroit (11/12, 236K) reports, "According to newly released court documents, the 
alleged plot to kidnap and kill Governor Gretchen Whitmer included everyone watching it on TV, 
that it would take about a week and that no one was coming out alive." According to WXYZ-TV, 
"The plot was allegedly made by Adam Fox who state and federal officials have called the 
alleged ringleader. The documents spell out a Plan A that included recruiting 200 men, taking 
over the entire state Capitol building, taking hostages, executing `tyrants' and have it televised. 
A secondary plan was to lock the door and set the building on fire. Fourteen men have been 
charged by the state and the feds in related cases. These documents were filed in Jackson 
County Court last month where Pete Musico was in tears while a judge considered lowering 
bond from $1 million to $100,000." 
The Detroit News (11/12, Dickson, 825K) reports, "The eight-page brief, filed in October 
in a bid to block a bond reduction for defendant Pete Musico, 42, of Munith was obtained 
Thursday by The Detroit News. The document sheds light on two plots the Wolverine Watchmen 
allegedly formed in June, and how, according to authorities, the group's focus shifted from 
storming the Capitol building in Lansing to kidnapping the state's chief executive. Plan A was 
revealed only after alleged participant Adam Fox checked the backs and chests of Musico, Joe 
Morrison, Ty Garbin, Paul Bellar, Daniel Harris and Amanda Keller for wires. The plan: Storm the 
Capitol building in Lansing, `take hostages, execute tyrants and have it televised.' Then there 
was Plan B: Storm the Capitol while the Legislature was in session, lock every door, and burn 
down the building with everyone inside." The Detroit Free Press (11/12, 1.52M) also reports.
