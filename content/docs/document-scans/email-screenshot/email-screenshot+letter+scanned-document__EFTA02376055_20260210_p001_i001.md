Jamaican digit ratio revised letter to the Editor.doc 
> how can i help 
Jeffrey 
Many thanks for this offer of help; meanwhile I hope to see you in NYC on a day, place and time of your choosing. I 
return to work on Monday September 9 and that Thursday the 12th I have an important eye-appointment re a scratched 
cornea off of my retinal operation (fortunately the latter is coming along nicely). Otherwise ANY day (except Monday 
lunch) is good. 
Meanwhile, I have almost finalized the work-plan: about 4 scientists will measure knee, ankle and foot asymmetry, the 
first two variables with calipers (twice each) and foot length automatically from a machine. We will Xerox hands, mostly 
for 2nd:4th digit ratios (see below) but also as partial controls for the foot measurements (Xeroxing introduces small 
and, alas, non-random biases but the alternative of calipers is far too 
time-consuming.) Height, weight, age, performance at different times and over different distances, measured to 0.01 
seconds, will all be provided by the two local athletic associations. 
Key according to the head of one (Bruce James) is to minimize each athlete's time-20 minutes max being measured and 
hopefully next to no wait time. If so, we could do 100 (70 males, as it turns out and 30 females) in 
3 to 4 days and do a (smaller) control sample of non-runners in a day or two. 
Bruce tells me the elite runners will do so because he tells them to, while the non-elite will do it for the money 
(presently $200/head). Usain and Shelley Ann are unlikely mostly because they are apt to be off the island but he says, 
were they here, they just might be curious (and 
motivated) to have their knees measured too. 
If you have never been to Jamaica before, this might be a nice time. Work will take place at U Tech and U of West Indies, 
the two major campuses in Kingston very close to each other. Of course I can find us some nice hotels and while long-
legged Bulgarian beauties and top European scientists are never out of style, Jamaica is also famous, if not for its 
scientists, at least for its beauties! (And as your host, I am licensed to carry—as we say in Florida!). 
I am attaching a second paper supported by your grant (in press in Human Biology as a letter, due out in October). It is 
not nearly as important as the symmetry paper, but is actually the reason we ran the races in the first place, previous 
work having shown that the smaller your second digit compared to your fourth (in both sexes) the greater your 
endurance in races. We could only use a very weak measure (speed in 200m divided by speed in 100m) because it was 
impractical on my property to run longer races. In other words we subtracted raw speed (100) from raw speed plus 
endurance (200). We did indeed find the expected correlation.
