Politico (09/11, Orden) reported that Director Patel came under heavy scrutiny after he prematurely suggested on social media that a suspect in 
the assassination of Charlie Kirk had been taken into custody, only to later correct the statement when the person was released. According to the 
article, Director Patel was already facing backlash from across the political spectrum over allegations of politically motivated FBI firings, the 
bureau's handling of files related to Jeffrey Epstein, and internal turmoil following senior agents' resignations and reassignments. The article said 
critics—including far•rlght commentators and former FBI officials—condemned Director Patel's public misstep during the high•profile 
investigation, while some lawmakers planned to question him in upcoming Senate and House judiciary Committee hearings about both the firings 
and the FBI's refusal to release further Epstein documents. The article noted that Director Patel's defenders, such as Rep. Jim Jordan (R•Ohio), 
praised his leadership and the bureau's record under his tenure, even as former agents advised him to avoid posting updates on social media until 
investigations were complete. The Daily Mail (09/11, Potter) reported that Director Patel fired Mehtab Syed, the special agent in charge of Utah's 
FBI division, Just a month before she would have led the manhunt for Charlie Kirk's assassin. According to the article, Syed was a highly respected 
and experienced agent who had held significant roles in the FBI, including head of cyberterrorism and counterterrorism in the Los Angeles field 
office. Syed was fired just six months after she was appointed in February, with sources telling NBC that the reasons for her sacking were not clear. 
Associate Deputy Director j. William Rivers reportedly told Syed that she wasn't a good fit for the office. Additional reporting on the story was

Times (09/11, Thrush, Barrett, Goldman). 
Authorities Say Student Who Had Been Radicalized Fired Revolver at Colorado School, Wounding Two 
The Associated Press (09/11. Slevin, Brown) reported that a 16•year•old student, Desmond Holly, opened fire with a revolver at Evergreen High 
School in Colorado, wounding two students before shooting himself and later dying from his injuries. According to the article, authorities said 
Holly had been "radicalized by some extremist network," though they have not yet released details about the group or how the radicalization 
occurred. The article said Holly fired repeatedly while reloading multiple times as students sheltered in place or fled the building, but secured 
doors prevented him from entering certain areas, limiting further casualties. Investigators are searching Holly's home, backpack, and locker, 
reviewing surveillance footage, and considering whether his parents could face charges for allowing him access to the firearm. The article noted 
that both shooting victims remain in critical condition and that officials praised the rapid police response while acknowledging the ongoing toll of 
school shootings on communities. The Denver Post (09/11, Bradbury, Hernandez) added that Holly appeared to support white supremacist views 
online and showed an interest in mass shootings in the days before the attack. The article stated that the social media accounts include references 
to Holocaust denial, and the name on the TikTok account appeared to end with a reference to a prominent white supremacist slogan. That account 
reposted several videos showing school shooting scenes from movies, as well as another video that appeared to show the two Columbine 
shooters taking target shots at bowling pins. Other videos the account reposted were explicitly antisemitic or depicted people in Nazi uniforms. 
Director Patel posted a statement on X: Our @FBIDenver team continues to work with our partners regarding the investigation of the shooting at 
Evergreen High School yesterday afternoon in Colorado. We have deployed our evidence response team and other specialty resources as part of 
our response to this incident The suspect is deceased from his self•infiicted injuries and has been identified as a student at the school, 16.year. 
old Desmond Holly. Most importantly, our thoughts continue to be with the two victims injured in the shooting and all those who have been 
impacted by this horrific attack. We will share more as we are able. Additional reporting on the story was provided by Axios (09/11, Alvarez), CBS

Suspect in Trump Assassination Attempt Veers off Topic and Forfeits Opening Statement at Trial 
The Associated Press (09/11, Fischer) reported that Ryan Routh, the man accused of attempting to assassinate former President Donald Trump 
during a golf outing in South Florida, forfeited his right to continue his opening statement after veering off topic to discuss Adolf Hitler and wars 
in Ukraine and Gaza. U.S. District judge Aileen Cannon twice removed jurors from the courtroom before ending Routh's statement when he 
refused to stay on the case's subject matter. According to the article, prosecutors told jurors that Routh had methodically plotted the attack for 
weeks, aiming his rifle from the bushes before a Secret Service agent spotted him and opened fire, forcing him to flee without shooting. Five 
witnesses testified Thursday, including two Secret Service agents, two FBI agents, and a bystander who followed Routh's car after the shooting to 
record his license plate number. The article noted that Routh, representing himself, asked only a few questions on cross•examination—referring 
to himself in the third person—and that the trial is expected to last two to three weeks. ABC News (09/11, Charalambous), Al lazeera (09/11,

Bipartisan House Panel to Revisit 9/11 Intelligence Failures as Declassified FBI Files Point to Saudi Advance Team' Role 
The Hill (09/11, Rego) reported that Rep. Elise Stefanik (R•NY) will chair a bipartisan House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence review 
of the 9/11 Commission Report to evaluate progress on the report's recommendations for the intelligence community. The 2004 report concluded 
that agencies responsible for national security had failed to grasp the seriousness of the threat prior to the attacks and cited bureaucratic 
rivalries, outdated structures, and insufficient resources across the intelligence community, including the CIA and FBI. According to the article, the 
report also called for a National Counterterrorism Center, a director of national intelligence, and stronger congressional oversight, as well as 
strengthened capabilities for the FBI and homeland defenders. Stefanik will lead the working group alongside Rep. josh Gottheimer (D•NJ) and 
under the chairmanship of Rep. Rick Crawford (RalC), with public and private hearings planned ahead of final recommendations on Sept 11, 
2026. The article noted that Crawford emphasized the need to ensure the intelligence community stays ahead of modern threats and avoids 
failures like those preceding 9/11. The New York Post (09/11, Christenson) reported that newly declassified FBI documents suggest Saudi 
Arabian government employees may have acted as an "advance team" for the 9/11 hijackers, helping prepare logistics years before the attacks. An 
FBI investigation from the New York Field Office linked Riyadh officials Mutaib al Sudairy and Adel Mohammad al Sadhan to two hijackers, Nawaf 
al•Hazmi and Khalld al•Mihdhar, as well as others who supported them in California. According to the article, the FBI files cite phone records, 
financial transactions, interviews, and even videos showing the Saudis visiting Washington, D.C., filming landmarks, and attending a February 
2000 "welcome party" for hijackers, with one FBI source estimating a "50/50 chance" that a Saudi contact had prior knowledge of the plot Bill 
Evanina, former director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, said the records provide "new investigative leads" for the FBI
