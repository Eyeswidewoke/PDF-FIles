Continued Reporting: New York Man Pleads Guilty to Firing Shots Outside Albany Synagogue 
New York Daily News (02/05, Wilkinson) reported that an upstate New York man pleaded guilty Tuesday to firing 
two shotgun blasts outside a Jewish synagogue in Albany on the first night of Hanukkah in 2023. Mufid Fawaz 
Alkhader, 29, had been arrested at the scene outside Temple Israel on Dec. 7, 2023, after the gunfire sent the 
synagogue into lockdown. According to the article, Alkhader shouted "Free Palestine!" outside the house of 
worship and later told federal investigators that "events in the Middle East have impacted him." The article pointed 
out that he opened fire exactly two months after Hamas attacked Israel, sparking the brutal and ongoing war in 
Gaza. The article quoted U.S. Attorney Carla Freedman, who said in a statement, "The defendant's violent, 
antisemitic and terrifying act targeted the Temple Israel congregation, the larger Jewish community, and the right 
of every person to practice their religion without fear of violence." The article indicated that Alkhader pleaded 
guilty to obstructing the free exercise of religious beliefs by threat of force, brandishing a firearm during a crime 
and conspiring to purchase a firearm unlawfully. He faces a minimum of seven years in prison at his sentencing 
hearing in June. The article detailed that more than 60 children were inside Temple Israel at a daycare when 
Alkhader opened fire, according to investigators. No one was wounded by the blasts, and Alkhader's gun jammed 
before he could fire a third shot. The article mentioned that the firearm conspiracy charge was added because 
Alkhader acquired the weapon from another man, Andrew Miller, who illegally bought it for him in November 
2023. Miller copped to his role in the conspiracy and was sentenced to 14 months behind bars. A DOJ press release 
also quoted FBI Special Agent in Charge Craig Tremaroli, who said, "Mr. Alkhader's plea confirms his deliberate and 
premeditated intentions to illegally acquire a gun and use it to bring terror to the Temple Israel community as they 
were preparing to celebrate the first night of Hanukkah. Thanks to the swift actions of the Temple Israel community 
and our law enforcement partners, justice has been served. The FBI remains steadfast in our mission to ensure all 
our communities can live without fear of hateful violence." WGY (FM-103.1) (02/05, Staff Writer) also reported on

DOJ Says It Will Not Bring Charges in Investigation of Project Veritas 
The New York Times (02/05, Schmidt, Goldman) reported that the DOJ said on Wednesday that it would not bring 
charges against anyone affiliated with the group Project Veritas over their role in trying to publish the contents of a 
diary that had been stolen from Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s daughter in the final weeks of the 2020 election campaign. The 
article stated that the prosecutors, who made their announcement in a one-paragraph letter to a judge overseeing 
the matter, did not say why they were declining to bring additional charges in the long running investigation. In 
court filings in related cases, the DOJ had laid out evidence of the group's involvement in the effort to acquire and 
publish the diary, and had fought in court for access to evidence that investigators had obtained from the group's 
operatives. The article detailed that the investigation had raised difficult legal questions about the extent to which 
the First Amendment protected the publication of stolen materials. But it was unclear whether the decision was 
part of a larger pattern by the DOJ since President Trump took office to walk away from cases involving his allies. 
According to the article, Project Veritas and its founder, James O'Keefe, have long been favorites of Trump's and 
gained attention by using sting operations and undercover videos to seek to embarrass liberal groups and 
mainstream news organizations, among others. The article clarified that the investigation started in the final days 
of the 2020 campaign when federal prosecutors at the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan began examining how 
the group had obtained a diary that Biden's daughter Ashley had kept. The group tried to publicize the diary's 
contents in an attempt to undermine Biden's candidacy. During the investigation, court filings in the case said, the 
authorities learned that Project Veritas had paid for the diary. The article mentioned that in 2021, FBI agents with 
warrants searched the homes of several Project Veritas operatives. In response, members of the group went to 
court trying to stop federal prosecutors from using the evidence, setting off the yearslong court battle. The article 
noted that about a year later, two people pleaded guilty in connection with their roles in stealing the diary and 
selling it to the group. One of those individuals, Robert Kurlander, had his sentencing delayed on Wednesday until 
May.
