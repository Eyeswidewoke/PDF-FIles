FBI Daily News Briefing 
watchdog said. According to the article, Clearview was founded in 2017 with the backing of investors like PayPal 
and Palantir billionaire Peter Thiel. It quietly built up its database of faces from images available on websites like 
Instagram, Facebook, Venmo and YouTube and developed facial recognition software it said can identify people 
with a very high degree of accuracy. It was reportedly embraced by law enforcement and Clearview sold its services 
to hundreds of agencies, ranging from local constabularies to sprawling government agencies like the FBI and U.S. 
Immigrations and Customs Enforcement. 
Nearly 50 Years After Being Found Dead in a Pennsylvania Cave, 'Pinnacle Man' Is Identified 
The Associated Press (09/03, Shipkowski) reported that the body of a man found frozen in a small Pennsylvania 
cave nearly 50 years ago has finally been identified. The remains of Nicolas Paul Grubb, 27, of Fort Washington, 
were discovered in January 1977 by two hikers who had ducked inside the cave to escape some inclement weather. 
Grubb has long been known as the "Pinnacle Man," a reference to the Appalachian mountain peak near where his 
body was found. According to the article, an autopsy at the time found no signs of foul play and determined that 
he died from a drug overdose. Authorities, though, could not identify Grubb's body from his appearance, 
belongings, clothing or dental information. Fingerprints were collected during his autopsy but somehow were 
misplaced, according to the Berks County Coroner's Office. Detectives from the state police and investigators with 
the coroner's office had periodically revisited the case over the past 15 years and Grubb's body was exhumed in 
August 2019 after dental records linked him to two missing person cases in Florida and Illinois. The article added 
that DNA samples did not match in either case, but a break came last month in when a Pennsylvania state trooper 
found Grubb's missing fingerprints. Within an hour of submitting the card to the National Missing and Unidentified 
Persons System, an FBI fingerprint expert matched them to Grubb. A relative of Grubb was notified of the discovery 
and family members asked the coroner's office to place his remains in a family plot. 
Opinion: The FBI Leads the Way on Jawboning Governance 
An opinion piece by Lawfare (09/03, Perault) stated that the FBI leads the world in jawboning governance. While 
law enforcement agencies may not be known for transparency or self-governance, the FBI now stands alone among 
federal agencies in publicly communicating self-imposed rules on its communications with tech platforms. 
According to the author, in guidance posted on the FBI's website on Aug. 1, the Bureau outlined its approach to 
communicating with social media platforms about content they host. In doing so, it became the first federal agency 
to publish clear, public standards for jawboning. The author stated that the FBI's leadership on this issue 
establishes a principled foundation for resuming information sharing with tech companies and provides some level 
of public transparency about its practices. If they are well-designed and well-governed, information-sharing 
programs have the potential to reduce harmful content and conduct; the resumption of the FBI's program 
already has disrupted Russian propaganda operations. Some gaps still remain, and the Bureau could fill those over 
time. The author added that the focus should not be on these gaps but, instead, on the FBI's leadership in taking a 
step forward on this issue. Other agencies should follow the FBI's lead, giving guidance to their employees, tech 
platforms, and the public about the norms that govern government-platform communication.
