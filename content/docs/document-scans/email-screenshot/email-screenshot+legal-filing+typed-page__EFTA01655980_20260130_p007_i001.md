COUNTERINTELLIGENCE 
China Targets U.S. Military Members in Overseas Spy Operations, Former CIA Station Chief Warns 
Fox News (05/30, Sabes) reported that a former CIA station chief, Dan Hoffman, warns that China is targeting U.S. 
military service members and government employees in its overseas spy operations. According to the article, two 
active-duty Army soldiers, Jian Zhao and Li Tian, were arrested for allegedly selling "Top Secret" information to 
individuals based in China, highlighting China's efforts to gather sensitive information. The article explained 
that China is using "cut-outs" to recruit individuals with access to US government information, and experts say the 
country will use any tactics necessary to obtain military secrets, with the goal of gaining an advantage in a potential 
war with the U.S. "While bribery and corruption have thrived under China's Communist Party, this behavior cannot 
be tolerated with our service members who are entrusted with sensitive military information, including national 
defense information," said Director Patel on the charges. 
Intelligence Agency Employee Accused of Attempting to Leak Classified Documents Out of Frustration 
With Trump 
Politico (05/29, Bianco) reported that the Department of Justice has accused Nathan Villas Laatsch, an employee of 
the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), of attempting to leak classified documents to a foreign government due to 
his frustration with President Donald Trump. Laatsch, who worked in the DIA's Insider Threat Division, a unit 
responsible for detecting employees who might disclose sensitive information, allegedly offered to share classified 
material with a "friendly foreign government" in an email, stating that he disagreed with the values of the current 
administration. The FBI obtained the email and set up an undercover operation, posing as representatives of the 
foreign country, and received classified material from Laatsch at a pre-arranged location in northern Virginia, 
leading to his arrest on Thursday. According to court documents, Laatsch expressed his dissatisfaction with the 
current administration and stated that he intended to act in support of the values that the United States once 
stood for, and he was also seeking citizenship in a foreign country due to conditions in the U.S. The FBI Washington 
Field Office is investigating the case, and Laatsch is scheduled to make an initial court appearance in Alexandria, 
Virginia. "This case underscores the persistent risk of insider threats;' Director Patel wrote on X. "The FBI remains 
steadfast in protecting our national security and thanks our law enforcement partners for their critical 
support." Additional reporting on the story was provided by AlxNow (05/29, Belmore), Associated Press (05/29, 
Staff Writer), Hindustan Times (05/29, Vaidyanathan), WUSA (CBS-9) (05/29, Cremen). 
Continued Reporting: Nellie Ohr Lied In Trump-Russia Probe Testimony, FBI Docs Allege 
Daily Caller (05/29, VanBuskirk) reported that Nellie Ohr allegedly lied to Congress during her 2018 testimony 
about her role in the Trump-Russia investigation, according to newly declassified FBI documents. The documents 
suggest that Ohr's statements contradict her husband Bruce Ohr's testimony and the FBI's findings, which indicate 
she conducted research on Donald Trump and Paul Manafort's alleged ties to Russian organized crime. The FBI 
alleges that Nellie Ohr's denial of involvement in the Steele dossier was materially false, and Republican Senator 
Chuck Grassley has criticized the DOJ for not holding her accountable for apparent felonies. Just the News (05/29, 
Spicer) and The Blaze (05/29, Garcia) also reported on the story. 
Rubio's Visa Announcement Follows Several Incidents of Federal Charges 
Fox News (05/29, Oliver) reported that the Trump administration increased scrutiny on Chinese nationals at U.S. 
universities due to alleged espionage and misleading activities. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced plans to 
"aggressively revoke" visas of Chinese students linked to the Chinese Communist Party. The article explained that 
several incidents involving Chinese nationals at U.S. universities include espionage charges, illegal entry into 
military bases, and unauthorized photography of defense sites. The article highlighted DOJ charges against five 
University of Michigan students last year after a sergeant major encountered them at Camp Grayling in 2023. They 
were all Chinese nationals attending the University of Michigan as part of the school's joint program with a 
Shanghai-based university, an FBI official wrote in the complaint, noting some of them had taken photos of Camp 
Grayling's military installations and operations. The FBI asked the court to issue arrest warrants for the students for 
making false statements and destroying records. Politico (05/29, Mackinnon, Eimil, Kine) reported that the FBI's 
China Initiative, established during President DONALD TRUMP's first term to protect U.S. science and technology 
from Chinese espionage, was shuttered after a review during the Biden administration found that it created a 
"harmful perception" of racial bias. A number of researchers and academics with Chinese roots have been wrongly 
accused of espionage.
