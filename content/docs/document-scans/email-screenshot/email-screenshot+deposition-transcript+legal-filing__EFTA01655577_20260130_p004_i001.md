Agents Say Mass Firings Could Dangerously Weaken FBI in Three Ways 
NBC News (02/05, Winter) reported that first-of-their-kind lawsuits, near-daily staff memos from the little-known 
acting FBI director, and abject fear among agents that they could lose their jobs have distracted and destabilized 
the FBI workforce, a half-dozen current and former federal law enforcement officials with experience in the Bureau 
told NBC News. According to the article, if the new administration fires or punishes agents involved in the Jan. 6 
investigations it could affect the FBI in three dangerous ways, the current and former law enforcement officials 
said. The article mentioned that many of the agents involved in the investigations of the riot at the Capitol on Jan. 
6, 2021, work in the FBI's Counterterrorism Division, which operates Joint Terrorism Task Forces in cities across the 
country with federal and local law enforcement agencies. Those agents investigate terrorism threats both from 
inside the United States and from overseas groups, such as ISIS, Al Qaeda, Hamas, and Hezbollah. So the potential 
removal of thousands of those agents — some estimate the number of counterterrorism agents could be over 
4,000 — poses a major threat to the FBI's ability to combat terrorist threats, the current and former officials 
say. Punishing thousands of Jan. 6 case agents could also damage FBI operations not related to terrorism, the 
current and former officials say. Agents from smaller FBI field offices, for example, were also brought in to work on 
Jan. 6 cases. Dismissing those agents could affect smaller FBI field offices that investigate misconduct by local law 
enforcement agencies, corporations and public officials. The article noted that retaliation against agents who 
worked on Jan. 6 investigations could also have a chilling effect on FBI agents' desire to investigate future cases 
involving the second Trump administration. The current and former officials say they wonder whether FBI officials 
would be willing to investigate, for example, a person in Trump's personal orbit. Firing agents would also be likely to 
damage efforts to retain veteran agents and recruit new ones, the current and former officials say. Agents fired for 
their work on Jan. 6 cases would be unable to get hired by other federal law enforcement agencies, the officials say. 
If they managed to get hired by local police departments, it would most likely be for less pay and lower retirement 
benefits. The Wall Street Journal (02/05, Gurman, barber, Viswanatha), WVEC (ABC-13) (02/05, Gooding), the 
Christian Science Monitor (02/05, Gass, Babcock), and CNN (02/05, Video) also reported on the story. 
Continued Reporting: FBI Agents Sue DOI, Allege Retaliation Over Jan. 6 Cases 
The Center Square (02/05, Guerra) reported that FBI agents involved in the Jan. 6 Capital riot investigations have 
filed lawsuits against the DOJ, challenging its efforts to survey and identify personnel who participated in high-
profile inquiries such as the riot and handling of classified documents at Mar-a-logo. The FBI Agents Association, a 
non-profit organization that supports and protects both current and retired FBI agents, represents one 
group. FBIAA President Natalie Bara and attorney Chris Mattei held a virtual press conference to discuss the legal 
action they are taking to prevent the DO1 from releasing the names of FBI employees involved in the Jan. 6 
investigations. Bara noted that releasing the names could endanger agents and their families. The second lawsuit, a 
class action filed by nine FBI agents, alleges that Acting Attorney General James McHenry and other top DOJ 
officials are engaging in politically motivated retribution. The lawsuit states, "plaintiffs reasonably believe and fear 
that the information gathered in the survey will also be used to target them for retaliatory discharge due to the 
Trump administration's perception of their loyalties. Donald Trump has made repeated public pronouncements of 
his intent to exact revenge upon persons he perceives to be disloyal to him by simply executing their duties in 
investigating acts incited by him and persons loyal to him." KSTU (Fox-13) (02/05, Carlisle), Newsweek(02/OS, 
Clark), and CTPost (02/05, Lockhart) also reported on the story. 
Sen. Chuck Grassley Says High-Level Justice, FBI Firings Justified 
The Quad City Times (02/05, Watson) reported that U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley does not take issue with firings of 
high-level FBI and DOJ officials, he told reporters on Wednesday. But low-level employees following orders should 
not be held responsible, he said. Grassley, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, noted on a call with reporters 
on Wednesday a memo to the workforce from high-level justice official that stated FBI agents "who simply followed 
orders and carried out their duties in an ethical manner" while investigating the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol are 
not at risk of being fired. "The purpose of the FBI is law enforcement and using people within the department for 
political purposes of weaponization of politics should be not a part of their operation," Grassley told reporters on 
Wednesday. "Now I blame this on the seventh floor of the FBI. It's not something that the FBI agents at the 
grassroots of Iowa or any other state are responsible for." Fox News (02/05, Video) also reported on the story.
