"I don't see where any of the procedures were ever followed to begin 
with," Colbath then said. 
He has since given Epstein's attorney. Jack Goldberger, an opportunity 
to argue that the document was properly sealed and why it should 
remain so. 
The deal promises a look at the behind-the-scenes justice struck for the 
New York money manager who according to Vanity Fair, hobnobbed 
with the likes of Prince Andrew and former President Bill Clinton. 
It's a secret agreement. A secret sweetheart agreement,' former Circuit 
Judge Bill Berger who now represents some of the women has said. 
"Everybody was in on this deal except the victims and the public. The 
public should be outraged it has gone as far as it has."

'Are you kidding? It's transparent. Certainly no one else gets treated like that? Edwards has said. 
Epstein is currently serving an lit-month sentence in the Palm Beach County Stockade alter pleading guilty a year ago in state court to felony 
solicitation of prostitution and procuring teenagers for prostitution. Epstein is allowed out, though, each day from 7 am. to I I p.m., a spokeswoman 
for the sheriffs office has said. 
The saga began years ago after Town of Palm Beach police began investigating reports that young women were being brought to his manse on El 
Brillo Way to massage him and have sex with him in exchange for money. 
Displeased with the way the State Attorney's Office handled the case, Palm Beach police later forwarded information to the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation. 
Epstein's own attorneys, in federal filings, have referred to Epstein's deferred prosecution agreement with federal prosecutors as *unprecedented" and 
'highly unusual." 
Goldberger has said he believes the law allows the record to continue to be sealed and is opposing it being opened..' .win has not gotten any spec]
