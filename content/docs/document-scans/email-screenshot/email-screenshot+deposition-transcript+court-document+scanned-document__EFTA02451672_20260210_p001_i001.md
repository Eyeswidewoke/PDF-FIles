Transaction com=lete ! 
. this - in spite of your collection of Elysium misfits. =!! 
With Brad out of the office and unable to run his usual=C2 interference , the level of his utter incompetence was 
brought=front and center, he may be a step up from Eileen, but if =e is , then it is not certainly not by much, . Though 
you =nd I have spent many many hours discussing the importance of det=ils and mechanics. I was not shown one 
document re phaidon=- not one.. Brad wanted to keep it private between he and his =o called " advisors " however as 
he was out of t=e office during the most important transaction of the year, I did g=t to spend time with joslin Joe and 
john, - the situation =n your office is wholly ludicrous - to summarize - =AO the list I provided to Brad last December -
things =AO I thought were a priority to get done after consulting with your =ffice still remains virtually undone. = 
IT, still desperately needed- reporting flawed c=mbersome and inaccurate . all done by hand as one -off exercisejune 
3 million in deductions Im told are take= for art space but on closer examination it turns out they can=ot be used at all. 
( ZERO benefit ) though you will be told yes they=were deducted on the return they said that is the question they get 
=sked ! " were they deducted " not -" is there a=benefit " !! I asked for the balance sheet and P a=d L for R=gan arts , 
a basic first step in order to check =our financials. "sorry we never got one?" though 9.= million invested, no p&I, 
nothing , a construction proje=t run amok , no budget, the coo fired after only 3 months. ,=C2 no clue . I can add that 
artspace financials are=also a total mess. 
As your friend and in order=toturn the page. I will try to be constructive 
The following is=C2 a list of things I think would be in your interest to g=t done asap .but definitely not by me . 
i sugges= you form new grats. , hire a high lev=l tax partner. use your trading accounts as they r=main the 
paramount requirement 16 months after i emailed to you thei= importance. , I suggest you consider having the 
49percent of =span>phai=on merged into artspance and have Richard buy artspace. re-do bank lo=ns. no need to pay 
interest at higher rates on boat or plane.. as R=chard is now no longer trustee. re- do will, make =span>suyd=m
