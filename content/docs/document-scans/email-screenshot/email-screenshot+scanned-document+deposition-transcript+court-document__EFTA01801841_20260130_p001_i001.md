Dear =effrey, 
I am really sorry to agree with you when you say that "this doesnR=7;t seem to be working", I mean the way we are or 
rather not communic=ting. 
The kitchen landing was drawn according to the as-built drawing provided to=me by Shane. While the landing is hidden 
behind a wall in the 3-d view, it =s apparent on the drawing #T 103- "Terrace view with plants" th=t there is a space left 
there. It's less visible, and I agree with yo=, can be kind of confusing on the drawing T#102, because of the similar sto=e 
texture given to the walls of the stairs and of the kitchen building. 
The stairs should not be a major issue from the kitchen bay since they are =ocated below and on the right side of the 
kitchen building. With the =uccession of terraces cascading on both sides of the staircase, and with a =arefully chosen 
planting scheme, the stairs will look fully integrated to t=e landscape and be part of the architectural interest of this part 
of the i=land. As far as your comment, "To go east before going westR=1; - the design allows the number of steps 
required to traverse the elevati=n change without encroaching any space upon the road, and to provide also a=direct 
access to the bicycle parking. 
It does take more than ten minutes, at least when you are confronted with y=ur drawing board and a desire to provide 
the best design possible, to make =ven a simple architectural sketch by hand or by computer. Especially when w= are 
addressing parts of the site that are already existing, such as the fi=st section of the staircase , the kitchen and the 
master suite buildings. 
I hope that you will understand that I am not trying to argue with you but =nly to make you realize that those sketches 
are not absent minded ones but =he result of a serious desire to find an adequate solution to the landscapi=g of this part 
of your property. 
As I said before, I do understand and accept your comments and do try=to answer them. But, it's hard to make any 
progress with this k=nd of non-communication of which I am putting the entire blame on myself. <=R> However in these 
conditions you will certainly agree with me that I may not=be the right person to work with in regard of the landscaping 
of little Sai=t James. 
Very sincerely and with my very best regards. 
Christian. 
im sorry„ this doesn;'t seem to be working. your desi=ns are not functional. one has to go east before going 
west. the view from =he kitchen is teh service entrance, your drawings show no kitchen landing, =the stairs are now a 
focal point though we discussed repeatedly their disap=earance„ there is no connection to the road and office pavillion„ 
I asked=that you NOT send me these type of presentation„ it takes your time and is=so clearly not right that a pencil and 
paper , no more than ten minutes is =equired to find better solutions.
