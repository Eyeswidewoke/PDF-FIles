US Sanctions Russian Government Research Institution For Cyberattacks Against Key 
Infrastructure Of Allies. 
The Wall Street Journal (10/23, Volz, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) reports that the Treasury 
Department on Friday sanctioned a Russian government research institution the Administration 
claims is responsible for carrying out cyberattacks against key infrastructure of US allies in the 
Middle East. 
The New York Times (10/23, Perlroth, 18.61M) reports, "The hacking group, Energetic 
Bear, is among Russia's stealthiest. It appears to be casting a wide net to find useful targets 
ahead of the election, experts said." Recent "intrusions marked the first time that researchers 
caught the group, a unit of Russia's Federal Security Service...targeting states and counties." In 
attacks in Germany and the US, "the group has infected websites popular in the energy sector, 
downloading malware onto the machines of anyone who visited the sites, then searching for 
employees with access to industrial systems." In other attacks elsewhere, the group "has 
hijacked the software updates for computers attached to industrial control systems." 
Louisiana National Guard Called In To Prevent Cyberattacks Weeks Prior To Election. 
In an exclusive, Reuters (10/23, Bing) reports the Louisiana National Guard "was called in to 
stop a series of cyberattacks aimed at small government offices across the state in recent 
weeks, according to two people with knowledge of the events, highlighting the cyber threat 
facing local governments in the run up to the 2020 U.S. presidential election." Reuters adds 
that "the situation in Louisiana follows a similar case in Washington state, according to a 
cybersecurity consultant familiar with the matter, where hackers infected some government 
offices with a type of malware known for deploying ransomware." It's uncertain as to whether 
the hackers aimed "to target systems tied to the election in Louisiana or were simply hoping for 
a payday. Yet the attacks raised alarms because of the potential harm it could have led to and 
due to evidence suggesting a sophisticated hacking group was involved." 
Bipartisan Bill Would Help National Guard Support States' Cybersecurity 
Modernization. 
ExecutiveGov (10/23) reported that Sens. Maggie Hassan (D-NH) and John Cornyn (R-TX) 
"have introduced a bill to help the U.S. National Guard support cybersecurity modernization 
across state and local governments." The legislation "would allow state governors to request the 
National Guard for help to keep critical infrastructure systems secure, Hassan's office said 
Wednesday." Potential efforts are "cybersecurity services and training duties to be performed by 
the National Guard." Hassan said "we must ensure that the National Guard can help with these 
types of threats just like any other threat that states face."
