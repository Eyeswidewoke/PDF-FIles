percolate online, courtesy of a social media ecosystem that's ubiquitous, barely moderated and 
well suited to helping aggrieved people find each other." 
Bloomberg (10/9, Wagner, Berthelsen, 4.73M) reports, "Facebook Inc. first approached 
the FBI six months ago about activity on its platform that led to 13 men being charged in 
Michigan with planning to storm the state capitol and kidnap the governor." Facebook "alerted" 
the FBI "that there were discussions happening on its social network about overthrowing the 
government and law enforcement, according to a person familiar with the tip who asked not to 
be identified discussing the confidential probe. The FBI was already investigating a Facebook 
Group for a Michigan militia, called the Wolverine Watchmen, and the company ultimately 
removed the group in late June." Facebook "confirmed that it worked with the FBI, and said in a 
statement that it removes content and accounts immediately when they are reported to law 
enforcement authorities if there is a `credible threat of imminent harm to people or public 
safety.' We proactively reached out and cooperated with the FBI early in this ongoing 
investigation,' a company spokesperson added."

Trump: Whitmer "Complaining," Doing "Her Political Act." Trump said in an 
interview on Fox News' Hannity (10/8, 535K), "I see Whitmer today, she's complaining, but it 
was our Justice Department that arrested the people that she was complaining about. It was 
my Justice Department that arrested them. But instead she goes and does her political act." 
The Wall Street Journal (10/8, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) says in an editorial that 
federal agencies quickly moved against the plotters, and that Whitmer owes a debt of gratitude 
to the Justice Department and the FBI. 
FBI Warned Over The Summer About Reenergized Militia Movement Yahoo! 
News (10/8, Winter, 12.82M) reports, "Almost four months before the FBI arrested six men for 
plotting to kidnap Michigan's governor, the bureau warned local and state law enforcement 
about a surge in militia extremists seeking to target government officials, particularly those 
they blamed for pandemic restrictions, according to an intelligence bulletin obtained by Yahoo 
News. `Militia extremists likely pose an increased threat to state and local law enforcement, 
government personnel and associated facilities due to a perceived resurgence in recent months 
of activity surrounding state-level gun control legislation, as well as concerns specific to state 
and local government responses to the COVID-19 pandemic,' the FBI said in an intelligence 
bulletin dated June 18 and produced jointly with the National Counterterrorism Center." 
In an opinion piece for the New York Times (10/8, 18.61M) , former acting Assistant 
Attorney General for National Security Mary B. McCord writes, "In the swirls of disinformation 
that now pollute our political discourse, one is particularly dangerous: that private militias are 
constitutionally protected. Although these vigilante groups often cite the Second Amendment's 
`well regulated militia' for their authority, history and Supreme Court precedent make clear that 
the phrase was not intended to - and does not - authorize private militias outside of 
government control. Indeed, these armed groups have no authority to call themselves forth into 
militia service; the Second Amendment does not protect such activity; and all 50 states prohibit 
it." 
More Commentary. In an opinion piece for the Washington Post (10/8, 14.2M) , Greg 
Sargent writes, "There are two immediate points here: First, this should be another case in 
which Trump realizes that he needs to be a lot more careful with his language of incitement, 
though of course he will not for a second treat this as a teachable moment. Second, this may 
bode very badly for this fall, since it heralds the possibility of more right-wing violence should 
Trump lose the election, declare it rigged and mobilize his supporters against it in some way. 
Both these points come to me by way of Elizabeth Neumann, the former senior official at the
