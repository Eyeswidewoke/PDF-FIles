New York Post (09/19, Narizhnaya, Geiger, et al.) reported that a 16-year-old boy was caught with a loaded gun at 
Benjamin Cardozo High School in Queens, New York, after posting threatening messages on Instagram about 
shooting up the school due to his issues with tests. According to the article, the boy was charged with criminal 
possession of a weapon and making a terroristic threat, and was arraigned with a requested bail of $100,000. The 
article noted that the gun, a 9-millimeter Taurus GX4, was purchased legally in South Carolina in January 2025, and 
an investigation is ongoing to determine how it ended up in the boy's possession. "Essentially, he made a post on 
Instagram...threatening to shoot up the school because tests got him 'tight.' Meta, whose parent company 
Instagram, took the threat seriously enough to where they informed the FBI, and they provided the FBI with the 
phone number associated with the account;' said Assistant District Attorney Mirza Hadzic. "The FBI forwarded that 
information to the NYPD because they also deemed it credible...They responded to the school." 
Additionally, District Attorney Melinda Katz said in a statement, "As alleged, a 16-year-old student brought a loaded 
gun into his high school and threatened to do harm. Thanks to the quick action of our law enforcement partners at 
the NYPD and the FBI, a tragedy was averted. Gun violence has stolen too many young lives in our communities, 
and we are extremely grateful that this incident did not result in anyone being hurt or worse." New York City Mayor 
Eric Adams added, "This year, we removed 4,000 illegal guns off our streets, and one of those guns was removed 
yesterday with a 16-year-old child that was in possession. Stopping the flow of guns is something that we need our 
federal partners to help us with, but what the police department is doing every day — zeroing in on illegal guns —
the guns that we remove are saving lives. Additional reporting was provided by HSToday (09/20, Norris), Parent

death in separate incidents. "The defendants convicted today engaged in excessive and brutal violence as members

Man Accused of Trying to Kill Trump Says Prosecutors Haven't Proven Assassination Attempt 
The Associated Press (09/19, Fischer) reported that Ryan Routh, accused of trying to assassinate President Donald 
Trump, claims prosecutors haven't proven an assassination attempt occurred. Prosecutors argued that Routh took 
substantial steps to kill Trump, including aiming a loaded gun at him, and that his actions were not peaceful. The 
judge denied Routh's motion for acquittal, and the case will proceed with the defense presenting its case, followed 
by closing arguments and jury deliberation. The article highlighted that FBI Supervisory Special Agent Kimberly 
McGreevy used cellphone records, location data, text messages, bank records, internet searches, security video 
and various store receipts to illustrate Routh's actions and movements over the month prior to the attempted 
attack and to show that he began trying to acquire a gun, despite being a convicted felon, nearly six months before 
his arrest. News Nation (09/19, Shafer, Noone) detailed that two witnesses who testified on Thursday said that 
Routh had information about Trump's plane. Gregory Turner — a member of the FBI Honolulu office — while 
executing a search warrant, collected a document from Routh's home that had Trump's plane tail number, flight 
plans, and talked about West Palm Beach. USA TODAY (09/19, Cann, Whigham II) added that Jerry Llanes, a digital
