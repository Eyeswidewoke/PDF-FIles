Border Patrol Agent Who Shot Chicago Woman Boasted About It in Text Messages 
Reuters (11/07, Hickman) reported that U.S. Customs and Border Protection Agent Charles Exum shot Chicago 
resident Marimar Martinez five times during an encounter on October 4, later boasting about his marksmanship in 
text messages with fellow agents. Exum, who claimed self-defense after the vehicles collided, told other agents in a

he took pride in his shooting skills as a firearms instructor. According to the article, after the shooting, the FBI

alliance of MAGA-aligned influencers, conservative media figures, and administration officials has reshaped the
