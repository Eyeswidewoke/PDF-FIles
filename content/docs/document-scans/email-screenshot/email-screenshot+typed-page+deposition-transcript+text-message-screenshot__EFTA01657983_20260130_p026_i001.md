and can be conducted in-house by medical unit employees." The Hill (8/3, Chalfant, 2.98M) also 
reports. 
WPost Report: State Officials Say Administration Unprepared To Distribute COVID 
Vaccine. 
The Washington Post (8/3, Sun, 14.2M) reports that "with the Trump administration aiming to 
deliver 300 million doses of vaccine against the coronavirus as early as January, state officials 
and health experts say they remain in the dark about key details and, therefore, are 
inadequately prepared for what is expected to be the largest single vaccination campaign ever 
undertaken." The Post adds, "Getting shots into the arms of millions of Americans is a massive 
undertaking, they say, requiring extraordinary coordination, planning and communication. But 
with only six months to the government's target date for approving a vaccine, the 
administration has shared limited and often confusing information about its plans for 
distribution." Politico (8/3, Roubein, Owermohle, 4.29M) says the Administration does not have 
"a plan on how to reach racial and ethnic groups that have not only been devastated by the 
virus but are often skeptical about government outreach in their communities." 
Fauci Says "Rush" On Vaccine "Does Not Compromise Safety At All." NIAID 
Director Fauci said on KDFW-7VVI Dallas (8/3, 95K), "This is a rush that does not compromise 
safety at all, nor scientific integrity. This is a vaccine, and the reason we have done it so quickly 
is because of the technical and scientific advances that have allowed us to go from the point of 
identifying this new virus to being able to put it quickly into Phase 1 trials, which is this first 
thing that you do for safety. Then you go to the next phase, which is Phase 2, and what started 
last week on July 27 was what we call a Phase 3 trial, which will involve 30,000 individuals, to 
determine, in fact, if it works as well as to do additional observation of safety." Fauci was also 
interviewed on KABC-TVVI Los Angeles (8/3, 51K), KSNV-TVVI Las Vegas (8/3, 10K), KTLA-TV 
Vi Los Angeles (8/3, 57K), and WGN-TVVi Chicago (8/3, 147K). 
Collins Urges Adherence To Public-Health Recommendations During Vaccine 
Wait. NIH Director Collins said on KOCO-TVVi Oklahoma City (8/3, 36K), "The Phase 3 trials 
are geared to accept about 30,000 volunteers for each of the six or seven vaccines that are 
going to be tested, starting right now, and you want to have that number of people so that you 
will be able to say for sure whether it worked and whether it was safe. During this time though, 
and that is going to spread over the next five or six months, probably until the end of 2020, 
people should continue to practice all of those public-health measures that we have been 
hearing about but unfortunately are not all sticking to." Collins was also interviewed on KRIV-TV 
Vi Houston (8/3, 829K), KSAZ-TVVI Phoenix (8/3, 50K), WFAA-TVVI Dallas (8/3, 46K), WKRN-
TVVi Nashville, TN (8/3, 24K), and WXIA-TVVI Atlanta (8/3, 100K). 
Monoclonal Antibodies Could Be "Next Big Advance" In Treatment. Reuters (8/3, 
Beasley) reports, "As the world awaits a COVID-19 vaccine, the next big advance in battling the 
pandemic could come from...antibodies designed specifically to attack this new virus." 
Development of monoclonal antibodies "has been endorsed by leading scientists," with Fauci 
having "called them 'almost a sure bet' against COVID-19." 
Navarro Rejects Giroir And Others On Hydroxychloroquine. 
USA Today (8/3, Cummings, 10.31M) reports that on Monday, Director of Trade and 
Manufacturing Policy Navarro "brushed aside the opinion of the administration's top public 
health officials as he defended a drug touted as a potential coronavirus cure by President 
Donald Trump despite a lack of evidence that it is effective." On Sunday, Assistant HHS 
Secretary for Health Adm. Brett Giroir "told NBC News that it was time to 'move on' from the 
debate over hydroxychloroquine because controlled studies had not shown it to be effective in 
treating or preventing COVID-19." Navarro said Monday, "I take exception with Giroir's analysis.
