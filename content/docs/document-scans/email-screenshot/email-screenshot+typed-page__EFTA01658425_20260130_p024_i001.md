June and July, the number of new reported cases per day in the United States began to level 
off, then drop, though the infection rate remains one of the world's highest." Of the states 
"driving the decrease, all have at least some local mask mandates, and most have paused or 
reversed statewide reopening policies, again closing bars, gyms and theaters."

Florida Judge Blocks State Order For Schools To Reopen. 
On the CBS Evening NewsVi (8/24, story 13, 0:15, O'Donnell, 4.21M), Manuel Bojorquez 
reported briefly, "A Florida judge sided with the state's largest teachers union" on Monday, 
"halting the state order to reopen schools to in-person instruction." NBC Nightly NewsVi (8/24, 
story 6, 1:30, Holt, 6.03M) called the ruling "a major victory for teachers in Florida, who sued 
over the statewide order to reopen schools for in-person teaching." NBC's Kerry Sanders added, 
"Florida Judge Charles Dodson's injunction...says in part, there's not room in many classrooms 
for social distancing. There is not room to put desks four feet apart, much less six feet apart, as 
is recommended. Teachers have not been provided adequate personal protection equipment. 
The state order to open is unconstitutional to the extent that it arbitrarily disregards safety."
