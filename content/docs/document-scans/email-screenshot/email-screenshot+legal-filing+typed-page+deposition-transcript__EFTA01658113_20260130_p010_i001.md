"bans on chokeholds and warrior-style trainings, a duty for officers to intervene in misconduct, 
and changes to provide more data and independent oversight on police matters." 
Cuomo: Trump's "Concerns About New York City Were Well-Founded." 
The Washington Times (7/23, Chasmar, 492K) reports New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) 
"acknowledged Wednesday that President Trump's concerns about skyrocketing violence in New 
York City were 'well-founded,' though he rejected the president's proposal to send federal law 
enforcement officers into the city." Cuomo told MSNBC's Andrea Mitchell he told Trump during a 
call Tuesday, "I said to the President that I understand the issues in New York City. And there 
are issues in New York City, as there are in many cities across the country. And if there was a 
need, the state would step in, which is the normal protocol, governmental protocol. And I was 
ready, willing and able to step in. But I think the federal involvement — there's no justification 
for it, and it would be counter-productive." 
NYPD Chief Tells Officers: "We Can't Be Afraid." The New York Post (7/23, Moore, 
Golding, 4.57M) reports NYPD Chief Terence Monahan "exploded in anger during a CompStat 
meeting Thursday," telling police brass: "We can't be afraid of doing what we do!" in video 
obtained by The Post shows. Monahan "erupted when a deputy told him that cops were worried 
about a controversial new city law that in part makes it a crime to kneel on a suspect's chest or 
back while making an arrest." Monahan is quoted as saying, "We can't be afraid." 
NY16 Candidate Bowman: "The Police Literally Beat The Crap Out Of Me." CQ 
Roll Call (7/23, McGrady, 154K) reports that when Jamaal Bowman, the Democratic nominee in 
NY16, "says he wants to end police brutality and overhaul law enforcement procedures in 
America, it's not just an abstract policy position." Bowman "has a long history with police 
officers treating him roughly," which he says began when he was just 11 years old. Bowman 
recalls, "The police literally beat the crap out of me just because I was playing with my friends, 
loud and boisterous, and didn't acquiesce to what they were asking us to do." 
As Cuts Begin, LAPD Chief Tells Troops To "Show Your Relevance." 
The Los Angeles Times (7/23, Chang, 4.64M) reports that "during a recent meeting with officers 
from the elite but troubled Metropolitan Division, Los Angeles Police Chief Michel Moore offered 
support for their crime-fighting mission, but also a warning he'd previously shared with 
command staff." With "significant reductions in the force looming, every unit is under a 
microscope - and must prove its worth." Moore told staff, "Show your relevance." In an 
interview with the Times, Moore said, "We need to look at how we police the city with the scant 
resources that we have, and determine how we can find alternatives if our current practices 
aren't going to continue to work." 
Charlamagne Tha God Criticizes Biden For Labeling Trump First Racist President. 
Fox News (7/23, Wulfsohn, 27.59M) reports on its website that radio host Charlamagne Tha 
God "blasted" Joe Biden on Thursday for calling President Trump the "first" racist president to 
be elected. Said Charlamgne, "Old white male leadership has failed America and there is 
nothing worse than an old white male [who) can't recognize the faults and flaws of other old 
white males. Racism is the American way. Donald Trump is not the first. And sadly, he won't be 
the last, right? He's just more overt with his racism than most presidents in recent times." 
PolitiFact Silent After Planned Parenthood Repudiates Founder's Racism. 
The Washington Free Beacon (7/23, Piro, 78K) reports, "PolitiFact is not saying whether its 
'fact-check' claiming Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger was not racist still holds up 
in light of the organization's largest affiliate admitting Sanger had racist views." The fact-check, 
published on Oct. 5, 2015, stated, "While Sanger indeed supported the eugenics movement, 
substantial evidence shows that she was not racist and in fact worked closely with black leaders
