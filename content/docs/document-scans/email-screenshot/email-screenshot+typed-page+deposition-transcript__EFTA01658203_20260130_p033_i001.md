enduring legacy of the American Revolution with a new left-wing cultural revolution." The 
Washington Post (7/21, Demirjian, 14.2M), among other news outlets, also reports the story. 
Trump Directs That Undocumented Not Be Counted In Congressional 
Reapportionment. 
The AP (7/21, Colvin, Freking) reports that on Tuesday, President Trump "signed a 
memorandum...to bar people in the US illegally from being counted in congressional 
reapportionment," which "drew immediate criticism from Democratic officials." The memo stated 
that "respect for the law and protection of the integrity of the democratic process warrant the 
exclusion of illegal aliens from the apportionment base, to the extent feasible and to the 
maximum extent of the President's discretion under the law." Reuters (7/21, Alper, Brown) 
points out Trump's memorandum "would prevent migrants who are in the United States illegally 
from being counted when U.S. congressional voting districts are redrawn in the next round of 
redistricting." Reuters adds that "experts...say the action is legally dubious." 
The Washington Times (7/21, Boyer, 492K) quotes the President as saying in the 
memorandum, "My administration will not support giving congressional representation to aliens 
who enter or remain in the country unlawfully, because doing so would create perverse 
incentives and undermine our system of government. ... This is all part of a broader left-wing 
effort to erode the rights of American citizens, and I will not stand for it." 
The Washington Post (7/21, Bahrampour, 14.2M) reports that it would be a change from 
"the way apportionment has been implemented for over two centuries." The Post also says that 
Democrats "blasted it, and civil rights organizations...said they will sue over it." The Wall Street 
Journal (7/21, Restuccia, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) also focuses on critics of the memo 
promising to sue and alleging that it is unconstitutional. 
USA Today (7/21, Jackson, 10.31M) reports "the memo does not say how the US Census 
Bureau can distinguish citizens from non-citizens for the purposes of apportionment since 
counters are prohibited from asking a citizenship question." Likewise, the Daily Caller (7/21, 
Datoc, 716K) also says that "questions remained as to how exactly Trump is recommending 
Congress exclude illegal immigrants from the new district maps." 
Politico (7/21, Kumar, 4.29M) reports that "for Trump, the move builds on a series of 
actions he has taken against immigrants, even those who are in the country legally, as he 
ramps up his reelection campaign." Yesterday's "move is the latest signal that Trump will make 
immigration a central theme of his campaign, just like in 2016, when Trump promised to build a 
wall on the southern border and deport millions of migrants who arrived in the country illegally." 
The New York Times (7/21, Rogers, Baker, 18.61M) indicates that "critics said the 
administration's efforts first to include a citizenship question and now to disregard 
undocumented immigrants from apportionment would lead to undercounts of even legal 
noncitizens and minority residents, resulting in less representation and federal funding in areas 
where they live, which tend to vote Democratic." The Los Angeles Times (7/21, Wire, 4.64M) 
points out that "if successfully carried out," Trump's directive "could have far-reaching effects by 
reducing the political clout of states with significant numbers of immigrants, including California 
and Texas. It could also shift power toward whiter, more rural areas of states at the expense of 
more diverse cities." The New York Post (7/21, Bowden, 4.57M), Axios (7/21, Allassan, 521K), 
Bloomberg (7/21, Korte, 4.73M), The Hill (7/21, Samuels, Bernal, 2.98M) and Breitbart (7/21, 
Binder, 673K), among other news outlets, also cover the story. 
White House Considering Executive Orders To Lower Drug Prices. 
The Hill (7/21, Sullivan, 2.98M) reports the White House is considering issuing executive orders 
to lower drug prices "that could come as soon as this week, prompting pushback from some 
GOP lawmakers and the powerful pharmaceutical industry." The Hill adds that "one idea under 
discussion, sources say, is to link some US drug prices to the lower prices paid overseas, an
