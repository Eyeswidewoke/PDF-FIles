Good news and not so good news. 
On Thursday I saw the neurologist, Dr. Smallberg, who saw my neck and =houlder xrays. Very good news is that he now 
says I can skip the second =ervical spine surgery. (Remember I actually went to the hospital to do =t in April but it was 
aborted at the last minute.) He said thatl'm =etting stronger and if it stays this way, I'm ok. As to my sore right =houlder, 
he doesn't think it's related to the cervical spine, but he =idn't look at the MRI saying he doesn't have the expertise and 
that I =ad to deal with the shoulder doctor. 
Btw, I had dropped off a set of these xrays to the the surgeon - O'Leary =ut received no response. I am told that no news 
from his office is good =ews. 
On Friday, I got a call from Karen Schneider, the orthopedist, who I had =een two weeks ago about about my painful 
right shoulder. She had taken =he x-rays of my neck and both shoulders. During the visit she said she =idn't think surgery 
for the shoulder was in the cards, said it looked =ike arthritis, not a ruptured rotator cuff. She sent me for MRI's of =oth 
shoulders which I did this past week. Btw, she's the younger dr. in =art Nissenson's office. He's one of the top athletic 
knee doctors. 
On Friday and gave me the following rundown: There is muscle atrophy =this whole thing started last November and I 
haven't been able to work =ut with weights since); there is moderate to severe arthritis, but it's =ot bone on bone; there 
are moderate tears to the rotator cuff but it's =ot completely ruptured. 
Then she told me 
(a) I could get a shoulder replacement (which I've never heard of). I =old her no way and no thanks; 
(b) arthroscopic shoulder surgery, which is a real operation under =eneral anesthesia, with same recovery time as 
regular surgery. She =ould go it and clean up the joint, remove spurs from the rotator cuff, =tc. But she couldn't promise 
it result in relieving the pain. I said =o. 
(c) I can come in and get a cortisone shot, which is what Smallberg, and =lso the physical therapist recommended. I said 
yes, and go in tomorrow =orning at 10am. If you think there's any reason not to get the shot, =et me know. I'm on my 
cell 917-744-8920. 
Interesting that Nick Prtizker had the same surgery as me and also has a =ainful shoulder which he can't get rid of. I think 
my best bet is to =ind a more appropriate sports therapy place. Right now I go one on one =ith a woman that does a 
little manipulation and gives me exercises for =ome. Another place I used to go to is more like a gym with weights =here 
you actually work out for an hour including a few minutes withthe =herapist.
