CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS 
Federal Judge Recommends Case Against Milwaukee Judge Who Allegedly Helped Undocumented Man 
Evade Arrest Continue 
The Associated Press (07/07, Bauer) reported that a federal magistrate judge recommended Monday that the case 
proceed against a Wisconsin judge who was indicted on allegations that she helped a man who is in the country 
illegally evade U.S. immigration agents seeking to arrest him in her courthouse. Milwaukee County Circuit Judge 
Hannah Dugan was arrested in April and indicted on federal charges in May. She pleaded not guilty. According to 
the article, Dugan filed a motion in May to dismiss the charges against her, saying she was acting in her official 
capacity as a judge and therefore is immune to prosecution. She argued that the federal government violated 
Wisconsin's sovereignty by disrupting a state courtroom and prosecuting a state judge. U.S. Magistrate Judge Nancy 
Joseph on Monday recommended against dropping the charges. The ultimate decision is up to U.S. District Judge 
Lynn Adelman, who can accept the other judge's recommendation or reject it. ABC News (07/07, Hill) also reported 
on the story. 
Travis Decker Search: Father Accused of Murdering Three Daughters Possibly Spotted in Idaho by Campers 
The Associated Press (07/07, Staff Writer) reported that federal authorities in Idaho are following up on a possible 
sighting over the weekend of a Washington state man wanted in connection with the deaths of his three daughters. 
According to the article, the U.S. Marshals Service Greater Idaho Fugitive Task Force said it had received a tip 
Saturday from a family recreating near a camping area in Idaho's Sawtooth National Forest that they saw a man 
whose description was consistent with that of Travis Decker. Decker has been wanted since June 2, when a sheriff's 
deputy in Washington found his truck and the bodies of his three daughters. Authorities in Washington on June 
10 said they believed they'd spotted Decker, a former soldier, near a remote alpine lake in a popular backpacking 
area in the Cascade Range. Tracking teams followed up on a tip from hikers who reported seeing a lone hiker who 
appeared to be ill-prepared for the conditions. The article added that Eric Toms, supervisory deputy U.S. Marshal 
with the District of Boise, said the agency was receiving more tips from the public following the statement the task 
force released Sunday. Toms in an email said the agency was evaluating each tip and that a search team involving 
the marshals service, the U.S. Forest Service and the Camas County Sheriff's Office set out Monday. He said 
authorities planned to speak with local residents and people camping or recreating in the area. He said Decker has 
a history of hitchhiking and encouraged motorists to not pick up any hitchhikers. Toms said search efforts Monday 
were being conducted by air and on the ground, including by dirt bike. People (07/07, Longmire), New York Post 
(07/07, Pollina), Spokesman Review (07/07, Cabeza), ABC News (07/07, Forrester), and NBC News (07/07, Stelloh) 
also reported on the story. 
Cleveland FBI Seeks Tips on International Fugitive Accused of Smuggling Guns in Used Cars 
WOIO (CBS-19) (07/07, Staff Writer) reported that federal investigators are renewing their push for tips from the 
public to help track down a former North Olmsted man who is accused of smuggling guns overseas by hiding them 
in used vehicles. According to FBI Cleveland, George Nakhle Ajaltouni is a native of Lebanon and became a United 
States Citizen in 2009. Nearly a decade later, records show he was charged with naturalization fraud and a federal 
warrant was issued for his arrest after investigators found he lied on his citizenship and passport 
applications. Ajaltouni, who is now 50 years old, is also facing more serious charges in a separate federal case. The 
article noted that between 2011 to 2014, records show he used cash to buy large quantities of pistols and rifles at 
gun shows and from private sellers. According to the FBI, Ajaltouni would then buy used cars and hide the weapons 
in the doors and body panels. The vehicles were later shipped to Lebanon with the smuggled guns concealed 
inside, records show. The FBI believes he is now living in Lebanon and may travel to Cyprus and 
France. Investigators say Ajaltouni is an associate of Nakhle Nader, who is also wanted by the FBI. 
FBI, Indiana State Police Go Door to Door to Try to Solve Fatal 2016 Flora Fire 
The Lafayette Journal & Courier (07/07, Wilkins) reported that the FBI and Indiana State Police are renewing efforts 
to investigate the 2016 Flora house fire that killed four girls. Authorities are asking residents to share any 
information they may have, even if seemingly insignificant. According to the article, the fire, initially undetermined, 
was later ruled arson, and a $5,000 reward is offered for information leading to an arrest and conviction. Despite 
local skepticism about the case ever being solved, officials maintain it remains an active investigation. FBI agents 
and Indiana State Police detectives will go door to door in and around Flora to try to find new information or jar 
people's memories of something that might be the break in the case. Chris Bavender, FBI spokeswoman for the
