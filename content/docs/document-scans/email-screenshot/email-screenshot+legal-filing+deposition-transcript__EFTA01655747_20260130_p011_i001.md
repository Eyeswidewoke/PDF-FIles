Sexual Assaults Hit New High in 2023 For Cruise Passengers Says FBI 
Fox News (01/27, Eberhart) reported that the number of reported rapes and sexual assaults on cruises hit a new 
high in 2023, according to stats compiled by the FBI. There were 131 reported incidents in 2023 compared to 87 in 
2022 and 101 in 2019 before the coronavirus pandemic crippled the industry for about two years. The article added 
that the actual number of incidents is likely much higher, experts warn. Nationally, two out of three sexual 
assaults go unreported, according to the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network, and the 2010 Cruise Vessel 
Security and Safety Act doesn't protect non-U.S. citizens. According to the article, the Cruise Vessel Security and 
Safety Act doesn't require cruises to report crimes against non-U.S. citizens, and there's a narrow definition of rape 
that cruise line management companies use to "significantly" underreport incidents to the FBI. The article 
mentioned that the FBI said in an emailed statement that the bureau works closely with the Department of 
Transportation to remain in accordance with the Cruise Vessel Security and Safety Act. The article quoted the FBI, 
which said, "The CVSSA prescribes security and safety requirements for most cruise ships that embark and 
disembark in the U.S., and mandates reporting to the FBI of missing persons and certain alleged criminal activity 
occurring on board applicable cruise vessels,". 
Russian Man Who Flew on Los Angeles Flight Without Passport or Ticket Found Guilty of Being Stowaway 
The Associated Press (01/26, Craig) reported that a Russian man who flew on a plane from Denmark to Los Angeles 
in November without a passport or ticket is guilty of being a stowaway on an aircraft, a federal jury found Friday. 
The article added that Sergey Vladimirovich Ochigava arrived at Los Angeles International Airport on Nov. 4 via 
Scandinavian Airlines flight 931 from Copenhagen. A U.S. Customs and Border Protection officer could not find 
Ochigava on the flight's manifest or any other incoming international flights, according to a complaint filed Nov. 6 in 
Los Angeles federal court. The article mentioned that after a three-day trial, the court's jury found Ochigava, 46, 
guilty of one count of being a stowaway on an aircraft. He faces a maximum sentence of five years in federal prison 
when he is sentenced Feb. 5, the DOJ said in a statement. KNBC (NBC-4) (01/27, Soto) reported that the FBI and 
CBP along with assistance from Copenhagen Airport Police investigated the case. The New York Post (01/27, 
McEntyre), and the Los Angeles Times (01/27, Leon) also reported on the story. 
Cross Burning In South Carolina Stirs Debate Over Hate-Crimes Laws 
The Washington Post (01/26, Craig) reported that Monica and Shawn Williams, both Black veterans of the U.S. 
Army, thought they had bought a retirement home in a neighborhood that lived up to South Carolina's slogan: 
"Smiling Faces, Beautiful Places." But within hours of moving into their three-bedroom house near Myrtle Beach in 
2021, the Williamses said their next-door neighbors, a White couple, started scowling at them. The uncomfortable 
stares eventually led to racial slurs and a bitter two-year dispute. Then, on the day after Thanksgiving, they 
discovered a cross set on fire just outside their yard. The article stated that the FBI is investigating what happened 
to the Williamses. In December, after news of the cross burning became public, the FBI visited the house where 
Butler and Hartnett live. An FBI spokesman said the investigation is ongoing. 
Man Who Ran Dogfighting Ring With More Than 50 Dogs Training at His Property Sentenced 
ABC News (01/26, Haworth) reported that an Ohio man has been sentenced to more than a decade in prison after 
it was discovered he was running a dogfighting ring from his residence where he kept more than 50 dogs, according 
to authorities. The article noted that law enforcement first investigated 40-year-old Michael Valentine of Bidwell, 
Ohio, in 2019 after a dog attacked a small child who was living with him, according to a press release from the DOJ 
detailing the case against Valentine. The article added that three years later on March 8, 2022, a second search was 
carried out at Valentine's property -- this time as part of a fentanyl distribution investigation -- and the search 
revealed Valentine had kept more dog fighting paraphernalia, as well as two assault-style rifles, the DOJ said. The 
article quoted Acting Special Agent in Charge Robert J. Springer of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Office of 
Inspector General (USDA-OIG), who said, "The relevant provisions of the Animal Welfare Act were designed to 
protect animals from being used in illegal fighting ventures, which often entail other forms of criminal activity 
including drug trafficking and illegal possession of firearms, the USDA-OIG thanks the Justice Department, who 
prosecuted the case, and Gallia County Sheriff's Office and the FBI for their assistance with the investigation."
