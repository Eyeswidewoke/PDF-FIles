The New York Times (10/22, Zaveri, 18.61M) reports Manafort attorney Todd Blanche said 
in a statement, "As we have said from the time the district attorney announced charges against 
Mr. Manafort, this is a case that should never have been brought because the dismissed 
indictment is a clear violation of New York law." The New York Daily News (10/22, Crane-
Newman, 2.52M) reports Manafort "was sentenced to 7 1/2 years in prison in March 2019 for 
hiding millions of dollars in offshore accounts and then lying to get loans after income dried up 
from his work for pro-Russian Ukrainian politicians." Politico (10/22, Gerstein, 4.29M) also 
reports. 
Goldman To Pay Nearly $3B, Take Millions From Executives To Settle 1MDB Probe. 
The Wall Street Journal (10/22, Hoffman, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) reports Goldman 
Sachs admitted Thursday that it broke US corruption laws and agreed to pay nearly $3 billion to 
officials in four countries to settle an investigation into its dealings with the Malaysian 
investment fund 1MDB. In what the journal casts as a move to assuage shareholders Goldman 
said four executives: chief Executive David Solomon, President John Waldron, Chief Financial 
Officer Stephen Scherr and the head of Goldman's international business, Richard Gnodde will 
give up $31 million in pay this year. In addition, the bank will take back millions in past pay 
from Solomon's predecessor, Lloyd Blankfein and other former executives. The Washington Post 
(10/22, Bogage, 14.2M) says, "Prosecutors in the Eastern District of New York charged the 
bank with conspiracy to violate the anti-bribery provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act." 
The settlement "includes the largest monetary penalty ever assessed under corporate criminal 
bribery law." 
The AP (10/22, Balsamo, Sweet) reports, "Goldman Sachs Malaysia entered the plea in 
federal court in Brooklyn." The New York Times (10/22, Goldstein, Flitter, 18.61M) says 
Goldman "admitted its Malaysian subsidiary 'knowingly and willingly' conspired to violate the 
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act because some former employees paid bribes to officials in 
connection with the looting of a sovereign wealth fund, a scandal that toppled that country's 
leader and triggered criminal cases that spanned the globe." 
On its website, CNN (10/22, Disis, Isidore, Simko-Bednarski, Business, 83.16M) reports 
Goldman "has already settled the case with Malaysian authorities, agreeing this summer to a 
$3.9 billion deal. As part of that settlement, Malaysia agreed to drop all criminal and regulatory 
proceedings in the country that involved Goldman, including proceedings against the bank's 
subsidiaries and certain current and former directors." CNN adds the settlements "include 
partial credits for payments made to other countries, leaving Goldman with a total bill for the 
scandal of $5.1 billion, according to a company filing. It could still face civil penalties." 
Bloomberg (10/22, Natarajan, 4.73M) says Goldman, which was "pilloried after the 2008 
financial crisis, just saw a decade of image repair tarnished." Bloomberg adds, "The misconduct 
described in the settlements is landing at a moment when polls suggest Democrats might take 
control of both chambers of Congress and the White House," which "may make it a smart time 
for a company to settle with an administration whose players and priorities it knows." 
FTC Nearing Decision On A Facebook Antitrust Case. 
Citing "two people with knowledge" of the FTC's talks, the New York Times (10/22, Kang, 
18.61M) reports the agency "is moving closer to a decision about filing an antitrust lawsuit 
against Facebook for its market power in social networking." The FTC's five members met 
Thursday "to discuss its investigation into Facebook and whether the company had bought 
smaller rivals to maintain a monopoly, the people said." Those people said the FTC "has 
prepared three documents about Facebook - one on its potential antitrust violations, another 
analyzing the company's economics, and a third assessing the risks of litigation - which have 
been circulated among F.T.C. leaders, the people said." They said a decision about a case has 
not been made.
