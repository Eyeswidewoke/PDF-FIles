FULL REPORT 
4Q16 operating results =argely in-line 
GM reported 4Q16 operating EPS of =1.28, well above our $1.01 estimate and the Bloomberg consensus of =1.17. The 
majority of the bottom line beat was the result of a very low =ax rate of just 13.5% (BofAMLe 31.8% =amp; YTD -28%), 
but on an operating basis all regions in the auto =usiness were just ahead of our estimates. Specifically, GMNA EBIT of 
=2.6bn (BofAMLe $2.56bn) and a good 8.4% =BIT margin (BofAMLe 9.0%) were driven by =olume on new models, 
slightly offset by increased product costs and =ix. Europe was also slightly better, printing EBIT of $(246)mm versus =ur 
$(355)mm estimate, largely driven by a continued focus on cost. =nternational ops EBIT of $316mm (BofAMLe =187mm) 
was above our estimate due to a similar focus on cost, while =MSA EBIT loss of $(65)mm (BofAMLe =$152mm) benefited 
from price actions (Table 1). GM Financial EBIT of =193mm was just below our $218mm forecast. We continue to expect 
GM's =uto results to be led by North America in the next few quarters, driven =y solid volumes, product launches, and 
the company's go-to-market =trategy, while macro volatility in Europe (i.e. Brexit), continued weakness in South 
America, =nd the tail risk of an eventual slowdown in China remain risks that, so mar, are being well managed and 
mitigated by management execution. =/span> 
2017 outlook reiterated; =PS of $6.00-$6.50 
Consistent with its commentary at =vents over the past few months, GM expects total company earnings to =mprove 
YoY in 2017. Specifically, GM expects to record 2017 EPS of =6.00-$6.50, which, at the midpoint, is a $0.13/sh increase 
from the 2016 level, or about 2% =oY. The midpoint of GM's range is also above our estimate of $6.00 and =he 
Bloomberg consensus of $6.06. Other aspects of GM's 2017 outlook =nclude: (i) higher YoY total revenue, (ii) greater 
than or equal to YoY =djusted EBIT and EBIT margin, (iii) adjusted auto free cash flow of =$6bn, and (iv) cash returned to 
shareholders (via dividends, share =epurchases, etc. ) to be greater than the 2016 level. GM did not =rovide an explicit 
outlook by region, but we expect more color on the =onference call this morning. 
Balance sheet stalwart; =apital allocation encouraging 
GM generated $1.7bn of auto free cash =low in 4Q16, which was solid, driven by strong earnings and working =apital. At 
the end of 4Q GM had gross cash and marketable securities =f $21.6bn and total liquidity of $35.6bn, while net cash 
stood at a =olid $10.8bn. We would note that the underfunded status of GM's US =ension improved to $7.2bn at the end 
of 2016 ($10.4bn at year-end 2015) =elped by discretionary contributions and apparently good asset returns. =or full 
year 2016, GM repurchased $2.5bn of common shares ($1bn in 4Q), =hich was solid. At the Detroit Auto Show earlier 
this month, GM =nnounced a new $5bn share repurchase program, bringing the total =utstanding authorization to $8bn, 
or almost 15% of the company's =urrent market cap. In aggregate, we believe management remains =isciplined in its 
overall capital allocation strategy, and will likely =ontinue to enhance shareholder value via dividends, buybacks, and 
=&A. However, we believe a more prudent course of actions may be to =uild a bigger cash cushion, so as to further
