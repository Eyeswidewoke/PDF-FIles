separated from their families under the Trump crackdown have yet to be located. 'This 
administration ripped babies from their mothers' arms, and then it seems, those parents were 
in many cases deported without their children and have not been found. It's an outrage, a 
moral failing, and a stain on our national character,' Mr. Biden said in a statement." The Times 
goes on to say that Trump "and his allies have often made the misleading claim that the 
separations began on President Barack Obama's watch and that Mr. Biden, who was then the 
vice president, was complicit." According to the Times, "While the Obama administration did 
order the detention of migrants during a surge at the border in 2014, splitting up families was 
rare." 
WPost: "Children Were Kidnapped" By US Government. The Washington Post 
(10/21, 14.2M) editorializes that "the Trump Administration's immorality, cruelty and 
bureaucratic malpractice in tearing migrant toddlers, tweens and teens away from their parents 
in 2017 and 2018" has left a "perhaps even more shocking...present-day legacy," with over 500 
children still separated from their families. The Post says, "For all intents and purposes, these 
children were kidnapped by the U.S. government," a policy "justified in the name of inflicting 
such emotional trauma on migrant families that further illegal crossing of the southern border 
would be deterred." 
Stanford Study Shows No Crime Increase In Sanctuary Cities. 
The Washington Post (10/21, Miroff, 14.2M) reports that according to a new Stanford University 
report comparing data from over 200 jurisdictions between 2010 and 2015, "cities that have 
adopted 'sanctuary' policies did not record an increase in crime as a result of their decision to 
limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities," rebutting "the Trump Administration's 
rhetoric about the policies' dire effects on public safety." The statistics "show that the policies 
were effective at limiting deportations of nonviolent offenders but did not result in higher crime 
rates in those cities," with "violent criminals...deported at the same pace." Researcher David 
Hausman said, "The government itself keeps the data I rely on, and if the Administration had 
looked at its own data, it would know these claims are not true." 
Heritage Foundation Report Says Biden Would Resume Obama Immigration Policies. 
Fox News (10/21, Shaw, 27.59M) reports on its website that according to an unreleased report 
by the Heritage Foundation, "Joe Biden, if elected president, would undo a number of key 
Trump Administration's policies related to immigration." The report predicts Biden "would return 
to many of the same immigration policies in place during the Obama Administration," including 
"protecting and expanding the DACA program, admitting at least 125,000 refugees annually 
and seeking amnesty" for 11 million migrants. Heritage also forecasts Biden would rescind 
"Trump's travel restrictions on countries deemed to be national security threats," as well as the 
Migrant Protection Protocols. 
Giuliani Appears In "Compromising Position In A Hotel Room" In New "Borat" Movie. 
The AP (10/21) reports, "Rudy Giuliani is shown in a compromising position in a hotel room 
with a young woman acting as a television journalist in a scene in Sacha Baron Cohen's latest 
mockumentary, a sequel to his hit 'Borat' film." The scene "includes a moment when Giuliani is 
seen lying on a bed, tucking in his shirt with his hand down his pants and the young woman 
nearby." USA Today (10/21, Truitt, 10.31M) reports, "Giuliani told Page Six in July that he went 
to The Mark Hotel in New York for what he thought was a real interview about the Trump 
administration's response to the coronavirus crisis." The New York Times (10/21, Thrush, 
Vigdor, 18.61M) reports Giuliani told a New York radio station Wednesday that he "had been 
tucking in his shirt after removing microphone wires." 
The Washington Post (10/21, Rao, 14.2M) headlines its report "Rudy Giuliani's 
Compromising Scene In The 'Borat' Sequel Is Another Hit For Trump's Personal Attorney." The
