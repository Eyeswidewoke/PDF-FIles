Risk Warning 
Investments are subject to investment risk, including market fluctuations, regulatory change, possible delays in repayment and loss of income 
and principal invested. The value of investments can fall as well as rise and you might not get back the amount originally invested at any point in 
time. 
Investments in Foreign Countries - Such investments may be in countries that prove to be politically or economically unstable. Furthermore, in 
the case of investments in foreign securities or other assets, any fluctuations in currency exchange rates will affect the value of the investments 
and any restrictions imposed to prevent capital flight may make it difficult or impossible to exchange or repatriate foreign currency. 
Foreign Exchange/Currency - Such transactions involve multiple risks, including currency risk and settlement risk. Economic or financial 
instability, lack of timely or reliable financial information or unfavorable political or legal developments may substantially and permanently alter 
the conditions, terms, marketability or price of a foreign currency. Profits and losses in transactions in foreign exchange will also be affected by 
fluctuations in currency where there is a need to convert the product's denominationfs) to another currency. Time zone differences may cause 
several hours to elapse between a payment being made in one currency and an offsetting payment in another currency. Relevant movements in 
currencies during the settlement period may seriously erode potential profits or significantly increase any losses. 
The values of the fixed Income instruments will fluctuate and may lose value, as bond values decline as interest rates rise. Certain bonds and 
fixed income instruments may be callable. If called, the investor will experience a shorter maturity than anticipated. Bonds referenced herein 
are exposed to credit risk, or the risk that the bond will be downgraded, and inflation risk, or the risk that the rate of the bond's yield will not 
provide a positive return over the rate of inflation. 
Bonds are subject to interest rate risk. When interest rates rise, bond prices fall; generally the longer a bond's maturity, the more sensitive it is 
to this risk. Bonds may also be subject to call risk, which is the risk that the issuer will redeem the debt at its option, fully or partially, before 
the scheduled maturity date. The market value of debt instruments may fluctuate, and proceeds from sales prior to maturity may be more or 
less than the amount originally invested or the maturity value due to changes in market conditions or changes in the credit quality of the issuer. 
Bonds are subject to the credit risk of the issuer. This is the risk that the issuer might be unable to make interest and/or principal payments on a 
timely basis. Bonds are also subject to reinvestment risk, which is the risk that principal and/or interest payments from a given investment may 
be reinvested at a lower interest rate
