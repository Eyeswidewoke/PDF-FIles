Bodies of Two Israeli-American Hostages Recovered From Gaza in Joint Military Operation 
The Associated Press (06/05, Lidman, Melzer, Shurafa) and Reuters (06/05, Al-Mughrabi, Cornwell) reported 
that Israel has recovered the bodies of two Israeli-American hostages, Judih Weinstein and Gad Haggai, from the 
Gaza Strip. The two hostages, who also held US citizenship, were taken by Hamas militants during the October 7, 
2023, attack and were later killed. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed the recovery of the bodies 
and extended condolences to the families of the victims. CNN (06/05, Yosef, Lilleholm, Liebermann) noted that a 
statement from the family thanked the U.S. administration, the Israeli government, and the FBI for their "tireless 
work and ongoing support." Additional reporting on the story was provided by Fox News (06/05, Betz, Rotem-

FBI Receives Dozens Of Tips About Doctors, Hospitals Surgically Transitioning Minors 
The Daily Wire (06/05, Olohan) reported that the FBI has received over 100 tips regarding surgical transgender 
procedures on minors after asking Americans to report evidence of medical professionals performing such 
procedures. According to the article, the move is part of the Trump administration's efforts to scrutinize the 
transgender medicine industry and protect children from irreversible gender transition procedures. The FBI's call 
for tips comes after President Donald Trump signed an executive order protecting children from these procedures, 
which he described as "destructive and life-altering". The article added that Erica Knight, an advisor to Director 
Patel, told The Daily Wire that the bureau will "never stop fighting for our most vulnerable — our children. As a 
mother, I'm deeply grateful and proud to know the future of America's kids is one rooted in safety, strength, and 
opportunity." The FBI posted the following on X on Monday: "Help the FBI protect children. As the Attorney 
General has made clear, we will protect our children and hold accountable those who mutilate them under the 
guise of gender-affirming care." The post encouraged Americans to "report tips of any hospitals, clinics, or 
practitioners performing these surgical procedures on children." 
As Ousters Continue, FBI Singles Out Employee Over Friendship With Trump Critic 
The New York Times (06/05, Goldman) reported that the FBI has forced out two veteran agents, Spencer Evans and 
Stanley Meador, and punished another, Michael Feinberg, due to their perceived disloyalty to President Trump. The 
article noted that Michael Feinberg was targeted for his friendship with Peter Strzok, a critic of President Trump, 
and was threatened with an investigation and demotion. "I was informed that, because I maintain a friendship with 
a former FBI executive who is a critic and perceived enemy of the current administration, I would not be receiving 
any of the promotions for which I was currently being considered, and that I should actually steel myself to be 
demoted," he said. Feinberg added that the FBI had intended to have him take a polygraph, or a lie-detector test, 
about the nature of his ties to Strzok, which he said are entirely social. The article stated that the moves are seen as 
part of a larger effort by FBI leadership to remake the agency and mollify Trump's supporters, with critics accusing 
them of politicizing the FBI and retaliating against employees who disagree with them.
