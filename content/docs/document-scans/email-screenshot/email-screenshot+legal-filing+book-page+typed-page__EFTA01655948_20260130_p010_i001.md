California Man Sentenced To 78 Months In Prison For Distribution Of Child Pornography 
WHP (CBS-21) (05/21, Embry) reported that a California man has been sentenced to over six years in prison 
following a "campaign of retaliation" involving a bomb threat and the distribution of child pornography in 
2023. Nathan DeLeon, 20, of Tulare, California was sentenced to 78 months in prison on multiple charges including 
risking catastrophe, terroristic threats, stalking and harassment following organized attacks against a minor in 
Cumberland County. According to the article, the Dal states that DeLeon had been in an online relationship with 
the 16-year-old victim via the gaming platform, Roblox. Once the relationship ended, officials say that DeLeon 
"swatted" the victim's Cumberland County home address multiple times between June and November of 
2023. DeLeon pleaded guilty on Dec. 18, 2024, to making a bomb threat hoax and the distribution of child 
pornography due to him sending a "sexually explicit" video of the 16-year-old to someone on two separate 
occasions. A DOJ press release noted that the case was investigated by the FBI and the Pennsylvania State Police.

gbhackers (05/21, Kathir) reported that Matthew D. Lane, a 19-year-old Massachusetts college student, has agreed 
to plead guilty to federal charges related to a cyberattack on PowerSchool. According to the article, the attack 
resulted in the theft of confidential data from millions of students and teachers, with Lane threatening to publish 
the records unless he received a ransom payment in Bitcoin. Lane faces charges including cyber extortion, 
unauthorized access to protected computers, and aggravated identity theft, which carry significant prison time and 
financial penalties. The article highlighted that the FBI, which led the investigation, reiterated its commitment to 
pursuing cyber offenders, regardless of age or motivation, signaling the government's resolve in confronting digital 
threats against critical infrastructure and private data. The Associated Press (05/21, Staff Writer) quoted Kimberly 
Milka, Acting Special Agent in Charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Boston Division: "Matthew Lane 
apparently thought he found a way to get rich quick, but this 19-year-old now stands accused of hiding behind his 
keyboard to gain unauthorized access to an education software provider to obtain sensitive data which was used in 
an attempt to extort millions of dollars." 
UK Exposes Russian Cyber Campaign Targeting Support For Ukraine 
The BBC (05/21, Rahman-Jones, Valiance) reported that the UK has exposed a Russian cyber campaign targeting 
organisations involved in delivering foreign assistance to Ukraine, including those supplying defence and logistics 
support. According to the article, the campaign, attributed to the Russian military unit GRU Unit 26165 (also known 
as Fancy Bear), has been ongoing since 2022 and has targeted organisations in multiple countries. The article 
explained that the hackers used various techniques, including password guessing and spearphishing, to gain access 
to networks, including internet-connected cameras monitoring aid shipments into Ukraine. The article published a 
photo of the FBI's takedown of the Fancy Bear website in 2018. 
Why Telecoms May Never Purge Their Networks of Salt Typhoon 
CyberScoop (05/21, Johnson) reported that the Chinese hacking group Salt Typhoon has penetrated multiple U.S. 
telecommunications networks, and experts believe it may never be fully purged due to the complexity and size of 
modern telecom networks. According to the article, the group's ability to hide and reenter networks is facilitated by 
the industry's history of consolidation, which has left many telecoms with a patchwork of different equipment, 
technologies, and architectures, making it difficult to manage identity solutions and detect malicious activity. The 
article noted that experts warn that the lack of granular indicators of compromise and the difficulty in managing 
identity solutions make it challenging to track and remove Salt Typhoon from telecom networks.
