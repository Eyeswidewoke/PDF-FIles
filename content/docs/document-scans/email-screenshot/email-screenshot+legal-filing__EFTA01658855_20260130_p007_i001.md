Co-Conspirator In Minnesota Terrorism Case Testifies He Botched Abortion Clinic 
Bombing On Purpose. 
The Minneapolis Star Tribune (11/30, Mannix, 1.04M) reports, "A key witness in the case 
against Michael Hari, the man on trial for bombing a Minnesota mosque, told jurors Monday he 
intentionally sabotaged a homemade explosive in November 2017 to foil Hari's plot to bomb an 
abortion clinic in Champaign, Ill." Joe Morris, "who says he was a member of Hari's militia, 
White Rabbits, told the court he purposely left a piece of masking tape on the homemade 
thermite bomb at the last moment before lighting and tossing it into Women's Health Practice. 
'I didn't feel right in doing what I was about to do,' Morris said in St. Paul's federal courthouse 
on Monday. 'So I left it on.' A staff member for the clinic found the device intact on the floor of 
a surgery room the next morning." 
AP Chronicles Long Road To Prosecution Of ISIS "Beatles." 
The AP (11/30, Tucker) reports the Justice Department's "most significant terrorism prosecution 
in years" got underway in Virginia last month as Alexanda Kotey and El Shafee Elsheikh stood 
"accused of belonging to an IS cell dubbed 'the Beatles,' an incongruously lighthearted 
nickname for British citizens blamed for the jailing, torture and murder of Western hostages in 
Syria." While the prosecution "is a counterterrorism success in the waning weeks of the Trump 
administration," it "almost didn't happen." The AP cites "interviews with 11 people connected to 
the case," which "make clear the hurdles along the way."

The Hill (11/30, Coleman, 2.98M) reports that Christopher Maier, the "Defeat-ISIS Task Force 
director resigned from his position at the Pentagon on Monday amid the continued post-election 
purge" at DOD. He "led the task force focused on examining policy and strategy creation for 
combating ISIS since it was formed in March 2017." Maier's position "'will be absorbed' by the 
Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low Intensity Conflict 
and staff from the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy," DOD said. A statement 
read, "These changes recognize the success of the military fight to destroy the so-called 
physical caliphate of ISIS and reflect DoD's commitment to institutionalize efforts to counter 
ISIS and integrate efforts with allies and partners within our counterterrorism and regional 
policy offices." Offices "led by Ezra Cohen-Watnick and Anthony Tata, who are considered Trump 
allies who were recently promoted," will take over Maier's responsibilities.
