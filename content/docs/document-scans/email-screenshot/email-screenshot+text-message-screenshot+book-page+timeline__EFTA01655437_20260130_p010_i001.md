she gave Vl a countdown to flee the country, warning he would be "eliminated on the spot" if seen near his law

Chen's social media. The article noted that V1 told the FBI he had never met or communicated with Chen, despite 
her alleged harassment beginning in October 2024. 
FBI Warns of Cybercriminals Using Fake FBI Crime Reporting Portals 
Bleeping Computer (09/19, Gatlan) reported that the FBI issued a warning about cybercriminals creating spoofed 
versions of its Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) website to steal personal and financial information from 
unsuspecting visitors. The FBI explained that attackers often make small alterations to legitimate domains, such as 
using alternate spellings or top-level domains, to trick people into entering sensitive data like names, addresses, 
and banking information. According to the article, the FBI cited examples of spoofed domains and emphasized that 
IC3 or FBI employees will never contact victims directly to recover stolen funds or request payment. The bureau 
also recommended typing the address directly into web browsers rather than using search engines or sponsored 
links, which scammers frequently exploit to redirect victims to fraudulent sites. The article noted that the FBI 
previously issued similar alerts after receiving over 100 reports of such scams and reminded the public to avoid 
sharing personal information or sending money to unknown individuals online.

OTHER FBI NEWS 
Former U.S. Attorney Defends Epstein's 2008 Plea Deal in Hours-Long Appearance on Capitol Hill 
CNN (09/21, Grayer) reported that former U.S. Attorney Alex Acosta defended his 2008 plea deal with Jeffrey 
Epstein during a six-hour closed-door session with the House Oversight Committee, arguing the decision was based 
on concerns about losing at trial and whether the case should be handled federally or locally. Democrats on the 
panel criticized Acosta as "not credible," noting he refused to call the arrangement a "sweetheart deal" despite 
testimony that about 40 women had come forward with abuse allegations. According to the article, Acosta insisted 
he never met Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell and denied ever seeing President Donald Trump's name in any related 
documents, while committee chairman Rep. James Comer said Acosta was cooperative and provided information 
to advance the probe. The article explained that Director Patel also referenced Acosta in recent testimony as the 
Trump administration faces pressure to release all Epstein files, with the committee subpoenaing figures from both 
parties and reviewing documents from Epstein's estate and the Justice Department. The article noted that the 
House panel continues to investigate the federal government's handling of Epstein's case, including financial 
records and survivor testimony, as lawmakers push for full transparency. 
Could Russia 'Burn Bags' and a 'Mess' in New Jersey Derail Tracci's Bid for U.S. Attorney? 
Daily Progress (09/21, Spencer) reported that Republican Robert Tracci, serving as interim U.S. attorney for the 
Western District of Virginia, faces potential hurdles to permanent appointment amid legal questions over interim 
term limits and an FBI investigation into so-called "burn bags" tied to Russia-related documents. It explained that 
law professor Carl Tobias believes Tracci's low-profile approach and bipartisan support from Virginia's U.S. senators 
make it unlikely that these issues will derail his nomination. According to the article, FBI Director Kash Patel 
announced in July that thousands of documents linked to the Russia probe were nearly destroyed, prompting a 
federal investigation centered at the Charlottesville courthouse near the FBI's Winchester document facility. The 
article described competing theories for choosing Charlottesville, including proximity to the FBI site and 
speculation that a rural Virginia jury might be more favorable to indicting Obama-era officials than one in 
Washington, D.C. The article noted that prosecutors from Virginia's Eastern District are overseeing the case, while 
Tracci and the White House have declined to comment on his role or whether the probe could affect his 
nomination.
