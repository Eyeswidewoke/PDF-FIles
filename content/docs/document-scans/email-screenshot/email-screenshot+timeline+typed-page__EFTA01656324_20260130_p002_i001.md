Including John Brennan, James Comey, and others, with AG Bondi stating that the DOJ will "Investigate these troubling disclosures fully and leave 
no stone unturned to deliver justice". The article highlighted that Director Patel has opened an investigation into Brennan and Comey. The full 
scope of the criminal investigations into Brennan and Comey is unclear, but two sources described the FBI's view of the duo's interactions as a 
"conspiracy," which could open up a wide range of potential prosecutorial options. The Associated Press (07/24, Tau, Richer) reported that DNI 
Gabbard declassified documents claiming to prove an "anti•Trump conspiracy by the Obama administration, but the documents do not support 
her claims. The declassified emails and reports actually affirm the conclusion that Russia interfered in the 2016 election to sow chaos and 
influence public opinion, with the goal of helping Donald Trump and denigrating Hillary Clinton. The article noted that Gabbard's claim that the 
Steele dossier was used as the basis for the FBI's investigation into potential coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia is incorrect, 
as the justice Department's inspector general found that the dossier was not the basis for the investigation, and that the FBI primarily relied on a 
CIA human source close to the Kremlin for its conclusion that Putin wanted to help Trump and hurt Clinton. The article explained that although 
the Steele dossier was used in part to obtain surveillance warrants to eavesdrop on the communications of a former Trump campaign adviser, 
many of Steele's claims have since been discredited or denied, and the FBI's reliance on the dossier has been criticized, with then•CIA Director 
John Brennan objecting to its inclusion in the classified version of the intelligence community assessment The New York Times (07/24, Thrush, 
Barnes) reported that Gabbard's actions have put AG Bondi in a difficult position, as she must investigate the claims without committing to a 
potentially unpredictable and politically charged investigation. Additional reporting on the story was provided by Washington Times (07/24,

Trump Administration Sues New York City Over 'Sanctuary City' Policies 
The Wall Street Journal (07/24, Morphet) and the Washington Times (07/24, Dinan) reported that the DOJ has filed a lawsuit against New York 
City Mayor Eric Adams over the city's sanctuary policy, which limits cooperation with federal deportation authorities. According to the articles, 
the policy bars city officials from holding migrants for pickup or notifying ICE before release, resulting in a drop in cooperation between city law 
enforcement and ICE. The articles noted that the lawsuit claims that the policy has led to the release of thousands of criminals, including violent 
offenders, and seeks to shut down the city's sanctuary policies. The Washington Post (07/24, Jacobs) quoted a statement from AG Bondi 
announcing the lawsuit: "New York City has released thousands of criminals on the streets to commit violent crimes against law•abiding citizens 
due to sanctuary city policies; Additional reporting on the story was provided by Associated Press (07/24, Staff Writer), ABC News (07/24,

Woman Learns Fate After DOJ Guilty Plea Admitting She Helped North Korean Tech Workers Infiltrate U.S. Companies 
Fox News (07/24, D'Abrosca) reported that Christina Marie Chapman, a 50•year•old Arizona woman, has been sentenced to 102 months in prison 
for helping North Korean tech workers infiltrate U.S. companies. According to the article, Chapman's scheme, which generated over $17 million, 
involved stealing the identities of 68 Americans and helping North Korean residents pose as U.S. citizens to get remote IT Jobs at 309 American 
companies. She pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud, aggravated identity theft, and conspiracy to launder monetary instruments, 
and will also forfeit $284,556 and pay a judgment of $176,850. "The North Korean regime has generated millions of dollars for its nuclear 
weapons program by victimizing American citizens, businesses, and financial institutions," stated FBI Assistant Director of Counterintelligence 
Roman Rozhaysky. "However, even an adversary as sophisticated as the North Korean government can't succeed without the assistance of willing 
U.S. citizens like Christina Chapman, who was sentenced today for her role in an elaborate scheme to defraud more than 300 American companies 
by helping North Korean IT workers gain virtual employment and launder the money they earned. Todays sentencing demonstrates that the FBI 
will work tirelessly with our partners to defend the homeland and hold those accountable who aid our adversaries." The press release quoted FBI 
Phoenix Special Agent in Charge Janke: "The sentencing today demonstrates the great lengths to which the North Korean government will go in its 
efforts and resources to fund its illicit activities. The FBI continues to pursue these threat actors to disrupt their network and hold those 
accountable wherever they may be." Bloomberg (07/24, Ratliff) also reported on the story. 
New Haven Attorney Gives Up Law License After Passing Synthetic Cannabis To Clients In Rhode Island Prison 
The Stamford Advocate (07/24, Ikramuddin) reported that a New Haven attorney who federal officials say provided synthetic cannabis to clients 
in a Rhode Island detention center, then lied to corrections officers, has agreed to surrender his license to practice law in order to avoid 
prosecution. Acting U.S. Attorney for the District of Rhode Island Sara Miron Bloom said in a news release on Thursday that Jonathan Einhorn was 
charged with willfully and knowingly making a materially false, fictitious, and fraudulent statement and representation. Einhorn has entered into 
a Deferred Prosecution Agreement which includes an understanding that he will not seek to renew his law license for 10 years. Bloom said 
Einhorn visited with several clients who were detained at the Wyatt Detention Center on May 21st, 2023, and, as he entered the facility, he signed 
a document that certified he was aware that he was not allowed to bring contraband into the facility or to pass any contraband to a detainee. 
When asked if he would be passing anything to a detainee by a correctional officer, Einhorn responded, "No, not today." The Wyatt's Professional 
Standards Unit saw Einhorn pass paperwork to at least two detainees, and officials who seized the documents found that eight pages were 
discolored and "highly stained!' Bloom stated, 'The paperwork was sent to an FBI Laboratory for testing and was shown to be contaminated with 
synthetic cannabinoids."
