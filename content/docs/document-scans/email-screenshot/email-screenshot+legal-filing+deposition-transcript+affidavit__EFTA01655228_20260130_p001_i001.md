at least and not mentioned to us, and then we found stuff in there and a lot of it's from the Comeyera, and we are working our damndest right 
now to declassify," he said. "And Just so you know, because I get the public, I totally understand people saying, 'Well, do it now.' The process Is that 
not all information Is ours to declassify; some is from other Intelligence agencies, Its not- we literally can't do It. Once that gets done and that gets 
out there, and you read some of the stuff, we found that, by the way, was not processed through the normal procedure, digitizing it, putting it In 
FBI records. We found it in bags hiding under Jim Comey's FBI, and you're going to be stunned!" The New York Post (05/29, Crane, King) reported
