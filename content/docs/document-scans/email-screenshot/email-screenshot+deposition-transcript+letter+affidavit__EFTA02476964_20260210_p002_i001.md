,you were surprised when I said that i require most=20 people to pay their advisory fee up front so that I am assured 
=hat I will be properly compensated for my work when strategies are implemented . you may recall that you appeared 
offended a=d said " are you suggesting that i would go back on my word " I said no = of course not ! you are my 
closest of friends ,but my experience is that=C2 when amounts get large, people tend to get unhappy when it actually 
comes time for them to pay. 
I include b=low the email i sent to you on April 15, the day i was examining your returns =AO It laid out my 
understanding of the compensation agreed for a transaction of the magnitud= to the penny of the one just completed.ie 
chttp://completed.ie> 600m 
When it appeared that the transc=tion would and could go foward I was the first to 
point out that our agreement would cost you too much mone=, therefore 
more details 
Fro= day one I proposed to discount our agreement to a 50 - 60 mil=ion range. An extremely fair price for all the 
tr=nsactions just completed . including Phaidon. =AO - I was never told that this was out of =20 range. in fact, 
alternative methods of payment . ie my p=ane, or an -in-kind payment were discussed ( ie =20 including keeping the 
30m portion of the fee outstanding till M=rch ) ,I provided , only because you specifically requested a detailed =C2 
step by step execution plan and reviewed all documents that i was given access to.=( Phaidon was never forthcoming ) 
=AO in order to make my many corrections . ( as i said more needed on=phaidon ) . I was then told that Alansaspan> 
involvement warranted a discount . Even in the best of l=ght , though it is beyond question that not one time in the 
three ye=rs of his retainer has he ever proposed a unique idea. (includin= any way to deal with the use issue on debras 
death ,or even the most basic review of your =argest asset by far , the BRH agreement. ) O.K. - lets say he made a 
contribution to the pla= and stretch reality beyond the pale and say it was 50 %. though no =ne could posit such a large 
amount unless they were wearing a clow= suit. , the payment and our formula of 37 percent associated with=C2 the 
deal was known . It had both sent in writing and spoken about on the phone numerous times, a detailed execution 
plan was provided . then an= only then, after the entire transaction was laid out for the group to follow =A0 You told 
me that after a number of conversations with brad karp that a total of only 20m would be paid , (and even that was 
more tha= you originally contemplated ) for both transactions . Leon I feel =AO It was remarkably unfair. Did brad even 
knew of our prior agreements.? ?, I would ask that you I and Brad karp sit together if you think it would be helpful. . I 
would like to sen= him this email, with your consent of course. If the transactio=s were never consummated , i would 
not be owed a dime, however , the expect=d fee was known up front. , the detailed step by step plan was f=llowed and 
overseen by me, the amount that I had requested befo=e the transaction had even begun, had already been heavily 
discounted= out of friendship, . I believe the decision re only paying 20 m has frankly, left me felling quite une=sy. 
and colors the view about the Athene or Rothschild transaction. 
email from apr=I 15
