patches and other mitigation strategies already exist that address all of them." The NSA is now 
"identifying Chinese state-sponsored groups as actively leveraging these weaknesses to target 
information networks belonging to the defense industrial base," DOD, and "other national 
security systems." 
Also reporting are ExecutiveGov (10/21), Gov Info Security (10/21), and Computer 
Weekly (10/21). 
US-China Tensions Expected To Escalate Over Chip Manufacturing. 
Bloomberg (10/21, Crawford, Wu, Murphy, 4.73M) reports that "chips for everything from 
artificial intelligence and data centers to autonomous cars and smartphones [have] become an 
issue of national security." Tensions over the chips are "injecting government into business 
decisions over where to manufacture chips and to whom to sell them," and could "kick into 
overdrive as Communist Party leaders set a five-year plan that includes developing China's 
domestic technology industry, notably its chip capabilities." Semiconductors are "arguably one 
of the world's most important industries, with sales of $412 billion last year; scale that up to 
the electronics industry that depends on chips, and it's worth some $5.2 trillion globally, 
according to German manufacturers." An executive at a Chinese semiconductor maker "said 
three of its deals had been aborted because of concerns raised" by CFIUS. 
US, Foreign Officials Discuss Cybersecurity, Threat Of China At Atlantic Future Forum. 
Reuters (10/21, Hepher) reports that National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien "accused China 
on Wednesday of trying to steal COVID-19 vaccine research from the West, casting it as a 
malign rival that was seeking to monopolise every important industry of the 21st Century." At 
the Atlantic Future Forum, the US official "told top British and U.S. military and intelligence 
officials that China was a predatory power that repressed its people and had sought to coerce 
both neighbours and Western powers." O'Brien said, "Most recently the PRC used cyber-enabled 
espionage to target companies developing Covid vaccines and treatments in Europe, the UK and 
the United States all the while touting the need for international cooperation." He added that 
since the end of the Cold War, Chinese leaders have "doubled down on their totalitarian 
approach and mercantilist, state-dominated economy." 
Reuters (10/21, Faulconbridge, Stubbs) reports separately that GCHQ Director Jeremy 
Fleming "said on Wednesday it was seeking to engage more with business to harness top cyber 
talent behind programmes to accelerate world-class technology." He told the Atlantic Future 
Forum, "We have a whole range of accelerator programmes...and we're looking to do much 
more of that." Fleming added, "We are trying to create ecosystems that bring in academia." 
GCHQ has a "close relationship" with the NSA "as well as with the eavesdropping agencies of 
Australia, Canada and New Zealand in a consortium called 'Five Eyes." Fleming is concerned the 
"security and defence services were able to organise themselves quickly enough to defend 
against the full range of modern security threats." 
German Cybersecurity Consultant Outed For Moscow Ties Met Top Trump Officials. 
The Daily Beast (10/21, 1.39M) reports, "On Nov. 11, 2019, Hans-Wilhelm Dunn," a German 
who has been "accused by counterintelligence officials in Germany of being part of a Russian 
influence operation," visited DHS in Washington, DC. While there, he "met with a host of U.S. 
cybersecurity officials" from DHS and "public utility companies as well as corporate executives 
from Amazon and Microsoft - all of whom were seemingly unaware of his controversial status 
back home." Though the meetings "might have otherwise counted as any other ho-hum 
calendar event," Dunn had six months prior "been publicly exposed in the German media as 
having numerous links to Russian intelligence and influence operations, including one financed 
by the U.S.-sanctioned oligarch Yevgeny Prigozhin."
