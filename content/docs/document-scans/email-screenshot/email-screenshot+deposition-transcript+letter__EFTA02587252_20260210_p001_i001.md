"Hello Jeffrey, 
How are you ? 
I hope everything is going Well on the Island. 
I'm sorry to send you this so late, but i was working and i just arrived at t=e apartment. 
I was really surprised today when i received the message from your assistant= I am so thankfull to you for everything 
you are doing for me since the begin=ng. 
I said thank you 3 Times, first when i Wrote a message to your assistant, i d=dnt have your number so i couldn't call you. 
That was the best way to conta=t you, ( i thought she will gave me your number but no ...) i also sent a m=ssage directly 
to svetlana when i arrived in the apartment, and finally i t=lk to you in the phone two days ago and explained you the 
situation ... And=you listened to me and said ok i understand. I apologized also in the phone= And you said that its all 
right. 
I'm just not use to all this kind of thing. Everything went so fast. 
Maybe you wanted something else from me, like a present or something else. l=would like to do this, but i can do this 
kind of thing when i have Time, yo= should really see my schedule every day , i mean i doesn't have Time to do=anything 
else that my castings, fittings, and jobs. 
I always Write to your assistant or Svetlana when i have Time beetween my a=pointments as soon as i can . 
I'm not complaining and not trying to find excuses, i'am just explaining yo= . 
But for you i didn't do it the right way, i'am sorry for that. 
Usually i really show this kind of thing at the end, i mean i didn't Know yo= Well, i never Know what can happen you 
Know, i was a bit scared at the beg=ining, you also have to realise that. 
I am a really polite person, i always say thank you to everything so i don't=really understand what is going on. 
The thing is that i'm so respectful to you, i don't want to disturb or borro= you, you are already doing a lot of things to 
me, that's why i'm a bit on a=defensive way. 
It's really unusual for me to be in this type of situation, everybody don't h=ve this chance, it's like having an angel with 
me, but you Know that's not h=ppening all the Time. 
Secondly, i talked to Daniel and he explained me what you don't like. 
But i realise that we are here in a lots of misunderstandings, that's why th= situation is like this now, and make me feel 
really sad and incomfortable= First he said that you wanted me to Come wth you to Boston, i didn't came be=ause i had 
to stay in Town for castings during the Week end on saturday and=sunday my agency told me. And i Wrote a message to 
your secretary to tell h=r. Did she translate you the message ? 
After he said that you organized me a meeting with a certain Faith ? I have n=ver heard about her . Nobody told me that, 
we just spoke about the Next ag=ncy you and me in the phone and i told you that maybe it's better to wait=the end of 
fashion week, you said yes .. 
You didn't explained me who she really was. 
Because you Know that im in an agency now, if they Know that i went to an o=her one i Will have lots of problem 
because in this fashion world everybody=Know everything. 
( but Daniel told me that i can meet this person, that i will not have probl=ms , if he said that , i Will, so i have to think 
about this ) He also talk to me about Patrick and Victor demarchelier. But nothing e=se, no appointments, nothing. 
The only thing i Know about next , was when i talked yesterday to your assis=ant, she said if you want you can met Laura 
from next and again i said that=for the moment i'm not sure if it's a good idea ...I thank you again for th= apartment , it's 
a dream apartment, i really like it.
