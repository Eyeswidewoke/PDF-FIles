'Boogaloo Bois' and a sub-group called the 'Boojahideen,' in May. The group is known to have 
violent anti-government sentiments, with the term 'Boogaloo' referencing an impending second 
civil war in the U.S. The complaint states, during the civil unrest in the Twin Cities following 
George Floyd's death, Solomon was seen openly carrying a firearm in a residential 
neighborhood. The two men interacted with a witness over several days and the witness told 
FBI agents they had firearms and substantial quantities of ammunition. The witness also said 
the two men and other members of their groups discussed committing acts of violence against 
police officers and other targets to help further their mission of overthrowing the government 
and replacing its police forces."

Intel Agencies Struggle To Prevent Terror Attacks In Age Of Online Radicalization. 
CNN (11/8, 83.16M) reports on the challenges posed by radical Islamist terrorism in Europe. 
Security officials in Austria "warned their Austrian counterparts that the attacker had tried to 
buy ammunition in the neighboring country the July before, but, the Austrian interior minister 
said, a communication failure meant Austria clearly failed to act." MI5 chief Ken McCallum 
"warned last month that the adherents to ISIS ideology number in the tens of thousands, and 
they must find the few 'who at any given moment might be mobilizing towards attacks." 
Though the "anti-French rhetoric fueled by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and former 
Malaysia PM Mahathir Mohamad can only further addle the febrile emotions of an imbalanced 
youth," the "internet, a wired interpretation of religion, boredom and mental health are a far 
more potent mix in a man who months earlier was legally a child." 
The New York Times (11/6, Onishi, Meheut, Foroudi, 18.61M) reports, "The three young 
men behind recent terrorist attacks that have shaken France present a difficult challenge to the 
French authorities." They were "isolated, self-radicalized individuals, rather than Islamist 
extremist networks." The attacks are "raising tough questions about whether the broad 
measures the government has taken in response are the right ones." Center for the Analysis of 
Terrorism Chairman Jean-Charles Brisard said extremist networks are "natural and logical 
intermediaries in the process that leads to violence," and France must widen its "intelligence-
gathering capacity by involving the local police and officials, he added."

political cartoon displayed in his classroom must not be tolerated." Rutte said, "The fact that at 
this moment teachers are being threatened because they paid attention in their lessons to the 
discussion around cartoons is absurd and we must not tolerate it."
