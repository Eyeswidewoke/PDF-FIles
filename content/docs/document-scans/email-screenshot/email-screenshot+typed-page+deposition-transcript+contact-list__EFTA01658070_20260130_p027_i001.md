President Trump's advisers and those working to defeat him agree that the "best way for him to 
regain his political footing is to wrest control of the coronavirus." The Post says Trump's "allies 
and opponents agree he has failed at the one task that could help him achieve all of his goals -
confronting the pandemic with a clear strategy and consistent leadership." The Post cites 
"people close to Trump," many of whom spoke anonymously, who "say the president's inability 
to wholly address the crisis is due to his almost pathological unwillingness to admit error; a 
positive feedback loop of overly rosy assessments and data from advisers and Fox News; and a 
penchant for magical thinking that prevented him from fully engaging with the pandemic." 
O'Brien Tests Positive For Coronavirus, Is "Self-Isolating." 
The AP (7/27, Miller, Colvin) reports that National Security Adviser O'Brien "has tested positive 
for the coronavirus - making him the highest-ranking official to test positive so far." The White 
House "confirmed that O'Brien has mild symptoms and 'has been self-isolating and working 
from a secure location off site." The AP adds, "Officials did not respond to questions about the 
last time the president and O'Brien had contact." The Washington Post (7/27, Wagner, 14.2M) 
reports that on Monday, President Trump "said...that he had not seen O'Brien recently. ... 'I 
haven't seen him lately,' Trump said as he left the White House for a trip to North Carolina." 
All three major network newscasts covered the story last night. ABC World News Tonight 
Vi (7/27, story 3, 2:25, Muir, 7.11M) reported "the coronavirus is now reaching deeper into the 
President's inner circle," while Ben Tracy of the CBS Evening NewsVi (7/27, story 3, 1:20, 
O'Donnell, 4.46M) said "the President did not explain why he has not recently seen his own 
National Security Adviser," and NBC Nightly NewsVi (7/27, story 4, 1:45, Holt, 6.32M) that "it's 
unclear how much contact...Trump and O'Brien have had in recent weeks," though "their last 
public appearance together was 17 days ago in Florida." 
CNBC (7/27, Breuninger, 3.62M) reports on its website that the White House released a 
statement reading, "There is no risk of exposure to the President or the Vice President. The 
work of the National Security Council continues uninterrupted." Politico (7/27, Lippman, 4.29M) 
reports that NEC Director Kudlow "told reporters on Monday morning that O'Brien got infected 
from his daughter." Politico goes on to report that O'Brien, along with his deputy, Matt Pottinger, 
were "early internal advocates of swift action to combat the outbreak," and "more recently, he 
has focused on coordinating the administration's pushback against a rising China." 
Bloomberg (7/27, Jacobs, Mohsin, 4.73M), which first reported that O'Brien had tested 
positive, says, "Since his diagnosis, O'Brien has been isolating at home while still running the 
National Security Council, doing most of his work by phone." Bloomberg adds, "NSC staff 
weren't informed that O'Brien had tested positive," and "some found out through press reports." 
Likewise, Reuters (7/27, Holland) indicates that the announcement that O'Brien had tested 
positive "caught some White House staff off guard, as there had not been an internal memo 
about it." USA Today (7/27, Jackson, 10.31M), the Los Angeles Times (7/27, Bierman, 4.64M), 
The Hill (7/27, Samuels, 2.98M), and McClatchy (7/27, Wilner, 19K), among other news outlets, 
also reports the story. 
Commerce Department: Ross Hospitalization Was Not Related To Coronavirus. 
CNBC (7/27, Breuninger, 3.62M) reports on its website that the Commerce Department 
announced on Monday that Secretary Ross "has left the hospital where he had been admitted 
for health reasons unrelated to the coronavirus pandemic." The 82-year-old Ross "had been 
working from his home in Palm Beach, Florida, since at least late March." 
Birx Advocates Mask-Wearing, Bar Closures In Tennessee Visit. 
WKRN-TVVi Nashville, TN (7/27, 25K) that White House coronavirus task force coordinator 
Deborah Birx visited Nashville Monday "with a message for Tennesseans." Birx "said bars should 
be closed, indoor dining should be limited and everybody should be wearing a mask always."
