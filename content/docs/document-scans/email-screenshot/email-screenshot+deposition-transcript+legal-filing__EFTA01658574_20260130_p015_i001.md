jury trial in August, Musso, 56, was found guilty of four counts of receiving and possessing

Wash. 
The San Jose (CA) Mercury News (10/8, Gartrell, 456K) reports from San Francisco, "Last April, 
the Northern California U.S. Attorney's office announced it had charged two women with 
robbery charges that carry a maximum 20-year sentence because they allegedly yelled 'we 
have COVID' and coughed on a Walgreens manager who interrupted their shoplifting." The 
Mercury News adds, "Both the special agent in charge of the San Francisco division of the FBI 
and the Bay Area's top federal prosecutor took the rare move of issuing public statements on 
the case, the former calling it an intolerable act," but "in recent court records the attorney for 
one of the women has accused federal authorities of misleading the public, in part because the 
government's news release left out this detail: the women — one of whom was homeless —
were accused of shoplifting six bottles of body wash, with an value of $76.50."
