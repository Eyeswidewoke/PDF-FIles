Trump's Wall Street Journal Suit Over Epstein Story Faces Timing Hurdle 
Reuters (07/22, Cohen) reported that Donald Trump's lawsuit against the Wall Street Journal over a story about 
him and Jeffrey Epstein may face hurdles due to non-compliance with Florida state rules on the timing of 
defamation lawsuits. According to the article, Trump would need to clear a high bar to win the case, including 
proving "actual malice" by the Journal, which means showing the paper knew the article was false or acted with 
reckless disregard for its truth. The article noted that the lawsuit may be dismissed due to Trump's failure to 
provide the required five-day notice period before filing the suit, and experts warn that his willingness to sue could 
have a chilling effect on media coverage of his administration. The article highlighted that in 2019, Deputy Director 
Bongino sued online news outlet The Daily Beast for defamation over a story about his departure from the National 
Rifle Association's online video channel. The case was dismissed the next year. U.S. District Judge Jose Martinez in 
Miami sided with the Daily Beast in finding that Deputy Director Bongino did not comply with the provision, but 
said the basis of his decision was that Bongino's case lacked merit. 
The Cut (07/22, Gonzalez-Ramirez) and Snopes (07/22, Deng) also reported on the story. 
Manhattan Bomb Plot Foiled as Feds Charge NY Man With Building, Stashing IEDs Across City 
Fox News (07/22, Baehr) reported that Michael Gann, a 55-year-old New York man, has been charged with building 
and stashing homemade bombs across Manhattan. Authorities found at least 7 improvised explosive devices (IEDs) 
made by Gann, including some on subway tracks and residential rooftops. FBI Assistant Director Christopher Raia 
credited the "swift partnership" between agencies for stopping Gann before he could inflict harm. The press 
release provided the full quote from Raia: "Michael Gann allegedly produced multiple improvised explosive devices 
intended for use in Manhattan. Due to the successful partnership of law enforcement agencies in New York, Gann 
was swiftly brought to justice before he could harm innocent civilians shortly after his dangerous actions became 
known. The FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force is enduring in its commitment and determination to protect the 
homeland." 
U.S. Files Forfeiture Action Against $2 Million in Digital Currency Involved in Hamas Fundraising 
Just the News (07/22, Severi) reported that the Dal has unsealed a civil forfeiture action against approximately $2 
million in cryptocurrency. The digital currency is linked to companies connected to BuyCash, which is accused of 
funding Hamas and other terrorist groups, including ISIS and Al-Qaida affiliates. The action aims to dismantle the 
financial infrastructure of terrorism by seizing cryptocurrency held in accounts connected to BuyCash, with owners 
like Ahmed Alaqad having been designated as supporters of Hamas by the U.S. Department of the Treasury. The 
press release quoted FBI Assistant Director in Charge Steven J. Jensen of the Washington Field Office: "This 
forfeiture action demonstrates that no matter what lengths terrorism financiers take to obscure their illegal 
transactions, the FBI will aggressively disrupt the transmission of illicit proceeds intended to support designated 
terrorist organizations like Hamas." 
Five Defendants Sentenced in Connection With Operating One of the Largest Illegal Television Show 
Streaming Services in the U.S. 
KLAS (CBS-8) (07/22, Haas) and KSNV (NBC-3) (07/22, Staff Writer) reported that five Las Vegas men have been 
sentenced in the "Jetflicks" streaming case, a large-scale internet piracy operation that made millions from stolen 
copyrighted TV programs. According to the articles, the sentences range from 7 years in federal prison for 
Kristopher Lee Dallmann to probation and community service for others, including Peter H. Huber, Jared Edward 
Jaurequi, Felipe Garcia, and Douglas M. Courson. The articles noted that the case is considered the largest internet 
piracy case to go to trial, with an estimated $37.5 million in copyright infringement, and is part of a broader effort 
to deter and disrupt intellectual property crime. The press release quoted Assistant Director Jose A. Perez of the FBI 
Criminal Investigative Division: "By building and running one of the largest unauthorized streaming services in the 
U.S., these individuals not only stole from content creators and legitimate streaming services, they undermined the 
integrity of our economy and the rule of law. These sentencings are a reminder that illegal actions have 
consequences. The FBI and our partners are unwavering in our commitment to protect intellectual property rights 
and hold criminals accountable."
