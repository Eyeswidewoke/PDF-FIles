I understand that margin requirements exist in connection with certain 
options and I agree to meet all margin calls as 
made by DBSI. I understand that DBSI, in computing the margin requirements 
for option positions, may impose a higher 
margin requirement for individual option positions than other investment 
firms, and that DBSI will inform me of its 
existing margin requirements for option positions upon request. In the event 
I do not meet margin calls promptly, DBSI 
is authorized, in its sole discretion and without notification to me, to 
take any and all steps necessary to protect itself in 
connection with put and/or call transactions made for my account, including 
the right to buy and/or sell short, or short 
exempt, for my account and risk any part or all of the shares represented by 
options endorsed by DBSI for my account, or 
to buy for my account and risk any puts and/or calls as DBSI may deem 
necessary for its protection.! further agree that 
any and all expenses incurred by DBSI in this connection will be reimbursed 
by me. 
This agreement shall apply to all option orders for my/our account, whether 
or not such orders are executed. 
I understand that options may be listed on one or more Exchanges and that if 
no Exchange is specified by me, DBSI will 
use its discretion in routing my order(s). 
I hereby authorize you in your sole discretion and with notification to me 
(or in the event of my death, without notification to 
representatives of my estate or to my heirs) whenever you deem it necessary 
for your protection, to take such action, including, 
without limitation, to buy, sell or sell short for my account(s) and my 
risk, puts, calls, or other forms of options and/or to buy, 
sell, or sell short any part or all of the underlying securities represented 
by options endorsed by you for my account(s). Any and 
all expenses, including, without limitation attorneys' fees and their 
reasonable disbursements, incurred by you in connection 
with such transactions will be reimbursed by me or by my estate. 
You are under no obligation to convey to me any information relating to the 
underlying securities covered by an option or 
any securities related thereto, or any information relating to options 
whether such information is then or thereafter known 
or available. Any information, advice or notification in respect to any 
option or any underlying securities or securities relating 
thereto which you may give me and which you are not required to give by the 
terms of this agreement or any other agreement, 
expressed or implied, shall not be construed as creating an implied 
agreement or course of dealing between us and shall not 
impair the provisions of this or any other agreement between us. 
This agreement and its enforcement shall be governed by the laws of the 
State of New York and its provisions shall be 
continuous; shall cover all options transactions hereunder, whether you are 
acting as broker or principal, and all accounts, 
individually and collectively, which I may open or re-open with you; shall
