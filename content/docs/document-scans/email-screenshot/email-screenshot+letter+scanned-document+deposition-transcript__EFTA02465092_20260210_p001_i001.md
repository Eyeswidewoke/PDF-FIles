Fwd: 
I was told that Toms office is sending someone in ,or so=e people in, to review something. brad told me ,the partnership 
acco=nting. I know nothing more than that. Having them review things with=ut even asking for my input, or let alone 
my direction ,is ridiculous. bu=.. I guess you wanted to save money ? The audit has brought to the =ore the lack of your 
office quality that i have been violently squaw=ing about. ie . children playing at at adult game. =It is inconceivable to 
me that John castrucci is still there , =C2 joslin part time but relied on. , joe mistake after mistake a=d brad a 
corporate bandleader talking about the office's finance=team, accounting dept, and directing wendy to do things that 
are cle=rly not in your interest. ( saving money again ?) =its nuts!! . a still non-existent IT dept. impossible, =t was 
the first thing on my list of things that were needed to be do=e. Still no trading accounts to speak of , though its 
p=ophylactic quality has been discussed over and over again the past three y=ars . As you said your motivation to keep 
this group was a co=sequence of my high fees. . the unfortunate=result was predictable. - now 
yo= can hire me and my team or not. if yes, I will oversee the audits= take charge of the TRA BRH assignments and 
review 2012 options!! Lots of =aper needs to be collected and reviewed, At MY direction, the outside team=will be 
brought in at my expense working for me, coming =n for two to three weeks -they will review . set up ,an=C2 up- to-
date accounting system,  computerized timelines for f=lings etc. . household classifcations and reportin= that makes 
sense. the goal is to end our financial interaction. you=will have a machine that works . to drive is not complex , to build 
=he car, another story, Unfortunatleyfor us both, the price for =AO my work has not changed since day one. 40m per 
year, =1 m willing to discount it to 35 as I did give you a bad number when=asked and should pay an embarassment 
fine. Im also awar=, as you made perfectly clear . that you have paid what you consider=a great deal of money, 
though, as you know, without a doubt , you h=ve far and away recieved way more than called for in our agree=ent . 
please also remember that you and i agreed no more dema=ds on my time after the last payment , I stepped in to 
help ,=as you had an unexpected home mess on your plate ( not because i was=responsible for joslin having a 
breakdown ). and have worked many ma=y hours doing things that were never my responsiblity ,coley b=cause of our 
unique friendship. by the way , on another note =ou recently seemed shy to discuss certain things. , please be assure= 
I make no judgement on any of your activities , whether or n=t i agree with them . not my role. my role is, protection 
fir=t. no matter what you do. I am on your side. 
=. you can decide that brad , tom , and whomever else you choose can =versee your audits . they are both aware and 
sensitive to the =ssue at hand. alan could be brought in but i would be extra c=reful having paul weiss given access to 
entire story. you can delay = decision to after your spa. but I wouldnt if i were you.
