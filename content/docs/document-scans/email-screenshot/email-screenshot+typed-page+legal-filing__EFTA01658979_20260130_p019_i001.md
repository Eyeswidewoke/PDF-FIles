infection with malware." The Journal-Constitution urges officials to "tell voters to verify their 
selections on a paper ballot before feeding it into an optical scanner." 
O'Brien Says Hackers Can't Change Votes. 
Politico (10/25, Hooper, 4.29M) reports National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien told CBS' Face 
The NationVi Sunday that Russian hackers who have carried out attacks on state and local 
governments "can't change votes" in the Nov. 3 elections. Asked if hackers can change votes or 
make it more difficult to vote, O'Brien said, "No, they can't do either of those things. And we 
got ahold of them early on because we've got great cyber folks, and we put a stop to it, but 
there's nothing they can do to change your vote or to stop you from voting." 
Fox News (10/25, O'Reilly, 27.59M) reports that O'Brien's comments "come just days after 
U.S. officials said that Russian hackers have targeted the networks of dozens of state and local 
governments in the United States in recent days, stealing data from at least two servers." The 
NSA official "tried to assure Americans that the hackers can't change voters or make it harder 
to cast a ballot." However, he said, "the actor may be seeking access to obtain future disruption 
options, to influence U.S. policies and actions, or to delegitimize (state and local) government 
entities." 
Voters Urged To Be Careful When Opening Election-Related Mail. 
The Detroit Free Press (10/25, 1.52M) urges voters to "be extra cautious when election-related 
emails swoosh into their inboxes." For instance, voters in some states recently "received 
threatening emails claiming to be from the far-right, authoritarian group Proud Boys," though 
those were "part of a disinformation campaign," according to DNI Ratcliffe. Last week, Ratcliffe 
"Iranian hackers were behind the attack." University of Michigan's director of the Center for 
Social Media Responsibility, Paul Resnick, said voters should stay alert. He said, "If you're 
thinking, `This might be a phishing attack'...You're already halfway to safety." The Free Press 
also advises voters to check the address and if they suspect something out of the ordinary, to 
"get an independent verification of the information." 
Editorial: Americans Must Brave Outside Attacks On Elections And Vote. 
The editorial board of the San Antonio Express-News (10/23, 762K) writes that a "cyberwar 
against the U.S." is being waged on the election. Threats such as the recent emails received by 
voters in multiple states from actors claiming to be far-right extremists "should spark bipartisan 
concern." The email attack, which has been attributed to Iran, was a "deliberate act to damage 
America, either by scaring voters or exacerbating existing tensions, and we see a government 
that should be more transparent with voters about these threats." The editorial board urges 
voters to "be mindful of these outside attacks, resist their fearmongering and divisiveness, and 
vote." 
FBI Alerted After Online Video Implies Maryland Election Judge Improperly Marked 
Ballot. 
WUSA-TV Washington (10/23, 98K) reports that the FBI has been alerted to a suspected 
"intentional disinformation attack this week" in Montgomery County, Maryland, "according to 
James Shalleck, the President of the County's Board of Elections." A video "showing an election 
judge marking a mail-in ballot with a pen" was circulated online, though "county elections 
authorities say [they] are false claims of election fraud." The FBI said its "standard practice is to 
neither confirm nor deny any investigation, we take all election-related threats seriously, and, 
we're committed to supporting our election security partners and protecting the American 
people during the 2020 election season." A Montgomery County investigation "determined the 
worker seen in the video was filling in a lightly marked mail-in ballot so that it could be 
accurately read by counting machines, according to elections authorities."
