The Center Square (07/02, Mckendry) reported that the FBI has issued an official alert to the public about 
the potential for malicious cyber actors to disrupt power generation, steal intellectual property, or hold 
critical information for ransom within the U.S. renewable energy sector. The warning comes as federal 
and local governments increasingly advocate for renewable energies, expanding the industry and creating 
more opportunities for cyber threats. The article added that according to the FBI, a 2019 incident 
underscored these risks when a private company lost visibility into approximately 500 megawatts of its 
wind and photovoltaic sites across California, Utah, and Wyoming due to a denial-of-service attack 
exploiting an unpatched firewall. Federal agencies, including the Department of Defense, the largest 
energy consumer within the U.S. government, are increasingly sourcing energy from local electric grids. 
The article mentioned that researchers are developing passive sensor devices to detect unusual electrical 
activity and counter such threats. By detecting deviations from normal patterns or unexpected 
fluctuations in electrical activity, these sensors can effectively identify potential cyber intrusions or 
unauthorized access attempts targeting the system's functionality. Industrial Cyber (07/02, Ribeiro) also 
reported on the story. 
Ticketmaster Data Hack Update: What Does it Mean for Millions of Customers 
Newsweek (07/02, Gooding) reported that Ticketmaster has confirmed to customers in the U.S. that it 
experienced a data breach earlier this year, but insisted that their accounts with the site were secure. 
Users of the ticket-selling site began sharing emails they had received last week about the data breach, 
first reported in late May. Email addresses, phone numbers, and some encrypted payment information 
were included in the breach, the company said, adding that it was notifying customers who had been 
affected. The article mentioned that the group behind the data breach was reported to be ShinyHunters, 
which first appeared in 2020. The article noted that the FBI reportedly tried to stop the hackers by 
shutting down the site they used to operate in May but without success.

discovered as part of its response after Sivananda Ashram Yoga Retreat Bahamas reported Casey missing
