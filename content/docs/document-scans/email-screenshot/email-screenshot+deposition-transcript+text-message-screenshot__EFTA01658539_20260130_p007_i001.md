French Authorities Crack Down On Islamists In Wake Of Teacher's Decapitation. 
The New York Times (10/19, Nossiter, 18.61M) reports that "as a wave of anger continued to 
sweep over France following the decapitation of a high school teacher, the French police 
conducted dozens of raids on Monday targeting individuals associated with radical Islamists, 
and the government vowed to shut down Muslim aid organizations and expel dozens of foreign 
nationals for showing signs of radicalism." According to the Times, "Thousands of people took to 
the streets in cities around France over the weekend to demonstrate their horror at the killing 
on Friday, and politicians, especially on the right, jostled to sound the alarm against 'the enemy 
within,' as Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin put it in a radio interview, referring to the 
country's radicalized Muslims." The Wall Street Journal (10/19, Dalton, Subscription Publication, 
7.57M) reports Darmanin said, "We must stop being naïve." Darmanin added, "There is no 
reconciliation possible with radical Islam." 
COUNTER-INTELLIGENCE 
While Ratcliffe Says There Is No Evidence Hunter Biden Emails Are Part Of 
"Disinformation Campaign," FBI Still Investigating. 
Fox News (10/19, Singman, 27.59M) reports DNI Ratcliffe, in an appearance on Fox Business 
on Monday, "said that Hunter Biden's laptop 'is not part of some Russian disinformation 
campaign,' amid claims from House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff suggesting 
otherwise." Ratcliffe is quoted as saying, "It's funny that some of the people who complain the 
most about intelligence being politicized are the ones politicizing the intelligence." Ratcliffe 
continued, "Unfortunately, it is Adam Schiff who said the intelligence community believes the 
Hunter Biden laptop and emails on it are part of a Russian disinformation campaign." Ratcliffe 
added, "Let me be clear: the intelligence community doesn't believe that because there is no 
intelligence that supports that. And we have shared no intelligence with Adam Schiff, or any 
member of Congress." 
Breitbart (10/19, Poor, 673K) reports Ratcliffe said, "Apparently, Chairman Schiff wants 
anything against his preferred political candidate to be deemed as 'not real' and as using the 
intelligence community or attempting to use the intelligence community to say there's nothing 
to see here." Ratcliffe added, "Don't drag the intelligence community into this. Hunter Biden's 
laptop is not part of some Russian disinformation campaign, and I think it's clear that the 
American people know that." In addition, the New York Post (10/19, Moore, 4.57M) reports that 
Ratcliffe "said the computer is 'in the jurisdiction of the FBI:" Ratcliffe added, "The FBI has had 
possession of this." Ratcliffe said, "Without commenting on any investigation that they may or 
may not have, their investigation is not centered around Russian disinformation and the 
intelligence community is not playing any role with respect to that." 
However, USA Today (10/19, Johnson, 10.31M) reports Ratcliffe's comments that the 
emails "are not connected to a Russian disinformation effort" came "even as federal authorities 
continued to review whether the material was part of such a campaign." USA Today adds 
Ratcliffe "did not elaborate on the basis of his conclusion, though he acknowledged knowing 
'little' about the material published by the New York Post." Similarly, NBC News (10/19, 
Dilanian, 6.14M) reports that Ratcliffe "insisted Monday that there is no evidence the Russians 
or other foreign actors were behind the emails allegedly found on a laptop linked to Hunter 
Biden, even as officials familiar with the matter tell NBC News the FBI continues to probe that 
question." 
In addition, the Daily Beast (10/19, Ackerman, Sommer, 1.39M) says Ratcliffe's 
assessment "gets out in front of the FBI, which took custody of the laptop and an external hard 
drive as early as in December, according to the New York Post." The FBI, according to a 
"congressional source," is "looking into the provenance of the material. And among the 
questions they're seeking to answer is whether the laptop dump is part of what the intelligence
