groups of students who need extra attention." Many of these schools "are in Florida and Texas, 
where Republican governors are requiring in-person classes, but schools are also open in New 
York City, Greenville, S.C., and Alpine, Utah, the state's largest district. Returns are planned in 
Charlotte, Baltimore and Denver." 
The Wall Street Journal (10/19, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) reports that determining 
how and when to bring students back into classrooms has been a difficult process as district 
officials and families weigh the risk of infection with parents' need to work, student loneliness, 
and fear that children will lose important academic skills. 
David Zweig, in The Intelliqencer (10/19, 1.1M), describes the schools in Chappaqua and 
Bronxville, New York, that have reopened to students, asking, "It's become a platitude that 'we 
all want children to be in school.' Yet considering the case rate for hybrid and remote learning is 
two-hundredths of a percent higher than it is for [full time in-person] learning (which a number 
of experts months ago had warned could happen), in Westchester, and the regional positivity 
rate has been hovering around 1% for months, why have so many districts been unable to 
achieve this aim?" 
Doctors With Long-Haul COVID Symptoms Pushing For Better Care. 
The Wall Street Journal (10/19, Reddy, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) reports that doctors 
and other healthcare professionals are overly represented among COVID patients who are 
experiencing persistent symptoms, and some are turning to one another to advocate for better 
treatments and greater awareness. 
DO) Says Trump Denied Rape Accusation In Official Presidential Capacity. 
The New York Times (10/19, Weiser, Feuer, 18.61M) reports the Justice Department "said on 
Monday that President Trump should not be sued personally for having denied a rape allegation 
because he made the statement while acting in his official capacity as president." The 
government's lawyers made the argument as they defended Attorney General Barr's "decision 
to intervene in a defamation lawsuit filed in a New York court against...Trump by E. Jean 
Carroll." The Times adds Carroll "has said that Mr. Trump raped her in a department store two 
decades ago and then falsely denied the attack while in office, branding her a liar and harming 
her reputation." The Washington Post (10/19, Barrett, 14.2M) reports Carroll's lawyers "have 
argued that the Justice Department's legal argument is 'inconceivable' because no American, 
not even the president, has a job description that 'includes slandering women who they 
sexually assaulted." 
Supreme Court Controls Fate Of Subpoena For Trump Tax Returns. 
CNN (10/19, Orden, 83.16M) says on its website that with "two weeks until the presidential 
election, a decision on whether to further delay handing over" President Trump's financial 
records "to New York prosecutors now rests with the Supreme Court after Trump's attorneys 
argued for a stay of the 'unprecedented' document request." CNN describes the new brief as 
"the final filing by the two sides before the court can decide whether to again push off 
enforcement of a subpoena by the Manhattan district attorney's office for years of Trump's 
financial records, including tax returns, from his longtime accountant, Mazars USA." 
Administration Facilitates Ability To Discipline Federal Workers. 
The Washington Post (10/19, Yoder, 14.2M) reports the Administration "has told federal 
agencies to make the fullest use of their discretion allowed by law to order disciplinary actions 
against their employees for reasons such as poor performance or misconduct." The final rules 
"published Friday and effective Nov. 15 either strongly discourage or ban practices that many 
agencies have adopted, repeatedly stressing management's 'sole and exclusive' authority to 
choose a penalty."
