experimental 5-megawatt reactor "at the Yongbyon nuclear complex, which is widely believed 
to have produced plutonium for weapons, has been shut down since early December 2018, the 
IAEA said in an annual report here dated Sept. 1 and posted online." There has, however, "been 
no telltale steam at the plutonium reprocessing lab there, suggesting the last batch of spent 
fuel stayed in the reactor building." 
The AP (9/2, Dineen) reports the agency also "said that its observations of cooling units at 
the Yongbyon nuclear fuel rod fabrication plant and vehicular movements there 'were consistent 
with the production of enriched uranium at the reported centrifuge enrichment facility." North 
Korea's "nuclear activities remain a cause for serious concern," the agency said. 
Bloomberg (9/2, Tirone, 4.73M) reports IAEA inspectors "did observe indications that 
North Korea is manufacturing enriched uranium, as well as mining and milling more of the 
heavy metal that is the key ingredient for reactors and bombs." 
Former CIA Assistant Director: South Korean National Police "Not Geared To Catching 
The North's Spies." 
In an op-ed for The Hill (9/2, 2.98M), former assistant director of the CIA for Korea John 
Finbarrr writes, who notes that South Korea "recently stripped its sprawling National 
Intelligence Service (NIS) of counterintelligence responsibilities," and as a result the 
"responsibility for the hunting of North Korean spies inside South Korea now rests with the 
Korean National Police (KNP)." Finbarr writes his "concern is that the KNP, bereft of close 
guidance and supervision from NIS counterintelligence professionals, will stumble when a South 
Korean MI5-like construct, under the KNP but with a degree of independence and some 
connective tissue back to the NIS, would better suit their needs." He concludes installing an 
"experienced hand from NIS, suitably divorced from his former agency, would send a message 
of clear intent to get the counterintelligence mission done right." 
Colombia Arrests Three Venezuelans "Tied To Anti-Maduro Plot." 
The AP (9/2, Goodman) reports police in Colombia have arrested "three Venezuelans who were 
part of a failed plot organized by a former U.S. Green Beret to sneak across the border and oust 
President Nicolas Maduro, The Associated Press has learned." All three lived "for months in 
rustic camps along Colombia's Caribbean coast where Jordan Goudreau, an American war 
veteran, was helping organize a volunteer army for a rapid cross-border strike against Maduro." 
It was not clear "if US officials played any role in Wednesday's arrests," but for months "the FBI 
has been interviewing associates of Goudreau as part of their own investigation into whether he 
violated U.S. laws that require any U.S. company supplying weapons or military equipment, as 
well as military training and advice, to foreign persons to seek State Department approval." 
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS 
New York Town Asks FBI To Probe Racist Hate Mail Sent To Ex-School 
Superintendent. 
The Riverhead (NY) Local (9/2, Civiletti) reports, "Riverhead Supervisor Yvette Aguiar said 
yesterday she has referred the racist hate mail received by the former Riverhead school 
superintendent to the Federal Bureau of Investigation." The Local adds, "Aguiar made the 
announcement during the town board meeting after questions and comments about the 
incident from two community members. She condemned the acts as 'despicable' and said they 
would not be tolerated." According to the Local, "In the week before former Riverhead school 
superintendent Dr. Aurelia Henriquez abruptly resigned from her position June 30, she received 
three handwritten notes containing ethnic and racial slurs and hate speech, according to 
documents obtained from the Suffolk County Police Department through a Freedom of 
Information Law request."
