protests...continue to serve as fodder for foreign influence and disinformation efforts in 
America." Politico (7/24, Matishak, 4.29M) calls it the Administration's "most pointed public 
warning to date about foreign election interference." 
Reuters (7/24, Hosenball) reports Evanina said "it was `imperative' his agency share with 
voters some of the information about possible interference that U.S. spies have given to 
campaigns and legislators." He explained, "the American public has a role to play in securing 
the election, particularly in maintaining vigilance against foreign influence...At the most basic 
level, we encourage Americans to consume information with a critical eye, check out sources 
before reposting or spreading messages, practice good cyber hygiene and media literacy, and 
report suspicious election-related activity to authorities." 
CBS News (7/24, Gazis, 3.68M) reports that Evanina said that China is "expanding its 
influence efforts to shape the policy environment in the United States." Russia "continues to 
spread disinformation in the United States that is designed to undermine confidence in our 
democratic process and denigrate what it sees as an anti-Russia `establishment' in America," 
while Iran's efforts "center around online influence, such as spreading disinformation on social 
media." 
The Hill (7/24, Miller, Rodrigo, 2.98M) reports that Evanina also warned, "Our adversaries 
also seek to compromise our election infrastructure, and we continue to monitor malicious 
cyber actors trying to gain access to U.S. state and federal networks, including those 
responsible for managing elections." Still, the Washington Times (7/24, Blake, 492K) reports 
that Evanina, "a veteran of both the FBI and CIA, said multiple factors have made it 
`extraordinarily difficult' for adversaries to broadly disrupt or change vote tallies undetected." 
ABC News (7/24, Bruggeman, 2.97M) reports that "perhaps most notably, Evanina noted 
efforts to `compromise the private communications' of campaigns - a startling echo of Russia's 
actions in 2016 to hack and disseminate the private emails of John Podesta, at the time a 
senior campaign advisor to Clinton." 
NBC News (7/24, Dilanian, 6.14M) reports that Evanina "made no mention of what 
American intelligence analysts have concluded about whether Russia is trying to help President 
Trump, as intelligence agencies assessed happened in 2016. The official who is coordinating the 
intelligence community's efforts on election interference, Shelby Pierson, told Congress months 
ago that there was evidence Russia again sought to boost Trump." 
Fox News (7/24, Singman, 27.59M) reports that Evanina "was tapped in May to handle 
briefing presidential candidates, their campaigns and major political parties on election security 
threats." 
The Washington Times (7/26, Lovelace, 492K) also covers Evanina's statement, as does 
Hearst Television (7/25, Albert), Voice of America (7/24, Schwartz, 48K), The Independent (UK) 
(7/24, Tidman, 1.36M), the Washington Examiner (7/24, Dunleavy, 448K), and Axios (7/24, 
Rummler, 521K). 
Democrats Criticize Evanina For Lack Of Specifics. The AP (7/24, Jalonick) reports 
Congressional Democrats released a letter Friday in response to Evanina's comments, urging 
the Trump Administration "to make a `concrete and specific statement' to inform voters ahead 
of the 2020 contest." The letter "did not detail exactly what they want the administration to 
say," but "said Evanina's statement `does not go nearly far enough in arming the American 
people with the knowledge they need about how foreign powers are seeking to influence our 
political process' and falsely paints the three countries as equivalent in their efforts." 
The Hill (7/24, Miller, 2.98M) reports that the statement, from House Speaker Pelosi, 
Senate Minority Leader Schumer, SSCI Vice Chair Mark Warner, and House Intel Chair Adam 
Schiff, said that Evanina's warning "fails to fully delineate the goal, nature, scope and capacity 
to influence our election, information the American people must have as we go into November." 
CNN (7/24, Cohen, 83.16M) also covers Evanina's statement, but leads with the Democrats' 
criticism. Mother Jones (7/24, Friedman, 881K) also reports on the Democrats' statement.
