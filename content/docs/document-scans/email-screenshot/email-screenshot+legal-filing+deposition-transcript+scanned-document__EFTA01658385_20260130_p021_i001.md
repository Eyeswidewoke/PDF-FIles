goes to Williams' successor, Gary Jones, whose agreement to cooperate in the investigation put 
speculation about who would be next to fall squarely on Williams. Prosecutors charged 
Williams...with conspiracy to embezzle union funds." 
Bloomberg (8/27, Dolmetsch, 4.73M) reports, "Williams was charged just weeks after 
General Motors Co. alleged that he received funds from Fiat Chrysler to place former UAW vice 
president Joe Ashton on GM's board. The accusations came as part of a lawsuit by GM alleging 
that Fiat Chrysler got better contracts than competing automakers by bribing union officials. 
Ashton has pleaded guilty and is awaiting sentencing. Williams received significant funds in 
bank accounts in Switzerland and Liechtenstein to help increase costs to GM through the 2015 
collective bargaining agreement and push it into merger talks with Fiat Chrysler, GM said." 
Deadline Detroit (8/27, Lengel) reports, "Williams, who headed the UAW from 2014-18, is 
the second ex-president to be charged in an ongoing public corruption investigation by the FBI, 
IRS, Department of Labor and U.S. Attorney's Office. Gary Jones pleaded guilty in June to 
conspiring with other high-level union officials to embezzle over $1 million of union dues. Some 
money went toward lavish expenses, including more than $13,000 on cigars for high-level 
officials. He's cooperating as part of his plea." 
WDIV-TV Detroit (8/27, Meloni, Kelly, 460K) reports, "Court documents claim more than 
$22,000 in union money was used to rent a villa for Williams for a four-month period in 2016-
17. Williams allegedly had taken more that $71,000 in union money. `The level of greed and 
disrespect and treatment of workers like they really don't matter — because you've decided to 
take their money and use it on cigars and booze and airfare and expensive lavish villas - it's 
disheartening," US Attorney Schneider said. 
Forbes (8/27, Robinson-Jacobs, 9.71M) reports, "In a statement, the UAW called Thursday 
a `sad day for UAW members,' but chose to focus on the future, saying: `we are aware of 
criminal charges filed against former UAW President Dennis Williams,' but adding that it plans to 
`focus on comprehensively reviewing and strengthening our union's financial and ethical policies 
and controls." Forbes adds, "A conviction of Williams could be used to pressure the UAW to 
agree to federal oversight aimed at eliminating corruption." 
US Charges Former Illinois Road Commissioner With Taking Kickbacks. 
The AP (8/27, Hwang) reports from Chicago, "A suburban Chicago road commissioner was 
indicted Thursday on federal charges alleging he took kickbacks from an excavation company to 
which he steered business over eight years." According to the AP, "The indictment alleges 
Robert Czerek, 69. the elected head of the Bloomingdale Township Road District, knew Bulldog 
Earth Movers didn't do much of the work for which it billed the township. Federal prosecutors 
allege Czernek took more than $280,000 in kickbacks from excavation company owner Debra 
Fazio, 63, and her employee, Mario Giannini, 58. In return, they said Czernek helped steer 
more than $700,000 from Bloomingdale Township to Bulldog Earth Movers." 
The Chicago Tribune (8/27, Meisner, 2.65M) reports that Czernek "was charged in a 20-
count indictment made public Thursday with taking the kickbacks from" Fazio, "owner of 
Bloomingdale-based Bulldog Earth Movers Inc., over a period of more than eight years," and "in 
exchange, Czemek used his official position to approve more than $700,000 in payments for 
stone delivery, dump leveling, and storm sewer invoices submitted by Fazio's company to 
Bloomingdale Township, according to the indictment. Czernek approved the invoices knowing 
that much of the work and services had not actually been performed, the indictment states." 
The Chicago Sun-Times (8/27, Seidel, 875K) reports, "Czernek, 69, has become the 
Chicago-area's latest elected official to face federal criminal charges." Czernek, Fazio and 
Giannini "have all been charged with 14 counts of honest services wire fraud. Fazio also faces 
six counts of money laundering."
