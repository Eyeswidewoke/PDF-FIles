Subject: Re: SV: [Sadhu Sanga) Consciousness 
Dear Soren & Witt 
I think most scientists would agree with the propositions of Seth Lloyd in his book Programming the Universe that the 
universe is a gigantic quantum computer (although why in this age of miniaturization a quantum computer needs to be 
the size of the universe to generate the universe is another question). If Seth Lloyd is right then everything in this 
universe is ultimately computer generated. 
As for consciousness the fact is that we are relying on consciousness in order to ask the question What is consciousness? 
And the fact that after all the advancements in computer science we can fundamentally disagree on such a basic 
question as to whether consciousness is computer generated or not means that ultimately we will never be able to 
completely answer that question. It is the same for physicists seeking the theory of everything. They are entities within 
the universe seeking to know everything about the universe. They are ultimately bound by the program that set them up 
in the first place.This is the way Seth Lloyd explains it: "Godel showed that the capacity for self-reference leads 
automatically to paradoxes in logic; the British mathematician Alan Turing showed that self-reference leads to 
uncomputability in computers." 
When a computer processes data the data contains instructions to the computer as to its source. Virtual drives are set 
up on computers that give the computer false information as to the source of the data and the computer is none the 
wiser. This is what I meant when I said that computers are tricked every day as to the source of the data they are 
processing. Sensory data contains instructions that it is coming from a physical external world, but it ain't necessarily so. 
Kind regards 
Brad

Dear Brad 
As a biologist I will deny that we are a computers in the Turing understanding of it. I know we try to imitate living neural 
networks in the dead computers we have now. It gives a few steps forward but does not really solve the deed problem. 
You need to define a much more general model for computation that can cover what our machine do as well as living 
organisms including those without a brain do and how socio-communicative function. As a scientist and philosopher I 
have to say that we have not agreed on what we are or what the world is constructed from. No doubt the concepts of 
matter, energy, force and information are depicting true aspects of reality, but when I in neurobiology and psychology 
was looking for experience and qualia in the nervous system, I — and nobody else - did not find any. There is some 
insufficiencies on our metaphysical framework. This is why i am interested in the debate with other cultural metaphysics 
of which Advaita Vedanta is one of the more interesting and I think can be brought into harmony with a new physical 
understanding build on quantum physics and non-equilibrium thermodynamics systems science and cybernetics and last 
but no least Peircean semiotics.
