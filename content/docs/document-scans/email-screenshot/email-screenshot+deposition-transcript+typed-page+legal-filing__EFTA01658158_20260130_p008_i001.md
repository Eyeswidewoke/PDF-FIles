we've asked for federal agents to cooperate with us on a number of strategies. They haven't 
provided the federal funding that was promised to Albuquerque for police and crime 
interventions. And earlier in this Administration, they closed down Border Patrol check points 
and we had to cover those with state police, so the timing of their efforts remains to be a bit 
suspect." 
Cleveland Mayor, Police Chief Seek To Calm Unease About Federal Agents. 
The Cleveland Plain Dealer (7/24, Heisig, 895K) reports, "Cleveland Mayor Frank Jackson and 
his top law enforcement official on Friday tried to assuage residents' concerns about a group of 
federal agents that The White House announced would come to Cleveland, repeatedly saying 
the goal was to do nothing more than address violent crime." The Plain Dealer adds that 
Jackson and Cleveland police Chief Calvin Williams said "that the number of agents were 
already allocated to Cleveland under a previously announced Justice Department operation. 
Williams said these are not 'federal troops' seen in cities such as Portland but rather criminal 
investigators that will partner with city officers. 'I want to stress there are no federal troops 
coming to the city of Cleveland,' Williams said. Still, Jackson expressed dismay that he only 
learned about the new Justice Department initiatives when reporters started calling the city 
about it, saying that's not how partnerships should work." 
US Charges Philadelphia Man With Stealing From Bank During Protests. 
Fox News (7/24, Carter, 27.59M) reports, "A Philadelphia man was ordered detained pending 
trial on charges of stealing $104,000. The incident occurred inside a Wells Fargo Bank May 31, 
following a surge of protests across the country in response to the police killing of George Floyd 
in Minneapolis a week earlier. 'Amid peaceful protests and an outbreak of civil unrest, criminal 
opportunists sought to take advantage of the chaos,' Michael J. Driscoll, Special Agent in Charge 
of the FBI's Philadelphia Division, said in a statement. 'Numerous banks across the city 
experienced vandalism and forced entry, but this daylight forklift burglary was the most brazen 
incident by far. The FBI/Philadelphia Police Violent Crimes Task Force continues to work the 
case, to identify the others involved. Our message to those folks: we'll see you soon." 
Trump: Protesters "Are Actually Anarchists Who Hate Our Country." 
President Trump tweeted Sunday evening, "The 'protesters' are actually anarchists who hate 
our Country. The line of innocent 'mothers' were a scam that Lamestream refuses to 
acknowledge, just like they don't report the violence of these demonstrations!" 
Administration Officials Voice Support For Deployment Of Federal Agents. The 
Washington Examiner (7/26, Soellner, 448K) reports Acting DHS Secretary Wolf on Sunday 
warned against a "dangerous" trend of demonizing law enforcement. Wolf, on Fox News' 
Sunday Morning FuturesVi , "said...there's been an inaccurate description of what agents are 
doing to control the situation and that calling the demonstrations 'peaceful' is misleading." Said 
Wolf, "We're standing up for law and order. And anyone who says otherwise is not being 
accurate. I will say that the other side that wants to criticize law enforcement, what they don't 
do, they do not condemn these acts of violence in Portland. I have talked with a number of 
Democratic members of Congress, and all but one, only one, have asked me about the health of 
my officers. All they want to do is condemn law enforcement for doing their job." 
Chief of Staff Meadows, on ABC's This WeekVI (7/26, 2.47M), said, "In Portland, we have 
federal officers that are protecting a courthouse that actually has not only been vandalized, 
they're trying to burn it down. We can't have this in American cities. ... You've got people there 
throwing Molotov cocktails and doing all kinds of rioting in Portland around a courthouse they 
desire to burn down, that's very different than what we're doing in Chicago, New Mexico and 
Kansas and in other areas. What we're trying to do there is come in and help with gang 
violence and making sure we make arrests."
