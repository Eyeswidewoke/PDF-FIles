respects the law and safeguards privacy and civil rights." The principles also "call for the

EU Data Watchdogs Warn No Grace Period After Schrems II Privacy Shield Ruling. 
TechCrunch (7/24, Lomas, 605K) reported European data watchdogs "have issued updated 
guidance in the wake of last week's landmark ruling striking down a flagship transatlantic data 
transfer mechanism called Privacy Shield." In an FAQ on the Schrems II judgment, the 
European Data Protection Board (EDPB) "warns there will be no regulatory grace period." The 
EU-U.S. Privacy Shield "is dead, and any companies still relying on it to authorize transfers of 
EU citizens' personal data are doing so illegally is the top-line message." The EDPB writes, 
"Transfers on the basis of this legal framework are illegal." Entities that "wish to keep on 
transferring personal data to the US need to use an alternative mechanism - but must first 
determine whether they can meet the legal requirement to protect the data from US 
surveillance." The Wall Street Journal (7/24, Stupp, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) reported a 
surprise ruling from the EU's top court last week creates challenges for how companies will 
transfer data outside of the bloc. It has also caused new difficulties for the people tasked with 
making sure the appropriate rules are adhered to.

There are a few things "that stand out with regard to the three major intelligence services: the 
Security Service, the Secret Intelligence Service, and Government Communications 
Headquarters." GCHQ is "lauded for launching 'a new Engineering Accelerator which will allow 
GCHQ engineers to work with - and learn from - startups working on areas such as artificial 
intelligence and machine learning:" There is also a "salute to GCHQ's efforts to counter credit 
card fraud." Though details are "not provided, this very likely centers around offensive actions 
to dismantle dark web sites selling stolen credit card details."

Why VA Hospital Employee Gave Several Veterans Deadly Insulin Doses Is Still 
Unknown. 
The Washington Post (7/23, Born, Rein, 14.2M) says Reta Mays, who killed seven veterans at a 
Veterans Affairs hospital in West Virginia by injecting them with deadly doses of insulin, 
"pleaded guilty last week to seven counts of second-degree murder and one count of assault 
with the intent to commit an eighth murder." However, why Mays, a veteran herself, did what 
she did is still unknown, though the Post adds that she "provided a potential clue at her plea 
hearing, telling the judge she was taking medication for post-traumatic stress disorder."

up to a house belonging to Judge Esther Sales on a suburban street in North Brunswick, N.J.,
