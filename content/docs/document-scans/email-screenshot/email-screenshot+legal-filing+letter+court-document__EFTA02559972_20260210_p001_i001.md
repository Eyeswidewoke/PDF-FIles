Temasek reconsiders StanChart stake 
Singapore investment fund Temasek has sounded out potential buyers for =ts £6bn stake in Standard Chartered, 
potentially reigniting talk of a =akeover of the emerging markets bank. 
The fund, which is owned by the Singapore government, had been judging =uyer interest for its 18 per cent shareholding 
in recent months, said =eople close to the situation. 
Bankers said earlier momentum for a sale fell last month as StanChart's =hares dropped 20 per cent on the day it was 
accused by a US regulator =f breaching US sanctions on Iran. After settling the dispute with a =340m payment, the 
bank's share price has rebounded. 
Temasek became StanChart's biggest single shareholder six years ago, =uying out the 11.5 per cent stake of the Khoo 
family for a small =ndisclosed discount to its then market value of E2.3bn. The family =ad been the bank's protector 
since the 1980s, when it had become the =ubject of an unwelcome bid from Lloyds Bank. 
StanChart, which has its headquarters in the UK but a business focus on =he emerging markets of Asia and the Middle 
East, is one of the few =lobally active banks to be largely unscathed by the financial crisis. =t has attracted interest from 
the likes of JPMorgan and Santander, =ccording to bankers. Although private discussions have taken place, =othing has 
come of them, largely because StanChart's robust valuation =96 its market capitalisation is £35bn — would make it hard 
to =wallow. 
StanChart trades at a 1.4 times multiple of book value at a time when =any rivals, particularly in Europe, trade on less 
than half that. =nalysts said Temasek might be keen to take advantage of the relative =trength and reduce its exposure 
to financial services, given the =conomic uncertainty. 
Bankers believe any ambition Temasek might have had to engineer a merger =etween StanChart and another of its 
investments, Singaporean bank DEIS, =as faded, given the complexities and regulatory hostility to big =anking mergers. 
Temasek has hired two western bankers — Greg Curl from Bank of America =errill Lynch and John Cryan, former finance 
director of Swiss bank UBS =96 to help oversee its stakes in businesses in the US and Europe. =eople close to the 
situation stressed that there were no live =iscussions with any potential buyer. Both Temasek and StanChart =eclined to 
comment. 
Temasek signalled a move away from its StanChart stake a year ago when =t issued an innovative convertible bond that 
would convert into =tanChart shares under some circumstances. 
The three-year bond, which raised more than $600m, would potentially =have nearly 1 percentage point off the fund's 
total stake if the =ank's shares rise beyond the prerequisite 27 per cent premium to the =hen share price of £14.29. The 
shares closed on Monday at £14.81. 
After the row over sanctions, people close to the bank signalled an =ccelerated shake-up of its board, which was 
criticised by shareholders =arlier in the year. Temasek withheld support for the re-election of =xecutive directors except 
chief executive Peter Sands and two =on-executives.
