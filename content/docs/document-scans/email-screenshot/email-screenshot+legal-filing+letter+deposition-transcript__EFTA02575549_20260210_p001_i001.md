I am concerned that Deborah "strategies" are going to cost us a fortune with little or no results.

Dear Noam, 
You are waiting for me to provide guidance as to how you can regain control of the trust funds. My plan is to prepare a 
memo for you outlining your options in light of the trust terms. I anticipate being able to spend some time on this over 
the weekend, along with reviewing the drafts of your estate planning documents. Once I have sent the memo to you we 
can discuss your thoughts and we can then respond to Max. Unfortunately this is a difficult situation, not simple and 
straightforward, because of the terms of the trust and fiduciary law applicable to trusts. Please see my email of 10/17 
for an explanation of some of the issues. 
In some situations a trust is drafted so that you would have the right to remove and replace the trustee, and in doing so 
perhaps find a trustee that would not inquire so diligently as to your personal financial circumstances before making a 
principal distribution to you. 
In this regard, please refer to my email of 10/17 where I summarize the trustee removal, resignation and appointment 
provisions. The trustees can both resign at any time. They appoint successors subject to your approval. If they agree to 
resign you can find a new independent trustee whom they can appoint. If not, you can remove them but only with the 
approval of a majority of your children. Do you think your daughters would agree to remove Max and Harry? If so you 
could then appoint a successor. You would need to find an independent trustee. I can help you craft a letter to your 
daughters if you think they might agree to do this. 
My one additional thought right now that I need to review more closely is that Harry, not being the independent trustee, 
should not have a say in the distribution decision. If there is nothing in the trust to contradict this interpretation (I need 
to review the trust again) then Max alone has the power. However this would likely not change the analysis that Max 
believes he needs to go through since he is accountable to all beneficiaries. He believes he needs some level of financial 
information from you but in my view that does not need to be detailed. I can discuss with him what level of detail would 
satisfy him; however, if my understanding is correct that you do not wish to provide him with any backup for his 
distribution decision, then we should evaluate the removal option and any other strategies I may be able to come up 
with.
