they can't stand our refusal to get tough with Israel on the Palestinians= We've just suspended a chunk of military aid to

getting a Palestinian state without U.S. Secreta=y of State John Kerry's peace process lifeline. 
The fact is, for the first time in half a century, Washington lacks a truly=consequential Arab partner with whom to 
cooperate on matters relating to p=ace or war. Part of the reason is surely because our own street cred is mu=h 
diminished. But most of our predicament derives from regional deficits -= the weakness of the Arab leaders and states 
themselves, and the turbulent=changes loosed in the region in the past several years. 
You might even go so far as to suggest that, today, the three most conseque=tial powers in the region are the non-
Arabs: Iran, Turkey, and Israel. All=are serious, stable countries, with strong economies and militaries. Too b=d we can't 
forge a partnership among that triad. The Middle East ibility of an U.S.-Iranian rapprochement on the horizon, China's 
expansion in the Middle East ultimately poses th= greatest threat to Iran over the long term. The U.S. will undoubtedly
