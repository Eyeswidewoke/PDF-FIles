assaulting a Black music producer more than a week ago, an episode captured on video that 
has stunned the French public and shaken the government." Michel Zecler says the officers

The AP (11/30) reports "hundreds of retirees rallied" in Minsk on Monday against Belarusian

Tigray Leader Calls On Ahmed To Withdraw Troops. 
The AP (11/30, Anna) reports, "The fugitive leader of Ethiopia's defiant Tigray region on 
Monday called on Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed to 'stop the madness' and withdraw troops from 
the region as he asserted that fighting continues 'on every front' two days after Abiy declared 
victory." Debretsion Gebremichael said in a telephone interview that he "remains near the 
Tigray capital, Mekele, which the Ethiopian army on Saturday said it now controlled." 
Gebremichael "asserted that 'we are sure we'll win" and "accused the Ethiopian forces of

Farmers Block New Delhi Highways In Protest Over Agricultural Policies. 
The New York Times (11/30, Gettleman, Singh, Kumar, 18.61M) reports "thousands of angry 
farmers" have descended on New Delhi to protest new agricultural policies introduced by the 
government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Though Modi's party "firmly controls the 
government, the growing farmers' rebellion seems to have rattled his administration. In India, 
more than 60 percent of the population depends on agriculture to make a living." The 
government "has indicated that it will not talk to the protesting farmers unless they move to a 
fairground on New Delhi's outskirts and stop blocking the highways. But the farmers have said 
that they will not move their tractors or trailers until negotiations start." 
Cuban Government Refuses Dialogue With Protesters. 
The Miami Herald (11/30, 1.09M) reports, "Less than 24 hours after the Ministry of Culture 
reached an agreement in response to an unprecedented public protest by more than 300 young 
artists and intellectuals demanding freedom of expression and the release of several members 
of the San Isidro Movement, the Cuban government unleashed a wave of attacks against what 
Cuban leader Miguel Diaz-Canel called a 'media show' and an example of U.S. meddling in the 
island's internal affairs." Diaz-Canel "shut down hopes of a dialogue with the young protesters 
who stood before the Ministry of Culture on Friday to protest the harassment of artists, 
journalists, and academics of the San Isidro Movement." The Wall Street Journal (11/30, 
Cordoba, Perez, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) looks at the protest, saying it may have been 
the largest peaceful demonstration since Fidel Castro took power in 1959.
