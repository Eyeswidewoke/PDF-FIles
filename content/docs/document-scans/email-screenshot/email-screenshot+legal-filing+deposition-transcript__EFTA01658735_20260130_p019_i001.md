WPost: Voters Usher In "New Phase Of Drug Policy." 
In an editorial, the Washington Post (11/12, 14.2M) says that Election Day votes to legalize 
recreational marijuana in New Jersey, Arizona, South Dakota, and Montana, medical marijuana 
in Mississippi, and decriminalize "small quantities" of hard drugs in Oregon "mark a welcome 
shift in decades of destructive drug policy" beginning with "the Reagan-era escalation of the 
war on drugs." The Post says "severe criminal penalties have fueled a huge growth in the prison 
population" with an outsized impact on many Black communities, while soaring opioid overdose 
deaths have underscored "just how cruel and counterproductive it is to criminalize addiction." 
With new state legislation, The Post argues, researchers will now "be able to closely observe 
these laboratories of democracy, hopefully ushering in a new phase of drug policy based on 
evidence and the principles of public health."

DO) Report: Acosta Engaged In No Misconduct When He Agreed To Epstein Plea Deal. 
The CBS Evening NewsVi (11/12, story 10, 0:25, O'Donnell, 4.06M) reported, "This news 
today: The Justice Department said the prosecutor who handled a 2008 case against Jeffrey 
Epstein showed poor judgment but did not engage in professional misconduct. Alex Acosta, who 
later became President Trump's labor secretary, was under fire for the generous plea deal that 
he entered into with Epstein, who was accused of abusing dozens of teenage girls. Well, today, 
a lawyer for Epstein's victims called the DOJ report a cover-up." 
The AP (11/12, Balsamo, Tucker) says a report from the Justice Department's Office of 
Professional Responsibility has found Acosta "exercised 'poor judgment' in handling an 
investigation into wealthy financier Jeffrey Epstein when he was a top federal prosecutor in 
Florida." The report details Acosta's "handling of a secret plea deal with Epstein, who had been 
accused of sexually abusing dozens of underage girls." According to the AP, the report 
"concludes that none of the prosecutors committed misconduct in their interactions with the 
victims," which the AP says is "likely to disappoint the victims, who have long hoped this would 
hold the Justice Department officials accountable for actions they say allowed Epstein to escape 
justice." 
Reuters (11/12) reports, "In a statement released on Thursday, the Justice Department 
said that when Acosta let Epstein enter the non-prosecution agreement in 2008 that spared him 
from federal sex trafficking charges, he 'failed to make certain that the state of Florida intended 
to and would notify victims identified through the federal investigation about the state plea 
hearing." Reuters also reports that Sen. Ben Sasse (R-NE) denounced the report's conclusions, 
saying, "Letting a well-connected billionaire get away with child rape and international sex 
trafficking isn't 'poor judgment' - it is a disgusting failure." 
The New York Times (11/12, Goldstein, Benner, 18.61M) says that "the review was an 
attempt to close the door on an embarrassing episode for the Justice Department that critics 
have said allowed Mr. Epstein to largely go unscrutinized in the face of years of allegations that 
he sexually abused dozens of teenage girls." The Times says despite the department's 
insistence "in its summary that it found no wrongdoing, it is clear from the full, nearly 350-page 
report that Mr. Epstein and his defense lawyers were in control of the negotiations from June 
2007."
