this is the content from the emails I got from the geek squad guy, if you need a bullet point or summary let me know 
best 
Scott 
email 1 
> My name is Michael Dye, and I am a Home Entertainment Advisor with the Geek Squad. I met with Scott and we had a 
great conversation about where we can go with your home theater system. 
• 
Scott went over some specific goals that you have for the system, I would like to mention those first. 
• 
Our first, and I imagine most difficult goal will be to improve the sound. I think your idea to replace your existing 
Pre-amp with a new receiver from Denon will help quite a bit. Scott indicated that you were definitely after AirPlay 
capability in the receiver we choose, so I would recommend the AVR-4311CI. 
<http://usa.denon.com/US/Product/Pages/Product-Detail.aspx?Catid=3d9614d1-8000-4106-ab91-
8192242cab83&Subld=40135820d-83c2-4e93-9909-60aae60e0bdd&Productld=082714d9-ea72-4069-9b6b-
a39c23290d98> This will be able to interface with your existing amplifier. 
• 
The next major change is to switch out the projector. This should not be a problem if the lens you own is the 
short throw version. Even with this lens the throw distance is a very tight fit, and we will need to zoom all of the way out 
to make it work. I mention this so that you are aware of the potential issue. 
• 
Scott indicated to me that you are also looking to replace your existing cable box, satellite receiver and DVD 
player with an AppleTV and a Blu-ray disc player. This is a great pair of upgrades to make. With the AppleTV we only 
have one option, but with the Blu-ray I think we are looking at Samsung. For maximum future compatability I would 
consider the BDC-6900 <http://www.samsung.com/us/video/blu-ray-dvd/BD-C6900/XAA> . This player has a couple of 
features you do not need, such as 3D, but it is Samsungs flagship player, and is ready for anything coming up in the near 
future. 
• 
Finally, we are going to need new cabling inside the wall. Scott and I discussed the option of farming this labor 
out to a contractor to save money and to prevent the long term presence of holes in your walls while the contractor and 
us work out our schedules. Upon further discussion with Richard this sounded like an even better option as it sounds like 
we will have to take a rather long and circuitous route through your wall. This will require a choice of either a very long 
HDMI cable or the use of network cables combined with a balun. A balun can be thought of as a cable converter, it 
basically turns two network cables into an HDMI. There are definite hazards to running HDMI this kind of distance, I 
would like to discuss these with you in greater detail before we make a decision. 
• 
During our meeting Scott and I also discussed some other options, basically, what would we do if this were our 
system. I will address these in the same order as above.
