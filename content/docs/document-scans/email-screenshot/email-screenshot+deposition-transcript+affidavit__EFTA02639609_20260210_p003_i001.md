Jeffrey-leon and I (and martin kelly) all like john c for the coo/cfo role. Next step is for you to interview him; hopefully in 
person. When will you be arnd or is this a skype. 
Remember he's at the sackler family coming from ray chambers. Various=20 observations were: nice manor, seasoned, 
sufficient seniority to have rj report to him, willing to get hands dirty on numbers, knowledge of IT platforms, 
partnership issues, accounting. 
Let me know what works. B
