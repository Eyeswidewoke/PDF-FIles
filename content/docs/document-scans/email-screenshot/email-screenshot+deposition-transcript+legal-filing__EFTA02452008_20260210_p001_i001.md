Re: 
I kind of feel like each "context" is a different =itness landscape or function and that we live in multiple and =onflicting 
fitness landscapes - sort of like parallel universes or =ifferent sets of forces at different scales. The other part is probably 
=he unit of "groupness" that you sometimes talk about - =ribe, individual, species, etc. Each of these fitness landscapes 
push =s to search for a more optimal position - power, fun, comfort, energy, =ood, reproduction, security. These seem 
like the different forces or =E2 purposes" that drive us. This isn't exactly, =ight but I feel it's something like this. Talking 
about your =E2 languages" - I think that different people might care =ore about different dimensions of their fitness 
(maybe this isn't=the right word) and the diversity and the weight of your existence on =ertain dimensions is a strong 
part of your character and also your =bility to influence those on that dimensions (maybe the idea of local =urrencies is a 
better way to describe this and maybe you can boil down =o power/money as you point out, but I'm not sure...) 
Neri got tied up with a student's thesis review... 
"meaning"... maybe. 
Great talking to you. Fun that Tenzin gets a lot out of these =onversations as I do.
