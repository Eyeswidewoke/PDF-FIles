interest in Jiangsu Sinorgchem Technology Co. Ltd., a China-based company that makes rubber chemicals. Federal 
prosecutors said the man's business partner, a Chinese woman who was not indicted, financed the bogus raid. The 
two had been embroiled in legal disputes over the company in the United States and China for more than a decade, 
prosecutors said. A DOJ press release quoted Akil Davis, the Assistant Director in Charge of the FBI's Los Angeles 
Field Office, who said, "The defendants in this case allegedly believed they could carry out vigilante justice by using 
official police powers to enter the home of vulnerable victims and extorting them out of millions of dollars, the FBI 
will not tolerate civil rights violations by anyone who takes the law into their own hands for personal gain or 
otherwise." CBS News (08/12, Staff Writer), Los Angeles Times (08/12, Mejai, Blakinger, Ormseth), and NBC 
News (08/12, Planas) also reported on the story. 
Gold Bar Scams Net Millions in Maryland 
The Washington Post (08/12, Morse) reported that fraudsters pose as federal agents, finding targets online or over 
the phone. They tell them their bank accounts are no longer safe. Eventually, after a series of communications, the 
swindlers persuade their targets to buy pricey gold bars and hand them over for safekeeping. The article stated 
that in Montgomery County, Md. — an area just north of Washington with large pockets of wealth — the scam is 
hitting hard. At least seven victims, authorities said Monday, have given up $6.3 million in gold bars over the last 
year — gold bars that they've never seen again. And that is just the cases being prosecuted. The number of actual 
victims, authorities said, is probably much higher. The article quoted FBI Supervisory Special Agent Keith Custer, 
who said, "The scammers are asking for gold because it is a transaction that looks somewhat more normal than an 
elderly victim walking to a bank and attempting to withdraw $50,000 in cash, when looked at from the outside, the 
purchase of gold bullion is a normal investment activity. Lots of people want to invest in gold. So if a senior wires 
$50,000 to an online vendor, it looks like a normal transaction." The article quoted Bill DelBagno, Special Agent in 
Charge of the Bureau's Baltimore Field Office, who said, "They shuffle you around between fake agencies about 
your bank accounts being compromised. The scammers are very convincing. People are losing their life savings, 
their homes, their trust, their security. Unfortunately, it's happening across the United States." CBS News (08/12, 
Mendez) also reported on the story. 
Man Accused of Voting in Both Florida and Pennsylvania Faces Charges 
The Associated Press (08/12, Scolforo) reported that a man faces federal charges that he voted in both Florida and 
in Pennsylvania for the 2020 presidential election, and twice in Pennsylvania during the November 2022 election. 
The U.S. attorney's office in Philadelphia said Friday it had filed five charges against 62-year-old Philip C. Pulley of 
Huntingdon Valley, alleging he violated federal election law by falsely registering to vote, double voting and 
engaging in election fraud. The article stated that Pulley is accused of using a false Philadelphia address and Social 
Security number when in 2020 he registered in Philadelphia while already being registered to vote in Montgomery 
County, Pennsylvania, and Broward County, Florida. That year he requested a mail-in ballot in Philadelphia and 
voted in both Montgomery and Broward, according to the criminal allegations. A Dal press release noted that the 
case was investigated by the FBI and the Pennsylvania Attorney General's Office. The Philadelphia Inquirer (08/12, 
Bernard), and Newsweek (08/12, Lewis) also reported on the story. 
Arkansas Officer Fired After Being Caught on Video Beating Inmate in Back of Patrol Car 
The Associated Press (08/12, Demillo) reported that an Arkansas police officer has been fired after he was caught 
on video beating a handcuffed inmate in the back of his patrol car, and the police chief says he will refer the case to 
prosecutors. Jonesboro Police Chief Rick Elliott fired Officer Joseph Harris on Friday, the day after Harris was caught 
on his patrol car video punching, elbowing and slamming the car door on an inmate being transferred from a local 
hospital back to the county jail. The article stated that Elliott reviewed the video after receiving a complaint from 
the county sheriff's office about the incident. The department also posted the video on its YouTube page and 
announced the officer's firing. Elliott said he would be referring the case to the local prosecutor and was putting 
together paperwork in the coming days to send to the prosecutor. The article mentioned that Elliott also said he 
had contacted the FBI's Little Rock office about the incident and would ask the state to decertify Harris as a police 
officer.
