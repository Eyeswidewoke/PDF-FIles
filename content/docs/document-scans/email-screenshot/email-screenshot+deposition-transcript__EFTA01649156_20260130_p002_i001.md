FBI Offers $20K Reward for Capture of Former Arkansas Police Chief on the Run 
Fox News (05/30, Conklin) reported that the FBI is offering a $20,000 reward for information leading to the re-capture of a former Arkansas police chief serving 
time for murder and rape — dubbed 'the Devil in the Ozarks" — who escaped on the afternoon of May 25. Former Gateway Police Department Chief Grant Hardin, 
56, escaped from the North Central Unit, a medium-security prison, that Sunday afternoon in Calico Rock, according to the Arkansas Department of Corrections. 
The FBI said Hardin has ties to Garfield, Eureka Springs, Holiday Island, and Huntsville. "The FBI's Little Rock Field Office is assisting the U.S. Marshal Service, the 
Arkansas Department of Corrections, and the Arkansas State Police with the search for and apprehension of Grant Matthew Hardin," reads an FBI wanted poster.

Feds Arrest New Hampshire CEO for Allegedly Devising Conspiracy to Stalk, Intimidate Journalists 
CBS News (05/31, Tabachnick) reported that the former CEO of Granite Recovery Centers, a network of drug and alcohol treatment centers in New Hampshire, was 
arrested Friday for allegedly orchestrating a conspiracy to stalk journalists, the Department of Justice said in a statement. According to the article, Eric Spofford, 40, 
was accused of targeting journalists employed by New Hampshire Public Radio (NHPR) in retaliation for publishing an investigation that allegedly revealed multiple 
allegations of sexual misconduct against him while he was the CEO of the recovery centers. Spofford opened the Granite Recovery Centers after struggling with 
heroin addiction and turned the business into the largest addiction treatment network in New Hampshire. New Hampshire Public Radio President and CEO Jim 
Schachter said everyone on their team was grateful to the U.S. Attorney's Office and the FBI for pursuing the case against Spofford and his associates. The New 
York Times (05/30, Enrich), NBC News (05/31, Lavietes), Patch (05/30, Schinella), and UPI (05/31, Heuer) also reported on the story. 
Cybersecurity Investigators Worry Ransomware Attacks May Worsen as Young, Western Hackers Work With Russians 
CBS News (05/30, Whitaker) reported that the FBI and private security companies are constantly battling ransomware gangs, which are groups of hackers that 
break into corporate computer networks, encrypt critical files, and demand a ransom in exchange for unlodung the data, with victims including companies, cities, 
hospitals, and hotels. According to the article, the FBI is particularly concerned about a group of young, English-speaking hackers from the US, UK, and Canada 
known as 'Scattered Spider, who were thought to have gone quiet after several arrests but are now believed to be back in operation, and are suspected of being 
involved in one of the most pernicious ransomware attacks in history, which was unleashed on MGM Resorts in September 2023, costing the hotel and casino giant 
over $100 million. The article highlighted that the FBI recommends that companies do not pay ransoms to hackers, as it can encourage further attacks, and instead 
advises companies to focus on improving their cybersecurity measures to prevent such attacks from happening in the first place, with the head of the FBI's Cyber 
Division, Bryan Vorndran, stating that "from an FBI perspective, our position is we recommend a ransom not be paid'. In an interview with 60 Minutes, Vorndran 
stated that ransomware attacks have become increasingly brazen, with global losses exceeding $1 billion per year, posing a significant problem for the global 
economy, the U.S. economy, and the security of the United States. The article explained that the Russian government provides a safe haven for these ransomware 
gangs, and as a result, they have become a significant threat, prompting the NSA to join the fight, with the agency's director of cybersecurity, Rob Joyce, stating 
that the Colonial Pipeline attack was a wake-up call. In the interview, Vorndran calls this an evolution of cybercrime, and the Bureau has made several arrests, 
including a 19-year-old from Florida, Noah Urban, who pleaded guilty to stealing cryptocurrency and has been tied to Scattered Spider, with other arrests and ties 
to the group also being made.
