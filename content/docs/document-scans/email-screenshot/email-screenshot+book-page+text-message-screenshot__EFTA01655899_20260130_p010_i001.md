post. The FBI's questionnaire asks respondents if they worked for ARC or were a patient at an ARC facility since Jan. 
1, 2019, and if they received any medical procedures, exams or services from ARC that "were not medically 
necessary or were not adequately rendered." It also asks respondents to list services they received that they 
believe weren't billed appropriately. The article added that the investigation announcement comes after ARC 
started running the substance use program at the Kenton County Detention Center in July. In late 2023, Kenton 
County Jailer Marc Fields issued a request for proposals seeking a third-party to run the jail's substance use 
program, a treatment program for inmates with addiction.

FINANCIAL CRIME & CORPORATE SCANDALS 
SEC Probe of B. Riley Widens as Struggling Firm's Stock Drops More Than 50% on Profit Warning 
The New York Post (08/12, Kosman) reported that the feds have widened a probe of financial irregularities at B. 
Riley, sources said — even as the struggling Wall Street firm suspended its dividend and warned on profits Monday, 
sending its stock tumbling more than 50%. Short sellers in June and July continued to deliver information on B. 
Riley to the Securities and Exchange Commission — and the SEC has asked them for additional material in a 
continuing probe, according to emails and texts. The article added that SEC investigators are interested in loans B. 
Riley may have guaranteed for its former business partner Brian Kahn, a source with direct knowledge of the 
situation said. In January, Kahn resigned as CEO of the Franchise Group, which owns Vitamin Shoppe and Sylvan 
Learnings tutoring centers. Kahn stepped down after news reports linked him to Prophecy Asset Management, an 
investment firm that collapsed in March 2020 which prosecutors have alleged hid Kahn's trading losses. Khan has 
not been charged and he has denied wrongdoing. The article stated that Prophecy reportedly collapsed when it 
was supposed to invest with diverse money managers and instead allegedly invested mainly with one, suspected to 
be Kahn's Vintage Capital, which lost all its money, roughly $300 million. The co-founder of Prophecy John Hughes 
pled guilty to a conspiracy to commit securities fraud in 2023 and his sentencing was recently postponed to Feb. 5, 
2025, according to court records. There is speculation he is cooperating with prosecutors. The article 
quoted Richard Langham, Acting Special Agent in Charge of the FBI's Philadelphia Division, who said, "Hughes 
actively led clients to believe they were investing responsibly, putting their money into low-risk funds, as these lies 
continued and the losses mounted, he engaged in a cover-up, trying to conceal the staggering fraud."

They Looked Like An Ordinary Texan Family. The FBI Says The Parents Are Pig Butcherers Who Stole $10 
Million. 
Forbes (08/12, Brewster) reported that living in a large house in the affluent city of Frisco, Texas, Feng Chen, his 
wife Tianqiong Xu, and their two children appeared to be a normal, if wealthy, family. The FBI, however, has alleged 
that they are behind a $10 million online "pig butchering" scam, according to search warrants and an indictment. 
In January this year, they left Texas and returned to China, where they are citizens, the documents say. According to 
the article, Chen and Xu are facing wire fraud charges for allegedly creating a number of rogue cryptocurrency 
investment platforms, which were then used to scam victims. The FBI has accused the pair of working with 
unnamed co-conspirators to trick people to invest their crypto through the fake exchanges, which would then show
