The Telegraph (UK). (11/23, Hymas, 956K) reports, "One of Britain's most prolific paedophiles, 
who targeted at least 500 children, would not have been caught under Facebook's proposed 
end-to-end encryption plans, according to the National Crime Agency (NCA)." The Telegraph 
adds, "Appearing at Ipswich Crown Court on Monday, labourer David Nicholas Wilson, 36, 
admitted 96 sex abuse offences against 51 boys aged four to 14, whom he conned into sending 
him sexual images or blackmailed into abusing their younger siblings or friends." The NCA 
"found 250,000 messages communicating with boys in his Facebook, Snapchat, Google and 
Instagram accounts after obtaining access to them through an International Letter of Request 
to the US authorities," but "his...abuse would not have been exposed without Facebook 
providing 90 referrals of suspect accounts linked to Wilson - evidence that would not be 
available if the social media giant goes ahead with its encryption plans, said Rob Jones, the NCA 
director of threat leadership."

President Trump on Monday tweeted, "I want to thank Emily Murphy at GSA for her steadfast 
dedication and loyalty to our Country. She has been harassed, threatened, and abused - and I
