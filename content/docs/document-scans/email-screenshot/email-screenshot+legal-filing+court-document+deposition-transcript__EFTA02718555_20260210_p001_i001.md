I've been waiting to come up with a strong candidate for an EDGE Master =lass on the level of our first such event in 
2007, "A Short Course In =hinking About Thinking" with Daniel Kahneman. 
In fact, I have found it. It is Danny's friend and colleague Philip =etlock, who is prepared to teach "A Short Course In 
Superforecasting". = Edge Master Class 2015 A SHORT COURSE IN SUPERFORECASTING Philip E. Tetlock 
Venue: California (to come); Date: Summer 2015 (to come)

In his Introduction to Tetlock's EDGE piece in 2012, Danny wrote the =ollowing: 
"Philip Tetlock's 2005 book 'Expert Political Judgment: How Good =s It? How Can We Know?' demonstrated that 
accurate long-term political =orecasting is, to a good approximation, impossible. The work was a =andmark in social 
science, and its importance was quickly recognized =nd rewarded in two academic disciplines—political science and 
=sychology. Perhaps more significantly, the work was recognized in the =ntelligence community, which accepted the 
challenge of investing =ignificant resources in a search for improved accuracy. The work is =ngoing, important 
discoveries are being made, and Tetlock gives us a =hance to peek at what is happening. 
"Tetlock's current message is far more positive than his earlier =ismantling of long-term political forecasting. He focuses 
on the near =erm, where accurate prediction is possible to some degree, and he takes =n the task of making political 
predictions as accurate as they can be. =e has successes to report. As he points out in his comments, these =uccesses 
will be destabilizing to many institutions, in ways both =ultiple and profound. With some confidence, we can predict that 
another =andmark of applied social science will soon be reached." 
PHILIP E. TETLOCK is Annenberg University Professor at the University of =ennsylvania (School of Arts and Sciences and 
Wharton School). He is =uthor of Expert Political Judgment: How Good Is It? How Can We Know?; =13-author (with Dan 
Gardner) of Superforecasting: The Art & Science of =redicting (forthcoming, September); Co-leader of The Good 
Judgment =roject.
