Day 9 
Our current position is 17.07 W by 54.48 N. We are sailing in 14 to 18 kno=s of wind, with mizzen, main, and spinnaker 
up, going at a good clip. 
I ended last night with the crew having a cup of tea, under grey skies and =ome rain. Shortly after I sent the note, 
Seumas asked that we bring the s=innaker down, as it looked a little worse. No soon as we had the big sail=on deck to 
be bagged, the wind hit. 
Most sailors I know would say that "things get interesting" when winds are =tronger than 40 knots (about 50 mph). Last 
night we had a big following se=, periods of intense rain, and sustained winds between 30 and 40 knots. F=r the 
occasional sailor, things get interesting when the winds get close t= getting interesting. It was a long night where you 
hold on and let Bequi= do her thing. 
At times Bequia was surfing down waves at speeds of 14 to 15 knots (its in =he Log book), blowing off huge volumes of 
ocean from her bow. Big white w=ves could be seen coming to our stern, and the auto helm groaned trying torkeep 
Bequia straight. 
You do your watch in foul weather gear, a safety harness with an inflatable=life jacket, and if you leave the cockpit, you 
tether yourself in. We sai=ed with a double reefed main and a reefed jib. It is the first time I hav= seen Bequia shoved 
around a bit and sleeping was very hard, no matter how=I tried to pin myself in in the bunk. 
I completed another initiation into ocean sailing. I got hit twice by a fl=ing fish. You don't see them coming, and if they 
hit you straight on, its=like a punch from the dark. 
My second watch ended at 5:00 AM. 
I woke up at 9:30 AM to blue skies and a beautiful white spinnaker flying f=om Bequia's bow. We had passed the 
interesting stuff.
