the Ethiopians. Egypt will also make public =he official report prepared by the international committee of technical 
ex=erts, which shows that the dam will have a negative impact if it is built =ccording to the current planned dimensions. 
"Continuing to fo=low the technical track in negotiations pertaining to the Renaissance Dam =etween Egypt, Sudan and 
Ethiopia will lead nowhere. A political agreement =ust be reached, and an official mechanism established by the senior 
leaders of all three countries, through which di=ect negotiations are held until each country's positions and decisions 
c=n be clearly defined," the source affirmed. 
As the tug of war b=tween the Egyptian and Ethiopian delegations intensified during the first =egotiating session, Sudan 
fully and unreservedly adopted the Ethiopian pos=tion. None of the Sudanese delegation members wanted to comment 
about the meetings, though Sudanese Minister of =ater and Energy Osama Abdallah issued a very brief news statement. 
In it, =e said that an atmosphere of honesty and brotherhood prevailed over the me=tings, while they all tried to find the 
best avenues to move forward. He added that they would meet again=to reconsider the matter. 
The door is still o=en to all possibilities and the upcoming negotiations between Egypt, Sudan=and Ethiopia about the 
Renaissance Dam could either succeed or fail. Avail=ble information, however, seems to indicate that disagreements and 
a lack of confidence still prevail between=the Egyptian and Ethiopian sides, with Sudan joining the latter's camp t= 
safeguard its interests and receive a part of the ensuing benefits. Egypt= on the other hand, has failed to clearly state 
whether it will participate in building the dam, despite the=positive statements issued by the country's political and 
diplomatic lea=ership in this regard.

The Call For Rebellion Agains= Hamas In Gaza 
thud Yaari 
November 8, 2013 -- A new movement known as Tamarod Gaza has chosen Novembe= 11, the ninth anniversary of the 
death of PLO leader Yasser Arafat, as a =ay of mass protests, including strikes and sit-ins, aimed at ending llamas =ule in 
the Gaza Strip. Although many dismiss Tamarod, which coalesced mainly outside Gaza, as having very =imited potential 
to pose a real threat to Hamas, it does constitute the mo=t important domestic challenge ever faced by the Palestinian 
branch of the=Muslim Brotherhood. Hamas indeed takes this threat quite seriously. 
Tamarod Gaza is an obscure movement composed of previously unknown young ac=ivists that was formed this past 
April, aided by Facebook and other social=network platforms. The group emerged in parallel with the Egyptian 
Tamarod=movement, which led the demonstrations that finally helped bring down President Muhammad Morsi. By 
August, encour=ged by the success of their Egyptian counterparts, Tamarod Gaza's founders=-- seen wearing masks in 
video clips -- moved to articulate their demands =nd outlined a course of action. 
Demands On The Gaza Leadership 
Tamarod Gaza's main demands, as presented in different declarations, in=luding a letter to the secretary-general of the 
Arab League, include requi=ing Hamas to immediately allow the formation of an elections committee, &q=ot;without 
any delay or obstacle," to pursue speedy general elections under international Arab and Islamic super=ision. The 
expiration of Tamarod's ultimatum of sorts has been set at sund=wn of November 8. More broadly, the movement has 
issued many statements ch=rging Hamas with neglecting the interests of the Palestinian people, including its 
"constitutional ri=ht of freedom of expression and political organization." The movement=has also denounced the coup
