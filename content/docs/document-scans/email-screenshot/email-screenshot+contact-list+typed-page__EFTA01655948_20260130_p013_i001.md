fallen agents, delivering the keynote address at Tuesday's services. Davis and McDonnell joined to lay a wreath in 
honor of the agents. FBI employees and family members held pictures of agents who died; some laid roses at the 
memorial site. According to the article, more than 102 FBI agents have died in the line of duty nationwide, 
according to agency officials. The agents are memorialized on the FBI's Wall of Honor. The original memorial resides 
at the FBI's Headquarters in Washington DC and smaller memorials are maintained at field offices across the 
country "so that their ultimate sacrifice will always be remembered," according to the law-enforcement 
organization's website. 
What It Takes to Become an FBI Special Agent 
KGW (NBC-8) (05/21, Gordon) reported that the FBI office in Oregon is reaching out to prospective job seekers as it 
looks to fill a wide range of positions, and during a visit to the office ahead of an FBI Career Expo on Thursday. 
According to the article, KGW's Tim Gordon visited the FBI's Portland field office to learn more about job 
opportunities at the FBI, and got some special agent training in the process. Gordon joined Special Agent Ryan 
Phillips at the FBI office's gym to try portions of the physical fitness test required of new agents "It benefits us, and 
I think the public, for us to have a certain level of fitness and to be in shape," Phillips said. "Sometimes you gotta 
chase bad guys." The article quoted Doug Olson, special agent in charge for Oregon, who said, "When we look at a 
problem, we recognize the benefit of having a multidisciplinary approach and different ways of looking at that 
problem and coming up with the best solution." Olson oversees the FBI's work across the state, including high-
profile collaborations with local law enforcement. Those efforts have included investigations into ballot box arsons 
and large drug busts involving fentanyl and other dangerous narcotics. While a hiring freeze is in place for most 
positions, special agent roles remain open. And Olson encouraged anyone interested in an FBI career to stay 
engaged.
