Continued Reporting: Key Senate Republican Thinks Deal in the Offing Over FBI HQ Location Dispute 
Politico (07/15, Tully-McManus) reported that Sen. Jerry Moran hopes to resolve the dispute over the location of a 
new FBI headquarters and bring a key spending bill back up before the full Senate Appropriations Committee as 
soon as Thursday. According to the article, the full panel was thrown into uncertainty last week after Sen. Lisa 
Murkowski (R-AK) joined all Democrats in adopting an amendment from Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) aimed at 
blocking President Donald Trump from diverting FBI money intended for moving the agency headquarters to 
Greenbelt. The article noted that President Trump has sought to unilaterally relocate the agency's campus to 
downtown Washington, D.C. instead. The bipartisan adoption of the Van Hollen amendment derailed the 
committee's planned approval of the larger bill that would fund the Departments of Commerce and Justice, as well 
as the FBI and science programs, for the fiscal year that starts in October. Moran said, "The only administration 
official I've talked to about this is the director of the FBI." Murkowski said in a brief interview Tuesday afternoon 
that she had met with FBI officials and that "we're working with the chairman" to come to an agreement. 
FBI Warns Of New Robbery Trend Targeting Bank Customers

robbery targeting individuals who handle large amounts of cash, often near banks, ATMs, or retail stores. According 
to the article, the FBI offers safety tips to protect yourself, including staying alert, keeping cash out of sight, varying 
your routine, and being cautious if you suspect you're being followed. The article noted that local law enforcement 
and the FBI encourage residents to report suspicious activity around banks or ATMs and to follow the provided 
safety tips to reduce their risk of falling victim to jugging. 
Opinion: Director Patel Reveals 'Vault' Find, Fueling Russiagate Conspiracy Probe 
An opinion piece from The National Desk (07/15, Minnaugh) reported that the FBI, under the direction of Director 
Patel, has made a significant discovery of an evidence room, referred to as a "vault" or "lockbox", which could lead 
to damaging results and further investigations into various scandals, including Russiagate. According to the 
article, Director Patel has been open and honest about the discovery, mentioning it in an interview with Joe Rogan, 
and has also discussed an "overarching conspiracy" probe that examines the political weaponization of law 
enforcement and intelligence agencies. The article noted that the conspiracy probe may involve evidence related to 
Russiagate, which could potentially warrant a grand jury investigation, and has sparked interest among Republicans 
to further investigate scandals such as Russiagate and the Biden family corruption. 
Opinion: Does Director Patel Deserve to Run the FBI? 
An opinion piece from The Guardian (07/15, Mandawi) reported that Director Patel, the director of the FBI, has 
written a children's book trilogy called The Plot Against the King, which promotes conspiracy theories and has a 
storyline that mirrors his devotion to President Trump. According to the article, Director Patel has increased the use 
of lie detector tests in the FBI to screen employees for loyalty, with questions including whether they have been 
rude about him or his deputy. The author criticized Director Patel's leadership and the use of polygraph tests, which 
are notoriously unreliable.
