work." During arguments in the Georgia police officer case, "the justices pushed a Justice 
Department lawyer to explain how a ruling in the government's favor wouldn't open the door to 
prosecutions of innocuous behavior." Cybersecurity experts at the trial "described the CFAA as a 
sword hanging over the head of researchers who probe computers for weaknesses with the goal 
of helping their owners fix the flaws." They wrote, "Under the government's broad interpretation 
of the CFAA...standard security research practices - such as accessing publicly available data in 
a manner beneficial to the public yet prohibited by the owner of the data - can be highly risky." 
UK To Block Carriers From Installing Huawei 5G Gear From September 2021. 
CNET News (11/30, Keane, 1.99M) reports that Huawei "had predicted that 2020 would be 
'difficult' for Huawei, and there certainly have been challenges." For instance, in the UK, Huawei 
equipment "must be removed by 2027 - a decision that Huawei found 'disappointing' as 5G 
becomes increasingly mainstream - and UK carriers will unable to install Huawei gear from 
September 2021." Foreign governments are concerned over Huawei's "coziness with the 
Chinese government and fears that its equipment could be used to spy on other countries and 
companies." The US "banned companies from using Huawei networking equipment in 2012 and 
why the company was added to the US Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and 
Security Entity List in May 2019, following an executive order from President Donald Trump 
effectively banning Huawei from US communications networks. A year later, Trump extended 
the order until 2021."

students would be dismissed beginning at noon because of a potential cybersecurity threat."

Report: Government Should Get Serious About Supply Chain, Cyberbiosecurity. 
Gov Info Security (11/30, McGee) reports on "malicious code that compromises the synthetic 
DNA supply chain and ultimately tricks bioengineers into inadvertently developing dangerous 
viruses or toxins" that could be injected by hackers. According to a new report, 
Cyberbiosecurity: Remote DNA Injection Threat in Synthetic Biology, "that's a growing concern 
and calls for robust security measures." The study, "by security researchers at Ben-Gurion 
University of the Negev in Israel sizes up the cyberthreats facing the emerging synthetic 
bioengineering segment of the healthcare sector." One author wrote, "We have seen the federal 
government get serious about supply chain with their Cybersecurity Maturity Model rolling out 
this year." He added, "That includes more than 300,000 companies in the Department of 
Defense's supply chain - so it can be done to scale." 
Report: Excessive Job Requirements Suppressing Supply Of Cyber Professionals. 
The Wall Street Journal (11/30, Rundle, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) reports that the 
International Information System Security Certification Consortium's (ISC2) November report 
found global employment in the cybersecurity field would need to grow by 89% to fill the roles 
needed. Millions more cybersecurity professionals are needed, but the report found excessive 
requirements are the problem over an insufficient number of workers. For instance, said 
Forrester Inc.'s principal analyst Chase Cunningham, "We've created this self-licking ice-cream 
cone of misery that continues to drive the narrative forward that we don't have the ability to 
solve this problem, or we don't have enough humans."
