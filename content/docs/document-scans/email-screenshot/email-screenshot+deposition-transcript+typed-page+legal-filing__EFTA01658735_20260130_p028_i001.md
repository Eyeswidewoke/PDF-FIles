NYC Schools Seen As Likely To Close Again Amid Resurgence Of COVID. 
The New York Times (11/12, Shapiro, 18.61M) reports New York City's school system - despite 
having coronavirus transmission being "strikingly low, with a positive-test rate of just .17 
percent according to the most recent data, prompting one of the city's top health officials to 
declare that the public schools are among the safest public places around" - is expected to shut 
down by Thanksgiving, if not earlier. The move "would be perhaps the most significant setback 
yet for the city's recovery since the bleak days of spring, when it was a global center of the 
pandemic and all the schools were shuttered." 
Meg Oliver of the CBS Evening NewsVi (11/12, story 2, 1:30, O'Donnell, 4.06M) said New 
York City's COVID positivity rate was at 2.6% on Thursday, "closing in on the 3% threshold that 
would trigger a move to remote learning in all public schools." 
Health Officials Encouraging Extra COVID Precautions For Holidays. 
The Washington Post (11/12, Brulliard, 14.2M) reports the "record-breaking surge in US 
coronavirus cases is being driven to a significant degree by casual occasions that may feel 
deceptively safe, officials and scientists warn - dinner parties, game nights, sleepovers and 
carpools." The White House coronavirus task force "has been urging states that are virus hot 
spots to curtail maskless get-togethers of family and friends, saying in reports that 
asymptomatic attendees 'cause ongoing transmission, frequently infecting multiple people in a 
single gathering." 
On NBC Nightly NewsVi (11/12, story 14, 1:30, Holt, 4.9M), Stephanie Gosk said, "The 
safest thing to do this Thanksgiving, health officials say, is stay home. The reality is a lot of 
people aren't going to stay home." NBC's John Torres said, "By far the safest thing is to not to 
travel, but if you do travel, take those steps you need to take to stay safe. That means wearing 
a mask, social distancing, washing your hands." 
Asked on Fox News' The Story (11/12) about New York City's Thanksgiving restrictions, 
HHS Secretary Azar said, "We've got real practical suggestions" for managing the risks, 
including opening "your window if you can to increase ventilation," turning on ceiling fans, and 
using "single-serving" utensils for food. Azar said, "The most important thing is, even if we 
sacrifice this year for Thanksgiving and Christmas, we want to make sure that everyone in your 
family is available next year for Thanksgiving and Christmas so you can celebrate fully." 
Birx Encourages Mask Wearing To Stem Fall Surge. WFRV-TVVI Green Bay, WI 
(11/12, 16K) reported that White House Coronavirus Task Force Coordinator Deborah Birx 
touted the effectiveness of mask mandates and "said other countries have already had success 
in stemming the tide of the virus when they get aggressive with prevention." Birx said, "Even 
though this fall surge is more rapid, resulting in more hospitalizations, we already have 
countries that are successful in flattening the curve, because they put in a mask mandate, they 
told you not to gather and take your mask off, and they closed bars and restaurants." Birx "is 
asking Americans to hang on for another four to six weeks when it comes to limiting contact." 
Clinical Laboratories Warn COVID Testing May Be Delayed. 
Politico (11/12, Lim, 4.29M) reports the American Clinical Laboratory Association, which 
"represents private labs, including LabCorp and Quest," warned that labs may soon be facing 
processing delays for COVID tests amid the surge of infections nationwide. Quest Diagnostics 
"this week said its average turnaround time for PCR testing is two days, but private labs say 
results will take longer to process once the number of new samples begins to exceed testing 
capacity." Association of Public Health Laboratories CEO Scott Becker said, "Labs are doing 
everything they can to eke out whatever additional capacity they can, but they are limited by 
supplies and in some cases test kits."
