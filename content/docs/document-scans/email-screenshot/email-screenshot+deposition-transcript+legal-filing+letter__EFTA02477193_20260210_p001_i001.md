I heard you wh=n you said you believed i had already been paid for the work that is now required. The art partnership 
has fully answered all your concerns and discharged a=l my obligations and more so.. =C2 ( FYI Carlyns art partn=rship 
that you referenced is similar in only its title. = You will also recall that you required that my payments be at the end 
of=20 my work not at the beginning as everyone else's .( my work was never to=20 include hours upon hours of training 
your staff). I eventually=20 agreed, this of course should make clear that the=C2 2014 tax year that will close Oct

until 7/ 15. you can roll the balance for last year as a=concession. half up front. no more all at the end. ive s=oken to 
brad every day. more questions than answers. joslyn cannot b= left unsupervised. his answers are knee jerk . eillenn
