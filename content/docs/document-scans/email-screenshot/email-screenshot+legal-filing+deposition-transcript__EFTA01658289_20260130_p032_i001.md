the latest state to surpass New York in total COVID cases. And they joined other hot spots, 
such as California and Florida. The virus is also hitting Louisiana hard. That state is now leading 
the country in per-capita cases." 
ABC World News TonightVi (7/30, story 4, 1:50, Muir, 7.06M) reported, "For the virus, no 
end in sight. California, North Carolina, and Florida this week all hitting record daily death tolls. 
Making matters even worse here in Florida, with a tropical storm approaching, statewide, all 
public testing sites are shutting down today through the weekend. During that same four-day 
stretch last week, nearly 350,000 people were tested." 
In New Jersey, the New York Times (7/30, Tully, 18.61M) reports, the number of cases 
"are rising again, fueled in part by outbreaks among young adults along the Jersey Shore." In 
the past seven days, New Jersey has recorded "an average of 416 cases per day, an increase of 
28 percent from the average two weeks earlier." 
The Hill (7/30, Wilson, 2.98M) reports that while the number of new cases in some of the 
states hit hardest in the last month "is easing," public health officials "warn that widespread 
transmission is still taking place, and that a return to normal life is a long way off." In 
interviews with state health officials this week, "most said they remain concerned that the drop 
in new cases may be a plateau at an unacceptably high level of transmission, rather than a 
sustained decline." 
WPost: "No End In Sight To The Casualties." The Washington Post (7/30, 14.2M) 
editorializes, "On May 27, the United States reached a grim milestone. Four months after the 
country's first confirmed case of covid-19, the death toll of the novel coronavirus reached 
100,047 as of 6 p.m. Eastern Time, according to data compiled by the Center for Systems 
Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University." The Post writes, "We hoped the alarming 
loss of so many lives in so short a period of time would galvanize a concerted national effort to 
contain the virus. Instead, two months later, another 50,000 people are dead, and there is no 
end in sight to the casualties." 
In Shift, Administration Officials Now Urging Public To Wear Face Masks. 
The Washington Times (7/30, Sherfinski, Howell, 492K) reports that "top members of the White 
House coronavirus task force now say that face shields and goggles can be effective ways to 
combat the spread of the coronavirus - the latest shift in messaging" from the Administration 
"on the how to contain a pandemic that has now claimed more than 150,000 American lives." 
Appearing on Fox News' Fox & Friends (7/30, 831K), Deborah Birx, Response Coordinator 
of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, said, "Across the South [there is] still a very 
serious pandemic. Although they are starting to see the glimmers of hope of improvement...we 
believe if the governors and mayors of every locality right now would mandate masks for their 
communities and every American would wear a mask and socially distance and not congregate 
in large settings where you can't socially distance or wear a mask that we can really get control 
of the virus and drive down cases as Arizona has done." 
FDA's Hahn Reiterates Guidance On Masks And Distancing. In an appearance on 
NBC's TodayVi (7/30, 2.93M), FDA Commissioner Hahn said, "We've seen some evidence that 
the very common sense public health measures that we can take - wearing a mask, following 
local guidance with respect to wearing a mask, social distancing, hand hygiene, protecting the 
vulnerable - we've seen early evidence that that works. We must take this seriously, and we 
must do that because we absolutely need to reduce the number of cases in the country. 
Because that is what's leading to the deaths that we're seeing." 
Daily Beast: Trump's Revival Of COVID News Conferences Has Frustrated Staff. 
The Daily Beast (7/30, Suebsaeng, 1.39M) reports that when the "early results" of President 
Trump's return to regular news conferences on coronavirus response "suggested that maybe 
Trump could keep a lid - even if just for a few seconds - on his self-destructive impulses, 
increasingly, the worst fears of the president's staff are being realized." One "senior
