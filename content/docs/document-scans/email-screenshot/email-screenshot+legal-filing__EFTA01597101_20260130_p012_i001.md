UBS Client Relationship Agreement 
discretion of UBS. A Plan Participant's eligibility for the Institutional Sweep Funds will be 
determined at the end of each month, based on the greater of the value of the Plan's QP 
Relationship assets and the Plan Participant's Marketing Relationship assets, both as 
determined in the sole discretion of UBS. If the value of a Plan's QP Relationship assets or 
a Plan Participant's Marketing Relationship assets reaches the minimum asset threshold at 
any time other than the end of the month, the Plan or Plan Participant will not be eligible 
for an Institutional Sweep Fund. 
If you are eligible for an Institutional Sweep Fund as either your Sweep Fund or your 
Secondary Sweep Option for one of the Bank Sweep Programs, we will liquidate your 
shares in your current Sweep Fund or your Secondary Sweep Option, as applicable, and 
purchase shares in the Institutional Sweep Fund with the same investment objectives 
without direction from you. Thereafter, your Sweep Fund or Secondary Sweep Option, as 
applicable, will be the Institutional Sweep Fund. Once an Account's Sweep Option or 
Secondary Sweep Option, as applicable, is an Institutional Sweep Fund and a first purchase 
has been made into the Fund, that Institutional Sweep Fund will remain the Account's 
Sweep Option or Secondary Sweep Option even if the Account's Marketing Relationship 
assets cease to meet the minimum asset thresholds for that Institutional Sweep Fund. QP 
Relationship assets as a means to determine eligibility will not be available until on or 
about Dec 2, 2013. 
Check Writing 
Many UBS accounts incorporate a check writing feature. If you choose this feature for your 
account, you authorize us and our Check Provider to honor checks that bear your 
signature(s) and unsigned drafts that are presented on the basis of separate written 
authorization from you to the payee. These checks may be used only in conjunction with 
your accounts and only up to the account's "Withdrawal Limit" as defined in the General 
Terms and Conditions in the Agreements and Disclosures booklet. We will deduct funds 
from your Accounts and reimburse the Check Provider in federal funds when checks or 
drafts are presented to the Check Provider. We may delay or deny payment if there are 
insufficient available assets in your Account to cover payment on the day you write the 
check or authorize the draft through the day on which we deduct funds from your 
accounts to pay the check or draft. 
Bill Payment and Electronic Funds Transfer Services 
Many UBS accounts incorporate the Bill Payment and Electronic Funds Transfer services. If 
you enroll in these services, you authorize UBS and its processing bank to effect the types 
of transactions described in the Bill Payment and Electronic Funds Transfer Service 
Agreement. This service agreement also applies to other electronic transfers to or from 
your Accounts, including transfers made with UBS CashConnect feature and certain 
payments made through the Automated Clearing House ("ACH") system, even if you do 
not enroll in this service. 
"Check Provider" is the provider and 
processor we have appointed to 
handle payment of your checks and 
drafts. We reserve the right to 
change check providers from time to 
time. 
The Bill Payment and Electronic Funds 
Transfer Service Agreement is located 
in the Agreements and Disclosures 
booklet. 
Bill payments are only available to 
payees located in the U.S. 
Transfers through the Aal system 
are onty available to and from 
accounts at financial institutions and 
banks within the U.S.
