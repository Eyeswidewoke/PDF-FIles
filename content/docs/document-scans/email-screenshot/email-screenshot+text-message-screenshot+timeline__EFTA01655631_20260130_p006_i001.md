COUNTERTERRORISM 
John Kerry 'Systematically Derailed' FBI Probe of Iranian Terrorists While Pursuing 
Nuclear Deal 
The New York Post (03/04, Christenson) reported that the Obama administration allegedly "systematically 
derailed" an FBI probe into Iranian terrorists to pursue a nuclear deal with Tehran. According to the 
article, then-Secretary of State John Kerry personally interfered to block arrests, contradicting his sworn 
testimony to Congress. The article noted that the administration's actions included abandoning dozens of 
Iran-related investigations and setting up a "shadow amnesty program" to protect Iranian criminals, 
according to whistleblowers. Newsmax (03/04, Reyner) also reported on the story. 
Jordanian Quantico Breach Suspect Freed Under Biden Arrested Again by ICE 
Fox News (03/04, Ruiz) reported that Hasan Yousef Hamdan, a 32-year-old Jordanian national, has been 
re-arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) after being previously released on bond. 
According to the article, Hamdan and Mohammad Khair Dabous, 28, were initially arrested for allegedly 
trespassing at Marine Corps Base Quantico in May 2024. The men allegedly claimed they were contracted 
drivers for Amazon and were accused of posing as delivery drivers. Military police stopped them at the 
gate, but the driver allegedly ignored them and tried to move into the compound. "A student overstay 
somehow gets in contact with someone illegally crossing into the U.S. on the other side of the country. 
Both of them wind up in that truck," Dave Katz, a former federal firearms instructor who has worked at 
Quantico and is now the CEO of Global Security Group, said. "There is no possible explanation for what 
happened other than a sinister one." Quantico is a Marine Corps base that also houses training facilities 
and a lab for the FBI and Drug Enforcement Administration, which could be potential terror targets, Katz 
said. The article added that the reason for Hamdan's new arrest is unclear, but he and Dabous still face 
immigration proceedings after charges related to the breach were dismissed without prejudice.

COUNTERINTELLIGENCE 
Fired U.S. Government Workers With Top Security Clearances Were Not Given Exit 
Briefings, Sources Say 
Reuters (03/04, Gardner, Landay) reported that some U.S. government workers with top security 
clearances, fired in recent mass layoffs overseen by Elon Musk, were not given standard exit briefings, 
posing a counterintelligence risk. According to the article, the lack of exit briefings means these workers 
were not reminded of non-disclosure agreements and were not instructed on what to do if approached 
by foreign adversaries. The article noted that Kevin Carroll, a former undercover CIA officer, said the 
failure to conduct final briefings for U.S. officials holding top-secret clearances was a "terrible" 
counterintelligence risk. "When you get read off the program, they remind you that you agreed to keep 
information confidential and it would violate the Espionage Act if you don't," he said. The article does not 
contain a direct FBI mention. An opinion piece from The Bulletin (03/04, Walton) assessed that Elon 
Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) poses a counterintelligence disaster due to 
inadequate security standards when accessing sensitive U.S. databases. According to the article, the 
abrupt layoff of hundreds of thousands of US federal civil servants creates a fertile ground for hostile 
foreign intelligence services to recruit disgruntled employees.
