CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS 
Democrats Lodge Complaint Against Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove in 
New York Over Eric Adams Case 
The New York Times (03/04, Bromwich) reported that Senate Democrats on Tuesday asked a New York 
committee that disciplines lawyers to investigate whether the acting deputy attorney general violated 
rules of professional conduct by demanding that prosecutors abandon a corruption case against Mayor 
Eric Adams of New York City. The request, filed by the 10 Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee, 
asked the New York group to determine whether the official, Emil Bove III, "should be subject to 
disciplinary action." According to the article, New York's attorney grievance committees allow lawyers to 
police their own. The committees, which work in private, can recommend disciplinary measures to an 
appeals court, including disbarment in extraordinary cases. The article mentioned that last month, Bove, 
a former criminal defense lawyer for President Trump, ordered Manhattan prosecutors to abandon their 
case against Adams. The order caused upheaval within the Department of Justice, leading to the 
resignation of at least eight prosecutors, including the acting U.S. attorney in Manhattan, Danielle R. 
Sassoon. The article noted that the Democratic senators cited Sassoon's resignation letter as they 
detailed their concerns to an attorney grievance committee in Manhattan, writing that Bove had 
"explicitly premised the dismissal of charges against Mayor Eric L. Adams upon the extraction of a political 
favor." The senators also noted that prosecutors have asked that the case be dismissed without prejudice, 
meaning that they could bring charges anew, calling the arrangement "inherently coercive." Forbes 
(03/04, Durkee), and CNN (03/04, Rabinowitz) also reported on the story. 
California Man Sentenced to Over Four Years in Federal Prison for Hate Crime 
Beating in Culver City 
CBS News (03/04, Rodriguez) reported that a federal judge sentenced a homeless man from California to 
more than four years in prison for a racially motivated attack in 2021. The DOJ said 38-year-old Jesse Allen 
Lindsey, a transient with a last known address in Fontana, pleaded guilty to one hate crime count in 
December 2024. Prosecutors said he was already in state prison on an unrelated conviction when a 
federal grand jury indicted him earlier this year. The attack happened on June 14, 2021, in Culver City. 
Investigators claimed that Lindsey punched the woman in the face after she did not give him a lighter or 
cigarette. The article quoted FBI Assistant Director Akil Davis, who said, "The facts of this case shock the 
conscience. Mr. Lindsey's actions were heinous, despicable, and inhumane." 
Michigan Man Sentenced to Prison for Distributing Child Pornography 
CBS News (03/04, Singleton) reported that a Michigan man was sentenced to 17.5 years in federal prison 
for distributing child pornography online. Ethan Eversman, 25, of Ionia, was accused of requesting explicit 
videos from a 15-year-old in New York and sharing the videos with another person, according to the U.S. 
Attorney's Office. Officials say Eversman was a corrections officer with the Eaton County Sheriffs Office. 
The article quoted Cheyvoryea Gibson, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI in Michigan, who said, "Today's 
sentencing of Ethan Eversman, a former Corrections Deputy, reinforces the FBI's unwavering commitment 
to enforcing the highest standards of integrity in law enforcement. Members from the FBI's Lansing 
Resident Agency, in collaboration with our law enforcement partners at the Michigan State Police, worked 
tirelessly throughout this investigation, in an effort to halt Mr. Eversman's predatory actions. I also want 
to express my gratitude to the U.S. Attorney's Office of the Western District of Michigan for their vital role 
in ensuring this child predator faces justice."
