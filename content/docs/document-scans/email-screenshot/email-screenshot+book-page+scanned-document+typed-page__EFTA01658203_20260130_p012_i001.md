In an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal (7/21, Subscription Publication, 7.57M), Holman Jenkins, 
Jr. asks why the FBI relied on information it knew to be baseless in the Russia probe. He 
reviews recently declassified reports from the FBI, including the memo by former FBI official 
Peter Strzok. He criticizes mainstream media for not being more aggressive in uncovering the 
false information, including its failure to identify the classified annex in IG Horowtiz's report 
describing Comey's actions in linked to the hidden Russian intelligence. 
Steele Text Messages Introduced At Dossier Defamation Trial In UK. 
The Daily Caller (7/21, 716K) reports a defamation trial against Christopher Steele "began in 
London on Monday, with revelations of the ex-spy's efforts to disseminate his infamous dossier 
through the late Sen. John McCain and a longtime ally of the Clintons." A lawyer for a Russian 
businessman suing Steele "read his text messages with Strobe Talbott, the former president of 
Brookings Institution, and with David Kramer, a former State Department official who worked 
with McCain." In another text, Steele "told Sir Andrew Wood, a former British diplomat, that 
McCain was 'compromised' because he was provided a copy of the dossier." Text messages 
"read out during the first day of a defamation trial against Christopher Steele in London on 
Monday revealed new details about how the former British spy strategized with associates on 
how to disseminate the infamous anti-Trump dossier." 
Senators Seek Answers On Expired FISA Programs. 
The Hill (7/21, Rodrigo, 2.98M) reports Sens. Patrick Leahy (D-VT) and Mike Lee (R-UT) on 
Thursday "pressed the Trump Administration on whether and how mass surveillance programs 
authorized by FISA have been halted since the act's expiration." The letter to Attorney General 
Barr and DNI Ratcliffe "raises concerns that the Administration may be continuing to conduct 
surveillance operations by relying on Executive Order 12333." Sens. Leahy and Lee wrote, 
"Congress and the American people have a right to know if this or any other administration is 
spying on people in the US outside of express congressional approval, with no or diminished 
guardrails. The rights of all Americans depend on their government exercising its power 
responsibly, adhering to the rule of law, and upholding its duty to act transparently. Any 
surveillance conducted in the absence of statutory authorities and congressional oversight 
would be extraordinarily concerning and illegal." 
Biden Says Intelligence Community Is Providing Him Information On Election 
Interference. 
CBS News (7/21, 3.68M) 2020 campaign reporter Bo Erickson reports that presidential 
candidate Joe Biden is receiving information about election interference from the intelligence 
community. Joe Biden "says Russia, Iran, and China may be trying to meddle in the upcoming 
US presidential election." He's been "briefed on the subject by the intelligence community." 
Democrats Concerned Russia Targeting Biden. CNN (7/21, Herb, Raju, Cohen, 
83.16M) reports that a request by Democratic leaders for "the FBI to brief lawmakers on foreign 
election interference included concerns about a Russian-linked 'disinformation' campaign to 
target former Vice President Joe Biden in the 2020 election, according to a source familiar with 
the matter." A classified addendum attached to the letter to Director Wray "included concerns 
about a potential Russian campaign targeting Biden, the source said," and the material 
referenced "was included in warnings that the FBI has been offering for months now about 
election interference, another source said." 
Meanwhile, Politico (7/21, Matishak, 4.29M) reports that top Senate Republicans are 
"rejecting" Biden's "amped-up public warnings about Russian interference in this year's 
presidential election, saying foreign adversaries' efforts to meddle in U.S. democracy are 
nothing new after the Kremlin's hacking operation four years ago."
