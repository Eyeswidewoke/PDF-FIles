IN THE NEWS 
Donald Trump Accuses Barack Obama of 'Treason' Over 2016 Election Claims 
The Associated Press (07/22, Tucker, Megerian) and Reuters (07/22, Holland, Spetalnick, Landay) reported that 
President Donald Trump accused former President Barack Obama of "treason" for allegedly trying to tie him to 
Russia and undermine his 2016 presidential campaign. Trump made the accusation without providing evidence, 
and a spokesperson for Obama denounced the claim as "ridiculous and a weak attempt at distraction". An 
assessment by the U.S. intelligence community published in January 2017 concluded that Russia, using social media 
disinformation, hacking, and Russian bot farms, sought to damage Democrat Hillary Clinton's campaign and bolster 
Trump. The assessment determined that the actual impact was likely limited and showed no evidence that 
Moscow's efforts actually changed voting outcomes. A 2020 bipartisan report by the Senate intelligence committee 
had found that Russia used Republican political operative Paul Manafort, the WikiLeaks website, and others to try 
to influence the 2016 election to help Trump's campaign. The Washington Examiner (07/22, O'Keefe) reported that 
President Trump told members of Congress at a reception Tuesday to say former President Obama "cheated on the 
election," if the media do not ask them "appropriate" questions. Trump has been attacking former President 
Obama following intense media attention concerning Trump's relationship with convicted sex trafficker Jeffrey 
Epstein. Additional reporting on the story was provided by Axios (07/22, Habeshian), Al Jazeera (07/22, Staff 
Writer), ABC News (07/22, Forrester) (2), CNN (07/22, Wolf), NBC News (07/22, Alba, Hillyard, et al.), BBC (07/22,

(07/22, Datoc). 
Continued Reporting: DOJ Seeks Meeting With Ghislaine Maxwell Amid Epstein Outrage 
The Associated Press (07/22, Tucker) reported that the DOJ wants to interview Ghislaine Maxwell, Jeffrey Epstein's 
former girlfriend, about potential crimes against victims. Maxwell is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for 
helping Epstein sexually abuse underage girls. The Justice Department's request to interview Maxwell is part of an 
effort to appear transparent and pursue justice in the Epstein case, with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche 
stating that the Dal and FBI will hear what Maxwell has to say if she has information about crimes against victims. 
Additional reporting on the story was provided by Washington Post (07/22, Roebuck, Goba, Jacobs), The Guardian 
(07/22, Olivares), New York Post (07/22, King, Nerozzi), Reuters (07/22, Lynch, Chiacu), Washington Examiner 
(07/22, Rosciglione), The Daily Beast (07/22, Tomazin), and The Times (07/22, Ensor). 
Mike Johnson Shuts Down U.S. House Until September to Prevent Congress from Voting to Release Epstein Files 
The Wall Street Journal (07/22, Li, Gurman) reported that the House of Representatives came to a standstill due to 
disputes over disclosures from the Jeffrey Epstein investigation. Republican leadership cut short the week's session 
and postponed action until September to avoid votes on releasing more Epstein-related material. The decision was 
made to prevent Democrats from forcing votes that could put Republicans in uncomfortable positions regarding the 
disgraced financier and sex offender, Jeffrey Epstein. Additional reporting on the story was provided by Associated 
Press (07/22, Groves, Mascaro), People (07/22, Kile), and Reuters (07/22, Morgan). 
Judge Overseeing DOI Epstein Grand Jury Records Request Asks for More Information 
ABC News (07/22, Mallin, Hill, Charalambous) reported that District Judge Paul Engelmayer plans to rule 
"expeditiously" on the Justice Department's request to unseal grand jury records from Ghislaine Maxwell's case, 
but needs more information. The Justice Department has been given until July 29 to submit a brief outlining their 
justification for seeking the release of the records, including whether they have reviewed grand jury transcripts and 
provided notice to victims. Lawyers for Maxwell and victims in the case will also have the opportunity to review
