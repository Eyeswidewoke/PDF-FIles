WTVT (FOX-13) (10/27, Gay) reported that Hillsborough County Sheriff Chad Chronister stated that six high-level 
officials, including Chief Deputy Anthony Collins, Colonels Christopher Rule and Michael Hannaford, and Captains 
Zuleydis Stearns and Marvin Johnson, have lost their jobs due to an academic cheating scandal. According to the 
article, the scandal involved the officials paying someone to complete coursework for training classes at the FBI 
National Academy, with Chronister saying they "paid with their careers" and can no longer work in law 
enforcement. The article noted that Chronister emphasized that the investigation was not criminal, but rather a 
breach of professional and ethical standards, and that the actions of the few involved do not define the 
professionalism of the entire agency. Additional reporting was provided by Tampa Bay Times (10/27, Sullivan, 
Marrero), Bay News 9 (10/27, Cole, Lewis), WFLA (NBC-8) (10/27, Suter), Tampa Free Press (10/27, Shultz), and 
Hoodline Tampa (10/27, Rodriguez). 
Continued Reporting: NBA at the Mercy of FBI in Gambling Scandal 
News Nation Now (10/27, Taub) reported that ESPN analyst Stephen A. Smith said the NBA is "at the mercy" of FBI 
Director Kash Patel and President Trump's administration following FBI arrests last week tied to a federal gambling 
probe involving over 30 people, including an NBA coach and player. According to the article, Smith defended his 
comments after Director Patel criticized him, saying, "Kash Patel can act like I'm off my rocker... I ain't got time to 
be getting into it with no FBI director," while clarifying that he did not claim the investigation lacked legal standing. 
The article noted that Smith suggested Trump authorized Director Patel to pursue the arrests, arguing the president 
"doesn't forget" past NBA protests and "had no problem inconveniencing" the league, which he believes leans 
against him politically. 
DNA Found on Victim Belongs to "Perpetrator," but Not the Texas Man Serving Twelve Years 
KRIS (NBC-6) (10/27, Jaramillo) reported that Fred Martinez is serving a 12-year sentence for indecently touching a 
child, but DNA evidence found on the victim's clothing does not match his DNA. According to the article, the DNA 
evidence, which includes semen and sperm, has been entered into the FBI's national criminal database as 
belonging to the "putative perpetrator" of the crime, excluding Martinez. The article noted that despite this 
evidence, Martinez's latest habeas corpus petition was recommended for denial by Judge Susan Barclay, with his 
attorneys arguing that key evidence was withheld from Martinez and his attorneys, violating his constitutional 
rights. 
Israeli Official Pleads Not Guilty in Nevada Court 
KLAS (CBS-8) (10/27, Charns) reported that Tom Alexandrovich, an Israeli government official, pleaded not guilty in 
a Las Vegas court to a charge of luring children with the use of technology. According to the article, a grand jury 
indicted Alexandrovich for allegedly chatting online with an FBI decoy posing as a 15-year-old girl about meeting for 
"sexual contact". The article noted that Alexandrovich's trial is scheduled for March, and his attorneys plan to 
challenge parts of the grand jury process. Additional reporting was provided by the Las Vegas Review-
Journal (10/27, Dillon). 
Second Circuit Upholds Keith Raniere Sex Cult Abuse Conviction 
Courthouse News Service (10/27, Stapley) reported that the Second Circuit Court of Appeals upheld NXIVM cult 
leader Keith Raniere's conviction and 120-year prison sentence, rejecting his claims that federal investigators and 
the FBI tampered with digital evidence used to convict him of child sexual exploitation and pornography-related 
racketeering acts. According to the article, Raniere argued that the FBI had planted nude photographs of a 15-year-
old cult member on a computer hard drive, but the appellate panel found he failed to present any newly 
discovered or suppressed evidence and that "ample evidence" already supported the jury's verdict. The article 
noted that U.S. District Judge Nicholas Garaufis had earlier dismissed Raniere's motion for a new trial, and the 
appeals court concluded there was "no real concern that an innocent person may have been convicted," affirming 
that his defense had full access to the forensic material during trial.

including robbery, theft, and terroristic threatening, while Gramajo-Gutierrez is charged with conspiracy to commit 
robbery and theft. The suspects are also being investigated for a bank robbery in Hurlock, but no charges have
