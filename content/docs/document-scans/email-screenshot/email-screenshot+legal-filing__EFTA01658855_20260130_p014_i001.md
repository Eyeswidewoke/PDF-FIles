The Cleveland Plain Dealer (11/30, Tobias, 895K) reports, "The Public Utilities Commission of 
Ohio has begun the process of replacing its former chairman who resigned earlier this month 
after his home was searched by the FBI." The Public Utilities Commission of Ohio Nominating 
Council "announced Monday it is seeking applications for the empty commission spot, vacant 
since former PUCO Chairman Sam Randazzo resigned on Nov. 20. The term, one of five on the 
PUCO, will expire on April 10, 2024. Randazzo resigned the same week the FBI searched his 
Columbus home, and a day after FirstEnergy Corp. revealed in a filing that it fired CEO Chuck 
Jones and two other senior executives last month over a questionable $4 million payment the 
company made in early 2019 to an entity associated with an unnamed person who 
subsequently was hired by the state to regulate utilities." 
AP: Fundraiser Zuberi Exploited US Politicos For Personal Gain. 
The AP (11/30, Suderman, Mustian) that "elite political fundraiser" Imaad Zuberi has "had the 
ear of top Democrats and Republicans alike - a reach that included private meetings with then-
Vice President Joe Biden and VIP access at Donald Trump's inauguration." However, federal 
prosecutors "say Zuberi's life was built on a series of lies and the lucrative enterprise of funding 
American political campaigns and profiting from the resulting influence." He "pleaded guilty last 
year to campaign finance violations, failing to register as a foreign agent and tax evasion," 
among other things. Zuberi "also used his extensive ties to U.S. elected officials to pass on 
potentially useful information to foreign officials, including information related to Biden. He also 
kept in close contact with a West Coast-based CIA officer and bragged to associates of his ties 
to the intelligence community." 
Bank Of America Executive Arrested In Bribery Probe. 
The Charlotte  (NC) Observer (11/30, Weinstein, 470K) reports, "A former New York-based Bank 
of America executive received tens of thousands of dollars at a time in cash bribes, federal 
prosecutors say, in exchange for fraudulently helping a New Jersey firm get a line of credit at 
the bank." Kurt Phelps "was arrested Oct. 29 and charged with bank bribery and conspiracy to 
commit bank fraud. Phelps' arrest is a rare instance of an executive at a major U.S. bank 
arrested for their conduct as a banker. Federal prosecutors accused Phelps of a bribery scheme 
in which he coached Starnet Business Solutions, a Mahwah, N.J. print shop, to falsify financial 
records to get a line of credit from Bank of America in exchange for cash. Phelps pocketed 
hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes over a number of years, prosecutors said." 
FBI Reportedly Probing Members Of Alaska State Senate In Apparent Pay-For-Play 
Scheme. 
In a column for the Alaska Landmine (11/30), Jeff Landfield writes, "Four people have 
confirmed that the FBI is currently investigating members of the Alaska State Senate connected 
to an apparent pay-for-play scheme." Landfield adds, "According to the sources, who are 
connected to the legislature but want to remain anonymous, the scheme seems to involve 
promises of campaign contributions in exchange for votes on the amount of the Permanent 
Fund Dividend, and potentially other issues. I first became aware of an investigation in late 
spring after hearing a senator had been interviewed by the FBI. However, at that time I had no 
other information. I heard another senator was interviewed over the summer. I have now 
confirmed at least three Republican senators have been interviewed by the FBI since spring." 
Hawaii Woman Sentenced For Fraud Conspiracy. 
KGMB-TV Honolulu (11/30, 47K) reports former deputy city prosecutor Katherine Kealoha "was 
sentenced to 13 years behind bars Monday for her role as the mastermind of an elaborate 
conspiracy," which attempted to frame her uncle Gerard Puana. She "has been behind bars 
since her conviction in June 2019 and will begin serving her term immediately."
