campaign on Iran has so far failed...and he dismissed U.S. efforts to restore U.N. sanctions 
against Tehran because Washington had left the 2015 nuclear deal." Macron is quoted as 
saying, "The maximum pressure strategy, which has been under way for several years, has not 
at this stage made it possible to end Iran's destabilizing activities or to ensure that it will not be 
able to acquire nuclear weapons." 
Rouhani: Iran "Not A Bargaining Chip In US Elections." 
The AP (9/22, Batrawy) reports Iranian President Hassan Rouhani "delivered a defiant and fiery 
speech Tuesday to the U.N. General Assembly," and "insisted that it is the US that will surrender 
to the resilience of Iran." Rouhani "spoke in a pre-recorded speech to the virtual summit just 
days after Iran's currency plunged to its lowest levels ever to the U.S. dollar due to crippling US 
sanctions." 
Rouhani, Reuters (9/22, Hafezi) reports, told the General Assembly the US could impose 
"neither negotiations nor war" on Tehran. Iran, he said, "is not a bargaining chip in US elections 
and domestic policy ... Any US administration after the upcoming (US) elections will have no 
choice but to surrender to the resilience of the Iranian nation."

The Washington Free Beacon (9/22, 78K) reports US Navy officials have "announced the

of aircraft carrier USS Nimitz, two guided-missile cruisers, and a destroyer. 
Khalilzad: Afghan Fighting Remains "Too High" Despite Peace Talks. 
Reuters (9/22, Ali, Zengerle) reports Zalmay Khalilzad, the US the Special Representative for 
Afghanistan, testified at a House hearing Tuesday that "the level of violence in Afghanistan is 
unacceptably high and the United States expects further setbacks during talks...as the Afghan 
government and Taliban remained far apart on even basic issues 10 days into talks meant to 
end two decades of war." Khalilzad is quoted as saying, "By any measure, current levels of 
violence are too high. ... We know that reductions are possible." Reuters says the Taliban "has 
refused to agree to a ceasefire and the war grinds on." 
Dispute Over Six Prisoners Nearly Derailed Peace Talks. The New York Times 
(9/22, Gibbons-Neff, Rahim, 18.61M) reports that "when a young Afghan police officer killed 
two American Marines in southern Afghanistan in 2011, he was acting out of his own outrage 
rather than taking orders from the Taliban, according to his family and closest friends." 
Nevertheless, the Taliban "lobbied hard to secure the release of the former officer...even as 
American officials were privately digging in to keep him detained." He became "one of just six 
prisoners - out of 5,000 released by the Afghan government in total - over whom a bitter 
disagreement almost derailed historic peace talks." According to the Times, "Only a last-minute 
deal to remand the six to a kind of house arrest in Qatar allowed the opening of peace talks on 
Sept. 12." 
Pompeo Seeking UN Support To Redefine Human Rights. 
The New York Times (9/22, Verma, 18.61M) reports Secretary of State Pompeo is "trying to 
drum up support at the United Nations for a new vision of human rights that prioritizes religious 
liberty and property rights, but European allies are concerned and showing little support for his 
doctrine, UN diplomats and human rights experts familiar with the matter said." In response to 
European skepticism, "diplomats said State Department representatives had rebranded their 
outreach efforts and would instead ask UN members on Wednesday to affirm their commitment 
to a human rights document passed by the body in 1948 - a core tenet of Mr. Pompeo's 
commission." Still, "UN diplomats and human rights experts said that effort was equally
