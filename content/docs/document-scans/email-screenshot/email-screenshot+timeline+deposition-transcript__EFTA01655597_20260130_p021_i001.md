hour after the FBI's social-media post, the Anchorage School District shared Bryantt's statement on the district's 
immigration policy. "Any immigration official seeking to enter ASD property will be required to present a judicially 
signed warrant," Bryantt said. "This warrant will then be reviewed by ASD's legal counsel to ensure it meets the 
necessary legal standards before any action is taken." The article noted that Anchorage-based immigration attorney 
Margaret Stock said Tuesday that the FBI's involvement in civil immigration action is "a new development," despite 
its traditional involvement in criminal cases. The article indicated that Stock said, "The new Trump directive will 
take FBI personnel away from investigating major crimes and have them instead investigate non-crimes, like 
overstaying a visa, and misdemeanors like entering the country without documentation. So the FBI's mission will 
now include (detaining) people who have lived in Alaska for years and decades and who have deep family ties here. 
This is far from the best use of the FBI's skills and resources." Meghan Barker, a spokeswoman for the American 
Civil Liberties Union of Alaska, said the group is still assessing the FBI's actions in the state. Anchorage Daily News 
(02/04, Boots), Must Read Alaska (02/04, Downing), and Alaska's News Source (02/04, Video) also reported on the 
story. 
Jan. 6 Defendant Says Trump's Blanket Pardon Covers Conspiracy to Kill FBI Agents 
MSNBC (02/04, Rubin) reported that Edward Kelley was charged and convicted in the District of Columbia of 
assaulting law enforcement and other crimes. The article noted that Trump's blanket clemency for Jan. 6 
defendants obviously clears Kelley there. The article noted that however, the Tennessee man was separately 
charged and convicted of the murder conspiracy in his home state, based on evidence that, while awaiting his D.C. 
trial, he planned to murder law enforcement, including FBI agents and employees. The article quoted the DOJ: "The 
proof showed that Kelley developed a 'kill list' of FBI agents and others who participated in the investigation into 
his conduct on Jan. 6 and that Kelley distributed this list — along with videos containing images of certain FBI 
employees identified on the list — to a co-conspirator as part of his 'mission." He was scheduled for sentencing in 
both cases this spring, before Trump issued his clemency order last month. With the D.C. case clearly wiped out by 
Trump's executive action, Kelley's Tennessee case remains pending sentencing. According to the article, he's now 
asking a judge there to vacate his conviction, to dismiss the indictment and to release him immediately from 
custody, citing Trump's granting of "a full, complete and unconditional pardon" to individuals "convicted of offenses 
related to events that occurred at or near the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021." The article outlined that 
Kelley argues that his murder conspiracy case "is unmistakenly 'related to' his charges in Washington, D.C. and 
covered by his Presidential pardon." The article added that the docket in Kelley's case doesn't reflect a response to 
his motion from the court or the Trump DOJ. The Latin Times (02/04, Urban) also reported on the story. 
Continued Reporting: Trump Ally Known for Racist Comments Gets Top State Dept Job 
The Independent News (02/04, AFP) reported that a former Donald Trump aide who once called for "competent 
white men" to be "in charge" and spread conspiracy theories about the 2021 US Capitol assault has been given a 
top State Department post, an official said. According to the article, Darren Beattie, an influential figure in Trump's 
"Make America Great Again" movement and founder of the right-wing "Revolver News" site, has been named 
acting under secretary for public diplomacy and public affairs, a US official said on Tuesday, speaking on condition 
of anonymity. The role is responsible for developing the public image of American diplomacy around the world. The 
article indicated that the appointment has not yet been publicly announced, but Beattie -- who also reportedly has 
ties with white supremacists — said he would be joining the State Department in a letter published on Revolver 
News. The article pointed out that the publication has repeatedly pushed the idea that the FBI spurred on the 
January 6, 2021 assault on the US Capitol by Trump's supporters. The article mentioned that Beattie previously 
worked as a speechwriter for Trump during his first term, but he left the administration in 2018 after US media 
revealed he had attended a conference two years earlier where white supremacists were present. Reuters (02/04, 
Psaledakis, Lewis), MSNBC (02/04, Benen), The Dispatch (02/04, Demas), and Devdiscourse (02/05, Staff Writer) 
also reported on the story. 
Continued Reporting: Prince Andrew Faces Arrest Fears as Calls for FBI Investigation Mount 
The News International (02/04, Staff Writer) reported that Prince Andrew has been warned against taking risk of 
visiting the US amid growing calls for fresh FBI investigation. According to the article, the Duke of York has come 
under fire again after new shocking new claims emerged that he remained in contact with Jeffery Epstein in 2011. 
The article indicated that he is said to be "terrified" to visit the US as fresh FBI probe can be launched into the 
Jeffery Epstein scandal, sources have claimed. The article stated that Andrew is being advised not to visit to
