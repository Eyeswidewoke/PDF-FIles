occurred within the covered period. II an event otherwise 
meeting the definition of a credit event occurs after the end 
of the covered period but before the option expires. the 
option will not be exercised and will expire worthless. 
tl the listing options market determines that a credit 
event has occurred within the covered period for a class of 
credit default options, it will provide a Credit event contain• 
bon to OCC, and the options will be automatically exercised. 
Holders of the exercised options will receive, and writers will 
be obligated to pay, the fixed cash settlement amount. If 
OCC does not receive a credit event confirmation from the 
listing options market before expiration of a series of credit 
default options, the options will expire worthless. 
Credit default options are binary options in that they 
have a specified, all-or•nothing cash settlement amount. 
Credit default options, however, have additional unique 
characteristics. For example, credit default options have no 
exercise  price and cannot be in the money and have no 
intrinsic value. The discussion of these terms in Chapter I 
and/or Chapter II of the booklet is therefore inapplicable to 
credit default options. In addition, a credit default option is 
automatically exercised whenever a credit event occurs 
within the covered period. Credit default options are thus a 
unique style of options and are neither American•style nor 
European•style. 
A credit default basket option is similar to an aggrega-
tion of individual credit default options, each based on one 
or more reference obligations of a different reference entity. 
All of the outstanding debt securities constituting general 
obligations of each reference entity or direct claims on refer-
ence entities (excluding non-recourse debt) in the basket 
may be included in the reference obligations. 
There are two different kinds of credit default basket 
options. A single payout credit default basket option is auto-
matically exercised and pays a specified cash settlement 
amount upon the confirmation of the first credit event to 
occur with respect to a reference obligation of any one of the 
basket's reference entities. It is exercised only once. Once 
exercised, the expiration of the option will be accelerated to 
correspond to the exercise date. A multiple payout credit 
default basket option automatically pays a specified cash 
settlement amount each time a credit event is confirmed with 
respect to a reference obligation of any one of the reference 
entities during the covered period. In the case of either sin-
gle payout or multiple payout credit default basket options. 
the listing options market may specify a different cash settle-
ment amount for different reference entities or may specify 
the same cash settlement amount for each reference entity 
in the basket. The percentage of the total cash settlement 
amount that is attributable to any individual reference entity 
Is referred to as its weight in the basket. Investors should 
note that the options markets on which credit default basket 
options trade may determine "weight" according to their 
own specified rules, and investors should contact the listing 
options market for information about how it determines 
weight. In the case of a multiple payout credit default basket 
option, a cash settlement amount wilt be paid only once with 
respect to any particular reference entity, after which time
