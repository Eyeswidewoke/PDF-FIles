CBS News (03/12, Gray) reported that new FBI technology could help solve the murder of a suburban teenager. The 
14-year-old's mother is still seeking justice six months after her son's death. The article added that Marshawn 
Mitchell was shot and killed leaving a football game at Hillcrest High School last year. The FBI hopes someone who 
recorded the incident last year will upload the video to their website. Marshawn Mitchell's mother said it's been six 
months since her son was murdered, and she's hoping that this technology will bring clarity as to who killed her 
son. Mitchell was shot right in front of his school, Hillcrest High School, in September of last year. The article noted

The Daily Beast (03/12, Rohrlich) reported that the "mastermind" of an international marriage fraud ring that 
prosecutors say arranged at least 600 sham weddings has been sentenced to 22 months in federal prison, the DOJ 
announced Tuesday. The article added that Marcialito Biol Benitez, a Philippine citizen who goes by "Mars," ran the 
illicit business under the guise of a temp agency in offices near the Koreatown section of Los Angeles, according to
