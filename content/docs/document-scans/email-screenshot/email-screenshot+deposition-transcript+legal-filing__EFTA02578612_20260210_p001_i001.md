Re: 
Your response is deeply superficial. The fact of you=wanting to prove a point and not giving up over my wellbeing, 
happiness an= self growth is an extreme act of selfishness and bitterness. You rather h=ld on hate than to forgive and 
help. I'm just starting my life and you=are almost 70, I expected you to be more mature than this. Of course I mad= 
many mistakes, doesn't mean my life should be over. When I say I want=an education I mean it since we've only got one 
life and I don't w=nt to throw it away. If you really cared for me you would want to see me f=ourish and wouldn't expect 
anything in return even though I would have=done anything for you. Screaming in the street was the reaction to your 
ac=ions. If you would have spoken to me in a gentle and caring way instead of=lying and disappearing this wouldn't have 
happened. You know I've =ot no other financial support and you were responsible for me in that sens= so cutting me off 
like you did at this early stage of my life with no saf=ty net is equal of driving me off a cliff. For these reasons I'm not 
b=aming anyone else in my life except from you and your inhumanity. Committi=g mistakes is part of learning, harming 
someone is not.
