Matthews said, "Although not unique, it is rare to see ransomware appear on Linux." Matthews 
added that "while cloud assets can often be reimaged or redeployed to remove threats like 
ransomware, the increase in Linux threats stresses the need for better detection and 
protections against threats that bring down applications, put customer data at risk, and hurt 
business operations."
