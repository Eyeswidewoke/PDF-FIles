Casino Resort, which has been shut down since Sept. 20 because of what it called a `systems 
infrastructure failure,' confirmed Wednesday that its computer systems were the target of an

DHS CIO Describes New Network Incident Response Strategy. 
FedScoop (9/30, Nyczepir) reports DHS is consolidating its "network and security operations 
centers to ensure services remain available when analysts must investigate a cybersecurity 
incident, according to the department's new chief information officer." The resulting network 
operations security center (NOSC) "model represents a shift from traditional cyber incident 
response, where the SOC's goal typically is to take the system offline until the problem can be 
identified and fixed." During an ACT-IAC event Wednesday, CIO Karen Evans said, "It's not just 
consolidation for consolidation's sake," but the "next evolution of providing and managing risk 
to keep the business going while we are then analyzing, being aware of and being able to 
protect our operations." DHS also has a "pretty robust" Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation 
"implementation underway, and those cybersecurity tools will feed data about IT assets and 
access to NOSC's dashboard for display before being sent on to the federal dashboard, Evans 
said."

extend scrutiny of a vendor's governance and technology to Radio Access Networks (RAN)
