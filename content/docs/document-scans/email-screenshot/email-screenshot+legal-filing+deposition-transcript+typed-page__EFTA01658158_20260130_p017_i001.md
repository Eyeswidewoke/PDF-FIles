Analyses: US Losing Key Listening Post With Closure Of Chengdu Consulate. 
Reuters (7/24, Tian, McWilliams) reports that on Friday, the Chinese government "ordered the 
United States to close its consulate in Chengdu in response to a U.S. order for China to shut its 
Houston consulate, where staff packed up belongings watched by jeering protesters amid a 
sharp deterioration in relations between the world's two largest economies." According to 
Reuters, "About 100 Chinese activists gathered at the consulate on Friday, shouting slogans 
denouncing communism and heckling consulate staff." Reuters says that on Thursday, Secretary 
of State Pompeo "said...the [Houston] consulate had been 'a hub of spying and intellectual 
property theft." Reuters also reports that on Friday, "Senior U.S. officials said...espionage 
activity by China's diplomatic missions was occurring all over the country, but its activity out of 
the Houston consulate went well over the line of what was acceptable." 
The AP (7/24, McDonald) reports that the US consulate in Chengdu is "responsible for 
monitoring Tibet and other areas in the southwest inhabited by nonethnic Chinese minorities 
that are considered especially sensitive by Beijing." Bloomberg (7/24, 4.73M) reports that 
"security agents and curious onlookers descended on central Chengdu" on Friday, and "dozens 
of police and army personnel patrolled the street outside the building, checking IDs, searching 
phones and ordering passersby to delete photos and videos of the area." Chinese Foreign 
Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin "told a regular news briefing Friday in Beijing that some 
consulate staff had 'engaged in activities inconsistent with their capacity, interfered in China's 
internal affairs and harmed China's national security interests." In a front-page article, the Wall 
Street Journal (7/24, Al, Wong, Lin, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) reports that the US 
consulate in Chengdu has a staff of almost 200, including 150 Chinese citizens. 
The AP (7/24, McDonald) reports that "also Friday, the U.S. State Department sent out a 
notice warning Americans in China of a 'heightened risk of arbitrary detention." The State 
Department notice says, "U.S. citizens may be subjected to prolonged interrogations and 
extended detention for reasons related to 'state security.' ... Americans may be detained or 
deported for 'sending private electronic messages critical' of the Chinese government, it said." 
According to the AP, "The notice gave no indication of what prompted the warning." 
The New York Times (7/24, Bradsher, Myers, 18.61M) reports that the Communist Party's 
"propaganda outlets struck a nationalistic note on Friday, vowing that Beijing would hold firm in 
the face of mounting pressure from the United States. `The United States has recently stirred 
up troubles in relations with China to the point of hysteria,' said the official Xinhua News 
Agency, in an editorial." The Times also reports that Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Hua 
Chunying claimed Secretary of State Pompeo and others are "launching a new crusade against 
China in a globalized world." 
The Washington Post (7/24, Fifield, 14.2M) reports from Beijing, "While analysts here 
called the retaliation measured, they said there was no end in sight to a conflict that spans 
trade and technology, freedom of the press and religion, students and scientists, human rights 
and the race for a coronavirus vaccine. 'Even though the relationship is worsening, we have not 
yet reached the worst point,' said Cheng Xiaohe, a professor of international relations at 
Renmin University in Beijing." The Post adds, "The bottom, he said, would be measured by two 
things: The closure of embassies in each country or military confrontation, whether intentional 
or accidental." 
Bloomberg (7/24, 4.73M) says, "Beijing's decision will not only oust American diplomats 
from the capital of Sichuan province - a region with a population rivaling Germany - it will close 
a key listening post for developments in neighboring Tibet." According to Bloomberg, "The move 
will probably have a bigger impact than shutting the U.S. consulate in Wuhan, but less than 
closing U.S. missions in the key financial centers of Hong Kong or Shanghai." 
CNBC (7/24, Cheng, 3.62M) reports that Eurasia Group's Michael Hirson pointed out that 
"the consulates in Chengdu and Houston had comparable status." Hirson is quoted as saying, "If
