WPost: Deployment Of Federal Agents Politically Motivated. The Washington Post 
(7/23, 14.2M) editorializes that the announcement this week of the deployment of federal 
agents to additional US cities is an attempt by the President "to reframe the election as about 
anything but his abject failure to contain the most catastrophic public health crisis in a century." 
The Post argues that "by justifying the move in inflammatory partisan terms...he makes clear 
his real agenda" and "it has nothing to do with violent crime, and everything to do with his 
reelection." 
Op-Ed: Trump Right To Send Federal Law Enforcement Workers To Chicago, 
Other Cities. Former Acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Director and 
current Fox News contributor Tom Homan argues in an online Fox News (7/23, 27.59M) (7/23, 
27.59M) op-ed that President Trump's decision to try and reduce violent crime by sending 
federal law enforcement workers to Chicago and some other US cities "will save lives." Homan 
stresses that Trump, who "is sending in highly trained" individuals from the DEA, the FBI and 
some other federal law enforcement organizations, "does not want to prevent lawful peaceful 
protests, which are protected by our Constitution." 
Detroit Officials Would Welcome Federal Help To Combat Gun Crimes. 
The AP (7/23) reports, "The federal government wants to help Detroit fight violent crime, not 
patrol streets in search of protesters, city officials said Thursday." Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan 
"said Detroit hasn't experienced the protest-related violence seen in other cities. He said he and 
police Chief James Craig 'are comfortable' that any agents coming to the city will not be under 
the Department of Homeland Security. 'We haven't had the looting. We haven't had the fires, 
which you've seen in other cities,' the mayor said. 'I've never seen as many illegal guns on the 
streets as we have today. If they want to have more ATF officers dealing with the illegal 
trafficking of guns, that would be a welcome contribution." 
The Detroit Free Press (7/23, Baldas, 1.52M) reports, "The White House says federal 
agents are coming to Detroit in the next few weeks as part of a broader effort to help crime-
ridden cities fight escalating violence," but "it's not about the ongoing Black Lives Matter 
protests, Chief James Craig stressed. It's about a plan that was coordinated months ago to fight 
violent crime. 'There are no Homeland Security agents coming here to man protests,' Craig said 
to the Free Press Thursday. 'They are not here to do anything with protesters. This is not 
Portland. This is not Seattle." Craig "sought to quell rumors that federal agents are coming to 
Detroit to take on anti-police brutality protests in the wake of George Floyd's death in 
Minneapolis. His comments also clarify remarks that the White House posted on its website late 
Wednesday about President Trump's initiative to fight inner city violence." 
Trump To Send Federal Agents To Milwaukee To Combat Violence. 
The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel (7/23, Spicuzza, 632K) reports Milwaukee is "one of five cities 
that will see a surge in federal resources to address violent crime in coming weeks, President 
Donald Trump announced this week." The deployment "will coincide with Milwaukee hosting a 
scaled-back, mostly virtual Democratic National Convention and ongoing protests against police 
brutality and racism." 
Cleveland Officials To Address Federal Intervention. 
The Cleveland Plain Dealer (7/23, Astolfi, 895K) reports, "Cleveland Mayor Frank Jackson will 
hold a Friday press conference to address a decision by President Donald Trump to send federal 
law enforcement agents into the city of Cleveland to combat crime." Jackson "will hold the 
conference at 11:30 a.m., along with Cleveland Police Chief Calvin Williams, and Safety Director 
Karrie Howard. The mayor made the announcement one day after the Trump administration 
said Cleveland would be among a handful of U.S. cities that will see a surge in federal agents as 
part of an expansion of 'Operation LeGend,' a program the White House said is intended to 
'restore safety and peace in U.S. cities.' Other cities include Detroit, Milwaukee, Chicago,
