at the airport. 
VOLUNTARY CHANGES 
Although most itineraries ticketed by CheapOair allow for changes, the majority of these itinerary changes require 
the issuance of a new ticket, as per airline policy. All changes are subject to availability, airline rules and 
regulations, penalties and a difference from the original airfare and our service fees. The airline has the final 
authority regarding itinerary changes and penalties. 
INVOLUNTARY CHANGES (CHANGES DONE DIRECTLY BY THE AIRLINE) 
Airlines may make changes to a scheduled flight itinerary that is beyond our control. In these cases, if the airline 
notifies us with a viable option, we will send you an e-mail with the changes as well as the option the airline is 
offering. If the airline does not provide us with a viable option, as a valued customer, your reservation will be 
reviewed and assisted by one of our Schedule Change Specialists.
