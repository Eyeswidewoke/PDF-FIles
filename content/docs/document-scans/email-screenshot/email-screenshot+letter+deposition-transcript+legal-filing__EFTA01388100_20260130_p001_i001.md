Subject: Mexico - NAFTA euphoria? 
The last month has been good for the peso. In a time of fairly broad based EMFX nausea it has held 
in well and the last few days really gained ground on a TWI basis. Increasingly positive body 
language from Lighthizer and Ross on NAFTA progress as well as the exemption of Mexico and 
Canada from the steel and aluminum tariffs were the main impetus for the move. An article from 
Inside Trade (yes it is a real publication) on Monday indicating a breakthrough was likely this week 
prompted a more extended break of 18.50 and the 200dma lurking below. RM risk addition (visible in 
MBONOs over the last week as well) was a key driver of the move flow-wise. Is this a bit too much to 
hope for or are we finally going to get the MXN rally for which we have been waiting? 
Our trade consultants (and reality itself) cast a pall on the chances of a real NAFTA "agreement in 
principle" any time in the next few weeks. There is another round of talks scheduled for 12 April and 
given recent flexibility from the US around rules-of-origin, the chances are good that a number of 
chapters could be closed. Investor dispute resolution remains an open question and an important one 
for Canada. But is hope a good enough reason to own the peso? Let's remember who is sitting in the 
White House. If China gives ground on trade, will NAFTA need some tough love? 
Ultimately it is hard to logically expect major progress on NAFTA before the next round. But the type 
of strong hands that have been buying the peso suggest to me that it will not turn quickly either. 
Signing a deal into law before Mexican elections is basically impossible and AMLO is real holistic risk. 
But the chances of a NAFTA dissolution have dramatically decreased as its main detractor has gone 
mostly silent / positive. The beginning of proper election season (with its 48 minutes a day of 
mandatory political commercials) is a bigger risk than trade disappointment. Not chasing the MXN 
here but would see bounces back towards 18.60 as opportunities to add. TIIE has lagged the MXN 
and MBONO rally after leading it before. Still prefer 5y5y receivers there.
