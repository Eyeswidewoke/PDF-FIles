Trump: Protesters Would Have Burned Down Courthouse Without Federal 
Intervention. 
Asked in an interview with Axios on HBOVI (8/3) about the federal response to protesters in 
Portland, President Trump said, "For 59 days, these people were anarchists and agitators and 
some protesters. But these were anarchists. These people were beating the hell out of the city. 
They were beating up our federal buildings and federal courthouse. We told the police to stop it. 
And the police wouldn't do it. ... If we didn't have people at our courthouse - and they're 
strong, tough people and they don't want - they try and be very good. believe me. But if we 
didn't have people there, you would have your federal courthouse, $600 million building, you 
would have that thing burned to the ground right now."

Chuck Lovell writes in the New York Times (8/3, 18.61M) that "Portland is a beautiful and 
vibrant city with smart, progressive people, and I am hopeful we can come together to move 
beyond the unrest and refocus on critical issues." The Portland Police, he adds, "remains 
committed to protecting life and responding to events as appropriate. I am proud of our efforts 
in extreme circumstances few in the country have faced." Lovell adds, "I have confidence in our 
community and the people who have dedicated their lives to building relationships with police. 
They have stood up and said no more violence. I stand with them with a servant's heart, 
committed to being leaders in police reform." 
McGurn Credits Trump With Reduction In Violence. Wall Street Journal (8/3, 
Subscription Publication, 7.57M) columnist William McGurn writes in a piece titled "Trump Wins 
In Portland" that the reduction in violence in Portland over the weekend is not because - as 
some have claimed - federal agents left the city. McGurn argues the violence has reduced 
because state and local police have stepped up under a deal reached with federal officials last 
week. 
House Panel Launches Investigation Into DHS Intel Office. 
Reuters (8/3, Chiacu, Hosenball) reports the House Intelligence Committee launched an 
investigation on Monday into "the Department of Homeland Security's intelligence office, 
including its actions in Portland, Oregon, and its involvement in other anti-racism protests 
across the country." In a letter to top DHS officials, Chairman Adam Schiff wrote, "The reporting 
regarding the monitoring of peaceful protesters, creating and disseminating intelligence reports 
about journalists and protesters, and potential exploitation of electronic devices is deeply 
troubling." In his letter, Schiff "requested detailed intelligence reporting documents that 
informed a recommendation by the then-chief of the DHS intelligence operation on July 25 
requesting that DHS reports on anarchist-related Portland protesters refer to them as 'Violent 
Antifa Anarchists Inspired." 
Morgenstern: Democrats' Push To Defund Police Will Make Nation Less Safe. 
Deputy White House Communications Director Brian Morgenstern said on the John Fredericks 
ShowVi (8/3), "People want their communities to be peaceful and we're seeing around the 
country that is not the case and how does Joe Biden and his party respond? It is defund the 
police. It is take away the force that is going to help people to feel safe and be safe? ... This 
whole debate over whether redirecting money from the police is the same thing as defunding 
the police, it sort of makes your brain hurt doesn't it? If you are redirecting your salary out of 
your pocket, I think you would call that defunding wouldn't you?"
