the fact-check."

removed from public view because of their evil histories...Sanger must join that list." Noting

Georgia Man Sentenced For Planning White House Attack. 
The Gainesville (GA) Times (7/23, 81K) reports Hasher Jallal Taheb, who "pleaded guilty to 
attempted destruction of government property by fire or explosive," was "sentenced Thursday 
in U.S. District Court" to 15 years in prison. He was "arrested on Jan. 16, 2019, during a 
meeting with undercover FBI special agents at a store in Buford where he expected to obtain 
semi-automatic assault rifles, explosive devices and an anti-tank weapon." 
The AP (7/23) reports that, according to federal prosecutors, Taheb "had made clear that 
his 'goal in acquiring numerous weapons and explosives to attack the White House was to 'do 
as much damage as possible,' to become a 'martyr,' to fight to the end and make a big bang, to 
enter the White House and take down as many people as possible." 
The Forsyth (GA) News (7/23, 40K) reports that the FBI investigation "found that Taheb 
had applied for a U.S. passport three months later, in June 2018, and that he wanted to 
participate in 'jihad' by attacking prominent U.S. monuments, first the White House and Statue 
of Liberty and later others in the Washington area, including the Washington Monument, Lincoln 
Memorial and a synagogue."
