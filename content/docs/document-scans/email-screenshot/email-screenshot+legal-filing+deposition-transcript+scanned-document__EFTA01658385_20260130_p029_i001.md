The Washington Times (8/27, Munoz, 492K) reports House Speaker Pelosi on Thursday said 
that if Joe Biden wins in November, House Democrats will request President Trump's tax returns 
from the new Administration. 
Politico (8/27, Faler, 4.29M) reports Pelosi "said Thursday that if Democrats take the 
White House in November, they will unilaterally release" Trump's tax returns. Pelosi told 
reporters, "When we win this election, and we have a new president of the United States in 
January, and we have a new secretary of the Treasury, and Richie Neal asks for the President's 
returns, then the world will see what the President has been hiding all of this time." 
US Detaining More Migrant Children In Hotels. 
The AP (8/27, Merchant, Sanon) reports the Administration has "sharply increased its use of 
hotels to detain immigrant children as young as 1 before expelling them from the United States 
during the coronavirus pandemic." Federal authorities said "detained 577 unaccompanied 
children in hotels through the end of July, up from 240 in April, May and June, according to a 
report published late Wednesday from a court-appointed monitor for detained immigrant 
youth." 
New Unemployment Claims Down Slightly To 1.006M. 
Reuters (8/27, Mutikani) reports on Thursday the Labor Department reported that "initial claims 
for state unemployment benefits fell 98,000 to a seasonally adjusted 1.006 million for the week 
ended Aug. 22." That was in line with economists polled by Reuters who estimated 1.0 million 
claims. The Wall Street Journal (8/27, Chaney, Kiernan, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) also 
reports claims declined but remained high compared to pre-pandemic claims of around 
200,000. The Commerce Department reported that Q2 GDP fell at a 31.7% annualized rate, 
lower than the 32.9% earlier reported. 
USA Today (8/27, Jones, 10.31M) says "out-of-work Americans continued to seek 
assistance last week, as the economy remained in limbo amid spikes in coronavirus cases," and 
adds "that latest surge means just over 58 million have sought aid for the first time in just 23 
weeks." The AP (8/27, Wiseman), meanwhile, casts the numbers as "a sign that the coronavirus 
outbreak continues to threaten jobs even as the housing market, auto sales and other 
segments of the economy rebound from a springtime collapse." The New York Times (8/27, 
Casselman, 18.61M) quotes Julia Pollak, a labor economist at the employment site ZipRecruiter, 
as saying, "It's devastating how stubbornly high initial claims are. ... There are still huge 
numbers of layoffs taking place." 
The AP (8/27, Wiseman) also reports, "Home sales are booming. Stocks are setting record 
highs. Industrial production is clambering out of the ditch it fell into early this year. And yet the 
economy is nowhere close to regaining the health it achieved...before the coronavirus paralyzed 
the country in March." 
Meadows, Pelosi Resume Talks, But Chances For Aid Deal Remain Slim. 
The AP (8/27, Mascaro) reports Chief of Staff Meadows and House Speaker Pelosi resumed 
talks Thursday over a coronavirus aid package, but "the outlook for any swift resolution 
appeared bleak as President Donald Trump's team and congressional Democrats have been 
unable to agree on a compromise." Pelosi told reporters she told Meadows that Democrats 
would "meet them in the middle" at $2.2 trillion, which is "a slight reduction from her last 
proposal before talks collapsed earlier this month. The White House, which has stuck with its 
initial $1 trillion offer, had no immediate response." 
The Washington Times (8/27, Munoz, 492K) says Pelosi "doubled down on her insistence 
that White House negotiators move their top-line numbers if there's going to be any hope of 
reaching a comprehensive COVID-19 relief deal." Reuters (8/27, Morgan, Heavey) reports that 
before the call with Meadows, Pelosi "said the White House must agree to spend more money
