Italy's bad bank(s): not enough, but it 
helps 
This is a summary of the Special Report on Italian banks - 'State guarantee on 
NPL securitization: not enough, but it helps' published on 02 February 2016. 
:tali:: bad bank scheme 
Last week, after a year-long negotiation, the Italian government reached an 
agreement with the European Commission on a bad bank scheme that does 
not infringe state aid rules. According to the Italian Finance Minister there will 
be no impact on Italy's large public debt. The final scheme is centered on a 
state guarantee applied to the securitization of non-performing loans (NPL). 
The Italian acronym of the scheme is GACS. 
The main technicalities 
GACS is a tool that banks and NPL buyers can use to reduce the funding costs 
of an NPL securitization. Each bank can transfer some of its NPLs to a bank 
specific vehicle, obtain a rating from one of the ECB recognized agencies, buy 
the GACS guarantee on the senior notes, and then sell the equity/junior notes 
to deconsolidate the vehicle (improving its balance sheet quality). 
While the natural buyers of equity/junior notes will be private equity investors 
or hedge funds, the GACS guaranteed senior notes could be offered to a wider 
spectrum of investors, or they could be repurchased by the selling bank 
(especially if GACS guaranteed senior notes are eligible assets to obtain 
funding from the ECB). The cost of the GACS will be based on the CDS of 
Italian issuers (financial and non-financial entities with an underlying level of 
risk in line with the rating of the senior notes). The cost will increase over time, 
creating an incentive to accelerate the NPL recoveries. We calculate a cost of 
c.90bps for the first three years, moving up to c.120bps from the fourth year. 
What could be the impact o€ the GADS on the NFL market,
All in all, the GACS reduces the funding cost of the NPL securitization. 
However, we estimate the GACS benefit to be modest, increasing NPL prices 
of 3-5%. This does not seem enough to close the gap between NPLs' current 
market pricing and carrying value in banks' books (>20ppt on average). 
We think that banks will tend to sell only a part of their NPL portfolios (of 
higher quality/more covered). The process will be gradual. In this way, banks 
will be able to limit or avoid losses. 
Overall, the scheme is a marginal help but it does not represent a final solution 
to the EUR 200bn (-12% of GDP) NPL problem of the Italian banking system. 
Macro Implication of the GAGS: a marginal help 
From a macro perspective the GACS is unlikely to change lending dynamics, 
although it could be part of the solution. The GACS scheme, an effective 
implementation of last summer's bankruptcy reform which reduces foreclosure 
times (Figure 1) and additional measures for easier collateral repossession 
could have a more visible macro impact. 
On a less positive note, rising concerns about Italian banks could hinder the 
credit recovery (Figure 2) - see also Special Report "You cannot ignore Italy" 
from 22 January. We believe these concerns are overstated.
