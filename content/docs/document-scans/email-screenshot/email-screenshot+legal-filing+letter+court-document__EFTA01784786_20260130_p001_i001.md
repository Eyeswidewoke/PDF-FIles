DEAR FRIEND

Muhammad Ali stands over fallen challenger Sonny Liston after dropping him with a short hard right to the jaw on May 
25, 1965, in Lewiston, Maine. 
Like friends and fans around the world I was extremely sadden when on Friday night my cell phone begin to blow up 
with text messages from friends telling me that my old friend 'Muhammad Ali *had just died. As someone who had 
been a fan since his winning a gold medal at the *1960 Rome Olympics*, so much so that my father took me to my first 
live fight in March 1963 when a young 'Cassius Clay* defeated *Doug Jones' in a ten-round decision after being 
knocked down several times to my chagrin at the legendary '(Mecca of 
Boxing)* •Madison Square Garden* that *Ring Magazine* selected as its =80 *Fight of the Year" in 1963. Prior to that 
my hero did a cameo role in o=e of my favorite feature films of all time, •'Requiem for a Heavyweight =80,• starring 
Anthony Quinn, Jackie Gleason and Mickey Rooney in 1962. 
I first met my hero whom at the time my father and others called •"=he Louisville Lip",' during a promotion of one of his 
two spoken words=albums at a record store on a 125 Street in Harlem in 1964. And I only started to get to know him 
when I helped my old friend John Daily along with the R&B singer Lloyd Price put together the close circuit television 
deal for the "Rumble in the Jungle" fight in 1974 when he defeated the then heavyweight champion George Foreman 
in Kinshasa, Zaire. But it was through my friendship with Jeremiah Shabazz (from the Nation of Islam) that I entered into 
Muhammad Afi's inner-circle orbit of friends. And although I =as able to get Muhammad Ali to support Philadelphia 
International Records' =9CClean Up The Ghetto" *campaign in the last 1970s, our relationship was ce=ented when I put 
together the *W.O.R.L.D. Foundation* which had he accepted would have given him financial security for the rest of his 
life as well as a global humanitarian platform. 
Almost everybody who has ever met Muhammad Ali has been touch in one way or another and one of my favorite 
moments was when he showed up unannounced one early morning at my apartment in New York saying that he heard 
that my mother was in the hospital and we went together with his driver to Yonkers, NY where he spent the entire 
morning entertaining my 80 year-old mother, other patients and hospital staff with his magic tricks until his handlers 
finally tracked us down and demanded that he come back to the city to fulfill his scheduled obligations. Another fond 
memory was when one year in the 1980s after extreme lobbing, Ali put together a birthday party for me in London that I 
didn't make because I had other party at my hom= with
