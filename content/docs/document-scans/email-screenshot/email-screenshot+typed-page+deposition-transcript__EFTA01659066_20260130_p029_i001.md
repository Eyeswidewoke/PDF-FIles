The AP (10/21, Neumeister) reports that E. Jean Carroll, "who has accused President Donald 
Trump of raping her in the 1990s," said she "was stunned and speechless after the Justice 
Department on Wednesday turned down an opportunity to make oral arguments on whether 
Trump can substitute the United States for himself as the defendant in her defamation lawsuit." 
DOJ attorney William Lane told US District Judge Lewis Kaplan that "the government would rest 
on its papers, meaning it would rely solely on already submitted written arguments." Carroll 
attorney Roberta Kaplan "said it was a `shocking scenario for the government to just, 
essentially surrender, and not even try to argue the case." 
USA Today (10/21, 10.31M) reports Judge Kaplan "abruptly adjourned" the Wednesday 
hearing "after the government lawyer tapped to argue a key issue was denied access to the 
New York courthouse because of coronavirus restrictions imposed by the state." The judge "had 
offered the government the options of substituting another approved lawyer, arguing the case 
remotely or foregoing arguments in favor of the written submissions. Justice chose the latter, 
and Kaplan ended the hearing, denying a request by Carroll's lawyer to submit additional 
arguments in writing." Reuters (10/21, Stempel) also reports. 
USA Today (10/21, 10.31M) has a detailed look at the "19 women [who] have accused 
Trump of sexual misconduct," writing that 13 of them "said he kissed them without consent, 
often out of the blue, sometimes holding them firmly in place," and that there are women 
beyond the 19 who "have alleged other inappropriate behavior of a sexual nature from Trump." 
The Boston Globe (10/21, 972K) has a piece on Trump's "habit of bashing women who 
challenge him." 
Pelosi: Trump's Chinese Bank Account Is A "National Security Issue." 
Reuters (10/21) reports House Speaker Pelosi made the case on Wednesday that the existence 
of a Chinese bank account belong in to President Trump "raises serious national security 
concerns...following a New York Times report revealing the previously undisclosed account." 
According to Reuters, Pelosi "cited the Chinese government's ties to its financial industry and 
said Trump's banking there risked his exposure and opened him up to vulnerabilities. `They can 
watch the flow of money there and perhaps have some, shall we say, sway over the person 
who's taking money or putting money into that account so it is a national security issue,' she 
told MSNBC in an interview." 
Morgan Touts Administration's Border Policies. 
Acting CBP Commissioner Morgan said on KABC-AMVi Los Angeles (10/21, 6K), "The successes 
that we have achieved, and we have achieved a lot on the immigration front, is directly related 
to this President and this Administration giving us the tools and the network of initiatives and 
policies we need to address the threat." Morgan said, "MPP...that policy, that initiative alone, 
where we got Mexico to join us as true partners, was one of the cornerstones to change and 
end catch and release. One of the biggest pull factors. They knew that if they made it to our 
borders, we were releasing them. That has ended completely and it's because of this 
Administration." 
Pham: Operation Rise Focused On "Dangerous Aliens," Local Partnerships. 
Acting ICE Director Pham said on Philadelphia's Morning Answer (10/21), "What ICE and my 
organization are doing right now is we're focusing on these dangerous aliens with criminal 
records or criminal charges...and I don't think a lot of localities truly appreciate, or their 
leadership truly appreciate, that that's what my organization is focusing on. So our Operation 
Rise, Phase One and Two...we're there to remind them that, as a federal law enforcement 
agency, we're here to partner with them. We're here to show them exactly who we're looking 
for, to combat the narrative that we're out there doing what they would like to characterize as 
raids and sweeps, and that's not accurate."
