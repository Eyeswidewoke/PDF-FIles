Watch sued Schiff and his committee in December "seeking access to 'the controversial 
subpoenas issued for phone records,' including those of Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani." However, 
Howell ruled the watchdog group "has no right to demand disclosure of the requested 
subpoenas and responses thereto issued by HPSIC in connection with the impeachment inquiry 
of the President, and the Speech or Debate Clause of the Constitution provides immunity from 
suit to defendants." Judicial Watch "is considering an appeal." 
Trump Signs Another Executive Order Restricting H1B Visas. 
The Daily Caller (8/3, Datoc, 716K) reports President Trump signed an executive order Monday 
that "seeks to prioritize federal agencies hiring US citizens and green card holders over foreign 
workers for high-skilled contract work." The Hiring American order "limits federal agencies' 
abilities to hire temporary foreign workers for high-skilled contract work and specifically 
prevents agencies from firing and replacing citizens and permanent residents with temporary 
workers in IT contract positions." 
Breitbart (8/3, Munro, 673K) quotes Trump as saying at the White House signing event, 
"We believe jobs must be offered to American workers first." Reagan McCarthy writes for 
Townhall (8/3, 177K) that the order "mirrors President Trump's commitment to putting 
American workers first, especially given the economic downturn caused by COVID-19 that is felt 
by Americans in all job sectors." 
Federal Judge Blocks DOL Rule Restricting Paid Sick Leave. 
Reuters (8/3, Stempel) reports that on Monday, US District Judge Paul Oetken in Manhattan 
"voided parts of a Trump administration rule that restricted paid sick leave and emergency 
family leave for potentially millions of workers affected by the coronavirus." Oetken, "ruling in a 
case brought by New York Attorney General Letitia James...said the Department of Labor 
overstepped its authority in denying eligibility for benefits to several groups of workers." Oetken 
"struck down a provision in the rule letting some employers deny paid sick leave if the 
economic downturn resulted in their having no work available for affected employees." 
Isaias Regains Hurricane Strength As It Makes Landfall In North Carolina. 
All three network news broadcasts Monday evening led with Isaias, which made landfall around 
11:10 p.m. Eastern time near Ocean Isle Beach, North Carolina, according to the National 
Hurricane Center. NBC Nightly NewsVi (8/3, lead story, 2:05, Holt, 6.23M) opened its 
broadcast, "As we come on the air, more than 100 million Americans are staring down a fast 
moving tropical storm. Isaias on the verge of becoming a hurricane as it tracks toward the 
Carolinas. But the entire East Coast northward is at risk from flooding and power outages from 
70 miles per hour winds." 
The CBS Evening NewsVi (8/3, lead story, 3:20, O'Donnell, 4.24M) reported, "The storm 
is expected to make landfall around Myrtle Beach in a few hours as a Category 1 hurricane 
before ripping up the East Coast [Tuesday), bringing with it as much as six inches of rain, 
flooding, power outages, and damaging winds. ... If that isn't enough, the storm is slamming 
into some of the areas in the south that are hardest hit by coronavirus. North Carolina has 
already shut down some testing centers, and the governor is warning those who need to leave 
the coast to avoid staying in shelters to prevent the spread of the virus." 
ABC World News TonightVi (8/3, lead story, 2:35, Muir, 7.08M) reported Isaias "could stay 
at or near tropical storm strength all the way to New England. ... The storm surge is expected 
to be three to five feet and this storm will hit at just about the same time as high tide. It is also 
a full moon tonight, so, that means a higher than normal tide and the potential for significant 
flash flooding."
