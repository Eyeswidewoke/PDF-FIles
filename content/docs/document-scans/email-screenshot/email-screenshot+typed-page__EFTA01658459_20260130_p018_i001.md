Chinese owner ByteDance will be a technically complex endeavor that could test the patience of 
President Donald Trump's administration, according to sources familiar with the setup." Trump 
has given Microsoft "until Sept. 15 to put together a blueprint for an acquisition that 
safeguards" Americans' data and has "issued an order to ban it if there is no deal by then."

technologically from ByteDance after they agree to a deal, Reuters reported on Aug. 2." The 
clean break that "Trump and lawmakers envision could take a year or more, some of the 
sources said." To ensure uninterrupted service, "Microsoft would likely need to rely on 
ByteDance's code while it reviews and revises the code, and moves to a new back-end 
infrastructure to serve users, according to cyber security expert Ryan Speers at River Loop 
Security."
