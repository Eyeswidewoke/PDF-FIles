Yesterday I interviewed Sergio Cordero (modeling agent and business partner of Jean Luc Brunel who also 
past association with JEpstein). 
1. Cordero confirmed that Brunel uses MC2 as a legitimate transport agency of underage girls into America 
sex. 
2. Brunel uses MC2 to introduce underage girls to Epstein since Epstein gave him $1 million dollars to start 
he was fired from various modeling agencies in Paris (his hometown). 
3. Cordero and Brunel are in the same business. 
4. Cordero is more focused towards production (TV) side of modeling unlike Brunel. 
5. Brunel and Cordero have a joint business venture. According to Cordero they are currently in a legal dispute in Miami, 
Fla., over control of business. 
6. According to Cordero, Brunel has always been Epstein's principal supplier of underage girls using MC2 as a cover up 
7. MC2 is also a legitimate business in that it transports some underage models for hire and contracts them out to other 
sources for fees. 
8. Many of the underage girls that Brunel and Epstein shared and liked continue to live in Brunel's 1 bedroom apt in NY. 
some live in Epstein's East 66 St apts in Manhattan. There are some underage girls living there now. 
9. The principal business of MC2 (Based in South Beach where Brunel now resides), is to transport underage girls for 
purposes of sexual pleasure for Brunel and Epstein according to various sources interviewed including Cordero. 
10. Cordero confirmed that former President Clinton was on Epstein's plane with Brunel several times with underage girls. 
OBVIOUSLY THIS IS HEAR SAY SINCE HE ALSO MENTIONED THAT HE WAS NOT THERE. Cordero stated that Brunel 
told him this information. 
knows and had 
for purposes of 
up MC2 after 
11. Cordero confirmed that Brunel and Epstein travel the world to source underage victims for purposes of sex and lure 
them with modeling contracts and the possibility of a better and wealthier lifestyle. 
As an aside Epstein's HOUSE MANAGER ALFREDO RODRIGUEZ was ARRESTED FOR OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE 
on 11/09 -for attempting to sell notebook (the golden nugget), to an undercover agent for $50K. That notebook contained 
and confirmed all allegations and had photos, emails and notes outlining Epstein and Brunel's sex trafficking scheme. 
Please, I would like to speak with agent working Epstein's case since we share the same goal i.e. bringing to light issue of 
sex child traffickers in America and more importantly, bringing them to justice. 
As you know unless I am physically stopped from writing this book and producing documentary a great deal of information 
will be exposed (all corroborated by various sources), of how the underworld and modeling agencies operate and make 
money from child sex trafficking in America. 
We all agree that these are important criminal issues. Given the powerful parties behind the scenes and the fact that our 
own children in this country are suddenly at stake, the issue becomes one of national security.
