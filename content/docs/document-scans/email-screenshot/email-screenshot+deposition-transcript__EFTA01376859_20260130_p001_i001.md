hazardous substances released on. about, under or in its property. Additionally, to the extent real estate investments are made in foreign countries, such countries may prove to be politically or 
economically unstable. Finally, exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates may affect the value of a real estate investment. 
Commodities— The risk of loss in trading commodities can be substantial. The price of commodities (e.g., raw industrial materials such as gold, copper and aluminum) may be subject to 
substantial fluctuations over short periods of time and may be affected by unpredicted international monetary and political policies. Valuations of commodities may be susceptible to such adverse 
global economic, political or regulatory developments. Prospective investors must independently assess the appropriateness of an investment in commodities in light of their own financial condition 
and objectives. 
Exchange Traded Funds - Ownership in an exchange traded fund does not provide investors with entitlements to the underlying security. Rather investors own a 'creation unit" in a portfolio of stocks, 
bonds, or other securities. ETFs are subject to market risk and will fluctuate in value based on movements in the underlying security. Investors should realize that redemption values of ETFs are 
based upon the market value at the time of order and not at the net asset value as is the case for mutual finds. Investments in ETFs are subject to commission charges and management fees. 
Deutsche Bank may have certain conflicts of interest in recommending investments in certain funds, including the fact that we may receive 12b.1 fees and other compensation from the funds and their

is the risk that the issuer will redeem the debt at its option, fully or partially, before the scheduled maturity date. The market value of debt instruments may fluctuate, and proceeds from sales prior to 
maturity may be more or less than the amount originally invested or the maturity value due to changes in market conditions or changes in the credit quality of the issuer. Bonds are subject to the credit 
risk of the issuer. This is the risk that the issuer might be unable to make interest and/or principal payments on a timely basis. Bonds are also subject to reinvestment risk, which is the risk that 
principal and/or interest payments from a given investment may be reinvested at a lower interest rate

changes and the creditworthiness of the issuers, and investing in high yield bonds poses additional credit risk, as well as greater risk of default.
