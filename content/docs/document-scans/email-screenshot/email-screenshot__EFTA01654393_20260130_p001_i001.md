SIGNIFICANT NEWS EVENTS 
FBI Issues Warning to All Smartphone Users — This Dangerous New Scam Could Be at Your Door 
Tom's Guide (08/18, Stanley) reported that the FBI has issued a warning about a new "brushing' scam where hackers send unsolicited packages with a QR code to 
steal personal and financial information. According to the article, the QR code prompts the recipient to provide sensitive information or download malicious 
software that steals data from their phone. To avoid falling for this scam, the FBI advises users to beware of unsolicited packages, not scan QR codes from unknown 
origins, and take precautions before authorizing phone permissions and access to websites and applications. 
U.S. Seizes $2.8 Million From Zeppelin Ransomware Operator 
Security Week (08/18, Arghire) reported that the D01 has charged !anis Aleksandrovich Antropenko, a Zeppelin ransomware operator, with computer fraud and 
money laundering conspiracy. According to the article, the DO1 has seized over $2.8 million in cryptocurrency from Antropenko's wallet, believed to be proceeds 
from his ransomware activities. Antropenko allegedly deployed Zeppelin ransomware against businesses and individuals worldwide, encrypting and exfiltrating 
data for extortion, and laundered the proceeds through various means. The article highlighted that in 2022, CISA and the FBI warned that Zeppelin was exploiting 
RDP connections and vulnerabilities in SonicWall firewalls for initial access, and that its operators would sometimes execute the ransomware multiple times within 
the same network. Tech Radar (08/18, Jennings-Trace) also reported on the story. 
Justice Department To Begin Giving Congress Files From Jeffrey Epstein Investigation, Lawmaker Says 
The Associated Press (08/18, Tucker) reported that the Justice Department will provide Congress with documents from the Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking 
investigation, starting Friday, to be given to the House Oversight Committee. According to the article, the documents are in response to a broad subpoena issued 
by the committee, which sought records from the case files of Epstein and his former girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell. The article noted that the move is seen as a 
step towards transparency, with Kentucky Rep. James Comer, the committee chair, appreciating the Trump Administration's commitment to providing information 
about the matter. The article highlighted that it was not clear exactly which or how many documents might be produced or whether the cooperation with Congress 
reflected a broader change in posture since last month, when the FBI and Justice Department abruptly announced that they would not be releasing any additional 
records from the Epstein investigation after determining that no "further disdosure would be appropriate or warranted." Additional reporting on the story was 
provided by Washington Examiner (08/18, Deese) (2) (3), New York Post (08/18, Christenson), UPI (08/18, Walsh), USA Today (08/18, Meyer), Axios (08/18,
