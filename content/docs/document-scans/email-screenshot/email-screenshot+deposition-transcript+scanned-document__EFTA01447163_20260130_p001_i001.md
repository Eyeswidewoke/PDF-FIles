ii) Speculators don't appear long EURUSD to us. Majority are short or flat. 
iii) implied volatility is 5.25% (offer for 2week options) which is very very low historically. So this 
is a penny option, highly convex, pain trade bet against other speculators betting on QE 
If my view is wrong 6bp is lost. If i'm right I'd plan to exit in a week making 4-6x 
Scenario Analysis - Premium in bp of EUR notional 
(Embedded image moved to file: pic12273.gif)« 4bp is mid mkt, offer is 6bp 
3) Position for a Stronger Dollar - lyear view (now or soon) 
Buy ly expiry European style digital binary option on EURUSD struck 5% below spot @ 21% of payout (which 
i think is too cheap) 
Current strike (spot - 5%) would be 1.3120 
At expiry if EURUSD has fallen by more than 5% from current levels the option payout is EUR1mm. Upfront 
premium is EUR210k. 
The option is liquid and can be unwound at any time. 
i) Yellen has done a poor job of communicating the Fed's thinking but its increasingly clear the Fed will 
brake later than usual 
ii) Betting on higher US interest rates in the rates market isn't cost effective because the forward 
curve is already pricing in higher rates 
iii) The Dollar hasn't appreciated yet because short rates in the VS haven't risen meaningfully 
iv) THE KEY POINT - FX volatility is very low in currency pairs like EURUSD where central bank policy on 
each side is increasingly diverging. The low vol makes this bet inexpensive to put on. 
v) Because FX vol is so low betting now or soon with a one year time horizon costs very little. id rather 
be early than late here 
vi) i prefer ly expiry because this trade could take 6-12mths to play out 
lv EURUSD VOL: Low - but then again most most vols are 
What I like about EURUSD is that central bank policy on each side is diverging

19.5 is mid (offer is 21) 
4) Scale into f4mm Nationwide (UK Building Society) 6.875% perpetual which yields 6.4% in GBP and is 
likely to be called in 5years 
European Bank AT1 HyBrid Bonds (aka CoCo's) have rallied significantly. We were unable to get the BBVA 
issue at the right levels. 
A very similar bond which has rallied 30bp less than the BBVA is the Nationwide (UK Building Society) 
6.875% perpetual which currently yields 6.4% and is likely to be called in 5years time. It has a tierl 
capital trigger of 7% and current tierl capital ratio is 13% which is fair margin. 
The Nationwide one i'm suggesting today is rated Fitch/S&P BB+, its parent is Fitch/S&P rated single-A 
The BBVA bond we tried to buy earlier is rated Fitch BB-, its parent is S&P rated BBB-
I suggest scaling f2mm at 6.5% and f2mm at 6.75%. Transaction cost is 6bp from mid.
