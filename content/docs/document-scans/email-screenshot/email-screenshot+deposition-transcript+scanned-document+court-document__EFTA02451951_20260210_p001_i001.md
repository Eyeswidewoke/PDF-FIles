Transaction complete ! 
. this - in spite of your collection =f Elysium misfits. !!! 
With Brad out of the office and un=ble to run his usual interference , the level of his utter =AO incompetence was 
brought front and center, he may be a step up fr=m Eileen<=span>, but if he is , then it is not certainly no= by much, . 
Though you and I have spent many many hours discussi=g the imp=rtance of details and mechanics. I was not 
shown=one document re phaidon,- not one.. Brad wanted to keep it priva=e between he and his so called " advisors " 
=AO however as he was out of the office during the most important transacti=n of the year, I did get to spend time 
with joslin Joe an= john, - the situation in your office is wholly ludicrou= - to summarize - the list I provided to Brad 
last December - things I thought were a priority to get done a=ter consulting with your office still remains 
virtually=C2 undone. 
IT, still desperately needed= reporting flawed cumbersome and inaccurate . all done by hand as =AO one -off exercises 
, - airplane: re structure, (my only sugge=ted priority in june ) is really ,no further ahead, consultants up th= kazoo but 
nothing at all done.( the office was told that i cannot e=en see the proposals received without brads specific 
authorization ) =- brad has no idea even as to what questions to ask. he knows little of fi=ance, is run roughshod over by 
almost everyone in the office. he is = little man , using your power, to appear larger . Eileen was self aware e=ough to 
know she was over her head , that is a huge difference. =AO bad info is rampant ie 3 million in deductions =span 
style="background:yellow none repeat scroll 0% 0W>Im<=span> told are taken for art space but on closer 
examination=C2 it turns out they cannot be used at all. ( ZERO benefit ) thou=h you will be told yes they were deducted 
on the return they said th=t is the question they get asked ! " were they deducted " =ot -" is there a benefit " !! I 
asked f=r the balance sheet and P and L for Regan arts , a basic f=rst step in order to check your financials. "sorry we 
never go= one?" though 9.8 million invested, no p&I, nothing = a construction project run amok , no budget, the coo 
fired af=er only 3 months. , no clue . I can add that artspaceq=pan> financials are also a total mess. 
A= your friend and in order toturn the page. I will try to be construc=ive 
The following is a list of things I think would be in =our interest to get done asap .but definitely not by me . 
=C2 
i suggest you form new grats.=C2 , hire a high level tax partner. use your trading =ccounts as they remain the 
paramount requirement 16 months aft=r i emailed to you their importance. , I suggest you consider having=C2 the 
49percent of phaidon merged into artspance</=pan> and have Richard buy artspace.=C2 re-do bank loans. no need to 
pay interest at higher rate= on boat or plane. . as Richard is now no longer trustee. re- =o will, make suydam executor , 
with Bar=y, and john as back up. pay 1 million a year for execut=r role. get rid of Judy Black trust, deal with gift= and 
their tax returns, . review amounts to kids at fixed ages. put =ore protections in for Alex and Victoria. = distribute 
some money to kids let them make decisions. = decide art division with children in attendance . have =ire drill done on 
estate. fill out estate returns as if you and Debr= died today, choose advisers - rick bronstein said th= only 1040 he ever
