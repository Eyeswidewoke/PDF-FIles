Leon, 
Yesterday , I again spent hours upon ho=rs of my time with your office. ,( speak to brad to get flavor= and you and i 
will discuss the results in gory gruesome detail on F=iday. it mirrored many other weeks spent doing the things that I 
don=t have the time to do. 
In order to keep things in perspective, maybe reviewi=g an analogy I have used before with you, might be helpful. 
Yo= and your family are a 6 billion dollar corp. with an inco=e between 250 -500 million dollars per year. It contains a 
few =operating biz's , a large wide array of existing investments, in vario=s categories , a desire to enter into others. A 
panoply of loa=s, notes. purchases, wide range of all types of taxes.=C2 , planes. boats homes.. trusts ,grats. a crazy 
number =f bank accts. ( with no oversight ) . law firms, acct firms, 80= page tax returns, foreign firms. art consultants. 
construction =A0consultants bill payers, home mgmt.,vast multitude of=C2 Ilc's , including foreign, and with all that 
you only=have a combined overhead of less that 3 million dollars.=C2 
I have previously sent you the very same=note that i have enclosed again below ,this time with highligh=s . I wrote 
it to you over a year ago. As my =acute disability ( selective memory) seems to have been raised as =AO one of your 
concerns , as a rule I try to memorialize=things in writing in an attempt to lay out issues that I fear =ay later turn out 
to be a problem. ie what i would and wou=dn't do , - my responsibilities. etc and those things that=C2 are not. below 
you will find details of things that I th=ught needed to be done, so that you wouldn't find y=urself in the very place 
where you currently find yourself. ho=ever ,you chose to defer many of my suggestions- see below -,until o=ly weeks 
ago. ! you chose to defer the jpm acct. th= art partnership on and on - into this year. and though the 60- 50 40 timb=r 
emails all carried with it a clear warning that you needed to do s=mething re personnel if it were to stabilize,- you 
chose to wa=t. 
ONE YEAR AGO

With regard the more press=ng issue I am uncertain of just how to proceed. I am torn, as =y very strong inclination is 
not to be involved at all . It is extre=ely time consuming, delicate, fraught with many pitfall many that will mak= you 
very upset and a major pain in the ass. I wrote you month= ago that the quality of the people involved need to be 
upgraded. ( =ucky for me these last issues arose way before the beginning of my i=volvement ) I am also aware 
however of my overarching friendship obligations of ok, -given all the complexities=C2 who else can do it? problem.
