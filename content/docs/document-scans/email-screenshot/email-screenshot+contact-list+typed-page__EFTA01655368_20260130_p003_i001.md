IN THE NEWS 
Tulsi Gabbard Strips 37 Security Clearances Over Obama-Ordered Intel Report That Launched Russiagate 
The New York Post (08/19, Christenson) reported that Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard announced 
that security clearances had been pulled from 37 current and former officials who "abused public trust by 
politicizing and manipulating" information, including several who were involved in a controversial, Barack Obama-
ordered assessment of Russian influence in the 2016 election. "Being entrusted with a security clearance is a 
privilege, not a right," Gabbard said in a statement. "Those in the Intelligence Community who betray their oath to 
the Constitution and put their own interests ahead of the interests of the American people have broken the sacred 
trust they promised to uphold." Gabbard last month began declassifying records about the crafting of the 2017 
Intelligence Community Assessment (ICA) under Obama, revealing what she has called a "treasonous conspiracy" 
by senior administration officials "to subvert President Trump's 2016 victory." According to the article, those 
records show that then-DNI James Clapper, then-CIA Director John Brennan, and then-FBI Director James Comey 
spearheaded the ICA report to emphasize Moscow's role in the electoral contest and purported support of then-
candidate Trump. The article noted that Trump's Department of Justice has since opened a grand jury 
investigation into Brennan, Comey, and Clapper over the Russiagate probe. Additional reporting on the story was

Abrego Garcia's Lawyers Accuse Justice Dept. of Vindictive Prosecution 
The New York Times (08/19, Feuer) reported that Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia's lawyers have accused the Trump 
administration of vindictive prosecution, claiming he was charged with a crime after fighting his deportation. 
According to the article, the lawyers argue that Abrego Garcia was singled out because he refused to acquiesce in 
the government's violation of his due process rights, not because of the seriousness of his alleged conduct. The 
case against Abrego Garcia, who was wrongfully expelled to El Salvador, is nearing a significant inflection point, 
with his lawyers seeking to have the charges dismissed due to alleged vindictive prosecution by the government. 
The article highlighted that at the heart of the case was a 2022 traffic stop during which Garcia was pulled over and 
discovered to be driving several Hispanic men, some of whom were in the country illegally. Even though the FBI 
learned about the stop at the time, it decided not to do anything about it, and Garcia was released without 
charges. Additional reporting on the story was provided by The Hill (08/19, Beitsch), ABC News (08/19, Romero), 
Associated Press (08/19, McAvoy), Washington Post (08/19, Roebuck), CBS News (08/19, Montoya-Galvez), CNN 
(08/19, Cole), Bloomberg (08/19, Blumberg), The Independent (08/19, Woodward), Reuters (08/19, Wolfe), and 
HuffPost (08/19, O'Connor). 
Continued Reporting: Director Patel Says 21 Arrested Overnight in D.C. Bringing Overall Total to 450 
Newsmax (08/19, Freeman) reported that there were 21 additional arrests overnight by federal law enforcement in 
Washington, D.C., Director Patel announced on X on Tuesday. "21 more FBI arrests in Washington D.C. last night 
August 18-19: -4 gun recoveries -6 drug seizures -Charges including Felony assault, Larceny, Drug offenses, Assault 
on officer, and more Federal partners have arrested over 450 individuals since this operation began. The work 
continues." Reuters (08/19, Lynch, Parker) added that the Trump administration has ordered federal prosecutors in 
Washington, D.C., to pursue aggressive charges against people arrested in the city's crackdown. According to the 
article, the move marks an escalation of Trump's push against what he has described as a wave of crime and 
homelessness in Washington, in which the Republican president has already called up hundreds of National Guard 
troops and temporarily taken over the Democratic-led city's police department. Jonathan Hornok, head of the 
criminal division, directed prosecutors to maximize federal charges, which could strain the court system and raise 
stakes for defendants. The article highlighted that the orders could place additional stress on federal law 
enforcement agents, including those from the FBI who are already stretched thin because they have been ordered 
to participate in nightly rotational shifts to patrol the capital's streets. The Associated Press (08/19, Brown, 
Whitehurst, Megerian) and Reuters (08/19, Ax) reported that over 1,100 National Guard troops from six
