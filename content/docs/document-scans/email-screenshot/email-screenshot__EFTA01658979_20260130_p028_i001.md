The Wall Street Journal (10/23, Stupp, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) reported that a French 
court has asked Microsoft to guarantee data collected in a government-run health data 
gathering project will not be shared with US intelligence authorities. Last week's ruling comes 
after the European country's data protection authority told the court any US-based cloud 
provider could be compelled by US surveillance laws to share data, so they should not be able 
to host the most sensitive health-related data should. Microsoft is working with French 
authorities to put additional safeguards in place for the Health Data Hub.

boy found in July in a creek was a missing Kansas City social worker, authorities say." The AP

exam, Becchina said."

When Jury Trials In DC Superior Court Will Resume Still Uncertain. 
The Washington Post (10/23, Alexander, 14.2M) reports that in Washington, DC as well as 
throughout the country, "the pandemic halted jury trials." The Post adds that "in the District, 
victims and their families will continue to wait for justice, most likely into 2021." Since March, in 
excess of 300 jury trials slated to happen "in D.C. Superior Court for jailed defendants have 
been postponed, a court spokeswoman said." According to the Post, "Court officials declined to 
specify when the trials will resume, but there are indications none will be held for the remainder 
of the year." Anita Josey-Herring, the court's chief judge, said, "The health crisis is driving when 
the court can realistically reopen to the public at large and at what level the court can open." 
Proponents Of Now-Passed Virginia Sentencing Measure Feel Bill Will Have 
Transformational Impact. 
The Washington Post (10/23, Weiner, Vozzella, 14.2M) reported a Virginia measure permitting 
"defendants convicted in a jury trial to be sentenced by a judge" has been passed. Proponents 
of the bill claim its "effect will be transformational, because juries, which have less flexibility 
than judges in crafting sentences, tend to hand out stiffer punishments than those called for by 
guidelines. While judges can reduce a jury sentence, they rarely do."
