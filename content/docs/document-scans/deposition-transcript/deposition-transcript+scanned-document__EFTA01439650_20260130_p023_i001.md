GLDUS132 EverWatch Financial 
Initial and Subsequent 
Closings 
The Access Fund may hold multiple closings. The General Partner will 
provide prospective Limited Partners with notice of the anticipated date 
of the initial closing (the "Initial Closing") of the Access Fund. The 
General Partner may admit additional Investors into the Access Fund or 
allow existing Limited Partners to increase their Subscriptions in 
subsequent closings until the final closing of the Access Fund (each such 
closing, a "Subsequent Closing" and the final Subsequent Closing, the 
"Final Closing"). Subsequent closings may be held after the Initial 
Closing until the date that is 3 months following the last date on which 
the Underlying Fund may hold a closing (it being understood that the 
Glendower GP is not required to accept any such additional commitment 
from the Access Fund). Each investor that becomes a Limited Partner 
(or that is already a Limited Partner and increases its Subscription) at 
any closing subsequent to the Initial Closing will be required to make a 
capital contribution at admission equal to (i) the amount of the 
contribution required by the Underlying Fund from the Access Fund 
attributable to such Investor's new or increased Subscription (which may 
include an interest component at a rate per annum equal to the higher of 
(A) LIBOR plus 2% and (B) 8% for the period or such other amount as 
set forth in the Underlying Fund LPA), if any, if the Access Fund makes 
a corresponding increase in its commitment to the Underlying Fund, (ii) 
its proportionate share of all funded expenses of the Access Fund 
(excluding the Management Fee) and, to the extent not duplicative of (i) 
above, its proportionate share of all funded Subscriptions of Investors 
admitted in prior closings, including if applicable, in connection with 
Subscriptions (or portions thereof) that are not correspondingly invested 
in the Underlying Fund, (iii) the amount of the Management Fee that 
would have been payable in respect of such Investor had such Investor 
subscribed for an Interest at the Initial Closing and (iv) an amount 
computed as interest on the amounts set forth under (i) through (iii) 
above at a rate per annum equal to the higher of (A) LIBOR plus 2% and 
(B) 8% for the period from the due date or dates on which the other 
Partners were required to make their earlier contributions to the date of 
such contribution. Amounts paid by any Limited Partner as interest on 
(ii) above, shall be paid to the Access Fund for the account of Limited 
Partners that participated in prior closings and any amounts paid by any 
Limited Partner as interest on (iii) above, shall be paid to the Investment 
Manager and not to the Access Fund or any other Limited Partner. Any 
contributions by a Limited Partner to the Access Fund to fund late 
closing interest under (iv) shall not reduce the unpaid portion of such 
Limited Partner's Subscription (i.e., a Limited Partner will be required 
to contribute amounts in addition to its Subscription to fund any late 
closing interest, if applicable) and any such interest amounts credited to 
the account of Limited Partners shall not increase the unpaid 
Subscriptions of such Limited Partners who receive such interest. 
Failure to pay subsequent interest as calculated in (iv) above will be 
considered a default under the Partnership Agreement.
