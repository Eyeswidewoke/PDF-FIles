delivered to the designated Trustee. If the legally competent adult Beneficiaries do not designate 
a successor Trustee within sixty days after receipt of notice of such vacancy or if there is no 
legally competent adult Beneficiary of such trust, my Trustee shall designate a successor Trustee 
by written notice delivered to the designated Trustee and each adult beneficiary then entitled or 
permitted to receive income from such trust. If no successor Trustee is designated pursuant to 
this Section 7.4, then a successor Trustee shall be named by order of a court of competent

value occasioned by reason of any negligence, error or mistake of judgment in entering into any 
transaction, in making any sale or investment, in continuing to hold any property, or by reason of
