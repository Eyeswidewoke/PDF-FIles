Hi Jen:this is a very weird email I know and please excuse spelling Im in a hurry. for what its 
worth let me explain: I dated 
for short while a few years back.1 fell in love very deeply 
with him very fast someting I had never experienced before. Then he suddenly broke up with 
me and I totally broke down. I didnt know what was happening cause I thought he loved me 
too but he said I wasnt the right person for him.! was mad and hurt and very confused. I 
started doing stuff to hurt him back. he has a reputation to loose adn so I did some web stuff 
to hurt him that way.! am pretty techy and have lots of friends in silicon valley where I lived 
for the longest time that I could use also. He knew about some of the things like facebook and 
other match profile I put up, and last year when he started dating you he told me to back off 
cause he found "the one". Well I was still in love with him, and actually moved to new york 
because of him from calf just earlier last year (he doesnt even know that) to have a chance to 
get back wtih him.but he never even responded to my texts and call. I had tried to fall in love 
with someone else but it never felt the same so I was so afraid I would never be happy again 
without him. I did things I am not proud of and regret.lm not a bad person but just couldnt 
help doing this. I couldnt bear the thought that he found "the one". I had already access to his 
computer from remote and had his phone jailbroken as he never updated his software that was 
easy. I pretended he was active on match. Until he updated the OS I had full actress to his 
phone I could listen to converstations write messages whatever I wanted.I saw stuff between 
you and him also, sorry. I was just so in love and jealous cause you two looked so cute 
together. But now when I saw that what I did caused the end of your relationship I feel really 
bad. To make a long story short I now want to resolve things and make it up to you and 
him.Something selfishly about it because I know now he will never be with me again but as 
long as he isnt really off the market I cant stop thinking of him. so it would actually help me 
get over this if i knew you guys got hitched. Does this make any sense to u i dunno:( in any 
case what i am trying to say is i did a lot of bad stuff that made him look bad and you must 
think he is bad but he really is not. Before it was my intention cause i a was so mad but now i 
jsut want to get over this or else it eats me up. I need closure. 
I would have rather met up with you to tell you all this in person (tried calling you also) but I am 
leaving tomorrow and wont be back til end of the week and think you should know the skinny
