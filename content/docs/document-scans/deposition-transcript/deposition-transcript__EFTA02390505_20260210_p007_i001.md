when you are young, specially into fake illusions= Still now, I'm trying to understand myself and who I am. I believe

some money ( which I've never =id before ) which I believe it's already a small accomplishment. I did=some babysitting 
and after 2 paid trial days ( 250 euros per day ) shootin= for Vogue and Dior, I've got hired by one of the best fashion 
photogr=phers called Paolo Roversi to be his assistant ( paid job ). I'm very =appy and excited to work and learn from 
him which is better than any photo=raphy school. I'm ready to work as long as I need to in order to build=my skills and 
stand out in that field. I think I've achieved some resu=ts and gained some value if I compare myself 2 years ago from 
now. Thanks =o you I had the possibility to make many interesting experiences like Ferr=gamo in China and Alaia in 
Paris. Even though I didn't get hired =rom them, those experiences allowed me to understand what I like and what = 
don't like and shaped in part the person I am. Thanks to the Ala.=AFa internship and my passion for photography I am 
now working with Paolo =oversi doing what I really like. However even though I work hard and I am =aid I cannot fully 
support myself to pay a rent and my living in Paris. I =eally would like to continue through this path, I feel it's the right 
=ne but I need your help, your support and your advices because I cannot ma=e it by myself. 
I promise I will use my money wisely witho=t throwing it away into futilities like 
parties and holidays because I wan= to grow and build my skills, my carrier and hopefully my future self.Q=A0
