building could sit on the stairs and watch along with t=em. At the age of eleven, I saved up enough so that I could buy 
my mother and me a 19 inch Philco television set. And ore of my perennial favorite television shows over the decades 
has been 60 Minutes. So I was truly=surprised at the hatch job journalism of last Sunday's segment, 'Cleantech 
Crash,'=which critics have called a "hit job," a "debacle," an =i>"about face" and even "Dumb & Dumber Part 3.&q=ot;

The segment is drawing sharp criticism for its pessim=stic take on the green technology sector, which questioned 
whether clean tech ha= become a "dirty word," arguing that renewable energy and other types of clean technology are a 
dying indus=ry. One of the biggest issues with the segment, critics charge, is that it conflated the Silicon Valley clean 
tech venture capital scene with the Department of Energy's loan guarantee program fo= renewable energy. Climate 
Progress' Joe Romm contends that CBS=/b> missed the point by focusing on the failure rate of private-sector startups 
and "(failed] to understand that the successes more than pay for the failures." =A0lt's worth noting that as many as 
three-quarters of all venture-backed businesses fail, the Wall Street Jo=rnal explained in 2012. Only three in 10 startups 
in the clean tech sector yield favorable returns for investors, according to a 2004 estimate.=/span> 
The New York Times recently profiled the U.S. solar industry in a front-page story, noting tha= companies are benefitting 
from a "solar power craze that is sweeping Wall Street." Despite =he recent U.S. oil and gas boom, the country "has 
more than doubled electricity generation from wind and solar" in the past four years, notes the San Jose Mercury News' 
Da=a Hull. "If 60 Minutes had taken just two minutes to call us, they could have gotten so=e of their facts straight," Ken 
John, a vice president of the Solar Energy Industries Association, told the Washington Examiner. "In truth, America's 
solar energy industry just closed the books on a record-shattering year in 2013." 
The "60 Minutes" segment also focused on th= Department of Energy's loan guarantee program, which has funneled 
billi=ns of dollars into low-carbon and clean-energy projects since the passage of the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The goal 
of the program "is not to make money," Romm notes, but to accelerate the deployment of clean ener=y technology, 
while dropping prices and creating jobs. Jonathan Silver, th= former head of the DOE's loan guarantee program, 
testified before Congress in 2012 that the portion =f grants given to ventures that later failed "represent's] less than 3% 
of the total portfolio." He told Fortune in June t=at the program "has been a significant success." "Markets will always 
have difficulty deploying innovative technologies=at scale," he explained. "Fundamentally, a program like th=s is 
necessary to address that market failure." 
Despite the successes of the program and analyses sho=ing its cost-effectiveness for taxpayers, Sunday's segment 
focused on two n=table failures -- automaker Fisker and solar panel manufacturer Solyndra. Whil= interviewing former 
Energy Department undersecretary Steven Koonin, "60 Minutes" host Les=ey Stahl rattled off seven other failures of the
