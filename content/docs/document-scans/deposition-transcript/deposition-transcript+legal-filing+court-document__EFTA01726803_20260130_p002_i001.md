Finance Charges: Average Daily Balance Method for Calculation of Finance Charges (FC):We use the Average 
Daily Balance method to calculate FC on your Account. Under this method, we figure the FC on your Account by applying 
the daily periodic rate to the Average Daily Balance (as described below) for each feature (such as Purchase, Cash 
Advance and Balance Transfer features) of your Account (including current trans(ctions). To get the Average Daily 
Balance ford each feature, we (1) take the beginning balance for the feature each day (inducting unpaid FC from previous 
billing perios), (2) add any new transactions, debits, or fees, (3) subtract any payments or credits, and (4) make any 
appropriate adjustments. For each dey 
after
the first day of the billing period, we also acid Of) amount of 
interest equal to the previous day's daily balance multiplied by the .dally periodic rate for the feature. 
This gives us the daily balance for the feature for that day and the beginning balance for the feature furore next day. If this 
balance is negative, ft is considered to be zero. Then, we add up all the daily balances for the feature fr the billing period 
and divide the total by the number of days in the billing period. This gives us the Average Daily Balance for the feature. For 
all features except Cash Advances andcertain promotions, the Average Daily Balance will be considered to be zero if you 
paid the New Balance, if any, shown on your previous month's statement by the Payment Due Dale shown on that 
statement. If you multiply the Average Daily Balance for each feature by the number of days in the billing period and the 
daily periodic rate for that feature, the result will be the FC assessed on that feature, except for variations caused M. 
rouncling. The total FC for the billing period is calculated by adding the FC assessed on all features of the Account.

FC for any billing period in which FC are imposed is $0.50.
