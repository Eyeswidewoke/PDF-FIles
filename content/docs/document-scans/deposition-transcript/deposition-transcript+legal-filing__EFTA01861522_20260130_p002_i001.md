welcomed nearly $50 million in foundation dollars so far - one to deal with urban health and one upcoming to 
deal with sanitation/Water. The foundation has rallied other donors around these two issues so you can 
imagine that the numbers skyrocket. 
It sounds like from our brief conversation last week, that he really wants an academic institution and I think 
that is legit and an interesting idea. To date he has a terrible track record there. (allegedly) "stealing" money 
from multilaterals and from the french that was intended to support higher education. So donors are nervous 
about that. 
All that aside and trying to think proactively and together about this, I am proposing something that would 
help generate revenue from the capital markets for his city (that they can control) rather than depending on 
his money or donors. It's kiknd of the "anti colonialist" vision - so hopefully we can discuss in more detail. 
What might be an interesting way forward is that we could think together about how to use a muni finance 
option that would support an academic institution of higher learning (if that is truly the right priority). If they 
are amenable I have also had some success elsewhere (Asian U for Women) in convincing the World Bank 
to reduce some of their TA requirements and reprogram some of that money to endow national academic 
instutuions of higher learning through the concessions within the loan packages. So if there are any ongoing 
loan negotiations we might be able to structure them together. I can see a West African College of 
Engineering or something like that potentially having broad appeal. So I can try, but I need your help. 
Sometimes with politics and the threat of regime change, people get nervous and discount good ideas. 
I would hope that an open minded and forward thinking government would want to listen. You know that I 
am only interested in getting this right for the people. I have no ulterior motives. 
Please ask your friend to give me a chance. Then he can say no or yes or find a way forward together. In 
the meantime let him know that he should also do homework because he's taking a lot of colonial money 
that he can't control and that will topple him. He needs to provide good things for his people in a way that 
works for them. I think I can help, maybe a little.
