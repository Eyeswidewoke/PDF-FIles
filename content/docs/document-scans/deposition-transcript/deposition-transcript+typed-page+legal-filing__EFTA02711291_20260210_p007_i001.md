To make something created pass into the untreated: no action, but realization. All created things are dead things. They 
belong to the world. aceWe participate in the creation of the world by decreating ourselves,a" by peopling the world with the 
dead images of mankind. 
The created world is a world of waste, of life. And life is the elimination of what is dead. We give names to things that cane 
flit be named: we create life, we create death. Creation: the waste system. ficeLife is the elimination of what is dead.a5i 
All these things. All these people. All these places. All this waste, this garbage: itaTMs me. There was never anyone, anyone 
but me, anything but me, talking to me of me.' aceWhen I dream and invent without a backward glance, am I not . . . 
Nature:1" 
Dispense with the notion of nature: a creative power that makes something from nothing. Nature is scenery built up by man. 
Man is dead. The unity is unitless. There is no continuity, no accretion, no incremental serial advances, no depth. There is no 
nature. There was never anyone but me talking to me of me. No nature: just a nature created in what it says. 
Dismiss yourself. Man is dead. mereaTMs no nature but Ikea fall, into the state of nature. The spirit, the human essence, hides, 
buried in the natural object: a'projectedaTM 
. the death of gods and the birth of poetry.a" A nature created in what it says. 
liceEach herb and each tree, mountain, hill, earth and sea, cloud, meteor and star, are men seen afar.ii" There arc no external 
points of support in reality. The unity is unitless: this is not just a rival to an objective reality. There is no real world: it is an 
illusion. The unity is unitless. This is the whole truth, and it can only be apprehended through its contrast with the illusion, the 
real world. Thus, iceman perceives in the world only what already lies within him; but to perceive what lies within him, man 
needs the world.li" 
Take the real out of the world and put it back where it belongs, where it always has been: realization. Any system that 
attempts to base a pattern of thought, or a linguistic practice, on some independent foundation in reality, is impossible. Any 
system is impossible. If these systems aceneed any justification, it must lie within them, because there are no independent 
points of support outside them. That kind of objectivism is an illusion, produced, no doubt, by the reassuring character of 
explanation, which is that any support that is needed comes from the center, man himself an 
But the center has dissolved. Man is dead: the great explainer, the great explanation. He has lost the center: he was the 
center, the whole in which he was contained. There can be no more explanations, no more worlds. 
There is no center, no source. You canaTMt explain what isnalMt there. Metaphysical I, nonphysical I: itaTMs kethe fault of 
pronouns, there is no name for me, no pronoun for me, all the trouble comes from that.i" 
No center, no source, no whole, no one: and now no me. What in the world do you do? acclaims a lot to expect of one 
creature that he should first behave as if he were not, then as if he were, before being admitted to that peace where he neither 
is, nor is not, and where the language dies that permits of such expressionsit"
