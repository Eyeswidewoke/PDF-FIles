"The Physics of the Universe" Summit 
Hosted at SpaceX. Callech and the Andar West Hollywood Hyatt. January 9,9,10 2010 
To accomplish the extraonlinary. you must seek extraordinary people. 
James Lee Byars 
In this two day retreat we hope to bring together the top minds (thinkers and dons) in the fields of the physics of the universe both theoretical and 
experimental. We want to ask and answer questions like "How much can we understand about the universe. soon?" "What is the role of theory and of 
experiment in getting thee' "Arc them things we may not understand?" and "How much of what we think we know might he wrong?". The meeting 
fosters discussion and we arc convinced that when the best people talk the outcome is advance and growth. We arc hoping we can avoid standard 
prepared talks, and locus on exciting forefront issues, wale there may be differences of opinion. or new results that will provoke wide discussion. You 
will receive more information about the program and your own possible role in the near future. The summit is inspired by the onset of the 
Large Hadron Collider. the Planck mission, the recent results by satellite and grosind based experiments on dark matter searches. and the vast progress in 
theory. Also by meetings such as the LIR' Olympics, and the workshops of the past years at the NICTP. KITP and Perimeter as well as interdisciplinary 
gatherings of the ASL: Origins. the Edge Master-Classes and Google's SeiFoo.
