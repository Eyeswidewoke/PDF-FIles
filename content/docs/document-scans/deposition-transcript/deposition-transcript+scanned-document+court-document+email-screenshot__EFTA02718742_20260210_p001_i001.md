PNL Generale 2015 - Aggiornato a agosto.xls 
Sure, 
here is the bridge 
1-Th= excel is the budget as you can see from 18 months ago 
2-The data communicated to you yesterday is the actual of 2015 up to =oday 
3-The 2014 budget was forecasting 4,590 2mor=ow + 0,353 2day = 4,943M or sales without expenses reinvoicing to 
create a profit of 878&#=9;865 (all un Euros= 
4-The actual for 2015 shows total invoicing with=ut expenses of 3,703M and - 4.4M with expenses reinvoiced. The profit 
is 438K. I am attaching t=e file that I do every month as usual 
5-The underperformance is why l=have to resctructureGiancarlo from leadership role that I will take. I know what to do 
and the root c=use of it. We lost 2 of our biggest clients as they decided to move produc=ion abroad and internalize 
modeling. Then Giancarlo fired last year our number one director for personal reas=ns against my advice but promised 
to still deliver on the budget. Clearly =hese results did not materialize and that's why he agreed to step down=without 
any fight and to become just an employee.Third the directors did n=t have responsibility to deliver and Giancarlo's 
mother problems did not allow him to be p=esent in the company more than a couple of days per week this year. 
0espit= all of this the company was not delivering the budget but holding on. Sin=e July I have changed 2 directors out of 
4 and now need to invest for a st=ong director for the 3rd table (the 4th director is perfect). 
6-The growth will require net working capital as we pay models= apartments, tickets immediately (the only agency in the 
world that pays i=mediately and has no bank debt that I know of) but we receive the cash fro= clients 3-4 months after. 
Of the 800K needed not one penny will come to m= pockets, it all goes into the companies to boost growth. 
c/=iv> 
7-The companies will also pay consulting fees every year. I will l=ke that someone from your side audits these numbers 
as well so that you ca= get 20% of these net fees as well. It's very simple and clear to do s=. 
8-=he mid-term strategy is to leverage the ital=an operati=ns (that has to become just perfect) and using the brand 
name that b=ilt 14 years ago and the business procedures that I created get the approp=iate models to have successful 
operations in Paris, London, NY and Miami. =ashion models (that I wanted to buy with you) did the same launching Next 
=odels and then selling it to Goldengate Private Equity =or - 105M$. They did it investing 8ME that came almost entirely 
from their =ree cash flow of the italian operations over - 4 years. =ou might know the story in more detail than myself. If 
they did it I can f=r sure
