I am =ften asked to give my views and to rate the distinguished list of =nbsp;todays various financiers. I hesitate to do 
so as my area of =xpertise is now philanthropy and was formerly technology, =nbsp;Money is a product of my past 
endeavors and the leverage for my =uture social goas. That being said, without a doubt , one =f the smartest people i 
have ever met, and I fear this statement =nbsp;will be controversial.is New Yorks Jeffrey Epstein, =oth he and I are 
very aware of his mistakes that now over a decade =ater still cause concern amongst but i am a firm believer that 
=veryone deserves a second chance. that is what makes this country =reat. 
he is neither fluent in spanish french or italian =owever he is highly conversant and 
multilingual =n the areas of the most advanced science. He can =xquisitely conduct a seminar in fields as diverse as 
evolutionary =iology, computational neuro science.oreven the highly esoteric =nbsp;ndimensional manifolds. ,as well as 
music as a lens into the =rain. His interests are far ranging and unlike many that simply =epeat back what they have 
read , he is creative and original in fields =uch ase , signal intelligence, power law distributions , and =ncryption. 
I am well aware that in his past he has =ade some awful decisions, and Im sure he would have done things =ifferently if 
he had the opportunity to do them over. however he =as paid his debt to society, asked his friends and family for 
=orgiveness and has continued his charitable work that he began even =ecades before his travails. 
i have had =he privilege to meet the worlds greatest minds, and i can easily =ay that Jeffrey s is amongst the best of 
=hose. 
I have utmost confidence in his =ntegrity. I have dealt with him for a number of years on both =ides of a negotiation and 
say with certainty that I;d rather be =n his side. 
He has been in the =illionaire business for longer than almost anyone else. His =nsight into the unique problems of the 
super wealthy, has been =nvaluable to many others that i know. He found a niche in the early 80s =iscerning the 
burdens of hyper wealth and from his time on the board of =ockefeller or his time at the trilateral commission, the 
common =efrain from those he has come in contact with Jeffrey has made me think =ifferently about. ....//. =/span> 
He has an extraordinary =bility with numbers, complex concepts. mixed with a =nbsp;sometimes brutal honesty, 
refreshing, a sense of humor =hat some find highly cultured others find just outright =illy, 
His homes are probably the best =ollection of real estate in the united states. A private island , =hat some describe as a 
tribute to megalomania. and a ranch in new =exico that is truly beyond imagination and my favorite townhouse in NY. 
=nbsp; His attention to detail is remarkable . I find =t sad that he doesn't have children of his own, but makes up for it 
by =aintaining close friendships that have lasted for =ecades. 
His chariblae instincts have =een honed over many years and his advice and judgment has been =nvaluable in several 
instances. 
His =bility to explain complex derivatives or concepts on the bleeding edge =1 science in layman's terms is part of his 
teaching =ene. 
I have met many people who =riticize those who maintain a friendship with Jeffrey, and a group =hose opinions are 
impervious to change , however, in the vast =ajority of cases , it is with those that have not had the opportunity =o sit
