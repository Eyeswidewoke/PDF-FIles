hi jeffrey, 
sorry about i wanted to go in new york and stay tiil after christmas eve.. i thought nobody is 
going to be here until beginning of january. 
i thought you know about this... a few days ago 'asked 
me when do we want to leave for 
christmas because she wanted to book our tickets, and then yesterday brice asked me when do 
i want to come back..so i told him begining ofjanuary..i didnt know that you dont know about 
it. sorry. 
sincerely talking, i would like to take a brake..i was here for a month. 
if i would have had one more person working in the master bedroom beside my girlfriend, it 
would have been done by now the room and the vestibule but i couldnt find someone else 
available for this period. and i didnt concentrate into master bedroom because they told me 
that is going to take more time for finishing the master bathroom, and even i would have 
finished with venetian plaster, you wouldnt be able to use the master bedroom untill the 
bathroom will be done. 
thats why i worked in cabana no 1, to be done and then you can use that. 
anyway, i finished today the bathroom in cabana no 1 and looks very good with the white 
counter top.. you will see. so now if the painters will paint the doors and the crown molding 
white, that will be done. 
cabana no 2 is done too after the painters will paint the ceiling. so no 1 and no 2 are almost 
done. 
cabana no 3..sarah is giung to show me the design tomorrow morning. 
for master bedroom i think to finish the room and the vestibule i need like 5 days, and 3-4 days 
for the other 2 small rooms. 
my girlfriend put three coats of venetian plaster in the big room in master bedroom and two 
coats in vestibule, so the room needs one more coat maybe two here and there , and the 
vestibule 2-3 coats, then the design, and after that two coats of wax and then burnishing, then 
there are those two small rooms needs the entire process. 
sorry my girlfriend cant stay longer, she has schedule a grafic design job ..she has to be in new 
york next week and shes going to be busy for a while with that. 
maybe i can bring another friend in January, so he can work in master bedroom while 
doing 
the cabana no 3., so then we can finish before january 15th both. 
so now i ask you because nobody asked you before.can i take a brake until beginning of january? 
even i go for christmas and come back monday, then will be only three days of work, tuesday, 
wed, and thursday. karren told me that friday nobody is going to be at the island.
