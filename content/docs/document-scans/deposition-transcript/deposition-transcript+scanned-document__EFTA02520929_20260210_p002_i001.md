Thank you. 
I'm more than happy to turn this over to you. Any fee you want is fine. That isn't an issue for me at all. Or if you 
don't want to be involved that is fine too. I would rather be friends more than anything. 
I'd like you to be involved. I just want you to understand a little more about the situation. It is more nuanced 
than a money negotiation i think. 
We've both done lots of contracts and have both been more involved with lawyers tons more than we would 
have liked. But in very different ways and with different business situations. Together we bring almost too much 
experience. :) 
For me, the currency in this negotiation isn't money. Steve doesn't care about the money because he knows I 
am not motivated by the money. The most important thing for Steve is foreclosing options for me. That is why he did 
the negative stuff about me. The second most important thing is just feeling like he won. That means he gets to brag 
about something. Me being a vc is a victory for him. Me being a startup CEO is a victory. Samsung is a clean loss. 
I have been part of a dozen lawsuits filed after Microsoft people went to competitors. It is nasty, public, and 
ultimately Microsoft prevailed in all of them. Either the person backed down or ended up so tarnished they were 
ineffective. The suits are filed regardless of the work--"inevitable leakage of trade secrets". 
PR is part of foreclosing options. People do remember pr. Read about "Kai Fu Lee". He was branded ineffective 
and then left google as ineffective. He was a traitor then and is now a traitor to China. Maybe he is all of those in 
reality, but he was also a leading Carnegie Melon computer scientist. 
This goes back to the 80's and is always done. Senior people leave and there is a lawsuit if they go to a 
competitor. Always. 
If I choose to be a manager of people, especially a large group, then that group will know about me almost 
exclusively through what they read about me. I don't get a chance to charm them. And because of the lag time from 
start to releasing a new product it means i have to change an organization and manage it with a cloud of doubt or worse. 
Getting the most out of a team becomes impossible. That's the failure cycle. It is real. 
Managing a large team when they get all of their information about their manager from the web or launching a 
product when the press thinks they know you is all impossibly hard with bad "personal pr". 
The "sightings" are real. Just like the conference I signed up for this is what impacts negotiation. I do believe in 
sharing that with counsel which might be different between us. Both ways can work (or not). 
But the truth is people went straight to Steve and Steve went straight to brad. Just like how steve fired off panic 
mail after i signed up to speak at the conference. 
It was a "material" event. Samsung is, in Steve's words, "our new biggest competitor". Microsoft depends on 
hardware and only two companies that make hardware are executing--apple and Samsung. Lenovo steals windows and 
all the others from hp to dell to asus are betting on android big. 
I don't think I have been flip flopping or erratic. I have been frustrated at jays lack of engagement after the New 
York meeting. I think this is just like your frustration with his worries. I have no worries not closing but dragging it out 
isn't good for anyone since everything that happens in public changes the negotiation. Even Windows Blue(next release) 
gives Steve more confidence he doesn't need to signs this. 
His second concern is me stealing people. That's why he wants a gag order.
