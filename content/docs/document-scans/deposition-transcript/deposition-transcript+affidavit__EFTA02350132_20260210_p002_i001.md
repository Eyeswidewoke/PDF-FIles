True. I have no excuses. The only thing I can tell you is that I'm t=ying to do 
better by learning from my mistakes in order to not repeat them= I've waisted my time by going to parties instead of 
being serious. Ev=rything was confused in my mind and I didn't really know what path to =ake, it's very easy to get lost 
when you are young, specially into fak= illusions. Still now, I'm trying to understand myself and who I am. l=believe it 
takes time and it's different from person to person. Now li=tle by little I've started to focus more. I'm starting to 
understa=d real life, what are my priorities and things that really matter. Here ar= some actual facts: I've started to earn 
some money ( which I Hve never did before ) which I believe it's already a small accomplish=ent. I did some babysitting 
and after 2 paid trial days ( 250 euros per da= ) shooting for Vogue and Dior, I've got hired by one of the best fash=on 
photographers called Paolo Roversi to be his assistant ( paid job ). l&=39;m very happy and excited to work and learn 
from him which is better tha= any photography school. I'm ready to work as long as I need to in ord=r to build my skills 
and stand out in that field. I think I've achieve= some results and gained some value if I compare myself 2 years ago from 
n=w. Thanks to you I had the possibility to make many interesting experience= like Ferragamo in China and Alaia in Paris. 
Even though I didn't=get hired from them, those experiences allowed me to understand what I lik= and what I don't like 
and shaped in part the person I am. Thanks to t=e Alaia internship and my passion for photography I am now working 
wi=h Paolo Roversi doing what I really like. However even though I work hard =nd I am paid I cannot fully support myself 
to pay a rent and my living in =aris. I really would like to continue through this path, I feel it's t=e right one but I need 
your help, your support and your advices because I =annot make it by myself. 
I promise I will use my money wis=ly without throwing it away into futilities like 
parties and holidays beca=se I want to grow and build my skills, my carrier and hopefully my future =elf.
