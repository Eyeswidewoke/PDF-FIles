Twitter's net loss narrowed to $136.7 million, or 21 cents 
a share. Profit excluding certain items was 7 cents, compared 
with the 4 cents analysts estimated. 
Bigger Rivals 
On a conference call, executives quashed any initial 
optimism generated by the report by confronting Twitter's 
underlying problem: It's much smaller than the competition. The 
company today reported 316 million monthly users, while Facebook 
Inc.'s social network has 1.4 billion. Twitter recently started 
counting feature-phone users in emerging markets as part of its 
tally. without that extra boost, Twitter's user count was 304 
million. 
Noto said Twitter changed its tone on the call because 
growth slowed so meaningfully, the company wanted to explain how 
it's working to address the deceleration. 
"In the past we may not have had the growth that investors 
wanted us to have, but it was still quite strong. And this 
quarter we barely had any growth." 
The company is working to introduce a marketing campaign to 
explain the value of using Twitter to the masses, Noto said. One 
problem, though, is that Twitter doesn't have a head of 
marketing. Noto said a search is wrapping up, with some good 
candidates being reviewed. 
Attracting Users 
In the time since Twitter went public in November 2013, 
growth has stagnated while rival social applications, including 
WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger, drew hundreds of millions more 
people. In response, the company has increased its focus on 
attracting people who don't have accounts. 
One current plan, internally named Project Lightning, is 
meant to create channels for whatever is happening live, 
including videos running simultaneously with what's showing on 
television. The goal is to bring in visitors who might want to 
experience a live event or watch news unfold in real time. It 
could also open up new opportunities for advertisers. 
Still, in the past year Twitter has made many promises 
about new tools that haven't yet contributed to its quarterly 
results. Investors are concerned that Dorsey won't provide 
meaningful change at a company in need of a shakeup. 
Twitter said third-quarter sales will be $545 million to 
1560 million, in line with analysts' average projection of 
$556.6 million. For the full year, the company forecast revenue 
of 52.2 billion to 52.27 billion, compared with a previous 
company estimate of $2.17 billion to 52.27 billion. 
The social-media company has faced some turnover internally 
amid the CEO transition. Today, two product executives announced 
their departures. Todd Jackson, who helped Twitter debut its 
Highlights product, is leaving for Dropbox Inc., while Christian 
oestlien, who helped drive growth, is going to Google's vouTube.
