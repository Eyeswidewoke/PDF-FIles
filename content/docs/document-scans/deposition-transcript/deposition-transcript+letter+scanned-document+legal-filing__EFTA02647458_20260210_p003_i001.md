Notwithstanding=your statement that "As for the claim about concern for my later year=, that has been thoroughly 
refuted" it has not been refuted in the context of my trusteeship and it remains my=duty to consider distributions in 
light of the possibility that you will h=ve a reasonable need for distributions from the trust for many more years,=and 
perhaps in increasing amounts, depending on your circumstances in the future. 
I am approaching =0. I'm not going to live forever. You know how much money =s in the trust. How could there 
possibly be a concern about it being=depleted? You know my lifestyle very well. Perhaps you recall =he meeting in my 
office when you explained to me that I was going to have =o cut back on expenses, specifically to sell my boat, as I did. 
None=of this makes any sense. 
=span>5. =C24) As for the specifics=of disclosure, what I need to consider is (a) what your income was in 2017= since 
that was the basis for the tax payments you seek to have reimbursed, (b) what your income is likely to be this year an= 
going forward, (c) what your expenses were in 2017 and are likely to be i= 2018, and (d) whether any of your income (or 
other resources) are being u=ed for purposes that the trust cannot support (such as gifts to third parties). 4>=A0So far, 
Rich has provided me with some rough information about your 2017=expenses. There are some gaps in that 
information, but nothing that =an't be cleared up pretty easily (I think). Rich has also as=ured me that you have not 
made any gifts that have diminished your resources an= I assume you would confirm that to me. What I don't have at 
this point is enough informat=on about your income, so that I can consider what the gap is between your =xpenses and 
your income, which is the gap the trusts might help to close u=. With respect to your income in 2017, all I can see is that 
your income tax obligations seem to be much higher than they were pre=iously. I'm assuming that reflects a jump in 
income from (i)=the profit made on the sale of the condominium, and (ii) large withdrawals=from your IRA. If you want 
to provide me with more information (bearing in mind what I noted in item #3, above) then inf=rmation about your 
2017 income and what your income is likely to be this y=ar is what I most need. 
There is a very simple reason for the income tax o=ligations. The depletion of the IRA that I reviewed again above 
impo=ed a huge tax burden, which we were still attempting to deal with in 2017.=C24> After Harry's refusal to release 
some funds from the trust to pa= the exorbitant taxes resulting from what was happening, I of course had t= withdraw 
funds from the IRA to pay taxes on the whole estate, incurring a=new exorbitant tax burden. Despite some small relief 
later from the =rust after I had repeatedly pointed this out, it carried over through the =017 tax bill. So for that reason, 
taxes were extremely high. T=at curious episode is at last finally over, leaving many questions unresol=ed about what 
was happening while I was paying little attention, relying o= advisers to ensure that matters were proceeding 
appropriately.=/font> 
=C240 
I hope this is helpful an= will wait to hear more from you and/or Rich.
