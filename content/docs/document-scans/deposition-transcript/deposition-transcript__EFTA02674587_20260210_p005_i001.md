THOMAS MANN: Watergate Bob Woodward has written... 
NORMAN ORNSTEIN: Now the post-Watergate Bob Woodward. 
THOMAS MANN: ...written a book about these negotiations and did a lot of talking to the Republicans. 
And ended up saying Boehner and Obama reached a deal and Obama walked away from it. Well, Eric 
Cantor, in his interview with Ryan Lizza of The New Yorker couple of months ago basically corrected him. 
He said, Well, I talked to Boehner and said it really wouldn't be a good idea to reach a deal now because 
then the issue evaporates, the president gets the credit, and he has a better chance of being reelected. 
Better to keep it alive and fight it out in the in the election. 
BILL MOVERS: And it didn't pay off for them, did... 
THOMAS MANN: It didn't pay off at all. 
BILL MOVERS: Except they held the House but it didn't pay off for them in the Senate. He lost two seats 
in the Senate. Didn't pay off for him in winning the presidency? 
NORMAN ORNSTEIN: It was a, call it a riverboat gamble, I suppose you could say. Because what Cantor 
said in that interview was. if we win it all, then we don't have to compromise. They didn't: but the reaction 
wasn't, all right, now we have to compromise. Instead it was, we're still not going to compromise. 
BILL MOVERS: You've said you have some hope for the Senate. There is some seeming to have to 
someone from afar movement on immigration. Is that must be hopeful to you? 
THOMAS MANN: It is, but it's so different than everything else. The reason there is movement on 
immigration is because Republicans have such a powerful incentive to move on immigration. 
BILL MOVERS: Because they lost the Latino vote...politics. 
THOMAS MANN: They're on the verge of being marginalized in presidential politics. They are losing 
overwhelmingly the Latinos, Asian Americans. other immigrant groups the young voters. The growing 
parts of the electorate are moving away from the Republicans to the Democrats. They have a reason to 
do it. Hardball politics, not grand, bipartisan consensus. And they've put it together well. It's a group of 
Republicans and Democrats who are working out this bill. Obama has... 
BILL MOVERS: In the Senate, right? 
THOMAS MANN: In the Senate. Obama stayed off to the side, as they requested, because it's very hard 
for Marco Rubio to support anything the president's campaigning for. So his absence is what they needed 
to move this along. 
NORMAN ORNSTEIN: But we shouldn't just focus on the members themselves. There are, in the House, 
at least a few people who'd like to work to solve some of these problems and Boehner among them, I 
think. And... 
BILL MOVERS: You really believe that? 
NORMAN ORNSTEIN: ...some others well, I think, you know, he's sees himself as the Speaker of the 
House. And some of it is political as well. He's being pushed by other forces. But it's really important that 
we focus as much on the outside forces as the inside ones. 
BILL MOVERS: Such as? 
NORMAN ORNSTEIN: Well, when the fiscal cliff debate came up and we get this bill coming over with 89 
votes in the Senate, and you had around that time, before those negotiations, Boehner trying to get a little
