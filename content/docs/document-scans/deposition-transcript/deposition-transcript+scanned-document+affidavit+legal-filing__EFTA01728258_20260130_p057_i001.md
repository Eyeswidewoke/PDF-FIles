The Designer Who Liked Models - New York Times

newspapers like The Hindustan Times and Calcutta Times follow every development with interest. 
So who is Anand Jon? A rapist? Or a mark? To some he is a garden variety arriviste, an overeager cad, 
who crossed the line into criminal territory when his sense of entitlement overwhelmed his good sense. 
To others he is a struggling design talent, who played by the same elastic set of rules that govern 
everything else in the celebrity world and fashion industry -- except he was caught. 
"We all know that when success comes very young at a very high level, people somehow lose a part of 
their compass," said Catherine Saxton, a longtime fashion publicist in New York, whose clients have 
included Dennis Basso, but not Mr. Anand. "He was flying in a very high crowd and flying in that crowd 
for quite some time." On the other hand, "there are a lot of young girls who want to be in fashion, who 
want to be in shows, who want to be photographed -- who want it," she continued. "It's very easy to be 
subverted." 
She added: "He had the sizzle. If you were a wannabe, he was a great coattail to ride on." 
IT was a single sexual encounter, around midnight on March 4, that led to the series of accusations 
against Mr. Jon. According to the police report and to lawyers involved in the case, the designer had 
been corresponding on the Internet for months with a petite blond 19-year-old woman in Seattle. She 
was a lingerie model. He was interested in getting to know her. She sent pictures. He said Los Angeles 
Fashion Week was coming, and did she want to visit? She did. 
"Hi babe," the young woman wrote in an e-mail message on March 2, according to Mr. Richards. "Here's 
my e-mail to send my information and confirmation number to. Miss you and can't wait to see you. Love 
and kisses." 
She arrived by taxi at his Beverly Hills apartment around 11 p.m., according to the police report. She 
went upstairs, entered Mr. Jon's bedroom and changed into yoga pants and a T-shirt. She sat on the bed. 
He kissed her. She said she was menstruating and asked him to stop, putting up her arms. 
"Is this the only reason you brought me here?" she asked, according to the report. 
"Not the only thing," he responded. 
Then, the report says, he forced her to have oral sex. He proceeded to have intercourse with her, but she 
first asked that he "at least use a condom." He declined. 
Afterward she went to clean up. Mr. Jon sat and meditated. 
The following day, after going out to ealwith two of Mr. Jon's assistants, the model went to a rape 
center in Santa Monica, Calif., which sent her to the police station in Beverly Hills, where the sexual 
encounter occurred. Mr. Jon was arrested the next day, and an indictment soon followed. 
"Why would she change into pajamas?" asked Mr. Richards, Mr. Jon's lawyer. "Why didn't she leave 
when she sees there's no bed for her? Why didn't she punch him in the face?" He noted that there were 
no signs of physical trauma. "My client is 5-foot-4 and 130 pounds. He's a thin Gandhi-type guy. He 
can't overpower anybody. Any girl would kick his butt. It's not even a close call. That's what's so silly 
about this." 
But what struck the police in Beverly Hills, explained Ms. Robison, the prosecutor's spokeswoman, was
