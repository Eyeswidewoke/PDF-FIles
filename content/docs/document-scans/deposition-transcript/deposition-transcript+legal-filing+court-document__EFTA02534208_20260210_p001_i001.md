I miss you. You rock. You have no idea how much good stuff you gave me. It&=39;s amazing. I just wake up and 
have money fall on me. I don't feel l=ke I am working at all. I am very excited to work though. Its fun. I love =he people in 
my life. It would be nice if you were one of them, but maybe =hen you get organized we can spend more time together. 
I think I met my match, a guy I work with. I want to mary him. He is the on=y person that is not intimidated by 
me and I can pitch and catch with. I a=so met an amazing guy in Palm Spring, he is very much like you. The only 
d=fference is he talks! How cool is that? And I can eat him for breakfast. H= is totally crazy about me. He said the way he 
feels when he is with me is=more close than with his wife of 15 years. He is shocked that someone is a=le to understand 
and connect with him. I
 it. To me its like a nice carrot for you. The best part is that I found a replacement to meet 
my needs =hat is very kosher. 
I have one more guy. He is a player and seems like a jerk but is actually a= amazing guy. I gave him my date w 
destiny notebook and he was so grateful= He told me he completely redid his personal and business goals. That is s= 
awesome. 
Ok One more guy. He is russian and we had the best sex ever. His name is Mi=hael. I thought I really liked him, 
but then he started playing hard to ge=. That turns me off. I want guys who are crazy about me and appreciate me,=not 
the ones I have to run after. I had enough of that. The poor man is dr=ving himself nuts. He is trying to get hard to get, 
but is playing all by =imself because I really don't care. It's amusing. Well at least he=can introduce me to cute girls. His 
behavior reminds me of Henry. He becam= so uncomfortable after I cut him off. He feels like he has no hold on me 
=hatsoever and he doesn't know what I will do in the future, if I will =ive him the same attention or not. 
So this is the game plan... I think I found the husband. I know what I want=in terms of work. This year I will try to 
perfect my deal closing system, =ind out what I need to open a brokerage and set up referral streams. Get P=olo by the 
balls, I'd like to manage his life maybe. I'd like to d= a cleanse, improve my diet and work out consistently and travel. 
Also I h=ve so many unusual experience I like to write them down. May make good sho=t stories. 
Also I am surprised that I am getting much sharper and smarter. I think it =s because I have sex a lot. Tony 
Robbins said there was experiment with mo=keys and they learned 50 times faster when their pleasure center was 
stimu=ated. :) 
Also I am very happy emotionally. I go between 0 and 100 every day. Sometim=s I feel nothing, I just work, other 
times I am able to feel love and joy =nd excitement. What a great combination. It's like I am able to turn i= off and on 
instantly.
