brain as a computer? as silly as artificial in=elligence., The simple example I teach re quantum is whe= i try to 
decide should i order fish or meat. for the moment before = order ( as you an I agree ms before i even am concious of 
ordering. ) both choices like schroedingers cat exist as a superpost=oned wave function that collapses and a choice is 
made. = yes i am taking liberties.. the students you referred to you=suggest are working on computers, not very odd 
that they might see you I language conforming to their pre perceptions

I will take your word that you share my thick skin f=r criticism and share a strange pleasure in learning, 
even if it mea=s having to accept that some formerly closely held beliefs might need strong correction. I have no 
particular knowl=dge re politics or history, so I will never offer an opinion. =owever re mathematics and or money , I 
feel on strong ground. =hat being said, thought puzzles in the paper are brilliant and=insightful. the mathematical 
descriptions lack rigor, and the metaphors suffer =rom the common science limitation of trying to describe things using 
the e=gineering metaphors or the tools of the moment.ex. The =uman or its brain as a computer ., set theory . It was 
popular in the early 20th as you know to describe the body as an elect=ic machine.. the mathematics used today in 
quantum show =ore promise , as it attempts to describe things that appear counter intuit=ve. or difficult to comprehend 
, ( your displacement conjecture) 
your simple X and Y, Merge, is quit= naive and unfortunately incorrect.
