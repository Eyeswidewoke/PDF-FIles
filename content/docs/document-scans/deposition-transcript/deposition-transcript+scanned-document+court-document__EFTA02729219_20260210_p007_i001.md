waterway to the Palm Beach County state attorney's office, but the state attorney apparently saw the 
main witnesses as weak. One had run away from home, lied about her age, and bragged about her ass on 
MySpace. Another had a drug arrest and had stolen from Victoria's Secret The police wanted numerous 
felony charges against Epstein as well as charges against Haley Robson and Sarah Kellen. Then they 
heard that the state attorney was preparing a deal with Epstein giving him five years on probation and 
sending him for psychiatric evaluation. The police chief, Michael Reiter, accused the state attorney of 
bending over backward for a rich man and then turned the matter over to the FBI. 
Finally, in July 2006, the Palm Beach County state attorney's office handed down one indictment of 
Epstein on a felony count of soliciting prostitution. There is no reference to minors in the indictment. 
Reiter was enraged. He released a letter he had sent out to five underage girls that read "1 do not feel that 
justice has been sufficiently served." 
Epstein's lawyer said that Reiter was out of control, but the police chief was having an effect The U.S. 
Attorney's office began an investigation, and the dream team added another member, Kenneth Starr, the 
former Clinton prosecutor. 
One of Epstein's friends told me, "He thinks there's an anti-Semitic conspiracy against him in Palm 
Beach. He's convinced of that Maybe it's a defense mechanism." Palm Beach was historically a bastion 
of Gentile privilege. Vanderbilt and Glendinning and Dillman and Warburton are still engraved on the 
public fountains, and the Everglades Club with its espaliered trees and brass plates reading private seems 
stuck in the time of the Gentlemen's Agreement. Yet the anti-Semitic charge disturbed Jews whom I 
asked about it in Palm Reach. Michael Resnick, rabbi at the oldest synagogue on the island, Temple 
Emanu-El (circa the sixties), says he strongly doubts that Epstein is a modern Dreyfus. "There's no way, 
shape, or form that you can say that Palm Beach is a bastion with tespat to religion. Individuals, yes. 
And there are some places that it is not an asset to be a Jew." Once Palm Beach tried to keep synagogues 
from opening. There are now four on the little island, including an Orthodox shul started by Slim-Fast
founder Danny Abraham. Jose L.ambiet, gossip columnist for the Palm Beach Post, says, "Half my -2-6,O 
sources on the island are Jewish socialites." n u

Of course, that might be evidence. But other details in the police narrathiveljseclimilito derive more from je tot )IA 
Edgar Allan Poe's psychological tragedies than from Philip Roth's sociological comedies. Epstein is 
licensed in Florida to catty a concealed weapon—he has a Glock—and a shower on the first floor was 
given ova to a gun safe. One girl said his chest was so pumped up he appeared to be on steroids. He had 
a Harley next to the many black Mercedeses, but his Florida license was expired. Now he was licensed 
in the Virgin Islands and gave his "permanent residence" as the same address as Island Yachts. 
Notwithstanding the room on the first floor with floor-to-ceiling books, the general aura is cold and 
joyless and lonely, that of a man in his fifties denying death by giving himself over completely to the 
sensual life, with the help of Brit, Alexis, Rhiannon, Sherry, Nicole, Haley, and Joanna.
