Epstein Accuser Alleged In Unsealed Deposition That Maxwell Was His Partner In 
Abuse. 
The Washington Post (7/31, Helderman, Jacobs, 14.2M) reports, "A woman who has accused 
deceased financier Jeffrey Epstein of years-long abuse that began when she was a teenager 
alleged in a newly unsealed deposition that his former partner, Ghislaine Maxwell, was both his 
chief accomplice and a participant in the sexual abuse." Maxwell, "who was arrested earlier this 
month and charged with trafficking minors, had fought unsuccessfully to keep the court 
documents under seal." The Post adds, "The unsealed court documents stem from a defamation 
suit she settled for an undisclosed sum in 2017 with... 
who has alleged that she 
was forced to have sex with Epstein and his friends. She has claimed that Maxwell recruited her 
to serve as a traveling masseuse for Epstein after spotting her working a summer job as a 
locker room attendant 20 years ago at Mar-a-Lago, President Trump's private estate. 
deposition was among several hundred pages of records unsealed by judicial order" Thursday. 
The AP (7/31, Neumeister) reports from New York, 'claimed 
in the suit and other 
litigation that Maxwell recruited her in 2000 to be a sexual servant to Epstein. She said the 
couple subsequently pressured her into having sex with numerous rich or notable men, 
including Britain's Prince Andrew, U.S. politicians, wealthy entrepreneurs, a famous scientist 
and fashion designer. Among the newly released documents were emails Maxwell and Epstein 
exchanged in January 2015, when 
allegations were getting a new round of media 
attention." The AP adds, "One email, sent from Epstein's email address but written in Maxwell's 
voice, appeared to be a draft a statement or set of talking points for Maxwell to use in 
defending herself. It said she had been the target of `false allegations of impropriety and 
offensive behavior that I abhor and have never ever been party to."
