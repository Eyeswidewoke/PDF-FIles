Sto=ies like MZ's are all too common. Our society has been using jails and prisons as a dumping ground for the mentally 
ill and those addicted to drugs. These human beings don't belong in prison, they belong in treatment, yet we've pushed 
=hem into cages and denied them their humanity. Is it shocking that these same valuable citizens, like my friend MZ, 
emerge wo=se off than when they went in? Let's face it: America is addicted to mass incarceration, and it's making our 
society sick. 
Our habit of lock=ng away human beings is a particularly unseemly kind of addiction for a country that prides itself on 
freedom, especially when the United States incarcerates more of its citizens than Ch=na, Russia, or Iran. Right now 
America has about 5 percent of the world's population but is responsible for 25 per=ent of the world's incarcerated 
population. In other words, one out of four people in prison today are inside U.S. jails a=d penitentiaries. That is nearly 
2.4 million human beings — an obscene number. 
In America, it is black men, mo=e than anyone else, who suffer from our dependence on mass incarceration. Currently, 
black men are six tim=s more likely to be imprisoned in federal and state prisons and local jails t=an white men. This 
horrifying racial disparity comes in part from the war on drugs, which has been devastating communities of color for the 
past four decades. Although blacks and w=ites use illegal drugs at roughly the same rates, African-Americans make up 
nearly 40 percent of t=ose put away for drug offenses in state or federal prison, even though we only =ake up 13 percent 
of the U.S. population. 
<=span> 
We need to realize that these statistics re=resent human beings. These men are someone's child, someone's parent. 
Someone loves them and still wants the best for them.=These men have dreams of being great, too. Ruining people's 
lives for small, nonviolent offenses tied to drug use, drug ad=iction, or mental illness is not the way to go. Health 
problems are health problems= not criminal justice problems. It's by the grace of God that I didn'=t get into more serious 
trouble. If I had, there's no way I'd be where I am to=ay. 
=span style="font-size:12ptline-height:107%;font-family:Georgia,serif">T=ere are far too many people of color with 
bright futures that have been relegated to our prison systems. However, instead of being =rovided with opportunities to 
express themselves or their creativity safely or getting t=e right support, they make mistakes which cost them dearly. 
The costs of thos= mistakes are high and these men pay with their futures. Once people h=ve done hard time, the world 
closes in on them. It's damn near impossible to get a job. Depend=ng on where you live, you likely can't vote. The 
possibility of becoming a productive citizen is foreclosed on by a system that denies those who have served their time 
with another chance. Instead, they're forever seen as ex-cons. 
And don't forget the huge cost of confinement= The U.S. spent $80 billion in 2010 on locking up people on the local, 
state, and federal level, which could be better spent on education, health care, or simply get=ing at-risk people the 
counseling they need so they don't fall back into ad=iction and petty crime. We have spent the last 40 years stuffing our
