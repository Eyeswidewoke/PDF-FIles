example.. Ugly and bitter as it is, I suspect the b=st course now is not to stir the pot by raising the issue publicly, 
openin= the door to charges and accusations that can no doubt be answered in the =ourt of logic and fairness -- but 
that's not the public domain, where =nnuendo and suspicion and accusation reign. 
Anyway, for=what it's worth, that's the way it looks to me, in part on the bas=s 
of experience. 
The great work that you have bee= doing speaks for itself. My feeling is that 
you should keep at it, =nd simply develop a thick skin to fend off whatever ugliness breaks throug= now and then, 
diminishing over time.

The critics are wrong on =he facts and the law. They also ignore a fact going to 
the heart of fundam=ntal fairness: In the decade since paying his debt to society, =effrey Epstein has led a life 
characterized by responsible citizenship, nu=erous acts of generosity and good deeds. 
Here are the true key facts: Jeffrey Eps=ein, a successful self-made businessman 
with no prior criminal history wha=soever, engaged in illegal conduct that amounted to solicitation of p=ostitution. That 
conduct was wrong and a violation of Flor=da state law. Although no coercion, violence, alcohol, drugs or the =ike were 
involved, some of the women he paid were under the age of 18= Those facts were carefully assessed by experienced 
state sex c=ime prosecutors who aggressively enforce state criminal laws. No one=turned a blind eye to potential 
offenses to the public order. To the=contrary, the Palm Beach State Attorney's Office conducted an extensiv= fifteen-
month investigation, led by the chief of the Sex Crimes Division.=C2Q Mr. Epstein was then indicted by the state grand 
jury on a single fe=ony count of solicitation of prostitution.
