Table of Contra' 
activity, and to maintain transaction records. Our subsidiary Money Network Financial LLC provides prepaid access for various open loop prepaid 
programs for which it is the program manager and therefore must meet the requirements of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, the agency 
that enforces the BSA. 
We are also subject to anti-corruption laws and regulations, including the FCPA and other laws, that prohibit the making or offering of 
improper payments to foreign government officials and political figures and includes anti-bribery provisions enforced by the Department of Justice 
and accounting provisions enforced by the SEC. The FCPA has a broad reach and requires maintenance of appropriate records and adequate 
internal controls to prevent and detect possible FCPA violations. Many other jurisdictions where we conduct business also have similar 
anticorruption laws and regulations. We have policies, procedures, systems. and controls designed to identify and address potentially impermissible 
transactions under such laws and regulations. 
We arc also subject to certain economic and trade sanctions programs that are administered by OFAC. which prohibit or restrict 
transactions to or from or dealings with specified countries, their governments, and in certain circumstances, their nationals, and with individuals 
and entities that are specially-designated nationals of those countries. narcotics traffickers, and terrorists or terrorist organizations. Other group 
entities may be subject to additional local sanctions requirements in other relevant jurisdictions. 
Similar anti-money laundering and counter terrorist financing and proceeds of crime laws apply to movements of currency and 
payments through electronic transactions and to dealings with persons specified in lists maintained by the country equivalents to OFAC lists in 
several other countries and require specific data retention obligations to be observed by intermediaries in the payment process. Our businesses in 
those jurisdictions are subject to those data retention obligations. In the European Union, for example, certain of our businesses are subject to 
requirements under the Third Money Laundering Directive (2005/60/EC) (MLD3) as implemented in relevant European Union member states. 
MLD3 was repealed and replaced by the Fourth Money Laundering Directive ((EU) 2015/849) (MLD4), when the latter entered into force on June. 
25 2015. European Union member states are required to implement MLD4 into national law by June 26, 2017. 
Money Transmission and Payment Instrument Licensing and Regulations 
We arc subject to various U.S. federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations governing money transmission and the issuance and sale 
of payment instruments, including some of our prepaid products. 
In the United States, most states license money transmitters and issuers of payment instruments. Many states exercise authority over the 
operations of our services related to money transmission and payment instruments and, as part of this authority, subject us to periodic examinations. 
Many states require, among other things, that proceeds from money transmission activity and payment instrument sales be invested in high-quality 
marketable securities before the settlement of the transactions. Such licensing laws also may cover matters such as regulatory approval of consumer 
forms, consumer disclosures and the filing of periodic reports by the licensee, and require the licensee to demonstrate and maintain levels of net 
worth. Many states also require money transmitters, issuers of payment instruments, and their agents to comply with federal and/or state anti-
money laundering laws and regulations. 
Escheat Regulations 
We are subject to unclaimed or abandoned property (escheat) laws both in the United States and abroad that require us to turn over to 
certain government authorities the property of others held by us that has been unclaimed for a specified period of time such as, in the Integrates' 
Payment Systems business, payment instruments that have not been presented for payment or. in the Global Business Solutions segment. account 
balances that cannot be returned to a merchant following discontinuation of its relationship with us. A number of our subsidiaries hold property 
subject to escheat laws and we have an ongoing program to comply with those laws. We are subject to audit by individual U.S. states with regard to 
our escheatment practices.
