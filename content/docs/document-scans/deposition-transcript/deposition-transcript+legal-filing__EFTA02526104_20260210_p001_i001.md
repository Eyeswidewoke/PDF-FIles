Re: 
you didn't constantly bitch about 
etc, you didn't feel a= if you were entitled to ask where when why„ , you 
didn't feel it nec=sary to make others feel uncomfortable or tell me you would do things , pr=mise to do things and then 
, not. you didn't feel able to putrify the =ouse, and expent others to clean and ignore it. you and I had fun„ I had =y naps 
, my 
my 
 and you didn't get upset, and then mope a=ound the whole day. I didn;t have to explain who was 
comiong and why. i di=n't have to listen to " I called ten times and no one picked up..=You didn;t spend the majority of 
your time shopping for yourself„ I don&=39;t care about things„ if you think its the dirty carpet, instead of the=total 
lack of thought , you are simply deluding yourself. , At that time i= you recall, not one person did not coment on how 
nice it was to have some=ne who said little and was pleasant.. it then turned into jealousy 
russians. 
froge.,, , you did less and less, and expected more a=d more„ . do you think if you crashed the car, i would give a shit.. 
abou= the car, if howver you told me that it would be better if i have to an=wer my own phones than have someone in 
my own house that helps out„ that =s disturbing. I have not asked for you to fix it alone„ but i have =sked you to do the 
monst minimal of things.. things that you continuall= refuse to do.. the flowers and the carpet ,are the results of your 
self f=cus. The last time you had your issue with the dog, was it becuase of the =ardwood floor.. I think not.. It was the 
total lack of responsiblity

Jeffrey, I can see I have a part in this unpleasant situation but I can'=t fix it alone. You seem so unhappy and let 
little things ruin your day= even a week.. I was so taken by you when I met you because I never knew a=yone so easy 
going, carefree and fun and it was wonderful. You didn't =et anything get to you and had an attitude that things are just 
things and=people are what matters... 
I remember I broke a bike and ruined the stone border by the gym when I fis= came to the island and I felt 
terrible about it. You just made a joke and=never mentioned it again..chances of that reaction from you now are close 
=0 0. I don't know if you are just recovering from jail now or this is =he new you but to see you shake with rage bacause 
of dead flowers still in=the pot or a dirty carpet is very disturbing. It is understandable but it =s how most men would 
react, not you.. In the scheme of things this is so p=tty and the reactions are so out of proportion. You will have to be 
misera=le all day if you don't pick your battles.. I would know ;-)
