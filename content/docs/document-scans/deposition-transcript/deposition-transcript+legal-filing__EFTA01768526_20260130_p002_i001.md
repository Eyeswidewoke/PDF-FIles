t
:
: You told me to do so 
: I did not mean it...l was very frustrated and upset 
You wished me good luck with that 
: When you came back all dressed up from meeting a potential future husband....my whole face got 
red 
WU
I: U saw how upset I was 
:  know that I loved only you - but I needed help, not you being upset at me. My visa situation is not 
my fault, it was a problem that needed to be solved. 
: I love u so mu'
: See some good in me 
: I thought if you were really sure I was your soulmate and your future - u would help. I love u and I m 
sure you love me, but perhaps u were not sure about future with me. Otherwise, I don't understand 
•
: As I said you were ready to take financial responsibility, but not emotional. 
: We should sit down and have a heart to heart talk 
: I can come see u next week in paris 
: Or week after that 
: And yes - I would go live with u in a little house in the woods, but if the woods requires a special entry 
permit that only you have - how can i do that? 
If u make me truly believe that you would...I will marry you 
I have been married once....and when I do it again, it will be forever 
I promise that if I believe you would go live in the little cabin in the woods with me. I will marry you 
and start a family II
: I liked when u cleaned me 
: When u did not cook for me...did not think you were serious 
: Or jewish things....0 seemed not to care 
: Or trying things with other girls 
: I love u 
: I told you that I would learn to cook when I find a good teacher - and I did. And I've been taking my 
Jewish studies very seriously, I did some reading, went to services and have been in touch with my Rabbi. And I told you I 
was very excited about playing with girls. In 1.5 years I proved that I was very serious about you and our future. 
However, I did not get the same certainty from you. Now I do need some time to think. I will talk to you at the end of the 
week and let you know whether we are meeting in Paris. Now I have to believe that you would follow me to the little 
cabin... 
Why would we not meet in paris? 
II
and he has asked 6 times iMhas given me anything? and what did 
give me? - i ignored 
and again blabbing about how special we were, that he never loved or e t ike this about anyone, how i could 
calm him down after a stressful day (also mentioned that i could not hike for many hours - but eventually since i m in 
better shape now - he thinks i could enjoy hiking more; ), that he liked how i invented new things in bed and always 
wanted to try new things and how great it was; etc etc
