Subject Re: 
Hello Jeffrey, finally a letter. 
I found some progress and am very excited about it, even though it's not going to be so easy, all 
right nothing is easy. 
As you know I was working here all this year, of course not so good, because I was excluded 
from my university before my trip to USA, and I didn't have an education, but still. SO, in January 
I found some place to continue my studies and after all application and exam processes, they were 
ready to give me a student loan, (not they, but the representative office in Tashkent) and the 
university begins at March, 28. so it's going to last 4 semesters (half year each) until I (hopefully) 
will graduate. It is in Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur, and it gives 2 diplomas, one is Malaysian and the 
second one in English of Staffordshire university. As far as english education is very expensive, 
they give the same program and diploma, but at much lower prices. The cost of year is 6800 S. 
And there is no visa for Uzbek people to Malaysia, so I am happy to move a little bit forward, 
because this hell what I was seeing here all those months was unbelievable. 
But, nonetheless, I need to cover that loan and my own expenses for accommodation and life, but 
they don't give a right to work there. I have one plan, to ask my friend from NY to help me with 
modelling, you know I was not interested and supportive for that, but it is the only way to have 
some better life. I'm just tired of restricting and limiting myself to a better life because of what-
people-say, parents, etc. But there is a lot of cons there also. But he told that I can have some 
contracts while I study, and even London in summer. THE MAIN good point is that, if I will 
somehow succeed in that, I can get US visa for models HI-B because it will probably cover my 
previous violations and finally I will be happy to come to New York. 
I want your notion about it, how do you think, is it the way I should go, or not. I know nobody 
will tell me the truth as you will (your voice: "GULSUM, TELL THE TRUTH!" appeared in my 
head) :) 
As about us to meet, Jeffrey, dear, I want it always! But, I told you how many problems our 
country causes to us. Every new stupid rule is "better" than previous one. It is very hard to get 
visa for young and single girl here, they just dont give it without reason. But I can visit Malaysia, 
Kazakhstan, Georgia, Russia, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Belarus, Ukraine, and Kyrgyzstan. Much 
easier is with other countries, like Turkey, India, Great Britain etc, but Schengen zone, 
UAE and especially USA is very very hard, and even useless to apply unless you have 
some valuable reason. 
But I think, now it probably should be better, because I will become a student, and in 
embassy it gives them a reason that I will fly back to my studies (country is very afraid 
that single young girl will not come back to the mamaland) so I hope, I will figure 
something out. 
All of all, we'll see. 
Kisses Jeffrey, take care of yourself, I miss you very much and Im verry happy that you 
are a friend of mine.
