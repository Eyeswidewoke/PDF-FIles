to the idea of Turkish media being allowed first and insisted that all the international media 
should be allowed at the same time. Mr. Davutoglu also suggested that the President 
undertake significant legal reforms, based on a draft that Turkey would provide; conduct 
elections for a new Parliament that would draft a new constitution. At the end of the process, 
a referendum would be held. Assad would need to be ready to leave power. He also reiterated 
that Assad would need to make a public speech very soon explaining these measures and 
committing to a specific timeframe. Assad agreed, but asked that Turkey refrain from making 
any announcement before he had a chance to talk to the Beath part and to the opposition. He 
didn't want to look like he was making these reforms under pressure from Turkey. Davutoglu 
and Assad had then agreed on clear roadmap along these lines. The Turks had then been in 
touch with a number of countries, such as US, France, Russia and Egypt, to tell them about 
the agreement and to hold off further measures for a few days. 
For the first few days, Assad had implemented the measures they had agreed to. He 
withdrew the tanks from Hama (the Turkish Ambassador had been able to go and witness it 
for himself); and the media had been allowed in Syria, even to Hama. This had led him to 
make a positive statement. However, since then, there had been reports of tanks being 
deployed to llama again, and of a new operation in Latakia that was even worse than the one 
in Hama. Secretary Clinton and President Obama had been in contact with the Turkish 
Government to inform them that President Obama was about to make a speech on Thursday 
in which he would call for Assad's departure. Prime Minister Erdogan had called President 
Assad to express his concerns about the situation and to encourage him to make his speech as 
soon as possible. Assad said he would talk to Beath on Thursday and make his speech on 
Sunday. The Prime Minister had indicated that Sunday was too late, and that he would not 
have any credibility after Obama had made his speech. 
Foreign Minister Davutoglu said that it would be good if the Secretary-General could 
talk to President Assad to encourage him to make his speech tomorrow [Wednesday). He 
could tell Assad that he had been briefed on the agreed roadmap by Davutoglu, and that the 
pressure in the international community was rising. Davutoglu indicated that if Assad didn't 
make his speech and didn't implement the roadmap, he was worried. Turkey would not stay 
silent anymore. The credibility of the international community was on the line, the Syrian 
people was suffering. Their Ambassador had heard very sad stories when he had visited 
Hama. The human rights situation was very serious throughout Syria. He was also very 
concerned about the attack on Latakia, as it was apparently even worst than the attack on 
Hama (Turkey had sent people there). Davutoglu said he didn't believe any statement or 
information that came out of Syria anymore, as they issued contradictory information. He 
also didn't believe that President Assad knew all the details of all the operations. Davutoglu 
reiterated his concern about the human rights situation throughout the country and 
encouraged the UN to send a mission to the refugee camps that were in Turkey. The Turkish 
Government would allow access to such a mission — they were not allowing access to 
anybody else to the camps. 
The Secretary-General undertook to call President Assad and thanked the Foreign 
Minister for all his efforts. He turned the conversation to the flotilla. He reminded the 
Minister that the Panel on the 31 May 2010 incident would transmit its report to him on 22
