I then went to 107 Cypress Crescent and met with Kirstin 
Barkus and her parents. AS before, I asked her to tell me about 
the vents of the day before. She told me that she had cut school at 
around 0830 hours and she and her friend had gone to 
house. Kristin says that she arrived there at around 0900 hours she 
thins, she also states that the victim was already drunk when she got 
there. Kristin states that she thinks that she was with the other 
people for around 2 hours. During that time she did not see anyone 
do anything to the victim. She did say, as did Crystal, that the 
victim made passes at the other boys who were present but no one did 
anything with her. : asked her if she saw Crystal make any pass at 
the victim, or if she saw her kiss the victim. Kristin said no to 
this. Kristin also told me that the victim had propositioned the 
police officer who came to the scene. I also, asked her how well she 
knew the victim, she told me that this was the first time that she 
had ever met her. Kristin and nothing else to add at this time.
