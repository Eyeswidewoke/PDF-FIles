Credits: 4 
CRN 6713 Sec A 
Chemistry of the Atmosphere: Earth's atmosphere has undergone significant changes over its 
history, resulting in the loss of species as well as allowing new species to evolve. Since the age of 
humans, the atmosphere haS changed at a speed and in ways unprecedented in earth's history. By 
discussing the underlying chemistry of the atmosphere, this class will illuminate its role in 
supporting fife on earth and the human impact on the atmosphere through discussing the 
chemistry of stratospheric ozone depletion, air pollution, and climate change. The chemistry will 
help the cWss identify actions and polices that can address these environmental challenges. The 
course also includes student-led independent research on topics. This course satisfies the 
Intermediate level requirement for the Interdisciplinary Science major. Pre-requisites: One of the 
following (or an equivalent undergraduate chemistry course): Chemistry of Life. or Chemistry and

In this course. we will closely examine the ways in which sociologists and other scholars have 
conceptualized and studied sex. gender and sexuality in society, while we try to bring conceptual 
clarity to these terms and to understand the complex relationships among them. Through this 
broad survey of the field, our goal is to gain a critical perspective on the ways in which gender and 
sexuality affect many spheres of social life (at work. in the family. in politics, in the production of 
scientific knowledge, etc.). drawing real or perceived boundaries of difference that shape the 
opportunities available to. and the day-to-day experiences and interactions of social subjects. As 
we will see. we cannot study gender and sexuality without thinking about power.

youth mentoring programs in urban cities. Using sociological inquiry, students will analyze New 
York City's new Cornerstone Mentoring Program from the lens of race. class, gender. culture, and 
power relations. Through fieldwork. course readings, class discussions, and guest lectures, 
students come to understand what it means to be a youth In the margins of New York City. This 
civic engagement course requires students to participate weekly as a mentor in the Cornerstone 
Mentoring Program. Students will be expected to spend (2) hours per week at a NYCHA community 
center mentoring a group of 3-4 adolescents in grades 5-9. Due to the nature of mentoring this 
course is a year-long course which requires fall 2013 and spring 2014 registration. NOTE: This

primarily on how visibility and attention get organized. We will also be thinking critically about the

relationship between search engines and the digital archive. biometrics and dataveillance. self-
suiveillance and social media platforms. counterterrorism and domestic spying, as well as debates 
around the protection of intellectual property rights in the context of online file sharing. While

Credits: 4 
CRN 7156 Sec A 
The course will examine the separate and connected histones of dictatorship and revolution. Using 
sources of political and social theory we will examine the separate origins of the two concepts. 
Using texts of Marx and Tocqueville as well as some of their followers we will then explore the 
historical connection, and in particular the tendency of revolutions to produce dictatorships that 
are more than just transitional. Here we will pay particular attention to the French. Russian and 
Islamic (1979) Revolutions. Next. on the level of constitutional theory we will explore the links of 
dictatorship to the making of new constitutions. Here we will rely on the writings of Schmitt and 
Arendt. Finally, focusing on Central Europe in 1989. South Africa in the 1990s and the Arab 
revolutions we will consider whether revolutionary level change is possible without dictatorship.

CRN 6119 Sec A 
'This course will examine the ghetto as a social form and as a "concept" In the United States. We 
intend to explore the phenomenon as it moved from European cities to American Communities 
and became what might be described as a hyper.ghetto today. We will pay close attention to both 
the macro social forces that make a ghetto a place of contempt and the everyday aspects that 
makes it not only a livable space but one that thrives and survives in a multitude of micro social 
ways as well. We will explore how the social form came to exact such a distinct imprint on our 
collective Imaginations?
