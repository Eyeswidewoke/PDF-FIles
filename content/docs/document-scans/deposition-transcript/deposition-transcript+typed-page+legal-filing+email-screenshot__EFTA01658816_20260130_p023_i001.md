in Floyd County, Georgia, on Thursday "voted to terminate its executive director after an audit 
found ballots left uncounted prior to the county's initial certification." USA Today (11/19, 
Garrison, Rossman, 10.31M), the Wall Street Journal (11/19, McWhirter, Corse, Subscription 
Publication, 7.57M), and the Atlanta Journal-Constitution (11/19, 895K) are among the other 
outlets covering the Georgia results. 
Arizona Judge Dismisses GOP Attempt To Halt Certification Of Biden Win. 
Reuters (11/19, Wolfe) reports Arizona Judge John Hannah on Thursday "dismissed a 
Republican-backed lawsuit seeking to halt Arizona officials from certifying [Bider)] as the winner 
of the state." Hannah "said in a brief order he was denying a request by the Arizona Republican 
Party for an injunction blocking the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors from certifying the 
results in the county, where the majority of Arizonans live." The Arizona Republic (11/19, 869K) 
reports the state GOP "had filed its suit last week, alleging Maricopa County officials violated 
state law when they conducted a hand-count audit based on vote centers, open to any voter in 
the county, instead of assigned precincts." The Hill (11/19, Neidig, 2.98M) also reports. 
Recount In Two Wisconsin Counties Set To Get Underway. The AP (11/19, Bauer) 
reports that on Thursday, the Wisconsin Elections Commission "issued an order...to recount 
more than 800,000 ballots cast in two heavily liberal counties" at Trump's request. The order, 
"required by law after Trump paid $3 million for the recount, was agreed to after rancorous 
debate for more than five hours Wednesday night that foreshadows the partisan battle ahead." 
The recounts in Milwaukee and Dane counties, where Biden "outpolled Trump by a more than 2-
to-1 margin, will begin Friday and must be completed by Dec. 1." The Milwaukee Journal 
Sentinel (11/19, 632K) reports Milwaukee County Clerk George Christenson "said Thursday that 
the county is taking every precaution possible, including distancing tables from each other and 
requiring that everyone who enters wear a mask." 
Media Analyses: Giuliani News Conference Included "Outright Fabrications," 
Lacked "Hard Evidence." The New York Times (11/19, Feuer, Qiu, 18.61M) reports, "At a 
rambling news conference" on Thursday, Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani "mixed misleading 
statements, wild conspiracy theories and outright fabrications as he attempted to suggest that 
Mr. Trump still had a viable pathway to winning the election." The AP (11/19, Merchant) reports 
Giuliani and other Trump lawyers "berated reporters for questioning their claims and cited a 
Michigan affidavit already dismissed by a judge. They also argued a debunked conspiracy 
theory that Venezuela could have hacked election results through machines used by local 
authorities." Bloomberg (11/19, Wingrove, 4.73M) reports, "Their allegations ranged from 
complaints that Republican observers weren't allowed to observe vote-counting in Philadelphia 
and Detroit to a claim by Trump lawyer Sidney Powell that U.S. voting machines made by 
Dominion Voting Systems Inc. used software made in Venezuela at the direction of Hugo 
Chavez," who "died in 2013." 
The Washington Post (11/19, Zak, Dawsey, 14.2M) says that "for 90 minutes, an 
unmasked Rudy and four maskless colleagues - `an elite strike force team,' according to senior 
legal adviser Jenna Ellis - spun a confusing web of conspiracies that indicate Trump won the 
election that he lost." The New York Daily News (11/19, Sommerfeldt, 2.52M) says the event 
"was called to amplify Trump's completely unfounded claim that Democratic officials used mail-
in ballots to rig" the election. 
Townhall (11/19, Pavlich, 177K) reports Giuliani "presented evidence he says suggests a 
pattern of planned voter fraud that was perpetrated in multiple states." But the Daily Caller 
(11/19, 716K) reports Fox News White House correspondent Kristin Fisher said after the event, 
"Well, that was certainly a colorful news conference from Rudy Giuliani but it was light on facts. 
So much of what he said was simply not true or has already been thrown out in court. ... He 
called it a nationwide conspiracy. And yet he failed to provide any hard evidence to back up that 
one specific claim especially when you're dealing with a claim that really cuts to the core of our 
democratic process."
