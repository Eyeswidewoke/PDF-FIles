FBI Daily News Briefing 
NBC News (06/02, Gamboa) reported that the Trump administration has been turning to DNA technology to help 
find and arrest immigrants, including children, but immigration advocates say it has been slow to spell out how it's 
using and overseeing the genetic information. According to the article, three groups sued the Department of 
Homeland Security on Monday after trying to get records about the data collection program since last summer, 
during the Biden administration. The plaintiffs are the Georgetown Law Center on Privacy & Technology, part of the 
Georgetown University Law School that focuses on privacy and surveillance law and policy; the Amica Center for 
Immigrant Rights and Americans for Immigrant Justice, both immigrant rights groups. The groups describe in their 
lawsuit their back-and-forth with DHS, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection 
since they originally requested information about their DNA collection from noncitizens on Aug. 1, 2024. The article 
noted that since 2020, DHS has expanded its DNA collection program and increased DNA contributions to the FBI's 
database, CODIS, by 5,000%, becoming the largest contributor, according to the Georgetown center. The DNA 
database of the FBI can be accessed by police across the country for criminal investigations, the plaintiff groups 
said in a statement. Newsweek (06/02, Mordowanec) also reported on the story. 
Lil Durk's Team Accuses Key FBI Informant of Being a Former Gang Member With a Criminal History in Bid 
to Get Out of Jail 
Sportskeeda (06/02, Bal) and Complex (06/02, Mahadevan) reported that Lil Durk and his legal team have alleged 
that the prosecution in his murder-for-hire case is relying on an untrustworthy FBI informant. Durk believed he 
should be released from jail before the trial, claiming that the informant had been providing false information to 
the prosecution. "The government repeatedly cites allegations from a federal case out of Illinois where Mr. Banks 
has never been charged and never will be charged, despite the passage of over three years since the underlying 
incident," Durkio's attorney, Drew Findling, said in a statement. "The government's own exhibit reveals that the 
allegations pertaining to Mr. Banks are based primarily on information from a cooperating human source, 'CHS 11 
described in the affidavit as a paid FBI informant and former gang member with a criminal history." 
Opinion: Victims' Lawsuits Show FBI and DOJ's Focus on Epstein Files Misses the Mark 
An opinion piece by MSNBC (06/02, Rubin) stated that on Thursday, a woman named Maria 
filed a lawsuit 
against the federal government that begins with a paragraph both familiar and chilling: "For nearly a quarter of a 
century," 
charges, Jeffrey Epstein got away with a "wide-ranging sex trafficking venture" in which she was 
one of hundreds of victims. And worse, 
alleges, the high-profile financier was able to do so because the FBI, 
Justice Department and United States Attorneys' offices "failed to listen to or protect his sex-trafficked, sexually 
abused, and sexually exploited victims." The author added that 
alleges that she first reported to the FBI 
that she was sexually assaulted by Epstein and his partner Ghislaine Maxwell in 1996, that she told the agent that 
Epstein had also committed "multiple serious sex crimes" against other girls and young women, including one of 
her minor sisters; that Epstein had stolen and transported across state lines nude and partially nude pictures of 
both of her minor sisters; and that, with others, Epstein was producing and distributing content that could 
constitute child pornography. The author mentioned that another similar suit now features 28 plaintiffs who accuse 
the FBI of "gross negligence and reckless indifference" to Epstein and his associates' sexual abuse and trafficking of 
them and others for two decades. These lawsuits also seem unlikely to succeed for several reasons, including but 
not limited to the plaintiffs' sheer delay in bringing them. The author claimed that the existence of 
and 
others' suits, and the plaintiffs' collective demand that the FBI right its wrongs, demands our attention. That's 
especially true because what the victims seem to most want from the FBI — accountability for their ongoing 
trauma and internal reform to ensure something like the Epstein saga never recurs.
