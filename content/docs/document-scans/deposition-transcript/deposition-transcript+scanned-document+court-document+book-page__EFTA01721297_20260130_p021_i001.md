Part III: The Art of Giving Massage  
7. Reaching around behind your partner's knee with your fingertips, lift 
slightly while making circles over the sides of the knees with your 
thumbs, as shown in Figure 11-11g. Use moderate pressure inward 
against the knee while making this move, and monitor your partner's 
response closely; some people are ticklish in this area. 
8. Continuing up over the knees, use your palms to glide with firm pressure 
in an upward direction on the front of the thigh, also known as the 
quadriceps muscles. Slide back down the thigh with light pressure and 
repeat four to five times. 
9. Apply kneading to the front of the thighs. This is where you can use 
some really big movements, sliding your hands all the way from the 
inside of the thigh to the outside in a constant motion. Remember to use 
your whole body to create the kneading motion, not just your arms and 
hands. And don't be surprised if you work up a sweat during this move. 
10. Imagine a line running along the outside of your partner's thigh from 
knee to hip (right where the stripe is on many warm-up suits). Starting 
at the knee, apply pinpoint pressure with your thumbs to a series of 
points along this line, as shown in Figure 11-11h. Hold each point for 3-5 
seconds, then release and move up to the next point. When you reach 
the hip, slide back down and repeat one more time. 
This area is often very sensitive on many people, so you have to be care-
ful when pressing here. Start out softly and increase pressure gradually. 
You can tell if you push too hard by noticing that your partner tenses his 
leg. If this happens, lighten your pressure. 
11. This Is an advanced move that requires quite a bit of trust on your part-
ner's part. You are putting him in a vulnerable position, one leg bent at 
the knee, with the hip open to the side. By using your palms, press down 
firmly Just above the knee, then glide slowly up toward the hip, as 
shown in Figurell-12a. For even more intensity, use your knuckles 
instead of your palms. Glide your hands back down to the knee with 
light pressure then repeat twice more. 
Lighten your pressure as you approach the upper thigh, which contains 
many delicate nerves and vessels. 
12. Lay your partner's leg flat again, and then glide your hands upwards 
over the thigh. When you reach the hip, swivel your outside hand 
around and slip your fingers toward your partner's lower back, as shown 
In Figure 11-12b. Glide up as far as you can alongside the spine, then 
press your fingers up into the muscles there as you slowly pull back 
down toward the hip again, letting some of your partner's weight do the 
work of pressing. When you reach your partner's leg again, continue 
gliding down by using both hands on the back of the leg, lifting slightly 
to get your hands underneath. Finish your glide down at the foot.
