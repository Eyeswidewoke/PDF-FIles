Title: Palm Beach 
So sorry I did not call. 
I got in about 5:30pm and ran out to a cocktail party at 6:30pm....and was in the middle of dealing with a lunch for 
Stephen Daldry on Wed., Jan. 4th. I left my make up case on the plane....that's the trials of going Jet Blue...and went out 
with one black eye. This did not bother me. but freaks people out. 
Annette Taper* and Joe Allen offered to drive me to this third rate cocktail party they told me about and it was a bit of a 
nightmare. 
Annette started bragging about a recent trip to LA where she had lunch with her new best friend Diane Keaton. She later 
let it slip out that she had not met before and that Wendy Stark had invited her. They then had dinner with Jane Fonda 
(because Joe Allen went to college with her very weird very boring boy friend music producer Richard Perry) and 
Annette's own daughter (which meant she paid for it) gave her a cocktail party. Wendy also gave her a dinner and a 
lunch. It was inane. Celebrations in her honor for flying to LA...for doing nothing. 
Annette came from nowhere. married an idiot years ago because she thought he had money, then broke up Katherine 
Rayner's marriage to the awful and poor journalist Jesse Kombluth and then landed Joe Allen, a retired rich cousin of Peter 
Brant who he sold his share of their paper business to. Joe collects art, plays golf and is also beyond boring. 
They drove me to a horrible party....and drove me back to Koch's by 13:00pm..1 could have/should have made dinner plans. 
They said they were tired from getting in late from LA the night before.. (Kochs arrive Thursday). I swear they went to 
another party...I don't know whether I was vomiting from the manufactured self glorification at bad social events (poor. fat. 
aging, drunk and totally fun Wendy Stark is hardly the arbiter of IA society anymore but she still thinks she is...and the 
most horrific aspect of the night....in the car, on the way home Joe started asking me about my brother. Then he asked me 
how much the Alpine house was on the market for....even though I liec.i) a million, I was humiliated I even answered
him. You could hear the silent laughter. Then they asked me about 
..I had dinner with her Tuesday night in 
Williamsburg...and she is terrific and we are planning her third job in the art department of a major film....and I told them 
Dr. Harold Klopowitz told me if we can get thru 24 and happy and healthy...she has a good chance of not having another 
"episode"....why was I spilling my guts to these obnoxious nosy people who don't give a shit about me. 
I think I left Palm Beach at Christmas four years ago when you started sending 
and me around the world....which 
changed/enriched my life. 
I must have forgotten how insane and nasty Palm Beach is. I was so shaken by the meanness and petty competitiveness 
that I was almost shaking when I walked into Casa Koch. 
I will call you tomorrow. 
The party I went to was given by an East Hampton real estate broker and his fashion designer wife in North Palm...they 
bought a wreck and fixed it up and have rented it next week for 3 months to Ala (sham's brother. They are Sunny von 
Bulow's grown kids. 
I think I will stay close to David's house till Jan. 2nd. I am on a 9:00am flight that Monday and will go directly to the 
Alpine house. 
I still don't think the lawyer is smart in not asking my brother for an accounting of my mother's estate sines her death in 
Feb....he thinks my brother is doing nothing wrong...because that would be illegal...and he will just get me the money from 
the house. Philip Michaels is underestimating my brother's stupidity and desperate need to live above his means. I also do 
not know what the lawyer expects in payment for this. I gave him a small retainer. He has all my mothers papers. Should 
I get them back? I am sure he has not looked at any of them. The entire case is in those papers. 
He can't keep, them can 
he? 
What am I doing in Palm Beacb?....My eyes, etc. look better everyday.
