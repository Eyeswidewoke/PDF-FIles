I'm sure you might think that photography is not a rea= job but it can turn into 
one if I do it well. At the beginning I will ear= no money with it since I have to learn and I will probably need to work i= a 
shop or something to earn some money. My question is how do I learn by =ssisting a photographer if I work in a shop all 
day ?? How can I earn mone= to pay my rent and living and in the same time learn a new skill in order=to grow in that 
specific field ? I'm not sure how I should manage this=..
