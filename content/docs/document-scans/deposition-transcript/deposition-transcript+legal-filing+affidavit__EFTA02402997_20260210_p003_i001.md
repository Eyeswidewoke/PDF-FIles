Ps: I am meeting wi=h Jean Baptiste Huynh the photographer on Friday ( we 
went at his studio t=gether once ). I think he is the perfect base to start with if I want to l=arn about photography 
specially for the use of light. He is excellent in t=is and I could learn a lot from him. I love his work

I am trying to do things differently in order to grow, b=ild my identity and stand 
up on my own two feet as I said... You are the o=e person that has always been there for me and the only one I could 
really=rely on. I just didn't expect you would let me go like this after ever=thing... I would like to do something for you to 
show you my gratitude. I =now I've lost a lot of time, patience of yours, credibility and made m=ny mistakes by repeating 
the same wrong path over and over- I apologize fo= this. I will never be thankful enough. Thanks to you I've learned so 
=any things that without your support I would have probably never known. Yo= taught me so much about life and myself 
that I can only be thankful with =ou. I want to make you happy and I'm sorry I've disappointed you. =t's by falling that 
one learns to walk and thanks to all of these mist=kes that I have done over and over I've finally cleared up my mind 
andrunderstood what are my real goals ( for real ) 
These are my goals: 
1. Photography: Learning photography because it's my real p=ssion ( after 
Jeffrey ) and I have an eye for it. Starting by becoming a p=otographer's assistant in order to master a camera, the light 
and lear= all the basics. 
2. Next: being represented by Next as an =nfluencer not just because of my 
name but as a professional photographer a=d promote my work or fashion brands. 
3. Acting classes ( i= possible) 
4. Train regularly and keep a healthy lifestyle=tdiv> 
I will work hard in order to ac=ieve these goals. 
I love you so much Jeffrey, I just want to make you happy and=if there is 
anything I can give you or do for you please let me know. I me=n it.
