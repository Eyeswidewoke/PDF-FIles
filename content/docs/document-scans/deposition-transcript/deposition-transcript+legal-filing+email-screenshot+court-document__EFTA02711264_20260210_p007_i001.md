The basis of living systems is self-organization. The brain organizes its activity in a continuous fashion, always in the present. 
It incarnates the operations it has performed as operant circuits. It exists and can be talked about only in operant terms on 
what it does. What it does depends on information it constantly receives informing it about changes in itself, environmental 
forces, the physiological functions of the body. It uses this information to adapt, to change, to maintain its stability and 
continuity. Information is not to be confused with the source of information. It is not power. It is an abstraction. It is not 
energy. It is an invention. 
A mathematical theorem holds that for any formal system capable of producing arithmetic there is a truism proving the system 
which cannot be proven within the system. For man there was consciousness, the system for which there was a truism proving 
the system which could not be shown to be true within the system?' All man was sure of was that he was conscious. End of 
discussion. He could never tell whether this consciousness was the result of a digital computer, religious incantation, etc. 
Information is a measure of effect. Start with effect and work backward. Information is a measure of the operant response the 
brain makes in terms of its nonlinear experience. Information relates to direct neural coding, to brain imprinting. 
Understanding the nature of nonlinear communication through the process of information closes the gap, gets rid of the 
interval. Every instant becomes the ordering of the brain in the simultaneous, continuous present. Even the notion of instants, 
of time, disappears. 
The evolutionary significance of all this is unbelievable, for man. It is the end of importance. It is the end of man. 
This exercise merely presents a system, a methodology. No truths are to be found here. The author doesnaTMt believe a word 
of what is set forth and is not interested in formulation of new dogma. It is the formulation of a system, an abstraction from 
reality not to be confused with reality. Reality as a whole is unmeasurable except through effect. The unity is in the 
methodology, in the writing, reading, in the navigation. This system cannot provide us with ultimate answers, nor does it 
present the ultimate questions. There are none. 
The static, fixed, linear system is now superseded by one that is operational and nonlinear. aeelt is important to observe that if 
the frequency of an oscillator can be changed by impulses of a different frequency, the mechanism must be nonlinear. A linear 
mechanism acting on an oscillation of a given frequency can produce only oscillation of the same frequency, generally with 
some change in phase and amplitude. This is not true for nonlinear mechanisms, which may produce oscillations of 
frequencies which are the sum and differences of different orders, of the frequency of the oscillator and the frequency of the 
imposed disturbance.fi” There is no information in a linear system. The only way to consider such a system is in terms of the 
nonexistent past. 
DonãTMt look for beginnings, for endings. Navigate through reality with no pretense of knowledge. The unity is 
methodological. The unity is in the activity and will not lead to any final answer. it is a path. ficeAll paths are the same: they 
lead nowhere.V6 Keep moving. 
Man was oblivious to the changes taking place as a result of man-made actions. Had that level been appreciated, television 
sets might have been viewed in a different light. Within the linear construct he could not see the information patterns. Deaths 
were caused by fits induced by the flicker of faulty television tubes.31 Scientific institutes warned that sitting within four feet 
of color television sets could cause cancer? Yet the same old questions were asked: keDid you like the progranfift All the 
while the information of the television experience was coding the operation of the brain.
