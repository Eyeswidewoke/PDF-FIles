New York Man Accused of Making Violent Threats Against President Trump and Elon Musk 
The Times Union (05/20, Mishanec) reported that the FBI is investigating an Ulster County man accused of making 
violent threats against President Donald Trump and Elon Musk in social media posts that included illustrations of 
Trump's head exploding. FBI agents sought permission to raid the man's High Point home in a legal filing earlier this 
month, after identifying him as the person posting from an X account that allegedly made "numerous references" 
to firing a rifle at Trump and Musk. The article added that investigators interviewed the man at his home last week, 
where he allegedly admitted to making the posts from an account under his son's name, the filing said. 
Investigators tracked him down using identifying information from the public account, which described the poster 
as a Hudson Valley resident who is the primary caretaker of children with special needs, according to the FBI. The 
Hudson Valley Post (05/20, Welber) also reported on the story. 
Head of Commercial Real Estate Investment Firm Sentenced to 87 Months for $62.8M Investment Fraud 
Scheme 
WAGA (Fox-5) (05/20, Staff Writer) reported that a New York man has been sentenced to more than seven years in 
federal prison for defrauding hundreds of investors out of nearly $63 million, including funds intended for a major 
commercial real estate project in Atlanta. According to the article, Elchonon "Elie" Schwartz, 46, was sentenced on 
May 19 by U.S. District Judge Steven D. Grimberg to 87 months in prison, followed by three years of supervised 
release. Schwartz was also ordered to pay over $45 million in restitution after pleading guilty to one count of wire 
fraud earlier this year. The article noted that prosecutors say Schwartz raised approximately $62.8 million from 
more than 800 investors through the crowdfunding platform CrowdStreet Marketplace. The bulk of those funds—
around $54 million—was earmarked for the Atlanta Financial Center, a planned large-scale commercial real estate 
complex. Another $9 million was raised for a mixed-use development in Miami Beach. A DOJ press release 
quoted Paul Brown, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Atlanta Field Office, who said, "This sentencing underscores 
that those who exploit the trust of investors for personal gain will be held accountable. Mr. Schwartz's actions 
caused significant financial harm to hundreds of individuals, and hopefully today's outcome delivers a measure of 
justice for the victims." Atlanta News First (05/20, Staff Writer) also reported on the story.
