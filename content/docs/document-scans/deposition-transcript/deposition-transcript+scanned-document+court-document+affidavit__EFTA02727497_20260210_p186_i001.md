Air Ghistaine Cell phone installations 
Mike, 
below is a draft email to Air Ghislaine to explain why we ca&t install a cell phone in the cockpit of their S-76 in the way 
we had discussed with them. Sorry this took so long....flve had a lot of discussion/negotiation/etc. with Keystone to make 
sure we have a solid solution. Please review, modify as appropriate and send to the customer so we can get their OK and 
have Keystone quote a new solution. 
Thanks 
Tom 
Below are the cell phone and iPod options currently contracted for the Air Ghislaine S-76Ot. configuration, including some 
comments and recommendations about these. We would appreciate your response to these so we can update the 
quotation and complete design work. Please provide your approval of the recommendations, or an alternate 
recommendation. 
32001 Cellular Phone Base and Charger 
Surface mount in cockpit or cabin area, a customer supplied cellular phone charging base. Installation includes: surface 
mounting of phone base to cockpit floor or bulkhead; 28 vdc to 14 vdc voltage converter, circuit breaker; mounting 
hardware; aircraft wiring; etc. Custom built-in mounting of charger base is available at an additional charge and must be 
quoted on an individual basis. Cellular phones are not permitted to be used while airborne. 
Comments: At the configuration meeting, we understood your desire to have the cockpit cell phone integrated into the 
cockpit audio control panels in order to enable direct use of the cell phone through the cockpit headsets. After further 
investigation of this type of installation, our completion center, Keystone Helicopter, provided the rationale below for 
avoiding this approach: 
Keystone Statement: 
Keystone Helicopter Corporation (KHC) no longer accepts work to modify existing aircraft or new aircraft with 
integrated cell phones into the cockpit. Historically mobile phones have been installed in the cockpit and integrated 
into the ICS system with the understanding that system can not be used inflight due to FCC and FM guidelines. 
Recent guidelines within the FM have forced a review of these installations as to the environmental qualifications of 
the equipment and a failure hazard assessment of the install. Typically, customers request their current phones which 
rarely meet any environmental qualification (i.e. DO-160, mil-std 810...) or have been evaluated for their MTBF in a 
helicopter environment. Failure of the system may directly effect other cockpit flight equipment and increase pilot 
workload. 
Recommendation: Keep the cell phone base and charger as currently In the contracted configuration (described above in 
32001). The ability to make cell phone calls through the headsets can be achieved by purchase of a commercially 
available headset-cell phone interface unit.
