We are adding a new section entitled Average Daily Balance Method for Calculation of Finance Charges to the Agreement, reading in its 
entirety as follows: 
.'Average Daily Balance Method for Calculation of Finance Charges 
We use the Average Daily Balance method to calculate Finance Charges on your Account. Under this method, we calculate the Finance 
Charges on your Account by applying the DPR to the Average Daily Balance (as described below) separately for each Feature subject to a 
different DPR (Including current transactions). Different DPRs may be applied to separate Feature balances. To get the Average Daily 
Balance for each Feature, we (I) take the beginning balance for each day (including unpad Finance Charges from previous biting periods), 
(2) add any new transactions, debits, or fees, (3) subtract any payments or credits credited as of that day, and (4) make any appropriate 
adjustments. For each day Menthe first day of the billing period, we also add an amount of interest equal to the previous day's daily balance 
multiplied by Me CPR for the Feature. This gives us the daily balance for the Feature for that day and the beginning balance for that Feature 
for the next day. If this balance is negative, It is considered to be zero. Then, we add up an the daily balances for the Feature for the billing 
period and divide the total by the number of days in the billing period. This gives us the Average Daily Balance for that Feature. 
For all Features, except for specific Charges or amounts added to a Feature during a billing period in response to a request, the Average 
Daily Balance for a billing period will be considered to be zero if you paid, by the Closing Date of the current biting period, the total Account 
balance, if any, shown on your previous billing statement. If you multiply the Average Daily Balance for each Feature by the number of days 
In the billing period and the DPR for that Feature, the result will be the Finance Charge assessed on that Feature, except for variations 
caused by rounding. The total Finance Charge for the billing period is calculated by adding the Finance Charges assessed on all Features of 
the Account. This method of calculating the Average Daily Balance and Finance Charge results in daffy compounding of Finance Charges. 
We may use mathematical formulas which produce equivalent results to calculate the Average Daily Balance, Finance Charge, and related 
amounts. For example, we may utilize computer programs or other computational methods that are designed to produce mathematically 
equivalent results while usirg fewer and/or simpler computational steps than are described in this Agreement. 
At ow discretion, we may exclude certain categories of debit transactions or fees from the calculation of the daily balances. Unless we elect 
to use a later date, we add a Charge to the daily balance as follows: For Charges (other than Finance Charges) that are added to a balance 
automatically, we add the Charge to the appropriate day balance for the Feature as of the date the Charge is posted to the Account. For 
Charges that are not added to a balance automatically (e.g., in response to a specific transfer request), we add the Charge to the appropriate 
daily balance for the Feature as of the date we process the request. 
Periodic Finance Charges are added to the outstanding balance at the end of the billing period for which Finance Charges are calculated. In 
our sole discretion, we also may round any calculations made in determining the Finance Charges on your Account in any way that is 
convenient to us. Any such rounding may apply to or cause variations In your DPRs.' 
We are replacing the entire Suspension/Cancellation section of the Agreement with the following new section entitled Suspension/Cancellation: 
"Suspension/Cancellation 
In addition to any other actions we may take under this Agreement, we may suspend or cancel your Account, any Feature, or any component 
of your Account; and/or we may suspend or cancel the authorization of any Additional Cardmember to make Charges to your Account, at our 
sole discretion at any time, with or without cause, whether or not your Account is in default, and without giving you notice, subject to 
applicable law. Any such action on our part will not cancel your obligation to pay all Charges due on your Account under the terms of this 
Agreement in effect at the time of such action or as subsequently amended, and you agree to pay us all such Charges despite any such 
action. We may advise third parties who accept the Card that the Card(s) issued to you and/or Additional Cardmembers have been canceled. 
If we cancel the Card or it expires, you may no longer use it and you must destroy it or return it to us or, if we request, to a third party.

If we agree to reinstate your Account after a cancellation, the new Agreement we send you (or, If we do not send you a new Agreement, this 
Agreement as it may be amended) will govern your reinstated Account. When vie reinstate your Account, we may reinstate any Additional 
Cards issued In connection with your Account, and bill you the applicable annual fee(s)? 
We are replacing the last paragraph of the Default section of your Agreement with the following: 
'In the event of your default, and subject to any limitations or requirements of applicable law, we may require payment of a portion of your 
outstanding balance greater than the total Minimum Amount Due, declare the entire amount of your obligations to us Immediately due and 
payable, and/or suspend or cancel your Account, any component of your Account, and/or any Feature that may be offered in connection well 
the Account. You agree to pay all reasonable costs, Including reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred by us (1) in connection with the collection 
of any amount due on your Account, whether or not any arbitration, litigation, or similar proceedings are initiated; and (2) in reasonably 
protecting ourselves from any loss, harm, or risk relating to any default on your Account:
