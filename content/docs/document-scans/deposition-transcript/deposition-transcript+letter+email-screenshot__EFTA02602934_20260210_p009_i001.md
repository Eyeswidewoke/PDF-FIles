Notwithstanding your stat=ment that "As for the claim about concern for my later years, that has been 
thoroughly r=futed" it has not been refuted in th= context of my trusteeship and it remains my duty to consider 
distribution= in light of the possibility that you will have a reasonable need for distributions from the trust for many 
more year=, and perhaps in increasing amounts, depending on your circumstances in th= future. 
I didn't respond be=ore but perhaps I should have. I will be 90 years old in a few month=. I'm not going to live 
forever. You know how much is in t=e Trust. You also know my spending habits. Harry would not have millions of 
dollars if I hadn't been working all my life and =aving money for him and his sisters. Despite the ugly implications a=out 
Valeria in Harry's letter, nothing material changed after our marr=age beyond what I described and can readily 
document, with one exception. In Lexington, I was living rent-free, =he mortgage having been paid years earlier. Valeria 
and I decided that tak=ng care of a big house with steps everywhere and everything else that owni=g a house in 
Lexington entails -- snow removal, etc., and a difficult drive to work through New England winter we=ther -- made no 
sense at my age, and that we should move to an apart=ent close to work with no steps or other problems. 
Not your business, but =ne thing that shocked me about Harry's letter was his complaint that I=moved from a 
house to a "new home" -- insinuation obvious -- in =act an apartment with no winter driving to my office and convenient 
for someone my age. 
5. 
As for the specifics of disclosure, what = need to consider is (a) what your income was in 2017, since that 
was the =asis for the tax payments you seek to have reimbursed, (b) what your income is likely to be this year and going 
forward, (c) what=your expenses were in 2017 and are likely to be in 2018, and (d) whether a=y of your income (or other 
resources) are being used for purposes that the=trust cannot support (such as gifts to third parties). So far, Rich has 
provided me with some rough=information about your 2017 expenses. There are some gaps in that in=ormation, but 
nothing that can't be cleared up pretty easily (I th=nk). Rich has also assured me that you have not made any gifts that 
have diminished your resources and I assume you would confi=m that to me. What I don't have at this point is enough 
information about your in=ome, so that I can consider what the gap is between your expenses and your=income, which 
is the gap the trusts might help to close up. With res=ect to your income in 2017, all I can see is that your income tax 
obligations seem to be much higher than they were pre=iously. I'm assuming that reflects a jump in income from (i)=the 
profit made on the sale of the condominium, and (ii) large withdrawals=from your IRA. If you want to provide me with 
more information (bearing in mind what I noted in item #3, above) then inf=rmation about your 2017 income and what 
your income is likely to be this y=ar is what I most need. 
There is a very simple reason for the income =ax obligations. The depletion of the IRA that I reviewed again 
above=imposed a huge tax burden, which we were still attempting to deal with in 2017. After Harry's refusal to release 
some fund= from the trust to pay the exorbitant taxes resulting from what was happen=ng, I of course had to withdraw 
funds from the IRA to pay taxes on the who=e estate, incurring a new exorbitant tax burden. Despite some small relief 
later from the trust after I had r=peatedly pointed this out, it carried over through the 2017 tax bill. =AO So for that 
reason, taxes were extremely high. That curious episo=e is at last finally over, leaving many questions unresolved about 
what was happening while I was paying little attention, r=lying on advisers to ensure that matters were proceeding 
appropriately 
I hope this is helpful an= will wait to hear more from you and/or Rich.
