of a 15 calendar day waiting period following the filing by Purchaser, of its Premerger Notification and Report 
Form concerning the Offer with the FTC and the Antitrust Division. unless the waiting period is earlier

withdraws its Premerger Notification and Report Form before the expiration of the initial 15 calendar day waiting

a request for additional information and documentary material (a "Second Request") prior to expiry of the initial 
waiting period. If within the initial waiting period. Purchaser withdraws and refiles its Premerger Notification 
and Report Form. the HSR Act waiting period will restart and will expire 15 calendar days following the re-filing

consent. In practice, complying with a Second Request can take a significant period of time. Although Mobileye 
is required to file certain information and documentary material with the FTC and the Antitrust Division in

proposed acquisition of Mobileye. At any time before or after Purchaser's acceptance for payment of Shares 
pursuant to the Offer, if the Antitrust Division or the FTC believes that the Offer would violate the U.S. federal
