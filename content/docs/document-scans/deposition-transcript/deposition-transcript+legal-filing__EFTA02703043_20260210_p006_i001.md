The finding that young black men are 21 tim=s as likely as their white peers to be killed by police is drawn from reports 
filed for th= years 2010 to 2012, the three most recent years for which FBI numbers are available. The black boys killed 
can be disturbingly young. There were 41 teens 14 years or younger reported killed by police from 1980 to 2012. 
4,=A027 of them were black iii; 8 were white; 4 were Hispanic and 1 was Asian. That's not to say officers weren't killing 
white people. Indeed, some 44 perce=t of all those killed by police across the 33 years were white. 
=p class="MsoNormal">Who is killing all those black men and boys?</=> 
Mostly white=officers. But in hundreds of instances, black officers, too. Black officers account for a little more than 10 
percent of =11 fatal police shootings. Of those they kill, though, 78 percent were black.=C2* White officers, given their 
great numbers in so many of the country's police departments, are well represented in al= categories of police killings. 
White officers killed 91 percent of the whites who died at the hands of police.=C24> And they were responsible for 68 
percent of the people of color killed. Those people of color represented 46 percent of=all those killed by white officers. 
=/p> 
What were the circumstances surrounding all these=fatal encounters? 
There were 151 instances in which police noted that teens the= had shot dead had been fleeing or resisting arrest at the 
time of the encounter. 67 percent of those killed in such circumstances were black. That disparity was even starker in 
the last couple of years: of the 15 teens sho= fleeing arrest from 2010 to 2012, 14 were black. The problem with the=e 
numbers is that police don't always list the circumstances of the killings because there w=re many deadly shooting 
where the circumstances were listed as "undetermine=." 77 percent of those killed in such instances were black. 
Certainly, there were instances where police truly feared for their lives. As the data shows that police reported that as 
the cause of their actions in far greater numbers a=ter the 1985 Supreme Court decision that said police could only 
justify using deadly force if the suspects posed a threat to the officer or others. =From 1980 to 1984, "officer under 
attack" was listed as t=e cause for 33 percent of the deadly shootings. Twenty years later, looking at data from 2005 to 
2009, "officer under atta=k" was cited in 62 percent of police killings. 
Another disturbing trend is that the data shows p=lice are increasingly using something other than a standard handgun 
with the Los Ang=les Police Department standing out in its use of shotguns. Most police ki=lings involve officers firing 
handguns. But from 1980 to 2012, 714 involved the use of a shotgun. The Los Angeles Police Department has a special 
claim=on that category. It accounted for 47 cases in which an officer used a shotgun= The next highest total came from 
the Dallas Police Department: 14. So if you want to know why the African American community is upset when young 
Black men are killed by Police 
 is because it happens far too ofte=....
