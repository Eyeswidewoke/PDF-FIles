no chance, 
the attitude that westerners know what is right for the people is at the heart of the 
problem. I am aware of the mayor issues, and you have it 90 percent wrong it is not an anti 
coloniast vision, you misunderstand, you have also told me there was a 173 million dollars in 
rev , from your waste project. I have yet to see anything that approaches even 5.. Please be 
careful.. you are taleneted and smart. -- bad numbers, unwanted ideas. arc not good combos.. I 
can talk whener you want.

Well I can certainly sympathisize with that sentiment and I hate the thought of any of our foundation work 
being anything but demand driven. 
So hopefully your friend(s) would be wiling to take the time to discuss their wants/concems etc with me so 
that we can put that whole thing to rest - I am happy to hear any and all ideas. Unfortunately, sometimes I 
can't find a fit for ideas since we do have strategic constraints laid out by Bill. I think Bill would be sad to hear 
that anyone thought he was a colonialist! 
There are some things that I am not sure you are aware of, and I only note them as a caution in interpreting 
statements by the son of the president. First. the son of the president hates the mayor of dakar and has tried 
multiple times to push him out or at least really shred his reputation. Your friend ran for mayorial office 
against him and lost in a landslide election. Big time. The current mayor is the only elected opposition leader 
in the whole country and there are serious rumblings from the streets that your friend and his father are the 
next African government to be toppled. Folks think it is the mayo r of Dakar that is fomenting this. So 
anything viewed as successful in Dakar is typically quashed or at least threatened. Finding a balance 
between doing what is right by the people and avoiding politics is challenging. 
I think your friend may also be speaking out of both sides of his mouth also since he has accepted and 
welcomed nearly $50 million in foundation dollars so far - one to deal with urban health and one upcoming to 
deal with sanitation/water. The foundation has rallied other donors around these two issues so you can 
imagine that the numbers skyrocket. 
It sounds like from our brief conversation last week, that he really wants an academic institution and I think 
that is legit and an interesting idea. To date he has a terrible track record there, (allegedly) "stealing" money 
from multilaterals and from the french that was intended to support higher education. So donors are nervous 
about that. 
All that aside and trying to think proactively and together about this, I am proposing something that would 
help generate revenue from the capital markets for his city (that they can control) rather than depending on 
his money or donors. It's kiknd of the "anti colonialist" vision - so hopefully we can discuss in more detail. 
What might be an interesting way forward is that we could think together about how to use a muni finance 
option that would support an academic institution of higher learning (if that is truly the right priority). If they 
are amenable I have also had some success elsewhere (Asian U for Women) in convincing the World Bank 
to reduce some of their TA requirements and reprogram some of that money to endow national academic 
instutuions of higher learning through the concessions within the loan packages. So if there are any ongoing 
loan negotiations we might be able to structure them together. I can see a West African College of 
Engineering or something like that potentially having broad appeal. So I can try, but I need your help. 
Sometimes with politics and the threat of regime change, people get nervous and discount good ideas. 
I would hope that an open minded and forward thinking government would want to listen. You know that I 
am only interested in getting this right for the people. I have no ulterior motives. 
Please ask your friend to give me a chance. Then he can say no or yes or find a way forward together. In 
the meantime let him know that he should also do homework because he's taking a lot of colonial money 
that he can't control and that will topple him. He needs to provide good things for his people in a way that 
works for them. I think I can help, maybe a little.
