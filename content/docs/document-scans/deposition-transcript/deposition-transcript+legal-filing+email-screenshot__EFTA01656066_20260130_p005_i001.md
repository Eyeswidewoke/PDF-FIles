shutdown. The Guardian (09/17, Tait) reported that the Secret Service did not search the perimeter of the golf 
course where a suspect lurked for nearly 12 hours in the apparent hope of killing Donald Trump, the agency has 
admitted. The article elaborated that the revelation has increased the pressure on an organization that was already 
under intense scrutiny over alleged security failures surrounding a similar attempt on the ex-president's life two 
months ago and has raised questions over whether it is adequately funded.

The FBI Is Investigating Suspicious Packages Sent to Election Officials in More Than 15 States 
The Associated Press (09/17, Ballentine, Leblanc) and the Washington Post (09/18, Vazquez, Gardner) reported that 
the FBI and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service are investigating the origin of suspicious packages sent to or received 
by elections officials in more than 15 states. The articles explained that there had been no immediate reports of 
injuries and that whether any packages contained hazardous material is unclear. According to articles, the recent 
packages were sent to Alaska, Colorado, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Missouri, New York, and Rhode 
Island election officials. Additionally, a package was delivered to Mississippi on Monday, and the Connecticut 
Secretary of State's office reported that the FBI had intercepted a package. According to agency spokesperson 
Kristen Setera in Boston, the FBI is collecting packages, some of which contain unknown substances. The story was 
also reported on by ABC News (09/17, Bruggeman), Axios (09/18, Falconer), BBC (09/17, Yousif), CBS News (09/17,

Fake Kamala Hit-And-Run Story is the Work of Russian Propaganda Group, Microsoft Says 
Reuters (09/17, Bing) reported that a recent investigation by Microsoft revealed that a false claim circulating on 
social media about Kamala Harris leaving a 13-year-old girl paralyzed after a hit-and-run in San Francisco in 2011 is 
linked to a Russian disinformation campaign, specifically from a Kremlin-aligned group known as Storm-1516. 
According to the article, this operation fabricated a video and created a fake news outlet, KBSF-TV, to spread the 
claim. Microsoft noted that "many entities within the pro-Russian ecosystem advanced the video and its claims," 
indicating a coordinated effort to amplify the false narrative. The article added that the report highlights Russia's 
increasing attempts to influence U.S. politics ahead of the November presidential election, aiming to deepen 
political divisions. The article noted that additionally, the DOJ recently filed money-laundering charges against 
employees of Russian state media for attempting to manipulate election-related content. 
Russian Disinformation Peddlers Are Targeting Harris-Walz Campaign With Fake Videos, Microsoft Says 
NBC News (09/17, Collier, Zadrozny) reported that on Tuesday, Microsoft said that Russian disinformation peddlers 
are producing videos targeting the Harris-Walz campaign with false and disparaging claims. The article detailed that 
Microsoft said that at least three Russian disinformation actors have been working to denigrate the Harris-Walz 
campaign. One is a "marketing" firm that the DOJ indicted this month, while Microsoft identified the other two 
only by pseudonyms. The article specified that Intelligence officials have consistently said that Russia prefers 
candidates who don't seek to undermine its invasion of Ukraine. Harris has said she would continue to support the 
Biden administration's arms support for Ukraine. The article continued that officials have said that Iran, in contrast 
to Russia, aims to hurt Trump and his chances in the election. The FBI and other agencies said in August that Iran 
was behind an operation that hacked Trump's campaign and tried to share stolen documents with some American 
journalists through an online persona, though so far, those documents have not been published. The article noted 
that the DOJ plans to file charges over that operation. Iranian authorities have denied interfering in the election. 
The article underscored that the U.S. intelligence community believes that China, another country often accused of 
influence operations, aims to destabilize U.S. belief in the democratic process and influence the outcome of smaller 
races but does not plan to support either Trump or Harris this year. 
The Microsoft report released by the Microsoft Threat Analysis Center (9/17, Watts) explained that the shift to 
focusing on the Harris-Walz campaign reflects a strategic move by Russian actors aimed at exploiting any perceived 
vulnerabilities in the new candidates. The report emphasized that as we inch closer to the election, we should
