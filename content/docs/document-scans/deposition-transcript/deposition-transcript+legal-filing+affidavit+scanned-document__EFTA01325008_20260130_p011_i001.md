eventually some body of law would emerge it would not in all likelihood be a uniform 
body, because there are [thirteen] federal circuits and the Supreme Court could be 
expected to intervene only sporadically .... *9 ... [W]e do not have to balance competing 
federal and state interests in this case after all. The overriding federal interest here is 
in certainty of right and obligation flowing from conformity to known law; the state 
interest is in offering its landlords a like certainty. These interests converge in favor of 
adopting ... state law rather than federal common law. Powers, 671 F.2d at 1045-46. 
This reasoning is quite convincing, particularly in a case such as this, where the 
Government and Epstein, in all likelihood, "entered [a] legal relationship with the 
expectation that their rights and obligations would be governed by state-law standards." 
Kamen, 500 U.S. at 98. 
Finally, Epstein's and Fisher's reliance on Neal & Co. v. United States, 36 Fed. 
CI. 600 (1996), an, 121 F.3d 683 (Fed.Cir.1997), is therefore misplaced. There, the 
United States Court of Federal Claims stated that "[e] very contract, including those in 
which the Government is a party, contains an implied covenant of good faith and fair 
dealing," id. at 631, and from this statement, Epstein and Fisher extrapolate that there 
exists an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in the lease agreement 
between Epstein and the Government at issue here. 
The facts of Neal & Co. are distinguishable, however. Neal & Co. involved a 
construction contract to build a housing project entered into between the Government 
and a contractor, not a lease for occupancy of real property. While a lease is a type of 
contract, the considerations surrounding a lease of real property are sufficiently 
different from those involved in a conventional contract as to militate against the 
extension of Neal & Co. and like cases to landlord-tenant disputes. A construction 
contract does not implicate the Govemment's rights, as a possessor of a valuable 
leasehold, to regulate the possession and use of real property under its control. 
Thus, as between general federal contract principles and specific state landlord-
tenant law, the latter should be applied. Land is unique. It is logical, therefore, that a 
landlord should have virtually complete say in who occupies its property. See Mann 
Theatres Corp. v. Mid-Island Shopping Plaza Co., 94 A.D.2d 466, 464 N.Y.S.2d 793, 
798 (2d Dep't 1983) (noting that landlords have a "substantial interest in controlling the 
assignability of leases"), aff'd, 62 N.Y.2d 930, 479 N.Y.S.2d 213, 468 N.E.2d 51 
(Ct.App.1984). It makes sense for the law to permit a landlord to unreasonably 
withhold consent to a proposed sublet unless the parties specifically bargain otherwise. 
See Alex M. Johnson, Jr., Correctly Interpreting Long-Term Leases Pursuant to 
Modem Contract Law: Toward a Theory of Relational Leases, 74 Va. L.Rev. 751, 758 
(1988) (discussing the majority view that absent contractual agreement to the contrary 
landlords are permitted to unreasonably withhold consent to a sublet or assignment, 
and noting that the rule stems from the "paramount importance of the lessors ability to 
control the selection of his tenants so as to protect the value of his reversionary 
interest" in the leasehold). 
*10 I therefore adopt the relevant rule of New York landlord-tenant law for 
purposes of deciding the remaining issue in this dispute, and hold that, consistent with 
New York law, OFM was entitled to arbitrarily withhold its consent to Epstein's request 
to sublet the Premises to Fisher. Even assuming OFM had a hidden agenda in 
refusing Epstein's request to sublet to Fisher, specifically, that it preferred to enter into
