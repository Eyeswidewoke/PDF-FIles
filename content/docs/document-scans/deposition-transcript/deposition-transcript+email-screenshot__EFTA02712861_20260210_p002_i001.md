less likely to enter sc=ool ready to learn and to graduate from high school. One study =ound children who were poor for 
half of their childhood were nearly 90 per=ent more likely to enter their 20s without completing high school than nev=r 
poor children.

Child poverty increases the risk of=unemployment and economic hardship in adulthood. Those who experienced pov=rty 
at any point during their childhood were more than three times as like=y to be poor at age 30 as those who were never 
poor as children. 40=A0The longer a child is poor, the greater the risk of poverty in adulthood=and experiencing poverty 
as a child also increases the likelihood of lifel=ng health problems and involvement in the criminal justice system. Child 
p=verty scars some children for life. 
Child poverty ha= huge economic costs for the nation. Year after year the lost productivity=and extra health and criminal 
justice costs associated with it add up to r=ughly half a trillion dollars, or 3.8 percent of our nation's gros= domestic 
product (GDP). What we can never measure though are the counties= innovations and discoveries and contributions 
that did not occur for our =ation because children's potentials were stunted by poverty. 
It does not have to be this way. Child poverty is not an a=t of God. It is the choices of men and women and we can 
change it. Child p=verty can be ended and prevented if we want to. 
Pove=ty rates change over time with the economy and with changes in government =olicies. The U.S. has made 
substantial progress in reducing pov=rty over the past 50 years despite worsening inequality and increased 
unem=loyment. Child poverty dropped 36 percent between 1967 and 2012=when income from tax credits and in-kind 
benefits like nutrition and housi=g assistance are counted. Ending child poverty would save lives and money =nd 
increase productivity. For example, eliminating child povert= between the prenatal years and age 5 would increase 
lifetime earnings bet=een $53,000 and $100,000 per child, for a total lifetime benefit of $20 to=$36 billion for children 
born in a given year. When are we goin= to gain enough moral, common and economic sense to treat our children 
jus=ly and give all of them a level playing field upon which to grow? Children=have only one childhood and it is today. 
Chilean Nobel laureate=Gabriela Mistral said, "We are guilty of many errors and m=ny faults, but our worst crime is 
abandoning the children, neglecting the =ountain of life. Many of the things we need can wait. The child cannot. Ri=ht 
now is the time his bones are being formed, his blood is being made, an= his senses are being developed. To him we 
cannot answer Tomorrow.' His name is today." Given that the =5. has been blessed with great wealth and high ideals 
which we need to li=e up to and given the high costs we incur from child poverty every year, h=w can our country not 
act to end child poverty now?
