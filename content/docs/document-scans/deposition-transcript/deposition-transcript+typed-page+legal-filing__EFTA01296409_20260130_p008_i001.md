CORRECTING and REPLACING Carnegie Technologies and Founder Paul Posner 
Nominate Five Highly Qualified Candidates for the Board of magicJack VocalTec Ltd • 
Current Board Has Been Unable to Unlock Value for All Shareholders; Seeks to Undertake 
a Comprehensive Strategic Alternatives Process; Carnegie Technologies Intends to 
Submit a Proposal to Purchase magicJack for $8.50 per share Business Wire January 5, 
2017 Thursday 3:22 PM GMT 
The current board is unable to M4r,

-nited States. The Company initially 
node comments that it intended to clak tha:enOldeLS te aFP:cVe such move at the annual shareholder 
meeting, back on May ID, 2016, only to defer such decision on the 2Q 2D16 Earnings Call on August 9, 
2016 and subsequently on the 1p 2016 Earnings Call on November 9, 2016. In the Company's preliminary 
proxy material, of December 3D, 2016 listing the agenda of item, to consider at the annual 
shareholder meeting, the proposal is not even mentioned. 
The current board continued a pattern of ineffective decision making and seemingly lacked the 
capacity to negotiate squarely with Konen, a significant shareholder of the Company, while also 
considering the strategic priorities of all shareholders. In the Company's preliminary proxy 
materials, the Company's board seemingly endorsed a $45 million share buyback (on October 5 and 
October 20), only to reverse direction completely on December 29. 
Based on the above, it is Carnegie., opinion that the current accommodation to the Xenon proposal is 
Insufficient, either in changing the dynamics at the board of directors (in replacing one director 
and adding another), and in rejecting the proposed 445 million share buyback. Carnegie therefore 
proposes replacing a majority of the board of directors and commencing the exploration of 
comprehensive strategic alternatives for the Company, including a sale of the Company in whole or In 
parts. The directors Carnegie has nominated have long histories in the communications and technology 
industries, have served on public company boards, and have created shareholder value through both 
organic and inorganic initiatives. The proposed board also has experience in CEO searches, • 
critical matter as the Company announced the retirement plans of the current CEO whom we wish to 
retain as a board member in order to ensure a smooth operational transition.Carnegle is optimistic 
about the Company's potential under its ownership and intends to put forth a proposal to the newly 
elected board to acquire all of the outstanding shares of the Company for $8.50 per share. The 
prospective offer, which is subject to confirmatory due diligence, reflects a premium to current and 
historic stock price levels of the Company since the current board of directors approved the 
acquisition of Broadsmart. Further, it provides all shareholders an opportunity to sell their 
positions in a highly illiquid stock. Carnegie has retained The Bank Street Group as its financial 
advisor, as well as Netter Liquornik Geva Leshem Tal as its Israeli counsel and Wiggle and Dana LLP 
as US securities law counsel in its pursuit of this matter. 
magicJack shareholders of record at the close of business on January 25, 2015 will be entitled to vote at the 2016 
Annual General Meeting scheduled for February 28, 2017, at 10:00 an Israel time. For additional details, please go
