The truth is that it is such a tradition that Obama did=not really have to threaten a veto, as the Democratic-controlled 
Senate made it clear =t would not accept separating food stamps from farm programs. That's =hy the House ultimately 
accepted and passed a combined bill earlier this year.Q=A0 Then look at the dictionary definition of hijacking: "to steal 
or rob...to subject to extortion or swindling." Is that what Obama did when he said that Congress should continue to do 
what it did=in the past? Or was breaking up the farm bill the more radical step? The=most problematic aspect of 
Cotton's ad is that he suggests that attaching food stamps to the farm bill was a new idea=— something that he was 
fighting against. But that's invented history. This "bad idea" has been in place since before Cotton, 37, was born. 
Some fact on the farm side: 21 million Americans produce, process and sell food and fiber. U.S. f=rms and ranches 
spent $329 billion to produce $388 billion in goods in 2012.America exported $136 billion in farm goods in 2011, with a 
$37 billion trade surplus. Americans spend 10% of the=r incomes on food — the lowest of any country. Spending on farm 
policy including crop insurance was down 20% over the past five years. The world population will grow from 7 billion to 
9 billion by 2050. Farmers will need to double food production by 2050 to keep pace. To do the job, there are only 
210,000 full-time U.S. farms, which produce 80% of =ur food and fiber.For every $1 spent on food, farmers receive less 
than 12 cen=s for the raw products. 
Cotton=E2.4$ ad highlights the fact that food stamp spending in the bill amounted to $740 billion over 10 years. But 
the final farm b=ll contained a relatively modest $8 billion cut (over 10 years) in food stamps — though that =as less than 
the $39 billion reduction contained in the first bill passed by the Ho=se. Moreover, it is worth noting that the increase in 
food stamp spending started in part because of changes in the f=od stamp program under President George W. Bush, 
when Congress overrode his ve=o of the 2008 farm bill. That law boosted the purchasing power of food stamps by 
indexing key elements to inflation.<=span> 
Currently there are more than=47 million Americans up from 33 million five years ago. This number is now more than 
20% of America's households. For fiscal year 2013, the SNAP program cost $79,641,880,000, which is a 164% increase 
over the past decade= When adjusted for inflation, the cost of the SNAP program was $30,153,090,0=0 in fiscal year 
2003. During the last five years, the SNAP program grew by 36.8%, from $58,223,790,000 in 2009 to $79,641,880,000 in 
2013. Most importantly it is estimated that 47% of all Food Stamp beneficiaries are children under the age of 18. 
The Washington Post P=nocchio Test 
Cotton would be on more solid groun= if he had looked into the camera and said that, despite a tradition of merging 
food stamps in the farm bill, he was tired of the politics as usual and took a firm stand agai=st the longstanding practice. 
Instead, he uses President Obama as a straw man, suggesting the president purposely pushed Congress in a different 
direction= By creating a fantasy version of history, Cotton certainly sounds like a career politician. Because of both
