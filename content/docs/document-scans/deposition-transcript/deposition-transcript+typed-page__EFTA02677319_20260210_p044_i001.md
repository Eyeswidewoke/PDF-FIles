Credits: 3 
CRN 7367 Sec A 
The Himalayan region, referred to as the 'Third Pole' or water Tower of Asia' in recent years. has 
become crucial in understanding complex debates surrounding sustainable living and sustainable 
futures. This course will explore the complex reasons for these claims by engaging with multiple 
imaginaries and meanings involving diverse ecologies and cultures in the Himalayas. The seminar 
also invites and challenges students to find 'Himalaya' in their everyday living and intellectual 
pursuits. What would it mean for a person living in Kolkata. India or the Pearl River Delta of China 
or oven New York City to identify as a part of the Himalaya? 'Global Himalaya' Is designed to spark 
these sorts of questions and inquiry surrounding dynamic flows of ideas, people, capital and 
technology. The course is taught as an Interdisciplinary exploration and rethinking of our 
understandings of 'ecologies' and 'cultures' in the context of the Himalaya.

'Over the last decades, the People's Republic of China has become the global investment 
powerhouse. What kind of political economy has actually emerged in China? How did it develop? In 
this course, by drawing on traditional China studies and Comparative as well as International 
Political Economy. an overview of China's political economy is offered. In particular. five 
dimensions will be discussed: a competition-driven form of multi-level-governance and dynamic 
state dirigjsrne: a special form of private-public business sector organization: a fragmented type of 
corporatism in labor relations: the regulation of financial and monetary relations: and China's 
integration into the world economy and Into East Asia. Unlike Western commentators who are In

CRN 7306 Sec A 
The latest Syrian crisis has reopened the debate on interventions for missing interventions) in 
internal conflicts with the declared goal to stop mass killing and genocide. Today, as at the end of 
the Cold War in the early 1990s, this type of intervention poses serious challenges to accepted 
notions of state sovereignty. national interest human rights and war. When and how is it just to 
intervene? Why do interventions happen in some cases and not in others that are equally grave? If 
intervention is not a right but a responsibility, what is the force of Responsibility to Protect (R2P) as 
an emerging norm? What are the outcomes of intervention or the lack of it? This class provides an 
analytical framework to address these questions by exploring the political, legal and ethical 
aspects of intervention in the context of the post-Cold War world. It takes a case-study approach. 
focusing on countries where the decision was made to use (or not to use) force to stop mass 
atrocities: Haiti. Somalia. Bosnia and Herzegovina. Kosovo. East Timor. Rwanda. Darfur. Libya and 
Syria. There will also be some discussion of the cases of Afghanistan and Iraq, where intervention 
to protect human rights became an additional ad bellum cause and later an integral part of state 
building. The overall focus of the class is on the complex relationship between humanitarianism 
and war.

3522 The Politics of Ald in Africa 
Faculty: Rahman. Rhea 
MW 01:50 PM - 03:30 PM 
Credits: 4 
CRN 7359 Sec A 
From so-called natural disasters such as drought and famine, to the perception of 'failed states' 
and corrupt dictators. Africa is consistently represented as a place in need of outside assistance. 
Yet many scholars have asked whether foreign aid practices have actually done more harm than 
good on the continent, The recent rise of non-Western reiief and funding agencies (particularly 
from the Gulf States, India and China) has made the field of foreign aid In Africa more diverse and 
therefore more contentious. While development and humanitarian aid organizations are often 
assessed in the language of political science and international relations, this course asks how 
anthropological examinations of aid in Africa can offer valuable insight into the politics of foreign 
Intervention in Africa. we will develop skills to critically acciwa the effects of international aid on 
the continent, asking what kinds of social realities are made possible, and which are possibly 
foreclosed, as a result of these aid practices.

3602 China Urbanized: The Condition of the Chinese Middle Class 
Faculty: Ping. Lel 
MW 01:50 PM - 03:30 PM 
Credits: 4 
CRN 7838 Sec A 
Radical urbanization has now become one of the most concerned cultural-political terms in 
contemporary post-socialist China. It is time to study the politics of the emergence of the Chinese 
middle class as well as the disappearance of once well preserved urban spaces by critically 
investigating the intertwined processes of privatization. urbanization and globalization. In this 
context this course will center on some of the crucial questions such as how to understand the 
violence of massive demolition of urban spaces in relation to the irony of the Chinese Property 
Rights Law, how to reflect on the plight of the Chinese middle class and their blind pursuit of 
homeownership dreams, and how to interpret the particular class condition and its political 
weakness. Therefore by introducing some of the seminal and primary texts on modern Chinese 
history, cinema and urban studies, this course will allow us to rethink the impact of Chinese hyper 
urbanism as well as the changing social, class and spatial distinctions in the era of global 
capitalism.

Faculty: Shomali, Mona

Credits: 4 
CRN 4778 Sec A 
In this class. we will examine a series of pivotal humanitarian conflicts that involve both human 
rights neglect and degradation and inequitable distribution of natural resources. The course 
material will draw upon certain case examples from human rights hotspots in the developing world 
and here in the U.S. In our class discussions, we will consider various multidisciplinary 
approaches and definitions of the 'problem' and the 'solution.' We will learn about the vantage 
point of different affected communities. as well as actors from the political, social, economic and 
environmental disciplines. Unlike the typical 'environmental' discourse, our focus will be 
environmental justice, which encompasses: social equity and low income marginalized 
populations that are often left out of the western agenda of environmentalism. Unfortunately, the 
affected communities that pay the heaviest price of environmental pollution and degradation have 
also reaped the least benefits and rewards of modernization and development. As reflected by 
the name of this course, we will be looking at the skills for making a certain type of affected 
change or improvement for the betterment of human populations in cases where communities, 
NGOs and state actors have built international alliances to affect change or an intervention. MI 
the cases we are examining in class can be characterized by ongoing violence or political/human 
rights conflicts. Cases to be studied include: (a) petroleum resource wars in Iran and Nigeria. (b) 
the right to water in South Africa and Bolivia. Ic) environmental justice and urban pollution in the 
United States, and (d) food policy and farmworker safety In India and California. This collaborative 
research seminar is a requirement for Global Studies Majors, but is open to all Bachelor Level 
students after completing at least 30 credits.
