1.Regarding the questionnaire to be returned to VI Department of Lab=r with respect to Kyle 
Steward. I know you approved the form, but I =idn't like the large number of contractors stated on the document.=C24, 
Recall the document stated that there are 17 contractors and 21 empl=yees in the same "class" as Kyle. I questioned 
Daphn= further about it and learned that she included all workers paid as contra=tors and not just landscaper 
contractors. So, I revised it to change=the number of contractors in Kyle's class from 17 to 4 and the num=er of 
employees from 21 to 6, which relates to the class of landscape cont=actors and landscape employees rather than all 
contractors and employees. =C24> 
2. Also= Chris Kroblin and I didn't like the reference to non-payment=of taxes that Daphne and 
Jeanne originally provided in the questionnaire a= one of the reasons to treat Kyle as a contractor. We changed the 
ex=lanation as to why Kyle is a contractor to read as follows: 
"Mr. Steward was contracted to provide services as a tempo=ary landscaper for the Island after 
the Hurricanes. His role was to =erform needed landscape projects until the Island was restored back to nor=al. 
Accordingly he was not brought on as a permanent employee. =Rather he was contracted solely for the post-hurricane 
restoration project=" 
3. <=span>The questionnaire also includes the following instructions: 
"Attach copies of any written agreements, billing statements, applicatio=s, or contracts between 
the firm and the worker. If the agreement was oral= please reduce it=to writing and at=ach. If any State or Federal 
Agency has ruled on the same job class as this worker or another of the same job class, attach a copy of the ruling. 
(These documents will no= be returned.)" 
a Daphne pr=posed to include: all check stubs for checks issued to Kyle which generall= indicate 
number of days worked and the daily rate. Excluding the separate check s=ub relating to the Christmas Bonus (discussed 
in 3b below), there are 44 c=eck stubs relating to payments to Kyle Steward dating back to October 2017= I think=the 
check stubs would be requested anyway and would provide them. Ch=is Kroblin agrees and thinks we should provide 
the check stubs. 
b With regard to check stubs, there are=C24>two additional separate issues: There is a check 
stub whi=h is separate and states that it is a "Christmas Bonus4,=9D as per JE. I suppose that providing Kyle a Christmas 
Bonus could =ake it seem like Kyle is being treated as an employee. Not sure=if you want to include the stub or delete it. 
c. Second check stub issue. It is my unde=standing that Kyle's pay was $240 less than it normally 
is during =ne period. Apparently, Stephanie loaned him $240 to cover the shortf=ll out of petty cash. He had not paid 
the loan back, so, when he was=let go, there was a deduction from his pay in the amount of that loan (sil=y). The check 
stub makes a reference to the deduction for the I=an repayment. Does the loan of $240 make it seem more like he is 
bei=g treated as an employee? 
=. Daphne also included invoices =ssued with respect to each payment made to Kyle, but the 
invoices ref=ect billing at an hourly rate, rather than the daily rate reflected on the=check stubs, and the invoices were 
prepared by the office rather than Kyle= I think that the fact that we prepared the invoices would come out =uring the 
process (e.g., if asked about invoices, K=le would likely say he never prepared or gave us any invoices). Also,=that the 
invoices show payment at an hourly rate, which is different than =he daily rate on the check stubs, creates confusion 
and might cause additi=nal scrutiny. I think that our preparing the invoices would ref=ect negatively and would work 
against us, so I have excluded the invoices.=/font>
