totally appreciate that pulling together loose ends to rectify mixed processes accumulated over long years takes 
time. Yet, efforts are now underway to develop the healthcare sector and work is progressing in the right 
direction. Competition resulting from the growing presence of private healthcare organizations has reflected 
positively on the overall medical performance in the country. I believe all private=2 Oand public sector doctors 
will live up to international best practices very soon.

There has been increasing federalism in the handling of the financial needs of the Emirates, 
which has been hailed as a good step fonvard. How do you see this evolving in future? 
The UAE follows unified legislative, financial and fiscal systems. Federal authorities, led by the UAE Central 
Bank and the Ministry of Finance, assume full responsibility of developing and implementing these systems. 
Measures adopted by the UAE government in response to the global financial crisis only reflect conditions of the 
UAE market, which has been around for the last 35 years since the Fiscal Council was first established. The UAE 
government's swift action to address impacts of the global financial crisis has amazed many people. It is 
important to remember that the UAE's response to previous crises, such as the real-estate crisis of the early 
1980s, has always been carried out at the federal level. The increased federalism that you refer to in your 
question is yet another proof that the federation is getting stronger.

Many laws including the Federal Companies Law have been under scrutiny for a long time. 
Do you feel there is a need for faster amendments to federal laws to meet today's economic 
and social needs of the country?

Issuing the first amendment of a law usually takes some time. Rushing things may lead to undesired consequences 
while delay reflects unnecessary bureaucracy. The pace of passing new amendments to laws bound by 
international agreements and world systems — for example, the Companies Law — is determined by the progress 
of these agreements. Several important international agreements, including a significant number involving the 
World Trade Organization, are still not ripe. Yet, we are very keen on passing or amending any laws if necessary 
to strike a healthy balance between our local interests and our commitments to international trade and finance 
organizations.

Speculation about the dirham's peg to the United States dollar keep flowing back out. What 
value do you see in keeping the peg in the sh on term and the long term? Is there any move 
to change the structure or composition of the peg? 
Governed by strict banking principles and guidelines, the UAE Central Bank is taking care of the issue of 
dirham's peg to international currencies. The US dollar's devaluation against the Euro and the pound-sterling 
during the past few years has triggered several debates about economic threats posed by the dirham's peg to the 
dollar. Today, after the dollar's significant gains against other international currencies, we can barely hear these 
voices. 
There are no absolute wins or absolute201oses to pegging a local currency to a single foreign currency or a 
currency basket. Decisions are always determined in light of the size of benefits.
