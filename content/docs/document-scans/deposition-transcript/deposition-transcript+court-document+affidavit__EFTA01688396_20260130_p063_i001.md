Probable Cause Affidavit • 
Palm Beach Police Department 
Agency ORI# FLO 500600 
On January 4, 2006 I interviewed another former houseman, Mr Alfredo Rodriguez. During a 
sworn taped statement, Mr. Rodriguez stated he was employed by Jeffrey Epstein for approximately six 
months, from November 2004 through May of 2005. His responsibilities as house manager included 
being the butler, chauffeur, chef, houseman, run errands for Epstein and provide for Epstein's guests. I 
asked Rodriguez about masseuses coining to the house. Rodriguez stated Epstein would have two 
massages a day. Epstein would have one massage in the morning and one massage in the afternoon 
everyday he was in residence. Rodriguez stated he would be informed to expect someone and make them 
comfortable until either 
or Epstein would meet with them. Rodriguez stated once the 
masseuses would arrive, he would allow them entry into the kitchen area and offer them something to 
drink or eat. They would then be encountered by either 
or Epstein. They would be taken 
upstairs to provide the massage. I asked Rodriguez if any of the masseuses appeared young in age. 
Rodriguez stated the girls that would come appeared to be too young to be masseuses. He stated one time 
under Epstein's direction, he delivered a dozen roses to 
for one of the girls 
that came to provide a massage. He knew the girls were still in high school and were of high school age. 
I asked Rodriguez about the massages. He felt there was a lot more going on than just massages. He 
would often clean Mr. Epstein's bedroom after the alleged massages and would discover 
massagers/vibrators and sex toys scattered on the floor. He also said he would wipe down the vibrators 
and sex toys and put them away in an armoire. He described the armoire as a small wood armoire which 
was on the wall close to Epstein's bed. On one occasion Epstein ordered Rodriguez to go to the Dollar 
rent a car and rent a car for the same girl he brought the roses to, so that she could drive her self to 
Epstein's house without incident. Rodriguez said the girl always needed rides to and from the house. 
Rodriguez produced a green folder which contained documents, and a note with Mr. Epstein's stationary 
with direction to deliver a bucket of roses t

performance. Also in that same note was direction to rent a car for

contract.
