From James Malcolm : 
Minor tweaks or comments in recent BoJ reports suggest the central bank is becoming more nervous about missing its 
inflation target a little over two years after it was lifted and a radical new QE program to achieve it was 
implemented. They suggest that if the economy does not pick up substantial momentum over the next ten weeks 
additional easing may be warranted. The July 15 monetary policy meeting is key as it provides for an interim assessment 
of policy board member's price and growth forecasts, and comes just after the Bank's quarterly Tankan and public 
opinion survey. Beyond the hard data, these will show whether spending intentions and inflation expectations are lifting 
in response to higher profits and wages absent the consumption-tax drag. 
What has changed? This week's semiannual Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices report ('The Bank's View') replaced 
its assessment that "there are downside risks" for prices with the starker phrase that "risks are skewed to the 
downside." A research study on the impact of QE thus far, published today, concluded that "in order to achieve the price 
stability target of 2% in a stable manner, a further increase in inflation expectations is necessary." It also said that while 
the overall results have been broadly in line with expectations "... [the] demand component data for real GDP --
particularly private consumption -- point to considerably weaker improvements than predicted," even if, on the other 
hand, actual increases in corporate profits and employee income have noticably exceeded expectations. And an 
empirical regime-switching model that researchers at the Bank have have developed shows that the likelihood of a 
switch in inflation to a 2% trend remains very low. In fact, it has turned down from about 20% to 10% more recently, 
while the probability of the trend being at 1% has risen to about 55% from less than 20% pre-2013 (chart below). That is 
good in so far as the probability of the trend being at zero has dropped from stably more than 80% to less than 30% 
today, yet that is clearly not something which Mr Kuroda will settle for. 
For his part, the central bank chief is walking a tightrope. He has conceded his much vaunted original 2-year timeframe 
will be missed due to inflation, but clearly also feels like he cannot give the government any scope to relax on their 
medium-term fiscal consolidation plan, as this was an explicit precondition for the conduct and support of extraordinary 
monetary easing in the first place. It warrants some 3-month vol premium on yen assets and a particularly close 
following of domestic data and news in the interim. Both mark a sharp shift from what was always likely to be a very 
quiet 4 or 5 months following last December's election.
