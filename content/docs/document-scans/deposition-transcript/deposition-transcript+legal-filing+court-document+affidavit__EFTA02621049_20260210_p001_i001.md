RE: Conciliation Agreement<=span> 
I just received from the President a copy of the conciliation committee report along with his direction to direc=ly discuss 
with you whether there are terms that can be agreed to", by close of business tomorrow. =/span> 
I believe it is in the interests of =11 parties that we negotiate a reasonable settlement. I have been advise= that there is 
no egal justification for dismissal of a tenured faculty member on the basis of the claims that fraddressed in my appeal 
document. As you are aware, none=of my students, faculty colleagues, postdoctoral researchers at ASU, or a single 
participan= in my many Origins Projects events has launched a complaint against me.=C2 However I recognize that 
going through the appeals process and the legal process following it will drag on for some time, be costly for us both —
financially and otherwise, I am told but uncert=in that under ABOR 6-201, I will continue to be paid at least until the 
conclusion =f hearing procedures, up to and including an appeal to Superior Court if necessary. I also recognize that the 
University wo=ld prefer me to leave, and I now find little left to induce me to remain at ASU. =AO Thus I propose: 
1.=C2 
l=would appreciate being able to retire when I turn 65 at the end of May, 20=9. Of course I would retire 
effective Dec 31, 201= as you suggested assuming we can agree on the following points . =A0 all to be negotiated in 
good faith by us both, 
3.=C2 
T=ere is a consideration of emeritus status, 
4.=C2 
l=was planning not to retire until the age of 72 at least, as my divorce agreement indicates that I will pay my ex-
wife alimony equal to approximate=y half of my salary until that time. 
5.=C2 
l=raised over $2.5 million dollars to support my work with the Origins Project, and have brought in over $1.5 
Million dollars in external research funding. I would like the remaining ASU Foundation Funds that were raised to 
support the Origins project, and the R=D funds allocated to support my research arising from Federal grants to ASU 
during the period of my employment at ASU, to be transferred to another non-profit organization to be used to support 
my research and outreach activities. 
6.=C2 
A=University statement with the following content, the exact wording to be agreed, 
"The University recognizes and appreciates the significant contributions to teaching, resea=ch, and public outreach at 
ASU that Prof. Krauss has made over the past decade.=span> Following the termination of the Origins Project that 
Professor Krauss led at ASU for the past decade, Professor Kra=ss has chosen to retire from ASU effective xxx and will 
continue to carry out =is research, writing, and outreach activities elsewhere after that time.=C2 We thank him for his 
service. We not= that while allegations have been made in the press and to the University regarding Professor Krauss,
