Leon, Congragulations on biting the bullet. =AO at least 18 months late , but I m encouraged an= glad for you. When 
you interviewed Brad two years ago you as=ed that i not tell him what a disaster lay before him. what would y=u like 
me to tell Barry? 
There is a HUGE amount of work t= be done in the next 9 -12 months. mostly the exact same work =hat i outlined in 
my email of 2 years ago. now complicated by years =f mess on top. ( you can send it again if you like ) . =rad 
wechsler=was never up to the task . sorry, I realize I have been =aying the very same thing for a long time. he was a 
not a step up fr=m Eileen but a step sideways. in the beginning the=e was Eileen and Tom and Ralph Lerner. all your 
hand picks. =AO then brad. john, Joe. . joslin was chosen from = pool of 2 people. each that would be limited by a 
salary of 250k. (=yes i personally augmented his comp in order to get him ) I did say=hire both Lisa to do the 
bookkeeping and joslin tax, 
He compl=ined for over a year, re his direction by eileen and ada , and then brad. His 
breakdo=n was not a surprise after months and moths of warnings. Thoug= disabled, he ran your office this year. with 
john and <=pan id="m_-8623789478910689534m_-2434106449994715214:27s.7">joe. He ran amok, =nd as i told you 
he rarely failed to remind me in our conversa=ions that you told him that he works for you and not for me an= that 
brad needs to pays him . 
.=C2 Asking me who to hire , estate attny tax people etc. : 
I ha=e taken heat for years over the fact that i gave you no more than =AO carlyns =ame, . no follow up questions no 
interactions , not even=one single question asked of me re her work. ( that was=Eileen _) but somehow carlyns fuck 
up was my doing. . =C2 when i told you that i thought Eileen wasn't up to t=e task, you bellowed that i was talking 
out of both sides of my mout=. . You told me this year, that by trying t= protect you from crazy joslin=/span>, I had in 
essence fired him and it was my=responsibility to do his work. it then turns out that he=didn'tJoshn castrucci, in your 
eyes , was also my doing, though email after email=said , I take no responsibility for him,and iYOU SHOULD N=T HIRE 
HIM .!1! „ your response was that was my opinion was =nly because i didn't trust him. then to add insult to injury =A0 
last jan you told me he was gone. however he too is still there= and a waste of money and space. 
=AO 
My time is complicated by Don=ld's potentially eviscerating any reason for anyone to use =the foreign funds 
repatriation plan that i had put together. ..C2 however as you are aware I have some decisions to make re my t=me 
allocation in the next year or two. so at least for a few w=eks I am unable to commit much time and make any future 
plans to =AO guide you in the redoing of your procrastination produced m=ss. 
That being said , =C2 the tasks at hand are the following. 
EFTA_R1_01898782
