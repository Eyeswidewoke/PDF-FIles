not to be excluded from any such public court proceeding . . ." 18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(2) & (3). 
Section 3771 also commands that "employees of the Department of Justice . . . engaged in the 
detection, investigation, or prosecution of crime shall make their best efforts to see that crime victims 
are notified of, and accorded, the rights described in subSection (a)." 18 U.S.C. § 3771(c)(1). 
Additionally, pursuant to the Victims' Rights and Restitution Act of 1990, our Office is 
obligated to "inform a victim of any restitution or other relief to which the victim may be entitled 
under this or any other law and [the] manner in which such relief may be obtained." 42 U.S.C. § 
10607(c)(1)(B). With respect to notification of the other information that we propose to disclose, 
the statute requires that we provide a victim with the earliest possible notice of: the status of the 
investigation; the filing of charges against a suspected offender; and the acceptance of a plea. 42 
U.S.C. § 10607(c)(3). Just as in 18 U.S.C. § 3771, these sections are not limited to proceedings in 
a federal district court. Our Non-Prosecution Agreement resolves the federal investigation by 
allowing Mr. Epstein to plead to a state offense. The victims identified through the federal 
investigation should be appropriately informed, and our Non-Prosecution Agreement does not 
require the U.S. Attorney's Office to forego its legal obligations. 
With respect to your assertion that we are seeking to "federalize" the state plea, our office 
is simply informing the victims of their rights. It does not command them to appear at the hearing 
or to file a victim impact statement. In fact, theletter recommends the sending of any statement to 
the State Attorney's Office so that 
can determine which, if any, statements are 
appropriate to file with the Court. 
Next, you assert that our letter mischaracterizes Mr. Epstein's obligation to pay damages to 
the victims. To avoid that suggestion, I have asked AUSA 
to simply quote the terms of 
the Agreement directly into the Notification Letter. We also have no objection to referring to Mr. 
Epstein as a "sexual offender" rather than a "predator." 
We have no objection to using the conjunction "and/or" in referring to the particular 
offense(s) of which the recipient was a victim. We will not include the language that we take no 
position as to the validity of any claims. While the Office has no intention to take any position in 
any civil litigation arising between Mr. Epstein and any individual victim, as stated above, the Office 
believes that it has proof beyond a reasonable doubt that each listed individual was a victim of Mr. 
Epstein's criminal conduct while the victim was a minor. The law requires us to treat all victims 
"with fairness and with respect for the victim's dignity and privacy." 18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(8). We 
will not include any language that demeans the harm they may have suffered. 
The letter's assertions regarding representation by the 
firm and Mr. 
are 
accurate. Judge Davis conferred with 
and 
to insure their willingness 
to undertake this assignment prior to finalizing his selection.
