:nn , . , ., 
The New York AttorseyGenerat'srOthce hasntenNetters to-the charitablefoundation of' 
financier Jeffrey Epstein seeking information on whether it is complying with slate 
registration requirements. 
Epstein, 62, has been a tabloid sensation since allegations arose in a court proceeding 
in December that he forced an underage girl to have sex with Britain's Prince Andrew, 
prominent U.S. lawyer Alan Dershowitz, and other high-profile men. Prince Andrew and 
Dershowitz have denied the allegations. A lawyer for Epstein has called them Ott and 
discredited. 
fr:ENDiiic: STORIES 
Epstein spent 13 months in a Florida jail after pleading guilty in 2008 to procuring an 
underage girl for prostitution. Since well before then he has cultivated a reputation as a 
philanthropist through websites and press releases about his donations, especially to 
1
Harvard University. 
In a letter dated Monday and reviewed by Reuters, New York Attorney General Eric 
Schneiderman's Charities Bureau asked Epstein's lawyer Darren Indyke to explain why 
Epstein's foundation, which is incorporated in the U.S. Virgin Islands. should be 
considered exempt from New York law. 
A charity based outside New York is required to register with the New York Charities 
Bureau if it does business in New York or holds property in the state. It must also file 
annual financial reports with the bureau. Other U.S. slates have similar requirements. 
If the Jeffrey Epstein VI Foundation has to register in New York, it could he lotted to 
disclose financial details that other U.S. foundations routinely make public, such as how 
much money it disburses each year. The foundation does not release those details now, 
so the extent of Epstein's philanthropy Is not known. 
In a Jan. 28 letter to the foundation, the New York Attorney General's Office said it had 
become aware that the foundation appeared to be conducting charitable activities in 
the state. The letter referred to the foundation's website, jeffreyepstein.org, wttich at 
the lime said it was based in both New York City and in the U.S. Virgin Islands. 
The office asked the foundation to register within 20 days. 
In a Feb.10 response, Indyke said the foundation does not engage in charitable activity 
in New York. He said a contractor who was not closely monitored had mistaken Indyke's 
Manhattan law office for a foundation office and put the information online. 
"I have addressed this with the contractor, who has removed any erroneous statements 
about the foundation being based in New York," Indyke wrote. The website now 
identifies one base in the U.S. Virgin Islands.

homes in Manhattan and elsewhere. 
Indyke did not respond to requests For comment on 
Thursday. Reuters obtained copies of the letters under 
New York's Freedom of Information Law. A 
spokeswoman for the Attorney General's Office 
declined to comment.
