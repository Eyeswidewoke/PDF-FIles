was the obvious one. I'm sorry=for the stress you had to endure, but your efforts were a waste of time fo= reasons I had 
already fully explained before you undertook them. As=l'm sure you recall, a few years ago, I requested tax payments 
from th= marital trust when my IRA was being rapidly depleted by my advisers who w=re distributing half to family and 
using the other half to pay management =ees and taxes for the entire estate, so that to pay Alex's medical exp=nses and 
the expenses for Wellfleet I had to withdraw excess funds with ex=rbitant taxes, all that before withdrawing even a cent 
to live on again wi=h exorbitant taxes. Your response was to refuse the request unless l=agreed to intrusive and 
insulting financial investigations -- of a kind I =ever considered when providing funds to you for something you 
needed.Q=A0 I made it clear and explicit at the time that I would not submit to thi= procedure. Since your efforts and 
proposals simply repeat the same =rocedure, they were a waste of time. 
There were some things=in your letter that were correct. You're right that 
despite what=has happened, I'm still a "wealthy man," with income well ab=ve the median, though lacking a pension 
and accumulated property, not at t=e level of my peers. Furthermore, I can supplement my income by teac=ing large 
undergraduate courses, something I'd never done and that is =ot that common for people approaching 90, but 
something that I enjoy.Q.A0 And you too are a wealthy man, for the same reasons: the reasons are th=t I've worked 
hard all my life, lived fairly simply (and live even mor= simply today), and was therefore able to put aside enough money 
to ensure=that my children and grandchildren are very well cared for, indefinitely.=C20 
But I again suggest that we put all of this asi=e, and deal quickly and simply with 
what appears to be the one outstanding=issue: dividing the Marital trust and then dissolving it, all very simple,=needing 
no lawyers, at least on my part.

This is an interesting=idea. We could consider it further, but I would need the 
advice of m= lawyer — and I assume you would want your own lawyer's advice=as well — to ensure that any agreement 
we reach is consistent with=Massachusetts law and satisfies the interests, needs, and obligations of e=erybody involved. 
Perhaps, as a next step, you could ask your lawyer=to contact mine and begin a discussion in which we all participate.

I'm also curious to hear your thoughts about the pro=osals I suggested in my 
message on March 29th.

As = wrote a little while ago, I did write a long response to your last -- dee=ly 
depressing -- letter, but decided not to send it. I may return to=that letter later but will keep to some factual matters 
that ought to be c=eared up. 
But now I'm writing just about one point,=which seems to be the core of the 
problem -- a problem, which, again, I do='t understand. But let's put that aside, though I hope we ca= clear it up soon. 
All of this is a painful cloud that I never=would have imagined would darken my late years.
