opera — a somewhat odd, but not unprecedented choice for a staged drama. Notwithstanding a few 
gorgeous moments for the vocal soloists and some truly stirring choral interjections, it was the way 
Schmidt utilized instrumental colors and textures to tell a story that was the most striking aspect of this 
excellent performance. 
The libretto was written by Schmidt himself in collaboration with Leopold Wilk, and fashioned after 
Victor Hugo's popular Notre Dame de Paris. While the famed 'Hunchback' makes an appearance or two, 
the gypsy Esmeralda provides the central pivot point for an odd succession of events that focuses — from 
the masculine perspective — on her victimization and eventual death. Set in two acts, the plot can be 
summarized as two distinct love-triangles — one per act. As the opera begins, Esmeralda is already 
married (unhappily) to the crotchety, much older Gringoire (tenor). A local officer named Phoebus 
(awkwardly, also a tenor) has been watching the beautiful Esmeralda from afar and fallen in love with 
her. Not surprisingly, Gringoire becomes suspicious, plots in vain to keep a hold on Esmeralda, and 
finally kills Phoebus before leaping to his own death. In the second act, the love triangle is rather more 
oblique, and involves the seemingly ever-present Archdeacon (baritone) who is tormented with the 
unique inner conflict that arises for clergymen when they fall in love with gypsies. His 'rival' is the 
softhearted Quasimodo (bass-baritone) who also loves Esmeralda, and tries to save her when the 
Archdeacon decides to have her sent to the gallows. Ultimately too late to save the gypsY. Quasimodo 
causes the Archdeacon to fall from a parapet, leaving all the main characters dead except for the 
hunchback. 
Dramaturgically, the scenic requirements alone would discourage frequent staging of Schmidt's 
sprawling spectacle. The plot requires frequent shifting between large public scenes and more intimate 
spaces and lots of spectacular effects (high parapets, gallows in the distance, raucous crowd scenes, a 
suicide jump into the river and many more). The orchestral requirements are also formidable, including 
approximately eighty musicians with a rich brass section, two harps and organ. But perhaps the single 
biggest hindrance to renewed popularity for Notre Dame is the music itself, which, though lush and 
harmonically complex, provides precious little that is memorable for the singers. The whole opera plays 
like an extended orchestral tone poem with occasional vocal interjections. While fascinating on many 
levels, it's hard to make a case for the effort involved in a full staging when the singing roles are devoid 
of opportunities for pure vocal display or even in-depth characterization. 
Luckily for the audience at Carnegie Hall, 
Leon Botstein conducted the score as if he had done 
so dozens of times; astonishingly assured, he led his musicians through Schmidt's clever harmonic 
undulations with confident ease and absolute belief in the composer's intentions. As the performance 
began, a beautifully atmospheric oboe solo provided the perfect introduction to the narrative role the 
orchestra would fulfill throughout the evening. In fact, Botstein's distillation of the myriad orchestral 
colors written into Schmidt's score was so vivid, the listener could easily have eschewed the supertitles 
without losing the essential plot details. One after another, scenic effects — Esmeralda's entrance, 
crowds gathering and dispersing, Gringoire's collapse, etc. — were executed with impressive precision. 
There were no weak links among the instrumentalists and the overall effect was thrilling. 
While Schmidt decisively shown a spotlight on the orchestra, he did not neglect the chorus, and the 
Collegiate Chorale (James Bagwell, Director) excelled at every turn. Making the chorus fully a 'character' 
in their own right, Schmidt relied heavily on the public scenes for both spectacle and as a vehicle for 
deluxe sonic effects. Never out of proportion, the Collegiate Chorale sang with impressive cohesiveness 
at all dynamic levels, and truly dominated in the many scenes where the crowds of Parisians threatened
