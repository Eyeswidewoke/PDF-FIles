understa=ding. In relation to the recent crisis that occurred in the Gulf, the posit=on of the United Nations is very 
simple; we are here to support the Kuwaiti=mediation and this was an occasion for me to express our deep appreciation 
t= say how much we want to strengthen the cooperation and the dialogue betwee= Kuwait and the U.N. as we believe 
Kuwait is an extremely reliable partner i= our common commitment to peace and security around the world.
