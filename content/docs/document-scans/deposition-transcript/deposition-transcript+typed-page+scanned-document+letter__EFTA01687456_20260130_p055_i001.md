endures and the difficulty in visiting him persist. 
Aida and I met with Nick yesterday, for only about 20-30 minutes. Although 
we arrived at the facility at 7:55 and although 
was kind enough to 
set up a room for us, Nick was not brought down until almost 9:30. We were 
allowed upstairs at about 8:15, just when the guard for the room had just 
arrived . This is a frequent problem. It seems that room is often not staffed 
on time. So, when lawyers arrive at 8:00 they get a room, but have to wait 
until that guard arrives. This is particularly troubling on the weekends when 
there is a 10:00 count and you have to either stay until 11:00 or get out by 
9:30. Yesterday the officer in the room told us it would "be a while" before 
inmates from SHU would be brought down. Indeed it was "a while" as we sat 
for over an hour. We left just before 10:00 and were both late for our next 
appointment, mine a hearing in state court. We were not able to cover the 
ground we needed to with Nick and now have to return in the next few days 
when I fear the process will repeat itself. 
This week several members of the defense team have waited hours to see 
Nick. On Monday our investigator waited 2 hours and on Tuesday one of our 
mitigations specialists also waited 2 hours. Aida and I were Lucky in that we 
only waited about 75 minutes. We simply cannot effectively represent our 
client with these kind of delays. 
I believe we delivered a hard drive to the USA's office over a week ago. Nick 
tells us that he has not yet received it. Further, when he was moved to cell 
without water on the floor, the little discovery he did have, was "lost." He 
has never been given the document I previously mentioned, work product 
created by our office on which he made notes. It was out on his bed when 
he the cell phone was seized. 
Nick still hasn't been given any of the books he had nor has he received the 
books recently mailed to him and received by the facility. He now has a cell 
mate, someone to talk to, which has improved his emotional state, but he 
should have reading material and access to his discovery and legal work. 
I understand that other than visits, Nick has been locked in his cell 24 hours a 
day without time for recreation or to go to the library. If this is part of his 
punishment, it seems harsh. 
Again, I know that Nick is in SHU because of the cell phone, but he is still 
entitled to humane conditions, reading material and reasonable access to his 
legal team.
