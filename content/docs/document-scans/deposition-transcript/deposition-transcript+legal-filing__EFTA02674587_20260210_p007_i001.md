THOMAS MANN: I just think the press is now overrun with President Obama's personal shortcomings. 
That he doesn't engage, that he doesn't put pressure on members, doesn't tell them what to do. He 
doesn't give them bourbon and branch water and he and he doesn't raise hell with them. And the reality is 
that presidential leadership is contextual. 
He's operating with a Republican Party that's part of this broad apparatus. What can he do to any one of 
those Republicans? He can't do anything. He's not in a position to do it. He tried negotiating early, that 
was his brand, right? The post-partisan President. He realized what he was up against, and then he said, 
you know, I've got to maneuver, position myself with the Democrats in a way that we can get some things 
done. 
NORMAN ORNSTEIN: You know, I would say on the gun issue too we're premature here. It's not only 
that you can't twist arms in the same way that it might have been available to you before. And the few 
arms that he could twist on the Democratic side were almost all, with one exception, people who were up 
for reelection in really tough places. You're always going to tread a little bit more carefully there. And on 
the Republican side, it's not clear what either schmoozing or arm twisting would do. 
But my guess is you're going to see this, the issue of a background check come back. You're also going 
to see some executive actions, we're already beginning to see them, to make sure that people who 
shouldn't have access to guns have to go through a process to make it happen. So it's not only that, this 
meme in the press: "Why can't he be like Lyndon Johnson or like Bill Clinton?" As if all the schmoozing 
that Bill Clinton did got him a single Republican vote for his economic plan. And it took seven months to 
get the Democrats helped his health care plan, or kept him from being impeached. 
BILL MOYERS: Yeah, I'm not impressed when people say, well, Barack Obama's not Lyndon Johnson. 
Lyndon Johnson is... 
NORMAN ORNSTEIN: Today he couldn't be Lyndon Johnson... 
BILL MOYERS: Couldn't be Lyndon Johnson. 
BILL MOYERS: This is not the 1960s when Congress had a huge bevy, a large bevy of moderate 
Republicans. 
BILL MOYERS: So who wins, and who loses, when we have this deadlock and dysfunction? 
THOMAS MANN: Well, first of all, the public and future generations really do lose. We have serious 
problems, short and long term, in the country. We're going to have to figure out how we can compete in a 
global economy where not just low value but high value jobs may end up elsewhere. We're going to have 
a radically different workforce as the population changes, not only in terms of having more African 
American, Asian American and Hispanic Americans making up a part of that workforce, but as the 
population gets older and lives longer. 
We've got challenges in terms of energy and the environment. how you compete in a globe where the 
threats are very different ones. If you have a government that can't function, or that gets caught up in a 
war of the roses where what's most important is doing short-term damage to the other side, shed a little 
blood so that you can take over and implement a revolution, we're all going to lose. 
But I think in political terms, I just don't see a Republican Party that continues down this path. And I'm not 
alone in that. The Jeb Bushes of the world, and the Haley Barbours of the world, and the Mitch Daniels of 
the world. and the Chris Christies of the world see it too. If you move off the mainstream and pursue a 
radical ideology, and if you say. "We're just not going to make any movement at all," in some of these 
issues, eventually voters are going to say. "Enough of this? 
THOMAS MANN: Bill, we've been living through now years of stagnant wages. of high unemployment, of 
growing economic inequality. So the work of our legislature, our governments makes a big difference.
