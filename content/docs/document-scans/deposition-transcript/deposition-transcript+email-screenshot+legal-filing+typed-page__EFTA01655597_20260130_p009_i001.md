Republicans Grill FBI Over Troubling Discrepancy About Jan. 6 Pipe-Bomb Suspect Still Roaming Free 
The New York Post (02/04, Christenson) reported that GOP lawmakers are demanding answers from the FBI after a 
former head of the Bureau's DC office claimed a person who laid pipe bombs before the Jan. 6 riots has not been 
ID'd in part because of "corrupted" cellular data — a fact disputed by major US carriers. Sen. Ron Johnson of 
Wisconsin, Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio and Rep. Barry Loudermilk of Georgia sent a letter Monday to the Bureau's 
acting director, Brian Driscoll, about the troubling discrepancy. The congressmen wrote that the cell carriers 
"indicated that they neither provided corrupted data to the FBI nor received any notification from the FBI of any 
issues accessing the data." The article mentioned that the pols' inquiry comes after FBI Washington Field Office 
Assistant Director in Charge Steven D'Antuono — who led the probe of pipe bombs placed outside Democratic 
National Committee and Republican National Committee headquarters before the riot four years ago — testified 
before Congress in June 2023 that "some data" had been "corrupted by one of the providers, not purposely. The 
discrepancy highlighted by the Republican lawmakers raises questions about whether the FBI abandoned its probe 
too early, thinking the wannabe bomber's identity was not as important as rounding up other Jan. 6 criminals and 
thus putting its resources elsewhere. Johnson, who chairs a permanent subcommittee on investigations in the 
Senate, Jordan, who chairs the House Judiciary Committee, and Loudermilk also sent letters Tuesday to AT&T, T-
Mobile and Verizon demanding records about the feds' request for cell data on the eve of the Capitol riot. They 
asked the FBI for "communications between or among employees of the FBI" and "between the FBI and any 
cellular carrier, third-party contractor, other law enforcement agency" about the incident — as well as copies of the 
data received by the Bureau and "all memoranda, reports, assessments, evaluations, or other records" on the 
analysis of it. There's still a $500,000 reward on the table from the Bureau for any information that leads to the 
arrest and conviction of the person responsible for planting the pipe bombs. 
Massachusetts Member of Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula Sentenced to 44 Years in Prison for 
Terrorism Offenses 
The New York Times (02/04, Shanahan) reported that a man who pleaded guilty to federal terrorism charges nine 
years ago after being accused of plotting a suicide bombing at Heathrow Airport in London in support of Al Qaeda's 
Yemeni affiliate was sentenced on Tuesday to 44 years in prison. According to the article, prosecutors said that the 
man, Minh Quang Pham, planned the bombing after having received military training in Yemen from Anwar al-
Awlaki, an American-born radical Muslim cleric and a leader of the Al Qaeda affiliate in Yemen. The United States 
later killed him in a drone strike. The sentencing of Pham, 41, in Federal District Court in Manhattan, appeared to 
conclude a winding case that began with his indictment in New York on several terrorism counts in 2012 and his 
extradition to the United States from Britain in 2015. Pham was born in Vietnam, moved to Britain as a child, 
worked as a web designer and converted to Islam. The events that led to his conviction and sentencing began in 
late 2010 when he traveled to Yemen, the base of operations for Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP, 
according to court documents. Pham planned to join the terrorist group, wage jihad on its behalf and martyr 
himself for its cause, prosecutors said. While in Yemen, he received training from Awlaki, who advised him to 
return to Britain and recruit others to the cause, according to court documents. A DOJ press release 
quoted Assistant Director David 1. Scott of the FBI's Counterterrorism Division, who said, "Pham coordinated with 
known terrorist Anwar al-Aulaqi on a plot to conduct a suicide bombing at Heathrow International Airport which 
could have killed or injured many people, but fortunately that plan was stopped. Pham also tried to recruit others 
to commit acts of terrorism. The FBI will work with our partners to hold accountable those who align themselves 
with terrorist organizations and attempt to carry out acts of violence." 
Neo-Nazi Leader Found Guilty in Plot to Attack Baltimore Power Grid 
Reuters (02/04, Jones) reported that a neo-Nazi leader accused of plotting to attack Baltimore's power grid has 
been found guilty of conspiring to damage an energy facility, the DO1 said on Tuesday. Brandon Russell, 29, of 
Orlando, Florida, and an associate were arrested in February 2023 after the FBI thwarted their plan with the help of 
a confidential informant. Evidence presented at trial showed that between November 2022 and that month, Russell 
conspired to attack transformers within electrical substations "in furtherance of his racially or ethnically motivated 
violent extremist beliefs," the DOJ said in a statement. The article mentioned that Russell posted links to open-
source infrastructure maps and described how a small number of attacks on substations could cause a "cascading 
failure," the department said. He recruited a Maryland-based woman, Sarah Beth Clendaniel, to carry out the 
attacks in order to interrupt and impair the power grid in Baltimore, Maryland's largest city. Clendaniel identified 
five substations to target and Russell attempted to secure a weapon for her. The planned attacks would have 
caused damage of more than $75 million. According to the article, Russell is a convicted felon and founder of a
