II. THE REAL ENSEMBLE FORMULATION OF QUANTUM MECHANICS 
A. Kinematics and dynamics of individual systems 
The hypotheses we enunciated above become a formulation and interpretation of quantum mechanics, when we give them a 
precise instantiation. 
• Kinematics: description of individual states The state of an individual microscopic system, Sr consists of the pair of 
beables. (abets) 
• The ensemble of similarly prepared states. This system is one of N similarly constituted systems in the universe, which 
have been prepared in the same state and are subject to the same external forces as they evolve. These are labeled by 
I. I, ..., N. The state of the ensemble is specified by the collection of pairs, Hal(t).e4 (0)}. 
• Ensemble state variables. The individual system evolves partly by a stochastic process. Because of this, an observer 
studying a particular member of the ensemble, cannot predict with certainty which beables she will measure if she makes 
a measurement at a later time. She can predict probabilities for different beables to be observed, which are derived from 
relative frequencies for the states in the ensemble. The relative frequencies n°(t) are defined to be the number of systems 
in the ensemble which have beable value a at time r. These are normalized to L A, = N. We will also write al for the 
state of the I'th system and n1= na, for the number of copies in the ensemble of the beables of system Sr . 
• Dynamics of individual systems There are two modes of evolution of the beables of a system. 
Stochastic evolution rule. There is a stochastic evolution by means of which the system 5/ can copy the beables of the 
system 51. 
The rate by which system / copies the beables of system J is assumed to be of the form 
P(/copy./) = F(abObni3Ohabaj)

When this happens the properties of the system Sr inherits the properties of system 51 so that

We note that the rate a system I copies the state of system J is determined entirely by the beables of the two systems 
N iCOPM1b=ba =a) = F (ea 
nap Sap 
= F (nap Oa nor  tai )ab 
(5) 
This defines the rates of copying F(nap+a,,naj otai )on as functions of the beables. We note that by definition the compo-
nents of Fab must be all positive. 
Continuous evolution rule. When this mixing up or copying of the individual states does not happen. the phase evolves 
continuously in a way that depends on the ensemble. This must have the general form 
= ;G(irb(libn.r.4ij,aba.r) 
(6) 
• Evolution of the occupation numbers na
We define the occupation numberssia, to be the number of members of the ensemble in state a. They evolve as follows

• Evolution of the probability densities 
From this we can write down a law for the evolution of the probability densities, defined by
