Payments: Your payment must be sent to the payment address shown on 
your statement and must be received by 5 p.m. local time at that address to 
be credited as of the day it is received. Payments we receive after 5 p.m. 
will not be credited to your Account until the next day. Payments must 
also: (1) include the remittance coupon from your statement; (2) be made 
with a single check drawn on a US bank and payable in US dollars, or with a 
negotiable instrument payable in US dollars and clearable through the US 
banking system; and (3) include your Account number. If your payment 
does not meet all of the above requirements, crediting may be delayed and 
you may incur late payment fees and additional Interest charges. Electronic 
payments must be made through an electronic payment method payable 
In US dollars and clearable through the US banking system. If we accept 
payment in a foreign currency. we will convert it into US dollars at a 
conversion rate that Is acceptable to us, unless a particular rate is required 
by law. Please do not send post-dated checks as they will be deposited 
upon receipt. My restrictive language on a payment we accept will have 
no effect on us without our express prior written approval. We will re-
present to your financial institution any payment that is returned unpaid. 
Permission for Electronic Withdrawal: Cl) When you send a check for 
payment, you give us permission to electronically withdraw your payment 
from your deposit or other asset account. We will process checks 
electronically by transmitting the amount of the check, routing number, 
account number and check serial number to your financial Institution, 
unless the check is not processable electronically or a less costly process is 
available. When we process your check electronically, your payment may 
be withdrawn from your deposit or other asset account as soon as the same 
day we receive your check, and you will not receive that cancelled check 
with your financial account statement. If we cannot collect the funds 
electronically we may issue a draft against your deposit or other asset 
account for the amount of the check (2) By using Pay By Computer, Pay By 
Phone or any other electronic payment service of ours, you give us 
permission to electronically withdraw funds from the deposit or other asset 
account you specify in the amount you request. Payments using such 
services of ours received after &O0 p.m. MST may not be credited until the 
next day. 
How We Calculate Your Balance: We use the Average Daily Balance (AOB) 
method (including new transactions) to cakulate the balance on which we 
charge interest for Pay Over Time and/or Cash Advance balances on your 
Account. Call the Customer Care number on page 3 for more information 
about this balance computation method and how resulting interest 
charges are determined. The method we use to figure the ADS and Interest 
results in daily compounding of interest. 
Paying Interest:If you have a Pay Over Time and/or Cash Advance balance. 
your due date is at least 25 days after the close of each billing period. We 
will begin charging Interest on transactions added to a Pay Over Time 
balance as of the date they are added. However, we will not charge interest 
on charges added to a Pay Over lime balance automatically (for example, 
Pay Over Time Trove! and Poy Over Time Direct) if you pay the Account Total 
New Balance by the due date each month. We will, however, charge you 
interest on cash advances beginning on the transaction date. 
Foreign Currency Charges: if you make a Charge in a foreign currency, we 
will convert it into US dollars on the date we or our agents process it. We 
will choose a conversion rate that is acceptable to us for that date, unless a 
particular rate is required by law. The conversion rate we use is no more 
than the highest official rate published by a government agency or the 
highest interbank rate we identify from customary banking sources on the 
conversion date or the prior business day. This rate may differ from rates in 
effect on the date of your charge. Charges converted by establishments will 
be billed at the rates such establishments use. 
Credit Balance: A credit balance (designated CR) shown on this statement 
represents money owed to you. If within the six-month period following 
the date of the first statement indicating the credit balance you do not 
request a refund or charge enough to use up the credit balance, we will 
send you a check for the credit balance within 30 days if the amount is 
51.00 or more. To request a refund, contact us at the address or phone 
number on page 3 for Customer Care& Billing Inquiries.
