For six months, armed Pinkerton agents and the police harassed and beat locked-out steelworkers as they 
picketed. Most of these workers belonged to the "anarchist-dominated" Metal Workers' Union. During a 
speech near the McCormick plant, some two hundred demonstrators joined the steelworkers on the picket 
line. Beatings with police clubs escalated into rock throwing by the strikers which the police responded to 
with gunfire. At least two strikers were killed and an unknown number were wounded. 
Full of rage, a public meeting was called by some of the anarchists for the following day in Haymarket 
Square to discuss the police brutality. Due to bad weather and short notice, only about 3000 of the tens of 
thousands of people showed up from the day before. This affair included families with children and the 
mayor of Chicago himself. Later, the mayor would testify that the crowd remained calm and orderly and 
that speaker August Spies made "no suggestion... for immediate use of force or violence toward any 
person..." 
As the speech wound down, two detectives rushed to the main body of police, reporting that a speaker 
was using inflammatory language, inciting the police to march on the speakers' wagon. As the police 
began to disperse the already thinning crowd, a bomb was thrown into the police ranks. No one knows 
who threw the bomb, but speculations varied from blaming any one of the anarchists, to an agent 
provocateur working for the police. 
Enraged, the police fired into the crowd. The exact number of civilians killed or wounded was never 
determined, but an estimated seven or eight civilians died, and up to forty were wounded. One officer 
died immediately and another seven died in the following weeks. Later evidence indicated that only one 
of the police deaths could be attributed to the bomb and that all the other police fatalities had or could 
have had been due to their own indiscriminate gun fire. Aside from the bomb thrower, who was never 
identified, it was the police, not the anarchists, who perpetrated the violence. 
Eight anarchists - Albert Parsons, August Spies, Samuel Fielden, Oscar Neebe, Michael Schwab, George 
Engel, Adolph Fischer and Louis Lingg - were arrested and convicted of murder, though only three were 
even present at Haymarket and those three were in full view of all when the bombing occurred. The jury 
in their trial was comprised of business leaders in a gross mockery of justice similar to the Sacco-Vanzetti 
case thirty years later, or the trials of AIM and Black Panther members in the seventies. The entire world 
watched as these eight organizers were convicted, not for their actions, of which all of were innocent, but 
for their political and social beliefs. On November 11, 1887, after many failed appeals, Parsons, Spies, 
Engel and Fisher were hung to death. Louis Lingg, in his final protest of the state's claim of authority and 
punishment, took his own life the night before with an explosive device in his mouth. 
The remaining organizers, Fielden, Neebe and Schwab, were pardoned six years later by Governor 
Altgeld, who publicly lambasted the judge on a travesty of justice. Immediately after the Haymarket 
Massacre, big business and government conducted what some say was the very first "Red Scare" in this 
country. Spun by mainstream media, anarchism became synonymous with bomb throwing and socialism 
became un-American. The common image of an anarchist became a bearded, eastern European immigrant 
with a bomb in one hand and a dagger in the other. 
Today we sec tens of thousands of activists embracing the ideals of the Haymarket Martyrs and those who 
established May Day as an International Workers' Day. Ironically, May Day is an official holiday in 66
