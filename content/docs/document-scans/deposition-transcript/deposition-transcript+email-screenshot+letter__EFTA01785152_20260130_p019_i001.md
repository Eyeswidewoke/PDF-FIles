Grayling: Your lectures at Harvard hav= famously become available to everyone in the world online. MOOCs 
[massive=open online courses] look as thought they're going to transform educatio= worldwide. 
But there has been a push back on two fronts. One is that if =hese massive courses have tens of thousands of students 
taking them, and t=ey do essays, there just aren't enough professors to go around to mark them, so they're graded by 
software. So =here's one question mark that pops up in people's minds: is being taug=t by a computer OK? 
Then the second thing is you've been challenged recently by=an entire philosophy department at San Jose State 
University, who said, =93you're just about to put us out of a job because if our college just has your lectures online, they 
won't need us=" 
Where is higher education going? 
Sandel: 
The effect was beyond anything we could have imagined. They t=ll us that tens of millions of people have been watching 
them. For me, the=most rewarding part of the experiment is simply providing free and global access to the Harvard 
classroom, or to=any classroom, so that anyone, anywhere, including someone in an Indian vi=lage or in a remote part 
of China or Africa who has access to the internet= can see it and can hear about Aristotle and John Stuart Mill, follow the 
lectures and engage in the onli=e discussion if they want to. For me it's a way of giving expression to =he idea that 
higher education should be seen and treated as a public resou=ce and not as a private privilege. 
But as far as the push back, I would emphasise that I don't=think an online course can replace the experience of 
students and teachers=gathered in person and deliberating together as part of an academic community. And I hope that 
even financially pressed=colleges and universities won't assume that it can.=/p> 
QUESTIONS FROM THE AUDIENCE 
Question: You're probably aware, Michael, that there's been much discussion i= political circles recently with respect to 
the morality of tax avoidance. What answer would you give to this issue?</=pan> 
Sandel= I'm against tax avoidance. I think that countries need to work together=to find ways to reduce tax havens that 
drain important resources from the public treasuries of societies that have demo=ratically enacted certain tax rates and 
tax laws. 
Secret banking arrangements in the Cayman Islands, Switzerlan= and elsewhere provide a way for people to evade 
taxes. Some of the =ax avoidance is done through loopholes that are in the tax codes itself. I think both forms are 
objectionable, not onl= because they exacerbate the budget crises, indeed the austerity and the p=in that governments 
struggle with when they lack the resources that they w=uld otherwise have under the law, but also because I think it's a 
kind of civic corruption.<=span> 
We should find a way collectively and globally of cracking do=n on that, and preventing that, because it's corrosive of a 
democratic c=vic life. It's not just a loss to the treasury. 
Question: What part of equality do you=espouse: equality of outcome or equality of opportunity? How does your vie= of 
equality relate to your notion of justice? 
Sandel: Equality of outcome and equa=ity of opportunity are often thought to be the two alternative ways of con=eiving 
equality, and I'm not sure they fully capture the range of possib=lities. I would be for a third kind of equality that might 
be described as equality of condition.
