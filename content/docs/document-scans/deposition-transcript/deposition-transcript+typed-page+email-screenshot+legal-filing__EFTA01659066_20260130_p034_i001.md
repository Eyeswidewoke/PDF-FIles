deter aggressions by demonstrated precision against surface targets." Bloomberg (10/21, 
Capaccio, 4.73M) provides similar coverage. 
Pompeo Unveils Further Steps To Isolate China And Prevent Spread Of 
Propaganda. Reuters (10/21, Pamuk, Brunnstrom) reports that on Wednesday, Secretary of 
State Pompeo announced that the State Department is "designating the U.S. operations of six 
more China-based media companies as foreign missions, a move he said was aimed at pushing 
back against communist propaganda." In addition, Pompeo "also told a State Department news 
conference the United States would launch a dialogue on China with the European Union on 
Friday and that on Sunday he would begin a trip to India, Sri Lanka, the Maldives and 
Indonesia." Pompeo "said he expected the meetings would include discussions about how 'free 
nations can work together to thwart threats posed by the Chinese Communist Party.'" 
State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus said on Fox Across America (10/21), 
"One of the ways in which...we've made some actions over the past year is, why do we have 
these Chinese propaganda organizations that are directed, employed by the Chinese 
Communist Party in the United States, masquerading as media outlets?" She said, "We're 
designating them the same as we would the Chinese Embassy, for example. We're saying 
you're a foreign mission, you're a part of the Chinese government," adding "It's vitally 
important, I think, that we reset the relationship with China." 
Navarro: CCP Must Be Held Accountable For "Death And Destruction" Imposed 
On American People. Asked on KTLK-AM Minneapolis (10/21, 7K) about second term 
strategies regarding China, Director of Trade and Manufacturing Policy Navarro said, "Clearly, 
what we need to do is address those seven deadly structural sins the way President Donald J. 
Trump has been doing, which is to stand up to China - he's the only President who's ever done 
that - using tools like tariffs and sanctions. ... We are at a situation now where the Chinese 
Communist Party has inflicted trillions of dollars of costs on our economy, sent tens of millions 
of Americans to the unemployment line, and killed, killed over 200,000 Americans. So in a 
second term, the second thing that has to be dealt with is holding this Chinese Communist 
Party accountable for the death and destruction and cost they've imposed on the American 
people." 
Grenell Engaged In Talks Aimed At Persuading Maduro To Step Down. 
The New York Times (10/21, Vogel, lakes, 18.61M) reports Richard Grenell "quietly embarked 
on a pre-election mission last month that was at least partly intended to persuade President 
Nicolas Maduro of Venezuela to give up power." Grenell, who is "a close Trump ally" and "a vocal 
and combative supporter of President Trump's re-election campaign, met near Mexico City on 
Sept. 17 with Jorge Rodriguez, a former Venezuelan vice president and close ally of Mr. Maduro, 
to facilitate a peaceful transition of power, a White House official said." The Times says Maduro's 
agreement to step down "could have been a major foreign policy victory for Mr. Trump in the 
weeks before the election," but "there is no evidence that Mr. Grenell's trip had any effect." The 
Times adds it was "not clear why Mr. Maduro, a socialist strongman who has maintained power 
despite international opposition, would suddenly consider stepping down." 
Armenian, Azerbaijani Leaders Suggest Fighting Is Likely To Persist. 
Reuters (10/21, Hovhannisyan, Bagirova) reports that on Wednesday, Armenian Prime Minister 
Nikol Pashinyan "said...he saw no possibility of a diplomatic solution at this stage in the conflict 
with Azerbaijan over the mountain enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh." Pashinyan's comments, 
"after Azerbaijan's president said he believed the conflict could be solved militarily, increased 
doubts over a diplomatic push by major powers to bring peace to the South Caucasus region." 
Also on Wednesday, Russian Foreign Minister Serge' Lavrov "said...he had held separate talks 
with the foreign ministers of Armenia and Azerbaijan, who are expected to meet" with 
Secretary of State Pompeo on Friday in Washington.
