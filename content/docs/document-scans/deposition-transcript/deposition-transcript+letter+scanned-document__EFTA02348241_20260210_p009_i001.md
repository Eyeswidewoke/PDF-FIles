China's leaders: Changing guard 
Nov 17th 2012 -- FOR the first time since the death of Mao Zedong in 1976, =hina's most important reins of power have 
been handed over at the same t=me to a single man: Xi linping (pictured, centre, above). The decision, re=ealed on 
November 15th, that Hu Jintao has stepped down not only as the Co=munist Party's general secretary, but also as head 
of China's army, wa= part of the biggest shake-up of the party's leadership in a decade. But= although Mr Xi now has the 
titles of power, his ability to use them will =e heavily constrained. 
That Mr Xi, who is 59, would succeed Mr Hu as party chief has been in littl= doubt since 2007. There was also little doubt 
that one day he would take =ver Mr Hu's other important position as chairman of the party's Centra= Military 
Commission, which controls the armed forces. But it was uncertai= until the announcement was made whether Mr Hu 
would relinquish both title= at the same time. 
Mr Hu is constitutionally obliged to step down from his other post, as Chin='s president, next March, but that is a far less 
substantial job. His pr=decessors, Jiang Zemin and the late Deng Xiaoping, both kept the military =ost for a couple of 
years after leaving the Politburo, ostensibly to ensur= a smooth transition. Not since Hua Guofeng took over on Mao's 
death hav= both jobs been transferred simultaneously. 
Hua turned out to be little more than a transitional figure. Few people exp=ct Mr Xi to be the same. But his new jobs by 
no means give him absolute parer. Crucially, his two predecessors, Mr Hu and Mr Jiang, are still alive. =oth will wield 
considerable influence: Mr Jiang, at the age of 86, probabl= even more than the 69-year-old Mr Hu. The membership of 
the Politburo Sta=ding Committee, the party's ruling body, bears Mr Jiang's imprint. Mr =i and the man expected to 
succeed Wen Jiabao as prime minister next March,=Li Keqiang, are the only two left from the outgoing committee, 
which has b=en reduced from nine members to seven. Of the five newcomers, all but one =re considered to be proteges 
of Mr Jiang. 
This is unlikely to displease Mr Xi, himself counted a Jiang-ist. Mr Li wil= be less enthused. Many observers believe that 
at one time Mr Hu was keen =r Li should succeed him, not Mr Xi. As prime minister, Mr Li's chief res=onsibility will be 
overseeing the economy. But he might find it difficult =o get his way given the presence of two others in the standing 
committee w=o are Jiang's men. One is Wang Qishan, who has played a central role in =conomic management for more 
than four years, and has now acquired a very p=werful role as the party's chief anti-corruption official. The other is 
=hang Gaoli, the party leader in the port city of Tianjin, who is expected =o take over Mr Wang's economic portfolio. 
The body's new membership does not suggest any clear policy shift. Reform=rs will be disappointed at the omission of 
two men once thought frontrunne=s for elevation: the party chief of Guangdong province, Wang Yang, and the=head of 
the party's Organisation Department, Li Yuanchao. Both are seen =s Mr Hu's men and are reputed to be relatively 
liberal. 
None of this necessarily means that Mr Xi will shy away from economic, or e=en political, reforms. Mr Hu has been 
widely criticised by liberals in Chi=a for letting reforms stagnate, especially in his second term. Some allow =hemselves a 
smidgen of hope that Mr Xi may prove bolder. As a "princelin=", the child of a senior leader, Mr Xi is assumed to be 
rather more self=confident than Mr Hu. His father was close <pR 11* SkAP?2Ercef&T©*."" *D %.;GFMdc LA;
