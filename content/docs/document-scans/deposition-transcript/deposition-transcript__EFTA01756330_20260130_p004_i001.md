Iran over the course of the past eight y=ars with former president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. There are many in Congress 
=ho believe that pressure has worked, and so it should be intensified in or=er to ensure that we get the very best deal 
possible. And while I understand the logic behind that sort of a= argument, I think it is a dangerous presumption to 
assume that simply bec=use pressure has worked that more is always better. In fact, it's qu=te likely that if we were to 
see the proposed sanctions bill—which has passed the House and intended to =o before the Senate over the course of 
the next few weeks—passed by over=helming veto-proof majorities of the U.S. Congress, it would likely create real 
difficulties for the prospect of mai=taining the momentum and seeing some early fruit from these talks in the f=rm of an 
interim confidence-building measure, which I believe is the objec=ive of the U.S. negotiators. 
What about from =he Iran side? Are there still many political prisoners that the world woul= like to see released?<=p> 
We've seen a lot of=progress since the election of Hassan Rouhani in June 2013, but Iran is ce=tainly not a free and fair 
country. It is a country in which there are ong=ing human rights abuses, including the imprisonment of many for simply 
participating in the political process=or voicing their opinions through the media. It's also a country with one =f the 
highest levels of prisoner executions per capita in the world. All o= these issues are ongoing concerns for the United 
States. The most high-profile political prisoners in =ran today are the two candidates, Mir-Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi 
Karroubi, =nd their wives from the 2009 election in which Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's reele=tion victory was contested by 
millions throughout the country. The pair who had run against him and spearheaded t=e rejection of the official 
outcome has been under house arrest for two-an=-a-half years under incredibly draconian circumstances. They're in 
homes, =ot behind bars, but effectively their homes have become prisons. There are bars on the windows. They're 
li=ited in the contact they can have with the outside world. It is truly an a=ea that the international community ought to 
be focused on. There are smal= signs of progress even here within Iran. There has been official discussion of a review of 
their status, and = think that this is going to be a barometer for many Iranians, if not for =he world, of how far President 
Rouhani can and is prepared to go in terms =f changing the political climate in Iran. 
And, of course, =e's constrained by what Ayatollah Khamenei will allow, right? 
Rouhani is limited =y the hard-liners and in the sense that he is not a reformer by any stretc= of the imagination. He is 
very much a pragmatist who has come to this pos=tion, in a way, to lead a national unity government, to lead Iran out of 
the crisis that it has found itself =n with the international community, and to begin to rebuild the legitimacy=of the 
regime within Iran itself. And so he's got a very difficult balanci=g act and a lot of different constituencies to try to 
manage as he goes about this process of moderating both at home =nd internationally. 
What do you thin= will happen over the next six months? Any breakthroughs? 
Predictions with Ir=n are incredibly dangerous, as I think you know. But I'm very optimistic. ='m not irrationally 
exuberant. There has been just a little bit too much a=oration of the new tone that we've heard from Iran, and I think 
that it's important to remember that we're on=y beginning to see the first real tangible signs of change within the 
coun=ry. But it's quite clear that Rouhani was elected with a mission and=a mandate to find some way out of the 
nuclear mess and rehabilitate Iran's role in the world and fix its economy= The only way that he can do this is to come to 
an agreement with the inte=national community. The negotiators and the officials that we have seen in=New York and 
Geneva have made very clear that they are empowered, prepared, and willing. I think it's also cl=ar that the Mama) 
administration sees the opportunity before it and is a=tempting to seize that opportunity.
