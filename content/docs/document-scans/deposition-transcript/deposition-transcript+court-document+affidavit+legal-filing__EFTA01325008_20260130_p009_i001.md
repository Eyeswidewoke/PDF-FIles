512 U.S. 79, 87-88, 114 S.Ct. 2048, 129 L.Ed.2d 67 (1994) (noting that cases where 
the formulation of a "special federal rule" are "few and restricted"); Kamen v. Kemper 
Fin. Servs., Inc., 500 U.S. 90, 98, 111 S.Ct. 1711, 114 L.Ed.2d 152 (1991) (noting that 
a federal court "should endeavor to fill the interstices of federal remedial schemes with 
uniform federal rules only when the scheme in question evidences a distinct need for 
nationwide legal standards or when express provisions in analogous statutory schemes 
embody congressional policy choices readily applicable to the matter at hand") 
(citations omitted). While this recent Supreme Court authority leaves room for federal 
courts to create principles of federal common law in certain narrow circumstances, 
generally a "significant conflict between some federal policy or interest and the use of 
state law" is required before "judicial creation of a special federal rule [is] justified." 
O'Melveny, 512 U.S. at 87. While few courts have addressed the precise issue of 
whether leases to which the Government is a party are governed by general federal 
common law of contracts or state landlord-tenant law, there is some case law on point. 
The Second Circuit has not yet spoken definitively on this issue, [FN4] but recently 
noted the existence of a conflict between the Federal Circuit and the Seventh Circuit 
concerning "whether federal common law or state law applies to the interpretation of 
Postal Service Leases." Kerin v. United States Postal Serv., 116 F.3d 988, 990 (2d 
Cir.1997). On the one hand, the Federal Circuit has held that federal law applies to 
resolve disputes between the United States and its lessors or tenants. See, e.g., 
Forman v. United States, 767 F.2d 875, 879-80 (Fed.Cir.1985); [FN5] Kelley v. United 
States, 19 CI.Ct. 155, 162 (1989). On the other hand, the Seventh Circuit has held that 
state substantive law governs in landlord-tenant disputes involving the Government. 
See Powers v. United States Postal Serv., 671 F.2d 1041, 1043-46 (7th Cir.1982). 
[FN6] 
FN4. In United States v. Bedford Associates, 657 F.2d 1300 (2d Cir.1981), cert. 
denied, 456 U.S. 914, 102 S.Ct. 1767, 72 L.Ed.2d 173 (1982), the Second Circuit 
upheld the district court's application of federal contract law to determine whether the 
United States and a potential lessor of a commercial building had in fact made a 
contract, stating that "[t]his court undoubtedly has power to apply federal law in 
disputes between the United States and its lessors." Id. at 1309 n. 7. The court in 
Kerin v. United States Postal Serv., 116 F.3d 988 (2d Cir.1997), acknowledged the 
Bedford Associates decision, but implied that Bedford Associates involved the issue of 
creation of a lease only, stating that there is "room for fair debate" as to whether federal 
or state law applies to the interpretation of a lease to which the Government is a party. 
Id. at 990-91. 
FNS. While the Forman court stated that federal law governs in landlord-tenant 
disputes involving the Government, it nevertheless relied on state law cases in 
interpreting the particular provision of the Postal Service lease at issue. See 767 F.2d 
at 880-81. 
FN6. Other courts, too, have applied state substantive law as the rule of 
decision in landlord-tenant disputes involving the Government. See, e.g., Braxton v. 
United States, 858 F.2d 650, 655 (11th Cir.1988) (holding that Florida law applies to
