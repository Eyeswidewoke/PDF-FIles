1. Pre-money valuation was estimated at $3,338,710, and $1.5MM investment was intended to be 31% of 
Company on a fully diluted basis. Now $1.5MM buy= 25% on a fully diluted basis based on a $4.5 MM company 
valuation. However, to get EB up to 31% he is being offered up to 6% of ordinary =shares for serving as director. The 6 
percent vests in 8 equal quarterly installments over 2 years. However, by doing it this way, I =believe the warrant 
exercise prices which are based on a percentage of the original purchase price per share will start at a higher exercise 
price per share. 
2. Regarding warrant exercise prices, you may recall that in the last iteration of the term sheet, the investor was 
to be given two sets of warrants: one set of $1MM worth of warrants exercisable at any time over a 4 year period at 
150% of the purchase price per share of the preferred shares in this investment; and the second set of $2.5MM of 
warrants exercisable at any time over a 4 year period at 175% of the purchase price per share of the preferred shares in 
this investment. Now this has been =changed so that only for the 1st two years of the 4 year exercise period are the 
warrants exercisable at 150% and 175% of the purchase price per share, respectively. In the third year the exercise 
prices increase t= 195% and 225%, respectively, of the original purchase price per share, and in the fourth year, the 
exercise prices increase to 240% and 275%, respectively of the purchase price per share. If the original intent =was for 
the warrants to enable EB to acquire a majority interest of the Company, with the increase in the original purchase price 
per share, while the aggregate dollar amount that may be exercised remains the same, even with a full exercise of all 
$3.5 MM of warrants in the first two years (i.e., with an exercise price at 150% and 175% of the purchase price per 
share), it does not appear that EB will acquire a majority interest. He certainly won't when the exercise prices are 
incr=ased in years 3 and 4 of the warrant exercise period. 
3. There is a note that is deleted about there being a finders fee payable to Echar Erez under which he was 
supposed to receive cash in the amount of 2.5% of the investment amount, plus options for 2.5% of the investment 
shares. Although the note was deleted, I wonder whether that fee is =being paid somewhere. 
4. They put a time limit of 2 years on price anti-dilution. They also changed=20 the description of the price anti-
dilution from broad based weighted average to narrow based weighted average. 
5. Whereas previously any deemed liquidation event would require EB approval, now only liquidation events 
where EB would receive less than 400% of his investment require EB approval.
