Jeffrey, 
</=iv> 
The bots did the sweep. Here are the new results taken as of a min=te ago. You have only one negative article left on 
front page of google, w=ich is the Huffington Post article. The Huffington Post is extremely hard =o move, because it is 
so powerful, has millions of links to it, and upload= massive new and original content it on a daily basis with posting from 
ou= side readers. We managed to push it down the page, as it used to be at th= top. If we were able to post original 
content to both the science and the=org site (absolutely not a single word to this day by Jessica, just talk),=we would 
have been able to push it down even further, and off the page. WE=did manage to get rid of the daily beast article, 
which is now far removed, inspite of their own efforts to keep it prominent. 
Toxic suggested search engine terms that popped up automat=cally when you typed in your name are also now 
removed. 
Wikipedia was an important victory, as it will always be at the top =f the search engine results. ow the head lines do not 
mention convicted se= offender or pedophile. Instead, Philanthrophic work, Epstein Foundation, =romotion of Scientists. 
We have stopped the hacking on your wiki site, and=that was a major effor. Your wiki entry now is pretty tame, and bad 
stuff =as been muted, bowlerized, and pused to the bottom. Careful editing and wording has muted the effect 
immensely. We hacked the site to replace the mug=shot and caption, and now has an entirely different photo and 
caption. 41>=A0This was a big success. 
We pushe= the Edge all the way up to the front page, where it was previously buried on page S of google search. 
We have promoted the =ther jeffrey epsteins, and other pages are also filled with your material.=/div> 
And, while the sites are up, and in the direction=we hoped, they are still new, and subject to volitility, especially if 
new=original content is not added on a minimum of a weekly basis. I have been =orbideen to add new content to the 
philanthrophic site as well as the scie=ce site, and therefore, as a result our rating slipped down (still on the =irst page, 
but would have liked them (and some of the articles to been abl= to push Huffington off page). We also helped with you 
images, and the fir=t images that come of you on a google search are not of your mug shot, etc= 
Your daily beast foe is still at it, and trying =o promote her sites against you in the same way that we try to depromote 
y=u. 
As far as this site is concerned, and the continuation of this, I do not know what you wish to do. Clearly, you =ave no 
interest in my continuing. And, I am not sure if you want to contin=e the project at all. If the latter, and you stop, 
eventually it will just=go into the way of entropy, and it will return to the old form. The major =ork has been done, but it 
needs to be maintained. For it to get better res=lts, it needs to have constant input and supervision, and that means 
gener=ting proper content, not just editing and grammatical fixes. Writers need =o know what to write. THe 
philanthrophy site is at the bottom of the page =recisely because you have not allowed us to add any content to it, and 
as = result it suffers.
