(c) 
The Issuer has not and will not elect to be treated other than as a corporation for 
U.S. federal, state or local income or franchise tax purposes and shall make any election 
necessary to avoid classification as a partnership or disregarded entity for U.S. federal, state or 
local tax purposes. 
(d) 
The Issuer shall not file, or cause to be filed, any income or franchise tax return in 
any state of the United States unless it shall have obtained an Opinion of Counsel prior to such 
filing that, under the laws of such jurisdiction, the Issuer is required to file such income or 
franchise tax return. 
(e) 
The Issuer will provide, upon request of a Holder of Subordinated Securities, any 
information that such Holder reasonably requests to assist such Holder with regard to any filing 
requirements the Holder may have as a result of the controlled foreign corporation rules under 
the Code. 
(f) 
The Issuer shall not (i) become the owner of any asset (A) that is treated as an 
equity interest in an entity that is treated as a partnership or other fiscally transparent entity for 
United States federal income tax purposes or (B) the gain from the disposition of which would be 
subject to United States federal income or withholding tax under section 897 or section 1445, 
respectively, of the Code or (C) if the ownership or disposition of such asset would cause the 
Issuer to be engaged in a trade or business within the United States for United States federal 
income tax purposes or (ii) engage in any activity that would cause the Issuer to be subject to 
United States federal income tax on a net income basis; provided, however, that a Tax Subsidiary 
may become the owner of a Equity Workout Security if the acquisition, ownership and 
disposition of such Equity Workout Security would not cause any income or gain of the Issuer 
that is not derived from such Equity Workout Security to be treated as income or gain that is 
effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business of the Issuer within the United 
States for United States federal income tax purposes (other than as a result of a change in law 
after the acquisition of such Equity Workout Security). 
(g) 
The Issuer (or the Investment Manager acting on behalf of the Issuer) will not 
acquire a Collateral Obligation if the purpose of the acquisition of such Collateral Obligation is 
to accommodate a request from a Securities Lending Counterparty to borrow such Collateral 
Obligation under a Securities Lending Agreement. 
(h) 
The Issuer (or the Investment Manager acting on behalf of the Issuer) will take 
such reasonable actions, consistent with law and its obligations under this Indenture, as are 
necessary to achieve FATCA Compliance. 
(i) 
The Co-Issuer has not and will not elect to be treated as other than a disregarded 
entity for U.S. federal, state or local tax purposes.
