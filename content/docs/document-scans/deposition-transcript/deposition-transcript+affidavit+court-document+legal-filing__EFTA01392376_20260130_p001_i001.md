TAX, REGULATORY AND CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS 
CERTAIN U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS 
The following discussion is a brief summary of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations that may be 
applicable to an investment in the Access Fund. This discussion is based upon the Code, existing U.S. 
Treasury Regulations, and judicial decisions and administrative interpretations thereunder, all as of the date 
of this Memorandum, all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect, or are subject to 
different interpretations. We cannot assure you that the IRS will not take a different position regarding one 
or more of the tax considerations described below. We have not obtained and do not intend to obtain a 
ruling from the IRS or an opinion of counsel with respect to the U.S. federal tax considerations resulting 
from acquiring, holding or disposing of the Limited Partnership Interests. 
This discussion does not address all U.S. federal income tax considerations that may be important to a 
particular Limited Partner in light of the Limited Partner's circumstances or to certain categories of Limited 
Partners that may be subject to special rules (such as financial institutions, insurance companies, dealers in 
securities. U.S. expatriates, Limited Partners whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, or persons 
who hold the Interests as part of a hedge, conversion transaction, straddle or other risk reduction transaction 
or otherwise as part of a "synthetic asset"). This discussion is limited to beneficial owners who purchase 
the Interests for cash at original issuance from the Access Fund. This discussion also does not address the 
tax considerations arising under the laws of any foreign, state or local jurisdiction or the U.S. federal income 
tax consequences to tax-exempt entities and non-U.S. persons of an investment in the Access Fund. In 
addition, this discussion should be read in conjunction with the discussion of tax considerations contained 
in the Underlying Fund PPM, as the tax consequences described therein could have a material impact on 
Limited Partners and their investment in the Access Fund. 
The U.S. federal income tax considerations discussed in this summary are applicable to Limited Partners 
who or that are U.S. persons. Limited Partners who are not U.S. persons should consult their own tax 
advisors regarding the United States income tax consequences of an investment in the Access Fund. For 
purposes of this summary, a "U.S. person" generally is for U.S. federal income tax purposes (1) an 
individual citizen or resident of the United States; (2) a corporation (or other entity treated as a corporation 
for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any 
state thereof or the District of Columbia; (3) an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income 
taxation regardless of its source; or (4) a trust which either (i) is subject to the primary supervision of a 
court within the United States and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial 
decisions of the trust or (ii) has a valid election in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations to be 
treated as a U.S. person. If an entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds the 
Interests, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of the partnership and an equity holder of the partnership 
generally depends upon the status of the equity holder and the activities of the partnership. If you are an 
equity holder in such a partnership holding the Interests, you should consult your own tax advisors. 
This summary is based on the assumptions that each Limited Partner (i) will provide all appropriate 
certifications to the Access Fund in a timely fashion to minimize withholding, including backup 
withholding and withholding under FATCA, on its distributive share of the Access Fund's income; (ii) will 
hold its Interests as a capital asset for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and (iii) holds its Interests for its 
own account and not as an agent or nominee for another person. Each prospective Limited Partner should 
also note that this summary does not address the interaction of U.S. federal tax laws and any income or 
estate tax treaties between the United States and any other jurisdiction.
