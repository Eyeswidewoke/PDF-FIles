band's dissolution. While visiting relatives in Detroit, Kendricks called Otis Williams who, desperately 
needing two more members for an audition for Gordy's label, offered Kendricks a lead singer place in his 
new group. Kendricks agreed on the condition he bring Paul Williams with him. Otis Williams happily 
agreed and Kendricks and Paul Williams moved back to Detroit to join the new group. 
The original name for the new lineup of Otis Williams, Melvin Franklin, Elbridge "Al" Bryant, Eddie 
Kendricks, and Paul Williams was the Elgins. Under that name, the group auditioned for Motown in 
March 1961. Already impressed with some of the members after hearing session work, Berry Gordy 
agreed to sign the group to the Motown imprint, Miracle. However, before signing, Gordy discovered 
another group was using the name of Elgins. The group began tossing about ideas for a new name on 
the steps of the Hitsville U.S.A. studio. On a suggestion from Miracle Records employee Billy Mitchell, 
songwriter Mickey Stevenson, and group members Otis Williams and Paul Williams, The Temptations 
became the group's new moniker. The "Elgins" name would re-surface at Motown in 1965, when Gordy 
renamed a quartet called The Downbeats as The Elgins. 
The Temptations' first two singles, "Oh Mother of Mine" and "Check Yourself", with Paul Williams on 
lead, were released on Miracle before Gordy closed the label down and reassigned the band to his latest 
imprint, Gordy Records. On the Gordy imprint, Eddie Kendricks sang lead on the Temptations' first 
charted single, "Dream Come True", which peaked at #22 on the R&B chart in 1962. Later that year, the 
Temptations began touring as part of the Motortown Revue. The group would issue eight recordings 
between 1961 and 1963 without much success. Paul Williams and Eddie Kendricks split the leads during 
this early period, with Al Bryant, Otis Williams, and Melvin Franklin occasionally singing lead, as they 
would on a song titled "Isn't She Pretty". For a brief time, the group almost had their name changed to 
The Pirates, and recorded the songs "Mind Over Matter" and "I'll Love You Till I Die" under that name. 
Eventually the label and the group decided against it. One hit song, "Do You Love Me", was originally set 
to be recorded by the Temptations. When he couldn't get a hold of the group, Gordy produced a version 
for The Contours. In 1963, the Temptations began working with Smokey Robinson as producer and 
writer. Robinson's first work with the group was the Paul Williams-led "I Want a Love I Can See". While 
the song failed to chart, it did eventually become a popular live performance spot for the group and 
particularly for Paul Williams in general. Due to their lack of hits, the group was given the nickname, 
"The Hitless Temptations". 
During this time, David Ruffin began following the group around as he aspired to join the group. During a 
local Detroit performance, Ruffin joined the group onstage and impressed the group with his vocal talent 
and dancing skills. Following that same time, Al Bryant had grown frustrated with the group's lack of 
success and became restless and uncooperative, preferring the mundane routine of his day job as a 
milkman over the rigors of rehearsal and performing. After a heated quarrel with Paul and hitting him in 
the head with a beer bottle following a disastrous performance at the 1963 Motown company 
Christmas/New Years Eve party, Bryant was summarily fired from the group. As a result, David Ruffin 
was brought in as his replacement in January 1964. Though Ruffin's brother Jimmy was also considered 
for the slot, David was selected following his performance with them in 1963. Bryant continued to 
perform in a number of other local groups, and died at the age of 36 in Flagler County, Florida of liver 
cirrhosis on October 26, 1975.
