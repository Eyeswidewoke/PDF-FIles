(xii) 
"USD-CMT-T7051" means that the rate for a Reset Date will be a percentage 
equal to the yield for United States Treasury securities at "constant maturity" for a period of the 
Designated Maturity and for that Reset Date as set forth in H.15(519) under the caption "Treasury 
constant maturities", as such yield is displayed on the Reuters Screen FRBCMT Page for the 
Reset Date on the day that is two U.S. Government Securities Business Days prior to that Reset 
Date. If such rate does not appear on the Reuters Screen FRBCMT Page, the rate for that Reset 
Date will be a percentage equal to the yield for United States Treasury, securities at "constant 
maturity" for a period of the Designated Maturity and for that Reset Date as set forth in 
H.I5(519) under the caption `Treasury constant maturities". If such rate does not appear in 
H.15(519), the rate for that Reset Date will be the rate for a period of the Designated Maturity as 
may then be published by either the Federal Reserve System Board of Governors or the United 
States Department of the Treasury that the Calculation Agent determines to be comparable to the 
rate which would otherwise have been published in H.15-519. 
If on the day that is two U.S. Government Securities Business Days preceding a Reset 
Date the Federal Reserve System Board of Governors or the United States Department of the 
Treasury does not publish a yield on United States Treasury securities at "constant maturity" for a 
period of the Designated Maturity, the rate for that Reset Date will be calculated by the 
Calculation Agent and will be a yield-to-maturity based on the arithmetic mean of the secondary 
market bid prices at approximately 3:30 p.m., New York City time, on the day that is two U.S. 
Government Securities Business Days preceding that Reset Date, of three leading primary United 
States government securities dealers in New York City selected by the Calculation Agent (from 
five such dealers and eliminating the highest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the 
highest) and the lowest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the lowest)) for United 
States Treasury securities with an original maturity equal to the Designated Maturity, a remaining 
term to maturity no more than one year shorter than the Designated Maturity and in a 
Representative Amount. If fewer than five but more than two such prices are provided as 
requested, the rate for that Reset Date will be based on the arithmetic mean of the bid prices 
obtained and neither the highest nor lowest of such quotations will be eliminated. If fewer than 
three prices are provided as requested, the rate for that Reset Date will be calculated by the 
Calculation Agent and will be a yield-to-maturity based on the arithmetic mean of the secondary 
market bid prices as of approximately 3:30 p.m., New York City time, on the day that is two U.S. 
Government Securities Business Days preceding that Reset Date of three leading primary United 
States government securities dealers in New York City selected by the Calculation Agent (from 
five such dealers and eliminating the highest quotation (or, in the event of equality, one of the 
highest) and the lowest quotation (or. in the event of equality, one of the lowest)) for United 
States Treasury securities with an original maturity greater than the Designated Maturity, a 
remaining term to maturity closest to the Designated Maturity and in a Representative Amount. 
If fewer than five but more than two such prices are provided, the rate for that Reset Date will be 
based on the arithmetic mean of the bid prices obtained and neither the highest nor lowest of such 
quotations will be eliminated. If two United States Treasury securities with an original maturity 
greater than the Designated Maturity have remaining terms to maturity equally close to the 
Designated Maturity. the quotes for the Treasury security with the shorter original term to 
maturity will be used. 
(xiii) 
"USD-CMT-T7052" means that the rate for a Reset Date will be a percentage 
equal to the one-week average yield for United States Treasury securities at "constant maturity" 
for a period of the Designated Maturity and for the week preceding that Reset Date as set forth in 
H.15(519) under the caption 'Week Ending" and opposite the caption 'Treasury constant 
maturities", as such yield is displayed on the Reuters Screen FEDCMT Page for the week
