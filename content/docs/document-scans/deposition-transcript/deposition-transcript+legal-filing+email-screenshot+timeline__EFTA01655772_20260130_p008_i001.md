Jury Convicts Iowa Police Chief of Lying to Feds to Acquire Machine Guns 
The Associated Press (02/15, Dura) reported that the police chief of a small Iowa town was convicted by a federal 
jury Wednesday of lying to federal authorities to acquire machine guns prosecutors say he sold for his own profit. 
The jury convicted Adair Police Chief Brad Wendt, 47, of conspiring to make false statements to the federal Bureau 
of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, making false statements to the agency, and illegal possession of a 
machine gun. He was convicted on 11 of 15 charges. The article quoted FBI Omaha Special Agent in Charge Eugene 
Kowel, who said, "In a stark abuse of the position of trust he held, Brad Wendt exploited his position as chief of 
police to unlawfully obtain and sell guns for his own personal profit, when so many law enforcement officers in our 
country are working to protect our communities and uphold the law, Brad Wendt did exactly the opposite." 
FBI Searches Homes of Fire Dept. Chiefs in Corruption Investigation 
The New York Times (02/15, Rashbaum, Rothfeld) reported that FBI agents early Thursday searched the homes of 
two senior New York Fire Department chiefs responsible for overseeing safety inspections on building projects, 
people with knowledge of the matter said. At the same time, city investigators searched and sealed off the chiefs' 
offices at the department's headquarters in Brooklyn. The article added that the coordinated searches in Staten 
Island and Harlem were carried out as part of a corruption investigation that was initially focused on whether the 
chiefs had been paid nearly $100,000 each in a scheme to help expedite or arrange building inspections. The 
investigation began late last summer and was being conducted by the FBI, the U.S. Attorney's office for the 
Southern District of New York, and the New York City Department of Investigation. CBS News (02/15, Staff Writer), 
and the New York Post (02/15, Celona, McCarthy, Crane) also reported on the story. 
Ex-Illinois Lawmaker Abruptly Pleads Guilty to Fraud and Money Laundering, Halting Federal Trial 
The Associated Press (02/15, O'Connor) reported that former Illinois lawmaker and gubernatorial candidate 
William "Sam" McCann abruptly pleaded guilty on Thursday to nine felony counts of wire fraud, money laundering 
and tax evasion, halting his federal corruption trial over misusing up to $550,000 in campaign contributions. The 
article added that McCann, who cut off negotiations over a plea deal last fall when he dismissed his court-
appointed attorneys, made the reversal on the third day of a bench trial before U.S. District Court Judge Colleen 
Lawless. His latest lawyer, Jason Vincent, of Springfield, asked that he be released from custody as part of the deal, 
but Lawless nixed the idea, telling McCann his only option was to offer a no-strings open plea. The article noted 
that a state senator from 2011 to 2019, McCann formed the Conservative Party of Illinois to campaign for governor 
in 2018. A criminal indictment in 2021 outlined numerous schemes McCann employed to convert contributions 
from his campaign committees to buy vehicles, pay an overdue loan, two mortgages, credit card bills, and fund a 
family vacation, entertainment, and other purchases. The article mentioned that for his unsuccessful run for 
governor, he collected more than $3 million dollars from Local 150 of the International Union of Operating 
Engineers alone. Despite being questioned four times by FBI and IRS agents in the summer of 2018 about alleged 
improper spending, he tore through $340,000 in leftover campaign funds for personal expenses in the year after 
the election. 
North Carolina Search Warrant Sheds Light on Mysterious Therapy Camp Death of 12-Year-Old Boy 
Fox News (02/16, Price) reported that new details have emerged in what authorities are calling a "suspicious" 
death of a 12-year-old boy at a North Carolina wilderness therapy camp for troubled teens. The Transylvania 
County Sheriff's Office executed two search warrants as part of its investigation into the boy's death at Trails 
Carolina less than 24 hours after he enrolled. The warrants include affidavits revealing the shocking scene first 
responders encountered when they arrived on Feb. 2. Transylvania County Sheriff's Office Det. John Nicholson said 
Trails Carolina "has not completely cooperated" with the investigation, although the camp insists it has done 
everything it can do. The article added that when responders arrived at the camp, the boy was lying face up in a 
CPR mask on the floor of a bunk house. His knees were bent, his arms were on his chest and his body was "cold to 
the touch," the warrant stated. He was wearing a hoodie and T-shirt, but his pants and underwear lay next to his 
shoulder. Detectives also noted discoloration of the boy's skin and possible bruising near the eyes. Camp 
counselors told detectives they didn't know why the boy wasn't wearing pants or underwear. The article stated that 
the FBI is assisting the Transylvania County Sheriff's Office with the investigation, a spokeswoman confirmed. The 
case is being investigated as possible manslaughter.
