Title: Re: LSJ Dear Jeffrey, 
I am really sorry to agree with you when you say that "this doesn't seem to be working", I mean the 
way we are or rather not communicating. 
The kitchen landing was drawn according to the as-built drawing provided to me by Shane. While the 
landing is hidden behind a wall in the 3-d view, It is apparent on the drawing #T 103- "Terrace view 
with plants" that there is a space left there. It's less visible, and I agree with you, can be kind of 
confusing on the drawing T#102, because of the similar stone texture given to the walls of the stairs 
and of the kitchen building. 
The stairs should not be a major issue from the kitchen bay since they are located below and on the 
right side of the kitchen building. With the succession of terraces cascading on both sides of the 
staircase, and with a carefully chosen planting scheme, the stairs will look fully integrated to the 
landscape and be part of the architectural interest of this part of the island. As far as your comment, 
"To go east before going west" - the design allows the number of steps required to traverse the 
elevation change without encroaching any space upon the road, and to provide also a direct access to 
the bicycle parking. 
It does take more than ten minutes, at least when you are confronted with your drawing board and a 
desire to provide the best design possible, to make even a simple architectural sketch by hand or by 
computer. Especially when we are addressing parts of the site that are already existing, such as the 
first section of the staircase , the kitchen and the master suite buildings. 
I hope that you will understand that I am not trying to argue with you but only to make you realize 
that those sketches are not absent minded ones but the result of a serious desire to find an adequate 
solution to the landscaping of this part of your property. 
As I said before, I do understand and accept your comments and do try to answer them. But, it's 
hard to make any progress with this kind of non-communication of which I am putting the entire 
blame on myself. 
However in these conditions you will certainly agree with me that I may not be the right person to 
work with in regard of the landscaping of Little Saint James. 
Very sincerely and with my very best regards. 
Christian. 
im sorry„ this doesn;'t seem to be working. your designs are not functional. one has 
to go east before going west. the view from the kitchen is teh service entrance, your 
drawings show no kitchen landing, the stairs are now a focal point though we 
discussed repeatedly their disappearance„ there is no connection to the road and 
office pavillion„ I asked that you NOT send me these type of presentation„ it takes 
your time and is so clearly not right that a pencil and paper , no more than ten 
minutes is required to find better solutions.
