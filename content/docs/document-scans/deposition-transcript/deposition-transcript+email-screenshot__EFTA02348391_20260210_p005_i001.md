THE shape , ex, a hemisphere bowl in 3 space, analogy, one can put marbles in the bowl and they will map a path to 
the bottom. but the shape of the bowl . determines how fast they move, and in which direction, . the shape of the bowl 
is the language. there is a shape for vision as well. . it exists without input, certain paths are more probable etc. 
3. I will contact Yang

rote: 
Valeria's not here right now, so will have to check with her about late September. Really intriguing possibilities, and a 
delightful offer. 
On Yang, I read his work quite differently. He does make use of word frequencies and probability distributions, but as 
far as I am aware in pretty straightforward and innocuous ways. And he's quite sophisticated about these matters. 
Smart and interesting guy. You might want to contact him directly. 
I don't recall his using Zipf's "laws," but it wouldn't matter much. Mandelbrot showed back in the '50s that they were a 
statistical artifact, near meaningless. I was, incidentally, surprised to see how he dealt with this result in his 
autobiography. I think he called it his "Keplerian moment," or something like that.

I think you might try to plan on late september, , taking my apt and spending a few days with valeria in the city, As it is 
the openiing of the UN general assembly , as well as the Clinton global initiative New york is rife with people with at 
least influence, if not new ideas. . I , we. can organize many fun interactions. my house becomes a respite for the 
select few, to take off their ties , and talk openly. You would be welcome to join as many create or participate as you 
prefer. yangs work deals with language as signals . his reliance on Zipf like distributions is a good example of naive 
probablities.. empirically zipf appears. but cannot be derived from any of his or anyones elses to date. so somewhat 
misleading to suggest the" probililty of word , x appearing, " it is the mistake of frequency vs probablity, and careless 
common usage.

Sounds like a most interesting person. And someone it would be very interesting to talk to. I presume he spends time in 
NY. Hope we can work it out. 
Would be interested in learning more about your critique of the use of probability in language work, mostly by 
computational cognitive scientists, as far as I know. I've written critiques of it too, but on different grounds: failure to 
account for what they are trying to show, or even to understand the issue. There are, I think, some notable exceptions, 
like the recent work of Charles Yang, one of Bob Berwick's students.
