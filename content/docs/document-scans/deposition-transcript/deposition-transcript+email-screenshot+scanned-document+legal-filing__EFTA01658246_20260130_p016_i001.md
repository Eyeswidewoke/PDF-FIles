The Federalist (7/29, Davis, 126K) reports that House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff "is 
once again assisting and amplifying a foreign influence operation meant to divide Congress and 
the American people, multiple lawmakers told The Federalist on Wednesday. Schiff called a 
surprise hearing of his committee Wednesday "to vote on making Schiff's classified allegations 
against congressional Republicans available for review to the entire House of Representatives. 
The vote passed on party lines. At issue is a packet of information that was allegedly sent to 
several Republicans by Ukrainian politician Andriy Derkach." Derkach "told Politico last week 
that his goal was to "creat(e) an inter-parliamentary association called 'Friends of Ukraine STOP 
Corruption." Derkach "said he sent the same materials to several Democrats as well." 
Brennan Memoir Says Trump Denied Him Access To Documents And Notes. 
The Washington Post (7/29, Harris, 14.2M) reports that when former CIA director John Brennan 
decided to write a memoir in the fall of 2018, "he asked the agency for his official records, 
including his notes and any documents that he had reviewed and signed that were classified." 
But the request was denied in "a break with decades of tradition." Brennan "learned that the 
CIA was following the orders of the man he had spent the previous two years publicly 
excoriating." In his memoir, Brennan writes that Trump "had issued a directive...that 
purportedly forbids anyone in the intelligence community from sharing classified information 
with me." Brennan's book, "Undaunted: My Fight Against America's Enemies, at Home and 
Abroad," is "scheduled to be published on Oct. 6." 
NBC News (7/29, 6.14M) reports that, "in the book, Brennan said he'd been trying for 
months to get a hold of his records and notes, but kept running into brick walls." The Post 
quoted the book "as saying Trump 'had issued a directive . . . that purportedly forbids anyone 
in the intelligence community from sharing classified information with me' in August of 2018." 
The Hill (7/29, Moreno, 2.98M) reports Mark Zaid, an attorney "who has represented 
government whistleblowers and former intelligence agency employees who have gone on to 
write memoirs, told the Post that the blocking of the records was 'unprecedented, as far as I 
know." He said, "This is demonstrative, once again, of a vindictive, political president whose 
actions have nothing to do with actual national security decisions." 
The Washington Examiner (7/29, Chaitin, 448K) reports the White House "confirmed the 
directive was being enforced, which is news considering the New York Times reported in May of 
last year that the president never revoked Brennan's security clearance." 
Brennan Book Says McConnell, Nunes Were Silent In Face Of Evidence Of 
Russian Election Meddling. The New York Times (7/29, Barnes, 18.61M) reports that in the 
waning days of the Obama Administration as "intelligence officials laid out evidence of Russia's 
2016 election interference campaign to congressional leaders," some congressional leaders 
called for Russia to be punished, but Senate Majority Leader McConnell and then-House 
intelligence Chairman Nunes "remained silent," according to Brennan's book. Brennan writes, "I 
was not surprised that McConnell and Nunes, early and ardent partisan defenders of Mr. Trump, 
were silent in the face of what everyone else recognized was a clear national security threat." 
FireEye Reports New Disinformation Campaign From Eastern Europe. 
Business Insider (7/29, Elder, 3.67M) reports that researchers with cybersecurity firm FireEye 
"have discovered a sophisticated disinformation campaign originating in Eastern Europe that 
they believe could be aimed at disrupting the 2020 US election." BI adds that "bad actors are 
hacking media websites to post fraudulent stories, creating fake journalist personas, and 
spreading anti-US disinformation, researchers from FireEye warned Wednesday. The tactics are 
reminiscent of Russian meddling around the 2016 election - but are significantly more 
sophisticated, researchers say."
