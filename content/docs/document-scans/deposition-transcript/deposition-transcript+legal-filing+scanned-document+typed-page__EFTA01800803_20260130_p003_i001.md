variations in the way they are collected and processed, they can be tricky to compare. Horvath worried: "How do you 
make data s=ts comparable if they were generated by different labs using different protocols?" 
Building on work by Andrew Teschendorff at University College London, Horvath devised a way to normalize 
methylation profiles and put them all on the same footing. Beyond that, his audacious strategy for dealing with some of 
the uncertainty was to ignore it — and hope that it didn't clobb=r the accuracy of his model. 
It didn't. By early 2012, his algorithm was using 16 CpG sites in the genome, and was returning correlations with 
chronological age of 96% in nine kinds of tissue. The accuracy was astonishing: median errors were within three years 
for blood samples and just 18 months for cheek swabs. 
But the editors of two journals rejected Horvath's paper. The "tenor of the reviewers was that it w=s just too 
good to be true," he says. They suspect=d that the clock model fit the training data used to build it but that Horvath had 
insufficient test data to validate it thoroughly. 
Humbled but undaunted, Horvath continued collecting data sets and expanding the algorithm. By December 
2012, his methylation database spanned 51 types of non-cancerous tissue and cells, plus 20 kinds of cancer. The age 
estimator had grown to include 353 CpG sites. 
He had completed his analyses and was preparing to rewrite his paper from scratch when his pregnant wife's 
waters broke — more than three months ahe=d of her due date. For the next 20 days, he barely left the chair beside her 
hospital bed while she and the medical staff tried to stave off infection and premature delivery. 
The stress focused him. "I wrote every hour as i= it was the last hour I had for finishing the article," he says. He 
made good progress, as did=his wife and their baby. Towards the end of the third week, with Christmas approaching, "I 
started to f=el really hopeful," he says. But suddenly the baby'= heart rate shot up. After an emergency Caesarean 
section, the baby struggled to breathe. 'The doc=ors made a heroic effort," Horvath says, "bu= she died in my hands on 
the day of her delivery. It wasn't until 10 days later that I found enough strength to upload the paper to Genome 
Biology." 
The reviews came back in the spring: more disbelief, and another rejection. Horvath didn't blame the reviewers 
for being sceptical. "Everyo=e who develops biomarkers knows what to expect: a very strong biomarker gives you a 
correlation of, say, 0.6 or 0.7." For example, the correlation betwee= age and the length of telomeres is less than 0.5. 
For Horvath's clock algorithm, that figure is 0.96. He confesses that he had trouble believing it himself until other 
researchers independently confirmed the tight association. 
This time, Horvath refused to take no for an answer. "After reading the reviewers' comments, l= spent the next 
10 minutes doing three things that one should never do," he says. "First, l=went to the fridge and drank three bottles of 
beer as fast as I could. Second, I went back to the computer and drafted a letter to the editor. Third, I sent it off." 
About time 
The appeal worked, and after his articlel=/sup> was featured in the October 2013 issue of Genome Biology, 
others began downloading the epigenetic-clock program from Horvath's website to test it on their own data. Marco 
Boks at the University Medical Centre Utrecht in the Netherlands applied it to blood samples collected from 96 Dutch 
veterans of the war in Afghanistan aged between 18 and 53. The correlation between predicted and actual ages was 
99.7%, with a median error measured in months. 
At Zymo Research, a biotechnology company in Irvine, California, Wei Guo and Kevin Bryant wondered whether 
the program would work on a set of urine samples Zymo had collected from 11 men and women aged between 28 and
