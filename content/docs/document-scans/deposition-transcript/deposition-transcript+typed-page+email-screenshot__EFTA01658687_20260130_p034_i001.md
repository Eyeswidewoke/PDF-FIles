the vaccine approval process with an emergency use authorization before phase 3 trials are 
over." 
The New York Times (9/2, Kaplan, Wu, Thomas, 18.61M) also reports that over the past 
week, both NIAID Director Fauci and Hahn "have said in interviews with news organizations 
that a vaccine could be available for certain groups before clinical trials have been completed, if 
the data is overwhelmingly positive." 
In its lead story last night, ABC World News TonightVi (9/2, lead story, 1:55, Llamas, 
6.93M) sounded a skeptical note about the letter, saying it was "dated on the same day the 
President promised a vaccine at the Republican convention." ABC added that "critics worry a 
vaccine might be rushed, but the White House says the timing has nothing to do with the 
election." ABC World News TonightVi (9/2, story 4, 0:40, Victor Orquendo, 6.93M) later said 
"there's no evidence that a vaccine will be ready by November 1." 
NBC Nightly NewsVi (9/2, story 2, 0:30, Jackson, 5.53M), meanwhile, briefly mentioned 
the story at the tail end of a segment about the "threat" of new infections over the Labor Day 
weekend. Said NBC, "The threat comes as the CDC asked states like California to identify 
possible vaccine distribution sites, trying to get ahead of red tape like permits in case a vaccine 
is developed this year." The Wall Street Journal (9/2, Armour, Subscription Publication, 7.57M), 
New York Post (9/2, Feis, 4.57M) and The Hill (9/2, Wilson, 2.98M), among other news outlets, 
also report the story. 
Fauci Predicts "Safe And Effective" Vaccine By End Of 2020. Fox News (9/2, 
Phillips, 27.59M) reports on its website that Fauci "predicted the US will have a 'safe and 
effective' coronavirus vaccine by the end of 2020." Fox adds Fauci toldVi NBC's Today, "I believe 
that by the time we get to the end of this calendar year that we will feel comfortable that we do 
have a safe and effective vaccine." Breitbart (9/2, Key, 673K) reports, meanwhile, that Fauci 
also "saidVi Wednesday on MSNBC's 'Andrea Mitchell Reports' that by November or December, 
there could be a 'safe and effective vaccine' for coronavirus." 
In its lead story, the CBS Evening NewsVI (9/2, lead story, 2:35, Carter Evans, 4M) cast 
Fauci as "sounding optimistic," and showed him saying, "I would not be comfortable with a 
vaccine unless it was shown in a clinical trial clearly to be safe and effective." 
Democrats To Hold Hearing On "Possible Political Interference." ABC World News 
TonightVi (9/2, story 4, 0:40, Victor Orquendo, 6.93M) reported that upon learning of the letter 
to the nation's governors, "Senate Democrats are calling on the heads of the FDA and the CDC 
to urgently testify and answer questions about possible political interference." 
Along those lines, the Washington Post (9/2, McGinley, Johnson, 14.2M) says "a fierce 
debate has erupted over whether the Food and Drug Administration should use its emergency 
authority to clear a coronavirus vaccine before it is formally approved - a move opponents warn 
could pose safety dangers and inflame anti-vaccination sentiment but others say could save 
thousands of lives by speeding protection from the virus." The Post adds "Trump's repeated 
promise to deliver a safe and effective vaccine this year, 'or maybe even sooner,' has become 
central to his reelection campaign and has sparked concerns in the scientific community in 
particular that the White House could pressure regulators to cut corners." 
Fauci, Birx Dismiss Claims Administration Pursuing "Herd Immunity." 
Politico (9/2, Forgey, 4.29M) reports that on Wednesday, NIAID Director Fauci "argued...that 
the United States should not pursue herd immunity in its fight against the coronavirus - even 
as a top White House adviser has reportedly advocated the strategy and President Donald 
Trump himself invoked it this week." According to Politico, "The remarks from Fauci, who had 
been sidelined from most public appearances for two weeks following vocal cord surgery, come 
amid Trump's elevation of a new health adviser," Scott Atlas, who is described by Politico as "a 
physician with no expertise in infectious diseases or epidemiology."
