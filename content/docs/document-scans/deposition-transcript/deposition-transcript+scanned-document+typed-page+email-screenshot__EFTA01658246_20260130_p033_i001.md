make suburbs 'much worse.'" CNBC (7/29, Wilkie, 3.62M) says on its website, "Trump's tweets 
mark an escalation of his campaign strategy of trying to stoke fear in suburban voters that poor 
urban residents, who are overwhelmingly people of color, will move to their suburbs if low-
income housing is permitted to be built in single-family home neighborhoods." Rolling Stone 
(7/29, Stuart, 12.8M), meanwhile, headlines its story "Trump Is Happy To Inform Suburban 
Voters That He Is Still A Racist." 
Epshteyn: Trump "Just Saved The American Suburb." Writing for Newsweek (7/29, 
1.53M) under the headline "The Trump Administration Just Saved The American Suburb," Boris 
Epshteyn, "strategic advisor for coalitions on the Trump 2020 campaign," calls Trump's move "a 
massive victory for Americans' constitutional rights to local control and self-government, as well 
as a recognition that the federal government's duty to prevent discrimination in housing does 
not supersede its obligation to protect the rights of millions of Americans who abide by race-
neutral zoning laws to create beautiful, vibrant, family-friendly suburban communities." 
Treasury To Loan Postal Service $1OB In Return For "Last-Mile" Contract Details. 
The Washington Post (7/29, Bogage, 14.2M) reports that on Wednesday, the Treasury 
Department "agreed to loan the U.S. Postal Service $10 billion in emergency coronavirus relief 
funding...in exchange for proprietary information about the mail service's most lucrative 
private-sector contracts." The Postal Service "will provide Treasury copies of its 10 largest 
'negotiated service agreements,' or contracts with high-volume third-party shippers such as 
Amazon, FedEx and UPS, and receive a crucial injection of cash that postal officials say will 
keep the debt-laden agency solvent for at least another year." The Postal Service "contracts 
with private-sector shippers for "last-mile" delivery from distribution centers to consumers' 
homes, and it offers those companies small discounts because of the volume of packages they 
provide." 
Reuters (7/29, Lambert, Heavey) says President Trump nominated Postmaster General 
Louis DeJoy "to bring the service's finances in line and he is pushing to cut costs even if it 
means delaying deliveries." According to Reuters, the Postal Service "does not need to borrow 
at the moment, but the money will now be available should the financially strained agency have 
to access it." Treasury Secretary Mnuchin said in a statement, "While the USPS is able to fund 
its operating expenses without additional borrowing at this time, we are pleased to have 
reached an agreement on the material terms and conditions of a loan, should the need arise." 
Ginsburg Undergoes Nonsurgical Medical Procedure. 
The AP (7/29) reports that the Supreme Court said Wednesday that Justice Ruth Bader 
Ginsburg underwent "a nonsurgical medical procedure in New York City and expects to be 
released from a hospital there by the end of the week." A statement from the Court said 
Ginsburg that the minimally invasive procedure was to "revise a bile duct stent" at Memorial 
Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. Citing Ginsburg's doctors, the statement said that "stent 
revisions are common occurrences and the procedure, performed using endoscopy and medical 
imaging guidance, was done to minimize the risk of future infection." 
Obama To Deliver Eulogy At Lewis' Funeral. 
NBC Nightly NewsVi (7/29, story 7, 1:45, Holt, 5.97M) reported that "a long line of mourners 
paying respects to Congressman John Lewis" as he arrived back in the Atlanta district "he 
represented for more than three decades." NBC (Alexander) added, "One final trip home for 
Congressman John Lewis. His procession weaving its way through Atlanta, pausing at the walls 
bearing his image, the street bearing his name, and the final resting place of Dr. Martin Luther 
King Jr., who helped inspire Lewis' lifelong fight for civil rights." NBC added that former 
President Barack Obama will deliver the eulogy at Lewis' funeral on Thursday. In addition to 
Obama, the CBS Evening NewsVi (7/29, story 10, 2:00, O'Donnell, 4.28M) reported, former 
Presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton "will travel to Atlanta for [Thursday's) funeral." Axios
