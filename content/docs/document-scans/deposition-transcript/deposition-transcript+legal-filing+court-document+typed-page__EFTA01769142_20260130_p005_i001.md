ba=ning the symptom would make the problem go away. But pouring saltpeter from=the minarets hasn't worked. "They

has=become Shahr-e Noe." 
UNSURPRISINGLY, THE OUTWARDLY CHASTE=/b> nature of Khomeinist political culture has pe=verted normal 
sexual behavior, creating peculiar curiosities -- and procliv=ties -- among Iranian officialdom. Omid Memarian, a 
journalist who spent se=eral months in the notorious Evin prison for his articles critical of the g=vernment, told me that 
his interrogators seemed far more interested in his s=x life than his political peccadilloes. "I tried to answer their 
questions i= very general terms, but they'd interrupt me," he recalled. "They wanted to=know details. 'Start from when 
you were unbuttoning her blouse...."' l= one instance, he told me, he was horrified when an interrogator appeared t= be 
rubbing himself while listening. 
Observers of American politics -- the land of fil=i [the person who brought him bootlegged films on CD]

Spitzer, Eliot), the revelation of the incident report=dly led Zarei to attempt suicide while in prison.

The shame of sexual malfeasance has been routinely used by=the regime as a form of political coercion and 
intimidation. When the famou=ly jocular reformist cleric Mohammad Ali Abtahi, former vice president to M=hammad 
Khatami, was imprisoned after Iran's contested 2009 presidential ele=tion, he surprised his supporters by confessing 
with great gusto to being p=rt of a Western-backed conspiracy to foment a velvet revolution. Although h=s confession 
was undoubtedly forced, his close associates claim that what c=mpelled him to confess was not physical or psychological 
torture but hidden=photos of him -- in flagrante delicto -- at a secret Tehran love nest t=at was long being monitored. 
=p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:2O.4pt">The=Islamic Republic isn't always so prudish, however. In fact, 
it's been willi=g to use sexual incentives as a form of statecraft. In a =b>Wi=iLeaked U.S. State Department cable, for 
example, senior Ira=i tribal chief Abu Cheffat confided in a U.S. diplomat in Baghdad that Tehr=n effectively wielded 
influence over Iraqi politicians -- ostensibly visiti=g Iran for "medical treatment" -- by offering inducements including 
"tempor=ry marriages" with Iranian women. Not that Cheffat was complaining, mind yo=: The perks were surely better 
than when he visited President George W. Bus= at the White House in 2008. It was not without reason, he explained, 
that l=anian soft power was trumping American hard power in Iraq. 
More recently, three Iranian intelligence agents w=o unsuccessfully tried to kill Israeli government officials in 
Bangkok this=past February photographed themselves at a bar in the beach resort of Patta=a with local "escorts 
<http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/security/280201/su=pects-partied-in-pattaya> ." When I a=ked the scion of a 
powerful cleric in Tehran how ostensible devotees of Kho=eini's religious ideology are able to reconcile frequenting non-
Muslim pros=itutes and drinking alcohol, he quickly dismissed any religious obstacles. "=here are government clerics 
who can easily grant them religious pretexts [<=>mojavez'e Shari<=span>]," he explained. "They can make the case that 
if they didn't freq=ent prostitutes and drink alcohol they would appear to be [terrorists] and r=ise suspicions."
