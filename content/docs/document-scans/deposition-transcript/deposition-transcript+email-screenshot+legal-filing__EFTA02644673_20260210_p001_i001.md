Re: Nigeria 
Dear Jide =1 agree we should meet but for our meeting to be fruitful please give some =nformation in your proposal we 
are willing to sign an NDA agreement with y=u. =Background of Dpworld/Nigeria =We have been many times to Nigeria 
from 2005 till 2018 1-met the previous two presidents at their invitation =2-met the current Lagos Governor at his 
invitation. 
3-Met a private t port owner in Lagos discussed acquisition/ joint venture =t didn't work as he insisted that we pay his 
dividends in dollars while =ur earnings in Nigerian Nira !! 
4- January 2018 met transport minister who was overwhelmed with my present=tion but he offered we build an 
industrial park in Lekki since Port is alr=ady given to a consortium of an indian developer/ Chinese contractor and c=a 
French shipping company to mange I declined the offer as there is no benefit for us to create an industrial =one to 
produce cargo for someone's else port. 
At Dpworld I made a decision that unless we get what a compelling offer we =tay away from Nigeria until such a time. 
The only way we will invest in Nigeria : 
1-As a green field in Badagry which had good infrastructure 
2- a brown field port in Lagos area either acquire an existing terminal . 
I am in dubai till end if this month =But it's meaningless to meet without the information on what is proposed =o I can 
study and correspond with you our precise interest . 
Yours
