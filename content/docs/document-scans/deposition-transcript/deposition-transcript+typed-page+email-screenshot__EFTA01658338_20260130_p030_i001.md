WWBT-TVVI Richmond, VA (7/28, 29K) reported White House Coronavirus Task Force Response 
Coordinator Deborah Birx visited Richmond Tuesday to meet with Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam 
(D) and state health officials. Birx "gave some recommendations to possibly help mitigate this 
upward trend in numbers. Among those recommendations: 100% mask wearing by everyone in 
public. She also suggested that Virginians avoid going to bars and limiting groups to 10 or less." 
WTVR-TVVI Richmond, VA (7/28, 24K) reported that Birx "also touched on ways to improve test 
turnaround times, which can sometimes take more than a week." Birx: "Many tests have moved 
toward the South to provide more rapid diagnosis in their critical situation. I think though we do 
need incredibly additional help from our university structure." 
WRIC-TVVI Richmond (VA)'s 8 News at 6PM (7/28, 54K) reported that Northam "is taking 
[Birx's] advice, but not all of it." Birx "told the governor to go further to prevent the kind of 
surges we're seeing in other states." Birx: "What always worries me is if there are people who 
have gone to the Virginia Beach area or the Portsmouth area or the Hampton area and 
unknowingly bring that virus back." 
Kodak Lands $765M Federal Loan For Pharmaceutical Manufacture. 
USA Today (7/28, Fritze, Subramanian, 10.31M) reports President Trump "returned to the 
briefing room Tuesday to tout his administration's deal with camera company Kodak to 
manufacture pharmaceuticals." The Wall Street Journal (7/28, Levy, Subscription Publication, 
7.57M) reports Kodak has been awarded a $765 million government loan through the Defense 
Production Act, to help improve domestic production of drugs to treat a variety of medical 
conditions and decrease US dependence on foreign supply chains. The company is preparing to 
develop ingredients for generic drugs as the US seeks to shift its reliance from countries like 
China and India. The official White House Twitter account said, "We are building the greatest 
medical arsenal in history!" 
The Washington Examiner (7/28, Doyle, 448K) reports, "A new division, Kodak 
Pharmaceuticals, is expected to create 350 jobs, senior administration officials said during a call 
with reporters Tuesday." The Washington Times (7/28, Howell, 492K) says Trump "has made 
domestic manufacturing one of the linchpins of his agenda. However, the pandemic exposed the 
extent to which the U.S. still relies on China, India and other countries with lax labor and 
environmental standards to produce its goods, medicines and health supplies." 
Appearing on Fox Business' Mornings With Maria (7/28), Director of Trade and 
Manufacturing Policy Navarro said, "This project with Kodak is going to be amazing. And it 
started with the President months ago telling my office, 'Hey, we need to bring those supply 
chains back.' And then he made a critical creative decision, when he signed an executive order 
that enabled the Development Finance Corporation...to figure out ways to finance bringing 
those supply chains home." WR0C-TVVI Rochester, NY (7/28, 24K) reported that Navarro "says 
this will help with American pharmaceutical independence." WHEC-TVVi Rochester, NY (7/28, 
26K) showed Navarro saying, "And by the way, raise wages in the process because we'll be 
more productive. That's the beauty of the American Way here." 
Twitter Removes Trump Retweet Of Video With Controversial COVID Claims. 
David Muir said on ABC World News TonightVI (7/28, story 2, 3:45, 7.32M) that President 
Trump is "under fire for sending mixed messages about the virus. [After] several days last 
week, telling Americans, wear a mask, that they work, they should social distance," Trump then 
retweeted "a video of a controversial doctor overnight." ABC's Jonathan Karl: "Trump is once 
again downplaying the C0VID-19 threat and hyping a discredited treatment." Trump: "Many 
doctors think it is extremely successful, the hydroxychloroquine." Karl: "This after the President 
again used his Twitter account to spread misinformation, tweeting video of a doctor denouncing 
the use of masks and promoting hydroxychloroquine, the controversial anti-malaria drug the 
President's top health officials have warned is ineffective and potentially dangerous as a C0VID-
