Attorney's 011iec has a different view of the case and that has been no coordination with state 
authorities.6
In addition. Ms. wires 
that Mr. Epstein's sentence include a registerable 
offense. As you know, requiring sexual offender registration will have a significant impact both 
immediately and forever idler. This harsh term. which is said to be suggested by the FBi. was 
added despite the fact that the State believed that Mr. Epstein's conduct did not warrant any such 
registration. As yin( know, state officials have special expertise in deciding which offenders 
pose a threat to their community. Moreover, this demand places the state pmsecutors* credibility 
at issue and diminishes the force of sexual registration when it is applied to offenders who state 
prosecutors do not believe are dangerous or require registration. Ms. IM's 
decision not to 
permit the State Attorney to determine a matter uniquely within its province was unwarranted. 
What is more. when negotiating the selfitmaza portion of the Ageement. Ms. 
insisted that a civil settlement provision be included in the Agreement. namely, the inc usion of 
IS 
2255, a negotiating term which is unprecedented in nature" While we were 
reluctant and cautious about a plea agreement in whit; a criminal defendant gives up certain 
rights to contest liability for a civil settlement. Ms.

aese unprecedented terms. For instance. w n p ea discussion stalled as a result of 
Ms. 
's demands, Mr. Lipstein's counsel received a letter from her slating as it "now 
appears you will not settle." Al this point. Ms. 
expressed her intention to re-launch the 
government's previously sct aside money laundering investigation. She also issued a rash of 
subpoenas and sent target letters to Mr. Epstein's employees. adding new ledend charges 
including obstruction of justice. She then personally called Mr. Epstein's largest and most 
valued business client without any basis to inform him of the investigation. 
In an attempt to prevent further persecution and intimidation tactics. we proposed that 
Mr. Epstein establish a restitution fund specifically far the settlement of the identified 
individuals' civil claims and that an impartial, independent representative be appointed to 
administer that fund. There was no dollar amount limit discussed for the fund. hut the idea was 
still rejected. We then pointed out that the state charges to which' Mr. Epstein was lie plead guilty 
tuned with it a state restitution provision that would allow "victims" to recover damages. Ms. 
however, rejected this idea and suggested requiring a guardian ad 'item. implying that
