Update : Case management on High Risk accounts III 
Below please find an update on the pending high risk completions. My recommendation to process more quickly through the cases 
would be to request the following two exceptions from Compliance/KYC: 
Certificate of Good Standing - COGS should be required every 12-15 months. Requesting this certificate every six months is 
(1) costly to the client: (2) annoying; and (3) time consuming. What is the rational behind the 6 month request and how was that 
period of time chosen for this certification; 
FinCen - Once we provide evidence of requesting the FinCen form from the client, we should move the KYC to the next 
stage with a 60 day grace period to obtain them. 
Updates in red below.
