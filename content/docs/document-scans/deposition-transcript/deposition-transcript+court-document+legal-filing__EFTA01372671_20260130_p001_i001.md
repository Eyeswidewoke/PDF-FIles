As you probably know, the FinCEN CDD Rule goes into effect on Friday, May 11, 2018. In short, the rule requires 
financial institutions to obtain a certification of beneficial ownership ("CDD Form") from certain legal entity clients. Trusts 
and Estates are the most common type of exclusion we will see in WM—if you believe your account holder may be 
excluded, please reach out to AFC (Janice, Yoonsun, KG, or Wayne) for confirmation. The attached training presentation 
contains multiple slides on excluded entity types. 
The CDD Form must be completed by the client, and cannot be pre-filled by anyone at Deutsche Bank. Beginning 
on May 11m, the completed and signed CDD Form must be included with all KYC Cases and all Account Opening 
Requests for review and validation. 
For Clients who are within scope for the rule, no account may be opened without the form. There will be no exceptions. 
For all eligible clients, the CDD Form must be provided with all required KYC documentation during the KYC New Client 
Adoption process, as well as during the Regular Review process where form is not already on file, and during the Event 
Driven Review process. 
After the first account is opened using a newly obtained CDD Form, it must be verified (in writing) with the person who 
signed it, to be current, prior to each subsequent account opening. Alternatively, a new form may be obtained. During 
regular review, if there have been no changes to the information contained in the form, then the client may either provide 
a new one, or simply provide written confirmation. 
At this time, all in flight KYC cases for eligible legal entity account holders which were submitted prior to close of business 
on Thursday, May 10th will be given a 60 day temporary exception to obtain the CDD Form. 
The full text of the rule, as well as a training presentation, and frequently asked questions document are all attached to 
this email. 
The CDD Form has been posted to the WM portal, under KYC Forms. The direct link is:
