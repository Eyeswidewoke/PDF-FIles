face. Their fear appeared obvious=to me. I began to catalog many of my friends' different maneuvers =o dispel the 
anxiety that they found so difficult to endure. The more I fo=used on their mental processes (as well as my own) the 
more I began t= see a structure to the mental endeavor and to understand what I had, as a=child, found so difficult to 
explain. 
FP: Tell us about the Control Factor, what you describe as Q=9Cthat effort our minds enga ge in in order to keep 
us blind" and that "process of a voiding seeing the threats we face." It's also about, as yo= state, trying to believe that 
the threat is under our control, when in fa=t it is not. Kindly enlighten us as to these profound insights you make 
in=terms of the Control Factor. 
Siegel: First, let's distinguish the "real w=rld" where real battles are taking place from the mental battlefie=d 
which occurs in each of our minds. We tend to believe our perceptio=s are simply clear realizations of what is "out 
there" and=overlook how much our internal worlds can literally determine what we=see. When our internal minds 
become anxious and sense a loss of "c=ntrol," they tend to concoct ways to distort our perceptions so as=to restore that 
sense of inner control. I describe the Control Factor as a= "active and continuous process" designed to maintain 
that=sense, if not illusion, of control. We natural ly think that our thinking and feeling processes are passive; that they 
ju=t happen. Yet when faced with truly frightening prospects, the mind is gea=ed to actively distort. 
Similarly, the sense of contro= must be continuously maintained so the Control Factor operates constantly= In 
turn, the sum of this active and continuous undertaking makes these pe=ceptions all the more familiar and thus 
seemingly all the more "re=l." In one sense, the Control Factor is the mechanism of what Andy=McCarthy entitled one of 
his numerous excellent books- willful blindness. =he Control Factor is cleverer than we are aware; that is almost 
tautologic.' as, if our minds are to create ways to keep us in denial, they must out =aneuver our conscious thinking. 
Since World War II, America has had limited experience with threats comi=g to the homeland. Most of America's 
history has been about Q=9Cover there," where we have always known that if things got too out of hand (e.g. Vietnam) 
we could always ret urn home. The current generations, for a wide array of reasons, have had vi=tually no experience 
with a threat to this land. (The documentary, is interesting on this point). 
Co=sequently, the process of waking up to such a threat parallels the arc of = typical horror film. In such a film, 
there is typically a cast of charact=rs surrounding one or two main characters. We in the audience know there i= a threat 
coming — be it a monster, a virus, a psycho killer, an a=ien, the blob that ate Cincinnati etc. This threat is typically defin=d 
by its intent- the singular goal of destroying the characters. Much of t=e initial exposition shows how the characters first 
are oblivious to the d=struction the threat brings about, then explain it in familiar terms only =o finally open their eyes 
to see that something uniquely terrifying is hap=ening. The next stage usually involves a series of failed attempts to 
deal=with the threat- from trying to negotiate with it, to appease it, to coax it, to threaten it =ith ineffective weapons 
and so forth. Most of these failings are due to no= adequately appreciating the threat for what it truly is and projecting 
on=o it a host of other attributes instead. The final stage generally involve= a back-up-against-the-wall decision by 
whichever characters remain alive.=I named this the "turnaround moment" when the character be=omes willing to be 
as ruthless as the threat. That change in mental state =s necessary to ensure survival. Ultimately, the storyline is a race 
for wh=chever characters remain to wake up fully and use whatever advantages they=may still have to beat the threat. 
This is the same arc our minds go through in battling our own Control Fa=tors, our own compulsions to deny 
that which is staring us in the face. Ul=imately, the question is whether we will be able to wake up while we still=have 
advantages and give ourselves permis sion to fully fight the battle we are in. 
I said earlier that there is a structure to the Control Factor. To oversimplify, I vi=w it much as a pyramid where 
on the bottom are the many minute by minute t=oughts that are manipulated. I call this level of maneuvers the many 
=E240.0D's" as they include the psychological defenses su=h as distortion, denial, demonization, deflection, deletion, 
detachment, d=lusion, displacement, discolorization and so forth. Layered upon these are=moves such as projection, 
where we can assign to our Islamic Enemy traits =e wish to see in them or introject traits from them into ourselves th=t 
we wish not to acknowledge. These maneuvers involve a mixing of identiti=s where we actually lose clarity about who
