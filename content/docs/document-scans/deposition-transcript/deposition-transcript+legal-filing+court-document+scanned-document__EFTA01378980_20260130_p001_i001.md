• 
THE SECURITIES ARE SUBJECT TO A POTENTIAL EARLY REDEMPTION, WHICH EXPOSES YOU TO 
REINVESTMENT RISK- Market events could affect our decision to redeem the securities. For example. it is more likely 
that Credit Suisse will redeem the securities prior to the Maturity Date at a time when Credit Suisse believes it will be likely 
to pay contingent coupons over the term of the securities and could issue a comparable debt security with a lower 
contingent coupon. If we redeem the securities prior to maturity, you may not be able to invest in other securities with a 
similar level of risk that offer the same contingent coupon as the securities. 
• 
AN EARLY REDEMPTION WOULD LIMIT YOUR OPPORTUNITY TO BE PAID CONTINGENT COUPONS OVER THE 
FULL TERM OF THE SECURITIES- The securities are subject to a potential Early Redemption on any Contingent 
Coupon Payment Date scheduled to occur on or after January 22, 2019 but prior to the Maturity Date, upon notice to the 
trustee on or before the immediately preceding Observation Date. If the securities are redeemed prior to the Maturity Date, 
you will receive a cash payment equal to the principal amount of your securities and the contingent coupon payable, if any, 
on that Contingent Coupon Payment Date, and no further payments will be made in respect of the securities. In this case, 
you will lose the opportunity to continue to be paid contingent coupons from the date of Early Redemption to the scheduled 
Maturity Date. 
• 
YOU WILL BE SUBJECT TO RISKS RELATING TO THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE UNDERLYINGS- The 
securities are linked to the individual performance of each Underlying. As such, the securities will perform poorly if only 
one of the Underlyings performs poorly. For example, if one Underlying appreciates from its Initial Level to its Final Level, 
but the Final Level of the Lowest Performing Underlying is less than its Knock-In Level, you will be exposed to the 
depreciation of the Lowest Performing Underlying and you will not benefit from the performance of any other Underlying. 
Each additional Underlying to which the securities are linked increases the risk that the securities will perform poorly. By 
investing in the securities, you assume the risk that () the Final Level of at least one of the Underlyings will be less than its 
Knock-In Level and (ii) a Coupon Barrier Event occurs with respect to at least one of the Underlyings during one or more 
Observation Periods, regardless of the performance of any other Underlying. 
It is impossible to predict the relationship between the Underlyings. If the performances of the Underlyings exhibit no 
relationship to each other, it is more likely that one of the Underlyings will cause the securities to perform poorly. However, 
if the performances of the equity securities included in each Underlying are related such that the performances of the 
Underlyings are correlated, then there is less likelihood that only one Underlying will cause the securities to perform poorly. 
Furthermore, to the extent that each Underlying represents a different market segment or market sector, the risk of one 
Underlying performing poorly is greater. As a result, you are not only taking market risk on each Underlying, you are also 
taking a risk relating to the relationship among the Underlyings.

THE SECURITIES ARE LINKED TO THE RUSSELL 2000m INDEX AND ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISKS ASSOCIATED 
WITH SMALL-CAPITALIZATION COMPANIES- The Russell 20000 Index is composed of equity securities issued by 
companies with relatively small market capitalization. These equity securities often have greater stock price volatility, 
lower trading volume and less liquidity than the equity securities of large-capitalization companies, and are more 
vulnerable to adverse business and economic developments than those of large-capitalization companies. In addition, 
small-capitalization companies are typically less established and less stable financially than large-capitalization 
companies. These companies may depend on a small number of key personnel, making them more vulnerable to loss of 
personnel. Such companies tend to have smaller revenues, less diverse product lines, smaller shares of their product or 
service markets, fewer financial resources and less competitive strengths than large-capitalization companies and are 
more susceptible to adverse developments related to their products. Therefore, the Russell 2000s Index may be more 
volatile than it would be if it were composed of equity securities issued by large-capitalization companies. 
• 
HEDGING AND TRADING ACTIVITY— We or any of our affiliates may carry out hedging activities related to the 
securities, including in instruments related to the Underlyings. We or our affiliates may also trade instruments related to the 
Underlyings from time to time. Any of these hedging or trading activities on or prior to the Trade Date and during the term 
of the securities could adversely affect our payment to you at maturity. 
• 
THE ESTIMATED VALUE OF THE SECURITIES ON THE TRADE DATE MAY BE LESS THAN THE PRICE TO 
PUBLIC- The initial estimated value of your securities on the Trade Date (as determined by reference to our pricing 
models and our internal funding rate) may be significantly less than the original Price to Public. The Price to Public of the 
securities includes any discounts or commissions as well as transaction costs such as expenses incurred to create, 
document and market the securities and the cost of hedging our risks as issuer of the securities through one or more of 
our affiliates (which includes a projected profit). These costs will be effectively borne by you as an investor in the 
securities. These amounts will be retained by Credit Suisse or our affiliates in connection with our structuring and offering 
of the securities (except to the extent discounts or commissions are reallowed to other broker-dealers or any costs are 
paid to third parties). 
On the Trade Date, we value the components of the securities in accordance with our pricing models. These include a 
fixed income component valued using our internal funding rate, and individual option components valued using mid-market 
pricing. As such, the payout on the securities can be replicated using a combination of these components and the value of 
these components, as determined by us using our pricing models, will impact the terms of the securities at issuance. Our 
option valuation models are proprietary. Our pricing models take into account factors such as interest rates, volatility and
