We can tell from your tax requests that you have been spending many hundred= of thousands of dollars every year on 
personal expenses, even after having successfully eliminated the extra costs that you have mentioned as a drain on your 
resources (the Cape house, the gifts, Anthony's salary, etc). T=is is far out of alignment with what we know about your 
lifestyle. You and Valeria should live in comfort together -- no need to adhere to you<=ont size="2" face="sans-serif">r 
old, fairly austere living conditions -- but your expenditures seem to go far beyond that, and seem to keep rising. This 
makes us worry and makes us want to intervene to try to help. It also makes the trustees worry that you are not 
managing your finances with attention to your possible lifelong needs. Nothing in the long and detailed letters you've 
s=nt us can begin to explain why your personal spending has shot up the way it has. We can see only little pieces of your 
situation, because of the secretive posture you've adopted in recent years, but the pieces we do see suggest a set of 
problems very different from the ones you've descr=bed. 
We hope this helps to explain our position and our real concern. You are right that in our last emails (and in this one) we 
haven't gone point b= point through your affirmations, explaining our different understanding of the basic facts, but as 
we said at the beginning of this email, we tried to do that in the past and it didn't work. We truly hope we can find a way 
to talk openly about the situation. 
Love, Avi, Diane and Harry

Re: Fwd: Marital Trusts 
I just don't understand this. I've explained the facts in det=il, repeatedly, with no response. You've told me that you 
have a diff=rent understanding of the basic facts, but haven't told me what it is, or wh=t are the questions to which you 
want answers other than what I have told you. That is why communication cannot proceed. So, yes, frustra=ing. 
Evidently you regard this as an adversarial proceeding, requiring a mediato=. I don't understand this either. I thought 
we were a family discus=ing matters relating to us. I have no idea what a mediator would before.=C2* Mediating 
what? Another reason for my frustration. 
As for Bainco and Max, I have explained in part what they have been doing, causing me plenty of harm. In part. As I've 
told you, there is a lot more. But what I have told you is more than enough to explain that they are not reliable sources 
who can be trusted. 
If you want them to answer your questions, OK, but it would seem rather strange if I were to ask them about your 
financial affairs -- a matter into which I've of course never inquired, except by asking you question= if they came up. So I 
find all of this quite strange. If I have questions about your lives and circumstances, I would ask you, not some 
investment firm or lawyer, and I wouldn't request a mediator..=A0 I don't understand why it is different in my case, 
and this is somethin= else I'd like to know the explanation for. 
So, yes, frustrating. For these reasons.
