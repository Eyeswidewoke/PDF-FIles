About interest charges on Pay Over Time balances in Part 2 of the Cardmember Agreement is amended by deleting the 
When we charge interest sub-section and replacing it with the following: 
When we charge 
Interest 
For transactions added to a Pay Over Time balance at your request (for example, if your Pay 
Over Time feature is set to "Select"), we charge interest from the date they are added to a Pay 
Over Time balance until they are paid. 
For transactions added automatically to a Pay Over Time balance (for example, if your Pay 
Over Time feature is set to 'Direct"), we charge interest from the transaction date until they are 
paid. However, we will not charge interest on these transactions in a billing period if: 
your Pay Over Time Previous Balance for the billing period is zero; or 
you paid the Account Total New Balance on your statement, if any, for each of the 
previous two billing periods in full by the Payment Due Date shown on each of those 
statements. 
About interest charges on Pay Over Time balances in Part 2 of the Cardmember Agreement is further amended by deleting 
the How we calculate interest sub-section and replacing it with the following: 
How we calculate 
interest 
We calculate interest for a billing period by first figuring the interest on each balance. Balances 
within the Pay Over Time feature -such as "Select" and 'Direct" - may have different interest 
rates. 
We use the Average Daily Balance method (including new transactions) to figure interest 
charges for each balance. The total interest charged for a billing period is the sum of the interest 
charged on each balance. 
Interest 
The interest charged for a balance in a billing period• except for variations caused by rounding. 
equals: 
(1) Average Daily Balance (ADB) multiplied by 
(2) Daily Periodic Rate (DPR) multiplied by 
(3) number of days the DPR was in effect. 
ADB 
To get the ADB for a balance, we add up its dairy balances. Then we divide the result by the 
number of days the DPR for that balance was in effect. If the daily balance is negative, we treat it 
as zero. 
DPR 
A DPR is 1/365th of an APR, rounded to one ten•thousandth of a percentage point. Your DPRs 
are shown in How Rates and Fees Work in Pan 1. 
EXAMPLE: Calculating Interest 
Assume that you have a single interest rate of 15.99%, 
your ADB is $2.250 and Mere are 30 days in the billing 
period. 
The DPR is 15.99% divided by 365 days = 0.0438% 
The Interest is $2,250 multiplied by 0.0438% multiplied by 
30 days = $29.57 
Daily Balance 
For each day a DPR is in effect, we figure the daily balance for each balance by: 
taking the beginning balance for the day. 
adding any new charges, 
subtracting any payments or credits: and 
making any appropriate adjustments. 
We add a new charge to a daily balance as of its transaction date.
