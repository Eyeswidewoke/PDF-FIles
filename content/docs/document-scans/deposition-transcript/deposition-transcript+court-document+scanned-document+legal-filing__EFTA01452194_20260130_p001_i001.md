ARTICLE 9 
EXCULPATION, INDEMNIFICATION AND INSURANCE 
Section 9.01. 
Exculpation. (a) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, no 
Indemnified Person shall be liable to the Partnership or any Limited Partner for any loss, claim, 
damage or expense incurred by reason of any action taken or omitted to be taken by such 
Indemnified Person if such action was taken or omitted to be taken (i) in good faith and in the 
belief that such action or omission was in or was not opposed to the best interests of the 
Partnership or (ii) in good faith in accordance with the advice of legal counsel; provided that the 
foregoing shall not relieve an Indemnified Person from liability for any loss, claim or damage 
that is determined by a final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction to be primarily 
attributable to such Person's fraud, willful misfeasance or gross negligence. This Section 9.01(a) 
should not be construed as relieving, or attempting to relieve, the Investment Manager from any 
liability (including liability under United States federal securities laws which under certain 
circumstances impose liability on Persons who act in good faith) to the extent, but only to the 
extent, relieving the Investment Manager would be in violation of applicable law. 
(b) 
An Indemnified Person shall be fully protected from liability to the Partnership or 
any Limited Partner in relying in good faith upon the records of the Partnership and upon such 
information, opinions, reports or statements presented to the Partnership by any Person as to 
matters the Indemnified Person reasonably believes are within such other Person's professional 
or expert competence and who has been selected with reasonable care by or on behalf of the 
Partnership, including information, opinions, reports or statements as to the value and amount of 
assets, liabilities, profits or losses or any other facts pertinent to the existence and amount of 
assets from which distributions to Limited Partners might properly be paid. 
(c) 
Each of the Limited Partners hereby acknowledges and agrees that (i) the sole 
responsibility of the General Partner and the Investment Manager under this Agreement is to 
administer the Partnership, (ii) neither the General Partner, the Investment Manager nor any 
other Indemnified Person has undertaken to be involved in or to oversee, and neither the General 
Partner, the Investment Manager nor any other Indemnified Person will have any responsibility 
for, the business, operations, investments or investment decisions of the Master Fund and (iii) 
none of the Master Fund, the Master Fund General Partner or the Second Master Fund General 
Partner will have any involvement in or responsibility for the affairs of the Partnership and no 
such Person owes any duties (fiduciary or otherwise) to the Partnership or the Limited Partners. 
Section 9.02. 
Duties and Liabilities of Indemnified Persons. (a) To the extent that, at 
law or in equity, an Indemnified Person has duties (including fiduciary duties) and liabilities 
relating thereto to the Partnership or to any Limited Partner, to the fullest extent permitted by 
applicable law, an Indemnified Person acting under this Agreement shall not be liable to the 
Partnership or to any Limited Partner for its good faith reliance on the provisions of this 
Agreement. The provisions of this Agreement, to the extent that they restrict or eliminate the 
duties and liabilities of an Indemnified Person otherwise existing at law or in equity, are agreed 
by the Limited Partners, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, to modify or to replace 
such other duties and liabilities of such Indemnified Person.
