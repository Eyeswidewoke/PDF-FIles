sexual disorders, it is rarely disorders such as pedophilia or sadism and more 
often disorders such as addiction to pornography, hebephilia or ephebophilia, 
and other paraphilias. 
If the forensic evaluation of a defendant in a child-sexual-exploitation case 
does not include sexual disorders, especially pedophilia, among the diagnoses, 
the prosecutor should always determine exactly why they were not included. It is 
often based on the fact that the offender preferred pubescent children. One 
forensic evaluation I reviewed for a prosecutor stated that the defendant was not 
a pedophile because he had a sexual preference for "underage adults." Some-
times the lack of a diagnosis of pedophilia is corroborative and may help the 
prosecution if admitted. If the allegations indicate the situational, nonpreferential 
selection of a child victim, the lack of pedophilia is consistent with the facts of the 
case. Interestingly in the guilt or innocence phase .of most cases few of these 
diagnoses would be admissible. 
All the persistent patterns of behavior used in the investigation and prosecu-
tion may now be used by the defense prior to sentencing. The defense attorney 
now wants to talk about the unexplainable, bizarre, compulsive, reckless, bewil-
dering, out-of-character behavior of the defendant. This is the proof that he is not 
bad, but has a "disorder." The defendant is not in the "heartland of offenders" 
(i.e., the typical offender that the law intended to target) and needs a lighter sen-
tence (i.e., downward departure) and treatment Under the federal sentencing 
guidelines and United States v. McBroom, 124 F.3d 533 (3rd Cir. 1997), a certain 
amount of this nonsense can be considered by the courts in determining the 
appropriate sentence for a "nonviolent" offender. The courts would never give a 
bank robber a lighter sentence because he claimed he was driven by excessive 
greed.. If anything, he should get a longer sentence. Some argue that although 
these compulsive disorders might indicate that a defendant is more dangerous, 
he is somehow less culpable. Interestingly the DSM-W-TR states that activities 
such as "sexual behavior (e.g., paraphilias) when engaged in excessively' are not 
to be diagnostically considered compulsions "because the person usually derives 
pleasure from the activity and may wish to resist it only because of its deleterious 
consequences" (American Psychiatric Association, 2000). 
If paraphilic, compulsive, preferential sex offenders are not fully accountable 
for their behavior nor considered to be in the "heartland of offenders," there is 
not much sense in prosecuting most sexual-exploitation cases. For now that is the 
vast majority of the computer "traders" and "travelers" and other acquaintance 
molesters. See United States v. Motto, 70 F.Supp.2d 570 (ED. Pa. 1999), affirmed 
in United States v. Motto, 225 F.3d 651 (3r4 Cir. 2000). See also United States v. 
Stevens, 197 F.3d 1263 (941 Cir. 1998). 
When confronted with claims of mental disorders either at a trial or sentenc-
ing, my advice to prosecutors is to assess .the items noted below. 
■ was there a proper forensic evaluation? 
■ is the diagnosis a recognized, valid condition? 
■ is the diagnosis a "mental disease or defect" or mental disorder? 
■ does the diagnosis have criminal-justice significance? 
■ does the diagnosis address the criminal behavior charged?
