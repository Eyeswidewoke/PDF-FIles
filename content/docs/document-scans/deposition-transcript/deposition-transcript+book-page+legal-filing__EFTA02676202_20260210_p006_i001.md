CORPORATE & SECURITIES 
level gain relating to depreciation recapture or inventory). 
The capital gain should qualify as long term capital gain if the 
operating partnership interests or assets were held for more 
than one year. 
In addition, regardless of the method chosen by the seller for 
reporting the transaction, the public company generally obtains 
additional basis in the underlying assets as payments under the 
Basis TRA are made. As discussed above, both the corpora-
tion's incremental basis and its deduction of imputed interest 
generally give rise to additional payments under the agreement. 
TAX TREATMENT OF NOL TRAs 
The tax treatment of an NOI. TRA is less clear. The act of 
entering into the TRA may itself be viewed as a distribution 
from the corporation to the historic equity owners in respect 
of their stock. In this case, the fair market value of a historic 
equity owner's rights under the TRA (which is based on a 
discounted present value of future payments under theTRA) 
would be taxed as follows: 
• Dividend income up to the amount of the corporation's 
earnings and profits. 
• Non-taxable recovery of basis to the extent of the historic 
equity owner's basis in the stock. 
• Any remaining amounts as capital gain. 
Going fonvard, payments made under the TRA that exceed 
the amount already taken into account should apparently he 
treated as ordinary income, but the method for recovering 
basis in the contract right (for example, first, last or pro 
rata) is unclear. 
Alternatively, if the stock held by a historic equity holder is 
recapitalized into a new class of stock to which the rights 
under theTRA attach, the transaction may qualify as a tax-free 
reorganization under IRC Section 368. In this case, no gain is 
recognized by the equity holders at the time of the recapitaliza-
tion. When payments arc made under theTRA, they should be 
treated as taxable distributions from the corporation. 
To bolster this tax treatment, the TRA and the stock must gen-
erally be "stapled." This means that if a historic equity owner 
transfers the stock, the historic equity owner must also transfer 
its rights under theTRA, and vice versa. However, upon a sale 
of the stock to the public, as a practical matter, the stock and 
the TRA must detach from one another. 
The treatment of the detachment for US federal income tax 
purposes is not completely clear. One possibility is that the 
historic equity owner is treated as receiving a distribution 
in respect of its stock in the form of the right to receive 
the remaining payments under the TRA. Alternatively, the 
detachment of the stock and the TRA could he treated as a 
recapitalization with taxable boot to the historic equity owners 
consisting of theTRA. 
Another approach to distributing the NO!. TRA to historic 
equity owners may he to style the TRA as a class of stock of 
the corporation and distribute that stock to the historic equity 
owners. That is, the TRA would contain the same terms that 
it would other isv have hut it would be incorporated in the 
corporation's charter, rather than be in the form of a contract. 
In this case, IRC Section 305 may treat the stock distribution as 
tax-free. If so, a historic equity owner's basis in its stock in the 
corporation would be allocated between the historic stock and 
the new NOLTRA stock. Going forward, payments under the 
TRA may he viewed as distributions by the corporation to the 
historic equity owners in respect of the new NOLTRA stock, 
which may be taxed in whole or in part as dividend income 
(ordinary income to the recipient). 
TAX TREATMENT OF STOCK OPTION TRAs 
In the Endo TRA, the parties agreed to treat any payments 
under the agreement as redemptions of stock under IRC 
Section 302. This treatment provided the equity owners with 
capital gain treatment (unless the distribution was found 
to be essentially equivalent to a dividend). However, this 
tax treatment seems to be specific to the structure used in 
that agreement as the shares against which the options were 
exercisable were those held by the payee under the TRA. 
TRAs IN PRIVATE TRANSACTIONS 
Although TRAs have generally been entered into in connection 
with IPOs,TRAs or similar arrangements can also he used in 
connection with other types of transactions, including private 
company sales. It is not uncommon for the seller of a business 
to seek an increase in purchase price in exchange for valuable 
tax attributes of the sold business (for example, a basis step-up 
or NOL) or to compensate the seller for incremental tax 
liability resulting from a transaction that delivers a basis step-up 
in the business' assets to the buyer (for example, a stock sale 
with a Section 338(h)(10) election). 
11mi/ever, agreeing on the value of these tax attributes upfront 
may be difficult because the value depends on assumptions 
about the ability of the buyer to utilize the tax attributes in 
the future. Instead, aTRA can provide for additional payments 
by the buyer to the seller if, as and when the relevant tax 
 
'butes yield a tax benefit for the buyer. 
As the use of TRAs becomes more common in the II'O context, 
we can expect to see these arrangements used in an increasing 
number of other types of transactions, as a means for sellers to 
monetize the value of their business' tax attributes.
