US dollars and clearable through the US banking system. Your Account number must be included on all payments. If

accept payment made in a foreign currency, we will choose a conversion rate that is acceptable to us to convert your 
payment into US dollars, unless a particular rate is required by law. Please do not send post-dated checks. They will be 
deposited upon receipt. bur acceptance of any payment marked with a restrictive legend will not operate as an accord and

electronically, at first presentment and any re-presentments, by transmitting the amount of the check, routing, number, 
account number and check serial number to your financial institution, unless the check is not processade electronically or a 
less costly process is available. By submitting a check for payment, you authorize us to initiate an electronic debt from your 
bank a asset account. When we process your check electronically, your payment may be debited to your bank or asset 
account as soon as the same day we receive your check, and you wit not receive that cancelled check with your bank or 
asset account statement. If we cannot collect the funds electronically we may issue a draft against your bank or asset

or any other electronic payment service of ours you wit be authorizing us to ciliate an electronic debit to the financial

day. Allocation of Payments and Credits: Subject to applicable law, we will apply and allocate payments and credts 
among Features and Charges on your Account in any order and manner determined by us in our sole dscretion. Finance 
Charges: Average Daily Balance (ADB) Method for Calculation of Finance Charges (FC): We use the ADB 
Methcd to calculate FC on your Account Under this method, we figure the FC on your Acra int by applying the Daily 
Periodic Rate (DPR) to the ADB (as described below) for each Feature (inducing current transactions). Different daily 
periodic rates may be applied to separate Feature balances. To get the ADB for each feature, we (1) take the beginning 
balance for each day (including unpaid FC from previous tilling periods) (2) add any new transactions, debits, or fees, (3) 
subtract any payments or credits, and (4) make any appropriate adjustments. For each day after the first day of the billing 
period, wo also add an amount of interest equal to the previous dayas daily balance multiplied by the DPR for the 
Feature. This gives us the daily balance for the Feature for that day and the beginning balance for that Feature for the next 
day. II this balance is negative, it Is considered to be zero. Then, we add tip all the daily balances for the Feature for the 
tilling period and dvide the total blithe number of days in the billing period. This gives us the ADBfor the Feature. If you pay 
the New Balance on this statement by the next Closing Date, then you will avoid additional FC on features included in this 
New Balance. If you multiply the ADS for each Feature by the number of days in the billing period and the DPR for that 
Feature, the result will be the FC assessed on that Feature, except for variations caused by rouncfing. The tot& FC for the 
billingperiod is calculated by adding the FC assessed on all Features of the Account. This method of cakulating the ADS 
and FC results In daily compounding of FC. Transactions Made In Foreign Currencies: If ymi incur a Charge in a 
foreign currency, it writ be converted into US dollars on the date it is processed by us or our agents. Unless a particular rate is 
required by applicable law, we will choose a conversion rate that is acceptable to us for that date. Currently, the conversion 
rate we use for a Charge in a foreign currency is no greater than (a) the highest official conversion rate pubished by a 
government agency, or (b) the highest interbank conversion rate identified by us from customary banking sources, on the 
conversion date or the poor business day, in each Instance Increased by 2°k. This conversion rate may rifler from rates 
in effect on the date of your charge. Charges converted by establishments (such as airlines) will be billed at the rates such 
establishments use. Billing Rights Summary: In Case of Errors or Questions About Your Bill: If you think your d0 is 
incorrect, or if you need more information about atransaction on your bill, write us on a separate sheet of paper at the 
Customer Service address noted to the right. We must hear from you no later than 60 days after we sent you the first bil on
