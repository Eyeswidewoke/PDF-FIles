• CSIS: Rep. Adam Smith on Engaging China — Thursday, November 6, 2025. Location: Online event, 8:30 AM. 
Please join the CSIS Bipartisan Alliance for Global Health Security on Thursday, November 6, from 8:30 to 
9:30am ET for a discussion with Congressman Adam Smith (WA-09), Ranking Member of the House Armed 
Services Committee, on his experience leading a Congressional delegation to China in late September 2025. 
Rep. Smith's bipartisan delegation—the first House delegation to travel to China since 2019—pressed for 
high-level military-to-military dialogue between the world's leading superpowers. What reception did they 
receive from their Chinese counterparts, what messages did they impart, and how has the dialogue with his 
colleagues evolved since his return to Washington? What did the trip reveal and how does he expect to see 
the bilateral relationship evolve—including on key issues such as the debate over fentanyl—into the new 
year? Following welcoming remarks from John J. Hamre, CSIS CEO and Langone Chair in American 
Leadership, J. Stephen Morrison, Senior Vice President and Director of the CSIS Global Health Policy Center, 
will moderate the discussion.

• CSIS: Federal Statistics For Economic Security — Thursday, November 6, 2025. Location: Online event, 9:00 
AM. Reliable, accurate, and timely data are the foundation of sound policy, business strategy, and public 
trust. For generations, the U.S. federal statistical system has been the global benchmark, renowned for its 
credibility, integrity, and capacity for innovation. Yet that system—and the trust it has earned through 
decades of investment—is now under strain from flat budgets, aging infrastructure, and growing demands 
for faster, more granular insights.

trade deals with Cambodia, Malaysia and South Korea, framework agreements with Thailand and Vietnam 
and a peace deal between Cambodia and Thailand. He also met important U.S. allies, including the new 
Japanese prime minister Sanae Takaichi for the first time, and was warmly welcomed by South Korean 
president Lee Jae Myung for their second meeting. What are the key takeaways from Trump's first Asia trip?
