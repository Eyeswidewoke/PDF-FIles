continuing, the Trustee shall, prior to the receipt of directions, if any, from the Requisite 
Noteholders, exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture, and use the 
same degree of care and skill in its exercise, as a prudent person would exercise or use under the 
circumstances in the conduct of such person's own affairs. 
(c) 
No provision of this Indenture shall be construed to relieve the Trustee 
from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act, or its own willful 
misconduct, except that:

subsection (a) of this Section 6.1; 
(ii) 
the Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in 
good faith by a Trust Officer, unless it shall be proven that the Trustee was 
negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts;

terms hereof) of the Controlling Class (or other Class if required or permitted by 
the terms hereof) relating to the time, method and place of conducting any 
Proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or 
power conferred upon the Trustee, under this Indenture; and 
(iv) 
no provision of this Indenture shall require the Trustee to expend 
or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance 
of any of its duties hereunder, or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers

repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not 
reasonably assured to it (if the amount of such funds or risk or liability does not 
exceed the amount payable to the Trustee pursuant to Section I I.1(a)(iXA) net of 
the amounts specified in Section 6.7(a), the Trustee shall be deemed to be 
reasonably assured of such repayment) unless such risk or liability relates to its 
ordinary services, including services under Article 5, under this Indenture.

For all purposes under this Indenture, the Trustee shall not be deemed to 
have notice or knowledge of any Event of Default described in Section 5.1(c), 5.I(d), 5.1(e),
