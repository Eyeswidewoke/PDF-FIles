Fair Value Measurement 
The carrying amounts for the Company's derivative financial instruments are the estimated fair value of the financial instruments. The 
Company's derivatives are not exchange listed and therefore the fair value is estimated under an income approach using Bloomberg analytics 
models that are based on readily observable market inputs. These models reflect the contractual terms of the derivativm such as notional value and 
expiration date, as well as market-bawl observables including interest and foreign currency exchange rates, yield curves, and the credit quality of 
the counterparties. The models also incorporate the Company's creditworthiness in order to appropriately reflect non-performance risk. Inputs to 
the derivative pricing models are generally observable and do not contain a high level of subjectivity and, accordingly, the Company's derivatives 
are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. While the Company believes its estimates result in a reasonable reflection of the fair value 
of these instruments, the estimated values may not be tcptc,.ntative of actual values that could have been realized or that will be realized in the 
near future.
