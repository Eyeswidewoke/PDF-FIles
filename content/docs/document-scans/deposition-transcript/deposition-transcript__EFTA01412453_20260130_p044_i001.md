Soon afterward, the lawyers suing the Justice Department interviewed Ms. 
and asked her if any of Mr. Epstein's friends might 
have information about his exploitation of girls. When they mentioned Mr. 
Dershowitz, she replied, "Yes," according to a transcript of 
the 2011 call. 
But last December, Mr. Dershowitz was drawn into the Justice Department 
lawsuit in an entirely different way. In a motion filed that 
month, Ms. 
claimed that she and Mr. Dershowitz had sex when she was 
a minor aboard Mr. Epstein's plane and at the money 
manager's homes in New York, New Mexico and the Virgin Islands. She also 
asserted that Mr. Epstein had "sexually trafficked" her 
to other powerful friends, including Prince Andrew, the Duke of York. 
Buckingham Palace rejected the claims against the prince. 
The judge later struck Ms. 
motion from the court filing, but by 
then, the accusations were being widely reported and 
broadcast. Mr. Dershowitz's phone was ringing with calls from reporters 
seekin comment. At every opportunity, he called Ms. 
claims "outrageous falsehoods" and called the lawyers who had 
made the filing, Mr. Edwards and Mr. Cassell, "villains" who 
helped fabricate the claims against him. 
Mr. Dershowitz said he would seek to have them disbarred, adding he had 
diary records and other information to show he was not at 
locations where Ms. 
claimed they had met. "They're prepared to lie, 
cheat and steal," Mr. Dershowitz said in an interview on 
CNN in January. 
The two lawyers, who declined to be interviewed for this article, filed a 
defamation lawsuit against Mr. Dershowitz, who responded with 
his own counterclaim. 
Mr. Boies's firm soon entered the fray. In late 2014, !1.!vyer at the firm, 
Boies, Schiller and Flexner, agreed to represent Ms. 1111111 in 
legal matters not directly related to the Justice Department lawsuit. When 
Mr. Dershowitz's name surfaced in that lawsuit, another 
lawyer at the firm agreed to represent him before realizing that Ms. 
was already a client. After the lawyer withdrew, Mr. 
Dershowitz expressed anger, saying that he had already told the firm his 
legal strategy before he was made aware of the conflict. 
Mr. Boies called the claim frivolous. "This idea of going to the press and 
asserting there is a conflict when you are not willing to make 
that claim in court is irresponsible," said the lawyer, who is perhaps best 
known for representing the Democratic presidential candidate 
Al Gore against George W. Bush in his challenge to the 2000 election results. 
That incident, however, was only the start of an escalating battle in which 
each man has accused the other of twisting words and 
spewing falsehoods. In October, during a deposition in the defamation case 
against him, Mr. Dershowitz testified that he had received 
a confidential phone call from a female friend of Ms. 
, who provided 
him with troubling information. 
According to Mr. Dershowitz's testimony, the woman said that Ms. 
had 
told her that she had been pressured to level sexual 
charges at Mr. Dershowitz. She also described a plan to accuse Mr. Wexner of
