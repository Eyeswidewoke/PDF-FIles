We are replacing the Variable Rate Information below your Account Summary Table effective July 27, 2017 with the 
following: 
Variable Rate Information. The standard Annual Percentage Rates (APRs) on your Account that are used to 
determine the amount of interest to be charged for Purchases, Balance Transfers (after the Introductory Period), 
Cash Advances, and the Penalty APR are variable rates. Introductory APR is available on all Balance Transfers 
made during the first six billing cycles after account opening. The introductory APR will be applied to each 
eligible Balance Transfer for the first six billing cycles after the date of the Balance Transfer. 
O 
The APRs on your Account correspond to Daily Periodic Rates (DPR) and are calculated by multiplying the 
applicable DPR by 365. The DPRs on your Account equal 1/365th of the sum of 1) the applicable Prime Rate, 2) 
= 
8 
plus 11.99% for Purchases, plus 11.99% for Balance Transfers, plus 18.99% for Cash Advances; and plus up to 
25.99% for the Penalty APR (maximum penalty APR 29.99%). The "Prime Rate" used in determining the APRs 
= 
8 
in each billing cycle will be the highest U.S. Prime Rate published in the Money Rates column of 
The Wall Street 
Journal on the last business day of each month. An increase or decrease in the Prime Rate will cause a 
 
8 
corresponding increase or decrease to your variable rates on the first day of the billing cycle that begins in the 
same month in which the applicable Prime Rate is published. There is no limitation on the amount of any 
increase. Any such increase or decrease will cause a corresponding increase or decrease in the amount of 
interest assessed and possibly in the amount of the Minimum Payment Due. If 
The Wall Street Journaldoes not 
publish the U.S. Prime Rate, or if it changes the definition of the U.S. Prime Rate, we may substitute another 
index. 
Your new APRs 
The new APRs on your account vary with the market based on the Prime Rate. The following rates are accurate as of May 
2017. The DPR for Purchases would have been 0.0438% (which corresponds to an APR of 15.99%). The DPR for Balance 
Transfers would have been 0.0438% (which corresponds to an APR of 15.99%). The DPR for Cash Advances would have 
been 0.0630% (which corresponds to an APR of 22.99%). The Penalty APR established by the variable rate formula above 
would have been a DPR of up to 0.0822% (which corresponds to an APR of up to 29.99%). Maximum Penalty APR is 
29.99% (daily periodic rate 0.0822%). 
We are amending your Cardmember Agreement effective July 27, 2017. At that time, we are replacing the sections of 
your Cardmember Agreement titled "Late payment fee", Returned payment fee" and "Returned check fee" with the 
following: 
Late payment fee- If we do not receive a payment from you in at least the amount of your Minimum Payment Due by 
the Payment Due Date shown on your monthly statement, we may charge you a Late Payment Fee. The Late Payment Fee 
will be 827, but S38 if you did not make at least the Minimum Payment Due by the Payment Due Date in each of the 6 
prior billing periods. However, the Late Payment Fee will never exceed the amount of your required Minimum Payment Due 
to which the Late Payment Fee relates. 
Returned payment fee -If your bank does not honor a check or direct debit you deliver to us, or we must return a check 
because it is not signed or is otherwise irregular, we may charge you a Returned Payment Fee. The Returned Payment Fee 
will be 827, but S38 if you had a returned payment in any of the 6 prior billing periods. However, the Returned Payment 
Fee will never exceed the amount of your most recent required Minimum Payment Due. 
Returned check fee- If we return a Convenience Check (which includes a Balance Transfer Check or a Cash Advance 
Check) unpaid because it exceeds your available credit line at the time it is processed, your Account is closed or otherwise 
does not have charge privileges, you did not comply with our instructions regarding the Check, or your Account is past due, 
we may charge you a Returned Check Fee. The Returned Check Fee will be 827, but S38 if you had a returned 
Convenience Check in any of the 6 prior billing periods. However, the Returned Check Fee will never exceed the face 
amount of the returned Convenience Check.
