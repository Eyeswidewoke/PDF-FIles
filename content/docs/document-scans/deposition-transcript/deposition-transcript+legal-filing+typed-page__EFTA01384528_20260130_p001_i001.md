alternate rules may be applied. Hudson Bay Capital retains complete discretion in 
determining the methodology used to determine the Restricted Investments Reallocation. 
The SRI Shares are not managed as a segregated, or even separate portfolio; i.e., the 
performance of the SRI Shares will be derived, inter alia, by removing the profits and 
losses associated with the Restricted Investments from the overall profits and losses 
associated with the Offshore Fund's portfolio pursuant to the Restricted Investment 
Reallocation. As a consequence of the Restricted Investment Reallocation, other shares 
of the Offshore Fund may be adversely (or positively) affected by Hudson Bay Capital's 
compliance with the specific investment criteria applicable to the SRI Shares to the extent 
such investment criteria cause the other shares to have different exposures and weightings 
than would otherwise be applicable to the Offshore Fund's portfolio in the absence of the 
SRI Shares. To the extent any of the other Feeder Funds enter into similar arrangements 
with certain of its investors, the impact of the Restricted Investments Reallocation vis a 
vis such Fund on its investors will be similar to the impact of the Restricted Investments 
Reallocation discussed above and below as it relates to the SRI and non-SRI Investors in 
the Offshore Fund. 
PM Tranches 
Certain of the Multi-Strat Funds may also issue tranches and/or classes of shares/interests 
corresponding to the investment strategy (or a sub-strategy to the extent there are 
multiple investment strategies managed by a particular portfolio manager) pursued by a 
particular portfolio manager (the "PM Tranches"). Generally, only the portfolio manager 
associated with a PM Tranche, members of such portfolio manager's team, a family 
member of such persons and/or trusts or other entities for their benefit and certain other 
persons associated with Hudson Bay Capital will be eligible to subscribe for a PM 
Tranche. 
The Capital Structure Fund 
Hudson Bay Cap Structure Arbitrage Enhanced Fund LP (the "Capital Structure Feeder 
Fund"), a Delaware limited partnership, invests substantially all of its assets through a 
"master-feeder" fund structure in Hudson Bay Capital Structure Opportunities Master 
Fund Ltd. (the "Capital Structure Master Fund"), a Cayman Islands exempted company 
(together, as previously defined, the "Capital Structure Fund").° The portfolio of the 
Capital Structure Fund overlaps substantially with a comparable portfolio in the Multi-
Swat Funds (the "Multi-Strat Convertible Portfolio"), managed by the same portfolio 
manager, albeit on a more highly-leveraged basis than the Multi-Strat Convertible 
Portfolio. While the Capital Structure Fund is not currently accepting new investors, it 
may begin accepting new investors in at any time the future without notice and Hudson
