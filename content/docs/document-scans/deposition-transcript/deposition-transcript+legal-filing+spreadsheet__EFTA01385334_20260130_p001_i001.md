FCF-growth equation and FCF B/E oil price remain differentiators for us 
As discussed above, standard credit themes are back to center stage in the 
sector. We focus on the cash flow model - a good proxy for asset quality from 
the producing side - as a key differentiator among E&P credits. For the better 
quality names, our analysis focuses on identifying names with a superior FCF-
growth equation. For lower quality names, with their high cost structure and 
therefore significantly higher vulnerability to commodity downside, we tend to 
focus on the breakeven oil price needed to keep FCF neutral in a maintenance 
mode, along with downside asset valuations. 
The Higher Quality Oily names already have established a fairly stable FCF 
model for a $50 oil environment with an ability to deliver solid double digit 
production growth with neutral or modestly negative FCF. 
PE is the only 
exception but it is sitting on nearly $1BN of cash. 
Among the Mid Quality credits, we see a divergence. Among the emerging 
Permian names, we are positive on WPX (BUY-rated) given an impressive 
growth outlook (32% production CAGR in FY 17-19E) along with a neutral FCF 
model by end-FY 19E even at $50 oil. In contrast, QEP (SELL-rated) will grow 
at almost half the pace during the period and still would have a modestly 
negative FCF in Pe 19E. 
Among the non-Permian names, we are more 
constructive on Oasis versus its larger Bakken player, WLL - both HOLD rated. 
OAS has meaningfully lower FCF B/E oil price (-$43) vs. closer to $50 for WLL, 
and just acquired a Permian asset with equity. Apart from greater resilience to 
lower oil prices, this also implies the former generates much faster volume 
growth (we see -12% CAGR during FY 16-19E vs. -4% for WLL) with lower 
FCF burn. 
Among the Lower Quality Oily names, the three non-shale names - CRC, DNR 
and MEG - have relatively low capex requirements given their low-decline 
asset base. 
DNR and MEG have also driven solid improvements in the 
opex/capex cost structure. Therefore, despite their high opex cost structure, 
these credits have FCF B/E oil price closer to $50 oil. In fact, for MEG, that 
number should go down significantly once their ongoing expansion project is 
complete in early FY 19. At the other end, EPE, despite significant strides in 
bringing down maintenance capex and opex costs, still has an FCF B/E oil price 
well north of $60 given the capital structure and asset base.
