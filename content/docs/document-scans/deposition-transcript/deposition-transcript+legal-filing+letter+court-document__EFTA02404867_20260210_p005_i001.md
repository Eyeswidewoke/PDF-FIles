On Friday afternoon, oil prices on commodity markets closed at =103.02 a barrel, up 24 cents for the day. 
Moreover, the new sanctions — which effectively force countri=s to choose between doing business with the United 
States and buying oil f=om Iran — threaten to fray diplomatic relationships with close allies that buy some of their crude 
from Tehran, like South Kor=a. 
But in a conference call with reporters, senior administration =fficials said they were confident that they could put the 
sanctions in eff=ct without damaging the global economy. 
Iran currently exports about 2.2 million barrels of crude oil a=day, according to the economic analysis company IHS 
Global Insight, and ot=er oil producers will look to make up much of that capacity, as countries buy less and less oil from 
Iran. A num=er of countries are producing more petroleum, including the United States =tself, which should help to 
make up the gap. 
Most notably, Saudi Arabia, the world's single biggest produc=r, has promised to pump more oil to bring prices down. 
"There is no rational reason why oil prices are continuing to=remain at these high levels," the Saudi oil minister, Ali 
Naimi, wrote i= an <http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/=e1ccb48-781c-11el-b237-00144feab49a.html>

The National Interest 
The Increasingly Transparent U.S.-Israeli Conflict of Int=rest 
Paul R. Pillar <http://nationalinterest.org/profile/paul-r-pillar> 
March 29, 2012 -- We have a comparative lull at the moment in w=at has been saturation attention to Iran and its 
nuclear program. The lull=comes after the concentrated warmongering rhetoric associated with the recent visit of Israeli 
Prime Minister Benjam=n Netanyahu and the AIPAC conference in Washington, and before the opening=in mid-April of 
the only channel offering a way out of the impasse associa=ed with the Iranian nuclear issue: direct negotiations 
between Iran and the powers known as the P5+1. It =s a good time to reflect on how much the handling of this issue 
underscore= the gulf between Israeli policies and U.S. interests. The gulf exists for=two reasons. One is that the 
Netanyahu government's policies reflect only a Rightist slice of the Israeli politic=l spectrum, with which many Israelis 
disagree and which is contrary to bro=der and longer-term interests of Israel itself. The other reason is that e=en broadly 
defined Israeli interests will never be congruent with U.S. interests. This should hardly be surpris=ng. There is no reason 
to expect the interests of the world superpower to =Iign with those of any of the parties to a regional dispute involving 
old =thnically or religiously based claims to land.

addresses one of the drivers behind the Israeli policy= a historically based obsession of Mr. Netanyahu, for whom an 
Iranian nucl=ar weapon would be, as Brunner puts it, "the 21st-century equivalent of the Nazi war machine and the 
Spanish=Inquisition." The extent to which the issue is a personal compulsion of =etanyahu is reflected in estimates that 
even within his own cabinet (and e=en with the support of Defense Minister Ehud Barak), a vote in favor of war with Iran 
might be as close as eight t= six. A former Likud activist who has become a critic of Netanyahu explain=, "Bibi is a 
messianist. He believes with all his soul and every last mo=ecule of his being that he—I don't quite know how to express 
it—is King David." It is not in a superpower=s interest to get sucked into projects of someone with a King David comple=.
