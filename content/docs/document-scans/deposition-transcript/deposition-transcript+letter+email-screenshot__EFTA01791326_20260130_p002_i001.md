Macro Strategy (J. Reid, A. Ip) 
So will today's FOMC be as surprising to t=e market as the September meeting? Almost certainly not but you can't 
complet=ly rule out a small taper for the following reasons: 1) In the September meeti=g a large majority of FOMC 
participants expected the taper to start before December; 2) the fiscal situation has been kicked down the road for a 
while; 3) financial conditions have arguably eased since the last meeting with rates lower and equities higher and 4) 
many of the members won't be on the committee into next year and may want to make a statement before leavin=; and 
5) they may feel a little bruised by the market's verbal reaction last time. 
Overall we continue to think the Fed are t=apped to a large degree by the liquidity they've provided financial markets 
over recent years which could destabilise assets if they reversed course without a strong economic recovery. Indeed the 
current data uncertainties is probab=y the biggest reason for holding fire at the moment, especially so soon after the 
shutdown. Indeed our view is that the Fed may have to adjust their criteria for tapering if they want to make regular cuts 
to QE in 2014. We're not sure how employment is going to suddenly pick up at this relative=y mature stage of the cycle. 
However when all said and done, the Fed do seem to want to taper and although we think they won't until well into next 
year, we can't help but think that the Fed are currently unpredictable enough at the moment that we need to be vigilant 
tonight and indeed in December. The story of the next 6 months could be very little tapering but a swing between 
liquidity complacency and liquidity fear. Maybe we're veering towards the former at the moment. DB's Peter Hooper 
expects t=day's FOMC to be most likely a "wait and see event" though he sees th= case for a taper now is about as 
strong as it was in September when it was a very close call. 
Aside from the FOMC, today will also see t=e release of the October ADP employment report which has become an 
increasing=y good guide to payrolls over the last few months. DB's Joe Lavorgna po=nts out that since October 2012, 
when the vendor responsible for compiling the ADP survey changed from Macroeconomic Advisors to Moody's, the
