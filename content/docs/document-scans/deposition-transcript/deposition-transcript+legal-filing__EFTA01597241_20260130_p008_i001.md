billing period if you pay the Statement Balance on the current billing 
statement by the Payment Due Date in the current billing period, and (2) 
we will credit any payment applied toward Purchases as of the first day in 
your current biling period if you make a payment by the Payment Due 
Date in the current billing period that is less than the Statement Balance 
If a Statement Balance was shown on your previous billing statement and 
you did not pay the Statement Balance by the Payment Due Date on that 
statement, then we will not impose Interest Charges on any Purchases 
during the current billing period if you pay the Statement Balance shown 
on the current billing statement by the Payment Due Date in the current 
billing period For Balance Transfers, interest will accrue from the day we 
send the Balance Transfer to the payee. For Checks, interest will accrue 
from the day the payee accepts the check For Cash Advances, interest 
will accrue from the day you take the Cash Advance 
How we will calculate your balance subject to interest rate. 
We use a method called 'daily balance' (including new purchases) To 
determine the amount of interest to be charged on your Account, we 
first calculate the 'Balance Subject to Interest Rate' separately for 
Purchases, for Balance Transfers, and for Cash Advances. We apply the 
applicable Daily Periodic Rate or the DPR (the DPR for each category is 
the applicable APR shown on the front of the statement divided by 365). 
to each of the applicable daily balances for 0 Purchases, u) Balance 
Transfers, and nil Cash Advances The daily balances for Purchases, for 
Balance Transfers, and for Cash Advances are each calculated separately 
and determined as follows. We take the beginning balances for each 
transaction type on your Account each day, including any interest 
calculated on the previous day's balance, add to the respective balances 
any new transaction, subtract any payments or credits and make any 
other applicable adiustment(s). Your Cardmember Agreement provides 
for compounding of interest A credit balance is treated as a balance of 
zero If you multply the 'Balance Subject to Interest Rate' for each 
balance category as shown on your monthly billing statement by the 
number of days in the billing period and then multiply each sum by the 
applicable DPR, the results will be the interest assessed, except for minor 
variations caused by rounding.
