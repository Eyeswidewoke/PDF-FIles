Omran Shaaban, 21. a Misurata fighter who claimed to have been the first, along with a friend, to find Colonel 
Qaddafi, said he was already wounded in the head and chest and bleeding in the drainage pipe and then whisked away 
to an ambulance. Precisely how he died after that, Mr. Shaaban said, was unclear. 
By all accounts, he was then taken in an ambulance to Misurata, a coastal town to the west that fought perhaps the 
most ferocious battle against Colonel Qaddafi's government and whose fighters still celebrate their reputation for 
martial prowess. 
Holly Pickett, a freelance photojournalist working in Surf, reported in a Twitter feed that she had seen Colonel 
Qaddafi's body in an ambulance headed for Misurata, along with to fighters inside with him. It was unclear from her 
posts whether he was dead. "From the side door, I could see a bare chest with bullet wound and a bloody hand. He 
was wearing gold-colored pants," she said in one post. 
Within an hour of the news of Colonel Qaddafi's death, Libyans were celebrating. "We have been waiting for this 
moment for a long time, Mahmoud Jibril, the prime minister of the Transitional National Council, the interim 
government, said. "Muammar Qaddafi is dead." He was speaking at a news conference in Tripoli. Mahmoud 
Shammam, the council's chief spokesman, called it "the day of real liberation. We were serious about giving him a fair 
trial. It seems God has some other wish." 
At least one of Colonel Qaddafi's feared sons, Muatassim, was also killed on Thursday, Libyan officials said, and there 
were unconfirmed reports that another, Seif al-Islam, had been captured or wounded. 
The Arab Twittersphere lighted up with gleeful comments, many of them hinting at a similar fate awaiting other Arab 
dictators who have sought to crush popular uprisings — most notably President Ali Abdullah Saleh of Yemen and 
President Bashar al-Assad of Syria. One of them, also referring to former President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali of Tunisia 
and former President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, read: "Ben Ali escaped, Mubarak is in jail, Qaddafi was killed. Which 
fate do you prefer, Ali Abdullah Saleh? You can consult with Bashar." Another was more direct: "Bashar al-Assad, how 
do you feel today?" 
No videos or photos appeared to show Colonel Qaddafi alive after the ambulance spirited him away from Surt, though 
there was a debate over who exactly was responsible for his death. NATO never claimed the airstrike killed him, and 
some officials of the Transitional National Council made clear he died at their own hands. 
A reporter accompanying Ali Tarhouni, the interim government's oil and finance minister, who visited Misurata to 
view the body, saw Colonel Qaddafi splayed out on a mattress in the reception room of a private home, shirtless, with 
bullet wounds in the chest and temple and blood on his arms and hair. Three medical officials arrived, presumably to 
conduct more forensic tests. News agencies quoted a spokesman for the council in Benghazi as saying a doctor had
