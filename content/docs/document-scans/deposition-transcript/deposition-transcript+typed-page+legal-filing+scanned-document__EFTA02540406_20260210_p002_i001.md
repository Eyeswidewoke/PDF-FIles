services—or at the very least, these=processes have yet to mature into reliable, accountable mechanisms for eq=itable 
transfer of investment funds to local governments. Scarce financia= resources, political differences between national 
and local leaders, or=simply bureaucratic inefficiencies have been the chief culprits in explai=ing why promised devolved 
funds often fail to materialize at the local le=el. Left to their own devices, cities have few alternatives but to financ= 
infrastructure or long term capital investments through resources genera=ed from their annual budgets—or to postpone 
or, most likely, igno=e the much needed investments. 
Investments that directly benefit the=urban poor suffer disproportionately from this state of affairs. 
Whereas=governments may occasionally step in to fund major road or energy project= that can benefit the urban 
population at large, they rarely if ever focu= on initiatives that specifically target the poor or the informal settlem=nts 
where the poor usually reside. 
In select cases, the foundation has=an opportunity to use the lure of increased access to capital as an incen=ive 
for cities to re-direct their attention on poor urban families. Speci=ically, in cities with potential access to capital markets 
and where fisc=l conditions sound are in place, debt financing of long-term projects can=be a useful substitute for 
annual budget earmarks—as is the case=for most cities in the developed world. 
Cities working under this theme would recei=e support from the foundation to enable themselves to access the 
debt mar=et, in exchange for a guaranteed commitment that the majority of funds ra=sed through the first round of 
financing would be dedicated to addressing=issues of urban poverty — in some cases even targeted towards cro=s-
subsidizing ongoing foundation projects (i.e., sanitation). Support wou=d fall into two broad categories. The first would 
be support to the city=to solidify finances, obtain a credit rating, and issue a bond on the com=ercial market(1). The 
second would be to support participatory exercises=with both city officials and organizations of the urban poor to plan 
the=use of the anticipated resources, and funding for small scale, jointly-im=lemented pilots to test and refine the 
models/concepts selected so that=when the financing comes through, they are ready for investment. While th=s theme 
involves significant external risks — including national-=evel regulatory approval, the evolution of global debt markets, 
etc. etc.=— it also offers perhaps the greatest opportunity for leverage,=sustainability and replicability across developing 
world cities with a sm=ll investment on our part and the majority of the risk borne through capi=al markets. 
Illustrative Grant under Preparation: Munici=al Finance in Dakar 
The proposed intervention would help=Dakar become the first West=African city to tap into capital markets to 
finance long-term investments=benefitting the urban poor. 
The Dakar Municipal Finance Program=would be implemented over a period of five years. It would cost five 
mill=on US Dollars and unlock an expected $35 million by 2015. This would be=achieved by enabling Dakar to issue its 
first municipal bonds and raise=funds in city-backed debt financing, serving as a model for other West Af=ican cities. The 
condition for providing the support would be that a majo=ity of the proceeds generated from the first bond issue would 
be jointly=allocated with the poor to projects that benefit them directly. </=ONT> 
Dakar, with almost four million inhabitants=in its metropolitan area, is one of the largest and most economically 
vib=ant cities in Sub-Saharan African. As the capital of Senegal, one of the=most democratically stable and financially 
dynamic countries of the conti=ent and as the de-facto economic center of the French-speaking CFA econom=c zone(?) 
<http:/=mail.aol.com/33790-111/aol-1/en-us/suite.aspx#_ftn2> ,=the city has emerged as an ideal candidate for 
pioneering municipal acces= to capital finance in the West African region. Indeed, as a member of th= West African CFA 
community, Dakar's potentially trail-blazing ro=e in viable municipal financing offers the promise of full-scale replicat=on 
in a dozen cities across the region and beyond its frontier. The munic=pality has a track-record in pro-poor policy 
implementation (notably in=the areas of education and health(3)) as well as ambitious urban revival plans for=the city, 
which would benefit the poor, estimated to constitute 80% of Da=ar's population. The mayor has also devoted 
considerable efforts=to putting his financial house in order (with support from France) and to=good governance.[4] 
According to an AFD (=gence Francaise de Developpement) representative,[5] <http://mail.aol.com/33=90-111/aol-
1/en-us/suite.aspxtftn5> "the abi=ity of Dakar's mayor to restructure (the city) financially is spe=tacular." 
Furthermore, the city has demonstrated political commit=ent to the poor. For example, formal consultative 
processes[6]<=SUP> <http://mail.aol.com/33790-1=1/aol-1/en-us/suite.aspx#_ftn6> have been set=up and appear to 
be functioning, allowing stakeholders to voice their opi=ions. The project would build upon this pre-existing pro-poor 
orientation=by creating a requirement, a structure, and enhanced capacity for the urb=n poor to play and active role in 
the planning, implementation, and monit=ring of the investments funded by the bond. 
The program's principal munic=pal government partner would be the Municipality of Dakar, which is heade= by 
a pro-poor mayor who improved the financial position of the city. The=civil society partner will consist of a network of a
