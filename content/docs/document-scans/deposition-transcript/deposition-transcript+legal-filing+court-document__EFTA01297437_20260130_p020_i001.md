Jeffrey Epstein, Billionaire Pedophile, Goes Free 
Page 4 of 7 
Watch Jeffrey Epstein Storm Out of a Deposition When Asked About His Penis 
During Epstein's term of "house arrest," he made several trips each month to his New York home and his private 
Caribbean island. In the earlier stage of his sentence for soliciting prostitution with a minor-13 months in the Palm 
Beach Stockade—he was allowed out to his office each day. Meanwhile, Epstein has settled more than a dozen lawsuits 
brought by the underage girls who were recruited to perform "massages' at his Palm Beach mansion. Seven victims 
reached a last-minute deal last week. days before a scheduled trial; each received well over Si million—an amount that 
will hardly dent Epstein's S2 billion net worth.

Epstein's sexual compulsion have been officially silenced, and the case against him is closed unless new ones come 
forward. According to banking sources, he has been moving assets out of the U.S. and may well follow Polanski into a 
luxurious exile. 
But the question remains: Did Epstein's wealth and social connections—former President Bill Clinton; Prince Andrew; 
former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak; New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson; and former Treasury Secretary Larry 
Summers were just a few of the prominent passengers on his private jets—allow him to receive only a slap on the wrist 
for crimes that carry a mandatory 20-year sentence? Was lie able, with his limitless assets and heavy-hitting 
lawyers—Alan Dershowitz, Gerald Lefcourt, Roy Black, Kenneth Starr, Guy Lewis, and Martin Weinberger among 
them—to escape equal justice?

Michael Reiter, the former Palm Beach police chief, certainly thinks so. He gave The Daily Beast exclusive access to the 
transcript of his nine-hour deposition for the victims' civil suits, in which he explained how the case against Epstein 
was minimized by the State Attorney's Office, then bargained down by the U.S. Department ofJustice, all in an 
atmosphere of hardball legal tactics and social pressures so intense that Reiter became estranged from several 
colleagues. At the time, Reiter, who retired in 2009 and now runs his own security firm, objected both to Epstein's plea 
agreement and to the flexible terms of his incarceration in the county jail rather than state prison. Asked during the 
deposition whether he thought Epstein received special treatment, he answered "yes." 
In March 2005, Reiter's department, acting on a complaint from the Florida parents of a 14-year-old girl, launched an 
investigation that would eventually uncover a pattern of predatory behavior stretching back years and spanning several 
continents, knowingly enabled by Epstein's associates and employees. Two or three times a day, whenever Epstein was 
in Palm Beach, a teenage girl would be brought to the mansion on EJ Brillo Way. ("The younger the better," he 
instructed 
a local teenager who was paid to bring other girls to the house, and who declarecl, on a police
