le to us to convert your 
payment into US dollars, unless a particular rate is reau'red by law. Please do not send post-dated chedts. They will be

account number and check serial number to your financial institution, unless the check is not processabe electronically or a 
less costly process is available. By submitting a check for payment, you authorize us to initiate an electronic debit from your 
bank or asset account. When we process your check electronically, your payment may be debited to your bank or asset 
account as soon as the same day we receive your check, and you will not receive that cancelled check with your bank or

or any other electronic payment service of ours, you will be authorizing us to initiate an electronic debit to the financial

day. Allocation of Payments and Credits: Subject to applicable law, we will apply and allocate payments and credits 
among Features and Charges on your Account in any order and manner determined by us in our sole discretion. Finance 
Charges: Average Daily Balance (ADB) Method for Calculation of Finance Charges (FC): We use the ADB 
Method to calculate FC on your Account. Under this method, we figure the FC on your Account by applying the Dai:y 
Periodic Rate (OPR) to the ADS (as described below) for each Feature (Including current transactions). Different daily 
periodic rates may be applied to separate Feature balances. To get the ADB for each feature, we (1) take the beginning 
baance for each day (alluding unpaid FC from previous billing periods) (2) add any new transactions, debts, or fees, (3) 
subtract any payments or cre.:a., and (4) make any appropriate adjustments. For each day after the first day of the billing 
period, we also add an amount of interest equal to the previous days daily balance multiplied by the DPR for the 
Feature. This gives us the daily balance for the Feature for that day and the beginning balance for that Feature for the next 
day. If this balance is negative, it is considered to be zero. Then, we add up all the daily balances for the Feature for the 
Nina period and divide the total by the number of days in the bi'l]ng period. Ths gives us the ADS for the Feature. If you pay 
the New Balance on this statement by the next Closing Date, then you will avoid additional FC on features included in this 
New Balance. If you multiply the ADB for each Feature by the number of days in the biting per:cd and the DPR for that 
Feature, the result will be the FC assessed on that Feature, except for variations caused by rounding. The total FC for the 
biting period is calculated by adding the FC assessed on all Features of the Account. This method of calculating the ADS 
and FC results in daily compounding of FC. Transactions Made In Foreign Currencies: If you incur a Charge in a 
foreign currency, it will be converted into US dollars on the date it is processed by us or our agents. Unless a particular rate is 
required by applicable law, we will choose a conversion rate that is =eatable to us for that date. Currently, the conversion 
rate we use for a Charge in a foreign currency is no greater than (a) the highest official conversion rate published by a 
government agency, or (b) the highest interbank conversion rate identified by us from customary banking sources, on the 
converson date or the prior foulness day, in each instance Increased by 2%. This conversion rate may differ from rates 
in effect on the date of your charge. Charges converted by establishments (such as airlines) will be tilled at the rates such 
establishments use. Billing Rights Summa : In Case of Errors or Questions About Your Bill: If you think your bill is 
incorrect, or it you neea more intormation about atransaction on your bill, vale us on a separate sheet of paper at the 
Customer Service address noted to the right. We must hear from you no later than 60 days alter we sent you the first bill on
