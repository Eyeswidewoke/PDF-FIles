suggestion that CFI, as =n organization, or that I personally took a lax attitude regarding harassm=nt is completely 
without factual foundation. 
In your email you mentioned that one st=ffer resigned after I invited Krauss on 
the Galapagos cruise. I'm =ot aware of any staffer resigning because of that. If you give me a name l=could comment on 
the reasons for the staffer leaving. Ms. Beauchamp remain=d an employee of CFI (and went on the Galapagos cruise 
with Krauss). 
You mentioned a=so the comments that were made to me in March 2012 by 
Melody Hensley. Let =e give you the background for that. CFI was holding an event prior to the =012 Reason Rally in DC. 
Richard Dawkins, Jessica Alquist, Jamie Raskin, an= Lawrence Krauss were scheduled to speak at the event. Melody 
Hensley was =eavily involved in the planning for the event and in fact was tapped to ma=e introductions for the 
speakers, including Krauss. (At the time she was i= charge of the DC local branch.) During the planning for the event she 
gav= no indication whatsoever that she had any hesitation about introducing or=dealing with Krauss. (I will forward you 
some email correspondence confirm=ng this.) 
As I recall, Krauss's sched=le resulted in his planned arrival being a little later 
than the others. A= it turned out, he was even further delayed. At some point when it became =tear that Krauss was 
going to be late, Hensley turned to me and said, 4,=B04,I know why Krauss isn't coming; he's embarrassed to s=e me." I 
asked Hensley what she meant by this. She said Krauss had=made a pass at her several years earlier and she had 
rebuffed him. I asked=for some details. She said she was in a hotel room with him (I can*=99t recall whether she said it 
was Krauss's hotel room, but I thin= it was), and that Krauss tried to kiss her. She pushed him away and said =he wasn't 
interested. I asked if Krauss persisted; she said he did=not. Thinking out loud, I believe I said something to the effect of 
40=98well, if you want to make a complaint you probably can, although l0=99m not sure our policy at that time would 
cover that.' Ms. Hensle= said she was not interested in making a formal complaint.</=> 
Ms. Hensley's sta=ement that I "responded to her with silence" is 
absolutely=false and I categorically and unqualifiedly deny it. We talked about her c=ncern, as indicated. Ms. Hensley's 
recall must be failing her. 
Given the pas=age of time (six years), the fact that Hensley did not want to 
pursue the =atter, the fact that Krauss desisted when Hensley indicated she wasn4k=99t interested, the fact that 
Hensley didn't even seem very bother=d by the incident (as indicated, she had expressed no hesitation in 
seeing=Krauss), and the fact that we had no policy covering conduct by nonemploye=s back in 2006 (in fact, CFI's zero-
tolerance policy covering empl=yees themselves was not implemented until 2007, I believe -- I was just hi=ed as the 
attorney in July 2006), I decided not to do any further about th=s particular incident. However, the incident, along with 
observations I he=rd at the Women in Secularism conference which we held later in the spring=of 2012 (observations 
which did n=t mention Krauss, but rather som= speakers at non-CFI events), was a factor in my thinking about the need 
f=r a policy covering conduct by invited speakers and guests at CFI conferen=es. 
Ms. H=nsley made no other complaint to me about Krauss, nor did she ever 
express=to me her belief that we should not invite Krauss to events.=/p> 
In closing, let me scat= that any accusations stating that I neglected to take 
harassment complain=s seriously are false. Furthermore, I would regard them as a malicious att=ck on my character and 
my professional reputation.
