position on Monday." Kelly "is accused of having a 'long-running bribery scheme and corrupt 
partnership' with construction company executive and permit expediter Walter Wong. Wong 
gave Kelly money and paid for meals and international trips including a family vacation to China 
as he sought a streetlight contract, prosecutors said." 
The San Francisco Chronicle (11/30, Cassidy, 2.67M) reports, "The U.S. attorney's office 
announced the criminal complaint against Kelly Monday, shortly after the FBI served a search 
warrant and removed boxes from his San Francisco home. Kelly resigned as general manager 
Monday, according to a statement issued by Mayor London Breed." The Chronicle adds, "The 
charge is the latest development in a still-expanding corruption scandal at City Hall that began 
with the arrest of former Public Works Director Mohammed Nuru in January. The U.S. attorney's 
office charged Nuru with fraud and with lying to the FBI. Since his arrest, a slew of others, 
including city contractors, have also faced criminal charges for allegedly participating in 
schemes to get favorable treatment on contracts. Multiple city department heads have been 
forced to resign." 
The San Francisco Examiner (11/30, Barba, 438K) reports, "The March 2016 trip to China 
is just one of the bribes Kelly is alleged to have accepted from permit expediter Walter Wong, 
who agreed to cooperate with the FBI investigation into City Hall corruption when the U.S. 
Attorney's Office charged him in June. Kelly is also alleged to have underpaid for repair work 
done by Wong's construction company on his Inner Sunset home, according to the newly filed 
complaint against him." The Examiner adds, "In a statement, Kelly disputed the allegations but 
said he would immediately vacate his position instead of retiring in the next 18 months as 
previously planned 'in order to defend myself, my legacy and my family."I am not guilty of 
these allegations,' Kelly said." 
The SFist (11/30, Kukura) reports, "The raid of Kelly's home is significant, because he is 
married to City Administrator Naomi Kelly, and we already knew that the FBI was probing for 
sweetheart deals that benefited their personal finances. Naomi Kelly is not named in the latest 
FBI criminal complaint, though there are references to 'his wife,' and she is quite likely in some 
trouble here. Among the illegal gifts Harlan Kelly is accused of accepting is a lavish trip for his 
family, and the FBI has WeChat messages from Harlan Kelly saying 'Thank you for the best 
family vacation ever! A little something for everyone!" 
KPIX-TV San Francisco (11/30, 110K) reports, "The complaint against Kelly alleges that 
Wong provided Kelly with bribes in exchange for official acts by Kelly that benefited or 
attempted to benefit Wong's business ventures. 'The allegations against Harlan Kelly and the 
nine other individuals charged in this case are extremely troubling. The citizens of San 
Francisco deserve nothing less than transparency, honesty, and integrity from their city officials. 
However, through the course of this ongoing investigation, the FBI has uncovered a pattern of 
criminal activity committed by those in positions of trust,' said FBI Special Agent in Charge 
Craig D. Fair in a prepared statement."

the Mission Local (11/30, Eskenazi), and Courthouse News (11/30, Iovino, 2K) also report. 
Cincinnati Attorney Tapped To Fill Position Of Suspended City Councilman. 
The Cincinnati Enquirer (11/30, Coolidge, 223K) reports, "Cincinnati attorney Steve Goodin has 
been tapped to temporarily replace Cincinnati Councilman Jeff Pastor, who was suspended from 
City Council last week after being arrested on bribery charges. Hamilton County Probate Court 
Judge Ralph 'Ted' Winkler made the decision. The selection process was unusual, but then there 
is nothing usual in a year where three sitting Cincinnati City Council members are accused in 
pay-to-play schemes. The Cincinnati Charter does not have provisions for removal if a member 
is accused or convicted in corruption cases, so the process has played out in the courts." Pastor 
"accepted a suspension, initiated by Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost."
