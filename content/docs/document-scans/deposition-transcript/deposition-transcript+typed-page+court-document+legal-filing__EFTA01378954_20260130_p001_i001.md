10. Notices. Notices and other communications may also be provided to Client verbally. Such notices and other 
communications left for Client on Client's answering machine, voice malt, electronic mail or otherwise, are considered 
to have been delivered to Client whether actually received or not. Transactions entered into Client's Account shall be 
confirmed by DBSI in writing where required by law or regulation. DBSI will not send separate confirmations for the 
following transactions: (a) dividends or distributions credited or reinvested, or transactions effected pursuant to a 
Dividend Reinvestment Plan, (b) shares of money market funds that are purchased or redeemed, or are part of the Cash 
Sweep Options, or (c) transactions effected pursuant to a periodic plan or an investment company plan. Client's periodic 
account statements will reflect these transactions. Notices concerning all matters related to Account(s) usually will go 
through DELSI although Pershing may send notice(s) directly to Client with a duplicate to DBSI should market conditions, 
time constraints or other circumstances so require. 
11. Conflicts of Interest. Services and recommendations that DBSI provides to Client may differ from the services and 
recommendations provided to other Clients or by other individuals or groups at Des] andlor affiliates of Deutsche Bank AG. 
whether acting as principal or agent. DBSI provides investment advice, portfolio management and execution services for many 
Clients and, in addition, acts as principal in various markets. Given these different roles, individuals and groups at DBSI and 
affiliates of Deutsche Bank AG are seldom of one view as to an investment strategy and may pursue differing or conflicting 
strategies. Employees of DBSI shall have no obligation to recommend to Client or inform Client of, strategies being pursued 
by DBSI or other Clients. Further. (a) DBSI and its affiliates may provide services fora fee to or solicit business from wmpanies 
whose securities are recommended by DaSI, (b) DBSI and its affiliates may be paid fees by investment companies registered 
under the Investment Company Act of 1940 or other investment vehicles, including, without limitation. fees for acting as 
investment advisor, administrator, custodian and transfer agent which fees may increase when DBSI clients invests such 
Investment vehicles, giving DBSI a financial incentive to recommend such investment vehicles to Client, and (c) DBSI and its 
affiliates act as brokers, principals and/or market makers in certain markets and may do so in transactions with Client. DBSI 
may recommend securities or strategies that are issued, underwritten, implemented or advised by ()BSI or one or more of its 
affiliates. DBSI may receive compensation, in addition to the compensation Client pays DBSI, in the form of Rule 17o-1 fee& 
distribution fees, finder's fees, fees based upon fund management fees and cash or non-cash payments that are pad by mutual 
funds (out of fund assets in the case of Rule 12b-1 fees) or by the managers and other service providers to the funds (not out 
of fund assets), all or some of which fees or payments are ultimately borne by Investors in the funds. DBSI also participates 
in a program offered by Pershing, under which DBSI shares in revenue received by Pershing from mutual funds offered on 
the Pershing platform. A mutual fund may offer several "classes" of shares, with each "class" charging different fees and 
costs. Please review the mutual fund's prospectus for a detailed description of the fund's fees and expenses. In addition, the 
compensation payments made to OBSI as described above may vary depending on the mutual fund share "class" held in a 
Client's account which presents a conflict of interest because CMS! has a financial incentive to recommend a share class that 
pays relatively higher compensation to OBS! instead of a share class that pays relatively lower compensation to 0691. All of 
these compensation payments may also vary based on sales volume or a mutual fund's assets under management In addition, 
DBSI may receive trail compensation in connection with sales of auction rate securities. Finally, when considering and making 
recommendations of privately offered pooled investment vehicles (such as hedge funds, private equity funds or rea: estate 
funds) to you, we will consider and recommend only those vehicles that agree to pay to us fees (or "retiocessions") that are 
based on the amount you and other clients invest in those vehicles. In an cases we will disclose to you prior to your investment in 
a privately offered pooled investment vehicle the terms of our compensation arrangements with that vehicle.
