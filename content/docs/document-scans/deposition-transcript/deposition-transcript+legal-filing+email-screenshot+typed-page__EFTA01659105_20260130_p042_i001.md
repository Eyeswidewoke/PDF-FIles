Israeli PM Reportedly Met With Saudi Crown Prince. 
Reuters (11/23, Williams) reports Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu "travelled to Saudi 
Arabia and met its crown prince," according to an Israeli official on Monday. Reuters add that 
"Israeli media said Netanyahu had secretly flown on Sunday to Neom, on the Red Sea, for talks 
with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo." But, 
these reports "were denied by Saudi Arabia's foreign minister, Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud." 
Netanyahu, himself, "was circumspect about any clandestine travel." Asked about it, Netanyahu 
said, "throughout my years I have never commented on such things and I don't intend to start 
doing so now." In addition, "spokesmen for Pompeo declined comment." Israeli Defence Minister 
Benny Gantz reportedly condemned "the irresponsible leak of the secret flight to Saudi Arabia." 
The New York Times (11/23, Hubbard, Halbfinger, Bergman, 18.61M) reports "the Saudi 
foreign minister flatly and publicly denied that such a meeting had taken place." However, the 
AP (11/23, Zion) describes the reported meeting as "the latest move by the Trump 
Administration to promote normalized ties between Israel and the broader Arab world and 
reflected the shared concern of all three nations about Iran." 
The Washington Post (11/23, Hendrix, Rubin, Mekhennet, 14.2M) calls it "a watershed 
visit in the historically hostile relations between the two countries." It also quotes an unnamed 
"intelligence official," who said, "It was kept in a very small circle in Israel. Neither the foreign 
minister nor the defense minister knew about this." The Wall Street Journal (11/23, Schwartz, 
Lieber, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) provides similar coverage. 
In his column for the Washington Post (11/23, 14.2M), Henry Olsen says the meeting 
between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin 
Salman - "a de facto anti-Iranian alliance between Israel and the Gulf Arab kingdoms - will 
likely dramatically alter what the incoming Biden administration's Middle East policy will look 
like." For Israel, "an alliance with the Arab gulf powers provides military might that could be 
deployed on its behalf in the event of a mutual threat." For Arabs, he says, "it ensures that a 
nuclear-armed power stands behind them should Iran ever obtain a weapon, and establishes a 
connection with Israel's vaunted intelligence agencies." A "de facto alliance would also reduce 
dependence on the United States and its domestic political whims, replacing US mediation with 
direct ties between the nations' security apparatuses." 
Google Planning Fiber-Optic Network Connecting Saudi Arabia, Israel. The Wall 
Street Journal (11/23, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) reports Google is planning to lay down 
a fiber-optic network that would connect Israel and Saudi Arabia and open a new door for 
worldwide Internet traffic. Expanding connectivity between India and Europe could also help 
Google open data centers across the globe, helping it compete with Amazon and Microsoft for 
on-demand cloud computing. 
Yemeni Rebels Fire Missile On Saudi Oil Facility Monday. 
The Washington Post (11/23, Raghavan, 14.2M) reports, "Yemeni rebels on Monday said they 
fired a missile that hit a Saudi oil storage facility in the Red Sea port of Jiddah, claiming that it 
was in retaliation for the Saudi-led coalition's involvement in Yemen's war." The "apparent 
assault came hours after the kingdom finished hosting its virtual G-20 leaders' summit." There 
was "no immediate response from Saudi officials, even as videos and images posted on social 
media indicated a fire burning at a Saudi Aramco complex in Jiddah." 
China Says It Has Eliminated Extreme Poverty. 
The Wall Street Journal (11/23, Areddy, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) reports the Chinese 
Community Party on Monday claimed that it has eliminated extreme poverty across the country. 
Nine counties in China have recently been certified as free of poverty, they said - a cornerstone 
of the CCP's goal to reduce financial and social inequities.
