2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 86119, * 
v. Mutual of Omaha Ins. Co., 49 Ala. App. 214.270 So. 2d 87.90 (Ala. Civ. App. 1972) (similar). The Brown-Marx 
panel distinguished between claims for breach of an obligation expressly set forth in the contract (which are not 
actionable in tort under Alabama law) and claims for breach of a duty implied by or arising out of the contract (which 
may be actionable in tort). See Brown-Marx. 703 F.2d at 1371. 
Hardy v. Jim Walter Homes, Inc., Civil Action No. 06-0687-WS-B, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
26842, 2008 WL 906455, at *14 (S.D. Ala. April 1, 2008) (footnote omitted). See Eastern 
Shore Marine, Inc. v. M/V Mistress, 717 F. Supp. 790, 792 (S.D. Ala. 1989) ("If a cause of 
action arises p21] from a breach of a promise, the action is ex contractu; if it arises from a 
breach of a duty which grows out of the relationship of the parties because of the contract, 
the action is in the form ex delicto. . . . Therefore, a contract for the performance of an act 
which contains no contractual provision that the act will be done in a proper manner or free 
from negligence, by law, creates a duty but does not imply a contract, that the act will be 
done in a proper manner when its performance is undertaken, and a breach of this legally 
created duty will give rise to an action ex delicto."(citing C & C Products, Inc. v. Premier 
Indus. Corp., 290 Ala. 179, 275 So. 2d 124, 129-30 (Ala. 1972)); Brooks v. Hill, 717 So. 2d 
759, 763 (Ala. 1998) ("[W]here the parties have entered into a contract, if the cause of 
action arises from a breach of duty arising out of the contract, rather than from a breath of 
a promise of the contract itself, the claim is ex delicto."(citations omitted)); Sanford v. W. 
Life Ins. Co., 368 So. 2d 260, 263 (Ala. 1979) (concluding that the plaintiff's fraud claim 
sounded in tort even though it arose from a contract because "the contract merely 
establishes the relationship from which such a legally imposed duty could spring." 
(citations omitted)); Great N. Land & Cattle Inc. v. Firestone Tire & Rubber Co., 337 So. 2d 
1323, 1327-28 (Ala. Civ. App. 1976) ("When the contract does not in terms require 
reasonable care in doing the act stipulated to be done, the law imposes a duty--But [• 22] 
does not imply a contract—to exercise due care in doing the act; and, therefore, when 
negligence exists in doing that act an action in tort only is available because there is No 
express or implied contract which is breached." (citations and internal quotation marks 
omitted)); see also Mechler v. John Hancock Life Ins. Co., Civil Action No. 07-0724-CB-M, 
2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 75955, 2008 WL 4493230, at •4 (S.D. Ala. Sept. 30, 2008) 
(concluding that, under Alabama law, the plaintiff could pursue tort actions for fraud and 
fraudulent suppression against insurer, where the defendant argued that said tort claims 
were foreclosed because they arose from a breach of the terms of the insurance policy). 
In Hardy this Court, applying Alabama law, considered whether plaintiffs could bring tort 
claims arising from a Purchase and Sale Agreement for the construction of a house. 
Hardy. 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 26842, 2008 WL 906455, at *1-2. The plaintiffs, the 
purchasers of the home, asserted negligence actions against the builder for its failure to 
apply for construction permits, failure to communicate with the plaintiffs regarding the 
construction status, and failure to begin construction in a timely manner. 2008 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 26842, [WL] at *13. The builder moved for summary judgment on the negligence 
claims arguing that the plaintiffs improperly transformed breach of contract [•23] claims 
into tort claims. 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 26842, [WL] at *14. This Court rejected the builder's 
argument, noting that the builder had not identified any provision in the contract requiring 
the builder to perform the acts at issue. Id. This Court concluded that, "[bjecause [the 
plaintiffs'] negligence claims concern duties arising from the Purchase and Sale 
Agreement rather than breach of express contractual obligations in that agreement, . . . 
[those] claims are cognizable in tort under Alabama law." Id.
