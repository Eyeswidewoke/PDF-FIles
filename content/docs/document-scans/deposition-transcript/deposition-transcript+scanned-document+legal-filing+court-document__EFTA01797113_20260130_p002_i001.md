The government has maintained its o=ficial silence about Mr. Xi's absence. After an initial burst of 
ch=tter, blog posts alluding to Mr. Xi have been effectively smothered on Chin='s social media platforms, and China's 
beleaguered Foreign M=nistry spokesman says on a daily basis that he has no information, despite a=barrage of 
questions from the foreign news media. 
By Thursday, a number of ranking party members w=th years of experience following Chinese politics 
were generally in a=reement that Mr. Xi, 59, had suffered either a mild heart attack or a strok=, forcing him to cancel his 
appointments. 
"The most reliable information we can find is th=t it's his heart," said a senior Chinese newspaper editor 
w=o spoke only on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of th= issue among the party hierarchy. Li 
Weidong, a former editor of a governme=t-sponsored reformist journal, agreed. 
On Thursday, Mr. Xi's name appeared in the Chinese p=ess for the first time in days,as he offered 
c=ndolences <http://www.gx.chinanews.com/2012/=910_0912/62812.html> over the recent death of a veteran party 
member. 64 that terse report only mentioned him among several leaders and did not im=ly anything more than a 
formal expression of sorrow.

font-size: llpt; font-family: Calibri, sans-se=if; line-height: 17.6pt; ">"l think it's hard to say thi= proves anything," said 
lin Zhong, the editor of Open, a magazine i= Hong Kong. "He didn't appear, but just sent condolen=es." 
=fanned years in advance, the 18th Party Congress is sla=ed to be the most sweeping government 
reorganization <http://www=nytimes.com/2012/08/07/world/asia/reports-signal-gathering-of-chinese-leade=s-ahead-
of-transition.html> in a d=cade, with scores of leaders scheduled to retire. It was still expected to t=ke place next month 
or soon after in Beijing, where Mr. Xi was to take over=as leader from Hu Jintao. The Communist Party has numerous 
factions, but th= overall framework of the transfer was thought to have been mostly ironed o=t over the past year. 
=ut recent developments, including Mr. Xi's mysterious cancellation o= several public appearances, 
suggest that may not be the case.</=pan> 
The most obvious sign of discord is=that the dates for the congress have not been set. Most political 
experts h=re expected it to be held in mid-October, but without an official announcem=nt, some are predicting it will be 
delayed. 
"We hear that the congress will be held in late=October or early November," a security official from 
southern China=said. "Currently we're planning for that." 
One reason for the delay, the ex=erts say, is what now appears to have been acontentious meeting in 
e=rly August <http://www.nytimes.c=m/2012/07/22/world/asia/chinas-communist-elders-take-backroom-intrigue-
beac=side.html> at the seaside resort of Beidaihe, China. Accord=ng to the official script, this was to have been the final 
big meeting befo=e the congress of leaders from the party's various factions: the mi=itary, big state enterprises, 
descendants of revolutionary families, leader= of critical Communist Party organizations and others. The details of the 
c=ngress were to be finalized at Beidaihe and the dates announced later in Au=ust.
