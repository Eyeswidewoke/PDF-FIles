White House Director of Strategic Communications Alyssa Farah said on Fox News' 
America's Newsroom, "The President has condemned white supremacists countless times. Last 
week in Atlanta, Georgia, laying out his vision for African Americans, he said he would 
prosecute crimes committed by the KKK as domestic terrorism. That's a policy position of 
President Trump." The Washington Examiner (9/30, Brest, 448K), The Hill (9/30, Samuels, 
2.98M), and Axios (9/30, 521K) also cover Trump's comments. 
USA Today (9/30, Fritze, Subramanian, 10.31M) reports Trump "drew fire from both 
Democrats and some Republicans for not explicitly denouncing white supremacy when he had a 
chance. Trump aides pointed to the president's initial response" to moderator Chris Wallace, 
"when he said `sure' and added that he was `willing to do anything' because he wants `to see 
peace.' ... But even as Trump aides argued the story was a media creation, several Republicans 
who are usually close to the White House criticized the response." Senate Majority Leader 
McConnell "said it was `unacceptable not to condemn white supremacists,'" and on Fox News' 
Fox & Friends, host Brian Kilmeade "said Trump `blew the biggest layup in the history of 
debates by...not condemning white supremacists." 
The New York Times (9/30, Shear, Broadwater, Cochrane, 18.61M) reports Sen. Tim Scott 
(R-SC), "the chamber's only Black Republican, said that `white supremacy should be denounced 
at every turn. I think he misspoke, I think he should correct it. If he doesn't correct it I guess 
he didn't misspeak.' McConnell "told reporters Wednesday that he agreed with Mr. Scott, 
sharply rebuking Mr. Trump's refusal to categorically denounce white supremacy during the 
presidential debate." McClatchy (9/30, 19K) and Axios (9/30, Perano, 521K) also cover Scott's 
comments. 
Chuck Todd said on NBC Nightly NewsVI (9/30, story 6, 0:45, Holt, 5.69M), "The best way 
to look at a post-debate to see which side is having a better time and which side is having the 
worst time is which one has to explain the most, and today, it has been Donald Trump that has 
to do explaining on the why he did not denounce white supremacy or the Proud Boys, why even 
today he still sort of danced around it." 
Several newspapers have features on the Proud Boys, which USA Today (9/30, Shannon, 
10.31M) calls "a far-right group with a history of violent confrontations." The Washington Post 
(9/30, Al, Hawkins, Wootson, Timberg, 14.2M) says the group was "created in 2016 by a 
former Vice magazine co-founder" and has become "a fixture at political demonstrations around 
the country, often showing up wielding batons, bear spray and firearms, ready to do battle with 
their perceived enemies in the far-left antifa movement. Leaders say they disavow racism, 
though the Proud Boys have ties to white supremacists and sometimes use nationalist rhetoric 
common among hate groups." The Washington Times (9/30, Richardson, 492K) reports that 
Kentucky State University associate professor Wilfred Reilly, noting that the group's 
international chairman is Black, "said that about 10% to 20% of the group's activists are non-
White, adding, `Proud Boys are not White supremacists.' The Washington Post (9/30, Timberg, 
Dwoskin, 14.2M) says "mainstream platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube have 
cracked down on the Proud Boys for violations against hate speech and other policies." 
Cardinal Dolan Praises Barrett, Says Her Faith Should Be Respected. 
The New York Post (9/30, Campanile, 4.57M) reports that during his SiriusXM radio show 
"Conversation with Cardinal Dolan" on Thursday, Cardinal Timothy Dolan "raved about Judge 
Amy Coney Barrett's credentials to serve on the US Supreme Court - and warned that her deep 
Catholic faith should be respected, not attacked, during confirmation hearings." Dolan said, 
"She takes her Catholic faith seriously, but that is not why she was nominated as a justice to 
the Supreme Court, is it? I think she is nominated because she is the best candidate around. ... 
I hope so. And from what I hear, she is. So, let's hope for the best." Dolan "said he did not 
know Barrett personally but was `proud' of her" and that "people he's spoken to who know 
Barrett well `sparkle about her.'"
