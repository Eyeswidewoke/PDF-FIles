The Hill (10/19, 2.98M) reports, "Among the alleged attacks were hack-and-leak 
operations against the political party of now-French President Emanuel Macron in 2017, along 
with other French politicians. They are also alleged to have targeted the 2018 Winter Olympics 
in Pyeongchang, South Korea, as retaliation for Russians being banned from participating in the 
games due to doping allegations. Further, the six Russian nationals were indicted in connection 
to attacks on the Ukrainian power grid and government agencies, which caused widespread 
power outages; for targeting two organizations involved in investigating the United Kingdom-
based nerve agent attack on former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter; and for most 
recently targeting Georgian government agencies and companies." 
Axios (10/19, Rummler, 521K) reports, "FBI Deputy Director David Bowdich thanked 
Google, Cisco, Facebook and Twitter `for all stepping up and helping us with this investigation,' 
adding: `This is more common that we work together with our private sector partners than ever 
before.' 
KDKA-TV Pittsburgh (10/19, 144K) reports, "Along with the damage to the Heritage Valley 
Health System, they also caused damage and disruption in France, Georgia, the Netherlands, 
Korea, Ukraine, and the United Kingdom. `The exceptional talent and dedication of our teams in 
Pittsburgh, Atlanta, and Oklahoma City who spent years tracking these members of the GRU is 
unmatched,' said FBI Pittsburgh Special Agent in Charge Michael A. Christman. `These criminals 
underestimated the power of shared intelligence, resources, and expertise through law 
enforcement, private sector, and international partnerships." USA Today (10/19, 10.31M) and

Maryland Man Linked To "Boogaloo" Movement Faces Gun Charge. 
The AP (10/19) reports from Greenbelt, Maryland, "A Maryland man described by the FBI as a 
member of the anti-government "boogaloo" movement pleaded not guilty to a gun charge on 
Monday, court records show." Frank William Robertson Perry, 39, "remained jailed after his 
arraignment on a charge that he illegally possessed a rifle. He is prohibited from possessing a 
firearm or ammunition due to a 2002 burglary conviction, the FBI said. A grand jury indicted 
Perry on the charge after his Oct. 7 arrest." The FBI "identified Perry as a member of the 
boogaloo movement in September, an agent wrote in seeking a warrant to search the Dundalk 
home he shares with his girlfriend. Court records don't specify why the FBI's Joint Terrorism 
Task Force opened its investigation of Perry, who posted images associated with the boogaloo 
on a Facebook account that the FBI says belongs to him." 
WJZ-TV Baltimore (10/19, 74K) reports, "Agents found and seized a number of items from 
the basement bedroom, including a black tactical vest containing two ballistic plates located on 
the interior of the vest, two loaded rifle magazines located in pouches affixed to the exterior of 
the vest, a third loaded rifle magazine located on top of the vest and an Anderson 
Manufacturing rifle model AM-15 bearing serial number 20034967 which was partially 
concealed. They also found ammunition located inside a black box in the nightstand and other 
firearm-related accessories. The Anderson rifle was bought in parts by Perry and his girlfriend, 
who lived with Perry, a federal agent claimed in the affidavit. Perry allegedly put the rifle 
together."
