PAGE 2 OF 5 
I informed you that I selected Mr. 
because he was a friend and classmate of two people 
whom I respected, and that I had never met or spoken with Mr. 
rior to contacting him about 
this case. All of those facts are true. I still have never' met Mr. 
and, at the time that he and 
I spoke about this case, he did not know about my relationship wi 
is friend. You sir gest that I 
should have ex licitly informed you that one of the referrals came from my 
ther than 
sim I a 
which is the term I used, but it is not my nature to iscuss my 
opposing counsel. Your attacks on me and on the victims establish why wanted 
to find someone whom I could trust with safeguarding the victims' best interests in the face of 
intense pressure from an unlimited number of highly skilled and well paid attorneys. Mr. 
was that person. 
One of your letters suggests a business relationship between Mr. 
d
This is patentl untrue and neither my 
nor I would have recent 
any financial bene t 
from Mr. 
appointment. Furthermore, after Mr. = 
learned more about Mr. Epstein's 
actions (as escn 
below), he expressed a willingness to handle the case pro bono, with no 
financial benefit even to himself. Furthermore, you were given several other options to choose from, 
including the Podhurst firm, which was later selected by 
. You rejected those other 
options. 
You also allege that I improperly disclosed information about the case to Mr. ME 
I 
to help him deer
 the case was something he and his firm would be willing to undertake. 
provided Mr. 
with a bare bones summary ofthe agreement's terms related to his appointment 
confidential
and instead recommen!Rat he "Google" Mr. Epstein's name for background information. When 
I did not provide Mr. 
with facts related to the investigation because they were 
forM 
ked for additional
a:se questions to you, and you raised objections for the first time. I did not share any 
information to assist his firm in addressing conflicts issues, I 
further information about Mr. Epstein or the case. Since Mr. 
had been told that you 
concurred in his selection, out of professional courtesy, I inform 
Mr. 
f the Office's 
decision to use a Special Master to make the selection and told him that the 
ice ad made contact 
with •. 
We have had no further contact since then and I have never had contact with 
understand from you that Mr. = 
contacted 
. You criticize his 
ecision to do so, yet you feel that you and your co-counsel were emit 
to contact 
to 
try to "lobby" him to select someone to your liking, despite the fact that the Non-Prosecution 
Agreement vested the Office with the exclusive right to select the attorney representative. 
Another reason for my surprise about your allegations regarding misconduct related to the 
Section 2255 litigation is your earlier desire to have me perform the role of "facilitator" to convince 
the victims that the lawyer representative was selected by the Office to represent their interests alone 
and that the out-of-court settlement of their claims was in their best interests. You now state that 
doing the same things that you had asked me to do earlier is improper meddling in civil litigation. 
Much of your letter reiterates the challenges to Detective
