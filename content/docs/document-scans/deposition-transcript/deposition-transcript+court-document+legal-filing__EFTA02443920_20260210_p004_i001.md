Puerto Vallarta Mexico — Alex Davis, the son of the owner of the golf 
community development in Puerto Vallarta that needs to be redeveloped, came 
last month to Bright's Creek and for two days we discussed the nature of the 
community development business and how we might work together. He is very 
pleasant, he appears to be agreeable, he left and we have not heard back. I would 
assume that we will not be involved in this redevelopment. 
(d) 
St. Kitts — St. Kitts owes Landmark $250,000 as the second payment on the 
business plan. After the Prime Minister's reelection (for an unprecedented 4th
term), his representative emailed us and said we should expect payment in 
February, and we did, and we were disappointed. We have reminded them again 
of their obligation. 
5. 
Cash Flow — Now for the finale you have been waiting for — cash flow. The only 
substantial cash income that Landmark can achieve in the short run is sales in South 
Padre and fees from Barbados. Under the bank agreement in Barbados, we cannot 
declare a dividend until after the bank is fully repaid. So, in short, Landmark has little or 
no income and diminished, but still substantial expenses. In these circumstances one can 
only borrow, which we have done, go broke, or sell assets. It is patent that in these times, 
you can only sell your better assets. Claudia Holliman has $2,000,000 of preferred stock 
that we have not been able to pay the required dividend. Last week we agreed to sell her 
3% of the ownership of Apes Hill with the cancellation of the $2,000,000 of preferred 
stock and the additional investment of $1,000,000 in cash. This values Apes Hill at 
$100,000,000 and our interest at $33,000,000. 
For the last approximately 9 months, Paul Lamb, acting as a trustee for a large private 
trust, has shown interest in investing in Apes Hill. He has hired a golf analyst from 
Dallas to talk to Martha monthly and report to him on the progress of Apes Hill. He 
arrived Saturday afternoon at Apes Hill and has been extremely positive about our 
development, but no business has been discussed. Martha and I go in the morning to 
Barbados and I anticipate meetings with him on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. I have 
no idea of Paul's perception of value, but in conversations with Martha and his analyst, I 
believe he would like to lend money to Landmark or to Apes Hill that was convertible 
into the stock of Apes Hill. I am confident that we will have disagreement of value, but I 
am also confident that the quality and acceptance, at the highest level, of the Apes Hill 
Club, makes it the kind of property that Paul would like to be associated with. I am told 
that there are only 16 English Dukes and that 2 Dukes, the Duke of Marlborough and the 
Duke of Beaufort, played independently at Apcs Hill Club in the month of February, as 
did Prince Harry. We all know you cannot deposit prestige in the bank, but perhaps it 
will be an influence on Paul.
