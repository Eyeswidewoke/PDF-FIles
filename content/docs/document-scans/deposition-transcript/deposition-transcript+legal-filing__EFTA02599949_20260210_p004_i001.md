Noam - 
Thank you for your reply. As you =ndicate that you are not being represented by counsel I will reply 
directly to you, with a copy to Rich (as you suggest). Please =onsider: 
1. 
As a starting point, let me note that I =hink you and Rich may have misunderstood (at least 
initially) the terms =f the settlement that Harry proposed through his attorney. Rich and I discussed this in a call about 
10 days ago and I'm =oping that misunderstanding has been cleared up, but as I'm not = party to your exchanges (and 
Rich's exchanges) with Harry'= attorney I can't be sure. I'm also not certain =hether the terms of the proposed 
settlement have changed. All I can say for sure is =hat characterizing the offer as one in which distributions to you 
=annot exceed S100K per year is not consistent with my understanding of =hat has been offered. 
The reason why the proposal is too =utrageous to discuss has nothing to do with the technicalities of the 
=andout that Harry is graciously offering. I'll review the =ackground, once again.

As I've discussed before, the Marital =rust was established in Carol's name for tax purposes. The 
=bvious intention, clearly understood by Carol and me, and of course =ric Menouya, was that it would be available to the 
survivor -- Carol we assumed -- =nd then what remains would go to the beneficiaries. The idea that =e intended that 
Carol would control "her" funds and I would control =mine" is too ludicrous to discuss, though I understand the legalistic 
conjuring that can be adduced to reach this =onclusion. As you note, I was not working with you at the time =ou and 
Carol drew up your wills and trusts, but what you describe is =ot consistent with Eric's notes (which I have), nor with the 
facts as I understand them. You are right that tax savings =ere a major driver to the planning (and the plan did in fact 
result in substantial savings of both =state and income taxes) but it was not drafted with the expectation =hat Carol 
would survive you. 
The question of who would be the survivor =s irrelevant. Carol and I assumed that she would be the 
survivor, =ut there was no reason to tell anyone, and it has no bearing at all on =he fact that our intention was that the 
principal would be available to =he survivor, then going to the children 
The =ecision to fund Carol's trust with both financial assets and =our Cape and Lexington homes was 
made whenWas already ill and (as far as the notes indicate) with =he expectation that she would predecease =ou. 
This is =uite surprising, and I would like some clarification. Most =mportant, I don't see how any 
significant decisions could have been =ade during those years, who could have made them, or why it was =one. 
Obviousl \Mcould not have done so. She had to =ndergo massive brain radiation as soon as the biopsy was taken, 
and =erious cognitive and physical decline was immediate. Nor could I =ave been involved. I very much wanted to keep 
her at home, rather =han the only alternative -- a nursing home. I managed to do so =or two years, until the end, but it 
required 24-hour care, and I was in =o position to think about such matters. If I had been informed -- = don't recall 
anything of the sort -- I couldn't have paid any =ttention or granted truly informed consent. So I would like to =earn 
more about these decisions.
