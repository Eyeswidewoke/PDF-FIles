crushing an opponent--this is very American. You know, =Mother Teresa is not going to build the broadband network of 
the future." 
Recently, the wife of a software developer was listening to her husband describe for me what it was like to be in the 
=same industry as Bill Gates: he was saying, in a pained but stoical way, that maybe Gates didn't have to be quite so 
competitive now that he had achieved great power, and that it might be better for the computer industry as a whole if 
he behaved in a more benevolent way, when his wife interrupted and said to me, "No. You don't understand. We talk 
about Bill Gates every night at home. We think about Bill Gates all the =time. It's like Bill Gates lives with us." This 
enveloping sense of Bill Gates is hard for someone outside the computer industry to fathom. To =people who are 
unfamiliar with computers, Gates is just a nerd, and if =you try to get them to square the negative connotation of the 
word "nerd" with Gates' incredible success, and with the fact that, far from =being on the margin of society, Gates is 
now in a position to determine =what society is like, they're likely to say, "Well, I guess it really is the revenge of the 
nerds." Actually, Gates probably represents the end =of the word "nerd" as we know it. 
But all Gates' influence and success are small potatoes compared with the influence he could have and with the 
opportunity that now lies before him. The computer, which in twenty-five years has evolved from a room-size 
mainframe into a laptop device, appears to be turning into a new kind of machine. The new machine will =be a 
communications device that connects people to the information highway. It will penetrate far beyond the fifteen per 
cent of American =households that now own a computer, and it will control, or absorb, other communications machines 
now in people's homes--the phone, the fax, the television. It will sit in the living room, not in the study. The =problem of 
getting people to feel comfortable with such a powerful machine will be partly solved by putting it inside one of the 
most unobtrusive objects in the house--the set-top converter, which is the featureless black box on top of a cable-
connected TV set (the one the cat likes to sit on if the VCR is occupied). 
Gates would like to have his software inside that box. Microsoft's ambition is to supply the standard operating-system 
software for the information-highway machine, just as it now supplies the standard operating-system software, called 
Windows, for the personal computer. Microsoft has two billion dollars in cash, and no debt, and =is spending a hundred 
million dollars a year developing software for the new machine, which is a lot more than anyone else is spending. The 
plan is first to supply the software that allows people to rent videos over =the TV and makes home shopping more 
attractive, and then to use money from the video-rental and home-shopping businesses to pay for the development of 
the rest of the software. Therefore, Gates is now meeting with people like Mike Ovitz and Barry Diller to discuss better 
ways of =delivering their products into people's homes. "I actually requested a =meeting with him," Ovitz told me last 
October. "I flew up to Seattle and we had dinner together and spent three or four hours just talking about the future." 
"Could you say specifically what you talked about?" 
"It was just very deep stuff about the future." 
"Well, for example, did you talk about information-highway software?" =/p> 
"It goes much deeper than that." 
At Microsoft's main office, in Redmond, a suburb of Seattle, I saw a demo of an early version of the company's operating 
software for the information-highway machine, in which the user points =at the TV screen with a remote control, clicks 
onto icons, and selects =from menus. I heard a lot about "intelligent agents," which will at first be animated characters 
that occasionally appear in the corner of =your TV screen and inform you, for example, that President Aristide is =on 
"Meet the Press," because they know you're interested in Haitian politics, but will eventually be out there on the 
information highway, =filtering the torrent of information roaring along it, picking out books or articles or movies for 
you, or receiving messages from individuals. =As the agents become steadily more intelligent, they will begin to replace 
more and more of the functions of human intelligent agents--stockbrokers, postal workers, travel agents, librarians, 
editors, reporters. While I was at Microsoft, I sometimes felt like prey.
