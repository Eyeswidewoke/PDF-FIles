'Governance of the contemporary food system is complex and rapidly evolving. As cities, regions. 
and nations deal with concerns about safety. security, environmental impact. and climate change 
affecting food supply and distribution, the governance of food and farmingsystems is being 
reexamined and in some cases modified. Designed to follow other policy and food justice classes, 
this course is conducted In an applied studio format. After learning about bask food governance 
principles, practices, and models, students research and analyze food governance processes at 
the local, regional, and national levels, including the work of Now York City community boards on 
food policy, the evolution of governance frameworks involving local and regional planning 
authorities, and the emerging "food federalism:"

The course focuses both on the role food plays in global tourism, both as a weapon of 
environmental and social destabilization and as a potential tool for sustainable and sociallyjust 
systems. The relevance or concepts such as authenticity. originality. cosmopolitanism and 
exploration for culinary tourists is analyzed from the cultural, social and economic points of view. 
The course investigates tourism projects in different parts of the world that use food in order to 
promote sustainable development. As the connection between food and territory and its value for 
tourism expansion is discussed. students reflect on the potential of various locations- both rural 
and urban- to develop sustainable food tourism destinations.

The state of the air, water, and soil climate change, habitat conversion. invasive species. 
biodiversity decline, deforestation. overfishing. and many other environmental issues are at the 
core of most of our pressing economic. social, political and human health concerns. This course 
examines the roots of the modern environmental crisis, reviewing the most current environmental 
issues and the underlying science for a critical look at how societies have interacted with the 
natural environment past and present and requirements for a sustainable future. The course 
consists of small group discussions. readings and case studies. <cliv>This course is open to all 
bachelor level students at the university.</div>

CRN 7079 Sec A 
Students learn the fundamental ecological principles starting with core concepts in evolution then 
building from species and populations to community dynamics and structure, the study of 
ecosystems, and finally landscape ecology. The course also introduces the drivers of biodiversity, 
the importance of genetic diversity, and the impacts of climate change on species and 
communities. This course is positioned to justify the statement that understanding ecology (how 
biological organisms interact with each other and their environment) is crucial to understanding 
how to move toward a more sustainable future. <div>This course is open to all bachelor level 
students at the universrty.</div>

'This course takes a literary approach to the history of American environmentalism. Starting with 
the journals of early explorers and settlers and surveying four centuries of nature writing, popular 
history, and journalism, the course will offer an introduction to American ideas of wilderness and 
the natural world and chart the ways in which they have changed from the colonial era to the 
digital age. Major toss include the birth of "the conservation movement" at the end of the 19th 
century, the "land ethic" and the rise of ecological thinking; the landmark wildemess preservation 
and antipollution campaigns of the 1960s and 70s: and contemporary issues including 
environmental justice and —ecoterrorism.— Readings range from 'classic' works by Emerson. 
Thoreau, John Muir. and Aldo Leopold to more contemporary pieces by Rachel Carson. Edward 
Abbey. and John McPhee, among others: the role of photography and documentary film will also be 
explored. Students should emerge with a good grasp of the foundations and challenges of the 
environmental movement today, as well as an appreciation for the power of writing and image-
making to shape public opinion and shift public Poky.—

'Chemistry of the Environment: Chemistry has contributed to our understanding of environmental 
issues, but it has also been responsible for some of them. This course will discuss fundamental 
chemistry concepts to explain the causes of environmental challenges and to offer possible 
solutions and policies to address them. Topics that will be explored include CO water quality and 
access to safe drinking water. fill acid rain. (iii) fossil fuels and renewable energy sources. (iv) the 
chemistry of greenhouse gases. and (v) polymers. Plastics and "green" alternatives. Students 
who have completed Chemistry of Life or Chemical Narrative of the Cell should not take this 
course. This course satisfies the Chemistry requirement for the Interdisciplinary Science and 
Environmental Studies major. (4 credits)'

This interdisciplinary course is designed to introduce students to the many facets of climate 
(averages, extremes, variability and change) and the broad range of climate affairs and issues that 
affect society at global and local scales. Given the growing concern about global climate change, it 
is intended to provide a baseline understanding of climate-society interactions. focusing on five 
basic elements: a) climate science and knowledge; b) climate impacts: c) climate economics; d) 
climate politics and policy; and e) climate ethics and equity. A broad range of topics will be covered 
including: global warming 101. hazards (floods. droughts. and hurricanes). El Ni —Southern 
Oscillation, food insecurity, mainstreaming gender into global responses, vulnerability, the politics 
of climate disasters. adaptation, and climate justice. There are no prerequisites.

CRN 7779 Sec A 
This interdisciplinary course explores the notion of 'food' as an urban system and tests its 
potential for shaping more sustainable city environments in the 21st century. TIthOLI€POUI the 
semester, the class will engage in a concrete hands-on experiment of 'unmasking' the urban food 
system at work in the context of The New School's 'foodshed' to identify key challenges and 
opportunities to put into practice the goals of the New York City-wide plan 'FoodWorks.' In 
particular, students will learn to appreciate the different rings of the food system chain (from 
production to processing, distribution, consumption and post-consumption) not as separate 
islands but as closely interconnected places, actors and practices, producing tangible impacts on 
the ecological, economic. social and health dimensions of urban life. This knowledge will support 
the creation of text and graphical visualizations, as well as targeted project proposals. which will 
be presented and discussed in an exhibition to which university and city officials will be invited.
