I am writing this essay because I am puzzled. In July 2015 
I took eighteen haiku-like poems to a writers' conference 
and presented them as my own work. In reality, a program 
I created called "Inkwell" wrote them, and I intended to 
execute a variant of the Thring Test. The results were better 
than I had hoped for in verifying InkWell as a good poet, but 
I was left with disquiet about what the experience meant for 
understanding the Turing Test, programming, the artificial 
intelligence research program, and what consciousness is. 
In the Winter of 2014 I programmed my English language 
revision system [1] to write haiku—just to see whether it 
could do so plausibly. I let the system run overnight generat-
ing about 2000 haiku. Among them were the four at the top 
of the next column. They stopped me in my tracks because 
the quick program I wrote was not of the monkeys typing 
at keyboards variety—instead I programmed the system to 
determine its own topic and then write coherently about it 
using a few dozen haiku templates as starting points. And

those four haiku are good—not just human-like, but good 
poetry with two of them close to being exceptional. I worked 
on the system more over the next six months, broadening 
and expanding the template language to give more control 
to InkWell, deepening its understanding of language and 
the music of language, and adding more observations Ink-
Well could make of its drafts and along with them more 
revisions. Over those months InkWell produced a lot more 
haiku, and I selected fourteen of them to add to the above 
four for a Turing Test. 
In October 1950, the British journal Mind published an 
essay by Alan M. Turing titled, "Computing Machinery 
and Intelligence," in which Turing proposed an operational 
definition for "intelligence" [2]. This definition would come 
to be called "the Turing Test." Turing himself called it "the 
imitation game," in which a questioner separated from two 
contestants would submit questions to those contestants. 
read their replies, and ultimately choose one as human and 
the other as machine. 
Interestingly, Thring introduced this game with a similar 
but different one in which the interrogator was to attempt to 
determine the gender of two contestants, one male the other 
female. Interesting because Turing was homosexual and 
perhaps accustomed to such an imitation game. But in the 
matter of intelligence, such an operational definition made 
some sense. Thring wrote the following: 
May not machines carry out something which ought 
to be described as thinking but which is very different 
from what a man does? This objection is a very strong 
one, but at least we can say that if nevertheless, a ma-
