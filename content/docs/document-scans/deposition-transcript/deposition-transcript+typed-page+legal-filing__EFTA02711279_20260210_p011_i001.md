The empirical: knowledge derived from experience. The epistemological: investigation of the methods and limits of 
knowledge. At the intersection of the empirical and the epistemological: a convenient nowhere, anytime, to be or not to be. 
Confusion: the incredible something of nothing. Beyond the reality principle there is nothingness: the void. And beyond the 
void: description of the void: the idealization, the objectification of nothing. Description of nothing, of event, of process, of 
doing, of void: a thing. The description is the thing. At the intersection of the empirical and the epistemological: a convenient 
nowhere, anytime, to be or not to be. 
There is ftceonly a limited value / In the knowledge derived from experience. / The knowledge imposes a pattern, and falsifies, 
/ For the pattern is new in every moment / And every moment is a new and shocking / Valuation of all we have been.aw At 
the intersection of the empirical and the epistemological: the first time that says anytime; the first place that says nowhere; the 
first thing that says nothing: the fact with a sense of humor. 
Truth is now a matter of convenience; concepts are valid only in their capacity to sustain interest: only in their use. The 
interchangeability of concepts is a consequence of the non-interchange- ability of the coupling operation. The description of 
the coupling of the undifferentiated activity: a thing, a distinction, a differentiation. aceAn instrument which would depict the 
Source / Does not produce what bathes it as wel111126 The description is the thing: everything. It is not a case of different 
ways of putting the same thing. ficeLife consists / Of propositions about life.fil=" itaTMs the next word that matters. ficeThat 
one word might be a name, the release from a name.lus
The round earth followed from the flat earth. Before the of the round earth, all thoughts, concepts, were the product of the 
sensibility of life on a flat earth. The earth was flat until the point of creation of the round earth; which is not to say that the 
earth was flat until we realized that all along it had been round. 
The information on the previous page is false. The previous page is the flat earth. This page is the round earth. The earth is 
round: this page is being read. if we talk of a flat earth producing a round earth; the round earth is doing the talking. If we 
talk of the previous page: this page is doing the talking. The previous page as an entity is the invention of this page, it can 
exist only on this page, it can live only on this page. We must not assume the existence of any entity until we are compelled to 
do so. Without this page the previous page could not have existence as an entity. The previous page exists as an entity only 
through decreation; this page decreates the previous page. Decreation of the thing described: assumption by this page of the 
description of the thing described: this page describing the previous page. Decreation; this page invents the previous page: 
round earth invents flat earth. 
ficahere is nothing more to invent, nothing more to play with.1029 No creation, no becoming, no pretention, no intention: 
acethataTMs not how the show is run: / This independent mind, / UnkingdomaTMd, might as well be none.a1~4 No one: aceNot 
the intense moment / isolated, with no before and after, / But a lifetime burning in every moment / And not the lifetime of one 
man only / But of old stones that cannot be deciphered:al' 
And whatever you can do . . . there will be no difference. And whatever you will do . . . there will be no difference. And 
whatever you could do, donalMt do, should do . . . and whatever you do . . . there will be no difference. 
Unitless unity: silence. aceBut listen! When, / If ever in the windings of the dance, / To-be-said and saying in perfection fit, / 
Another silence listens: listen again.i"2
