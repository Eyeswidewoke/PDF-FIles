Three-year-old Saria Amaya waits with her mother after receiving shoes and school supplies durin= a charity event in 
October to help more than 4,000 underprivileged children a= the Fred Jordan Mission in the Skid Row area of Los 
Angeles. Children from low-income families now make up a majority of public school students in the nation, according to 
a new report. 
The shift to a majority-poor student=population means that in public schools, more than half of the children start 
kindergarten already trailing their more privileged peers and rarely, if ever, catch up. T=ey are less likely to have support 
at home to succeed, are less frequently exposed to enriching activities outside of school, and are more likely to drop out 
and never attend college. It =lso means that education policy, funding decisions and classroom instruction must adapt 
to the swelling ranks of nee=y children arriving at the schoolhouse door each morning. 
Schools, already under intense pressure to deliver better tes= results and meet more rigorous standards, face the doubly 
difficult task of trying to raise the achievement of poor children so that they approach the =ame level as their more 
affluent peers. "This is a watershed m=ment when you look at that map," said Kent McGuire, president of the Southern 
Educati=n Foundation, the nation's oldest education philanthropy, referring t= a large swath of the country filled with 
high-poverty schools. "Th= fact is, we've had growing inequality in the country for many years=" he said. "It didn't 
happen overnight, but it's steadily been happening. Government used to be a source of lea=ership and innovation 
around issues of economic prosperity and upward mobility. Now we=E2nre a country disinclined to invest in our 
young people."

"That's huge," she said. =E2040These children can learn at the highest levels, but you have to provide for them.=You 
can't assume they have books at home, or they visit the library or =o on vacations. You have to think about what you're 
doing across the sta=e and ensuring they're getting what other children get." 
The Obama =dministration wants Congress to add $1 billion to the $14.4 billion it spends annually to help states educate 
poor children. =t also wants Congress to fund preschool for those from low-income families. Collectively, the states and 
the federal government spend about $500 billio= annually on primary and secondary schools, with about $79 billion 
coming fr=m Washington. The amount spent on each student can vary wildly from state to state. Vermont, with a 
relatively low student-poverty rate of 36 percent, spent the most of any state in 2012-201=, at $19,752 per pupil. In the 
same school year, Arizona, with a 51 percent student-poverty rate, spent the least in the nation at $6,949 per student, 
according to data compiled by the National Education Association. States wi=h high student-poverty rates tend to spend 
less per student: Of the 27 states with the highest percentages of student poverty, all but five spent less th=n the 
national average. "The problems are as big as they've ever been over the last 50 years, and yet the rel=tive level of 
public investment to face those challenges is really modest,"
