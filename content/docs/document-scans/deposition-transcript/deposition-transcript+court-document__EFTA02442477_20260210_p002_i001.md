it was always a bad ideal t I  i have been consistant.. The feedback is from people that like 
massages.. not an diverse group. it is not distinctive, every hotel has it and loses money on it. 
and considering their clientele changes and that they arc usually exhausted it is a good 
framework to see that the idea dos not have legs/ e mail me a phone number and it will try 
to call

In I h v 
massage rooms at the 
(a cosmetic boutique in t to west vi age , an 
also offer my services to The Standard Hotel. There are about 6 other residential buildings 
that are interested and in the beginning stages of setting up or waiting for last approvals 
from the board. Have also just been contacted by Abigail Michaels Concierge with an 
interest in using my company as a preferred vendor. I have 6 licensed massage therapists 
who I am getting great responses from and have been really reliable and professional. 
I am finding some success in finding locations to set up shop but it isn't working. Feedback tells 
me that the concept is a good idea, to kind of create personal spas in high end residential 
buildings, and some buildings have been willing to take on the expenses of the table, linens, 
etc. But it has been a lot of work and has not shown financial reward. Either the feedback 
is wrong and I have taken another one of my bad ideas too far, or else I am not 
implementing it properly. I feel like if there is high quality massage services available in a 
residential building of 400+ multimillion dollar units it should be generating business. If I 
were to get my massage license and was able to take on the clients it has been able to build 
up I would have a really strong private practice and may have some extra business for my 
other therapists. I can't decide if I should be putting this company on the back burner and 
getting my own license or if I should continue working on it until I do figure out how to 
generate business in these buildings. 
Another idea that seems most appealing right now is sending my resume out to luxury resorts 
abroad. I have have a thai massage certification and also a certification to teach ashtanga 
yoga, with a fair amount of experience in both over the past couple of years. My asking to 
go to the school in Hawaii is because I have heard that it is liked by these types of jobs. and 
this option seems a million times better than absolutely anything else I can think of. 
I feel like I need your advice more than anyone else's and really wish you were here. If you
