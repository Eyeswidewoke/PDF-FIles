without a doubt , one of the smartest people i have ever =et, he is neither fluent in spanish french or italian =owever he 
is highly conversant and 
multilingual =n the areas of the most advanced science. He can =xquisitely conduct a seminar in fields as diverse as 
evolutionary =iology, computational neuro science.oreven the highly esoteric =nbsp;ndimensional manifolds. ,as well as 
music as a lens into the =rain. His interests are far ranging and unlike many that simply =epeat back what they have 
read , he is creative and original in fields =uch ase , signal intelligence, power law distributions , and =ncryption. 
I am well aware that in his past he has =ade some awful decisions, and Im sure he would have done things =ifferently if 
he had the opportunity to do them over. however he =as paid his debt to society, asked his friends and family for 
=orgiveness and has continued his charitable work that he began even =ecades before his travails. 
i have had =he privilege to meet the worlds greatest minds, and i can easily =ay that Jeffrey s is amongst the best of 
=hose. 
I have utmost confidence in his =ntegrity. I have dealt with him for a number of years on both =ides of a negotiation and 
say with certainty that 'xi rather be =n his side. 
He has been in the =illionaire business for longer than almost anyone else. His =nsight into the unique problems of the

His homes are probably =he best collection of real estate in the united states. A private =sland , that some describe as a 
tribute to megalomania. and a ranch in =ew mexico that is truly beyond imagination and my favorite townhouse in =Y. 
His attention to detail is remarkable . I =ind it sad that he doesn't have children of his own, but makes up for =t by 
maintaining close friendships that have lasted for =ecades. 
His chariblae instincts have =een honed over many years and his advice and judgment has been =nvaluable in several 
instances. 
His =bility to explain complex derivatives or concepts on the bleeding edge =f science in layman's terms is part of his 
teaching =ene. 
I have met many people who =riticize those who maintain a friendship with Jeffrey, and a group =hose opinions are
