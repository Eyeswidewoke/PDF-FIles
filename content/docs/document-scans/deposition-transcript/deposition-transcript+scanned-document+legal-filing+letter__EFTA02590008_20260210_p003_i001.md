12. To repeat, I appreciate the offer of Janusz' help. I will put Janusz and Albert in touch. Perhaps Janusz 
coud work on the exterior, lower level, north side utilty closets, cleaning them and possibly putting a coat of shiny 
garage paint on them as one item. 
13. Photos. By Friday I will send newly taken photos of the areas in JEE's photos showing the corrective 
measures. 
14. Occupancy. No one has spent a night in that house except, and I very much regret this, Carmo who 
spent about 8 days there which was the outside of how long he said he would be there. No one is staying there now. 
Painters are inside and working most evenings. There is no tv or phone. 
Albert Cano, the current property manager for Steve Ross and former for Stu Subotnick ,is managing 
most of the work. I speak to him daily and text and email him more frequently. The same is true for Ron Shaffer who is 
working on the interior.We are using the same contractor currently renovating Steve's house and many of the same 
subs. We are getting very good value for money and have completed substantial work (some structural) that that were 
noted on our inspection report. I believe we stretched our budget dollar very well. 
A lot of work (I repeat) was largely invisible now and related to items that appeared on our earlier 
inspection report (some structural in a minor way — ) that are long ago fixed. We are doing this as discreetly as possible 
because of the nosey neighbor syndrome but at times there has been scaffolding up and exterior evidence of work. (The 
hedge helped hide this.) 
In all of this I have been guided by the opinions of the top PB brokers (Moens, McCann, Turner, Hall, 
Hollis). No one has mentioned to me a complaint about the unsightliness of the house and again, I apologize you caught 
us with our pants down. It will not happen again. 
One factor is that even at our marked up selling price expectation, we are talking close-to land value. 
This summer a similar sized lot as to area (but with more frontage) sold as a tear down in the mid Vs. Just last week, a 
demolition permit was issued for 170O South Ocean (the house on the north corner of the block) and a new 2 story 
Regency is planned there. So there is a real possibility that this house can sell even close to $8 as a tear down. There 
have been multiple stories in The Shiny Sheet this summer about how prime this block is for redevelopment. I have been 
trying to steer a middle path: making it an attractive as either a move-in condition house or a tear down. This has 
affected my decision-making in how and what to spend on. It surely, however, doesn't excuse the house being unsightly. 
Although I have been in NYC 2 weeks for medical reasons I was in PB all summer paying close attention 
and regularly touching base with more brokers than I listed above. All are very optimistic about the house and keep 
moving up their value estimates. I am very confident about our being able to sell at a strong price and reasonable time. 
I am out of the hospital and will be back in PB in a week or at most two. I am feeling much better, my 
MG exacerbation is receding, and have a treatment plan in the works for my pancreatic issue which will mostly happen 
in PB. I would like to discuss this with you at a more appropriate time and I would welcome any guidance, insights or 
referrals. 
I (and Steve) am deeply grateful for your participation. I will not let you down (again). 
Paul
