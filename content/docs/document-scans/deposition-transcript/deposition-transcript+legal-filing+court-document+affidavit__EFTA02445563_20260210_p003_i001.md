murdering Maria Lopez de Felix. At the time of the crime, Kennedy was employed as an 
Immigration and Naturalization Officer, and the victim was a Mexican national who had 
attempted to enter the United States illegally. According to the facts presented at trial, Kennedy 
was escorting Lopez de Felix to the Mexican border when he led her to an unoccupied building, 
raped and strangled her, and left her body on an adjacent walkway. Following his conviction, 
Kennedy was sentenced to life imprisonment. 
After serving 20 years in federal prison, Kennedy was released on parole in January 2000 to the 
supervision of the U.S. Parole Commission in the District of Maryland. Included in the standard 
conditions of his release was the requirement that Kennedy register as a sex offender in 
accordance with the laws of any State with which he had contact, as directed by his U.S. 
Probation Officer. The condition provided specifically: 
If you have been convicted of any sexual offense under District of Columbia or federal law 
(including Uniform Code of Military Justice offenses), you must report for registration with your 
state sex offender registration agency as directed by your U.S. Probation Officer. You are 
required to report for registration in any state in which you live, work, attend school, or pursue 
any vocation. You must be registered in compliance with applicable state law that applies to 
current or prior federal, state, or local convictions for sexual offenses, and in compliance with 42 
U.S.C. § 14072(i) (which makes it a federal crime for any offender covered by 18 U.S.C. § 4042 
not to register in accordance with state law). If there is any question as to whether or where you 
are required to register, you must seek and follow the guidance of your U.S. Probation Officer. 
J.A. 18. 
When Kennedy's U.S. Probation Officer, Michael Allen, instructed Kennedy to register as a sex 
offender in Maryland in accordance with Maryland law, Kennedy objected, arguing that 
Maryland law did not require him to register. Nonetheless, Kennedy reported to the Wicomico 
County Sheriffs Office to register, as Allen had directed. The Sheriffs Office, however, refused 
to accept Kennedy's registration, concluding that Kennedy was not required to register under 
Maryland law. Consequently, Officer Allen withdrew his instruction to Kennedy to register in 
Maryland as a sex offender. 
In 2004, Officer Allen learned of several troubling incidents in which Kennedy had acted 
inappropriately toward women. In addition, Allen received a report from Kennedy's therapist 
indicating that recent evaluations suggested that Kennedy posed a moderate risk of committing 
another sex offense. Officer Allen submitted those facts to the Parole Commission, and the 
Commission modified Kennedy's parole conditions to require him to submit to a polygraph 
examination and to continue participating in a sex-offender treatment program. After Kennedy 
objected to these conditions, the Commission's National Appeals Board affirmed them on 
January 7, 2005. In response, Kennedy filed a pro se petition for habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. 
§ 2241 in the district court, challenging his new parole conditions on constitutional and statutory 
grounds. 
On July 27, 2006, while Kennedy's habeas petition was pending, Congress enacted SORNA, 
which provides that "[a] sex offender shall register, and keep the registration current, in each 
jurisdiction where the offender resides, where the offender is an employee, and where the
