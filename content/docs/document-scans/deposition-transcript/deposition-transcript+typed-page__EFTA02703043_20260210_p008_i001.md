returning back to Iraq where he w=s killed)40=A0 to destroy Israel and the West and by taking him out of power would 
add to the stability of =he entire Middle East. What a crock.... And although he was =orn in Tel Vivi he was raised in 
Pennsylvania, yet he has push the expansion of Jewish settlements=(mostly European immigrants) in the West Bank 
displacing Palestinian families who h=ve been living there for hundreds if not thousands of years. 
Netan=ahu doesn't believe in a two-state solution. Remember that this is the=same person who started an unnecessary 
war in Gaza last summer that killed over 2000 Palestinians, including over 500 innocent children. He is a bully with 200 
nuclear weapons himself, telling a country that he has threaten to overthrow that t=ey shouldn'tl>=A0also have a 
bomb. This is a person who doesn't try to hide that it might be a good thing to bomb Iran even though they are not a 
threat to America. Hey, if I was Iran I would b= trying to develop a bomb too because Netanyahu is a war monger who is 
hellbent to des=roy your country's leadership. And on Tuesday he asked that the =merican people trust him instead of 
their President. And the Republicans in Congress applauded him 
Wow.... =C2. 
As Chris Mathews said, nowhere in the world would this have happened. Definitely not in China or Russia but also not in 
the UK, France or Germany either. In many countries i= would be called sedition. But in their zeal to discredit 
America40=804>s first President who is a Person of Color, the Republican opposition invited=a foreign leader with the 
goal of demeaning the President's foreign p=licy and undermine his administration's attempts to negotiate a treaty with 
=ran that would keep them for pursuing a nuclear weapon for at least ten years. =It would be one thing if Netanyahu a 
solution other than don't tru=t your President and you definitely can't trust the Iranians. But he has no solution.... Other 
than war.... And do we really w=nt to be part of another unnecessary war in the Middle East? 
Chris Matthews, Thomas Coleman and I are not alone as=170 former military officials and intelligence officials, including 
6 decorated generals =ho publicly exc=riated Netanyahu for giving the speech, emboldening Iran and poisoning the 
relationship between Israel and=the United States. And this response is not limited to the United States, =s yesterday 
tens of thousands of Israelis gathered in =el Aviv Square under the banner "Israel wants change" and calling for Prime 
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to be replaced in March 17 national elections. Saturday night's rally at Rabin Square is the 
highest profile demonstration yet in the run-u= to the election. It is organized by a non-profit organization seeking to 
chang= Israel's priorities and refocus on health, education, housing and the c=untry's cost of living. The rally's keynote 
speaker is former Mossad chief Meir Dagan who recently slammed Netanyahu Hs conduct and called him "the person 
who has caused the greatest strategic damage to Israel." 
While many of Netanyahu'= opponents were quick to stress that they share his views on the nuclear deal with Iran 
currently on the table, critics denounced the prime minister's speech as a political stunt mean= to bolster his election 
chances. "Is the speech, as Netanyahu in=ists, truly and solely about an Iranian atomic bomb?" asked Bradley Burston in 
an op-ed ca=led "A Special Place In Hell" for the left-wing newspaper Haar=tz. "The speech is intended to be a game 
changer. But the game in question increasingly appears to be that of helping Netanyahu to re-election in 2015."
