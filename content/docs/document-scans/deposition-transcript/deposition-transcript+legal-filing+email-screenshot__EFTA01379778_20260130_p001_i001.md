2016 revenues (w/ Paul until May) — $1.6mm 
2016 NNA — negative. After winning $100mm in CDs, lost all during DOJ crisis 
2015 revenues (combined w/ Paul) — $1.3mm 
2014 revenues (Paul Morris)— $0.9mm 
Client highlights: 
Third Lake — had major relationship breakthrough in 2016. Won $107mm in deposits in DBTCA across 18 accounts. All 
deposits and 16 accounts were gone by the end of the year due to the DOJ news (the two remaining open accounts had 
less than $1 in them). Family CIO also left in 2016. Rebuilt trust in DB throughout 2017. Opened 37 new accounts in 
2017, ending year with $82mm in DBNY deposits. Have opened 16 more accounts for third generation of family and 
gained another $40mm in 2018. Total assets here are $122mm. 
Ashley Furniture — strong relationship with founding family (Wanek/Third Lake) led to introduction to corporate 
treasury staff. Won $175mm mandate for long-dated DBNY CDs. Lots more opportunity for GTB and credit over the 
coming months. 
Southern Financial — one of the most complicated client situations I've seen. They have been extremely vocal about our 
lack of trading capabilities since I joined. Withdrew large portion of assets during 2016 (not DOJ related). Client was 
offboarded by Global markets at the end of 2016 due to lack of profitability. Further internal issues nearly caused us to 
offboard the client completely. Client was quite close to Paul and viewed his departure as a negative. I've managed to 
salvage and massively improve this relationship in the last two years. To start, we won $50mm of deposits into DBNY in 
2017. We've also turned around the GM/trading issues via KCP. Client has been re-onboarded and ISDA reestablished, 
and is now the largest trading counterparty of the KCP capital markets group. Current balances are - $230mm across 
brokerage and deposits. 
MCM — Worked closely with Terri and KCP to win fundraising mandate. Successfully convinced KCP to take on the 3PI 
mandate. After introduction was complete, worked to establish credit line with DB structured credit group. MCM has 
also been mandated by DB to assist with DOJ consumer relief settlement. 
Internal DB highlights: 
Banker partnerships — In 2017 I began to work more closely with Terri Sohrab which led to success with MCM and 
greater collaboration on several other accounts. My background and skill set are complementary to Terris and we work 
well together. I've also worked a bit with Heather Kirby and Bruce McDermott. Recently, I've been working with 
Rosemary Vrablic and her team on an insurance premium finance trade for two of her clients, referred to the bank by 
one of my close relationships. Other bankers continue to seek me out to help on certain situations and I'm known as a 
team player. I think this is especially important in the current environment at the bank. 
Internal networks — I've become quite involved with our NextGen network and will continue to contribute to those 
efforts. I've sent clients to NextGen events since 2016 and attended the Innovation Summit with a client in 2017. Based 
on my involvement last year, I am part of the steering committee for 2018. I've helped Sarah with parts of the New York 
events and have discussed taking on a broader role with Paula Pullano. Finally, I've been involved with a global DB 
branding focus group. Corporate culture is very important to me and I would like to continue to get more involved.
