"Despite legislation calling for coverage of mental heal=h and addictions, not much has changed in insurance 
coverage for prevention o= treatment," Bergen-Cico said. "Whereas health care providers are readil= prepared to 
practice medicine, [and) by this I mean write appropriate prescriptions for medication to treat depression, anxiety, 
ADHD, etc., they=are not trained as counselors and do not and should not fill that role." M=ntal illness cost about $3O0 
billion in 2002 alone in the United States, according to the report. So eleven year= later, it is estimated that this number 
has doubled. 
What is missing is the approach to men=al health problems with a comprehensive ongoing strategy much like 
what we do for physical inj=ry for which health care providers commonly employ a robust treatment that in addition to 
surgery would include any or all of the following: physical therapy, medication, preventative education and long term 
follow-up. And=all of this is included in Obamacare, which the Republican dominated Congress has decided to shut 
down the govern=ent in an effort to repeal it. 
Attached, is an article by Katy Hall & Jan=Diehm in The Huffington Post — Why U.S. Health Care Is Obscenely 
Expensive, In 12 Charts — outlining t=e economics of health care, in an endeavor to point out that although the U.S. 
leads the world in health care spending we don't live very long, and going to the doctor is so expensi=e that we don't do 
it very often — so where is the money going? =rom Lipitor to childbirth to colonoscopies -- everything just costs a 
whole lot= As congressional Republicans continue to keep the federal government closed following misguided attempts 
to defund t=e most significant health care reform in decades, please read the attached article as the charts are 
illustrations of the wasteful spending here in th= U.S.

Atmospheric science is difficult because there are so many variables involved. Heat =an be trapped in the 
depths of the oceans, thus mitigating its effect on surface temperatures — for a time. Volcanic eruptions spew particles 
into the atmosphere that block some measure of sunlight. El Nino and La Nina =hanges in Pacific Ocean currents are 
associated with seasonal or yearly temperature fluctuations.The Washington P=st — Absolutely everything you need to 
know about how the government shutdown will work. Let's take a look at how this will work. Not all government 
functions evaporated on Oct. 1 — Social Security che=ks still get mailed, and veterans' hospitals have stayed open. But 
many federal agencies had =o shut their doors and send their employees home, from the Environmental Protectio= 
Agency to hundreds of national parks. 
Here's a=look at how a shutdown will work, which parts of the government will close, and which parts of the 
economy might be affected. And why are we told that the federal government shut down? 
So... we are in a g=vernment shutdown. Now let's take a look at how it is working. 
Short answer: There are wide swaths of the federal government that need to be funded each year =n order to 
operate. Because Congress couldn't agree on how to fund them, =hey have allowed them to close down.
