FBI Data Downplays How Often Armed Civilians Stop Mass Shooters 
The Daily Caller (08/25, Crozier) reported that the FBI has undercounted cases of armed civilians stopping mass 
shootings, with the Crime Prevention Research Center (CPRC) finding that civilians stopped at least 36% of active 
shooters from 2014 to 2024, contrary to the FBI's reported 3.7%. According to the article, in 2024, armed civilians 
stopped at least 47.8% of reported active shooters, but the FBI recorded zero such cases. The article noted that the 
CPRC attributes the undercounting to the FBI overlooking or misclassifying incidents, and notes that national news 
coverage of these incidents is rare, leading to a minimized perception of the public benefits of legal gun access.
