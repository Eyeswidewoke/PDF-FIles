recent New York Times investigation which investigation questioned the cent=al tenet of the Republican assault on the 
White House regarding Benghazi in Se=tember 2012, with both Republicans and Democrats, however, remained focused 
on win=ing their daily messaging battle in Washington. Neither the American left nor the right has offered a serious 
strateg= for how to respond to the emergence of new types of militant groups across =he Middle East. President Barack 
Obama's approach consisted of trusting unchecked CIA drone strikes and NSA eavesdropping to secure the United 
States. Republicans used the region's instability as a cudgel to beat the president with. 
Here are three of 2013's most troubling development= in the Middle East—and Washington's perfunctory responses 
that were a disservi=e to all Americans. 
Benghazi's Meaning: As Amy Davidson correctly noted in The New Yorker=this week, Washington's response to months 
of investigation on the ground in Libya and Egypt by Times reporters Kirkpatrick, Suliman Al= Zway, Osama Alfitori, and 
Mayy El Sheikh quickly devolved into a useless de=ate over the term "al Qaeda." Representative Darrell Issa (R-Cali=.)—

involved in the attack "claims an affi=iation with al Qaeda," as if that was the same as an actual relationship with co=e al 
Qaeda's remaining leaders. Fox News commentator and Washingt=n Post columnist Charles Krauthammer dismissed 
the story as an effort "to protect Hillary [Clinton]." Fox News terrorism analys= Walid Phares absurdly argued that 
Kirkpatrick was "known to side with Islamists."

The broad message from the left, meanwhile, was that =he United States only makes things worse in the Middle East 
when it acts there= On MSNBC, Karen Finney said the story exonerated the Obama administration because it found that 
a fake Hollywood video mocking the Prophet Muhammad did, in fact, help spark the attack. =solationists on the left and 
the right argued that any military action—particularly one carried out by the Unite= States—was destructive. What was 
lost when each side cherry-picked conclusions that fit their worldview? The Liby=n people's growing disdain of militias, 
both jihadi and tribal. In Novem=er, Libyans outraged by rising lawlessness drove militias out of Tripoli. Libya's weak
