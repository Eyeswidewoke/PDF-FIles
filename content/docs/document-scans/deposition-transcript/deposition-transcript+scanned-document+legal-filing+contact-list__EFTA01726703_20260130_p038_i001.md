Finance Charges: Average Daily Balance Method for Calculation of Finance Charges (FC):We use the Average 
Daily Balance method to raindate FC on your Account. Under this method, we figure the FC on your Account by applWng 
the daily periodic rate to the Average Daily Balance (as described below) for each feature (such as Purchase, 
Advance and Balance Transfer features) of your Account (inducing current transactions). To get the Average Daily 
Balance for each feature, we (1) take the begnning balance for the feature each day (including unpaid FC from previous 
billing periodasii, j(2) add any new transactions, debits,. or fees, (3) subtract any payments or credits, and (4) make any 
appropriate 
stments. For each day after the first day of the billing period, we also add an amount of 
interest equ 
to the previous day's daily balance multiplied by the (ley periodic rete for the feature. 
This gives us the daily balance for the feature for that day and the beginning balance for the feature for the next day. if this 
balance is negative, it is considered to be zero. Then, we add up all the daily balances for the feature for the billing period 
and divide the total &y the number of days in the billing period. This gives us the Average Daily Balance for the feature. For 
all features except Cash Advances and certain promotions, the Average Daily Balance will be considered to be zero if you 
paid the New Balance, if any, shown on your previous month's statement by the Payment Due Date shown on that 
statement. If you multiply the Average Daly Balance for each feature by the number of days in the billing period and the 
daily periodic rate for that feature, the result will be the FC assessed on that feature, except for variations caused by 
rouncfing. The total FC for the baling period is calculated by adding the FC assessed on al features of the Account. This 
method of calculating the Average Daily Balance and FC results in daily compounding of FC. The minimum 
FC for any billingferiod in which FC are imposed is $0.50.
