Managing a large team when they get all of their information about their manager from the web or 
launching a product when the press thinks they know you is all impossibly hard with bad 
"personal pr". 
The "sightings" are real. Just like the conference I signed up for this is what impacts negotiation. 
I do believe in sharing that with counsel which might be different between us. Both ways can 
work (or not). 
But the truth is people went straight to Steve and Steve went straight to brad. Just like how steve 
fired off panic mail after i signed up to speak at the conference. 
It was a "material" event. Samsung is, in Steve's words, "our new biggest competitor". 
Microsoft depends on hardware and only two companies that make hardware are executing--
apple and Samsung. Lenovo steals windows and all the others from hp to dell to asus are betting 
on android big. 
I don't think I have been flip flopping or erratic. I have been frustrated at jays lack of engagement 
after the New York meeting. I think this is just like your frustration with his worries. I have no 
worries not closing but dragging it out isn't good for anyone since everything that happens in 
public changes the negotiation. Even Windows Blue(next release) gives Steve more confidence he 
doesn't need to signs this. 
His second concern is me stealing people. That's why he wants a gag order. 
The only tool they have is money or suing me. Suing me is hard but hardly impossible. The only 
variable is that suing me means a deposition for Steve. But if they don't sue me then they have to 
sue everyone who leaves with me. That they don't prefer. 
I think: 
• $15m to me is fair and reasonable since it was comp i earned modulo the proxy bullshit which 
drops 125,000 or so shares. For negotiation more than happy to say "plus 5m cash". I don't care 
about the timeline. Id set up an automatic escrow account so I don't have to go back to them. 
• Not working at apple, google until 2014 is fine 
• Cooperating and not poaching is fine 
• The timeline doesn't matter so long as jay is driving and not letting brad stall. That's new since 
jay is dragging now. 
I can say yes to Samsung with an agreement. If we don't have an agreement I will get sued going 
to Samsung. They know it and i know it. If not then tell me why not? 
I think they should agree not to sue other microsoft people who leave to the same company as 
me. That's new. That's added because of the way they structured the gag order. If I can't talk to 
them about stuff then i can't be recruiting them. If i go to Samsung they can't now declare that a 
competitor because of me. People can quit and join other companies.
