The Atlanta Journal-Constitution (03/04, Bunch) reported that a handful of senior employees in Atlanta's Office of 
the Inspector General on Monday sent a five-page letter to federal and state authorities, along with city officials, 
referring eight criminal investigations launched by the government watchdog office in 2023 and 2024. The OIG staff

FBI Files Shed Some Light on Shanquella Robinson Investigation 
WSOC (ABC-9) (03/04, Bruno) reported that the FBI is starting to release files in response to multiple Freedom of 
Information Act requests by the reporting outlet dating back to 2023. The FBI released two parts of documents 
related to the Shanquella Robinson investigation. The agency is continuing to search for responsive records and 
more may be released in the coming months. The article mentioned that Shanquella Robinson went to Cabo, 
Mexico, in 2022 with six people she considered friends. She never returned home. Her father says her travel-mates 
told him she died of alcohol poisoning. An autopsy in Mexico claimed she died of neck and spinal cord injuries. A 
video also surfaced of Robinson being attacked by someone on the trip. The article noted that about a month after 
she died, FBI records show they spoke to a person, whose name was redacted from the file, who referenced that 
fight and said, "They aren't sure what happened." But the unknown person claimed Robinson's friends said she was 
drinking and "hit her head on the toilet." The documents say the person also told investigators they saw pictures of 
Robinson's body and said, "There are bruises on her and she looks like she was stomped on." The person also 
believed there were cameras in the house. A lot of the information is still being protected by the FBI and was 
redacted in the files. That includes interviews with people who said they had information about the case and social 
media accounts associated with her travel-mates. The FBI kept track of all of their social media accounts from 
Dropbox to Twitter. The article added that the FBI files say agents searched Robinson's phone. What they found in 
the phone is redacted. The files also state that in November 2022, authorities in Mexico told the FBI they needed to 
interview someone on the trip so they could get a temporary detention order. Mexican prosecutors eventually 
would issue an arrest warrant, but no one was ever extradited. The Robinson family is suing all of the travel-mates, 
including the person they say is seen hitting Robinson in the video. Court records show she changed her name and 
now lives in Connecticut.
