Unclear.The top end of the London market is currently strong because the city is seen as a safe haven against 
trouble in the middle east. But I don't think Candy & Candy are selling much of their Number One Knightsbridge 
development. Similarly I bought my pussy cat a flat in a fabulous new development in Bangkok, the Sukothai residence, 
behind the Sukothai hotel. It cost £1.5m which is a lot for Thailand and I believe sales are sluggish at best. I don't know 
how strong the market is in Rio, what the local factors are etc. I speculate there's quite a lot of wait and see at the top 
end of global residential property markets. 
3. What's best practice for financing a property purchase? 
Well obviously buying for cash is best, but if you can't do this I'd be very wary about borrowing more than 50% 
as a point of principle. You then need to work out in detail how the financing is going to work. What are the monthly 
interest payments? What happens if unforseen circumstances reduce your income? By how much does your income 
have to reduce to threaten the payments? What's the sensitivity to UK interest rate rises and currency fluctuations? 
(Sterling depreciated by 25% against the baht as I was making the stage payments for the Cat making the property about 
£250,000 more expensive). What's the plan for re-paying the capital? What's the absolute downside in security terms? 
le can the lending bank foreclose on other assets and what would be the effect of this? 
It's also necessary to be absolutely clear about total costs - ie, taxes on purchase, agents costs, total realistic 
refurbishment costs, including contingency, on going taxes, service charge and other running costs. These then need to 
be bundled into a composite number and the financing flows from this. 
So say in the case of the flat you're looking at the purchase price is £1.7m, and you're all in for £2m. (This feels 
low but I'm just using it for example). Let's say you put up E500,000 cash and go to HSBC for £1.5m, you then need to 
run all the sensitivities I've referred to above based on this. It feels like quite a committment. 
Again, you must take other advice and make up your own mind, but you've seen what happens when people 
over extend their borrowings against property. That's why, irrespective of the attractiveness of the property and the 
apparent security of your current income, I always follow the 50/50 rule of thumb, and even then the detailed financing 
battle drill needs to be performed. 
I hope this is helpful. Call if you'd like. Big kiss.
