toler=ted. And to Ted Cruz, Rand Paul and other Monday Morning Quarterbacks who only point out the problems 
without offering any solutions. Shame on you.... 
When BlackBerry Reigned (the Queen Got One!), and How It Fell 
Coming from a tiny Canadia= company, it was an almost absurdly audacious proposition. In 1998, when many 
corporations were leery =f e-mail, Research in Motion began selling the idea of sending it wirelessly through a device 
that ran on a single AA battery. But thanks to a tiny, yet effective, keyboard that brought the world thumb-typing and a 
network that ensured security, BlackBerrys became standard equipment on Wall Street and =n Washington. 
While BlackBerry, as the c=mpany is now known, created and dominated what became the smartphone market, 
competitors, notably Palm, fai=ed. But the company's co-chief executives missed the real threat: they initia=ly dismissed 
Apple's iPhone as little more than a toy. 
After that, al= their efforts were too late. On Friday, BlackBerry reported a $965 million loss, and BlackBerry's future 
now appe=rs to rest with a bargain-basement, highly conditional offer from its largest shareholder, Fairfax Financial. 
Whatever happens to the company, many expec= that BlackBerry smartphones are now destined to become relics.

A=ter 15 years, I chose to abandon my Blackberry and moved over to a =span style="line-height:17px;font-
family:Georgia,serif">Samsung Galaxy 54 only =o find out that I was not alone. But then I started with a Motorola Brirk 
and moved onto Nokia which I abandon to go with Blackberry. I still u=e a unlocked Motorola Filp-Phone as a second 
travel phone internationally =nd when someone develops a real world phone with reasonable tariffs, my Samsung w=II 
become obsolete and a relic as well.... Blackberry forgot the most=important rule in Silicon Valley, "make yourself 
obsolete before=someone else does."

As many of you know,=I am also a huge fan of Bill Moyers and last week on Moyers & Company, in an essay following his 
=onversation with Greenpeace International's Kumi Naidoo, Bill Moyers links Naidoo's cour=ge in speaking truth to 
power with an account of the recent visit by Pope Francis=to Sardinia, the Mediterranean island known for its beautiful 
beaches and pala=ial homes owned by the richest of the rich. Sardinia is now blighted by widespr=ad joblessness — 51 
percent of its young people are out of work — an= as the pope heard the stories of desperation and deprivation, he 
threw away=his prepared speech and decried a global economic system "that does us so =uch harm." The story leads 
Bill to conclude that unless we "dethr=ne our present system of financial capitalism that rewards those at the top" while 
e=eryone else is struggling, "it will consume us" and democracy will be f=nished. 
BILL MOYERS: When Kumi Naidoo's mother urged him to see God in the eyes of every human being that you meet, she 
was echoing a sentiment once expressed by Saint Ignatius of Loyola, who told the devout to "se=k and find God in all 
things." You may recall that Ignatius founded the=Jesuits, and now there is a Jesuit pope, the first in Catholic Church 
history.
