I am writing to see if you can put me in touch with one of your FBI agents. 
appears to be receiving threats. 
Here's the situation. 
now resides in Penrose, Colorado. Yesterday she went to the WalMart there and was followed 
by a dozen members of the British media. She had to call WalMart security just to get out of the store. 
When she, her husband, and kids returned to their home, they found the backdoor to their home had been left open. 
They had been taking high securLprecautions, so that seemed very unusual. Brad and I believe that this may be Epstein 
(or his associates) signaling that ■ should not talk.
