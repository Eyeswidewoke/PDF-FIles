even if we are unable to register or qualify the underlying securities 
for sale under all applicable state securities laws. 
If we call the warrants for redemption as described above, our 
management will have the option to require all holders that wish to 
exercise warrants to do so on a "cashless basis." In determining 
whether to require all holders to exercise their warrants on a "cashless 
basis." our management will consider, among other factors, our cash 
position, the number of warrants that are outstanding and the dilutive 
effect on our stockholders of issuing the maximum number of shares 
of common stock issuablc upon the exercise of our warrants. In such 
event, each holder would pay the exercise price by surrendering the 
warrants for that number of shares of common stock equal to the 
quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of shares 
of common stock underlying the warrants, multiplied by the 
difference between the exercise price of the warrants and the "fair 
market value" (defined below) by (y) the fair market value. The "fair 
market value" shall mean the average reported last sale price of the 
common stock for the 10 trading days ending on the third trading day 
prior to the date on which the notice of redemption is sent to the 
holders of warrants. Please se: the section entitled "Description of 
Securities—Warrants—Public Stockholders' Warrants" for 
additional information. 
None of the private placement warrants will be redeemable by us so 
long as they arc held by the initial purchasers of the private 
placement warrants or their permitted transferees.

determined by dividing the amount of cash contributed to the

decrease the size of the offering pursuant to Rule 462(b) under the 
Securities Act, we will effect a stock dividend or share contribution
