BOAMS 07-1 2Al2 is a Prime 6% coupon, senior su=port backed by prime jumbo 30yr fix mortgages with a weighted 
average coup=n of 6.38%. What does this mean? Essentially, =he bonds are backed by one of the most rate sensitive 
homeowners in the ma=ket. 76% of the homeowners have not missed a payment in the =ast 2 years, have a 749 avg 
FICO and have some degree of equity in t=eir homes (home price index updated LTV for this subset of borrowers=is 
94.07%). These are the type of borrowers that are looking to =efinance their current mortgages...this is evident in the 
pool's=historical speeds which have prepaid in the mid to high teens. =OA 
Base Case Scenario: This bond is a short duration bond paying 8.8% yiel= with a 2.47 duration. This is assuming 50% 
higher severitie= than 6 month averages, over 2.9x higher CDR prints than 6 month average=, and 20% slower speeds 
than 6 mos averages. 
=p class="MsoNormal">Stress Case Scenario= Assuming home lending tightens, p=operty values decline further and the 
current homeowners' cred=t undergoes significant deterioration, then we should expect prepay speeds=to slow down 
and defaults to ramp up. In our stress case scenario,=we assume 33% slower speeds vs 6 mos average, 3.1x higher 
default =ates vs 6 mos averages and 50% higher seventies vs 6 mos averages for lif= of the loans. In this scenario, we 
default and liquidate 19.6% =f the remaining pool. Bear in mind there are only 13.93% delinqu=nt loans to date. In this 
stress, this bond would yield 2=2E01% with a 2.44 durn. 
Recovery Case Scenario: In this scenario, we assume housing rec=vers (results in lower LTVs) and borrower's experience 
positiv= credit migration (i.e. credit scores improves due to continued perfor=ance). If this were to transpire, we'd 
expect prepay speeds =o ramp up as more borrower's would qualify to refinance and severiti=s on liquidations to 
decrease as property values increase. 1= this scenario, we assume similar prepay speeds to the 6 month average, 2=2E6x 
higher default rates vs 6 month average and 35% higher seventies tha= the 6 month average. To our recovery scenario, 
this bond is=a 16.42% yield at a 2.40 duration.
