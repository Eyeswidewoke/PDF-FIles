This course focuses on Gustave Flaubert's novel. Madame Bovary. We will examine the historical 
and literary contexts of this novel as well as a transcript of the trial that followed its publication. 
We will explore the range of critical responses the novel has inspired, including Baudelaire's 
reading of Flaubert. Reading this classic will allow us to revisit French literary history since 
Madame Bovary synthesizes and foreshadows much of French cultural discourse. Topics for 
discussion will include Flaubert's critique of 19th century French society, the history of medicine, 
fashion, women's education, gender politics, literary history, and media politics. We will ask how 
Madame Bovary challenges, in Flaubert's phrase. 'received ideas' and offers a social critique that 
Is still relevant today.

There is no one way to write compelling fiction, just as there are no formulas or tricks to help a 
young writer to do so. We will learn how to read as writers, which is the most critical aspect of this 
endeavor. We will learn how to recognize lazy or bad writing, cliches, etc. in each other's work and 
in our own. By the end of the term we will all become better editors of our own work. We will learn 
how to read established writers, analyze how they render objects and actions. In short, we will 
discuss all aspects of fiction writing. Where stories come from and how we put ourselves in what 
we write. that unique stamp only you can provide.

Credits: 4 
CRN 3231 Sec C 
This course is focused on the core of fiction writing the story. At once universal and perennially 
new, a compelling plot is a force of nature that structures our lives. During the semester writers do 
two difficult things: read and respond to masterful works of short fiction in order to understand the 
tricks (and inexplicable magic) of the trade: and compose stories, refining and revising them until 
they are undeniable. The class draws models from classic practitioners like Chekhov. O'Connor. 
and Nabokov and contemporary stylists like Russell Banks. Donald Barthelme. and Robert Atwood. 
It surveys plot design. character development, point of view. pacing and dramatic structure.
