I didn't get that at all from Susan. She said she just gave her the feedback she tells all the young actors that 
come into her. The whole auditioning process is brutal, its harsh, its filled with disappointment. All the actors revel 
in their success when the get it because its a very hard process. There is now way to guard from it and in order 
to get any part, she has to become accustomed to it. On the other hand... 
If I lived in new york, or if she was in Los Angeles, I could have done the fake version of an audition and gotten 
her on tape, but to what affect. If she worked with Susan and an acting coach she could work for me and others 
but the process I go through to get even the smallest part approved is multi layered so the actor that goes on 
tape has to nail it. 
When I got my own wife a small 6 line part on Bones years ago, she had do audition for the casting director, 
then read for the director, then producers, then her tape had to be approved by studio, and then network. The 
casting director was rude as her though she was the wrong 'type' and the director put her through her paces as 
well. 
Every acting teachers book or class talks about auditioning. I've been to classes where the students run out 
crying because of the teachers feedback. I've walked out into the hallway after auditions for my projects and 
often see an actor upset, crying, etc. 
I can set up the fake audition for her and have her loved on like crazy. The reason I set her up with Susan was to 
have Susan help her do as great a 'performance' as she had in her because I need a great tape to get her the 
part, and to get her noticed by my colleagues for other work on both shows, or other shows the studio has like 
Glee. 
Her audition for Enchanted was very green. Had she in the intervening years been to tons of classes or 
workshops I would have just had her tape at her acting teachers place and sent it in. This point I'm making brings 
to mind a girl who auditioned yesterday. She's 16. She's been in acting school for 7 years. She loves this part 
and she rehearsed it for a week with 2 different acting coaches and a scene partner. She was amazing, the beat 
of the day. Not to say she's not gifted, she is, but she was massively prepared. There are hundreds of girls at all 
ages, with thousands more behind her prepared like that, (although not all are gifted) and that's what I have to 
contend with when I want to get somebody a important part. 
I created what I thought was a process to succeed. I told Susan I would pay her rate plus to get 
up to 
speed to do a good performance that could be considered but all out here for now and the future. 
I've apologized to= and I'm reluctant to call 
directly. If you'd like me to kindly speak to her, apologize 
directly, I will do that. Also if you want me to set up another 'kind & gentle' audition I can easily do it. 
Again I'm sorry and will do anything to make amends. 
Best,
