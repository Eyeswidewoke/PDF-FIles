Rabin knew that the=German government in Bonn had introduced new "political principles&qu=t; for arms exports in 
1982. According to the new policy, arms shipments c=uld "not contribute to an increase in existing tensions." This 
malleable wording made possible the delivery of subma=ines to Israel, especially in combination with a famous remark 
once made b= former Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher: "Anything that float= is OK" -- because governments 
generally do not use boats to oppress demonstrators or opposition forces. 
After World War ll,=the Allies had initially forbidden Germany from building large submarines.=As a result, the chief 
supplier to the German navy, Howaldtswerke-Deutsche=Werft AG (HDW), located in the northern port city of Kiel, had 
shifted its focus to small, maneuverable boats that=could also operate in the Baltic and North Seas. The Israelis were 
interes=ed in ships that could navigate in similarly shallow waters, such as those=along the Lebanese coast, where they 
have to be able to lie at periscope depth, listen in on radio communi=ations and compare the sounds of ship's propellers 
with an onboard databas=. The Israelis obtained bids from the United States, Great Britain and the=Netherlands, but 
"the German boats were the best," says an Israeli who was involved in the decision. 
A few weeks after t=e fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the German government, practically unno=iced by the general 
public, gave the green light for the construction of t=o "Dolphin"-class submarines, with an option for a third vessel. 
But the strategic d=al of the century almost fell through. Although the Germans had agreed to =ay part of the costs, this 
explicitly excluded the weapons systems -- the =mericans were supposed to also pay a share. But in the meantime, the 
Israelis had voted a new government into=office that was bitterly divided over the investments. 
'An Inconceivable S=enario' 
In particular Moshe=Arens, who was appointed defense minister in 1990, fought to stop the agre=ment -- with success. 
On Nov. 30, 1990, the Israelis notified the shipyard=in Kiel that it wished to withdraw from the contract. 
Was the dream of nu=lear second-strike capability lost? By no means. 
In January 1991, th= US air force attacked Iraq, and then Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein reacte= by firing modified Scud 
missiles at Tel Aviv and Haifa. The bombardment l=sted almost six weeks. Gas masks, some of which came from 
Germany, were distributed to households. "It was a= inconceivable scenario," recalls Ehud Barak, the current Israeli 
def=nse minister. During those days, Jewish immigrants from Russia arrived, &q=ot;and we had to hand them gas masks 
at the airport to protect them against rockets that the Iraqis had built with the help of=the Russians and the Germans." 
A few days after th= Scud missile bombardment began, a German military official requested a me=ting at the 
Chancellery, presented a secret report and emptied the content= of a bag onto a table. He spread out dozens of 
electronic parts, components of a control system and the percuss=on fuse of the modified Scud missiles. They had one 
thing in common: They =ere made in Germany. Without German technology there would have been no Sc=ds, and 
without Scuds no dead Israelis. 
Once again, Germany=bore some of the responsibility, and that was also the message that Hanan =Ion, a senior Israeli 
Defense Ministry official, brought to Kohl during a =isit to Bonn shortly after the war began. "It would be unpleasant if it 
came out, through the media, tha= Germany helped Iraq to make poison gas, and then supplied us with the equ=pment 
against it, Mr. Chancellor," Alon said. According to Israeli of=icials, Alon also issued an open threat, saying: "You are 
certainly aware that the words gas and Germany don't=sound very good together." 
The Shipyards of Ki=l 
The Germans got the=message. "Israel-Germany-gas" would sound like a "horrible =riad" in the rest of the world, then 
Foreign Minister Genscher warned=in an internal memo.
