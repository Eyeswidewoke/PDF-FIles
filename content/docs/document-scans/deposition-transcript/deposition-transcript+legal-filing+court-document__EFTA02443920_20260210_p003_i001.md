New Business 
(a) 
Bright's Creek — After approximately 9 months of negotiations, it appears that we 
will sign a contract this week for the purchase of 5,000 acres of the Bright's Creek 
community. This community is the highest quality, mountain, residential resort I 
have seen. For the last month and until the contract is closed, modified or 
amended, Chris Cole and Troy Miller are living on-site and with the permission of 
the owners, have been involved in management of the community. 
Steve Manolis has been spending approximately half of his time marketing or 
preparing to market this contract to an investor and is extremely frustrated that the 
owners have limited his time for marketing to the end of April. Steve has talked 
to the Durst Organization and two REITs — Vornado and Rockwood, among 
others. My thought is that if the contract is closed, it will be done on a modified 
contract and if it is not closed. Landmark may have a strange opportunity. The 
opportunity is that the owners, two successful agricultural gentlemen from South 
Carolina, built Bright's Creek because of their passion for quality and their 
passion for golf. With cost overruns and a fading market, they ran off their 
developer and have been operating the course with no leadership and simply 
withstanding the operational loss of $10,000 per day. They now have grown tired 
of that loss and, if Steve does not succeed in finding money to buy them out, their 
options will be to continue to bear the burden of the loss, to find someone else to 
work with to bear the loss and through active management diminish the loss, or to 
close it down, which would result in a very messy court battle between them and 
the 300+ lot owners and 200+ members. There are approximately 30 houses built 
and a little over 20 occupied. The owncrs have great faith in Landmark. They 
have visited Apes Hill in Barbados and if Landmark could find a little money, I 
believe we could raise the rest of it from the very affluent lot owners and 
members that already have a vested interest. This bootstrap option would only 
exist if Steve failed in his efforts. It would be both foolish and disloyal for us not 
to support Steve in his effort 100%, but it would also be foolish not to have a fire 
and fallback position after our substantial expenditure of time. 
Looking forward to seeing you at the Board meeting. I believe you will love 
Bright's Creek. 
(b) 
St. Lucia — In this case it seems to me that history is circular, not linear, and the 
beat goes on. After Scotia Bank first agreed to, and then reversed their position 
based on the participation of the National Insurance Company of St. Lucia in 
financing this project, William Hutchinson met with the Prime Minister and the 
chairman of the insurance company and, he believes, persuaded them to increase 
their investment from $10,000,000 to $13,000,000 and restructure the finance in a 
way that would be agreeable to Scotia Bank. It is my understanding that the 
National Insurance Company of St. Lucia will meet on March 9ih (one week from 
today) and it is also my understanding that this item is on the agenda.
