argues, the Parole Commission exceeded its lawful authority by imposing a condition on him that 
required him to violate state law. 
This argument, however, rests on the faulty premise that only those who are required to register 
are lawfully able to register. Maryland law creates a sex offender registry in which Kennedy can 
register even if we were to assume, for purposes of argument, that Maryland law does not of its 
own force require him to register. Although he contends that the failure of Maryland law to 
require him to register operates as a prohibition on registering, Kennedy has cited to no 
provision of Maryland law wherein this prohibition can be found. Because Maryland, like all 
states, has a sex offender registry in place, the Parole Commission was acting within its 
discretion when it required him to register in that registry pursuant to SORNA. This conclusion 
is made plain by the fact that Kennedy currently is registered in Maryland, which should put to 
rest any concern that his registration would be rejected by the State of Maryland even though 
required by the U.S. Parole Commission and SORNA.

Finally, Kennedy argues that the Parole Commission's order was unreasonable because it "violated 
the Tenth Amendment by commandeering the State of Maryland to register Mr. Kennedy in 
violation of its own state law." In making this argument, Kennedy repeats the argument, rejected 
above, that because he was not required to register as a sex offender in Maryland, Maryland law 
prohibited him from registering. He also argues that even if it were possible for him to register in 
Maryland's sex offender registry without violating Maryland law, the special parole condition 
and SORNA unconstitutionally commandeered Maryland state officials by requiring them to 
register an individual they otherwise would not have. 
While it is true that in Printz v. United States, 521 U.S. 898, 935 (1997), the Supreme Court 
made clear that the Tenth Amendment prohibits the federal government from commandeering 
state officers by compelling them to enforce a federal regulatory program, Kennedy has not 
demonstrated that the order requiring him to register as a condition of parole undertakes to 
obligate the State of Maryland or the Sheriff of Wicomico County to accept his registration. To 
the contrary, the condition commands only Kennedy, directing him to report to the Sheriffs 
Office and register. Moreover, when, in 2004, prior to the enactment of SORNA, Kennedy 
attempted to register pursuant to a directive from Officer Altera, the Wicomico County Sheriffs 
Office declined to register him because it concluded that Maryland law did not require him to 
register. While the Wicomico County Sheriffs Office did later, in 2008, accept Kennedy's 
registration, it did not do so because of any command in the special parole condition. 
Similarly, Kennedy has not shown that SORNA "commandeers" the State of Maryland in 
violation of the Tenth Amendment. While SORNA does order that "a sex offender shall register, 
and keep the registration current" in each jurisdiction with which he has contact, 42 U.S.C. § 
16913(a), nowhere does it require that the States comply with its directives. Rather, SORNA 
gives the States a choice, indicating that "a jurisdiction that fails . to substantially implement 
[SORNA] shall not receive 10 percent of the funds that would otherwise be allocated" to the 
jurisdiction for federal criminal justice assistance. Id. § I6925(a); see also 72 Fed.Reg. at 8895 ( 
"The SORNA provisions cast as directions to jurisdictions and their officials are, in relation to 
the states, only conditions required to avoid [a] funding reduction"). Thus, while SORNA
