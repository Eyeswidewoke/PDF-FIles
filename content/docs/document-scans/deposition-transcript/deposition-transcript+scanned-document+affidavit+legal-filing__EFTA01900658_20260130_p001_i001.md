Re: Thanks 
The Cage concert is both a good and bad example. Check in contrast the impact of 
the parallel programs in the previous years on Henry Cowell and Walter Piston. 
It would not have worked as you suggest--a lecture demo, and would have cost the 
same. The three pieces by Cage--two of which were premieres in the US--had to be 
seen and heard; they are performance arts. You are also wrong about audiences. 
Many concert goers do not like lectures and never go; some can't and won't make 
it. And we did the Cage because Bard is the home of the Cage Archive, a gift of 
Merce Cunningham. Otherwise I would have skipped the idea. 
I have the sense of fighting my worst enemies in a a shadow way, not openly, and 
I surely have them. I am not struggling--I am struggling for the primary source 
of survival in music history for large ensembles--patronage. And you once asked a 
question of me. The answer is that I wish to work on the podium, to perform and 
the continue to fight--if one odes not work one dies inside--and I am sure many 
many in the profession would validate the need and the accomplishment. Ask 
Emmanuel Ax, for example of the members of the Emerson Quartet. 
Shrugging off arguments in my line of work is only possible when you have an 
endowment or like Stokowski, Munch , Leinsdorf and Koussevitzky, you married 
money.

academically correct, auction metaphor related to ultimate value, 
new fossil 
record changes history, explains and possibly connects, destroys closely held 
beliefs. I have searched for the impact of the cage performances. it was not 
undiscovered , it had miniscule impact, and would have been as effective as a 
lecture with a small demo. ./ II want you to win, it would be easy to just shrug 
your argumnets off. There is a reason you are still struggling and it is not your 
talent. . the people that come an hour early to listen , are your audience, the 
others are inside to get warm.

I agree that something not acknowledged as a treasure needs to be evaluated. But 
the auction house metaphor does not quite work--for reasons of actual as well as 
perceived value, speculation, collection madness, exclusive ownership. What is 
relevant is the re-emergence of music in new contexts, so that the evaluation 
reveals itself in part in influence (e.g. forms of neo-classicism). Also I am 
interested in the evolution of musical meaning, and treasures are not the only 
purpose of the endeavor. Remember your own enjoyment at listening to 
Herzogenberg.
