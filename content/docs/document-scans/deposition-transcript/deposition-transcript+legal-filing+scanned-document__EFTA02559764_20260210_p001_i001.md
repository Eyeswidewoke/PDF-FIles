The Girl Who Rode The Rocking Horse 
Wall Street Journal, September 1, 2012 
By Edward Jay Epstein 
When military police arrived at the Fort Bragg, N.C., home of Capt. =effrey MacDonald at 3:50 a.m. on Feb. 17, 1970, 
they found a bloody =assacre. The captain himself, a 27-year-old military doctor, had =ultiple wounds, including stab 
wounds in his stomach and chest. His =ife, Colette, 27, and their two daughters-3 and 5 years old—had =een beaten 
and stabbed to death. The word "Pig" was scrawled in =food on a wall. The police saw signs of a struggle, including a 
table =tanding on end, torn and bloody clothing, and a paring knife, icepick =nd club. After MacDonald was revived 
through mouth-to-mouth =esuscitation, he described an attack by four intruders: three men and = blond woman who 
wore a floppy hat. 
To the crime's investigators, the murder scene was open to two =nterpretations. First, home invaders had carried out 
the slaughter, as =acDonald claimed. Second, MacDonald had murdered his wife and =aughters and staged the 
appearance of a home invasion by upsetting =urniture, throwing objects around and inflicting deep wounds on =imself. 
The first scenario had a well-publicized precedent in the home =nvasions of the "Manson family"—two incidents, 
instigated by =harles Manson, in which seven people were murdered and the word =93pig" was scrawled on a wall. The 
incidents had occurred just six =onths earlier in Los Angeles. Fort Bragg was an open base, making it =ossible for a band 
of intruders to enter the base and break into the =acDonald home. 
But investigators did not buy the home-invasion scenario. To them, the =usband's guilt seemed more plausible. For one 
thing, husbands are =tatistically the most likely perpetrators of spousal murders, having =eans and opportunity and, if 
there is marital conflict, motive. ((On =his logic, Roman Polanski, the husband of Manson-victim Sharon Tate, =ould 
have been a suspect if he had not been in London shooting a =ovie at the time of that home invasion.) 
There is a forensic problem, however, with husbands as suspects. Their =ingerprints, blood, hair and clothing fibers are 
not in themselves =ncriminating because, whether a man is innocent or guilty, the same =races of his presence will be 
found in the home. In a case like =acDonald's, where there are no witnesses, signs of staging a =rime—i.e., faking up the 
crime scene—become evidence of guilt. 
Military prosecutors got the ball rolling in May 1970 by presenting a =ase—in what is called, in the military, an Article 32 
hearing—that =acDonald had indeed staged the scene of the crime, to cover up the =urder of his family. The prosecutors 
never did present a motive: There =as no apparent estrangement between MacDonald and his wife, and no =ucrative 
insurance policy. The presiding officer in the hearing, Col. =arren V. Rock, dismissed the case for lack of evidence. 
Then, in 1975, after MacDonald had re-entered civilian life, he was =ndicted by a federal grand jury, partly as the result 
of the efforts =f his wife's father, who had agitated continually for a civilian =rial, convinced of his son-in-law's guilt. A 
four-year delay =ollowed to adjudicate Mac0onald's claims of double jeopardy. =inally, on Aug. 29, 1979, he was 
convicted of first-degree murder and =entenced to life imprisonment. He is in prison to this day.
