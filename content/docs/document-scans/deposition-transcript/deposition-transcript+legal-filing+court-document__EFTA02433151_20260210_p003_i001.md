gives in because the" girlfriend " strikes in him a "sensitive chord." We 
can say that she makes a chord vibrate which he do not wish to feel 
vibrating. So he does what he needs to do in order to cease the vibration. 
This sensitive chord is generally an unpleasant emotion, or an unwanted 
consequence. 
He gives in to prevent from living through something that he judges worse 
than the complaining itself. 
Examples: 
* It's easier for me to give in to my girlfriends nagging than bear through 
her tantrum, so I give her what she wants. 
* It's less intolerable for me to claim that I didn't really believe what I said 
(even if I'm lying in saying that) than to bear through her sulking. 
• It hurts me to see her so unhappy and I know she'll never do anything to 
improve her situation. I take it upon myself to solve her problem even if I 
very well know that she only doesn't do it herself because she's just lazy. 
Giving in is pointless, because the only consequence will be that the "giving in" will 
become a reflex, then an automatism (in the same way that obedience does, as I 
discussed in my entry on the obedience circuit). It is an unwinnable situation. 
Breaking out of her game is not by being a better manipulator (with all the corruption 
that this entails), but rather by exposing it and dashing it as violently as one can. 
Only then can one be set free from it.

my suggestion 1 ask yourself.. could I be wrong and jeffrey right? , if the answer is 
no, that should tell you something. i.e. you are holding a false idea. 2. on one hand 
you don't want to be compared with others, and then you say but you don;t criticize 
others for the same things that I do. 3. ask yourself, when jeffrey is having fun, how 
do you feel. why i am not there? , I can do what she does? he is ridiculous. if i were 
to do that ..., how about I'm really glad he is having fun ,.4. you have let your body 
get out of shape. though i have encouraged excercise, you tell me you are having 
your period, it only works if you do it 2 or 3 times a week, i had no time, I did it. .. 
then though you do a lubo job at it, you tell me i make you feel insecure about it. 5. I 
told you that it would be difficult for an outsider to accept my behavior. less than 10% 
. You. believe that same person will ,when told about your lifestyle,  will side with 
you , and say well it appears that you do so much, and try so hard, I believe you get 
the short end of the stick. 6. You refuse to accept responsibility for your actions. I'm 
sorry it won't happen again. „, no 0-0you attempt to justify it. - I tasted it , and it was 
good, noyou should have known. IF someone else did it you would n't complain, . 7. 
did you thank jenn for trying to teach you. no, did you make her feel welcome, no, did
