stretching from 2010 into 2018 and faulted him for evasive, stalling tactics that helped him 
skirt more serious violations." The Washington Post (7/30, Sonmez, 14.2M) says "the news 
deals a blow to the reelection campaign of Schweikert," who "is running unopposed in next 
week's Republican primary in Arizona's 6th District" but faces "four candidates...seeking the 
Democratic nomination to face him in November; among them, Hiral Tipirneni had a $1 million 
cash-on-hand advantage over Schweikert as of mid-July." 
The Hill (7/30, Marcos, 2.98M) recounts that "an investigative report released by the 
Ethics Committee concluded that Schweikert, who has served in the House since 2011, violated 
campaign finance laws, misused taxpayer funds for unofficial purposes, pressured congressional 
office staff to do campaign work and displayed a `lack of candor during the investigation.' CQ 
Roll Call (7/30, Marquette, 154K)indicates "the Ethics Committee plans to bring a privileged 
resolution to reprimand the Arizona Republican for a full House vote," and "Schweikert must 
repay the Treasury by Oct. 30." 
Politico (7/30, Ferris, 4.29M) reports, "Among the biggest findings from the Ethics panel is 
that Schweikert had paid over $270,000 to a firm whose sole employee is Schwab over seven 
years, violating the limit on outside income for senior congressional aides." Schwab "left his 
congressional job in 2018 after seven years. That same year, the aide also repaid the campaign 
more than $50,000." 
Ginsburg Resting In Hospital Following Minimally Invasive Surgery. 
The CBS Evening NewsVi (7/30, story 9, 0:15, O'Donnell, 4.19M) reported that following 
"minimally invasive, nonsurgical procedure on a bile duct stent she received last year," Supreme 
Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg "is resting in a New York hospital." She "is expected to be 
released by the end of the week." 
NASA's Perseverance Rover Lifts Off En Route To Mars. 
The New York Times (7/30, Chang, 18.61M) reports NASA's Perseverance rover lifted off 
Thursday morning on its way to Mars, making it "the third spacecraft to head that way this 
month." The "robotic wheeled vehicle [is] designed to look for signs of past life on Mars." Its 
destination "is a crater, Jezero, which was once a lake in the northern hemisphere of Mars. 
Scientists believe it is a promising location where signs of ancient Martian life could be 
preserved if life ever existed on Mars." The Washington Post (7/30, Achenbach, 14.2M) says 
Perseverance "is supposed to obtain samples of rock cores and soil that could later be sent back 
to Earth for study in laboratories." Its mission "is the first leg of what is known as the Mars 
Sample Return campaign." 
NASA Administrator Bridenstine said on the Weather ChannelVi (7/30, 107K), "We are in 
fact looking for signs of ancient life on Mars. ... This is the most sophisticated robot we've ever 
launched. From past missions, we have learned that Mars was at one time, it had an ocean, it 
had liquid water. The northern hemisphere of Mars was covered in liquid ocean. About two-
thirds of it was covered in ocean, We know that it had a thick atmosphere, and, of course, very 
dynamic weather events. And it had a magnetosphere that protected it from the radiation deep 
space. In other words, Mars was habitable. The question that we are trying to answer now, for 
the first time is was it inhabited? are we going to find signs, biosignatures of ancient life on 
Mars?" Bridenstine was also interviewed on Fox News' The Story (7/30) and KOTV-TVVi Tulsa, 
OK (7/30, 24K). 
NASA Deputy Administrator James Morhard said on Bloomberg TVVi (7/30, 4.73M), "We 
are so excited because this is the dawn of a new space age. ... It is a precursor mission in 
anticipation of astronauts going to Mars. The President has told us to get to moon in 
preparation to do that but also, ultimately, we have to get to Mars. This rover is gong to be 
there picking up samples that we are going return on another mission, back to the Earth."
