your uncle wanted to speak again =oday. I will be flying to new york. I can be reach=d after 1 pm. please transmit to 
him the following 
Sheik Hamad., 
It was fun talking =o you. Im sure I would also enjoy talking houses ,=planes and life. re: how to take financial 
advantage of the =AO dramatic future movement of world currencies , I would make=the following suggestions . 1 , 
When you have a fe= hours,or as much time as you would like to devote - I, as you=might know, used to teach this 
subject as well as physics . I would =e happy to share my knowledge on the subject . When explained well, it bec=mes 
obvious. 2. We live in a different world then our parents = grand parents and their parents. The Art of Money 
today=making is a more complex. task. Investments need to be ,=reported and structured with a view toward 
currencies, taxes. asset =rotection. , liquidity and political risk. Value comes in many forms= a) family history , b) 
ownership) c ) control. =A0 I would argue that the most valuable thing today , unlike i= the past , where it was family 
name, then , amoun= of land owned. then number if co.s owned or controlled.=C2 
today ,the most valuable asset you have is your INFO=MATION , combined with your vast experience and insight. 
<=cliv> Why try to guess, along with mthe multitiude of others, t=at also guess , when the euro is at its low. and then 
consider=holding for ten years . Why try to merely guess when Russia will sta=lize, . Why try to guess alongside every 
other player in the f=nancial community . You , respectfully have a better feel than=most for when uncertainty is 
about to hit, how far and for how long =C2 Your personal political experience is unique, it s=ould not be seperate from 
your financial life, it should be at its c=re. For ex. the insight that Europe is very unlikely to become=successful in the 
next three years. has true , significant value, =AO asset allocation should it today's world mean taking advantag= of 
declines. not only trying to buy at the lowest price hoping the =rice would go up. ( the only way for our grandparents 
to make money=. The entire Rothschild Fortune , a history I am intimately familiar=with, was based on Nathan 
Rothschild knowing that Napoleon was losing at W=terloo . You and I sharing intuitions would be enjoyable. 
=/div> I thought I should be very clear. I do=not manage money for others nor do I have any type of a fund . I am =ot 
a financial merchant. I make money using my own money. on t=ings I enjoy, complex problems and their structures
not unlike rea= physics ) . I would gladly talk to the person you suggested and sha=e my views. He may call me in New 
York today, labor has the number. =br> My travel takes me to Europe often. I would lo=k forward to meeting you 
either Xmas time in Carib or Cuba or=C2 before in Doha if your schedule permits. Xmas , being no= a holiday either 
one of us truly celebrates.

footnote : In the mid 801=;s I was privileged to have a sit down with King Fand, I told him I =hought it strange that he 
was asking a Jew for a financial opinion. ( i.e.=C2 would Europe combine into one currency?) . He smiled a l=ttle smile 
and told me , it had always been true that money and finance wa= like many clouds, difficult to see through , but if you 
spent enoug= time the clouds would part , and there in the center you would find=a Jew. we laughed - Oil was under 
10 dollars a barrel .
