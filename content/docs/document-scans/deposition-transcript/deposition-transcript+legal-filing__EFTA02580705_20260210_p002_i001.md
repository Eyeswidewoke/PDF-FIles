Style for me is fi=st and foremost elegance, . To me, elegance consists not only in what you wear, but also in how you 
present yourself, how you =ake part in a conversation, and in what drives and inspires you as a= individual in society. I 
personally believe that an elegant woman =AO should not catch your attention right away when =he walks into the 
room . She should makes an impression gradually, step by=20 step to control her presence. In an analogy, very few 
people want =AO to know the end of the book if its first chapter is not interesting. ? 
You =re a successful model and have worked on many shows. Which one has made th= biggest impression on you? 
The Fendi show at The Cannes Palace of Festivals in front of thousands of spectators was probably the most interesting 
and inspiring in my career. The Palacemade a magical impression on me. And the Diesel show in Milan turned out to be 
the most fun of them all. One the brand executives, Andrea Rosso, was al-ing as we models were encouraged to move 
as we pleased on the runway, which included dancing. 
How have you come up with an idea of starting our own nonprofit organization? Please tell us about the mission of your 
foundation?c/=> 
I started working in the not-for-profit sector several years ago, when I had just moved to New York. I helped organize 
and coordinate differen= volunteer programs, including recruitment,=span style="font-family:".SFUIText";font-
size:17pt"> and fundraising for needy areas of food scarcity. I was not focused on any one particular foundation byt 
preferred to explore different role= in the sector. 
The turning point happened during one of my trips to West Africa where I found that for as little as 100 dollars a year it 
is was possible to change a child's life. ie paying his college=tuition. Thanks to my family, I have valued education since 
my early childhood (my Father has a Doctoral Degree and my Mother had to stop working on her Doctoral thesis only 
because of the obligations of motherhood; all of my grandparents were doctors, and one of my grandfathers was the 
Distinguished Ssurgeon of the Russian Federation). I was overwhelmed when I won the merit-based state tuition to 
study at Moscow State University of International Relations and even got the high monthly payments from the state for 
the excellent grades (in the Russian educational systems students studying on the state tuition can get additional 
monthly payments as long as they get high grades, the amounts may vary based on the grades). Yet only recently did I 
come to a realization how lucky I had been with my education and what a critical part it plays in my life. 
Therefore, I decided to pursue my future career in the education space. In 2016, I founded Education Advance aimed at 
promoting STEM education and increasing diversity in the STEM field (STEM stands for Science, Technology, Engineering, 
and Mathematics). I believe that these industries are, and will continue to be the main source of innovations in the 
world. 
What=are you future plans and goals?
