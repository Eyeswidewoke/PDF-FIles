that you informed us of, and regarding which I await w=itten documentation from Bainco when they provide the 
materials I have requested. 
VC: There are three IRA ac=ounts, according to the IRA/ESA Distribution Request Forms that Bainco has=been 
sending us along the years, as I mentioned above in this letter.=l would like if you could check on this. 
As I also explained to Avi, years ago when the estate was planned, the=prime concern of the lawyers was 
avoiding estate taxes. The investme=ts were assigned to trusts in Mommy's name, since we assumed that I would die 
first. The intention of course was=that the money would be available to the survivor, but things did not work=out as we 
had anticipated and now, as the trusts are written, it seems tha= I have no access to them. DPQ: This is not 
entirely=accurate as Noam is the income beneficiary of these trusts and must receiv= all the net income annually, and he 
is also entitled to principal distrib=tions as the trustees "consider advisable". At my death, the estate goes to you. DPQ: 
Carol's t=usts are left to the children at Noam's death. Except for th= small amount of assets currently in Noam's 
revocable trust (we wi=l be updating this trust after we meet in March), Noam's estate is left to Valer=a under the terms 
of his new will and pursuant to the beneficiary designat=on of the large IRA at Bainco which I am awaiting 
documentation to confirm= The term "estate" references the totality of a decedent's assets so the balance of Carol's 
estate, i=e. the Marital Trusts, go to the children, but Noam's estate does =ot. 
VC: We hav= not been informed that Noam has been receiving ANY of the Trusts net inco=e nor principal 
distributions. 
That leaves us with the IRA. I did not realize this, but though =ainco was aware that the IRA was my only source 
of funds, and was of cours= diminishing, they continued to make distributions to ten family recipients. We were also 
paying almost $50,000 a year =or Wellfleet, and paying other expenses, like= 
medical bills. =AO It seems that we 
were also paying taxes for the entire estate. DPQ: I think Noam is referring to Carol's Marital Trusts here. Am I correct? 
=AO 
VC: No, Deborah. The money for all this has been com in= from distributions from the IRA (and most of it, if not 
ALL, from the one=Noam has designated me as the beneficiary). 
Just to give yo= an idea of the scale, there is an automatic $300,000 deduction a year fro= the IRA. DPQ: In =he 
interest of being accurate the Minimum Required Distribution changes so=ewhat each year depending on market 
fluctuations and Noam's age. T=is is not a deduction from the IRA, rather, this is the minimum distributi=n to Noam as 
required under our tax laws. This is perhaps just a semantic =oint. 
Distributions and taxes come close to the total 
deduction from the IRA, and other expens=s of the kind just mentioned (plus Anthony) carry expenses well beyond 
the=funds coming in. 
VC: Although a requirement under the tax laws,=the distributions (withdrawals) from the IRA were being used 
for donations=to family members and other expenses that we should not be responsibl= for, considering that the IRA is 
the only stable source of money lef= for Noam. 
<=pan style="color:black"> 
Plainly, we cannot continue any of this while living on a diminishing IFtA.=C2 I did request that a marital trust 
pay the taxes on the IRA, but Har=y insisted on conditions that I could not possibly accept, and I was very =urprised, 
frankly, that any conditions were even considered. Perhaps that had to do with the serious miscon=eptions about our 
expenses, whatever their source.
