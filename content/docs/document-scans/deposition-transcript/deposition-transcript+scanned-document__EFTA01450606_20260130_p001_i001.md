with household balance sheets well repaired and fiscal drag 
set to be much smaller than it was this year. I do not 
expect any significant downward revision to the FOMC's 
economic projections for growth. Indeed, they may well mark 
down the projected path of the unemployment rate. 
Con: weakness in business investment spending, and more 
recent softness in capital goods orders augurs against the 
sort of self-sustaining economic recovery that the center of 
the FOMC has indicated they need to see to begin to taper. 
Homebuilding too has softened in the wake of the taper 
tantrum. 
Bottom line: growth performance and prospects have 
strengthened just barely enough to warrant a December taper. 
c. Inflation. 
Pro taper: The FOMC has been projecting inflation to return 
to 2% over the next several years. Long-term inflation 
expectations have been well anchored within their recent 
historical ranges; wage inflation has at least leveled off, 
and some indicators have been rising. 
con: core PCE inflation is now uncomfortably low after 
trending down over the past two years. It declined again in 
October, though those numbers may have been tainted by the 
government shutdown. 
Bottom line: Recent inflation performance comes down clearly 
against a December taper, but that could change with an 
upside surprise to core CPI numbers for November tomorrow 
(Tuesday)-a reading of 0.2 to 0.3 would help). 
Bottom line on overall economic conditions: slightly in 
favor of Dec. taper 
2. Costs of QE (potential froth in credit markets, interference with markets, 
fiscal costs or possible losses in Fed net income down the road). 
Pro taper: costs are rising, not declining, many/most on the 
FOMC would like to end the program, everything else equal. 
Fed folks have been saying for some time that they wanted to 
begin to taper by the end of the year, and this is why. 
while asset valuations do not look extreme, there has been a 
certain amount of reaching for yield, and if QE continues at 
this pace for much longer, valuations could become 
stretched. 
Con: FOMC leadership has indicated that they do not see 
significant signs of financial instability associated with 
balance sheet expansion, they do not see markets 
malfunctioning, and they are not too concerned about fiscal 
issues down the road, given that the Fed is not likely to 
sell MBS or long-term Treasuries any time soon. This 
suggests that they would not be driven to taper in the near 
term by cost considerations. 
Bottom line on costs: neutral on December taper 
3. Fiscal uncertainties: this was a key factor behind the September surprise, 
but these uncertainties have now been largely resolved, with the budget deal 
currently in the works set to reduce fiscal drag in 2014 even further. Modest 
risk remains around debt ceiling, but a blowup seems quite unlikely in an 
election year. 
Fiscal: Pro Dec. taper. 
4. communications strategy: 
Several FOMC participants have advocated announcing an explicit schedule 
for winding down QE with the initial taper. Doing so could push the bar 
for the initial taper somewhat higher and augur for delaying it a bit 
further so that they can be more confident they will not have to 
interrupt the exit process. 
Communications: slight Con. 
S. market liquidity: Thin markets in second half of December, raise the 
possibility of an exaggerated negative price reaction, which could put a 
damper on confidence and on retail sales in the final days of the holiday
