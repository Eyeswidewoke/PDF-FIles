HUBUS133 Alpha Group Capital 
Inherent Uncertainty of Appraisal Proceedings 
The outcome of Appraisal Proceedings is fundamental to the Strategy, and these are 
outcomes that are inherently uncertain. Hudson Bay Capital could have successfully 
identified a Corporate Event in which the Transaction Price was materially below the Fair 
Value, but the Appraisal Proceeding resulted in a costly or failed outcome due to 
procedural impediments, the poor quality of the Corporate Value Fund's legal 
representation, judicial discretion and/or other factors. Even if Hudson Bay Capital's 
investment analysis of a transaction is accurate, this by no means assures the success of 
the Strategy in investing in such transaction, which is dependent on numerous factors 
which are not only unpredictable by, but also perhaps unknown to, Hudson Bay Capital. 
In addition, the expense of prosecuting claims, for which there is no guarantee of success, 
will be borne by the Corporate Value Fund and may, in certain circumstances, require 
Partners to return to the Corporate Value Fund capital and earnings previously 
distributed. In some instances, Hudson Bay Capital hopes to mitigate the costs of 
Appraisal Proceedings by hiring counsel on a contingency or hybrid basis and using in-
house resources where possible; however, contingency or hybrid fee arrangements, while 
reducing the outlay for litigation fees, can materially reduce the potential earnings of the 
Corporate Value Fund and ultimately cost more than if the Corporate Value Fund paid 
traditional attorneys' and experts' fees. In addition to attorneys' fees, the Corporate Value 
Fund will bear the numerous costs of bringing and maintaining the litigation, including 
court costs, the expense of document production, the fees and reimbursements of experts 
and other related costs. 
Investing in Corporate Events between Publicly-Traded Companies 
Substantially all of the Investments will be made in the securities of Targets that are 
involved in Corporate Events. Such situations can attract an unusually high degree of 
regulatory scrutiny (including into whether certain participants made illegal use of 
material non-public information ("MNPI")), which can disrupt the progress, delay the 
timing and/or preclude the consummation of, any given Corporate Event. Hudson Bay 
Capital's role in causing the Corporate Value Fund to invest in a given Corporate Event 
may also be the subject of regulatory scrutiny, which could lead to adverse publicity 
and/or enforcement proceedings against both Hudson Bay Capital and the Corporate 
Value Fund itself. 
Material Non-Public Information 
Hudson Bay Capital is involved in a wide range of investment activities and, in the 
course of doing so, may come — whether purposely or inadvertently — into possession 
of MNPI. If so, until such time as such information is no longer "material" or has 
become public, Hudson Bay Capital will be prohibited from transacting in the securities 
of the issuer in question. Such prohibition might not only prevent the Corporate Value 
Fund from participating in an Investment that might otherwise have been highly 
profitable, but also prevent Hudson Bay Capital from implementing hedges or liquidating 
open positions with respect to an Investment to which the Corporate Value Fund is 
already committed, resulting not only in "lost profits" but material losses.
