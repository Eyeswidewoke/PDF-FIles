web his. That weekend it appeared on a Thursday, and then in the paper on Sunday. That weekend, this 
was the topic of discussion in Washington, there's no doubt about that. 
All those Sunday shows have panels, their charge being, let's talk about what people are talking about in 
Washington. Nothing. You could invite other people on; you may not want to have us for one reason or 
another. How can you not raise the issue at all? Because it's so uncomfortable for them to even raise the 
notion that they should focus on the truth rather than this notion of balance no matter what. And that 
remains the case. 
BILL MOYERS: So look what's happening. Senate Republicans are filibustering and blocking scores of 
executive and judicial nominations, as you point out in your new preface; they're delaying the confirmation 
of others. Theyre still willing, as you said last year. to use any tactic, no matter how dangerous and 
destructive, to damage the President and to force its will on him through a form of policy hostage-taking. 
You say that this policy hostage-taking was devised by this group, calling itself the "Young Guns." Who 
are they? 
THOMAS MANN: They are Eric Cantor they are Paul Ryan, and the third is the Republican whip 
Representative McCarthy of California. They laid out before the election a strategy to take hostage the full 
faith and credit of the United States by threatening not to raise the debt limit to accommodate previous 
decisions made by Congress, and signed by the president. It's hard to imagine a more destructive action 
that could be taken. 
We've got problems here, but there is still a flight to the dollar around the world. The one thing we have 
going for us is people trust the dollar and trust the fact that Treasury will pay its obligations when people 
buy bonds. But they were going to take that hostage in order to get immediate spending cuts. 
BILL MOYERS: There was some compromise in January over the, over the deficit. Were you encouraged 
by that? Did you get an adrenaline shot when you... 
NORMAN ORNSTEIN: No. And unfortunately. And here's the reason why. I mean, first of all, of course, 
we knew that the leverage was with President Obama in this case, not with people trying to hold 
something hostage, because inaction here would mean sharp tax increases across the board. And after 
that, the president can come back and say, "I want to propose the biggest tax cut in history for everybody 
except those making over 5250,000 a year? 
So you could, it was clear there would be some kind of a deal that would emerge, whether before or after. 
One of the things that was discouraging about this is it happened very late in the game, of course, as we 
know. It was Joe Biden meeting with Mitch McConnell and coming up with a plan. 
But here's the plan that gets 89 votes in the Senate, including some of the icons of the conservative wing 
of the party which is really a radical wing of the party, from Pat Toomey to Jim Inhofe and Tom Coburn. 
And it goes to the House, and John Boehner. who may have the worst job in America could barely get a 
third of his own party to go along. Now, that's a modest deal. If you can't get more than a third of your 
House Republicans to support a deal like this, that doesn't speak well for the prospects of change. 
BILL MOYERS: And you say that he, that Cantor more than any other politician helped to create the 
series of fiscal crises that you described just a moment ago? 
THOMAS MANN: He really did. He hovered around John Boehner as Boehner was getting into 
negotiations with the president over the course of 2011 to head off the debt ceiling crisis. Bob 
Woodward... 
BILL MOYERS: The Watergate Bob Woodward. 
THOMAS MANN: Yeah.
