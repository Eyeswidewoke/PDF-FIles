As you've heard Patrick say in previous meetings, our goal is to have a plan for the majority of our clients and important 
prospects by 3/31/17. Thoughtful client planning, with full participation from your product partners, will identify the 
growth opportunities for 2017. Thereafter it will be up to you and your product partners to execute against those 
opportunities with urgency so that we can achieve momentum early in the year. It's important. 
These sessions will be different than what you may have experienced in the past. The focus will be on the experience 
during the sessions and the outcomes. Here is what you can expect: 
Preparation for the sessions: 
• 
Let's discuss 10 of your clients for this first round of planning sessions. These should be your top 10 
clients/prospects for revenue growth in 2017. They may not be your existing largest clients. 
• 
By Monday January 23rd, please send me the names of the top 10 clients/prospects in your portfolio for growth 
potential in 2017. In addition, please include any clients who were previously part of the top 100 client planning 
exercise. 
• 
By Monday January 23rD , please send me the names of the ISG/DPM partner, lending specialists and wealth 
planning specialists aligned to those relationships identified. I'll want to communicate with them directly about their 
role in the planning sessions. 
• 
If any of the 10 clients has an existing lending relationship, then I ask that you do the following. Please notify 
the lending specialist and your ISG specialist. They are responsible for meeting together before the planning sessions so 
that the ISG specialist can review the financial disclosure on file and identify potential cross-sell opportunities based 
upon what we know about the client's balance sheet. They will be responsible for coming to your planning session with 
potential cross-sell ideas. 
• 
Instead of your completing a planning template for each client, your RO will be provided with a pre-populated 
template from DBForce that contains SOW information and existing relationship details like products, CBVs and 
revenues. Your RO will be able to aggregate all of your templates into one file that you can send to me and the product 
partner participants for your sessions. Me and the product partners will be responsible for reading all the templates 
before your sessions. This will save time for your team and you won't need to give background information during the 
sessions. 
• 
This week, your RO should go into each of the 10 client profiles and enter the names of the product partners 
who support those relationships. This is important because those product partners will be tagged with follow up 
activities for the opportunities identified. 
• 
Your RO should attend each session and be the scribe. They will be responsible for noting each of the 
opportunities identified and entering those opportunities into DBForce as leads. There will be training for the ROs 
shortly. 
After the sessions: 
• 
DBForce will have a complete list of the opportunities you identified. Your product partners will be able to use 
DBForce to access the list of the opportunities identified for their product group. You will be able to monitor your 
team's calling activity against those opportunities and you will be able to use the DBForce list to work with your product 
specialists on holding each other accountable for follow up activity with clients and prospects. 
• 
I will use the DBForce information to work with you on coordinating your team's efforts on client meetings in 
support of the opportunities identified. 
I'm looking forward to these sessions and please contact me if you have any questions.
