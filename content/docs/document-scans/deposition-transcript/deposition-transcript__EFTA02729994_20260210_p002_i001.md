observation, the inmate is required to have a "bunkie" or a cellmate. This is well known and considered 
"basic 101" policy information. 
did not work Friday August 9, 2019.= relieved Lt. 
another GS-11 Lieutenant at 
MCC, at 5:30am on Saturday August 10, 2019. 
was in his office on the 3rd floor from 5:30am until 
approximately 6:33am when he heard a call for a medical emergency on the 9th floor.= immediately 
went to the 9th floor. EPSTEIN's cell was the first cell to the right of the elevator. When MI arrived at 
EPSTEIN's cell, he saw two COs, Office 
and Officer 
. EPSTEIN was lying down on two 
mattresses on the floor of the cell. Officer 
was next to EPSTEIN's body attempting to administer 
CPR. Officer NOEL was standing by the entrance to the cell and told 
"EPSTEIN hung himself." 
pushed Officer 
off of EPSTEIN and continued CPR. 
asked for someone to get an AED and 
call for the Duty Nurse. The Duty Nurse arrived and took over administering CPR to EPSTEIN.= saw a 
noose fabricated out of bed sheets but could not recall if the noose was around EPSTEIN's neck or on 
the ground next to the body. 
took photos of EPSTEIN's cell on a BOP camera. 
Officer Noel stated "we didn't do rounds at 3am and Sam." Officer 
said he told Officer Noel it 
was not her fault and "We didn't do the rounds. We messed up." The 3am and 5am rounds to which 
Officer Noel referred would have been the count rounds. If the rounds were not completed there should 
not be any signed count slips associated with those times. If there were signed count slips it would mean 
the slips were falsified. If the count is not done, the rounds sheet, which is filled out every 30 min, also 
cannot be completed. At the end of the shift, the supervising Lieutenant signs and sends the completed 
log of the inmates' movements from the day. 
There were several pill bottles on the top bunk in EPSTEIN's cell. Inmates typically put some of their 
belongings on the top bunk when they do not have a cellmate. Lt. I= 
asked Officer Noel "Where's his 
bunkie at?" to which Officer Noel responded "he doesn't have a bunkie." 
Lieutenant 
worked the shift prior to Lieutenant 
. It is possible 
was 
aware EPSTEIN no longer had a "bunkie." 
MCC personnel receive annual refresher training regarding policy and procedure. The topics of inmates 
having a cellmate as well as how and when to conduct the count and complete rounds are covered in 
the annual refresher training. 
After the Duty Nurse removed EPSTEIN's body from the cell, 
secured the door to the cell and 
waited in the control room to notify the Captain and to complete a 583 form. A 583 form contains all the 
memos from the incident. =I later spoke to Officer NOEL and advised her not to lie about what 
happened, say exactly what happened and to document everything in a memo. Officer 
was 
distraught and left MCC before writing a memo. NOEL did not write a memo. Neither NOEL nor 
has reported back to work since the incident. 
has not spoken about the event to other officers.
