Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 361-68 Entered on FLSD Docket 02/10/2016 Page 2 of 4 
March 20, 2011 
To whom it may concern: 
I served as U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida from 2005 through 2009. Over the 
past weeks, I have read much regarding Mr. Jeffrey Epstein. Some appears true, some appears 
distorted. I thought it appropriate to provide some background, with two caveats: (i) under 
Justice Department guidelines, I cannot discuss privileged internal communications among 
Department attorneys and (ii) I no longer have access to the original documents, and as the 
matter is now nearly 4 years old, the precision of memory is reduced. 
The Epstein matter was originally presented to the Palm Beach County State Attorney. Palm 
Beach Police alleged that Epstein unlawfully hired underage high-school females to provide him 
sexually lewd and erotic massages. Police sought felony charges that would have resulted in a 
term of imprisonment. According to press reports, however, in 2006 the State Attorney, in part 
due to concerns regarding the quality of the evidence, agreed to charge Epstein only with one 
count of aggravated assault with no intent to commit a felony. That charge would have resulted 
in no jail time, no requirement to register as a sexual offender and no restitution for the underage 
victims. 
Local police were dissatisfied with the State Attorney's conclusions, and requested a federal 
investigation. Federal authorities received the State's evidence and engaged in additional 
investigation. Prosecutors weighed the quality of the evidence and the likelihood for success at 
trial. With a federal case, there were two additional considerations. First, a federal criminal 
prosecution requires that the crime be more than local; it must have an interstate nexus. Second, 
as the matter was initially charged by the state, the federal responsibility is, to some extent, to 
back-stop state authorities to ensure that there is no miscarriage of justice, and not to also 
prosecute federally that which has already been charged at the state level. 
After considering the quality of the evidence and the additional considerations, prosecutors 
concluded that the state charge was insufficient. In early summer 2007, the prosecutors and 
agents in this case met with Mr. Epstein's attorney, Roy Black. Mr. Black is perhaps best known 
for his successful defense of William Kennedy Smith. The prosecutors presented Epstein a 
choice: plead to more serious state felony charges (that would result in 2 years' imprisonment, 
registration as a sexual offender, and restitution for the victims) or else prepare for a federal 
felony trial. 
What followed was a year-long assault on the prosecution and the prosecutors. I use the word 
assault unentronally, as the defense in this case was more aggressive than any winch i, or the 
prosecutors in my office, had previously encountered. Mr. Epstein hired an army of legal 
superstars: Harvard Professor Alan Dershowitz, former Judge and then Pepperdine Law Dean 
Kenneth Starr, former Deputy Assistant to the President and then Kirkland & Ellis Partner Jay 
Lefkowitz, and several others, including prosecutors who had formally worked in the U.S.
