without a doubt , one of the smartest people i =ave ever met, 
he is multilingual in the areas =f advanced science. He can conduct a seminar in fields as =iverse as evolutionary 
biology, computational neuro science. n =imensional manifolds. , or music as a lens into the brain. His =nterests are so 
far ranging that encompass , signal intelligence, power =aw distributions , and encryption. 
I am well aware =hat in his past he has made some awful decisions, and would have done =ifferently if he had the 
opportunity to do them over. however he =as paid his debt to society, asked his friends and family for =orgiveness and 
has continued his charitable work that he began decades =go. 
i have had the privilege to meet =he worlds greatest minds, and i can easily say that Jeffrey s is =mongst the best of 
those. 
I have =tmost confidence in his integrity. I have dealt with him for a =umber of years on both sides of a negotiation and 
say with certainty =hat I;d rather be on his side. 
He =as been in the Billionaire business for longer than almost anyone else. =nbsp;His insight into the unique problems of 
the super wealthy , has =een invaluable to many others that i =now 
ability with numbers , complex =oncepts. sometimes brutal honesty, refreshing, a =ense of humor that some find 
highly cultured others find just =utright silly, 
His homes are probably =he best collection of real estate in the united states. A private =sland , that some describe as a 
tribute to megalomania. and a ranch in =ew mexico that is truly beyond imagination and my favorite townhouse in =Y. 
His attention to detail is remarkable . I =ind it sad that he doesn't have children of his own, but makes up for =t by 
maintaining close friendships that have lasted for =ecades. 
His chariblae instincts have =een honed over many years and his advice and judgment has been =nvaluable in several 
instances. 
His =bility to explain complex derivatives or concepts on the bleeding edge =f science in layman's terms is part of his 
teaching =ene. 
I have met many people who =riticize those who maintain a friendship with Jeffrey, and a group =hose opinions are 
impervious to change , however, in the vast =ajority of cases , it is with those that have not had the opportunity =o sit 
with him watch as his mind performs an intellectuall ballet. =nbsp;gracefully moving from one difficult topic and 
transitioning to =nother seemingly unrelated , only at the end to have the thread pulled =ightly and ending with an 
elegant coda. =inale. 
I can call him and ask , can you =xplain this to me, and with an impish respond, and a breath of fresh =ir, if he can't , he 
simply says I Don't know. =
