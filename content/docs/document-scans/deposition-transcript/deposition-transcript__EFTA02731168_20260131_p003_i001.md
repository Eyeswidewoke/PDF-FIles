From this point forward, 
recalls that Epstein also frequently brought her into 
his massage room for group sexual encounters with other women, often including Maxwell. In 
IR
these encounters, 
and the women would strip down to their underwear and begin massaging 
Epstein, who wou 
le own on a massage table, face down. After a period of time, Epstein would 
turn over and begin touching the women and engaging in sex acts that, over time, and in various 
instances, included Epstein masturbating, receiving oral sex, and engaging in intercourse. During 
these encounters, 
recalls that Maxwell would sometimes guide the women and give 
instructions about what to do. In the beginning, when 
was approximately 14 or 15, she 
El 
would massage Epstein's feet and try to remain at the periphery of the sexual activity, but over 
time, she believes she became more involved in the sexual activity, which varied in each encounter. 
has not been able to provide details about what sex acts she participated in during these 
group sessions, as compared to the sexual abuse that occurred when she was alone with Epstein. 
However, she recalls that the most significant sexual abuse she experienced with Epstein occurred 
later, when they were alone together. Although Maxwell was not present during these types of 
encounters, she was often in the house, and Epstein would lead 
into a different room to get 
her alone. 
Though Maxwell was not present during the initial episodes of sexual abuse by Epstein, 
as noted above, Maxwell was sometimes present for the types of group encounters/abusive 
sessions described above. At times, Maxwell would undress, and Epstein would give both 
WI
Maxwell and 
instructions about what he wanted them to do during these encounters. 
remem rs t e first time she saw Maxwell naked during one of these sessions, and she 
recalls being struck by how skinny Maxwell was. 
has ex lained that Maxwell would 
"normalize" the situation by behaving casually, and act as if she was 
"cool older sister." 
Maxwell would tell her that everything was "okay" and "make it seem like this is what grown-ups 
do." 
Fp
Because the abuse was so frequent and so long ago, 
does not recall the specifics 
of these episodes with Epstein and Maxwell. She recalls genera y t e types of things that occurred 
during these kinds of encounters, but she is unable to narrate a specific episode. She has explained 
that these memories run together, and while she is confident that Maxwell was present for at least 
several of these group incidents, she does not recall specifically what sex acts occurred during 
these episodes while Maxwell was present. 
Beginning when 
was approximately 14, she began to travel with Epstein and 
Maxwell to New York City on occasion. During what 
believes was an early trip, she stayed 
at Epstein's mansion, and Maxwell and Epstein took er s opping. She recalls that Epstein and 
Maxwell bought her white cotton underwear, and she described it as looking like little kids' 
underwear. 
recalls that on either this trip or another early trip, she took a commercial flight 
home, but did not have identification, so Maxwell came to the airport and helped her get on the 
flight. 
Over the years, from ages fourteen to seventeen, Epstein periodically flew 
to 
New York, where she would stay with him (and sometimes Maxwell) at his house in Manhattan.' 
As discussed below, 
relationship with Epstein continued for several years after 
became an adult.
