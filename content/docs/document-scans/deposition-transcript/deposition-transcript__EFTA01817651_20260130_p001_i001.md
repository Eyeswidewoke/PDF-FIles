Re: 
as i am walking in to my negotation that i have been preparing for , with little focus on anything 
but your self in your email i will try to make it short.. you say i don;t say thank you, but i know 
its not true, you watch 
do nothing but try to be as helpful as she can, she is not trying to 
replace you, she does what she can, as little as that might be, to be helpful.. I was not kissing M, 
/ i took a nap you got out of bed, if you are concerned that others are getting more than you. I'm 
sorry , i think you have got it backwards.. i have asked you what you would like to do , you said 
you didnt know. you wanted to be in charge of the staff.. you chose not to train your dog. its 
been a year. your reaction is surprising, according to you, you cater to my every whim„ but when 
i ask just what does that mean , you tell me i ask you to do labels and buy shampoo, ( the labels i 
asked two weeks ago-- you didnt do it). you criticize me for saying thank you for sues stupid 
things. Would you prefer i not say thank you to her. i was originally going to ask ■ 
to buy her 
the clothes ( this is the correct spelling), but i thought you would get upset if i did, I realize this 
time has been difficult for you as well as me.. I warned you about turning sex into a designated 
task on certain days at certain ties„ I remeber telling you it was dangerous„ you chose to ignore 
that advice. , i lived up to our agreement.. AT some point you have to come to grips with actual 
reality. i ask what you have done to cater to my every wish no answer. i tell you that if you 
won"t do nice things others will, It makes no sense to me. you are now jealous of the reatment 
that 
receives„ jenn gets the credit „ nanny gets to watch tv, and in your mind you only get 
jokes.. Iam glad you can't live this way. When i get back , not until around 8 ,we should come to 
some sort of agreemnent.. I'm not sure about the mansion comment. what is the point?

Why don't you think about how you treat me compared to your prosties and assistants. You 
are cold and critical of everything I do. You roll your eyes, don't say thank you, don't kiss me, 
touch me and don't spend any quality time with me during the day, you constantly make 
snooty comments, All your jokes are about killing me or my leaving and you bringing other 
girls over.. walks in and you don't stop touching, hugging, kissing, tickling her back and 
lovingly calling her name. You make a point to say thank you for the stupidest things she does 
and then you ask me to go buy her close because she is supposedly helpful. You let your 
assistant buy a mansion and put her in charge of your staff while you ask me to label light 
switches and buy shampoo. 
No kiss goodbye, no thank you when I shave your neck, no I missed you, no I am happy to see 
, no movie, no ride to the office, no sex, no affection...yet you do all that with others like 
E. 
I can't live this way. I need a break. I can't stand you treating me with that cold attitude any 
longer while you are perfectly capable of being nice thoughtful and a pleasure to be around
