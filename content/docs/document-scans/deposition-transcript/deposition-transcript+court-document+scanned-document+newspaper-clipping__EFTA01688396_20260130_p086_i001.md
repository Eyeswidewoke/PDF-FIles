trmer Mend claimed Epstein 
O0-_,ca out of a promise to reim-
gurse him hundreds of thousands of 
dollars after their failed investment 
in Texas oil wells. A judge decided 
Epstein owed him nothing. 
"It's a bad memory. I would 
rather not have ever met Jeffrey 
Epstein," said Michael Stroll, the 
retired former president of Williams 
Electronics and. Sega Corp. "Suffice 
it to say I have nothing good to say 
about him." 
Among the characteristics most 
attributed to Epstein is a penchant 
for women. 
He has been linked to Maxwell, 
a fixture on the high-society party 
circuits in both New York and Lon-
don. Previous girlfriends are said to 
include a former Ms. Sweden and a 
Romanian model. 
"He's a lot of fun to be with," 
Donald Trump told New York maga-
zine in 2002. "It is even said that he 
tiles beautiful women as much as I 
do, and many of them are on the 
younger side. No doubt about it, 
Jeffrey enjoys his social life." 
Investigation leads to Epstein 
Although he was not a fre-
quenter of the Palm Beach social 
scene, he made his presence felt 
Among his charitable donations, he 
gave $90,000 to the Palm Beach 
Police Department and $100,000 to 
Ballet Florida. 
In Palm Beach, he lived in luxu-
ry. Three black Mercedes sat in his 
garage, alongside a green Harley-
Davidson. His jet waited at a hangar 
at Palm Beach InternationalAirport 
At home, a private chef and a small 
staff stood at the ready. From a 
window in his mansion, he could 
look out on the Intracoastal Water-
way and the West Palm Beach sky-
line. He seemed to be a man who 
had everything. 
But extraordinary wealth can 
fuel extraordinary desires.

In Marc 
said another parent had overheard a 
conversation between their chil-
dren. 
Now the mother was afraid her 
14-year-old daughter had been 
molested by a man on the island. 
The phone call triggered an 
extensive investigation, one that 
would lead detectives to Epstein but 
• i leave them frustrated. 
Palm Beach police and the state 
attorney's office have declined to 
discuss the case. But a Palm Beach 
police report detailing the criminal 
probe offers a window into what 
detectives faced as they sought to 
close in on Epstein. 
Detectives interviewed the girl. 
who told them a friend had invited 
her to a rich man's house to perform 
a massage. She said the Mend told 
her to say she was 18 if asked. At the 
house, she said she was paid $300 
after shipping to her panties and 
massaging the man while he mas-
turbated. 
Police interview 5 alleged victims 
The investigation began in full 
after the girl identified Epstein in a 
photo as the man who had paid her. 
Police arranged for garbage trucks 
to set aside Epstein's trash so police 
could sift through it They set up a 
video camera to record the comings 
and goings at his home. They mon-
Itored an airport hangar for
s of 
his private jet's arrivals and de
signpar-
tures. 
They quickly learned that the 
I
woman who took the 14-y 
dgirl 
to Epstein's house was 
Rob-
son, a Palm Beach Comm 
Col-
lege student from Loxahatchee. In a 
sworn 11* 
at police head-
quarters,
then 18, admitted 
she had 
n 
east six girls to visit 
Epstein, all between the ages of 14 
and 16. Epstein paid her for each 
visit, she said.

Police interviewed five alleged 
victims and 17 witnesses. Their 
report shows some of the girls said 
they had been instructed to have sex 
with another woman in front of 
Epstein, and one said she had direct 
intercourse with him. 
In October, police searched the 
Palm Beach mansion. They discov-
females, 
photos of naked, young-looking 
just as several of the girls 
had described in interviews. Hidden 
cameras were found in the garage 
area and inside a clock on Epstein's 
desk, alongside a girl's high school 
transcript 
• 
Two of Epstein's former 
employees told investigators that 
young-looking girls showed up to 
perform massages two or three 
times a day when Epstein was in 
town. 
They said the girls were permit-
ted many indulgences. A chef 
cooked for them. Workers gave 
them rides and handed out hun-
dreds of dollars at a time. 
One employee told detectives he 
was told to send a dozen roses to one 
teenage girl alter a high school 
drama performance. Others were 
given rental cars. One, according to 
police, received a $200 Christmas 
bonus. 
The cops moved to cement their 
case. But as they tried to tighten the 
noose, they encountered other 
forces at work. 
In Orlando they interviewed a 
possible victim who told them noth-
ing inappropriate had happened 
between her and Epstein. They 
asked her whether she had spoken 
to anyone else. She said yes, a pri-
vate investigator had asked her the 
same questions. 
When they subpoenaed one of 
Epstein's former employees, he told 
them the same thing. He and a pri-
vate eye had met ate restaurant days 
earlier to go over what the man 
would tell investigators. 
Detectives received complaints 
that private eyes were posing as 
police officers. When they told 
Epstein's local attorney, Guy Frons-
tin, he said the investigators worked 
for Roy Black, the high-powered 
Miami lawyer who has defended the 
likes of Rush Limbaugh and William 
Kennedy Smith. 
While the private eyes were 
conducting a parallel investigation, 
Dershowitz, the Harvard law pro-
fessor, traveled to West Palm Beach 
with information about the girls. 
From their own profiles on the pop-
ular Web site MySpace.com, he 
obtained copies of their discussions 
about their use of alcohol and mari-
juana. 
He took his research to a meet-
ing with prosecutors in early 2006, 
where he sought to cast doubton the 
teens' reliability.
