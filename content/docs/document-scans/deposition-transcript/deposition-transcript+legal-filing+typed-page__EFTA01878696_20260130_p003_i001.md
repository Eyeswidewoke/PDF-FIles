certainly empower critics of the universal banking model in the EU and the US. The 
Liikanen Group inquiry is due to report to the European Commission on bank structure 
later this year. The Commission itself is then expected to issue its own 
recommendations on bank structure. Both will certainly draw on the Barclays 
experience. 
The culture question 
This bigger issue about the values of the trading floor is going to prove hard to shake off. 
The role of securities divisions in driving investment bank profits over the last two 
decades has predictably seen a generation of securities managers rise to the leadership 
of investment and universal banks. While it is perhaps unwise to generalise too much, 
most of these men have brought with them the directness and self-belief that comes 
with surviving a career on the trading floor. 
They also bring with them a view of the market and of market-making that is often at 
odds with the way most politicians understand them. Watching Lloyd Blankfein of 
Goldman Sachs trying to explain to the US Senate in 2010 why it was legitimate for 
Goldman Sachs as a market maker to be both long and short in the US property market 
at the same time reinforced the point. There is a yawning gulf between a trader's 
pragmatic view of financial markets and a wider political and public audience who 
generally interpret the market maker's pragmatism as cynicism, detachment and short 
termism, especially when it results in making a lot of money. 
Banks tend to be highly impatient with this public and political ambivalence. Most 
banks' response to efforts at greater regulation of securities markets have often been 
rooted in the argument that these markets are fundamentally a forum for free trade 
between consenting adults and should be treated as such. It is this argument that the 
LIBOR-scandal, with its taint of market fixing, and the persistent flow of suggestions of 
contempt for customers and clients, does so much to undermine. 
The events of the last two months have succeeded in cementing for good the idea that 
the banking crisis of 2008 was ultimately the result of unethical, 'casino' behaviour on 
the trading floor. Whatever failings banks might have exhibited in their ethical standards 
here, the reality is that the banking crisis had its roots in poor lending and risk standards, 
and poor management of loan book funding, rather than wild gambles or duplicity in the 
securities markets. The Vickers Commission explicitly recognised this by focusing on 
raising capital standards at the retail banks that make up the backbone of the British 
credit system. 
Recent huge losses in the Chief Investment Office at.' P Morgan and conduct like that of 
Barclays' traders have made this distinction far too subtle to insist upon politically. This 
may not matter much in regulatory terms — regulators have already embarked on a wide 
range of securities markets reforms. But it will help embed the persistent political idea 
that retail banking is inherently 'safe' while investment banking and securities markets 
business is inherently 'risky'. To which recent events have added the taint of suspect 
ethical conduct. 
For universal bank leaders who have come out of the securities world, this is likely to be 
part of the challenge of dealing with politicians and regulators over the next few years. 
Politicians actively questioned Mr Diamond's credentials to lead a retail bank when he 
was appointed Barclays CEO in 2011. His departure leaves an even greater burden on 
universal bank leaders to understand the growing political gap between the skillset 
desired of retail bank management and the caricature of the men and women who
