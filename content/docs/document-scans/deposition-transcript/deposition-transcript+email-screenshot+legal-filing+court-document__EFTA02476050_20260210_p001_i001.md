for your eyes only. thnx i have not sent this yet 
the facts as i see them 
in June and then again =ept, we both agreed to a 50% of phaidon payout., then only after weeks, when you delayed 
any detailed=20 discussion of money wanting to give the issue a thoughtful resp=nse ( which I fully understand ) . you 
unilaterally changed changed our agreement.. 5m would be reserved for the future ? . and out of=the remaining 15m 
,? i would receive only a third. ( note : I'm=confident that both the debt , and the artspace investment will also lead to 
a write off of another 30 m. plus=C2 ) In my dining room ,you were surprised when I said that i require most=20 
people to pay their advisory fee up front so that I am assured =hat I will be properly compensated for my work when 
strategies are implemented . you may recall that you appeared offended a=d said " are you suggesting that i would 
go back on my word " I said no = of course not ! you are my closest of friends ,but my experience is that=C2 when 
amounts get large, people tend to get unhappy when it actually comes time for them to pay 
I included in this letter the email i sent to you on April 15, t=e day i was examining your returns It laid out my 
understanding of the compensation for a=20 transaction of the magnitude to the penny of the one just completed. =20 
though the number was great it was clear. When it appeared that the=20 details could now be worked out I was the 
first to say , it is too mu=h money, however. 
From day zero I proposed to di=count to 50 - 60 million the fair price of the transacti=n just completed . including 
Phaidon.. though this amount was already substantially les= than our agreed and negotiated formula. - I was never 
told that this =AO was out of range. in fact, alternative methods of payment . plane, =r an -in-kind payment were 
discussed ( ie including =AO keeping the 30m portion of fee outstanding till March ) ,I provided as =ou specifically 
requested a detailed step by step execution plan =nd reviewed all documents that i was given access to. ( Phaidon w=s 
not forthcoming ) in order to make my many correction= . I was then told that Mans involvement warranted a 
discount . say it was 50 %= though no one could posit such a large amount unless they were wearing a brightly=20 
colored clown suit. , the payment associated with the deal was =nown . It had both sent in writing and spoken about 
on the phone nume=ous times , a detailed execution plan was provided . then an= only then after all was laid out for 
the group I was told that after a number o= conversations with brad karp that a tota= of only 20m would be paid , 
(and even that was more than originally conte=plated ) for both transactions . Leon I feel It was remarkably unfair. I 
wondered whether =AO brad even knew of our prior agreement.? , I would ask that you I and Brad karp<i=pan> sit 
together if you think it would be helpful.. If the =ransactions were never consummated , i would not be owed a dime, 
however , the expect=d fee was known up front. , the detailed step by step plan was f=llowed and overseen by me, the 
amount that I had requested befo=e the transaction was even begun, and had already been heavily discou=ted, out of 
friendship, from our agreement . I believe the decision re onl= paying 20 m has frankly , left me felling quite une=sy.
