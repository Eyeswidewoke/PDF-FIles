Dear Jeffrey, 
It was very nice to see the Library in place. It makes me feel very proud, and I'm very happy that 
a project of this quality will remain in the island. As we spoke on the phone last Saturday, I have 
been trying to get a complete list of the remaining things that we need to complete in order to 
finish this project. I went through a Punch List with Fancelli, who is very receptive to all my 
comments, and he is scheduling to return to the island ONLY when certain things arc finished. 
The main issues are the installation of the large window, the installation of the parquet floor, 
finishing the remaining electrical and defining (in order to produce them in time) the two entry 
doors and the two cabinet doors. (ex T.V.cabinets). Also, the decision for the ceiling, that is 
probably the longest in term of production. On the Fancelli side, all the details as I said before are 
agreed and under control. 
My suggestions are the following: 
CEILING: I think the right way to finish it is to demolish the plaster frame around the painted 
canvas, frame this in FAUX and complete the rest of the 4 sides in Trompe I"oeil featuring casings 
and moldings in Faux Bois and deep blue as the original central canvas. The firm I recommend 
that can do a great job is Meriguet Carriere, who suggested to paint all this in canvas and then 
apply it to the ceiling, (as it is done with the Venitian ceilings) , in order to cope with the potential 
humidity problem. This way we finish the volume as it was originally planned, and I can check 
regulary the production at their Ateliier. 
FLOORS: The wood floor cannot be as rustic as the ones I was forwarded by Doug, I think the 
paneling in its rusticity is extremely sofisticated, so either we go with a Parquet that has a plain 
border and a spectacular floor (like the cubes I sent to you) and perhaps two smaller Sisal rugs so 
you can see part of the floor, or, a nice plain board floor with a spectacular rug. This rug can be 
either an antique Agra,(palace rug with out central medalion) or a Savonerie type contemporary 
designed rug customed for the space. Either one can enhance the room, the only concern would 
be the delay on the custom one (approximatively 9 months). 
So far I have the following quotes: 
Ceiling by Meriguet 
90.000 EUROS 
Embossed Leather 
(as sample) 
15.000 EUROS 
FLOOR WITH 
PARQUETRY 
60.000 EUROS 
FANCELLI: m waiting for his estimates on: The doors with the bamboo wire to replace the 
T.V. cabinet doors, the extra hardware to have in stock, and the panels and casings for the two 
entry doors 
RUGS: I'm waiting for the estimates. 
MERIGUET: I'm waiting on their estimates on the Faux paiting for the window frames. 
As you can understand, some of these items arc rather urgent so I can finish the project within our 
agreed dead line. J.P.
