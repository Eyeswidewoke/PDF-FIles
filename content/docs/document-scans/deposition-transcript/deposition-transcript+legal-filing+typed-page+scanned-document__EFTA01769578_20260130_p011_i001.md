[Asharq Al-Awsat] But they have allocated large funds to Jerusalem, the las= of which at the Baghdad summit. Have 
these funds arrived? 
[Quray] No, no they have not. None of the countries has paid, except Saudi =rabia. 
[Asharq Al-Awsat] Then, in the light of this diagnosis, what is the necessa=y next step at the Palestinian level? 
[Quray] In order to be objective, we should know clearly the magnitude of o=r strength, and our stance now. The 
Palestinian stance to some extent is n=t bad. Second, we need an Arab stance. If the Arab stance is not serious a=out 
making the Palestinian cause one of its priorities, this will be a point of weakness. Unfortunately, we=no longer are one 
of the priorities of the Arab stance, neither are we one=of the priorities of the international stance. The United States is 
turnin= toward East Asia; this is not a secret; Hillary Clinton wrote about that. There is a transformation that=might 
create a vacuum. 
[Asharq Al-Awsat] You have said that the Palestinian stance toward the nego=iations is not bad. Are you really satisfied 
with it? 
[Quray] The Palestinian stance still is experimenting, and the policy of ex=erimenting sometimes leads to mistakes. I am 
not against the negotiations,=but the negotiations with the mechanisms to which we are used no longer le=d to any 
results, and will not lead to any result. The mechanism of the bilateral meetings that are publi=hed in the newspapers 
before they start is no longer beneficial; this is f=rst. 
Second, there are issues that the Palestinian side cannot decide alone. Let=me give you an example; the issue of the 
refugees, you cannot decide this =ssue without Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, and Egypt. These are the rights of ci=izens, the 
rights of peoples, and the right of the host country. Therefore, you need these sides. Also some =nternational sides 
ought to be informed step by step as we proceed. 
This also applies to the issue of Jerusalem in which we need indirect parti=ipation by the Arab and Muslim countries. 
The same applies to security. Israel talks everyday about security, and has=transformed it into a condition for 
negotiations. There ought to be an und=rstanding of the issue of security at the regional level. 
I do not call for partnership at the negotiations table, but there has to b= participation and a change of mechanism. 
[Asharq Al-Awsat] But you are talking about the most important sovereignty =ssues in the negotiations? 
[Quray] Yes, (the decision) is ours, but we cannot contract it on our own. =e want Arab, regional, and international sides 
to be present with us. We o=ght to depart from the logic of bilateral negotiations. This is no longer =eneficial, and for 
this reason these bilateral negotiations one time are transformed into overview negoti=tions, and another time are 
exploratory negotiations. If there are negotia=ions, let them be through the new mechanisms. 
[Asharq Al-Awsat] Had you been still the chairman of the negotiating team o= had you had the power to decide, how 
would you act now? 
[Quray] I am not saying that our stance is correct. The condition of haltin= the settlement activities is right and correct. 
However, it is important =o say that I will not under any circumstances recognize any settlement blo= that has been built 
on the 1967 territories, and I will never accept it. Syria has not said stop the settl=ment activities, but it said no 
settlements after the agreement. Egypt did=not say, for instance, stop the building activities in Yamit (settlement i= 
Sinai), but when the situation was resolved the settlement was demolished. In Gaza, have they [the Israel=s] not left it? 
Therefore, our stance ought to be clear, but without makin= it understood that the required amendments are in 
exchange for the settle=ents. 
[Asharq Al-Awsat] But the Israelis say that you have agreed that the settle=ents can stay in exchange for land? 
[Quray] The PA has not agreed to this not even once. 
[Asharq Al-Awsat] Have they not agreed even that principal settlements can =tay? 
[Quray] No, no, in Camp David we said there can be amendments to the border=. Let me be frank, neither Abu-Ammar 
(Yasser Arafat), nor Abu-Mazin (Mahmu= Abbas) agreed that settlements could stay. 
[Asharq Al-Awsat] Then, you are in favor of announcing a categorical stance=toward the settlements and going to the 
negotiations? 
[Quray] Of course, if there are clear mechanisms I am not against the negot=ations. 
[Asharq Al-Awsat] But is this not a new experiment? 
[Quray] No, no, the international community will be present, the Internatioral Quartet and Arab and regional sides, and 
also there will be a time limi=. 
[Asharq Al-Awsat] But rather than doing this, the PA has addressed a letter=to Israeli Prime Minister Binjamin 
Netanyahu. Have you seen it? 
[Quray] Not at all, I heard about it the same as you have.
