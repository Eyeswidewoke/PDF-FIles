Hi Jeffrey, 
Good to hear from you -- and timely, in fact! I was planning to email you in a few 
weeks time, but since you've pinged me now, I'll take the opportunity to tell you 
now all the stuff I was going to tell you then.... 
There is a LOT to say, so please read to the end ;-) 
In case the email formatting is annoying, I've attached the same message in PDF 
form as well... 
I'll start with updates, and then move on to hopeful near-future stuff... 
On a personal note: I'm living in Hong Kong these days (trying to short-sell my 
empty house in Maryland, whose mortgage is currently badly underwater), and 
have moved on to my 3rd wife (a very sweet 28 year old mainland-Chinese 
computational linguist, about to finish her PhD). 
The "OpenCog for game characters" project (based at Hong Kong Polytechnic 
University) is proceeding OK. It was supposed to end January 2013, but staffing the 
project took longer than expected, so there's extra $$ in the project account and we 
will probably be able to get it extended till June. As you may recall, that project was 
funded 9/10 by the Hong Kong government (specifically the ITF "Innovation in 
Technology Foundation"), and 1/10 by my consulting company Novamente LLC 
(which got the money indirectly from you, via your donation to the nonprofit org 
Humanity+). 
I have been working on the OpenCog AGI project part-time (as there's not enough $$ 
in that project's budget to pay me a salary), and there have been 4-7 people working 
on it full-time (some are MS or PhD students, a couple are young programmers). I'm 
also involved with a couple other Al-based projects here in Hong Kong that pay me 
money (not a lot, but enough to let me pay my kids' college tuition in the US, etc.). 
These other projects involve using OpenCog's machine learning software to analyze 
genetics data, and Hong Kong stock market data. But I go to the OpenCog AGI lab for 
a few hours every day, and spend a lot of time on it evenings and weekends. 
We have not yet gotten the OpenCog game character to be extremely intelligent. It's 
definitely still a work in progress. But we have gotten OpenCog to control a 
character that moves around in a game world and does various things, trying to 
achieve its simple goals (finding batteries, avoiding danger, learning new things, 
etc.). The game world we've built, in the Unity3D game engine, is blocks-based and 
involves 100,000+ blocks used to build houses, trees, etc. etc. Actually, just one 
week ago we finally got OpenCog to work together with this fancy game world -- it 
took too long, but it was great to see it finally happen. So our job for the next 6 
months is to make it more and more intelligent. 
My collaboration with Itamar somewhat stalled for a while, due to him back-
burnering his AGI work in favor of commercial work (AI-based stock market
