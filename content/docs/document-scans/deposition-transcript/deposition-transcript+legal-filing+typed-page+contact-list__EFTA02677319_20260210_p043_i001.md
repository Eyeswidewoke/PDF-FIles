Faculty: McPhearson, Paul 
TR 
10:00 AM - 11:40 AM 
Credits: 4 
CRN 7470 Sec A 
This unique course spans the disciplines of politics and ecology to understand biodiversity from 
local, national, and global scales, in both urban and rural contexts. It ties the growing field of urban 
ecology and biodiversity, with critical social theory and analysis surrounding environmental politics. 
Through a cross-disciplinary perspective. we will engage in critical assessments of sciences as a 
political practice, look clearly at the material effects of environmental discourses. and engage 
theoretically with work about the boundaries, ontologies, and political economies of environmental 
issues.

Faculty: Bach, Jonathan

09:00 AM 11:40 AM 
Credits: 3 
CRN 5267 Sec A 
This class serves as an introduction to Global Studies. The focus is on the tension between order 
and justice as it plays out across the contemporary world, from war to migration. to the changing 
roles of the state, international institutions. transnational actors. and citizens. A governing 
metaphor for the class is the 'border' and the ways in which it creates order and disorder in the 
modem system of states. We will examine the creation of the borders of countries. but also the 
borders between the local and the global, the legal and illegal. the licit and the illicit. self and 
other. These borders have intertwined histories. structures, and logic that we shall explore 
together. In particular we will seek to understand order as a dynamic relationship between 
territory, identity and belonging, and justice as a question of responsibility and ethics at the 
collective and personal level in an intimate relationship to forms of order. In other words, how did 
we get to where we are today, and what shouldoand canine do about it? We will explore these 
topics through "global" perspectIve with an interdisciplinary focus, emphasizing the 
interconnectedness between global and local spaces and the impact of global issues on the real 
human lives that are inevitably at the center of our investigations. <div>This course is open to all 
bachelor level students at the university.</div>'
