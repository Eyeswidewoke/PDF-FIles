Prince Andrew's friend, Ghislainc Maxwell, some underage girls and a very disturbing ... Page 10 of 18 
• with a present for him — a latex puppet of him from Spitting Image. 
"The room was very large, considering it was Manhattan. It was on East 71, with four floors. It was 
beautiful, like a museum, with relics from thousands of years BC. There were huge paintings. 
"I didn't grow up poor, but I realised there was more money there than I could ever have imagined. 
"We had a picture taken. Virginia, another girl there, sat on a chair and had the puppet on her lap. 
Andrew sat on another chair, I sat on his lap — and he put his hand on my breast. Ghislainc put the 
puppet's hand on Virginia's breast, then Andrew put 
on mine. It was a great joke. Everybody 
laughed. Ghislaine made a lot of sexual jokes," says. 
"She had a very dirty sense of humour. 
"There were pictures of her and Jeffrey and the Pope, and her and Jeffrey and Castro, and her and 
Jeffrey and Clinton." 
If the groping incident was shrugged off as a joke, it was in New York that 
got the first 
indications of something more seriously amiss. 
"While I was in New York, Jeffrey asked me to do the nipple thing. He asked me to touch his nipples 
during the massage. I was shocked. I said, 'I am not doing this. I'm done' And I walked out of the room. 
He couldn't believe I refused. No one else had ever done that." 
Despite her refusal, she was invited to spend time on Epstein's private island in the British Virgin 
Islands where, she was warned by Jeffrey, that there would be "sex stuff' going on. 
Says 
: "I thought I was going to the island to do massage. I thought I would probably get paid. I 
was doing one or two a day, mostly for him, but sometimes for Ghislaine. She wasn't very picky, but he 
[Epstein] kept dictating what he wanted. She would be naked under a towel during the massage. There 
was no suggestion from her of anything untoward during the massages." 
The trip seemed like paradise to 
. She says: "The island was incredible, with four wheelers to 
drive around in and this beautiful living room area with a great projector TV screen. 
"We were all watching movies together at night but not porn — Jeffrey isn't into that. It felt like a fairy 
tale and they were great fun to be around. 
"I do remember him and her jumping off the dock naked, swimming. 
"I thought it was normal for them, they were very free people. I would not do it with people around, but 
it was normal for them." 
During the break, 
got an idea of the kind of circles Epstein usually moved in. 
"I would be massaging him and he'd be on the phone and then hang up and say, 'oh, that was Cate 
Blanchett,' or 'I was on a plane with Clinton.' Clinton is definitely a friend of his. 
"He'd say, 'I was hanging out with Leo diCaprio and Bruce Willis'." 
Then she adds: "I met one
