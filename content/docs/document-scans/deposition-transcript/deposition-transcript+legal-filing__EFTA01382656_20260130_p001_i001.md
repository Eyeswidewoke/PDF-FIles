Security and Fraud businesses. partially offset by increases in our Stored Value Network business.

conversion in the third quarter of 2012 resulting in a $14 million decline in revenue from the prior period. and lower pricing. including both price 
compression on contract renewals and other net pricing incentives. Stoned Value Network revenue increased 14% in 2013 compared to 2012 due to 
higher payment volumes within the open loop payroll distribution program related to new and existing business of $19 million, higher closed loop 
payment volumes of S8 million as well as higher card shipments of $5 million. In addition, Stored Value Network revenue increased 4 percentage 
points due to growth in one of our alliances, resulting from the acquisition of a payment solutions business that occurred in the fourth quarter of

payments, partially offset by growth in our portfolio of fraud solutions products.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
Our source of liquidity is principally cash generated from operating activities supplemented as necessary on a short-term basis by 
borrowings against our senior secured revolving credit facility. We believe our current level of cash and short-term financing capabilities along 
with future cash flows from operations are sufficient to meet the needs of the business.
