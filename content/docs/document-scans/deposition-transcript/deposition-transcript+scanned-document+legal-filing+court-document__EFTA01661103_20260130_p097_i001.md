Notice Of Changes To Your Cardmember Agreement In Connection With Change of Issuer 
This is a notice of changes to your American Express Card Account (your "Account') and to the Cardmember Agreement (the "Agreement) 
governing the Account. We recommend that you review this notice carefully, share it with any Additional Cardmembers on your Account, and 
keep it for future reference. 
This notice is given to you by American Express Travel Related Services Company, Inc. ("TRS') and American Express Centurion Bank 
(AECB"). The changes are being made in connection with the assignment by TRS of your Account to AECB. 
This notice formally amends your Agreement as of the date It becomes effective. Any contrary or conflicting language in the Agreement Is 
replaced fully and completely. All terms of the Agreement not changed by this notice remain in full force and effect. Your account number 
remains the same. After the assignment of your Account is completed, we will send you a new Agreement that incorporates the changes, so 
that you will have a restated agreement that includes all applicable terms. 
In general, the changes become effective on the 'Effective Date,' which will be the first day of the third billing period for your Account 
beginning after the Closing Date referenced above. This is the Effective Date even if you do not receive a billing statement for that billing 
period. However, if on the Effective Date your Account is more than 60 days past due, or there Is an unresolved dispute on your Account, 
the changes will be delayed and become effective on the "Secondary Effective Dale The Secondary Effective Date is the first day of the 
first billing period for your Account after the Effective date in which your Account is not more than 60 days past due and there Is no 
unresolved dispute. If for any reason the changes will not be Implemented for your Account on the Effective Date or the Secondary Effective 
Date, we will give you further notice. 
Change of Issuer 
The issuer of your Account, TRS, will assign your Account and the Agreement to AECB on the Effective Date. Accordingly, reference to 
"American Express Travel Related Services Company, Inc.' In the Welcome to American Express Cardmembership section and 
immediately below the Applicable Law section of your Agreement is changing to 'American Express Centurion Bank.' 
Governing Law 
In connection with the change of issuer described immediately above, the state law governing the Agreement and your Account will change 
from the law of New York to the law of Utah. Accordingly, references to 'New York' in the Applicable Law section of your Agreement are 
changing to 'Utah? 
Late Fees 
The fees we may assess for late payment will change and will no longer vary for Accounts with billing addresses in certain states except as 
noted. Accordingly, we are replacing the entire Late Fees section of your Agreement with the following: 
'If payment of any portion of the Amount Due on a billing statement is not credited to your Account by the 141" day after the Closing Date 
of the next bang period (Next Closing Date), we may assess a fee of $29 (Iowa $15). In addition, if payment of the Amount Due is not 
credited by the following Next Closing Date, we may assess a further fee in that same billing period of the greater of 530 or 2.9% of the 
Amount Due that was not credited by that Next Closing Date (Iowa $15). If payment of the Amount Due is not credited by successive 
Next Closing Dates, we may assess a fee equal to the greater of $30 or 2.9% of the Amount Due that remains not credited by each 
successive Next Closing Date (Iowa $15)." 
Flexible Payment Features 
• 
Since your Account will be issued by AECB, we are making certain changes to your Agreement with respect to the Sign & Travel and/or 
Extended Payment Option account. These changes reflect that the Sign & Travel and/or Extended Payment Option, when activated, are now 
features of your Account and are no longer a separate account. Accordingly, references throughout the Agreement to 'Card Account' are 
changing to 'Account.' 
We are adding a new section entitled Flexible Payment Features to the Agreement, reading in its entirety as follows: 
"Flexible Payment Features 
We may advise you that we have added one or more special plans to your Account that permit you to extend payment on various 
Charges designated by us. In this Agreement, each of these special plans is called a "Feature.' These Features include, but are not 
itmited to, Sign & Traver, Extended Payment Option, and certain promotional offers we may make. 
The Sign & Travel Feature permits you, if eligible, to extend payment for airline tickets, cruise ship tickets, prepaid tour packages, 
certain Charges made outside of the U.S. and any other Charges designated by us. To elect to use this Feature, if you are eligible, you 
must either advise the travel agent, airline, or other travel Industry merchant that you with to do so when giving your Account number 
for payment at the time of purchase, or follow other procedures prescribed by us. 
The Extended Payment Option permits you, if eligible, to extend payment for all eligible Charges by advising us one time that you wish 
to do so. If this Feature is added to your Account, all of your eligible Charges will be billed under the Extended Payment Option Feature 
of your Account. Eligible Charges means those individual Charges that are at or above the dollar amount disclosed to you when you 
enroll In this Feature, or any other amount designated by us. The following are examples of Charges that are not eligible Charges: 
Express Cash, American Express® Travelers Cheques, American Express'/ Gift Cheques, Privileged Asset?, insurance, real estate and 
other transactions determined by us. 
We may change our designation of what Charges are eligible for the Sign & Travel Account and/or the Extended Payment Option at any 
time. Any Charges that are not eligible for extended payment, or any otherwise eligible Charges for which you have elected not to 
extend payment, will be due in full upon your receipt of the billing statement. Additionally, any Charges incurred by a Cardmember who 
is not eligible to use one of the Features MI also be due In full upon your receipt of the billing statement. 
Even if your Account is not enrolled in a Feature, you may request to transfer the pay-in-full balance, or a portion thereof, to a Feature, 
and extend payment of those amounts over time. We may approve or decline your transfer request in whole or In part at our sole 
discretion. Any portion of the pay-in-full balance not authorized by us for transfer to a Feature must be paid In full upon your receipt of 
your billing statement.'
