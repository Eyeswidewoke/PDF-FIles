the anticipation of how this could spread, all of the prevention from it and, yet, they are 
susceptible. Just think of America's working families and especially America's essential workers 
how susceptible they are to this virus and that is really part of our discussion on the 
coronavirus negotiations." 
Politico (10/25, McCaskill, 4.29M) reports Senate Republicans "were forced to address 
Meadows' comments." Politico adds that whereas Senate Majority Whip Thune and Sen. Roy 
Blunt (R-MO) "disagreed with Meadows," Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham "took a 
different tack, appearing to defend Meadows." 
The New York Daily News (10/25, Shahrigian, 2.52M) reports former New Jersey Gov. 
Chris Christie (R), who tested positive for COVID last month after working with the President to 
prepare for the first debate, delivered "muted criticism" of Pence's decision not to quarantine. 
On ABC's This Week, Christie stated that he was "a little bit surprised" to hear Pence would 
continue to campaign and he "said the Trump White House's disdain of wearing masks in spite 
of warning from health officials 'has been a problem." 
The AP (10/25, Marchione) reports "health policy specialists" on Sunday "questioned 
White House officials' claim that federal rules on essential workers allow...Pence to continue to 
campaign and not quarantine himself after being exposed to the coronavirus." Axios (10/25, 
521K) reports former FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb "said 'the short answer is yes' when 
asked whether...Pence is putting others at risk by continuing to campaign after several aides 
tested positive for COVID-19, stressing that the White House needs to be 'very explicit about 
the risks that they're taking." 
Ashish Jha, Dean of the Brown University School of Public Health, said on CNN's Inside 
PoliticsVi (10/25, 1.11M) the Vice President "should be in quarantine, period. A negative test 
doesn't get you out of quarantine. And the quarantine is not a nice thing to do if you have the 
luxury to do it. It is essential to protect other people around him so he doesn't become a vector 
for more cases. I think that is really not an area of debate, and no public health expert would 
say he should be on the road right now." 
Fox News (10/25, Stabile, 27.59M) reports on its website that Amesh Adalja, an infectious 
disease expert, on Sunday said Pence remains "at very high risk for developing coronavirus" 
and should "self-quarantine for 14 days based on the amount of people around him that are 
positive." 
Toluse Olorunnipa of the Washington Post said on CNN's Inside PoliticsVi (10/25, 1.11M), 
"This is the head of the White House coronavirus task force, openly flouting some of the 
guidelines and recommendations from the CDC, which essentially say that if you are in close 
contact with someone, at least out of abundance of caution, even if you test negative, you 
should not be traveling. You should not be spending a lot of time around other people. ... The 
fact is Vice president is openly flouting some of the recommendations is not a good message to 
send to people who are trying to actually get this virus under control." 
The Hill (10/25, Coleman, 2.98M), the Daily Beast (10/25, Baragona, 1.39M), and The 
Intelligencer (10/25, Danner, 1.1M) provide similar coverage. 
Fox News President, Several Anchors Advised To Quarantine After Exposure To 
Coronavirus. The Hill (10/25, Bowden, 2.98M) cites the New York Times in reporting that 
"numerous Fox News personalities including anchors Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum, as well 
as network president Jay Wallace, were reportedly advised to quarantine following their 
exposure last week to a person who tested positive Sunday for COVID-19." The Hill adds that 
while the Times "reported that the other personalities at the network advised to quarantine 
included two co-hosts of 'The Five,' Juan Williams and Dana Perino," a spokesperson for Fox 
News "declined to confirm to The Hill or the Times on the details of who, if anyone, was 
exposed, citing health privacy concerns." However, two sources "told the Times that the 
exposure occurred on a charter flight from Nashville to New York following the final presidential 
debate last week between President Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden (D)."
