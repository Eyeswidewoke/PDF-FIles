Very interesting experiment. It might tell us a lot about m=sical genres and their underlying 
structure, and the cognitive capacities =hat organize thought, creativity, and experience in these apparently 
human=specific ways. 
On blind children, you might want to look at t=e fascinating study by Landau and Gleitman on 
the language of the blind: <=>language and Experience: evidence from blind children (or something l=ke that). What is 
striking is that without visual experience, the bl=nd learn language virtually in parallel with sighted children, with the 
sa=e changes that plainly have to do with maturation and the very specific in=ernal concepts of human cognition, 
leading finally to understanding of ext=emely refined visual concepts, all with only minimal experience that can&ft=9;t 
be directing these developments any more than the nutrition of the emb=yo, while obviously necessary for 
development, can determine that we have = mammalian rather than visual system. There are also some quite 
intr=guing differences. E.g., at the age when sighted children acquire th= words/concepts see, look at, etc., blind 
children also do, but nec=ssarily give a tactile rather than visual interpretation. So for the=blind child, to look at 
something is to touch it, and to see it is to gras= what it is. The child is therefore surprised to find that its mothe= 
cannot see the back of the dolls they are holding, since the child can.=C24, Lots of results like these. 
What is particularly striki=g, however, is how similar the cognitive growth is to normal physical 
grow=h, of course elicited by experience but then substantially following its i=ternally determined path. The widely-held 
belief that cognitive deve=opment is somehow different from the rest of biology in that it is experie=ce-determined is, I 
think, a residue of traditional dualism -- a kind of &=uot;methodological dualism," which is, I think, more pernicious than 
=raditional metaphysical dualism, which, in fact, was quite serious and rea=onable science at the time. 
Long story.

symphonies 
begin with their first "=layer " a theme. in fact , there might be more than one theme in the first layer ,4>=A0 , the
