*Intimate Film Cultures* (Track S. C & MI What's intimate about cinema? And what 0 if anything 0 
is cinematic about intimacy? Within the framework of classical film theory, many of cinema's most 
Intimate devices (the dose-up• the kiss. the photographic trace. etc.) were Invested with 
redemptive potential, even deemed revolutionary by some for their capacity to counter modem 
alienation and repression. More recently however• cultural theorists have problematized such 
claims, analyzing how cinematic conventions work to structure intimate relations in accordance 
with normative ideologies. and suggesting that the aspiration for intimacy may itself be crucial to 
the operation of modern systems of power. Pairing classical and contemporary film theory with 
diverse contributions to the emerging field of 'intimacy studies' this course explores such issues 
by considering how problems of intimacy have organized critical and theoretical discourse on a 
range of Intimate film cultures, from Hollywood melodrama to queer cinema. French surrealism to 
Italian neorealism, and from underground film to contemporary diasporic cinema. [Track S, C & MI

importance. not produced in and for Hollywood. Beginning with the pioneering work of French 
filmmakers, and highlighting German Expressionism of the early 1920s, as well as Russian 
montage cinema of the late 1920s, the focus shifts to Latin America (Mexico and Argentina) as 
well as China and Japan In the 1930s and 1940s. After WW II. the course will consider the 
different 'new waves' in Westem Europe (Italian Neo-Realism. the French Nouvelle Vague, New 
German Cinema) and Eastern Europe (Poland, Czech Republic. Hungary), From the 1970s 
onwards, a politicised. anti- and post-colonial cinema emerges in parts of Latin America (Cuba. 
Argentina, Brazil) and Sub-Sahara Africa (Maio, Senegal. Ethiopia. Burkina Faso). which also 
reflects the increasing importance of intemational film festivals for world cinema. The 1980s 
witness a strong presence of Asian films (from Taiwan. South Korea and Hong Kong). while the 
1990s reflect the vitality of filmmaking in Mainland China. in Iran. as well as world-class directors 
in Spain and Mexico. With the arrival of digital media and the spread of globalised culture since 
the late 1990s. cinema everywhere has undergone such dramatic changes that the course will
