took to raise cash. according to interviews and regulatory flings. The 73-year-old founder of Wynn Resorts Ltd. 
said the arrangements pennit him to borrow at less than 1 percent. 
"This is a great time to be poised with ample cask" Wynn said in an c-mail through his spokesman. 
The favorable terms highlight the increasing competition in the market for art lending. where wealth managers are seeking to win

for an loans is typically three to five years. 
Treasuries due in 2020 yield about 139 basis points, or 1.39 percent.
