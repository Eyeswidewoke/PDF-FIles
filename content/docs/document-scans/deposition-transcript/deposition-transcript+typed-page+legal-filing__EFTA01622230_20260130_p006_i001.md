Benjamin Harnwell, Human Dignity Institute: Thank you, Steve. That was a fascinating, 
fascinating overview. I am particularly struck by your argument, then, that in fact, 
capitalism would spread around the world based on the Judeo-Christian foundation is, 
in fact, something that can create peace through peoples rather than antagonism, 
which is often a point not sufficiently appreciated. Before I turn behind me to take a 
question —
Bannon: One thing I want to make sure of, if you look at the leaders of capitalism at 
that time, when capitalism was I believe at its highest flower and spreading its benefits 
to most of mankind, almost all of those capitalists were strong believers in the Judeo-
Christian West. They were either active participants in the Jewish faith, they were active 
participants in the Christians' faith, and they took their beliefs, and the underpinnings 
of their beliefs was manifested in the work they did. And I think that's incredibly 
important and something that would really become unmoored. I can see this on Wall 
Street today — I can see this with the securitization of everything is that, everything is 
looked at as a securitization opportunity. People are looked at as commodities. I don't 
believe that our forefathers had that same belief. 
Harnwell: Over the course of this conference we've heard from various points of view 
regarding alleviation of poverty. We've heard from the center-left perspective, we've 
heard from the socialist perspective, we've heard from the Christian democrat, if you 
will, perspective. What particularly interests me about your point of view Steve, to talk 
specifically about your work, Breitbart is very close to the tea party movement. So I'm 
just wondering whether you could tell me about if in the current flow of contemporary 
politics — first tell us a little bit about Breitbart, what the mission is, and then tell me 
about the reach that you have and then could you say a little bit about the current 
dynamic of what's going on at the moment in the States. 
Bannon: Outside of Fox News and the Drudge Report, we're the third-largest 
conservative news site and, quite frankly, we have a bigger global reach than even Fox. 
And that's why we're expanding so much internationally. 
Look, we believe — strongly — that there is a global tea party movement. We've seen 
that. We were the first group to get in and start reporting on things like UKIP and Front 
National and other center right. With all the baggage that those groups bring — and 
trust me, a lot of them bring a lot of baggage, both ethnically and racially — but we 
think that will all be worked through with time. 
The central thing that binds that all together is a center-right populist movement of 
really the middle class, the working men and women in the world who are just tired of 
being dictated to by what we call the party of Davos. A group of kind of — we're not 
conspiracy-theory guys, but there's certainly — and I could see this when I worked at 
Goldman Sachs — there are people in New York that feel closer to people in London 
and in Berlin than they do to people in Kansas and in Colorado, and they have more of 
this elite mentality that they're going to dictate to everybody how the world's going to 
be run. 
I will tell you that the working men and women of Europe and Asia and the United 
States and Latin America don't believe that. They believe they know what's best for how 
they will comport their lives. They think they know best about how to raise their 
families and how to educate their families. So I think you're seeing a global reaction to 
centralized government, whether that government is in Beijing or that government is 
in Washington, DC, or that government is in Brussels. So we are the platform for the 
voice of that.
