Coupon 
The Coupon is paid quarterly and accrues at the applicable Coupon Rate. The Coupon payable will be computed on the basis of a 360-
day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. The Coupon Payment Dates are the 11" calendar day of each February, May, August and 
November, commencing on August 11, 2016, up to and including the Maturity Date. If any Coupon Payment Date falls on a day that is 
not a Business Day (including a Coupon Payment Date that is also the Maturity Date), the payment due on such Coupon Payment Date 
will be postponed to the immediately succeeding Business Day. In no event, however, will any additional interest accrue on the Notes 
as a result of any such postponement. For information regarding the record dates applicable to the Coupons paid on the Notes, please 
see the section entitled 'Description of Notes — Interest and Principal Payments — Recipients of Interest Payments" on page S-11 in the 
accompanying prospectus supplement. 
Payment When Offices or Settlement Systems Are Closed 
If any payment is due on the Notes on a day that would otherwise be a 'Business Day" but is a day on which the office of a paying agent 
or a settlement system is closed, we will make the payment on the next Business Day when that paying agent or system is open. Any 
such payment will be deemed to have been made on the original due date, and no additional payment will be made on account of the 
delay. 
Calculation Agent 
We or one of our affiliates will act as calculation agent with respect to the Notes.
