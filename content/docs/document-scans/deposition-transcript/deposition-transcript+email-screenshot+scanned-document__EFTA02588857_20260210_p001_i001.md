Re: 
Thank you for your email. It shows to me that we missundersta=d and misscommunikate eachother. I understand and 
respect that you have dif=erent views and ideas. You can evaluate my work as low as you want. Its int=rsting that 
regarding models you always say that you dont want to judge the=r behaviour, but its so easy for you to bring me down. 
I cannot agree with w=at you wrote though. I tried to fallow your directions. I really did. Not o=Iy assisting stuff. 
Regarding agency, irs and personal live. </=iv> I've heard ct=ticism before so i made some changes, hoping to not 
receive negative opinio= in the future. During last visit i acctually did type at my room, watched v=deo you've sent me, 
tried stretching positions, tried to learn different ma=sage techniques types, printed and read about biz ettiquette and 
calls. I w=s cooking, doing massage and facials for you as best as I could. I see that=this is not good enough and word 
"you are great" has no value. Its clear to=me that you are unhappy with my results. 
Perhaps i should reject your propositions of e=tertaiment too.. Also i cant agree that "beauty" is so important to me. It 
i=n't... I have other priorities in my live. 
There are other things I missundersto=d like africa, singing cd or even earlier - school? I'm not gonna ask for t=at 
nomore, I'm not gonna ask for anything, but its appears to me that it wo=ld never happen anyway. 
I'm sorry to write all this, but you told me that being honest=is very important... 
I am your friend. Thank you for that, thank you for great time an= everything... 
A=I best,
