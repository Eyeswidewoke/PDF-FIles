E. Assignment 
This Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of you and the Bank and the Bank's successors and 
permitted assigns. You may not assign, sublicense, pledge or transfer any of your rights or obligations under 
this Agreement to any other person or entity. We may assign one or more of our obligations and/or this 
Agreement to others, including independent contractors or third parties or any future direct or indirect affiliate. 
F. No Waiver 
The Bank shall not be deemed to have waived any of its rights or remedies hereunder unless such waiver is in 
writing and signed by the Bank. No delay or omission on the part of the Bank in exercising any rights or 
remedies shall operate as a waiver of such rights or remedies or any other rights or remedies. A waiver on any 
one occasion shall not be construed as a bar or waiver of any rights or remedies on future occasions. 
G. Captions 
The captions of sections hereof are for convenience only and shall not control or affect the meaning or 
construction of any of the provisions of this Agreement. 
H. Governing Law 
This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with federal law and (to the extent not 
preempted) the laws of the State of New York, without regard to its conflicts of laws provisions other than 
Section 5-1401 of the New York General Obligations Law, and any dispute arising out of or relating to the 
subject matter of this Agreement shall be decided in accordance with such law. You agree to submit to the 
exclusive jurisdiction and venue of state or federal court of competent jurisdiction located in the State of New 
York, City and County of New York over any dispute arising out of this Agreement, and you agree that such 
courts are convenient forums. You waive personal service of process and consent that service of process upon 
you may be made by certified mail or registered mail, return receipt requested, or by any reputable 
overnight delivery service (such as Federal Express or DHL) directed to you or at your address on the Bank's 
records. You hereby waive any objection you may have in any such action based on lack of personal 
jurisdiction, improper venue or inconvenient forum. YOU AND WE HEREBY WAIVE THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY 
JURY IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT Of OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SUBJECT MATTER 
OF THIS AGREEMENT, AND EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE SPECIFICALLY PROVIDED HEREIN, ANY RIGHT TO 
SEEK OR ENFORCE PAYMENT OF ATTORNEYS' FEES. 
I. Electronic Mail 
i. 
Public email transmissions may not be secure. We request that you do not send us or ask for personal, 
confidential or sensitive information via any general or public email system. You agree that we may 
respond to your email communications by use of the Internet Banking Service email feature with regard 
to matters related to the Internet Banking Service. 
ii. 
While access to the Bank through the email function of the Internet Banking Services is "online," 
messages sent to the Bank through email are not reviewed by Bank personnel immediately after they are 
sent. Rather, Bank personnel will review email messages periodically throughout each business day. If 
immediate attention is required, you must contact the Bank by telephone or in person or through some 
other procedure not using the Internet Banking Services. Your email messages may be acted upon by the 
Bank if received in a manner and in a time providing the Bank a reasonable opportunity to act. 
Nevertheless, unless otherwise provided herein, email messages will not serve as a substitute for any 
requirement imposed on you to provide the Bank with "written" notice. 
J. Notices 
Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, any notice or other communication required or permitted to be 
given under this Agreement shall be written and delivered, or sent by United States registered or certified mail, 
postage prepaid, or by express carrier, to your address as it appears on the Bank's computer file: OR. if to the 
Bank, addressed to: Deutsche Bank, Banking Service Team, 345 Park Avenue, Mail Stop NYC20-1409, New 
York, NY 10154; unless another address is substituted by notice delivered or sent as provided herein. Except as 
otherwise expressly provided herein, any such notice shall be deemed given when sent or received by the 
Bank. 
K. Severability 
If any provision herein, or part thereof, is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable to any extent by a court or 
government agency of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of the Agreement, or other parts or applications of 
such provisions, shall not be affected thereby and shall remain enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by 
law. 
L. No Third Party Beneficiaries 
Nothing in this Agreement is intended to confer any right, remedy or claim upon any person, firm or 
corporation other than the parties hereto and all members of the Deutsche Bank Group and their Service 
Providers (each such member and Service Provider being an intended third party beneficiary of your 
representations, warranties and agreements herein).
