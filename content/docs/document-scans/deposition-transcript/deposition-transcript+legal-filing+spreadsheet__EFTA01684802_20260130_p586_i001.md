How Rates and Fees Work 
Calculating 
APRs and DPRs 
The Annual Percentage Rate (APR) for variable rates is determined by adding an amount (margin) 
to the Prime Rate (see Determining the Prime Rate in Part 2). The Daily Periodic Rate (DPR) is 
1/365th of the APR, rounded to one ten-thousandth of a percentage point.

months being reviewed. 
• your payment is returned by your bank. 
Penalty APR for 
existing balances 
If you do not pay at least the Minimum Payment Due within 60 days after its Payment Due Date, we 
can apply the penalty APR to those balances it does not already apply to. After you pay on time for 
6 billing periods in a row, the penalty APR will no longer apply to those balances (but it may still 
apply to other balances as described above).
