Does wishing me well me=ns not taking any news from me at all ? Here is a little 
brief of what hap=ened to me in the last month and this period that you've "wished =e well" : I saw my grandmother 
dying in front of me ( one of the most=painful things I've ever experienced ), dealing with doctors, funerals= had to 
move tones of stuff alone from my house without knowin= where to go and still now sleeping on a coach without a 
room on my own ( =y mother rented my room for a year in Rome so I don't even have a real=home where to go ) 
Working 12h per day as a babysitter in order to earn so=e money because it's the only paying job I found without a 
degree afte= asking everyone I knew. In addition trying to keep up with the photograph=r.. I promise I'm trying my best 
to be strong and stay positive but ma=aging all this alone at 20 years old with no moral support and a broken he=rt is 
hard, specially after I've loved you so much with every part of =yself and still do now... (I guess this is the reason you've 
pushed me=away). Anyways I don't want to whine but just let you know that even i= this hard situation I'm doing the 
best I can to grow and survive. I l=ve you

sorrry, do you think this is =ome type of threat to me. ! . I wish you wel=. at 
least for now. . so sending me multiple emails ( wh=ch i have just seen ) or messages. is not in your intere=t. You find 
yourself in the position that is a result of your own ac=ions. - no more no less. I am confident that you will fi=d a path 
on your own. i remind you that if i receive on= more bad email , you will not speak to me for ONE YEAR. 40=A0 . 
Im sure you will find work
