I have full confidence in your advice when it comes to business„ and sex. That I welcome and eagerly 
follow without hesitation. But the same authority and expertise doesn't transfer into relationships or 
psychology and you can't force people to follow it with the same abandon. I always consider your view 
but I have to make my own choices when it comes to my personal life. You have never given me a 
compelling reason why moving from NYC would be in my advantage. You actually tell girls to never leave 
a city because of their ex-boyfriend so I have no urge to do so. I feel happy every time I walk into my 
apartment that I put a lot of hard work into designing and maintaining, I feel safe here, my friends are 
here, my company is here, there are countless opportunities and my sex life is here. If you take all that 
away and put me alone in a strange place with nothing but an average job I could have here too, where 
is the positive? I can't even fathom the implications of such pointless move, I am in no place to handle it 
well and I fail to see any advantage, that's why I have no intentions to leave. 
The right thing to do would be to guide me in building a business that will challenge, motivate and 
enable me to lead the life I choose to build, with substantial direct responsibility and measurable results 
for my actions. We have tested the theory of responsibility, leadership and accountability through flying 
and any of my instructors, copilots, emergency passengers and employees would tell you I have done 
extremely well in a short period of time. You are the only person I know who somehow has a different 
view of my abilities. As a result of years of discouragement I now have a lot to prove to myself, and 
clearly to you, and I can't do that by settling for ordinary and following the path everyone else does. I 
get bored easily and will never do well in a situation where my potential is not used fully, so that is not 
really an option... For the record, this is not where I "end up", this is where I begin.

I leave tomorrow for two to three weeks. 
thank you for your kind words.. the solution as you 
put it , is for you to get a job. a new place to live , and begin to lead an life that entails 
contributing as opposed to merely consuming. the tough problem as you put it , is your adherence 
to misplaced and exagcrratcd expectations. what is the soltuion to that. .? find you a boyfriedn? 
find you a trainer ( whoops ). how do i get you to understand that it is the prison of your ideas 
that holds you back „
