In short, predictio=s of a Water World War are overwrought. However, tensions over water usage=can still 
exacerbate other existing regional conflicts. Climate change is expected to intensify droughts, floods, and o=her extreme 
weather conditions that jeopardize freshwater quantity and qua=ity and therefore act as a threat-multiplier, making 
shaky regions shakier= 
So what river basin= constitute the biggest risks today? In a World Bank report</=pan> <http://bit.ly/NGXAO7> 
[2] we published in 2010 (as well as a subsequent article in a special iss=e of the Journal of Peace Research 
chttp://bit.ly/RwrJ7l> [3]) we analyzed the physical effects of climate change on international r=vers. We modeled the 
variability in river annual runoff in the past and fo= future climate scenarios. We also considered the existence and 
nature of =he institutional capacity around river basins, in the form of international water treaties, to potentially =eal 
with the effects of climate change. 
According to our re=earch, 24 of the world's 276 international river basins are already experi=ncing increased 
water variability. These 24 basins, which collectively serve about 332 million people, are at high =isk of water related 
political tensions. The majority of the basins are lo=ated in northern and sub-Saharan Africa. A few others are located in 
the M=ddle East, south-central Asia, and South America. They include the Tafna (Algeria and Morocco), the Dasht=(Iran 
and Pakistan), the Congo (Central Africa), Lake Chad (Central Africa=, the Niger (Western Africa), the Nile (Northeastern 
Africa), and the Chir= (Ecuador and Peru). There are no strong treaties governing the use of these water reserves in 
tense terr=tories. Should conflicts break out, there are no good mechanisms in place =or dealing with them. 
By 2050, an additio=al 37 river basins, serving 83 million people, will be at high risk for fe=ding into political 
tensions. As is the case currently, a large portion of these are in Africa. But, unlike today, rive= basins within Central Asia, 
Eastern Europe, Central Europe, and Central A=erica will also be at high risk within 40 years. Some of these include 
the=Kura-Araks (Iran, Turkey, and the Caucasus), the Neman (Eastern Europe) Asi-Orontes (Lebanon, Syria, Turkey)= and 
the Catatumbo Basins (Colombia and Venezuela).</=> 
CROSSING THE NILE</=ont> 
Among the larger Af=ican basins, the Nile has the greatest implications for regional and globa= security. 
Tensions over access to the river already pit Ethiopia and Egypt, two important Western allies, against one =nother. 
Egypt has been a major player in the Middle East Peace Process and=Ethiopia is an important regional force in the Horn 
of Africa, currently a=ding other African forces to battle Al-Shabbab in Somalia. 
Over the years, a n=mber of international water treaties have made rules for the basin, but th=y are largely 
limited to small stretches of it. In particular, only Egypt and Sudan are party to the 1959 Nile Rive= Agreement, the 
principal treaty regarding the river. Egypt, which is the =urthest downstream yet is one of the most powerful countries in 
the region= has been able to heavily influence the water-sharing regime. Upstream countries, such as Ethiopia and 
Burundi= have been left out, hard-pressed to harness the Nile for their own needs. 
In 1999, with incre=singly vitriolic rhetoric between Egypt and Ethiopia sidetracking regional=development, the 
World Bank stepped up its involvement in the basin. It helped create a network of professional water=managers as well 
as a set of investments in a number of sub-basins. Still,=the drafting of a new agreement stalled: upstream countries 
would not comp=omise on their right to develop water infrastructure while downstream countries would not 
compromise on pr=tecting their shares. In 2010, Ethiopia signed an agreement with a number =f the other upstream 
countries hoping to balance against Egypt and Sudan. =ore recently, the country has also announced plans to construct a 
number of large upstream dams, which could =ffect the stability of the region. 
By 2050, the enviro=mental state of the Nile Basin will be even worse. That is why it is impor=ant to create a 
robust and equitable water treaty now. Such a treaty would focus on ways to harness the river's hydro=ower potential 
to satiate the energy needs of all the riparian states whil= maintaining ecosystem health. The construction of dams and 
reservoirs fur=her upstream could likewise help even out water flows and facilitate agricultural growth. Projects such as
