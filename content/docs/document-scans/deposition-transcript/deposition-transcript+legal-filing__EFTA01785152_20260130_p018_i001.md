Grayling: However much economics tries to portray itself as value-neutral it isn=92t, because another thing you're 
concerned about is that economics assumes that consenting adults are the party to th=se deals they make with one 
another. So if I want you to advertise my book=and I pay you enough to have it written on your forehead, that would be 
an=example where the question of analysis would be, "is the person renting out their forehead coerced by their 
eco=omic circumstances?" This is something that makes you anxious. 
Sandel: 
But I also worry on another, independent ground. Even if it i= voluntary rather than through economic desperation, 
there is the question=of whether the tattoo ad on the forehead is degrading. It's a question that arises classically in 
debates about p=ostitution. There's the worry about coercion, or implicit coercion. But =ven if that objection is met 
there's still the question of whether it'= morally objectionable because it's degrading. 
Grayling: Paying somebody to wait in line for you, for example, for a congression=l hearing. This doesn't do anyone any 
harm and this is someone who might need some money. Certainly, people who are d=awn into sex work, that's 
troubling—but it's not always easy to draw=a line. Drawing a line involves some kind of value judgement and then the 
=nevitable question arises: whose values? And I take it part of your answer is that it's got to be our values, tha= 
somehow we have to reinvigorate a conversation in society about what's =cceptable and what isn't. The big question is, 
how the heck do we do tha=? 
Sandel: 
The objection to paid line standing does involve the degradat=on argument, the idea of it being demeaning, but not 
necessarily in the ca=e of it being demeaning of the person who has the job. Here it's different from the tattoo or the 
surrogate mo=her. It's demeaning of the institution of the government that allows thi= kind of ticket touting to govern 
access to Congress or Parliament or the =upreme Court. It's demeaning of representative government to put access up 
for auction in this way.<=p> 
We've seen these long queues where people pay for someone t= get them the first new iPad or iPhone. I think that's 
different, becaus= that's a commercial product. You'll then say, "OK but that restates precisely the question as it's a 
value judg=ment." I agree it is and you rightly want to know whose judgement should=govern. I would say ours, but the 
hard question is how should we reflect o= those values? 
If we take the arguments from degradation or corruption serio=sly, as I think we have to if we are to define the moral 
limits of markets= we have to reason together in public about the right way to value goods, whether the goods at stake 
are the int=grity and dignity of the human person or the proper way of governing acces= to institutions that represent 
government. 
Grayling: There's an obvious connection between your interest in the concept of=justice and these issues. Questions 
about what's just have always been front and centre of the great moral argumen=s. What do you take those forms of 
justice to be? Is it distributive or is=it some other conception? 
Sandel= Justice is an important virtue of social institutions. I don't think it=92s the only virtue—there are other virtues to 
do with community, fellow feeling, solidarity, self-government, the sco=e for and the quality of public deliberation, all of 
which may have some b=aring on justice, but which may also have independent moral importance. 
Part of my argument in the book on justice and the book on ma=kets is that we can't entirely discuss these sets of 
questions independe=tly of one another. What counts as a good society unavoidably embroils us in questions of virtue 
and the good life. =t can't altogether be separated from whether the distribution of incomin= wealth and power and 
opportunity in that society is fair, even recognisin= that fairness isn't the only thing that matters.
