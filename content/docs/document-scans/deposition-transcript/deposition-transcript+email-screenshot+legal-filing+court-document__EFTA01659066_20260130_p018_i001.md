in Oklahoma City." Court records say that the pair "are both accused of sex trafficking two 
teenagers, one age 15 and the other age 16." The investigation began after the victims' 
pictures "were found on an ad placed on a well-known prostitution website." 
FINANCIAL CRIME & CORPORATE SCANDALS 
DO] Announces $8.3B Purdue Settlement Over Opt°ids Distribution. 
On ABC World News TonightVi (10/21, story 5, 2:10, Muir, 6.08M), Adrienne Bankert reported, 
"It's being hailed by the federal government as a major victory against a company, whose drug, 
Oxycontin, is part of the public health crisis of opioid addiction that has led to the deaths of 
hundreds of thousands of Americans. Purdue Pharma pleading guilty to felony charges of 
defrauding federal health agencies and violating federal kickback laws for inducing doctors to 
prescribe those powerful opioids." The company has agreed "to pay $8.3 billion in penalties," 
though "multiple states are still suing." Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey (D) said, 
"No one's going to jail, no one's going to prison, and worse yet, they've set up a situation 
where Purdue's going to be able to continue on." The deal "has to be approved by a judge, but 
the Department of Justice says that money will go to redressing past wrongs as well as new 
programs for treatment and care for those struggling through opioid addiction." 
The CBS Evening NewsVi (10/21, story 9, 0:20, O'Donnell, 4.55M) reported, "The 
company that makes Oxycontin has agreed to plead guilty to criminal charges related to how it 
marketed the drug. Purdue Pharma will pay $8 billion to resolve claims. Some of that money 
will go towards treating opioid addiction. Purdue still faces criminal probes in several states." 
Kate Snow of NBC Nightly NewsVi (10/21, story 6, 1:40, Holt, 5.81M) reported the 
settlement is "the most dramatic effort yet by the federal government to hold a drug maker 
accountable for the more than 450,000 American deaths from opioid addiction," but "critics say 
with Purdue in bankruptcy, it is unlikely the company will ever really pay $8 billion." Healey 
said, "It was clear the Department of Justice wanted to make a deal and make an 
announcement before the election, and they ended up making a lousy deal. It doesn't bring 
justice, it doesn't bring accountability." 
The New York Times (10/21, Al, Hoffman, Benner, 18.61M) reports that on Wednesday, 
the Justice Department announced that Purdue Pharma "has agreed to plead guilty to criminal 
charges and face penalties of roughly $8.3 billion for its role in the opioids epidemic." According 
to the Times, "The settlement could pave the way for a resolution of thousands of lawsuits 
brought against the company for its role in a public health crisis that has killed more than 
450,000 Americans since 1999." The Times says Purdue's "owners, members of the wealthy 
Sackler family, have agreed to pay $225 million in civil penalties," but "prosecutors said the 
agreement did not preclude the filing of criminal charges against Purdue executives or 
individual Sacklers." 
The AP (10/21, Balsamo, Mulvihill) reports that Purdue Pharma is "the company behind 
the powerful prescription painkiller OxyContin that experts say helped touch off an opioid 
epidemic." As does the limes, the AP reports that that "the deal does not release any of the 
company's executives or owners....from criminal liability." The AP says "a criminal investigation 
is ongoing." Nevertheless, according to the AP, "some state attorneys general said the 
agreement fails to hold the Sacklers accountable." 
Reuters (10/21, Spector) reports, "Soon after a Purdue Pharma LP affiliate pleaded guilty 
to misbranding its addictive opioid painkiller OxyContin in 2007, the company's Sackler family 
owners fretted about possible threats to their wealth" in emails disclosed by US prosecutors on 
Wednesday. The company "transferred more than $10 billion, including roughly $4 billion in 
cash to Sackler-controlled entities" between 2008 and 2009, though "family members on 
Wednesday said the transfers were proper and that documents scheduled to be released in the
