I forwarded a request to Jeffrey Maddox, Office of Telecommunications Security 
and requested a log of card swipes for Ryan at Reynolds Hall on 1/11/06. 
Because Ryan's father mentioned 
had a criminal history, I had 
Communications Officer Harbin conduct a criminal history check. No criminal 
record was located on 
On 1/23/06 I received a voice mossy e from Ryan's father, Mr. John Ryan 
requesting I contact him at 
At approximately 2:30 p.m. I made 
contact with J. Ryan via telephone. J. Ryan asked about the case and I informed 
him the case would be referred to the Office of Student Rights and 
Responsibilities when it was closed. J. Ryan asked about the trespass warning 
issued to his son and said he authorized me to issue him one if she was also 
issued one. I explained that he did not need to give authorization for me to issue 
his son a trespass warning. J. Ryan asked why she was not issued one. I 
explained that his son has not given me any reason to issue her one. J. Ryan 
said it appeared that I automatically assumed his son is guilty. I told him that is 
not the case, that his son has refused to provide his account of events. I 
explained his son could provide a statement, allow us to examine his computer 
and provide me with his cellular phone records so we can determine If what Alex 
said is true. J. Ryan said he Informed his son not to provide a statement. J. 
Ryan said that I should know that lawyers advise their clients not to make 
statements to the police. I informed J. Ryan if his son is innocent It would make 
more sin gt etiLhim to speak with me and provide his accounts. J. Ryan asked if I 
checked 
background. I explained I had a criminal history check conducted 
and it revealed no criminal history. J. Ryan said he knows there was an incident 
at the Wellington Mall one to two years ago. J. Ryan said I needed to call 
secudtv at the mall and ask them about the incident. J. Ryan gave me a number 
of 
for security and the name of Chuck Barr. I asked J. 
Ryan if the Wellington Mall was in Palm Beach County. He said It was. I 
Informed him I checked the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office's on-line booking 
information and she was not listed es being arrested in that county. J. Ryan said 
use to work at Victoria's Secret and left in November. J. Ryan said her 
leaving was related to substantial losses or something in that line. J. Ryan said I 
need to ask her about when she worked for her boyfriend's business. J. Ryan 
asked if I asked 
about the 45 year old and massages. I told him no, that it 
did not matter and I was not concerned with any of it. J. Ryan stated it has to do 
with veracity and if I check I will see she Is not truthful. I explained to J. Ryan that 
his son's girlfriend said his son lied to her. J. Ryan told me to ask=about 
Victoria Secret, the 45 year old male and working for her boyfriends business. J. 
Ryan told me again to cal the mall security. I told J. Ryan I was not concerned 
with any of that and it had no relevance in this case. I explained that even if she 
had a criminal history it would have no bearing on this case and I was not going
