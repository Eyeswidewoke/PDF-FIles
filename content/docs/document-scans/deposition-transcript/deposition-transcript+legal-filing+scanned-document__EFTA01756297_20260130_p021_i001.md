<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:18.0pt">A scenario of endle=s conflict is plausible. Yet there are 
glimmerings. Repressive systems hav= survived but mind-sets have changed. The young people of the region (the =edian 
age in Egypt, where nearly one 
quarter of all Arabs live, is 25) will not return to a state of submission= They have tasted what it is to bring change 
through protest. As in Iran, =here the deep reformist current was crushed in 2009 only to resurface in 2=13, these 
currents run deep and 
will reemerge.</span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:18.0pt">Here in Turkey, the=closest approximation to a liberal order in a 
Middle Eastern Muslim state =xists. That is the region's core challenge: finding a model that reconci=es Islam and 
modernity, religion with 
nonsectarian statehood. So it is worth recalling that Turkey's democracy=is the fruit of 90 years of violent back-and-
forth since Mustafa Kemal Ata=urk founded the Republic in 1923, and imposed a Western culture.</span></p= 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:18.0pt">Only over the past =ecade, with the arrival in power of Recep 
Tayyip Erdogan, has the idea tak=n hold that Islam is compatible with a liberal order. For many secular Tur=s the swing 
of the pendulum has been 
excessive. The protests at Gezi Park this summer were about Erdogan's in=asion in the name of Islam of Turks' personal 
lives. This was democratic=pushback from Turkey's secular coast against the conservative Anatolian 
=eartland.</span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:18.0pt">If in Turkey it has=taken 90 years for a democracy to evolve that 
is not anti-Islamic, then th= 30 months since the Arab Spring are a mere speck in time. Moreover, as Mu=tafa Akyol 
points out in his book "Islam 
Without Extremes," Turkey, unlike most other Muslim countries, was never=colonized, with the result that political 
Islam did not take on a virulent=anti-Western character. It was not a violent reaction against being the We=t's lackey, as 
in Iran.</span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:18.0pt">Now Iran, under its=new president, Hassan Rouhani, is trying 
again to build moderation into it= theocracy and repair relations with the West. Such attempts have failed i= the past. 
But the Middle Eastern future 
will look very different if the U.S. Embassy in Tehran — symbol of the v=olent entry into the American consciousness of 
the Islamic radical — reo=ens and the Islamic Republic becomes a freer polity.</span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:18.0pt">Nothing inherent to=lslam makes it anti-Western. History has. 
The Islamic revolution was an as=ertion of ideological independence from the West. As power in the world sh=fts away 
from the West, this idea has 
run its course. Iranians are drawn to America.</span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:18.0pt">The United States c=n have cordial relations with Iran just as it 
does with China, while disag=eeing with it on most things. A breakthrough would demonstrate that the vi=ious circles of 
the Middle East can 
be broken.</span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:18.0pt">l believe the U.S. =mbassy in Tehran will reopen within five years 
because the current impasse=has become senseless. With Iran inside the tent rather than outside, anyth=ng would be 
possible, even an Israeli-Palestinian 
peace.</span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:18.0pt">If Arabs could see =n Israel not a Zionist oppressor but the 
region's most successful econom=, a modern state built in 65 years, they would pose themselves the right q=estions 
about openness, innovation and 
progress. Israel, in turn, by getting out of the business of occupation an= oppression, could ensure its future as a Jewish 
and democratic state.</sp=n></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:18.0pt">There is another fu=ure for the Middle East, one glimpsed during 
the Arab Spring, but first it=must be dragged from the insistent clutches of the past.</span></p>
