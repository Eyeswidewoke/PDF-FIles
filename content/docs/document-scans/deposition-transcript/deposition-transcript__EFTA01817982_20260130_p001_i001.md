i do not want to argue with ou.. I don't consider dana worth talking about. I have no feelings

 „ she is like= i needed help, thats it no more. no less, . i have a monstrous 
amount of work in progress. I have asked for your help . . the garage is a pigstye. I am no 
further ahead with landscape lights, dock, statue base, the house has dog shit and piss,I have 
cleaned it up myself I , and not challenged you. I went through kitchen and house things 
without you , in an effort not to embarass you. especaillly in front of others. since before 
left on her vacation. you wanted authoriity , no food, flowers, facial, helper, / i love 
you, and want you to be happy. I need help to reduce my workload, I think you should re 
read your emails to me. I asked you to set aside time to talLyou chose not
 brice 
valdsonn and jojo, need to brought in to help , maybe= to try out. l=to do local 
things. kichen doors, etc. As I have tried to explain , an agreement has two parties, you 
have chosen not to fulfill your part, it is your prerogative, besides making soups, which were 
great , as you followed the recipe, (a discipline that you abhor ) , healthy snacks, low 
cholesterol, food, house projects , I made a point not to argue, it has become silly I get 
angry, and nothing changes, therefore taking getting angry out of the equation seems to make 
sense, I have asked that you have a budget, it allows you to sec what you spend and on what. 
it is also a reflection of what actually gets done. you have chosen not to do it. no problem.. I 
love you , so what am i to do? „ I need time to get my life in order , I would have hoped 
having you here would reduce my load ( not that load ). instead of adding stress and 
conflicts.
