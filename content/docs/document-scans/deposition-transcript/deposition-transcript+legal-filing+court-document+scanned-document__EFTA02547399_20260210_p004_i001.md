Subject: Carol S. Chomsky Marital Trusts - Distribution 
Deborah — 
I'm following up on our conversation on Tuesday about princip=l distributions to Noam from the Carol S. Chomsky 
marital trusts. Pl=ase consider the following: 
1. 
As I stated to you and as I now affirm to=you in writing, I am certain that in the exercise of my discretionary powe= 
to make distributions of principal from the trusts I'm entitled to inquire into Noam's financial circumstances, 
including=(a) the nature and extent of his resources, (b) his sources of income, and=(c) his expenditures. In fact, I'm 
equally certain that my f=duciary duty to Noam requires me to obtain that information so as to adequately address h=s 
long-term needs and to ensure that the trust is used for his exclusive b=nefit during his lifetime. (I am mindful of the 
interests of Noam =80 s children, as residuary beneficiaries of the trusts, and of my fiduciary duty to them as well, but as 
l'=e stated to you previously, my primary concern has been and continues to b= Noam's interests.) 
<1=> 
2. 
Having previously been assured (prior to =aking tax payments on Noam's behalf at the end of 2015 and in earl= 
2016) that Noam would engage in a financial planning process with Nick Nichols, and having notified you at the time that 
I did not inte=d to make any further principal distributions until that process was compl=ted, I informed you on Tuesday 
that I was not prepared to make any princip=l distributions to Noam now. On further reflection, and mindful of Noam's 
distress, I've r=considered the circumstances and am willing to make the proposed $150,000 =ayment to the IRS on his 
behalf, provided that you will (a) urge Noam to e=gage in a financial planning process (with Nick Nichols or another 
financial professional of his choosing), (b) urge=Noam to cooperate in providing some information to me about his 
financial =esources, income and expenses (to a degree mutually acceptable), and (c) i=press upon Noam the fact that 
though I am now making another tax payment from the trust on his behalf, I do so =ith no intention of making further 
distributions of principal unless he co=pletes the financial planning and disclosure process that was agreed upon =n 
2015. 
3. 
Lastly, with respect to my trusteeship, l=have suggested to Harry Chomsky that I prepare a short list of qualified, 
=rofessional trustees for his consideration and for Noam's. It is my hope that one of those candidates would be 
acceptable to Harry an= to Noam (with your recommendation). This seems to me a good approach, giv=n that Harry has 
unequivocally declared his unwillingness to appoint Rich =ahn as my successor. Needless to say, if you'd like to suggest 
another approach to finding a suc=essor to me I will be glad to discuss it with Harry.<=p> 
<1=> 
If you are in agreement with the points set out above, please reply a=knowledging each of them and please also affirm 
that (as was the case with=respect to the 2015 and 2016 tax payments) you have no objection to my direct payment of 
funds to the IRS, as an expedient and permissible =eans to expedite that payment (instead of having me arrange for the 
distri=ution of the funds to Noam's personal account for subsequent payme=t to the IRS). Lastly, please ask Noam's
