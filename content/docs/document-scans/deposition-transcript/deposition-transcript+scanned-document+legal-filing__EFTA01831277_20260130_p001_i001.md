Subject: thoughts 
okay a few things - which, to upholding a new years resolution, i will try to be as succinct as 
possible in conveying... 
i didn't realize you wanted the writing yet (about axel, i am assuming) since i need the recording 
you have of the interview to really do that. i thought i asked you for this before. how can i 
facilitate this? 
i also wanted to talk to you before starting to write (why i was trying to get a 
hold of you starting on the 19th) b/c i came away from the interview with some ideas that i 
wanted you to okay about both the global direction for all the interviews and thus the specific 
tone/process for the writing. Here is an outline of my thoughts and what i feel i/we need to 
establish, though i do believe this is better had as a conversation. 
my basic thought (which would really, really help SEO stuff and have both scientific and financial 
value) is that we use these interviews for your science website -- a NEW one that is actually 
interesting and engaging and visually pleasing. Components of this website that i foresee are: 
• an interactive/graphical visualization of topics and people/scientists that highlights 
dynamic and interesting connections. we do this with Seed (the visualization part - i don't 
want to write about graphics here so we can discuss this in person with a pad and pen). 
o the topics/broad ideas: i've noticed what seem to be motifs in your thoughts (these 
things could have small descriptions of YOUR big ideas and link to ways you discuss 
them with certain scientists). for instance (not an all-inclusive list): 
• money (duh, but what should be funded in your eyes, what would other 
players fund, what should the UN investigate, what could inform, teach, enable 
(and also blow smoke up the butts of) your current clients 
• altruism, society (not in the saving it way, though i don't think you should shy away from cool 
stuff that might have positive side effects) 
• beauty, elegance 
• memory, longevity, evolution (maybe even sex), competition 
• cryptography 
• software capabilities 
• intuition 
o the people: the scientists and the topics are linked and dynamic. interviews are 
embedded in the site. now, after the Axel interview i felt that there needs to be some 
PEER REVIEW on some of the ideas you bring up in the interviews - i.e., i need to 
talk to the interviewees WITHOUT you in the room afterwards. it's not that i don't 
think they tell you the truth about your ideas, i just think it's hard to really extract 
which ones are the most worthwhile when they are so ballistic and forthcoming 
(which is a beautiful aspect of how your brain processes, but sometimes some ideas 
arc based on grand assumptions which- although they arc viable possibilities- might 
not demonstrate as convincing an understanding of the underlying science that some 
of your ideas do convey).
