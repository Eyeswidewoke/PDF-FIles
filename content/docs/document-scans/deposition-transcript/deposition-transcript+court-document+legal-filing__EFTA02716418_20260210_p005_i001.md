There will be no need to wait for an entity to be dis=olved before the next step can be taken. It should therefore be 
possible t= complete the steps fairly quickly. 
We hold the register of members for the LLP and this =as not been updated to reflect Phaidon Global LLC and JMWT 
Manager LLC bec=ming members of the LLP and PLB LLC and JMWT LLC ceasing to be members, as we were not aware 
of the transfer of partner=hip interests. We have also checked the public registers and note that the=public registers do 
not reflect the change in the membership of the LLP. A= an initial step, it will therefore be necessary to pass ratification 
resolutions of the LLP members to confir= the membership of the LLP and update the registers accordingly. If Phaido= 
Global LLC and JMWT Manager LLC can be included as members from now (rath=r than ratifying historic membership), 
this will be a much easier (and preferable) process. Have Phaidon Global L=C and JMWT Manager LLC taken any action as 
members of the LLP to date? 
We have based the steps on the following assumptions:=/span> 
* &n=sp; the LLP, Topco and Midco have no liabilities (they have given no guar=ntees, entered into no contracts, 
there are no loan arrangements in place =intra-group or otherwise) and they have no creditors); 
• &n=sp; the share capital of Topco exceeds the value of the Midco shares by a= least £1 (this will enable us to 
reduce the capital of Topco, leaving =A31 of capital to create sufficient distributable profits to enable the shares of 
Midco to be transferred to the LLCs as a d=vidend in specie); 
• &n=sp; the share capital of Midco exceeds the value of the JMWT shares by at=least El; 
* &n=sp; the LLP, Topco and Midco have no assets other than the shares of Topc=, Midco and JMWT (respectively); 
* &n=sp; accounts/balance sheets of Topco and Midco will be provided to show t=e assets and liabilities of Topco 
and Midco before each company reduces it= share capital, and also an updated balance sheet will be provided following 
completion of the capital reduction. It i= possible to just have accounts/balance sheets for the position following =he 
capital reduction, but as the directors will have personal liability fo= the solvency statements they make in connection 
with the capital reduction, it is preferable for them to hav= accounts/balance sheets to refer to at the time the solvency 
statements a=e made; 
• &n=sp; accounts/a balance sheet will be provided for the LLP to show the ass=ts and liabilities of the LLP at the 
time of the distribution of assets to=the members; 
* &n=sp; the LLP Agreement dated 3 October 2012 was signed;<=p> 
* &n=sp; JMWT Manager LLC entered into a deed of adherence to the LLP Agreemen= (we have seen the deed of 
adherence signed by Phaidon Global LLC); and 
* &n=sp; the members confirmed the termination of membership of PLB, LLC and J=WT LLC as members of the LLP 
(in addition to transferring interests in the=partnership to the incoming members which is included in the 
"reorganization agreement").</=>
