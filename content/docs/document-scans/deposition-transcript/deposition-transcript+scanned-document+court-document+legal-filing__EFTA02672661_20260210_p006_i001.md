In a story recounted several times by Dennis Edwards,(17) though refuted by Otis Williams and 
Temptations road manager Don Foster, after several of these stunts, the positive audience reactions 
and a remorseful Ruffin's pleas to be let back into the act convinced the other Temptations to do so. Otis 
Williams informed the then still-new Edwards that the group would lay him off and rehire Ruffin while in 
Gaithersburg, Maryland. However, when Ruffin failed to show up on time for the next night for his 
"return" engagement, Edwards was kept on, and the prospect of rehiring Ruffin ceased to be 
entertained. 
After Gaithersburg, Ruffin stopped attempting to bogart the Temptations' concerts and instead turned 
his attention to the Motown offices back in Detroit. He sued Motown in October 1968, seeking a release 
from the label, but Motown countersued to keep the singer from leaving and the case was eventually 
settled out of court. The settlement required Ruffin to remain with Motown as a solo artist to finish out 
his initial contract. 
Edwards' first album with the Temptations was Live at the Copa, recorded at the group's return to the 
Copacabana nightclub. The year 1968 also saw the debut of the first of a number of collaborations for 
the Temptations with Diana Ross & the Supremes. The results included two studio albums: 1968's Diana 
Ross & the Supremes Join the Temptations, which featured Edwards's first studio recordings with the 
group and the number-two hit single "I'm Gonna Make You Love Me"; and Together. There was also a 
joint tour and two NBC television specials, TCB (aired December 9, 1968) and G.I.T. on Broadway (aired 
November 12, 1969). 
Psychedelic soul 
The addition of Dennis Edwards to the Temptations coincided with the adoption of a new sound for the 
group by producer Norman Whitfield, and in the fall of 1968, Whitfield began producing psychedelic-
based material for the Temptations, derived primarily from the sound of funk band Sly & the Family 
Stone. This new style, which debuted with the Top 10 hit single "Cloud Nine" in October 1968, was a 
marked departure from the David Ruffin-era ballads. The instrumentation was funkier, the beat was 
hard-driving, and all five Temptations traded lead vocals, similar to Sly & the Family Stone. "Cloud Nine", 
the centerpiece of the group's landmark Cloud Nine LP, was a Top 10 hit and won Motown its first 
Grammy Award, for Best R&B Vocal Group Performance of 1969. 
The blending of the Motown sound and psychedelic rock sound resulted in a new subgenre of music 
called "psychedelic soul", also evident in the work of Diana Ross and the Supremes ("Reflections", "Love 
Child"), Marvin Gaye's version of "I Heard It Through the Grapevine", and the music of The 5th 
Dimension, The Undisputed Truth, and The Friends of Distinction. More Temptations psychedelic soul 
singles would follow in 1969 and 1970, among them "Runaway Child, Running Wild" (a number-one R&B 
hit), "I Can't Get Next to You" (a number-one pop hit), "Psychedelic Shack", and "Ball of Confusion (That's 
What the World Is Today)", but the formula began to wear thin when "Ungena Za Ulimwengu (Unite the 
World)", only went to #33 Pop in the fall of 1970. The group's other important albums from this period 
included Puzzle People (1969) and Psychedelic Shack (1970). Psychedelic Shack includes the original 
version of "War", later made famous by Edwin Starr.
