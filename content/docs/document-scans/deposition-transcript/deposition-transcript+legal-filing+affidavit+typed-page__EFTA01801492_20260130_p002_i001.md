inadequate was indeed a big reason behind my jealousy and ridiculous demands. While it's no secret that 
helping girls get over their insecurities was never your forte. I aggravated the situation by putting that burden 
on you. 1 relied on you to make me feel good about myself when it was ultimately all in my control. As I am 
writing this, I recognize it sounds like a cliché but there is no way around it. I let myself get annoyed about the 
pettiest things, subconsciously knowing you would suddenly find time and talk to me. Unfortunately, it was the 
only way I knew to get your full attention, although negative, for more than a few minutes. So I picked stupid 
fights with you to get noticed, like a little kid... Wow, it's harsh to see that so clearly now and I don't like 
admitting it to myself at all. But I don't want to do it again, nor do I want you to find yourself in the same 
situation with someone else, so I am giving you the uncensored truth as raw as it is. Although I had a few 
legitimate concerns that deserved consideration. I am waving a white flag now because you were in fact right 
about most things. I recognize it and I thank you for all the effort you put into trying to explain. 
The process of getting to those realizations has been quite a journey; At first, I was just shocked that there 
was actually method in your madness. 
Later, I felt so embarrassed, I decided not to admit anything to you. I had been the crazy man on the streets 
yelling, with full conviction, about the end of the world. I think about how much you had to love me to live with 
him every day and I am so sorry you had to put up with it. 
But now I think it's only fair you get the credit - because it's NOT too late! 
I could have spent the rest of my life as that petty miserable brat I had turned into and now I don't have to. 
That thought alone makes me so happy. I feel like I have the answers to almost everything I need in order to 
live a great life. In fact, I am finding I leamed so much from you, it's not really fair to other people. 
I am me again and it is such a pleasure to be able to say that I am content with myself. I am in the shape I 
always wanted to be. I love that I can fly a jet and hold a conversation, or make a great Sasha impression. I 
find pleasure in being warm to people I meet and I am stunned by the results of a few simple changes. They 
now actually choose to talk to me, confide in me, help me, invite me to spend time with them. Strangers start 
conversations with me, girls flirt with me... I am not kidding when I say I now get compliments about how 
'likable' or 'charismatic' I am. Me!? It makes me smile. Every time I hear that, I still look around to see if you 
are laughing in the corner somewhere. I admit it takes an effort and practice but you can't appreciate my 
fascination that it worked. It may not seem very significant to you but I haven't experienced anything like it my 
whole life and I don't think it's just because my ass jiggles less. I can now get done what I need and have fun 
in the process. 
During the holiday airport mess, I got stuck in Atlanta on my way home. All flights to anywhere in the 
northeast were sold out for days and I was number 200 on a standby list for a flight that was already full. 
People were sleeping on the floors. I didn't have my uniform. I managed to get moved to number 2 and on 
the next flight home just by talking to the gate agents while others waited for a flight for 3 extra days. You 
would have liked watching it. It had every ingredient to be an awful day considering the circumstances but it 
was actually a lot of fun.. 
I still worry about certain things in my life and as you know there are a few stressful issues I need to sort out, 
but I can't think of the last time I let anyone win my day. That alone is priceless. I could go on for pages but 
my point is, I am in a very peaceful, happy place, which is to a great extent a result of my experiences with 
you. I hope you can feel some sense of accomplishment after reading this letter, because you have 
succeeded. I owe you for the greatest lesson in my life. 
I am aware I already crashed the airplane in the process. The truth is when you make that many bad 
decisions in the air, a controlled crash is sometimes the better option. I survived and I'm not flying into a 
thunderstorm again but I wish I had crashed before I took you along as a passenger. Saying I am sorry 
doesn't even begin to cover how guilty I feel. I miss my best friend but I don't blame you for being angry and 
resentful. Spend all the time you want hating me but know that when you are done and you want a friend, I
