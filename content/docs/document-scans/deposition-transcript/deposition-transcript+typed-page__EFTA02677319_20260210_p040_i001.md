3203 Alternative Food Networks 
Faculty: 78.4, Faculty 
Credits: 00 CRN 5106 Sec A 
In recent decades, alternative practices of food production and consumption have emerged in 
response to concerns about the environmental and social impact of the global industrial food 
system. Farmers markets. community-supported agriculture. food coops. and urban farms are 
examples of alternative food networks, which are place-based, socially embedded. and intended to 
change the way we grow, know, and get our food. In this class, we examine the history of these 
and other alternative food enterprises. Using critical theory, we evaluate the promise and 
limitations of alternative food networks as a means of creating more sustainable and just food 
systems. Readings are drawn from the fields of economic geography, rural sociology, community 
psychology, critical theory. and public health. Case studies from the popular press serve as a basis 
for class discussions about the practices brought together under the umbrella of alternative food

This course explores social justice in today's globalized food system. We learn about strategies and 
discourses used by community-based activists, government agencies, nonprofit organizations, and 
scholars in order to realize a more just food system for all. We begin by developing an 
understanding of the food system as one that encompasses farm and industry workers, farm 
owners and collectives, and agroecological systems. as well as all those who consume food. Based 
on this understanding. we review various concepts that encapsulate aspects of social justice. leg.. 
environmental justice; food justice; food sovereignty), and how these are applied in multiple 
contexts and social movements. Throughout the semester we also explore our own positions as 
university-based stakeholders in the food system, and students will be encouraged to integrate 
aspects of their own scholarly and/or activist projects into one or more course assignments. This 
course includes guest speakers and field trips to contextualize readings and in-class discussions.

Food Huts & VBSCs

Credits: 3 
CRN 6252 Sec A 
'Local food has become a mantra for many and changed the way food is being produced, sold, and 
even eaten. Values-based producers using environmentally sustainable practices need new ways 
to reach consumers interested in their products. Producers within values-based supply chains 
(VBSCs). and the food hubs that aggregate product from these producers. are hoping to achieve a 
"new mainstream-  food system that will challenge, if not replace, the conventional food supply 
chain. This surveys recently published research to examine the adoption of sustainable practices 
among small and mid-sized farmers; compare VBSCs to mainstream food systems; explore the 
benefits, barriers, and concerns of VBSCs; and identify the best practices among the many recent 
case studies that have been published. Field trips to food hubs that are part of the VBSCs in the 
New York City region are possible.'

Credits: 0 0 CRN 3717 Sec A 
This course is for food lovers who want to learn about the biology and chemistry that turn our daily 
meals into more than simple sustenance. We begin by studying the chemistry of food, including 
basic pnnciples of food metabolism, food pathogens. food preservation. and the chemistry of 
cooking. We then explore the biology of taste and smell, the role played by genetics in producing 
distinct food experiences for different people, and the possible link between these sensations and 
memory in the brain. Finally, we examine the sources of food in our society: global versus local or 
seasonal foods. industrial versus organic farming, and traditionally cultivated versus genetically 
modified crops. We consider the effects of these choices on farmers, the environment, food, taste. 
and nutrition.
