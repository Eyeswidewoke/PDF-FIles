"Two-Thirds in Interest of the Members" means such Members holding in the 
aggregate more than two-thirds of the sum of the Capital Contributions of all Members, excluding 
those of the Managing Member. 
Section 2.2 
Commitments: Closing: Capital Contributions. Each person 
wishing to become a Member shall sign the signature page hereto and indicate the amount of such 
person's Commitment. Each person signing the signature page hereto irrevocably agrees to 
purchase an Interest and to make an aggregate Capital Contribution in the amount of the accepted 
Commitment. The Managing Member shall, in its sole discretion, accept some, all or none of 
each person's Commitment, and shall countersign the signature page hereto, indicating the 
amount of the accepted Commitment. The Managing Member shall send a countersigned 
signature page to this Agreement, in accordance with Section 12.6 below, to each person whose 
Commitment is fully or partially accepted, indicating the accepted amount of such person's 
Commitment. Except as specified below, or as otherwise agreed in writing by the Managing 
Member, payment in full of each Commitment in the amount accepted by the Managing Member 
and indicated on the signature page hereto will be required at the time of the Closing, which shall 
be 2 Business Days from the date that the countersigned signature page to this Agreement is 
deemed given in accordance with Section 12.6. Any person failing to make a Capital 
Contribution when due acknowledges and agrees that the Company shall have all remedies 
available under applicable law to enforce the collection from such person of any unpaid Capital 
Contributions, whether a Commitment or otherwise, as well as all interest and costs of collection 
(including attorneys' fees). All such remedies shall be cumulative. Each Capital Contribution 
shall be made in cash, either by delivery to the Company of a certified check or wire transfer of 
immediately available funds to an account designated by the Managing Member. Each such 
Capital Contribution shall be used by the Company in furtherance of the purpose of the Company 
described in Section 1.4, and specifically in accordance with Section 3.2. 
Section 2.3 
Capital Accounts. (a) A capital account (each, a "Capital 
Account") shall be maintained for each Member in accordance with Section 704(b) of the Code 
and Treasury Regulations Sections 1.704-1(b) and 1.704-2. On the Closing, the initial Capital 
Account balance of: (a) the Managing Member shall be equal to the amount of the Capital 
Contribution made by the Managing Member at the Closing; and (b) each Member shall be equal 
to the amount of the Capital Contribution made by such Member at the Closing. 
(b) 
The Capital Account of each Member shall be increased by (i) the amount 
of any Capital Contribution of such Member following the Closing, (ii) such Member's share of 
Net Profits and any gross income and gain allocated to such Member pursuant to Article iX. 
(c) 
The Capital Account of each Member shall be decreased by (i) the amount 
of all cash distributions to such Member, (ii) the Book Basis of any property distributed to such 
Member by the Company (net of liabilities secured by such distributed property that the Member 
is considered to assume, or take such property subject to), (iii) such Member's share of Net 
Losses and any gross deductions and loss allocated to such Member pursuant to Article IX. 
(d) 
No Member shall be required to restore any negative balance in its Capital 
Account except as otherwise provided herein.
