shopping season. 
market liquidity: slight Con. 
6. Leadership transition: Bernanke's term ends January 31. would he want to be 
the one to deliver the important forward-looking message that would accompany 
the initial taper about the future course of policy at the press conference in 
January and then leave two days later? Bernanke could step down or step aside 
and let Yellen run the meeting and do the press conference. That could be a 
bit awkward, but it would also make Yellen's first move one that leads the 
Committee in a less dovish direction. 
Leadership transition: neutral. 
7. Bernanke legacy: Does Bernanke want to be remembered as the chairman that 
blew up the Fed's balance sheet and then left? Alternatively, would he want to 
risk being remembered for scuttling the recovery by tapering prematurely? 
Probably not important in Bernanke's case-has striven to diminish the cult of 
the chairmanship. 
Legacy: neutral. 
As I add up the pros and cons for a December taper, this is a very close one; 
it is quite possible they have not made any decisions yet, and that the CPI 
inflation data on Tuesday could still tip the scale. At this point, I am now 
leaning slightly in favor of a December taper. This is not a consensus view, 
though I note that our 05 Economics team has been more consistently projecting 
a December taper. 
If they do taper, I expect it to be a taper light, on the order of 55 to 515 
bn (skewed more toward Treasuries than MB5). This would be accompanied by a 
statement that is relatively dovish--i.e., that reinforces the message that 
they expect rates to be held at very low levels for quite some time to come. 
There are a number of ways they could do this. Here is my top ten list of the 
things they could do in this regard, starting with the least likely and ending 
with the most likely: 
10) Lower unemployment threshold from 6.5%. The October minutes and some 
Fedspeak have suggested this is not likely-the 7.0 and even 6.5 numbers have 
created communication problems as it is. (likelihood: 15%) 
9) Reduce interest on excess reserves. This got more support at the October 
meeting, but my sense it is not a high probability. (25%) 
8) Provide weak calendar forward guidance: for example, "we expect the first 
rate hike is at least one year away." Possible, but I do not expect the FOMC 
to revert to calendar-based guidance. (25%) 
7) Add a specific inflation floor. There may be more support here, but still 
problematic. A floor of 1.5% does not say much, a floor of 2.0 would be too 
high for many members, and a floor of 1.75 would be shaving things pretty 
finely. (3S%) 
6) Lower their projections for the fed funds rate for the coming years. 
Marking down the endpoint for the fed funds path several years out (per #5 
below) would allow them to revise down their interest rate forecasts for 
earlier periods as well. This could be a significant message, especially if 
they reduce their forecast for unemployment. (60%) 
5) Lower their projections for the neutral level of the fed funds rate in the 
longer term based on downward revisions to potential growth estimates. (60%) 
4) Point out (again) that their actions could be reversed if financial markets 
react negatively enough to put the economic expansion at serious risk. (75%) 
3) Note that they are comfortable with the apparent success of their verbal
