The fans of the Grateful Dead, some of whom followed the band from concert to concert for 
years, are known as "Deadheads" and are known for their dedication to the band's music. The 
band and its following (Deadheads) are closely associated with the hippie movement and were 
seen as a form of institution in the culture of America for many years. Former members of the 
Grateful Dead, along with other musicians, toured as the Dead in 2003, 2004, and 2009 after 
touring as the Other Ones in 1998, 2OOO, and 2OO2. There are many contemporary incarnations 
of the Dead, with the most prominent touring acts being Furthur, Phil Lesh & Friends, Bob Weir 
& Ratdog, and the Rhythm Devils with drummers Mickey Hart and Bill Kreutzmann. 
Formation (1965-1966) 
Phil Lesh and Jerry Garcia were brought together by Gert Chiarito in 1964 to perform on The 
Midnight Special, her Saturday night radio program on KPFA, Berkeley. 
The Grateful Dead began their career as the Warlocks, a group formed in early 1965 from the 
remnants of a Palo Alto, California jug band called Mother McCree's Uptown Jug Champions. 
The band's first show was at Magoo's Pizza located at 639 Santa Cruz Avenue in suburban Menlo 
Park, California on May 5, 1965. They were known as the Warlocks although at the same time 
the Velvet Underground was also using that name on the east coast. The show was not recorded 
and not even the set list has been preserved. The band quickly changed its name after finding 
out that another band of the same name had signed a recording contract (not the Velvet 
Underground, who by then had also changed their name). The first show under the new name 
Grateful Dead was in San Jose, California on December 4, 1965, at one of Ken Kesey's Acid 
Tests. Earlier demo tapes have survived, but the first of over 2,OOO concerts known to have 
been recorded by the band's fans was a show at the Fillmore Auditorium in San Francisco on 
January 8, 1966. Later that month, the Grateful Dead played at the Trips Festival, an early 
psychedelic rock show. 
The name "Grateful Dead" was chosen from a dictionary. According to Phil Lesh, in his 
autobiography (pp. 62), "... Perry Garcia] picked up an old Britannica World Language 
Dictionary...(and]...In that silvery elf-voice he said to me, 'Hey, man, how about the Grateful 
Dead?'" The definition there was "the soul of a dead person, or his angel, showing gratitude to 
someone who, as an act of charity, arranged their burial." According to Alan Trist, director of 
the Grateful Dead's music publisher company Ice Nine, Garcia found the name in the Funk & 
Wagnalls Folklore Dictionary, when his finger landed on that phrase while playing a game of 
Fictionary. In the Garcia biography, Captain Trips, author Sandy Troy states that the band was 
smoking the psychedelic DMT at the time. The term "grateful dead" appears in folktales of a 
variety of cultures. In mid-1969, Phil Lesh told another version of the story to Carol Maw, a 
young Texan visiting with the band in Marin County who also ended up going on the road with 
them to the Fillmore East and Woodstock. In this version, Phil said, "Jerry found the name 
spontaneously when he picked up a dictionary and the pages fell open. The words 'grateful' and 
'dead' appeared straight opposite each other across the crack between the pages in unrelated 
text." 
Other supporting personnel who signed on early included Rock Scully, who heard of the band 
from Kesey and signed on as manager after meeting them at the Big Beat Acid Test; Stewart 
Brand, "with his side show of taped music and slides of Indian life, a multimedia presentation" 
at the Big Beat and then, expanded, at the Trips Festival; and Owsley Stanley, the "Acid King" 
whose LSD supplied the tests and who, in early 1966, became the band's financial backer,
