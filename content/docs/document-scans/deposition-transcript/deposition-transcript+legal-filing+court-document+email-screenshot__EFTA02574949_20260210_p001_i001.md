Dear Noam, 
You are waiting for me to provide guidance as to how you can regain co=trol of the trust funds. My plan is to prepare a 
memo for you outlin=ng your options in light of the trust terms. I anticipate being able=to spend some time on this over 
the weekend, along with reviewing the drafts of your estate planning documents. O=ce I have sent the memo to you we 
can discuss your thoughts and we can the= respond to Max. Unfortunately this is a difficult situation, not simple a=d 
straightforward, because of the terms of the trust and fiduciary law applicable to trusts. Please see my e=ail of 10/17 for 
an explanation of some of the issues. 
In some situations a trust is drafted so that you would have the right=to remove and replace the trustee, and in doing so 
perhaps find a trustee =hat would not inquire so diligently as to your personal financial circumst=nces before making a 
principal distribution to you. In this regard, please refer to my email of 10/=7 where I summarize the trustee removal, 
resignation and appointment provi=ions. The trustees can both resign at any time. They appoint successors su=ject to 
your approval. If they agree to resign you can find a new independent trustee whom they can appoint. If=not, you can 
remove them but only with the approval of a majority of your =hildren. Do you think your daughters would agree to 
remove Max and Harry? =f so you could then appoint a successor. You would need to find an independent trustee. I can 
help you craft = letter to your daughters if you think they might agree to do this. <=div> 
My one additional thought right now that I need to review more closely=is that Harry, not being the independent 
trustee, should not have a say in=the distribution decision. If there is nothing in the trust to contradict =his 
interpretation (I need to review the trust again) then Max alone has the power. However this would likely n=t change 
the analysis that Max believes he needs to go through since he is=accountable to all beneficiaries. He believes he needs 
some level of=financial information from you but in my view that does not need to be detailed. I can discuss with him 
wh=t level of detail would satisfy him; however, if my understanding is corre=t that you do not wish to provide him with 
any backup for his distribution=decision, then we should evaluate the removal option and any other strategies I may be 
able to come up with.Q=A0
