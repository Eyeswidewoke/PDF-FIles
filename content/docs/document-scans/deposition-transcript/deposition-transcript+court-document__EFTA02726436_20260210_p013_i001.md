earning capacity here. None of that went up on 
2 
appeal nor did you object to that. You dealt 
3 
specifically with some aspects of prior sexual 
4 
history. 
5 
So I beg to differ. That's not part of what 
6 
the upcoming appeal is under the circumstances. 
7 
And I think it's inappropriate. Well, well let 
the judge decide what is appropriate or not under

MR EDWARDS: She will testify to what money 
11 
she made, just not the names of the places and the 
12 
Johns. That's it. So I understand that we have a

MR. GOLDBERGER: Yes. Should your objections
