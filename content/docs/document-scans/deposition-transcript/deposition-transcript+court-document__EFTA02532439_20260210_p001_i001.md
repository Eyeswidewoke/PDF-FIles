Jeffrey, 
Oh!, I'll be tough on her, I'll blind cc you on my =ig response tomorrow,. 
This is the story she sent me: 
Hi, Capta=n! 
How was Europe? J said you were comin: back home today. Did y=u hear about my crazy flight last night? 
So one of the 
to someone 
who list bou ht it and he offered me t= fly it from the right seat and log a lot of free flight time in a day. So=l went to 
to pick it up. The plane was old and eve= though it just came out of maintenance that day, the 
alternator malfuncti=ned and failed on our last leg in the middle of the night somewhere 
After a few uneventful legs during the day, we took off with full tanks at = 
yesterday evening. We 
planned to top off again in la 
we make it to MI with a nice reserve. But 
weather deteriorated quic=ly 
after we took off and went to 400ceilings. The other guy was flying thi= leg and wanted to shoot an approach and try 
landing. We went to minimums,=didn't break out of the clouds, went missed and decided to leave and c=ntinue on our 
way south. He wanted to just keep going all the way to 
There was a good chance we would have had enough 
fuel but the reserve=would have been questionable. I was getting uncomfortable, little tired, w=ather was ifr, I was in 
the right seat of strange old single engine plane =n the middle of the night thinking about our trip starting to sound like 
a=beginning of one of my crash book stories, so I told him I wanted to stop =omewhere anyway and refuel first. He let 
me get the controls and take it i=to 
to top off again and I am glad we did. Thinking back, we proba=ly should 
have stopped there for the night.. 
Maybe an hour after leaving 
M
,
 
in level flight, without warning, the who=e plane just went dark. I was flying, 
we were on ifr flight plan when we=A0lost all coms, lights, transponder, everything electrical.. the circuit =reaker was 
tripped so we reset it once, had enough time to tell center wha= was going on and they told us to keep going to MI, 
descend at our discr=tion if we lost everything again, do an ILS to 30 and then call them to ca=cel ifr. We lost it again. He 
brought his Garmin 696 so we used that to na=igate. What a lifesaver, I think now I really need to get one :) 
I was trying to decide whether to keep the controls for the approach or giv= to the other guy. I thought he knew 
how to work his 696 better and coul= set me up but he wasn't doing so well with the stress so I kept fly=ng from my seat 
and had him shine a light on my instruments and work the g=s. Weather was not too bad but still ifr with 700ceilings in 
=e were able to get the power back a few times before landing but always ju=t for a moment. I had to shoot 
an ils with a garmin flying from the right =eat, in the dark. The unexpected part was not being able to turn on the 
=unway lights with the radios dead. Tower was closed, the flaps are also =lectric, we descended through clouds and 
couldn't find the rwy till 4 was too late to make a safe landing. I went around, got very very pale a=d trying not to get 
back into the clouds, came in again. Once I landed and=cleared the runway, I could barely taxi it back my legs were 
shaking so ha=d. 
Then I put the newspaper down, stopped doing my nails ;-) and went straight=to 
to take a flight home. I am 
still in disbelief.
