Congratulations on this brilliant book. it is without question one of the most vital works of our 
time. 
Let's begin with what inspired you to write it. 
Siegel: Thanks for having me Jamie. As a young boy born in the mid 1950s, I was fascinated with 
footage of Hitler and the Third Reich and could never understand how the Jews of the time could 
not see the evil that seemed so obvious. Not yet appreciative of the benefit of hindsight, I could 
not comprehend the blindness. Following 9/11, like so many others, I began to study Islam, its 
history, its current movements, terrorism and so on. As I would learn one stunning aspect after 
another, I would discuss them with friends and associates. Rather than confront the facts I would 
present, they would find one clever way after another to avoid the frightening truth of what 
America and the West truly face. Their fear appeared obvious to me. I began to catalog many of 
my friends' different maneuvers to dispel the anxiety that they found so difficult to endure. The 
more I focused on their mental processes (as well as my own) the more i began to see a structure 
to the mental endeavor and to understand what I had, as a child, found so difficult to explain. 
FP: Tell us about the Control Factor, what you describe as "that effort our minds cnga gc in in 
order to keep us blind" and that "process of a voiding seeing the threats we face." It's also about, 
as you state, trying to believe that the threat is under our control, when in fact it is not. Kindly 
enlighten us as to these profound insights you make in terms of the Control Factor. 
Siegel: First, let's distinguish the "real world" where real battles are taking place from the mental 
battlefield which occurs in each of our minds. We tend to believe our perceptions are simply clear 
realizations of what is "out there" and overlook how much our internal worlds can literally 
determine what we see. When our internal minds become anxious and sense a loss of "control," 
they tend to concoct ways to distort our perceptions so as to restore that sense of inner control. I 
describe the Control Factor as an "active and continuous process" designed to maintain that 
sense, if not illusion, of control. We natural ly think that our thinking and feeling processes are 
passive; that they just happen. Yet when faced with truly frightening prospects, the mind is geared 
to actively distort. 
Similarly, the sense of control must be continuously maintained so the Control Factor operates 
constantly. In turn, the sum of this active and continuous undertaking makes these perceptions all 
the more familiar and thus seemingly all the more "real" In one sense, the Control Factor is the 
mechanism of what Andy McCarthy entitled one of his numerous excellent books- willful 
blindness. The Control Factor is cleverer than we arc aware; that is almost tautological as, if our 
minds are to create ways to keep us in denial, they must out maneuver our conscious thinking. 
Since World War II, America has had limited experience with threats coming to the homeland. 
Most of America's history has been about "over there," where we have always known that if 
things got too out of hand (e.g. Vietnam) we could always ret urn home. The current generations, 
for a wide array of reasons, have had virtually no experience with a threat to this land. (The 
documentary, Generation Zero is interesting on this point). 
Consequently, the process of waking up to such a threat parallels the arc of a typical horror film. 
In such a film, there is typically a cast of characters surrounding one or two main characters. We
