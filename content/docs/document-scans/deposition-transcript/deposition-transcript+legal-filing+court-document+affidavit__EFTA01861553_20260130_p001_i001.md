You can never upset me„ this has nothing to do with you. 
numbers speak for themselves. the 
people i have spoken with , albeit a select group, do not support the foundations ideas . this is 
consistant. nothing to do with you. . you arc a great friend , and a competent person„ I am 
trying to get you to realize your potential as opposed to regurgiating the same waste , money 
carbon story, that few really care about„

Maybe I do have it wrong in terms of colonialism perception and what westerners think is right. The 
only way to improve on that and make changes and do the right thing is to listen. So the perspectives 
I have are only as good as the information that I get. I spend time with community groups and the 
mayors office and his team. I go to community meetings and talk local NGOs. I ask what they want 
and need. Sometimes they don't know since they can only see past survival and today and of course 
local government politics can taint outlook. Im trying my very best and one of the key parts of our 
work is how to be better listeners. It os a work in progress. 
Im not sure why you are angry and attacking me and discounting our work. We run very decentralized 
projects and our internal metrics are not around revenue generation so that's not the data we collect 
or that our leadership cares about. I don't do money reports and talk broadly about our solid waste 
work because most people dont care or understand it. Its taken me nearly 4 years to understand and 
even I dont fully understand. 
In 2012 we will undertake a full accounting of the various models we've used and hopefully we will be 
able to offer some good options. We are just starting to co process in only one city (sanitation plus 
waste) so that will be different too. 
The numbers i sent were from one city in one country and only represent the three sizes of facilities. 
There are Lots of them. And carbon money is just a piece. Each one does slightly different business 
based on what they collect Nd their needs. We probably miss some profit or opportunity to make 
more but im learning. The locals are good at finding and correcting where we miss. 
I have no idea how to "prove" money or numbers to you. You have made it clear to me that you hate 
waste, poverty and anything i do that falls outside neuroscience. 
Im sad that somehow everything i do is wrong or disappointing to you. I adore you and care what you 
think so it does hurt me. 
You can believe whatever you like but i would hope that the integrity of the work speaks for itself. It is 
for city governments to decide if it something they want and they have to do A lot of work. I hope we 
can continue to work with them. I dont do the selling or sharing of numbers, i send the mayors and 
engineers to show others what and how. Lord knows they understand better than anyone. No one 
should trust me view of this, they should trust the people we support who do it.
