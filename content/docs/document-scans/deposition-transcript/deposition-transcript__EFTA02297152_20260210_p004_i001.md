Hi old man!;) how you doing? 
I've seen your pictures on facebook fro= your b-day party, you're so funny there, 
I think you could be not a b=d actor, Jeremy!:) How is your preparing for Christmas performance in your=church, what 
character are you gonna play there? I adore theatre, it would=very interesting to see your play, even if I'd get only a half 
of your=words in English I'd like to see it) I'm sorry I'm too far awa=. 
It was so unused to hear your voice when I called you, and it was so funny =o 
hear your confused tone trying to realize who is it:) I just thought you=#39;d guess, that it's me after I sang for you in 
Russian, but then I =hought, that you probably had not realized it was Russian, yes?:) 
It's a real winter here in Minsk already, it was snowing for the first =ime 
yesterday evening, it was very cold and windy, but so beautiful though= 
But the mainest theme in our country during last weeks is a flare of t=e atipic 
influenza. People are in panic, they wearing masks everywhere, th=re are huge crowds at the pharmacies and it's really 
hard to buy any a=tivirus medicine now, couse everything is already bought!:) So, it's n=mber 1 theme here now! 
I'm ok, congratulate me Jeremy, couse I've finally gone to the gym)=Know it 
sounds so commonly, but it was so long I couldn't do it and no= it's a real event to me) So, soon I'll be very very very 
STRONG!:=) 
Studies are normally, nothing special, the one thing that really impressed =e was 
during one of our classes at the criminal medicine chair. We've =een at the post-mortem examination there for the first 
time. After that, i='s like something changes in your mind, like as if you look at your ow= life from the other side and it 
seems so tiny! And you think' what a=e you doing? what are you waiting for?' Sometimes I feel like we live =n a cocoon 
of different stereotypes and prejudices. I even don't know =ow to explain it. Sorry, it probably sounds too gloomily. It's 
better =o talk about something more optimistic) 
How was bowling at your b-day, I hope you've won??:)

Hi Karina, so I h=d a somewhat good and bad experience today. I was training 
some teachers i= upper manhattan and when I was leaving I drove right past your street and=your apartment. I slowed 
down for a second and had some really good memori=s go through my mind. It was good memories for sure! 
Please tell you cat Privet from Jeremy and then give her a kiss for me.=:) 
That is great that you are practicing your English some m=re. Just don't watch 
too many American shows, that is not very much li=e America at all. :) 
How has your school been going? How are you studies?

Hi Jeremy! How are you? 
How was your weekend, did you finally get some r=st?:) Why weekends always 
pass so quickly...ah, I feel too lazy to wake up=early tomorrow and go for studies...:( 
My cat is lieing on me right now=and gazeing at the screen, I think may be she 
wants me to say "hi&quo=; from her) "Yeah, Marcy?" I don't know, she says just "=phrrrrr"...:)
