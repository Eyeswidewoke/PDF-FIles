You mentioned also the comments that were made to me in March =012 by 
Melody Hensley. let me give you the background for that. CFI was ho=ding an event prior to the 2012 Reason Rally in 
DC. Richard Dawkins, Jessi=a Alquist, Jamie Raskin, and Lawrence Krauss were scheduled to speak at th= event. Melody 
Hensley was heavily involved in the planning for the event =nd in fact was tapped to make introductions for the 
speakers, including Kr=uss. (At the time she was in charge of the DC local branch.) During the pl=nning for the event she 
gave no indication whatsoever that she had any hes=tation about introducing or dealing with Krauss. (I will forward you 
some =mail correspondence confirming this.) 
=p style="margin:Opx 0px 10.66px">As I recall, Krauss4,=99s schedule resulted 
in his planned arrival being a little later than the=others. As it turned out, he was even further delayed. At some point 
when =t became clear that Krauss was going to be late, Hensley turned to me and =aid, "I know why Krauss isn't coming; 
he's embarra=sed to see me." I asked Hensley what she meant by this. She said K=auss had made a pass at her several 
years earlier and she had rebuffed him= I asked for some details. She said she was in a hotel room with him (I ca='t recall 
whether she said it was Krauss's hotel room, but=l think it was), and that Krauss tried to kiss her. She pushed him away 
an= said she wasn't interested. I asked if Krauss persisted; she said=he did not. Thinking out loud, I believe I said 
something to the effect of='well, if you want to make a complaint you probably can, although ='m not sure our policy at 
that time would cover that.' Ms.=Hensley said she was not interested in making a formal complaint.</=pan> 
Ms. Hensley40=99s statement that I "responded to her with silence" is 
ab=olutely false and I categorically and unqualifiedly deny it. We talked abo=t her concern, as indicated. Ms. Hensley's 
recall must be failing =er. 
Given=the passage of time (six years), the fact that Hensley did not want to 
pur=ue the matter, the fact that Krauss desisted when Hensley indicated she wa=n't interested, the fact that Hensley 
didn't even seem ver= bothered by the incident (as indicated, she had expressed no hesitation i= seeing Krauss), and the 
fact that we had no policy covering conduct by no=employees back in 2006 (in fact, CFI's zero-tolerance policy cover=ng 
employees themselves was not implemented until 2007, I believe -- I was=just hired as the attorney in July 2006), I 
decided not to do any further =bout this particular incident. However, the incident, along with observati=ns I heard at 
the Women in Secularism conference which we held later in th= spring of 2012 (observations which did 
not=C24emention Krauss, but rather some speakers at non-CFI events), w=s a factor in my thinking about the need for a 
policy covering conduct by =nvited speakers and guests at CFI conferences. 
Ms. Hensley made no other complaint=to me about Krauss, nor did she ever 
express to me her belief that we shou=d not invite Krauss to events. 
In closing, let me state that any accusations stating=that I neglected to take 
harassment complaints seriously are false. Furthe=more, I would regard them as a malicious attack on my character and 
my pro=essional reputation. </=pan>
