COUNTERTERRORISM 
Migrants Not Properly Screened for Terrorism at San Diego Border 
KGTV (ABC-10) (07/31, Grabish) reported that an audit by the Office of the Inspector General found that San Diego 
Border Patrol agents failed to properly screen migrants for terrorism due to being overwhelmed by a large volume 
of "special interest aliens". According to the article, the audit revealed that agents did not consistently conduct and 
document interviews of flagged migrants, and a request from the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force to interview 
certain migrants was not fully implemented. The article noted that the Inspector General made three 
recommendations to improve processes for flagging high-risk migrants, citing disparities in migrant screening and 
an outdated list of countries with links to terrorism that has not been updated since 2016. The article highlighted 
that in July 2023, during a surge of migrants at the San Diego border, the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force asked 
Border Patrol agents to interview certain migrants. The FBI raised concerns that Central Asian smuggling networks 
might pose a national security threat to the United States. "Agents told us there were too many aliens in custody 
matching the task force's requests to interview before releasing them;' the Inspector General report says. 
Federal Law Enforcement Tells Senators Cartels Are Engaging in Sophisticated Terrorism 
FedAgent (07/31, Staff Writer) reported that the Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing on protecting law 
enforcement and Americans from international drug cartels, with witnesses including Matthew Allen from the DEA, 
Jason Stevens from HSI, and FBI Assistant Director of the criminal investigative division, Jose Perez. According to the 
article, the witnesses stated that cartels are engaging in sophisticated terrorism with a foothold on U.S. soil, using 
methods such as surveillance and targeting law enforcement. The article noted that the foreign terrorist 
organization designation has been a valuable tool, allowing for over S00 gang-related arrests, expansion of 
watchlisting capabilities, and disruption of cartel finances and logistics, according to Perez and Stevens. 
Federal Court Denies Boston Bomber's Request for New Judge to Oversee Death Sentence Appeal 
The Associated Press (07/31, Willingham) reported that a federal court denied Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's request to 
remove Judge George O'Toole from overseeing his death sentence appeal. According to the article, Tsarnaev's guilt 
in the deaths of those killed in the bombing was not at issue in the appeal. His lawyers have argued that Tsarnaev 
fell under the influence of his older brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who was killed in a gun battle with police days 
after the bombing. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was convicted of all 30 charges against him. Prosecutors portrayed the 
brothers — ethnic Chechens who moved to the United States from Russia more than a decade ago — as full 
partners in a brutal and cold-blooded plan to punish the U.S. for its wars in Muslim countries. This investigation was 
conducted by the FBI's Boston Division. 
Continued Reporting: Trump Pick for Counterterrorism Role Confirmed by Senate 
CNN (07/31, Williams) reported that the Senate has confirmed Joe Kent to a top counterterrorism role, leading the 
National Counterterrorism Center, despite opposition from Democrats. According to the article, Kent's supporters 
have cited his long experience in counterterrorism and the military — he served 11 combat tours over a 20-year 
career in the Army before retiring to become a CIA officer — and his personal experience as a Gold Star spouse. His 
first wife, Shannon, was killed in a 2019 suicide bombing in Syria while serving as a Navy cryptologist. "Mr. Kent 
understands the grave threat that terrorism poses to the security and safety of Americans," said Sen. Tom Cotton of 
Arkansas during a floor speech on Wednesday. Conversely, Democrats expressed concerns over Kent's past 
associations with White nationalists and far-right extremists, as well as his promotion of conspiracy theories. The 
article highlighted that Kent defended his promotion of the conspiracy theory that the FBI and aspects of the 
intelligence community were involved in planning or directing the riot at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021. Kent 
has spoken in favor of insurrectionists charged with storming the U.S. Capitol, describing some January 6 
defendants as "political prisoners" who were not being afforded due process, though he said he opposed those 
who attacked police officers. HuffPast (07/31, Bendery) and The Daily Beast (07/31, Palmer) also reported on the 
story.
