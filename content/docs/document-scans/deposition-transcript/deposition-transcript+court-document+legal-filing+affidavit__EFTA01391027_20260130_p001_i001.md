GLDUS139 Third Lake Capital 
Proprietary and Confidential 
(15) 
Except to the extent not permitted by the Delaware Act, limit or eliminate such 
Defaulting Partner's ability to vote, consent or withhold consent with respect to 
any Partnership matter; 
(16) 
Except to the extent not permitted by the Delaware Act, elect to terminate the 
interest of such Defaulting Partner, whereupon such Defaulting Partner shall 
cease to be a Limited Partner, and shall have no further interest in the 
Partnership, including any right to receive distributions of cash or property, or 
to vote on any matter (if the General Partner elects to exercise its rights under 
this clause (a), the interest of such Defaulting Partner shall be reallocated 
among all non-Defaulting Partners, pro rata based on their respective 
Subscriptions); and 
(17) 
To the extent that such Defaulting Partner's Interests are treated on a look-
through basis by the Underlying Fund, such Defaulting Partner may also be 
subject to thc remedies prescribed by thc Underlying Fund. 
(b) 
In addition to and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the 
General Partner (or its assigns) may, in its sole discretion, exercise any remedy in respect 
of the Defaulting Partner and/or the interest of the Defaulting Partner that could have 
been exercised by the General Partner if the provisions of the limited partnership 
agreement of the Underlying Fund were contained herein in their entirety, muttnis 
mutandis. In addition, in the event that a Limited Partner's default results in or 
contributes to a default by the Partnership under the limited partnership agreement of the 
Underlying Fund, the General Partner may take any such actions in accordance with 
6.3.3. To the maximum extent permitted by law, the remedies set forth above shall be 
cumulative, and the use by the General Partner of one or more of them against a 
Defaulting Partner shall not preclude the use of any other such remedy. Each Limited 
Partner agrees to pay on demand all costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' 
fees) incurred by or on behalf of the Partnership in connection with the enforcement of 
this Agreement against such Limited Partner as a result of a default by such Limited 
Partner. 
(c) 
Upon an event of default by a Partner, if the General Partner elects to exercise its powers, 
duties or discretions with respect to such Partner under this 6.3.2, any income, profit or 
gain that otherwise would have been allocated to the Capital Account of such Defaulting 
Partner may be allocated to the Capital Accounts of all the other Partners (other than any 
other Defaulting Partner) pro rata in accordance with their respective Percentage 
Interests (calculated without giving effect to the Percentage Interest of any Defaulting 
Partner). 
(a) 
The application of the penalty provisions in this 6.3.2 shall not relieve any Defaulting 
Partner of its obligation to make all payments of its capital contributions when due. No 
course of dealing between the General Partner and any Defaulting Partner and no delay in 
exercising any right, power or remedy conferred in this 6.3.2 or existing at law or in 
equity or by statute or otherwise will operate as a waiver or otherwise prejudice any such 
right, power or remedy.
