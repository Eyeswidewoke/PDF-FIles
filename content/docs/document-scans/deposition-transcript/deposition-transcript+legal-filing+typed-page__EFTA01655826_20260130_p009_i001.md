FBI Warns Families of Sextortion, a Growing Threat Targeting Teen Boys in Philadelphia 
CBS News (03/12, Crawford) reported that sextortion is on the rise in the Philadelphia area, and the FBI wants 
minors and families to be aware of the crime. Sextortion is when someone online poses as a young person, 
convinces a real teenager to send them explicit photos and then once they have the photos, the scammer 
blackmails the young person for money. The threats become so intense, that the FBI says sextortion has led to at 
least 20 suicides nationwide. The article added that according to the FBI, the connection between criminals and 
teens can start anywhere young people communicate online, including a messaging platform, app, or video game. 
Step one for the scammer is getting a sexually explicit picture from a teenager. The article quoted Alexis Krieger, a 
victims specialist with FBI Philadelphia, who said, "That reciprocity. I'll show you if you show me. Sometimes they 
have photos from other victims that they then use to entice that child, almost a catfishing kind of scam," The article 
stated that the crime has become more common in the last few years. According to FBI statistics, there were 14 
reports of sextortion in 2021 in the Philadelphia region. In 2022, that number jumped to 110, and in 2023, there 
were 130 reports. The article quoted Donald Asper, a Supervisory Special Agent with FBI Philadelphia, who 
said, "It's not just a single actor, you're looking at organizations, you're looking at people that this is their sole 
source of income, often they're overseas, so this makes it harder to track down." 
Border Shooting in California: Marksman Killed Man Assaulting Migrants 
The Los Angeles Times (03/12, Toohey) reported that a man fatally shot by a border patrol marksman earlier this 
month near the California-Mexico border was gunned down because he was threatening migrants with a firearm, 
federal officials said. The U.S Customs and Border Protection recently released new details about the March 3 
shooting, which killed a 32-year-old Mexican citizen not far from the Otay Mesa Port of Entry border checkpoint. 
The article added that according to the federal agency, a border patrol tactical unit was set up that day near a 
paved road that runs through the Otay Mountains, a few miles east of the Otay Mesa border crossing, after reports 
of armed robberies and assaults targeting migrants trying to cross into the U.S. The border agents, who were in a 
concealed position, saw the man threaten a group of migrants by loading a firearm and pointing it at them, 
according to the border patrol statement. At that point, a border patrol precision marksman fired one shot at the 
armed man, fatally striking him. The article stated that U.S. Customs and Border Protection did not release video 
from the shooting but said it was "committed to expeditiously releasing the body-worn camera footage of this 
incident as soon as is appropriate to do so and without impacting the ongoing law enforcement investigations." The 
San Diego County Sheriff's Department, the FBI, and the Border Patrol's Office of Professional Responsibility are 
continuing to investigate, officials said. 
Maine Man Charged by FBI Over Online Threats to Kill President Biden, Immigrants 
The Portland Press Herald (03/12, Calder) reported that a Maine man who allegedly threatened in online posts to 
kill President Biden, other politicians, and immigrants has been arrested by the FBI. The article added 
that Benjamin Brown, 45, used YouTube comments over the past several years to make threats toward elected 
officials and immigrants and claimed he was stockpiling weapons in preparation for a violent civil war in the U.S., 
according to a criminal complaint and probable cause affidavit filed in court by Jonathan Duquette, an FBI task 
force officer. The article mentioned that Kristen Setera, spokeswoman for the FBI Boston Division that covers 
Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Rhode Island, said Tuesday in an email that Benjamin Brown was taken 
into custody without incident Monday. 
Bryan Kohberger Attorney's Appeal of Grand Jury Indictment Denied by Idaho Supreme Court 
Fox News (03/12, Wehner, Ruiz) reported that a pretrial appeal filed with the Idaho Supreme Court by Bryan 
Kohberger's public defenders was denied Tuesday, though the reasoning behind the denial was not provided. 
Kohberger's attorneys claimed prosecutors indicted their client improperly on four counts of first-degree murder 
and a single count of burglary, to the grand jury. The article added that while the grand jury was working toward an 
indictment, prosecutors said they must reach an indictment if the case reaches the higher legal standard of guilt 
beyond a reasonable doubt, instead of the standard of probable cause. The one-page ruling by the Idaho Supreme 
Court did not provide any reasoning for their denial of Kohberger's attorney's filed appeal, and the matter was 
closed. The article noted that the suspect was attempting to delay proceedings by appealing one of the judge's 
individual decisions to a higher court, which was denied. Specifically, Kohberger wanted the Supreme Court to 
overturn the judge's decision not to toss the indictment. The article mentioned that it took police more than six 
weeks to capture a suspect. They arrested Kohberger at his parent's house in Pennsylvania's Pocono Mountains
