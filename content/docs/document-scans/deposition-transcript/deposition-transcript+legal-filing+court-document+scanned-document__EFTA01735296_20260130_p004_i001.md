there is a public interest in prosecuting, where the evidence justifies prosecution, even if the case results in an 
acquittal. It appears that the witness's main objection to the paragraph quoted was a reference to "perpetrators" 
on the basis that the word is objectionable and biased. 
She was then asked what material she has to justify the conclusion that Ms Ny "is a well-known radical feminist". 
She did not produce any further evidence to substantiate that conclusion and thought it was well known. It was 
suggested to her that the nature of Ms Ny's job, child protection and prosecution of sex crimes against women, 
justified her taking a stand on crimes against women. It was not dear whether she accepted this proposition 
She was then re-examined and confirmed, in effect, the evidence she had given in chief, for example about the 
appropriateness of arranging interviews abroad. She said she is not an expert on extradition. The prosecution in 
this case was entitled to apply for an arrest warrant under Swedish law. The defendant can ask for a public trial. 
The judge decides. However it is rarely, if ever, that such a trial takes place in public. Shc was asked about press 
cuttings relating to Ms Ny, which are in the bundle. She had read them. 
There is no doubt in my mind that Brita Sundberg-Weitman has had a very distinguished career as a judge and as 
a jurist. In her time she was no doubt a highly respected expert on many aspects of Swedish criminal law. She 
had taken a particular interest in European law, and in civil rights. She clearly now finds herself out of sympathy 
with the Swedish judicial system. Shc believes it to be unfair. It is perhaps unfortunate that in her report she did 
not mention that her opinions are not universally accepted. Similarly, one might have expected a clearer 
statement in her report that some of her evidence was based on what she had been told by defence lawyers, as 
opposed to independent sources, although she readily revealed that in cross-examination. Nevertheless I was 
very grateful to her for attending court to give evidence. 
Also on 76 February 2011 I heard live evidence from Mr Goran Rudling. Again he adopted his proof and 
confirmed it in live evidence. I need not repeat his evidence in detail here. He promotes law reform in relation 
to sexual offences. Swedish law does not offer sufficient protection for rape victims. He has followed this case 
and discovered that one of the complainants has deleted Tweets that arc inconsistent with her allegations. He 
passed this on to the police but became increasingly concerned that nothing was being done about his reports. 
Later he was in direct contact with the complainant, who has now removed most of her post about revenge. 
The police interviews with the complainants do not follow good practice. 
The complainants and the 
interviewing officer are all active members of the Social Democrat Party. He also explained the difficulty in 
Sweden demonstrating the difference between consenting to something and wanting something. He told me 
that the police file in this case had been publicly available on the Internet. It was suggested to him that the 
material he saw on 31., January was a copy of the material sent to Mr Assange, but leaked after it reached the 
office of his London lawyer, and he appeared to agree. 
Sven-Eric Alhem gave evidence the next day, 8th February. He too adopted his expert report and his evidence 
has been transcribed and need not be repeated in detail here. Mr Alhem retired in July 2008 after a legal career
