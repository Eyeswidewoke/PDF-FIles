Second, I am a little surprised by your insistence that we request that the state court 
conduct the plea and sentence in November. You may recall that we previously discussed, and 
you agreed, that because the state judge will not stagger the plea and sentencing as we 
contemplated in the Agreement, Mr. Epstein could plea and be sentenced at any point before 
January 4, 2008. As you know, the judge's refusal to stagger the plea and sentencing actually 
harms Mr. Epstein because this delays the timing under which he can receive the names of the 
individuals identified by the United States as "victims" under § 2255. But we believe we must 
defer to the judge's decision in this matter. To clear up any misunderstanding, however, the 
judge has set this case "for trial" on January 7 only as a formal matter. The judge has invited the 
parties to appear for the plea and sentencing on January 4, and we do not anticipate any delay 
beyond that date. 
Third, I want to clear up any confusion regarding the many inaccurate media reports 
about Mr. Epstein. With the hope of maintaining some semblance of privacy for Mr. Epstein, we 
have avoided interacting with the media regarding this matter. Indeed, the only recent comment 
was Howard Rubenstein's confirmation to the Palm Beach Daily News that this matter had been 
resolved and would not proceed to a trial. That comment was authorized only out of concern that 
you might read an inaccurate story and believe, mistakenly, that Mr. Epstein had decided not to 
proceed under the Agreement. 
Fourth, regarding the sentence to be imposed by the court, the Agreement, and all of the 
discussions we have had about it, are very clear: Mr. Epstein is to be sentenced to an 18-month 
term in accordance with the same rules and regulations (and the same rights and privileges) that 
apply to everyone in the state of Florida. That Mr. Epstein would be treated no better and no 
worse than anyone else was a material term of the Agreement. If your Office now believes he is 
not entitled to equal treatment, I would very much appreciate an explanation of the basis of such 
view. I am sufficiently concerned about comments in your letter to seek clarification on this 
point, especially because the lawyers in your Office have made clear on numerous occasions to 
me that as long as Mr. Epstein received an 18-month sentence, your Office would not seek to 
interfere with the implementation of the state sentence. 
Fifth, pursuant to the Agreement, Mr. Epstein, through his counsel, agrees to provide the 
agreements made with the State Attorney's Office. 
Finally, I must tell you that I am troubled by the manner in which your Office has dealt 
with the § 2255 issues that are encompassed in the Agreement. As you already know, one of the 
lawyers initially recommended by your Office contacted Judge Davis to lobby for the assignment 
of attorney representative even before Judge Davis was formally selected to appoint an attorney 
representative. Moreover, I find it highly unusual that your Office has continued to insist that a
