Hi 
:this is a very weird email I know and please excuse spelling Im in a hurr=. for what its worth let me explain: I dated 
for short while a f=w years back.) fell in love very deeply with him very fast someting I had =ever experienced 
before. Then he suddenly broke up with me and I totally b=oke down. I didnt know what was happening cause I thought 
he loved me too =ut he said I wasnt the right person for him.I was mad and hurt and very =A0confused. I started doing 
stuff to hurt him back. he has a reputation to=loose adn so I did some web stuff to hurt him that way.l am pretty techy 
a=d have lots of friends in silicon valley where I lived for the longest tim= that I could use also. He knew about some of 
the things like facebook and=other match profile I put up, and last year when he started dating you he =old me to back 
off cause he found "the one". Well I was still in=love with him, and 
(he doesnt even know that) to have a chance to get back=wtih him.but he never even responded to 
my texts and call. I had tried to =all in love with someone else but it never felt the same so I was so afrai= I would never 
be happy again without him. I did things I am not proud of =nd regret.lm not a bad person but just couldnt help doing 
this. I couldnt =ear the thought that he found "the one". I had already access to=his computer from remote and had his 
phone jailbroken as he never updated =is software that was easy. I pretended he was active on match. Until he up=ated 
the OS I had full accress to his phone I could listen to converstatio=s write messages whatever I wanted.l saw stuff 
between you and him also, s=rry. I was just so in love and jealous cause you two looked so cute togeth=r. But now when 
I saw that what I did caused the end of your relationship = feel really bad. To make a long story short I now want to 
resolve things =nd make it up to you and him.Something selfishly about it because I know n=w he will never be with me 
again but as long as he isnt really off the mar=et I cant stop thinking of him. so it would actually help me get over thisrif i 
knew you guys got hitched. Does this make any sense to u i dunno:( =A0in any case what i am trying to say is i did a lot of 
bad stuff that mad= him look bad and you must think he is bad but he really is not. Before it=was my intention cause i a 
was so mad but now i jsut want to get over this=or else it eats me up. I need closure. 
I would have rather met up with you to tell you all this in person (tr=ed calling you also) but I am leaving tomorrow and 
wont be back til end of=the week and think you should know the skinny sooner. I still wouldn Ht mind meeting up in 
person when I am back. I cant tell you my name on=here as he threatened to sue me and this address is a throwaway 
address fo= the same reason. Still please keep whatever i said here to yourself its c=nfidential between you and me. 
Take care.
