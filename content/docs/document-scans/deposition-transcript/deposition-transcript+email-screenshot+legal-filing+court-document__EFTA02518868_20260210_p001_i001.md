Re: 
So you are partly wrong. You stayed only for part. And too tell you the tru=h for many on the stage it did exactly what 
you say. In the audience it ca= never be a mass you change in 2000 people with classical music, but a min=rity of 
individuals. And there were many who would disagree. 
But I do not dispute that the connection to the audience should have been d=fferent---and the ideal circumstance would 
have permitted some props and c=stumes and super titles. It si an opera after all. 
So get the point, but the analogy does not quite fit. You have some point--=ince that is what you saw and felt and I can't 
dispute that. But there wer= others--and not friends--for whom the performance did something important= The 
difference is that not enough and the audience needs to be different.=You know who came up to me in droves 
afterwards to say that it was the hig= point of their lives--the girls in the children's chorus--who were blown =way by the 
beauty of the music and the story and the quality of what happe=ed.
