speakers, including Krauss. (At the time she was in charge of the DC local branch.) During the planning for the event she 
gave no indication whatsoever that she had any hesitation about introducing or dealing with Krauss. (I will forward you 
some email correspondence confirming this.) 
As I recall, Krauss's schedule resulted in his planned arrival being a little later 
than the others. As it turned out, he was even further delayed. At some point when it became clear that Krauss was 
going to be late, Hensley turned to me and said, "I know why =rauss isn't coming; he's embarrassed to see me." I asked 
Hensley what she =eant by this. She said Krauss had made a pass at her several years earlier and she had rebuffed him. I 
asked for some details. She said she was in a hotel room with him (I can't recall whether she said it was Krauss's hotel 
room, but = think it was), and that Krauss tried to kiss her. She pushed him away and said she wasn't interested. I asked 
if Krauss persisted; she said he did not. Thinking out loud, I believe I said something to the effect of 'well, if you =ant to 
make a complaint you probably can, although I'm not sure our policy at that =ime would cover that.' Ms. Hensley said 
she was not interested in making a formal complaint. 
Ms. Hensley'= statement that I "responded to her with silence" is absolutely 
false and I categorically =nd unqualifiedly deny it. We talked about her concern, as indicated. Ms. Hensley= recall must 
be failing her. 
Given the passage =f time (six years), the fact that Hensley did not want to 
pursue the matter, the fact that Krauss desisted when Hensley indicated she wasn't interested, the =act that Hensley 
didn't even seem very bothered by the incident (as indicated, she had expressed no hesitation in seeing Krauss), and the 
fact that we had no policy covering conduct by nonemployees back in 2006 (in fact, CFI's =ero-tolerance policy covering 
employees themselves was not implemented until 2007, I believe -- I was just hired as the attorney in July 2006), I 
decided not to do any further about this particular incident. However, the incident, along with observations I heard at 
the Women in Secularism conference which we held later in the spring of 2012 (observations which did not mention 
Krauss, but rather some speakers at non-CFI events), was a factor in my thinking about the need for a policy covering 
conduct by invited speakers and guests at CFI conferences. 
Ms. Hensley made no other complaint to me about Krauss, nor did she ever 
express to me her belief that we should not invite Krauss to events. 
In closing, =et me state that any accusations stating that I neglected to take 
harassment complaints seriously are false. Furthermore, I would regard them as a malicious attack on my character and 
my professional reputation. 
Sincerely, 
Ronald A. =indsay
