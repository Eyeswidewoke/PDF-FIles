THE ex-fianc of Emmy-winning "West Wing" star Allison Janney (above) is being evicted from her Central Park 
West pad. Janney has been illegally subletting the rent-stabilized, $1,100- a-month apartment to former beau 
Dennis Gagomiros, says Keith Rubenstein, a lawyer for landlord Michael Tauber. "We are starting the eviction 
process," says Rubenstein, who estimated the lair marker value of Janney's joint at $3,000 a month. Janney's 
lawyer, Sam Himmelstein, insists Janney "surrendered possession" of her pad several weeks ago to the 
landlord. "Her ex-fianc bermes that he has the succession rights to the apartment, but she has nothing to do with 
that he said. 
Flasher chic 
WONDER why Stella McCartney never took her black satin coat off during the opening of her boutique last 
Friday? She had nothing under it but a very sexy bra and satin knickers. The highlight of the afterparty at 
Gaslight was Stella, Gwyneth Paftrow and Usher singing karaoke for the likes of Bono, Britney Spears, Liv Tyler, 
Debbie Harry, Russell Simmons, Graydon Carter, Christy Tur lington, Karolina Kurkova, Helena Christensen and 
others too fashionable to mention. 
Dueling Dems 
DON'T invite Ed Koch and Pete Grannis to the same political party. The former mayor has no use for the 
assemblyman who has represented the Upper East Side for 28 years. The feud began with Koch's endorsement 
of Andrew Eristoff, a Republican challenger for the State Senate seat currently occupied by Democrat Liz 
Krueger. Grannis observed in community weekly Our Town: "Our former mayor seems to have a thing for 
Republicans and an aversion to endorsing women of either party." Now Koch has responded in a letter to Our 
Town to Grannis' "gutter attack" and "vile comments." Koch lists no fewer than 9 women he's endorsed for 
election over the years, plus seven women he appointed to office, and concludes, "I am sure Grannis has 
harbored thoughts of higher office, indeed ran for Congress and lost. I doubt that he will ever attain higher office, 
and I truly believe he does not deserve the office he currently holds and has held for 28 years." 
Single again 
THIS years ladies man, Matthew Perry, is single again. After squiring around Amanda Peet, Jennifer Capriati 
and a host of other hot young things this summer, the "Friends" star was on the prowl Sunday night. After losing 
the Emmy to his co-star Matt LeBlanc, Perry and Hank Azaria showed up in fine spirits to the Glamour/ 
Entertainment Weekly post-Emmy party at the Mondrian in Los Angeles and flirted with a gaggle of girls. "He 
was so excited he startedto sweat and had to massage his head," said our spy. Perry eventually left alone. 
MCCAIN MUTINY IN WORKS? 
IS Sen. John McCain going to quit the Republican Party and become the running mate of Sen. John Kerry in the 
2004 presidential race? McCain's chief political adviser, John Weaver, has become a Democrat and is now 
working for Dick Gephardt. McCain's new legislative director, Christine Dodd, last worked for a liberal 
congressman - a Democrat Now Kerry of Massachusetts, who has made clear his plans to run in 2004, is 
making overtures towards McCain. A rumored head- to-head between Kerry and McCain is said to be scheduled 
at McCain's cabin in Sedona, Ariz., next month. And for "Man of the People," the new McCain biography by Paul 
Alexander, Kerry provided a blurb that reads more like a love letter. After noting that McCain's 2000 presidential 
campaign "set the standard for honor, dignity, courage, and truth," Kerry declares: "I have had no greater 
privilege in all my life than finding and then standing on common groundwith John McCain, and I look forward to 
fighting side by side with him on yet another day to make our country stronger."
