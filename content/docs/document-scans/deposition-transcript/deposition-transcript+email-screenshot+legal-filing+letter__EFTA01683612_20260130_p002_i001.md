Source Reporting: 
(U//FOUO) Susan Desmond-Hellmann (Hellmann) served as the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the 
Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation from 2014 to 2020. In 2019, Hellmann served on the Board of 
Directors at Facebook, and in fact, she was the designated "Lead Independent Director' of the board, 
which was the highest ranked board member with the most influence. In 10/2019 the New York Times 
published an article describing how Bill Gates (Gates) had a high number of contacts with Jeffrey 
Epstein (Epstein). There were incriminating emails between Epstein and Gates, and Gates had even 
stayed over at Epstein's home. Due to her serving as the CEO of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, 
Hellmann was well acquainted with Gates and may have been aware of details of the events described 
in the New York Times article. Just after publication of the article, during the same week, Hellmann 
informed the rest of the Facebook Board members that she had a very serious illness and needed to 
resign as a Board Member. She stepped down as the CEO of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in 
12/2019. Then, she stepped down as the CEO of 'BMGF' due to 'health and family reasons'.

(U//FOUO) In 01/2020, just three months after her resignation from Facebook and BMGF due to her 
'serious illness; a known U.S. person (USPER), ran into Hellmann at the Alpha Club - an annual bow-
tie dinner with extremely high net-worth and influential businessmen and politicians. At that time, 
Hellmann appeared to have had a 'miraculous recovery' and had no signs of illness. In 2020 she went 
on to join Phizer's Board of Directors and continued serving as the Senior Advisor for the Bill & Melinda 
Gates Foundation. That same year, Hellmann's 'miraculous" recovery continued as she joined Google 
Ventures in a senior advisory role. 
(U//FOUO) According to USPER, the accelerated divorce of Gates from Melinda Gates (Melinda) was an 
indication to Hellmann that 'the other shoe was about to drop." Hellmann was certain there was going 
to be an 'avalanche' of incriminating information to follow, panicked and quickly resigned from her 
positions in order to avoid the public spectacle, which could have entangled her into the mess 
surrounding the allegations of events that occurred at Epstein's residences. Hellmann was surprised 
and relieved when no more scandalous information came out following the New York Times story, so 
she aggressively pursued more high-level positions. Her behavior indicates there was something "dark" 
that never ended up surfacing in the media, which Hellmann was aware of. 
(U//FOUO) USPER had been to Epstein's residence and believed he was a 'construct" who was playing 
a role. Specifically, Epstein was running an Israeli state-sponsored technology collection and extortion 
operation. This assertion is backed up by two variables - 1) who his benefactors and assistants were, 
2) what activities he was involved in. Due to the number of secrets Epstein must have been aware of, 
its not surprising he did not last long after being put into custody.
