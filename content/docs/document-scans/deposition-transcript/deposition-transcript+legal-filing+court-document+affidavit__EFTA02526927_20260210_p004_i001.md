you completely disregard the detailed and fully accurat= information I have once again reviewed, and choose instead to 
rely on wha= you are told by others. 
We have in fact found your letters=over the past year increasingly alarming. If we felt that you were stable and 
content in your new life, we would probably accept the distance that has been created. But your statements, in person, 
and in your letters= do not give us the impression that you feel stable and content. 
I have explained before, and will re=eat again, that I am very stable and content in my new life, and looking 
f=rward to the peace, tranquillity, work and life conditions that I think I =ave a right to enjoy after many years of hard 
work and ample attention to =aring for the needs of my children. There was a financial problem ca=sed by extremely 
harmful decisions of advisers that I had trusted, but tha='s now pretty much overcome. What's causing extreme 
distress=is your insistence, which I don't understand, on pursuing the matters =e are now again discussing. 
=ne matter that remains is that marital trust. I explained what has b=en happening in a letter that you seem 
again to have ignored, and won'= repeat the details. In brief, Max has concocted an interpretation t=at is technically 
legal but that clearly makes no sense at all, based on t=e idea that Mommoy and I decided to split our assets so that she 
would mak= decisions about allocation of her part and I would make decisions about a=location of my part. The idea 
that we would decide to have separate =roperty and make independent decisions about it is insane, and never occur=ed 
to us. Max's interpretation is based on the technicality that=in setting up the trust in M's name for tax purposes, the 
funds were f=rst assigned to her revocable Trust and then to the Marital Trust, which w=s, of course, intended for the 
use of the survivor -- which is, for exampl=, why I have always selected the Trustees and should continue to do so. 
Perhaps, though you h=ven't said so, you agree with Max, and want to ensure that the survivo= (me) does not 
have access to the funds and that they should go to you in =ddition to you. And that I should not have the right to leave 
anythi=g to Valeria. If that's the case -- which is hard for me to beli=ve I think it would be best to say so straight out. 
We have begged you to meet with us=with a mediator. We renew that request. A mediator is a person 
train=d to help different parties communicate and understand each other. This is what we want. We do not want to 
watch you engage in expensive legal battles, and we do not want to live in trepidation of the next angry and irrational 
email we might receive from you. 
You have received only very rational and care=ul emails, which are sometimes annoyed, and for good reasons. I 
stil= am shocked at the refusal to pay part of the taxes without extensive fina=cial scrutiny, particularly after the facts 
that I have again described.=C24, I don't know what you have heard about "expensive legal bat=les," but I strongly 
suspect that it is as mistaken as your beliefs a=out my financial situation. I'd be glad to meet, or more easily 
have a 
collective phone fall, but I cannot imagine why you want a mediat=r. If there are some issues, we can discuss them. In 
my mind a= least there is no adversarial conflict for which a mediator is in order.<=b> 
I do hope, again, that we =an resolve this quickly. It is deeply disturbing. And=C2Qunnecessary, unless you 
have something on your minds that you have no= told me. 
A few more comments below.</=iv>
