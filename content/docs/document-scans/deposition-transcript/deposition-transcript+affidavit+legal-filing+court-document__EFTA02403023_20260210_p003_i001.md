1 Introduction 
Doubly or deformed special relativity (DSR) is the hypothesis that the Poincar4 group or its action 
is deformed to take into account the possibility of a maximal momentum or energy for individual 
elementary particles, without violating the relativity of inertial frames(1, 2, 3]. While this is an 
attractive idea, not least because it is accessible to investigation by current experiments[4], inter-
pretations of and predictions for these experiments have been challenged by several confusions 
as to the interpretation of DSR in spacetim05, 6]. These involve the notions of locality and veloc-
ity. The purpose of this paper is to propose an origin for these confusions which afflict spacetime 
descriptions of DSR and to investigate three features of DSR theories which may play a role in 
resolving them. 
One very physical way to understanding the idea of DSR is to see it as a phenomenological 
description which arises in a particular limit of some underlying quantum theory of gravity'. In 
this limit we take, 
h —. 0, AND G —. 0 
(1) 
in such a way that the dimensional constant2
MP 
G 
= 
— 
constant 
(2) 
is held fixed. (We work here in units where c = 1, since we assume there is still an invariant 
velocity.) That is, we turn off both quantum mechanics and gravity, but in such a way as to 
preserve phenomena depending on Mp and c. DSR is then something like the smile that is left of 
the Chesire cat of quantum gravity. We can call this the classical DSR limit of quantum gravity. 
Just like the better studied limits in which we take h 
0 or G 
0 separately, this is a limit that 
must exist if the quantum theory of gravity is well defined. 
It is easy to state how physics may be modified in the DSR limit: momentum space becomes 
curved, with the radius of curvature measured by the invariant Mp. There are then two cases to 
discuss depending on how momentum space may be curved. Poincare invariance may be broken, 
in which case the symmetry group of momentum space will have fewer than the ten generators of 
the Poincar€ algebra. Or, if we want to preserve the existence of a ten parameter symmetry group, 
then momentum space must have constant curvature, ie it has a deSitter or anti-deSitter geometry. 
This results in a deformation of Poincare invariance. This is the basic idea of DSR. 
So long as we stay in momentum space the implementation of this idea is straightforward, but 
issues develop when we ask for the effect on physics in the complementary spacetime description. 
These problems can be seen to arise because we are working in a limit in which h has been taken 
to zero. In this case there is no fixed length or time corresponding to the mass fixed in (2). Instead, 
tp = 
—) 0 
(3) 
This means that the classical DSR limit only yields something new in momentum space. When 
applied to physics in spacetime, the classical DSR limit is ordinary special relativity. 
Another way to say this is that the relationship between momentum space and spacetime 
depends on h being non-zero. We need it to make sense of the fourier transform, without it we
