Note 11— Legal Proceedings 
On May 6, 2014, Nestle Purina filed a lawsuit against us in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri. As amended, Nestle 
Purina's complaint alleges that we have engaged in false advertising, commercial disparagement and unjust enrichment. Nestle Purina asserts that, 
contrary to our advertising and labeling claims, certain BLUE products contain chicken or poultry by-product meals, artificial preservatives and/or 
corn and that certain products in the BLUE grain-free line contain grains. Nestle Purina also alleges that we have made false claims that our 
products (including LifeS'ource Bits) provide superior nutrition and health benefits compare) to our competitors' products. In addition. Nestle 
Purina contends that we have been unjustly enriched as consumers have paid a premium for BLUE products in reliance on these alleged false and 
misleading statements, at the expense of our competitors. Nestle Purina seeks an injunction prohibiting us from making these alleged false and 
misleading statements, as well as treble damages, nstitution and disgorgement of our profits. among other things. In addition, Nestle Purina has 
issued press releases and made other public announcements, including advertising and promotional communications through emails and interact 
and social media websites that make claims similar to those contained in their lawsuit. Nestle Purina seeks a declaratory judgment that these 
statements are true and do not constitute defamation. In addition, a number of related consumer class action lawsuits have been filed making 
allegations similar to Nrstle Purina's and seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief. 
We believe Neale Purina's claims and the related class action lawsuits arc without merit and intend to vigorously defend ourselves. Although we 
have determined that a loss contingency with respect to the Nestle Purina litigation and related class action lawsuits is reasonably possible, such 
litigation and lawsuits are still in their early stages and the final outcome is uncertain. In particular, we have determined that the possible loss or 
range of loss resulting from Neale Purina proceedings and each of the related class action claims cannot be reasonably estimated due to the 
following reasons: (1) the early stages of the proceedings. (2) the lack of specific damages sought by the plaintiffs, (3) the uncertainty as to 
plaintiffs' support for their damages claim, (4) the uncertainty as to factual issues, (5) the uncertainty of number of plaintiffs in the related class 
action claims and (6) our claims against third party defendants and counterclaims against Nestle Purina. 
In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to proceedings, lawsuits and other claims and assessments, which typically include 
consumer complaints and post-termination employment claims. The Company has assessed such contingent liabilities and believes the potential of 
these liabilities is not expected to have a material, if any. effect on the Company's financial position. its results of operations or its cash flows.
