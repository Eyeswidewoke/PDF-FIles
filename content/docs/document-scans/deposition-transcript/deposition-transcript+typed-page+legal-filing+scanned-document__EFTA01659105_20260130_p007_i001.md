The New York Times (11/23, Al, Crowley, 18.61M) reports Haines "served as deputy 
director of the C.I.A. in the Obama administration before succeeding Mr. Blinken as Mr. Obama's 
deputy national security adviser. She, too, is a former aide to Mr. Biden, serving as deputy chief 
counsel to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee from 2007 to 2008 while Mr. Biden was 
chairman. Ms. Haines also served as counsel to Mr. Obama's National Security Council, helping 
him navigate legal issues around counterterrorism operations and pressing for more restraint to 
reduce civilian casualties." 
Bloomberg (11/23, Strohm, 4.73M) reports that, if confirmed, Haines would "be the first 
woman to serve" as DNI. NPR (11/23, Jones, 3.12M) says that Haines "has the respect of many 
in the intelligence community, former director of the CIA John Brennan told NPR. Her 
intelligence career spans over a decade: from the White House to the CIA, the NSC to the 
Department of State." Brennan "said that her varied and extensive intelligence background will 
help the Biden administration hit the ground running in January." 
CNN (11/23, Mucha, Krieg, 83.16M) reports that SSCI Vice Chair Mark Warner (D-VA) 
"immediately leaned on his Republican colleagues to confirm Haines to lead the intelligence 
community." Reuters (11/23, Landay, Hosenball) reports that Republican and Democratic 
"Senate sources said Haines is expected to win confirmation - but not without some hard 
questioning about her role as deputy CIA director from August 2013 to January 2015 and her 
views on national security challenges, from Russia to cyber warfare." 
The Washington Post (11/23, Harris, Nakashima, 14.2M) reports that former PDDNI Sue 
Gordon, "who was also said to be under consideration for the job," said, "I have a great deal of 
respect for Avril. Her relationship with the president-elect and her experience with the CIA 
should serve her, the community and the nation well as she leads the [intelligence community] 
into a very dynamic future that will require not only focus but change." 
Still, the New York Times (11/23, Barnes, 18.61M) reports that the selection of Haines 
"prompted concern from some human rights groups, which questioned her role as the architect 
of the Obama administration's program targeting terrorists with drones, some of which killed 
civilians. But her defenders argue that Ms. Haines helped put in place safeguards on the use of 
force and greater transparency for the drone program." 
NBC News (11/23, Dilanian, Bennett, 6.14M) reports that since leaving the Obama 
administration, Haines "has been affiliated with Columbia University and the Brookings 
Institution, and has consulted for various companies, including the national security data 
contractor Palantir, according to a Brookings biography unearthed by the Intercept. A source 
familiar with her work for Palantir confirmed it to NBC News, saying she advised the firm on 
diversity and advancing roles for women in technology." 
US News & World Report (11/23, Shinkman, 2.4M) also reports on Haines' selection, as 
does CQ Roll Call (11/23, 154K), Bloomberg (11/23, Faries, Strohm, 4.73M), and the 
Washington Examiner (11/23, Dunleavy, 448K), among others. 
Politico (11/23, Forgey, 4.29M) reports that Mayorkas "will become the first Latino 
secretary of Homeland Security." ABC News (11/23, Nagle, Finnegan, 2.97M) reports that 
Mayorkas, "who was born in Cuba and came as a refugee to the United States with his family 
when he was a baby," tweeted in reaction to the announcement, "When I was very young, the 
United States provided my family and me a place of refuge. Now, I have been nominated to be 
the DHS Secretary and oversee the protection of all Americans and those who flee persecution 
in search of a better life for themselves and their loved ones." MeriTalk (11/23, Curran) reports 
that Mayorkas "cut his teeth as a U.S. attorney in the 1980s and 1990s, went into private law 
practice, then headed U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in the first Obama 
administration." 
The Hill (11/23, Bernal, 2.98M) reports that Mayorkas's "selection shows the incoming 
Biden administration is targeting President Trump's executive overhaul of the immigration 
system, regardless of the likelihood of congressional gridlock on the legislative end." Reuters 
(11/23, Hesson) reports that Biden "has pledged to undo many of Trump's restrictive
