conduct. Third, and finally, the Court considers redressability. IA] plaintiff satisfies the 
redressability requirement when he shows that a favorable decision will relieve a discrete injury 
to himself. He need not show that a favorable decision will relieve his every injury." Larson v. 
Valente, 456 U.S. 228, 243 n.15, 102 S.Ct. 1673, 72 L.Ed.2d 33 (1982). Here, the sued officials 
or their successors have duties related to the enforcement of the registry law and -- if the Court 
were to rule in the plaintiffs' favor -- the plaintiffs would be relieved of their obligation to 
register as sex offenders. Therefore, an outcome in plaintiffs' favor would redress the plaintiffs' 
present and future injuries. Because the plaintiffs have standing, the Court turns to the 
defendants' challenge to the technical sufficiency of the plaintiffs' civil rights claim.16 IV. These 
parties are by now be familiar with the applicable 16 Like in Doe I, in contesting the plaintiffs' 
standing, the defendants insist that the Court should examine the underlying circumstances of the 
plaintiffs' convictions. Again, they fail to persuade the Court as to why this is relevant to the 
plaintiffs' standing: a Crime Against Nature by Solicitation conviction is the central 
consideration to finding an actual injury because that is what triggers the continuing registration 
requirement and the risk of an Equal Protection taint. 21 substantive legal and constitutional 
requirements, as this Court has spoken to them in Doe i emphatically. See Doe v. Jindal, 851 F. 
Supp. 2d 995 (E.D. La. 2012). In considering now whether these plaintiffs' allegations 
themselves are at this stage sufficient to withstand the defendants' Rule 12(bX6) challenge, the 
Court reiterates the applicable legal principles. A. Section 1983 imposes civil liability on: Every 
person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State..., 
subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the 
jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the 
Constitution and laws.... 42 U.S.C. § 1983. To allege a § 1983 violation, a plaintiff must state a 
violation of a right secured by the Constitution or laws of the United States and state that the 
deprivation was committed by a person acting under color of state law. Anderson v. Law Firm 
of Shorty, Dooley & Hall, 393 Fed.Appx. 214 (5th Cir. Aug. 26, 2010 (citing Randolph v. 
Cervantes, 130 F.3d 727, 730 (5th Cir. 1997)). Because § 1983 imposes liability only for 
violations of rights protected by federal laws and the Constitution, "[t]he first inquiry in any § 
1983 suit...is whether the plaintiff has been deprived of a right `secured by the Constitution and 
laws.'" Baker v. McCollan, 443 U.S. 137, 140 (1970). Here, the plaintiffs allege that they are 
being denied Equal 22 Protection under the Fourteenth Amendment because they continue to be 
subject to sex offender registration pursuant to La.R.S. § 15:542(A)(1)(a). The plaintiffs claim 
that they are each registered or registrable solely because they were convicted of La.R.S. § 
14:89(A)(2Xprior to August 15, 2010) or La.R.S. § 14:89.2 (after August 15, 2010) --
Solicitation statute. Louisiana's Crimes Against Nature by In the first generation of this case, 
this Court determined that because Louisiana's Prostitution statute and Crime Against Nature by 
Solicitation statute punish identical conduct, requiring one group of offenders to register as sex 
offenders, but not the other, violates the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee of Equal Protection 
under the laws. F. Supp. 2d 995 (E.D. La. 2012). Doe v. Jindal, 851 Plaintiffs here complain 
that, notwithstanding Act 402 or this Court's declaratory judgment -that the application of the 
Registry Law to those convicted of Crime Against Nature by Solicitation...and their inclusion on 
the State Sex Offender & Child Predator Registry pursuant to La.R.S. § 15:542, deprives them 
of Equal Protection of the laws in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States 
Constitution -they continue to be subject to the sex offender registration requirement, in 
violation of their right to Equal Protection, given that identically situated individuals convicted 
of solicitation of Prostitution are not required to register. 23 B. The Equal Protection Clause of
