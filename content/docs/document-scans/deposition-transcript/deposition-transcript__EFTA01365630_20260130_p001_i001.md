(A) 
if an obligation of the obligor has a published rating from Moody's then the 
S&P Rating will be determined in accordance with the methodologies for establishing the 
Moody's Rating, except that the S&P Rating of such Collateral Obligation shall be (I) one 
subcategory below the S&P equivalent of the rating assigned by Moody's if such Collateral 
Obligation is rated "Baa3" or higher by Moody's and (2) two subcategories below the S&P 
equivalent of the rating assigned by Moody's if such Collateral Obligation is rated "Ba I" or lower 
by Moody's: provided that no more than 13% of the Collateral Obligations, by Aggregate 
Principal Balance, may be given an S&P Rating based on a rating given by Moody's as provided 
in this subclause (A): or 
(B) 
if no other security or obligation of the obligor is rated by S&P or Moody's. then 
the Issuer or the Investment Manager on behalf of the Issuer, shall apply to S&P for a rating 
estimate, which shall be its S&P Rating; provided that, pending receipt. its S&P Rating will be 
determined as set forth in clause (vii) below;

rating from Moody's. then the S&P Rating shall be determined in accordance with the 
methodologies for establishing the Moody's Rating, except that the S&P Rating of such Structured 
Finance Obligation shall be (1) two subcategories below the S&P equivalent of the rating assigned 
by Moody's if such Structured Finance Obligation is rated "Baa3" or higher by Moody's and (2) 
three subcategories below the S&P equivalent of the rating assigned by Moody's if such Structured 
Finance Obligation is rated "Bah" or lower by Moody's; provided that no mom than 15% of the 
Collateral Obligations, by Aggregate Principal Balance. may be given an S&P Rating based on a 
rating given by Moody's as provided in this subclause (B): or

behalf of the Issuer, shall apply to S&P for a rating estimate, which shall be its S&P Rating; 
provided that pending receipt, its S&P Rating will be determined as set forth in clause (vii) 
below:

(A) 
if the Issuer owns only one issue of debt obligation of an issuer with a Distressed 
Exchange Offer pending. then (I) with respect to a Current Pay Obligation ranking higher in priority 
(before and after the exchange) than the obligation subject to the Distressed Exchange Offer, the 
higher of (x) the rating derived by adjusting such Current Pay Obligation's issue rating up or down 
by the number of notches specified in Table I below for its related asset specific recovery rating and 
(Y)"CCC-." and (2) with respect to any other such Current Pay' Obligation. "CCC-"; and 
(B) 
if the Issuer owns more than one issue of obligations of an issuer with a Distressed 
Exchange Offer pending, then with respect to each such Current Pay Obligation, the rating 
corresponding to the weighted average rating "points" in Table 2 below calculated by dividing (I) 
the sum of the products of (x) the outstanding par amount of each Current Pay Obligation multiplied 
by (y) the rating "points" in Table 2 below corresponding to the rating of such Current Pay 
Obligation as determined pursuant to clause (A) above by (2) the aggregate outstanding par amount 
of all such Current Pay Obligations issued by the issuer with the Distressed Exchange Offer pending
