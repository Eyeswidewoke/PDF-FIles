Richard, 
Let me see if I can articulate Jeffrey's comments and reiterate what I tr=ed to convey (not very effectively) early on in 
the discussion. 
The split-interest property purchase is an estate planning technique design=d to fit within an "exception" to a provision 
of the tax Code (under S=ction 2702) that would otherwise trigger a gift tax where family members p=rchase "term" 
interests (such as a life interest and a remainder inter=st) in a residence. To fit within the exception, and avoid any one 
famil= member purchasing a term interest from making a gift to another family me=ber purchasing a term interest, each 
family member who participates in the=split purchase of the residence must pay the actuarial value of his or her=term 
interest—with his or her own funds. 
If Debra uses funds Leon gives her, the IRS treats this as if Leon purchase= both his and Debra's term interests and then 
made a gift to Debra of h=r term interest, which gift would be taxable to Leon as it would not qual=fy for a marital 
deduction. To qualify for a marital deduction, the spous= must either receive the property outright or be given certain 
rights to t=e property which Debra would not have with a second life term interest. 
Even assuming Debra is willing to use her independent funds in connection w=th a split purchase of a residence, there 
are other factors to consider in=deciding the best way to structure the split purchase. In addition to the=pros and cons 
outlined in the chart I sent you, there is a certain comfort=level regarding the transaction that should weigh into your 
decision. 
As I mentioned in an earlier email, the split interest purchase technique o=ly works under a specific set of circumstances 
(it must be a new residence=purchase, each family member buying a term interest must have/use is or he= own funds—
not funds recently received from any other family member part=cipating in the split purchase). This means that the 
technique has not bee= as widely used , and accordingly not as heavily scrutinized by the IRS, a= other planning 
techniques. As noted above, the split interest property p=rchase is safe harbored in the Code or regulations (like a 
qualified per=onal residence trust►, but rather is purchase structured to fall within an=exception provided for in the 
Code. My understanding (I never had occasi=n to use this technique when I practiced) is that most of the split intere=t 
purchases that passed muster with the IRS have been structured with only=two term interests: a life interest purchased 
by a senior family member, =nd a remainder interest purchased by junior family members (or a trust for=their benefit). 
We are therefore more confident that the split-interest p=rchase will fall within the exception if structure in this 
manner. 
Alan did find a couple of private letter rulings (not binding on the IRS wi=h respect to anyone other than the taxpayers to 
whom they are issued) wher= the IRS approved structures involving two life estates where all term int=rest holders
