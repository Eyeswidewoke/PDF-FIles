Okay [laughter], but along the chain, one construct built to another construct to another construct to another construct. 
Very useful. New York City is a construct. Latitude is a construct. Longitude is a construct. Time is it construct. Money is a 
construct. Wall Street is a construct. Religion is a construct. God is a construct. Universe is a construct, which you call a 
model, Okay. So, this led me to consciousness, exploring consciousness. Where now, you have—you know I just came 
from this conference, on the science of consciousness, where you have physicalists, you have dualists, you have 
panpsychists, you have idealists, and they're all arguing about the constructs. 
So the physicalists are now in a difficult position, because they're trying to explain consciousness with the construct of 
physicality, and you can't. Because physicality itself is a construct. Then you have the idealists going back to Plato who 
are saying it's all mental. But even mental ideas are constructs. Then you have the dualists, Descartes, the two are 
separate, mind and body. But then how do you explain their interaction? It violates simple laws like thermodynamics. If 
mind is separate and body is separate, how do I lift my arm? I start with a thought so I do this. How do I speak, how do I 
walk, how do I do anything? So, dualism doesn't make me happy. Idealism doesn't make me happy. Physicalism, I don't 
know what matter is anymore. 
I interviewed the Nobel laureate Wilczek, physicist from MIT. So I said, "What is matter?" "It's particles." I said, "What 
are particles, subatomic particles?" He says, "They are little things." I said, "But then everybody says that's a wave 
potential, that's in Hilbert space. What is that? Where is Hilbert space?" He says, "It's mathematical." "What is it?" "It's 
infinitely dimensional or zero dimensional." "Where is it?" The usual answer is "Shut up and calculate," right? So I 
realized that the entire new paradigm of multiverse, superstrings, eternal inflation, whatever, is all in mathematical 
imagination. Hilbert space is in mathematical imagination, the wave potential is in mathematical imagination. I said to 
Wilczek, "What is matter?" And he said, "We're still trying to figure that out." [Laughter.] I mean this is coming from a 
Nobel laureate who discovered a particle, you know. So I ended up where I began, which is non-dualism, that there is 
only consciousness. 
Matt: Isn't that idealism? 
Deepak: Idealism comes out of non-dualism. 
Matt: So there are two types of monism [non-dualism]. There's materialism 
<https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/consumer-behavior> and then there is idealism. [Each holds that] 
there's only matter or there's only consciousness. 
Deepak: Okay then we can say idealism is closest to non-duality. They don't use that word in the East. Let's go for lunch. 
[We head downstairs.] 
Deepak: With idealism one usually relates to Plato in the West or to Bishop Berkeley and all those guys, you know. But 
basically, what idealism espouses, it's mental. But non-dualism says even mental is a construct. When you say mental 
you have words. As soon as you have a word for an experience it's no longer fundamental. 
Matt: Non-dualism is a construct too. 
Deepak: If I have to use words, yes. 
Matt: There's no getting away from constructs. 
Deepak: No, there is a way of getting away from constructs. It's called transcendence. Shut up and just be. 
Matt: We never stop filtering experience—
Deepak: Every experience is filtered through given constructs. There is no getting away from it. But then we start looking 
at consciousness—let's find our table. [We find our table.]
