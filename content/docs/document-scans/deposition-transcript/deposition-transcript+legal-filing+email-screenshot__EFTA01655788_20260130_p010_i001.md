March 7. Prosecutors identified Berge as the founder and CEO of Edina-based Keep Safe Investments, a financial 
planning and investment services firm. She also co-owned Edina-based J&K Connect LLC, a company that invested 
in real estate through buying, renovating, and re-selling properties, according to the FBI. The article noted that 
between June 2020 and February 2023, Berge repeatedly withdrew client funds in varying amounts between 
$5,000 and $220,000, and deposited the funds into bank accounts she controlled, authorities said. In total, Berge 
withdrew $1.6 million in this manner and — instead of putting it in retirement savings plans and other secure 
investment accounts — used it to buy properties in Edina for her real estate business, according to the FBI. Berge 
concealed her fraud by falsely labeling her illicit withdrawals as "management" or "administrative," authorities 
said. 
FBI Raids Office, Homes Tied to California Investment Company Amid Criminal Investigation 
The Orange County Register (02/29, Schwebke) reported that FBI agents raided the Newport Beach office and 
homes of two real estate investment executives this week, seizing boxes of materials as part of an ongoing criminal 
investigation. The article added that agents descended on the Newport Beach and Laguna Beach residences of AB 
Capital's co-owners, said Brian Werlemman, a wealth manager who alleges he was defrauded out of about $2.7 
million in 2018 as part of an elaborate Ponzi scheme orchestrated by the company. The raids lasted several hours, 
with FBI agents using a bullhorn to announce their presence to those inside the homes, Werlemman said. The 
article mentioned that Laura Eimiller, spokesperson for the FBI's Los Angeles Field Office, confirmed that the 
searches are connected to an ongoing criminal investigation but declined to provide further details. 
Most Victims Targeted in Sextortion Scams Are Teenage Boys, Say FBI Agents 
WMC (NBC-5) (02/29, Jaglois) reported that FBI agents in Memphis are warning parents that sextortion cases are 
on the rise. The article quoted Taneka Blacknell, an FBI Supervisory Special Agent for the FBI's Memphis field office, 
who said, "This is not sexual. It's a financially motivated crime, because of how we've historically looked at victims 
— boys versus girls, the subjects know that, so they're quick to pretend to be girls, pretend to be girls fascinated 
with boys, and convincing them to share this inappropriate and explicit material." 
'Rust' Assistant Director Admits Negligence in Gun Safety Check 
UPI (02/29, Moran) reported that the first assistant director of Rust testified in court that he was "negligent" by 
failing to check safety measures before a prop gun got into the hands of actor Alec Baldwin, who accidentally shot 
and killed cinematographer Halyna Hutchins while on the move set in 2021. The article added that David Halls, the 
first assistant director on Rust, gave emotional testimony Thursday during the trial of armorer Hannah Gutierrez, 
26, who has been charged with involuntary manslaughter in the incident. The article stated that Baldwin, who is 
also facing involuntary manslaughter charges and scheduled to stand trial in July, has consistently maintained 
he never pulled the trigger on the gun that fired and killed Hutchins and wounded the film's director, Joel Souza. 
The FBI and independent firearms experts insist it was nearly impossible for the weapon to fire without the trigger 
being pulled.

seven states, then to laundering the stolen money through casinos, a federal prosecutor in Missouri announced. 
The article added that Xaviar Michael Babudar, 29, also pleaded guilty Wednesday to money laundering and taking 
stolen property across state lines, admitting he engaged in 11 bank and credit union robberies or attempted 
robberies in 2022 and 2023. The article noted that under his plea deal, Babudar must pay at least $532,675 to the 
victim's financial institutions and forfeit "any property involved in his money laundering activity, including an 
autographed painting of Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes II that has been recovered by the FBI."
