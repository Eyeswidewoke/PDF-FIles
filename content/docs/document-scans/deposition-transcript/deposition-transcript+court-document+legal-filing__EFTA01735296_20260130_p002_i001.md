interpreter. She adopted her Expert Report. She is of the opinion that proper procedures, according to Swedish 
law and stated policy, have not been followed in this case. She says that the use of the PAW under European 
law is disproportionate. She says the handling of the case has been improper in a number of respects. Those 
defects arc set out in detail in her report, and I will not repeat them in full here. In short, the complaints in the 
report and in live evidence are: 
• 
The rust prosecutor confirmed details of the allegations to a tabloid newspaper, which breaches 
confidentiality but is not unlawful. 
• 
Ms Ny allowed an appeal against the initial decision not to prosecute (which is permissible in 
Swedish law but unfair as Mr Assange was not allowed to make submissions). 
• 
The complainant's lawyer, Mr Borgstorrn, has been critical of Mr Assange in the press saying 
he is a coward for not returning to Sweden. 
• 
The prosecutor Ms Ny is "biased against men and takes for granted that everyone prosecuted is 
guilty... She is so preoccupied with the situation of battered and raped women that she has lost 
her balance". Ms Ny is in favour of locking up innocent men. 
• 
Ms Ny did not arrange for questioning to take place in a more appropriate way, for example by 
Mutual Legal Assistance: "It looks malicious." 
• 
There is an improper motive behind the issue of the EAW. The real motive is that Mr Assange 
is outside Sweden and Ms Ny wants to arrest him immediately after he is interviewed, 
regardless or what he says. "That may be her approach. Let him suffer for a bit so he can be a 
bit softer." "Everything is peculiar. The case is not proceeding normally." 
• 
Using the EAW is disproportionate. 
• 
The EAW has not been issued for prosecution, but for the purposes of enforcing the order for 
detention referred to at box (b) of the EAW. The prosecutor has repeatedly stated that she has 
obtained the warrant to question Mr Assange. This is simply a Preliminary Investigation which 
is defined in the code and ends before a decision to prosecute is taken. 
• 
Ms Ny is not the proper issuing judicial authority. 
• 
There are political considerations behind this prosecution. The issue of sexual offences is very 
political in Sweden. 
• 
The rape trial will take place behind closed doors. The trial will include lay members who have 
been politically selected. 
In cross-examination the witness told me she is not an expert in Mutual Legal Assistance. She confirmed that 
she had no direct personal knowledge of what happened in this investigation before Mr Assange left Sweden. 
Her evidence is based upon the facts supplied to her by the defence lawyers. [In her proof she said Ms Ny had 
made no effort to interview him before he left with her permission and knowledge on 27th September.] She 
confirmed that if the defence lawyer had told the prosecutor that he was unable to contact the defendant for 
interview, then the position would be different. "It would be a different case. However it didn't happen like 
that". When what Ms Ny told the Svea Court of Appeal was put to the expert she said she did not know that. 
Shc agreed that before a Swedish court can issue a domestic warrant it must be satisfied that there is a "probable
