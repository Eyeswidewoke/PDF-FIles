West Bank Pro=ests Raise Fears Of Third Intifada 
Dalia Hatuqa=/p> 
February 24 -- Acco=ding to the blogosphere and media, a third intifada has been just around t=e corner for a few 
months now. However, as clashes raged through the =est Bank between Palestinians and the Israeli army over the last 
two days that followed the death of Arafat Jaradat — = 30-year-old Palestinian man held in an Israeli jail — this rhetoric 
hit=new heights. Protests and confrontations continued in the West Bank today,=most notably in Jaradat's hometown of 
Sa'ir, elsewhere in Hebron, Nablus, and outside of Ofer, the Israeli =ilitary prison on the outskirts of Ramallah, where 
demonstrations had alre=dy been taken place almost everyday for the past week in support of four P=Iestinian hunger 
strikers, including Samer Issawi. Israeli news outlets — including Haaretz, The Jerusalem Po=t and Arutz Sheva — all 
wondered aloud whether these heightened ten=ions marked the beginnings of a third intifada, raising many questions: 
We=e these reflections of fears brewing inside Israel, or did they constitute wishful thinking? In other words, would 
ano=her intifada be beneficial to Israel at a time when it seems to have been =osing many PR battles of late? Would an 
outbreak of hostilities provide Is=ael with a much-needed justification to the international community to warrant its 
ongoing military occupation?=/span> 
Or is a third intif=da exactly the last thing Israel wants at the moment? One can argue for th=s line of thinking when 
looking at repeated calls by Israeli officials, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, fo= the Palestinian Authority 
(PA) <http://www.timesofisrael.com/third-intifada-is-already-raging-pa=officials-say/> to stop the demonstrations 
flooding th= streets of the West Bank. In fact, Netanyahu's envoy Itzhak Molho spoke=to Palestinian officials and 
demanded them to "calm down" the protests. Israel also said it would release so=e of the tax monies it has been 
withholding since Palestinians upgraded th=ir status at the UN. Netanyahu's reasoning for the transfer—which 
some=can interpret as bribery — is "so that [the PA] won't have an excuse not to enforce calm on =he ground."

Coincidentally, jus= two days ago, Abbas told Al Arabiya TV 
<http://www.jpost.com/MiddleEast/Article.aspx?id=304248> , in a message that seems to have been aimed mo=e at 
Israelis than the Palestinians, that he supported protests against th= occupation, but stressed that these should be non-
violent in nature. "A=med resistance is banned," he said. "This is a law and it is forbidden. It is also forbidden in the Gaza 
Str=p." The reference to Gaza suggests that Abbas has a say over what goes o= in the coastal enclave run by Hamas. And 
though there have been repeated =ttempts to reconcile Hamas with Abbas' ruling party, Fatah, nothing fruitful has yet 
come of them - certainly not=anything that would prompt Abbas to suggest that he can control what happe=s in the 
Gaza Strip. A telling indication of this is that following Jarada='s death, Palestinian factions in Gaza held an urgent 
meeting to discuss a response t= the man's demise. <http://972mag.com/prisoner-issue-and-settler-violence-drive-
esca=ation-of-west-bank-protests/66577/> 
Meanwhile, more tha= 4,000 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons went on hunger strike to prote=t the death of their 
fellow inmate. Four of these prisoners have been on s=rike for months now, and fears for their lives have been 
expressed by their families and human rights groups.= According to the Israeli human rights group, B'Tselem, there are 
more tha= 4,500 Palestinian detainees, 178 of whom are being held without charge or=trial.
