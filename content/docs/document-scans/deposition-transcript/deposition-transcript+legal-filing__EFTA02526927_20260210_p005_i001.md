=/div> 
PS. About your earlier letter concerning=the estate plan, though I responded explaining why you and Max are 
complet=ly wrong about the Marital Trust, there are a few points I left out.q=iv> 
One, I'm amazed, and not a lit=le disturbed, that you even looked into this in such detail. These a=e matters I 
never paid any attention to until I started looking into my af=airs and discovered what was being done by my advisers, as 
I've just i=ce again described. I do not comprehend why you felt that you should=undertake this inquiry -- just it would 
have been unthinkable for me to ha=e inquired into your affairs when you were making decisions I found questi=nable 
and was supporting them, financially and otherwise. 
But put that aside. 
<=iv>The first sentence of your letter is Max's interpretation, which=is flatly false, and surely ridiculous. We 
never thought of the craz= idea of setting up two separate Trusts, one to manage my "individual=property,"and the 
other to for M to manage her "individual prope=ty." We had property jointly, not divided into mine and hers. A=ain, Eric 
suggested this pretense solely for tax purposes. We agreed, but =he idea that you (and Max) express could never have 
occurred to us, and I =ind it hard to understand how it occurred to you. 
I have already reviewed the facts about the way the Marital =rust was established and the obvious intentions, so 
won't go through i= again, but your account in the letter is entirely wrong, though it does e=ploit a legal technicality. It 
is hard for me to imagine how this we=rd interpretation could even have occurred to you. 
Aside from many factual errors along the w=y, which I won't review, I'm also amazed, and shocked, to read suc= 
statements as "Carol's intention to leave some money to your chi=dren." Carol's intention? Alone? Not my 
intention?Q=A0 Is this your conception of what our family life was? I hope not..C240 In reality, neither of us had 
separate "intentions." We de=ided together how to ensure that the children and grandchildren would be v=ry 
adequately cared for from my earnings of the years, and how the survivo= would be as well. 
I've already=explained, once again, why you are radically misled about what happened to=my IRA under Max's 
and Bainco's supervision, until I started looki=g into it and ended the practices that were rapidly depleting it. 
You say that you learned about Valeria in 20=3 -- that is, when we met. It's quite true that I didn't con=ult 
lawyers or financial planners or Harry before we decided to get marrie=, just as Carol and I didn't, just as none of you 
did. I don'=t frankly understand what you are thinking. 
You are, again, mistaken about the sale of the Lexington house.4,=A0 The facts are as I have repeatedly 
described. I surely would neve= have contemplated buying a Mem Drive apartment in a co-op with regular ex=enses 
and taking out a loan from a family trust had I not assumed that the=loan would be until the sale of the Lexington house 
that would cover the c=sts of the new apartment.
