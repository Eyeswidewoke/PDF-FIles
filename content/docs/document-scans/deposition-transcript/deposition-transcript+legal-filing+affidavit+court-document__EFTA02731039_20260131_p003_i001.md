Victim Interviews and Corroborating Evidence 
New York and Victim-I 
Epstein spent significant time in Manhattan during the relevant period. As described 
by at least one individual who was victimized in—and, as discussed further below, recruited other 
minor victims in—New York City ("Victim-1"), Epstein victimized at least dozens of girls in New 
York, in addition to the dozens of girls he victimized in Florida. 
In particular, we have met with Victim-1, who has been cooperative with the 
investigation and is represented by counsel. In several proffers, Victim-1 has described how she 
was recruited to engage in sexual contact with Epstein in approximately 2002, at the age of 
approximately 14. While at a New York City club, Victim-1 met another teenager who described 
having worked for a rich man, giving topless massages—and recruiting other girls to do the same—
and invited Victim-1 to make money this way. At the time, Victim-1 was living by herself and 
supporting herself financially, having moved away from a difficult home life. As further detailed 
below, Victim-1 ultimately visited Epstein's Manhattan mansion to engage in sexual massages and 
other sex acts at least dozens of times between approximately 2002 and 2005. 
During her visits to the mansion, Victim-1 performed erotic massages on Epstein, 
including being partially or fully nude while she massaged him. Most or all of the massages 
performed by Victim-1 would end with Epstein masturbating and ejaculating; during some of the 
massages, Epstein touched the genitals of Victim-1 with his hand or with a vibrator or sex toy. He 
also commonly asked Victim-1 to pinch or twist his nipples. Epstein ordinarily paid Victim-1 
$300 in cash after a massage was completed. All of these interactions with Epstein occurred while 
Victim-1 was a minor, including times when Epstein touched her genitals. 
After Victim-I's initial meetings with Epstein, he asked her, in sum and substance, to 
recruit other girls for the same activity. Over approximately two years, Victim-1 estimates that 
she brought dozens of girls to Epstein to provide massages, starting with girls she knew from her 
community and eventually strangers whom Victim-1 met at bars, clubs, or other locations. 
Victim-1 would describe to the girls what was expected, i.e., that they would provide erotic 
massages to Epstein, while nude, and that Epstein might touch them or ask them to touch him. 
Victim-1 would schedule appointments for the girls by phone with Epstein's assistant, "Leslie." 
Based on the investigation, we have identified "Leslie" as Leslie Groff. 
Each time Victim-1 brought a girl to Epstein, Victim-1 was paid $300, and the other 
girl also would receive $300, always in cash. Victim-1 states that Epstein knew that she was under 
the age of 18, and that he knew other girls she brought were under 18. In particular, Victim-1 
recalls Epstein having asked her how old she was and her truthfully telling Epstein that she was 
14 years old. After Victim-1 brought a girl to Epstein, he would sometimes either tell Victim-1 to 
bring the girl again, if he liked her, or tell Victim-1 not to bring the girl again. Victim-1 noticed 
that the girls Epstein liked were generally younger and more petite. Epstein would tell Victim-1: 
"you know what I like," which she took to mean underage, petite girls. Epstein would occasionally 
indicate his displeasure with Victim-1 for bringing a particular girl, including expressing to 
Victim-1 that he did not like dark-skinned girls. Later on, as Victim-1 grew older and knew fewer 
young girls to bring, she brought older girls, which Epstein expressed displeasure about. Victim-1 
recalls at least one occasion when she saw a girl show Epstein an ID to prove she was under 18.
