Atty Guy Fronstin and acknowledged the deal made between them. 
Fronstin stated in the message, he spoke with his client, Jeffrey 
Epstein, and agreed to the deal. Fronstin asked to call off the grand 
jury as they would accept this deal. Belohlavic stated a probable 
cause would be needed to book Epstein in the county jail and would let 
me know as to when it would be needed. I explained my disapproval of 
the deal and not being consulted prior to the deal being offered. 
However I expressed that was only my opinion and the final approval 
would come from the Chief of Police. She explained to have Chief 
Reiter call Barry Krisher about the deal. I left the area and 
returned to the police station where I briefed the Chief about the 
deal offered. 
I checked my voice mail messages and discovered a message from III 
stepmother for the victim 
She was calling because the State 
Attorney's Office still had—hot returned any of her calls as to when 
they are needed for this case. I then called ASA Belohlavic's office 
and left messages for her to call the victims on this case and 
explained to them what the State Attorney's Office had done. 
On April 17, 2006, at approximately 4:30 pm, State Attorney 
Investigator Tim Valentine called to officially notify me of the 
cancellation of the Grand Jury. He requested I contact the victims 
that had been served to appear, to notify them of the cancellation. I 
advised Valentine that as this Grand Jury session was called based on 
the State Attorney's Office decision to have the victims heard by the 
Grand Jury that I felt it was the States Attorney's Office 
responsibility to contact the victims and advise them of the reason 
they were no longer needed.
