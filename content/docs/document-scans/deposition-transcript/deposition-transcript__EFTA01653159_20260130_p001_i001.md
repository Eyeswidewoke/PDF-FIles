Those are good questions, and to some degree they are not easily answered. Regarding whethe=an obtain/renew another work visa, it may depend a lot on the 
resolution of the case= will have to meet certain work criteria when she reapplies. Based on 
work history, business success, and skills, that may end up not 
being a problem, but the publicity about her and the Epstein case (as well as the current pandemic) makes this more uncertain. This uncertainty is a key reason for her 
exploring the 1Wisa option. 
Regarding the second question of when would she know whether a renewed work visa would be approved, it's not a question of time. To make the application, her 
understanding is that she must be outside the U.S. and it's possible that she could apply and find out in the same day if she's denied, however, then she may not be able to 
get back into the U.S. to continue her life here or to continue assisting with the investigation while here (unless the Government assisted her in re-entering). 
In additionMas to leave the U.S. in August because her admission to the U.S. was permitted in relation to when her passport was due to expire. Her passport is set to 
expire in August. She's submitted a renewal application through a consulate. But in order to have her stay here approved until the end of her VISA, her understanding is 
that she needs to leave the U.S. and, then, reenter to get the new stamp. 
Please let us know if you have additional questions. 
Thanks, 
Aaron

Aaron, 
Thanks for getting in touch and for letting us know well in advance. Let us discuss internally, and if we haven't gotten back to you in a few weeks, please feel free to follow 
up. in the intenm, is there a possibility of-obtaining 
/ renewing another work visa? And If so, do you know what the timeline of that would be - I.e., when 
she would know whether such a visa would be approved? I'm not welrversed in this area of law so I'm not sure I'm asking exactly the right questions, and happy to discuss 
further if that's helpful. 
thanks,

Greetings, 
I hope you're all well.

Erica and I are contacting you because= E2 visa expires in March of 2021. She'd like to apply for a TVisa, which is for sex trafficking victims. To do so, she'd need a 
supporting Declaration from Law Enforcement, like the one that is attached. We're hoping that your office would support such an application.
