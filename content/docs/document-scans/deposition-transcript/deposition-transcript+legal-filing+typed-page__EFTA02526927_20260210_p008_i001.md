explained in my let=er. Your response was a statement of the legal issues as you understood them and advice to have 
lawyers clarify the matter. 
Same now.=C2* I wrote you several long personal letters, and this is your first response.=C2* Virtually a legal 
document. And I have to say I'm surprised that you have the information you include, which happens to be incorrect in 
crucial respects as I explained in earlier letters and will repeat. 
In particul=r, your account of the sale of the Lexington house and the purchase of the apartmen= is incorrect, as 
I have just reviewed once again. The facts are as I have already described them, entirely unlike the story you present 
here, which I presume you received from Max and Sam. 
Some of you= letter is correct. I did not consult with lawyers before we decided to marry -- I won't comment 
further on this. And it is true that the earli=r estate planning did not take into account that I might marry, a fact that has 
been causing some remarkable actions. I won't comment on this either, but will simply add below a letter I wrote to you 
some time ago but never sent. 
You state, =orrectly, that it would be wrong for Valeria to end up as your tenant. But then right below you say 
that the preferred solution was for the apartment we bought to be in a trust of which you are the beneficiaries, which 
means that she would end up as your tenant. That aside, why should the apartment have been in a trust at all? 
As I wrote =ou several times, we are very happy together. Valeria gave up her family, friend=, and a flourishing 
professional career to be with me — a very precio=s gift. I want to make sure that she is well taken care of when I die, 
not beholden to anyone, not anyone's tenant. 
About the &=uot;scam," yes, there is one, and I have described it to you several times. To repeat again: the 
mandatory annual withdrawal from the IRA is about $300,000, which certainly does sound like a lot of money, until we 
look at what was happening to it. About half went to distributions to the family. The remaining half was spent in taxes 
and management fees for the entire estate. Over and above this were the payments for Wellf=eet and Alex's medical 
expenses, all drawn from the IRA in excess of the ma=datory withdrawal and therefore subject to exorbitant taxes. 
That's befo=e one cent was used for personal expenses. If I had had a lawyer/financ=al adviser, he would have informed 
me that this is going to quickly deplete the IRA. But I didn't. I finally learned about it and ended it. 
Same with t=e demand for financial analysis. When money from my IRA was being distributed to 10 family 
members, no one asked them to provide a financial analysis.Q=A0 Or in any other case, like distributions from the 
Marital Trust. The demand arises only when I request money (which I should have access to anyway) for the purpose of 
paying taxes that are exorbitant for the reasons I have just described again. 
You say tha= my expenditures have gone up since then. Since you seem to have gotten information about my 
expenses, could you explain how they went up? I can give you some hints. We were, for example, paying tens of 
thousands of dollars to Max for things like making a will, which, when he finally sent it to us, was so outlandish that we 
simply trashed it -- for example, with a demand that we list all of our tangible assets, including teaspoons and pillow 
cases, presumably to make sure that nothing would go to Valeria. And other such conditions. So yes, those were 
expenses. If you know of other ones, please let me know. 
You clearly=trust Max and are accepting his version of events and circumstances rather than mine.4)=A0 That 
surprises me, but to repeat, I don't trust him at all, for go=d reasons, which I've explained repeatedly -- leaving out a fair 
amount.<=font> 
Could add m=re, but won't. To go back to the beginning, I find it difficult to un=erstand why you are persisting 
in these inquiries. We are a family. We care for each other. I don't understand why you are doing =his.
