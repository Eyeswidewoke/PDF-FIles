Client(s) Strategy Requests. Please check as many of the following strategies ("Structured Products") as may apply. With all Structured Products, in the 
event of early liquidation, there may not be a liquid market, and the investor may experience a loss due to costs involved with unwinding the investment. 
Furthermore, investors are exposed to the credit risk of the issuing entity. which in the case of a default, may result in a significant, or total, loss to 
the investor. 
Principal Protected Structured Notes and Certificates of Deposit - 90%100% Principal Protection which may result in lower returns than a 
direct investment in the underlying. Investor understands that principal is protected only if held to maturity and that FDIC insurance applies only to 
Market-Linked Certificates of Deposit up to the statutory limits. 
K 2. Buffered Notes - Partial principal protection (usually protection from the first 10%-20% decline in the underlying) which serves as a buffer to loss. 
Investors participate in the downside, either on a l -for-1 or leveraged basis, in the amount the underlying declines beyond the predetermined buffer 
level. Upside participation in the underlying may be leveraged and is sometimes capped. 
Contingently Protected (including Reverse Convertible and Callable Yield) Notes - Full Pnncipal Protection only if a pre-set barrier is not 
breached. If a barrier is breached, investors would lose the level of protection and participate in any decline in the underlying, if any, at maturity. 
Structures include but are not limited to those that pay investors a fixed coupon payment, participation in upside if the underlying performs 
positively, or both. The investor acknowledges that settlement at maturity may be in the form of cash or physical delivery of the underlying. 
K 4. Market Participation Notes - Zero principal protection. Full downside participation. MPNs may be linked to one or more undertyings in the form of 
a weighted basket or overlay and may be customized to offer straight 1 for 1, or varying degrees of upside participation, leverage or a fixed coupon. 
Investors in MPNs seek access to an underlying which is generally complex and which may be inaccessible to them in the market. DB and third 
party proprietary indices are typically used as an underlying. 
The following representations are applicable for an individual account. If this is a joint, trust, partnership, limited liability company, corporate or other type of 
account, the word "I" in the following paragraphs shall mean each owner in the case of a joint account or the authorized signatory making representations on 
behalf of the trust, partnership, limited liability company or other entity in the case of such account type, as the case may be. 
I represent that the purchase of Structured Products is suitable for this account in light of my investment objectives, financial situation, risk tolerance and 
knowledge. I hereby confirm that I am the source of and attest to the accuracy of the above information and authorize Deutsche Bank and its subsidiaries to verify 
any representation contained therein, at their discretion. I have made my own decision to invest in Structured Products and have made the determination of the 
suitability of such an investment based upon my own judgment, adequate information I have independently obtained (from sources other than Deutsche Bank) 
about Structured Products and consultation with my own advisors as to the legal, regulatory, tax, business, financial, accounting and related aspects of my 
purchase of Structured Products to the extent I have deemed necessary. I have not relied on Deutsche Bank or any person or entity affiliated with Deutsche Bank 
in connection with my investigation of Structured Products, my decision to invest in Structured Products or my determination as to the suitability of such an 
investment; I will promptly notify Deutsche Bank, in writing, of any material change in the above-stated information. I understand that Structured Products may 
have a derivative component in the form of one or more embedded options, and that such optionls1 may have the result of reducing the gains or interest income, 
or increasing the losses (which may include a loss of principal) on the Structured Products, whether held to maturity or sold prior to maturity, to a greater extent 
than would be the case if the Structured Products did not have such a derivative component. 
The representations in this paragraph only apply if Deutsche Bank exercises trading discretion over the assets in the Account. To the extent permitted by 
applicable law and rules, I authorize Deutsche Bank to purchase for my Account Structured Products underwritten, placed or issued by Deutsche Bank or in 
which Deutsche Bank is a dealer or market maker. I understand that when Deutsche Bank acts in transactions for my Account as my agent. as principal for its 
own account or as a counterparty. Deutsche Bank may charge me fees or receive from sources other than me profits or other benefits that will be in addition to 
the fees I pay Deutsche Bank for advice under any separate agreement with me. I agree that Deutsche Bank need not disclose to me its relationship with or 
interest in these issuers, investments or transactions, including the nature or amount of any profit, compensation or other benefit Deutsche Bank may receive. 
I agree that I will read carefully the prospectus, term sheet and any other offering document (any such prospectus, term sheet or offering document, an "Offering 
Document") that I may receive in connection with the acquisition of any Structured Product for my Account, including disclosures in any such Offering Document 
describing the fees I may pay in connection with the Structured Product as well as representations and warranties that I win be deemed to have made in
