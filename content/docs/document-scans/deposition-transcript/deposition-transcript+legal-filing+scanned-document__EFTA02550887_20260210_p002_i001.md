"People have a misconception that Muslims hate Jews," said Baumann. "But here is an example of them working 
with us." 
Indeed, though conventionally viewed as adversaries both here and abroad, the Jews and Muslims of the Bronx 
have been propelled into an unlikely bond by a demographic shift. The borough was once home to an estimated 630,000 
Jews, but by 2002 that number had dropped to 45,100, according to a study by the Jewish Community Relations Council. 
At the same time, the Muslim population has been increasing. In Parkchester alone, there are currently five mosques, 
including Masjid Al-Iman. 
"Nowhere in the world would Jews and Muslims be meeting under the same roof," said Patricia Tomasulo, the 
Catholic Democratic precinct captain and Parkchester community organizer, who first introduced the leaders of the 
synagogue and mosque to each other. "It's so unique." 
The relationship started years ago, when the Young Israel Congregation, then located on Virginia Avenue in 
Parkchester, was running clothing drives for needy families, according to Leon Bleckman, now 78, who was at the time 
the treasurer of the congregation. One of the recipients was Sheikh Moussa Drammeh, the founder of the Al-Iman 
Mosque, who was collecting donations for his congregants—many of whom are immigrants from Africa. The 49-year-old 
imam is an immigrant from Gambia in West Africa who came to the United States in 1986. After a year in Harlem, he 
moved to Parkchester, where he eventually founded the Muslim center and later established an Islamic grade school. 
Through that initial meeting, a rapport developed between the two houses of worship, and the synagogue continued to 
donate to the Islamic center, among other organizations. 
But in 2003, after years of declining membership, Young Israel was forced to sell its building at 1375 Virginia 
Ave., according to a database maintained by Yeshiva University, which keeps historical records of synagogues. Before 
the closing, non-religious items were given away; in fact, among the beneficiaries was none other than Drammeh, who 
took some chairs and tables for his center. 
Meanwhile, Bleckman and the remaining members moved to a nearby storefront location, renting it for $2,000 a 
month including utilities. With mostly elderly congregants, Young Israel struggled to survive financially and, at the end of 
2007, was forced to close for good. The remaining congregants were left without a place to pray. During the synagogue's 
farewell service, four young men from the Chabad Lubavitch world headquarters in Crown Heights showed up. Three 
months earlier, Bleckman, then chairman of the synagogue's emergency fund, had appealed for help from the Chabad. 
"The boys from the Chabad said they came to save us," said Bleckman. "We were crying." 
At this point, Chabad took over the congregational reins from Young Israel, with members officially adopting the 
new name Chabad of East Bronx. Still, for the next six to seven weeks, Bleckman said they could not even hold a service 
because they had nowhere to hold it. 
When Drammeh learned of their plight, he immediately volunteered to accommodate them at the Muslim 
center at 2006 Westchester Ave.—for free. 
"They don't pay anything, because these are old folks whose income are very limited now," said Drammeh, 
adding that he felt it was his turn to help the people who had once helped him and his community. "Not every Muslim 
likes us, because not every Muslim believes that Muslims and Jews should be like this," Drammeh said, referring to the 
shared space. But "there's no reason why we should hate each other, why we cannot be families." Drammeh in 
particular admires the dedication of the Chabad rabbis, who walked 15 miles from Brooklyn every Saturday to run 
prayer services for the small Parkchester community. 
For the first six months, congregants held Friday night Sabbath services inside Drammeh's cramped office. As 
more people began joining the congregation, Drammeh offered them a bigger room where they could set up a 
makeshift shul. (When it's not in use, students from the Islamic school use it as their classroom.) Inside the synagogue, a
