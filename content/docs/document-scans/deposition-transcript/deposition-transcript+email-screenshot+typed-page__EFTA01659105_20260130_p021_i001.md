resources and services available to you." Reuters (11/23, Shalal) also reports that Murphy "said 
the decision allowing the start of a presidential transition to...Biden was `solely mine' despite" 
Trump's tweet. 
On ABC World News TonightVi (11/23, story 4, 1:10, Muir, 7.67M), Jonathan Karl called 
Murphy's announcement as "the first step towards a Biden Administration," as well as "the first 
acknowledgment...from anywhere in the Trump Administration of Biden's status as the 
President-elect." Reuters (11/23, Mason, Hunnicutt) similarly says Trump's tweet "was the 
closest he has come to admitting defeat," as does a front-page Washington Post (11/23, Al, 
Hamburger, Reinhard, Ruble, 14.2M) article, which says that while "procedural in nature," 
Trump's "acceptance" of the GSA's action "amounted to a dramatic capitulation and capped an 
extraordinary 16-day standoff since Biden was declared the winner on Nov. 7." 
On the CBS Evening NewsVi (11/23, story 2, 0:40, Brennan, 4.43M), Ben Tracy said that 
while the GSA is "officially agreeing that...Biden has won the election," the President "is not 
conceding" and "is still vowing to fight the election results." Similarly, USA Today (11/23, 
Shesgreen, 10.31M) reports Trump "refused to concede and continues to make baseless 
allegations of voter fraud." 
However, Administration officials told the Wall Street Journal (11/23, Al, Restuccia, 
Peterson, Ballhaus, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) that White House Chief of Staff Meadows, 
White House Counsel Pat Cipollone, and Jay Sekulow, the President's personal lawyer, told 
Trump on Monday that he does not need to formally concede but needed to begin the transition 
process. "Some senior White House officials" told Politico (11/23, Choi, Orr, McGraw, Cook, 
4.29M) that Trump's tweet "was inevitable amid the recent spate of certification deadlines for 
battleground states that...Biden won," but Weijia Jiang reported on CBS This MorningVI (11/23, 
2.62M) that "senior Administration officials tell CBS News that...Trump will concede if he 
exhausts all of his legal options and remains the loser." 
Breitbart (11/23, Spiering, 673K) reports Biden and Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) 
"celebrated the news, noting that the GSA administrator had `ascertained' that they were `the 
apparent winners of the election." The Washington Times (11/23, Boyer, Swoyer, Miller, 492K) 
reports a Biden campaign official "called it `a needed step to begin tackling the challenges 
facing our nation, including getting the pandemic under control and our economy back on 
track." The New York Times (11/23, Fandos, 18.61M) reports Biden had "tried to stay on the 
margins of the escalating fight" over ascertainment. 
The AP (11/23, Eggert, Miller, Long) says that although the "fast-moving series of events" 
on Monday "seemed to let much of the air out of Trump's frantic efforts to undermine the will of 
the people in what has amounted to a weekslong stress test for American democracy," Trump's 
bid "to foment a crisis of confidence in the political system and the fairness of U.S. elections 
haven't ended and are likely to persist well beyond his lame-duck presidency." 
Politico (11/23, Cheney, 4.29M) reports Biden's transition was unable to "start until 
Murphy ascertain[ed] his victory, according to federal law, a determination that has prevented 
the incoming administration from communicating with key national security and health officials 
despite the raging coronavirus pandemic." Bloomberg (11/23, Dlouhy, 4.73M) reports the 
designation "triggers a formal transition process, giving Biden and his team access to current 
agency officials, briefing books and other government resources, including some $6 million in 
funding." 
The Washington Post (11/23, Wagner, 14.2M) says the GSA's announcement comes "after 
weeks of pressure from Democrats to allow the process to go ahead." Earlier Monday, 
Bloomberg (11/23, Dlouhy, Flatley, 4.73M) reports Murphy "buck[ed] House Democrats' 
demands for an in-person briefing Monday to explain her blocking of transition resources 
for...Biden," although the GSA's offer for "a 30-minute briefing next week with a deputy 
administrator didn't satisfy committee leaders who warned that continued delays threaten 
national security and hamper the incoming Biden administration's pandemic response planning."
