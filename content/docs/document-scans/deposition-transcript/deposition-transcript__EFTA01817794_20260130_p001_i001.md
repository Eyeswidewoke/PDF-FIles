Re: Re: 
what you dont seem to understand is that if you are going to cook you have to wake up at 5 30.. 
not 615„ i told you about the door in the guest area this morning you ask so what should i do.. I 
have asked over and over again, when i tell you something needs to be done„ it is today... you 
did nothing and then couldn't figure out for yourself what to do , I DO NOT WANT TO be 
involved.. I asked you for the labels on the pots, twice, i wrote it down, i went over it with you, i 
then asked again if it was done you said yes you told jinky„ Had i done it myself it would have 
been done in less than five minutes, There is no fresh bread, who went shopping , what were they 
told„ you want respondibfiliyt ,„ the house runs like shit.. HAM and Etas., nothing last night 
for dinner„ No thought , just can i buy flowers. HOW crazy. Organize I at 4 or give me the 
number and stay out of it. so any trouble will be mine.. seperate from watching movies which is 
great, there is little difference from being in jail.

I ask you every morning if you want me to cook something. Your answer is oatmeal every 
day. You are right, there is no need for me to get up at 6 to boil water with oats but that's 
what you ask for. Not my idea. I could make anything you marked in that book..

if you were going to make somethig decent for breakfast doesn't it make sense to 
have it organized, cooked or at least shopped thought thorugh before i actually 
start breakfast.. this is so silly. I don't need you to spill the oatmeal in the pot that 
has boiled. HAM AND EGG LIFE IS NOT FOR ME>

time with you and a book of ideas. .. then tell me its too late if i want something

after 730.. You can ask me what you like between 6 and 7 30 . for the day unless 
something arises I DO NOT WANT TO BE DISTURBED. if you want to set 
an evening time fixed like visitiation you can ask me questions.. THere are too 
mnay things for me to do
