Re: 
this tyoe of childish game is boring and disappointing. Instead of an honest adult dialogue , do 
you think by not telling me -you are getting as you write " real answer " what does that mean? i 
am forced to deal with what you think i am doing, and why, and interpreting or misinterpreting 
my answers, What we had, and I cherished , was open and honest.. you now want to play , hide 
the ball. i am unwilling to play. = I am left with having to guess your motivations, your 
decisions, your moods, the outcome, THe ONLY I sent her home was because i didn't want you 
to say no, i an not coming now. I wanted you to come , so I had to guess at the safest answer and 
consequently , without full knowledge, hope for the result.. This has gone too far. I think we 
need a serious rest.

Jeffrey, I thought you misunderstood what I was saying and now it is clear you did. 
I don't see a reason to tell you why I am asking about other girls staying because I want the real 
answer and not bullshit. I don't ask knowing what I would do either way but I like to make an 
informed decision about extendin my trip or not. 
If you thought I wouldn't come 
was there and you wanted me to come, my reason sounds 
like an ultimatum and is uncomfortable for you. If you didn't want me to come, instead of just 
saying that, now you would have 
stay because It makes it look like you arc giving me 
a choice while really you just don't want me to come. Not because you couldn't say the truth ( 
you do! ) But because it is easier to make it sound like it's what I wanted... 
My flight is delayed till 9.25now.

according to you , you didn't want to tell me why you asked me a question in case " i didn't 
want you to come and used tthe fact that svelana was staying so you would not come. " 
avoids the real issue. If i did not want you to come, I would tell you so. you said i couldn't 
because you live in the house. I said that somehow , if you believe you can come if i didn't 
want you to is crazy, however you find that statement " disgusting". I asked you if you 
wanted to see for yourself that there is no romance with
,if so i would ask her to stay -
i asked you if you prefer her to leave. I asked you what you want to do , I asked you about 
who should come to the house , and I asked you to propose a solution. and then you say, 
nothing but i want to make my own decisions. You can and should make those decisions . 
Each one will have its own consequences„ some good some not so good . This is beyond silly. 
We are not getting along. I love you very much , but seem unable to communicate with you .. 
you feel i am now picking on you. you tell me you dont start fights but in the next breath say
