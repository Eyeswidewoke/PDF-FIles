In addition to the above assumptions, we also estimate a forfeiture rate to calculate stock-based compensation expense, which is based on an analysis of our 
historical forfeitures. We will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of the forfeiture rate based on our actual forfeiture experience, analysis of employee 
turnover and other factors. Changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant impact on our stock-based compensation expense as the 
cumulative effect of adjusting the forfeiture rate is recognized in the period in which the estimate is changed. If a revised forfeiture rate is higher than the 
previously estimated forfeiture rate, an adjustment is made resulting in a decrease to the stock-based compensation expense recognized in our combined 
financial statements. If a revised forfeiture rate is lower than the previously estimated forfeiture rate, an adjustment is made resulting in an increase to the 
stock-based compensation expense recognized in our combined financial statements. 
We wit continue to use judgment in evaluating the assumptions related to our stock-based awards on a prospective basis. As we continue to accumulate 
additional data related to our awards, we may have refinements to our estimates and forfeiture rates, which could materially impact our future stock-based 
compensation expense. 
Based on the Black-Scholes assumptions in the table above. the weighted average fair value of stock options granted during the years ended December 31. 
2013 and 2014 and for the nine months ended September 30. 2015. are $79.57. $63.24 and $102.26. respectively.

We are required to estimate the fair value of our common stock when performing fair value calculations with the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The fair 
values of our common stock were approved by the Compensation and Human Resources Committee of the ?AC Board of Directors, or the IAC Committee, 
after consultation with IAC management and based on valuations prepared by IAC management and valuations prepared by an unrelated third party valuation 
advisory firm. The IAC Committee intended all options granted to be exercisable at a price per share not less than the per share fair value of our common 
stock on the grant date. In the absence of a public trading market of our shares. the IAC Committee exercised its reasonable judgment and considered 
numerous objective and subjective factors to determine what it believed to be the best estimate of the fair value of our shares. These factors generally 
included the following: 
our actual operating and financial performance, 
current business conditions and our financial projections: 
the market performance of comparable publicly-traded companies, 
recent valuations performed at periodic intervals by an unrelated third-party valuation advisory firm: and 
the U.S. capital market conditions. 
Estimates and assumptions will no longer be necessary to determine the fair value of our common stock once it begins trading. 
IAC management performed valuations of our company as of January 2014, February 2014, October 2014, February 2015. June 2015 and September 2015 
The valuation advisory firm prepared valuations of our company as of January 1, 2014, February 1, 2015 and September 1. 2015. The dates of our valuation
