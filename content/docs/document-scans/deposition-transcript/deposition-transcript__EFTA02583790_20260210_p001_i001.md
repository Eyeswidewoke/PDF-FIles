I thought so too... a= the beginning I was doing well... But since I got back from Ukraine at th= end of March I 
literally got just a couple of bookings... 
And I don't have castings...that's the problem... and there a=e always some stupid excuses... or Oscar's 
parties...clien=s are busy...or Coachella - clients are busy... or something e=se... so I decided to leave this agency... 
And now I'm looking for some good agency with strong commercial bo=rd... 
Barry told me about NEXT - and I got so excited - I =hought it could be a good chance for me.. but if you are 
saying "no&q=ot; - there is not much I can do about NEXT then... 
And there is so many bad things happened to me since I got back from N=w Mexico... I broke up with my 
boyfriend - one evening I asked him t= break up...but he didn't want... I slapped him on a face while =e were fighting, 
cause he called me a slut (but I never cheated on him) - = tried to break up with him nicely... but he didn't want us to 
b=eak up... so next morning he called the police and said that I =ssaulted him!!! Can you imagine???... he said that he 
loves me to de=th and in 5 minutes cops knocked to our door!!! 
So I was dealing with police.. they really quickly found that he is in=ane psycho and they didn't let him sign the 
report, but they asked him=to leave my apartment - cause this is my apartment and I was paying for it=E2$4 
I almost end up without my car... and furniture... cause h= paid for it... 
And until now I'm still dealing with a lot o= threats and bullshit... 
I paid him 5000 dollars to leave =e alone... but he still didn't... 
So that's why I really disappointed with my agency... cause I don=#393 have time to wait for castings... I need to 
work NOW!!! 
<=iv>Cause I have to pay my bills... you know? 
And also Stev= had been so weird - right after I got back from New Mexico I texted him l=t's meet up for lunch 
and he text me this: 
"Would love toG 
I miss you=/div> 
I'm curious...I'm single and I'm not sure if you hav= a boy friend right now. 
If you don't... have you thou=ht about our friendship becoming anything more than that? 
I like you very much and feel comfortable asking you xx" 
Since then we still didn't see each other.=A6 and I don't think I gonna see him anymore.. I can't... se=iously I 
CAN'T do this!!! 
I won't forgive myself... he'll just suck my youth witho=t helping me... I know that... 
So I'm really kin= of on the edge Jeffrey... 
I don't know=what to do :(((
