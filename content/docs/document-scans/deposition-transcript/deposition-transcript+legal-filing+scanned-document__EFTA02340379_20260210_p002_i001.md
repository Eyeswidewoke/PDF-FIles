Valerio Mezzanotti for The New York Times 
Lesbian brides in the Chanel couture show. 
The philosopher Bernard-Henri Levy waxed poetic on stage, warning of the "black tide of homophobia." Lilian Thuram, 
the soccer hero who played on France's World Cup-winning 1998 team, said he was supportive "because my grandfather 
was discriminated against because he is black and my grandmother because she is a woman." Manuel Valls, the interior 
minister, opened his remarks with a letter of support from the president of Argentina, which he read in Catalonian-
accented Spanish, his mother tongue. 
Comedy and singing routines were performed, including one with a Lady Gaga impersonator as a lesbian bride in a long 
white wig and sunglasses. Texts by famous French intellectuals (Michel Foucault, Marguerite Duras) were read aloud. 
It was all part of the country's reaction to a proposed law that would allow gay couples to marry and adopt children, a 
measure that has prompted mass demonstrations and long discussions in the news media. On Tuesday, the National 
Assembly opened a debate on the proposed law that is expected to last more than two weeks. 
France is both a secular republic that champions the rights of the individual and a traditional, religiously rooted country 
that glorifies family life; demonstrating and debating are national pastimes. 
But even some supporters of the law are ambivalent about "marriage for all," as the initiative is called. 
Pierre Berge, the longtime personal and business partner of Yves Saint 
Laurent<http://topics.nytimes.comitopireference/timestopicsipeople/s/yves_saint_laurent/index.html?inline=nyt-
per>, was the financial sponsor for the Rond-Point event, but even he had reservations. 
Asked whether he and Mr. Saint Laurent would have married if same-sex marriage had been legal when the designer 
was alive, he seemed stunned into silence. Then he replied, "I don't know." 
"Personally, I don't like the word 'marriage'," he added. "I'd like it replaced in the civil code with the words 'civil union.' 
If people want a 'marriage,' they can have it — in a religious setting." 
Marriage, he said, had not been a burning personal issue for him. 
"I'm 82," he said. "And at my age, I'm not going to get married." 
(He and Mr. Saint Laurent had been joined in a civil solidarity pact, an initiative created in 1999 that offers couples 
regardless of sexual orientation some but not all of the rights of marriage.) At times, the debate has gotten personal. 
When Valerie Trierweiler, the partner of France's president, Francois 
Hollande<http://topics.nytimes.comitopireferenceitimestopics/people/h/francoishollande/index.html?inline=nyt-
per>, announced that if the law came into effect she would attend the wedding of two gay friends, Bernard Debre, a 
center-right deputy, wrote on his blog that she had no right to enter the debate. "She's just the mistress of the French 
president," he said. 
Undeterred, she turned up at Rond-Point to add her support. "This was one of the promises of Francois Hollande," she 
told reporters. "I defend his proposals."
