The bots did the sweep. Here are the new results taken as of a m=nute ago. You have only one negative 
article left on front page of google,=which is the Huffington Post article. The Huffington Post is extremely har= to move, 
because it is so powerful, has millions of links to it, and uplo=ds massive new and original content it on a daily basis with 
posting from =ut side readers. We managed to push it down the page, as it used to be at =he top. If we were able to post 
original content to both the science and t=e org site (absolutely not a single word to this day by Jessica, just talk=, we 
would have been able to push it down even further, and off the page. =E did manage to get rid of the daily beast article, 
which is now far re=oved, inspite of their own efforts to keep it prominent. 
<=r> 
Toxic suggested search engine terms that popped up automatica=ly when you typed in your name are 
also now removed. 
=OA 
Wikipedia was an important victory, as it will always be at the =op of the search engine results. ow the 
head lines do not mention convicte= sex offender or pedophile. Instead, Philanthrophic work, Epstein Foundati=n, 
Promotion of Scientists. We have stopped the hacking on your wiki site,=and that was a major effor. Your wiki entry now 
is pretty tame, and bad st=ff has been muted, bowlerized, and pused to the bottom. Careful editing an= wording has 
muted the effect immensely. We hacked the site to replace the=mug shot and caption, and now has an entirely different 
photo and caption.= This was a big success. 
We pushed the Edge all the way up to the front page, where it was previou=ly buried on page 5 of 
google search. 
We have =romoted the other jeffrey epsteins, and other pages are also filled with y=ur material. 
And, while the sites are up, and in =he direction we hoped, they are still new, and subject to volitility, 
espe=ially if new original content is not added on a minimum of a weekly basis.=l have been forbideen to add new 
content to the philanthrophic site as wel= as the science site, and therefore, as a result our rating slipped down (=till on 
the first page, but would have liked them (and some of the article= to been able to push Huffington off page). We also 
helped with you images= and the first images that come of you on a google search are not of your =ug shot, etc. 
Your daily beast foe is still=at it, and trying to promote her sites against you in the same way that we=try 
to depromote you. 
As far as this site is conc=rned, and the continuation of this, I do not know what you wish to do. =learly, 
you have no interest in my continuing. And, I am not sure if you w=nt to continue the project at all. If the latter, and you 
stop, eventually=it will just go into the way of entropy, and it will return to the old for=. The major work has been done, 
but it needs to be maintained. For it to g=t better results, it needs to have constant input and supervision, and tha= 
means generating proper content, not just editing and grammatical fixes. =riters need to know what to write. THe
