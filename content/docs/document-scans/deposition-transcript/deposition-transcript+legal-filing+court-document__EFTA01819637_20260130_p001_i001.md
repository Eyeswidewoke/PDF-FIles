"The Physics of the Universe" Summit 
Hosted at SpaceX. Caltech and the Andaz West Hollywood Hyatt. January 8.9.10 2010 
To accomplish the extraordinary. you must seek extraordinary people. — James Lee Byars 
In this two day retreat we hope to bring together the top minds (thinkers and doers) in the fields of the physics of the universe both theoretical and 
experimental. We want to ask and answer questions like "flow much can we understand about the universe, soon?' "What is the role of theory and of 
<allotment in getting there?' "Are them things we may not understand?' and "I low much of what we think we know might be wrong'.'". the meeting 
fosters discussion and we arc convinced that when the best people talk the outcome is advance and growth. We arc hoping we can avoid standard 
prepared talks. and focus on exciting fon:front issues, when: there may be diffen:nces of opinion, or new results that will provoke wide discussion. You 
will receive more intonation about the program and your own possible role in the near funny. The summit is inspired by the onset of the 
Large Hadron Collider, the Planck mission, the recent results by satellite and ground based experiments on dark matter searches, and the vast progress in 
theory. Also by meetings such as the IJIC Olympics. arid the workshops of the past years at the fvfCTP. K.1111 and Perimeter as well as interdisciplinary 
gatherings of the ASU Origins, the F.dge Master-Classes and Google's SciFoo.
