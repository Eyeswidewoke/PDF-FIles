Hi a 
ames Petrucci 
At Judge Berman's invitation, I went to the hearing in Epstein's case this morning. As you likely know, the 
government had asked the court to grant their request for a nolle pros. At the start of the hearing, Judge 
Berman said he was using the hearing as an opportunity for the victims to be heard. He then gave the 
government and defense counsel a chance to speak. 
As expected, defense counsel was dramatic and almost in tears during part of his presentation. He started his 
statement by stating the elephant in the room was: "What happened to our client!?" He repeated allegations 
from the media regarding conditions at MCC, officers sleeping, staff not cooperating with the investigation, 
etc "In a word, Yikes!!" He talked about how the government was supposed to keep Epstein safe and we 
(MCC) failed. He called conditions at MCC "horrific and medieval" with no sunlight, "rife with 
vermin," limited exercise, and water all over the floor. He fueled conspiracy theories, stating the timing of 
Epstein's suicide was "implausible" given they had just filed a motion to dismiss with a "good likelihood of 
success." He represented that in their meetings with Epstein, defense counsel did not see a suicidal 
person. He stated the "800 pound gorilla" in the room was the surveillance tape: "There is a tape directly 
outside Epstein's door that hasn't been produced!" He also disclosed that defense counsel had an 
independent doctor present during Epstein's autopsy (which I didn't know until today). That doctor opined 
that the broken bones found in Epstein's neck were more consistent with strangulation. The doctor also 
stated Epstein's injuries "were far more consistent with assault." Defense counsel claimed the medical 
examiner's findings were initially inconclusive, but then the examiner saw nine minutes of video footage from 
the stairway at MCC, which made her change her conclusion to suicide. (I have no idea if that claim is true.) 
Defense counsel said the medical examiner's conclusion and the stairway footage are suspect because the 
camera outside Epstein's cell was destroyed/corrupted and MCC has no explanation for that. He said it is 
convenient for the camera outside his cell to have been corrupted and it is ridiculous to think the camera 
would have been non-operational "for months" before the suicide. 
Most importantly, defense counsel stated they were "all for finding out the truth!" To that end, they asked 
Judge Berman to oversee the investigation into Epstein's death. They claimed the Court has inherent 
authority to find out what happened; this is an area of intense public interest and court supervision is 
important. Defense counsel argued that they need the Court to help them find out the truth. I haven't 
looked at the case yet, but counsel cited a case from Alaska written by Judge Sullivan (not SDNY J. Sullivan) 
concerning a Senator for the proposition the Judge Berman had oversight authority/jurisdiction. Defense 
counsel represented that in the Alaska case, the court appointed an independent lawyer to investigate a 
particular situation. (Again, I haven't looked at the case, but I'll find it and forward.) Defense counsel also 
asked Judge Berman to go to SHU at MCC and see the conditions for himself. (Defense counsel 
obviously didn't know that 
& I give tours to his clerks every summer, although we don't typically go 
to SHU.) 
Various attorneys for the victims spoke, too. One noted the "timing of Epstein's death is curious" and most 
of them seconded defense counsel's request for Court involvement in the investigation, although they 
admitted there was questionable authority for the Court to do so.
