Initially we invited Dr, Ali Tarhouni, currently the Minister of Finance & Oil in the TNC 
government and previously a Senior Lecturer in Business Economics at the University of 
Washington and a friend of Dr. Noah. As for his background, after breaking with the Qaddafi 
Regime, he was stripped of his citizenship, sentenced to death in absentia, and put on a 
government hit list in 1981. But he is unable to come because Mustafa Abdul Jalil, President 
of the Transitional National Council and Dr Mahmoud fibril, Acting Prime Minister and 
charged with forming the first Libyan government after Qaddafi are coming to New York 
next week for one day to meet with President Obama and Dr. Ali Tarhouni has been asked to 
stay behind in Libya to mine the store. 
As such, I suggest that you/we bring Fadel Hshad, Senior advisor to Mr. Abdul Jalil to head 
a delegation from the TNC that will include the following: 
1) Dr. Mohamed Yusuf al-Magariaf: (http://www.almagariaf.com) Washington DC - NY -
Atlanta (2 night stay in NY arriving this Monday or Tuesday at the latest.) Dr Magariaf will 
surely play a leading role in Libya either soon or in the medium term (6-12 months). He is 
considered the Nelson Mandela of Libya and has a good chance of becoming the first 
democratically elected President of Libya when the TNC relinquishes its power. Dr. Magariaf 
was #1 on Qaddafi's Hit List and the first senior within the Regime to break with Qaddafi in 
1981. Dr. Magariaf was the target of a bombing that killed 186 passengers on a UTA flight in 
1989 including the wife of the US Ambassador to Chad. 
2) Dr. Fadi Noah: Portland (pdx) - NY - Portland/return arriving Monday evening for 2-3 
nights. Educated at UC Berkeley with a PhD in Nuclear Engineering. He was Undersecretary of 
Energy in Libya and headed it nuclear program before breaking with the Qaddafi Regime in 1983. 
Dr. Noah became #2 on Qaddafi's Hit List. 
3) Dr. Intisar Azzuz: Portland (pdx) - NY - Portland/return arriving Monday evening for 2-3 
nights. Dr Azzuz is a close advisor to Dr. Magariaf and a future leader of women's issues in 
Libya in a major capacity being a highly educated and highly respected Libyan woman. 
4) Fadel Hshad: (Tripoli via Tunis - NY - Tripoli via Tunis/return) arriving NY Monday or 
Tuesday for 3 nights. Fadel has been officially appointed special advisor to Mr. Abdul Jalil
