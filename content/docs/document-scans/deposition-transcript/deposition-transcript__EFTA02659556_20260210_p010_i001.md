***** 
It's a rainy day. Lange meets a hooker on the street and they go into an alley. 
She takes it out, takes a look and says, "It's too big." 
He says, "That's no rea=on to drop it in the mud." 
r*rr*ts
What would you call a bunch of Polish guys wearing turbans? 
A Pakistanleys. 
It's 1946, Durkin's got a seaside bar & grill on the boardwalk on Coney Island, and business is terrible. It's 
midnight, the joint's empty,=and just as he decides he's going to lock the door for the last time, a cla= walks in. 
The clam says, "Too late to get a gin and tonic?" 
Durkin says, "Nah, what the hell," goes behind the bar, and serves the clam a drink. 
The clam tells him about his hard life, sprinkled with a few really funny stories, and then says, "Mind if I play 
the piano?" 
Durkin says, "Nah, what the hell, go ahead." 
The clam sits at the piano and starts pounding away and singing his heart out. A few people walking by see 
him, come in, and start drinking. Pretty soon the place is full, the clam never stops, and everybody stays until closing 
time. 
After everybody's gone, Durkin says to the clam, "You ain't bad. What's your name?&quo.; 
The clam says, "I'm Joe= Want me to come back tomorrow night?" 
Durkin says, "Yeah. I want you here every night." 
Durkin puts a sign in the window, "Tonight, on the piano, Joe The Clam," and for the next f=w months the 
place is packed to the hilt six nights a week. Durkin's swimming in cash, there's women everywhere, and Joe's become a 
loca= celebrity. 
One Monday, it's the afternoon of their day off, and Joe drags himself into the bar with his shell all busted 
up, hanging off him in pieces. He's in really bad shape. 
Durkin says, "What happened?" 
Joe says, "I was under the pier with this hot starfish and her lobster boyfriend caught us. Beat me up pretty 
bad." 
Durkin takes him up to his apartment over the bar and tucks him into bed. 
He says, "Just rest, Joe. You're going to be fine. Now, listen ... I got a date tonight with that blonde who's 
been coming in lately, so if we come in and I manage to ge= her into the bed, don't say anything. Try to stay out of the 
way."=br> 
Durkin takes the blonde to dinner, they get drunk, he brings her up to the apartment, they get 
undressed, they climb into bed and they really go to town. 
The next morning, Durkin's eyes open, he remembers the night before, and he smiles. 
He looks over at the blonde and says, "Did you have a good time last night?" 
She says, "Oh, it was wonderful." 
She says, "What was that?&q=ot; 
He says, "I said, did you like what I did to you down there with my tongue?" 
She says, "You didn't d= anything to me down there with your tongue." 
Durkin says, "Oh my God ...=I ate my best friend."
