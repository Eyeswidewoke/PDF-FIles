Detroit Officials Credit Partnerships, Precision Policing for Drop In Violent Crime 
Spectrum News (10/07, Tolen) reported that Detroit officials report a significant drop in violent crime, with 
homicides down 15%, non-fatal shootings down 22%, and carjackings down 29% from 2024. According to the 
article, since 2022, there's been a 41% drop in homicides and a 50% drop in non-fatal shootings, according to Police 
Chief Todd Bettison. The article noted that city leaders, including Mayor Mike Duggan and Police Chief Todd 
Bettison, credit partnerships and policing strategies, such as embedding federal agents from the ATF, FBI, DEA, and 
Homeland Security in police precincts and community violence intervention efforts, for the trend. 
Senator Grassley Drops FBI Docs on Political Conduct During 2022 Arrest of Peter Navarro 
Just the News (10/07, Whedon) reported that Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley revealed that 
whistleblowers provided him with documents related to the FBI's handling of Peter Navarro's arrest. According to 
the article, the documents show that the FBI conducted physical surveillance on Navarro before arresting him in 
public at Reagan Airport, rather than at his home near FBI headquarters. "The first document is a request for 
physical surveillance on Navarro the day the FBI arrested him," Sen. Grassley said. "The second document is 
the timeline of that surveillance... the FBI didn't arrest him at his house, which was literally right next to the FBI 
headquarters." "Instead, they surveilled him and his fiancée all morning, starting at his home, following them to 
the airport, and then arrested him in public at the Reagan Airport," he went on. "The way Navarro was treated is 
unnecessary... So to our average constituent, this is all history, but it's all pointing out the wrong of government 
using the power of government to go after people they're political people you don't like." The article noted that 
Sen. Grassley criticized the FBI's actions as "unnecessary" and demanded that Attorney General Pam Bondi provide 
more information on the matter. 
FBI Corruption Probe Picked up Evidence Former President Bill Clinton Paid Through Backdoor 
Just the News (10/07, Richards) reported that a 2017 FBI document released by Sen. Chuck Grassley reveals that 
investigators obtained evidence suggesting former President Bill Clinton may have received payments through a 
covert arrangement involving an allied consulting firm, Teneo, during a federal investigation into political 
corruption. The case update, written by then—Supervisory Special Agent Tim Thibault as part of the Washington 
Field Office's investigation into Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe, details an interview with Steven Sullivan, Teneo's 
Chief Financial Officer, who reportedly indicated that the firm had been used as a "pass-through" by Clinton 
associate Doug Band to compensate the former president. According to the article, Band, a longtime Clinton aide 
and co-founder of the Clinton Global Initiative, led Teneo, a company with deep ties to both Bill and Hillary Clinton. 
The McAuliffe investigation focused on his business dealings before taking office and potential violations of the 
Foreign Agents Registration Act. The article noted that during a Senate hearing, Grassley questioned Attorney 
General Pam Bondi on whether the FBI and Justice Department fully pursued the matter, contrasting the probe's 
scope with investigations into former President Donald Trump and his allies. The document's release comes amid 
broader Republican scrutiny of alleged political bias within federal law enforcement, coinciding with recent 
disclosures by CIA Director John Ratcliffe concerning Obama-era intelligence handling and Biden administration 
officials' involvement in limiting intelligence distribution. 
Opinion: Director Patel's 'Transparency' Claim Slapped With Epstein Reminders 
An opinion piece from The Daily Beast (10/07, Vaillancourt) reported that Director Patel faced online backlash after 
posting on X that "the transparency I promised is being delivered by this FBI," as users quickly countered with 
reminders of the Trump administration's refusal to release additional Jeffrey Epstein files. According to the article, X 
users attached links highlighting Patel's misleading statements about supposed court-ordered restrictions, his 
evasive testimony before the House Judiciary Committee, where he recited the alphabet instead of answering 
questions, and PBS coverage summarizing his resistance to discussing Epstein. The article noted that AG Bondi has 
also refused to answer questions about Epstein despite earlier claiming the files were on her desk, while President 
Trump has offered only vague and conflicting remarks about releasing them. Director Patel's post, viewed over 3 
million times, was met with memes and criticism comparing his handling of the Epstein issue to his management of 
the Charlie Kirk assassination case. The author assessed that Director Patel's vague claim of "transparency" 
backfired, reinforcing skepticism that the FBI and Trump administration are concealing politically sensitive 
information rather than promoting genuine accountability.
