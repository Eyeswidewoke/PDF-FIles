Subject: 
My view of the situation 
The three children believe that all Noam's money,=not only from the marital Trust, but also from the IRAs belongs to 
them, b=cause it was made when Noam was married to their mother. 
</=iv> 
But not only from the time their marriage lasted, b=cause after Noam and his second wife had been married, Harry once 
flew fro= California to complain that royalties even of a new book that Noam wrote =fter being married to his second 
wife should NOT come to the second wife).=C2 And the book publication was delayed and all sorts of legal difficul=ies 
and pressure from Max to have the book only under Noam's name -- w=th Deborah's endorsement, until Gene Landy 
stood up in the case. 
=div> 
Therefore, in their minds, all the money should be inhe=ited by them. 
In the will that Max pr=posed, the second wife would receive $25,000, and even the remaining money=from bank 
accounts should go to the Noam Chomsky Revocable Trust. At=the time the bank account was being used only as an 
account for making pay=ents. So it had only the exact amount for payments. 
At the time, before Noam and his second wife sold the apartment in Cambr=dge (that was bought after Noam and his 
second wife had been married -- bt= that it was not allowed by Max to be bought jointly in Noam's and his=second 
wife's name) and all the tangible assets including, sheets, pil=owcases, glasses, silverware, books, objects, rugs, furniture 
and all its =ontent, as Max wrote, would also go to the NCRT. Therefore, includin= things that Noam and his second wife 
had acquired together. 
The document stated that then all tangible assets would be sold=and the money would be reverted to the NC Revocable 
Trust, that would have=become at that point irrevocable. The NC Revocable Trust has the three chi=dren as its 
beneficiaries. 
Harry was nominated tr=stee of the marital trust. He now controls the other trustee, Max.</=iv> 
The IRA has been the main source of income and Noam=n39;s children want it to be the only source of income, 
preserving the mar=tal trust intact for themselves. 
After Noam=realized that the gifts to his children and payments of their expenses fro= the IRA, plus our own expenses 
were depleting the IRA in taxes that are b=ing paid also from the IRA, he stopped the gifts to 10 family members. =A0 
The idea is that Noam uses only the IRA fo= all expenses and taxes, since Noam designated one of the IRAs as the 
inhe=itance to his second wife. Interestingly they want to make sure that=there are no current gifts to the second wife. 
Maybe because they wa=t to be able to contest the will, saying that they -- Noam's children =- were excluded from 
Noam's inheritance. The only reason I can s=e why they would care if there are gifts being made to the second wife is 
=hat this would diminish their portion in the inheritance that they can cla=m from the IRA. Otherwise, what difference
