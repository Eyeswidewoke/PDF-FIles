2017 Nation-State & its Discontents 
Faculty: Zadorian. Amanda 
MW 10:00 AM - 11:40 AM 
Credits: 4 am 7283 Sec A 
Did nations make states? Will markets unmake them? This course provides an introduction to the 
subfield of comparative politics by examining the focal point of contemporary political power the 
state. Beginning with the origin of the modern nation-state in Europe. we will trace its postcolonial 
development through the twentieth century and consider its frequently remarked decline in the 
present. How did this new form of political organization arise. and how did it interact with emerging 
nationalism? How has it been reshaped by the spread of liberal democracy? How do its operations 
vary in diverse cultural contexts? How can it effectively respond to pressure from popular 
movements, international institutions and the globahzed economy? While investigating these 
questions, we will also discuss the methods and approaches that shape our knowledge of political 
institutions and processes.

This course offers an introduction to canonical texts. central concepts• and the main themes and 
debates that have shaped modern European political thought from the beginning of the sixteenth 
to the closing of the nineteenth century. What is modern political theory? What makes it modern 
and to what attributes does it own its modernity? Certainly there is, on the one hand. the rise of a 
new form of political association. the modern state as the primary subject of politics• law. and 
violence and. on the other, a gradual diva-variation of the public sphere from church and religion. 
But what principles and values, aspirations and ends. came to animate the modern political 
vocabulary. thus distinguishing it from a before and an after? And how did the Enlightenment 
affect political discourse and debate? The course focuses on this conceptual and theoretical 
innovation in modern political discourse. We will discuss the rise of sovereignty as the master 
category of modem political thought and engage with the deployment of social contract arguments 
to explain, subvert, and re-found political power, social obligation. and individual consent. We will. 
of course, consider theories of disobedience, resistance, and revolution and the modern 
reinvention of democracy. Hence, of central importance are questions related to popular 
sovereignty and representation, the split between government and society. the dynamics of 
participation and inclusion, the tension between individual rights and political liberty, the 
private/public distinction, and the intertwinement of law and power in the making of constitutional 
democracy. Finally, we will examine the transition from nature to history and the struggle between 
the universal and the particular as reflected in the five intellectual and political protagonists of this 
period: republicanism, absolutism, conservatism, liberalism, and socialism.

3008 Rights of the Accused 
Faculty: 'breaths, Lisa 
MW 01:50 PM 03:30 PM 
Credits: 4 
CRN 6983 Sec A 
This course provides an understanding of the constitutional and statutory rules that govern the 
United States criminal justice system. The US constitutional system attempts to balance many 
complicated and often conflicting concerns. The Constitution has several amendments specifically 
designed to protect the constitutional rights of the criminally accused. Prosecutors, as 
representatives of the government are present to enforce the laws and to protect the general 
citizenry. At the same time, they pledge to protect and uphold the Constitution. This raises a 
fundamental question: how does a government defend and protect its citizens from illegal activity 
and uphold its constitutional principles protecting the accused? This course examines the rights 
of the accused provided in the Constitution and how those dons have been treated by the 
government and interpreted by the United States Supreme Court. The political nature of courts 
creates a fluid and changing definition of these rights. We will examine the historical development 
of the rights of the accused. relying upon Supreme Court decisions. The goal of the course is to 
provide students with a solid understanding of the constitutional rights of the accused and the US 
criminal justice system.

3016 Borders and Walls 
Faculty: Pisan, Jessica

11:55AM 01:35 PM 
Credits: 4 
CRN 5870 Sec A 
What are borders• and why do states police them? What are the politics that generate beliefs that 
we need borders? How are barriers between states constructed. and who are the actors that 
participate in their construction? And how. where. and why do people negotiate state boundaries? 
In this course. we analyze not only physical borders, but also bureaucratic barriers to movement 
and walls in virtual space. A lot of research about politics focuses on what happens within 
individual states or an international state system. But borderlands-physical or virtual-often have 
their own politics distinct from those of the states on whose peripheries they exist. In the course 
we emphasize research that seeks to understand politics in contexts that transcend the 
boundaries of states. Through a variety of case studies drawn from different continents, we 
consider the local political economies borders generate, and the ways people find to move around 
and across them. We also examine questions such as: how do walls made by authoritarian 
regimes differ from walls built by countries considered to be democracies? Finally, we consider 
how the study of borders and walls can change how we think about politics within states.
