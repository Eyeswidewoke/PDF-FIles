5:30pm, but they advised leaving as soon after that time as 
possible. 
I have told them we will do our best. 
We will be back to the dock around 7:30pm. 
We will have some food and beverages on the boat. 
The boat can accommodate up to 40 people. 
There are about 26 of us. 
With all spouses, we would be 51 so I think there is a 
chance to work it all out...l just need to know from TOUR can 
come ASAP. 
Please let me know.... 
I have attached directions and a photo of the 
schooner.
