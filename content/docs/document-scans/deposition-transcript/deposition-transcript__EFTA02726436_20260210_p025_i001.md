with her, she would give me drugs. 
2 
Q. Did you ever see her on any occasions other 
3 
than when you were going with her to Jeffrey's? 
4 
A. After a couple of months, we hung out and 
5 
that's when I got Jeffrey's number. And I didn't, I did 
6 
not no longer need her to take me to Jeffrey's. So we 
7 
hung out a couple of times. We would talk about Jeffrey 
8 
and how much money we were making from Jeffrey and 
9 
that's that 
10 
Q. What do you mean you no longer needed her to 
11 
get to Jeffrey's? 
12 
A. I bad Jeffrey's phone number so I could call 
13 
him so he could send a taxi over, or he could send 
14 
somebody from his house to come pick me up to go to 
15 
Jeffrey's. I didn't need her or one of her friends to 
16 
drive me to Jeff, to Jeffrey's anymore. And now I was 
17 
one of Jeffreys girls to fad more girls, so -- 
18 iiAnd 
this, this occurred when, that is that 
19 
never — stopped taking you there and you began 
20 
to go over these on your own? 
21 
A. Within a month. 
22 
Q. Now, you said that, that, something about 
23 
taking a cab. Who — weren't you the person that called 
24 
the cab? 
25 
A. I have called cabs, yes.

10 
Q. -- to be sent out to you to get you? 
11. 
A. Yes. 
3.2 
Q. How do you 'mow that? 
13 
A. Because he told me. 
14 
Q. Is that the only basis that you have --
15 
A. Yes. 
16 
Q. — for making that statement? You never heard 
17 
him get on the phone with a cab; is that right? 
18 
A. No, we never made a three-way call to the cab 
19 
station. 
20 
Q. Do you know whether or not on times when you 
21 
claim that he told you he was going to have a cab 
22 
whether he called for the cab or someone else called for 
23 
the cab? 
24 
MR. EDWARDS: Object to the form.

THE WITNESS: Excuse me?

Q. And then you rode a cab from wherever you were 
2 
to Jeffrey's house? 
3 
A. Yes. 
4 
Q. Did anyone else calla cab for you to take a 
5 
ride from wherever you were to Jeff's house other than 
6 
you? 
7 
A. Yes. 
Q. Who? 
A. Ether my, one of the girls that I brought or 
Jeffrey would call a cab or one of Jeffreys assistants. 
Q. How do you know that — when you say Jeffrey 
called a cab, can you tell me any incident where you 
know that Jeffrey called a cab on your behalf? 
A. I would call him and I would say how do i get 
there, Jeffrey. He would say don't worry, I will have a 
cab come to your house. I will call a cab. 
Q. So, you don't know whether he called a cab or 
not? 
MR. EDWARDS: Object to the form. 
THE WITNESS: Fm, fm not, you know, fm not 
a psychic. I didn't go to his house in my mind and 
see if he physically picked the phone up. He 
probably told one of his maids or something to do 
it. Maybe he called a cab.

cab? 
20 
A. Definitely over 20 times. 
21 
Q. And you said that on some occasions, to use 
22 
your words, one of the girls would call. What girls are
