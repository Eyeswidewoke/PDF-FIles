Finance Charges: Average Daily Balance Method for Calculation of Finance Charges (FC):We use the Average 
Daily Balance method to calculate FC on your Account. Under this method, we figure the FC on your Account by wooing 
the daily periodic rate to the Average Daily Balance (as described below) for each feature Isuch as Purchase,iCash 
Advance and Balance Transfer features) of your Account (including current transactions). To get the Average Daily 
Balance for each feature, we (1) take the beginning balance for the feature each day (including unpaid FC from previous 
billing pericds), (2) add any new transactions, &Oils, or lees, (3) subtract any payments or credits, and (4) make any 
appropriate aderstments. For each day after the first day of the billing period, we also add en amount of 
keenest equal to the previous day's daily balance multiplied by the dally periodic rate for the feature. 
This gives us tho daily balance for the feature for that day and the beginning
 for the feature for the next day. If this 
balance is negative, it is considered to be zero. Then, we add pp all the 
balances for the feature for the billing period 
and divide the total loy the number of days in the billing period. This gives us he Average Daily Balance for the feature. Per 
all features except Cash Advances and certain promotions, the Average Daily Balance will be considered to be zero if you 
paid the New Balance, if any, shown on your previous month's statement by the Payment Due Date shown on that 
statement. If you multiply the Average Daily Balance for each feature by the number of days In the Wing period and the 
daily periodic rate for that feature, the result will be the FC assessed on that feature, except for variations caused by 
rounding. The total FC for the billing period is calculated by adding the FC assessed on al features of the Account. This 
method-of calculating the Average Daily Balance and FC results in daily compounding of FC. The minimum 
FC for any billing periodinwhich FC are imposed is $0.50.
