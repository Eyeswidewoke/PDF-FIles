Currency. If the Calculation Agent, in its sole discretion, determines that any of these events has occurred or is occurring on die Final Valuation Date, the 
Calculation Agent may determine the Final Spot Rate in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner on such date. or. in the disaction of the 
Calculation Agent. may determine to postpone the Final Valuation Date and Maturity Date for up to five scheduled trading days. each of which may 
adversely affect the return on your Notes. If the Final Valuation Date has been postponed 'Or lice consecutive scheduled trading days and a market 
disruption event continues on the fifth scheduled trading day. then that fifth scheduled trading day will nevertheless be the Final Valuation Date and the 
Calculation Agent will determine the Spot Rate of the Reference Currency using the formula for and method of determining such Spot Rate which applied 
just prior to the market disruption event (or in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner) on such date.
