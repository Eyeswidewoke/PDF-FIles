violence. "I'm proud of the years of hard work that went into this case by investigators at the federal and local level 
to target the upper echelon of this extremely violent gang," said Akil Davis, the Assistant Director in Charge of the 
FBI's Los Angeles Field Office. "Today's actions will cause a significant setback to Racho San Pedro and their 
Mexican Mafia overlords, and lead to safer streets for San Pedro residents." The article noted that eight of the 
individuals are facing federal charges, including RICO and conspiracy to possess controlled substances, while five 
others are facing state charges, with most federal defendants potentially facing a maximum sentence of life in 
prison if convicted. Fox News (10/07, Baehr) highlighted that Director Patel told the outlet that the bust marks a 
turning point in the fight against cartel-linked gangs. "The era of cartels operating freely in America is over," 
Director Patel said. "Every day, the FBI and our partners are dismantling violent networks at the source, stripping 
their resources, taking criminals off the streets and saving American lives." Additional reporting provided by

AG Bondi Speaks at Contentious Senate Hearing 
The New York Post (10/07, Nelson) reported that Attorney General Bondi clashed heatedly with Senate Democrats 
during a Judiciary Committee hearing on Tuesday, defending her July 6 decision not to release further Jeffrey 
Epstein files while turning her criticism on several lawmakers, including Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse and Dick Durbin. 
AG Bondi accused Whitehouse of making "salacious remarks" about President Trump and questioned whether he 
was "concerned" about his own ties to Reid Hoffman, whom she described as "one of Epstein's closest confidants," 
while also blasting Durbin for allegedly blocking the disclosure of Epstein's flight logs in 2023. According to the 
article, AG Bondi's exchanges grew increasingly combative as she sparred with Sen. Alex Padilla over troop 
deployments to U.S. cities, rebuked him for "storming" a Homeland Security event, and told him, "I wish you loved 
your state of California as much as you hate President Trump." The article also described AG Bondi's sharp retorts 
to Sen. Richard Blumenthal, whom she accused of lying about his military service, and to Sen. Adam Schiff, whom 
she called a "failed lawyer" and demanded apologize for "slandering" the president during the Russia probe. The 
article noted that AG Bondi repeatedly defended Director Patel when Democrats raised questions about his 
involvement in Epstein-related investigations, while using the hearing to accuse Democrats of political hypocrisy 
and to assert that "transparency and accountability" under the Trump administration were being unfairly maligned. 
The Daily Beast (10/07, Tomazin) added that AG Bondi refused to answer questions during a Senate hearing about 
a $60,000 FBI sting operation involving Trump's border czar, Tom Homan, instead deflecting responsibility to 
Director Patel and telling lawmakers to "discuss this with Director Patel." According to the article, the sting allegedly 
showed Homan accepting cash from undercover FBI agents posing as businesspeople, but AG Bondi insisted that 
five FBI agents and five DOJ prosecutors had reviewed the case and "found no evidence of wrongdoing." Additional

Director Patel, FBI 'Flex Resources' for Windy City Crime Crackdown as Part of Trump Administration's 
'Focused Effort' 
Fox News (10/07, Derespina) reported that Director Patel defended the bureau's involvement in President Trump's 
Chicago crime and immigration enforcement initiative, emphasizing that agents were "just doing their job to 
safeguard the streets" amid ongoing resistance from state and local officials. Director Patel, joined by Deputy 
Attorney General Todd Blanche, toured the FBI's Chicago field office and explained that the bureau was "flexing 
resources" to assist the Department of Homeland Security in addressing violent crime and the removal of 
undocumented immigrants allegedly linked to criminal activity. According to the article, Director Patel described 
the operation as a "whole-of-government approach" that included not only immigration enforcement but also 
efforts to combat narcotics trafficking and threats against public officials and agents. Director Patel praised 
Chicago's police officers as "great partners" while sharply criticizing city and state leaders for prioritizing "illegal 
immigrants and crime over those that they serve." The article noted that Director Patel's comments came as the 
Trump administration's decision to deploy National Guard troops in Chicago faced legal challenges, with Blanche 
calling state opposition to the move "laughable" and asserting that the Guard was essential to restoring safety in 
the city. Director Patel also posted a statement on X: "Chicago will be saved, and this FBI will continue to crush 
violent crime there, and all around the country. Heading to the Windy City now." Patch (10/07, DeGrechie) also 
reported on the story.
