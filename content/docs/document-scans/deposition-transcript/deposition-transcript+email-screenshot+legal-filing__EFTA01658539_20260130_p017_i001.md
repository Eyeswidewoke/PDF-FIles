USA Today Analysis: Barrett Ceremony Was Snapshot Of Trump's "Crumbling 
Support Among Swing Christian Voters." In a 2,300-word analysis, USA Today (10/19, 
Fraser, 10.31M) says that while President Trump's Rose Garden ceremony announcing his 
nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett "was supposed to be a triumphant moment for a 
longstanding alliance between Republican presidents and conservative Christians," the event 
instead "was a snapshot of his crumbling support among swing Christian voters." According to 
USA Today, "Numerous polls, including figures released Monday, show that as people's 
confidence in Trump's pandemic response declined so did the percentage who said they would 
vote for his re-election." 
Senate Republicans Propose Constitutional Amendment To Stop Court 
Expansion. The Washington Times (10/19, Dinan, 492K) reports Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) is 
leading "a group of Senate Republicans" who announced on Monday they are introducing a 
constitution amendment "to fix the Supreme Court at a maximum of nine members, playing 
defense as Democrats ramp up talk of expanding the court to try to swamp President Trump's 
picks." The lawmakers "also proposed changing Senate rules to require a supermajority to vote 
in favor of increasing the number of justices." 
Trump Calls Fauci "A Disaster" And Health Experts "Idiots." 
All three broadcast networks opened their Monday evening newscasts with coverage of 
President Trump's reference to NIAID Director Fauci as "a disaster" and Trump's coronavirus 
advisers as "these idiots" in a conference call with campaign staff. Later, the President tweeted,
"Dr. Tony Fauci says we don't allow him to do television, and yet I saw him last night on 
@60Minutes, and he seems to get more airtime than anybody since the late, great, Bob Hope. 
All I ask of Tony is that he make better decisions. He said 'no masks & let China in'. Also, Bad 
arm! P.S. Tony should stop wearing the Washington Nationals' Mask for two reasons. Number 
one, it is not up to the high standards that he should be exposing. Number two, it keeps 
reminding me that Tony threw out perhaps the worst first pitch in the history of Baseball!" The 
President also retweeted videos of Fauci throwing out a first  pitch and Trump himself doing so. 
On ABC World News TonightVi (10/19, lead story, 4:00, Muir, 7.31M), Jonathan Karl said, 
"President Trump unleashed a bizarre new line of attack against Joe Biden today, slamming him 
for saying he would listen to Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's leading expert on coronavirus." 
Trump: "He wants to listen to Dr. Fauci. He wants to listen to Dr. Fauci." Karl: "Polls have 
consistently shown Dr. Fauci is far more trusted than the President, or anybody else for that 
matter, when it comes to handling COVID-19, which is why Trump put him in a campaign ad, 
over Fauci's objections. But today, the President unloaded in a conference call with his 
campaign staff." Trump: "People are tired of hearing Fauci and all these idiots, these, these 
people. These people that have gotten it wrong. He's a nice guy. He's been here for 500 years. 
He called every one of them wrong. Yet, we keep him. Every time he goes on television, there's 
always a bomb. But there's a bigger bomb if you fire him. But Fauci's a disaster." 
On the CBS Evening NewsVi (10/19, lead story, 3:40, 4.4M), Norah O'Donnell said Trump 
is "on the attack, not against his opponent but the top infectious disease expert. In a series of 
insults made to reporters on Twitter and in front of voters, the President said that Dr. Anthony 
Fauci is, quote, 'a disaster,' and called Fauci and other experts 'idiots.' ... [Trump] appears intent 
on minimizing the coronavirus pandemic, telling campaign staffers that Americans are tired of 
hearing about the virus and just want it to be left alone." CBS' Ben Tracy: "President Trump is 
behind in the polls and two weeks from the election, his campaign is being criticized for not 
having any sort of consistent message. Now the President is launching these new attacks on Dr. 
Fauci and all but dismissing coronavirus. ... Asked today why he doesn't just fire Fauci, 
President Trump took another swipe at the 79-year-old who has served six presidents." Trump: 
"I don't want to hurt him. He's been there for about 350 years." 
Lester Holt said on NBC Nightly NewsVi (10/19, lead story, 1:20, 5.9M) that with "15 days 
to go, you might expect candidates to be hammering their closing arguments. President Trump
