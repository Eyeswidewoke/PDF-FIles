supporting a government that includes an entity found on the list of terrorist organizations, as is Hizbullah. So far, 
though, lawmakers who have been vocal in calling for aid to the new Palestinian government in-formation to be stopped 
because Hamas is on the terrorist list have been silent regarding Lebanon and Hizbullah. On Friday, Hizbullah chief 
Sheikh Na'srallah admitted in a televised speech that his group was infiltrated by CIA agents. He claimed the CIA became 
involved when Israel itself was unable to penetrate Hizbullah. There is no confirmation from the U.S. or Israel that any of 
those arrested had any links to the respective governments. 
Syrian Troops Kill 20 Civilians on Friday; Demonstrators Reject Al-Asad's Insufficient Promises 
Protestors remained on Syria's streets over the weekend despite the continue killing of demonstrators by President 
Bashar Al-Asad's forces. On Friday, at least 20 were shot dead as they demanded Al-Asad's overthrow, including a 12-
year old and 13-year old. Government sources blamed the deaths on the anonymous "armed men" that Al-Arad insists 
are behind the unrest. The state-run news agency reported that thousands of Syrians were demonstrating in support of 
the Al-Asad regime, but because foreign journalists have been banned from the country, independent verification is not 
possible. Over the weekend hundreds more Syrians — some with gunshot wounds — crossed the border into Lebanon 
according the Beirut-based Daily Star. In Yemen on Friday, violence appeared to follow the Syrian playbook when 
government troops backed by tanks fired point-blank into a funeral procession for a man beaten to death by police. At 
least 14 people were reported killed in the incident in the southern port town of Aden. The man who was being buried 
was killed a year ago, but his family refused to bury him until an investigation into his death was complete. Three 
policemen who were found guilty in the torture and killing of the man await sentencing. 
Abbas: We'll Move Ahead with Unity Government Despite Disagreements 
Palestinian Authority head Mahmoud 'Abbas said on Friday that despite the continued inability to resolve a number of 
outstanding issues between Fatah and llamas, the Palestinians will nevertheless push forward with plans to form a unity 
government that will remain in place until elections are held one year later. Speaking from Ankara where 'Abbas was 
meeting with Turkish Prime Minster Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the PA leader said "there is no turning back." Ending the 
bifurcation between Fatah in control of the West Bank and llamas in control of the Gaza Strip is seen by Palestinians as 
the major goal in preparation for statehood. A reconciliation agreement was announced in May, but the pact failed to 
include resolution of any of the outstanding issues, such as control of the rival security forces. The cancellation of a 
meeting set for last week between 'Abbas and Hamas leader-in-exile Khalid Mashal gave rise to new doubts that the 
rapprochement will hold. The primary obstacle at the moment is Hamas' refusal to accept the continuation of Salam 
Fayyad as prime minister.
