Benefits are not payable if the loss for which coverage is sought was directly or indirectly, wholly or partially, contributed to or caused by the 
following: 
(1) infirmity, disease or sickness of the Ticketholder, other than as defined by Medical Emergency; (2) Delay; (3) fraud or illegal activity of any 
kind by the Ticketholder; (4) confiscation by any governmental authority; (5) active participation in a civil public disturbance or protest; (6)

Claims 
If a Ticketholder experiences a loss for which You believe a benefit is payable under this Plan, You must provide both Notice of Claim and 
Proof of Loss. 
Notice of Claim 
Notice of claim should be provided to Us within 30 days of the toss. You may contact us by phone by calling toll-free stateside 1.800.620.4991 
or, if from overseas, by calling collect 1-303-273-6498. You may also write to us at Event Ticket Protection Plan, P.O. Box 402, Golden CO 
80402. 
Failure to provide notice of claim within 30 days will not invalidate a claim or reduce any benefit payment that may be found to be eligible, if it 
can be shown that it was provided as soon as reasonably possible. At the time You provide Us with notice of claim, We will assist You with 
Your proof of loss by providing You with instructions and with documents, which You must complete and return to Us. You we required to 
cooperate with Us and provide documentation as requ'ested by Us which is required and necessary to process Your claim and determine if 
benefits are payable. If all required documentation Is not received within 30 days of the date of the Covered Incident (except for 
documentation which has not been furnished for reasons beyond Your control), coverage may be denied. It is Your responsibility to provide 
all required documentation necessary. 
Proof of Loss 
Proof of loss requires that You send Us all the information We request, at Your expense, in order that Your claim may be evaluated and that 
We may make a determination as to whether the claim may be paid. 
Except in the instance of theft or Destroyed Ticket, as noted under the Description of Benefits, We will require that You provide Us with the 
Ticket which could not be used because of a Covered Incident for which insurance is provided under this Plan. In addition to the Ticket, We 
will ask that You include with Your proof of loss any documentation We may request in order to establish the existence of a Covered Incident 
eligible for coverage under the Description of Benefits. We reserve the right to deny the claim if the Ticket You submit as part of Your proof of 
loss evidences redemption by any mark, stamp, hole, tear or other evidence of redemption. 
If admission to an Event was charged to Your Account, but in lieu of a Ticket You received only confirmation of admission by e-mail or the 
promise of admission to the Event upon picking up a Ticket at the Event, and if a Covered Incident occurred for which a claim may be payable 
under this Plan, You must cooperate with Us in providing proof of loss as to the Covered Incident, and We will attempt to complete the 
necessary research to determine that the charge to Your account was for admission to the Event as claimed by You. 
You must provide satisfactory proof of loss as soon as possible after We have informed You as to what You must provide Us and in no case 
more than 30 days after being so informed, except if it can be shown that it was provided as soon as reasonably possible. 
Proof of loss documentation may be mailed to Us at the same address as listed above for mailing a notice of claim. 
Payment of Claims 
If Ticket reimbursement, due to a Covered Incident for which benefits are provided under this Plan, is provided to the Tickethoider by a 
Producer, Venue, or other insurance, the coverage provided by the Event Ticket Protection Plan becomes secondary and will pay only that 
portion of the Ticket expense not reimbursed by the Producer, Venue, or other Insurance. 
If Your proof of loss demonstrates that Your claim is payable according to this Plan, We will reimburse You the amount charged to Your 
Account for the Event Ticket You purchased, loss any reimbursement You may receive, up to the maximum coverage limit as stated in the 
Coverage Overview section. 
Any payment that We make in good faith will fully discharge Us to the extent of that payment. 
When a Covered Incident has caused the Ticketholder to experience a toss for the total charge to the Account and that charge is more than the 
actual face value of the Ticket, eligible benefits will be available on a pro rata reimbursement basis determined by the number of separate 
Tickets purchased for that Event. 
When a Covered Incident has caused the Ticketholder to experience a loss in conjunction with a Multi-day Ticket or Season Ticket, eligible
