funds, and transporting prostitutes to Washington DC could violate federal law and, if exposed, 
generate an international scandal. So surveillance could have a political pay off. 
Even if it is highly implausible that DSK's sexual engagement with the maid could have been 
planned in advance, it remains possible that there was an after-the-fact conspiracy to shape the 
consequences of it to destroy DSK's political career. If DSK was under surveillance on May le, 
this would not be difficult to accomplish. When the maid left the suite at 12:13 PM, the outcome 
could have turned out very differently. After waiting at a vantage point until she saw DSK leave 
the 28'h floor, she immediately used her pass key to re-enter the presidential suite. We do not 
know why she returned to that room, or what she might have been looking for after DSK left, but 
she then exited it very quickly. Minutes later, she asked another maid on the floor about whether 
it was permissible at the Sofitel for a client to take liberties with an employee. The hypothetical 
phrasing of her question could suggest that she had not yet decided on a course of action and, 
before she did, she wanted to determine how her employer would react if she voiced a complaint 
against a client important enough to occupy the VIP suite. She might have concern if the 
authorities were called in to investigate since she had repeatedly falsified her low-cost housing 
papers and had a large sum of money in her bank account that had been deposited there by a 
convicted drug dealer. If so, she may have needed assurances that she would be protected before 
she agreed to filing a complain. Without knowing the content of the cell phone calls and other 
communications between those involved in the unfolding drama, or being able to lip rear what 
was actually said at the re-enactments seen on the CCTV, we cannot exclude the possibility that 
some party helped persuade her in the hour or so before the 911 call was finally made. 
An intervention that helped shaped her decision would not be easy to effect in the space of one 
hour. At a minimum, it would have required that the party working to bring about DSK's 
downfall had both real-time intelligence and a liaison with individuals at the hotel. In addition, 
since the DA received a phone call the next day from a French official furnishing secret 
disparaging information, that party would need a contact in the French government. Such 
requisites may be a tall order but they are not beyond the capabilities of a first-class intelligence 
service. 
There unanswered questions that bear on the event itself include:. 
First, we do not know why Diallo twice entered the presidential suite just before the incident 
without the equipment that she needed to clean the room. 
Second, we do not know if there was anyone in room 2820 besides Diallo during and after 
the encounter with DSK. If she went directly to this room after the encounter, as she stated to the 
prosecutors in late June, who then was inside to open the door for her (since she did not use her 
key.) 
Third, did anyone influence Diallo to deny to police, prosecutors, and the Grand Jury that 
she'd gone to room 2820? 
Fourth, who took DSK's IMF BlackBerry from the Sofitel, after its GPS signals were 
disabled at 12:51 PM, and, more importantly, why was it taken? 
Fifth, was someone anticipating DSK's arrival at the Sofitel at 7:08 PM on May 1r, and, if 
so, how was such information obtained? 
Sixth, who, if anyone, ultimately decided on the call 911 after an hour delay? 
Seventh, if there was a victory dance after the police were called in, what were hotel 
employees celebrating?
