In their BlackBerrys, VIP hosts lovingly store all of their clients' birthdays, children's names, sports teams, 
preferred vodkas. (Some of them also note which types of girls their clients like: loose 
brunettes, intelligent blondes, C-cups, real, and so on.) These are the things that make a good 
host. And a good friend! says Lynn Freeman, another former host whom Uchitel refers to as the 
only other girl who knows her shit. 
It is a kind of friendship. The hosts are much closer to their clients than almost any other service 
provider in a wealthy person's life. Money isn't exchanged directly in most cases, so it can 
genuinely feel as though the host is taking care of you for no other reason than because she 
wants to. In return, sheor he; most hosts are actually menis a part of the entourage, a trusted 
confidante. 
We're not madams, continues Freeman, because she's sensitive about it toothe scandal has changed 
what people think of the position. But they do introduce the men to women they can have. 
What we do is we bring a bunch of girls and guys together. If we worked at a bank and we 
brought a bunch of friends together for happy hour, and then two of them went home and had 
sex, nobody would think anything of it. 
Uchitel says the most she'll do is go over to the bar and find a group of girls and say, Hey girls, do you 
want to come and drink for free at this guy's table? When girls are brought to a client's table, 
there is a twofold benefit for the club. Firstand this part is called the honey trapthe girls 
consume alcohol so that the table will go through bottles faster; second, and more obvious, the 
girls keep the men entertained. Are the guys sometimes married? Uchitel answers, None of our 
business. We are not there to judge. It's not a synagogue. 
Steve Lewis, the former director of Life and current club designer and keeper of the nightlife beat for 
BlackBook, says this is half-true. They are not exactly pimps and madams, but the VIP hosts 
know which girls are loose and will place their clients with them. They know which girls will 
keep quiet. Lewis and others say that VIP hosts will often fly girls they know to events like 
Sundance for their clients. Sure, there are girls in Utah, says Lewis, but not girls they can trust. 
To be a girl who is trusted, you need a track record of having slept with famous men and not talked 
about it. It's an unwritten résumé. Talking about anything that goes on at the clubs is called 
burning the athlete or burning the celebrity. Privacy is prized invaluably in an age when the 
National Enquirer performs police-quality stakeouts and the video capabilities of cell phones 
have turned every banquette kiss into a YouTube trailer. It's a wonder celebrities think they can 
get away with cheating, but if they do, it's because of people like Uchitel. People who 
understand the value of future returns. 
You treat the celebs the way they want to be treated, you give them privacy and ensure no press, and 
then they'll say later, Yeah, I'll have my after-party here,' says Uchitel. That's why we're so 
valuable. 
Uchitel won't talk about Tiger Woods. Partly, it's that omerta. But there are also rumors that she 
secured a deal from Woods's camp. She announced a press conference in early December, as 
though she were going to tell all. Suddenly the press conference was canceled amid reports 
that Uchitel's boldface attorney, Gloria Allred, was seen leaving Woods's attorney's offices. 
Allred's own daughter, attorney Lisa Bloom, told The Early Show, That can only mean one thing:
