Hey are notes in som= key areas: 
<=div> 
Background on the =lobal Allocation team 
• 
Dennis Statt=an is head of the Global Allocation Team. 
• 
Lisa O'Do=nell, Co-COO of the team, has been the Fund officer overseeing BlackRock&#=9;s 
position in our company and has been the chief decision maker in this =rocess. 
• 
She has been extremely aggressive, mean-spirited and=difficult to work with since the beginning 
of their investment. She dislik=s all of their private investments and has stated she wants to make a nega=ive example of 
Jawbone. She objected to our deal in the beginning and feel= like the investment was made despite her viewpoint. 
• 
No one =rom Jawbone has ever met Lisa in person. She refused to meet us either in =er 
Princeton office nor has she ever visited us. We have tried multiple ti=es. 
• 
Lisa has repeatedly stated in front of advisors and bank=rs on the phone that she doesn't care if 
BR loses all of their capital=from this deal- the loss is insignificant for them with the size of their =und. 
• 
Lisa has also stated to me directly that we should neve= expect any help from BlackRock in any 
situation - "we are your cr=ditor, do not ever expect anything from us" 
• 
I have heard f=om several different people that they refer to me as "The Terroris=" internally. 
Terrible given the current state of affairs in the w=rld. 
• 
David Clayton is a non-investing Managing Director with=the Fund and has recently been our 
primary contact recently (he reports to=lisa). 
• 
The Senior Investment Analysts on our deal have been =aniel Daniel and Patrick Edelmann. They 
seem powerless in the situation an= do not stand up to Lisa. 
• 
No one from BlackRock has visited =awbone in 2016. They have not seen any of the new things 
we are working on= No demos of the prototypes, nothing. 
Possible anticipated points from BlackRock and our =esponses 
• 
Management team- we=don't trust Hosain, the Board, his management team, everything he 
=nd the team have told us has turned out to not be true, promises are never=hit. We have missed targets and it has 
been painful. We are taking-great care to make sure we don't repeat the mistakes of the past, =here are reasons we 
missed targets - slow sales in stores, quality issues,=product delays. We had a bad product cycle and we haven't been 
fun=ed to come out of it. Instead of focusing on the business we fight with BR= It's a waste. But to your point it sort of 
doesn't matter=relative to the economically rational decision going forward. 
<=i>Wasting money - opex super high put in this much money three =onths later they needed 
more money Again perhaps we sho=ld have cut expenses earlier but we needed to move the ball forward to whe=e it is 
today in many areas. We have a smart focused plan going forward wh=re have a very manageable burn rate and are 
raising 2 years of operating c=pital. We have never done this in the history of the business. 
<=i>Deals aren't real, they create the term sheets and they ar=n't real, we can4>=804«t respond 
until they are real. No one will move forward with=closing until term sheets are agreed to. This feels like a stall 
tactic.=C24« 
• 
They threw this Larry/JPM term sheet in front of us, L=rry Unrein says he isn't sure if he will do it 
or not, we got the feeling that JP Morgan wasn't a sureshot.=A0- Larry hadn't taken the deal to his investment 
committee and go=ten final approval because he wanted BR to sign off on it before he got th= final approval to ensure 
he didn't have to go back multiple times= If BR shows flexibility and a willingness, Larry will come through and fu=d. 
Other investors are also happy to participate.
