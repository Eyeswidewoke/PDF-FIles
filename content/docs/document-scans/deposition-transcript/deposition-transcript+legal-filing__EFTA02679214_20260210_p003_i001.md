We hold the register of members for the LLP and this =as not been updated to reflect Phaidon Global LLC and JMWT 
Manager LLC bec=ming members of the LLP and PLB LLC and JMWT LLC ceasing to be members, as we were not aware 
of the transfer of partner=hip interests. We have also checked the public registers and note that the=public registers do 
not reflect the change in the membership of the LLP. A= an initial step, it will therefore be necessary to pass ratification 
resolutions of the LLP members to confir= the membership of the LLP and update the registers accordingly. If Phaido= 
Global LLC and JMWT Manager LLC can be included as members from now (rath=r than ratifying historic membership), 
this will be a much easier (and preferable) process. Have Phaidon Global L=C and JMWT Manager LLC taken any action as 
members of the LLP to date? 
We have based the steps on the following assumptions:=u> 
•<=pan style="font:7.0pt "Times New Roman""> *=A0 the LLP, Topco and Midco have no liabilities (th=y have given 
no guarantees, entered into no contracts, there are no loan a=rangements in place (intra-group or otherwise) and they 
have no creditors); 
*apan style="font:7.0pt "Times New Roman""> *=A0 the share capital of Topco exceeds the value of =he Midco 
shares by at least £1 (this will enable us to reduce the cap=tal of Topco, leaving El of capital to create sufficient 
distributable profits to enable the shares of Midco to be trans=erred to the LLCs as a dividend in specie); 
*apan style="font:7.0pt "Times New Roman""> *=A0 the share capital of Midco exceeds the value of =he JMWT 
shares by at least £1; 
• 
style="font:7.0pt "Times New Roman""> •=A0 the LLP, Topco and Midco have no assets other th=n the shares 
of Topco, Midco and JMWT (respectively);=/p> 
•<=pan style="font:7.0pt "Times New Roman""> *=A0 accounts/balance sheets of Topco and Midco will =e provided 
to show the assets and liabilities of Topco and Midco before ea=h company reduces its share capital, and also an 
updated balance sheet will be provided following completion of the-capital reduction. It is possible to just have 
accounts/balance sheets for=the position following the capital reduction, but as the directors will ha=e personal liability 
for the solvency statements they make in connection with the capital reduction, it is prefe=able for them to have 
accounts/balance sheets to refer to at the time the =olvency statements are made; 
•<=pan style="font:7.0pt "Times New Roman""> •=A0 accounts/a balance sheet will be provided for th= LLP to show 
the assets and liabilities of the LLP at the time of the dist=ibution of assets to the members; 
*apan style="font:7.0pt "Times New Roman""> *=A0 the LLP Agreement dated 3 October 2012 was signe=; 
*apan style="font:7.0pt "Times New Roman""> *=A0 JMWT Manager LLC entered into a deed of adherenc= to the 
LLP Agreement (we have seen the deed of adherence signed by Phaido= Global LLC); and 
*apan style="font:7.0pt "Times New Roman""> *....A0 the members confirmed the termination of members=ip of 
PLB, LLC and JMWT LLC as members of the LLP (in addition to transfer=ing interests in the partnership to the incoming 
members which is included in the "reorganization agreement&q=ot;).
