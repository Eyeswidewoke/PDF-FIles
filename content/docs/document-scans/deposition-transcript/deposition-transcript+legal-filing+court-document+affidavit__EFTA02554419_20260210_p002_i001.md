I suspect that =orcing children to do anything is probably harmful. But it's pos=ible to introduce writing 
and (secondarily) reading in a way that seems to=enhance thinking. That's the idea behind "invented spelling=quot; 
(here's a link to some of the work: 
https://pages.wustl.eduifiles/=ages/imce/treiman/Read%20%26%20Treiman_Childrens_Invented_Spelli=g_final.pdf 
<https://page=.wustl.eduifiles/pages/imce/treiman/Read%20%26%20TreimanChildrens Invente=Spelling_final.pdf> 
). Back in the early '50s, a philosopher friend o= mine (Israel Scheffler) brought me some pages on which his two-year 
old s=n had written things that he thought were gibberish, wondering if I could =ake something of it. It was immediately 
obvious that the kind had le=rned the names of the letters and was spontaneously stringing them togethe= to express 
himself in writing. And making interesting generalizatio=s. Thus the letter "A", pronounced /ey/, he used for the w=rds 
"came," "pet", "pat"; the letter "i=quot;, pronounced /ay/, he used for "pie", "pot," &quo=;buti" . And so on. It all made 
sense. Our kids did the s=me thing. Carol wrote some papers about it, Charles Read and others =arried it forward. 
Turns out to be a great way to teach reading too.=Kids spontaneously express themselves, often in creative way, and the 
tran=ition to official orthography is not that difficult now that they have the=general idea. 
There's a debate about it in ed=cational circles, and though I haven't followed it, my impression is t=at 
old-fashioned forcing into a mold probably wins out, undermining the jo= of self-expression and possibly reading. 
As you may know, G=lileo regarded invention of the alphabet as among the greatest of all huma= 
inventions. Can do no better than quote his own words. He regarded =he invention of the alphabet as "surpassing all 
stupendous inventions," asking =E2 what sublimity of mind was his who dreamed of finding means to communicate his 
deepest though=s to any other person, though distant by mighty intervals of place and time! =f talking with those who 
are in India; of speaking to those who are not yet b=rn and will not be born for a thousand or ten thousand years; and 
with what facility, by the different arrangements of twenty characters upon a page!=E2
