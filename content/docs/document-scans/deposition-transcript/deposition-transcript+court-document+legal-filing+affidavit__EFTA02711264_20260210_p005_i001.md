F(a +b) = 
(a +b)2=a2+62+2ab 
and 
F(a)= a2, F(b)=b2
therefore 
+2ab > 
+62
The product tab is nothing else but the measure of the interaction of the two parts a and b, namely the interaction of a with b 
and b with a.ai2 To consider this interaction, start with effect and work backward. 
The operation of the brain is a nonlinear process. It is a system of self-organization where given sets of oscillations pull 
themselves together into a particular frequency band. 
Man is dead. We are now concerned with the concept of process. aceln return for the renunciation of accustomed demands on 
explanation, it offers a logical means of comprehending wider fields of experience, necessitating proper attention to the 
placing of object-subject separation.F Instead of ficemanfi and ficenot man,fi move the object-subject separation one step back 
to objectify a universe of simultaneous operations: the process of interaction of ficemanfi and ficenot man,fi integrated on the 
level of the neural activity of aceman.a In this system there is ficenot only a universe, but there are also elements capable of 
observing this universe.fil4 The observation is through a nervous system similar to that of the observer-participant in the 
universe under consideration. Reality is no longer to be found hidden in the subjects and objects of ficemanfi and ficenot man.1 
For discussing integration at the neural level we must look to the interval. The only way to capture that moment is with the 
death of man, the death of the concept of the individual. It has been demonstrated that the brain responds to change in terms 
of the information it has already received. ficeThe past experience of the person determines the manner of his response to a 
given stimulus. The primary direct effects of stimuli commonly have little bearing on their ultimate expressions.e The brain 
continually functions during the moment man termed the interval, this functioning being dependent on its physiological 
construction and stored information. There is no interval. There is only what the brain is doing. 
Media do not exist. Media must be considered as a single level of information movement, which is a consideration of the 
world of the past. There arc no linear movements of information. Information is a process. Its whole is measurable only by 
effect. Be concerned with process, with transaction, not with media. Media are in the world of the past. They are the received 
signals from there-and-then. The medium is not the message. The medium is the confusion. The message is operational. It is a 
process. 
Information is a process. Not words or ideas, or ace! like it,a ficeI clonfinit like it,ft but the total effect of experience, of the 
brainfirds operation. Not ideas or opinions, but the changes brought about by the experience, the neural involvement. 
Information is a nonlinear relationship established between output and input, the simultaneous universe of experiential 
feedback of information. Points of view are beside the point. 
If media do not exist, neither do separations such as form and content, concepts which belong to the treatment of signals 
there-and-then. In the simultaneous operations of the brain there is neither form nor content. There is information that directs 
the brainaTMs activity. All imagined considerations of form and content are considerations of the interpretation of the ordering 
of direct experience. This is in the past. Be concerned only with the ordering, with the present.
