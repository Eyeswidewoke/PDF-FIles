The Company, Brasa Purchaser, Brasa Holdings, Bran Merger Sub Inc. and Fogo Holdings were formed during 2012 for the purpose of

On July 21, 2012, the Company acquired. through its wholly-owned subsidiary. Brass Moldings. the Predecessor from FC Holdings Inc. for an 
aggregate consideration of $388,494, including non-cash consideration of $1,395 related to the exchange of share-based awards (Note 8). This 
transaction was financed by third-party loans to Brass Holdings and equity contributions by the Till. Fund& The 2012 Acquisition was accounted 
for as a business combination under the acquisition method of accounting. Accordingly, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at 
fair value with the remaining purchase price recorded as goodwill. 
The Company estimated the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as part of the business combination, including working 
capital, property and equipment, primarily related to restaurant operations, and intangible asset& Intangible assets acquired in the 2012 Acquisition 
include $107,300 attributable to the Fogo de Chao trade name and $1,500 for various non-compete arrangements. The trade name was determined 
to have an indefinite life and is not being amortized. The non-compete arrangements arc being amortized over 5 years, the life of the non-compete 
agreement& 
The fair value of the trade name was estimated using an income approach. specifically known as the relief from royalty method. The relief 
from royalty method calculates the approximate royalty saved that is attributable to the sale of products and services using the trade manes. The 
forecasted revenue expected to be generated under the trade name were based on the projected revenue of the Successor. 
The fair value of the non-compete agreements was determined using a variation of the income approach known as the with-and-without 
method. The income approach estimates value basal on the net economic benefit (i.e., net operating income or cash flows) to be received over the 
life of the asset, discounted to present value. The measurement is based on the value indicated by current market expectations about those future 
amounts. Weighted average amortization period for the non-compete agreements is 5 years.
