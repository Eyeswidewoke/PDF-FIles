5.3 
No Waiver: Cumulative Remedies. No right or remedy is exclusive. Borrower hereby 
acknowledges that none of the provisions of this Section 5, including any remedies set forth or referenced 
herein, is 'manifestly unreasonable" for the purposes of the Cape Town Convention. Each may be used 
successively and cumulatively and in addition to any other right or remedy referred to above or otherwise 
available to Agent and/or Lenders at law or in equity, including, such rights and/or remedies as are 
provided for in the UCC and/or the Cape Town Convention, but in no event shall Agent and/or Lenders be 
entitled to recover any amount in excess of the maximum amount recoverable under Applicable Law with 
respect to any Event of Default. No express or implied waiver by Agent and/or Lenders of any Default or 
Event of Default hereunder shall in any way be, or be construed to be, a waiver of any future or 
subsequent Default or Event of Default. The failure or delay of Agent and/or Lenders in exercising any 
rights granted it hereunder upon the occurrence of any of the contingencies set forth herein shall not 
constitute a waiver of any such right upon the continuation or reoccurrence of any such contingencies or 
similar contingencies, and any single or partial exercise of any particular right by Agent and/or Lenders 
shall not exhaust the same or constitute a waiver of any other right provided for or otherwise referred to 
herein. After the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default, the acceptance by Agent and/or Lenders 
of any installment of principal and/or interest or of any other sum owing hereunder or under the other 
Loan Documents shall not constitute a waiver of such Default (unless such Default arose from the failure 
to pay such installment and such installment was paid in full) or Event of Default, regardless of Agent's 
and/or either Lenders knowledge or lack of knowledge thereof at the time of acceptance of any such 
payment and shall not constitute a reinstatement of this Agreement if Agent and/or either Lender has sent 
Borrower a notice of default, unless Agent shall have agreed in writing to reinstate this Agreement and 
waive the Default or Event of Default. To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, Borrower waives any 
rights now or hereafter conferred by statute or otherwise that limit or modify any rights or remedies of 
Agent and/or Lenders under this Agreement, including, without limitation, the provisions of Articles 11(2) 
and 13(2) of the Convention and Article IX(6) of the Protocol.
