room, waving his =arms, the shirttail of his oxford shirt poking out of his khakis, as he =cried, "'Yes! We're golden! We're 
going to pass! No! Shit! We're screwed! We're going to fail! No! Yes! We're golden! We're screwed!' We'd get real up or 
real down, and it's still that way. We love to get =up and down." 
Ballmer is the reason Gates always flies coach when he is traveling on business. "If you're going to work for this 
company," Ballmer told me, "you're going to rent a certain kind of car and stay =in a certain kind of hotel and fly coach, 
because that's business, and =anything else is just aggrandizement." Gates once chartered a plane because he had to get 
somewhere in a hurry, but Ballmer gave him so much grief that Gates is still explaining why he did it. Experienced fliers 
=into and out of Seattle know to scan the cabin for a man with a blanket =over his head-that's Bill Gates, taking a nap. 
Because Bill Gates was my first E-mail relationship, I wasn't always sure how to comport myself electronically, and 
occasionally I solicited advice from experienced E-mailers. Once, =while I was questioning a media analyst named Mark 
Stahlman about a point of E-mail etiquette, he said to me, "Well, hey, you're not a digital guy!" This line often popped 
into my head when I was E-mailing =Bill. Was I behaving like a digital guy? Is digital guyhood what nerds =will molt into 
when the information highway reaches everyone's door? One evening, I was at home listening to some music, doing this 
geeky dance = do and, as usual, wondering whether the Wall Street types across the street were watching me, when I 
suddenly thought, Would Bill Gates care =about those guys? I took this as a sign I was becoming a digital guy. Around the 
same time, I read an essay in Wired magazine by Paul =Saffo, who is a director of the Institute for the Future, a think 
tank =in Menlo Park, which argued that the information highway is going to cause a flowering of personal expression not 
seen in our society since =the sixties, and that when this happens (maybe in five years) people whom we now think of as 
computer nerds will have the same hipness that =in retrospect we now assign to beatniks. 
I wrote Gates a message with the title "How does the future make you feel?" (Putting a title on messages is one of the 
different things about E-mail communication. It is a little like writing a publicity release for what you have to say. 
However, it does focus the message.) 
How does the rapid change in the power of microprocessors make you feel? The certainty that microprocessors 
will =grow twice as fast every eighteen months and that nothing in Nature, no =fire or earthquake or tidal wave, is 
powerful enough to stop this from =happening. Are you thrilled by this? Do you think that this power is God, as you 
understand God? Is it possible this power could be bad? =/p> 
Gates wrote back: 
Feelings are pretty personal. I love coming up with new ideas or seeing in advance what is going to count and 
then making it happen. I love working with smart people.... Our business =is very very competitive-one or two false 
moves and you can fall behind =in a way that would wipe you out. Market share does not give you the right to relax. IBM 
is the best example of this. This is very scary but =also makes it very interesting. 
The digital revolution is all about facilitation--creating tools to make things easy. When I was a kid I was a lot 
more curious than I am today--perhaps I have lost less curiosity =than the average adult but if I had had the information 
tools we are building today I would know a lot more and not have given up learning some things. 
These tools will be really cool. Say today you want to meet someone with similar interests to talk or take a trip 
together =or whatever? Its hard and somewhat random. Say you want to make sure you pick a good doctor or read a 
good book? We can make all of these things work so well--its empowering stuff. Enough for now. 
I wrote a message titled "TV as the Opium of the People": 
Some people are afraid of interactive TV. TV is a drug, goes the argument, and the technology that Microsoft 
and others =are supplying is going to make the drug stronger. People will be inside =more than ever, cut off from their 
neighbors, watching interactive monster truck contests. Or porno. They will pile up large cable and credit card charges. A
