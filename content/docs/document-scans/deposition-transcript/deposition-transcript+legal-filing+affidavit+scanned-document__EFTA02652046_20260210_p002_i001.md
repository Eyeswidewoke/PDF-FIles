with Wellfleet payments well after I stopped using the =ouse, again with exorbitant taxes. Of course I also needed to 
live, =o that meant more withdrawals with exorbitant taxes. Under those con=itions I requested some tax relief from 
the marital trust -- which, of cou=se, was established on the understanding that it would be available to the=survivor. 
Your reaction, to my amazement, was to =efuse, even under these remarkable circumstances, 
by imposing absurd conditions that no one with a shred of dignity =ould accept, no concern of yours. Of course, no such 
questions ever were o= even the remote horizon when I was trustee, before choosing you to replac= me, or on any 
other occasion when I arranged for funds to go to you, eith=r as an ample inheritance or for regular expenses. 
Your le=ter now makes your reasoning very clear. Your proposal is that you s=ould remain in 
total control, evidently a matter of great importance for y=u. And following your principles, as exhibited with crystal 
clarity =nder even the extreme circumstances just described, you can ensure that th= funds in their entirety will go to 
you, though I suppose in your kindness=you might relax your strict regimen slightly when the day comes, as it mus=, 
when I am no longer in a position to retain a shred of dignity and to re=use an intrusive and humiliating interrogation. 
However, t=ere is a simpler way to realize your objectives, even more fully. Yo= can resign as 
trustee -- of course possible, just as I did when I appoint=d you. We can then agree that you receive the entire funds 
right now= instead of waiting until I die, so that you can use them right now for wh=tever purposes you like. Plainly 
that's more efficient, and even=more lucrative for you than your suggestion. 
It's tru= that this is one possible proposal, as you suggest. 
Anoth=r proposal is the one I suggested. True, there are some arcane tax i=sues, but these can 
easily be resolved, as your lawyer can explain to you,=with common consent among the beneficiaries -- which means 
your consent.4=pan> 
There are, of course, other possibilities. I could pur=ue legal measures to have the trust used in 
the manner in which it was int=nded. I could also look into the disbursements that have been made t= family members 
(so I have learned) without informing me, and could look i=to why I haven't been receiving any income from the trust for 
years (until I finally raised the question), and why investments were made the way =hey were done, yielding long-term 
returns that would be of no use for me, =ighly irregular for an elderly person -- which, as I wrote you, greatly surprised 
financial advisers I consulted when I finally began to pay attentio=. And, furthermore, why I never received any 
statements about what w=s going on for years, until I finally asked what is going on with the trus=. And perhaps other 
matters that evidently concern you, as shown by =our request for protection for past actions. But I haven=#39;t yet 
shifted to your domain and still retain some illusions about fam=ly relations. 
There are other matters that ='ve written to you about several times, with no response, which 
means = presume that you do not want to hear them. They don't specifica=ly have to do with this matter, so if you have 
gotten this far in the lett=r, you can stop here. But they are on my mind, and I want to clear t=e air -- if anyone wishes to 
look. 
My father coul= die in peace, knowing his children would ensure that his wife would be ta=en 
care of. I don't have that luxury.<=span> 
No lawyers or words were necessary. 1= was simply obvious that we would hand over to her 
what there was of an in=eritance, the house and everything in it. And of course we were very=pleased that he had joy 
and companionship in his last years.
