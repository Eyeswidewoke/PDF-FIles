27 March 2015 
US Fixed Income Weekly 
The view in enOrtgeirje credit 
Existing home sales skimmed under forecasts on Monday (+1.2% instead of 
+1.7%) while new home sales jumped that threshold Tuesday (+7.8% instead 
of -3.5%). The FHFA home price index came in Tuesday up YoY by 5.48%. 
Housing continued to deliver mixed signals. although generally showing 
modest growth and decelerating home price appreciation. 
Adding up to fair value in 62/FN 
With the first month of MIP-induced prepayments behind us and agency MBS 
prices showing some signs of stability post the March FOMC meeting, now 
presents a fine time to revisit relative value in agency pass-throughs. Sticking 
to our fair value formula (first detailed in our special report from January 27, 
2015), we find that at current levels: 
• 
GN2/FN 4.5% looks quite rich and we recommend shorting, even though it 
is negative carry (-1/32 per month) 
• 
GN2/FN 4.0% looks modestly rich, and being short is slight positive carry 
(<1/32 per month)

Fair value framework 
To estimate fair value, we separate and price out the component risks (pay 
delay, liquidity, credit and prepayment) and then adjust the FN value to the 
corresponding GN2 fair value (Figure 6). We begin by running the FNCL at its 
market price in the DB prepay model to obtain an OAS. To calculate pay delay, 
we then alter the FNCL in the model to pay P&I five days sooner, matching 
G2SF, and price at constant OAS. For the liquidity premium FNCL carries over 
G2SF, we assume current GD/FN swap prices. For value of full faith and credit 
premium, we tighten the initial FNCL OAS by the interpolated agency 
debenture spread over Treasuries and then re-price in the same model (Tight 
OAS Price - Mkt Price = Credit value). Finally, to calculate the prepayment 
differential, we price FNCL at even OAS but have the prepay model treat the 
FNCL as G2SF. Here the model assumes an FHANA split of 70/30% (based on 
historical percentage) and assigns corresponding upfront and annual MIPs to 
FNCL based on WALA. 
We can then sum the individual components to arrive at the fair value 
difference between G2 and FN, which we compare to actual GN2/FN swaps. 
The biggest discrepancies lie in the 4.0 and 4.5% coupon where GN2 appears 
overvalued by 11/32s and 1-22/32s, respectively. We note however that hedge 
adjusted carry for the 62/FN 4.5% short is slightly negative, but is marginally 
positive for the G2/FN 4.0% short.
