altering exculpatory information, failing to tell the court the unreliability of information...If this 
is by the book, we need to rewrite the book and I promise you we will." 
ABC News (9/30, Mallin, 2.97M) reports, "Among other issues highlighted by Graham, 
Horowitz criticized the FBI for its reliance in the Page surveillance on a dossier compiled by 
former British spy Christopher Steele which included salacious allegations that Trump had been 
compromised by Russia. Attorney General William Barr recently declassified information for 
Graham's committee revealing one of Steele's primary sources for the dossier had previously 
been investigated for his ties to Russian intelligence." 
NBC News (9/30, Williams, 6.14M) reports, "Committee Democrats, by contrast, said the 
inspector general's report concluded that the FBI had legitimate reasons for opening the 
investigation, after an Australian diplomat told U.S. authorities that a Trump campaign aide, 
George Papadopoulos, had said Russians offered him dirt on Hillary Clinton." Sen. Dianne 
Feinstein (D-CA) "said the errors in the Page FISA application were serious, `but they played no 
part in the broader Russia investigation.' Comey agreed. `The overarching investigation was 
very important,' he said. `The Page slice of it, far less, given the scope." 
Fox News (9/30, Singman, 27.59M) reports that Comey "said it didn't `ring a bell' when 
asked whether he received an investigative referral on Hillary Clinton purportedly approving 'a 
plan' attempting to tie" Trump "to Russia and distract from her email scandal before the 2016 
election." Graham "asked Comey about the newly declassified information released Tuesday by 
Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe. `You don't remember getting an investigatory 
lead from the intelligence community? Sept. 7, 2016, U.S. intelligence officials forwarded an 
investigative referral to James Comey and Strzok regarding Clinton's approval of a plan [about] 
Trump...as a means of distraction?' Graham asked Comey Wednesday. That doesn't ring any 
bells with me,' Comey replied." 
The New York Post (9/30, Nelson, 4.57M) reports, "Ratcliffe wrote that US intelligence 
officials 'forwarded an investigative referral to FBI Director James Comey and Deputy Assistant 
Director of Counterintelligence Peter Strzok regarding "U.S. Presidential candidate Hillary 
Clinton's approval of a plan concerning U.S. Presidential candidate Donald Trump and Russian 
hackers hampering U.S. elections as a means of distracting the public from her use of a private 
mail server"' Handwritten notes from then-CIA Director John Brennan - also disclosed by 
Ratcliffe - say Brennan briefed then-President Barack Obama on `alleged approval by Hillary 
Clinton on July 26, 2016 of a proposal from one of her foreign policy advisors to vilify Donald 
Trump by stirring up a scandal claiming interference by Russian security services." 
The Federalist (9/30, 126K) reports Chairman Graham "grill[ed]" Comey "about the '17 
significant errors and omissions' as well as the `50 errors in the FBI's Woods process' in 
applications to spy on" Page. Graham asked, "Does the FBI director have any responsibility to 
make sure the facts are right when they're given to the court?" Comey replied, "Not in 
connection with the certification. ... But in general the FBI director is responsible for everything 
that is being done underneath the FBI director." Graham asked, "Do you wish that you had 
informed the court that Mr. Page was in fact, working with the CIA, and that explains these 
contacts?" Comey said, "I don't agree with your preamble. I don't think the record established 
that he was working with the CIA. I think Horowitz found he was a contact." Comey was "shot 
down by Graham who said that there was an email disclosing the relationship between Page 
and the CIA." 
The Daily Caller (9/30, Ross, 716K) says Comey "pleaded ignorance" throughout the 
hearing "regarding significant problems with the Steele dossier." Matt Vespa writes on Townhall 
(9/30, 177K) that Comey's testimony "can be summed up in three words. I. Know. Nothing." 
Wednesday afternoon, Trump retweeted a post from Hoover Institution media fellow Paul 
Sperry, which said, "BREAKING: Comey swears he doesn't remember hearing anything about 
Steele's primary subsource, Igor Danchenko, being the subject of an FBI C.I. investigation, as a 
suspected Russian agent, and doesn't recall his own CrossFire Hurricane team interviewing 
Danchenko in Jan 2017" In his tweet, Trump wrote, "LIAR! I I" Late Wednesday, Trump retweeted
