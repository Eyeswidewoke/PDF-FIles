=div dir="ltr"> 
The records that I have seen do not indicate what =our expectations (or Carol's) were as to how the 
Marital Trusts we=e to be made available to you after Carol was gone — for that the =ndependent trustee of the trusts 
(whether me or my successor) has to rely =n the terms of the trusts themselves, the information that's given by the trust 
beneficiarie=, and the law surrounding such trusts. 
I'd be interested, of course, in knowing about th= records you have seen, but it would hardly be 
surprising if there is no e=plicit record of what is obvious simply to common sense. We were a m=rried couple who 
cared for each other and for our children, putting a Trus= in Carol's name for tax purposes. What sort of lunacy would it 
=o set up a Trust for one of us to have access to but not the other? =o of course you are unlikely to find notes about it. 
If Harry forces=this to litigation, all of this will have to come up, either in court or i= public in some other manner. 
=/div> 
When I appointed Harry to replace me as trust=e, I took for granted that he would handle the trust as I 
had. His b=havior since, and this latest proposal, make it very clear how wrong that assumption was. This proposal calls 
for him to be in =omplete charge, which means, as he has shown, that I can only plead for so=e funds by accepting 
conditions that he knows I will not accept. You=recall, I presume, that this was true even when I faced an enormous tax 
bill because my IRA was being depleted for th= benefit of the family. 
To refresh your memory, let me repeat again w=at was happening with my IRA until I learned about it. 
There is a ma=datory withdrawal. Half was being distributed to family. The other half was being used for taxes and 
management fees for the entire=estate. In order to paanedical expenses, and to pay $50,=00 a year for rent and 
upkeep on the house in Wellfleet that we had given =o the children and that I was barely using, I had to withdraw extra 
funds from the IRA, with the onerous tax burden.=C240 The same when I withdrew something to live on. Under these 
cir=umstances, Harry refused to release funds from the Trust for tax relief wi=hout onerous and humiliating conditions 
that he knew I would not accept. Easy to predict what might happen under =ess extreme conditions. It was not until 
2017 that I was able to ove=come the accumulated burden of these actions.

In the previous paragraph you offer to "refresh my mem=ry" and in the prior paragraph you say "You 
recall, I pres=me 
". Without going into detail, I have to note th=t my recollection of the events you describe is not 
consistent with yours (though it may not be ent=rely consistent with Harry's either — I am not sure).40=A0

Since my own rec=llections may be the subject of testimony in the legal proceeding that Har=y has 
initiated, or in one that you may commence, I think it better that I not recite my own recollections her=. 
Note that Harry's exhibit B, beginning wi=h section 9, is utterly false, and consciously so. All of the above 
has be=n explained to him over and over. It is not only consciously false, but is framed as a vicious and ugly attack on 
Valeria, implicitly a=cusing her of responsibility for the escalation of expenses which, as Harr= knows, was caused by the 
actions just described once again.=span style="font-size:11.0ptfont-family:"Calibri","sans-=erif";colorllf497d5 
=/div> 
For such reasons, Harry's proposal is, as=l said, too outrageous to discuss.
