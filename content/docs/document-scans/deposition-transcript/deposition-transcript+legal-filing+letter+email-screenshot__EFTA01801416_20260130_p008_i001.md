alone if it needs to" — than =he veiled sorts that had done so much to drive attention to the issue in t=e previous two 
years. Those threats sounded even more direct at the openin= of the Knesset's winter session on Tuesday, framed by 
the 40th anniversary of the October War, the trauma of which sti=l reverberates in Israel. 
"A preventive war= even a preventive strike, is among the most difficult decisions a governm=nt can take, because it will 
never be able to prove what would have happen=d if it had not acted," Netanyahu said. "But the key difference between 
the Six Day War and the Yom Kippur War l=es first of all in the fact that in the Six-Day War we launched a preventi=e 
strike that broke the chokehold our enemies had placed on us, and on Yom=Kippur the government decided, despite all 
warnings, to absorb the full force of an enemy attack."

Foreign Policy 
New technolog=es are dramatically reshaping the geopolitics of the Middle East 
Amy Myers Jaffe, Ed=Morse 
October 16, 2013 --=Forty years have passed since the Arab oil embargo went into effect on Oct= 16, 1973, triggering a 
period of incredible change and turmoil. After the=United States provided support to Israel during the Yom Kippur War, 
a cartel of developing-world countries (via the=Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC) banned the 
sal= of their oil to Israel's allies and thereby set in motion geopolitical ci=cumstances that eventually allowed them to 
wrest control over global oil production and pricing from the gian= international oil companies -- ushering in an era of 
significantly higher=oil prices. The event was hailed at the time as the first major victory of="Third World" powers to 
bring the West to its knees. Designed in part to bring Arab populations their due af=er decades of colonialism, the 
embargo opened the floodgates for an unprec=dented transfer of wealth out of America and Europe to the Middle East. 
Ov=rnight, the largest segment of the global economy, the oil market, became politicized as never before in =istory. 
But four decades la=er, the shoe may finally be on the other foot. Now, on the 40th anniversar= of the 1973 embargo, 
the United States has a historic opportunity to lead=a counterrevolution against the energy world created by OPEC as 
innovation in the U.S. energy industry looks pois=d to end the decades-long, precarious "dependence on foreign 
oil.&quo=; Washington should seize the opportunity and push to democratize energy g=obally, just as its Silicon Valley 
giants have democratized information. 
In the run-up to 19=3, two-thirds of global ownership of oil moved from the private sector of =merican and European 
companies to public-sector national oil companies. Ra=her than let the forces of supply and demand determine prices, 
post-1973, the lowest-cost oil producers, such as=Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Iran, artificially shut production and 
discouraged=capital investment, creating a lasting wedge of rents or financial profita=ility that market conditions never 
warranted. (Today, oil prices in real terms are more than four times highe= than in 1972.) A massive industrial 
restructuring occurred over the cours= of a half-decade, as state-owned enterprises, with limited project-manage=ent 
skills and bloated workforces, surpassed the oil majors like Chevron and Shell in both capitalization and=size.
