We keep finding outrageous false information from Ma= and Harry, such as that the funds in the Marital Trust was only 
$1,000,00= until the Lexington house was sold and incorporated to it. This is = flat lie -- as the documents I sent you 
prove it (Bainco statement from December 2014 and Harry's e-mail from =ay 2015, when the Lexington house was sold). 
Also outrageous to say that the Trust was providing = house to Noam, when the apartment in Cambridge was bought 
with half of a =ortgage with a commercial institution that we were paying monthly and with=half of the funds coming 
from a loan from the Marital Trust with the highest possible interest rate, when Noam =ould have bought it himself with 
the funds from his IRA, that was being di=tributed to them. The only reason for this loan from the Marital Tru=t was to 
have the apartment tied to the trust and not allow to have it as a jointly owned property with me, as=Noam requested 
many times. Requests very well documented in e-mails =xchanges. 
There are numberless other examples of them acting i= bad faith and since it has been a pattern from them, with their 
father be=ng competent and productive, I have to express my concerns for the future,=if Noam and/or I become 
somehow limited in our cognitive capacities and they try to manipulate again or if Noam di=s before me and they 
contest Noam's will. 
Although we preferred a settlement, if we would have=gone to court, much more would be discovered and we would 
have the documen=s that now we are missing to prove what had been done wrong. With th= settlement we won't have 
access to them anymore. 
It seems to me that the moment requires that in thei= releases they acknowledge explicitly that they recognized all the 
gifts t=ey have received from Noam in the form of trusts for them, trusts for the =randchildren, the Lexington house, the 
Wellfleet house, royalties for children and grandchildren, payment of =xpenses, distributions from Noam's IRA to them, 
justifying the settlem=nt, and now the Marital Trust where Noam is waiving most of his rights to =t, and most important 
also correct through the documents that I provided (Bainco statement and the email from=Harry) that the Marital Trust 
in December 31, 2014 had a market value of $=,502,581, and that the Lexington house was sold in May 2015, therefore 
it =as not the proceeds from the house that elevated the assets of the Marital Trust from $1,000,000 to the curre=t 
value -- as they falsely stated. 
It also should include that they recognize that the =oney that Noam was left with, it is for him to live his life with his 
wife= and that if some is left (hopefully Noam will live long enough to use it =11) they agree that Noam decided to leave 
in his will only to his wife, Valeria. Therefore with this settle=ent, they are not going to contest Noam's will or claim any 
additional=funds. 
I think we have to address this information, or we w=ll be signing that all the false information they gave us is correct 
and r=sk to have more problems in the future. 
We accept the agreement, but we don't have to ac=ept their false information.
