Working for Top Bosses on Wall St. Has Its Perks - The Archive - The New York Times

something that I don't have." 
For example, he said, one of the assistants "can pick up the stresses in one of my trader's voices and put 
the call right through; that can save me hundreds of thousands of dollars." 
Accordingly, Mr. Epstein, who lives and works on a private island in the Virgin Islands but maintains 
an office in New York, does not stint in compensating them. In addition to the rich payday, he also 
ladles on the perks: he maintains a charge account at Frederic Fekkai, the society hair dresser, for their 
unlimited use and pays for all food eaten during his lengthy business hours, including takeout from Le 
Cirque. On trips on his Boeing 727, he frequently takes two of the assistants with him. 
When one of them, 
who is 38, became pregnant last year and talked of leaving, he bought 
her a Mercedes-Benz 
to make her commuting easier and agreed to pay for a full-time nanny so 
that she could keep working for him. 
"There is no way that I could lose 
to motherhood," said Mr. Epstein, who is in his early 50's and 
is a bachelor. 
There are those on Wall Street who feel that it is hard to attach a true value to such people. 
"They know everything and they eventually take over," said Michael M. Thomas, a former Lehman 
Brothers partner. Mr. Thomas retained his assistant for 16 years and as a child he remembers receiving 
personal letters from his father, also a financial executive, that were signed by his secretary. "You are 
paying for loyalty as well as indispensability. Grasso took home $139 million and he paid the keeper of 
his secrets a quarter million. That is a very small economy." 
In Mr. Grasso's case, his assistant remained loyal to him. According to lawyers close to the case, the 
assistant, SooJee Lee, 38, was reticent about her boss when she was interviewed by stock exchange 
lawyers as they compiled a report on Mr. Grasso's pay, which totaled $192.9 million in compensation 
and paid pension benefits in his eight years as chief executive. 
Their conclusions, released this week in what is known as the Webb report, noted that comparing the 
pay of Mr. Grasso as chairman of a self-regulated institution with that of the chief executives of big 
Wall Street firms was inappropriate; the report said he received $144 million to $156 million in 
excessive compensation. 
In many ways the role of the assistant as omnipotent gatekeeper has evolved in recent years as the 
corporate conduct of chief executives has become a target for regulators. A number of chief executives 
of Wall Street firms shun e-mail these days, not because they are Luddites, but because e-mail 
messages have ended up as evidence in cases brought by regulators. Now, to send e-mail messages to 
these men, one has to send a message to his assistant. 
The executive assistant has long been a crucial figure in the busy life of the Wall Street executive, but 
the nature of the relationship has changed. In the more relaxed time of partnerships and privacy, they 
tended to be older, with a more circumscribed set of duties. With the increased pressure that came from 
firms going public, combined with the relentless beat of travel and ceremony, executives have started to 
attract a younger, more resilient breed of assistant to keep up with them. 
The executives have also gone for quantity. Having two executive assistants is de rigueur for most 
executives these days. Drivers are also paid hefty sums on Wall Street. According to the Webb report,
