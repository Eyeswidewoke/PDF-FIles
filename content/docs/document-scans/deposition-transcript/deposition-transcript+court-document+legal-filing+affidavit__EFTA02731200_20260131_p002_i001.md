L 
Overview of The Scheme 
From at least 1994 through approximately 2005, Epstein engaged in a pattern of 
enticing minor girls to engage in illicit sex acts, including by engaging in paid sex acts between 
approximately 2002 and 2005. This conduct is roughly divided into two time periods and courses 
of conduct: First, starting approximately no later than 1994, Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, his 
romantic and business partner, groomed and ultimately abused a relatively small number of 
victims, including 
in the course of longer-term abuse. This grooming and abuse 
included befriending 
• y and bestowing generalized financial benefits separate from 
payment for particular sex acts, as well as regular travel with 
Second. starting in approximately 2002. this pattern changed significantly, when a few 
of Epstein's initial victims began to recruit local girls and women to provide Epstein with 
"massages" that would include sex acts. Epstein would pay both the participant and the recruiter 
on a per-session basis. At this time, which also was approximately when Maxwell became less 
involved in Epstein's daily life, the girls who began to provide sexualized massages to Epstein 
themselves began to recruit friends and acquaintances, who recruited their own friends, leading to 
the "pyramid scheme" operation for which we charged Epstein with sex trafficking in 2019. 
When victims visited Epstein's residences, they usually were contacted via telephone 
by individuals who worked for Epstein to arrange additional massages. In New York, the primary 
scheduler was Leslie Groff, one of Epstein's assistants, who worked at an office off-site from the 
E stein's mansion in New York (the "New York Residence"). In Florida. the primary contact was 
who began working as Epstein's travelin assistant in 
; another contact for 
sc 
ing for certain Florida victims was 
during her employment as another 
traveling assistant to Epstein 
. Gro 
oes not appear to have ever been present 
when victims arrived for massages in New York:  
both were regularly present at 
Epstein's Florida estate (the "Florida Residence") when girls amved, and they would sometimes 
escort the girls to Epstein's massage room there. 
In order to maintain a steady stream of underage girls to perform sexual acts, Epstein 
also directed many of his victims to recruit other girls to engage in massages, including as 
conveyed through his assistants. Some victims brought just one or two friends, while others 
become prolific recruiters, bringing Epstein dozens of other girls. Epstein typically paid the 
recruiters hundreds of dollars for each girl they brought tilein's 
residences, and those 
payments also were sometimes made by employees including 
and 
.
While our Office's charges against Epstein principally focused on conduct occurring 
in New York or with connections to New York—and 
did contact victims for schedulin 
purposes while she was physiairiesent in Manhattan— e investigation as it related to 
largely focuses on Florida. 
was primarily responsible for scheduling at the F on 
Residence, where she also sometimes met and/or paid certain minor victims.
