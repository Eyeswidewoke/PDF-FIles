You still need to update us on the $73.53 but the $358.74 were valid personal charges that you were 
responsible for paying directly to Amex. 
432.27 
Personal Itemized Expense - Includes $358.74 in valid personal charges that you needed to pay to 
Amex. $73.53 was in dispute by you but you didn't get back to me 
As previously stated I can't approve late/delinquency fees this is a Global DB Policy that employees 
must pay directly to Amex. As you can see your late fees go back to 2013 and they were not paid which 
creates a domino effect of back to back late fees throughout the years. Even when reports are paid they 
are applied to previous charges including those late fees which were never paid. 
MORRIS CLEAN UP 2013-2014: 
• 
Morris Clean Up 2013-2014 — Report Total $495.90 (Paid 06/02/2016) - DB Paid Paul $452.52 
(You needs to pay directly to Amex) along with your own personal charges on that report for $43.38. -
THIS LEAVES YOU ALSO OWING $874.90 IN LATE FEE AND DELINQUENCY CHARGES TO AMEX FOR 
CHARGES FROM 2013-2014. 
Please confirm that you paid Amex $452.52 for DB Payment to you and confirm that you paid $43.38 
as well for your personal charges on this report. You're also responsible for paying the late fees from 
that time period totaling $874.90 
The $41.38 was marked as personal on the Morris Clean Up 2013-2014 report and is included in figure I 
provided above for $43.38 in personal expenses. 
The $57.00 was not submitted at all you were supposed to check with Compliance on this to see if you 
entered this in Compliance System back in 2013 as you can't submit a business gift request without the 
Compliance Pre-Approval #. You never got back to me on that so this is still considered as personal 
expense from my end for you to pay directly to Amex.

if this was entered into 
Compliance in 2013.

MORRIS CLEAN UP 2015: 
• 
Morris Clean Up 2015 - Total $556.90 (Approved 06/22/2016) — DB to pay Paul $553.89 (You 
need to pay directly to Amex) along with your own personal charges on that report for $2.20. 
THIS LEAVES YOU ALSO OWING $78.50 IN LATE FEE AND $152.80 (screen shot below) that should be 
personal but you had issues with and would get back to me. 
The $27.90 not processed as you were going to check with Ian to see if he was OK with you submitting 
as this expense type requires pre-approval. You stated that if that was not worked out you would pay. 
The $125.00 you weren't sure what this was at all. You stated you would pay as personal.
