First I want to express my gratefulness for remarks you've gave it to me. I work hard to break the ice I've lived 
in and danced in...I do admit, it is not easy...I have to think about completely different style and motions they 
teach me in the conservatoire and in the same time dance as a wind! "Open" as you told! I am trying to move 
widely with my look up! oh, Dear Jeffrey, I have so much to do in the class and in my life! I am so appreciate 
that you guiding me on my journey. 
As you know I didn't know exactly where I was going, but the conservatoire seems much better as we 
thought... that place is the second school after opera de Paris school! The masters of dance are very famous 
dancers. 
I am just very lucky! I have the best chance to learn from the bests! the moment when I get the opportunity to 
make some pictures I will send to you right the way! The studios are huge, beautiful! Jeffrey in the ballet class 
they play piano and violin! Alive music! That's so wonderful... so I attend ballet, Alterie, Contemporary, 
repertoire classes...it is exact school I needed to be at that moment. 
Recently 1 feel weak...there are almost tree weeks I have a flue. its my fault, because I don't eat enough food 
which helps my body to be strong. But that's the student life! To buy at bargain...But today I went in the 
pharmacy to get some vitamins otherwise people won't stop asking what's wrong with me! Feels like I've used 
all the energy I had! Honestly I look ugly like never before! I think is also tension. anxiety...Definitely I 
couldn't avoid maladies...my packed which I sent fron 
with all the things I needed, was 
picked and just taken. I was so upset...I am missing my new point s oes, oney, new boots. tempox
unbelievable! who needs tetnpox! )and many other things which I bought... I know it is just the things, but 
still...I paid for that... how people can take something what do not belong to them! I claim for 
compensation...i wrote a letter telling what I am missing, but I haven't got the answer yet from a company 
which was responsible for my package. 
The other worry was my family.. 
.i was worried a lot...then 
'woke 
uo' Valdas got crazy... all the dramas came a long my way! I've just realized is enough to go deep into 
relationships till I know what I want to do! Men always come and leave...first me. then relationship! I amok 
to have someone who calls inc, dates me, but nothing serious, I am so tired of thinking about relationship! I 
need more freedom and independents! 
At the moment I am looking for French course I could attend...but the once I've found seems not for my 
pocket...I am planning to stay in
 for a second semester. I am not sure yet if it's possible...I will see! If I 
am able to stay I have to work! Surely, is very important to me be involved in French course. Pity, that my 
conservatoire do not provide French courses for the forage students. 
Last weekend I was in Geneva! One more time I realized that is the place I would love to live and work! I 
d with=at her beautiful house (if you are interested to know who she is. then google 
Wonderful Woman! My second Mum! It was like a therapy for me spend sometime with
