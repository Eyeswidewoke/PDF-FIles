2. We can adopt your suggestion, le=ving you in charge, in which case you will ensure that the entire Trust wi=l 
go to you. To repeat the very simple logic, a few years ago, befor= I found out about it, my IRA was being very seriously 
depleted. Hal= of the mandatory withdrawal was being distributed to family, the other ha=f was being used to pay 
management fees and taxes for the entire estate.=C24, Therefore, in order to pay Alex's medical bills and expenses 
for=Wellfleet, I had to make extra withdrawals with an onerous tax payment.4>=A0 And since I also needed something 
to live on, I had to make still more =ithdrawals, with even further onerous tax payments. At that point I =sked Max to 
release some funds from the marital trust for tax relief.40=A0 You refused, demanding an intrusive and insulting 
financial accounting =hat no one with a shred of dignity would accept -- particularly under thes= remarkable 
circumstances. It follows that any request without such =ery clear justification will also be refused. So you can be 
assured =f receiving the entire Trust. I also suggested an improvement: you c=n take all of it right now and we can 
dissolve the Trust. 
3. We can p=rsue my suggestion: divide the Trust right now and dissolve it. To r=peat, there are some arcane 
tax issues, but can easily be resolved,=as your lawyer can explain to you, with common consent among the beneficia=ies 
-- which means your consent. 
4. I will repeat: "I could pursue legal measures to have the trust used in the manner i= which it was intended. I 
could also look into the disbursements tha= have been made to family members (so I have learned) without informing 
me= and could look into why I haven't been receiving any income from the =rust for years (until I finally raised the 
question), and why investments =ere made the way they were done, yielding long-term returns that would be =f no use 
for me, highly irregular for an elderly person -- which, as I wro=e you, greatly surprised financial advisers I consulted 
when I finally beg=n to pay attention. And, furthermore, why I never received any state=ents about what was going on 
for years, until I finally asked what is goin= on with the trust. And perhaps other matters that evidently concern=you, as 
shown by your request for protection for past actions. =/span>But I haven't yet shifted to your doma=n and still retain 
some illusions about family relations." 
These appear to be t=e options. I hope we can settle this quickly. As I have repeat=dly explained with no 
response, I cannot expect what my father was able to=enjoy, but at least I would like to end this particular horror as 
quickly =s possible. 
Earlier letter below. 
</=iv> 
C240 
As usual, you ignored everything I wrote and and are =ursuing your own agenda. But this letter is nevertheless 
very helpfu=. I've been asking you repeatedly to clear the air and say exact=y what you want instead of evading it in one 
way or another, and this does=come close to that. It also finally explains clearly what I did not =ant to believe about 
your refusing my request for some funds for taxes a f=w years ago 
You no doubt recall the circumstances. Unknown to me, my=financial advisers had arranged to rapidly deplete 
my main source of suppo=t, my IRA, by distributing half of the mandatory withdrawal to family memb=rs and to use the 
rest for paying management fees and taxes for the entire=estate. That meant that when I paid Alex's expenses, I had to 
wi=hdraw over the limit, with exorbitant taxes. Same with any other funds for=any family matters, and with Wellfleet
