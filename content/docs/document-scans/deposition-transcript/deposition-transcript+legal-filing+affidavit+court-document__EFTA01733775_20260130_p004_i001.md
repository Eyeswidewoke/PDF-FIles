account from the Fund. I again urged Epstein not to put this demand in writing. Epstein 
told me that he was going to consult with Dubin. 
15. 
After the call, I talked to Dubin numerous times about what to do about FTC's demand to 
withdraw FTC's capital account from the Fund. As a principal in the Fund's general 
partner (DBZ Partners) and its investment manager (DBZCO), Dubin had previously been 
made aware of the accounting irregularities that had been uncovered and, in fact, was 
present when the Fund's counsel advised me to refer to them as "nonmaterial" when 
discussing them with investors. 
16. 
Dubin and I were both concerned that in order to meet FTC's withdrawal demand and pay 
FTC the substantial value of its capital account, the Fund would have to sell illiquid assets 
at potentially distressed prices, which would force us to mark down similar investments 
held by the Offshore Fund and the Managed Accounts. At that time, FTC's capital 
account was valued at between $135 million and $140 million. On the March 31, 2007 
effective date of FTC's withdrawal, FTC's capital account was valued at not less than 
$140 million. 
17. 
Moreover, at the time that Epstein made FTC's withdrawal demand, DBZCO was in the 
process of liquidating our largest Managed Account, initially consisting of approximately 
$500 million of assets, which DBZCO managed for Dubin's firm, HCM (the "Highbridge 
Account"). Obviously, any effort to liquidate the Fund's assets to pay FTC would make it 
harder to liquidate the Highbridge Account and distribute the proceeds to HCM. I do not 
know if Epstein ever knew about the Highbridge Account being liquidated 
18. 
Dubin made it clear to me that Epstein was not bluffing or posturing. However, Dubin 
believed that he could use his long-standing personal and business relationship with 
Epstein to at least reduce FTC's withdrawal demand. 
19. 
On November 13, 2006, Dubin and I held a telephone conference with Epstein to discuss 
his demand for FTC's complete withdrawal from the Fund. During the telephone 
conference, Epstein once again reiterated his demand to withdraw FTC's entire capital 
account and, in light of the January II, 2005 Letter Agreement, I did not dispute that he 
had the right to do so. However, I explained to Epstein that such a withdrawal could 
cause a "run on the bank". I told him that I feared once word eventually got out that 
Epstein withdrew FTC's capital account, other investors would follow suit. Dubin also 
urged Epstein to consider what I was saying and work with me to address this concern. 
Because I believed, based on my discussions with Dubin, that Epstein could not be talked 
out of a withdrawal, I asked Epstein, for the time being, to reduce the amount that FTC 
already demanded to withdraw. I asked him to cut it in half. Both Dubin and I assured 
Epstein that balance of FTC's capital account was not in any jeopardy and would remain 
secure. 
20. 
In response, Epstein said that, for now, he would agree to reduce the amount of FTC's 
withdrawal to $80 million—the amount of initial capital he invested—if the Fund would 
agree to honor the request immediately, as opposed to waiting until the March 31, 2007 
withdrawal date.
