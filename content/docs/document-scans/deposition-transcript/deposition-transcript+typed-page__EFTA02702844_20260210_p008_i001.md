ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLES 
The following scenario analysis and examples are provided for illustrative purposes only and are hypothetical. They do not purport to be 
representative of every possible scenario concerning increases or decreases in 3-Month LIBOR and we cannot predict 3-Month LIBOR 
on any Coupon Determination Date. You should not take the scenario analysis and these examples as an indication or assurance of the 
expected performance of 3-Month LIBOR. The numbers set forth in the examples below have been rounded for ease of analysis. The 
following scenario analysis and examples illustrate the Coupon determination during the Floating Rate Payment Period for a $1,000.00 
Principal Amount of Notes, assume that there are 90 days in each quarterly period and reflect the Cap of 4.00% per annum, the 
Minimum Coupon Rate of 0.00% per annum and the Spread. On each Coupon Payment Date during the Fixed Rate Payment Period, 
you will receive a Coupon at a Coupon Rate of 2.25% per annum, or in the amount of $2.25 per $1,000 in Principal Amount.

Example 1: On a Coupon Determination Date, 3-Month LIBOR is equal to 2.00%. Because 3-Month LIBOR plus 1.05% is 3.05% 
per annum, which is less than the Cap, the Coupon Rate for such Coupon Payment Date during the Floating Rate Payment Period is 
3.05% per annum and the Coupon payment on the relevant Coupon Payment Date during the Floating Rate Payment Period would be 
$7.625 per $1,000 in Principal Amount calculated as follows: 
1,000 x Coupon Rate x 90/360 
= $1,000 x 3.05% x 90/360 
= $7.625 
Example 2: On a Coupon Determination Date, 3-Month LIBOR is equal to 6.00%. Because 3-Month LIBOR plus 1.05% is 7.05% 
per annum, which is greater than the Cap, the Coupon Rate for such Coupon Payment Date during the Floating Rate Payment Period is 
equal to the Cap of 4.00% per annum and the Coupon payment on the relevant Coupon Payment Date during the Floating Rate 
Payment Period would be $10.000 per $1,000 in Principal Amount, the maximum quarterly payment on the Notes, calculated as follows: 
1,000 it Coupon Rate x 90/360 
= $1,000 x 4.00% x 90/360 
= $10.000 
Example 3: On a Coupon Determination Date, 3-Month LIBOR is equal to -5.00%. Because 3-Month LIBOR plus 1.05% is -3.95% 
per annum, which is less than the Minimum Coupon Rate, the Coupon Rate for such Coupon Payment Date during the Floating Rate 
Payment Period is equal to the Minimum Coupon Rate of 0.00% per annum and the Coupon payment on the relevant Coupon Payment 
Date during the Floating Rate Payment Period would be $0.000 per $1,000 in Principal Amount, the minimum payment on the Notes, 
calculated as follows: 
1,000 it Coupon Rate x 90/360 
= $1,000 x 0.00% x 90/360 
= $0.000
