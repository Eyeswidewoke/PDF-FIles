Thanks Angela.

I applaud all three of you for your effort throughout the year, but especially in the last few weeks. From outreach, 
trainings both received and provided, and the very difficult case work, and sometimes the difficult folks you have 
to interact with, you have all been busy and giving it 110% day in and day out. Thanks for continually pushing 
the NY VSD mission forward.

Background: A 21-year-old Pakistan-American woman was assaulted with acid to her face and hands in a 
targeted attack outside her home in March 2021. The case initially started with the Nassau PD and is now being 
investigated as a possible hate crime at the federal level. 
Update: VS Riso and the case agent met with the victim, now 22 years old, and her mother. Victim has extensive 
skin damage to her face, eye, and wrists and is set to undergo numerous surgeries. VS Riso provided victim 
compensation overview, a case status update, interview accompaniment, and will continue to support the family. 
September 22nd VS May assisted with a recovered 14 year old minor who was transported from Ohio to New 
York by an adult subject for the purposes of sexual exploitation and child pornography. VS May assisted with the 
transportation of the minor to two sperate hospitals to facilitate comprehensive medical exams and SANE 
examination. VS May coordinated the CPS response due to the complexity of the relationship with the recovered 
minor and his guardians and the suicidal ideation of the minor. VS May coordinated the psychiatric evaluation of 
the minor so the minor could be stabilized so a time sensitive forensic interview could take place. VS secured an 
area in the hospital and coordinated with a CAFI to provide an appropriate space for the interview. VS May 
advocated with CPS executive management to take custody even though they initially refused, choosing to 
instead to send minor back to guardians who were alleged to have abused the minor. As a result of all of this, 
CPS eventually took custody of the minor and VS May was able to secure safe and comfortable housing for the 
minor. Vs May followed up with the minor the following morning and the minor expressed appreciation for the 
temporary placement and looks forward to longer stabilized placement and resources.
