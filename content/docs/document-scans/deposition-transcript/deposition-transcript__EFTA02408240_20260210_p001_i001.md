Report # 131: Car accident 
Hey all! 
HR had a farewell party for a departing colleague. The departing lady sat with her nipple hanging 
out from her lowcut top! Good thing it was her farewell party so she doesn't have to face anyone 
after that embarrassment! 
I've been good for a while now and then I got a speeding ticket! It was the morning when I was 
driving to Dar Al Masyaf. It tells me that I should stick to my rental Mitsubishi and not by the 
BMW coupe I want... 
My colleague told me to use the windshield spray if a car behind me was too close. Doing this 
means f*** you in driving language. Consequently, I filled up my car with lots of water and 
windshield cleaner and started spraying away on the freeway. It really works! The van behind me 
started frenetically wiping the windshield and backed off. 
I had a car accident. I was hit from behind by a local guy. After that arrogant bastard hit me he 
stopped behind me and smoked in his car waiting for me to approach him. Arabs l0000ves to take 
their good old time, however I'm on vacation and was in no hurry. I started calling the police. 
Finally he had to come to my car because he was in a bad hurry. He said he would just give me a 
business card. I took a picture of his registration plate. He ran after me to my car, reached inside 
my car and snatched his business card and took off! 
First the police told me to come to the Khalidiya police station. So I went there,but nobody 
wanted to help me because it's the weekend. So I had to call 999 to send a patrol car to the police 
station to take a police report! I mean, guys, come on...! What's wrong w/ this picture...? 
However, it's amazing how efficient the police is when they want to: I get impatient easily so I 
kept calling 999 because the atrol car didn't get there fast enough. After a couple of phone calls 
they answered with: Miss 
working at New York University... They found that info 
out in a matter of minutes only based on my mobile nil 
It took about 30 seconds to find the mobile number of the guy who hit me and another 15 min for 
him to get his fat local a° to the police station. I wanted to tell him some well chosen nasty, 
condescending, threating words to him, but the fact that he's a local (law will always be on his 
side) and that I'm a woman, not to mention police officers as witnesses, I refrained from 
threatening to take his eyeballs out with my carkeys. 
Since my car rental co is familiar with my driving record by now, they gave me an SUV as a 
replacement car... Not good for the safety of others, but good for me especially since I'm driving 
to Dubai tomorrow. 
Stay safe!
