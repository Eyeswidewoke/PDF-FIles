traction, knowing there would be a tax increase. Coming up with his very poorly named Plan B, you 
know? I think maybe some of his members rejected it because they thought they didn't want an over-the-
counter drug here. 
But it was, give me some traction. I'd propose a million dollars as the level here, and then we can 
negotiate. And some of his members were ready to support him, just to give him that traction. The Club 
for Growth. Heritage Action step up and basically said, you members, you lift your heads out of that 
foxhole and support any tax increase, and you've got a target on your backs and millions of dollars in a 
primary against you. 
Some of this is coming from the kinds of people who we're electing to office, through a nominating 
process that has gotten so skewed to the radical right. But some of it is an electoral magnet that pulls 
them away from voting for anything that might have a patina of bipartisan support because they'll face 
extinction. 
THOMAS MANN: Bill, this is such an important point. Nowadays, political parties are not organizations, 
they're networks. We talk sometimes about parties versus outside groups. No, no, no. The outside groups 
are part of the political parties, and so too are the media outlets. The large funders. It's a broad system. 
Super PACs don't exist as independent forces. They in fact are run by former party operatives and 
leaders of one kind or another. 
And right now, you have a conjunction of forces that you can see in the conservative media, in the 
funding organizations, and in the Grover Norquist and the Koch brothers. And it all comes together to 
provide such overwhelming pressure on individual Republicans to toe the line, to oppose even when they 
want to engage in problem solving. 
BILL MOVERS: So when you mention The Club for Growth, you're talking about essentially Wall Street 
finance group of private citizens who will take on a Republican in the primary to defeat him if he doesn't 
toe the line on what the financial interests want? 
NORMAN ORNSTEIN: And these are financial interests who don't just focus on financial interests. Many 
of them are themselves radical either libertarians or who have a very strong ideology. And so The Club 
for Growth will intervene not just on tax issues, but on others. And they're joined by other groups. You 
know, when Jim DeMint left the Senate 
BILL MOVERS: To head The Heritage... 
NORMAN ORNSTEIN: Head the Heritage Foundation, you know... 
BILL MOVERS: Right. A very conservative organization. 
NORMAN ORNSTEIN: Which used to be a think tank. Now, of course, it has a 501(c)4 called Heritage 
Action. They're raising money. They're aggressively participating in the political debates, and will in 
campaigns. Because you can have as much impact as Tom said, it's all part of a party apparatus now. 
From the outside, if you use the leverage of money, and you can also use the leverage of the social 
media, the talk radio hosts, and others, who have such a dominant impact on the party now, that it takes 
the problem solvers and puts them in a really, really tricky situation. 
BILL MOVERS: You say, in the book, that what we all know: President Obama made great efforts to work 
cooperatively with the Republicans during his first term. Didn't get him anything in terms of legislation: got 
him maybe a second term. But in The New York Times this week. Michael Shear and Peter Baker say, 
call him, "A president who hesitates to twist arms." Can you not be president without twisting arms? 
THOMAS MANN: Oh, I think that's a myth. 
BILL MOYERS: Do you?
