non-tendering Mobileye shareholders in accordance with Section 2:92a or Section 2:201a of the Dutch Civil 
Code (the "DM"). In the Compulsory Acquisition proceeding. while we will request that the per Share price 
paid in the Compulsory Acquisition be equal to the Offer Consideration, the Dutch Court has sole discretion to 
determine the per Share price, which may be greater than, equal to or less than the Offer Consideration, with such 
price potentially being increased by Dutch Statutory Interest. The non-tendering Mobileye shareholders do not 
have the right to commence a Compulsory Acquisition proceeding to oblige us to buy their Shares. 
See Section 17 —"Appraisal Rights."
