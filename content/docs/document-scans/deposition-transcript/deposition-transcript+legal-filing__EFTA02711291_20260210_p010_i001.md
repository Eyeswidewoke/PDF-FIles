The mass. The human mass. The impossible agglomerate mass. The incommunicable human mass. The people. ficeFrom their 
places masses move, stark as laws. Masses of what? One does not ask. There somewhere man is too, vast conglomerate of all 
of natureaTMs kingdoms, as lonely and as bound:az' The impossible people. 
The mass is nothing: the people arenfiTmt. ItaTMs the human that is alien. Man is dead: the men have no shadows. ficeA man is 
a result, a demonstration.fin An unreal realization. 
I am out of my mind. Beyond the I to something else. A place of nothing else and no beyond. I am out of my mind. Deprived 
even of my I. The I which becomes merely a more immediate object in the wasteland of objects. And ficethe role of objects is 
to restore silence, for objects are no more real than the words that are their habit4" I am out of my mind: am I words in the 
midst of words or silence in the midst of silence. 
The narrator is gone. The universe as a narrative story isnaTMt there. Evolution as a narrative story never happened: words 
are what matter. Evolution is a matter of the words used to describe it. There is no continuous, infinite, evolving world-
universe-nature-knowledge waiting to be explained by man. ItaTMs a word of words: a nature created in what it says. 
The universe isnaTMt there. Man is dead. But ficeI can find no way of escape from what is not! Speech so fills us, fills 
everything with its images that we cannot think how to begin to refrain from imaginingrnothing is without it . . . Remember 
that tomorrow is a myth, that the universe is one; that numbers, love, the real and the infinite . . . that justice, the people, 
poetry . . . the earth itself are myths.a" The universe isnaTMt there. It is. 
DonaTMt believe any of this. Place no value in the book, in the author. ficePrivate authorship or ownership is not to be 
respected. It is all one bookie Give it up, the idea of an author, of truth. Give up all belief believe only in yourself. You: 
your experience is my experience. Me: aceitirms of me now that I must speak, even if I have to do it with their language.r 
Them: ficel slip into them . . . it is a stratum, strata, without debris or vestiges. But itaTMs a world filled with debris and 
vestiges: before I am done I shall find traces of what was.fi" What was: is me, acenever anyone but me talking to me of me, in 
words, made of words, otheraTMs words, what others . . . the whole world is here with met' Me: I (Iona-nit. I donirmt 
believe any of this. 
I canaTMt think of one anymore. This or that: I canaTMt differentiate anymore. I donaTMt believe it: I canaTMt think, ficeI must 
not try to think, simply utter.fi Saying makes it so. This, this and that: acel shall have to banish them in the end, the beings, 
shapes, sounds, and lights with which my haste to speak has encumbered this place.fil" 
The necessity of stopping before starting. The necessity to forget it all. 
Nobody knows, and you canaTMt find out.
