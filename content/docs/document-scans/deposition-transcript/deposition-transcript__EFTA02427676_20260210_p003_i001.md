and stating that Agri - which was "the largest kosher meat production company in the country" --
wished to cooperate with ICE and avoid the dangers and disruption of a raid. Kent's requests were 
summarily denied and the raid took place. 
Approximately 600 federal agents in heavy riot gear stormed the Agri plant on May 12, 
supported by Blackhawk military helicopters. A total of 389 illegal immigrants were arrested and 
entered guilty pleas in production-line fashion after being told that they could be charged with a 
major federal criminal felony that the Supreme Court held in 2009 (Flores-Figueroa v. United 
States, 129 S. Ct. 1886) was inapplicable to their situations. The Department of Homeland Security 
reversed ICE's raid policy and, since an announcement made on April 30, 2009, will conduct raids 
only in extremely limited circumstances. 
The May 2008 raid received national publicity and ultimately resulted in the bankruptcy of 
Agri. It demolished Postville's economic infrastructure, destroyed a legitimate business that was the 
town's major employer, wiped out livelihoods of both legal and illegal employees, forced businesses 
to shut down, and drove away residents. Postville's populationhas shrunk by half, and many of those 
who remain are unable to sell their homes. The town is nearly insolvent. And the raid also 
demolished the 
principal source of kosher beef and poultry in the United States, creating kosher meat shortages 
across the country. 
2. Was the Post-Raid Treatment of Rubashkin Comparable to Other ICE Raid Targets? 
(a) Swift & Co. - Although Swift was a major employer of illegal workers in six states and 
1,297 illegal employees were found on those premises in the December 2006 raids, neither the 
company nor any of its officials were criminally charged. In Iowa, for example, one United Food and 
Commercial Workers ("UFCW") official at Swift's Marshalltown, Iowa, plant was charged in an Iowa 
federal court with harboring illegal immigrants and was sentenced to one year and one day in prison 
and a $2000 fine after being found guilty by a jury. Another Swift employee who had pleaded guilty 
was sentenced to probation. 
(b) Michael Bianco, Inc. ("MBI") - A manufacturer of leather goods and handbags in New 
Bedford, Mass. was raided by ICE on March 6, 2007, after an undercover operation from which it 
was learned hat Francesco Insolia, the owner, intentionally sought out illegal immigrants and 
exploited them with punitive fines and terrible working conditions. Approximately 326 illegal workers 
were detained in the raid. Insolia was sentenced in January 2009 to one year and one day in prison 
and fined $30,000. The company was fined $1.51 million and ordered to pay $460,000 in restitution. 
(c) Action Rags USA - A Houston, Texas clothing and rag exporter company was raided by 
ICE on June 25, 2008 - little more than a month after the Agri raid. Approximately 85% of the 
business' workforce consisted of illegal Mexican immigrants, and approximately 150 immigrants 
were arrested. The owner, Mubarik Kahlon, and two managers were indicted on immigration 
charges in July 2008. A jury trial was set for June 15, 2009, but on June 10, Kahlon and one 
manager pleaded guilty. Kahlon was sentenced to two years' probation and a $6,000 fine. 
(d) Miyako Sushi and Panda China Buffets - ICE raided these restaurants in Ocean City, 
Maryland in June 2007, on evidence that illegal workers were hired as below-minimum-wage 
employees (paid in cash) in the restaurants and were provided living accommodations in 
condominiums owned by the restaurant owners, Bo Hao Zhu and Siu Ping Cheng. The owners 
pleaded guilty to immigration-law violations and were sentenced on September 12, 2008, to 18 
months' probation. Their partnership was ordered to pay a $50,000 fine. 
(e) Rosenbaum-Cunningham International, Inc. ("RCI") - On February 22, 2007, ICE raided 
63 locations in 17 states of a national janitorial service that provided cleaning crews for restaurants. 
Almost all RCI janitorial employees were illegal immigrants who had no documentation whatever, 
and they were paid in cash. The owners, Richard M. Rosenbaum, Edward Scott Cunningham, and 
Christina A. Flocken were charged not only with immigration-law violations, but also with defrauding 
the United States of more than $18 million in federal employment taxes. On March 4, 2008, 
Rosenbaum was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment, Cunningham to 51 months, and Flocken to 
30 months. 
The cases described above are typical. No case following an ICE raid has even come 
remotely close to the draconian threats and punishments imposed on Mr. Rubashkin.
