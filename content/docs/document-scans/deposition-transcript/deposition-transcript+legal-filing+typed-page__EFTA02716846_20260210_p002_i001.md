From 20=9 to 2012 The Top 1% captured 95% of the increase of national income. In other words The Top 1% 
incomes grew by 31.4% while The Bottom 99% incomes grew by 0.4%. 
In his book, Smith says that the Congress of 1978 was the watershed, first by the passing of the 401K legislation, as a 
favor for the executives of Kodak and Xerox because they wanted a new tax shelter for deferred compensation. And 
that it was never intended to be a retirement plan for the mass of Americans.40=A0 And the other major sea change was 
the change of culture in business. Prior to then there were a number of populist movements on the 1960s and 1970s 
representing the sentiments of the middle-class that were co-opted by lobbyist in Washington=on behalf of business 
interest. In 1970 there were 170 businesses in America that had lobbying offices in Washingto=. A decade later there 
were 2025. In 1971 there was no Business Roundtable which today is the most potent political f=rce for Blue Chip 
Businesses in America. By the 95th Congress in 1978 there were 130 registered lobbyist for every memb=r of Congress. 
Corporate lobbyist shifted power away from the populist movements in favor or corporate interest using=Wedge-
Economics. 
=p class="MsoNormal">During this same period the notion of stakeholder cap=talism changed to shareholder 
capitalism. The stakeholder capital notion was, if y=u took care of your workers and paid them well, this not only 
benefited the workers and corporation it benefited the whole economy, which economist lab=led the Virtuous Circle of 
Growth. The essence is that well-paid workers would spend creating consumer demand and = strong economy with 
businesses expanding production, building new plants, buying n=w equipment, hiring more workers to meet increasing 
demand and power the next cycle of growth. 
And this is essentially what happened through the 40s, 50=, 60s, and 70s. This changed with the change in business 
ethos "we=are going to cut back to increase profits." The productivity of American workers rose 97% for the mid-40s 
though the mid-70s and their incomes rose =5%. After that one continued to rise while the other went flat. And the one 
that went flat was the wages and salaries of workers since 1973 while productivity continue to grow to 80% by 2011. 
During this period the average hourly wage grew only 4.2% and corporate profits ri=ing on average by 13% a year, 
resulting with the Middle Class being cut out of =he growth and profitability of American Enterprise. This was the result 
of Wedge-Economics. 
And if this was not enough, there was The Great Burden Shi=t. In 1980 84% of workers in companies of more than 100 
employees had a life-time pension. When they retired their employe= guaranteed them a monthly paycheck as long as 
they lived. Today that =umber is 35%. In 1980 more than 70% of workers in companies of more than 100 employees 
had fully paid health benefits. Today that numbe= if 18%. In 1980 corporations paid 89% of health cost of employees by 
2010 that number had dropped to 49% and the percent th=t employees were paying rose for 11% to 51%. This is The 
Burden Shift. Hundreds of billions of dolla=s a year in costs have been shifted from the corporations to employees at a 
time when w=ges have been flat. The U.S. Census Bureau said that the median wage adjusted for inflation for a male 
worker is lower=today than it was in 1978, while inflation has gone up and cost are going up. Thi= shift has devastated 
the Middle Class as they now have to use more of their incomes to cover these benefits that are no longer being covered 
by corporations. And with less disposable income the economy has stagnated economically.
