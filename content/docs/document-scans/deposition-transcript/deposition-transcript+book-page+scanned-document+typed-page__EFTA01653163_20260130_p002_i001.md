Nation Sunday, 'The President could come right before the 
committee and speak all the truth that he wants if he wants to 
take the oath of office...or he can do it in writing. He has every 
opportunity to present his case." 
Norah O'Donnell said on the CBS Evening News 
(11/18, story 3, 1:30, 4.62M) that Trump "surprised his own 
White House staff' with the tweet. Bloomberg (11/18, 4.73M) 
says Trump's tweet "contrasts with his defiant approach to 
the impeachment inquiry thus far," and The Hill (11/18, 
Samuels, 2.98M) that it comes "despite his repeated refusal 
to cooperate with the investigation thus far." USA Today 
(11/18, Jackson, 10.31M) reports, "Some legal analysts 
expressed skepticism about Trump's sincerity." 
Lester Holt said on NBC Nightly News (11/18, story 4, 
0:50, 6.22M) that "there are questions if it would really 
happen," and Jim Acosta said on CNN's Situation Room 
(11/18, 838K), "Democratic aides at this point say they are 
not taking" Trump's comments "very seriously." Similarly, on 
ABC World News Tonight (11118, story 4, 2:50, Muir, 6.97M), 
Mary Bruce also said Trump's testifying "seems unlikely." 
Likewise, Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA) said on CNN's 
Situation Room (11118, 838K), "He hasn't turned over his 
taxes despite saying for years that he would do that. He didn't 
show up in person with Bob Mueller despite saying he would 
do that. He sent written answers, which hit looks like he may 
have falsified, to the Mueller team. But more than that, we 
would like him to just allow the witnesses we have 
subpoenaed to come to Congress and the documents we 
have subpoenaed to be provided to the committee. So, he's 
not serious in this process and I don't think it's worth our time 
engaging with him on this other than to say we have a lot of 
evidence right now and we shouldn't allow him to dictate the 
terms for this investigation." 
Politico (11/18, Marshall, 4.29M) says that if Trump 
"were to submit a written statement rather than appearing in 
person, he would avoid live questioning that could put him in 
danger of accidentally perjuring himself." However, "his 
answers would still be considered under oath." The AP 
(11/18, Miller) says Trump "provided written answers to 
questions from special counsel Robert Mueller during his 
probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election." But, 
Mueller "found many of Trump's answers in the Russia probe 
less than satisfying." 
House Investigators Looking Into Whether Trump 
Lied In Written Answers To Mueller. The New York Times 
(11/18, Savage, 18.61M) reports that Douglas Letter, the 
general counsel for the House, told a federal appeals court 
Monday that House impeachment investigators are "exploring 
whether President Trump lied in his written answers- to then-
Special Counsel Robert Mueller, thereby "raising the prospect 
of bringing an additional basis for a Senate trial over whether 
to remove- Trump from office. Letter "told a federal appeals 
court panel that impeachment investigators have an 
'immense' need to swiftly see the grand jury evidence — 
redacted portions of the Mueller report, as well as the 
underlying testimony transcripts they came from." 
The Washington Post (11/18, Marimow, Hsu, 14.2M) 
reports that Letter's "request followed closely on the heels of 
Friday's conviction of longtime Trump friend Roger Stone." 
According to the Post, "Testimony and evidence at his trial 
appeared to cast doubt on written replies from Trump to 
Mueller about the president's knowledge about attempts by 
his 2016 campaign to learn more about the release of hacked 
Democratic emails by the anti-secrecy group WildLeaks." 
Reuters (11/18, Wolfe) says that during Stone's trial, 
Rick Gates, Trump's former deputy campaign chairman, 
"suggested in testimony during a jury trial in a criminal case 
that Trump talked to...Stone about WikiLeaks during the 2016 
campaign." According to Reuters, 
Gates' 
testimony 
"appeared to conflict with sworn written statements that 
Trump gave Mueller." Mueller wrote to Mueller, "I do not recall 
discussing WikiLeaks with [Stone]. Nor do I recall being 
aware of Mr. Stone having discussed WikiLeaks with 
individuals associated with my campaign." 
Pelosi Argues Leaving Trump's Fate To The 
Election Would Be "Dangerous." The Washington Post 
(11/18, Wagner, Shammas, 14.2M) reports that in a letter to 
House Democrats Monday, House Speaker Pelosi asserted 
that -the facts of the impeachment inquiry are 'uncontested,'" 
and that Trump "abused his power for his own personal, 
political benefit, at the expense of our national security 
interests." Pelosi "also argued that it would be "dangerous" to 
leave Trump's fate to next year's election because 'the 
President is jeopardizing the integrity of the 2020 elections."' 
ABC Poll: 70% Call Trump's Ukraine Actions 
'Wrong'; 51% Support Impeachment And Removal. ABC 
News (11/18, 2.97M) reports on its website that according to 
a new ABC NewslIpsos poll, "an overwhelming 70% of 
Americans think President Donald Trump's request to a 
foreign leader to investigate his political rival...was wrong," 
and 51 percent believe Trump "should be impeached and 
removed from office." Politico (11/18, Forgey, 4.29M) reports 
that "13 percent also deemed the president's push for foreign 
investigations of his rivals to be wrong, but believed he 
should neither be impeached nor convicted by Congress. A 
quarter of respondents, 25 percent, said Trump did nothing 
wrong." The New York Times (11/18, Stolberg, 18.61M) 
reports, "The survey found 58 percent of Americans are 
following the [impeachment] hearings closely or somewhat 
closely." 
Impeachment Inquiry To Hear From Officials Who 
Were On Trump-Zelensky Call. Mary Bruce reported on 
ABC World News Tonight (11/18, story 4, 2:50, Muir, 6.97M) 
that Congress on Tuesday will 'bear from three officials who 
were on that call between Trump and the Ukrainian 
President. Jennifer Williams, a special adviser to the Vice 
President, called it 'unusual and inappropriate,- and Lt. Col. 
Alexander Vindman, who told investigators, "I did not think it
