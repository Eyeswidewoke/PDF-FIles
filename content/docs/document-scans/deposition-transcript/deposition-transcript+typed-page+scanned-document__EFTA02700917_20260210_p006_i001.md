On June 11, 1982, Roberto Calvi, the chairman of the Banco Ambrosiano, left Italy. He had with 
him a black briefcase that an assistant had seen him stuff with documents from his safe. The 
disappearance of "God's Banker," as he was known in the Italian media because of the massive 
investments he made for the Vatican, set in motion an international manhunt. One week later, his 
body was found hanging under Blackfriars Bridge in London with an orange noose tied around 
his neck and his feet submerged in the swirling waters of the Thames. The black bag was gone. 
Also missing was $1.2 billion from Banco Ambrosiano's subsidiaries in the Bahamas, 
Nicaragua, Peru, and Luxembourg. The Vatican bank was also missing one-half billion dollars 
from loans to letter-box corporations. 
When the London river police cut down the body from scaffolding under the bridge on the 
morning of June 19,1982, they did not know immediately it was the missing Italian banker. The 
Italian passport on the corpse identified him as "Gian Roberto Calvino." It was a bogus 
passport, it turned out, that he had used to get into Britain. The police ruled out robbery as 
"Calvino" still wore a very expensive Patek Phillippe watch on his wrist and had about $14,000 
in Swiss francs, British pounds and Italian Lire in his wallet. They also found seven large pieces 
of masonry stuffed in his pants. Even after he was identified, Scotland Yard, the Italian financial 
police, and Interpol, were totally baffled as to how this banker from Milan come to be dangling at 
the end of a rope over the Thames in London. Did he commit suicide? Or was he murdered? 
The autopsy was conducted by Professor Frederick Keith Simpson, one of England's most 
experienced pathologists. There was no river water in Calvi's lungs, so he had not drowned. The 
cause of death was asphyxia or loss of oxygen. There was a "V" shaped wound on his neck, 
consistent with suicide, and there was no marks on the arms to indicate he had been restrained, 
no puncture marks on his body to indicated he had been injected with a drug and no traces of 
suspicious chemicals in his stomach of drugs (other than the residue of a sleeping pill he had 
taken the previous night). In sort, there was no medical evidence of foul play. 
But before the authorities could declare the hanging a suicide, there was a problem. The time of 
the death was fixed by his Patek Phillippc watch, which through valued at ov31er $100,000, was 
not water-proof. It stopped at 1:52. While the watch could have stopped for reasons other than 
water damage, the water marks on the face of it, when taken together with the dropping level of 
the tide that night at Blackfriars Bridge, established the latest time at which his body could have 
been suspended from the scaffolding. After 2:30 am, the level of the water in the Thames at 
Blackfriars bridge would not have been high enough to have reached Calvi's wrist (as was 
calculated from the length of the rope he was hanging by when he was found), so he must have 
been hanging before then. But he could not have hanged himself before 1 a.m. because the river 
level then would have been above his mouth, and there was no river water in his body. So, if he 
committed suicide, it he could only have been between 1:00 and 2:30 a.m. Making the problem 
more vexing, during those hours there was a low tide, and the distance to the water would have 
broken his neck. Yet, the pathologist had determined that Calvi's neck had not suffered the kind 
of injury that would have occurred in such a free-fall. In fact, he could have not have dropped 
more than 2 feet before his fall was broken by the water. To get that near the water, after tying 
the rope, he would have had to climb twelve feet down a nearly vertical iron ladder, and he then, 
with seven pieces of masonry in his clothes, would have to step across the two and one-half feet 
gap onto the scaffolding's rusty poles, which were arranged like monkey-bars in a children's 
playground. Next he would have to tie the rope and shimmy down to the next level of the 
scaffolding in the darkness. Yet, the medical examination had found none of signs, including
