Our Strategic Differentiation 
The Landscape We Found 
Pet food in 2002 was an established industry dominated by large CPG companies. offering a variety of brands made primarily with 
ingredients such as poultry by-product meals. corn, wheat and soy. Based on our conversations with many pet parents, we found that the vast 
majority of them did not read pet food labels and were often unaware of the ingredients they were feeding their pets, even though they were seeking 
natural foods and products for themselves and their families. A number of small natural pet food brands began to emerge in the neighborhood pct 
stores, led by entrepreneurs who often did not have the funding to build sizable businesses. In parallel, the pet food retail landscape had evolved 
significantly with the expansion of national pet superstores. These superstores caned a broad assortment of pet products and foods, anchored by 
Engineered brands but did not participate in the emerging Wholesome Natural market segment in a meaningful way. 
The BLUE Disruption 
We set out to challenge the status quo set by the incumbent brands. We were convinced that the Wholesome Natural market segment 
could become a large part of the industry due to a large unmet consumer demand for pet food with high-quality, natural ingredients. We have 
established our leadership position in the Wholesome Natural market segment through the strength and quality of our products. by broadly sharing 
our message to encourage pet parents to read ingredient labels and by pricing our products at a reasonable premium to Engineered brands. This 
approach was in contrast to our major competitors whose business models were tied to the mass production of Engineered brands. 
We committed to creating wholesome pet food made with whole meats, fruits and vegetables and other high-quality, natural ingredients 
that we feel good about feeding our own furry family members and to educating fellow pet parents about pet nutrition. We further distinguished our 
products by creating a two-pan dry food, consisting of kibble and our trademarked LifeSource Bits that are cold-formed to help preserve the 
potency of vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. LifeSource Bits are more expensive and complex to manufacture, but we believe they provide 
significant benefits and create a visual point of differentiation when we talk to pet parents. We also combined advanced quality control and supply 
chain capabilities generally consistent with the standards required for human food industries with our deep expertise in pet foods. We believe these 
competitive advantages, together with our investments in our brand, have distinguished us from our smaller competitors in the Wholesome Natural 
market segment. 
We deploy our Pet Detectives, part-time pet-passionate team members, to help us fulfill our mission to educate fellow pet parents about 
pet nutrition. Pet Detectives interact with pet parents one-on-one as they shop for pet food in specialty stores nationwide and in Canada. Our Pet 
Detective program serves as an educational marketing and sales platform as it is a resource for both pet parents already feeding their pets BLUE 
and pet parents currently feeding their pets other pet food brands. The Pet Detectives allow us to engage pet parents with our brand story, our 
mission and our shared love for pets in an authentic manner. 
From the dynamics we saw in human foods, we knew that consumers were willing to pay a premium for natural products, and we were 
confident that pet parents would be open to paying a reasonable premium for ow natural products for their furry family members. Our price 
premium compared to Engineered brands varies. For example, virtually all pet parents feeding their medium-sized dog an Engineered brand can 
switch to BLUE for anywhere from no extra cost to 70 cents more per day. For a cat, they can switch to BLUE for anywhere from no extra cost to 
30 cents more per day. As we have grown, we have successfully switched pet parents from feeding their pets various brands across the full range of 
price points to feeding their pets BLUE, demonstrating our broad appeal and affordability to a large population of pet parents. 
We believe that our rapid creation of a brand with over a billion dollars of sales at retail is proof that our strategy is working.
