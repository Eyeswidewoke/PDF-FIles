Anthony v. United States. 520 F.3d 374.377 (5d1 Cir. 2008) (citing Treas. Reg. §20.2031.1(b)). 
B. Background 
Over the course of their marriage, the Texas-domiciled Decedent and his wife acquired property, both real and personal. essentially all of 
which fell into the community that existed between them and thus was owned equally by the spouses. Among their many and varied 
acquisitions were race horses, real estate. interests in closely held businesses, and the said 64 works of an. Their interests in each of 
those works were retained for the remainder of their respective lifetimes. and that an was displayed in their home or office, or those of 
their adult children, or, occasionally, at an an gallery. museum. or other public place, albeit not as one cohesive collection or 
assemblage. 
Decedent and his wife each created an hirer vim Grantor Retained Income Trust ("GRIT') that held title to their respective half 
interests in three of the 64 works (the "GRIT An"). After the death of his wife during the terms of the GRITs, and for the remainder 
of his lifetime. Decedent continued to own his 50 percent interest in those three pieces. His three children received his late wiles 50 
percent interest. 16.667 percent each. 
By virtue of a bequest to him from his wife of her 50 percent interest in each of the remaining works and his subsequent disclaimer of a 
26.945 percent interest in each. 1)emdent owned at his death an aggregate 73.055 percent interest in each of those 61 pieces (the 
*Disclaimer An"). comprising his original 50 percent and the 23.055 percent interest from his wife's bequest that remained after 
deducting the 26.945 percent interest that Decedent disclaimed. That disclaimed interest passed equally to their three children, as their 
mother's successor legatees. 8.98167 percent each, and was owned by them at his death. 
From time to time following the death of his wife. Decedent and his children voluntarily subjected their respective interests in the works 
of an to various restraints on possession, partition, and alienation. For example. Decedent's three children leased their combined 50 
percent interests in two of the three pieces of GRIT An to Ikeedent. thereby ensuring his uninterrupted possession of those two 
works. That lease. which was still in effect at 1km-dent's death. specified. inter alio. that no co-owner could dispose of his or her 
interest in a leased work unless joined by all co-owners. The lease also provided that none could transfer or assign his or her "rights. 
duties and obligations" under the lease without the prior consent of all. 
Similarly. Decedent and his children encumbered all 61 items of Disclaimer Art with a "Cotenants Agreement." Among other things, it 
spelled out each co-owner's right of possession for a specified number of days during any 12 month period. More pertinent to this 
appeal, that agreement prohibited the sale of an interest in any work by a co-owner without the prior consent of all. The one piece of 
GRIT An that had not been subjected to the children's lease to Decedent was eventually added to the list of works covered by the 
Cotenants Agivi.invnt. 
C. Proceedings Prior to 'fax Court litigation 
Decedent died testate in February 2006. His will was probated in Harris County. Texas, and his three children qualified as co-executors.4
The 
4 Decedent's son, who was one of the three co-executors, died unexpectedly in June 2010, after which his two sisters, Petitioners herein, 
continued to serve as the Independent Executors of Decedent's estate. 
Decedent's Estate Tax Return. Form 706. was filed the following May. reporting a tax liability in excess of 5102 million. It listed. among 
other assets, fractional interests in various items of real and personal property, including his 73.005 percent interest in the Disclaimer 
An and his 50 percent interest in the GRIT An.s
s The Commissioner and the Estate eventually stipulated undiscounted FMVs totaling 524,580,650 for the Disclaimer Art and 
SI 0,600,000 for the GRIT An, differing slightly from the appraisal of 523,530.650 for the Disclaimer An and 59.600.000 for the 
GRIT Art previously received by the Estate. 
Following its audit of the estate tax return, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS") accepted net values that remained after deducting 
various fractionalownership discounts on essentially every property, real and personal, in which Decedent owned a fractional interest, 
with but one exception: the 64 works of an. The IRS refused to allow am: discount against the Decedent's pro rata share—his 
fractional-ownership interest—of the stipulated FMVs of these works. Thc IRS assessed an estate tax deficiency of 59,068,266. 
D. Tax Court Proceedings 
The Estate filed the instant action in Tax Court in July 2010, addressing the single substantive issue of the taxable values of Decedent's 
fractional interest in the 64 items of arty By the time of the trial in September 2011, the parties had narrowed a number of issues by 
joint stipulations. During that one-day trial, six witnesses testified, five of whom were tendered as experts. three by the Estate and two 
by the Commissioner. Thc lone non-expert witness was Mrs. Leslie Keith Sasser, Decedent's daughter and co-executor.
