785 F.3d 895, "; 2015 U.S. App. LEXIS 7739, ea; 
126 Fair Empl. Prac. Cas. (BNA) 1793; 99 Empl. Prac. Dec. (CCH) P45,306 
Myers v. Hertz Corp., 624 F.3d 537, 549 (2d Cir. 2010), a reader searches in vain for any 
mention of such a "balancing" in Plaintiffs' submissions. Instead, Plaintiffs' opening brief 
focuses solely on Rule 23(a) commonality. The brief does not even contain a simple 
statement that the district court erred as to predominance for the same r923J reasons 
that it purportedly erred as to commonality -- not to say that such a statement would be 
sufficient, either. See Jimenez v. Allstate Ins. Co., 765 F.3d 1161, 1165 n.4 (9th Cir. 2014) 
(holding that "cursory statements that the district court's order also incorrectly [""71] 
applied Rule 23(b)(3)'s [predominance] requirement" are "not enough to preserve the issue 
for appeal"). 
An appellant must raise every issue that he wishes to press in his opening brief. If the 
appellant fails to address an issue there, then we will deem the issue waived or 
abandoned. We have repeated this rule so often that it might rightfully be termed the best-
established rule in appellate procedure. See, e.g., Metro. Reg'I Info. Sys., Inc. v. Am. 
Home Realty Network, 722 F.3d 591, 602 n.13 (4th Cir. 2013); Kensington Volunteer Fire 
Dep't, Inc. v. Montgomery Cnty., 684 F.3d 462, 472 n.4 (4th Cir. 2012); Mayfield v. Nat'l 
Ass'n for Stock Car Auto Racing, Inc., 674 F.3d 369, 376 (4th Cir. 2012); A Helping Hand, 
LLC v. Balt. Cnty., 515 F.3d 356, 369 (4th Cir. 2008); French v. Assurance Co. of Am., 448 
F.3d 693, 699 n.2 (4th Cir. 2006). As a rule that "all the federal courts of appeals employ," 
waiver "makes excellent sense." Joseph v. United States, 135 S. Ct. 705, 705, 190 L. Ed. 
2d 461 (2014) (Kagan, J., respecting denial of certiorari). 
In past cases, we have endeavored to apply our waiver rule consistently, finding waiver 
whenever a party fails to "develop [his] argument" -- even if his brief takes a passing shot 
at the issue. Belk, Inc. v. Meyer Corp., 679 F.3d 146, 152 n.4 (4th Cir. 2012). We have 
further found arguments waived even though they might have had merit. See IGEN Intl, 
Inc. v. Roche Diagnostics GmbH, 335 F.3d 303, 308-09 (4th Cir. 2003); Pleasurecraft 
Marine Engine Co. v. Thermo Power Corp., 272 F.3d 654, 657 (4th Cir. 2001). And we 
have applied the doctrine despite its potentially significant impact. See, e.g., Carter v. Lee, 
283 F.3d 240, 252 n.11 (4th Cir. 2002) (applying the doctrine in a death penalty case). 
Given that Plaintiffs failed to challenge the district court's ruling on predominance, the plain 
and consistent waiver rule defeats their appeal. "[T]o obtain reversal of a district court 
judgment based on multiple, independent grounds, [""72] an appellant must convince us 
that every stated ground for the judgment against him is incorrect." In re Under Seal, 749 
F.3d 276, 289 (4th Cir. 2014); accord Maher v. City of Chi., 547 F.3d 817, 821 (7th Cir. 
2008); Jankovic v. Intl Crisis Gm., 494 F.3d 1080, 1086, 377 U.S. App. D.C. 434 (D.C. Cir. 
2007). Appellate courts have repeatedly affirmed district court decisions denying class 
certification where plaintiffs failed to contest a predominance finding. See, e.g., Little v. T-
Mobile USA, Inc., 691 F.3d 1302, 1306-08 (11th Cir. 2012); Klay v. Humana, Inc., 382 F.3d 
1241, 1268 (11th Cir. 2004), abrogated on other grounds by Bridge v. Phoenix Bond & 
Indemnity Co., 553 U.S. 639, 128 S. Ct. 2131, 170 L. Ed. 2d 1012 (2008); Applewhite v. 
Reichhold Chems., Inc., 67 F.3d 571, 573-74 (5th Cir. 1995). Nothing calls for a different 
result here.
