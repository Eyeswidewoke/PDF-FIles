The U.A.E., particularly the port of Dubai, ha= long been an important trade conduit for Iran in the region. Iran'= 
imports from the Gulf region amounted to around $35 billion last year, the=bulk of which were exports from the U.A.E. 
that were imported via Dubai, according to figures from the Washington-base= Institute of International Finance. 
Globally, the U.A.E. is one of Irani,=804>s largest trade partners alongside India and China. 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch predicts that wi=h the removal of sanctions Iran's annual import totals could soar 
t= $200 billion from $80 billion in 2014. The U.A.E. is among those countries=best positioned to benefit from the trade 
flows, analysts at the bank said in a note to clients. 
Like the U.A.E., Oman, which has the closest p=litical relationship with Iran of all the Gulf States, is making 
headway to=strengthen its economic ties. Ahead of the nuclear agreement between Iran a=d world powers, Iranian 
President Hassan Rouhani visited Oman in March and signed a 25-year deal to sell $60 b=llion worth of natural gas to 
the Arab state. 
Access to cheap energy in Iran, as well as raw=materials and labor, means the country is in a sweet spot for 
production of=ceramics, said Mr. Massaad, the RAK chief executive. In production of ceram=cs, Iran ranks fourth globally 
after China, Brazil and India in terms of capacity, a fact that spurred RAK=Ceramics to acquire a 420,000-square-meter 
(about 104 acres) tract of land i= Isfahan, Iran, (about 270 miles south of Iran) and build a plant in 2005, h= said. 
But one year later, sanctions were imposed on l=an, and RAK Ceramics cut annual production from nine million 
square meters o= tiles to six million. As financial sanctions tightened, manufacturing fell=further and the company cut its 
roughly 480-strong Iranian workforce to around 70. 
For the past six months, the facility has prod=ced nothing and sales have come to a virtual standstill. In the first 
quart=r, RAK reported an overall profit but noted losses of 15.4 million U.A.E. d=rhams ($4 million) related to 
hyperinflation in Iran and Sudan. RAK decided to sell its operation in the A=rican country earlier this year. 
After years of talks, the U.S. and other forei=n governments struck a deal in July that will limit parts of 
Iran's=nuclear program in exchange for lifting international sanctions. The agreem=nt still must survive a U.S. 
congressional vote, among other political hurdles. 
Now Mr. Massaad is preparing a staff team to g= back to Iran. But the tile maker isn't going to get ahead of 
polit=cs and will wait for sanctions to unwind before committing more investment.=If sanctions ease, RAK plans to use 
Iran to export to Russia, Central Asia and Europe. 
"We were in a dilemma," Mr. Ma=saad said. "[But] we have an asset which is fully equipped, fully i=vested. We 
don't need to wait years to find land. We can produce in=very short term in a market that will boom."
