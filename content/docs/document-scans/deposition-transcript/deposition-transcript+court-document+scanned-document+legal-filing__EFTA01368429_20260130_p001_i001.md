7. PORTFOLIO RECONCILIATION PROCEDURES 
The following procedures govern the portfolio reconciliations to be performed between DB and Client 
1. 
DEFINITIONS 
The capitali7ed terms used in these procedures have the meanings specified below. 
"Data Delivery Date" means a date determined pursuant to these procedures, as applicable, that is a Joint 
Business Day. 
"Data Reconciliation" means a comparison of Portfolio Data and, to the extent applicable, SDR Data 
received or obtained by one party against such party's own books and records of swaps between the 
parties and, in respect of any Discrepancy, a process for identifying and resolving such Discrepancy. A 
Data Reconciliation may include (but shall not be required to include or be limited to) a systematic, line-
by-line, field-by-field matching process performed using technological means such as a third party 
portfolio reconciliation service or a technology engine. 
"Discrepancy" means (i) in respect of the Portfolio Data received with respect to a swap and any SDR 
Data obtained for such swap, a difference between a Material Term in such Portfolio Data or SDR Data 
and a party's own records of the corresponding Material Term and (ii) in scsia.t.t of the Portfolio Data 
received with respect to a Swap, a difference between a Valuation reported in such Portfolio Data and 
such party's own Valuation of such swap (calculated as of the same Joint Business Day in good faith and 
using commercially reasonable procedures in order to produce a commercially reasonable result) that is 
greater than the Discrepancy Threshold Amount. 
"Discrepancy Threshold Amount" means, in respect of a swap, an amount equal to ten percent (10%) of 
the higher of the two absolute values of the respective Valuations assigned to such swap by both parties. 
"Joint Business Day" means a day that is a business day for both DB and Client. 
"Material Terms" means all terms of a swap required to be reported in accordance with Part 45 of the 
CFTC Regulations. 
"Portfolio Data" means, in respect of a party providing or required to provide such data, information 
(which, for the avoidance of doubt, is not required to include calculations or methodologies) relating to 
the terms of all outstanding swaps between DB and Client in a form and standard that is capable of being 
reconciled, with a scope and level of detail that is reasonably acceptable to each party and that describes 
and includes, without limitation, current Valuations attributed by that party to each such swap. The 
information comprising the Portfolio Data to be provided by a Party on a Data Delivery Date shall be 
prepared (i) as at the time or times that such party computes its end of day valuations for swaps (as 
specified by that party for this purpose in writing) on the immediately preceding Joint Business Day, as 
applicable, and (ii) in the case of Valuations, in good faith and using commercially reasonable procedures 
in order to produce a commercially reasonable result. 
"SDR Data" means Material Terms data that is available from a swap data repository registered as such 
with the CFTC. 
"Valuation" means the current market value or net present value of a swap.
