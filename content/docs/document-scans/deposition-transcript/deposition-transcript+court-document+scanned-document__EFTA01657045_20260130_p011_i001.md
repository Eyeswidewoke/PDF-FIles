had total amnesia for the events, which were terrible. The CI involved extensive reconstruction 
of the circumstances leading up to and into the target events. As with many forensic cases of 
amnesia, the underlying impediment could have been repression, suppression, ordinary 
forgetting, or an absence of a consolidated memory record due to brain injury. Given the 
circumstances of the case, some therapists who were experienced in handling victims of severe 
trauma suggested that it would be best if she never remembered the events. Instead, she should 
receive treatment for her symptoms for as long as necessary. The victim's own therapist 
however believed it would be best if she did remember the events in an effort to achieve some 
closure to this unfortunate life episode. In this particular case, the CI was not successful in 
"unblocking" her lack of memory for the events, but she was appreciative and appeared satisfied 
with the interview experience. 
CI Components Promoting Therapeutic Jurisprudence 
Although we believe that the CI promotes better psychological health among victims, we have 
not examined systematically which components of the CI contribute to this effect. We speculate 
here which components are the "active ingredients" and why they promote victims' well being. 
Our guiding framework is that victims may feel a loss of control over their lives-after all, being 
victimized implies that one cannot control one's life. Victims may also experience a sense of 
inadequacy, which manifests itself retrospectively as feeling responsible for their own 
misfortunate and prospectively as feeling anxious about their ability to "perform" as a good 
witness during the interview. Finally, they may experience feelings of outrage of having been 
victimized and they need to share those feelings with another person who can understand their 
plight. 
We also borrow from more classic applications of Therapeutic Jurisprudence, of patients going 
through the process of being committed to a hospital (Winick,2005a; 2005b). Here, scholars have 
argued that a few core principles are essential for patients to maintain their self-esteem and self-
worth, namely, being treated with dignity and respect, having the opportunity to give voice to 
their beliefs and to tell their story, and ideally, to be guided, but not coerced, to make decisions. 
We believe that the same elements will also promote psychological well being among victims. 
Increased Recall: Our original goal in developing the CI was to increase victim/witness recall, 
not to promote their well being. We now believe that victims' greater recall with the CI may 
contribute to their better psychological functioning. That is, extensive recall is itself a sign that 
victims have mastered the event, and especially when they can provide fine-grained details in a 
free-flowing narration. We are constantly impressed when witnesses comment after the interview 
session: Wow, I'm surprised that I can remember so much! And it is precisely because victims 
can recall the event in such depth that allows them to conclude that they can control the event 
rather than being controlled by the event.As a result of having recalled extensively in a public 
context (i.e., in concert with the investigator), victims are also likely to feel more committed to
