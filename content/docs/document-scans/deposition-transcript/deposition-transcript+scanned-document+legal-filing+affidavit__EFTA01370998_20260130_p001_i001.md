New relationships 
2. Significant other wins in account retention 
2017 performance highlights: 
Third Lake — had major relationship breakthrough in 2016. Won $107mm in deposits in DBTCA across 18 accounts. All 
deposits and 16 accounts were gone by the end of the year due to the DOJ news (the two remaining open accounts had 
less than $1 in them). Family CIO also left in 2016. Rebuilt trust in DB throughout 2017. Have opened 37 new accounts 
this year, including for family office executive who isn't part of the family. Have received $130mm in new deposits this 
year into DBNY, with current balance at $82mm. Have developed strong relationship with new CIO and also directly 
with family members. In active dialog around new investments. Revenues will be up 100% yoy vs. 2016. This is a huge 
win from where we started. 
Southern Financial — one of the most complicated client situations I've seen. Have been extremely vocal about our lack 
of trading capabilities in KCP. Withdrew large portion of assets during 2016 (not DOJ related). Client was offboarded by 
Global markets at the end of 2016 due to lack of profitability. Further internal issues nearly caused us to offboard the 
client completely. Client was quite close to Paul and viewed his departure as a negative. We've managed to salvage and 
massively improve this relationship in 2017. To start, we won 550mm of deposits into DBNY based on strong 
relationship coverage of client and his family office. We've also turned around the GM/trading issues via KCP. Client has 
been re-onboarded and ISDA reestablished, and is now the first and largest trading counterparty of the KCP capital 
markets group. Current balances are - $150mm across brokerage and deposits. Revenues should be up 100% yoy vs. 
2016 and investment revenue run rate (via KCP) is substantial. 
Ali Rashid - $50mm + net worth client. Former private equity partner. Won relationship away from GS and 
JPM. Accounts established July 2017. So far has traded: 
0PM, RCM and structured notes via ISG. DB has become his top bank and relationship is growing steadily. 
Financial Architects — Insurance advisory firm based in Boston and California. Strong relationship with former CS broker 
who runs business development there has led to several referrals for insurance premium finance and a single stock 
hedging transaction. At this point we are working on a few live situations, but have been held back by some state 
insurance licensing constraints. This should be a major source of new client relationships for us if we can efficiently 
execute on the premium finance opportunity. So far, they have referred clients worth more than $1.5bn. Working 
closely with Suzy Cozzi in lending and Sam Petrucci to make this work. 
MCM — Worked closely with Terri and KCP to win $250mm fundraising mandate. Successfully convinced KCP to take on 
the 3PI mandate. Deal still in progress, and complicated.
