Estimated annual income remains 1.5MM from salary and investment income. 
After further conver 
sation with the client, he revealed more information on positions we were not aware of. His estimate 
d net worth is now 20-25MM, revised up from 5-10MM. This is not a change in wealth, just a better un 
derstanding of the assets he has been holding since the relationship began.
