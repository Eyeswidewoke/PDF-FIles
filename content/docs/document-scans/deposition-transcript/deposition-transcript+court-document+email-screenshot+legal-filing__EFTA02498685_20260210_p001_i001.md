AHH now a subject that is easy. =AO economic theories can be studied ad nauseum they need to in=lude time energy, 
doesn't help the the people that you an I care abou=. . one way to read yours statement is that lower mortga=e 
interest deductions meant LESS benefit to the wealthy. its a deduc=ion! . he writes about england and the us. two 
dif=erent currencies. inflation in one deflation in the other. =AO arguments framed in percentages are an axe on the

alt min tax =A tax calculation that adds certain t=x preference items back into adjusted gross income. how to

R has a =uge 
home , and deducts 30k of interest ( max) on his return.. ( tax savings a@=0 percent rate, 10k). his deduction however 
is added back into gros= income under the alt minimum . increase by 30k @tax rate of 4= ( 12 k ) net 2k more in tax. 
12k - 10k . state and federal included. , Mr P given 2k in earned income c=edit, and food stamps. on a sliding scale.

its books allows it to make the more risky home loan to Mr P. =AO The value of all the homes in the neighborhood
