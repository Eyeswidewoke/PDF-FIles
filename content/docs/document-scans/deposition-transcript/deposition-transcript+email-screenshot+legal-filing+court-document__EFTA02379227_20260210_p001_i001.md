lqala's Salary 
Good Afternoon, 
In regard to the Matter of my request for a Salary Increase, originally discussed on Thursda Februa 
17th 2011. 
In a meeting attended by; You Mr. Jeffrey Epstein, Myself 'gala Joseph, Gary Kearney, and 
I made known my desire for an Increase in my salary. 
My reason for doing so, at that time, was primarily due to the fact that my One Year Anniversary was coming up March 
1st, 2011 
When I was originally hired for the position of Landscape Supervisor in February of 2010 the details of my arrangement 
were; 
- $50,000 base Salary 
- Full United Heath Care Benefits 
- Monday through Friday = Work week (No Weekends Required) 
- *Provision for re-negotiation of terms after 6 months of service 
In September 2010 my six months of consecutive service had passed, and I made mention to
and Gary 
Kearney my desire for an increase, due to the fact that after physically doing the job it was clear that the level of 
Responsibility, Accountability, and overall workload warranted a slightly higher wage. I was advised to "wait until the 
trees from Puerto Rico get here successfully" which I did, I waited and worked another 5 months. 
Now let me say, that I enjoy my Job and I consider it a blessing to be able to exercise my experience, education and 
overall passion for plants on the LSJ project, which is truly one of a kind to say the least. 
The only reason I am asking for a salary increase is because I feel the level of service I give does not reflect the 
compensation I am currently receiving, I truly believe my contribution is worth more, and to be completely honest, I 
Need more money for my household in exchange for my valuable time and energy. 
Originally I asked for an increase from $50,000 to $75,000 which would bring me up to about $35.00 per hour, a 
$10.00 hourly increase, and a $25,000 yearly increase, which I felt was a better reflection of the value of the work I 
perform. 
That same afternoon You, offered me the ability to be a "sub contractor" to take away my health benefits, but give me 
the money I requested, you said you "haven't decided to go that route yet", but you wanted me to know that you "were 
looking right into it" I simply listened attentively to what you said, neither agreeing or disagreeing with the possible 
arrangement. 
In the time that has passed since then, I thought a lot about my true motivation behind wanting more money, and it all 
boils down to simple economics. 
I am unconcerned with weather or not others may or may not be doing less work and taking home more money. I 
don't care how much more others in my position were paid nor how little they accomplished during their time on the 
Island. I don't even worry about being one of the only Local Virgin Islanders to serve your corporation at this level. 
All I Really Care about is providing for My family the best that I can, and giving the best, and most valuable service 
possible.
