NBC News (06/05, Lavietes) reported that Luigi Mangione wrote about plans to kill UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian 
Thompson in his diary months before Thompson was gunned down in New York City last year, state prosecutors 
alleged in a court filing Wednesday. According to the article, Mangione, 27, who has pleaded not guilty to state and 
federal charges in connection with the murder in December, used a red notebook as a diary to document his plans 
to kill Thompson, the court filing alleges. Authorities confiscated the notebook during Mangione's arrest in 
Pennsylvania after a five-day manhunt for Thompson's killer. In submitting the court filing, state prosecutors were 
trying to justify the terrorism enhancement added to Mangione's first-degree murder charge. Last month, 
Mangione's attorney filed a motion to dismiss the state murder charges. 
FBI Places Warning Signs at Northeast Ohio Crypto ATMs to Stop Would-Be Scam Victims 
WOIO (CBS-19) (06/05, Picciano) reported that the very latest Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) report shows 
$9.3 billion worth of crime related to cryptocurrency. Every day, the FBI is attempting to find the offenders and put 
a stop to them, but success rates are low when it comes to getting your money back. According to the article, the 
FBI has a new method they're using to try and stop people from becoming a crypto scam victim in the first place. 
The article quoted FBI Special Agent Milan Kosanovich, who said, "So people who don't have bank accounts but still 
want to transit money to friends and family, whether it be across the country, overseas, whatever it is. It's a way to 
do that. It's a way to do investments, too, if you prefer to onboard yourself into the crypto ecosystem that way," he 
said. The Cleveland FBI office is now sending out signs to all of the bitcoin operators in the area to serve as a 
warning sign for those using crypto atms for the first time. "If you're using the crypto ATM because somebody that 
you don't know has told you you have to do this in order to avoid arrest, prosecution, or to escrow your money or 
something, we want to give you that chance to take a second thought and say, "hey, look, I should really think 
about this before I hit send, because once I hit send, I can't do anything to get this back," said Agent Kosanovich. 
GirlsDoPorn Owner Pleads Guilty to Sex Trafficking, Conspiracy Charges in San Diego Court 
KFMB (CBS-8) (06/05, Hargrove) reported that the ringleader of a San Diego-based adult website accused of 
coercing young women to appear in adult videos pleaded guilty in federal court to sex trafficking and conspiracy to 
commit sex trafficking. Michael Pratt, who founded Girls Do Porn and ran the website from his downtown San 
Diego penthouse, is now asking a federal judge to sentence him to less than 22 years for the long-running scheme 
that involved dozens of young women. From 2012 through 2019, Pratt set up an elaborate plan to lure and entice 
young women to travel to San Diego and appear in the illicit videos. Pratt set up a fake modeling agency and posted 
ads on Craigslist and other sites seeking models aged 23 and younger. When women responded to ads, Pratt and 
his cohorts would tell the women that the modeling jobs included having sex on video. The article noted that Pratt 
was added to the FBI's Top Ten Most Wanted list and remained a fugitive for three years until he was arrested in 
Spain in December 2022 and extradited to San Diego in March 2024.

WLOX (ABC-13) (06/05, Staff Writer) reported that Thursday afternoon, officials with the FBI Jackson, along with
