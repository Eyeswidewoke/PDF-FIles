weaker with similar trends to 1Q13. This trend is driven by increased purchasing in 4Q13 & being at higher end of 
inventory range before '14 price increases. '14 guidance for base biz is $11.3-$11.5B.=We are at $11.58. Reiterate Buy 
on valuation. 
We have increased our Sovaldi numbers in '14 by $700M to $5.7B We have taken up our numbers for US & EU 
Sovaldi over 2014 based on two trends 1) faster than expected launch in EU in a few countries (we previously assumed 
no sales in 1Q in EU) and 2) strong than expected new script trends in the US. Our new WW quarterly estimates are 
$1.21B, $1.91B, $1.32B, and $1.27B. In Gilead's early survey work, mgmt has found tha= the Sovaldi mix roughly reflects 
real world US genotypic mix (70%671 and 30% in GT 2 &3). 
We calculate every 1K new starts to Sovaldi could add $250M-$300M in revs 
We assume warehousing in 2Q since we expect Sovaldi interferon free combo in mid 4Q14. We assume monthly 
new starts declining to —4000/mo avg. in 2Q/3Q from the highs of —13K in 1Q. 
Mgmt color on taxes: supply arrangements allow US sales to have tax benefit 
Mgmt noted that every $18 of Sovaldi sales led to a lower tax rate of .75-1= irrespective of where the sales are 
located. Before the call, GILD had noted potential tax benefit over time from greater ex-US sales and IP in Ireland. On call 
today, we learned of new structuring supply arrangement that allows for US sales to flow out of Ireland manufacturing 
facility. These benefits will continue over a multi-year period but the magnitude of impact is greater in the near-term. 
The company has not given long-term tax guidance yet. 
We estimate '14 tax rate at 23% which could further decrease to 18% o=er time if Sovaldi hits our revenue 
estimate 
On core biz basis, there was no impact from R&D tax in 2014. This one-t=me benefit lead to a .5-.75% hit to their 
tax rate. We calculate 2014 tax rate at - 23.5% (28.5% core biz, then subtract 5% impact of $5.7B Sovaldi sales). This 
math is based on our numbers suggest an implied Sovaldi tax rate at - 13% using revenue weighted calculations. This 
makes our weighted avg. tax rate for 2015 at - 21%. Every 100bps tax rate impacts 2015 EPS by 10c (1.3% our of '14 EPS). 
Generic Sustiva will benefit COGS over next three years. We model COGS of 20% in '14 vs. 12% in '16 
Sustiva (a component of Atripla not made by GILD) is going generic this year in Europe. In US, it will go generic in 
2015. There is a step-down function of the royalty payments over three years according to mgmt.=font size="3"> 
Valuation & risks — Gilead still remains our top pick in large ca= 
We value GILD at $132/sh using 17X 2015 multiple (10% discount to its biote=h peers due to patent cliff on base 
biz). Our new '15 EPS is $7.75/sh. =irks: weak sovaldi launch, poor base biz performance
