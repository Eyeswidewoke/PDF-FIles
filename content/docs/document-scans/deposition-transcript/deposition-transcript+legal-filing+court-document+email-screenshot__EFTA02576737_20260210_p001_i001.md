> Just a follow up to our conversation yesterday - There has certainly been a= issue of timeliness with Alan and maybe a 
push from Karp changes that. As l=said to you yesterday, maybe Alan's client load needs to be narrowed to ena=le him 
to service Leon Properly. We have questioned whether Alan is "smart"=enough and "well equipped" enough in terms of 
level of his planning experierce but, thinking more about what has transpired during the past several mon=hs, I would 
like to suggest maybe we need to think about this a little diff=rently. 
> Maybe the greater issue is difference of style. We knew Alan was a conserv=tive practitioner when we hired him. I 
believed that would be a complement t= your style but I am feeling like, instead, it has created conflict. Yes, i= a few 
cases, the 'delay' may have been a function of Alan not having seen c=rtain things done the way you've suggested 
(raising the issue of whether he=has sophisticated enough planning skills for a client like Leon) but more o=ten, I believe, 
he was conversant but disagreed, and the delay was a functi=n of time spent by Alan to research further to decide 
whether he could come=around to agree with your plan. My observation would be that both Alan and A=a are well able 
to hold there own when in debate with you which, in itself,=speaks well for both of them given the level at which you 
operate. I've tol= you previously that I am a great believer in a dialog of constructive crit=cism getting a team to the best 
possible decision. Somehow, our dialogs jus= seem more painful for both sides than they need to be. I know sometimes 
th= dialog is necessary just for you to get Alan where he needs to be on a sub=ect, and sometimes I think Alan knows he 
is waging a losing battle. I think=Ada and Alan are very similar stylistically. I may be on thin ice here (wit=out any legal 
background) but from my perspective, I'm not sure Alan brings=a much higher level of expertise than we have with Ada. 
If we are going to p=y for outside counsel that is something we should be looking for. 
> Having just presented the thought that maybe the issue is style rather tha= smarts, I must admit that the fact that the 
quality of drafting in the doc=ments we received for the new GRAT and related trusts has been lacking, we c=n't dismiss 
the issue of "how well equipped". I know you said these are the=sorts of documents that should reflect Alan's longtime 
efforts to craft a g=od document that is then ready to go when needed. You are the better judge =but it seems to me we 
did not have the same quality issues in the documents=we received in the planning steps earlier this year related to the 
substitu=ion, will, etc.
