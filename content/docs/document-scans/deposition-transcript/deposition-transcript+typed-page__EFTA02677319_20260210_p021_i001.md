Credits: 4 
CRN 4802 Sec A 
Memories start in the senses. in childhood. But inside every sense-memory lies coded information 
about how the person remembering is situated in the world in terms of class, race. gender and 
history. When a writer puts memories into narrative form. those 'situational' details (about class. 
race. gender and history) often determine the nature of the narrative: its 'design' (how the 
narrative pieces fit together). Its tone. its ultimate -argument.' This course will start with a text 
that seems almost formlessly constructed from 'pure' sense memories (that is, the writer creates 
the illusion of experiencing the memories again as she writes): Virginia Woolf's 'A Sketch,' in her 
collection of autobiographical writing. Moments of Being. It will expand outwards into a series of 
memoirs whose writers have invented their own ways of structuring core sense memories. In the 
course of the semester, we will move Woolfs 'introductory' text, to a cluster of early-20th century 
Russian male memoirs, followed by a cluster of contemporary female memoirs from America. At 
the end. we encounter two fairly recent experimental memoirs, one European, one American, both 
of which push the genre Into new territories.

CRN 4461 See A 
It's an old question: is translation a form of treason? A betrayal of the original? Or is it a 
collaboration between the writer and the translator? Is it a high form of literary criticism? Or is it 
something that could be accomplished by a really sophisticated software program? In this RFW 
course, students will study the theory and practice of literary translation with a particular focus on 
poetry. Students will choose a poet or poets writing in a language other than English and over the 
course of the semester develop a fluency that makes the poetry available as poetry to the English 
reader. Students will also write a significant critical essay on their chosen poet(s) which will include 
studies of comparable translations by other translators. While students are not required to be 
highly fluent in the language(s) from which they will translate, it is strongly recommended.

In this course, we will read Marcel Proust's In Search of Lost Time. We will focus on the text itself 
and attempt to recover the many conversations 'Marcel' is having with other disciplines such as 
music, art criticism, theater, philosophy, and historiography. One question I will bring to the table 
is the following. How does Proust reinvent ekphrasis? Proust has inspired many readings. We will 
read some of the most provocative ones, Including Julia Knsteva's. We will also linger on the ways 
Proust's work foreshadows the work of writers like Nathalie Sarraute and Samuel Berrien.
