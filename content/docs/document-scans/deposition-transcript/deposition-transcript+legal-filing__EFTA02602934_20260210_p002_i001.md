When you say they were con=eyed to Carol alone, what exactly does this mean? Conveyed to what?=C2 We have been 
discussing the Marital Trust. Were they conveyed =o this? To a different Trust? Later you refer to a "non-e=empt 
Trust". Is that a different one? If so, I should kno= more about it: its balance, and in fact all the other questions I raised 
=bout the Marital Trust we have been discussing, repeated below in red. =AO Is the Trust we have been discussing an 
"Exempt Marital Trust"= as distinct from the non-Exempt Trust you refer to below. What is t=e distinction? Are there 
other Trusts that I participate in in some =ay? 
One of the questions I=raised in my letter had to do with decisions made in 2008. As I expl=ined, Carol was of course 
unable to participate in any decision. She=was wasting away, under 24 hour care at home. I was unable to partic=pate 
in any decision, or to give anything like informed consent, because I=was spending most of my time caring for Carol as 
she was dying. So I=do not understand how any decisions were made in 2008, and by whom. 
Copies of the deeds are on record. I ca='t attest to the signatures on them, but they can be viewed on the websites of 
the Middlesex County (South) Reg=stry of Deeds and the Barnstable County Registry of Deeds. The conve=ances were 
done so that at Carol's death the properties would (in =ccordance with the terms of her will) pass into her trust, which is 
what occurred. 
=/u>2. 
When the Lexington h=use was sold the proceeds were held by the Exempt Marital Trust (as it own=d the 
property). As you know, the trust also lent you about $500K to facilitate the purchase of the Cambridge property.</=> 
To make sure I unders=and, of the proceeds from the sale of the Lexington, roughly half went to = loan to me and the 
other half went to the Marital Trust -- though I am no= sure now which Marital Trust. Is that correct? 
3. 
The Cape property was distributed to you=from the Non-Exempt Trust in 2010, after which you deeded it into the 
Gull=Haven Lane LLC and gifted the LLC membership units (shares) to your children. 
A mentioned=above, I'm confused about this Trust, its status and the other questio=s raised above 
=/u>4. 
With respect to the =istributions made from the trusts, I would again refer you to the reports =hat I sent to 
Deborah and Richard. That said, those reports only show the total amounts distributed to you or on your behalf f=om 
the trusts. From your gift tax returns and from Bainco's =ecords it would be possible to detail how much you gave to 
each of your ch=ldren and grandchildren (and how much you paid in tuitions) since 2009. 
What=l requested in my letter in this regard was different. Instead of re=eating, I'll simply lift them from the letter, and I 
still would like =larification about these: 
I would like to know more about this. Richard Kahn d=d forward reports to me, but all that I see is from the last few 
years, af=er I requested information. I don't have any records for the yea=s since 2009, when I appointed Harry trustee, 
neither about the income tha= was supposed to be paid to me or about distributions from the Trust or an= accounting of 
those years. So could you send them to both of us, along wi=h documentation about any distributions that were made. 
In particula=, I would like to know the reason why there is virtually no income from th= trust -- whether it was paid to 
me from 2009 or not. And about the =nstructions for any distributions that may have been made from the Trust. =/b>
