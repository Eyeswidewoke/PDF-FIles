agent thereof) shall give the Key Holders and the Investors at least ten (10) days prior written 
notice of any Approved Sale as to which the Investors constituting the Requisite Approval intend

Irrevocable Proxy. To secure the Key Holder's and the Investor's obligations to 
vote the Key Holder Shares and the Investor Shares in accordance with this Agreement, each 
Key Holder and each Investor hereby appoints the Chief Executive Officer of the Company, or 
his designees, as such Key Holder's or Investor's true and lawful proxy and attorney, with the 
power to act alone and with full power of substitution, to vote all of such Key Holder's Key 
Holder Shares or such Investor's Investor Shares as set forth in this Agreement and to execute all 
appropriate instruments consistent with this Agreement on behalf of such Key Holder or Investor 
if, and only if, such Key Holder or Investor fails to vote all of such Key Holder's Key Holder 
Shares or such Investor's Investor Shares or execute such other instruments in accordance with 
the provisions of this Agreement within five (5) days of the Company's or any other party's 
written request for such Key Holder's or Investor's written consent or signature. The proxy and 
power granted by each Key Holder and Investor pursuant to this Section 1.8 are coupled with an 
interest and are given to secure the performance of such party's duties under this Agreement.

entity, will survive the merger or reorganization of such party or any other entity holding any
