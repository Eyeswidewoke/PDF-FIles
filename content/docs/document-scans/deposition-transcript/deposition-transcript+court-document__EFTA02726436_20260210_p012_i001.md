MR. EDWARDS: Don't answer. If we're going to 
2 
get into specific sexual issues, this is up on 
3 
appeal. Fourth District Court of Appeal just 
4 
issued a Rule to Show Cause directed towards 
5 
Mr. Epstein. Until that issue is resolved, she's 
6 
not going to answer specific sexual issues. She's 
7 
admitted to being a call girl. She will continue 
8 
to do so. 
9 
She's not going answer the names of the places 
where she did it or any Joint's as we feel that 
issue has not been covered. And until that is 
resolved, we're instructing our client not to 
answer. Additionally on those questions, we are 
invoking her Fifth Amendarraright to remain 
silent, tight of privacy as toe., as well as the 
right of privacy of third-parry individuals. 
MR. LUTTIER: Okay. Let me, just so we have a 
clear record, I am going break those questions down 
and then you can --
MR. EDWARDS: Sure. 
MR. LIMIER: — assert your objection.

MR. EDWARDS: Same objection. Don't answer. 
2 
MR. LUTI7ER: What, what specifically is the 
3 
objection to that? 
4 
MR. EDWARDS: The objection is that this issue 
5 
is up on appeal. And the Fourth District Court of 
6 
Appeal has issued a Rule to Show Cause Order 
7 
directed towards Mr. Epstein. Until that issue is 
8 
resolved, we're not answering that questis.The 
9 
basis of that issue is the privacy rights °FM., 
10 
the privacy ripaof third parties as well as the 
11 
invocation ofa.'s Fifth Amendment tight to 
12 
remain silent on this issue. 
13 
MR. CRITTON: Just so, and again let me just 
14 
insert here so the record is clear: You, in 
15 
essence, took up an issue associated with interrog, 
16 
a portion of interrogatory 19 where you chose to 
17 
answer certain portions and not to answer other 
18 
portions. Portion dealt with, in essence, prior 
19 
time. And I will put it out if necessary. 
20 
The court has not issued, Judge Hafele didn't 
21 
preclude any type of questioning with regard to 
22 
income-related issues associated with where she 
23 
worked, what she did, how she made her money, bow 
24 
much income she did make.
