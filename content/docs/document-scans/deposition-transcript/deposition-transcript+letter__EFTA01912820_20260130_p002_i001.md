As we used to spend many sundays reviewing the world , I wondered why that 
had ceased. I would really appreciate a direct ,blunt, answer. 
>>>>I loved those conversations; they were the high point of my week. They stopped for two 
reasons that I am aware of: (1) You used to call me, at least 90% of the time. I think that 
stopped when I was moving here and my whereabouts were uncertain. (2) I became bad 
company. I've really hated being out here, and have been struggling for a way out. In the last 
month rve talked to three different lawyers and two head hunters (Pm not very good at sitting 
on my hands and praying for rain). It's clear that I've put myself in a bind: (i) The only places I 
would rather be are NYC or DC -- I don't want to move back to Boston. (ii) If I move before 
I've been here at least 3 years, my rep will solidify as somebody who can't be counted on to 
"stick with it." (iii) My shelf life is rapidly evaporating. I got an honorary doctorate from the 
University of Berne last month. On my 64th birthday (which they did not know), over lunch 
my hosts were talking about how they must retire at 65 -- and by age 63 they are already being 
denied space and resources, in the run-up to being put out to pasture. I was so grateful to be 
an American, but also aware that we have a similar system, just displaced by five years or so. 
(One of the head hunters told me that "70 is the new 65," which essentially means that 65 is 
the limit for moving.) In response to all of this, I've just accepted a part-time job with a startup 
here, which is putting together a new university from scratch (seamlessly melding the virtual 
with bricks-and-mortar... one campus will be in NYC). They want me to be their "Founding 
Dean," and I plan to do that. Larry Summers is chair of the board (which also includes Steve 
Hyman and various other people you know.) I'll send you the Strategic Plan, if you are 
interested. 
I recognized , when you were still at Harvard that my more colorful past had 
strained some of your relations with others however, . I am trying to make some 
course corrections as i approach the springtime of my senility, and look to you in 
hope of inputing some new coordinates. 
>>>>Actually, I've never much cared what other people think about you. That was never a big 
issue for me. I would be more than happy to help you in any way I can -- you've certainly 
helped me a lot! (Btw: you are thanked in the Preface to my new book, on the top-
brain/bottom-brain stuff -- you played a critical role when I first had the idea, which you 
probably don't even remember now. I of course put in the disclaimer that neither you (nor or 
Pinker, Gilbert, or others who helped me) necessarily agree with where I went with the 
ideas... ) 
I am hoping to be in NYC at some point soon. When plans start to gel, I'll run dates by you so 
that we can find a couple of hours to talk in person. 
Thanks again for the note. 
Warmly,
