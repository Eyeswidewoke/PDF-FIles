Long-term Debt Under Our Revolving Credit Facility 
We entered into a revolving credit agreement with certain lenders in April 2014. which provided for a $225.0 million revolving 
unsecured credit facility maturing on April 4, 2019. As of December 31, 2014 $30.0 million was drawn under the credit facility, with 
$195.0 million remaining as available. On July 1, 2015. we repaid the outstanding loan balance of $30 million, which was previously 
drawn under the credit facility. As of September 30, 2015, no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility, with $225.0 million 
remaining available. 
Borrowings under the credit facility bear interest, at our option, at (i) a base rate based on the highest of the prime rate, the 
federal funds rate plus 0.50%, and an adjusted LIBOR rate for a one-month interest period plus 1.00%, in each case plus a margin 
ranging from 0.00% to 0.75%; or (ii) an adjusted LIBOR rate plus a margin ranging from 1.00% to 1.75%. This margin is 
determined based on the total leverage ratio for the preceding fiscal quarter or fiscal year and whether a qualified initial public 
offering has occurred in accordance with the terms of the revolving credit agreement. We are obligated to pay other customary fees 
for a credit facility of this size and type including an annual administrative agent fee of $0.1 million and an unused commitment fee 
ranging from 0.10% to 0.25% depending on our leverage ratio. We paid $0.4 million in unused commitment fees during the year 
ended December 31, 2014. We paid $0.4 million in fees related to unused commitments during the nine months ended September 
30, 2015. 
The credit facility contains operating covenants, including customary limitations on the incurrence of certain indebtedness and 
liens, restrictions on certain inter-company transactions, and limitations on the amount of dividends and stock repurchases. 
On November 2, 2015, we entered into a new revolving credit agreement with certain lenders, which extinguished the prior 
revolving credit agreement, and provided for a $350.0 million revolving secured credit facility maturing on November 2020. This new 
revolving credit agreement is secured by certain tangible and intangible assets. The new credit facility contains operating 
covenants, including customary limitations on the incurrence of certain indebtedness and liens, restrictions on certain inter-company 
transactions, restrictions on the sale or other disposition of collateral and limitations on the amount of dividends and stock 
repurchases. 
Loans under the new credit facility bear interest, at our option, at (i) a base rate based on the highest of the prime rate, the 
federal funds rate plus 0.50% and an adjusted LIBOR rate for a one-month interest period in each case plus a margin ranging from 
0.00% to 1.00%, or (ii) an adjusted LIBOR rate plus a margin ranging from 1.00% to 2.00%. This margin is determined based on 
our total leverage ratio for the preceding four fiscal quarters and our status as a public or non-public company. We are obligated to 
pay other customary fees for a credit facility of this size and type including an annual administrative agent fee of $0.1 million and 
an unused commitment fee of 0.15%. To date no funds were drawn under the new credit facility, with $350.0 million remaining 
available. 
Additionally, we have entered into an agreement for an incremental $25.0 million of capacity under our revolving secured 
credit facility from an existing investor, which becomes effective following our initial public offering.
