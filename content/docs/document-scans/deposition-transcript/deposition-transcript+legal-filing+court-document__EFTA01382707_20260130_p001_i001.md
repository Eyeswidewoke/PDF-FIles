of backgrounds. ranging from large-scale Internet providers, the payments industry. financial services, and telecommunications, who continue to 
evolve our platforms and drive transformation today. The primary attributes of our technology and infrastructure include: 
• 
Clobalized Scale and Agility - The ever-changing business and regulatory landscape around the world demands an agile technology 
platform capable of adjusting to a myriad of changing requirements. Our platforms can quickly and seamlessly scale and adapt to those 
demands. 
• 
Worldwide Presence - First Data has 14 go-forward primary data centers located around the world focused on delivering its products 
and services. In addition to these facilities, there are also 18 smaller regional technology centers focused on the storage, security, and 
regulatory compliance of regional data governance requirements. 
• 
Worldwide Reach - First Data's global backbone spans every continent except Antarctica. In addition to our data center locations, we 
provide numerous client access points to allow for quick, cost-effective client onboarding. 
Our Infrastructure Modernization Initiatives 
Over the past 18 months, we have invested over $180 million into our Architecture Modernization Program (AMP), which has already 
begun to produce material results. We are currently midway into our 36-month program to complete a technology refresh of our core network 
infrastructure. security infrastructure. customer connectivity network, and North American and European mainframe environments. To date, this 
initiative has enabled us to: 
• 
Refresh 95% of our mechanical data center infrastructure and 70% of our electrical data center infrastnicture in North America: 
• 
Refresh 50% of all midrange computer platforms worldwide; 
• 
Refresh significant portions of our storage environments; 
• 
Begin moving all of the firm's call centers to Voice over IP (VOW) technology, resulting in significant operational efficiencies 
worldwide: 
• 
Virtualize nearly 70% of our existing server footprint; and 
Develop a platform where 65% of all new builds arc virtualized from the start. 
This infrastructure has been fully integrated with our mainframe and midrange computer environments to create a powerful product and 
services engine. 
Results of Our Initiatives 
We have combined our AMP program initiatives with an aggressive operating regimen, an acute attention to operational detail, and a 
focus on security to drive operational excellence. Some of the results from these initiatives include: 
• 
Data Center Consolidations - We have de-commissioned and consolidated five primary data center facilities over the last 18 
months These facilities include two locations in the United States, and three locations in Australia, Italy. and Argentina. We are 
scheduled to close five additional primary data center locations, one location in North America, three locations in Europe, and one 
location in South America within the next 18 months. These moves will result in greater operational and cost efficiencies for the 
business. 
• 
Data Center Optimization — We have removed approximately 60 tons of IT equipment from our data centers worldwide. This has 
resulted in the recapture of 15% of our global data center capacity, without the need for significant capital and operating expenditures.
