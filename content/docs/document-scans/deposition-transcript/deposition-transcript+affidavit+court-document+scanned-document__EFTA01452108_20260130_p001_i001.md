SOF III - 1081 Southern Financial LLC 
Partners from the Fund shall automatically and without any further action be subject to 
such a reservation of rights. 
6.5 
Distributions in Kind. 
(a) 
General. The General Partner shall only make distributions in cash or 
Marketable Securities during the Term. Upon the dissolution and winding up of the 
Fund, the General Partner may distribute any Securities or other property as distributions 
in kind pursuant to Section 11.2(a). In the event that a distribution of Securities or other 
property is made, such Securities or property shall be deemed to have been sold at their 
Value and the proceeds of such sale shall be deemed to have been distributed in the form 
of Distributable Cash to the Partners pursuant to Section 6.2. Distributions of any 
Securities or other property shall be made in proportion to the aggregate amounts that 
would be distributed to each Partner pursuant to Section 6.2. The General Partner may 
cause certificates evidencing any Securities to be distributed to be imprinted with legends 
as to such restrictions on Transfer as it may determine are necessary or appropriate, 
including legends as to applicable U.S. federal or state or non-U.S. securities laws or 
other legal or contractual restrictions, and may require any Partner to which Securities are 
to be distributed, as a condition to such distribution, to agree in writing (r) that such 
Partner will not Transfer such Securities except in compliance with such restrictions and 
(ii) to such other matters as the General Partner may determine are necessary or 
appropriate. 
(b) 
Legal, Regulatory or Contractual Restrictions Relating to Distributions in 
Kind. If any Partner would otherwise be distributed an amount of any Securities that 
would cause such Partner to own or control in excess of the amount of such Securities 
that it may lawfully own or control, would subject such Partner to any material regulatory 
filing or would raise material contractual or regulatory issues for such Partner, the 
General Partner may (I) cause the Fund, as agent for such Partner, to sell all or any 
portion of such Securities distributable to such Partner on behalf of such Partner or (II) 
deposit such Securities in a trust established by the General Partner for the benefit and at 
the expense of such Partner (with voting control and other terms that are satisfactory to 
such Partner). 
6.6 
Negative Partner Accounts. Except as otherwise provided in Section 9.2 
(and, solely with respect to the Special Limited Partner, Section 11.3), no Limited Partner 
shall be required to make up a negative balance in any Partner Account. Except as 
otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement or as required by law, the General 
Partner shall not be required to make up a negative balance in any Partner Account. 
6.7 
No Withdrawal of Capital or Repayment of Loans. Except as otherwise 
expressly provided in this Agreement, no Partner shall have the right to withdraw capital 
from the Fund or to receive any distribution of or return on such Partner's Capital 
Contributions or Loans.
