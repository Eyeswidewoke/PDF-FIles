Who Can Use the Program 
We are amending the Who Can Use the Program & Annual Fees sub-section of the About the Program section by deleting in 
their entirety the first two full paragraphs after the table and replacing them with: 
For a Business Card account, any Additional Business Card Members can be permitted to have their own separate 
program account by the Basic Business Card Member. In order to permit any Additional Business Card Members to 
have their own separate program account, the Basic Business Card Member must be enrolled in the program. We 
will cancel an Additional Business Card Member's participation in the program and, if applicable, separate program 
account if the Basic Business Card Member exits the program. Additional Card Members on a Consumer Card account 
must be enrolled by the basic Card Member. Eligible Corporate Card Members are only able to enroll in the program 
with a Corporate Card issued in their name. Enrolled Corporate Cards from the same company can't be linked to the 
same program account. 
Please note that if you already have a Card enrolled in Membership Rewards when you enroll a Business Charge or 
Credit Card, the Cards may be automatically linked. Additional Business Card Members who have a separate program 
account may not link other program-eligible Cards to the separate program account created for them as an Additional 
Business Card Member. 
Buying Points 
We are amending the Buying Points sub-section of the Getting Points section by inserting the below after the second 
sentence of the first paragraph: 
For Additional Business Card Members who have a separate program account, this fee will be charged to the Business 
Card account, for which the Basic Business Card Member is responsible to pay. 
We are amending the Buying Points sub-section of the Getting Points section by deleting the third and fourth sentences of the 
second full paragraph and replacing them with: 
If you have a Card enrolled in Membership Rewards when you enroll a second Card, the Cards may be linked to the 
same program account unless one or both of those Cards is enrolled in Membership Rewards through a separate 
program account created for you as an Additional Business Card Member. If the Cards are linked to the same program 
account, both Cards will be eligible for the benefits available to the Card with the greater benefits. 
Reinstating points forfeited for making late payments 
We are amending the For Making Late Payments sub-section of the Forfeiting and Getting Points Back section by inserting 
the following at the end of the second full paragraph: 
Points forfeited for late payment of a Business Card account (including points which would have been awarded to an 
Additional Business Card Member having a separate program account) can be reinstated only by the Basic Business 
Card Member on the Business Card account. The $35 fee will be charged to the Business Card account (for which the 
Basic Business Card Member is responsible to pay) to reinstate points which would have been awarded to all Card 
Members on the Business Card account for a billing period. 
Forfeiting and getting points back for canceling your account 
We are amending the For Canceling Your Account sub-section of the Forfeiting and Getting Points Back section by deleting 
the last 2 sentences in their entirety and replacing them with: 
If you voluntarily cancel your enrollment in the program (or if you are an Additional Business Card Member with your 
own separate program account and the Basic Business Card Member voluntarily cancels his/her enrollment in the 
program), but you keep at least one American Express® Card open and in good standing. you'll have up to 30 days 
from the date of cancellation to use any points in your program account. 
If you voluntarily cancel your enrollment in the program (or if you are an Additional Business Card Member with 
your own separate program account and the Basic Business Card Member voluntarily cancels his/her enrollment 
in the program) and you don't keep open any American Express Cards, all points in your program account will be 
immediately forfeited. 
Transferring points 
We are amending the Transferring Points to Frequent Customer Programs sub-section of the Using Points section by deleting 
the second and third sentences of the second paragraph of the Who can transfer points sub-section and replacing them with: 
If you have a Card enrolled in Membership Rewards when you enroll another Card, the Cards may be linked to the 
same program account unless one or both of those Cards is enrolled in Membership Rewards through a separate 
program account created for you as an Additional Business Card Member. If the Cards are linked to the same program 
account, both Cards will be eligible for the benefits available to the Card with the greater benefits.
