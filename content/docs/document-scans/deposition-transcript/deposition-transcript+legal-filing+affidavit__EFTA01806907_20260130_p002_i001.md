My view continues to be bearish - Japan, Libya, oil price, UK Q4 GDP declin=, US debt and unemployment, global 
inflation. I think there's now a good c=ance of a double dip recession and another shock of some sort - bank failu=e, 
sovereign debt crisis - Spain? What would be the result of this? Japan =tyle stagnation on one end of the scale, all the 
way through to genuine tu=moil on the other - economic collapse, riots. As you know I've built a com=ound in Thailand 
against the latter possibility. You need to check this vi=w with Natty Nat Nat Nat Nat, Lazards, and others you trust. 
Generally my =tance would be cautious. 
2. How might this effect global property prices? 
Unclear.The top end of the London market is currently strong because the ci=y is seen as a safe haven against 
trouble in the middle east. But I don't =hink Candy & Candy are selling much of their Number One Knightsbridge 
=evelopment. Similarly I bought my pussy cat a flat in a fabulous new devel=pment in Bangkok, the Sukothai residence, 
behind the Sukothai hotel. It co=t £1.5m which is a lot for Thailand and I believe sales are sluggish at =est. I don't know 
how strong the market is in Rio, what the local factors =re etc. I speculate there's quite a lot of wait and see at the top 
end of =lobal residential property markets. 
3. What's best practice for financing a property purchase? 
Well obviously buying for cash is best, but if you can't do this I'd be ver= wary about borrowing more than 50% 
as a point of principle. You then need=to work out in detail how the financing is going to work. What are the mon=hly 
interest payments? What happens if unforseen circumstances reduce your=income? By how much does your income 
have to reduce to threaten the paymen=s? What's the sensitivity to UK interest rate rises and currency fluctuati=ns? 
(Sterling depreciated by 25% against the baht as I was making the stag= payments for the Cat making the property about 
£250,000 more expensive)= What's the plan for re-paying the capital? What's the absolute downside i= security terms? 
le can the lending bank foreclose on other assets and wha= would be the effect of this? 
It's also necessary to be absolutely clear about total costs - ie, taxes on=purchase, agents costs, total realistic 
refurbishment costs, including con=ingency, on going taxes, service charge and other running costs. These the= need to 
be bundled into a composite number and the financing flows from t=is. 
So say in the case of the flat you're looking at the purchase price is £1=7m, and you're all in for £2m. (This feels 
low but I'm just using it for=example). Let's say you put up E500,000 cash and go to HSBC for E1.5m,=you then need to 
run all the sensitivities I've referred to above based on=this. It feels like quite a committment. 
Again, you must take other advice and make up your own mind, but you've see= what happens when people 
over extend their borrowings against property. T=at's why, irrespective of the attractiveness of the property and the 
appar=nt security of your current income, I always follow the 50/50 rule of thum=, and even then the detailed financing 
battle drill needs to be performed.=br> 
I hope this is helpful. Call if you'd like. Big kiss.
