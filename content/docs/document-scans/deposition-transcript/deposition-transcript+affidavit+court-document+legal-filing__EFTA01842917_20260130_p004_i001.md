Director is a terminating event which requires in-kind distributions of all 
remaining portfolio assets. If it is a terminating event, then probably need to 
limit decisions and actions that can be taken by the surviving Director. 
3. 
What if both Directors die at the same time, e.g., in a plane crash. How are 
operating and investment decisions to be made in that case? If both Directors die, 
who will continue to operate the Company even if it is just to distribute portfolio 
assets in kind to Investors? Should the death of either Director cause a termination 
of the Fund? just Ian's? 
4. 
Paragraph 2 - "Incapacity" - What does it mean to say a Director is 
incapacitated to "carry out his responsibilities as a shareholder" of HAL? The 
Directors of HAL are not its shareholders. Entities owned by those Directors are the 
shareholders. So, even if a Director of HAL that is connected to one of the 
shareholder entities becomes incapacitated, as a technical matter the incapacitated 
Director's shareholder entity may have other directors who can make decisions for 
that shareholder entity. So the "inacapacity" should not be determined by reference 
to the inability to act as a shareholder of HAL. It should Just say that if the Director 
is incapacitated in the more general sense - see comment 5 below - then paragraph 
2(A) triggers. 
5. 
Paragraph 2(A) - Please see the comments in points 2 and 3 above relating to 
death of Directors. The comments are equally applicable in the case of the 
incapacity of Directors as they are in the case of the death of Directors. 
6. 
Paragraph 2 defintion of "Incapacity" - Permits a registered medical 
practitioner who is treating the Director to make the decision about a Director's 
incapacity. What if there is a disagreement over incapacity? Should there be a 
provision to challenge to the determination of Incapacity? How does a medical 
practitioner know what is required to be physically or mentally capable to act as a 
shareholder or Director? Should there be a more generalized standard of Incapacity 
that is not specifically tied to serving as a shareholder or director of companies? 
Also, will it always be possible for a medical practitioner to predict that the 
incapacity may remain for more than three months? Why that time period? If they 
need to make investment decisions immediately what if a Director is Incapacitated 
presently but won't be for 3 months? Should there be a similar determination that 
the Director has resumed his capacity to make decisions? 
7. 
Deadlock/"Reasonable Endeavours" to Resolve/Call Option - should simply 
state that ian can buy Jacobs interest, 
at the following price„ Paragraph 3(A) 
provides that "In the event that a proposal is made by one Party or Director at either 
a shareholders' meeting or board meeting of the Company to which the other Party 
or Director does not agree within [7] days of such proposal being made (in each 
case being a "deadlock situation"), the Parties agree to use all reasonable 
endeavours to resolve the relevant deadlock situation within 14 days form the date 
[on] which the deadlock situation arose. Effectively this means that 21 days will 
pass while Jacob and Ian endeavor to resolve the deadlock. Paragraph 3(B) provides
