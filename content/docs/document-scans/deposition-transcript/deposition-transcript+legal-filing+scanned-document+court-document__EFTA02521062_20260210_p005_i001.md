dist=ibute propaganda about Islam and Islamic history which then filters down t=roughout textbooks for even younger 
students. It includes control over mos= of the nation's mosques and local Imams guiding the mess ages engaged 
Muslims are receiving. Most troublesome are the Muslim groups (CAIR, ISNA, MSA and others associated and/or joint 
venture partners =ith the Muslim Brotherhood) supposedly interested in "outreach =80 which know how to appear 
Westernized and interested in the goals of =estern Civilization. They have fooled a large part of our authorities and =edia 
due in part to their patience and willingness to chip away, one airpo=t prayer room, one frivolous intimidating lawsuit, 
one Congressman or CIA =fficer, one mosque, one ruling at a time. 
Particularly in the US, given our deep attachment to freedom as well as =ultural and psychological 
tendencies toward diversity, Western guilt =nd expectations of truthfulness, this effort is devious and difficult to u=root. 
The Civilization Jihadists present one face to the American public w=ich is completely at odds with their true agenda and 
how they deal in priv=te. Jamie, you and David and others such as Steve Emerson, Frank Gaffney, =ndy McCarthy and 
others have done s o much to uncover this level of Jihad that your readers should be urged to=review as much of their 
work (including Steve's recent excellent drcumentary, The Grand Deception <http://www.amazon.com/Jihad-America-
The-Grand-Dec=ption/dp/B009S93GQE> , and Fr=nk's important web video course, The Muslim Broth=rhood in America 
<http://muslimbrothe=hoodinamerica.com/about-frank-gaffney/> ) as possible. 
Finally, there is a third level — the International Institutiona= Jihad. Here the most powerful international 
institutions such as the UN a=d the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and others seek to push into Ame=ica from 
without those changes which are difficult to complete from within= The OIC is the largest Islamic institution in the world. 
It essentia=ly controls the vote in the UN's General Assembly and thus explain= in part the absurd and abject pro-
Islamic, anti-Israel thrust of that org=nizat ion. This level seeks to use the power of Islamic nations to work from outside 
the West to force changes within the West. While there are variou= conflicts between many of the nations, being Islamic 
majority states, the=e is a great deal they agree upon which becomes the focus of these efforts= Just as the Obama 
administration is beginning to cooperate with internati=nal efforts to control gun ownership, so has Hillary Clinton's 
Ist=nbul Process become a dangerous step in the effort to restrict speech crit=cal of Islam by norm (or possibly even 
treaty) when it may not be fully ex=cutable by domestic action alone. 
I should point out that Stephen Coughlin, the former Pentagon officer wh= has an important must-see 
presentation of Islamic Law, uses different nam=s for these same three levels —Jihad, Dawa, and Ummah. Had I seen=his 
work before I wrote my book I would have conformed to his categorizati=ns. 
We must learn how powerful language has become on all three levels. Word= such as "peace, $B!I 
"freedom," "terrorism," and phra=es such as "human rights" have different meanings for us a=d for our Islamic Enemy. 
To oversimplify, "peace" is not s=mething for now but that which comes when all the earth is submitting to I=Iam. In the 
context of battles, "peace" is at best a=C2 temporary ceasefire. "Freedom" is best understood as =aving the freedom to 
fully submit to Islam, not to choose whatever beliefs=one desires while respecting the same right in others. We've all 
s=en how "human rights" and "terror" re=lly only apply among Muslims, not to non-Muslims. Our enemy fully 
und=rstands these differences and uses them at all levels to paralyze us.=u> 
Look simply at how the phrase "Israeli-Palestinian conflict =80 has equalized the two parties, making it 
all the easier to ascribe f=atures of one to the other and view the problem as a simple-to fix division of ass ets into 
statehoods but for personality problems among the leaders. The sim=le truth is that this is and has always been a one-
sided Arab war against =srael as Ruth Wisse and others have described and, as Bibi Netanyahu made =tear, the ONLY 
state truly at issue here has been the State of Israel that=the Arabs have refused for over half a century. Nonetheless, 
the Control F=ctor hypnotically abuses the mind's susceptibility to the intricac=es of language. 
Even the label "Peace Process" has been damaging languag=. While most focus upon the first word, 
turning this into a "proce=s" has helped ensure that peace is never obtained. It is more appr=priately called the 
"Extortion Process" because all that r=sults is that violence is used over decades to extract concessions from Is=ael.
