From left, Joe McNeil, Franklin McCain, Billy Smith and Clarence Henderson, N.C. A&T State University students, on the 
second d=y of a sit-in campaign in 1960 when they asked for service at a whites-only counter at an F.W. Woolworth 
store in Greensboro. 
=hursday night an unsung American hero died. His simple act was sitting =t a Greensboro lunch counter and asking for 
coffee. With that action on Feb. 1, 1960, Franklin McCain Sr. and three fellow students from N.C. A&T State University 
became icons of the civil rights era and an inspiration to a generation of America=s. McCain, who was born in Union 
County and lived much of his life in Charlotte, died Thursday night in Greensboro afte= a brief illness. He was 73. That 
1960 visit to the F.W. Woolworth marke= the start of the sit-in movement, which spread across the South and gave 
renewed spark to the struggle for equal rights. A portion of the once whites-only lunch counter is at the Smithsonian 
National Museum of American History. And the old Greensboro store is now th= site of the International Civil Rights 
Center & Museum. "To the world, he was a civil rights pioneer who, along with his three classmates, dared to make a 
difference by starting the sit-in movement," his olde=t son, Franklin Jr., said Friday. "To us, he was Daddy — a man who 
=eeply loved his family and cherished his friends. We will forever treasure the wonderfu= memories that we have and be 
thankful for all that he did for us and for hi= fellow man." 
Harvey Gantt was a teenager in 1960. The Greensboro sit=ins inspired him and friends in his hometown of Charleston to 
do the same at lu=ch counters there. "(McCain) was one of the iconic figures of the civil rights movement who inspired 
a lot of people, including me," "will endure as a model of citizenship and f=eedom for this country whose Constitution 
begins, 'We the People.' " A poster at the International Civil Rights Center & Museum sums up the legacy. =93Before 
the march on Washington, Montgomery and Birmingham," it says, "there wa= the walk to Woolworth's." It was a 
seminal moment.

On that M=nday in 1960, McCain, then 19, and his friends —Joseph McNeil, Ezell Blair Jr. (now Jibreel Khazan) and David 
Richmond (who died in 1990)— walked a mile from the A&T campus to Woolworth.=A0 They bought a few items, 
toothpaste and a composition book for McCain, and asked for receipts. Then they sat at the whites-only counter. A 
white waitress and the store manager told them that they could not be served. A black woma= who cleared the counter 
told them to order food at the standup counter downstairs. An elderly white woman sitting at the counter got up and 
left. As she passed the four students, sh= put her right hand on McCain's shoulder and her left on McNeil's. McCain 
would recall a half-century later. "But then she said, 'Boys, I am so proud of you. I only wish you'd done this 10 years 
ago.' " 
The four stu=ents, later known as the Greensboro Four, left the counter shortly before closing time, vowing to return. 
Only McCain a=d McNeil showed the next day, with two other students they'd recruited. But as the news spread, the 
=it-ins grew. There had been other sit-ins, in places like Chicago and Wichita, Kan. But none had the galvanizing effect of 
that Febru=ry day in 1960. "It's an amazingly seminal, influential moment," said historian David Garrow. "It was 
emulated and copied in town after town after town. And it's fascin=ting to watch how the word spreads from 
Greensboro to Durham ... to Nashville (Tenn.). "So the re=I importance of it is as a classic example of a perfectly timed 
spark that moves scores of other black college students to ... start doing exactly the same thing."
