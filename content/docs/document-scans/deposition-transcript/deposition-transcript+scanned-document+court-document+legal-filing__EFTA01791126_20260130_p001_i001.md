Hi Jeff 
Here is my diary entry on VN 
Nabokov 
September 14, 1953 
I wandered into Lit 311 soon after I arrived at Cornell in September =953. It was not that I had any interest in European 
literature, or any =iterature. I was just shopping for a class that met on Monday, =ednesday, and Friday mornings so I 
wouldn't have any Saturday =lasses and "literature" also filled one of the requirements for =raduation. It was officially 
called European Literature of the =ineteen Century, but unofficially called "Dirty Lit" by the =ornell Daily Sun, since it 
dealt with adultery in Anna Karenina and =adame Bovary. 
The professor was Vladimir Nabokov, an emigre from Czarist Russia. =bout six feet tall and balding, He stood, with what I 
took to be an =ristocratic bearing, on the stage of the 250 seat lecture hall in =oldwin Smith. Facing him on the stage was 
his white-haired wife Vera, =ho he identified only as "my course assistant." He made it clear =rom the first lecture he 
had little interest in fraternizing with =tudents, who would be known not by their name but by their seat =umber. Mine 
was 121. He said his only rule was that we could not leave =is lecture, even to use the bathroom, without a doctors' 
note. 
He then described his requisites for reading the assigned books. He =aid we did not need to know anything about their 
historic context, and =hat we should under no condition identify with any of the characters =n them, since novels are 
works of pure invention. The authors, he =ontinued, had one and only one purpose: to enchant the reader. So all =e 
needed to appreciate them, aside from a pocket dictionary and good =emory, was our own spines. He assured d us that 
the authors he had =elected— Leo Tolstoy, Nikolai Gogol, Marcel Proust, James Joyce, =ane Austen, Franz Kafka, Gustave 
Flaubert and Robert Louis =tevenson— would produce tingling we could detect in our spines. 
So began the course. Unfortunately, distracted by the gorges, lakes, =ovie houses, corridor dates, and other more local 
enchantments of =thaca, I did not get around to reading any of Anna Karenina before =abokov sprung a midterm exam 
called a "prelim." It consisted of a =ingle essay question: "Describe the train station in which Anna =irst met Vronsky." 
Initially, I was stymied by this question because, having not yet read =he book, I did not know how Tolstoy had portrayed 
the station. But I =id recall the station shown in the 1949 movie starring Vivien Leigh. =aving something of an eidetic 
memory, I was able to visualize a =ulnerable-looking Leigh in her black dress wandering through the =tation, and, to fill 
the exam book, I described in great detail =verything shown in the movie from a bearded vendor hawking tea from a 
=ot-bellied copper samovars to two white doves nesting overheads. Only =fter the exam I learned that many of the 
details I described from the =ovie were not in the book. Evidently, director Julian Duvivier had =sed some poetic license 
in filming it. Consequently, when Nabokov =sked "seat 121" to report to his office after class. I fully =xpected to be 
failed, or even thrown out from Dirty Lit. 
What I had not taken into account was Nabokov's theory that great =ovelists create pictures in the heads of their 
readers that go far =eyond what they describe in the words in their books. (Perhaps this =heory accounted for the set 
decor and Vivian Leigh's sexy dress in =he movie.) In any case, since I was the only one in the exam to confirm his theory 
=y describing what was not in the book, he not only gave me an "A," =ut offered me a one-day-a-week job as an 
"auxiliary course =ssistant." Oddly enough, it also involved movies. Every Wednesday, =he movies changed at the four 
theaters in downtown Ithaca, called by =abokov "the near near," "the near far," "the far near," and "the far =ar." My 
task was to see all four new movies on Wednesday and Thursday, =nd then brief him on them on Friday morning. He 
said that since he had =ime to see only one movie, this briefing would help him decide which =ne of them, if any, to see. 
It was a perfect job for me, I got paid =or seeing movies. 
All went well for the next couple of months. I had caught up with the =eading, and greatly enjoyed my Friday morning 
chat with Nabokov in his =ffice on the second floor of Goldwin Smith. Even though it rarely =acted more than 5 minutes,
