Marriott Credit Card (16] statements for December 24. 2011-December 23. 2012 Mr. Francis also submitted Texas Credit 
Union statements for December 2012-January 2013 and Banco Popular statements for March-May 2013. which are outside the 
scope of investigation. 
17 See. Respondent's Exhibit 3A 
18 See. Respondent's Exhibit 3A 
Kellerhals concluded that Mr. Francis' spending habits increased drastically since the 
parties divorced on July 25, 2012, in violation of the Court's December 22, 2011 Order. 
Kellerhals opined that: 1) retirement funds are marital assets; 2) Mr. Francis' wasted 
marital assets by withdrawing money from his annuity early to cover his excessive 
spending in the amount of Two Hundred Twenty Thousand One Hundred Seventy Nine 
Dollars and Ninety Three Cents ($220,179.93); and 3) that Dr. Wright-Francis is entitled 
one half of the 'Wasted" amount of about One Hundred Ten Thousand and Ninety Dollars 
($110,090.00). 
Dr. Wright-Francis testified that Mr. Francis is not entitled to earnings resulting from her 
medical degree because the parties, collectively, paid off student loans by selling stocks 
that were jointly purchased. Dr. Wright-Francis also testified that she obtained her degree 
in 1992, just a year after [16] the parties were married. Dr. Wright-Francis further 
contends that she did not work for one (1) year in order to care for the parties' children in 
the early years. She contends that except for approximately two (2) to four (4) years, the 
parties' income were comparable. She confirmed her work contracts with the East End 
Medical Clinic and the Schneider Regional Medical Center. 
Dr. Wright-Francis acknowledged the purchase of a unit at the Towers Condominiums in 
Estate Contant on January 17, 2014, for which she currently collects a monthly rent. She 
confirmed that she continues to reside at IB-29 Estate Solberg with the parties' minor 
daughter. 
Dr. Wright-Francis informed the Court that she is seeking half of the value of the parties' 
marital homestead located at IB-29 Estate Solberg and half of the value of what Mr. 
Francis "wasted." She contends that Joan Francis does not have any ownership interest in 
the Solberg property ["24] and that the homestead should be sold if Mr. Francis is not 
able to buy her out. 
ANALYSIS 
[1] [HN1] In an action for divorce, this Court has the authority to equitably divide joint 
personal orooerty and real property, limited to the marital homestead as defined in Title 33 
V.I.C. § Ml(d). Bradford v. Cramer, 54 V.I. 669, 676 (V.I. 2011). Real property raj 
owned by the couple, other than the marital homestead, is divided by way of a civil 
partition action. Fuentes v. Fuentes, 38 V.I. 29, 1997 WL 889532 (Terr. V.I. 1997). When 
determining the equity of the distribution, the Court also has broad discretion to consider 
the case's most salient facts. Charles v. Charles, 788 F.2d 960, 965 (3rd Cir. 1986). The 
Supreme Court of the Virgin Islands further refined the Court's discretion to divide property 
by eliminating marital fault as a factor in dividing the homestead. Garcia v. Garcia, 59 V.I. 
758 (V.I. 2013). "The doctrine of equitable distribution is applied to effectuate a fair and
