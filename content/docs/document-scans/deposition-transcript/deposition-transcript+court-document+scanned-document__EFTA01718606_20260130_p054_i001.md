Epstein is pleading guilty to. and being sentenced rm. state offenses. not the redend offenses 
under which the government has unilaterally recognized these identified individuals as "victims". 
The notion that individuals whose names are not even known to the churning prosecutor in a 
state action should somehow be allowed to speak al a proceeding is unjustifiable. 
Furthermore. only after obtaining the executed Agreement did MS. I. 
begin 
e
insisting that the selected mprese 
lave 
duties go beyond settlement and inc u elitigating 
claims for individuals. In Ms. 
s Victims Notification letter, she slates that Mr. 
l'odhurst and Mr. Josefsberg, the selected attorney representatives. may "repreatnt" the identified 
individuals. This language assumes that the selected representatives will agree to serve in the 
capacity envisioned by Ms. 
• which is patently incorrect. Yet, neglecting the spirit of 
the negotiations: neglecting t e terms of the 
t: and neglecting commonly-held 
principles of ethics with respect to conflicts, Ms. 
continues to improperly emphasize 
that the chosen attorney representative should be able to litigate the claims of individuals. 
In a similar fashion. Ms. 
liability pursuant to the Agreement. Ms. 
liability even when claims with the identified individuals arc not settled just after the execution 
of the Agreement. Despite the fact that at that time. we obtained an agreement from you that Mr. 
P.pstein's waiver would not stretch past settlement. Ms. Es continues to espouse this 
erroneous interpretation.

began asserting that Mr. Epstein has waived 
E. 
aslIS
 and The Settlement Process. 
We are concerned that Ms. Villalitna has repeatedly attempted to manipulate the process 
under which Mr. E astein has a reed to settle civil claims. First. she inappropriately attem ted to 
nominate 
. for 
prose 
despite the fact that Mr. 
has 
a longstanding relationship with Ms. 
r 
rns out to be a very got 
personal 
friend and law school classmate of i. 
a fact she assiduously kept hidden 
mean counsel. We also learned from Ms. 
that she shared with 
the summary of 
charges the government was considering against Mr. Epstein. Even after your Orrice conceded 
that it was inappmpriatc tor is attorneys to select the attorney representative. Ms. Villafana 
co • ued to lobby for Mr. 
appointment. On October 19. 2007, retired 
who was appoint 
y t 
parties to select the attune re resentative. an ormt. 
r. 
• stem' •counsel that he received a telephone call from Mr.
directly requesting that 
appoint him as the *attorney representative in this matter.
Furthermore. recieral interference continues to plague the integrity or the implementation 
of the Agreement. We recently learned that despite the fact that there was no communication 
between state and federal authorities as to the investigation of Mr. Epstein. the FBI visited the 
State Attorney's (Alice two weeks ago to request that Mr. Epstein he disqualified to participate 
in work release even though the Agreement mandates that Mr. Epstein he treated as any other 
inmate.
