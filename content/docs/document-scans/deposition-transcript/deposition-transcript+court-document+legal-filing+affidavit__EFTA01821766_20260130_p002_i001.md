Language as a matter of binding forces, words as atoms (or hadrons), sentences as 
molecules or chains, paragraphs as more complex molecules, has fascinating 
implications. Of course in language, we'd be talking about recursive molecules as 
opposed to natural ones. (But "recursive molecule" is interesting in itself; a chain of 
chains, a crystal of crystals of crystals.) You might imagine that two versions of one 
sentence w/ the same meaning are two equally-stable conformations of one molecule, 2 
separate local minima; but a nonsense-sentence is unstable; & translation would be a 
chemical transformation. 
In your canoe-view, moving horizontally from your stream to someone else's is like moving from 
a mountain brook to the Hudson to the Niagara; your sudden transit sideways to 
another stream, though it lands you in another texture of time (a parallel time) (& 
smashes your canoe), puts you at the exact same moment you were at. Times texture 
changes, but you don't miss a tick.... 
Does it bother you that sexuality, once the driving force of art, has been suppressed? Modigliani 
the last erotic painter; de Kooning a farcial encore; Giacommetti, whose early sadist 
surrealist pieces turn into a view of women as immovable obstacles (men move; 
women stand in their way); then, silence (in the establishment), as if beautiful women 
were no longer the fuel source of all human creativity. (But they always will be.) 
Scale: attchd painting is 18x24 inches; belongs to Roger Hertog (an Art Saint); works well as an 
object to look at. But I'm now making a much larger version, approx 4x6 feet; & in a 
sense, it looks at you. It colors the space it occupies, Stead of being a thing on a 
wall. Wholly different feel. 
It was great to talk to you (When you get a chance pls give me a mail addr so I can send you a 
bk.)

recognize, I am unaware of a formula for stories for both content and time.. I thought 
more about the idea that nightmares are as a canoe moving orthogonally through 
moving streams. but realize the time components of the streams do not line up. maybe 
its more of landing in the water after various streamfalls ( like abbot and costello , 
slowly i turned , step by step -Niagra streams). and coming in contact with many 
pieces of many streams with various times. ( even more interesting , would be to be 
in contact with the streams of others ).. Like a trip on Maid of the Mist.
