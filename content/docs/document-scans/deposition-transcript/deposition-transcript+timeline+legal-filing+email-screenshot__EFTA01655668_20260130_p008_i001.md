Fox News (03/03, Whitten) reported that a federal subpoena has been issued requesting records from self-
proclaimed "super mayor" Tiffany Henyard and others as authorities pursue a criminal investigation tied to the 
ousted mayor. According to the article, the subpoena was signed on Feb. 25, the day Henyard, a Democrat, lost the 
mayoral primary in Dolton, Illinois, by a landslide. The subpoena is tied to a development project involving land 
once reportedly owned by Henyard's boyfriend. The summons demanded a number of documents from 2014 until 
now, including copies of citations, code violations, emails, phone calls and text messages between property 
owners, tenants and village personnel. It also requested correspondence between property owners, tenants 
and village of Dolton personnel. The personnel included Henyard's boyfriend, Kamal Woods. The subpoena is the 
latest development in an ongoing federal probe into the activities of Henyard while she was serving as village 
mayor and township supervisor. 
San Antonio Bookkeeper Arrested by FBI Again 
The San Antonio Express-News (03/03, Danner) reported that the FBI has arrested a San Antonio bookkeeper for 
the second time on suspicion that she committed another scheme to steal from companies she was working for in 
recent months. According to the article, Monica Marie Padilla, 47, who was arrested on 30 criminal charges in 2023 
and had been free on a $20,000 unsecured bond, saw her bond revoked Monday during a hearing before U.S. 
Magistrate Judge Elizabeth "Betsy" Chestney. Chestney cited evidence of Padilla's "dishonest, deceptive and illegal 
behavior" while on bond in ruling that she should remain locked up pending her trial. 
Frontier Airlines Passenger Who Punched Window and Was Restrained by Crew and Other Fliers Is 
Charged 
Business Insider (03/03, Syme) reported that a Frontier Airlines passenger could be given a prison sentence after 
being restrained midflight by other travelers last month. Raul Ramos Tamayo, 31, was on Frontier flight 4856 from 
Denver to Houston, per an affidavit from an FBI special agent. About 30 minutes after takeoff, he started punching 
the seat in front of him, witnesses are said to have told the FBI. After crew members approached him, Tamayo is 
alleged to have started punching a window, resulting in damage. According to the article, the affidavit stated that 
the cabin crew then asked for help from any law enforcement officers or able-bodied passengers, several of whom 
helped restrain Tamayo with flex cuffs around his wrists and ankles. Tamayo was then put back into a seat and 
surrounded by the passengers who subdued him for the rest of the 2Y2-hour flight, it added. Officers from the 
Houston Police Department met the flight at the gate at George Bush Intercontinental Airport. Tamayo was charged 
with destruction of aircraft or aircraft facilities. If convicted, he could face a lengthy prison sentence and a fine of 
up to $250,000. The FBI affidavit cited an internal airline report that said the damage included a cracked window, 
broken window shade, and broken outer lining of the window. The total cost of the damage was estimated at 
$1,546. 
New York Cop Allegedly on Mafia Payroll 'Sold His Badge to the Bonanno Crime Family' 
The New York Post (03/03, Schnitzer, Janoski) reported that ex-Nassau County cop Hector Rosario "sold his badge" 
to the mob — then helped his associates evade the law "time and time again," federal prosecutors said Monday. 
Assistant US Attorney Sean Sherman told a federal jury during closing arguments at Rosario's trial that the allegedly 
dirty cop took $1,500 per month from the Bonanno crime family, then "lied to cover it up." "He lied to hide 
information about illegal gambling and organized crime," Sherman said, adding that Rosario was a "cop in name 
only" and lied to the FBI more than 30 times when the feds interviewed him about his illicit activities in January 
2020. According to the article, Rosario, 51, has been charged with obstructing a grand jury probe into racketeering 
and lying to the FBI as he allegedly conspired to target rival Genovese and Gambino mafiosos during a feud that 
erupted after a profit-sharing scheme between the families went south. 
Continued Reporting: FBI Looking for More Victims of East Memphis Doctor 
WREG (CBS-3) (03/03, Arthur) reported that the FBI is looking for more potential victims of Dr. Sanjeev Kumar, who 
they say were patients at the Poplar Avenue Clinic. On Friday, Kumar was indicted on 23 counts of allegedly 
coercing people into sexual acts, healthcare fraud, and reusing single-use devices on patients. Investigators believe 
he targeted patients between September 2019 and April 2024. The FBI says the doctor who owns the clinic 
specializes in oncology and gynecology. The article mentioned that allegations against Kumar are laid out in a 28-
page indictment. One allegation said, "Kumar reused hysteroscope medical devices marked as 'single use' on his 
patients without properly cleaning, disinfecting, and/or sterilizing." These devices were not cleared by the FDA to 
be reprocessed or reused. This practice saved the doctor money, as investigators allege. "Kumar increased his 
profits by not replacing the single-use devices after every use," said another allegation.
