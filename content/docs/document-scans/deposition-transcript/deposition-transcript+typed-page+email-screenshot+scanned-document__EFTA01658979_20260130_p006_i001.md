so far. Democrats "have continued to dominate the initial balloting, but Republicans are 
narrowing the gap. GOP voters have begun to show up as early in-person voting, a sign that 
many heeded [Trump's) unfounded warnings about mail-voting fraud." 
On ABC World News TonightVi (10/25, story 2, 3:20, Llamas, 4.45M), Stephanie Ramos 
reported that this weekend saw "early voting breaking voter turnout records across the country. 
More than 93,000 voters turned out to the polls on the first day of early voting" in New York 
City, where "massive lines stretched for blocks, with voters determined to make their ballot 
count." The CBS Weekend NewsVi (10/25, story 5, 2:55, Yuccas, 9.26M) reported on absentee 
votes being cast by Americans outside the US. 
Texas Supreme Court Stays Order Blocking Abbott's Limit On Ballot Dropoff 
Sites. The Dallas Morning News (10/25, 946K) reports the Texas Supreme Court has stayed a 
lower court's order that had blocked an order by Gov. Greg Abbott (R) "limiting counties to one 
mail ballot drop-off site. The decision followed a ruling Friday by Texas' Austin-based Third 
Court of Appeals that had upheld a state judge's order blocking Abbott's order. The state had 
appealed the Third Court of Appeals order." The state Supreme Court "was still reviewing 
whether to take further action in the case and ordered both sides to file their responses by 5 
p.m. Monday." 
Reuters (10/23, Brice) reports the Texas 3rd Court of Appeals on Friday "ruled the 
Republican governor cannot limit drop-off sites for mail ballots to one per county, a setback for 
U.S. President Donald Trump." The court concurred with a "lower court that limiting the number 
of drop boxes would increase the risk that voters could get infected with COVID-19, and would 
infringe on their right to vote." Texas Gov. Greg Abbott "has informed the voting rights groups 
who oppose his move to limit drop boxes that he intends to quickly appeal Friday's ruling to the 
Texas Supreme Court, effectively delaying the re-opening of ballot drop-off locations." 
Boston Ballot Dropbox Set On Fire. The Boston Globe (10/25, 972K) reports, "A 
ballot drop box outside the Boston Public Library was set on fire early Sunday morning, 
according to state and city officials, who say it appears to be a deliberate, criminal attack and 
called it a 'disgrace to democracy." The fire "was set around 4 a.m. in the Copley Square drop 
box." 
Pennsylvania Supreme Court: Mail-In Ballots Can't Be Rejected Over Signature 
Discrepancy. Reuters (10/23, Pitas) reports Pennsylvania's Supreme Court "ruled on Friday 
that mail-in ballots cannot be refused because a voter's signature does not appear to match the 
one on file, a decision that could help Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden." The court 
ruled, "(We) hold that county boards of elections are prohibited from rejecting absentee or 
mail-in ballots based on signature comparison conducted by county election officials or 
employees, or as the result of third-party challenges based on signature analysis and 
comparisons." According to Reuters, "Democrats hailed the move while Republicans were 
critical." 
Voter Advocates Drop Suit Against Ohio Rule Limiting Drop Boxes. The AP 
(10/23, Smyth) reports that "a coalition of voter advocacy groups dropped a lawsuit Friday 
against Ohio's strict rule limiting ballot drop boxes to one location per county, a coup for 
President Donald Trump's reelection campaign in a key battleground state." The A. Philip 
Randolph Institute, the American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio, and the League of Women Voters 
of Ohio "made the decision after the federal appellate court in Cincinnati set a timetable last 
week that pushed further activity in the case past Election Day." Ohio ACLU Legal Director Freda 
Levenson "said that would 'obviously be too late."
