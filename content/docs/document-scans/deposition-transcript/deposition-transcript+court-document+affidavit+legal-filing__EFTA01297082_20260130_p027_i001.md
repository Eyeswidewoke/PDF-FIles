2014 V.I. LEXIS 45, *; 61 V.I. 13, ** 
(Headnotes classified to Virgin Islands Digest] 
1. Divorce § 11.50--Division of Property--Power of Court In an action for divorce, the 
court has the authority to equitably divide joint personal property and real property, limited 
to the marital homestead. Real property owned by the couple, other than the marital 
homestead, is divided by way of a civil partition action. When determining the equity of the 
distribution, the court also has broad discretion to consider the case's most salient facts. 
The Supreme Court of the Virgin Islands further refined the court's discretion to divide 
property by eliminating marital fault as a factor in dividing the homestead. The doctrine of 
equitable distribution is applied to effectuate a fair and just division of the property between 
the parties. As its name suggests, eqiaole distribution does not necessarily mean 
"equal," only "equitable." 33 V.I.C. § 
(d). 
2. Property § 15.05--Homestead--Generally A homestead is defined as the abode 
including land and buildings, owned by, and actually occupied by, a person, or by 
members of his family free of rental charges. Although the Virgin Islands Code does not 
expressly define a marital homestead, both the United States Court of Appeals for the 
Third Circuit and the Appellate Division of the United States District Court for the Virgin 
Islands have interpreted the applicable statute to hold that a "marital homestead" is any 
homestead in which a husband and wife both reside during the marriage and that is owned 
by one or both of the spouses. 33 V.I.C. § 
a), (c). 
3. Property § 15.30--Homestead--Divorce When the divorcing parties had lived in the 
marital homestead for 7 years of their 21-year marriage, the husband's mother occupied 
an apartment on the property, the wife had the means to secure alternative housing and 
had not shown the need or desire to remain there, and the husband had acquired the 
["14] property from his mother, the husband was awardaossession, minus an award 
to the wife for her interest and contributions. 33 V.I.C. § 
4. Divorce § 11.50--Division of Property--Power of Court The court may distribute 
personal property in accordance with the statute governing final orders in divorce cases. 
However, the statute does not define marital property. Whether an asset is marital property 
or separate property for purposes of distribution of the marital estate is a matter reserved 
to the sound discretion of the trial court. Once these distinctions have been made, the trial 
judge has broad equitable powers in disposing of marital property. 16 V.I.C. § 109. 
5. Divorce § 11.70--Division of Property--Types of Property Interests Although not 
specifically defined, marital property has been construed to encompass any property which 
the couple acquired during the marriage and which is subject to equitable distribution upon 
divorce. 
6. Divorce § 11.45--Division of Property--Pensions Considering the tremendous 
statutory examples and case law from other jurisdictions holding pension funds as marital 
property, the Virgin Islands has determined that a pension fund is marital personal 
property, subject to claim by the other spouse upon divorce. To the extent earned during
