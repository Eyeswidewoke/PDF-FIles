The New York Times (11/23, Dewan, 18.61M) reports while Ashley Diamond, a transgender 
woman was "serving time in Georgia for nonviolent offenses," the Georgia Department of 
Corrections "[denied] her hormone therapy, hous[ed] her with male prisoners and fail[ed] to 
protect her from sexual assault" for years. Then, the Department "changed its treatment policy, 
released Ms. Diamond on parole and reached a settlement in her lawsuit." But, Diamond "was 
sent back to prison about a year ago for a parole violation. Once again she has been housed 
with men, and says she has been sexually assaulted more than 14 times since her return, 
according to a federal civil rights lawsuit filed on Monday by her lawyers at the Center for 
Constitutional Rights and the Southern Poverty Law Center."

level Mexican drug cartel leader as part of a deal to get US drug trafficking charges against 
Cienfuegos dropped." Lopez Obrador said at a news conference, "There is no deal in the 
shadows." He "said it was wrong to suggest that the United States sent Cienfuegos back so that 
Mexico would send Washington a leader of organized crime."
