of virtue. Take courage. It is a continuum. The craven, who fear too much, lie at one 
end and the foolhardy, who fear too little, at the other. A sensible person seeks the 
ground in between: valor. 
But what are cravenness, valor, and foolhardiness? They resist iron 
encirclement, he admits. Yet he is not now in the realm of logic, but elsewhere, he says, 
and mist speak in terms which thwart sharp definitions. In fact, they aren't even 
necessary. "Our statement of the case will be adequate," he declares, "if it be made 
with all such clearness as the subject-matter admits; for it would be as wrong to expect 
the same degree of accuracy in all reasoning's as in all manufacturers." With topics such 
as character and ethics, "we must be content to indicate the truth roughly and in 
outline.i14 There is no hairline. Concepts wash over into each other, valor subtly 
merges into foolhardiness (i.e., nonvalor), and both laws dissolve. 
He goes even further. Excess specificity, he says, leads to error, for "an educated 
person will expect accuracy in each subject only so far as the nature of the topic allows." 
In other words, some subjects are simply vaguer than others, and we must fit the level 
of precision to the topic at hand. This statement comes very close to Zadeh's law of 
Compatibility. 
Apples in the Refrigerator 
Of course, on a day-to-day level, everyone constantly deals with propositions 
that are neither true nor false. Will it rain tomorrow? Regardless of determinism, the 
answer is uncertain for all practical purposes. Yet most people want to hear it, since the 
chance of rain affects their plans. In the latter 1600x, scholars began mathematicizing 
such uncertainties, and here too they followed Aristotle's laws. They created 
probability. 
Probability is Aristotelian because it works with atoms of yes and no. A flipped 
coin is either heads or tails. A playing card falls into one of 52 categories and its identity 
is never vague. Thus, probability obeys the twin laws. A flipped coin can't be heads and 
tails, and it must be either heads or tails. A card can't be both the king of diamonds and 
the king, and must be one of them. 
In mapping our vagueness, Max Black employed probability, perhaps because it 
was the dominant uncertainty tool at hand. He stated that if 80 percent of people say 
Tom is tall, then he is tall to 0.8 extent. At bottom lies the yes/no atom: Is tom tall? 
This approach differs fundamentally from fuzziness and yields different results. 
Suppose Sally considers Tom 0.8 tall. She will probably always call him tall. Suppose a 
thousand people believe Tom is 0.8 tall. Ask them, "How likely are you to call Tom mil?" 
and every one might say, "100 percent." Yet they would all think he is 0.8 tall. Each is 
rounding off from 0.8 to 1, so the final figures describe word usage, not degree of truth. 
Zadeh distinguished fuzziness from probability in his 1965 paper. Both describe 
uncertainty numerically, he said. However, probability treats yes/no occurrences, 
requires ignorance, and is inherently statistical. Fuzziness deals with degrees, does not 
require ignorance, and, he added, is completely nonstatistical.
