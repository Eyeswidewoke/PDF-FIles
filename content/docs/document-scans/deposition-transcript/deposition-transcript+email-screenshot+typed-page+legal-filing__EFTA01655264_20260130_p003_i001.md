about soon," Deputy Director Bongino wrote in a post on X on Tuesday. "We're finding them and crushing their 
operations. More to come. Thanks to our U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration partners for the coordination." The 
article noted that Deputy Director Bongino also took to X earlier this week with statistics he says demonstrate the 
FBI's heightened focus on violent crime and illegal immigration "is working." Over the last few months, the FBI has 
seized 22% more illicit drugs than in the same period last year, including more than 97,000 pounds of cocaine, over 
7,000 pounds of meth and more than 2,500 pounds of fentanyl, he wrote. KTTC (NBC-10) (07/09, McCabe) 
and KMSP (Fox-9) (07/09, Wermus) also reported on the story. 
Continued Reporting: Trump Administration Targets Comey and Brennan With New Investigation 
The New York Times (07/09, Thrush, Barnes) reported that the Trump administration is targeting former FBI 
director James B. Comey and former CIA director John O. Brennan, who oversaw the investigation into the 2016 
Trump campaign's connections to Russia. According to the article, CIA director John Ratcliffe made a criminal 
referral of Brennan to the FBI, accusing him of lying to Congress, while the FBI is also scrutinizing Comey's role in 
the Russia investigation. The article noted that even if it is unclear whether the moves will lead to charges, they are 
among the most significant indications that President Trump's appointees intend to follow through on his campaign 
to exact retribution against his perceived enemies. The article added that the investigation comes at a precarious 
moment for the appointed leadership of federal law enforcement agencies. Since Monday, Trump supporters on 
the far right have lashed out at Attorney General Bondi and FBI brass for closing the investigation into the death of 
the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein. Fox News (07/09, Wallace, Doocy, Singman) reported that during a meeting 
with African leaders in the State Room of the White House on Wednesday, Fox News senior White House 
correspondent Peter Doocy asked the president for his response to the investigation. "Do you want to see these 
two guys behind bars?" Doocy asked the president. "Well, I know nothing about it other than what I read today," 
Trump said. "But I will tell you, I think they're very dishonest people. I think they're crooked as hell. And, maybe 
they have to pay a price for that. I believe they are truly bad people and dishonest people," the president added. 
"So whatever happens, happens." The article highlighted that the full scope of the criminal investigations into 
Brennan and Comey is unclear, but two sources described the FBI's view of the duo's interactions as a "conspiracy," 
which could open up a wide range of potential prosecutorial options. Additional reporting on the story was 
provided by Axios (07/09, Falconer), AFP (07/09, Staff Writer), CNN (07/09, Perez, Lillis), Fox News (07/09, Kornick), 
The Daily Beast (07/09, Ornedo), The Independent (07/10, Marcus), NBC News (07/09, Dilanian, Reilly, Luce), New 
York Post (07/09, Nelson), the New York Times (07/09, Thrush, Barnes), the Washington Post (07/09, Roebuck, 
Stein, Nakashima), and the Washington Times (07/09, Picket). 
What to Know About the Jeffrey Epstein Saga 
CNN (07/09, Rabinowitz) reported that Jeffrey Epstein was a billionaire and convicted sex offender who was 
accused of sex trafficking and pedophilia, and had connections to powerful individuals, including Prince Andrew, 
Bill Clinton, and Donald Trump. Epstein died in his jail cell in 2019, with his death ruled a suicide, but many 
conspiracy theories have emerged questioning the circumstances of his death and alleging that he had a "client 
list" of powerful individuals who participated in his alleged crimes. A recent Justice Department memo found no 
evidence of a "client list" or credible evidence that Epstein blackmailed prominent individuals, and released 
jailhouse security footage showing no one entered Epstein's cell on the day he died, but the findings have been 
met with backlash. The article highlighted that conspiracy theories have not subsided and were often pushed by a 
myriad of right-wing figures, including Director Patel and Deputy Director Bongino. News Nation Now (07/09, 
Djordjevic) reported that Sigrid McCawley, an attorney representing people suing Jeffrey Epstein's former 
accountant — one of the last Epstein cases in federal court — believes the government is sitting on a "treasure 
trove" of information regarding the convicted sex offender. "What's really just astonishing about this recent 
disclosure from the government is that they know they are sitting on a treasure trove of information, and they're 
not turning it over," McCawley told "Elizabeth Vargas Reports" on Wednesday. "I've worked on these cases for over 
10 years now; there's a plethora of information that the public has not been able to see relating to Epstein and his 
co-conspirators," McCawley added that the information ranges from financial records to other telling information 
from computers and other items that could help understand how Epstein ran a sex-trafficking scheme for more 
than two decades without conviction. She criticized the Trump administration for what she believes is contradictory 
action to its rhetoric that it would be "an open book" administration dedicated to exposing the truth. Fox News 
(07/09, Ruiz) added that Jeffrey Epstein's brother, Mark Epstein, is disputing the official finding that his brother 
killed himself in federal custody. Mark Epstein calls an FBI memo defending the suicide ruling "stupid" and believes 
his brother was murdered, citing inconsistent autopsy findings and his brother's upcoming bail hearing. Additional
