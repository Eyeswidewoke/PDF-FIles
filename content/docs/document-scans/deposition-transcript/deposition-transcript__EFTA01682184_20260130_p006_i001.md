Detectives received complaints that private eyes were posing as police officers. When they told Epstein's local attorney, 
Guy Fronstin, he said the investigators worked for Roy Black, the high-powered Miami lawyer who has defended the likes 
of Rush Limbaugh and William Kennedy Smith. 
While the private eyes were conducting a parallel investigation, Dershowitz, the Harvard law professor, traveled to West 
Palm Beach with information about the girls. From their own profiles on the popular Web site MySpace.com, he obtained 
copies of their discussions about their use of alcohol and marijuana. 
He took his research to a meeting with prosecutors in early 2006, wheie he sought to cast doubt on the teens' reliability. 
The private eyes had dug up enough dirt on the girls to make prosecutors skeptical. Not only did some of the girls have 
issues with drugs or alcohol but also some had criminal records and other troubles, Epstein's legal team claimed. And at 
least one of them, they said, lied when she told police she was younger than 18 when she started performing massages 
for Epstein. 
After the meeting, prosecutors postponed their decision to take the case to a grand jury.ln the following weeks, police 
received complaints that two of the victims or their families had been harassed or threatened. Epstein's legal team 
maintains that its private investigators did nothing illegal or unethical during their research. 
By then, relations between police and prosecutors were fraying. At a key meeting with prosecutors and the defense, 
Detective 
, the lead investigator, was a no-show, according to Epstein's attorney.By then, relations 
between po ice an prosecutors were fraying. At a key meeting with prosecutors and the defense, Detective 
the lead investigator, was a no-show, according to Epstein's attorney. 
'The embarrassment on the prosecutor's face was evident when the police officer never showed up for the meeting," 
attorney Jack Goldberger said. 
Later in April, Recarey walked into a prosecutor's office at the state attorneys office and learned the case was taking an 
unexpected turn. 
The prosecutoMlia. 
told 
the state attorney's office had offered Epstein a plea deal that would not 
require him to serve jai me or receive a e 
y conviction. 
Recarey told her he disapproved of the plea offer. 
The deal never came to pass, however. 
Future unclear after charge 
On May 1, the department asked prosecutors to approve warrants to arrest Epstein on four counts of unlawful sexual 
activity with a minor and to charge his personal assistant, 
, now 27, for her alleged role in arranging the 
visits. Police officials also wanted to charge 
the se 
escn d Heidi Fleiss, with lewd and lascivious acts. 
By then, the department was frustrated with the way th
 office had handled the case. n the same day 
the warrants were requested, Palm Beach Police Chief wrote 
a letter to State Attorney 
suggesting he disqualify himself from the case if he would not act. 
Two weeks later, Recarey was told that prosecutors had decided once again to take the case to the grand jury.it is not 
known how many of the girls testified before the grand jury. But Epstein's defense team said one girl who was 
subpoenaed &mdash; the one who said she had sexual intercourse with Epstein &mdash; never showed up. 
The grand jury's Indictment was handed down in July. It was not the one the police department had wanted.The grand 
jury's indictment was handed down in July. It was not the one the police department had wanted. 
Instead of being slapped with a charge of unlawful sexual activity with a minor, Epstein was charged with one count of 
felony solicitation of prostitution, which carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison. He was booked into the Palm 
Beach County Jail early July 23 and released hours later. 
Epstein's legal team -doesn't dispute that he had girls over for massages," Goldberger said. But he said their claims that 
they had sexual encounters with him lack credibility. 
'They are incapable of being believed," he said. "They had criminal records. They had accusations of theft made against 
them by their employers. There was evidence of drug use by some of them?
