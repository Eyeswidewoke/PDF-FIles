by his need to be outside of New York for tax reasons. That was the principal purpose of his 
travel: to be certain not to be present in New York in excess of half of each year. That he chose 
Florida as his destination was a function of his decision made long ago to maintain a home there, 
which also was not motivated by any desire to or intention to engage in prohibited sexual 
activity. Epstein has maintained a connection to Florida for nearly 30 years, the last seventeen as 
a homeowner. Prior to that Epstein rented homes in the area. Epstein's parents also lived there 
for years and, before his mother's death in 2004, especially during the four years of illness that 
led to her death (his father died earlier), Epstein frequently traveled to see her. Since their 
deaths, he has traveled to Florida specifically to visit their graves. Epstein's brother, too, 
maintains a home in Palm Beach County. 
Indeed, Epstein has been traveling there regularly, integrating into the Palm Beach 
community. He was a member of The Breakers Club from 1993 to 2006. He maintains bank 
accounts in Florida, including accounts at the First Bank of the Palm Beaches, in which bank he 
had an ownership interest, as well. He holds a concealed weapons permit from the State of 
Florida; maintains the corporate records of his two airplanes in Florida, which airplanes receive 
virtually all of their scheduled maintenance work in Florida; has titled and registered twelve 
automobiles in Florida, as well as his boat; the majority of all demonstrations and inspections of 
new aircraft and boats have been done in Florida; until recently has maintained a driver's license 
in Florida; and he employs pilots who reside in Florida. So ensconced in Florida is he that his 
regular physician is based in Florida and most medical procedures he has had performed over the 
years have been done in Florida. Foundations he controls have donated generously and regularly 
to Ballet Florida during the period from 2000 to 2007. 
Epstein also uses his home in Florida for meeting regularly with important business 
contacts, many of whom either live or maintain residences in the Palm Beach area. Beginning in 
2003 and continuing through most of 2004, Epstein also traveled frequently to Florida to 
negotiate the purchase of the Abraham Gosman Estate, which was finally sold at auction in 
November 2004. Although, Epstein was ultimately outbid, nearly a dozen trips to Florida were 
made in direct pursuit of his offer. 
In furtherance of these activities — being out of New York for in excess of half of each 
year, visiting his mother and brother, meeting with business associates, and negotiating the 
purchase of the Gosman Estate — Epstein made 65 separate trips to Florida in 2004 and 20058. 
There trips are reflected on the flight records previously provided to you. We are not reproducing them 
; here because of their bulk. If you would like an additional copy we will provide it.
