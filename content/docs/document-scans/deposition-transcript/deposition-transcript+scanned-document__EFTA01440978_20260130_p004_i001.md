Form W-9 (Rev. 11-2017) 
Page 2 
By signing the filled-out form, you: 
1. Certify that the TIN you are giving is correct (or you are waiting for a 
number to be issued), 
2. Certify that you are not subject to backup withholding, or 
3. Claim exemption from backup withholding if you are a U.S. exempt 
payee. If applicable, you are also certifying that as a U.S. person, your 
allocable share of any partnership income from a U.S. trade or business 
is not subject to the withholding tax on foreign partners' share of 
effectively connected income, and 
4. Certify that FATCA code(s) entered on this form (if any) indicating 
that you are exempt from the FATCA reporting, is correct. See What is 
FATCA reporting, later, for further information. 
Note: If you are a U.S. person and a requester gives you a form other 
than Form W-9 to request your TIN, you must use the requester's form if 
it is substantially similar to this Form W-9. 
Definition of a U.S. person. For federal tax purposes, you are 
considered a U.S. person if you are: 
• An individual who is a U.S. citizen or U.S. resident alien; 
• A partnership, corporation, company, or association created or 
organized in the United States or under the laws of the United States; 
• An estate (other than a foreign estate); or 
• A domestic trust (as defined in Regulations section 301.7701-7). 
Special rules for partnerships. Partnerships that conduct a trade or 
business in the United States are generally required to pay a withholding 
tax under section 1446 on any foreign partners' share of effectively 
connected taxable income from such business. Further, in certain cases 
where a Form W-9 has not been received, the rules under section 1446 
require a partnership to presume that a partner is a foreign person, and 
pay the section 1446 withholding tax. Therefore, if you are a U.S. person 
that is a partner in a partnership conducting a trade or business in the 
United States, provide Form W-9 to the partnership to establish your 
U.S. status and avoid section 1446 withholding on your share of 
partnership income. 
In the cases below, the following person must give Form W-9 to the 
partnership for purposes of establishing its U.S. status and avoiding 
withholding on its allocable share of net income from the partnership 
conducting a trade or business in the United States. 
• In the case of a disregarded entity with a U.S. owner, the U.S. owner 
of the disregarded entity and not the entity; 
• In the case of a grantor trust with a U.S. grantor or other U.S. owner, 
generally, the U.S. grantor or other U.S. owner of the grantor trust and 
not the trust; and 
• In the case of a U.S. trust (other than a grantor trust), the U.S. trust 
(other than a grantor trust) and not the beneficiaries of the trust. 
Foreign person. If you are a foreign person or the U.S. branch of a 
foreign bank that has elected to be treated as a U.S. person, do not use 
Form W-9. Instead, use the appropriate Form W-8 or Form 8233 (see 
Pub. 515, Withholding of Tax on Nonresident Aliens and Foreign 
Entities).
