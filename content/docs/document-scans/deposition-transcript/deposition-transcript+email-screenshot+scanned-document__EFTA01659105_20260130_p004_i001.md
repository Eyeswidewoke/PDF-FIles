LEADING THE NEWS 
US Charges 15 Reputed Mobsters In Pennsylvania, New Jersey. 
NJ News (11/23, Atmonavage, 1.72M) reports, "More than a dozen alleged organized crime 
members and associates were indicted Monday on charges of operating a criminal enterprise in 
Philadelphia and southern New Jersey, the U.S. Attorney's office of the Eastern District of 
Pennsylvania announced. The superseding indictment alleges members of La Cosa Nostra based 
in Philadelphia engaged in "acts of illegal gambling, loansharking, drug trafficking, and 
extortion, among other crimes, for the purposes of enriching the organization and its 
members." In total, 15 organized crime members and associates were indicted Monday." NJ 
News adds, "While the indictment mostly focuses on the organization's activities in Philadelphia, 
it alleges that La Cosa Nostra used its reputation and influence `to exercise control over criminal 
rackets, like bookmaking and loansharking' in southern New Jersey, particularly Atlantic City." 
The Inquirer (PA) (11/23, Vella, 347K) reports, "The Philadelphia mob has limped along 
on life support for the past decade, its former leaders, Joseph `Uncle Joe' Ligambi and Joseph 
`Skinny Joey' Merlino, out of the picture after high-profile federal prosecutions," but "reports of 
La Cosa Nostra's demise have been greatly exaggerated, according to a federal grand jury 
indictment unsealed Monday by U.S. Attorney William M. McSwain. In fact, the mafia was 
adding new soldiers to its ranks as recently as 2015, prosecutors say, in ceremonies overseen 
by veterans of those former regimes." The Inquirer adds, "Fifteen mobsters have been indicted 
on racketeering, extortion, gambling and drug trafficking charges, according to the indictment. 
Chief among them is Steven `Stevie' Mazzone, 56, the reputed underboss of the organization 
who once served under Ligambi." 
The New York Post (11/23, Rosenberg, Sheehy, 4.57M) reports, "A reputed wiseguy 
nicknamed `Tony Meatballs' is among more than a dirty dozen alleged South Philly mobsters 
charged in a sweeping federal indictment unsealed Monday. The suspects are accused of 
everything from illegal sports betting to heroin-peddling to offering loans at 400 percent 
interest - not to mention plotting to kidnap and possibly murder a drug dealer to save their 
reputations after the guy sold them fake narcotics." The Post adds, "Anthony `Tony Meatballs" 
Gifoli, 72, was named in the superseding grand-jury indictment along with others including 
accused La Cosa Nostra underboss Steven `Stevie' Mazzone and alleged capo Domenic `Mr. 
Hopkins' Grande, the feds said. Underlings targeted by the indictment include Louis `Louie 
Sheep' Barretta, Joseph `Joey Electric' Servidio and Daniel `Harry' Castelli, the FBI said." 
The Garfield-Lodi (NI) Daily Voice (11/23) reports, "Over the past five years, in fact, new 
leadership of the Philly and Atlantic City La Cosa Nostra beefed up the ranks, commanding 
illegal sports gambling, extorting victims through loansharking, selling cocaine, heroin and 
opioids - even conspiring to kidnap a drug dealer who sold them bad dope, they said. The FBI 
in Philadelphia began building a new organized crime case in October 2015. That's when, the 
indictment says, Mazzone joined" Grande, 41, and Mazzone, 55, "in a ceremony inducting 
several new soldiers at a South Philly residence."
