As we say in the law, Mr. Green has arrived. TMZ has reported that the amount is in the 
neighborhood of $10 million, to which Uchitel responds, Clearly I have no comment. 
There is speculation that Uchitel must know truly devastating details to warrant that kind of agreement, 
though in texts and e-mails between Uchitel and Woods that have already emerged, the golfer 
sounds like a man having an affair with one woman, not fifteen: I finally found someone I 
connect with, someone I have never found like this. Not even at home, he allegedly wrote. 
Fuck. Why didn't we find each other years ago. We wouldn't be having this conversation. 
Uchitel has had previous relationships with famous men, Derek Jeter and David Boreanaz, according to 
friends and gossip that she will neither confirm nor deny. But people who know the score (as 
opposed to scumbags who like to get close to the scandal, as Uchitel describes the other set of 
talkers) say that the hosts don't generally get involved with the clients. There are one-offs, yes, 
things happen, people develop crushes, they fall in love. But for the most part, women in 
Uchitel's position don't sleep with their clients. They don't have to. There are plenty of willing 
girls. Younger girls and drunker girls. 
Next: What the current clubs for the rich and famous in New York are. 
In New York, the current clubs for the rich and famous and those who want to meet them are 'Oak, 
Avenue, Provocateur, and SL. Rose Bar and Boom Boom Room don't do bottle service and are 
thus considered on the outskirts of its culture, though the latter, with its notoriously tough door 
policy, is the most exclusive late-night venue in town. Greenhouse, Juliet, Tenjune, and the rest 
are middle-of-the-road. Former hot spot Marquee is virtually off the radar for the cool crowd, 
having been all but replaced by its ownersNoah Tepperberg and former Uchitel beau Jason 
Strausswith Avenue. Clubs have a short life span, and generally the owners of one that's gone 
stale will open another instead of revamping the old, keeping the old one around to make 
money off the people who couldn't get in when it was hot. 
On a recent Thursday night around 2 a.m., 'Oak is packed. The tables, U-booths near the D.J., are 
spotted with candles and spired with bottles of Grey Goose. Under the jaundiced glow of the 
spotlights, there are hands on rears and girls in small dresses and men in shiny striped shirts. 
They have carefully chosen their clothes and they have spent time in front of mirrors trimming 
hair from nostrils and tonight is about sex and status and supply and demand and have and 
have not. After Jay-Z and Lady Gaga have had their third and fourth plays of the evening, 
thumping up from the floor comes the Kings of Leon, their song Use Somebody. The general-
admission crowds dance, and the table crowds dance a little more woodenly, a little more 
entitledly, with their finger pads on their tables. The promoters are dancing with the models 
and the waitresses are dancing with the bottles and everybody finds a place on the floor. 
The floor people, they are just to fill the place up. The celebrities and the athletes and the tycoons are 
the ones for whom this world is zealously designed. A rung below in after-work pinstripes are 
the money guys, the Deutsche guys and the Goldman guys and the no-name hedge-fund 
guysthe whalesguys like that one over there in a Boss suit and John Lobb shoes, standing beside 
the table that cost him $3,000. Standing very close to it, like a Little Leaguer who wants to steal 
second but has never done it before. This gentleman's not dancing, but he's thinking about it. 
Soon Beyonce will call all the single ladies to action and they will channel toward him in a 
centripetal swoosh. 
The women. Models at the top, near-models who have not made it yetwho have done a catalogue, 
maybeare a step below, straight-haired and Louboutin-heeled, tanned and bored and exacting.
