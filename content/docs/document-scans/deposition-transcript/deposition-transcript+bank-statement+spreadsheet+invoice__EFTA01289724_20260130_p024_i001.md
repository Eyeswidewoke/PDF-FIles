account. Please see the money market mutual fund's prospectus or the bank deposit product's disclosure document or contact your advisor for additional information. Pursuant to SEC 
Rule 10 b-10 ( b)( 1) confirmations are not sent for purchases into money market mutual funds processed on the sweep platform.
