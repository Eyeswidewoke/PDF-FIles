The Washington Post (11/23, Zauzmer, 14.2M) reports DC Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) 
"announced a ban on indoor gatherings of more than 10 people - including Thanksgiving 
dinners," and the new restrictions "come as caseloads have spiked across the greater 
Washington region, where the seven-day average number of cases Monday hit a record for the 
20th consecutive day." The order will also "ban live entertainment and indoor exercise classes." 
The Los Angeles Times (11/23, 4.64M) reports that Los Angeles County "reported a new 
all-time high for daily cases on Monday: 6,124," and L.A. County Public Health Director Barbara 
Ferrer is warning that new restrictions could be implemented soon. She "did not immediately 
commit to implementing a stay-at-home order," but said that she will be meeting with the 
County to discuss options. 
Under the headline "Covid's Persistence Leads GOP, Democrats To Half Measures," 
Bloomberg (11/23, Chess, Palmeri, 4.73M) reports that while "the gulf between Republican and 
Democratic governors was vast" when the pandemic first spread, as "allied with President 
Donald Trump, most Republicans refused to impose basic public-health restrictions such as 
mask-wearing, while Democrats closed huge swaths of their states' economies." However, 
Bloomberg adds "many" governors now "find themselves implementing similar, somewhat half-
hearted, measures - a bipartisan weariness aimed less at deep change than easing the strain 
on medical systems and buying time until a vaccine arrives." 
In an analysis headlined "The Virus Cared A Lot Less About Politics Than The Politicians 
Did," the Washington Post (11/23, Bump, 14.2M) says that despite President Trump's 
prediction, "Democratic governors and mayors didn't scale back containment efforts" after the 
election, as "there weren't many such efforts in place," but "the more important factor was that 
the new surge was already underway. As of writing, the number of new cases being recorded 
each day on average is nearly five times the rate on Sept. 12. Since Nov. 3, three weeks ago, it 
has nearly doubled." The Post says the increase "has meant not only" that Trump's claim "was 
wrong, but that even Republican officials skeptical of imposing restrictions have decided to 
implement new guidelines aimed at stopping the virus's spread." 
SCOTUS To Decide This Week On Whether To Hear Case On New York's 
Corona virus Restrictions. The Wall Street Journal (11/22, Vielkind, Subscription Publication, 
7.57M) reports the Supreme Court this week is expected to decide on whether it will hear the 
Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn's challenge to New York's coronavirus restrictions enacted 
last month. 
Utah Relaxes COVID Restrictions. The Hill (11/23, Coleman, 2.98M) reports Utah 
Governor Herbet "announced on Monday that the state was removing the two week-old 
mandate against casual social gatherings of those from different households, instead making it 
a recommendation." He said, "You increase the risk when you bring people into your home that 
are from outside the four walls of your house. That's just the harsh reality." 
Michigan County Approves Resolution Supporting Impeachment Of Governor 
Over Corona virus Restrictions. The Hill (11/23, Choi, 2.98M) reports the Kalkaska County 
Board of Commissioners "voted 4-2 on a resolution backing calls for" Michigan Gov. Gretchen 
Whitmer's (D) impeachment. Kalkaska County David Comai "blamed what he called Whitmer's 
'unconstitutional executive orders' for Kalkaska's economic crisis." However, Michigan GOP 
legislators "have indicated they do not support efforts to impeach Whitmer." Michigan Speaker 
Lee Chatfield said, "I thought it was shameful what the Democrats did to President Trump last 
year, and I would assume that any attempt by Republicans right now, with the current set of 
facts that we have to impeach the governor, would be on the same level." 
Virginia Man Charged After "Forcefully Exhaling" On Two Women. Politico (11/23, 
4.29M) reports Raymond Deskins "was charged with misdemeanor assault" after he was "seen 
forcefully exhaling on two women outside President Donald Trump's Virginia golf course." 
Footage of the incident "shows Deskins blowing air on two unidentified women after one of 
them asks him to get away and points out that he's not wearing a mask."
