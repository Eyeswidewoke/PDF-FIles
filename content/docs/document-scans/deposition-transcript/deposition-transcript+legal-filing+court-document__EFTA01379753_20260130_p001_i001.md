2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 29508, * 
For Production No. 8 and an indication that the documentation is all of the responsive 
documentation in the possession, custody, or control of the defendant. 
Interrogatory No. 15 and Request for Production No. 11: The Court finds this inquiry to 
be relevant. The Takata Defendants have agreed to determine what, if any, customer 
complaint information related to the seat belt restraint system at issue in this litigation they 
have in their possession and contact plaintiffs' counsel to attempt to reach a resolution 
related to the same. If a resolution cannot be reached, a phone call will be scheduled with 
the Court. 
Interrogatory No. 16: Takata shall determine how many vehicles contain the retractor 
involved in this litigation and, if Takata determines that listing the number of vehicles is 
overly burdensome, it shall notify the Court and request that the Motion as to this 
interrogatory be denied on that basis. If Takata determines that the number of vehicles is 
not overly burdensome to produce, it shall list the vehicles containing the retractor in a 
verified supplemental response. 
Request for Production 12: The Court finds that this request seeks relevant information, 
and therefore [*1 5] documents responsive to this request shall be produced, only to the 
extent the Takata Defendants contend that there are differences in safety performance 
between the restraint system used by Takata Defendants in the 2005 GMC Yukon and 
other restraint systems used by Takata Defendants, with the same retractor employed in 
the 2005 Yukon, in other SUV-type vehicles. This information is relevant for plaintiffs to 
show substantial similarity for other incidents involving SUVs using the same seat belt 
system (i.e. a system that uses the same retractor used in the 2005 GMC Yukon). Unlike 
the facts of the Gibson case cited by the defendants -- where the plaintiffs failed to present 
sufficient support to demonstrate the similarity of the products at issue -- the plaintiffs in 
the present case seek discovery of seat belt systems with the same "pertinent 
characteristics," as they relate to the accident at issue. Takata Defendants will only need 
to produce records if they contend that their seat belt systems used in SUVs, despite using 
the same retractors, somehow perform differently from the seat belt system in the 2005 
Yukon. If the Takata Defendants contend that there are no differences in [*16] terms of 
safety performance, then the Takata Defendants will not have to produce any documents 
in response to this request. 2
2 In addition. the Gibson case is not binding authority on this court. 
Request for Production 13: The court finds that this request seeks relevant information, 
so long as the information on rollover research and development is limited to seat belt 
systems using the same retractor as the retractor used in the 2005 GMC Yukon. However, 
request 13.03, which relates to research and development regarding the effectiveness of 
pretensioning devices in protecting occupants in a rollover, will not be limited to only seat 
belt systems using the same retractor. The Takata Defendants shall respond to this 
request — which relates more directly to the spool out allegation and the existence of a 
safer alternative design — in its current form.
