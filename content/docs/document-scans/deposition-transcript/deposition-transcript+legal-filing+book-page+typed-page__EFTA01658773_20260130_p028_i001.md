The CBS Evening NewsVi (11/11, lead story, 3:00, O'Donnell, 4.25M) reported, "Things 
are now so dire in places like Missouri and Wisconsin, at least one out of every three people 
tested is positive. More than 1,400 people have been killed by the virus in just the past 24 
hours. That's the most to die in one day in months. The death toll is now growing so fast, one 
model says it will reach 400,000 by February." 
The Hill (11/11, Hellmann, 2.98M) reports the US "reported 136,000 new cases of COVID-
19 Tuesday, the largest single-day increase on record, according to a tracker by Johns Hopkins 
University." Almost 62,000 people "were hospitalized with COVID-19 nationwide as of Tuesday, 
according to the COVID Tracking Project, a record-high number and a sobering indicator that 
increases in deaths are soon to come." Every single state is seeing a rise in COVID cases. The 
Wall Street Journal (11/11, Al, Evans, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) reports experts say 
hospitals across the US are facing more capacity issues amid the resurgence of COVID-19 
infections. The number of patients hospitalized on Tuesday passed the 60,000 recorded in April. 
The Washington Post (11/11, Fears, Achenbach, Martin, 14.2M) says the "number of 
patients hospitalized nationally with covid-19...is near the peak of the first wave in the spring, 
and has already surpassed the numbers driven by illnesses in the Sun Belt during the summer 
surge. The nation also set another record Wednesday for new daily coronavirus infections, as 
confirmed by testing, with 145,835, according to Washington Post data." Of the hospitalized 
patients, "nearly 3,000 are on ventilators - more than double the number of ventilated patients 
as of Oct. 1, according to The Post's coronavirus tracking data." 
The New York Times (11/11, Al, Stolberg, Weiland, LaFraniere, Jacobs, 18.61M) says the 
pandemic "caught the nation flat-footed in March, but epidemiologists have been warning for 
months of a fall and winter wave as people are driven indoors, schools resume in-person 
classes and Americans grow tired of months of precautions." However, "shortages of personal 
protective equipment are back, especially among rural hospitals, nursing homes and private 
medical practices that lack access to the supply networks that serve larger hospital chains." 
Texas Becomes First State To Log More Than IN Confirmed COVID Cases. The 
AP (11/11, Crary) reports Texas has become "the first state with more than 1 million confirmed 
COVID-19 cases, and California closed in on that mark as a surge of coronavirus infections 
engulfs the country from coast to coast." Texas "has recorded 1.01 million coronavirus cases 
and over 19,000 deaths since the outbreak began in early March, according to data compiled by 
Johns Hopkins University. California, the most populous state, has logged more than 991,000 
cases." 
On the CBS Evening NewsVi (11/11, story 3, 1:05, O'Donnell, 4.25M), Janet Shamlian 
reported that in El Paso, "almost one of every 10 people have been infected" with COVID. The 
New York Times (11/11, Goodman, 18.61M) reports that in El Paso, the University Medical 
Center "set up tents to care for patients in a parking lot. A downtown convention center 
became a field hospital. To free up even more space, the state began airlifting dozens of 
intensive care patients to other cities." The town "now has more people hospitalized with Covid-
19 than most states - 1,076 as of Tuesday — and is more than doubling its supply of mobile 
morgues, to 10 from four." According to the Times, "The situation reflects the broader difficulty 
of trying to battle a national crisis in the absence of a national strategy. In El Paso, an urban 
island in remote West Texas between borders with Mexico and New Mexico, that absence has 
been acutely felt." 
California Set To Surpass 1M COVID Cases By Thursday. The Los Angeles Times 
(11/11, Money, 4.64M) reports California, meanwhile, "is on the cusp of surpassing 1 million 
confirmed coronavirus infections — a milestone demonstrating both the toll the pandemic has 
taken so far and the dangers it continues to pose." As of Wednesday morning, California "had 
reported just over 991,000 total coronavirus cases, according to the Los Angeles Times' 
tracker." The state saw an average of 6,377 new cases per day over the last week, "including 
8,307 on Tuesday alone. That rate, far higher than a month ago, puts California on pace to 
surpass the 1-million mark by Thursday."
