information." The press release quoted Assistant Director in Charge Steven J. Jensen of the FBI's Washington Field Office: "Lee allegedly violated 
his duty to protect the United States in favor of providing national defense information to the Russian government. The FBI is steadfast in our 
commitment to protect U.S. national security and bring to Justice those who seek to undermine it." Additional reporting on the story was provided

Planned Dinner for Trump Officials to Discuss Epstein Appears to Have Been Moved Amid Media Scrutiny 
CNN (08/06, Holmes, Treene) and Fox News (08/06, Deppisch, Spunt. Gibson) reported that a dinner scheduled at Vice President JD Vance's 
residence was seen as an opportunity for Trump administration officials, including AG Bondi and Director Patel, to realign and clear the air amid 
the ongoing Jeffrey Epstein scandal. The dinner, which was expected to include White House chief of staff Susie Wiles and Deputy Attorney 
General Todd Blanche, was intended to be an informal, low•stakes situation where the administration could discuss its handling of the Epstein 
case and craft a unified response. The articles explained that the dinner's status was uncertain as of Wednesday afternoon, with administration 
officials saying it might be called off, moved to another location, or rescheduled due to intense media coverage, despite Vance's office denying that 
the meeting was ever scheduled. The articles highlighted that the dinner was seen as a chance for AG Bondi and Director Patel to resolve their 
tense relationship, which had been strained over their differing responses to the Epstein scandal, including a contentious White House meeting 
last month where Deputy Director Bongino's future with the administration was also questioned. The administration's handling of the Epstein 
case, including the potential release of an audio recording and transcript of Blanche's conversation with Epstein accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell, 
was expected to be a main focus of the dinner, with Vance playing a peacemaker role to help the officials present a unified front. The article added 
that the feud between AG Bondi, Director Patel, and Deputy Director Bongino had been building for months, with FBI officials criticizing AG Bondi 
for spending more time talking about the Epstein case on Fox News than actually reviewing the files, and Director Patel and Deputy Director 
Bongino facing backlash from the MAGA right after the release of a memo that contradicted conspiracy theories surrounding the investigation. 
Tulsl Gabbard Declassified Documents Over CIA Objections, Sources Say 
NBC News (08/06, Luce) reported that National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard declassified a document on Russia's interference in the 2016 
election over CIA objections, citing concerns about protecting sensitive spying sources and methods. According to the article, the declassified 
document included relatively few redactions and revealed details about eavesdropping and human sources with insights into Russian President 
Vladimir Putin's views. Former intelligence officers, including Michael Van Landingham and Larry Pfeiffer, have expressed alarm that the 
declassification could put intelligence•gathering efforts at risk and compromise sources. The article highlighted that a bipartisan Senate 
intelligence report in 2020 endorsed the intelligence community's analysis that the Kremlin sought to help Trump win the election. A special 
counsel appointed by Trump in his first term, john Durham, reported no evidence of a criminal conspiracy by the Hillary Clinton campaign or the 
Obama administration to undermine Trump with false information. Additional reporting on the story was provided by The Washington 
Post (08/06, Strobel), The New Republic (08/06, Houghtaling), Lawfare (08/06, DiResta), Raw Story (08/06, Burris), The Daily Beast (08/06,

WITN (NBC-7) (08/06, Staff Writer) reported that Dawan McKinzie, a former state correctional officer, has been sentenced to five years in federal 
prison after pleading guilty to conspiring to distribute methamphetamine and possession of methamphetamine with intent to distribute. In 
addition to his prison term, McKinzie will serve four years of supervised release. The case stems from a joint investigation by the FBI and DEA,

psilocybin mushrooms, cocaine, tobacco, suboxone, a cellphone, and nude photographs—all of which he intended to smuggle into the facility.
