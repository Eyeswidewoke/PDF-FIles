ok with that.

with Jeffrey.=20 Maz will be able to explain and give you an idea of the money we are talking. 
Which Jeffrey? I m confused now

Hear wha= he has to say at least. 
XX : Amanda, I ve spoken to Charles today and he said that you 1. Wanted to offer me a modeling job 2. Told him you 
knew me personally... Neither of this is true... If it wasn't about him - why would you put=20 his name at the top of the 
text? Are you his new girlfriend trying to get information from me... If so - I m the wrong person to ask now. I m sorry, I 
think our conversation is finished. To cut it short: 1. I don'= want to make story about charles. 2. I don't know anything 
about "jeffrey" you mention. Best, XX
