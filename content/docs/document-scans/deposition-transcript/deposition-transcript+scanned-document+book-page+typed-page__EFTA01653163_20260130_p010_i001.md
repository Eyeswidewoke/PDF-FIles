Saturday." The Washington Post (11/16, Al, Itkowitz, Jaffe, 
Kranish, Harris, 14.2M) reports on its front page that Morrison 
also "told House investigators in sworn testimony that he 
feared leaks of the contents of the July 25 call between 
President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr 
Zelensky would be damaging, so he recommended restricting 
access to the transcript." According to the Post, "Morrison, an 
expert on Russia and Ukraine who served on the National 
Security Council before leaving the job at the end of October, 
said he knew immediately after listening to the call in which 
Trump asks Zelensky to investigate former vice president Joe 
Biden and his son Hunter that they needed to keep it under 
wraps." 
The Wall Street Journal (11/16, Volz, Duehren, 
Andrews, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) reports Morrison's 
claim that he spoke to the NSC's top lawyer, John Eisenberg, 
and his deputy, Michael Ellis, collaborates the whistleblower's 
complaint in August that the White House took action to limit 
access to the call transcript. In addition, USA Today (11/16, 
Wu, 10.31M) reports that although the President recently 
"attempted to distance himself from Sondland, telling 
reporters 'I hardly know the gentleman,' Morrison's account 
"suggests dose contact between Trump and Sondland on 
Ukraine." 
According to the AP (11/16, Mascaro), Morrison's 
account "provided new insight on what others have called a 
shadow diplomacy being run by Trump's personal lawyer, 
Rudy Giuliani, often at odds with U.S. national security 
interests." The AP adds Morrison "described a Sept. 1 
meeting Sondland held with a top Zelenskiy aide, Andriy 
Yermak, on the sidelines of a summit in Warsaw," and that 
Sondland later "told him that 'hat could help them move the 
aid was if the prosecutor general would go to the mike and 
announce that he was opening the Burisma investigation.'" 
Politico (11/16, Cheney, Hounshell, 4.29M) reports Morrison's 
account "adds weight to the version of events that the current 
top U.S. envoy to Ukraine, William Taylor, told lawmakers 
both in a closed door deposition and during public testimony 
on Wednesday." 
Meanwhile, Politico (11/16, Desiderio, Zanona, 4.29M) 
reports Williams "told investigators in early November that 
she took notes while she listened in on Trump's July 25 
phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky from 
the White House Situation Room, adding that she viewed 
Trump's requests for investigations as politically motivated." 
Reuters 
(11/16, 
Wolfe, 
Bose) 
reports 
Williams 
"testified...Trump's insistence that Ukraine carry out politically 
sensitive investigations 'struck me as unusual and 
inappropriate."' 
The Washington Post (11/16, Sonne, Dawsey, 14.2M) 
states that Sondland's actions "after Trump called Zelensky 
and exhorted him to investigate...Biden — will be scrutinized in 
public testimony Sondland is scheduled to give this week at 
the impeachment inquiry." 
WSJournal Analysis Examines Origins Of Trump's 
Skepticism Toward Ukraine. 
In an analysis headlined 
"Trump's View Of Ukraine As Corrupt Took Shape Early," the 
Wall Street Journal (11/16, Salama, Ballhaus, Subscription 
Publication, 7.57M) considers how the President came to 
hold critical views of Ukraine, according to Administration and 
foreign officials. 
Additional Commentary On Whistleblower 
ISsueB. 
The Washington Post (11/13, Stanley-Becker, 
14.2M) reports in an analysis that as the impeachment inquiry 
"has unfolded behind closed doors, two dueling narratives 
about the president's actions have remained distinct." One 
hinges on "a whistleblower complaint...about a shadow 
foreign policy to undermine conclusions about Russian 
interference in the 2016 election and damage one of Trump's 
2020 rivals, former vice president Joe Biden." The other "has 
played out in conservative media and on Trump's own Twitter 
feed." It "relies largely on conspiracy theories and cover 
stories...about Ukraine's influence in the 2016 election and 
Biden's reasons for going after a Ukrainian prosecutor, who 
was widely viewed by Western powers as corrupt.' The Post 
says the "two divergent worlds collided on Wednesday in 
stark fashion with the start of the probe's public hearings.' 
Politico's Harris: Hearing Was "Brutal" For Trump. 
Politico (11/13, 4.29M) founding editor John Harris writes in 
his column that impeachment is "a brutal exercise in 
psychological exposure." Wednesday's hearing 'Was a 
portrait — a vivid one, in an especially grave setting — of 
Trump being Trump: obsessive, hectoring, contemptuous of 
process and propriety, as bluntly transactional about military 
aid to a besieged ally as he would be about a midtown real 
estate deal.' 
Breitbart: Democrats Suffered "Clear Political 
Loss" Wednesday. Breitbart (11/13, Boyle, 673K) reports 
Wednesday's hearing Vas widely panned as the two career 
diplomats who testified failed to offer clear allegations of 
wrongdoing against President Donald Trump, and Democrats 
running the show found themselves on defense in response 
to the Republicans in the minority who were aggressive and 
effective in pushing their counter-narrative.' However, 
"despite the clear political loss on Wednesday, Schiff is 
persisting. The next hearings begin on Friday, and then next 
week there will be another round of public testimony." 
Opinion: Government Deep State Isn't What You 
Think, And America Really Needs It. In an op-ed in USA 
Today (11/14, 10.31M), Angela Kendall-Taylor writes, "Trump 
and administration officials have sought to distract attention 
from the allegations against the president by questioning the 
whistleblower's motives and portraying the person, reported 
to be a U.S. intelligence officer, as part of a so-called deep 
state conspiracy. As a former CIA analyst and Deputy 
National Intelligence Officer for Russia and Eurasia who 
worked on Russia and Ukraine for nearly a decade, I believe
