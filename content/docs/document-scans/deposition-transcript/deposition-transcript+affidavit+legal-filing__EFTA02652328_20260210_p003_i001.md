Another proposal is the one I suggested. True, =here are some arcane tax issues, but these can 
easily be resolved, as your=lawyer can explain to you, with common consent among the beneficiaries -- =hich means 
your consent. 
</=pan> 
There are, of course, other possi=ilities. I could pursue legal measures to have the trust used in 
the=manner in which it was intended. I could also look into the disburse=ents that have been made to family members 
(so I have learned) without inf=rming me, and could look into why I haven't been receiving any income =rom the trust 
for years (until I finally raised the question), and why inv=stments were made the way they were done, yielding long-
term returns that =ould be of no use for me, highly irregular for an elderly person -- which,=as I wrote you, greatly 
surprised financial advisers I consulted when I fi=ally began to pay attention. And, furthermore, why I never received 
=ny statements about what was going on for years, until I finally asked wha= is going on with the trust. And perhaps 
other matters that evidentl= concern you, as shown by your request for protection for past actions.Q=A0 But I haven't 
yet shifted to your domain and still reta=n some illusions about family relations. 
Th=re are other matters that I've written to you about several times, wit= no response, which 
means I presume that you do not want to hear them.Q=A0 They don't specifically have to do with this matter, so if you 
have=gotten this far in the letter, you can stop here. But they are on my=mind, and I want to clear the air -- if anyone 
wishes to look. 
<=r> 
My father could die in peace, knowing his children would ensu=e that his wife would be taken 
care of. I =on't have that luxury. 
No lawyers or w=rds were necessary. It was simply obvious that we would hand over to=her 
what there was of an inheritance, the house and everything in it.40=A0 And of course we were very pleased that he had 
joy and companionship in=his last years. 
Valeria and I are very happy toge=her, apart from what you are doing, which is naturally 
extremely painful.=C240 She left her friends and family, and a professional life. I ha=e almost no pension, as I described, 
and it terminates when I die. A=cordingly, I have to deal with concerns that my father, luckily for him, n=ver had to 
consider. 
The situation is not only ex=remely painful, but in fact surreal. I could never have imagined tha= 
anything like this would happen in my last years.

I'd like to put together a proposal that I think wou=d address some of your needs and ease our 
communications. The propos=l would give you some additional access to the trust assets. It woul= also include 
appointing a new independent trustee to replace Max. H=wever, it would not terminate the trust, and I would remain 
as one trustee= 
Are you interested in seeing such a proposal?
