HUM is an independent investment advisor registered under the Investment Advisors Act of 1940. The Collateral Yield Enhancement Strategy Composite ("CYES, includes all accounts invested in I4VM's index 
put spread and call spread option overlay strategy. OYES seeks to generate returns by "harvesting" the time decay of option premium by actively managing a portfolio of short-dated index option spreads on the 
SA P500 index (SPX). OYES sells options to generate premium/income while simultaneously purchasing further outel.themority strikes to contain and quantify risk. Client accounts are established by transferring 
collateral (in the form of cash, US government obligations. municipal bonds and/or equities) owned by the client that becomes a notional basis for KVM's index option overlay strategy. The (YES Composite was 
created in April 2006. 
Net-of-Fees Returns are presented net of actual investment management fees and are calculated using the notional value of the accounts. The standard investment management fee is 0.50% per year of each 
accounts notional value with a performance fee of 10% of each account's annual net return. Actual investment management fees incurred by clients may vary. The composite contained less than 2% or fewer of 
non fee paying accounts during each year. 
No benchmark data has been presented since there is no opportunity cost of capital committed when using any of the overlay strategies. 
Valuations are computed and performance is reported in US dollars. Policies for valuing portfolios, calculating performance, preparing compliant presentations, and a list of composite descriptions are available 
upon request.

overlay exposure for overlay accounts rather than the minimum collateral needed to implement the overlay.
