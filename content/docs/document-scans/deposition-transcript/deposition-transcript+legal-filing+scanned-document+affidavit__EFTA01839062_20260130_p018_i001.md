judges Stephanie Ausbart and Mathieu Vigneau in Lille had authorized the use of secret 
electronic intercepts to gather information about the previously-mentioned prostitution ring in 
Lille. Their targets included two close associates of DSK's, Jean-Christophe Lagarde, the police 
commissioner, and the businessman Fabrice Pazskowski, who had supplied DSK with at least one 
cell phone. (Both of these men would eventually be arrested in what would be known in the media 
as the Carlton Affair.) DSK, though friends with these men, never attended any of the sex parties 
at the Carlton du Lille. It is not clear the extent to which this local investigation in the north of 
France of prostitution ring at the Carlton Du Lille hotel and the DCRI's targeting of DSK are 
connected. Whatever made DSK a target, the DCRI had capabilities for international remote 
surveillance that went far beyond those of the local investigation, capabilities indeed which could 
account for the French authorities obtaining a recording of DSK's intramural conversation at the 
W Hotel in Washington DC with Jean-Christophe Lagarde on May 12th, 2011. 
Surveillance, if it is to be to be comprehensive. is generally not limited to a solitary location. It 
follows the subject wherever he goes. So if DSK was a target of surveillance in Washington, 
there is a strong possibility it would be extended to his stop, assuming that the agency had the 
capabilities to continue its coverage in New York City. Such an extension might help explain 
why 90 seconds before his taxi pulled up to the Sofitel hotel at 7:08 PM on May 13th, its arrival 
was apparently anticipated. 
Chapter VII 
The Missing Blackberry 
DSK had used his IMF Blackberry several times between 10:07 AM and 10:30 AM on 
Mayl4th to call Paris, according to the records subpoenaed from Blackberry by the District 
Attorney. According to sources close to DSK, the purpose of these calls was to his arrange to 
have his Blackberry examined by a team of security experts as soon as he arrived in Paris. He was 
convinced that his messages were still being intercepted even after he had changed the SIM card 
in it. But those calls to Paris were made on the IMF BlackBerry, so if it had been bugged, those 
eavesdropping on the call would know his plan. 
The last call DSK made on that phone was at 12:13 PM when he called his daughter to say he 
was on his way to meet her at the restaurant. That call lasted less than one minute, according to 
phone records. He then, as he recalled, put the phone in his brief case, brushed his teeth, combed 
his hair, and finished getting dressed. He left the room about 12 minutes later. At 12:28: 54 PM, 
as recorded by a CCTV camera at the 4O street exit, he was in a taxi. His phone, as he only 
discovered later, was not in his brief case. Its location pinpointed by signals it continued to send 
out was in the Sofitel, at least up until 12:51 PM, when these signals abruptly stopped. So, 23 
minutes, after DSK departed the hotel, his phone was still there. But the police did not find it there 
when they searched the presidential suite. Nor was it found in the corridor, elevator, check-out 
desk, or lobby. The room was locked at 12:51 PM and not re-opened until the police arrived later 
that afternoon. It is reasonable to conclude that some unknown party had taken the phone between 
12:14 pm and 12:51 PM. 
Assuming the police search was thorough, and they were specifically looking for the phone, the 
vanishing of it presents a locked-room mystery. One possibility is that DSK himself left it behind 
in the rush to meet his daughter (and did not put it in his brief case.) That would account for the 
continued signals from the Sofitel, but, if that was the case, the phone would have been found in
