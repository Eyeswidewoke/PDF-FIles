Library. Since the cabi=ets have the same frame design, I was under impression, I will continue th=s design on the 
cabinet doors as well to tie everything together. 
He told me he does not want this; as he calls it "Color Noise"= The other thing was the molds on the 
baseboard. The molds changed the col=r of the wood and Bart and I, worked really hard ( mind you this is an old=oak, 
very hard wood ) to sand all the surfaces down until the beige color =as again visible. The color of the base was effected 
by molds so deeply, t=at I decide to go with it. I applied the whitish color to match the rest. =o make this practical, I 
tended to finish the top with some "better&q=ot; finish so the wood would be protected from easy damage. 
The=base color was so much better than the top, and I did not liked the color =f the top myself, but not 
having the air-brush, I could not finish t=is the way I wanted to. 
I can only tell you, we directed to= much energy the wrong way. We worked hard but by the end I had 
very=C2 little to show. We did a lot prep work, which is good, but I was not =repared well for presentation. In my own 
eyes, I did very poorly. I did ho=ever mock up presentation with tortoise shell on the doors, my 15 minutes =rush work
again, I would do a great job, have I had an air-brush with me=) on two doors. Mr. Epstein favorably commented the 
work but he said not t= continue it. Again, having no proper tools and materials made me co=plete handicap on this job. 
I also introduced some color on the=columns. Mr. Epstein looked at the colors and said absolutely no 
colors, b=t than looked at the parrot I slightly colored and he said two columns can=be colored at the window. 
Not knowing which way to go, I c=lored one column with some green. Well, if this would evoke Art 
Nouveau St=le. He definitely did not like it. 
I just tried many ways to fi=d out what he actually like, so right now, I have much better idea and I w=ll 
proceed with some confidence. 
Very important, the mold proble=. 
It will not go away. The duct supplying the cool air was blac=. It consisted of black powder, a mold 
growth, which was dispersed into th= air. This have to be eliminated. 
Mr. Epstein asked me whether =o Ozone it. In a way is a good idea to kill the mold when is fresh and a 
l=ttle. This time is old and there are layers over the layers and Ozone will=not penetrate and kill the mold. I would 
suggest to change the duct now. l=portant factor in this is thee Relative Humidity Control. 
Gentle=an came over one day before Mr. Epstein arrival to the Island, and he look=d closely into my 
eyes. I did not budge when he try to tell me the Relativ= Humidity is at 55 degrees. The paper we placed on the floor for 
protectio= wrinkled in two days. It must be more humid than he thinks. 
Ap=rt from regulating Relative Humidity issue, killing the mold, exchanging t=e ducts from the AC unit to 
the Library, I would strongly support placing =he Silica Gel under the cabinets. We tried to dry these areas by shooting 
=ry air from the hair-dryer, but I know this is temporary fix. If this woul= be up to me, I could purchase Relative Humidity 
Meter ( a good RH meter i= about $200.- )and check the RH every day. It will take couple minutes, ju=t to press the 
button and read the result. 
I would place the Si=ica Gel under the cabinets to keep these spaces dry. 
The Silica =el comes in a crystal clear form. When absorbs the moisture from environme=t, turns into a 
purple color. What is good about it, it will not extract t=e moisture back. You have to bake it for 30.45 minutes and re-
use it again=and again. There are couple guys there, that would be willing to learn and=operate these simple 
procedures. It will take couple minutes to read the R= Meter and write it down into the diary. Place the Silica Gel and 
check it=every weekend and if necessary bake it and replace it anew. I think there =s young man TJ ? that I think could 
do this work well. 
Apart fro= the stress I went through on the account that I did not know which way to=go with 
restoration, the trip was very pleasant. Peoples are very nice and=always ready to help. Ann is very good manager and 
has very good grip on t=e crew. Daphne is a very devoted to her work and always inquiring about th= needs of others. 
Jermaine, Carlos and Ramon strike me like they are alway= ready to help. Mr. Epstein assembled a very good and 
dedicated peoples to=work with. 
Please, let me know if you have any question.
