Evolution also creates entirely new curves (IQ =id not exist before organisms 
mutated some fat cells into a nervous =ystem). And individuals sometimes do matter (Genghis Khan is said to =ave 
fathered thousands of babies). 
shifting the points =ocations. 
the curve may chage over a time =eriod . 
averages height moves =p, average intellegvine moves up 
(Homo sapiens seems to have lost IQ several =imes during its evolution, perhaps 
because smarter individuals have =igher relative cost of rising children due to lost opportunity. And =onogamy means 
that almost everybody has a shot at reproduction, so =enetic drift should be huge.) 
The focus on the indivdual is the weak =ink 
how do I get happy, is asking =ow 
do i move up the curve , but just as statistical =echanics says little if nothing about a single particle = 
Exactly! I cannot move up the curve directly, =ecause the curve is a statistical 
model, not a causal mechanism. To get =ore happy, more wealthy or more tall, I need to identify a causal =echanism to 
do so. I cannot travel by looking at a map, I have to find = way to locomote. 
but we can say much about the group. biology may =resent a similar issue 
=ootnote , It is my view that gravity is only a result =f probabililty . it is not 
a force. but a =seudo =orce. 
Physics mostly sees it as spacetime curvature. In =y mind, space does not really 
exist, there is only an incredibly dense =etwork of paths in a graph. Around objects, the paths are much denser, =o 
superficially, if you move in a straight line near an object, the =robability to move toward the object is much higher than 
the =robability of moving away from it. However, there is more to it, =ecause the paths evolve (change) in 4D, and as a 
result, are not a =andom jumble, but probably relatively (but not perfectly) well =rdered. 
Seeing gravity as =urvature (i.e. a pseudo force) works well, but it works for the 
other =orces, too. All forces are essentially regular deviations for how =ertain types of information travel through the 
universe graph, and =articles are types of patterns of traveling deviations. So, in my =urrent view, all forces are pseudo 
forces, and all particles are pseudo =articles. 
In my mind, the =niverse looks like a data structure in a giant computer that is 
ticking =orward step by step, thereby creating all the dynamics that we observe, =ith the added complication that we 
can never access the absolute =alues, but only the relative differentials of things we are entangled =ith. Observers are 
causal systems that are complex enough do form and =anipulate memories (i.e. computers) that are parasitic on the 
=omputations of the universe computer in much the same way as water =ortices are parasitic on the fluid dynamics of a 
river. For an =bserver, nothing can be absolute. For instance, time is the difference =n the rate of change of an observing 
computer in relation to the rate =f change in its immediate environment, which happens to depend on the =peed with 
which the computer moves through that environment. Spin is =he difference in spin of a part of the computer to what it 
gets in =ouch with, etc.
