Leon, Congragulations on biting the bullet. =C2* at least 18 months late , but I m encouraged and g=ad for you. 
When you interviewed Brad two years ago you asked=that i not tell him what a disaster lay before him. what would 
you =ike me to tell Barry? 
There is a HUGE amount of work to b= done in the next 9 -12 months. mostly the exact same work tha= i outlined in 
my email of 2 years ago. now complicated by years of =ess on top. ( you can send it again if you like ) . Bra= <=pan 
id="m_1351435030875433780:2be.2">wechsler was n=ver up to the task . sorry, I realize I have been saying=the very 
same thing for a long time. he was a not a step up from Eil=en but a step sideways. in the beginning there was=Eileen 
and Tom and Ralph Lerner. all your hand picks. Q=A0 then brad. john, Joe. . joslin was chosen from a pool4k=A0 of 2 
people. each that would be limited by a salary of 250k. ( yes i pe=sonally augmented his comp in order to get him ) I did 
say hire bot= Lisa to do the bookkeeping and joslin tax, 
He complained for ov=r a year , re his direction by eile=n and 
ada , and then brad. His breakdown was not a surpr=se after months and moths of warnings. Though disabled, =he 
ran your office this year. with john and joe. He ran amok, and as i told youQ=A0 he rarely failed to remind me in our 
conversations that you=told him that he works for you and not for me and that brad needs to=C240 pays him . 
. Asking me who =o hire , estate attny</=pan> tax people etc. : 
I have taken heat for years=C2* over the fact that i gave you no more than carlyns name, . no fo=low up questions 
no interactions , not even one single questio= asked of me re her work. ( that was Eileen _) bur somehow carlyns 
fuck up was my doing. . 
when i tol= you that i thought Eileen wasn't up to the task, you bellowed t=at i was talking 
out of both sides of my mouth. . =C24, You told me this year , that by trying to protect you from crazy joslin, I =ad in 
essence fired him and it was my responsibility to do his work.=C24, it then turns out that he didn't consider himself 
fired at all4,=A0 he just received less money. 
and continued to =ake a really dangerous mess.. Joshn castrucci, in 
your eyes , was also my d=ing , though email after email said , I take no responsibility =/span> for him,and iYOU 
SHOULD NOT HIRE HIM .!!! „ your response was that=was my opinion was only because i didn't trust him. then t= add 
insult to injury last =an you told me he was gone. however=he too is still there, and a waste of money and space. 
=C240 
My time =s complicated by Donald's potentially eviscerating any reason fo= anyone to use the foreign 
funds repatriation plan that i had =ut together. . however as you are aware I have some deci=ions to make re my time 
allocation in the next year or two. so=at least for a few weeks I am unable to commit much time and make an= future 
plans to guide you in the redoing of your procra=tination produced mess. 
That being said ,4>=A0 
the tasks at hand are the following.
