3101 Music, Taste, &Values 
Faculty Raykoff. Ivan 
MW 10:00 AM- 11:40AM 
Credits: 4 
CRN 7392 Sec A 
This course explores the history of musical taste through a study of writings about music's uses 
and values, specifically considering how the discourse around any music reveals aesthetic 
judgments as well as social and personal investments. We will study seminal texts on musical 
meaning from Antiquity through the Enlightenment and Romanticism, finding parallels in those 
historical accounts to contemporary debates and concerns. Christopher Small's notion of 
-musickine provides one theoretical approach to the rituals of music performance in 
contemporary culture through a case study of the symphony orchestra concert. Students devise a 
final research or fieldwork project to explore how we construct and enact our musical values in 
daily life.

CRN 7806 Sec A 
In this seminar we will examine the city as a sonic environment. We will listen to the history of the 
sonic city by exploring the impact of early audio technologies and other sound-making devices on 
urban form and urban experience, and by imaginatively recreating the soundscapes of ancient and 
early modern cities around the globe. Then, turning an ear to the modern city, we will address such 
topics as urban music scenes and portable music devices: audio recorders, cell phones, and 
loudspeakers, and their impact on urban planning and experience: the politics of noise and 
silence: and sound art.
