effected by way of a notarial deed executed before a Dutch notary. This will cause transfers of record ownership 
of Shares to the Purchaser during such extensions of the Offer to be substantially more expensive. cumbersome 
and time-consuming than transfers of Shares to the Purchaser prior to the Expiration Date. Furthermore. you 
should be aware that after the second amendment of Mobileye's articles of association pursuant to the 
Conversion Resolutions following the Delisting ("Amendment No. 2'). any share acquired by a Mobileye 
shareholder after the date of Amendment No. 2 would not be transferable prior to March 1. 2019. unless the 
Mobileye Board has approved such transfer. 
If the Post-Offer Reorganization is consummated, it is anticipated that Mobileye shareholders who do not 
tender their Shares pursuant to the Offer (including during the Subsequent Offering Period, as it may be extended 
by the Minority Exit Offering Period) will be offered or will receive the same consideration for their Shares as 
those Mobileye shareholders who tendered their Shares pursuant to the Offer (including during the Subsequent 
Offering Period, as it may be extended by the Minority Exit Offering Period), without interest and less applicable 
withholding taxes. However, in the Compulsory Acquisition. the Dutch Court will determine the price to be paid 
for the non-tendered Shares. Although Intel and Purchaser will use their reasonable best efforts to cause the per 
Share price paid in the Compulsory Acquisition for the non-tendered Shares to be equal to the Offer 
Consideration. such price may be greater than, equal to, or less than the Offer Consideration. Such price may 
potentially be increased by the Dutch Statutory Interest. As a result of the Post-Offer Reorganization, Mobileye 
will either be liquidated or become wholly owned by us. 
The applicable withholding taxes (including Israeli dividend withholding taxes) or other taxes, if any, 
imposed on Mobileye shareholders who do not tender their Shares pursuant to the Offer (including during the 
Subsequent Offering Period, as it may be extended by the Minority Exit Offering Period) may be different from. 
and greater than. the taxes imposed upon such Mobileye shareholders had they tendered their Shares pursuant to 
the Offer (including during the Subsequent Offering Period, as it may be extended by the Minority Exit Offering 
Period). 
In addition, if the Offer and the Post-Offer Reorganization are completed. another difference between 
tendering your Shares and not tendering your Shares pursuant to the Offer is that you may be paid earlier if you 
tender your Shares pursuant to the Offer. 
See the "Introduction" to this Offer to Purchase. Section II —"The Purchase Agreement Other 
Agreements." Section 12 —"Purpose of the Offer Plans for Mobikye" and Section 13 —"Certain Effects of the 
Offer."

Will I have appraisal rights in connection with the Offer?

Offer. However, in the event that after the Subsequent Offering Period, Intel or its affiliates hold less than 100% 
but at least 95% of Mobileye's issued capital (geplawst kapitaal), we or Intel may elect to commence, or cause to 
be commenced, the Compulsory Acquisition proceeding pursuant to which we will acquire all Shares held by
