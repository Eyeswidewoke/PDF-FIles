So we have two choices we can continue to shake our heads and stay silent and do nothing about 
this injustice or we can make our voices heard. We can make believe this is not Anti-Semitism or 
we can call a spade a spade. We must voice our opinions and to exercise our right to freedom of 
speech and demand that the Attorney General of the United States of America stop this insanity 
now. Where are all the fighters for freedom and Democracy and equal treatment for all. Where are 
all the politicians that scream about racism, and bigotry ?

The following are some of the details of how it came to be that the Unites States 
Government of America is seeking a life sentence from a nonviolent first time offender in a 
32 million dollar fraud case. 
MEMORANDUM REGARDING GROSS DISPARITY IN PROSECUTORIAL TREATMENT OF 
SHOLOM RUBASHKIN (prepared by a lawyer familiar with the facts of the case) 
This Memorandum describes the gross disparity between usual procedures in federal 
criminal prosecutions under the immigration and bank-fraud laws and how Iowa federal prosecutors 
treated the case of Sholom Rubashkin, the Orthodox Jewish Hasidic businessman who was arrested 
on immigration-law violations relating to the Agriprocessors plant in Iowa and was found guilty after 
a jury trial of bank fraud and failure to pay cattle owners promptly. 
The enormous disparity between the treatment of Mr. Rubashkin and others who committed 
similar offenses began with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement ("ICE") raid on 
Agriprocessors ("Agri") on May 12, 2008, and has continued to this day. 
1. Should ICE Have Conducted the Massive May 2008 Raid? 
Because it was apparent from government activity in the neighborhood of Agriprocessors' 
Postville plant that ICE might be planning a raid, Agri took the advice of the American Meat Institute 
and retained the services of Robert W. Kent, Esq., an attorney with the international law firm of 
Baker & McKenzie. Mr. Kent had represented Swift & Co. - a meat-packer that had been raided by 
ICE in six states in December 2006, when approximately 1,297 illegal employees were found. When 
ICE sought to raid Swift again in Texas, Kent persuaded them to proceed without a raid and instead 
to examine Swift's employment records and weed out the illegal immigrants. Kent called the Iowa 
prosecutors on May 9, 2008, and followed up with a faxed letter the same day requesting a meeting
