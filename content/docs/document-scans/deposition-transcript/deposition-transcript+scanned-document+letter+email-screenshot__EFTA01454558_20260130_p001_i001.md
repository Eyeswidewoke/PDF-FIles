(+140%). One reason for the surge in M&A has been the accommodative capital 
markets. we saw an example of that yesterday with a jumbo bond deal from 
Oracle who priced 510bn in bonds (the second largest USD offering in the 
year-to-date according to Bloomberg) to fund the purchase of Micros Systems. 
The deal was sufficiently large to drag other TNT bonds several basis points 
wider on the day. 
Looking at some of the geopolitical headlines, Ukrainian President Poroshenko 
said late on Tuesday that we would end the cease-fire with pro-Russian rebels 
and vowed to intensify military operations in the country's east. However the 
president also made some concessions including guaranteeing Russian-language 
rights and more regional autonomy. Russia also offered some concessions 
yesterday including allowing Ukrainian and international observers in its own 
border posts along the border with Ukraine. In Iraq, semi-autonomous Kurds 
plan a referendum for independence according to a regional government 
spokeperson (Reuters). The Kurds plan to keep control of the Kirkuk oil 
fields. 
There are some mixed headlines elsewhere in china. Firstly china's banking 
regulator announced a small change in the way that Loan-to-deposit ratios are 
calculated which our banking analysts think will reduce the system regulatory 
LDR ratio by 410bp based on end 2013 data. Our analysts think that this will 
pave the way for more relaxation of Chinese bank liquidity requirements. 
Secondly, the latest Macau gaming numbers were reported which showed June 
casino revenues fell 3.7% vov in June. This is the first drop since 2009, but 
some are attributing this to the effects of the world Cup. 
Turning to the day ahead, the rest of the global manufacturing PMIs/ISMs will 
be released starting with the final Pills for Europe. The uS manufacturing ISM 
is expected to show a small bump up to 55.9 (vs 55.4 in May) which would mark 
a six month high. DB is expecting a print of 55.0. Other highlights on the US 
data docket are may construction spending and the IBD/TIPP economic optimism 
index. 
VTD performance review 
In YID terms, of the main indices we track the FTSE-MIB (+14.5%) and the IBEX 
(+12.8%) have been the star performers. Spanish, Portuguese and Italian bonds 
have not been far behind. Interestingly commodities make up quite a few of 
the other top ten places (with the CRB index, Gold, Silver and Oil returning 
between 7-11%), but also 2 of the worst 3 with wheat and Copper both down 
more than 6%. Also negative was Chinese equities (-1.5%) after disappointing 
growth in H1 which may explain some part of the weakness for certain 
commodities. The Nikkei (-6.1%) was the only other asset lower YID in our 
sample. Apart from these four all the other assets saw a positive 2014 total 
return. credit has put in a good performance in 2014 so far with most major 
indices returning between 4-7% which is impressive in the low yield, low 
spread environment. 
For the full numbers for the year, Q2 and June see the charts and tables in 
today's pdf. we also show the YTD numbers all converted to dollars. 
Happy H2!
