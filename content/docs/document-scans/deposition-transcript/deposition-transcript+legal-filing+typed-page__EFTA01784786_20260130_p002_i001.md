80 friends that we later moved to Tramp. Or the many times that I took him to Elaine's or Utzi's in NYC. But one of my 
most favorite =oments was when as a group we went to see Joe Frazier sing at Jimmy's in midtown Ma=hattan and he 
brought Ali on the stage and sang "'We did it OUR way' =90. 
Since his death a number of friend have sent me emails and texts recalling how I had introduced them to Muhammad Ali 
and what that meant in their lives. Unlike today's fighters, Muhammad Ali ducked nobody. He foug=t everyone. Yet, his 
most brave moment was when three years after winning the Heavyweight Championship he refused induction into the 
armed services based on religious and humanitarian grounds — knowing that he would=be stripped of his title, lose 
millions of dollars in income and potentially face years in prison. 
Muhammad Ali defeated every top heavyweight in his era, which has been called the golden age of heavyweight boxing. 
Ali was named "'Fighter of the Year" by Ring Magazine more times than any other fighter, and was involved in more 
Ring Magazine "'Fight of the Year" bouts than any other fighter. He was an inductee into the International Boxing Hall 
of Fame and held wins over seven other Hall of Fame inductees. He was one of only three boxers to be named 
"'Sportsman of the Year" by Sports Illustrated. 
And if there is Athlete of the Century, it should be Muhammad Ali. 
Ali's example inspired countless black Americans and others. The New York Times columnist William Rhoden wrote, 
"Ali's actions changed my standard of what constituted an athlete's greatness. Possessing a killer jump shot or the ability 
to stop on a dime was no longer enough. What were you doing for the liberation of your people? What were you doing 
to help your country live up to the covenant of its founding principles?" Recalling Ali's anti-war position, Kareem Abdul-
Jabbar said: "I remember the teachers at my high school didn't like Ali because he was so anti-establishment and he kind 
of thumbed his nose at authority and got away with it. The fact that he was proud to be a Black man and that he had so 
much talent ... made some people think that he was dangerous. But for those very reasons I enjoyed him." 
Ali even inspired D. Martin Luther King, Jr., who had been reluctant to address the Vietnam War for fear of alienating the 
Johnson Administration and its support of the civil rights agenda. Now, King began to voice his own opposition to the 
war for the first time. In speaking of the cost on Ali's career of his refusal to be drafted, his trainer Angelo Dundee said, 
"One thing must be taken into account when talking about Ali: He was robbed of his best years, his prime years." I 
remember 1980 in Las Vegas, taking Ali from his hotel to the venue for the Larry Holmes fight in my dear friend Nabila's 
limo, as Don King had forgotten to supply him transportation. By then it was evident from his sluggish performance that 
something had happened to him physically. 
In 1984, at age 42, Ali was diagnosed with Parkinson's syndrome, wh=ch shares symptoms with the degenerative 
neurological condition of the same name. Some believe Ali's condition was brought on in part by the ma=y blows his 
body had absorbed over the years. "Maybe my Parkinson'= is God's way of reminding me what is important. It slowed 
me down and caused me to listen rather than talk," he said, according to the BBC. "A=tually, people pay more attention 
to me now because I don't talk as much."= Despite his health concerns, Ali remained an active philanthropist through his 
post-boxing days, supporting the Special Olympics, Make-A-Wish Foundation, the Muhammad Ali Parkinson Center in 
Arizona and a museum bearing his name in Louisville. 
Political activism has never been widespread among athletes. Since the 1950s, only a handful of athletes have 
challenged the political status quo. Perhaps not surprisingly, most dissident athletes have been African Americans. 
Jackie Robinson used his celebrity as first black in modern major league baseball as a platform to speak out for civil 
rights. Bill Russell led his teammates on boycotts of segregated facilities while starring for the Boston Celtics. Olympic 
track medalists John Carlos and Tommie Smith created an international furor with their black power salute at the 1968
