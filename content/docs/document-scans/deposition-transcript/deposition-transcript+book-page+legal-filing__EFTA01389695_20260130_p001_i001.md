GLDUS132 EverWatch Financial 
warranties in its Subscription Agreement and (ii) any failure by a 
Limited Partner to provide information as requested by the General 
Partner or Investment Manager in connection with anti-money 
laundering or similar programs, sill be considered a default under the 
Partnership Agreement. 
In the event that the Access Fund fails to make a capital contribution to 
the Underlying Fund as a result of the failure of a Limited Partner to 
make a capital contribution to the Access Fund, the Underlying Fund 
may impose certain remedies against the Access Fund, including, 
potentially causing the Access Fund to forfeit all or a portion of its 
interest in the Underlying Fund. 
Bifurcated Default 
With respect to any capital contribution (or portion thereof) that is 
subject to a default (the "Defaulted Amount"), the General Partner may 
call additional capital from the Limited Partners that have already made 
the applicable capital contribution (not in excess of their unfunded 
Subscriptions) to the extent necessary to fund the Defaulted Amount. 
If the Access Fund fails to contribute all or any portion of any call 
amount set forth in a funding notice received from the Underlying Fund 
(an "Access Fund Default"), and such failure results from the failure of 
one or more Limited Partners (each such Limited Partner, a "Defaulting 
Access Fund Investor") to make full payment in respect of any capital 
call issued by the Access Fund, then Glendower has agreed to only treat 
the Access Fund as a "Defaulting Partner" (as defined in the limited 
partnership agreement of the Underlying Fund, (as may be amended or 
otherwise supplemented from time to time, the "Underlying Fund LPA')) 
with respect to the portion of the Access Fund's interest in the 
Underlying Fund that has defaulted. In addition, the General Partner has 
agreed that, if the Glendower GP so requests upon any Access Fund 
Default, the General Partner, or the Investment Manager on its behalf, 
shall cause the Access Fund to assign to the Underlying Fund, and the 
General Partner will delegate to the Underlying Fund, the authority to 
exercise directly for the direct benefit of the Underlying Fund, all of the 
rights and remedies provided in the Partnership Agreement against a 
Defaulting Access Fund Investor as if they were a Defaulting Partner, 
and the General Partner will provide such assistance as is reasonably 
requested by the Glendower GP in connection with the exercise of any 
remedies against the Defaulting Access Fund Investor. 
In addition, in applying and interpreting the provisions of the Partnership 
Agrccmcnt, in order to equitably determine the rights and obligations of 
any Limited Partner with respect to the Underlying Fund, the General 
Partner may treat any Limited Partner as if it was a separate limited 
partner of the Underlying Fund, any default penalties imposed by the 
Glendower GP may be allocated solely by the General Partner to the 
applicable Defaulting Access Fund Investor to the maximum extent 
possible.
