Prince Al Waleed bin Talal has long been seen as an important link between Arabs and the rest 
of the world, acting successfully like a bridge between the business worlds of the Middle East 
and the West. But are the financial foundations of this bridge starting to whither? Furthermore, 
are there other bridges that Al Waleed can cross? 
In March 2008, Forbes Magazinepublished its eagerly awaited list of the world's richest 
billionaires. Standing firm at number 19 was the world's richest Arab, Al Waleed with an 
estimated fortune then of $21.0 billion. One year later, it couldn't be more different. For it was 
in March 2009 that Citigroup's stocks fell from a high of $57 recorded on December 18, 2006 
to just 97 cents. Citigroup's shares had recorded a 52 week high of $27.35 on April 28, 2008, 
figures we are unlikely to see in the next few years. Citigroup is important because ever since 
Al Waleed invested $590 million in 1991 in the bank as it struggled with Latin American loan 
losses it has constituted his largest shareholding. Based on simple calculations, his 250 million 
shares were one day worth up to $14 billion and are now worth $250 million. 
At the same time, Al Waleed's Kingdom Holdings stock price plummeted from 14 Saudi Riyals 
to SAR3.9 and his Nasdaq Dubai Kingdom Hotels firm now trades (for lack of a better word) 
at one dollar from it's $9.25 listing price. Incidentally, Kingdom Hotels, one of the Prince's 
most asset rich and attractive companies can now be bought in it's entirety for $170 million, 
about half as much as he paid for his "flying palace" Airbus A380 that qualified for the 
CNN/Fortune 101 Dumbest Moments in Business rankings in 2007. 
At a $10 Billion market cap, the National Bank of Kuwait, although losing 50 percent of its 
value in the past year is today worth twice as much as Citigroup, the latter reaching a market 
cap of $270 billion in early 2007. 
In fact, Al Waleed's shareholdings read as a list of some of the most troubled investments in the 
past few years: Motorola, News Corp, Apple, EuroDisney, Eastman Kodak and Ford have lost 
between 50 and 80 percent of their value in the past few months. 
The Prince might not be bankrupt but he's never been closer to being so. This will be a tragedy 
not just for Al Waleed but for the many charity causes be champions. In 2005 he donated $40 
million each to Harvard and Georgetown Universities to set up Islamic studies centres. He also 
endowed Cambridge and Edinburgh universities in Britain with $31 million to set up similar 
departments. In his home country Al Waleed is known to have built thousands of houses for the 
poor as part of his generous housing program in rural areas of the desert kingdom. Al Waleed 
is also known for spending every Wednesday evening, if he is in Saudi Arabia, receiving 
hundreds of visitors from lower income households with requests for financial assistance, this 
generosity can cost him up to $1.5 million on any night. 
But what can savvy investors learn from the financial turbulence that plagued so called Arabian 
Warren Buffet. Although it is by now an overused cliché but more than anything don't throw 
good money after bad money and when you find yourself in a hole, stop digging. Sadly this is a 
lesson that Al Waleed did not learn early enough. Encouraged by ADIA's costly and 
miscalculated gamble of effectively burning $7.5 Billion by investing in Citigroup in the autumn 
of 2007, Al Waleed followed suit and ploughed hundreds of millions of dollars to raise his steak 
to five percent to match ADIA's equity. He even called Citi's $six billion write down the 
previous summer a "hiccup.". 
Despite the horrific decline in the value of Citigroup, the one dollar threshold represents a new
