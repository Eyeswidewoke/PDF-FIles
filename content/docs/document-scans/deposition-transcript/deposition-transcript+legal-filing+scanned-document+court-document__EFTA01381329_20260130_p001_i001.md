Price Stabilization and Short Positions 
In connection with this offering. the underwriters may engage in stabilizing transactions, which involves making bids for, purchasing and 
selling shares of common stock in the open market for the purpose of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the common stock 
while this offering is in progress. These stabilizing transactions may include making short sales of the common stock, which involves the sale by 
the underwriters of a greater number of shares of common stock than they are required to purchase in this offering, and purchasing shares of 
common stock on the open market to cover positions created by tort sales. Short sales may be "covered" shorts, which are tort positions in an 
amount not greater than the underwriters' over-allotment option referral to above, or may be "naked" shorts, which arc short positions in excess of 
that amount. The underwriters may close out any covered short position either by exercising their over-allotment option. in whole or in part, or by 
purchasing shams in the open market. in making this determination, the underwriters will consider. among other things. the price of shares 
available for purchase in the open market compared to the price at which the underwriters may purchase shares through the over-allotment option. 
A naked short position is more likely to be created if the underwriters are concerned that there may be downward pressure on the price of the 
common stock in the open market that may adversely affect investors who purchase in this offering. To the extent that the underwriters create a 
naked short position. they will purchase shares in the open market to cover• the position. 
The underwriters have advised us that, pursuant to Regulation M of the Securities Act, they may also engage in other activities that 
stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the common stock, including the imposition of penalty bids. This means that if the 
representatives of the underwriters purchase common stock in the opal market in stabilizing transactions or to cover short sales, the representatives 
can require the underwriters that sold those shares as part of this offering to repay the underwriting discount received by them. 
These activities may have the effect of raising or maintaining the market price of the common stock or preventing or retarding a decline 
in the market price of the common stock, and, as a asult, the price of the common stock may be higher than the price that otherwise might exist in 
the open market. If the underwriters commence these activities, they may discontinue them at any time. The underwriters may cant' out these 
transactions on NASDAQ, in the over-the-counter market or otherwise.
