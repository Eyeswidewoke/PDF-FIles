challenge, if the stock value drops below one dollar for 30 consecutive days, effectively 
becoming a penny stock, it may be delisted and become an over-the-counter company. What 
should Al Waleed and by extension ADIA do about their high-flying employees who got them 
into deep trouble? To borrow from the New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd, writing 
about incompetent American jet-setting executives last autumn, "off with their headsets." 
Also, now that there is much less wealth to throw around flying palaces, it is time to go back to 
the basics of sound investments, steady growing firms are in the long term a much better bet 
than sexy stocks and trophy assets. If not, Al Waleed's magical story will be of a young prince 
and his Kingdom who had it all before he lost it all. 
An alternative option available to Al Waleed is to enter into the political world. On the one 
hand he could try his chances with the Saudi Royal court, after all King Abdullah bin Abdul 
Aziz is his paternal uncle. Though Talal Bin Abdul Aziz, Al Waleed's father may have made it 
slightly tricky for his astute son to tread down that path. Talal was know as the Red Prince for 
harbouring socialist tendencies back in the 1950's that caused him to be exiled to Egypt. Al 
Waleed's free thinking father may have also indirectly influenced his son's liberal investment 
attitude. As Talal continued to call for educational reforms, empowering women and 
championing various humanitarian causes such as the Arab Open University which today that 
has over 22,000 students enrolled at moderate fees, 50 percent of whom arc women. Prince Al 
Waleed for example does not shy from investing in alcohol serving establishments from 
Monaco's Monte Carlo Grand Hotel and London's Savoy Hotel to the luxurious Canadian 
chains of Four Seasons and Fairmount. 
Prince Al Waleed has meticulously positioned himself for a political role using his investments 
as a conduit. Commanding such vast amounts of wealth has allowed him to seek private 
audiences, not just with the likes of business luminaries such as Bill Gates and Warren Buffet 
but also with world leaders whose time is usually spared for other world leaders or their 
ambassadors. Only in the past twelve months has he met with Pope Benedict XVI, Middle East 
Peace Envoy Tony Blair, Bashar Al Assad of Syria, President Tabu& Vazquez of Uruguay, 
President Gloria Arroyo of the Philippines, President Hamid Karazai of Afghanistan, Yemeni 
President Ali Abdullah Saleh, French President Nicolas Sarkozy, the Emir of Kuwait Sheikh 
Sabah Al Ahmed, Kazakh President, Nursultan Nazarbayev as well as the Presidents of 
Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Azerbaijan, Mongolia and Kyrgyzstan. The list of ambassadors he 
met in the same period possibly rivals that of Saudi Arabia's own Foreign Minister Prince Saud 
Al-Faisal and included emissaries from the Senegal, Uzbekistan, the US, Uganda, France, 
Mexico, Myanmar, Djibouti, Bosnia Herzegovina, Eritrea, Malaysia, the Comoros Islands, 
Poland, Australia, Korea, Georgia, Albania, Egypt, Afghanistan, Great Britain, India, Nepal, 
Jordan, Thailand, Azerbaijan, Palestine, Vietnam, Ethiopia, Macedonia, Japan, Sudan, 
Portugal, Qatar, Niger and American Congressmen; an impressive list by any standard. 
Al Waleed employs a brilliant Public Relations engine to issue press releases with photos of him 
and his elegant unveiled wife Princess Ameera meeting with many of these dignitaries, a 
process that has positioned him as a public figure as per his own accord exposing himself to 
both public scrutiny and praise. He has taken the unusual step in the region of publishing a 
candid account of his personal as well as professional life that included family photographs of 
his parents and children further highlighting his modern lifestyle. However, the Prince's widely 
known liberal leanings may not be as accepted in his home country of Saudi Arabia where he 
faced stiff opposition and religious edicts to list his Kingdom Hotels firm which ended up in the 
Nasdaq Dubai stock market. However, one place where his views have been accepted and 
would sit comfortably is the Mediterranean country of Lebanon.
