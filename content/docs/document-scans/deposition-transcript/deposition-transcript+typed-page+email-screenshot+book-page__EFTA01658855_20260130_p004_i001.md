said, 'Georgia has machines that tabulate the vote. ... They then held a hand recount, and the 
outcome was consistent with the machine vote." 
Newsweek (11/30, Roche, 1.53M) reports, "International observers have also frequently 
rated American election security highly." For instance, "Freedom House's most recent report, 
published before the November election, gave the U.S. 10 out of a possible 12 points under the 
heading `Political Rights: Electoral Process:" Additionally, the Economist Intelligence Unit's 2019 
report "concluded that the world in general had become less democratic but the U.S. remained 
in the green zone, coming in 25th place." 
The Washington Post (11/30, 14.2M) separately reports that on "Wednesday, Dec. 2 at 
11:00 a.m. ET, Krebs will join Washington Post columnist David Ignatius to discuss his role in 
the 2020 election and the cyber threats facing the country." A link to the stream is provided. 
Trump, Campaign Vow To Continue Legal Fight As Arizona And Wisconsin Certify 
Results. President Trump and his campaign team vowed on Monday to continue their legal 
fight as more states certified the results of the presidential election. The AP (11/30, Bauer) 
reports Arizona and Wisconsin "certified their presidential election results Monday in favor of 
Joe Biden, even as [Trump's] legal team continued to dispute the results." The New York Times 
(11/30, Epstein, Thrush, 18.61M) reports the certification of Biden's 21,000-vote win in 
Wisconsin "came a few hours after Arizona officials formalized Mr. Biden's even narrower victory 
there." Biden carried Arizona "by over 10,000 votes." 
The Washington Post (11/30, Gardner, Brown, Helderman, 14.2M) reports the 
certifications "brought Biden one step closer to an official victory on Dec. 14, when the electoral 
college meets." On Monday, Trump addressed Arizona Republican lawmakers "via cellphone, 
calling the 2020 election the `greatest scam ever perpetrated against our country.' The 
president ripped into" Gov. Doug Ducey (R), "criticizing him for `rushing to sign' papers 
certifying Democratic victories." The Wall Street Journal (11/30, Paul, Kesling, Subscription 
Publication, 7.57M) reports Trump tweeted over the weekend that more challenges would be 
coming; both states allow legal challenges following certification. 
The AP (11/30) reports Ducey and Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs (D) "both 
vouched for the integrity of the election before signing off on the results." Ducey said, "We do 
elections well here in Arizona. The system is strong." The Arizona Republic (11/30, 869K) 
reports that Hobbs "touted high turnout despite the election unfolding in the midst of a 
pandemic and attributed much of that to the long-running popularity of voting by mail in 
Arizona and broader awareness of early in-person voting." 
In Wisconsin, the AP (11/30, Bauer) reports, "confirmation of the results by the 
Democratic chairwoman of the Wisconsin Elections Commission started a five-day window for 
Trump to file a lawsuit. ... Trump's attorneys have alleged without evidence that there was 
widespread fraud and illegal activity." The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel (11/30, 632K) reports, 
"Trump has said he will bring a lawsuit in Wisconsin by Tuesday." The Wisconsin State Journal 
(11/30, Vetterkind, 372K) similarly writes that for Trump's campaign, "which has so far come 
up short in multiple efforts to overturn the election results in several states, its last resort in 
Wisconsin is to appeal to the courts, which Trump has said he will do." 
Director of Trade and Manufacturing Policy Navarro said on Fox Business' Evening Edit, 
"Having looked at hundreds and hundreds of affidavits, the election outcome is still very much 
in doubt. We owe it to the American people to let the process go forward." Trump campaign 
senior adviser Lara Trump said on Fox News' The Story (11/30), "I still think that the President 
will get four more years in office. ... We believe that Donald Trump legitimately won this 
election. He got 11 million more votes...in this election than he did in 2016." 
Trump's Charges Against Georgia GOP Officials Could Impact Senate Runoffs. 
Mary Bruce said on ABC World News TonigISVI (11/30, 6:40 p.m. ET, story 3, Muir, 7.69M), "In 
Georgia, the President is still railing against the Republican governor and Secretary of State, 
who certified Biden's win there." Trump: "The Governor's done nothing. He's done absolutely
