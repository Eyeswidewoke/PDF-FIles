it would go something like this.  
= 1 Donald doesn't really own very much, he ren=s out his name. he puts it 
on buildings projects etc. =AO for a royalty or piece of the upside. he then claims the asset i= " his " . its very much 
like hyatt hotels. =t says Hyatt hotel on the front but it is owned by someone els=. ( sometimes by Hyatt but not 
often). Hyatt=receives 3 percent per year of revenue and a piece of the prof=ts sometimes if the hotel is sold at a 
profit. . =C2 
money launderers. need a name to p=rchase trophy properties. 
why? there i= little suspicion if a famous wealthy 
person buys a property that is likely t= show in the press. , it cant be jojo my driver. up front=C2 , so they approach 
wealthy people and tell them for 2 -5 milli=n dollars for doing nothing at all. - just lend us your name . - =AO and the 
person get the positive press. 
so and s= bought the most expensive painting. sold the most expensive p=inting, 
house., diamond. etc. -ex the =span class="" style="" id=":2ew.14" tabindex="-1">GANZ art =ollection was bought 
and sold by Joe Lewis.. =AO all the publicity was the ganz family estate. selling etc. 
=br> 
hypothetically, .=C2 someone approached trump and said can you bu= the palm beach house. in your name.
it was trum= properties Ilcrispan> ) , not sure who actually owns the Ilc. ? =AO Donald can get a loan from a bank , 
but it is guarant=ed by , an entity controlled by R R has a bvi co. xitrans. that =s owned by a family trust. ( cyprus ). 
R wife settles in o=t after trump anounces candidacy . 
the Ilc agreement or th= loan agreement allows Donald to get 
a few million for his name. .=C2 R in essence is the " owner. ". =AO he was part of the panama papers release. he also 
sold the =span class="" style="" id=":2ew.27" tabindex="-1">da vinci tombs.. ? =C2 if you are a gangster , where and 
how can you inve=t money. answer not through the front door. = 
Donald's financial disclosures =AO are the same , he represents his " income =quot; as the GROSS receipts of his 
clubs. " ,=C2 means nothing at all ZERO. no income as we no it. =br> 
he lists his " assets" =and their VALUE - but not the corresponding loans. agai=st it. so no net number , hence 
meanin=less.
