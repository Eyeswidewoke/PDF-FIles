SOF III - 1081 Southern Financial LLC 
be relevant when considering an investment in a Feeder Fund. Therefore, prospective 
Investors must carefully review the Master Fund Offering Memorandum, including 
the more detailed and comprehensive summary of the conflicts of interest related to 
an investment in the Master Fund in Section 9: "Conflicts of Interest" before making 
a commitment to a Feeder Fund. 
The services of the Investment Manager are not exclusive to the Onshore Feeder Fund, and 
the Investment Manager and its affiliates also serve as managers to other funds. As an 
affiliate of the Investment Manager will serve as the investment manager to the Master 
Fund, potential conflicts of interest may arise between the limited partners of the Master 
Fund and the Limited Partners of the Feeder Funds. The Investment Manager will be under 
no obligation other than those imposed by law to act in the best interest of the Limited 
Partners. The Investment Manager is responsible (as a delegate of the General Partner) for 
exercising the Onshore Feeder Fund's rights with respect to its interests in the Master 
Fund. There is an inherent conflict in connection with the activities of the Investment 
Manager on behalf of the Onshore Feeder Fund that are adverse to the Master Fund. For 
example, the Investment Manager may not bring an action on behalf of the Onshore Feeder 
Fund against the Master Fund (or the Master Fund Manager, the Master Fund General 
Partner or the Second Master Fund General Partner) that an unrelated investment manager 
might otherwise initiate. The Limited Partners cannot bring an action against the Master 
Fund Manager; however, the Limited Partners may bring an action against the Investment 
Manager and Limited Partners of the Onshore Feeder Fund representing 66% of the 
aggregate Capital Commitments to the Onshore Feeder Fund may direct the General 
Partner to remove the Investment Manager as the investment manager of the Onshore 
Feeder Fund in accordance with the provisions of the Onshore Feeder LP Agreement. In 
addition, the General Partner is not affiliated with the Master Fund Manager or Deutsche 
Bank, and the General Partner may bring an action against the Master Fund and the Master 
Fund Manager. 
Placement Agents. The Feeder Funds will utilize divisions and affiliates of Deutsche 
Bank to serve as placement agents, and may also utilize third-party placement agents (the 
"Placement Agents"). Placement Agents will receive, in respect of Investors introduced 
to the Feeder Funds, a placement fee from the Investment Manager (the "Placement Fee"). 
Any such Placement Fee may be waived or reduced in respect of any particular Investor 
without thereby entitling any other Investor to a similar waiver or reduction. Placement 
Agents may also receive from the Investment Manager and the Master Fund Manager a 
portion of their respective fees on an ongoing basis. As Placement Agents may receive 
ongoing compensation in respect of selling Interests, they will have a conflict of interest in 
consulting with Investors as to the purchase of Interests. Further, Placement Agents may 
receive different amounts of compensation with respect to subscriptions to the Feeder 
Funds relative to other products advised by the Investment Manager and/or its affiliates, 
and therefore may have incentives to favor one or more products over others. See 
"Summary of Terms."
