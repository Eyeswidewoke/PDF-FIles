Schmidt about neighboring Egypt's fear "t=at Israel might use nuclear weapons." Dayan said that he understood t=e 
Egyptians' worries, and pointed out that in his opinion the use of the b=mb against the Aswan dam would have 
"devastating consequences." He didn't even deny the existence of a nuclear weapon.=/span> 
First Submarines Ar= Secretly Assembled in England 
A country that has =he bomb is also likely to search for a safe place to store it and a safe l=unching platform -- a 
submarine, for example. 
In the 1970s, Brand= and Schmidt were the first German chancellors to be confronted with the l=raelis' determination to 
obtain submarines. Three vessels were to be built=in Great Britain, using plans drawn up by the German company 
Industriekontor Lubeck (I KL). 
But an export permi= was needed to send the documents out of the country. To get around this, =KL agreed with the 
German Defense Ministry that the drawings would be comp=eted on the letterhead of a British shipyard and flown on a 
British plane to the British town of Barrow-in-Fur=ess, where the submarines were assembled. 
Assuring Israel's s=curity was no longer the only objective of the German-Israeli arms coopera=ion, which had since 
become a lucrative business for West German industry.=ln 1977, the last of the first three submarines arrived in Haifa. 
At the time, nobody was thinking about nuclear second-strike capability. It was not until the early 1980s, when more 
and=more Israeli officers were returning from US military academies and raving=about American submarines, that a 
discussion began about modernizing the Israeli navy -- and about the nuc=ear option. 
A power struggle wa= raging in the Israeli military at the time. Two planning teams were devel=ping different strategies 
for the country's navy. One group advocated new,=larger Sa'ar 4 missile boats, while the other group wanted Israel to 
buy submarines instead. Israel was "= small island, where 97 percent of all goods arrive via water," said =mi Ayalon, the 
deputy commander of the navy at the time, who would later b=come head of the Israeli domestic intelligence agency, 
Shin Bet. 
Strategic Depth 
Even then it was be=oming apparent, according to Ayalon, "that in the Middle East things =ere heading toward nuclear 
weapons," especially in Iraq. The fact tha= the Arab states were seriously interested in building the bomb changed 
Israel's defense doctrine, he says. "A subm=rine can be used as a tactical weapon for various missions, but at the cen=er 
of our discussions in the 1980s was the question of whether the navy war to receive an additional task known as 
strategic depth," says Ayalon. "Purchasing the submarines was=the country's most important strategic decision." 
Strategic depth. Inrother words, nuclear second-strike capability. 
At the end of the d=bate, the navy specified as its requirement nine corvettes and three subma=ines. It was "a 
megalomaniacal demand," as Ayalon, who would lat=r rise to become commander-in-chief of the navy, admits today. 
But the navy's strategists had hopes of a budgetary miracle.=/span> 
Alternatively, they=were hoping for a rich beneficiary who would be willing to give Israel a f=w submarines. 
KOHL AND RABIN TURN=ISRAEL INTO A MODERN SUBMARINE POWER 
The two men who fin=lly catapulted Israel into the circle of modern submarine powers were Helm=t Kohl and Yitzhak 
Rabin. Rabin's father had fought in World War II as a v=lunteer in the Jewish Legion of the British army, and Rabin 
himself led the Israeli army to victory, as its ch=ef of staff, in the 1967 Six-Day War. In 1984, having served one term as 
p=ime minister in the mid-1960s, he moved to the cabinet, becoming the defen=e minister.
