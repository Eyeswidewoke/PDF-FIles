for different life-stages, breed sizes, special needs and diet types has 
fueled premiumization in the industry, leading to the faster growth of 
products 
with higher revenue per pound. This premiumization trend has impacted all 
market segments and product types in the pet food industry. 
The pet food industry has high penetration in the United States with 63% of 
households purchasing pet food in 2014. Virtually all pets in 
the United States are fed packaged pet foods. The continued growth of the 
industry through the worst economic recession in recent history is a 
testament to the underlying consumer demand and the strength of the consumer 
trends driving it. Pet food is also a highly branded industry with 
low rates of switching due, in part, to potential digestive issues that may 
occur when switching between different pet food brands. As a result, 
brands that build a strong relationship with a pet and its pet parents 
realize significant value over the lifetime of the pet, especially if the 
pet starts 
on the brand as a puppy or kitten. 
The pet food market consists of dog food sales, which make up approximately 
70% of the market, and cat food sales, which make up the 
rest. Food sales are further categorized as dry food, wet food and treats: 
• 
Dry food is the primary food form for both dogs and cats, with the same 
formula typically purchased regularly. Approximately 20 
years ago most pet parents fed their dogs and cats more wet foods than dry 
foods. Veterinarians now recommend dry food for 
healthy pets as the main meal, which is better for pets' teeth, has better 
economic value and is more convenient to handle and store. 
• 
Wet food has higher penetration among cats as compared to dogs, as it helps 
to ensure that cats meet their required water intake. 
Most cat parents feed their cats a combination of dry and wet foods as main 
meals, while most dog parents feed their dogs wet 
foods as a treat or topper to provide variety. After a long period of 
decline in the volumes of wet dog foods and slower growth in 
volumes of wet cat foods as pet parents continued to switch from wet foods 
to dry foods, wet food volumes stabilized and in the 
last two years have started growing. We believe that the recent increase in 
the popularity of wet foods is tied to product innovation 
in the overall industry and increased focus from Wholesome Natural brands. 
• 
Treats are typically impulse purchases by pet parents made alongside staple, 
main meal dry and wet food purchases. Many treats 
have dental and training benefits and also serve as nutritional supplements. 
Dog and cat treats have been growing rapidly over the 
last decade driven by the humanization trend with pet parents indulging 
their pets more, including by purchasing treats as gifts.
