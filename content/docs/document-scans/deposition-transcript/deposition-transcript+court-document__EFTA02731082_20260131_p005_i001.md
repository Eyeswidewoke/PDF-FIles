Epstein asked 
to bring other girls for massages, which she did. Initially, Epstein 
simply asked her to "bring a friend" and told her he would pay her to bring other girls. Later, 
after a few experiences of
 bringing victims who balked at the sexual nature of the 
massages, Epstein told her not to bring girls unless they knew what to expect. 
understood 
this to mean she should warn girls to expect they would need to take off their clothes, and that 
Epstein would touch them and masturbate. She then conveyed as much in recruiting new 
victims. 
estimates that over the course of several years, she recruited approximately 20 to 30 
girls for Epstein, all of whom were approximately 15 to 20 years old.4

of the girls she recruited were minors. Epstein would occasionally indicate to

When'. first met Epstein, she told him she was 18 because her friend had told her to 
lie about her age. In truth, she was approximately 14 or 15 at the time, and was wearing braces, 
and recalls that it would have been obvious that she was very young. Initially, 
similarly 
told other girls she brought to Epstein to say they were older because her friend had given her 
that instruction. Over time, however, based on her observations of the girls that Epstein seemed 
to prefer—and the sheer number of minors she brought to the house without issue—M came 
to believe that Epstein wanted younger girls and did not care if the girls told him their true ages. 
For this reason, 
stopped telling the girls she recruited to lie about their ages. She stated that 
the girls she recruited looked very young, and she believes it would have been obvious to anyone 
that they were underage.
