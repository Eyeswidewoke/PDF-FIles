Regarding the alleged =ncident on the 2011 cruise, the first I became aware of it 
was when Pat =eauchamp, CFI's business manager and the employee responsible =or cruise logistics, wrote to me in 
2013 indicating she objected to =nviting Lawrence Krauss on our upcoming Galapagos cruise. I found this =trange, and I 
responded to her almost immediately asking the reasons =or her objection. She gave two reasons. The first was that 
Krauss did =ot pay sufficient attention to the guests on the 2011 cruise. I had =eard this concern from one guest myself; 
on the other hand, I also =eard from several guests that they thought Krauss's =resentations were excellent and a 
highlight of the cruise. Accordingly, = did not give this concern much weight. 
The second reason was that Krauss had allegedly asked a =emale guest on the 
cruise to join him and his partner, apparently for =ome sort of sexual activity (I cannot recall whether Krauss was 
engaged =r married or just seriously involved with his female companion at the =ime, although they were clearly 
romantically involved and seemed very =uch in love). This is the first I had heard of this proposition. No =omplaint by the 
guest or anyone else had been made to me at the time of =he cruise, although I was on the cruise and clearly visible 
throughout =he cruise. 
I asked Ms. Beauchamp for =ontact information for this guest. I did call the 
guest and she =ubstantially confirmed what Ms. Beauchamp had said. I apologized on =ehalf of the organization. The 
guest indicated although she was taken =back by Krauss's proposition at the time, she did not want to =ursue the matter 
further. I then got in contact with Krauss. Krauss =enied the allegation. In light of the guest's reluctance to =ursue the 
matter and Krauss's own denial and, importantly, =ecause between the time of the 2011 cruise and the Galapagos cruise 
we =ad instituted a policy regarding harassment at any CFI event, which covers not just =mployees, but speakers and 
attendees, I decided to go ahead with my =Ian and have Krauss as a speaker on the Galapagos cruise. Krauss was =ully 
aware of our harassment policy regarding CFI events because we had =ad a discussion about it. Therefore, I expected 
him to comply with that =olicy on the Galapagos cruise. As far as I know he did, because we =eceived no complaints 
about his conduct. Nor have we received any =omplaints about his conduct at other events. 
Let me just take a moment to highlight the 2012 policy, which =ou can find in 
full here, 
http://www.centerforinquiry.net/blogs/entry/cfis_new_policy_on_hostile_conduct_harassment_at_conferences/ 
along with the announcement I made =xplaining the rationale for the policy. This policy was, certainly at =ts time, 
arguably the strongest any nonprofit organization had =egarding conduct at its events. Again, this policy shows that any 
=uggestion that CFI, as an organization, or that I personally took a lax =ttitude regarding harassment is completely 
without factual =oundation. 
In your email you mentioned =hat one staffer resigned after I invited Krauss on 
the Galapagos =ruise. I'm not aware of any staffer resigning because of that. =f you give me a name I could comment on 
the reasons for the staffer =eaving. Ms. Beauchamp remained an employee of CFI (and went on the =alapagos cruise 
with Krauss). 
You mentioned =lso the comments that were made to me in March 2012 by 
Melody Hensley. =et me give you the background for that. CFI was holding an event prior =o the 2012 Reason Rally in 
DC. Richard Dawkins, Jessica Alquist, Jamie =askin, and Lawrence Krauss were scheduled to speak at the event. Melody 
=ensley was heavily involved in the planning for the event and in fact =as tapped to make introductions for the speakers, 
including Krauss. (At =he time she was in charge of the DC local branch.) During the planning =or the event she gave no 
indication whatsoever that she had any =esitation about introducing or dealing with Krauss. (I will forward you =ome 
email correspondence confirming this.) 
As I recall, Krauss's schedule resulted in his =fanned arrival being a little later 
than the others. As it turned out, =e was even further delayed. At some point when it became clear that =rauss was 
going to be late, Hensley turned to me and said, "I =now why Krauss isn't coming; he's embarrassed to see =e." I asked 
Hensley what she meant by this. She said Krauss had =ade a pass at her several years earlier and she had rebuffed him. I 
=sked for some details. She said she was in a hotel room with him (I =an't recall whether she said it was Krauss's hotel
