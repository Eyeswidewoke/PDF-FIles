Steve Kroft: What's the nature of these voices and what do they say? 
Dr. Lieberman: Usually it's multiple voices, talking about them in the third person, as if they're not 
there. They may be saying, "You're a horrible person. Everybody hates you. The only way that you can 
justify yourself is to lash out at them." 
Steve Kroft: How strong are the voices? 
Dr. Lieberman: When they're at their worst the person can't distinguish the voices from their illness and 
they think the voices are part of them, and if they tell them what to do, they'll follow it. 
Jacob Bowman: I hear a voice. It's a man's voice and it's really, really deep. It's a really deep and scary 
man's voice... 
Schizophrenia is more common than you might think. Several million Americans have it. 17-year-old 
Jacob Bowman has been struggling with it for a couple of years. 
Jacob Bowman: This is basically me on a bad day, I guess. Because I can't think straight. My thoughts are 
racing really, really fast. 
He's dropped out of high school, lives at home under the watchful eyes of his parents, and rarely goes 
out because he thinks people are trying to kill him. He spends much of his time on social media -- we 
found him on YouTube -- where he shares his world with other young people who have the same 
symptoms. He wants them to know that they're not alone, and that the voices and hallucinations are not 
real. 
Jacob Bowman: Basically all my voices I have are just thought-- just voices telling me to harm myself or 
harm other people or kill people. And, that's why I think I need to get on medication because I don't 
want to hurt anyone. And because I know schizophrenics aren't violent. 
And he's mostly right. The vast majority of people with schizophrenia never show any signs of violence. 
Mike Robertson was 19 years old and away at college when he was diagnosed three years ago. 
Mike Robertson: I felt like there was people around me, like, bad people or nice people. 
Steve Kroft: Even when there was nobody there. 
Mike Robertson: Yeah. And that's what really, that's what really got to me. 
Linda Doran: He told me over the phone, "I feel like I'm going insane. I swear there is a bug in my head 
and I just want to tear at my eyes and my skin and my scalp to get to it and get it out of there so I don't 
have to hear it anymore." Very scary. 
Michael's mother, Linda Doran, brought him back to California and got him into treatment, which 
consists of regular therapy sessions and daily doses of heavy duty anti-psychotic drugs that stabilize him 
and help control the symptoms. 
Mike Robertson: Clozapine. It's an anti-psychotic. Haloperidol. Cogentin or Benztropine. Fluvoxatine or 
Prozac, Lorazepam for anxiety. 
They often leave him listless or groggy, which is one of the reasons people with severe mental illness 
often stop taking them.
