among Features and Charges on your Account in any order and manner determined by us in our sok discretion. Finance 
Charges: Average Daily Balance (ADB) Method for Calculation of Finance Charges (FC): We use the ADB 
Method to calculate FC cn your Account Under this method, we figure the FC on your Account by applying the Daily 
Periodic Rate (DPR) to the FOB (as described below) for each Feature (inducfing current transactions). Different daily 
periodic rates may be applied to separate Feature balances. To get the ADB for each feature, we (1) take the beginning 
balance for each day (mduding unpaid FC from previous biting periods) (2) add any new transactions, debits, or fees, (3) 
subtract any payments a credits , and (4) make any appropriate adjustments. For each day after the first day of the biting 
period, we also add an amount of interest equal to the previous days daily balance multiplied by the DPR for the 
Feature. This gives us the daily balance for the Feature for that day and the beginning balance for that Feature for the next 
day. If this balance is negative, it is considered to be zero. Then, we add up all the daily balances for the Feature for the 
billing period ard d:vide the total by the number of days in the billing period. This gives us the ADB for tho Feature. If you pay 
the NOW Balance cn this statement by the next Closing Date, then you will avoid additional FC on features included in this 
New Balance. If you multiply the ADB for each Feature by the number of days in the billing period and the DPR for that 
Feature, the result will ba the FC ea-erased on that Feature, except for variations caused by rounding. The total FC for the 
billing period is calculated by adding the FC assessed on al Feattres of the Account. This method of calculating the ADB 
and FC resulb in daily compounding of FC. Transactions Made In Foreign Currencies: If you incur a Charge in a 
foreign currency, it will be converted into US dollars on the dated is processed by us or our agents. Unless a particular rate is 
required by applicable law, we wit choose a conversion rate that is acceptable to us for that date. Currently, the conversion 
rate we use for a Charge in a foreign currency is no greater than (a) the highest official conversion rate published by a 
government agency, or (b) the highest interbank conversion rate identified by is from customary banking sources, on the 
conversion date or the prior business day, in each instance increased by 2%. This conversion rate may differ from rates 
in effect on the date of your charge. Charges converted by establishments (such as airlines) will be baled at the rates such 
establishments use. Billing Rights Summary: In Case of Errors or Questions About Your Bill: If you think your bit is 
incorrect, or if you need more information about atransaction on your bill, write us on a separate sheet of paper at the
