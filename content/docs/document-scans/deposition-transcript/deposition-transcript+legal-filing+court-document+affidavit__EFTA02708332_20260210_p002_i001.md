extension or line-up new tenants to minimise the time during which the property will be 
vacant. Section 8, US social housing, accounts for approximately 60% of our property rentals. 
This provides an added regularity of payment and also means that rental rates for these 
properties are predictable. 
(4) Sales & Client Relations: apart from our office in Southfield (Metro Detroit) - the operational 
headquarters for the company- we have a sales and administration base in London. 
Currently we have affiliated agents (working on commission) in the UK, Spain, Dubai 
Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Singapore and Hong Kong. We look to expand sales operations in line 
with future stock increases. 
Suburbs outside of Detroit (Metro Detroit): 
Metro Detroit covers an area of 3,888 square miles, the majority of which lies outside the borders of 
Detroit City. While Detroit City has suffered from declining employment and population loss over the 
last decade the wider Metro area contains satellite municipalities with healthy socio-economic 
profiles. For example, Southfield is home to the offices of more than 100 Fortune 500 companies, 
and Troy was ranked the 22nd Best Place to Live in the USA by CNN Money. We buy in areas that 
have viable local economies, providing jobs, infrastructure and leisure activities for their inhabitants: 
Redford, Bagley, Eastpointe, Rosedale Park, Warren, Southfield, Sherwood and University City. 
However, Detroit city should not be written off. We are bullish on Detroit City's long-term 
emergence from decline, something which we believe has already started. The change in fortunes 
for the Big Three carmakers (GM, Ford and Chrysler increased combined market share in the first 
quarter for the first time in 20 years) has led to the creation of new jobs in information and 
technology roles. Cars are now released with a sophisticated array of software applications, the 
development of which requires a skilled IT labour force. GM is in the process of quadrupling its IT 
department, while Ford and Chrysler are also taking on a significant number of new hires. This has 
transferable benefits to technology start-ups in the city, providing demand for their products and 
local expertise in product design. We believe Detroit will cease to be a one-trick pony, relying solely 
on Auto, and will develop a more diversified, high-tech economy. 
That's not to say that manufacturing is dead. The US added 500,000 jobs in the manufacturing sector 
from 2010-2012, putting an end to the period of decline between 2000-2010. Michigan is the centre 
for US manufacturing, adding more jobs than any other state during the period (88,000). There is 
one key driver for a sustained growth in manufacturing- the cheap energy revolution. No other 
country in the world can compete with the shale resources and resource infrastructure which the US 
is currently exploiting. Manufacturers are beginning to repatriate their operations to the US, finding 
it cheaper despite the higher labour costs. Chrysler, GE and Caterpillar are three notable companies 
that have recently repatriated manufacturing operations. 
With added investment and new jobs comes more demand for housing. Properties in strategic 
commuter locations offer bright prospects for long term capital growth on the back of a resurgence 
in Detroit commerce.
