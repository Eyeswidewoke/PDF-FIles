• In the Right of First Refusal, can we establish a defined timeline (e.g. 2 weeks) to 
make a go/no-go decision? Following that the CG management should commit to a 
business plan to actualize the opportunity. If on the other hand CG is not committing 
to the plan , I should be given the option to pursue it directly. 
• I feel strongly that we should invite an independent board of director to the 
board who has expertise wellbeing industry and also has expertise an entrepreneur in 
our domain. Tony Tijan (http://www.cueball.com/) who I know very well and respected 
in the industry with a proven track record is one potential candidate who comes to 
mind. Another person could be Steve Nelson, who is very well connected in the 
industry and also industry leaders such as Marc Benioff

happy to ask the people I had suggested to meet with all of you. But I would also 
welcome any person suggested by Ray, Matt or Alice.

Enterprises be defined? 
• Would this be considered as a derivative work of existing IP and how would this 
be handled going forwarded. 
• In the Excluded Activities can we ensure that my consulting services for external 
organizations are covered? 
• Currently to Chopra Center is between 70-80 days annually, this covers every 
course and service that CC offers. The valuation of Chopra Enterprises was based on 
revenue derived from these services. My compensation has been $120K/month, I 
would like that to be restored and guaranteed as a minimum. The 3% royalty becomes 
effective only after exceeds my compensation.

• Since I am being asked to assign all my IP to Chopra Global, even though the 
valuation was based on some of my specific IP utilized by the Chopra center currently I 
feel that this should be also tied to a performance clause to execution/milestones by
