Jeffrey.. Thanks very much for your advice.. We are not yet =n the labor law 
phase.... nowhere near that yet.. We are in =he OEI investigation phase, and I repeat they are tasked merely with 
=eciding what, if any violations of university policy they view as =robably having occurred. Moreover, all she was doing 
was =overing her bases.. She didn't indicate whether the allegations =hat were reported to the University were based on 
the University =eaching out to individuals after the Buzzfeed story who then wrote to =he University. There are a host 
of questions that need to be =nswered. and wiggle room with questions at or after meeting... =oreover, just because 
someone from Mongolia complains about me does not =ean the University is empowered to investigate that.. In any 
=ase, just FYI.. I am sending you the section of the ABOR regulations on =ismissal or Suspension of Tenured faculty, so 
you will see it is a long =rocess that extends way beyond what I am embarking on next week. =nbsp; 
In any case, as a =esult, I am taking the following action today. I want to 
continue =isten carefully to your advice, believe it or not, but I need to feel I =ave a legal expert familiar with Title IX to 
talk with as well, and =here is no perfect person.. but Nancy and I have decided to =etain Justin, who, while perhaps too 
eager to be combative at this =tage, will work for me, and not vice versa, and has extensive =xperience with university 
processes, including at ASU. His main =nterest is making the process fair, and if it is not, holding the =niversity 
accountable after the fact. I think that meshes with my =oal as well. I do feel much better about him than I did about 
having =ohnny's lawyer, which was delusional on my part. Plus I will be =uch more critical of advice, as I will be bouncing 
it off you as well.. =nbsp; I hate spending the money, but Nancy reminds me that in the old =ays this is less than I would 
have received for a single lecture. =nbsp; 
So, =nce again, I understand your concerns.frustrations, knowledge, 
=ecriminations, etc, but this is what I am going to do. So, I am =ither going to waste SISK or get some useful payback for 
it, and I will =ither kindly accept your offer to let me waste your $25K, or my =25K. If you feel sufficiently strongly that 
you don't =ant to follow through on what you so generously offered before, which =as to provide $25K for me to work 
with however I felt I wanted to do, =nd perhaps largely for our mental health if necessary, I will not =nbsp;of course hold 
it against you in any way. You have been so =enerous with your time and friendship, which in the end is so much more 
=mportant.
