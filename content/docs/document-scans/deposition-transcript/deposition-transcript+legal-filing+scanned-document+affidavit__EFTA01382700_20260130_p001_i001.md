We entered the region in 1992 when Fuss Data began providing issuer processing services in Australia, which is our largest market in 
the region. We expanded our footprint by licensing our VisionPLUS solution and providing managed services to support bank clients. We also have 
a growing merchant acquiring business. 
We entered China in 1995, becoming one of the first non-Chinese companies with permission to build a data center in mainland China. 
We have maintained our operations in China, expanded into Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Macau, and currently provide a range of commerce-enabling 
solutions to businesses and financial institution clients in all three markets. In 2001. we established operations in South Korea and in 2005 acquired 
Korea Mobile Payment Services, a leading provider of value-added network services, which manage POS terminals and route transactions to 
Korean banks.

solutions directly to businesses across the region through First Data Merchant Solutions. To address the diverse nests of issuers in the APAC 
region, we operate a VisionPLUS center of excellence in Singapore and India that provides custom development and other professional services to 
our financial institution clients. 
We believe our business in the APAC region will benefit from several industry trends, including the shift to electronic payments driven 
in part by government incentives, the penetration of new industry verticals and customer segments, and the adoption of new payment types and 
channels such as prepaid. eCommerce. and mobile commerce. In addition, we believe the fast economic growth. maturation of the financial 
services industry in many countries, favorable consumer demographics. and the emergence of a consumer middle class with greater spending 
power in the region will continue to drive strong transaction growth trends and investment in commerce-enabling solutions by businesses and 
financial institutions.

combination of channels that provide us with a large, global distribution platform. Uniquely, we have a wide network of bank relationships that
