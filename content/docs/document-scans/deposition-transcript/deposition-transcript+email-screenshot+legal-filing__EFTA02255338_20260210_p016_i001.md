incentives for reaching sales targets or other goals, and from time to time may also provide 
incentives to our travel counselors. Certain suppliers may also provide compensation to us for 
various marketing and administrative services that we perform for them, such as granting them

initiatives. In addition, we receive compensation from suppliers when customers use the American 
Express Card or other American Express products to pay for supplier products and services. From 
time to time we may enter into other business relationships with suppliers and these arrangements, 
including levels and types of compensation and incentives we receive, are subject to change. In 
identifying suppliers and recommending itineraries, we may consider a number of factors, including 
supplier availability and your preferences. The relationships we have with suppliers may also 
influence the suppliers we identify and the itineraries we recommend.
