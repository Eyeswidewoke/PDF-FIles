• Bob Diamond's 
resignation as Chief Executive of Barclays bank clearly marks a turning point in the p=litics of banking in the UK. 
 
• The most significant 
political and regulatory outcome from these events will be to renew the debate about=universal banking. Whereas to 
date this debate has focused on scale, impli=it subsidy and systemic risk, it will now focus on culture, personal chara=ter 
and contamination from the values of the trading floor to the rest of a banking institution.=nbsp;Because these things 
cannot be regulated, the probability is t=at politicians will focus on their proxies, especially pay. 
 
 • • * ***** *• • • The gap between the 
inherent values and perceived risks of retail and investment banking has been furth=r widened by the events of the last 
two months. For leaders of universal b=nks, especially those who have risen through investment banking, closing t=is 
gap in the mind of political stakeholders poses a particular challenge. Mr Diamond's belated 'citiz=nship agenda' at 
Barclays was well-conceived, but fatally hobbled by thi= tension.

 ••• •••••••• • By falling on his 
sword, Mr Diamond has created the possibility of a rapprochement betwe=n his former bank and British political opinion 
formers. The bigger issue =or the bank he leaves behind and others like it is how — or if — it is=possible after the crisis to 
rebuild political and regulatory confidence in the kind of financial markets busin=sses he dedicated his career to building 
and the people who run and profit=from them. 
Bob Diamond's resignation as Chief Executive of Barclays bank clearly=marks a turning point in the 
politics of banking in the UK. The announceme=t that Barclay's was to be fined E290mn as part of a settlement with the 
F5A financial regulator over its part in =he fixing of the London interbank lending rate between 2005 and 2008 prove= 
the tipping point for Mr Diamond. The Barclay's CEO has long been the m=st controversial of Britain's bank leaders and 
had few political friends. Yet in the end, the trigger for his=resignation was not direct political pressure, but the FSA's 
intimation =o the Barclay's board that unattributed threats from the top of Barclays=to the Bank of England had made 
Barclays' relationship with its regulator potentially toxic. 
Mr Diamond's departure and the LIBOR-fixing scandal will mark the start=of a new phase in the politics 
of the banking crisis in Britain. The sugge=tion that traders at Barclays and other banks were manipulating what is 
ultimately a key public benchmark fo= pricing financial products compounds a run of mis-selling and tax plannin= 
controversies. With a Parliamentary enquiry now to take place on the LIBO= issue in the UK, and the issue likely to ripple 
across other jurisdictions and produce both litigation an= possible prosecutions, banks in the UK are confronted with 
new levels of =olitical and public disdain. The fact that the Bank of England's own con=uct remains subject to question in 
some aspects of the LIBOR scandal will not deflect from this. 
It is safe to assume that the setting of LIBOR will now be moved into t=e remit of the UK financial 
regulator. Brussels will tighten market abuse =ules to apply criminal sanctions to tampering with indices like LIBOR. But
