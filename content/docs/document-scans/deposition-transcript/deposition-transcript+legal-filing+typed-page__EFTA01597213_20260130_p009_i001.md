Program will be withdrawn from Bank USA and transferred into your Secondary Sweep 
Option and available cash balances will sweep to your Secondary Sweep Option for the 
remainder of the month. These funds, up to the Bank USA Sweep Cap, will be transferred 
back to Bank USA on the first business day of the following month. 
FDIC Insurance Coverage and Limitations: If you have more than one Account that 
sweeps to Bank USA, the amount deposited at Bank USA may exceed the amount covered 
by FDIC insurance (currently $250,000 per insurable capacity). You are responsible for 
monitoring the total amount of deposits that you have with Bank USA to 
determine the extent of FDIC deposit insurance coverage available to you. Please 
refer to the UBS Bank Sweep Programs Disclosure Statement for more detailed information 
regarding the UBS Bank Sweep Programs and FDIC insurance. 
Alternatives to the UBS Bank Sweep Programs 
With the exception of tax-advantaged Accounts and Basic Investment Accounts, if you are 
eligible to participate in one of the UBS Bank Sweep Programs, but do not wish to have 
your available cash balances deposited with Bank USA, you may elect at any time to have 
your available cash balances swept without limit to a tax-advantaged Sweep Fund or, for 
Puerto Rico residents only, the Puerto Rico Short Term Investment Fund, Inc. 
The following tax-advantaged Sweep Funds currently are available: 
• 
UBS RMA Tax-Free Fund Inc. 
• 
UBS RMA California Municipal Money Fund 
• 
UBS RMA New York Municipal Money Fund 
• 
The Puerto Rico Short Term Investment Fund, Inc. 
• 
UBS Select Tax-Free Capital Fund (subject to minimum asset requirements) 
State-specific municipal funds are intended for residents of those states only. The Puerto 
Rico Short Term Investment Fund, Inc. is offered exclusively to Puerto Rico residents as 
defined in the fund's prospectus. The Puerto Rico Short Term Investment Fund is not a 
money market fund registered under the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940, does not 
comply with rules applicable to U.S. registered funds, presents a higher degree of risk than 
those funds, and is for Puerto Rico residents holding accounts with UBS Financial Services 
Incorporated of Puerto Rico only. The Puerto Rico Short Term Investment Fund and the 
Sweep Funds are sold by prospectus only, and are not FDIC-insured, not guaranteed by 
a bank, and may lose value. 
If your Account is tax-advantaged, or is a Basic Investment Account, whether 
tax-advantaged or not, you are not eligible to select a tax-advantaged Sweep Fund as a 
Sweep Option. Tax-advantaged Accounts include, but are not limited to, Accounts of 
Plans, Plan Participants and IRAs. If your tax-advantaged Account or Basic Investment 
Account is not an Investment Advisory Account, and you choose not to participate in a 
Bank Sweep Program, available cash balances not be invested and we are not required to 
pay you interest on cash balances in your Account. If your tax-advantaged Account or Basic 
Investment Account is an Investment Advisory Account, available cash balances must be 
swept through a Bank Sweep Program. 
Changing Your Sweep Option 
You may change your sweep election to an available alternative Sweep Option at any time. 
By instructing us to change your sweep election, you are authorizing and directing us to 
redeem your Sweep Fund shares, or withdraw funds from one of the UBS Bank Sweep 
Programs, and transfer the funds to your new Sweep Option. You may change your sweep 
election by contacting your Financial Advisor. 
For additional information regarding program availability and Account eligibility, please 
refer to the UBS Bank Sweep Programs Disclosure Statement and the UBS International 
Deposit Account Sweep Program Disclosure in the Agreements and Disclosures booklet, 
and to the prospectuses for the Sweep Funds and the Puerto Rico Short Tenn Investment 
Fund.
