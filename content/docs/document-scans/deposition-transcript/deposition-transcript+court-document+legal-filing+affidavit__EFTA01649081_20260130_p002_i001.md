and prosecuted and would have pursued any leads they generated. We did not, however, locate any 
such videos. Below please find more details about the video evidence gathered during this investigation. 
• During the searches of Epstein's New York residence and USVI residence in 2019, the FBI 
searched for videos and surveillance cameras. My understanding from the case agent is that there 
were no cameras found inside any bedrooms or living areas of either residence. I understand that 
surveillance cameras were located near the entrances of the residences. I also understand that the 
surveillance systems only retained video for a limited period of days, and that the only recordings 
available were very recent surveillance from 2019 and would thus not have depicted anything 
relevant to our investigation, which focused on the 1990s and early 2000s. Accordingly, those 
surveillance videos were not seized because they were not responsive to the warrants allowing the 
FBI to seize only certain evidence from those premises. The FBI had no legal authority to seize 
recent surveillance videos from 2019 under the warrants issued by SDNY and USVI courts. 
• During the searches of Epstein's residences in 2019, the FBI seized a large number of CDs, some 
hard copy photographs, and at least one videotape containing nude images of females, some of 
whom appeared to possibly be minors in their late teens. The case agents reviewed all of those 
images, and they were all made available to Maxwell's counsel for review in discovery. None of the 
images depicted sexual abuse, and none depicted any males with any of the nude females. 
• Some of these images included nude photographs of victims who were the focus of 
Maxwell's trial, and we marked some of those photographs as sealed exhibits for trial. The 
victims are alone in these photos. Because those images contained sensitive photos of 
victims of sexual abuse, they have never been released publicly. 
• As I referenced in my email to you this morning, the FBI and SDNY undertook a full review of all 
electronic devices seized from Epstein's residences and incident to his arrest in 2019. As part of 
that review, a team of FBI agents, FBI analysts, SDNY AUSAs, and SDNY paralegals divided up 
the review of over one million images and videos that FBI CART extracted from Epstein's devices. 
The reviewers all followed the same protocol for the review, which involved at least one member of 
the review team personally reviewing each image and video extracted from each device and 
determining whether the image or video was responsive to the search warrants in the case. In an 
effort to be as broad as possible, the protocol directed reviewers to identify as responsive, among 
other things, any image or video depicting any female who appeared to be under the age of 30. 
• As result of that review, any image or video on any of Epstein's devices depicting any 
potential victim was identified as responsive and saved. 
• The case agent collected and maintained a copy of all images and videos identified 
responsive through this search. Attached please find the index detailing how many images 
and videos were identified responsive to the warrants and what designation they received 
under the Protective Order in the Maxwell case. Note that materials designated Highly 
Confidential contained nudity. Please also not 
dex does not include Epstein's 
iPhone and six iPads, which were reviewed or 
' • sing the same protocol for 
videos and images described above. 
• Although that review identified many images and videos that were responsive to the 
warrants in our criminal investigation, none depicted the sexual abuse of any victim, and 
none revealed any perpetrator(s) of sexual abuse other than Epstein and Maxwell. 
• If you need additional documentation for this review, please let me know. 
• The Palm Beach Police Department video recorded interviews of victims at their police station, 
video recorded parts of their search of Epstein's Palm Beach residence, and also seized a small 
number of videos from Epstein's Palm Beach residence. 
• All of those videos were transferred to the FBI's custody, are part of the case file, and were 
reviewed by the AUSAs and case agents during our investigation. None of these videos 
depict the abuse of any victims or provide evidence suggesting anyone other than Epstein 
and Maxwell participated in the abuse of victims. 
• SDNY introduced the video recording of the search of Epstein's Palm Beach residence as 
an exhibit at trial. 
3. None of the videos identified in point 2 above contained potential CSAM. As noted above, there were no 
videos of any sexual abuse identified at any point in the investigation. There were, however, 
approximately a dozen photographs containing CSAM found on one of Epstein's devices. Those images 
were identified by the case agent as CSAM that Epstein obtained over the Internet not CSAM depicting 
any of Epstein's victims or produced by Epstein. A copy of those images was maintained by the case
