A few additions..what do you think? xo 
> 
I feel after 11 years of being a traveling assistant, it's time to redefine my role. =t's good for you if I continue to travel 
since I'm really good at it from =oing it so long, but for me, that aspect of things is no longer a challenge and =s not 
allowing me to grow in other areas. 
I believe the past 6 months have been a good introduction/test period for how things =an be structured going forward. I 
would like to step out of the traveling =ssistant role and be more of a managing figure for the future traveling =ssistants 
and In 
for NY and PB staff, and to handle any household/personal =rojects for you from which I can take care of 
from NY or from afar. I can help =rain, manage, oversee the other girls who will travel with you. I feel this =as worked 
out relatively well in the past 6 months, except for your last =alifornia trip in August. I believe all of your travels to your 
own homes in the past 6 =onths have gone smoothly as far as I have heard. I understand you weren't =appy with the last 
San Fran trip with Mn, 
Karyna and M. I wasn't there, =o don't understand what exactly happened, but the only 
way for these trips to go smoothly in the future with someone other than me is for them to keep =oing these trips on a 
consistent basis. I believe 
has a great handle on =hat needs to be done on these trips and we can start training. 
to have more responsibility if you want her to take on this type of roll. I can put =ogether a manual for travel for 
different circumstances; your homes, domestic destinations, foreign countries, etc. Everything they need to think =bout, 
be aware of, be prepared for, and of course I am always available to help =uide them anytime. 
Considering the timing of the upcoming Paris/Africa trip, since I already won't be =oing on this trip, I propose to continue 
on as we have the past few months and =egin right away with 
and 
as the main traveling assistants. =o:p> 
I very much want to grow as a =erson, to challenge myself and accomslish somet in: on m own This will allow me to 
devote some time to focusing on some personal endeavors such as a 
etc. while still being an asset to you. I would like =o be able to dictate, for the most part, 
my own schedule in regards to =ersonal travel as well, as long as it doesn't interfere with my =esponsibilities. I want this 
to be a solution that will work for both of us. It will =equire some evolution and I believe we should reevaluate how 
things are going in 6 =onths and make adjustments accordingly, i.e. if we need to hire someone else to =ravel, etc..
