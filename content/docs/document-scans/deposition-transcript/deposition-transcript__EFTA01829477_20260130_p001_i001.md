Subject Re: Ok 
you still avoid the quesiton „ what do you do. i don't hold the fact that i support you over you 
head, i ask over and over, what his that you actually do.. 
with regard the mattress, its was just find out which matress was where. and the details, A simple 
and clear question.. all else is silly.. you say its silly after stopping you, that was last week, and i 
refieterate , i just want you to do as i asl to oprahize the fact that i ask you to do something is now 
controlling. is another example of b00000shit, WHAT do you actuality do.. in return for that 
lifestyle, which i do believe is not that important to you. do you spend time trying to be helpful or 
most of your time on treatments lessons, shopping ball-e. if your answer is that you provide 
loyalty , i have never questioned that. your loyalty however has absolutely nothing to do with the 
fact that you have not done as i asked, its not dis loyal , its just not what i ask. IF you don't 
make any food, its not disloyal, if you dont' buy anything for me but tons for you, its not disloayl„ 
its just not what i want or need. YOU have to wake up„ you are turning into a spoiled brat, that 
thinks the world owes you something. , your expectations, are way out of wack.. and if your 
thank you, at the end of your letter, is supposed to be funny , it is. otherwise. you say you find y 
postiotion inconsitant. let me be clear . TO be helpful is to do what i ask. if with re sex, it mean s 
keeping in shape, thats easy . if its to get shapoos that s easy. if its to meddle in things, so you can 
feel important. Its unhelpful. you say when i tried to do more, it was no more of what i asked , it 
was more of what you thought you should do... its not helpful..

The example has little to do with our situation but I am flattered you are comparing me to an 18 
year old. 
The mattress was a perfect example. It seems you are confusing my honesty and having your 
best interests in mind with an inability to make decisions and do certain things. 
MIDoug, Sarah and whoever else was involved just decided not to tell you, use your money 
and order a different mattress without you knowing the difference ( similar to Lance serving 
you store-bought eggs ) Apparently this was already done once in the PB house and they were 
going to do it again on LSJ now. 
I was the only one to confirm with you and make sure you get what you like - and instead of a 
thank youilgcs yelled at because I didn't give you the ID number before asking a question. 
You said 
would never do that, she is experienced, understands how to get these things 
done and I know nothing about mattresses so no need for me to be involved... 
So without me being involved when would you find out you arc sleeping on 
cheap 
mattress9
At least I do my best to make sure you get what you like for your house, not my best to do 
things quickly behind your back and get away with 'serving you Marina market eggs' with a 
pat on the back.
