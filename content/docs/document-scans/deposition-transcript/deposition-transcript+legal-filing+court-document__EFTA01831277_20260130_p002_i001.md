o you: 
• we include a biography of you - a short one. 
• we write about your philosophy for investment and lines of inquiry - e.g., 
you are not interested in saving the world but this does not mean you do not 
outright reject altruism; you gravitate to open-ended problems, not the ones 
that are focused on solving a very particular problem. 
0 the proof: i feel it should be obvious which of these things/people you actually DO 
financially support. this gives credibility. and it also allows for space for you to do 
some of the other stuff which would exponentially increase your SEO power by 
having links to universities, funding etc. that could reciprocate. 
If you like these ideas we need to discuss the logistics of this endeavor in terms of : 
• time-line: a realistic one that won't defeat any one's expectations. (i am needing to take 
some other jobs lately so it would be helpful to me to have a schedule that we both 
understand - i am willing to forego things for you but i also need to make some money in a 
way that allows me to forecast ). 
• goal: is this SEO? is this to really give you a cool on-line presence that can help you make 
money and can be used by us in other ways to deliver information to different audiences 
• the audience: important to agree on this? i dunno 
• budget: do you want to spend your money on this and do you understand what it will involve? 
I would foresee my role as being one of translater and integrator: making the interviews 
interesting and accessible as well as the other parts that need content. i would be liaison with 
anyone doing the actual website and make sure that all your interests and desires are met, that 
you (and your science peers) are conveyed as credible and accurate. i would help you filter. so 
basically that amounts to project management and content provider. 
If you don't like this idea, we should talk about an alternative. I'll still need a better 
understanding of your audience, goals, etc. so i can be efficient about writing. AND I STILL 
NEED THE TRANSCRIPT. 
i apologize for bringing up the efficiency - it is my issue, but i tend to do things 110% and feel the 
need to be cautious with you b/c i sometimes can't read your investment level or interest. also, i 
have bad to take some other jobs so i can afford to keep figuring out where i stand with my 
company and how (and ,if - actually taking to heart some recent talks about making money that i 
have bad with you) i can live comfortably while being able to accommodate (at least part time) 
the things i want to create. 
finally, we still (from the last email): 
"so i got a name / intro from a friend last week for an SEO guy. i was going to reach out to him 
but i wanted to talk to you first about how to frame the project...( we just didn't get a chance to 
discuss when i saw you last.) 
can we have phone convo about how i should proceed with him? or would you like to contact 
him directly?"
