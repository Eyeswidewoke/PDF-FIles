Golden Globes Friday Night Party 
Title: Golden Globes Friday Night Party 
Here are a series of emails I sent to my relatives late Friday night that I thought would amuse you. Going to Golden Globes 
tonight. On to Jane Rosenthal's set Monday at Universal..."Meet the Focker: part four". Fly back after...miss you. 
Having a ball.

Email Al. 
We were told we just 
killed Friday night. It's the lust time we really organized a party in LA...in Penthouse of Chateau Marmont for New York 
Times Magazine...host Stephano Tonchi and Andre Balazs...guests included Tom Cruise, Katie Holmes, her fonner fiancee 
Chris Klein, John Leguizamo, Dani Jansen, Shirley Maclaine, Ben Stiller, Sophia Coppola, Woody Harrelson, Carey 
Mulligan. Anna Kendrick, Jane Fonda, Oliver Stone. Quentin Tarantino. Diane Kruger. Chloe Sevigny, Chace Crawford, 
Teri Hatcher, Jessica Szohr, Glee's Dianna Agron, Matthew Morrison, Claire Danes, Troy Garrity, Christopher Walz, 
Michael Stulberg (A Serious Man) Joan Collins (my idea for a good mix) Mike Medavoy, Tom Ford, Julianne Moore. Lee 
Daniels, Owen Moverman, director of The Messenger, Ed Pressman. Laura Bickford, Rachel Zoe, Brett Ratner, Bob 
Balaban. mogul Ryan Kavanaugh....and on and on. Not bad. Was very excited...after all these years to still be able to 
introduce the greats and near greats to each other...more to come. 
Email #2. 
So tiny Anna Kendrick who is shaking uncontrollably because she has just met Tom Cruise says. "My friend Adam is 
downstairs and I have to go get him into this party. (He is NOT on the list.) I say,"OK, I will go with you..Adam who? 
She says. "Adam Lambert". I say. "Who?". She says. "The guy from American Idol." I say. "I never heard of him.". She 
looks at me like I am from another planet. We go to the parking lot yelling for this Adam...as I go back to the elevators the 
big security goons will not let me back into my own party. Not until Quentin Tarantino and Nazi Christof Walz present 
themselves with this Adam can I get back in. 
After standing on my feet at Chateau from 6:00pm to I I:00pm I 
went to CAA party all the way in Santa Monica at The Buffalo Club...500 cute young agents networking. Found Oliver 
Stone and gorgeous Asian he met in Susan Sarandon's ping pong parlor at "Wall Street 2 wrap party....also Bennett Miller 
(great friend who I forgot to invite earlier) who is prepping "Moneyball" with Brad Pitt. After I told him I was an extra in 
Oliver's film he said I can be an extra in his film and write about it too. What a night.

Best line of the night. 
I walk into CAA party at The Buffalo Club at I I :00pm...the room is completely empty...the party is down a hallway to a 
tented back garden. There is one lone person sitting on a stool sort of behind the front door facing this large empty room. 
It is Sean Penn. Ile sees me and let's out a big friendly smile. I go running over and say, "Hi. How are you? I worked on 
Robin's film in New York". Sean Penn freezes and in a dead pan says, "I don't care. I don't give a damn. That's behind 
me." 
I say, "OK, what are you working on?" He says, "Nothing. I am not working." 
I say, "That's why you look so happy." 
Email #4. 
OH!!! Forgot other great incident. Back at Chateau. I am standing against the entrance hallway wall with Nancy Meyers 
and daughter liallie Meyers-Schyer. First I tell Nancy that I saw her scum bag a -husband Charles the night before at 
Tom Ford's. I can't stand him and Carl Bernstein. I am dismissive of both men and I do that for her and Nom Ephron. It's 
the least I can do to support my two favorite female directors (who actually are a tad competitive). So this blond kid in a 
white turban and skin tight white tube barely covering her pubic hair is in my face, grinning and demanding to be
