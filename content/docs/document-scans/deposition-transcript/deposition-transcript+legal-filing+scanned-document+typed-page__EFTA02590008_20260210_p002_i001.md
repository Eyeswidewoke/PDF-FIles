2. The side walkways (two on north side) are being pressure washed again including the mildewed wall 
copings. This had been done in the spring but will be put on a regular schedule. 
3. The nonconforming "decorative" stairs are being expedited. The existing stairs were always 
nonconforming, not required by code and so ridiculously steep as to be unuseable. I have considered what to do with 
replacing them with something appropriate because direct access to the dock from the pool level would be a very good 
addition. (We had studied several redesign solutions for the pool area ranging from lowering the pool itself to 
recladding posts and columns with stone but discarded them (in part based on broker advice- see below) because they 
seemed too expensive for the value add.) I had intended to replace the existing "stairs" with either (a) new wood stairs 
of acceptable tread/riser proportions rendered in a Regency wood trellis style to match other wood trellis features on 
facade of the house (my preference) or a spiraling stair either in metal or wood. What is your preference? Either of 
these choices seems a sensible resolution because either would be relatively inexpensive, and because whether 
rendered in wood or metal, could be fabricated largely off site. I think either would be both architecturally appropriate 
and attractive. Albert has now asked (Canon Construction- working on Steve's house) to expedite working with Jackie 
Albarran (an architect on the Town landmarks commission) for shop drawings. I was deferring this stage until I knew 
what would be left in the budget. This can be done without Arcom approval as I have previously been advised by town. I 
have asked for Canon's estimate by tomorrow. 
5. Slippery Dock. This was not on my list. Since last weekend, two contractors haverecommend against 
adding non stick strips to the dock. They walked the dock in the rain yesterday and actually recommend doing nothing. If 
I insist, they suggest repainting the dock with a "tough coat" finish but this will result in a painted dock. Please note that 
the neighboring docks (except the cement ones) are finished like our dock. They think the strips will be relatively 
expensive ($5000 to$10,000) and will be unattractive. I will do whatever JEE prefers. 
6. Entry Appearance Issues. JEE wishes to make changes to make the house more important-appearing 
from the street. The ficus arch will be cut away immediately. (I have thought about this in the past but here has been 
divided opinion on this because some find it a charming element but I take your point about hiding the importance of 
the house. ) This will be done by Robens and his helper within a few days. His will make the house more visible. 
Secondly, there are existing 6' gate posts hidden by the ficus arch. Jackie Albarran was at the house (She is an architect-
see above) this morning and will suggest a solution (possibly making these 2' taller to 8'as allowed by code) to help 
make the entry more impressive. Adding gates would require a variance because of setback issues. No other house on 
the street has a working gate. 
7. The central palm tree in the front parking court. Workers have knocked the light at the base of the 
tree down several times which raises the question of whether the tree should be removed. We had it fertilized this 
summer with the intent of keeping it but it does make maneuvering the parking court more difficult. What is your 
opinion? The plan is to gravel the drive as a last item. (Gravel is relatively inexpensive, attractive looking and 
architecturally appropriate.) 
8. Inside the house the disused furniture will be removed immediately. Most of the furniture I am 
lending (some is already there) wont be delivered until the painting is completed. I have been working with Ron Shaffer 
(interior designer/Farrow & Ball stockist) on colors, papers and design. Ron also recommended the painter who runs a 
crew for Gary York. We have been doing very well on a time and materials basis with him. The first floor is painted and 
the painters are now working on trim and two selected bedrooms upstairs now. He and his crew (a varying few painters) 
come at 4 and work late and on weekends. There are also a powder room and one bedroom to be papered. Paint and 
paper are at the house. We are pressuring the painter to complete asap. 
9. The refacing of the kitchen cabinets. Canon is doing this work for $6000. We chose just to reface 
because the cabinets are attractive and unobjectionable and to replace them is a substantial expense. Plus redoing 
kitchens is viewed as a commonplace by buyers 
10. The last pieces are the roof ($34,000) and the graveling of the parking court (a few loads- probably 
under $7500). Note- the roof is not leaking but ageing. I thought it better to replace the roof just to have it off the table 
but this could be eliminated because it should pass inspection as is. 
11. Ruined balusters. There are remnants of old balusters hidden in and peaking out of the hedges. 
These are nonfunctional and, if removed, would not be replaced. I thought they were 
a character element. If JEE 
prefers, I will have them removed.
