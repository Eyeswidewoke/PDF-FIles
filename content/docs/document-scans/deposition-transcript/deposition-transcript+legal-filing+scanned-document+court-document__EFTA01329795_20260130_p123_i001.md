registered as a transacting user entity with the International Registry. In furtherance 
thereof, Mortgagor shall consent, through its professional user entity, to international 
registration upon issuance of the request for consent by the International Registry. •At 
least ninety (90) days prior to the date that any registration of the Aircraft shall expire. 
Mortgagor shall, at its expense, furnish (or cause to be furnished) to Lender a new or 
renewed (as the case may be) certificate of registration for the Aircraft, verifying that the 
Aircraft is properly registered with the FAA in accordance with the requirements of this 
Section 3.1. Accordingly, the parties acknowledge and agree that, as a condition 
precedent to the funding of the loan described in the Agreement, Mortgagor shall execute 
and deliver in favor of Lender an irrevocable power of attorney (and any necessary 
authorizing documents) in form(s) acceptable to Lender, providing Lender with the 
power, in Lender's sole discretion, to re-register or renew the registration of the Aircraft 
("Re-registration POW) should Mortgagor fail to timely complete such process. Lender 
shall not exercise the Re-registration POA or file the Re-registration POA with the FAA 
unless Mortgagor has failed to provide evidence of the re-registration (or renewal of the 
registration) of the Aircraft at least ninety (90) days prior to the date that any registration 
shall expire as described above. It is understood that Lender shall have the right to 
exercise its powers under the Re-registration POA, but shall not be obligated to do the 
same. In the event this Mortgage is assigned by Lender, Mortgagor agrees to execute a 
new Re-registration POA in favor of such assignee in a form substantially similar to the 
original Re-registration POA. 
When the Secured Obligations shall have been 
indefeasibly and fully paid, then the Re-registration POA shall automatically terminate 
and be deemed to cease to exist. 
(ii) 
Mortgagor shall not allow the name of any Person other than 
Lender to be placed on the Airframe and Engines as a designation that might be 
interpreted as a lien thereon, provided, that Mortgagor may cause the Aircraft to be 
lettered and otherwise marked in an appropriate manner for convenience of identification 
of the interest therein of Mortgagor. 
(iii) 
Mortgagor shall not (A) consent to any Person other than Lender 
making any registrations in the International Registry in relation to the Airframe and 
Engines, or (B) execute and deliver any irrevocable de-registration and export request 
authorization to any Person other than the IDERA in favor of Lender. 
(iv) 
Mortgagor shall execute and deliver the IDERA, and cause the 
same to be filed in accordance with the Federal Aviation Act. 
(v) 
Mortgagor may change the registration number of the Aircraft to 
N727KG. 
(b) 
Maintenance. After the Closing Date, and except as may otherwise be 
agreed in writing by Mortgagor and Lender, Mortgagor, at its own cost and expense during the 
term of the Agreement and until full and complete payment of the Note and of all amounts due or --* 
to become due under the Agreement, shall:
