and hedge fund managers around the country? With the knowledge that the investor has 
today, who would put at risk any of their assets without doing a title search, if you will? 
Without doing due diligence? A background check? 
There are two ways a background check can be done. A lot of people don't realize this. 
You either do it with a consent form, which is a written consent where we ask for certain 
information, or you can do it confidentially. Probably about half of our clients do the 
background checks confidentially. Nobody ever knows that they're being done. The reason 
we can do it is that we have all the indices systems. We know how to do the public-record 
searching, and we know where to look. It makes it easier when you have a consent form. 
When you do it confidentially, you get all the information at the end, but it's for the investor 
only. 
So, if you have a relationship with the individual, if it's a deal that you've been working on 
for six months, you feel funny going in at the end and saying "i'm going to hire a SWAT 
team to do a background check." We're usually the last people brought in on a deal. 
MD: What types of investigations are done in the investment banking, private equity and 
hedge fund spaces? 
Strang: We look for criminal history. We look to see if the person is on a watch list for 
money laundering or terrorism, which all falls under the Patriot Act now. We take a look at 
all those different lists to make sure that, No. I, the person isn't involved in any type of 
criminal activity or on any watch list known to man in the United States, and sometimes in 
other countries as well depending on where we're doing the work. We check everything. 
We look to see if they have ever been involved in a crime as an unindicted co-conspirator 
or an associate in some way. We don't just check criminal history; we look at the 
surrounding situations. We really examine them to make sure. 
We look for judgments, liens, bankruptcies, partnership disputes. We take a look at all the 
public indices for any kind of litigation. When you think about the impact that any of these 
things, in and of themselves, can have on a transaction, it could be big. It could be a deal-
killer if we find something or it can be something just to change the actual merits of the 
acquisition, to can change the price, to renegotiate the terms. Very often something small 
will come up during the course of the background check that will have a direct effect on the 
deal itself, either through an employment contract or through the terms of the deal. 
We find people who lie, people who say they graduated from a college or law school and 
they never graduated or they didn't even attend. We find people who have had bankruptcies 
in related fields and never mentioned it to the acquirer or the investors. 
We had a case a few years ago where [a client was] in the process of giving a huge loan and 
we found out that the person who we were about to give the loan to was about to be 
indicted and was under investigation. We found that out independently by doing our own 
research and then doing additional research by checking with sources and luckily stopping 
our client from lending a hundred million dollars before there was a disaster. These are the 
kinds of things that are deal-breakers.
