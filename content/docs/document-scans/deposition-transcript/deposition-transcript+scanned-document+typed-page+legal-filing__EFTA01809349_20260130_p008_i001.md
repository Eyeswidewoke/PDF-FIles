those 
faced by Israel from self-proclaimed Westerners aiming to visit Palestinian lands under occupation and use social media to spread international 
awareness. 
Saudi Social Media Strategies 
While the Western approach toward violence caused by social media substantially concentrates on punishment 40 0 separate example of the 
Saudi govemmentbs social media approach to counterterrorism is the Sakina 
program, which has achieved considerable success in persuading radically inclined youth toward moderation.41 The program is run by a 
nongovernmental organization supported by the Interior Ministry Educator Ministry and Islamic Affairs Ministry. Salunabs 
religious experts deploy social media to hold online discussions in chat moms with people who initially seem to support extremist views. The 
experts aim to ask online extremist sympathizers why they seem to believe in religious violence and then the experts 
point out how those views contradict the peaceful teachings of Islam. 
Such dialogues via social media have had a multiplier effect against violence due to their perpetual availability online where others can read and 
share them. Violence in the Kingdom has been drastically reduced 
since authorities started becoming involved in such social media. Saudi advice has been sought by numerous other Arab countries wishing to 
structure similar antiviolence social media programs.* 
One analyst in the West observed that the Sakina program has "international appear as it draws audiences and interaction throughout the 
Middle East as well as the West and particularly the United States.43 
It thus stands to reason that it asked, Saudi Arabia would be willing to advise Western institutions on structuring effective social media programs 
to rehabilitate a broad spectrum of violent criminals typically indigenous to and rampant in the Westbnot merely 
limited to terrorists. 
Coincidentally, by late June/early July 2011, several mainstream Western media (not 
just social media) reports appeared concerning Googlebs self-proclaimed "idea" to try 
using social media against extremists. 
Curiously. Saudi Arabiabs preexisting Sakina program was not emphasized. But at 
least one of the leaders of the new Google project was formerly with the U.S. 
Department of State. Is it possible that State Department personnel who now work with 
social media 
against extremism may not be aware of highly successful preexisting Saudi social 
media programs against extremism? It would appear that top individuals in the Kingdom 
may need to be more high profile in deploying mainstream media to proclaim the 
success of 
particular Saudi policies, especially pertaining to broad social media access and 
effective nonviolence programs. 
As one mainstream European media source pointed out about the new Google social 
media antiextremist program. "to solve the problems of violent extremism, clever 
technology and algorithms are only a sideshow. "44 
The Saudi approach to antiviolence programs does not rely on social media programs 
alone, but further deploys highly qualified experts, along with available rehabilitation 
programs and incentives for success. 
Tangentially. given the importance of Palestinian welfare to Saudi national security, the 
Kingdombs policies may develop in the direction of supporting social media to provide 
similar success in encouraging 
Israelis. Palestinians. and other Arabs to get to know each other at least initially over 
the Internet while discussing sports, photography, and other common interestsbinauchn°

Conclusion 
It is worth noting that social media are increasingly being used by Arabs and Israelis to promote communication toward peaceful coexistent.*
