In a tough editorial titled "Royal Reform," The Times of London urged the 
royal family, as an institution, to slim down and send its 
children to work. "It is striking," the newspaper notes, that "the 
queen's children have been most constructive while gainfully 
employed." Outside such roles, "they represent more of a risk than a 
benefit to the royal family." 
Prince Andrew is held up as an object lesson. "For too long Prince Andrew 
has lacked a real role," the newspaper said. "He has tried 
and failed to find one because he has been looking in the wrong place." 
Instead of a profession, "he has been content to craft for 
himself the portfolio existence of a freelance royal" and has "depended 
too much on his friends to help support a lifestyle" that he 
could not afford himself, "even as a scion of one of Britain's richest 
families." 
As the Times of London columnist Libby Purves wrote about the latest 
scandal, "Prince Andrew dazzles easily when confronted with 
immense wealth and apparent power. He has fallen for 'friendships' with bad, 
corrupt and clever men, not only in the U.S. but in Libya, 
Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Tunisia, wherever." 
The media frenzy continues, with the British tabloids printing excerpts from 
what are said to be Ms. Roberts's diaries describing her 
frolic with Prince Andrew in a bathtub, though apparently written only five 
years ago, in 2009, eight years after she says the encounter 
occurred. Nor did it help when it emerged recently that Andrew bought a 
Swiss chalet with his ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, for $20 million 
with a joint mortgage. 
Roy Greenslade, a media critic, said the press was right to pursue questions 
about how Prince Andrew finances such a lifestyle on a 
naval pension and a modest stipend from his mother, the queen. 
But Mr. Greenslade also cautioned that Ms. Roberts's allegations "have not 
been tested in court," noting that Mr. Dershowitz, who also 
denies the allegations, wants to do precisely that. 
Still, some were also reminded of the dangers that lie in the latest 
generation's escapades. Prince Harry was photographed frolicking 
naked in Las Vegas and playing strip billiards with a naked woman in August 
2012, and there were photos of the prince surrounded by 
young women in bikinis on the same trip. He was on his way to Afghanistan 
and apologized when the pictures emerged, saying that "I 
probably let myself down, I let the family down, I let other people down." 
It was, he said, "probably a classic example of me probably being too much 
army, and not enough prince." 
The person close to the royals said: "Not everyone did think it was 
charming, but it was spun to be 'just young oats.' But there's a 
potential area of trouble there." 
Mr. York said: "I think he'll work out better than Andrew because he's been 
brought up, due to his mother, in a slightly more modern 
world. But he still has to find a role and a way of life."
