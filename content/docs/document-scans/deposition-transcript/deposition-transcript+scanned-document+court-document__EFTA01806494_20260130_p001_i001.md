Goodbye Palm Beach, and thank you!

<http://www.radaronline.com/> [1]It =80 s hard to say goodbye when you're having fun! 
Yet, this is my last Page2Live <http://www.page2live.com/> [2] entry. 
On Tuesday, I became executive editor of Radar Online <http://www.radaron=ine.comh Ill one of the cou=try's 
biggest celebrity websites. 
The sandbox I get to play in now is a lot larger, and the gig often wi=l take me to Los Angeles and Las Vegas and New 
York City. 
But I leave Th= Palm Beach Post <http://www.pbpost.com/> [3] and the readers who supported me =ith news tips, 
kudos and criticism for the past seven years with a heavy h=art. 
I love Palm Beach County and the Treasure Coast, and not just because it's my home. There are few places in this 
country as quirky as Pa=m Beach, Stuart, Boca and Wellington. News people who work here know they're lucky because, 
indeed, there never is a dull moment. 
For more, look below or click 
My first story was a profile of the controversial Welly developer Glenn Straub, a West Virginia who conducts business 
the way mi=ers in his native state attack coal veins. 
The 2004 piece opened with an anecdote about how Straub was so reviled that polo fans cheered when he injured 
himself in a potentially fatal fall during a Palm Beach Polo Club game. Straub complained about the coverage a little, but 
I believe he secretly loved the attention. 
I'll confess to a rough beginning in Palm Beach society a coup=e months later. 
To some, including the recently deceased Dame Celia Lipton Farris 
<http://www.palmbea=hdailynews.com/society/celia-lipton-farris-a-great-dame-in-every-1316465.h=ml> 14=, a great 
philanthropist, I just didn't dress right. 
After checking me out from head to toe at a party where I might have=20 appeared without a tie and a shave, she told 
me: "Palm Beach had a =ress code, young man!" 
I never got around to buying a blue blazer with gold buttons or loafer= adorned with some crest. 
Publicly, Palm Beach society didn't acknowledge Page2live<=em>. But secretly, I believe it loved the attention. 
Some public officials, meanwhile, will welcome the news of my departur=. 
Weeks ago, a high-ranking official at the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office <http://www.pbso.o=g/> 1=1 half-kiddingly 
promised me lunch at the Palm Beach Yacht Club <http://www.pbyarhtclub.comk [6] if = left the Post. 
I guess stories about on-duty sex, violence, incompetence and corruption at=PBSO was grating on the administration's 
nerves. 
I'm told former West Palm Beach Mayor Lois Frankel, now a U.S. Congress hopeful, made a round of gleeful calls when 
she =eard about Page2Live's demise. 
She could still be traumatized after my story last year about how she ignored a citation for a blown red-light stop caught 
on the very cameras she had installed throughout the city. 
I believe that secretly, however, even Frankel loved the attention. 
What do I miss the most while now working alongside a dedicated staff =f 11 to dig up more stuff on Tiger Woods, 
A=gelina Jolie and Lindsay Lohan? 
You, the reader, the driving force behind Page2Live! 
The site catered to a tough crowd, one as unforgiving of spelling and grammar mistakes as the flaws of the characters I 
wrote about.
