The "boundaries" in question have to do with the very general architecture of the mind/brain, abstracted from 
mechanisms. At this level, the visual system is an input system, and language is both an input and an output system 
(trivially) but also (for reasons discussed in the paper I sent you) a central system. 
The question of awareness doesn't seem to interact with this analysis of general architecture, as far as I can see. The 
analogy you give is a good one for a different topic that I've discussed (as usual rejecting standard doctrine): 
inaccessibility to consciousness of the rule systems that enter into use of language and other actions.

as an apparatus to guide your view . think of a cell where the vast majority of its activity is inside its membrane, only 
what happens on the membrane would be awareness. the activity inside would be inaccessible , but obviously a 
principled relationship exists. between the activity inside ,outside and ACROSS. the membrane is where the input 
output occurs. , the membrane is only aware of what transports across it. and as its own ecology.

Will be interested to learn if that's true. Right now, I don't see the problems you envision. Almost all of what we're 
discussing is inaccessible to consciousness, much like the principles that govern visual interpretation, or most of what 
goes on in the organism, including the cognitive.

i propose that the boundary can be considered where awareness takes place. the old engineering charts drew boxes 
and ignored the lines inscribing the modules . the lines/ membranes were overlooked. . I must confess I have not 
read much of your work, but as i do hopefully the ratio of light to heat will increase. for now Im pretty dim. / like the 
hindrance brought about by tying metrics to math, I fear the language discussions fall into well worn traps

Could be, and I'll be glad to be enlightened.

Input-output-central modules seem to me facts about the organism, like a visual system and the enteric nervous system 
(which I've written about now and them). It's imagine that some more abstract way of looking at things would yield 
insights that can applied in these domains. Actually I've been involved in such efforts, years ago, some of it jointly with 
the late M.P. Schutzenberger, a very good mathematician (connections of automata theory with theory of monoids and 
real variables). And some of this work was picked up by category theorists, but I didn't follow it from there because
