Those who signed off on the failed projects appeared to suffer no consequences. As head of SIGAR John Sopko 
puts it: Reconstruction efforts are "like a child sports game where everyone=gets a trophy." 
If this a=counting wasn't bad enough, consider this: SIGAR has only examined a small percentage of the $110 billion 
effort to rebuild and remodel Afghanistan. The waste totals are likely much higher. Still, =t's often hard to grasp what 
this kind of money means to the average American. Perhaps the most meaningful wa= to underscore what has been lost 
is to look at what the money could have paid =or at home. 
To set the scene, in 2010, as the U.S. was drastically increasing its investment in Afghanistan, a quarter of America's 
ho=eowners — more than 11 million — were underwater on their mortgages, and the =ountry hovered near a 10 
percent unemployment rate. Congress was routinely gutting federal programs.

The $14.7 million spent=on a storage facility the military never used? That could have paid for about 9,800 rape 
kits to be tested — enough to clear the backlog for the entire state of Tennes=ee.

The $456,000 police-training facility that was=so poorly constructed it literally melted in the rain? That could 
have funded =ore than 180,000 dinners for low-income kids, enough for an entire summer.

The $335 million spent on a power plant that the Afghans don't use? That could have paid for permanent 
housing for 3=,000 homeless Americans and $250,000 grants to 20 small-business owners to help =hem commercialize 
new technologies. 
Take the money wasted on those worthless planes, plus that spent on an unused consulate, and fixing the buildings 
constructed with hazardous materials. That could have restored the $714 million cut from the National Institute of 
Health's budget, which funds scientific resea=ch into new treatments for disease. Despite such trade-offs, there's been 
little collective outrage from either the =ublic or Congress about the massive waste in Afghanistan. 
The military, the S=ate Department and USAID provided detailed public responses to the findings in each of SIGAR's 
reports, sometimes disputing the conclusions and recommendations. The reports and their =esponses can be read here. 
This week a Defense Department spokesman told ProPublica that the Pentagon "disagrees with the ass=rtion that $17B 
in projects are 'questionable.'" Often those responsible for t=e failed projects treat SIGAR's findings like unnecessary 
niggling. Their rejoinder, in essence: "Hey, it's a war zone, what do you e=pect?" There's little time spent on pondering 
the bigger question: If it's a war zone, why were we pouring billions i=to reconstruction?
