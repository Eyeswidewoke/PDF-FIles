Finance Charges: Average Daily Balance Method for Calculation of Finance Charges:We use the Average Daily 
Balance method to calculate Finance Charges on your Account. Under ars method,we figure the Finance Charges on your 
Account by applying the daily periodic rate to the Average Daly Balance (as describedbelow) for each feature (such as 
Purchase, Cash Advance and Balance Transfer features) of your Account (including current transactions). To get the 
Average Daily Seance for each feature, we (1) take the beginning balance for the feature each day (including unpaid 
Finance Charges from previous billing periods), (2) add any new transactions, debits, or fees (3) subtract any payments or 
credits, anc1(4) make any appropriate adjusts,* . For each day after the first day of the billing pencid, we also 
add an amount of interest equal to the previous days daily balance multiplied .by the daily periodic rate 
for the feature. This gives us the daily balance for the feature for that day and the beginning balance for the feature for 
the next day. If this balance is negative, i is considered to be zero. Then, we add up all the daily balances for the 
feature for the biting period and divide the total by the number of days in the billing period. This gives us the Average 
Daily Balance for the feature. For all features except Cash Advances and certain promotions, the Average Daily Balance 
will be considered to be zero if you paid the New Balance, if any, shown on your previous month's statement by the 
Payment Cue Date shown on that statement. If you multi* the Average Daly Balance for each feature by the number 
of days in the billing period and the daily periodic rate for that feature, the result will be the Finance Charge 
assessed on that feature, except for variations caused by rounding. The total Finance Charge for the tiling period 
caictiated Py gang the Finance Charges assessed on an features of the Account. This method of calculating the 
Average Dray Balance and Finance Charoi results in daily compoundingof Finance Charges. The minimum 
Finance Charge for any billing periodin which Finance Charges are imposed is $0.50.
