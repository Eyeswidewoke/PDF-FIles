I've heard that expression. I said, "You should write a book about it." She did. I wrote the foreword and it was for me 
one of the milestones of my life. And so I applied to Reichlin's fellowship and I got it, and it was like the most prestigious 
thing you could get. 
But then I had my own issues with medicine. Is this interesting to you? So I had my own issues, including the fact that I 
was seeing patients and I can see that the response was not predictable. You could give two patients the same disease 
and they had completely different outcomes. So at least in human beings, we didn't respond predictably. As does always 
occur, the bell-shaped curve, which there is to everything now. So, I started getting interested in mind-body medicine, 
and I would say I probably coined the phrase. In 19851 wrote a book which nobody would accept, no publisher would 
accept, so I published it on my own, called Creating Health <https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/health> : 
Exploring the Mind-Body Connection. The book then was picked up by Houghton Mifflin and became at national 
bestseller. And I wrote another book called Quantum Healingwhich was vilified by the medical establishment because I 
was basically proposing, long before anybody was talking about entanglement, I was talking about the entanglement of 
mind, body, neuropeptides, molecules of emotion, etc., etc., from my own experience. But the books did very well with 
the lay public. The New England Journaldid a good review of Quantum Healing in 1988, but basically I'm still ridiculed for 
it by the regular medical establishment. 
Matt: Were you talking about quantum entanglement—
Deepak: I wasn't using the word quantum entanglement. I was talking about the fact that thoughts and molecules are 
inseparable, basically, and that between a thought and a molecule there's a gap, and that gap is consciousness. It's now 
30 years since the book, and Rudy was my co-author. He's a neuroscientist at Harvard and the head of neuroscience 
<https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/neuroscience> at Mass General. He wrote the foreword to the reissue of 
Quantum Healing, which I'll send you, but it's almost now quaint with all that we know of now. But I used that word 
which annoyed a lot of people, including Richard Dawkins, who ridiculed me, and I said, "Listen, I'm using it as a 
metaphor." 
All science, I was saying, was a metaphor anyway, but it was then that I also got very interested in meditation 
<https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/meditation> . And then I went to India, and I spend about 10 years in 
India talking to these teachers, basically, of consciousness, where consciousness is fundamental reality, it is beyond 
thought or experience, and the word they use is pure consciousness. So I went through an experience with a teacher of 
meditation who basically asked me questions like I can ask you right now. What is this? [Matt: "It's a glass."] And what's 
this? [Matt: "Flower."J And what's this? [Matt: "A candle."] What's this?" [Matt: "A Sharpie."J "What's this?" [Matt: "A 
hand. Did I get them all right?"J So far. I said the same thing. But I was having a conversation with somebody, and he 
said to me, "Those are human constructs." And I was trying to tell this person, who was a meditation teacher, I was 
telling him about the molecules of emotion. Serotonin. He said they're not real. 
So that got me thinking, okay, and I seriously went into wanting to experience pure consciousness, which they all talk 
about, as transcendence, beyond subject-object split. So, this person that I had this conversation with, he said, "If you 
were a baby and you had no language, not exposed to any language, this would not be a hand. This would be a shape, a 
form, a color, maybe a smell <https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/scent> , a texture, a sensation, as an activity 
of consciousness. But then you would be told, 'This is a hand, you have a body,' and then you would have an 
interpretation of that experience, which you would call a thought. And then you would also be told, 'This is your body. 
You have a mind. You're Indian. And you come from a Hindu family.' All social constructs. Fundamental reality is sensory 
perception <https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/cognition> , which is an activation of consciousness, and its 
interpretation is thought. The rest is a story. Mind, body, and even universe is a story." Well, that was pretty mind-
boggling for a young person at the age of 35. I'd already trained now, here. Slowly, that lead to how one construct leads 
to another construct. Okay, so this is an iPhone. It's matter. Well I have now reified sensory experience in consciousness, 
an activity of consciousness in consciousness, with a construct, iPhone. Then I reify it further, made of matter. And now 
this is very convenient. I can study it. It's made of molecules, made of atoms. So one construct leads to another 
construct, particles. Then you get ultimately to possibility waves and then you're stuck again.
