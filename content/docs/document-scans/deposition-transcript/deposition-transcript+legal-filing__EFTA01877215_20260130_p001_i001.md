Subject: Re: 
I leave tomorrow for two to three weeks. 
thank you for your kind words.. the solution as you 
put it , is for you to get a job. a new place to live , and begin to lead an life that entails 
contributing as opposed to merely consuming. the tough problem as you put it , is your adherence 
to misplaced and exagerratcd expectations. what is the soltuion to that. 2 find you a boyfriedn? 
find you a trainer ( whoops ). how do i get you to understand that it is the prison of your ideas 
that holds you back „

I don't know how to respond; your recollection of the past, our relationship and you advice in '09 is 
skewed at best so I can't comment on it. I can't help but see this 'advice' as a decision to avoid 
making an effort. You have always underestimated me and I see you continue to do so. You continue 
to discourage me and crush ambitions. I ask again and I really would like an answer - why? You 
generalize and throw me in the same category as most average girls my age. Yes, I refuse to stoop 
down to that level and be bound by Your perception of my limitations. But I will be very disappointed 
if I am again forced to solvgbilbymyself after asking for your help and meeting with your refusal. 
I am still a young girl from 
with no money, experience or high powered connections and I 
am able to solve problems and get things done that you deem unfeasible...don't you think that 
sounds unlikely? I've seen what you are capable of when you try and it is way beyond what ANYONE 
else can do. You are the BEST at finding creative solutions to tough problems. Jeffrey, my suspicion 
that you are not willing to help is slowly turning into concern that maybe you are not well. If that is 
the case, please just tell me. I would not want to add any stress for you and I'd like to remind you 
that should you ever need me, I will drop everything to help you regardless of whether you are 
mean, sick, senile, poor, investigated for something i could have done, or incarcerated & in need of 
an escape. I would always give up my life to redeem yours and I will forever be protective of you. 
You know how to get my blood pressure up but our differences are meaningless when it comes to 
your wellbeing. Keep that in mind. Now back to that argument...what is really going on?
