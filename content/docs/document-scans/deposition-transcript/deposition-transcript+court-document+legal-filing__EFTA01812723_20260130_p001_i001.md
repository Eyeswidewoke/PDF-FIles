A couple of my favourites are as follows; 
Isabel calls me to say she is having trouble with her Portuguese domestics and as I 'have a way with staff" 
would I mind dropping in to see them, which I do a couple of days later. 
I forget their names, but lets call them Jose and Paulina. I ask Jose what the matter is. He replies and I quote as 
near verbatim as i can recall; 
"Sir, its not that I mind Mi 
aming at me. its not that I mind 
creaming at me in front of 
my wife, its not that I min 
lapping me, its not that I mind herslapping me in from of my wife, its just 
that I cannot accept being slapped in the street" !!! 
Another good one was when I took 
o Bali, Indonesia 15 yrs ago. Whilst there she did a lot of shopping of 
local artifacts and hand crafts, inclu ing ordering a large bolt of fabric specially woven to her instructions. She 
asked Ugo Gerasati, the Brazilian socialite who had a fabricshop out there at the time specialising in Balinese 
batiquesetc, how he proposed sending this to her once completed, as she had no intention whatsoever of being 
paying outrageous postage and packing charges. He told her that he had an excellent solution, which would 
involve no costs at all. He would ask the next English customer who happened to be in the shop when the fabric 
was ready, if they would mind taking it with them back to London. Quite a favour to ask of anyone especially 
when this bolt was the size of a large packing case. 
In any event the late Mary Howard (Lord Patrick Howard's charming wife) dropped by a few weeks later to visit 
Ugo and was tasked with taking this huge package to London which she readily agreed to do. 
l ii 
On arrival in London, the first thing she did 
ii 
all 
hom she had never met. She did this promptly at 
9:00Am in the moming, not a good time for 
h
night owl and generally only goes to sleep around 6 
and then wakes around lunchtime. The resu o 
is call, which of course woke Isabel. was for her to scream at 
Mary "Do you know what time this is? Do you think this is an office?" To which Mary replied, somewhat startled 
at the hostdity of this reaction, " I was calling to let you know I have brought your fabric back from Bali". 
not remotely mollified, cursed her for waking her up and added as an aside "Well drop it off this afternoon at 
4:00pm" and then slammed down the phone without so much as good bye. 
Mary, somewhat aghast by this behaviour, generous to the extreme, put it down to a bad night and that 
afternoon turned up at 
h the huge parcel. She rang the door and waited and waited and 
waited and finally Isabel opei
. ...
t
or on the chain and asked who she was. "I am Mary Howard with your 
fabric from Bar. "Oh" snaps Isabel "You are that wretched woman who woke my so inconsiderately this 
morning" with that she opens the door, grabs the package and the slams it shut in Mary's face. 
Mary now finally cracks and bursts into tears on 
doostep and calls her best friend Lynn Guinness to tell 
her what has happened. Lynn, quite rightly outraged by this behaviour, calls me and tells me to speak to 
immediatly.
