=span style="font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:lrem">During that int=nse 
investigation, the state prosecutors extensively gathered and analyzed=C24>the evidence, met face-to-face with many 
of the asserted victims, con=idered their credibility — or lack thereof — and considere= the extent of exculpatory 
evidence, including sworn testimony=C240from many that they lied about being eighteen years old to be allowed=into 
Mr. Epstein's home. After months of negotiations, the s=ate prosecutors believed they had reached a reasoned 
resolution of the mat=er that vindicated the public interest — a resolution entirely con=istent with that of cases 
involving other similarly-situated defendants.=C2*The system worked as it should have.

Then, in came the feds. The United Sta=es Attorney's Office extensively and 
aggressively investigated whether=Mr. Epstein had engaged in a commercial human trafficking ring, targeted m=nors, or 
used the internet or traveled interstate in the process..=A0 But that's not what this was and that's not w=at happened. 
That is precisely why the federal authoritiesQ=804, ultimate decision to defer prosecution to the state was th= right 
one. 
=owever, the federally-demanded resolution was not without conditions. The 
=ederal prosecutors insisted on various unorthodox requirements that M=. Epstein's experienced defense team had 
never seen imposed on any=defendant anywhere. Under the federally-forced deal, Jeffrey was requ=red to request that 
the state prosecutors demand the imposition of a thirt=-month sentence that included both jail time and the strict=st 
conditions of probation: lifetime sex-offender registration. Those drac=nian measures were far more than warranted by 
the state grand jury4o=804$ indictment and would not have otherwise been required under th= previously agreed-
upon state disposition. As part of this highly unu=ual deal, the government required Jeffrey to pay for a highly 
ex=erienced group of attorneys to bring claims against him on behalf of = government list of asserted victims. Jeffrey 
was required to waive the ri=ht to challenge those claims without being provided the asserted victim.=804>s identities 
by the government until after he was incarcerated. =Importantly, the feds' decision to decline prosecution in deference 
to=the state in exchange for these extraordinary requirements =as reviewed and approved at the multiple levels of the 
U.S. Department of =ustice. Jeffrey took full responsibility, complied with th= feds' demands, served his sentence, and 
in the process was treate= exactly the same (including his time served) as any other state=incarcerated individuals. His 
conduct while in custody was exemplary= and so characterized by the state custodial authorities. =/u> 
=effrey Epstein has paid his debt to society. The challenges to his Ag=eement 
with the Government must also be understood as challenges to t=e millions Mr. Epstein paid to the asserted victims and 
their lawyers purs=ant to that agreement. Amongst the beneficiaries of the Epstein-Feder=l Government Agreement 
were the many victims who collectively received man= millions as a result of the conditions imposed on Mr. Epstein that 
preven=ed him from meaningfully contesting civil liability — moneys that =ould be at issue if requests to invalidate the 
agreement were granted. 
Our nation faces vitally important challenges, many involving the t=eatment of 
women and basic human dignity. Voices are rightly being r=ised speaking truth to power, especially about women in the 
workplace.,=A0 But Jeffrey's offenses of yesteryear, which were entirely outsi=e of the workplace, have long since 
been redressed by the criminal justice=system. He fully and faithfully has performed every p=omise and obligation 
required of him by state and federal authorities..=A0 In the spirit of the bedrock American belief in second chances 
and fund=mental fairness, that chapter in Jeffrey's otherwise-productive a=d charitable life should be allowed to close 
once and for all. <=span>
