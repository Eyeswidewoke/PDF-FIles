your Office and Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2 would stipulate to a set of facts to provide 
context-for the Court while we litigate the legal issue in dispute, that is whether the CVRA 
applies even though no federal charges were ultithately filed. If your Office prevails on that 
issue, the victims would obviously have no claim under the CVRA. The victims would then 
pursue their appellate rights in the Eleventh Circuit. If, however, the victims prevail on that 
issue, then your Office would take "no position" on the remedy sought by the victims for the 
violation of their rights afforded them under the Act. Your Office would essentially stand aside 
and agree not to take any position on the victims' request to set aside the NPA as a remedy for 
that violation of the victims' rights. 
We understood from our meeting with you in December that you wanted to do what 
you could to help the victims in this case. Yet as we understood Dexter and Marie today, they 
were taking the position that we would receive no cooperation of any sort from your Office. 
And we further understood from them that your Office was now going to take the position that 
even if the victims' congressionally-mandated rights were violated, there is simply no remedy 
for those violations and thus the victims should have no recourse for the violations. 
On behalf of our clients, we want to once again reach out and make sure that your 
Office wants to move to an adversarial litigation posture on these issues. We simply don't 
understand why your Office is now going to take a litigating position hostile to ours on issues 
beyond the legal question of when CVRA rights attached in this case. We appreciate that the 
Department has institutional concerns about the timing of CVRA rights. But we don't 
understand why your Office is now going to fight against the victims in their efforts seeking to 
overturn a NPA that by any measure is unfair. This is not simply our view —the unfairness of 
the NPA has now attracted comment literally throughout the world, including serving as the 
basis for an unfavorable portrayal in a recent Law and Order: Special Victim Episode and a 
feature story yesterday in the London-based Sunday Mail. We are not asking your Office to join 
us in our efforts to throw out this unjust agreement. But can't your Office simply stand on the 
sidelines and let us make our case against Epstein. Fighting a politically well-connected 
billionaire is difficult enough, without having the weight of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the 
Southern District of Florida thrown against us too. We respectfully make one last request for 
you to move forward with our proposal for narrowing differences between us. 
Withholding Favorable Evidence 
If you feel that your Office must fight us in court on every possible issue, then we are 
respectfully writing to request that we resolve one issue outside of court: Whether your Office 
can withhold from the victims evidence in its possession that is favorable to their CVRA case. 
During our conference call with Dexter and Marie, we pointed out that if we were criminal 
defense attorneys representing criminals, your Office would promptly turn over to us all 
information in its possession that was helpful to these criminals under the Brady and Giglio 
decisions. We asked your Office to extend to the victims the same assistance that it would 
provide to criminals — i.e., we asked Dexter and Marie to voluntarily provide to us information
