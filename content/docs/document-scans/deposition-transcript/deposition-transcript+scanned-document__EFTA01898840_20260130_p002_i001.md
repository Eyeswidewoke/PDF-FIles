Upon further investigation, the buildings across the street from AYH were briefly evacuated at 
the same time as our event, as a result of an earthquake. According to the USGS website, 
there have been 8 earthquakes in the last week, and at least 2 today in our region.

On the day of the incident, Joe answered Kenny's question regarding how many people 
were on the deck, his answer was "he confirmed with Glen (the owner of Island Time) that 
there was less than 50 people on the deck. The norm is to have in excess of 100 people at 
Island Time, especially on a Friday. Due to the rain on Sunday, I am told that there were 
fewer people on the facility. This was an obvious question that Kenny asked at the time, along 
with, were they dancing (no dancing). 
Regarding Joe being drunk:- I am told by Kenny that Joe was very coherent and clear 
when he called to report the incident on Sunday, Kenny sensed no slurred voice or lack of 
clarity. Kenny again asked Joe today, when he arrived on the facility and had he been drinking 
before, and his answer was "he had not been anywhere to have had a drink prior to arriving at 
the bar at around 15:15hrs, he was dealing with the situation beyond 18:00hrs where he then 
had a couple of beers at Molly Maloncs and left the facility at 19:30hrs". 
I hope this helps — we are really trying to be all over this. I am flying down Eric Simonton (IGY 
— who is also an engineer) at IGY's cost to meet with the structural engineer. Jan Cole (IGY) 
is already working with Komreich's office and London — we have $50,000 deductible and she 
is making sure that the process of documenting and accounting for damage including business 
interruption is monitored in the event we can file a claim. If there are things we aren't doing 
or haven't thought of— we will do them if he makes a suggestion. Our agenda has been (i) 
ensure safety (ii) assess scope of damage (iii) come up with a plan to fix the damage (iv) see 
how the remediation costs affect the overall plan we have developed to try to turn around 
American Yacht Harbor. 
If Mr. Epstein wants, I am happy to go to STT with Kenny and meet with him and his advisors 
etc.
