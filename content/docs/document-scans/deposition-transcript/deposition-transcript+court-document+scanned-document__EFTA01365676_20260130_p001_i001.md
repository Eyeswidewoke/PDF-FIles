When the Applicable Issuers shall have a Paying Agent that is not also the 
Registrar, they shall furnish, or cause the Registrar to furnish, no later than the fifth calendar day 
after each Record Date a list, if necessary, in such form as such Paying Agent may reasonably 
request, of the names and addresses of the Holders and of the certificate numbers of individual 
Notes held by each such Holder. 
Whenever the Applicable Issuers shall have a Paying Agent other than the 
Trustee, they shall, on or before the Business Day next preceding each Payment Date or 
Redemption Date, as the case may be, direct the Trustee to deposit on such Payment Date with 
such Paying Agent, if necessary, an aggregate sum sufficient to pay the amounts then becoming 
due (to the extent funds are then available for such purpose in the Payment Account), such sum 
to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto and (unless such Paying Agent is 
the Trustee) the Co-Issuers shall promptly notify the Trustee of its action or failure so to act. Any 
Cash deposited with a Paying Agent (other than the Trustee) in excess of an amount sufficient to 
pay the amounts then becoming due on the Notes with respect to which such deposit was made 
shall be paid over by such Paying Agent to the Trustee for application in accordance with Article 
10. 
The initial Paying Agent shall be as set forth in Section 7.2. Any additional or 
successor Paying Agents shall be appointed by Issuer Order with written notice thereof to the 
Trustee (with a copy to the Collateral Manager); provided, however, that so long as any Class of 
Senior Notes is rated by a Rating Agency and with respect to any additional or successor Paying 
Agent, either (i) such Paying Agent has a long-term debt rating of "AA-" or higher by S&P and 
"Aa3" or higher by Moody's or a short-term debt rating of "P-1" by Moody's and "A-1+" by 
S&P or (ii) each Rating Agency confirms that employing such Paying Agent will not result in a 
downgrade or withdrawal of its ratings on the Notes of any such Class or Classes. In the event 
that such successor Paying Agent ceases to have a long-term debt rating of "AA-" or higher by 
S&P and "Aa3" or higher by Moody's or a short-term debt rating of at least "P-1" by Moody's 
and "A-1+" by S&P, the Co-Issuers shall promptly remove such Paying Agent and appoint a 
successor Paying Agent. The Co-Issuers shall not appoint any Paying Agent that is not, at the 
time of such appointment, a depository institution or trust company subject to supervision and 
examination by federal and/or state and/or national banking authorities. The Co-Issuers shall 
cause each Paying Agent other than the Trustee to execute and deliver to the Trustee an 
instrument in which such Paying Agent shall agree with the Trustee (and if the Trustee acts as 
Paying Agent, it hereby so agrees), subject to the provisions of this Section 7.3, that such Paying 
Agent will: 
(a) 
allocate all sums received for payment to the Holders of Notes for which it 
acts as Paying Agent on each Payment Date and any Redemption Date among such Holders in 
the proportion specified in the applicable report to the extent permitted by applicable law; 
(b) 
hold all sums held by it for the payment of amounts due with respect to the 
Notes, in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto until such sums shall be paid to such 
Persons or otherwise disposed of as herein provided and pay such sums to such Persons as herein 
provided;
