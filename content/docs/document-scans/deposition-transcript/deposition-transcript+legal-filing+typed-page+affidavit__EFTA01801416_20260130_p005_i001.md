And he did this with hardly any evidence th=t he absorbed in any unhealthy way the barrage of harsh criticism thrown a= 
him. Besides, who is to say his optimism, so eloquently projected, was ar=ificial? 
On the other hand, =yndon Johnson and Richard Nixon clearly were Active-Negative, in Barber'= terms. So were Herbert 
Hoover and Woodrow Wilson, as Barber suggests. And=it isn't difficult to accept some of Barber's list of Active-
Positives—Thomas Jefferson, Franklin Roosevelt=and Harry Truman. 
All of which sugges=s that Barber's categorizations could be viewed as a kind of parlor game= There is plenty of room for 
discussion and debate on just where various p=esidents should be placed. No doubt partisan impulses will creep into the 
parlor game as well. 
So let's all go i=to the parlor and talk about Obama. 
He took office withrbig ambitions and a manifest resolve to change American society in very si=nificant ways. This was 
manifest particularly in his Affordable Care Act, =esigned to transform the way we dispense health care in America and 
increase federal intrusion into a sixth of the =urrent economy (projected to be 20 percent of the U.S. economy by 2020). 
A=d he was willing to do this without a single opposition vote, which reflec=ed an almost breathtaking political audacity. 
His energy bill represents another reflection of his ambitions, =nd multiple actions in the regulatory realm (some of 
questionable constitu=ional validity) reflect also Obama's preference for America as a Europea=-style social democracy. 
Since the country has generally shunned such a course since the early years of the N=w Deal and a brief spurt of federal 
activity under Lyndon Johnson, Obama=92s presidential temperament clearly falls into the Active category. 
But is he a Negativ= or a Positive? The Positive presidents relished the job and the grand nec=ssity to move events by 
persuading, cajoling, bargaining with and perhaps =ccasionally threatening other players in the political arena. The great 
Active-Positive presidents all had fun i= the job. They showed a zest and enthusiasm that was infectious, not just =ith the 
American people but, more significantly, with members of Congress.=/span> 
We sure don't see=any of that with Obama. Edward Klein, a former New York Times Magazine edi=or and author of a 
book on Obama called The Amateur, has written that Obam= "doesn't learn from his mistakes, but repeats policies that 
make our economy less robust and our nation less saf=." That's a classic Active-Negative trait, according to Barber. 
Ind=ed, as Barber predicted in 1969, shortly after Richard Nixon's election,="The danger is that Nixon will commit 
himself irrevocably to some disastrous course of action. This is precisely the pos=ibility against which he could defend 
himself by a stylistic adjustment in-his relations with his White House friends." 
That is another kno=k on Obama—that he surrounds himself with like-minded and sometimes syco=hantic underlings 
who reinforce his actions rather than testing his thinki=g against those who may harbor differing thoughts and 
perceptions. Vernon Jordan, the big-time Washington lawyer (a=d a solid Democrat), tells the story of a golf game in 
which Obama was par=nered with New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, who also is in a very select =roup of true 
experts on the financial markets. Afterward, Bloomberg remarked that, through four hours of riding =he cart with the 
mayor, Obama asked his golf partner not a single question=about anything. 
Do we see any presi=ential zest or political joy in this chief executive? Hardly. He seems alw=ys stern, beset, frustrated 
and angry. It's as if he expects the opposit=on to join him in whatever he wants to do for the simple reason that they 
should want to make his life easier. Af=er all, he's the president. 
Here's how Barber=describes the Active-Negative: "...relatively intense effort and rela=ively low emotional reward for 
that effort. The activity has a compulsive =uality...His self-image is vague and discontinuous. Life is a hard struggle to 
achieve and hold power, hampered by the condemn=tions of a perfectionistic conscience. Active-negative types pour 
energy i=to the political system, but it is an energy distorted from within."<=span> 
Nothing illustrates=this more starkly than Obama's insistence on shirking his responsibility=as president to lead the way 
out of Washington's increasingly dire fisca= deadlock, with the government partially shut down and a possible financial
