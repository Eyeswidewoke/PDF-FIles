Upon Seller's acceptance of this Offer via Seller's signature below and 
not later than three (3) business days following acceptance of this Offer 
(provided acceptance precedes the Expiration Date, as such term is 
defined below), Buyer will place a good faith, fully refundable 
$300,000 USD deposit ("Deposit") in escrow with Insured Aircraft Title 
Service, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, or such other escrow agent as shall 
be mutually agreed ("Escrow Agent"). The Deposit shall only become 
non-refundable upon Buyer's written Technical Acceptance (defined 
below) of the Aircraft and shall be applied towards the Purchase 
Price. Upon this Offer being signed by Seller and Buyer, and the Deposit 
received into escrow, the Seller agrees to hold the Aircraft off the market 
as deal pending and not entering into any material sale discussions or 
negotiations while good faith sales efforts continue between Buyer and 
Seller 
If: (i) Buyer rejects the Aircraft for any reason prior to Technical 
Acceptance, or (ii) the parties fail to execute the Aircraft Purchase 
Agreement as provided below, or (iii) the Buyer gives notice to Seller and 
the Escrow Agent at any time before Buyer's written Technical 
Acceptance that any condition regarding the Aircraft is unacceptable in 
Buyer's sole discretion, the Deposit shall be promptly refunded to Buyer, 
less any remaining amounts due the Inspection Facility for the Inspection 
costs if the inspection has commenced and costs incurred. 
Upon acceptance of this Offer as signed by Buyer and Seller, Buyer at 
its expense may dispatch an evaluation team to the Aircraft's current 
location at a mutually agreed to time, to review the Aircraft, all records, 
and logs to confirm the condition is as represented and to review the 
records to determine and define the requirements of a pre purchase 
inspection. Within three (3) business day after completing the Initial 
review of the Aircraft and its records, Buyer will provide Seller with either 
a written acceptance as to the condition of the Aircraft and will proceed 
with the provisions of this Offer as will be documented in a signed 
Aircraft Purchase Agreement or, if Buyer elects not to proceed for any 
reason following the Initial Inspection, Buyer will notify Seller of rejection, 
withdraw the Offer and remove the Buyer's Deposit from Escrow. In 
such case neither party will have any further obligation to the other 
regarding this Aircraft and the Aircraft will be immediately available for 
sale or lease to third parties. 
Buyer 
may, 
for 
any 
reason 
or 
no 
reason, 
at 
any 
time 
before Technical Acceptance of the Aircraft, reject the Aircraft and 
receive a full refund of the Deposit by providing Seller with written notice 
of such rejection as provided in the Aircraft Purchase Agreement. 
Should Buyer accept the Aircraft, Buyer will provide Seller with an 
executed Technical Acceptance Certificate for the Aircraft that will be an 
exhibit as provided in the Aircraft Purchase Agreement ("Technical 
Acceptance"). 
At the time of acceptance the Deposit will be 
nonrefundable as defined in the Agreement.
