He told me about his kids... showed me them pictures :) 
He to=d me how he met Jeffrey and when I said that I got the feeling that they kn=w each other 
for years.. he said that he doesn't know why, but he really li=ed Jeffrey and he feels like if they would known each other

write on Japanese language :)

get the tickets - would I go with him... And I said yes:) 
He asked me like 3 times when exactly I'm coming back from Ukraine, how=long I gonna stay at 
home etc. - I got the feeling like he has some plan fo= me and he trying to figure it out, like how long I gonna stay here

But whole our conversation I spoke with him as he my old friend and I r=ally didn't want him to 
get the feeling like I need something from him. 
He asked me what I'm doing on this weekend and I said that I don't kn=w yet.
