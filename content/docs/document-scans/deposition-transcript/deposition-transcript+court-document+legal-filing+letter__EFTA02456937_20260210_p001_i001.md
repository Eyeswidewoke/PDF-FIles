Re: harmony 
harmonics of course. but pleasant h=rmonies not the same. can natural thir=s fifths etc be used to calm a group or 
a child ? 
may=e. it is clear that the energy it takes to deconst=uct shrill and dissonant sounds like a baby crying 
,have reasons. =AO does pleasant harmony represent something like the vi=ual act of looking at a still lake. represent 
" no =redators" , 
I love the homing pigeons=C2 , . It would be awful if the chinese stars and moon real=y did have an 
underlying reason. :) . Im not sure =hy people have moved to worms if we have yet to figure the simplest =acteria cell. 
and its reasons and formula for division. =C2 what evolutionary advantage, would there be for dividing. =AO unless it 
made the odds more difficult if under attack. =AO energy would need to be expended on attacking copies, =etc. and 
some of " you" might survive?

I much enjoyed our conversation and hare been puzzling over the evolutionary basis of our appreciation of 
harmony, not something l=E2 d ever thought about before until you brought up this fascinating question.=C2 
Fortunately as I was puzzling over it, the soun=s of a workshop my wife, Jill Purce, was giving in a large room 
below me in =ur house came wafting up. She teaches chanting and meditation and was giving a special master class on 
overtone chanting, a form of chant=ng which brings out the overtones which are always implicit, that are made explicit 
in this Mongolian technique. 
So I think=the answer is fairly clear. Although harmony in musical sense of the=word is not a major part of our 
evolutionary heritage, harmonics certainly are.=C2 If you and I sing the syllable 000 on the note C, our voices will sound 
different and will be recognisable to any people w=o know us because there are different patterns of overtones. This is 
wh= a flute playing C sounds different from a cello or a trumpet. Just to recognise somebody else's voice requires this 
detection of =vertones which are, quite literally, harmonics and the same is true in the animal kingdom. Sheep can 
recognise their lambs by sound, and vice versa, again based on a subtle detection of harmonics.=C2 
So our brains and our mental habits have over a=long period established the ability to detect harmonics, and to 
recognise differ=nt patterns of harmonics. So when musical harmonies come along, our brains and minds are naturally 
receptive to them having had millions of years of practice. 
I myself think that the three dimensional patterns of rhythmic activity set up by the perceptions of sounds, and 
indeed all other sensations, resonate with previous similar patterns and involve an inherent memory given by morphic 
resonance. 
Best wis=es
