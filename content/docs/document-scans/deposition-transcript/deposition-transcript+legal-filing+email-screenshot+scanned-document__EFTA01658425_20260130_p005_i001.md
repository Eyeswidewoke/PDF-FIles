Minneapolis police officer's knee and pleading for air, circulated on Memorial Day." The Wall 
Street Journal (8/24, Ailworth, Subscription Publication, 7.57M), among other news outlets, 
also reports the story. 
County Officials Upset Guard Wasn't Sent In Earlier. The Kenosha (WI) News 
(8/24, Tatge-Rozell, 63K) recounts that "Kenosha County Emergency Management Director Lt. 
Horace Staples said the declaration of a State of Emergency at 11 p.m. Sunday started the 
process of activating the deployment." Kenosha County supervisors Terry Rose and Zach 
Rodriguez "said Monday they feel 'someone dropped the ball." Said Rodriguez, "Myself and 
other supervisors were knocking on the doors of other supervisors at 2 a.m. because the 
National Guard hadn't been sent to Kenosha." 
USA Today (8/24, Yancey-Bragg, Culver, 10.31M) indicates that "by late Sunday, multiple 
vehicles were set ablaze and windows were smashed along city thoroughfares as crowds faced 
off with law enforcement," as "officers in riot gear stood in lines and SWAT vehicles remained on 
the streets to move people away from city buildings despite the declaration of an overnight 
curfew." 
Police Union Urges Public To Withhold Judgment, Slams Evers' "Irresponsible" 
Statement. The Kenosha (WI) News (8/24, 63K) reports "Pete Deates, president of the 
Kenosha Professional Police Association," issued a statement saying, "Anytime deadly force is 
used, our hearts go out to those affected by it. We assure you an independent investigation is 
being conducted by the Wisconsin Department of Justice, Division of Criminal Investigation." 
Until its completion, "we ask that you withhold prejudgment about the incident and please the 
let process take place. Governor Evers' statement on the incident was wholly irresponsible and 
not reflective of the hardworking members of the law enforcement community, not to mention 
the citizens of the City of Kenosha." Moreover, added Deates, "the video currently circulating 
does not capture all the intricacies of a highly dynamic incident." 
NBC Nightly NewsVi (8/24, story 3, 2:25, Holt, 6.03M) showed Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes 
(D) saying, "This was not an accident. This wasn't bad police work. This felt like some sort of 
vendetta being taken out on a member of our community." 
Biden Calls For Police Accountability And Denounces "Systemic Racism," Doesn't 
Condemn Riots. Axios (8/24, Allassan, 521K) reports "Joe Biden on Monday called for 'an 
immediate, full and transparent investigation" into the shooting of Blake. Biden said on 
Facebook, "Mills morning, the nation wakes up yet again with grief and outrage that yet 
another Black American is a victim of excessive force. This calls for an immediate, full and 
transparent investigation and the officers must be held accountable. ... Equal justice has not 
been real for Black Americans and so many others. We are at an inflection point. We must 
dismantle systemic racism. It is the urgent task before us." 
The CNBC (8/24, Pramuk, 3.62M) website and the New York Post (8/24, Fitz-Gibbon, 
4.57M), among other news outlets, also carry Biden's statement. Breitbart (8/24, Pollak, 673K) 
reports, meanwhile, that Biden "failed to condemn the rioting, looting, and arson that followed 
throughout the working-class city." 
WPost Calls Wisconsin Shooting A "Sickening Deja Vu." The Washington Post 
(8/24, 14.2M) asks in an editorial, "Shouldn't police by now be on notice to stop using 
unwarranted - and too often deadly - force against Black men and women?" To the Post, "there 
is a sickening deja vu...to watching the 20-second clip of video footage of Sunday's incident in" 
Kenosha, WI. The Post concludes that "neither noncompliance with a police order nor 
unconnected past crimes justifies a death sentence, and it is unacceptable to try to use those 
excuses. Enough is enough."
