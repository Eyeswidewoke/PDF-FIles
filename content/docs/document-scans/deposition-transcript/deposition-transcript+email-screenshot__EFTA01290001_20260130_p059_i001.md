M essages 
Although a money market mutual fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in a money market mutual 
fund. Shares of a money market mutual fund or the balance of a bank deposit product held in your brokerage account may be liquidated upon request with the proceeds 
credited to your brokerage account. Please see the money market mutual fund's prospectus or the bank deposit product's disclosure document or contact your advisor for 
additional information. Pursuant to SEC Rule 10 b-10( b)(1) confirmations are not sent for purchases into money market mutual funds processed on the sweep platform. 
The U.S. will adopt a shortened settlement timeframe beginning w ith trade date September 5.2017, for equities. corporate and municipal bonds. and unit investment trusts. M owing 
from a T + 3 to a T+2 settlement cycle will provide faster access to sale proceeds. but it also means that funds will be due on purchase transactions earlier. This may be a good time to 
consider e-delivery of your account documents-including trade confirmations. account statements and more. Ask your advisor or financial insititut ion about how you can set up 
e-delivery.
