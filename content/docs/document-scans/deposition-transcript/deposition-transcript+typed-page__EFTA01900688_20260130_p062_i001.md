the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution commands that no State shall "deny to any 
person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws." Const. Amend. XIV, § 1; Vacco 
v. Quill, 521 U.S. U.S. 793, 799 (1997)(citations omittedXholding that New York's prohibition 
on assisting suicide did not violate Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment). The 
Constitutional Protection under law is a common sense one. lesson of Equal This is "essentially a 
direction that all persons similarly situated should be treated alike." City of Cleburne, Texas v. 
Cleburne Living Center, 473 U.S. 432, 440 (1985)(citation omitted); Houston, 214 F.3d John 
Corp. v. City of 573, 577 (5th Cir. 2000Xcitation omittedX"The Equal Protection Clause 
protects individuals from governmental action that works differently."); to treat similarly situated 
individuals Stonebumer v. Secretary of the Army, 152 F.3d 485, 491 (5th Cir. 1998Xcitation 
omitted)("The Equal Protection Clause...essentially directs that all persons similarly situated be 
treated alike."). However, "if a law neither burdens a fundamental right nor targets a suspect 
class," the Supreme Court has observed, "the legislative classification [will survive] so long as it 
bears a rational relation to some legitimate end." Romer v. Evans, 517 U.S. 620, 631 
(1993Xciting Heller v. Doc, 509 U.S. 312, 319-20 (1993)); City of Cleburne, Texas v. Cleburne 
Living Ctr., 473 U.S. 24 432, 440 (1985X"The general rule is that legislation is presumed to be 
valid and will be sustained if the classification drawn by the statute is rationally related to a 
legitimate state interest.").17 When conducting the pivotal rational basis review, the U.S. 
Supreme Court has observed that "we will not overturn such [government action] unless the 
varying treatment of different groups or persons is so unrelated to the achievement of any 
combination of legitimate purposes that we can only conclude that the [government's] actions 
were irrational." !Gruel v. Florida Bd. of Regents, 528 U.S. 62, 84 (2000Xciting Vance v. 
Bradley, 440 U.S. 93, 97 (1979)). Where, as here, the challenged classification is presumptively 
rational, "the individual challenging its constitutionality bears the burden of proving that the 
'facts on which the classification is apparently based could not reasonably be conceived to be 
true by the governmental decisionmaker.'" Id. (citing Bradley, 440 U.S. at 111). To state at this 
juncture an Equal Protection violation, and thereby satisfy their burden of alleging a 
Constitutional violation sufficient to warrant § 1983 relief, the plaintiffs must allege 17 City of 
Cleburne, Texas v. Cleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, 439-40 (1985X"Section 5 of the 
Amendment empowers Congress to enforce this mandate, but absent controlling congressional 
direction, the courts have themselves devised standards for determining the validity of state 
legislation or other official action that is challenged as denying equal protection."). 25 that they 
have been purposefully treated differently from others similarly situated, and that there is no 
rational basis for the difference in treatment. Stonebumer, 152 F.3d at 490 (citations omitted). 
The plaintiffs contend that they have stated a violation of the Equal Protection Clause for the 
same reason that the plaintiffs in Doe I succeeded in their claim: they allege that, because they 
were convicted of Crime Against Nature by Solicitation before August 15, 2011, even though 
their conduct also fell within the scope of the statute prohibiting solicitation of Prostitution, they 
have, without any rational basis, been subjected to mandatory sex offender registration while 
identically situated individuals convicted under the solicitation provision of the Prostitution 
statute are not required to register as sex offenders. At this stage of the litigation, the Court 
must accept the plaintiffs' well-pleaded facts as true and in the light most favorable to the 
plaintiffs; because the test is simply whether the plaintiffs have stated a claim for relief that has 
facial plausibility, the Court finds that the plaintiffs' allegations are technically sufficient to 
withstand dismissal. The defendants contend that Act 402 substantively changed the law this 
Court declared unconstitutional in Doe I by providing a remedy in state court to those who
