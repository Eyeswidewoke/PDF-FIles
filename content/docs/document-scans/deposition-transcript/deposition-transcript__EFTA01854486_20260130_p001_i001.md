Title: Fw: Ides/Sept. 2I/NYC VIP screening/Moma 
This email to George Clooney gives you an idea how successful my Venice trip was. Stayed a week. Saw two films a day, 
went to 9:00am press screening, press conference, back to 8:00pm premiere, to cast dinner and ended up by the pool at 
Cipriani's with all the actors, producers and studio exec till 3:00am every night. Trip was OLYMPIC NETWORKING! 
Accomplished so much. 
Hung and discussed their work with George Clooney, Kate Winslet, Keira Knightly, Colin Firth, Al Pacino....on and on. 
We have working on all the hot films. 
Have to write my story now. Miss you. Want to see you when in NYC. xoxo Peggy

Grant: Leaving Venice now. Land Wednesday in NYC Wed. at 7:00pm 
VIP/Media Elite screening will be Thursday. 9121 at Moma at 7:30pm (because Brian Williams gets off Nightly News at 
7)...dinner/discussion at a restaurant..TBD. Time editor Rick Stengel, NBC Brian Williams, Nora Ephron, Lome Michaels 
all co-hosting. 
Waiting on Mike Nichols- he has his play in rehearsal and will not know for a bit. Will if can. Please try to come. 
Did you tell Sony (Andre Carareo) to tell us to take all political people off the guest list? 
Who at Sony (or are you/GC/Ill) deciding who gets invited? Just need to know who is controlling and we will follow. 
Andres in my office will send you my last list with political/media elite and the added 
filmmakers/actors/entertainment/cultural VIPs. 
Angela Galgani in New York Sony office told my office to take all political people off. At one point she thought Brian 
Williams was "political" and should not even host...then we explained he is clearly media/elite of no political party and a 
friend of GC's. So we have to clarify on some. Just checking on this. We know every name on list...and the first New York 
screening is important after the success of Venice. The film will play this the roof in Toronto. 
Loved seeing you and George in Venice. Do think "Ides", "Carnage", "Dangerous Method", "Shame" and "Tinker" are all 
strong contenders for the prizes in Italy. Of course, would love "Ides" and GS for director be recognized. 
Do think Michael Fassbinder is looking strong for Bost Actor for "Shame" and he is also in "Dangerous Method". All 
these films had strong press screenings and press conferences and you can get a feel in the room. 
As cool as it was to say one saw and liked "Shame" in Venice...do think it's going to get an NC-17 rating and marketing 
(as arty as it is) will be a challenge in USA. 
Think "Ides" will really resonate even more at home. 
You obviously can decide at the last minute if you come to Moma. We will keep you posted on rsvps. If you can't make it, 
I will introduce you to anyone on the list you want to meet at a later date. 
See you in Toronto. 
Heard "Ides"/GS is doing a party in Toronto. Who do I call to ask for a ticket?
