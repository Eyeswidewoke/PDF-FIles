replaced with the following 
"About Pay Over Time features 
We may add features to the Account that allow you to pay certain charges over time. 
If you enroll in the Extended Payment Option, we will automatically place all eligible charges into a Pay Over Time balance. 
A charge is eligible if it equals or is more than a certain dollar amount. We will tell you this amount when you enroll, and it 
is subject to change. We will tell you if we change it. Certain charges are not eligible, such as cash and similar 
transactions. 
We assign a Pay Over Time limit to your Account. We will not place any charge into a Pay Over Time balance if it causes 
the total of your Pay Over Time balances to go over your Pay Over Time limit. We may increase or decrease the Pay Over 
Time limit. We may do so even if you pay on time and your Account is not in default. We will tell you if we change that 
amount You must pay in full upon receipt of your billing statement all charges that are not placed into a Pay Over Time 
balance. We may change which charges are eligible to be placed into a Pay Over Time balance." 
Application of Payments 
Effective with billing periods starting on or after May 3, 2013. the "How we apply payments and credits" section contained in 
Part 2 of your Agreement is deleted and replaced with the following: 
"How we apply payments and credits 
If a statement includes a Pay Over Time balance, it will show a Minimum Payment Due. The Minimum Payment Due is the 
Pay In Full New Balance plus the Pay Over Time Minimum Due. 
If you have a Pay Over Time balance, we generally apply payments—up to the Minimum Payment Due—first to the Pay Over 
Time Minimum Due and then to the Pay In Full New Balance. When applying a payment to the Pay Over Time Minimum 
Due, we apply it first to the balance with the lowest interest rate and then to balances with higher interest rates. 
After the Minimum Payment Due has been paid, we apply payments to the remaining Pay Over Time balance. When we do 
this, we apply payments first to the balance with the highest interest rate and then to balances with lower interest rates. 
In most cases, we apply a credit to the same balance as the related charge. We may apply payments and credits within 
balances, and among balances with the same interest rate, in any order we choose."
