measures are out,' McConnell said. 'No matter what bills they were in at the start.'" McConnell's 
comments "came after Democrats accused Trump of self-dealing with his push on the FBI 
building, which sits across the street from a downtown hotel that Trump owns on Pennsylvania 
Avenue, blocks from the White House. The Trump International Hotel could face competition if 
the FBI moves from the site and another hotel is developed on the property." The Post adds, 
"Before running for office, Trump expressed interest in redeveloping the FBI property himself, 
and he has taken a strong personal interest in the effort to rebuild the headquarters." 
The New York Times (7/28, Rogers, Cochrane, 18.61M) reports that McConnell "looked 
startled on Monday when first asked why Republicans had agreed to a White House demand 
that $1.75 billion for a new F.B.I. building be tucked into their emergency coronavirus relief 
bill," and Sen. Richard Shelby (R-AL) "the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, framed 
the item as a Trump administration priority, not a Republican one. Other Republicans were more 
blunt. 'I don't know - that makes no sense to me' said Senator Lindsey Graham of South 
Carolina, a close ally of President Trump's. 'I'd be fine, OK, with stripping it out.'" The Times 
adds, "By Tuesday afternoon, another chapter in Mr. Trump's long, strange and, to his critics, 
ethically questionable odyssey to personally shape the future of the J. Edgar Hoover Building 
seemed headed to a close as Republicans distanced themselves from key elements of their own 
coronavirus relief bill." 
USA Today (7/28, King, Bailey, 10.31M) reports, "White House Chief of Staff Mark 
Meadows told reporters on Capitol Hill that a new headquarters is a 'pressing need.' While he 
defended its inclusion, Meadows said it won't be an obstacle to passage of another relief bill. 
'There are a number of things in the last bill that had nothing to do with the coronavirus,' he 
said. 'I think everybody acknowledges that it's a funding mechanism. And I don't see it 
standing in the way of us getting a deal." 
NBC News (7/28, Caldwell, 6.14M) reports, "A new FBI headquarters has been in the 
works for more than a decade and was slated to move from its current downtown location to a 
yet-to-be determined site in the Washington suburbs of Maryland or Virginia." The "plans to 
move the headquarters were abruptly scuttled but an Inspector General report that found that 
top officials at the General Services Administration, which oversaw the selection of the new 
headquarters, met with the president multiple times, misrepresented the cost of rebuilding on 
the current FBI site and misled Congress about the project. Critics say the president was 
concerned about an abandoned FBI building at the current location that could be transitioned 
into a commercial venture and provide competition for his hotel." 
CNN (7/28, Foran, Barrett, 83.16M) reports, "A number of Senate Republicans have 
expressed opposition to the provision and Republicans pushed administration officials Tuesday 
during their private lunch as to why the money was included in the bill, which members argued 
wasn't even related to coronavirus." 
The AP (7/28, Daly) reports, "Before running for office, Trump expressed interest in 
redeveloping the FBI property himself, and he has taken a strong personal interest in the effort 
to rebuild the headquarters. 'They don't have money for food stamps, but they have money for 
an FBI building just so that they can diminish competition for the president's hotel; House 
Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Monday night. 'More than 150,000 Americans have died from 
coronavirus, millions are unemployed ... and Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump are more 
concerned about protecting Trump Hotel. That is shameful,' said Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Va."
