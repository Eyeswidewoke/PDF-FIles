You should realize david lies about everything </=iv> 
First 
<=iv id="m_-5498418142335357171AppleMailSignature">l needed 800 k we had m=de a earlier budget months 
ago that showed - if we opened months ago -I co=ld have made it with 750k - david kept using this budget - I let it go 
=A0 
What david did not share =ith you is that because of such a late opening - I have given him an addit=onal budget 
-of a loss of 175k to get us to march - tmi - but opening so l=te gives you zero momentum into first 3 months of 2018 
This has still not ben addressed =A0 
Because david has told ev=ryone months ago we would have the needed funding - we where told to start=to 
ramp up - which increased payroll - I put the brakes on. From additiona= employees since zero funds have come in - we 
need another 20 +employees t= train and be ready to serve guests- a 3-4 week process 
Jeffrey- this is where david =ust lies 
So let's say funding does not happen for another 10 =eeks and I draw $20 k a week for needed payroll - so in 
theory I drew down=another 200k and now david thinks the restaurant only needs 400k - he is a=total idiot 
The restau=ant budget is based upon completion of construction and the ability to sea= both units- lobby and 
basement - yes the basement can drag for 2 weeks af=er the opening of the lobby restaurant 
I have not pulled my liquor license nor will l=till the restaurant account Is funded with 750k - I'm not going on 
the=hook to be responsible for shortfalls in that restaurant LLC as it's s=lely in my name - nor am I going to beg david for 
funds 
I have told him many times - = will not open with out proper funding 
Sorry for the story - but this is how it plays=out 
I will=send you shortly which items are actually due - work complete as most of t=at list are past due accounts
