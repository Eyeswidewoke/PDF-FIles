Sheriff Dart has told guard= and employees to videotape incidents so that he can show people what actually 
goes on here. Tom Dar=: And the videos we've shown people are to show them what happens when we take people 
who are mentally ill and we cram them into the criminal justice system where they're not supposed to be. And the 
irony's so deep that you have a society that finds it wrong to have people warehoused in a state mental institution, but 
those very same p=ople were OK if we warehouse 'em in a jail. 
Every day Elli M=ntgomery, one of five social workers at the jail, goes over the list of new inmates with mental 
illness. Elli Montgo=ery: We have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7...15. With a severe mental illness.=A0 Steve Kroft: Just this 
morning? Elli Montgomery: Yeah, just this morning. Severely mentally ill. Not like a little bit of depression.=A0 Most of 
them will be here for several days to several months, then released back on the street with a packet of pills and=no plan. 
Sheriff Dart says it's become a huge public safety issue. 
Steve Kroft: There's been an epidemic of mass shootings. A lot of them by people with serious mental health 
problems. Do you think =here's a connection? Tom Dart: Yes, I do think there are connections here because people --
some are getting treated. Other ones aren't getting treated. People are falli=g through the cracks all the time. And so to 
think that that won't then boil up at some point and end up in a tragedy, that's just naive.=A0 That's just naive. Dr. 
Torrey: We have a grand experiment: what happens when you don't treat people. But then you're going to have to 
accept 10 percent of homicides being killed by untreated, mentally ill people. You're going to have to accept Tucson and 
Aurora. You're going to have to accept Cho at Virginia Tech. These are the consequences, when we allow people who 
need to be treated to go untreated. And, if you are willing to do that, then that's fine. But l&=39;m not willing to do that. 
One in five Americans experienced some sort=of mental illness in 2010, according to a new report from the 
Substance Abuse and Men=al Health Services Administration. About 5 percent of Americans have suffered =rom such 
severe mental illness that it interfered with day-to-day school, work =r family. Women were more likely to be diagnosed 
with mental illness than men (23 percent of women versus 16.9 per=ent of men), and the rate of mental illness was 
more than twice as likely in yo=ng adults (18 to 25) than people older than 50. 
About 11.4 million=adult Americans suffered from severe mental illness in the past year and 8.7 million adults 
contemplated serious thoughts of suicide. Among them, more than 2 million made suicide plans and about 1 million 
attempted suicide. =Nearly 2 million teens, or 8 percent of the adolescent population, experienced a major depressive 
episode in the past y=ar. The research defined a major episode as at least a two-week period when a person is 
depressed with a loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities= while also experiencing at least four of seven symptoms 
defined in the four=h edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. 
Only about 60 percent of people with mental illness get treatment each year, according to the report, and 
whites and Native America=s were more likely to seek help than African-Americans, Latinos and Asians.=A0 Researchers 
drew the findings from nearly 70,000 surveys on mental health and addiction among children and adults. 
"Mental illnesses can be managed successfully, and people do recover," Pamela S. Hyde, head of Substance 
Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, said in a news release. "Mental illness is not an isolated public health 
problem. Cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity often co-exist with mental illness and treatment of the mental 
illness can reduce the effects of these disorders. The Obama Administration is working to promote the use of mental 
health services through health reform. People, families and communities wil= benefit from increased access to mental 
health services." 
Des=a Bergen-Cico, assistant professor of public health, food studies and nutrition at Syracuse University in New 
York, said there a=e several aspects of mental health treatment that should be improved in this country, including better 
access to preventive mental health care, which sh=uld include coverage for evidence-based prevention, intervention 
programs and counseling. An example of such a program is the Mindfulness-Based Stress Re=uction (MBSR), an eight-
week secular mindfulness and meditation training program t=at teaches and prepares people to develop lifelong skills 
for dealing with anxiety, stress depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and chronic illn=ss.
