KENNETH STARR, ESQ. 
NOVEMBER 30, 2007 
PAGE 3 OF 6 
Mr. Epstein's counsel, still dissatisfied with the Office's review of the case, demanded to 
meet with me and to have the opportunity to meet with someone in Washington, D.C. To 
accommodate Mr. Black, the meeting was put off until September 7, 2007, despite the fact that the 
indictment was ready for presentation to the grand jury. In the interim AUSA 
investigators met with the Chief of the Child Exploitation Section, 
again, the evidence and legal theories of prosecution. Chief 
strongly supported the 
indictment and even offered to join the trial team and provide additional support from his Section. 
and the 
to review, yet 
On Se tember 7 2007, I met with irc .Leflcowitz and Ms. Sanchez, along with Chief 
and AUSAs 
and 
2 You and other counsel for Mr. 
Epstein again presented arguments regarding the sufficiency of the federal interest in the case and 
other legal and factual issues. Your arguments were discussed afterwards and the unanimous 
opinion of all of the attorneys present was in favor of prosecution. 
During the September t h meeting, your co-counsel, Mr. Lefkowitz, also offered a plea 
resolution. His offer, in essence, was that your client be subject to home confinement at his Palm 
Beach home, using private security officers who would serve as "wardens," if necessary. Mr. 
Lefkowitz expressed the belief that such a sentence would be particularly appropriate because, as 
a wealthy white man, your client may be the subject of violence or extortion while in prison. 
Finally, both you and your co-counsel expressed the belief that Mr. Epstein's extensive charitable 
giving should be considered in our prosecution decision. I summarily rejected these proposals, and 
indicated that the twenty-four month offer presented previously by this Office stood. I should add 
that there were four other prosecutors present at the meeting, representing a combined experience 
of more than fifty years. Never had any of them heard, or heard of, an attorney making a similar 
argument, and especially not in a child exploitation case. 
The issue of the inclusion of a restitution-type remedy for the victims pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 
2255 was specifically raised and discussed at the September 7th meeting, and you thanked AUSA 
for bringing it to your attention as a novel approach to allowing the victims to receive 
essentially federal restitution while allowing a plea to a state charge. 
After considering eve thing said and written by Mr. Epstein's legal defense team, and after 
conferring with Chief 
, I informed you that we still intended to proceed to indictment. 
Since counsel had indicated a desire to appeal the matter to the Attorney General, the Deputy 
Attorney General, or the Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division, I agreed to delay the 
presentation of the indictment for two weeks to allow you to speak with someone in Washington, 
D.C., if you so chose. 
21 note that this meeting had been delayed several weeks to allow for Mr. Black's 
participation, yet he was not present.
