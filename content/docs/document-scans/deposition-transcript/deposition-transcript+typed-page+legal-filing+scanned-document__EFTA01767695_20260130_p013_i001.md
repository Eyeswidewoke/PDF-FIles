Zamir's analysts found it satisfying that PLO activists in Europe and at their headquarters in Beirut, Lebanon—
rather than devoting their energies to terrorist planning—were now looking over their shoulders, out of fear that they 
themselves were about to be attacked. 
The truth, however, about the myth is that since the Mossad's creation in the early 1950s, it has been involved 
in only a few dozen killing operations—certainly fewer than 50. But the public imagination worldwide has been captured 
by the notion of constant assassinations, and the Mossad might find it difficult to refute the image with facts. So it does 
not bother. 
Dagan clearly believed in assassinations, and he did not shy away from planning missions in the heart of enemy 
countries. A Kidon squad managed to plant itself in Damascus, Syria, long enough to locate and kill Imad Mughniyeh in 
February of 2008. Mughniyeh, the Hezbollah faction's military chief and a veteran hijacker and bomber, had long been 
on America's list of most wanted terrorists. 
Overall, Dagan could be proud that during his eight years in charge, there were more killings by the Mossad in 
enemy or "target" countries—Lebanon, Syria, Iran, and the United Arab Emirates—than ever before. In the past, such 
activities had mostly been confined to the safer "base" countries where Israelis did not necessarily have to pretend to be 
something else. The change to a bolder pattern was the "dagger between the Mossad's teeth" that Ariel Sharon, the 
prime minister who appointed pagan, had demanded. 
Despite tactical successes in Iran, the Mossad and its top political master—Prime Minister Benjamin 
Netanyahu—know that the entire Iranian nuclear weapons program will not be demolished by assassinations of nuclear 
scientists and military officers. 
Yet, any delay in Iran's nuclear work represents an achievement for Israel. Their strategic thinking—exercised in 
Egypt, Syria, Iraq, and elsewhere—holds that temporary disruptions to an enemy's dangerous projects are sufficient 
cause for taking significant risks. 
This was even truer when it came to killing Iranian specialists, who worked on unique tasks that required years 
of study. These men were not available in abundant supply, despite Iran's relatively large and advanced technological 
infrastructure. The assassinations have also had a strong psychological objective: sending a loud and clear message to 
scientists that working for the nuclear program was dangerous. The Mossad was telling them, in effect: Stay in your 
classrooms. Do your academic work. Get your research published. Enjoy the university life. But do not help Iran go 
nuclear. Otherwise, your career could be cut short by a bullet or a bomb. 
Indeed, Israeli intelligence noticed that the assassination campaign was paying off, with what it called "white 
defections": Iranian scientists were scared, many contemplated leaving the program, and some actually did. 
With rare exceptions, they did not depart Iran and defect to the Western or Israeli side, but they dissociated 
themselves from the nuclear program. There were also indications of scientists being reluctant to join the program, 
despite lucrative terms offered by the Iranian government. 
The intimidation campaign definitely showed an impact on foreigners. While in the past, Chinese, Russians, 
Pakistanis and others were happily accepting invitations—and high pay—to work in Iran, the only ones who still seemed 
attracted were North Koreans. 
Mossad chief Dagan was pleased by the missions in Iran and the "cleanliness" of their execution: no clues, no 
fingerprints, not even motorcycles left behind. Iranian authorities could only guess who was attacking, in broad daylight, 
in their capital. 
Yet the deeply intimidating impact that Dagan aimed to create in Iran seems to be exhausted. This is apparent to 
Tamir Pardo, the new head of the Mossad who had been Dagan's deputy. (Dagan actually advised Netanbyahu to
