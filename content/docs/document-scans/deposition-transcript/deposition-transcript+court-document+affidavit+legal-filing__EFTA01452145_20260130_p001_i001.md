determined by the General Partner following a request by an ERISA Partner and 
consultation between such ERISA Partner and the General Partner, (vi) as may be 
required in connection with an audit by any taxing authority, (vi:) to its investors, limited 
partners or shareholders, but only to the extent required under its limited partnership 
agreement, shareholders' agreement or other operative documents or in accordance with 
its ordinary commercial practice and only with respect to the identity of the Fund and the 
identity of Portfolio Investments, the amounts of and reasons for Drawdowns and 
Distributable Cash and changes in the Value of Portfolio Investments (including a brief 
explanation of such changes) and (vii:) to its investors, bona fide prospective investors, 
limited partners or shareholders as the General Partner shall either have generally agreed 
may be provided or shall, in any specific instance, have agreed may be so provided, 
provided that, in respect of the disclosure described in clauses (ii) — (iv), such Limited 
Partner shall notify, to the extent permitted by law, the General Partner prior to such 
disclosure. The foregoing shall not limit the disclosure of the tax treatment or tax 
structure of the Fund (or any transactions undertaken by the Fund). As used in this 
Section 13.10, the term "tax treatment" refers to the purported or claimed U.S. federal 
income tax treatment and the term "tax structure" refers to any fact that may be relevant 
to understanding the purported or claimed U.S. federal income tax treatment, provided 
that, for the avoidance of doubt, (A) except to the extent otherwise established in 
published guidance by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, tax treatment and tax structure 
shall not include the name of or contact information for, or any other similar identifying 
information regarding the Fund, any Related Investment Fund or any of their investments 
(including the names of any employees or affiliates thereof) and (B) nothing in this 
Section 13.10 shall limit the ability of a Limited Partner to make any disclosure to such 
Limited Partner's tax advisors or to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. In the event that a 
Limited Partner (or anyone to whom such Limited Partner has transmitted such 
information) becomes legally required (or reasonably determines that it is legally 
required) to disclose any such information, such Limited Partner shall promptly notify the 
General Partner in writing of such requirement prior to any such disclosure so that the 
General Partner, the Manager and/or the Fund may seek a protective order or other 
appropriate remedy. In the event that such protective order or other remedy is not 
obtained, or that the General Partner waives compliance with the provisions of this 
Section 13.10, such Limited Partner may disclose such information as it is legally 
required to disclose (or that it reasonably determines it is legally required to disclose), 
and such Limited Partner agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain assurance that 
confidential treatment will be accorded the information so disclosed. Notwithstanding 
any other provision of this Agreement, the General Partner or Manager shall have the 
right to keep confidential from Limited Partners for such period of time as the General 
Partner or Manager determines is reasonable (x) any information that the General Partner 
or Manager reasonably believes to be in the nature of trade secrets and (y) any other 
information (I) the disclosure of which the General Partner or Manager believes is not in 
the best interest of the Fund or any Related Investment Fund or could damage the Fund or 
its investments or (2) that the Fund, or any Related Investment Fund, the General Partner,
