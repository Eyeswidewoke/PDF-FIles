We cannot keep returning again and again with emergen=y aid. Millions of Afghan refugees have been in exile for more 
than three decades. The enormous sums spent on security, development and humanitarian aid in Afghanistan have so 
far given no hope to the grandchildren born to those wh= fled in the 1970s and 80s and who are still living in camps. In 
Gaza,=schools will have to be rebuilt for the third time after the third war in six years. This failure of loca=, regional and 
international political and diplomatic work costs too much suffering and to= many resources. Aid workers say that we 
must break the vicious cycle. The average refugee crisis lasts more than a decade and that few refugees find = durable 
solution. We need to find ways to meet today's emergency needs and build hope of a better future for r=fugee youth. 
Otherwise, they may determine that their only way out is to join the ranks of the extremists. And w= will continue to set 
new horrific records. 
We have to stop allowing our electi=e representatives to mislead and as President Obama would describe, "say stupid 
thing=" whichever political party or for whatever reason. Case in point is Rep. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), above in a campaign 
ad for his race for the Senate — =E2414>When President Obama hijacked the farm bill, turned it into a food stamp bill, 
with billions more in spending, I voted no. Career politicians =ove attaching bad ideas to good ones. Then the bad ideas 
become law—and you pay for it." Cot=on, who is in a tight race against incumbent Sen. Mark Pryor (0), has come under 
fire in the state for being t=e only Arkansas lawmaker, Republican or Democrat, to vote against the final version of farm 
bill. So he explained his vote as a matter of principle, blaming President Obama for "=ijacking" it and turning it "into a 
food stamp bill= with billions more in spending."

First of all, it is a bit of risky gambit, Cotton Q=804k who has served one term in the House after a military career —
seems to als= be labeling even his fellow GOP legislators as "career politicians." Cotton office's explanation offered by 
Cotton spokesman David Ray: The House of Representat=ves passed two bills — a farm-only farm bill and a food stamp-
only bill= both of which Cotton supported. But then he said that Obama threatened to veto the food stamp bill unless it 
was .=9Cloaded up with food stamps." Not only that, but Ray said that the level of food stamps has exploded under 
Obama.<=span> 
Except that there is just one problem with this story. Food stamps=(now formally called Supplemental Nutrition 
Assistance Program, or SNAP) have been part of the farm bill for decades. It is a perfect marriage of convenience 
between urban lawmakers (who cared about the food stamps) and r=ral lawmakers (who cared about the farm bill), who 
working together could ensur= that the benefits important to their constituents were regularly enacted in=o law. The 
practice actually dates back to the Great Depression, when the first farm bill was passed and surplus crops=and other 
food products were distributed to people who needed assistance. In th= current era, food stamps has been paired with 
every farm bill since 1973, according to the Congressional Research Service.
