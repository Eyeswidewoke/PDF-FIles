defendant's §2422(b) attempt conviction was valid; it mattered not that the 14 year old 
was really an adult FBI agent engaged in a sting operation, for the defendant "believed 
Cindy to be a minor and acted on that belief." 251 EM at 512. Our own survey of the 
cases brought in this district under §2422(b) confirms that prosecutions in this District 
have also been all but limited to internet sting cases. See Tab "B". 
In the context of this standard fact pattern involving the Internet's use by 
predators, other Circuits, including the Eleventh, have been unanimous in holding that the 
non-existence of an actual minor was of no moment; defendant's belief that he was 
dealing with a minor was sufficient to make out the crime. See United States v. Root, 296 
F.3d 1222, 122742 (11"' Cir. 2002); United States v. Sims, 428 F.3d 945, 959 (10* Cir. 
2005); United States v. Helder, 452 F.3d 751 (8* Cir. 2006); United States v. Meek, 366 
F.3d 705, 717-20 (9'h Cir. 2004). Likewise, the Circuits have rejected void for vagueness, 
overbreadth, and First Amendment challenges to the statute, brought in the context of 
these prototypical prosecutions where the internet was the vehicle of communication and 
enticement, and the defendant demonstrated in writing his belief that he was dealing with 
a child well below the age of consent. Eg., United States v. 7)1karsky, 446 F.3d 458, 473 
(3d Cir. 2006); United States v. Thomas, 410 F.3d 1235, 1243-44 (1 0th Cir. 2005); United 
States v. Panfil, supra, 338 F.3d at 1300-01 (11th Cir. 2003)." 
" There are approximately two dozen Eleventh Circuit cases that include a prosecution under 
§2422(b), most of which involve the prototypical fact pattern. See, e.g., United States v. Morton, 
364 F.3d 1300 (I Is Cir. 2004),judgment vacated for Booker consideration, 125 S. Ct. 1338 
(2006); United States v. Orrega, 363 F.3d 1093 (11th Cir. 2004); United States v. Miranda, 348 
F.3d 1322 (I 1* Cir. 2003); United States v. Tillmon, 195 F.3d 640 (I I* Cir. 1999); United States v. 
Poe!, supra, 338 F.3d 1299 (11* Cir. 2003); United States v. Garrett, 190 F.3d 1220 (11° Cir. 
1999); United States v. Burgess, 175 F.3d 1261 (II* Cir. 1999); United States v. Rojas, 145 Fed. 
Appx. 647 (I I° Cir. 2005); United States v. Root, 296 F.3d 1222 (11* Cir. 2002). 
United States v. Murrell, 368 F.3d 1283 (11* Cir. 2004), is in the same mold, except that, in that 
sting operation, the defendant communicated, not with the purported 13 year old girl, but with an 
undercover agent holding himself out to be the imaginary girl's father. The initial contacts 
between Murrell and the agent occurred in internet chatrooms named "family love" and "Rent F 
Vry Yng." Over time, Murrell sought to make arrangements with the girl's father to make his 
daughter available for sex in exchange for money. After the initial internet communications 
concerning renting the girl for sexual purposes, further negotiations between the defendant and 
the undercover occurred via the phone, per the defendant's suggestion. The Eleventh Circuit, 
framing the issue to be whether the defendant must communicate directly with the minor or 
supposed minor to violate §2422(b), answered the question in the negative, reasoning that "the
