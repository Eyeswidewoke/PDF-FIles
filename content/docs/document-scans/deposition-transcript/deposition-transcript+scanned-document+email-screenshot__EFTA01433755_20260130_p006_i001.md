false" and "politically motivated," Garten told Law Newz: "I 
don't know of any attorney — in this country worthy of being admitted by any 
bar — who would sign legal papers — attesting to such 
outrageous facts." 
The National Review (June 21) also minimizes the prospects for Jane Doe's 
case, saying falsely that it is "without any sort of supporting 
evidence." National Review omits, or suppresses, the eyewitness affidavit 
that confirms Jane Doe's claims and is part of the June 20 filing. 
Able to exonerate Trump by denying evidence that exists, National Review's 
defense is also circumstantially weak: 
As a thrice-married admitted adulterer, Trump's history doesn't inspire a 
lot of confidence in this area, from bragging about bedding 
married women to his comments to Howard Stern about watching Paris Hilton's 
sex tape to his weird habit of commenting on the sex 
appeal of his own daughter to embracing convicted rapist Mike Tyson to 
defending Bill Clinton himself in his sex scandals in the 1990s, 
just to pick a few examples. 
"Why the New Child Rape Case Filed Against Donald Trump Should Not Be 
Ignored" was the headline on attorney and NBC News analyst 
Lisa Bloom's piece at the Huffington Post (June 29). Bloom wrote: "The 
mainstream media ignored the [June 20] filing. If the Bill Cosby 
case has taught us anything, it is to not disregard rape cases against 
famous men. Serious journalists have publicly apologized for turning 
a blind eye to the Cosby accusers for over a decade..." 
Bloom outlined three factors that justify a closer examination of Trump's 
behavior. First there is his ongoing disrespect for women 
including Rosie O'Donnell, Arianna Huffington, Bette Midler, and Megyn 
Kelly. "Decades of abusive language does not make him a rapist. 
But it does show us who the man is: a callous, meanspirited misogynist who 
no sane person would leave alone with her daughter," Bloom 
wrote. A second factor that adds credibility to Jane Doe's claim is the 
pattern suggested by Trump's behavior with his ex-wife Ivana and 
his dealings with Jill Harth (both discussed above). Bloom reinforced 
Harth's credibility: 
Recently Donald Trump issued a statement that women's claims of sexual 
harassment, documented in a lengthy New York 
Times investigation (May 15) which included Ms. Harth's lawsuit, were "made 
up." Jill Harth responded angrily on Twitter last week: "My 
part was true. I didn't talk. As usual you opened your big mouth." In other 
words, she is standing by her story. 
The third factor adding credibility to the allegations against Trump, Bloom 
argued, was the internal consistency of Jane Doe's complaint as 
well as its correspondence to verifiable facts outside the case. After 
analyzing Jane Doe's complaint, her affidavit, and her witness affidavit 
— "it is exceedingly rare for a sexual assault victim to have a witness" —
Bloom concluded: 
... based on the record thus far, Jane Doe's claims appear credible. Mr. 
Epstein's own sexual crimes and parties with underage girls are 
well documented, as is Mr. Trump's relationship with him two decades ago in 
New York City.... Powerfully, Jane Doe appears to have 
an eyewitnessto all aspects of her claim, a witness who appears to have put
