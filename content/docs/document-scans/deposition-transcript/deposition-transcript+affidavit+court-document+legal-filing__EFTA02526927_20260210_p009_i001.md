There are s=me other reasons why it looks simple to me, and I think it would be helpful to make them clear and 
open. 
Throughout =his whole business, thoughts have been coming to my mind that I'm sure must have occurred to 
you too. Namely my own experiences. 
When my mot=er died, in 1972, my father was 78 years old, not a good time to be alone. Knew that well 
enough then, but it came home like a hammer blow when Mommoy was diagnosed in 2006 with incurable brain and 
lung cancer, and I was priva=ely told by her physician that she had at most months to live -- never told her of course. I 
couldn't help realizing that if I had died befor= her, and she was alone, she would have had to be put in some facility 
where she would suffer and die soon in misery. Since I was there, I could take care of her at home and to the great 
surprise of her doctors, she had two years that were tolerable and sometimes very enjoyable even as she wasted away 
and reverted to infancy, and was able to pass away in peace, at home.<=font> 
i didn'= think of all of that when my mother died, but I did understand enough to realize -- we all did -- that my 
father was facing a very difficult and dangerous period. 
We were the=efore all delighted when, a year later, he met and married Ruth. They spent the rest of his life 
together, happy and secure, and he too was able to pass away at home, in peace, his wife taking care of him and his 
children and Judy nearby. 
We were, of=course, very grateful that he had found Ruth, and very grateful to her. David and I owned the 
house, but of course we just gave it to her for the rest of her life, and for whatever she wanted to do with it. 
There was n=ver a question, a problem, a concern. All entirely natural within a family, very simple. 
Like other =ases I know of.

Received your letter, and will go through it carefully= But even on a quick reading there are things that surprise 
me. To mention just one example, I would be interested in knowing where you receiv=d the information about the sale 
of the apartment in Cambridge and the purcha=e of the house in Tucson. 
To clarify, Deborah is not Valeria's lawyer, she&#=9;s mine and Valeria's lawyer. Max recognized that he had a 
conflict of in=erests, and recommended to me that I should have a different lawyer, so we arranged for Deborah and her 
firm to represent both of us. 
I can see that there are many other important things t= discuss and clarify.
