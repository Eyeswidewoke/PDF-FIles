Denon and Marantz are very similar companies, they indeed fall over the same corporation, D&M Holdings. 
Marantz has a tendency to not be as feature rich as Denon, but what features they do offer are more refined and, I find, 
work and sound better. Since we will not be using the built-in amplification in the AVR-4311CI, I would like to mention 
the Marantz AV7005 
<http://us.marantz.com/us/Products/Pages/ProductDetails.aspx?CatIchAVSeparates&ProductIchAV7005> . This is a 
dedicated pre-amp, and has similar capabilities (e.g. AirPlay) to the 4311, but without the baggage of the amplifiers. As a 
pre-amp it also has better connections for use with your existing Amplifier.

The projector you have, a Sony Qualia, is something very special, and I have a great respect for that whole line of 
A/V components. However, I feel that I should mention some important things that you may be missing out on without 
a new projector. Of course the brand new thing is 3D and that is not a possibility. Other things that are different include 
the ability to take in a full 1080p image. I am not sure about what capabilities your projector gained with the HDMI 
upgrade, but most everything at the time was unable to take in 1080p natively, but converted a 1080i signal internally. 
This is not a major problem on a 42" Plasma, but it is the type of problem that really stands out at 112 inches.

I totally agree with the AppleTV addition, it is a very cool little device. I would, however, recommend a different 
Blu-ray player. We carry some very nice models from Denon and Pioneer which would work better with the rest of your 
system. These players do not always offer the most recent updates, or load as quickly as their rivals but they give a 
custom installer many more options which will end with you having a better picture. One example I discussed with Scott 
is the variable resolution output on a Pioneer. With several higher end video processors in the mix I would rather have 
the video conversion done anywhere but in the BD player. This is just one example of the type of thing we can 
accomplish with a product more designed for your type of system. Samsung, as a mass market brand, does not focus on 
this type of feature.

One final thing to discuss is the control system. Primarily, in Manhattan, we work with Control 4 and Universal 
Remote Control. We do have people that can work with Crestron in the company if you would like your existing system 
updated, but I would recommend against it. I think Control 4 would be the best option for your system. The reason for 
this is that it can take over your Shade controls, and your lighting along with your home theater. Another great aspect of 
the system is the on screen display. Where most remotes have a small screen for control the Control4 system will 
appear on the projector screen and allow navigation without the need to look down at the controller. This is a very cool 
feature, particularly with such a large screen.

Thank you for taking the time to read this message, and for considering us for your job. I look forward to hearing 
your thoughts.

> I can give you some general guidance as to pricing, for instance: 
> A Control4 system starts at $1100, installed. The pricing changes as we add control of more options, as we need to add 
hardware and labor. I need to have my system designers work on that, and probably also come back and go behind the 
equipment to dig around and get you exact pricing. 
> Also, and I mention this in passing below, I need to know quite a bit more about the projector lift. I want to be sure 
that we do not need to order anything to make the projector fit, and also ensure that we can control it with the C4 
system.
