(iv) 
Right to Terminate. 
(I) 
If:—
(A) 
a transfer under Section 6(bXii) or an agreement under Section 6(bXiii), as the 
case may be. has not been effected with respect to all Affected Transactions within 30 days 
after an Affected Party gives notice under Section 6(b)(i): or 
(B) 
a Credit Event Upon Merger or an Additional Termination Event occurs. or a Tax 
Event Upon Merger occurs and the Burdened Party is not the Affected Party, 
the Burdened Party in the case of a Tax Event Upon Merger, any Affected Party in the case of a 
Tax Event or an Additional Termination Event if there are two Affected Patties, or the Non-
affected Party in the case of a Credit Event Upon Merger or an Additional Termination Event if 
there is only one Affected Party may, if the relevant Termination Event is then continuing, by not 
more than 20 days notice to the other party, designate a day not earlier than the day such notice is 
effective as an Early Termination Date in respect of all Affected Transactions. 
(2) 
If at any time an Illegality or a Force Majeure Event has occurred and is then continuing 
and any applicable Waiting Period has expired:—
(A) 
Subject to clause (B) below, either party may, by not more than 20 days notice to 
the other party, designate (I) a day not earlier than the day on which such notice becomes 
effective as an Early Termination Date in respect of all Affected Transactions or (II) by 
specifying in that notice the Affected Transactions in respect of which it is designating the 
relevant day as an Early Termination Date, a day not earlier than two Local Business Days 
following the day on which such notice becomes effective as an Early Termination Date in 
respect of less than all Affected Transactions. Upon receipt of a notice designating an 
Early Termination Date in respect of less than all Affected Transactions, the other party 
may, by notice to the designating party. if such notice is effective on or before the day so 
designated, designate that same day as an Early Termination Date in respect of any or all 
other Affected Transactions. 
(B) 
An Affected Party (if the Illegality or Force Majeure Event relates to performance 
by such party or any Credit Support Provider of such party of an obligation to make any 
payment or delivery under, or to compliance with any other material provision of, the 
relevant Credit Support Document) will only have the right to designate an Early 
Termination Date under Section 6(bXivX2)(A) as a result of an Illegality under 
Section 5(bXi)(2) or a Force Majeure Event under Section 5(bXiiX2) following the prior 
designation by the other patty of an Early Termination Date, pursuant to 
Section 6(bXivX2XA), in respect of less than all Affected Transactions. 
(c) 
Effect of Designation. 
(i) 
If notice designating an Early Termination Date is given under Section 6(a) or 6(b), the Early 
Termination Date will occur on the date so designated, whether or not the relevant Event of Default or 
Termination Event is then continuing. 
(ii) 
Upon the occurrence or effective designation of an Early Termination Date, no further payments or 
deliveries under Section 2(aXi) or 9(1)(1) in respect of the Terminated Transactions will be required to be 
made, but without prejudice to the other provisions of this Agreement. The amount, if any. payable in 
respect of an Early Termination Date will be determined pursuant to Sections 6(e) and 9(hXii).
