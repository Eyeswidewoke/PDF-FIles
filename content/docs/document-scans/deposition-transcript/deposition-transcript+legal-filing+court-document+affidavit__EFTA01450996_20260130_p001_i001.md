GEM Equity Strategy 
11 December 2013 
Outlook 2014 
Strategy Update 
John-Paul Smith 
Negative year in prospect but 
underperformance should slow 
C;Etvl equities cheapness at aggregate level is misleading 
We would largely discount the apparent cheapness of GEM equity markets for 
3 reasons - 1) Much of the value resides in the financial sector where investors 
are rightly sceptical about the declared level of NPLs, especially in the BRIC 
markets; 2) There is no sign of a reversal in the degradation of margins of GEM 
non-financial companies relative to their DM counterparts; if anything, the 
negative drivers are becoming more pronounced in EM; 3) The polarisation 
between overvalued sectors on the back of good governance (Healthcare, 
Consumer Staples) and their badly governed peers (Energy, Financials) remains 
at extreme levels, highlighting the difficulty facing EM investors. 
Investors should focus on the relationship between state and corporate sector, 
not on short term fund flows as the key driver of EM economies and equities 
Investors have become overly focused on the potential impact of short term 
fund flows over recent years. We believe that their time would be better spent 
analysing the underlying dynamics of corporate level governance, in particular 
the relationship between the corporate sector and the state which has been 
the most important driver of emerging equity markets since the financial crisis. 
By our reckoning, the relationship is most dysfunctional in the BRIC markets, 
particularly China, where we can envisage the potential for a debt trap in the 
industrials/materials sectors, which could eventually trigger an economy-wide 
financial crisis. By contrast, we believe that the impact of any potential 
tapering of QE is largely priced in to most of those markets whose economies 
are running sizeable current account deficits, with the partial exception of 
Brazil. 
Breakout horn low dispersion and volatility more likely on downside in 2014 
It might not have always felt like it, but the volatility and dispersion of EM 
equities continued to fall in 2013 which resulted in another year of poor 
performance for momentum-based strategies. The immediate outlook is for 
more range bound trading as liquidity and fundamental drivers remain finely 
balanced, so a contrarian strategy should continue to pay off. It is even 
possible that emerging equities will begin the year strongly as fears concerning 
the impact of tapering recede. Nevertheless we believe that the year will be 
defined by increasingly negative sentiment towards the ability of the 
authorities in Beijing to manage a soft landing for the Chinese economy. There 
will eventually be beneficiaries within GEM from lower commodity prices but 
the initial impact will be to raise risk premiums and redemptions across GEM. 
Absolute returns likely to be negative with (lower) underperformance vs DM 
We would tentatively forecast a negative return of around 10% for MSCI EMF 
in 2014, but with a greater degree of volatility and dispersion between 
constituents. The relative call is harder following massive underperformance in 
2014, which has left DM valuations expensive, but economic and governance 
drivers indicate further potential underperforrnance from GEM of around 10%. 
Within EM, we continue to advocate overweight positions in markets with 
lower exposure to China, beneficiaries of lower commodity prices and 
improving sovereign and/or corporate governance characteristics.
