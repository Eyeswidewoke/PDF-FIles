However, given y=ur assumptions, we should definitely have ironclad agreements, with batter=es of lawyers an notaries 
and witnesses, including an agreement that you w=ll not contest my will, something that had never crossed my mind 
before I =earned about your assumptions -- which, I admit, I'm still having trou=le comprehending. 
It might be possible to work out all of these proble=s and develop a legal, specific and complete agreement 
based on the framew=rk you've proposed. Would you like to engage with me in some kin= of process to attempt that? 
Other than having your lawyer talk to m=ne, do you have any suggestion about how to do so?

Very simple. Proceed as above

I'm glad that you find the idea interesting and think that you migh= consider it, though you have to consult

My =wn view is different. To me the proposal I suggested seems to be a v=ry simple way of settling this matter, 
which to me is extremely troubling.=C2* I realize that this is just another case of a longstanding differenc= in the way 
we approach these problems, a difference that has been clear e=er since we were discussing the interest on the loan 
from the Trust and fo=nd that we could not communicate because I mistakenly assumed that it was = discussion among 
family members while your letters made it very clear and=explicit that you saw it as a legal issue to be settled among 
lawyers and =ainco, perhaps with a mediator in the adversary proceeding. All matt=rs I find it very hard to comprehend, 
and to live with, but so be it. 
So by all means consult with your lawyer, or perhaps a battery o= lawyers, to make sure that your interests are 
properly protected. l=don't need any lawyer's advice. The matter is perfectly clea= and straightforward. So there is no 
reason for me to hire a lawyer =o deal with the question and to have a lawyer contact yours and initiate a=discussion in 
which we all participate. 
The matter is very =imple. We can proceed without delay if you agree to settle the issue=in the simple manner 
that I suggested. 
As for your proposal= in your letter of March 29, as I wrote you, the letter was so shocking th=t it was hard for 
me to bring myself to respond, but I did, in detail, but=decided not to send it. Perhaps I should. Will think about 
it.=/div> 
As for your proposals, my response was the obvious one..>=A0 I'm sorry for the stress you had to endure, but 
your efforts were a=waste of time for reasons I had already fully explained before you underto=k them. As I'm sure you 
recall, a few years ago, I requested tax=payments from the marital trust when my IRA was being rapidly depleted by =y 
advisers who were distributing half to family and using the other half t= pay management fees and taxes for the entire 
estate, so that to pay Alex&=39;s medical expenses and the expenses for Wellfleet I had to withdraw exc=ss funds with 
exorbitant taxes, all that before withdrawing even a cent to=live on again with exorbitant taxes. Your response was to 
refuse the=request unless I agreed to intrusive and insulting financial investigation= -- of a kind I never considered when
