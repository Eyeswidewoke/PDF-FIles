babysitting and after 2 pai= trial days ( 250 euros per day ) shooting for Vogue and Dior, I've go= hired by one of the best 
fashion photographers called Paolo Roversi to be=his assistant ( paid job ). I'm very happy and excited to work and lea=n 
from him which is better than any photography school. I'm ready to w=rk as long as I need to in order to build my skills 
and stand out in that =ield. I think I've achieved some results and gained some value if I co=pare myself 2 years ago from 
now. Thanks to you I had the possibility to m=ke many interesting experiences like Ferragamo in China and Alaia in =aris. 
Even though I didn't get hired from them, those experiences allo=ed me to understand what I like and what I don't like 
and shaped in pa=t the person I am. Thanks to the Alaia internship and my passion for =hotography I am now working 
with Paolo Roversi doing what I really like. H=wever even though I work hard and I am paid I cannot fully support myself 
=o pay a rent and my living in Paris. I really would like to continue throu=h this path, I feel it's the right one but I need 
your help, your supp=rt and your advices because I cannot make it by myself. 
I =romise I will use my money wisely without throwing it away into futilities=like 
parties and holidays because I want to grow and build my skills, my c=rrier and hopefully my future self.

I have a last question. What happened about Cartier and school was 2=years

Exactly 6 months ag=,ln November we saw each other in Paris and everything was normal. Just af=er, when I started 
working for Alaia you started distancing yourself =ith no reason, recalling something that happened 2 years ago. My last
