So the hotels additional funding of the restaurant is $350 k not $750 
THE TOTAL AVAIALBLE FOR THE RESTAURANT IS $700,000, HOWEVER THIS IS CALCULATED EITHER AS 
REIMBURSEMENT TO YOU AND I AND THEN RE LOAN OR TOTAL NEW LOAN TO RESTAURANT 
TO DATE THE RESTAURANT HAS RECIVED AROUND $650,000 
ESCROW ACCOUNT HAS $722,000 WHICH IS THE $700,000 STATED ABOVE AND $22,000 FOR ALAN'S 
REIMBURSMENT FOR PAYROLL LAST WEEK 
2/ Still to be addressed - which you have not responded to - is an outline as to the possible shortfall 
in the restaurant we could endure from January to April - complete budget sent to you weeks ago SEE ABOVE PLEASE 
3/ I'm told you only are funding the restaurant $700 k because you subtracted last weeks PR? This is 
not correct in addition there are AP items that are not the restaurant responsibility -ie tasting for bankers and loan 
people LUNCH FOR 3 PEOPLE COULD NOT OF BEEN THAT MUCH AND IF NEED BE I WILL PERSONALLY PAY FOR THE FOOD 
COST - the charity event on Monday to promote the hotel I WAS NOT AWARE OF ANY EVENT, UNTIL AFTER THE FACT 
,ALSO UNDERSTAND MONDAY'S EVENT GENERATED INCOME FOR THE RESTAURANT AND NOT THE HOTEL - we can 
address this at tomorrow's meeting SEE ABOVE PLEASE 
4/ AP - how these accounts are paid off- following the AP list you advised lenders would be cured -
you need to complete before they lean the hotel- as a few have threatened NO LIENS HAVE EVER BEEN FILED EVER, AND 
THAT WAS I NEED TODAY FOR TO MAKE SURE ALL CONSTRUCTION PAYABLES FOR WORK DONE ARE PAID SEE ABOVE 
5/ Construction- Friday's meeting with skyland seemed to put us on track -issue now is how hard 
will they push to complete in next 2 weeks - we need gary on board -I hear he is waiting for his payment before he will 
resume -but we can complete if everyone gets aggressive and bring trades back to site 
We need plumbing and Electric punch list items - Chefs are working on their list we will need gary to 
complete hotels items -especially items needed for tco 
GARY IS FULLY AWARE OF FUNDING AND IS ON BOARD 
6/ Speakeasy as skyland pointed out at yesterday's meeting and we both understood -there is little 
they need to contractually complete in the speakeasy as most items are now change orders going forward 
Items to complete will be reviewed on Monday with Tara - skyland and gary 
- your office has still not answered where the banquette fabric is - for starters AS YOU SAW 
YESTERDAY, YOUR OFFICE WAS GIVEN THIS INFORMATION 3 TIMES AND HAS CONFIRMED YESTERDAY THAT TWO 
WEEKS AGO THEY RECIVED THE SAME 
Banquets- to be built 
-Lighting will reviewed with Tara on Monday - 
-front vestibule landing 
Bar entire unit 
Need to address that AC unit in the new area at bar we developed. $ 7k NOT IN THE BUDGET I 
BELIEVE BUT WILL CHECK 
One AP item that needs to ASAP be paid is the soundproofing- we will need this also in the 
speakeasy bar area — WILL CHECK IF IN BUDGET AND PAYABLES 
7/ When will you be in your office on Sunday - I'll come over as you suggested on Friday I WILL 
HAVE THE ABOVE PREPARED SO WE CAN MEET EARLY MONDAY TO GO THROUGH, I NEED TODAY ALONE TO DO THIS 
As we need a great outline prior to Monday's hopefully jump start to complete lobby in 10 days-
speakeasy in 3 weeks 
hopefully we can then try to get some xmas party business - looking at the hotels occupancy it falls 
off the cliff after 12/18 but maybe we can capture some business - this brings me back to the restaurants operating 
budget - we need to address a possible winter shortfall above the $750 k opening budget NEED TO MAKE THE $700,000 
WORK SOMEHOW, THEREIS NO OTHER FUNDING AVAIALBLE
