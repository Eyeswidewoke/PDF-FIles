Up-selling and cross-selling additional products and services. 
Our existing sellers represent a sizable opportunity to up-sell 
and cross-sell products and services with little incremental sales and marketing expense. We believe that POS

services such as Square Appointments, financial services such as Square Capital, and marketing services such as Square 
Customer Engagement represent opportunities to further increase engagement with our sellers. We plan to continually invest in 
product development, and in sales and marketing, to increase the usage and awareness of these services. As a result, to the 
extent we are able to up-sell and cross-sell these financial services and marketing services and develop and introduce new 
products and services to our existing sellers, our growth and margins will be positively affected. 
Ongoing evolution in payment technologies. 
We are committed to ensuring that no seller misses a sale because he or she 
cannot accept a certain form of payment. In the near term, this means enabling our sellers to accept NFC and EMV payments in 
addition to magnetic stripe card payments. We are also committed to encouraging the shift to authenticated technologies for a 
stronger and more secure seller and buyer experience. Historically, card-issuing banks were generally responsible for fraudulent 
card-present transactions. Beginning in October 2015. sellers in the United States who accept card-present payments with EMV 
chip cards and who are not using EMV-compliant hardware are subject to liability for fraud associated with those transactions. We 
believe this will lead to a significant upgrade cycle for POS terminals among our current seller base and that it presents an 
opportunity for us to reach an even broader group of sellers seeking cost-effective solutions to comply with EMV requirements, in 
particular the new standards in the United States and Japan. In conjunction with the shift toward EMV, we believe that sellers will 
increasingly want to enable NFC payments, as NFC technology can offer fast EMV-compliant transactions. In the second quarter of 
2015. we began shipping our first Square Reader for EMV chip cards and announced a Square Reader for both EMV chip cards 
and NFC, which will begin shipping in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
Unlike our Square Reader for magnetic stripe cards, which we distribute for free and the costs of which are reflected in our 
sales and marketing expenses, our Square Readers for EMV chip cards and NFC will be available for sale and will be reflected in 
hardware revenue and hardware costs. We currently offer our Square Reader for EMV chip cards at a price approximately equal to 
our costs, and we expect to do the same with our Square Reader for EMV chip cards and NFC. As a result, the timing of the 
transition of new and existing sellers from our Square Reader for magnetic stripe cards to our Square Reader for EMV chip cards 
and NFC will affect our results of operations. Relative to our free Square Reader for magnetic stripe cards, we may encounter 
changes in demand from new sellers for our Square Reader for EMV chip cards and NFC given the cost associated with 
purchasing more advanced hardware. Additionally, from time to time we may engage in promotional efforts to encourage the 
adoption of Square Readers for EMV chip cards and NFC. These efforts may have short-term negative effects on our operating 
results. 
Sales and marketing investment. 
We plan to invest in sales and marketing channels that we believe drive further growth 
and adoption of our services. Given the nature of our revenue streams, which are distributed over time as sellers process 
transactions, our investments in sales and marketing do not realize returns in the same period in which they are made but over 
subsequent periods, which could adversely affect our near-term results. We measure the effectiveness of sales and marketing 
spending in a quarter relative to the performance of the seller cohort acquired in that quarter. The payback period for our seller 
cohorts has been four to five quarters on average. 
Continued investment in product development 
We will continue to invest in product development to build new products 
and services and to bring them to market. We expect to continue to increase headcount to promote and support our anticipated 
growth. Although we expect these investments to benefit our business over the long term, we expect our total operating expenses 
will increase in dollar amount over time, and in the short term they may have negative effects on our operating results.

Seller size. 
As our existing sellers grow and as we serve increasingly larger sellers, we have an opportunity to significantly 
grow our GPV. Serving an increasing number of larger sellers also presents an opportunity to cross-sell software and data 
products and services that generate incremental revenue and gross profit with limited or zero incremental customer acquisition 
costs. Over time, we expect an increasing portion of our growth to come from increased revenue per seller. However, we
