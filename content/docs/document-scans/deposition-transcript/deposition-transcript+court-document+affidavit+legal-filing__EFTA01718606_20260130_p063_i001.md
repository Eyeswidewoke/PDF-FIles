The proposed victim notification letter asserts that the federal 'victims' have the right to 
appear at Mr. Epstein's plea and sentence or to submit a written statement to be filed by the State 
Attorney. However, as agreed to in the federal non-prosecution Agreement, Mr. Epstein will be 
pleading to mile charges and he will be sentenced for the commission of .crate offenses. The 
'victims' the govenunestt identities relate only to the federal charges for which Mr. Epstein was 
under investigation. The draft victim notification letter cites Florida Statutes § 960.001(k) and 
921.143(1) as the authority for allowing the alleged victims to appear or give statements. 
however these provisions apply only in -the victim of the crime lbr which the defendant is being 
sentenced . . 
Thus Florida low only aflbrds victims of slate crimes to appear or submit 
statements in criminal proceedings and the state charges for which Mr. Epstein will be sentenced 
are not coextensive with the thderal investigation. Further. any questions at this point involving 
the charges against Mr. Epstein or the proper state procedures under which he will plead or be 
sentenced are appropriately made to the State Attorney's Office. 
Continued federal involvement in this matter has led to an impropriety that trots 
unanticipated u.s well. Ms. Villafana aneinptcd to manipulate the terms of Mr. Epstein's 
settlement so that persons close to her would personally profit. Ms. Villafana inappropriately 
attempted to nominate gl=

turns out to be a very go

had been informed of the charges the government would bring against Epstein and in 
response. he asked in an e-mail whether his fees would be capped. Needless to say. we were 
Manned that Ms. Villafana would attempt to influence the settlement process on such improper 
grounds. And even alter the 1.1SAO conceded that it was inappropriate lbr its attorneys to select 
the attorney representative. Ms. Villafana continued to im ro rly lobby for Mr.

directly requesting that

representative in this matter. Although it is unclear how Mr. 
even knows that

has been chosen to administer the settlement process. it can only be understood as 
s.

integrity of the Process and the Legitimacy of the Claims 
The waiver of liability Mr. Epstein must make in relation to Section 2255 endangers the 
legitimacy of the claims made by the alleged victims. There is a heightened risk that the alleged 
victims will make false and exaggerated claims once they are intbrmed of Mr. Epstein's waiver 
under Section 2255 for the settlement of claims pursuant to the Agreement. indeed. Mr. Whitley 
states. " . . .the Department (of Justice) should consider developing processes and procedures to 
ensure that the investigative process is insulated from such risks." it is also well settled that 
witnesses cannot he given any special treatment due to the fact that it may affect the reliability of
