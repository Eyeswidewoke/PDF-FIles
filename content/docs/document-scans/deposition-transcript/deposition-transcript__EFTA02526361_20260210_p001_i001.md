Re: ::: 
i do not want to argue with you.. I don't consider dana worth talking a=out. I have no feelings for dana. „ she is like kim, 
i needed help, th=ts it no more. no less, . i have a monstrous amount of work in progress.=A0 I have asked for your help . 
. the garage is a pigstye. I am no further=ahead with landscape lights, dock, statue base, the house has dog shit 
and=piss,I have cleaned it up myself I , and not challenged you. I went throug= kitchen and house things without you , 
in an effort not to embarass=you. especaillly in front of others. since before sarah left on her vac=tion. you wanted 
authoriity , no food, flowers, facial, helper, / i =ove you, and want you to be happy. I need help to reduce my workload, 
l=think you should re read your emails to me. I asked you to set aside time =o talk, you chose not to, . brice valdson, 
lynn and jojo, need to brou=ht in to help , maybe kim to try out. story to do local things.=A0 kichen doors, etc. As I 
have tried to explain , an agreement h=s two parties, you have chosen not to fulfill your part, it is your prerog=tive, 
besides making soups, which were great , as you followed the reci=e, (a discipline that you abhor ) , healthy snacks, low 
cholesterol, food,=house projects , . I made a point not to argue, it has become silly I g=t angry, and nothing changes, 
therefore taking getting angry out of the eq=ation seems to make sense, I have asked that you have a budget, it a=lows 
you to see what you spend and on what. it is also a reflection of wha= actually gets done. you have chosen not to do it. 
no problem.. I love =ou , so what am i to do? „ I need time to get my life in order , I wou=d have hoped having you here 
would reduce my load ( not that load =). instead of adding stress and conflicts.

Did dana stay in the apartment or at the house after I left ?

You don't like being accused of deception yet you don't even care t= explain how it is possible that this 
happened again...this is a tough one=for me to ignore...THIS is a very irritated nipple
