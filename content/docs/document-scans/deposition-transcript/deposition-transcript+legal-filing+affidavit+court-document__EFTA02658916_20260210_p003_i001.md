I'm glad that you fi=d the idea interesting and think that you might consider it, though 
you ha=e to consult lawyers first. 
My own view is different. =To me the proposal I suggested seems to be a very simple 
way of settling t=is matter, which to me is extremely troubling. I realize that this i= just another case of a longstanding 
difference in the way we approach the=e problems, a difference that has been clear ever since we were discussing=the 
interest on the loan from the Trust and found that we could not commun=cate because I mistakenly assumed that it was 
a discussion among family me=bers while your letters made it very clear and explicit that you saw it as=a legal issue to 
be settled among lawyers and Bainco, perhaps with a media=or in the adversary proceeding. All matters I find it very 
hard to c=mprehend, and to live with, but so be it. 
So by all means c=nsult with your lawyer, or perhaps a battery of lawyers, to make sure 
that=your interests are properly protected. I don't need any lawyer&#=9;s advice. The matter is perfectly clear and 
straightforward. =So there is no reason for me to hire a lawyer to deal with the question an= to have a lawyer contact 
yours and initiate a discussion in which we all =articipate. 
The matter is very simple. We can proceed=without delay if you agree to settle the 
issue in the simple manner that l=suggested. 
As for your proposals in your letter of March 29= as I wrote you, the letter was so 
shocking that it was hard for me to bri=g myself to respond, but I did, in detail, but decided not to send it.Q=A0 Perhaps 
I should. Will think about it. 
As for you= proposals, my response was the obvious one. I'm sorry for the s=ress you 
had to endure, but your efforts were a waste of time for reasons = had already fully explained before you undertook 
them. As I'm s=re you recall, a few years ago, I requested tax payments from the marital =rust when my IRA was being 
rapidly depleted by my advisers who were distri=uting half to family and using the other half to pay management fees 
and t=xes for the entire estate, so that to pay Alex's medical expenses and =he expenses for Wellfleet I had to withdraw 
excess funds with exorbitant t=xes, all that before withdrawing even a cent to live on again with exorbit=nt taxes. Your 
response was to refuse the request unless I agreed to=intrusive and insulting financial investigations -- of a kind I never 
cons=dered when providing funds to you for something you needed. I made i= clear and explicit at the time that I would 
not submit to this procedure.=C24> Since your efforts and proposals simply repeat the same procedure, t=ey were a 
waste of time. 
There were some things in your let=er that were correct. You're right that despite what 
has happene=, I'm still a "wealthy man," with income well above the medi=n, though lacking a pension and accumulated 
property, not at the level of =y peers. Furthermore, I can supplement my income by teaching large u=dergraduate 
courses, something I'd never done and that is not that com=on for people approaching 90, but something that I enjoy. 
And you to= are a wealthy man, for the same reasons: the reasons are that I've wo=ked hard all my life, lived fairly 
simply (and live even more simply today=, and was therefore able to put aside enough money to ensure that my 
child=en and grandchildren are very well cared for, indefinitely. 
But I again suggest that we put all of this aside, and deal qu=ckly and simply with what 
appears to be the one outstanding issue: dividin= the Marital trust and then dissolving it, all very simple, needing no 
law=ers, at least on my part.
