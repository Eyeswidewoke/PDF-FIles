Re:

then , I would propose you pay me 100k if i win and I pay you a million=if i lose. - dersh is my time, no financial risk to 
me. still = would like to get it settled or delayed „

(1) I don't control that call completely. Everyone on my sid= has wanted the depos since January and they are

needs more time. I'm being more than reasonable in the offer to settle that case. =1 do not want that case to turn into 
our case - where it goes on for years= We take these depos, add punitives, then get a trial. And it ends. Once a=d for all. 
If it is the other case that is driving the delay, I don't underst=nd that. Clearly one case has nothing to do with 
the other. And really, co=sidering the facts of that case I could not be more reasonable than I am b=ing there also. I feel 
like on one hand you say you want a global settlement. That is fine with me so w= have tried to work toward that end. 
But the reality is that you want me t= agree to some unreasonable deal. 
If we think about the cases, and what was alleged, I'm crazy to be=considering the numbers we are talking 
about. Juries will render multi-mil=ion dollar verdicts for me and I believe over $20m. I know you say my repu=ation has 
not been harmed. But that's not true. I've done good work to overcome and mitigate the damage but =etween you and 
Dersh considerable damage was done. 
Fair resolution on that case- option one - payment to me of $5 m inclu=ive of fees and costs or option two some 
ratio idea based on the 4th decis=on. Anything beyond that point adds too many variables and defeats =he point. 
CVRA I talked to an ethics expert and the previous offer would be acce=table. Would have to fine-tune it but 
overall it's fine. 
I know you share my feeling about not wasting time, and I appreciate y=ur trying to get the best deal possible. 
But at this point, we are either =oing to reach an agreement or agree to disagree.
