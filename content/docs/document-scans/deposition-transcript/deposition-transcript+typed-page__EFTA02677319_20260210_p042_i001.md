3031 Chemistry of the Atmosphere 
Faculty: Venkataraman, 
TR 
10:00 AM 11:40AM 
Credits: 4 
CRN 7670 Sec A 
Chemistry of the Atmosphere: Earth's atmosphere has undergone significant changes over its 
history, resulting in the loss of species as well as allowing new species to evolve. Since the age of 
humans, the atmosphere has changed at a speed and in ways unprecedented in earth's history. By 
discussing the unclertying chemistry of the atmosphere, this class will illuminate its role in 
supporting life on earth and the human impact on the atmosphere through discussing the 
chemistry of stratospheric ozone depletion, air pollution, and climate change. The chemistry will 
help the cWss identify actions and polices that can address these environmental challenges. The 
course also includes student-led independent research on topics. This course satisfies the 
Intermediate level requirement for the Interdisciplinary Science major. Pre-requisites: One of the 
following (or an equivalent undergraduate chemistry course): Chemistry of Life. or Chemistry and 
the Environment, or Chemical Narrative of the Cell. (4 credits)

3330 Global Himalaya 
Faculty IBA, Faculty

03:50 PM - 06:30 PM 
Credits: 3 
CRN 7781 See A 
The Himalayan region, referred to as the 'Third Pole' or 'Water Tower of Asia' in recent years, has 
become crucial in understanding complex debates surrounding sustainable living and sustainable 
futures. This course will explore the complex reasons for these claims by engaging with multiple 
imaginaries and meanings involving diverse ecologies and cultures in the Himalayas. The seminar 
also invites and challenges students to find 'Himalaya' in their everyday living and intellectual 
pursuits. What would it mean for a person living in Kolkata, India or the Pearl River Delta of China 
or even New York City to identify as a part of the Himalaya? 'Global Himalaya' is designed to spark 
these sorts of questions and inquiry surrounding dynamic flows of ideas, people, capital and 
technology. The course is taught as an Interdisciplinary exploration and rethinking of our 
understandings of 'ecologies' and 'cultures' in the context of the Himalaya.

3400 Urban Ecosystems 
Faculty: TBA, Faculty

03:50 PM • 05:30 PM 
Credits: 4 
CRN 7491 Sec A 
Urban Ecology is an in-depth introduction to the city as an ecosystem. This course provides an 
important interdisciplinary approach to understanding our environment by integrating biophysical 
and socio-economic forces (e.g.. Otology, economics, public policy) to understand, predict, and 
manage the emergent phenomena we call cities. We will cover such key questions as: What is an 
urban ecosystem? Are cities sustainable environments? Glancing at a typical map of the world, 
one might conclude that cities cover a small proportion of the continents and, therefore, have little 
environmental impact. However, our planet is increasingly urban. As cities become the dominant 
living environment for humans. there is growing concern about how to make such places more 
habitable, healthy and safe. more ecological, and more equitable. This course will make explicit 
the connection between human livelihoods in cities. quality of life and the dependence on the 
ecological processes and cycles that support city living. cdiv>Students must have completed

3450 Ecology Lab 
Faculty: McPhearson, Paul 
TR 
01:50 PM - 03:30 PM 
Credits: 4 
CRN 7186 Sec A 
this laboratory and field-based course teaches ecological research methodologies including 
experimental design and analysis in a laboratory setting while also making regular examinations of 
an ecological field study in a metropolitan site. Because ecological science is interdisciplinary and 
urban ecology even more so. this course links physical science with social science by taking the 
laboratory outside. In this nontraditional laboratory course. students design a meaningful research 
project using proven microcosm scale designs to build multi-trophic ecological communities to test 
prominent ecological theory. The laboratory basis for the course is complemented by using NYC as 
an external laboratory. Students gain an in-depth look at ecological field experimentation and 
observation in a highly socialized field location, small urban parks in New York City. A major goal is 
to help students gain comfort with science as a process, with ecology as a science, and with 
examining ecological systems in the unique framework of a metropolitan city. This is a core course 
for the Environmental Studies major.

3501 Environmental Economics 
Faculty: Kremer, Peleg 
TR 
11:55 AM 01:35 PM 
Credits: 4 
CRN 5973 Sec A 
This course is an introduction to the field of environmental economics. It convers basic economic 
theories and explores the role of economic analysis in understanding and valuing the environment. 
The course also examines the application of economics to environmental problem-solving 
including areas such as natural resource management, pollution control, and conservation. 
Throughout the semester, students will read and discuss diverse cause studies of current 
environmental issues, such as global warming water pollution, totem and energy conservation. 
The course develops a unified approach to problems of social and economic development. 
environmental, and related policy measures within one analytical framework.

4500 The Sustainable Food Planning Revolution: a Global Perspective 
Faculty: Ilieva. Bosnia 
TR 
03:50 PM - 05:30 PM 
Credits: 4 
CRN 7780 Sec A 
This course offers an introduction to the emerging interdisciplinary field of sustainable food 
planning, one of the most important urban innovations in the Global North. Students will learn 
about the multidimensional nature of the connection between food. urban governance and 
planning and gain an indepth understanding of the key conceptual, analytical, design and 
organizational innovations that this involves. Moreover, we will explore concrete examples of food 
system innovations drawn from North-American and European cities to investigate how changes 
made at the local level contribute to global processes of socio-technical transformation and, most 
importantly, what roles we can play. The course includes guest lectures by leading scholars. 
activists, and officials from the NYC metropolitan area. who will further enrich our knowledge as 
we move from the conceptual to the organizational dimension of the gobalty•unfolding sustainable 
food planning evolution.

4703 Social Justice In Food System 
Faculty: Reynolds, Kristin

06:00 PM - 07:50 PM 
Credits: 3 
CRN 7279 Sec A 
This course explores social justice in today's globalized food system. We learn about strategies and 
discourses used by community-based aCtrvists. government agencies, nonprofit organizations, and 
scholars in order to realize a more just food system for all. We begin by developing an 
understanding of the food system as one that encompasses farm and industry workers, farm 
owners and collectives, and agroecological systems. as well as all those who consume food. Based 
on this understanding we review various concepts that encapsulate aspects of social justice. (e.g. 
environmental justice: food justice; food sovereignty), and how these are applied in multiple 
contexts and social movements. Throughout the semester we also explore our own positions as 
university-based stakeholders in the food system, and students will be encouraged to integrate 
aspects of their own scholarly and/or activist projects into one or more course assignments. This 
course includes guest speakers and field trips to contextualize readings and in-class discussions.
