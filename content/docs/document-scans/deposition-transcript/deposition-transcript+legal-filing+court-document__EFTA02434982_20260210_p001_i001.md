"The Physics of the Universe" Summit 
Hosted at SpaceX. (Meth and the Andaz West Hollywood Hyatt. January 8.9.10 2010 
To accomplish the extraordinary. you must seek extraordinary people. — James Lee Ryan 
In this two day retreat we hope to bring together the top minds (thinkers and doers) in the fields of the physics of the universe both theoretical and 
experimental. We want to ask and answer questions like "Flow much can we undentand about the universe, soon?' "What is the role of theory and of 
experiment in getting thee "Are there things we may not understand?" and "flow much of what we think we know might be swung?". The meeting 
fosters discussion and we are convinced that when the best people talk the outcome is advance and growth. We are hoping we can avoid standard 
prepared talks, and focus on exciting forefront issues, where there may be differences of opinion, or slew results that will provoke wide discussion. You 
will receive more information about the program and your own possible role in the near future. The summit is inspired by the onset of the 
Large Hadron Collider, the Planck mission, the recent results by satellite and ground based experiments on dark matter searches, and the vast progress in 
theory. Also by meetings such as the Ulf Olympics. and the workshops of the past years at the MCTP. KITP and Perimeter as well as interdisciplinary 
gatherings of the ASU Origins, the Edge Master-Classes and lioogles
