Obligations that satisfy the Ramp-Up Period Criteria. 
(b) 
The Issuer will use its commercially reasonable efforts to have purchased

the criteria set forth in subsection (a) above, and until the Collateral Manager has received Rating

Issuer), the Trustee shall apply amounts held in the Ramp-Up Account (and, if such amounts are 
insufficient, Principal Proceeds on deposit in the Collection Account) to purchase additional 
Collateral Obligations during the Ramp-Up Period as described in this Section. If on the Ramp-
Up End Date, any amounts on deposit in the Ramp-Up Account have not been applied to 
purchase Collateral Obligations, such amounts shall be transferred to the Principal Collection 
Subaccount.

Within 20 Business Days after the Ramp-Up End Date, the Issuer shall 
provide a report to the Rating Agencies identifying the Collateral Obligations and requesting 
from the Rating Agencies confirmation of their respective Initial Ratings of the Senior Notes.

Trustee and each Rating Agency an Accountants' Certificate (a) confirming the information with 
respect to each Collateral Obligation as of the Ramp-Up End Date provided by the Issuer, by
