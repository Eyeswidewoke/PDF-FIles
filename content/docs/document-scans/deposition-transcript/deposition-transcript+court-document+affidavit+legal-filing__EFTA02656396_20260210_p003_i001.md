The matter is very simple. We can proceed without d=lay if you agree to settle 
the issue in the simple manner that I suggested= 
As for your proposals in your letter of March 29, as I wro=e you, the letter was 
so shocking that it was hard for me to bring myself =o respond, but I did, in detail, but decided not to send it. Perhaps=l 
should. Will think about it. 
As for your proposals,=my response was the obvious one. I'm sorry for the 
stress you ha= to endure, but your efforts were a waste of time for reasons I had alread= fully explained before you 
undertook them. As I'm sure you reca=l, a few years ago, I requested tax payments from the marital trust when m= IRA 
was being rapidly depleted by my advisers who were distributing half =o family and using the other half to pay 
management fees and taxes for the=entire estate, so that to pay Alex's medical expenses and the expenses=for 
Wellfleet I had to withdraw excess funds with exorbitant taxes, all th=t before withdrawing even a cent to live on again 
with exorbitant taxes..C240 Your response was to refuse the request unless I agreed to intrusive=and insulting financial 
investigations -- of a kind I never considered whe= providing funds to you for something you needed. I made it clear an= 
explicit at the time that I would not submit to this procedure. Sin=e your efforts and proposals simply repeat the same 
procedure, they were a=waste of time. 
There were some things in your letter that w=re correct. You're right that 
despite what has happened, I'm=still a "wealthy man," with income well above the median, though=lacking a pension 
and accumulated property, not at the level of my peers.=C2* Furthermore, I can supplement my income by teaching 
large undergradu=te courses, something I'd never done and that is not that common for p=ople approaching 90, but 
something that I enjoy. And you too are a w=althy man, for the same reasons: the reasons are that I've worked hard=all 
my life, lived fairly simply (and live even more simply today), and wa= therefore able to put aside enough money to 
ensure that my children and g=andchildren are very well cared for, indefinitely. 
</=iv> 
But I again suggest that we put all of this aside, and deal quickly and=simply 
with what appears to be the one outstanding issue: dividing the Mar=tal trust and then dissolving it, all very simple, 
needing no lawyers, at =east on my part.

<=iv>This is an interesting idea. We could consider it further, but I =ould need 
the advice of my lawyer — and I assume you would want yo=r own lawyer's advice as well — to ensure that any 
agreement w= reach is consistent with Massachusetts law and satisfies the interests, n=eds, and obligations of 
everybody involved. Perhaps, as a next step,=you could ask your lawyer to contact mine and begin a discussion in which 
=e all participate. 
I'm also curious to hear y=ur thoughts about the proposals I suggested in my 
message on March 29th.</=iv>
