1.The note from Gary's attorney at the top of the Settlement Agreement ab=ut Peggy being required to sign and deliver 
to Gary any necessary instrument to close the Estate of Annette Siegel and the Trusts seems unnecessary, as the 
expressed concerns would appear to be addressed in paragraph 7, which provides that "Each of the parties agrees to 
exe=ute and deliver any and all necessary or proper instruments to carry out the purposes and intent of this Agreement" 
To the extent what is=requested is necessary and acceptable to Peggy, it would require a slight addition at the end of 
paragraph 7. 
2. The opening provisions of the Settlement Agreement should name Gary as a party, individually, and in his 
representative capacities as trustee of the Marital Trust and the Annette Trust and as Person Representative of the 
Estate of Annette Siegel. 
3. Recital K appears to be the basis for the consideration to be given to Peggy. Is the stated sum correct? Also, there is a 
reference in recita= K to "50% of the balance of the reserve, if any remains." =hat is "the reserve"? It is not defined in 
the agreement. 
<=div> 
4. In paragraphs 2, note that any reference to Gary having an individual obligation to make any payment provided for 
therein is eliminated. Al=o note that in paragraph (ii) of paragraph 2 there is a reference to a payment of $150,000. Is 
this something that can come from the trusts =r the estate or must it come from Gary? If so, then deleting Gary in h=s 
individual capacity from paragraph 2 would be inappropriate. 
5. In paragraph 3, reference to Gary's individual liability is deleted=C2 from the beginning of the paragraph, but is kept in 
at the end of the paragraph. I am not certain what his attorney is trying to achieve, a=d without any context, I am in the 
dark. 
6. In the comments on the side margin on page 2, Gary's attorney wants t= define Effective Date, but Effective Date is 
already defined in paragraph 5 as a specific date. So, the change requested by Gary =80 s attorney, if appropriate, 
should be made to paragraph 5. Otherwise there will be inconsistent provisions defining the Effective Date. 
7. In paragraph 3 there is an obligation to distribute Peggy's share of=20 "accrued assets after the date of distribution" -
what are &qu=t;accrued assets"? Accrued where? This is too vague. The same is tru= for the obligation to distribute 
Peggy's share of any "additional asse=s" not reflected on the Statement of Account. This is also too vague - literally it 
means any additional assets not on that Statement of Account. 
8. I agree with the comment in paragraph 4 that the form of the releases should be attached to the agreement and 
incorporated therein. I would=20 want this to make sure that there is no later argument about the content of the 
releases. I also might expressly state that full payment of a=l amounts to be paid under the Settlement Agreement is a 
condition precedent to the effectiveness of the releases. Also, it may also be=20 wise to expressly state in the body of 
the releases that not only do the releases cover any claims by a party or his or her successors or assigns, but also the 
release cover derivative claims by devisees, distributes, beneficiaries, and successor fiduciaries making claims through 
the trusts or the Estate.
