Nov,, as senators consider Mr. Acosta's nomination for a cabinet position, the sordid details of Mr. Epstein's case are set to receive 
another public airing. 
The setting will be a federal courtroom in Manhattan. where a trial is expected to start in the spring in a defamation lawsuit brought 
against one of Mr. Epstein's associates. Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of the British publishing mogul Robert Maxwell.
The lawsuit was filed in 2015 by 
who said she was one of Mr. Epstein's victims. 
has accused Ms. 
Maxwell of helping to procure underage girls to engage in sexual activities with Mr. Epstein. In the suit.MM:ontends that Ms. 
Maxwell has defamed her by calling those accusations "untrue" and "obvious lies." 
Ms. Maxwell. in turn, argues that she had the right to publicly defend herself againstMb 
ccusabons. 
The trial, if it proceeds, will probably produce a stream of headlines about sex-trafficking, and could renew scrutiny of Mr. Acosta's 
role in Mr. Epstein's plea deal. 
The matter goes back to 2005, when Mr. Acosta was the top federal prosecutor in Miami. Police detectives in Palm Beach. Fla., 
where Mr. Epstein had a home, discovered that women working for him were finding teenage girls to give him sexual massages. 
Some of the girls were 15 or younger, the authorities said. 
Mr. Epstein hired a top-tier defense team that included Alan M. Dershowitz. After meeting with the defense lawyers. a state 
prosecutor recommended that Mr. Epstein be charged only with a misdemeanor. 
The Palm Beach police chief was so angry about the proposal that he wrote a letter to the Justice Department asking that it get 
involved in the case. 
Mr. Epsteln's lawyers eventually shuck a deal under which he agreed to plead guilty in a Florida court to one count of soliciting 
prostitution and another of procuring a person under 18 for prostitution. 
As part of the agreement. Mr. Acosta's office agreed not to bring federal charges against Mr. Epstein or any of his potential co-
conspirators, court papers show. 
The deal has since been denounced by critics as an example of the way that prosecutors buckle to pressure brought by high-
powered lawyers on behalf of a wealthy client. Mr. Acosta has defended the agreement as the toughest one prosecutors could get 
based on the evidence they had at the time. 
As a cabinet nominee, Mr. Acosta may soon face questions about that decision. And 
and her lawyers have not shied away 
from publicity.
