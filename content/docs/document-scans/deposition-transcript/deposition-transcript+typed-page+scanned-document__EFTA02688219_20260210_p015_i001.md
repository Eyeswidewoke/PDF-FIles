OptiOpia, Inc. Business Plan for Jeffrey Epstein 
April I. 2011 
For initial market entry, partners are essential. OptiOpia's preferred partners for 
entering a developing country market are best-in-class community eyecare centers 
with large operations, quality management, and tiered pricing. Such "seedbed" 
institutions will be motivated to work with them because they will be able to realize 
the benefits from the low-cost auto-refractor of (a) increased referrals, (b) reduced 
training requirements for refractionists (personal communication, Dr. Aravind 
Srinivasan to Dr. Grosof, 2006-9), and from the lens molding machine of (c) reduced 
lens costs (automated edging machines required by opticians to cut lens blanks to fit 
into lens frames now cost $25,000) and (d) reduced staffing costs to operate, learn, 
and maintain edging machines. As experience grows with such institutions, the 
knowledge obtained will be used to target "middle-tier developing countries, 
especially in Latin America, where our market research indicates significant 
opportunity for using autorefractors to improve the quality of eyeglass prescriptions 
for (non-destitute) lower-middle and working classes who have the resources to 
spend 1-2% of annual income on a pair of eyeglasses. 
In each market above, the low-cost autorefractor will face significant competition. The 
principal competing products are the Nikon Retinomax and the Welch Allyn SureSight 
autorefractors, because they are portable and are the lowest-priced autorefractors. 
Important NIH-NEI research, the Vision in Preschoolers Study (discussed in 
Background & Significance) has demonstrated their clinical value in sensitivity and 
specificity as screening devices. These devices are also associated with major 
recognizable brands with established distribution channels. These devices are 
already established in the developed world marketplace and have an (apparently 
quite modest) presence in developing world markets. These two devices are 
designed to measure refractive error more quickly than the first version of the device 
is likely to operate. Because of these products' focus (so to speak) on supporting a 
starting point for refraction, they have not, however, been designed to support highly 
accurate measurement of refractive error, as various biases have been detected but 
not corrected with a look-up-table (personal communication, Bruce Moore, 2006; see 
also operator manuals for these devices). OptiOpia's 'see-through" presentation of 
fixation targets, however, provides a significant advantage in serving presently under-
served markets and children, because pointing to familiar targets accelerates and 
better maintains stable fixation and accommodation than do virtual targets. OptiOpia 
believes the Retinomax and SureSight devices have been priced too high to support 
adoption in the US for the kind of widespread vision screening needed to meet the 
Healthy People 2010 objective, too high to drive a truly compelling case for screening 
(cf. Miller, 2003). There is ample evidence from OptiOpia market research — as well 
as some evidence from the devices' operator manuals, which are freely available 
online -- that the Retinomax and SureSight devices are not well-suited for serving the 
developing world's needs in challenging environments (dusty and humid), in settings 
where electricity is not continuously available and where supply chains for 
replacement parts, repair and calibration services are uncertain. There is little 
evidence that the RetinoMax and SureSight devices will soon be integrated with 
improvements in eyeglass provision — for example, an on-demand, on-the-spot 
system for making and dispensing lenses for huge developing world markets, or a 
new way to deliver made-to-order glasses from a traditional spectacle lens and frame
