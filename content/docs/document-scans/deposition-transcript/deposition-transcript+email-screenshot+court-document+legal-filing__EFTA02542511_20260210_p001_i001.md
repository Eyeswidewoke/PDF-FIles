Jeff, first I would be happy to go ove= and get all the things that you want done, it's not a big deal and I =hink I 
can do it in a very efficient manner. You have some good people ove= there that need some direction. But I need to ask 
some questions first;</=iv> 
• 
What is the scope of the work you want completed now. They are talki=g about roads, walls, permanent 
engineering facilities, etc. 
• 
I need access to all staffing guides that have been prepared. 
• 
Are there any budgetary guidelines in place. 
• 
Who is going to stay on the Island when the project is completed ( will=it be Brice and his wife). 
• 
Do we have contracts for your HVAC and mechanical plants? 
You may not know all these answers, but as long as everyone knows that=is what I need to know when I go 
down there I will be fine. I was introduc=d to you by an friend and representative of Tom Pritzger, of which both I =ave 
the highest esteem for, but you must understand I am presently gainful=y employed and at the present had no intention 
of leaving my present posit=on, unless something drastically changed the direction that I am going in.=With that being 
said I will make arrangements with Cecile to go to the Isl=nd next Friday and Saturday and sort through everything. I will 
probably b=ing two professionals (landscaping and engineering with me) to look at the=project while I work with your 
team to get you the answers you are looking=for. The professionals will be free because everyone in Puerto Rico is 
loo=ing for work and all I am looking to get from them is an appraisal of what=needs to be done to get this job done and 
run efficiently going forward.</=iv> 
For me to make it simple I would charge $225 an hour (that's what = pay my accountant) plus a plan ticket from 
San Juan to Saint Thomas, and =f you could put me up at the house it would be great. Also my son is a Jun=or at 
Brandeis University studying international finance and if you woul= consider him interning a couple of weeks at 
Christmas with your group t=at would be appreciated. 
If this all works for you I will call Cecile this afternoon and make t=e appropriate arrangements. Also keep in 
mind I am not a builder, but I ha=e opened numerous hotel properties in the Isalnds and know whom to reach o=t to for 
help.
