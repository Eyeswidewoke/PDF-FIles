HUBUS133 Alpha Group Capital 
could come into conflict with Hudson Bay Capital's business. If such a conflict arises, 
the principals are not required to subordinate the interests of any other parties (or their 
own interests) to those of the pertinent Fund(s), but they will endeavor to resolve any 
such conflicts in a manner that they believe is fair and reasonable. Hudson Bay Capital, 
its affiliates and its employees may give advice or take action for their own accounts that 
may differ from, conflict with or be adverse to advice given or action taken for a given 
Fund. These activities may adversely affect the prices and availability of other securities 
held by or potentially considered for purchase by the Fund. 
Principal Transactions 
Hudson Bay Capital will not, directly or indirectly, while acting as principal for its own 
account, knowingly sell any security to, or purchase any security from, an Account 
without disclosing to such Account in writing prior to the completion of such transaction, 
the capacity in which Hudson Bay Capital is acting and obtaining the specific consent of 
such Account. An investors' representative (the "Investor Representative") has been 
retained for the Multi-Strat Funds, the Capital Structure Fund and the Corporate Value 
Fund for purposes of considering whether to grant, and granting or withholding, Client 
consent to certain transactions that may give rise to conflicts of interest. Hudson Bay 
Capital may satisfy the consent requirement by providing notice to, and receiving the 
consent of, the Investor Representative and/or the independent directors of such Account. 
Cross Trades 
Hudson Bay Capital may determine that it would be in the best interests of multiple 
Accounts to transfer a security from one Account to another (each such transfer, a "Cross 
Trade") for a variety of reasons, including, without limitation, tax purposes, liquidity 
purposes, to rebalance the portfolios of the Accounts, or to reduce transaction costs that 
may arise in an open market transaction. If Hudson Bay Capital decides to engage in a 
Cross Trade, it will determine that it believes that the trade is in the best interests of both 
of the Accounts involved and take what it believes to be reasonable steps to ensure that the 
transaction is consistent with the duty to obtain best execution for each of those Accounts. 
Hudson Bay Capital may execute Cross Trades, if at all, with the assistance of a broker-
dealer that executes and books the transaction at the close of the market on the day of the 
transaction. Alternatively, a cross transaction between two Clients may occur as an 
"internal cross", where Hudson Bay Capital instructs the custodian for the Accounts to 
book the transaction at the price determined in accordance with the Funds' valuation 
policy. If Hudson Bay Capital effects an internal cross, Hudson Bay Capital will not 
receive any fee in connection with the completion of the transaction. 
Item 12. 
Brokerage Practices 
Hudson Bay Capital has complete authority over the selection of the brokerage firms 
used to execute and clear portfolio transactions on behalf of Clients and custody assets of 
Clients.
