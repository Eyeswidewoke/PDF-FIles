in financial institutions before things become too bad? How more the UAE can move faster 
in fighting corruption and promoting transparency? 
There is already a government financial audit department. The department has a track record of successful 
performance, and it has done very well with investigations related to corruption cases. Enhancing financial 
auditing systems and capabilities is undoubtedly important and that is exactly what we are doing now. As for 
promoting transparency in fighting corruption. I confirm that the UAE is completely committed to highest levels 
of transparency. There is no room for corrupt officials and citizens among us. Handling corruption cases does not 
mean prosecuting judging and penalising corrupt individuals only; it also aims at filling all administrative and legal 
loopholes that=2 Ohave been used to breach the law.

When will the term "remote" (rural) areas disappear from the everyday vocabulary of the 
UAE? 
The UAE does not have remote areas in the negative connotation of the word. We only have areas that are 
relatively remote from urban centers. The urban planning of these areas has to be based on scientific research to 
carefully identify means of providing best efficient services to local residents. 
There are sometimes exaggerated reports depicting these areas as if they are utterly deprived of basic services 
while their residents live in appalling conditions. Sometimes, one reads press reports demanding a school to be 
built in an area that has no more than 50 homes, while there is a school only few kilometers away with available 
means of transportation for the students. 
I've personally toured most of these areas across the country, and I was very keen on visiting particular areas and 
schools that were the focus of the media. I discovered that the situation on ground is often completely different 
from the picture presented by the media. Of course, these areas need to be given more attention -- and this is 
exactly what the government has committed itself to since its first day in office. The government efforts in that 
regard are in line with the directives of His Highness Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, President of the UAE.

Are there any practical measures undertaken by the government to address the issue of the 
population imbalance? What about offering incentives to the UAE nationals to have more 
children? 
The government has embarked on certain measures which have been announced earlier and carried by the media. 
The committee in charge of the population issues is working quietly and in a very effective manner. The UAE 
Government Strategy has identified a major direction for developing particular steps to address the population 
imbalance issue. One of the strategies the UAE government has identified to address this issue involves focusing 
on Emiratization through well-planned policy based on combining federal and local efforts. Incentives for the 
UAE nationals to have more children are already in place. UAE nationals are offered several incentives either in 
terms of services, benefits, salary increments or other privileges for their children. The UAE government has paid 
special attention to offering UAE nationals all possible incentives.
