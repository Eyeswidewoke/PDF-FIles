Did man evolve into God? Being everywhere, every time, in the universe of simultaneous operations? Where man went, so 
went manaTMs information .f°) The physical transportation of man became trivial compared to the transmission of information 
beyond space and time. Man-made technology changed the way every brain works. The understanding of how the brain 
orders its operant imaging processes created gods out of men. But there is only the universe of simultaneous neural functions. 
What of gods? No time for them, no space for them anymore. 
No more art, no more artists. Actions, not objects. Ritual, not possessions. The real artistry is in deciphering the process of 
neural coding. This navigation threads the way through the clues strewn around the environment and sets processes in motion 
to allow patterns to reveal themselves. 
This exercise is not dealing with ultimate definitions. It is presenting hypotheses that are to be used only so long as they are 
functional. Any hypothesis is limited by its parameters. For any system there is a truth proving the system which cannot be 
shown to be true within the system. For man this was the ordering of the brain by direct nonlinear experience, which man 
interpreted as consciousnessfi"the consciousness that could never say how it became conscious. Ideas never reveal what the 
brain is doing. There is no consciousness, no unconsciousness. There is only what the brain is doing. But since this is known 
only in terms of an ordering of the brain, a transaction not accessible to the individual in question, the system goes beyond the 
individual brain and into the evolutionary process, where the activities of a multiplicity of brains serve as terminals for a 
continuous flow of information. For every system there is a truism proving the system which cannot be shown to be true 
within the system. Man is dead. 
Man is dead. The dying, the death, was self awareness, self-consciousness, self-esteem. ItaTMs a myth. ItaTMs over with. Man 
sought self expression, individuality, personality. But his image of the world was a function of the experience of his brain. The 
brain is capable only of acting on information within the parameters of its construction. It is not a egefree agentli What must 
be analyzed is the process, the operant concept of what something is doing, rather than static, fixed states of being. 
Considerations of individuality and personality only beg the pertinent questions. 
The notion of freedom is simply absurd. Where there is no choice, there is no freedom. Antagonists, protagonists. Illusory 
abstractions. All functions of similar operant brain-imaging. Me and you, we and they, good and bad, subject and object. 
Antagonists and protagonists: ItaTMs all a question of self-identity, of ownership. Ownership of ideas. 
It is no longer possible to relate to political considerationsra province of man, the illusory past. Democracy, communism, 
socialism, fascism: all gone. Liberty, freedom, police states, welfare states: all gone. Beyond freedom. Man was never free. 
He was a prisoner of his biophysiological functions. He acted in terms of the construction of the brain and the information it 
received. The information that was received without consent or awareness. The notion of free man, the notion of individual 
choice, is no longer valid. 
Political considerations are trivial. The leaders of governments throughout the world thought in terms of control, believing 
power to be the key. But there is always complete control: Information is the key. The direct nonlinear experience of the 
brain is communicable. Information passes across the arbitrary boundaries of mankind as though they never existed. 
The so-called emotional states of man were nothing more than habit. Fear. Love. Longing. Hate. Pain. Pleasure. Joy. Press 
the button, and the brain will activate the program. So too with manaTMs noblest feelings. Dignity. Honor. Altruism.
