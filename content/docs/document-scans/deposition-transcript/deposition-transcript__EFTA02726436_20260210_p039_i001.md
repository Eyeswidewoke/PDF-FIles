2 
happened in your life that you thought were of

significance?

never do that.

whether or not you --
11 
A. You asked me how did I live a second life. I 
12 
am mother when I go home. I am a prostitute when I mak 
13 
money. That's like two different lives. Okay. So I 
14 
kept one secret from the other.

16 
the book significant events that occurred in your life? 
17 
A. Significant events, like what is significant 
18 
to you?
