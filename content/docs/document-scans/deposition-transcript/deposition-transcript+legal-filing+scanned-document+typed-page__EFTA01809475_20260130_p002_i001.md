boycott law, the right wing is preparing for its next Knesset battle next 
Wednesday about an investigative committee to examine funding for left 
wing organizations. Yisrael Beiteinu made it clear yesterday that if the 
Likud were to oppose the bill and shoot it down, it planned political retribution

of hundreds of families, particularly Bedouins in the Negev. Some Knesset 
members have called it a draconian order and a threat to civil liberties.

was at the root of conflict in Lebanon. Hariri added that indictments issued 
by the UN-backed tribunal seeking the killers of his father and which accuses

leader Hassan] Nasrallah comes out in 300 press conferences, [he] will 
not change the content of the indictment." Hariri added that Lebanon 
"will pay the price" for Hezbollah's refusal to turn over four 
of its members indicted in the 2005 assassination of Hariri's father, and 
he described the current PM Najib Mikati,  as an "agent" of 
Hezbollah. B(Reuters)
