Brad is really at 10. being gracious and above reproach in this negotiation will go a long way to 
stopping Steve from trashing you. you are right about the pr and i am very sensitve to it. I will 
handle it moving foward with jay, you can always blame jay , we will tell brad that you have 
removed yourself. I will charge you a one million dollar fee ( i will not get insulted if you 
choose not to ). Right at the end, not for jay , I will attempt to specifillay get samsung 
approved. letting steve feel good that he flicked you already , will minimize the moving forward , 
so i do not want to give up the higher amount demadn until the very last minute

My gosh, I am s000 sorry that I was not explicit in showing my appreciation. I am deeply 
appreciative from the moment of referral to you checking in on things to the side dialogs 
you've had. I'm terribly sorry I did not express that in a way that made it clear. 
Thank you. 
I'm more than happy to turn this over to you. Any fee you want is fine. That isn't an issue for 
me at all. Or if you don't want to be involved that is fine too. I would rather be friends more 
than anything. 
I'd like you to be involved. I just want you to understand a little more about the situation. It is 
more nuanced than a money negotiation i think. 
We've both done lots of contracts and have both been more involved with lawyers tons more 
than we would have liked. But in very different ways and with different business situations. 
Together we bring almost too much experience. :) 
For me, the currency in this negotiation isn't money. Steve doesn't care about the money 
because he knows I am not motivated by the money. The most important thing for Steve is 
foreclosing options for me. That is why he did the negative stuff about me. The second most 
important thing is just feeling like he won. That means he gets to brag about something. Me 
being a vc is a victory for him. Me being a startup CEO is a victory. Samsung is a clean loss. 
I have been part of a dozen lawsuits filed after Microsoft people went to competitors. It is 
nasty, public, and ultimately Microsoft prevailed in all of them. Either the person backed down 
or ended up so tarnished they were ineffective. The suits are filed regardless of the work--
"inevitable leakage of trade secrets". 
PR is part of foreclosing options. People do remember pr. Read about "Kai Fu Lee". He was 
branded ineffective and then left google as ineffective. He was a traitor then and is now a 
traitor to China. Maybe he is all of those in reality, but he was also a leading Carnegie Melon 
computer scientist.
