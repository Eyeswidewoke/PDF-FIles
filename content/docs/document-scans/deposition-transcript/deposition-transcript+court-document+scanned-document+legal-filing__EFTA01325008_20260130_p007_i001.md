Once the moving party meets its initial burden of production, the burden shifts to 
the nonmoving party to demonstrate that there exist genuine issues of material fact. 
Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 585-86, 106 S.Ct. 
1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986). To defeat a motion for summary judgment, however, the 
nonmoving party "must do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical 
doubt as to the material facts." Id. at 586. There is no issue for trial unless there exists 
sufficient evidence in the record favoring the party opposing summary judgment to 
support a jury verdict in that party's favor. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249. As the Supreme 
Court stated in Anderson, "If the evidence is merely colorable, or is not significantly 
probative, summary judgment may be granted." Id . at 249-50 (citations omitted). With 
these standards in mind, I turn to the Government's motions for partial summary 
judgment. 
B. The Governments Motion for Partial Summary Judgment against Epstein and 
Fisher 
1. Whether the Lease Permitted Oral Consent to a Proposed Sublet or 
Assignment 
*6 Epstein and Fisher contend that summary judgment should be denied 
because there exists a genuine issue of material fact as to whether OFM orally 
consented to Epstein's request to sublet the Premises to Fisher. The Government, on 
the other hand, argues that the lease unambiguously required that a sublet or 
assignment of the Premises be approved in advance in writing, and that, therefore, 
even if OFM did orally consent, such consent was invalid as a matter of law. 
In contract disputes, the Court begins by examining the language of the contract 
itself to determine the parties' intent. Stroll v. Epstein, 818 F.Supp. 640, 643 
(S.D.N.Y.), affd, 9 F.3d 1537 (2d Cir.1993). If the agreement sets forth the parties' 
intent clearly and unambiguously, the Court need look no further. See Sterling Drug 
Inc. v. Bayer AG, 792 F.Supp. 1357, 1365-66 (S.D.N.Y.1992), an in part, remanded 
in part, 14 F.3d 733 (2d Cir.1994). Whether the text of an agreement is ambiguous or 
unambiguous is a matter of law to be decided by the Court. Sterling Drug, 792 F.Supp. 
at 1366. A contract is not deemed ambiguous unless it is reasonably susceptible of 
more than one interpretation, and the Court makes this determination by reference to 
the contract alone. Banque Arabe et Internationale d'Investissement v. Maryland Nat'I 
Bank, 57 F.3d 146, 152 (2d Cir.1995). 
The lease clearly provides that Epstein was required to obtain the advance 
written consent of OFM to sublet the Premises to Fisher. The Assignment and Sublet 
Clause expressly states that "Tenant may sublet all or part of the Premises, or assign 
this lease or permit any other person to use the Premises with the advance written 
permission of Landlord." (Massey Decl., Exh. B at 4) (emphasis added). Epstein's and 
Fisher's argument that the word "may" suggests that OFM could approve a sublease or 
assignment in writing or orally is tortured. Only one interpretation of this clause is 
tenable: prior written consent of OFM was required for a sublet. Epstein's and Fishers 
argument would render the language of the clause meaningless, and I am obliged to 
read the lease in a manner that gives full force and effect to all clauses contained 
therein. See Lloyds Bank plc v. Republic of Ecuador, No. 96 Civ. 1789, 1998 WL 
118170, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 16, 1998). Accordingly, OFM could not have orally 
consented to Epstein's proposed sublet to Fisher, as a matter of law, and, therefore, I 
need not reach the question of whether OFM actually gave oral consent.
