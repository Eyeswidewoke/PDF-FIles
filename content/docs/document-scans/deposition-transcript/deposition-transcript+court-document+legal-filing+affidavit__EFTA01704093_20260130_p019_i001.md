Dishonored Payment Fee (Effective May 8, 2004) 
We are Increasing the fee to $38 whenever any check, similar instrument, electronic payment order that we receive, or a check presented at 
an American Express Travel Services Office or other authorized location is not honored by your bank or other financial Institution. 
Accordingly, vie are amending the Other Fees section of your Cardmember Agreement applicable to Dishonored Payments by replacing 
129" with "$38." We are also replacing the "$29" with "$38' in the Fees section of your `Agreement between Cardmember and American 
Express Travel Related Services Company, Inc. Concerning Electronic Funds Transfer Services." 
APR Applicable to Sign & Travel°  and/or Extended Payment Option Accounts (Effective with billing periods ending in June 2004) 
We are amending the Finance Charges section of your Sign & Travel and/or Extended Payment °pion Agreement as follows: 
Determining the Prime Rate Aoolicable to Your Account We are changing the timing of when we determine the Prime Rate used to calculate 
the variable APRs applicable to your Account to the higher of the 1st or 25th day of the month prior to the month in which your billing period 
ends. Accordingly, the subsection of the Finance Charges section of your Sign & Travel and/cr Extended Payment Option Agreement that 
describes the Prime Rate is revised to replace '20th day' with -25th day." 
APR Applicable to Accounts in Default: We are changing the Default Rate applicable to your Sign & Travel and/or Extended Payment Option 
Account from a fixed APR of 23.99% to a variable APR equal to the Prime Rate plus 21.99%. This change will apply to Accounts that are at 
the Default Rate as of the effective date as well as Accounts that go into default in the future. 
Accortingly, the sentence in the Finance Charges section of your Sign & Travel and/or Extended Payment Option Agreement that describes 
the Default Rate is replaced with the following sentence: 
"The Default Rate is a DPR which corresponds to an APR equal to the Prime Rate plus 21.99%." 
Monthly Payment-Minimum Payment (Effective with billing periods ending in June 2004) 
We are changing the calculation of the Minimum Payment on your Sign & Travel and/or Extended Payment Option Account. In some cases, 
as described below, we will increase the Minimum Payment by $15. Accordingly, we are revising your Sign & Travel and/or Extended 
Payment Option Agreement by replacing the third paragraph of the Billing Statement-Minimum Payment section with the following: 
'Each Account statement will reflect a Minimum Payment due upon your receipt of the Account statement. The Minimum Payment 
for any Charges will be the total of (I) any previous billed Minimum Payments that remain unpaid on the Closing Date of the 
statement and 00 the greatest of: 
(1) 1/50th of the New Balance shown on your Account statement on the Closing Date of the biting statement (the 
calculation of which is rounded up to the nearest whole dollar), 
(2) the current month's billed Finance Charges, or 
(3) $20 (or the New Balance if it is less than S20). 
if the greatest of the three calculations immediately above is the current month's billed Finance Charges, then we will add $15 to 
the calculation of the Minimum Payment. 
You may pay more than the Minimum Payment, up to the entire New Balance, at any time."
