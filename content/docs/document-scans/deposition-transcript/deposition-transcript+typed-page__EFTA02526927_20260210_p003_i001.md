You misunderstand. Apart from this continu=d interchange, which I don't understand, I'm happy and relaxed, 
mu=h more so than during the years before Valeria and I came together. =s for "impoverishment," when I began to look 
into how my affairs=had been handled, I discovered that I was indeed facing financial problems= though far from 
impoverished. I've explained before in letters =hat you have ignored, so I will repeat briefly again. 
I discovered that I have almost no pension: years ago it=was turned into trusts of which you are the 
beneficiaries, and the very sm=ll pension I receive (less than Social Security) ends at my death, leaving=nothing to 
Valeria. 
I discov=red that I was living on an IRA that was being rapidly depleted. To =un through the arithmetic once 
again, there is a mandatory withdrawal of a=out $300,000. Half of that was being distributed to 10 family member=. 
The other half was going to payment of taxes and management fees I= the entire estate. In addition, close to $100,000 
was going to expe=ses for Wellfleet and Alex's medical expenses. Hence before I wi=hdrew a penny for daily life, I was 
already far over the mandatory withdra=al, which, by law, imposes exorbitant taxes that I also had to pay. =ou can work 
out the arithmetic for yourselves. And you will recall I'm=sure that when I requested that some of the taxes be covered 
by the marita= trust (which, by rights, I should have full access to), Harry refused unl=ss I submitted to extensive 
financial analysis, which of course I refused • do on principle. There was never a request for such financial anal=sis 
when distributions were made to family, or when Max distributed funds =rom the marital trust, or for any other gifts 
over the years, and I saw, a=d see, no reason why I should be subjected to this humiliating demand.=/div> 
In addition, as l'=e repeatedly explained, I bought the apartment in the Cambridge co-op on t=e erroneous 
assumption that the cost would be covered completely and quick=y by the sale of the Lexington house. If I'd paid 
attention inst=ad of just trusting advisers, I would have known, as they did, that I did =ot own the Lexington house and 
that the profits would go to you, so I was =uying an expensive apartment in a co-op with no assets at all, a crazy 
dec=sion. As I wrote, I agreed to the surreal idea of borrowing money from witrin the family (with interest) only on the 
false assumption that the loan w=uld be for a few weeks or months, hence meaningless. 
=/b> 
That's the "impoverishment," and I've n=w pretty much overcome what had been done. 
=div>AII that keeps me from being "happy and relaxed" is your =ontinued insistence on pursuing these matters, 
which, again, I don't u=derstand. 
You have even felt the need to hire multiple lawyers to threaten people who you had trusted for years, and who 
we believe have continued to do their utmost to act in your best interest and to help you navigate your new financial 
situation= 
Again, I'd be=interested in knowing your source for these claims. When you learn t=e true facts, as sooner or 
later you will, you will be surprised, and I pr=sume seriously disturbed. You're quite right that for years I ha= trusted 
people who, it turned out, had been making decisions, such as those I have again reviewed, that were quite harmful to 
me. It is hard f=r me to comprehend how you think they would act in my best interest and he=p me navigate the 
financial difficulties they had created, in the light of=what I have explained to you, repeatedly. And as I've written, 
that Hs only a part of it. I mentioned the tens of thousands of dollars w= paid Max for such things as a will so 
outlandish that we had to trash it =t once (see my letter). And there is quite a lot more. I don81=93 understand why
