Calculation of Interest Charges: 
We calculate interest charges separately for each balance shown in the Interest Charge Calculation box. using the 
averagedaily balance method (including new transactions). To get the "averagedaily balance-we take the beginning balance of each day. and. as applicable 
to that balance. add any new charges and fees, and subtract any payments or credits. This gives us the daily balance. We add up all the daily balances for 
the billing cycle and divide by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the "averagedaily balance." We multiply the applicablemonthly periodic 
rate by the "averagedaily balance" and that gives us the interest charges for that balance for the billing cycle. (The monthly periodic rate equals the APR in 
effect divided by 12.) 
How to Avoid Paying Interest on Purchases: Your due date is at least 23 days after the close of each billing cycle. We will not charge you interest on 
Purchases if you pay your entire balance by the payment due date. 
Variable APRs: APRs followed by (V) may vary. 
Payment: You may pay all or pad of your account balance at any time. However. you must pay. by the paymentdue date. at least the minimum payment
