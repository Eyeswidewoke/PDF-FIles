Dear Jeffrey, 
Thank you very, very much fo= your email. I have been thinking about you for the past week, but 
I have =onestly not wanted to disturb you as you have been very kind and generous =ith your time this autumn. 
First of all, I hope that you are wel= wherever in the world you are! 
I am sincerely and very very sor=y that you think that I was un-polite when we last met. I asked 
the questi=n to show my interest for Reid Hoffman and his background — NOT to=be shameless, bold, and with no other 
intention than to show him that I wa= interested. I felt that it was too egoistic of me to sit there and only s=eak about 
my trip to Zimbabwe and myself. May I kindly ask, in this partic=lar situation; what would you have advised me to talk 
about? What question= would have been fine to ask? I must note, however, that it was such a pri=ilege to meet you 
again and Reid Hoffman that morning. 
I wen= to H&M the 8th of December as planned but a problem arose. I had, pri=r to departure, 
had meetings with the person responsible for visas at li&am=;M. I had been told that all my papers were in order. 
However, I had not b=en advised that I needed an American social security number to work for th=m (I have been able 
to use my Swedish one for five years). H&M acknowl=dge that it was not my fault (as I had made sure that I fulfilled their 
re=uirements) but that I could not start to work until I have an American soc=al security number. As it takes about 2 - 6 
weeks to get one, I had to ret=rn home to Sweden (as it is too expensive to be in NY without a salary).=C2* I will return 
to NYC again after Christmas (probable before New Year= Eve). Last week I got another possibility from an investor in 
NYC. 
<=iv>leffrey; I cannot enough articulate how sorry I am that my behavior cam= across as un-
polite. 
I also wanted to wish you a fantasti= Christmas; may it be filled with much joy. 
With warmest and bes= regards,
