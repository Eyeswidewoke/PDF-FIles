> Dear Noam, 
> You are waiting for me to provide guidance as to how you can regain contr=l of the trust funds. My plan is to prepare 
a memo for you outlining your=options in light of the trust terms. I anticipate being able to spend som= time on this 
over the weekend, along with reviewing the drafts of your es=ate planning documents. Once I have sent the memo to 
you we can discuss y=ur thoughts and we can then respond to Max. Unfortunately this is a diffic=lt situation, not simple 
and straightforward, because of the terms of the =rust and fiduciary law applicable to trusts. Please see my email of 
10/17=for an explanation of some of the issues. 
> In some situations a trust is drafted so that you would have the right to=remove and replace the trustee, and in doing 
so perhaps find a trustee tha= would not inquire so diligently as to your personal financial circumstanc=s before making 
a principal distribution to you. In this regard, please r=fer to my email of 10/17 where I summarize the trustee removal, 
resignatio= and appointment provisions. The trustees can both resign at any time. The= appoint successors subject to 
your approval. If they agree to resign you =an find a new independent trustee whom they can appoint. If not, you can 
r=move them but only with the approval of a majority of your children. Do yo= think your daughters would agree to 
remove Max and Harry? If so you could=then appoint a successor. You would need to find an independent trustee. = 
can help you craft a letter to your daughters if you think they might agr=e to do this. 
> My one additional thought right now that I need to review more closely is=that Harry, not being the independent 
trustee, should not have a say in th= distribution decision. If there is nothing in the trust to contradict thi= interpretation 
(I need to review the trust again) then Max alone has the =ower. However this would likely not change the analysis that 
Max believes =e needs to go through since he is accountable to all beneficiaries. He be=ieves he needs some level of 
financial information from you but in my view=that does not need to be detailed. I can discuss with him what level of 
d=tail would satisfy him; however, if my understanding is correct that you d= not wish to provide him with any backup 
for his distribution decision, th=n we should evaluate the removal option and any other strategies I may be =ble to come 
up with. 
> Unfortunately this is not a simple situation and I will do my best to out=ine some additional options for you. In the 
meantime please let me know yo=r thoughts regarding the above. I am available for a call as well, at you= convenience. 
> Best,

> Hello Noam - 
> • I'm afraid I cannot send the money you have requested without further dis=ussion with you and I also feel I cannot 
have such a discussion with you w=thout Deborah's knowledge and participation, as she is your attorney. Ple=se also 
note that any distributions from the trusts would also involve Har=y, who is the co-trustee of the trusts. 
> As you will see, I have again copied Deborah on my reply. I will be glad=to follow up with a meeting or a call when I 
return, next week.
