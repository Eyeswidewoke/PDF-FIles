Agreement and administered in accordance with the provisions of Article III, Section 3.1, 3.2 
or 3.3 of this Agreement, or any successor Trustee thereof, resigns, is removed, becomes 
incapacitated or is unwilling or is unable to serve, a successor Trustee shall be appointed to fill 
the vacancy thereby created, such that the total number of  Trustees acting on behalf of such 
trust at all times shall be two. I 
shall first be appointed to fill any 
such vacancy, and thereafter said successor Trustee may be appointed at any time by the 
Trustees then acting, or, if, as a result of said vacancy, only one Trustee is then acting, by the 
sole remaining Trustee then acting. 
B. 
Except as specifically provided in Article VII, Section 7.1(A) of this 
Agreement, in the event a Trustee of the Trust resigns, is removed, becomes incapacitated or is 
unwilling or is unable to serve, a successor Trustee shall be appointed to fill the vacancy thereby 
created, such that the total number of Trustees acting on behalf of the Trust at all times shall be 
two. KATHERYN RUEMMLER shall first be appointed to fill any such vacancy, and if she 
is unwilling or unable to serve,  
shall be appointed to fill any such 
vacancy, and thereafter the successor Trustee appointed to fill any such vacancy shall be 
appointed by the Trustees then acting, or, if as a result of said vacancy, only one Trustee is then 
acting, by the sole remaining Trustee then acting. 
Section 7.2. - Appointment of Trustee 
The appointment of a successor Trustee hereunder shall become effective when such 
successor Trustee signs an acceptance of the trust. 
Section 7.3. - Resignation of Trustees 
Any Trustee may resign at any time, without the approval of any court, by an instrument 
in writing filed with the trust records. In addition, if there is filed with the trust records a written 
certification from any attending physician of any individual Trustee of a trust that he or she is 
no longer able to make decisions with respect to such trust, then from the date of filing of such 
certification, such individual Trustee shall be deemed to have resigned for all purposes of this 
Agreement. 
Section 7.4. - Vacancy in Office 
If there is a vacancy in the Trustees and no successor Trustee is designated pursuant to 
Section 7.1 who is willing to act, the legally competent adult Beneficiary (or a majority in 
beneficial interest of the legally competent adult Beneficiaries if there are multiple 
Beneficiaries) then entitled or permitted to receive income from such trust shall designate a 
successor Trustee by an instrument in writing delivered to the designated Trustee. If the legally 
competent adult Beneficiaries do not designate a successor Trustee within sixty days after 
receipt of notice of such vacancy or if there is no legally competent adult Beneficiary of such 
trust, then a successor Trustee shall be named by order of a court of competent jurisdiction. All 
of the fees and expenses of the Trustees (including attorneys' fees) attributable to the 
appointment of a successor Trustee of a trust shall be paid from the assets of such trust.
