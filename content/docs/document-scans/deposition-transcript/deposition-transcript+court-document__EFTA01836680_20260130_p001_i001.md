Dear Sirs, 
We represent freedom air intl.. . The owner of 909 Jc a gulfstream aircraft. We 
have been traveling in and out of Teterboro for over fifteen years . We are grateful for the job 
that customs and Border protection does to keep our country safe. We have always been 
treated respectfully and courtesuly by your able bodied staff. 
WE are writing to clarify , what aim 
be a misunderstanding of the law by your officers 
on duty the day of feb 20.. Oficer 
, met the aircraft, and told us that though we were 
coming in from our base of operations in the Unived States Virgin islands. A Passsenger , a 
U.S Citizen , would be required to file a form and be charged 540$ for doing so. The capt and 
co pilot repeated attempted to point out that passports were not required of U.S citizens 
traveling from the US VI.. This was met with a very respectful but entirely inaccurate respone. 
The passenger was told they need a passport and should get one. It"s not that much money, ". 
The officer on duty that took the information and was faxed all the details. Notified the capt 
that even out of an abndance of caution an aepis was filed , and the Capt gave both him and 
Agent 
the confirmation number. The information was not in the system , The 
passenger was told to fill out a waiver form, The supervisor was called and asked if they would 
" waive the fee. A fee that was not required, The passgenger had a valid birth certificate and 
flordia drivers licence. All that is legally required.. The Agent issued a non compliance notice 
that reference a visa waiver program, used for foreign citixzend Find copy attached, Entering 
th Waited States.. This was also not required, As you are I sure aware the estas program is 
for roreigners entering the us . not Us citizens coming from a Us terriroty, Again when this 
was brought to the officers attention the passenger s were all told , they were flying in 
internatnional air space , and therefore needed passports. On at least three occasson that Agent 
had the right to keep everyone there for two hours. To go through the bags in detail. 
Instructingn the owner that he did not like the sighs and sounds that were being made. Though 
there was a sign in bright magic marker that 909 Je should receve a full exam. The found 
radiation on what we were told was probably ceramic turbines byt the agent, then asked for 
maintenace logs , though we are not a 135 category. 
Many of the guidelines that we have 
meticullusly followed , were going to be ignored. Though we are traveling from a U>S> 
posseion where no aepis is requreid, The capt Dave Rogers, spoke to Officer Conrad at 
1pm. . He was told that officer cold not find it in the system , so would he fax a copy of a form 
similar to the 178 form that was disbanded. He did so. 
We are pobvioulsy aware of the unique circumstances and the owner of the plane is a 
registered sex offender and subject to enhanced scrutiny. This has always beend a respectful , 
and understood procedure. We would like to again reitereate that your agents have always 
been professional . It would be of great help if we could get a letter to confirm that passengers 
traveling form the US virgin islands can do so with a valid drivers license and birth certificate„ 
That Aepis is helpful but cannot be required, from flights from US TERlotres. That estas 
numbers are good for a period of time and only apply to foreigners.
