Dear Doddoy, 
We recognize that you see a simple way forward -- we should tell you by email what we disagree with in what 
you have outlined to us, and what our reasons are for disagreeing - but to us this does not seem so simple, for all the 
reasons we mentioned below. Thus we can't answer you right now, but we didn't want to just leave your email there 
without any reply. We know this isn't a real response, and we'll get back to you soon wit= something clearer. 
love, Avi, Diane and Harry

I'm sorry, but this is surreal. 
I have repatedly spelled out the circumstances in extensive detail. Your sole response has been that you 
disagree, without once saying what you disagree with or why. I have never denied anything you have tried to say, for 
the simple reason that you have never said anything that could either be affirmed or denied, only that you disagree with 
what I've spe=led out but without any indication of what or why. 
In this letter, for the first time, you specifically address something I have written. You write: "We can tell from 
your tax requests that you have been spending many hundreds of thousands of dollars every year on personal expenses, 
even after having successfully eliminated the extra costs that you have mentioned as a drain on your resources (the 
Cape house, the gifts, Anthony's salary, etc).&q=ot; What I wrote you however is quite different. To repeat: there is a 
mandatory withdrawal from the IRA. Half of that was distributed to children, grandchildren, and spouses. The other 
half was spent in taxes and management fees for the entire estate. Cape house, Alex&=39;s medical expenses and other 
gifts, Anthony's salary, etc., were from nec=ssary withdrawals over and above the mandatory withdrawal, hence subject 
to exorb=tant taxes, requiring additional withdrawal. That is before we even get to ordinary living expenses. The 
request had nothing at all to do with personal expenses, as you can see by just looking at my letters and running through 
the arithmetic. So the one case you now mention is flatly incorrect. 
But this tells us how to proceed: tell me explicitly what you have in mind, and then we can proceed in a 
reasonable fashion. 
There's a simple way out of this impasse -- not by setting up an advers=ry proceeding with a mediator, as you 
suggest, but by you telling me what you disagree with in what i have outlined to you and what your reasons are. You 
have not yet done that in a single letter. So, simply, why not do it right now, and then we can proceed. 
Again, I've repeatedly spelled out the circumstances in extensive detai=. So, simply, tell me what you disagree 
with and why. No mediators are necessary, just a direct response. Or if you feel that you have already done so, then re-
send the letter in which you responded to my detai=ed account, telling me what you disagree with and why.
