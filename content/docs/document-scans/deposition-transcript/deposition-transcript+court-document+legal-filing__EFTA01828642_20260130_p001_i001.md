Jeffrey-
Having a stupendous time since I arrived Friday morning and hit the ground running. 
My room is very nice and very very sunny and 1 can actually see the sea if I hang out my balcony. Last year I was in the 
back above the glass bottle cruncher desposal. After my "diary" I have been upgraded. 
Have seen a film a night. 
Friday-went to Jane Campion film, "Bright Star" with Matthew Modine (who I found in my lobby with nothing to do), 
actually was his "date" went to red carpet premiere at the Palais..posed for international papparazzi with him 
and 
dinner in Antibes with Tom Scott of Plum TV. 
Saturday saw Jerry Lewis (an icon in France) at DuCap lunch...also Tilda Swinton, Irvin Winkler, Quentin Tarrantino-
he has hot film for Wednesday night, "Inglorious Basterds" with Brad Pitt. 
Saturday night Charles Finch had very chic dinner....with Ralph Ficnncs, Rachel Weisz and Darren Aronofsky, Elizabeth 
Banks, Jacob Rothchild's daughter, Jagger, Scorsese...and 100 English/American/French filmmakers at the Eden 
Rock overlooking the sea. 
Was the most interesting dinner with great people. 
Sunday, saw morning screening of "Agora" with Rachel Weisz (Egypt in 349 AD) and Johnny Pigozzi had his annual 
lunch at his seaside villa next to DuCap. Chased Mick Jagger around the pool all afternoon and he would not let me 
take his photo...Sunday night went to a party for Weinstein's unfinished film, "Nowhere Boy" about John Lennon as a 
boy/young man and hung with Julian Lennon...then "Agora" party to see Rachel and Max Minghella... 
Monday- Disney made it snow in front of The Carlton as Jim Caney arrived in a horse drawn carriage with 4 black 
horses in a blizzard with Christmas carols blasting over loud speakers...then they showed 10 mins of 3-D footage in a 
hugh theater Disney built inside the hotel...footage will terrify any small kid. 
....That night- Harvey Weinstein showed 10 minutes of footage from "Nine" that is so spectacular that he already won the 
Oscar...then onto the Palais for red carpet premiere of "Looking for Eric"...(English...not as many American films this 
year)-saw Hillary Swank- then onto Paul Allen's 414 foot boat, Octopus. that was built in Germany 6 years ago and is

Kruger,

"Twilight", Paris Hilton....got tour of boat..65 crew. 
Tuesday- ran to Pedro Ahnodovals press conference for "Broken Embraces" with Penelope Cruz...leamed all about 
Pedro's films from Pedro..took notes like a journalist. 
Back to Ilotel DuCap for lunch...sightings- only Ron Meyer. Harvey Weinstein, Hugh (Chariots of Fire) Hudson...slow 
day. 
Went to Bridgette Lacombe's book party on the beach... her latest book has sensational photos of the fabulous and famous-
too heavy to pack..then to Palais for red carpet premiere of "Broken Embraces"...Penelope is devine in it...then to after
