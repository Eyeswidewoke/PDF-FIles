She has not gone out since the National Enquirer broke the story about her alleged affair with Woods. 
That Thanksgiving weekend, there were 50 people with cameras banging on the windows of her 
Manhattan brownstone. She's since been staying in Las Vegas, in the condo she owns at 
Turnberry Place, where the security is state-of-the-art. 
This new persona is the opposite of who I am, she says. I was alone every night. My life was my work. 
But people took my job and made it a scandalous, negative thing. 
Before nightlife, Uchitel was a segment producer at Bloomberg News and engaged to a man who died in 
the 9/11 attacks. In 2005, she drove across the country to Las Vegas, not knowing what she was 
going to do. Before she'd even arrived, a friend got her a hosting gig at Tao. 
When you lose your whole future, she says, it's something that changes you. 
On one of the online memorial guest books for her deceased fiancé, several people have lately written 
in, consoling his parents that the woman their son loved is not the same Rachel Uchitel in the 
mediashe doesn't even look like the same person. They're talking about an AP shot from 
Bellevue Hospital in the days following 9/11. In the picture, she is crying and blonde and 
holding his image. Comparing it with recent pictures, one can't help but notice a Jessica Rabbit 
effect. 
I have big breasts, she says, yes. But I'm really offended by the notion that I used my sexuality. 
It's a cool Las Vegas night in March at the new tapas place in the Aria hotel. Uchitel is wearing an orange 
cardigan and black leather pants, her thin legs balancing on top of high heels with some girlish 
platform to them. She's picking at her tuna tartare but mainly she is out of cigarettes. She bums 
a few from the waiter and stands outside the place, a giraffe on stilts. She's 35 years old, too old 
for being a VIP host anymore, she says. 
People say, Oh, Rachel, she's such a starfucker,' that I hang out with only celebs. No. I hang out with 
successful people. I hang out with people who matter, andshe says the next in the way an 
assistant might speak about a boss she deeply admiresl'm honored to. 
A source in the business estimates that she made more than any other VIP host. At my best, Uchitel says, 
I made $250,000 base, plus a guaranteed $250,000 from the tip pool. Half a million a year, paid 
by a single clubprobably Tao, though Uchitel will not confirm it. (She also says she has never 
been kept on retainer or paid by a client directly.) This does not include the extracurricular 
trips, on yachts in Saint-Tropez and to Monte Carlo. What she did on those trips, she says, was 
protect her clients and get them what they needed. 
But she really hates the accusation that she set up sex for any of her clients. She is not a pimp or a 
madam, she says. It's not our job to get anybody laid. 
What the hosts do is more like placement. They are puzzle-doers, wielding a table chart and making sure 
the room looks good, depositing models beside Wall Street bankers in a Rubik's Cube of 
dovetailing desire. They are also Realtors, selling tables, sometimes auctioning them off to the 
highest bidder. At the door, a host will procure a man's credit card and his I.D. and quote him 
what the minimum will be at a certain table. Table minimums are usually around $1,500 at 
clubs in Manhattan, but a prime spot can go for as much as $30,000. And Uchitel has seen bills 
of $245,000 and higher for patrons who are buying huge Methuselahs of Champagnethe 
equivalent of eight standard bottles in oneor, in their schnockered magnanimity, have decided 
to treat other tables to rounds of Cristal. 
Next: The sort of information VIP hosts store in their BlackBerrys about clients.
