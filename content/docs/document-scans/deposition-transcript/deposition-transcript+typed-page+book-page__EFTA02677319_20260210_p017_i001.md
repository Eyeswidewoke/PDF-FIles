201.9 Listening to America 
Faculty Napolin, Julie 
MW 10:00AM- 11:40 AM 
Credits: 4 
CRN 7180 Sec A 
This course is an introduction to rhetorical theory and its modern American contexts. Considering 
the classical philosophical relationship between speech, listening, vernacular, and democracy. this 
course will will interrogate the ways in which America and Americans are rhetorically composed. 
solidified, and contested through the voices of literature, oratory, music, and audio culture. Jay 
Filegelman argues that 'The Declaration of Independence' was meant to be read aloud and that. 
in reading this document silently to ourselves, we fail to grasp its meaning and potential. He 
maintains that America is a culture and society built on the affective and rational dimensions of 
listening. We will consider such texts as Whitman's -Song of Myself.' the people's microphone of 
Occupy Wall Street, Martin Luther King. Jr.'s 'I Have a Dream' speech, and Zeta Neale Hurston, 
Their Eyes Were Watching God. We will ask why Americans are galvanized by voices and how a 
deeper understanding of rhetoric can contribute to a broader definition of nation.
