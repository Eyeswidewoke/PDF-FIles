once again , you ignore the role you play, your responsibility and your lack of participation. it is 
as if everything happens to poor little you. the same poor little you that you take pride in telling 
me you faked, in order to appear innocent. the same poor little you that only suffers theanities 
of my behavior without thinking about how little you actually do. Yes everyone loves 
she 
is kind, friendly open warm , affectionate. , how few people tell me to send 
way.

t2s charmed everyone on the ranch. Everyone thinks she likes them, they have all told me 
separately how they think she prefers them to the others, when she gives them a kiss and I am in 
the room. It's so funny. I know she will wag her tail when a new visitor comes, sleep with anyone, 
play with anyone, but when I call her, she will rather do it with me. There is no question how much 
she loves me and how much she misses me when I leave. She would choose me over anyone else in 
the world. When she is charming other people and quickly wraps them around her little paw, she 
might as well wink at me •-) 
You used to be like fl
 was almost a show watching you charm another one, knowing it's just 
like a game and having no doubt you love me desperately ( we even used to secretly hi-five when 
you did well) I wish I could still feel that way but something changed. Now your 'games' are more 
secretive, there is no winking, they feel more real and I no longer know you really love me, miss me 
or would pick me over an one else. That takes the fun part away. Now watching the routine is just 
stressful, like when 
uns out alone and I can't see her.. I still love her the same but I am 
annoyed with her, I yell her name as many times as it takes for her to get back and the whole 
experience is not pleasant.

I am very stressed , but disciplined. These times are the most stressful, therefore I have decided 
not to make important decisions, until I can breathe , at least a little. that is why i need time 
away. you add, rather than releive the stress. You were so different., you were affectionate, 
and supportive,. said little, and smiled. Then 
- just one thing. please dont do just one 
thing. if you really love me , how can you con mue o do just the one thing i can't live with. I 
told you on the street that if i gave in to your whiniing it would be the beginnng of the end. IF

asked you to stop nagging. i told you that i loved only you anal 
did not want to say 
no to either one of you . I asked you to sto nagging. I walknvt you on the ranch, 5
