With respect to each and every ACH Instruction, you represent and warrant to the Bank and agree that: (a) each 
person shown as the Receiver on an ACH Instruction received by Bank from you has authorized the initiation of 
such ACH Instruction and the crediting or debiting of its account in the amount and on the effective entry date 
shown on such ACH Instruction, (b) such authorization is operative at the time of transmittal, crediting and/or 
debiting by the Bank as provided herein (c) you shall perform your obligations under this Agreement, including

sanctions laws administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control and (d) you shall be bound by and comply 
with all rules of the applicable clearinghouse, as in effect from time to time, including but not limited to the 
provision making payment of an Entry by the RDFI to the Receiver provisional until receipt by the RDFI of final 
settlement for such Entry. You specifically acknowledge that you have received notice of the rule regarding 
provisional payment and of the fact that, if such settlement is not received, the RDFI shall be entitled to a refund 
from the Receiver of the amount credited and that you shall not be deemed to have paid the Receiver the

misconduct. Any overdraft arising in the Account(s) shall become subject, at the Bank's sole option, to a lien 
and subject to be set off against the balance of any of your other accounts with the Bank.

Positive Pay Services (For Business Clients Only) 
A. The Positive Pay Service is an elective feature of the Internet Banking Services, available to business clients, 
which enables you to notify the Bank of all checks you have issued, so that the Bank can, in turn, notify you in 
the event the Bank receives a request to process a check that was not identified to us via the Positive Pay 
Service. 
B. If the Bank receives a request to process a check that you have not informed us about and has not been 
identified to us via the Positive Pay Service, we will notify you through the Internet Banking Services of such 
pending request. 
C. You may enter the details for checks issued by manually entering the information when you connect to the 
Internet Banking Services or by importing a check issue file. The information you enter for each check you 
issue must accurately state the check number, date, and the exact dollar amount of each check drawn on 
an Account. 
i. 
You understand and acknowledge that if, as a result of a system failure or outage, the check file is not 
accepted via the Internet Banking Services and/or the Bank cannot process the file, the file shall be 
considered as not received and the Bank shall have no liability therefor. 
D. Payment of Presented Items and Reporting of Exception Items 
The Bank will compare each presented check by check number and payment amount against the information 
you provide via the Positive Pay Service. On each Business Day, the Bank: 
i. 
May pay and charge to the designated Account each presented check that matches by check number and 
payment amount a check that you have entered via the Positive Pay Service. 
ii. Shall provide you with an electronic notification of any checks presented for payment that do not match the 
information you have provided (an "exception check"). The Bank will notify you of any exception checks 
identified each Business Day by 9:00 a.m. on the following Business Day (the "Notification Date"). 
E. Pay Request/Return Request 
You shall review any exception check(s) on the Notification Date, and notify the Bank via the Internet Banking 
Services whether to pay or return each check identified in the notification by 1:00PM on the same day. If you 
do not notify the Bank otherwise prior to such deadline, the Bank will make final payment of the exception 
check(s) and charge the designated Account(s) for the checks that are drawn against it. 
F. The Positive Pay Service may not be used for any check that the Bank has already cashed, negotiated or paid or 
for which the Bank is already committed to honor or pay under applicable laws, regulations or rules governing 
such items. 
G. You agree to pay any and all fees related to the Positive Pay Services. Please refer to the Bank's schedule of 
charges for Positive Pay Services, as set forth on the Fee Schedule to the Account Agreement 
H. The Bank is entitled to rely on any information you provide in connection with the Positive Pay Service and 
shall not be responsible for detecting or remediating any errors contained in any check file, pay request or 
return request.
