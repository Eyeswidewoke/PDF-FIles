<=pan> Moreover, the Agreement also required Mr. Epstein to pay substantial amounts of money to 
opposing lawyers who would a=tempt to search out names on the list and represent them in suing Mr. Epstein. In 
additi=n, as a result of the liability waiver to which Mr. Epstein was required to ag=ee, even civil lawyers who were not 
appointed under the Agreement to represent purported victims were encouraged to seek out claimants to file suit 
agains= Mr. Epstein knowing that as a result of his civil liability waiver under th= Agreement, any such lawsuit would 
generate a financial windfall from which these attorneys could exact a substantial contingency fee. In effect, this 
astonishing Agreement encouraged both the appointed lawyer and unappointed lawyers to file civil suits against Mr. 
Epstein at his expense. with out him being able to say , =ever heard of her. 
<=pan> 
<=pan> Mr. Epstein's attorneys, among whom were former federal prosecutors and a former United 
States District Court judge,= consulted with other former federal prosecutors and another former federal judge, who 
opined that inclusion in =he Agreement of these wild unprecedented provision should be avoided, as=they created 
inappropriate risks of unintended involvement by the United States Attorney's Off=ce in civil cases to be litigated against 
Epstein, which is well outside the scope of t=eir legitimate authority. Those warnings were well founded. Several 
claimants, including one who was not even identified as a victim on the United States Attorney=E2.4es Office's list, 
filed complaints citing the Agreement as a basis to =stop Mr. Epstein from denying liability even for matters outside of 
the contemplatio= of the Agreement. Moreover, briefing from the United States Attorney's Office was judicially 
required in at l=ast one civil case against Mr. Epstein, and in several other cases, threats were mare by Plaintiffs' counsel 
to ask the United States Attorney's Off=ce to hold Mr. Epstein in breach of the Agreement in order to exact litigation 
concessions from Mr. Epstein that were never contemplated by the Agreement. =ln still another case, Mr. Epstein was 
forced to retract a legitimate motion to dismiss a civil claim being threate=ed by a breach if he did not do so .As a result 
of these highly unusual requirements in the Agreement, Mr. Epstein paid millions of dollars in civil monetary damages 
without even the=20 benefit of being able to mount a defense . Florida also has a unique=20 statutory provision that 
makes misrepresentation of age , not a defense.

<=pan> This Agreement and the decisions of United States Attorney Alex Acosta were not made in a 
vaccum. Nor wer= they made by a single decision-maker as depicted in the Herald articles. Instead, the Agreement was 
carefully negotiated between highly experienced prosecutors and Mr. Epstein's=legal team. Because of his legal team's 
dissati=faction with the severity and the unprecedented and unorthodox nature of the civil liability waiver and monetary 
provisions in the Agreement, Mr. Epstein4o=8O4$ attorneys sought review by many in the hierarchy of the United 
States Attorney's Office. The Agreement was further reviewed by three levels of senior officials at the Department of 
Justice i= Washington: first by the heads of CEOS (the Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section), then by the Criminal 
Divisi=n, and finally by the Deputy Attorney General, Mark Filip, who, with the excep=ion of the Attorney General 
himself, was the highest ranking official at the Department. In short, despite the Herald's criticism, the Agreement 
between the Government and Jeffre= Epstein was a responsible and well-vetted conclusion to a unique and complex 
case a= the crossroads of the federal and state law enforcement powers. 4>=A0

<=pan> At the core of the architecture of the criminal justice system's division of power between state 
and feder=l criminal laws is the pivotal principle that absent a clear indication by Congress th=t a federal statute is 
intended to effect a "significant change in the =ensitive relationship between federal and state criminal jurisdiction", 
pros=cutors and courts are required to narrowly construe the scope of federal criminal statutes. The United States 
Attorney Office was traveling in unchartered territory in attempting unprecedented applicat=ons of 18 USC 2423
