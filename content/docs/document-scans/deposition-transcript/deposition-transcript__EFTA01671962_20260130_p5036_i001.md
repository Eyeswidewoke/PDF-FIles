Summary of Other Changes, as of May 1, 2019 
Cash Advance 
We are changing the name of the first section of the How 
Rates and Fees Work table on Page 2 of Part 1 of the 
Cardmember Agreement to Rates for Pay Over Time and/or 
Cash Advances and we are adding a new Rate Description, 
Prime + Margin, APR and DPR for cash advances in the 
row called Calculating APRs and DPRs. We are also adding 
a new row called Cash Advances in the Fees section of 
the How Rates and Fees Work table on Page 2 of Part 1 
of the Cardmember Agreement to add a cash advance fee. 
The cash advance fee will be 5% of the amount of cash 
obtained from an ATM (including any fee charged by the 
ATM operator) or other cash advance transaction, with a 
minimum of $10. We will add this fee to the Cash Advance 
balance. 
Words we use in the 
Agreement 
We are updating this sub-section under Introduction in Part 
2 of the Cardmember Agreement to define what we mean by 
"cash advance" when we use this word in your Cardmember 
Agreement. We are also updating this sub-section to reflect 
that a "charge" includes a cash advance. 
Using the card 
We are updating this sub-section under About using your 
card in Part 2 of the Cardmember Agreement to reflect that 
we may permit you to make cash advances at our discretion 
and that cash from an ATM will no longer be withdrawn from 
your checking account. Instead, it will be charged to your 
Card account. 
Limits on cash advances 
We are adding a new row called Limits on Cash Advances 
under About using your card in Pad 2 of the Cardmember 
Agreement to explain the maximum Cash Advance balance 
based on the Card you have. 
More About Pay Over Time 
We are changing the second sentence of the last paragraph 
of this sub-section in Part 2 of the Cardmember Agreement 
to clarify that we will not place a charge into a Pay Over 
Time balance if doing so would cause the total of your Pay 
Over Time balances and your Cash Advance balance to 
exceed your Pay Over Time Limit. 
When you must pay 
We are changing the second sentence of this sub-section 
in Part 2 of the Cardmember Agreement to clarify that your 
statement will show a Minimum Payment Due if it includes 
either a Pay Over Time balance or a Cash Advance balance. 
How we apply payments and 
credits 
We are updating this sub-section under About your 
payments in Pad 2 of the Cardmember Agreement to reflect 
how we apply payments and credits when you have a Cash 
Advance balance on your account. 
How we calculate your 
Minimum Payment Due 
We are updating this sub-section under About your Minimum 
Payment Due in Part 2 of the Cardmember Agreement to 
reflect how we calculate your Minimum Payment Due when 
you have a Cash Advance balance on your account.
