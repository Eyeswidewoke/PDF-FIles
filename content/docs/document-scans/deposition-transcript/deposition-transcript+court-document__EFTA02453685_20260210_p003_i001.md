Factual Background<A> 
Investigation by Palm Beach Police Department 
As has been reported over and over for the past 10 years. In March 2005, t=e Palm Beach Police Department 
opened a criminal investigation of Mr. Epstein when the father and stepmother of 
complained to police 
about=a visit by their 14-year old daughter to Mr. Epstein's Palm Beach hom=. What has not be=n reported is that 
informed police that they believed inappropriate conduct =ay have occurred between Mr. Epstein 
and their daughter. The police interviewe= 
who had visited Mr. Epstein's home only once, but b=ought 
no charges after interviewing her, though monitored activity at Mr. Epstein =80 s home through sporadic surveillance 
and occasional trash pulls. 
There are several reasons that explain this result 
told the Palm Beach =olice on more than one occasion 
that she was instructed by 
= the woman who brought her to Mr. Epstein's home, that 
had to =ell Mr. 
Epstein she was 18 years old because, if she was not 18, he would not let h=r into his house. 
also in=ormed the 
Police that she did in fact tell Mr. Epstein that she was 18 years old. She also informed police that Mr= Epstein had no 
sexual contact with her. M=. Epstein took a lie detector test, the results of which confirmed that 
told hi= she was 
%
18, that he believed 
when she told him her age, that he never threatened 
M
 
in any way and that no sexual 
contact occurred with 
In addition, IM, wh= had previous run-ins with the Police, maintained a "MySpace page 
at the=time of the investigation on which she stated that she was 18 years old, posted naked a=d provocative 
photographs, admitted to having sex . <=pan class="">that she was not a virgin, to using drugs, and to having beaten 
someone up, and to having shoplifted and claimed=to earn $250,000 or more. 
=AO In addition, the persons who filed the police report, 
=99s father and stepmother, both had criminal 
records.=C2 The father had served 21 months in federal rison for bank fraud, an= the stepmother had a state 
conviction for identity fraud. Moreover, 
true motivation for going to the police later becam= 
apparent when they held a press conference on the courthouse steps announcing their civil lawsuit seekin substantial 
monetary damages from Mr. Epstein. They commenced that lawsuit without authorization from 
though 
she was now an adult. and it=was ultimately dismissed. 
did eventually file her own lawsuit in order to 
profit from these events, despi=e the fact that she had already confirmed to the police that she lied to Mr. Epstein, 
specifically telling him that she was 18 years old, and that no se=ual contact with him occurred [need to confirm this 
from transcripts] on the on= occasion that she went to his house. =See March 13, 2005 Tran=cript of Interview with 
at 38:21-39:4, 39:9-18. 
* *=A0 
Q: 
=C2 At any time, did he speak to you and does know how old you are? Di= he know how old you were? 
A: 
=C2 . . .As a matter of fact, 
I told me to say I was 18 because 
said tell him you're=18 because 
if you're not, then he won't really let you in his house. So I said I was 18. As I was giving him a massage, he =99s like, 
how old are you? And then I was l=ke 18. But I kind of said it=really fast because I didn't want to make it sound like I 
was lying or anything. (Sworn P=lice Statement of 3/15/05).
