Cases cu=rently in IRS Appeals are not directly affected by the suspension, since t=e IRS Appeals Office is not 
under the jurisdiction of the SBSE division. It is possible that cases currently in Appeals may b= settled in Appeals. 
However, if the taxpayer and the Appeals Officer are =ware of the suspension, they may choose to suspend the Appeal 
pending the =ssuance of future guidance. We understand that SBSE may inform the Appeals Office of the 
suspension.</=> 
Clear=and Precise Guidance Standard =/span> 
Copies o= the documents referenced below analyzing this issue are available on the =BAA web site. In particular, 
the industry response provided to the Chief Counsel's Office explains that the U.S. Supreme =ourt in Central Illinois 
Public Service Co. v. U.S. <https://maps.google.com/?==U.S.,+435+U.S.+21&entry=gmail&source=g> , 435 U.S. 21 (1978), 
held, with respect to payroll tax withholdings, that a company that is required to collect=a tax (a "deputy tax collector") 
can only be held liable for unc=llected tax if published legal authority provided clear and precise guidan=e regarding the 
deputy tax collector's obligation to collect the tax. Published court cases do not discuss whether this case=applies in the 
context of FET. However, because management companies appea= to be deputy tax collectors required (according to 
the IRS auditors) to c=llect FET on amounts paid by the aircraft owners, it would appear to follow that management 
companies can o=ly be held liable for uncollected FET if published legal guidance met this=clear and precise standard. 
As noted=below, the sole reason for opening a guidance project on the issue is that=the existing published legal 
authority does not provide clear guidance. Accordingly, it would seem that management compani=s have a fairly 
straightforward argument that (a) they can only be liable =or failure to collect FET if the published legal guidance 
regarding their =ollection responsibility is clear and precise, and (b) the suspension of assessments and opening of a 
guidan=e project effectively concedes that existing guidance regarding owner flig=ts does not meet this standard. Based 
on this and other arguments, managem=nt companies with cases in Appeals may prefer to continue to work with 
Appeals to resolve their cases.=u> 
Manageme=t companies that are currently under audit and are considering the effect =f the suspension on their 
case should consider that the clear and precise guidance standard requires that such guidance e=ist at the time that the 
deputy tax collector was required to collect the =ax. Therefore, if the clear and precise standard applies, regulations 
issu=d in the future cannot retroactively provide clear and precise guidance to prior periods when the tax was not 
c=llected. 
Backg=ound Meetings Leading Up to the Suspension on Assessments 
The susp=nsion on assessments and the IRS's tentative commitment to initiate a =uidance project on this issue is 
the result of a series of meetings between NBAA representatives and the IRS over the past five ye=rs. The following 
briefly summarizes this effort: 
• 
=C2 In 2008, the IRS issued an Audit Technique Guide suggesting that per=orming aircraft management 
services would result in the management company=having possession, command, and control of the aircraft. 
• 
=C2 During the period 2008 to 2011, NBAA representatives met with IRS re=resentatives several times 
and provided written memoranda regarding the is=ue with the intention of cooperatively developing guidance in an 
Industry Directive. 
• 
=C2 In the Summer of 2011, NBAA representatives met with representatives=of IRS to discuss the issue. 
At this meeting, the IRS seemed committed to =orking with industry on the issue. 
• 
=C2 However, the IRS then requested guidance from the IRS Chief Counsel&=39;s Office on the issue, 
and in March 2012, CCA 201210026 was issued indi=ating that management services companies have possession, 
command, and control of managed aircraft, unless their services were perfo=med in the capacity of an agent of the 
owner. 
• 
=C2 Following the issuance of this CCA, the IRS aggressively increased a=dits of managed aircraft. 
• 
=C2 In April and June 2012, NBAA representatives met with the IRS Chief =ounsel's Office and provided 
a written industry response to the CCA.
