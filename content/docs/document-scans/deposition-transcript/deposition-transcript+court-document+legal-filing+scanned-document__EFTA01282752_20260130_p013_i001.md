(i) 
Statement. On or as soon as reasonably practicable following the occurrence of an Early 
Termination Date, each party will make the calculations on its pan, if any, contemplated by Section 6(e) and 
will provide to the other party a statement (I) showing, in reasonable detail, such calculations (including any 
quotations, market data or information from internal sources used in making such calculations). 
(2) specifying (except where there are two Affected Panics) any Early Termination Amount payable and 
(3) giving derails of the relevant account to which any amount payable to it is to be paid. In the absence of 
written confirmation from the source of a quotation or market data obtained in determining a Close-out 
Amount, the records of the party obtaining such quotation or market data will be conclusive evidence of the 
existence and accuracy of such quotation or market data. 
(ii) 
Payment Date. An Early Termination Amount due in respect of any Early Termination Date will, 
together with any amount of interest payable pursuant to Section 9(h)(ii)(2), be payable (1) on the day on 
which notice of the amount payable is effective in the case of an Early Termination Date which is designated 
or occurs as a result of an Event of Default and (2) on the day which is two Local Business Days after the 
day on which notice of the amount payable is effective (or, if there are two Affected Parties, after the day on 
which the statement provided pursuant to clause (i) above by the second party to provide such a statement is 
effective) in the case of an Early Termination Date which is designated as a result of a Termination Event. 
(c) 
Payments on Early Termination. If an Early Termination Date occurs. the amount, if any, payable in 
respect of that Early Termination Date (the "Early Termination Amount') will be determined pursuant to this 
Section 6(e) and will be subject to Section 6(f). 
(i) 
Events of Default If the Early Termination Date results from an Event of Default, the Early 
Termination Amount will be an amount equal to (I) the sum of (A) the Termination Currency Equivalent of 
the Close-out Amount or Close-out Amounts (whether positive or negative) determined by the Non-
defaulting Party for each Terminated Transaction or group of Terminated Transactions, as the case may be, 
and (B) the Termination Currency Equivalent of the Unpaid Amounts owing to the Non-defaulting Party less 
(2) the Termination Currency Equivalent of the Unpaid Amounts owing to the Defaulting Party. If the Early 
Termination Amount is a positive number, the Defaulting Party will pay it to the Non-defaulting Party; if it 
is a negative number, the Non-defaulting Party will pay the absolute value of the Early Termination Amount 
to the Defaulting Party. 
(ii) 
Termination Events. If the Early Termination Date results from a Termination Event:—
(1) 
One Affected Parry. Subject to clause (3) below, if there is one Affected Party, the Early 
Termination Amount will be determined in accordance with Section 6(eXi), except that references 
to the Defaulting Party and to the Non-defaulting Party will be deemed to be references to the 
Affected Pasty and to the Non-affected Party, respectively. 
(2) 
Two Affected Panics. Subject to clause (31 below, if there are two Affected Parties, each 
party will determine an amount equal to the Termination Currency Equivalent of the sum of the 
Close-out Amount or Close-out Amounts (whether positive of negative) for each Terminated 
Transaction or group of Terminated Transactions, as the case may be, and the Early Termination 
Amount will be an amount equal to (A) the sum of (1) one-half of the difference between the higher 
amount so determined (by party "X") and the lower amount so determined (by party "Y") and 
OD the Termination Currency Equivalent of the Unpaid Amounts owing to X less (B) the 
Termination Currency Equivalent of the Unpaid Amounts owing to Y. If the Early Termination 
Amount is a positive number, Y will pay it to X: if it is a negative number, X will pay the absolute 
value of the Early Termination Amount to Y.
