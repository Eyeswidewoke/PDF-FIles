> You are waiting for me to provide guidance as to how you can regain co=trol of the 
trust funds. My plan is to prepare a memo for you outlin=ng your options in light of the trust terms. I anticipate being 
able=to spend some time on this over the weekend, along with reviewing the draf=s of your estate planning documents. 
Once I have sent the memo to yo= we can discuss your thoughts and we can then respond to Max. Unfortunatel= this is 
a difficult situation, not simple and straightforward, because of=the terms of the trust and fiduciary law applicable to 
trusts. Pleas= see my email of 10/17 for an explanation of some of the issues. 
> In some situations a trust is drafted so that you would have the right=to remove and 
replace the trustee, and in doing so perhaps find a trustee =hat would not inquire so diligently as to your personal 
financial circumst=nces before making a principal distribution to you. In this regard, =lease refer to my email of 10/17 
where I summarize the trustee removal, re=ignation and appointment provisions. The trustees can both resign at any 
t=me. They appoint successors subject to your approval. If they agree to res=gn you can find a new independent trustee 
whom they can appoint. If not, y=u can remove them but only with the approval of a majority of your childre=. Do you 
think your daughters would agree to remove Max and Harry? If so y=u could then appoint a successor. You would need 
to find an independent tr=stee. I can help you craft a letter to your daughters if you think t=ey might agree to do this. 
> My one additional thought right now that I need to review more closely=is that Harry, 
not being the independent trustee, should not have a say in=the distribution decision. If there is nothing in the trust to 
contradict =his interpretation (I need to review the trust again) then Max alone has t=e power. However this would likely 
not change the analysis that Max believ=s he needs to go through since he is accountable to all beneficiaries..=A0 He 
believes he needs some level of financial information from you but i= my view that does not need to be detailed. I can 
discuss with him w=at level of detail would satisfy him; however, if my understanding is corr=ct that you do not wish to 
provide him with any backup for his distributio= decision, then we should evaluate the removal option and any other 
strate=ies I may be able to come up with. 
> Unfortunately this is not a simple situation and I will do my best to =utline some 
additional options for you. In the meantime please let me know=your thoughts regarding the above. I am available for a 
call as well= at your convenience. 
> Best,

with you and I also feel I cannot have such a discussion wit= you without Deborah's knowledge and participation, as she 
is your att=rney. Please also note that any distributions from the trusts would =Iso involve Harry, who is the co-trustee 
of the trusts.

with a meeting or a call when I return, next week.
