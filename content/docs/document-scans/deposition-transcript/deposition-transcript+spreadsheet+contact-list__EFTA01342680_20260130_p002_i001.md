A NOTE ON AZIMUTH: The azimuth listed is the center compass degree facing of the identified sector of the tower. Generally, the 
coverage of a tower is circular and divided in three equal pieces (each 120 degrees wide). Due north is 0, due south is 180. However, 
not every tower is aligned with the first sector starting at 0. Using the listed azimuth, rough direction from the tower can be 
calculated for a call. The center degree of the sector's facing is indicated in this field. For example, if a facing has a listed orientation 
of 90, the center of the coverage is pointed at 90 degrees but the sector will cover traffic from roughly 60 degrees on either side 
(thus 30 to 150 degrees in this example).
