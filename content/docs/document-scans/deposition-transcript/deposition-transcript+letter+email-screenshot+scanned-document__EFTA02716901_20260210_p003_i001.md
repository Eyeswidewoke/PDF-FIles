=p class="MsoNormal">Above are some of the faces of unarmed people of colo= who were killed by police. Included 
are seven year old Aiyana Jones, Tamir Rice, 12, Andy Lopez, 1=, DeAunta Farrow, 12 and Rumain Brisbon, 34, an 
unarmed black father of four who was shot=to death in when a police officer apparently mistook his bottle of pills for a 
gun. =/span> 
This latest confrontati=n was last Saturday when 33 year-old Officer Michael T. Slager reportedly pulled over 50 year-old 
Walter Scott because o= a broken taillight. It escalated into a foot chase as Scott allegedly fled because there were 
family court-issued warrants for his arrest. Slage= pursued Scott into a grassy lot and claimed that he fired his Taser to 
subdue him. Moments later, Slager reported on his radio, "Shots fired and th= subject is down. He took my Taser." 
Earlier this week, an attorney for Slager said the cop felt threatened after Scott tried to overpower him and take his 
Taser. But images in the video ar= of Stager shooting at Scott as he runs away from him. The video also shows Slager 
dropping a Taser near Scott after he was gunned dow=. Obviously Officer Slager lied. Thank God there was a passerb= 
videoing the incident, otherwise most people would have taken Slager's word. Officer=was arrested on Tuesday, April 7, 
2015. By the way: Based on the=latest estimates by the U.S. Justice Department, you are SO times likely t= be killed by a 
police officer than a terrorist in the United States. And for African Americans that number grows exponentially. 
Something is =/span>defini=ely wrong

No You Didn't Governor Scott? 
Florida Gov. =ick Scott (R) is a climate change skeptic. 
=span style="font-size:l2pt;line-height:107%">When I recently read this h=adline while trolling Huffington Post which is 
part of my daily ritual I had to stop — Florida Offic=als Were Barred From Using The Term 'Climate Change' Once Rick 
Scott Took Power 41=93 because I was sure that I misread the headline until I actually read Amanda Terkel's a=ticle. I 
don't know whether it is stubbornness or stupidness or both, but there has to be something in the water =n Florida if 
the voters and media in the state don't realize that this is a problem. =ecause there is a universal agreement among the 
international scientific community that there is climate change and that the =span style="font-size:l6px;line-
height:17.1200008392334px">man-made release of carbon emissions has made this worse. So what is up with 
Governor =ick Scott? 
So why were the officials responsible for making sure Florida is pr=pared to respond to the earth's changing climate are 
barred from using the terms=i> "global warming" and "climate change" in=official communications, emails and reports, 
according to new findings from the Flor=da Center for Investigative Reporting? "We were told that we wer= not allowed 
to discuss anything that was not a true fact," said Kristina Trott=, a former Florida Department of Environmental 
Protection employee. Another for=er employee added, "We were dealing with the effects and economic impact of 
climate change, and yet we can'= reference it."
