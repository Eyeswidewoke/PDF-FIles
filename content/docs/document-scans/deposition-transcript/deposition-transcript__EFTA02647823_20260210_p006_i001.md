True. I have no =xcuses. The only thing I can tell you is that I'm trying to do 
better =y learning from my mistakes in order to not repeat them. I've waisted =y time by going to parties instead of 
being serious. Everything was confus=d in my mind and I didn't really know what path to take, it's very=easy to get lost 
when you are young, specially into fake illusions. Still =ow, I'm trying to understand myself and who I am. I believe it 
takes t=me and it's different from person to person. Now little by little I Hve started to focus more. I'm starting to 
understand real life, what =re my priorities and things that really matter. Here are some actual facts= I've started to 
earn some money ( which I've never did befo=e ) which I believe it's already a small accomplishment. I did some 
ba=ysitting and after 2 paid trial days ( 250 euros per day ) shooting for Vo=ue and Dior, I've got hired by one of the best 
fashion photographers c=lled Paolo Roversi to be his assistant ( paid job ). I'm very happy an= excited to work and learn 
from him which is better than any photography s=hool. I'm ready to work as long as I need to in order to build my skil=s 
and stand out in that field. I think I've achieved some results and =ained some value if I compare myself 2 years ago from 
now. Thanks to you l=had the possibility to make many interesting experiences like Ferragamo in=China and Alaia in 
Paris. Even though I didn't get hired from the=, those experiences allowed me to understand what I like and what I 
don Ht like and shaped in part the person I am. Thanks to the Alaia inter=ship and my passion for photography I am 
now working with Paolo Roversi do=ng what I really like. However even though I work hard and I am paid I can=ot fully 
support myself to pay a rent and my living in Paris. I really wou=d like to continue through this path, I feel it's the right 
one but I =eed your help, your support and your advices because I cannot make it by m=self. 
I promise I will use my money wisely without throwin= it away into futilities like 
parties and holidays because I want to grow =nd build my skills, my carrier and hopefully my future self.
