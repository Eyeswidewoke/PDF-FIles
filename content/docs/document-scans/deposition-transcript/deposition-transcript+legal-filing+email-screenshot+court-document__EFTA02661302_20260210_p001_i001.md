Re: Marital Trust 
You might add that if they feel a lawyer can explain= the mutual release you have one that will sign off

I'm glad that you find=the idea interesting and think that you might consider it, though you have=to consult 
lawyers first. 
My own view is different. T= me the proposal I suggested seems to be a very simple way of settling thi= matter, 
which to me is extremely troubling. I realize that this is =ust another case of a longstanding difference in the way we 
approach these=problems, a difference that has been clear ever since we were discussing t=e interest on the loan from 
the Trust and found that we could not communic=te because I mistakenly assumed that it was a discussion among 
family memb=rs while your letters made it very clear and explicit that you saw it as a=legal issue to be settled among 
lawyers and Bainco, perhaps with a mediato= in the adversary proceeding. All matters I find it very hard to com=rehend, 
and to live with, but so be it. 
So by all means con=ult with your lawyer, or perhaps a battery of lawyers, to make sure that y=ur interests are 
properly protected. I don't need any lawyer'=s advice. The matter is perfectly clear and straightforward. 5= there is no 
reason for me to hire a lawyer to deal with the question and =o have a lawyer contact yours and initiate a discussion in 
which we all pa=ticipate. 
The matter is very simple. We can proceed w=thout delay if you agree to settle the issue in the simple manner 
that I s=ggested. 
As for your proposals in your letter of March 29, =s I wrote you, the letter was so shocking that it was hard for 
me to bring=myself to respond, but I did, in detail, but decided not to send it. =Perhaps I should. Will think about it. 
As for your pr=posals, my response was the obvious one. I'm sorry for the stres= you had to endure, but your 
efforts were a waste of time for reasons I ha= already fully explained before you undertook them. As I'm sure =ou recall, 
a few years ago, I requested tax payments from the marital trus= when my IRA was being rapidly depleted by my 
advisers who were distributi=g half to family and using the other half to pay management fees and taxes=for the entire 
estate, so that to pay Alex's medical expenses and the =xpenses for Wellfleet I had to withdraw excess funds with 
exorbitant taxes= all that before withdrawing even a cent to live on again with exorbitant =axes. Your response was to 
refuse the request unless I agreed to int=usive and insulting financial investigations -- of a kind I never consider=d when 
providing funds to you for something you needed. I made it cl=ar and explicit at the time that I would not submit to this 
procedure. =AO Since your efforts and proposals simply repeat the same procedure, they=were a waste of time. 
There were some things in your letter=that were correct. You're right that despite what has happened, ='m still 
a "wealthy man," with income well above the median,=though lacking a pension and accumulated property, not at the 
level of my =eers. Furthermore, I can supplement my income by teaching large unde=graduate courses, something I'd 
never done and that is not that common=for people approaching 90, but something that I enjoy. And you too a=e a 
wealthy man, for the same reasons: the reasons are that I've worke= hard all my life, lived fairly simply (and live even
