(c) 
Tax Provisions. 
(I) ISDA 2010 Short Form HIRE Act Protocol. The parties agree that solely as between Party 
A and Party B, the definitions and provisions contained in the ISDA 2010 Short Form HIRE 
Act Protocol published by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. on 
November 30, 2010, including the Attachment thereto ("Short Form Protocol"), will be 
deemed to be incorporated herein mutatis mutandis, as though such definitions and 
provisions were set out in full herein, with any such conforming changes as are necessary to 
deal with what would otherwise be inappropriate or incorrect cross references. The parties 
further agree that the Implementation Date (as such term is defined in the Short Form 
Protocol) shall be the date of execution of this Agreement. 
(2) Withholding Tax imposed on payments to non-US counterparties under the United 
States Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act. "Tax" as used in Part 2(a) of this Schedule 
(Payer Tax Representation) and "Indemnifiable Tax" as defined in Section 14 of this 
Agreement shall not include any U.S. federal withholding tax imposed or collected pursuant 
to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the 
"Code"), any current or future regulations or official interpretations thereof, any agreement 
entered into pursuant to Section 1471(b) of the Code, or any fiscal or regulatory legislation, 
rules or practices adopted pursuant to any intergovernmental agreement entered into in 
connection with the implementation of such Sections of the Code (a "FATCA Withholding 
Tax"). For the avoidance of doubt, a FATCA Withholding Tax is a Tax the deduction or 
withholding of which is required by applicable law for the purposes of Section 2(d) of this 
Agreement. 
(d) 
Party B Representations and Acknowledgements, Non-Reliance, Etc. 
Party B hereby 
represents, warrants and acknowledges to Party A as of the date of this Agreement and will be 
deemed to represent to Party A on the date that Party B enters into a Transaction that (absent a 
written agreement between the parties that expressly imposes affirmative obligations to the 
contrary for that Transaction) that: 
(i) Party B understands that (x) that Transactions may at times be volatile and are subject to 
complex and substantial risks that may arise without warning and (y) losses in value for 
Party B's position in that Transactions may occur quickly and in unanticipated magnitude. 
(ii) Party A has made no representations, guarantees, or assurances whatsoever as to the 
expected or projected profitability, return, success, performance result, effect, consequence 
or benefit (whether legal, regulatory, tax, financial, accounting or otherwise) of that 
Transaction. Party B will be relying upon its own judgment and its own advisors with 
respect to that Transaction and Party B has not sought and is not relying on any views of 
Party A with respect to that Transaction. All terms of, and the documentation evidencing, 
this Agreement and that Transaction have been the result of arm's-length negotiations 
between the parties. 
(iii)Party A shall not be liable to Party B for any losses, costs, expenses, fees, charges, 
amounts, liabilities, claims, damages, penalties, interest, taxes, or fines associated with that 
Transaction, including the failure of that Transaction to achieve Party B's legal, regulatory, 
tax, business, investment, financial, or accounting objectives, other than Party A's own 
gross negligence and/or willful misconduct.
