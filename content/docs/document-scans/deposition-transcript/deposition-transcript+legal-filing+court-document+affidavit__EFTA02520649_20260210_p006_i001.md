<=pan style="font-size:10.5pt;font-family:Calibri,sans-serir>My name is A=am Waldman, and I 
am Professor Lawrence Krauss' litigation counsel= Earlier this week, I sent the attached letter to Buzzfeed via one o= 
their reporters named Peter Aldhous. 
I am also in receipt of Mr. Aldhous' le=ter to ASU, which is a variation on defamation — both libel 
and sl=nder — that Mr. Aldhous and his colleagues have been manufacturing=for at least 6 months (notably without any 
reporting) in a campaign with a=purpose known only to them. Buzzfeed's first method is to ca=l or write third parties, 
posit a list of fake, anonymous, recklessly fals= and malicious "allegations," and ask if the third party h=s anything to 
add. Buzzfeed's second method is to seek torti=us interference with Professor Krauss' professional contracts, by =riting 
third parties with whom Professor Krauss is in privity, present a s=milarly inflammatory series of anonymous, recklessly 
false and malicious a=cusations, and then question: how can the email's recipient allow =uch a person to serve on their 
board, or speak at their conference? =he letter from Buzzfeed to the University falls into both categories. Ther= will be 
appropriate legal consequences for Buzzfeed's actions. =AO 
It is my understandi=g that your office believes it is compelled by the above to investigate fa=se, 
defamatory, anonymous accusations posited by the online tabloid Buzzfe=d by contacting third parties and potentially 
rebroadcasting the tabloid B=zzfeed's accusations. To be clear, these accusations were no= made to the University by 
actual human beings who are alleging they were =ictims. There is no evidence they were presented to Buzzfeed by 
actu=l human beings. Moreover, no present or former employees of ASU have made =ny such allegations to your office, 
or to any office at ASU, to our knowle=ge. They are simply alleged by a tabloid, and one that had yet published a="story" 
on the topic when they forwarded these to you. =ou may propose to rebroadcast this tabloid's libel to other third 
part=es who have also made no accusation against Professor Krauss. I sugg=st that you consult with the University's 
counsel before taking so=rash a step as re-broadcasting hearsay defamation that came to you via an =nline tabloid 
under these circumstances. 
<=iv> 
Professor Krauss and I both recognize the absolute need t= investigate real allegations. Some of 
the women who have bravely co=e forward with personal harassment allegations against Harvey Weinstein ar= my 
clients and friends. Some of these victims have been advised by =e. Those actual allegations are entirely distinct from a 
tabloid att=mpting to manufacture allegations to create harm. <=u> 
Sincerely, 
Adam Waldman
