On November 21, 2005, I met with ASA 
Atty. Donnie 
1 and 
Juan and Maria Alessi at the State Attorney Office. ASA 
had 
requested a court reporter to be present to take the statement of the 
Alessi s. I spoke with Maria Alessi, in the presence of her attorney, 
Donnie Murrell. She advised she had worked for Epstein for eight 
years, from the period of 1994 through 2002. She advised she had 
never had any direct conversations with him. She stated it was her 
husband who spoke directly with Epstein. Her work consisted of doing 
house cleaning, shopping and other preparations when Epstein would 
arrive in town. Alessi stated the preparations consisted of preparing 
the house and bathrooms for his arrival. She advised she did view 
several masseuses that arrived at the house. She advised that two or 
three girls would come during a day and provide the massages. The 
girls that arrived looked young in age. Mrs. Alessi did not know any 
of the girls personally and were always different. She was told that 
when Epstein was in residence, he did not want to encounter the Alessis 
during his stay in Palm Beach. 
I then spoke with Mr. Alessi in the presence of his attorney, Donnie 
Murrell. Mr. Alessi stated that he was employed for eleven years.with 
Mr. Epstein. He originally was hired as a part time employee and then 
moved up into a full time position. His duties included everything. 
Alessi stated he was the house manager, driver and house maintenance 
person. It was his responsibility to prepare the house for Epstein s 
arrival. When asked about cooks or assistants, Alessi stated they 
traveled with Epstein on his private plane. He remembered dealing 
with his girlfriend, Ms. Maxwell originally and then dealt with 
Epstein directly. 
I asked Mr. Alessi about massages that occurred within the home. Mr. 
Alessi stated Mr. Epstein had up to three massages a day. Each 
masseuse that visited the house was different. Alessi stated that 
towards the end of his employment, the masseuses were younger and 
younger. When asked how young, Mr. Alessi stated they appeared to be 
sixteen or seventeen years of age at the most. The massages would 
occur in Epstein's bedroom or bathroom. There were times he recalled 
that he would set up the massage tables either in Epstein s bedroom or 
in his bathroom. I asked if there were things going on other than a 
massage. Alessi stated that there were times towards the end of his 
employment that he would have to wash off a massager/vibrator and a 
long rubber penis, which were in the sink after the massage. 
Additionally, he stated the bed would almost always have to be made 
after the massage. Alessi was never privy to what went on during the
