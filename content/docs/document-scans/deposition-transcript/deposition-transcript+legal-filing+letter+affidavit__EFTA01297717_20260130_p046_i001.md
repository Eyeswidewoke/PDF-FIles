OPINION BY: JED S. RAKOFF 
OPINION 
MEMORANDUM ORDER 
JED S. RAKOFF. U.S.D.J. 
L.A.W. Limitless. LLC ("LAW") petitions the Court to compel arbitration of LAW's contractual disputes with Fr. 
Lurssen Waft (GMBH) Co. ("Lurssen"). On January 19, 1999. the parties were orally advised that the Court would 
grant the petition. This Memorandum Order will formally confirm that advice and briefly state the reasons therefor. 
By a writing dated June 18, 1993 (the "Construction Agreement"), Lurssen contracted with one Jeffrey Epstein to 
construct a luxury yacht for a corporation to be later designated (which turned out to be LAW). Section 23 of the 
Construction Agreement provided that any dispute "arising out of or relating to this Agreement" was to be referred to 
athitration. Clause 23.3 of that section stated that "The parties agree to designate and appoint a sole Arbitrator ... not 
later than sixty (60) days after execution I•2I of this Agreement.' 
The sixty-day period came and went without either party proposing an arbitrator. Nonetheless. construction of the yacht 
went forward. On March 27. 1997. with construction virtually complete. the relevant parties entered into a further 
agreement (the "Assumption Agreement") specifying LAW as the Epstein-designated corporation that would assume his 
responsibilities under the Construction Agreement and take delivery of the yacht. Among other things. the Assumption 
Agreement specifically and expressly reaffirmed Clause 23 of the Construction Agreement -- without, however. making 
any. reference to the parties' failure thus far to designate an arbitrator. 
Shortly after taking delivery of the yacht. LAW notified Lassen of alleged defects in the delivered product; but Lurssen 
rejected these claims. On March 25. 1998. LAW proposed arbitration of these disputes. By letter dated March 30, 1998 
Lurssen responded by proposing one Robert Walsh "as sole arbitrator" "to act in line with our contract." Affidavit of 
Darren K. Indyke, dated November 30. 1998, Exhibit F. No specific arbitrator was agreed upon however, before the 
relationship between the parties grew acrimonious j•31 and the discussions ceased. 
By letter dated October 16, 1998. Lurssen. for the rust time, took tlx position that LAW had waived its right to arbitrate 
the disputes over the alleged deficiencies in the yacht because LAW had failed to propose an arbitrator within 60 days 
of the execution of the Construction Agreement. By letter dated November 10, 1998. Lurssen went still further and 
claimed that LAW was without any contractual remedy whatever for the alleged deficiencies because, having agreed 
(directly or through its contractual predecessor Epstein) that all contractual disputes must be submitted to arbitration, it 
had failed to preserve that right by proposing an arbitrator before the 60-day deadline. In response. LAW commenced 
this action. 
Quite aside from the inequity of Lurssen's position, it has no basis in law. Specifically, under New York law (which 
governs the contract here in issue), 0. 01Wconditions precedent to otherwise obligatory arbitration requirements arc not 
favored and arc not to be found where, as here, they arc not clearly evinced by the contract. Sec e.g., De Vito v. 
Hempstead China Shop, 38 F.3d 651.654; Irving Trust Corporation v. Nationwide Leisure Corporation, (4141 711 F. 
Supp. 166. 168 (S.D.N.Y. 1989); Toyomcnka Pacific Petroletun, Inc. v. Hess Oil Virgin Islands Corp., 771 F. Supp. 63. 
67 (S.D.N.Y. 1991); Oppenheimer & Co. v. Oppenheitn, Appel. Dixon, & Co., 86 N.Y.2d 685, 691, 660 N.E.2d 415, 
636 N.Y.S.2d 734 (Ct. App. 1995): Uniroyal. Inc. v. Heller. 65 F.R.D. 83, 93 (S.D.N.Y. 1974). Here, nothing in the 
plain language of Section 23 suggests that the panics regarded compliance with the 60-day selection period as a 
necessary condition precedent to binding arbitration failure to comply with which would waive all contractual 
remedies. See In re Salomon Inc. Shareholders' Derivative Litigation 68 F.3d 554, 560 (2d Cir. 1995) (.1" 21% 
"mechanical breakdown," such as "a lapse in time in naming of the arbitrator? is immaterial). This is in notable contrast 
to other sections of the Construction Agreement. such as Section 24. where the contract effectively states that failure to 
meet certain other deadlines is material and dispositive. 
Moreover. far from making a party's failure to timely designate an arbitrator a waiver of its right to arbitrate. Section 23 
provides in effect a procedure for selection of an arbitrator in the event the deadline lapses. Specifically. 
Clause I*51 23.1 states that 'The Arbitration shall be conducted in New York City under the rules of the Society of 
Maritime Arbitrators ("Maritirne Rules")." and waSection 10 of the Maritime Rules provides that "if a party fails to 
appoint its Arbitrator within the time frame specified in the arbitration agreement, the party demanding arbitration may 
resort to waTSection 5 of (the Federal Arbitration Act. 9 U.S.C. a 1. et seq.)." which provides that "if a method (for 
selecting an arbitrator) be provided (by contract) and any party shall fail to avail himself of such method, or if for any
