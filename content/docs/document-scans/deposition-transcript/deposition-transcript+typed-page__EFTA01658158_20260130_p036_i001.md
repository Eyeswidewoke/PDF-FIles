The Hill (7/26, Coleman, 2.98M) reports that in an interview with ABC's This WeekVI Sunday, 
Chief of Staff Meadows defended US COVID-19 testing on Sunday "amid criticism over the 
delays to receive results." Asked by host George Stephanopoulos what the White House's plan 
is to fix testing, Meadows "said the country is testing more than 1 million people every day, and 
that additional quick testing at nursing homes, long-term care facilities, schools, health care 
providers and child care `may help." Meadows said, "But when we look at the regime that we've 
got, we're testing more than any other country in the world. ... Other countries, all they do is 
test when you come to the hospital. We're finding more cases because we're testing more, but, 
indeed, what we need to do is make sure that we focus on those nursing homes, long-term care 
so that we can bring that death count down because those are the ones that are most at risk." 
Azar Blames States For Testing Delays. Politico (7/26, Roubein, 4.29M) reports that 
on CBS' Face The NationVi Sunday, HHS Secretary Azar "blamed the current delays in 
coronavirus testing on the states, which he said have been too slow to spend federal dollars to 
boost the country's testing amid the virus's spread." Azar said, "Our governors have to take 
that initiative and get their public health labs fully up and running." Politico adds that Azar "said 
that public health labs are running at 58 percent capacity, and claimed the federal government 
is meeting every need for supplies and testing." Azar "put the onus on the states to boost this." 
He said, "We're certainly talking to the governors and telling them that they've got to use this 
money to get up and running." 
On CNN's State Of The UnionVI (7/26, 830K), Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) took a 
different view. Hogan argued, "The real need right now is on ramping up a robust testing 
program because we're starting to with the spikes around the country, you know, see waits of 
ten days or more in some of these states that are actually affecting states like ours that aren't 
having a big problem but it's slowing down the testing at the national labs and I think that is 
something that the federal government has really got to focus on. Instead last week, the 
President was talking about cutting funding for testing programs." 
Giroir Says He Is Unhappy With Testing Turnaround Times. The Washington 
Examiner (7/26, Leonardi, 448K) reports HHS Assistant Secretary for Health Adm. Brett Giroir 
said on CNN's State Of The UnionVi that "he's not content with the coronavirus test turnaround 
time." Giroir "told [host lake Tapper] he's unhappy with the time it takes for test results to 
come back after hearing that former chief of staff Mick Mulvaney's son waited five to seven 
days for results." Asked why testing is "not where it needs to be," Giroir said, "We are not going 
to stop our efforts until testing is exactly where we want it to be with rapid turnaround times. 
... About one-quarter of the tests in this country are done as point-of-care. That's a 15-minute 
turnaround. About another quarter are done at local hospitals and laboratories, which is 
generally within 24 hours. The delays that most people talk about are at the large commercial 
labs that perform about half the testing in our country. Now, the data are the average 
turnaround is 4.27 days. ... I'm never gonna be happy until we have this under control." 
Politico (7/26, Roubein, 4.29M) reports Giroir "said that anyone who needs' a coronavirus 
test can get one," but he "didn't define what `need' meant." Politico adds that "some testing 
sites across the country are prioritizing people who are already sick, even as schools and 
businesses will need more quick testing as they reopen." 
Meadows Expects "Good News" On Therapeutics And Vaccine In Coming Weeks. 
The New York Post (7/26, Nelson, 4.57M) reports Chief of Staff Meadows told ABC's This Week 
Vi Sunday that he is "hopeful" that an announcement on new COVID-19 treatments will be 
coming within days. Meadows said, "We're hopeful that, with some of the breakthrough 
technology on therapeutics, that we will be able to announce some new therapies in the coming 
days." While he "did not elaborate on what the new therapies may be," Meadows repeated later 
in the interview, "I'm hopeful that, in the next couple of days, that we will have some very good 
news on the therapeutic and vaccine fronts, as we try to address this China virus."
