Let me know what you think 
Please find attached our most recent thoughts on the 2016 global outlook. Despite recent market volatility, we remain 
constructive on both the markets and economic growth overall: 
• 
Recent market volatility, combined with further oil price declines, has raised fears that global growth could slow 
this year. 
• 
We believe that the markets' fears are overdone. Our global 2016 growth forecast remains constructive at now 
3.4% (reduced from 3.5% due to weakness in single emerging markets). This is based on an-already conservative Chinese 
GDP growth forecast (6%) and broadly-unchanged views on the U.S. economy. 
• 
We continue to believe that a low oil price will have a positive net effect on consumption of oil importing 
countries but remain concerned about its impact on inflation and central banks' responses to this. 
• 
We also acknowledge that, were volatility to prove prolonged or get worse, then the global economy would be 
vulnerable. 
We have included supplementary research pieces that more specifically address the sources of volatility in the market. If 
you wish to discuss where we see opportunity in current markets, we will be happy to schedule a call. Additional pieces 
include: 
• 
FX Outlook - Our global FX research team outlines their expectations for major currencies around the world, 
which centers on their thesis of ongoing USD strength. 
• 
Focus Europe — Chief Economist Mark Wall dives into the risks of a slowdown in euro-area growth, primarily 
driven by an external demand shock and a deflationary shock. 
• 
Weekly Highlights - Larry Adam, our US WM CIO & Chief Investment Strategist, gives an overview of major 
global asset classes and touches on the unlikelihood of a US recession.
