Revenue Sharing 
Advisers. distributors or other affiliates of certain mutual funds (with 
include money market and non-money market funds) may enter into 
arrangements to pay brokers that distribute their shares for administrative, 
technokrgicat or other services, including marketing and other support services 
provided to such funds or their affiliates. These fees, commonly referred to as 
'revenue sharing: are separate from and in addition to any shareholder 
servicing or distribution fees that a mutual fund pays out of its own assets 
pursuant to its Rule 12b-1 plan and other expenses which are described in a 
hinds prospectus fee table. Rule 12b1 fees and Other expenses described in 
a fund's prospectus fee table increase a fund's expense ratio and decrease the 
fund's yield. Revenue sharing fees, on the other hand, are paid cm of the 
assets of the fund affiliate and not from the fund's assets and. therefore, have 
no impact on a fund's expense ratio or yield. 
With respect to money market funds. Bear Stearns negotiates revenue sharing 
payments separately with each fund family and not all fund families pay the 
same amount cc pay according to the same formula. These payments are 
calculated based on a percentage of the dollar value of the fund assets held by 
Bear Steams in customer accounts. Bear Steams receives up to 0.66% per 
year of the average daily assets of fund shares carried in customers' accounts 
at Bear Stearns. Money market funds whose affiliates do not make revenue 
sharing payments to Bear Stearns are generally not offered or recommended 
by Bear Stearns to its customers.

LAST STATPAINT 
August 31.2006 
These money market funds may in some cases have higher yields than money 
market funds whose affiliates do make revenue sharing payments. There is. 
therefore. a potential conflict of interest in the form of an additional financial 
Incentive to Bear Steams for making available to customers money market 
funds whose affiliates enter into revenue sharing arrangements. In certain 
circumstances, a portion of these revenue sharing payments may be passed 
on as compensation to certain Private Client Services account executives. 
With respect to non-money market fund shares held in Bear Steams 
accounts. Bear Steams may receive Rule 12b-1 fees and other compensation 
described in a fund's prospectus but does not receive revenue sharing 
payments. With respect to nowmoney market fund shares held by certain 
Private Client Services customers away from Bear Steams, Bear Steams does 
receive revenue sharing payments in limited circumstances. A potion of those 
revenue sharing payments are passed on as compensation to the Private 
Client Services account executive designated by the customer. Bear Stearns 
does not believe that these revenue sharing arrangements involving such 
Private dent Services customers pose a conflict of interest with respect to 
customers whose accounts are held at Bear Steams. 
The prospectus and statement of additional information of mutual funds 
available through Bear Steams may contain additional information regarding 
revenue sharing payments made by affiliates of the fund company.
