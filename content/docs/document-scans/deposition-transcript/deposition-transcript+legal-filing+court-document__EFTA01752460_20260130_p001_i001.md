Jeffrey,. 
If I'm lucky, I'll be on St Thomas by 6:45pm Friday which is sunset. Bell needs parts now,. see frustrations 
below,. 
Bell has offered a 5% discount for the parts I require if I purchase from Bell: I have not told them to order parts 
until I hear from other suppliers on Monday,. unless you tell me to order from Bell? 
Lany, 
I did not hear anything from Debbie on another source, but, if Chris quoted list price I will offer a 5% discount... 
You are a valued customer and we appreciate your business and loyalty... 
Kind regards, 
David 
Friday aftemoon Bell sent me the email below, stating they need 5 parts totally $33,700 for corrosion and 
excess wear,. I told Bell that you can't expect me to approve a $33,700 parts without trying to locate pricing from 
other venders? ESPECIALLY AFTER THE HELICOPTER HAS SAT 23 DAYS in their hanger, I have two other 
parts base companies looking into pricing the below items, I will have answer on Monday if other parts are locally 
and better price. Some of Bells pricing and parts are located in Bell's "Singapore parts facifity". 
-Main rotor Yoke Drive pins, 7 needed totaling: $18,949.00 
-Tail Rotor Pitch change links, 4 needed totaling $9,990.00 
-Main rotor yoke bolts $2,256.00 
-Collective Link bolt $1,519.00 
-Main rotor pitch change inks, $1,056.00 
I spoke to David Burch, Bells Manager during this inspection after receiving this email, I told Burch I'm 
dissatisfied with his approach on this annual and all inspection items should have been addressed early in order 
to gets parts as needed in a timely fashion,. This didn't happen due to man power,, As of Friday the helicopter 
as been there 23 days, the shop works an 8 hour day on Saturday, and off on Sunday. 
I will never take this helicopter to him again if you agree. 
Good morning Larry, 
Be assured we will work as diligently as possible in order to meet your timetable as below. 
With that being said we have completed the last of the major inspections and have determined 
a number of components within the main rotor system that will require replacement at this time 
due to corrosion or mechanical damage. In addition the tail rotor pitch links are also 
excessively worn beyond limitations and require replacement. 
Not all of these items are available within the U.S. but of those that are not, they are available 
at our Bell Singapore facility and in order to have the opportunity to meet the revised timetable 
I would be required to order these items AOG as soon as possible today for the earliest 
delivery. Consequently please review the attached estimate and provide a response at your 
earliest convenience. Lastly, two (2) of the main rotor yoke buffer pads are worn to the point of 
requiring replacement however these items are not available until August of this year from any 
Bell location and I have therefore submitted a request to PSE for a temporary repair until such 
time as parts can be procured and have also tasked the parts department to attempt to locate
