supposed to be a response (while avoiding everything I wrote), I already had explained in some detail why your picture is 
incorrect, throughout. I'm sorry that you ignored the letter, but I will repeat the main points below. If you want to sit 
down face-to-face, OK, though I think a conference call would make more sense.</=> 
Before going on, I frankly cannot comprehend why you think this discussion -- in which I respond to you point by point 
and you ignore everything I write -- is necessary or even appropriate. I can appreciate your being concerned about my 
life, just as I'm concerned about yours.=C24> I'd be amazed if it were otherwise. That's natural in a close=knit family. 
Over the years, I've often been seriously concerned about the decisions and choices all of you have made, which 
sometimes seemed questionable or mistaken to me (Mommoy even more so, when she was alive and well). But neither 
she nor I ever ever felt that we had a right to interfere or to supervise. For example, I never would have dreamed of 
asking you for financial statements, or even suggested that we discuss these matters. I'd have been happy to do so if 
you'd asked, b=t if not, it's your decisions and my role is only to be supportive -- as I h=ve been, in many ways that you 
know and I need not review. And also by setting aside ample funds over the years to ensure that you and your children 
will be well provided for: that includes the trusts of which you are beneficiaries, two houses, almost all of my pension, 
educational Trusts for grandchildren, and lots of funding along the way for all sorts of purpo=es. I don't understand why 
you think it is any different in the present cas=, and I think it would be a good idea for you to explain, so that we can 
clear the air. 
On a personal level, we are heartbroken to feel that we are kept at such a distance from you in your new life. We were 
thrilled to learn that you had found a new partner, but we were grieved when we began to realize that this meant we 
are rarely able to see you. 
It didn't mean that at all. Of course, my life became different, and Valeria and I had many things to do to put our new 
life together. But we took time off from the conference in Mexico to see you, with much pleasure; a few months before 
that we went to Wellfleet to spend some time with you. Harry, Amy and Alex have visited. I kept seeing Avi whenever 
we could arrange it, sometimes with Valeria, usually alone. We began spending winters in Tucson, now moved. I 
certainly don't want any distance, and am just as heartbroken as you to think that there might be. 
Even email and telephone communication has become much more limited. 
If so, I'm not aware of it. Until the last few weeks I spoke to H=rry weekly until he stopped calling. I very rarely had 
email corresponden=e with Diane in the past, more often with Guillermo, which has continued.Q=A0 Since Avi was 
close by, email was always limited. Otherwise we rarely used the phone. 
We have also been increasingly distressed to see that instead of feeling happy and relaxed, you feel impoverished. 
You misunderstand, totally and completely, so much so that I cannot compreh=nd where you are getting your 
information from. Certainly nothing in my letters or anything of said. Again, apart from this continued interchange, 
which I don't understand, I'm happy and relaxed, much =ore so than during the years before Valeria and I came 
together. As for "impoverishment," when I began to look into how my affairs had been handled, I discovered that I was 
indeed facing financial problems, though far from impoverished. I've explained before in letters th=t you have ignored, 
so I will repeat briefly again. 
I discovered that I have almost no pension: years ago it was turned into trusts of which you are the beneficiaries, and the 
very small pension I receive (less than Social Security) ends at my death, leaving nothing to Valeria. 
I discovered that I was living on an IRA that was being rapidly depleted..C2* To run through the arithmetic again, there 
is a mandatory withdrawal of about $300,000. Half of that was being distributed to 10 family membe=s. The other half 
was going to payment of taxes and management fees on the entire estate. In addition, close to $100,000 was going to 
expenses for Wellfleet and Alex's medical expenses. Hence before I withdre= a penny for daily life, I was already far over
