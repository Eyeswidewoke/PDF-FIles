A decades-old wall between Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman has crumbled -- and now management is beginning 
to show cracks, too. 
Two key executives in particular were stretched thin following a move this summer that folded the fashion office at 
Bergdorf — the Fifth Avenue luxury retail icon — into Neiman, its Dallas-based corporate parent that operates more than 40 
stores across the country, sources said.

Tommy Fazio -- who had won praise as men's fashion director at Bergdorf before he was forced to shoulder additional 
responsibilities at Neiman in June — has left the company, a Neiman spokeswoman confirmed. 
Fast-talking Fazio — known for his eye for detail and strong tics with designers like Torn Ford and Thom Browne —
"wasn't too happy" about the new workload, according to one person close to the executive, and has left to join an obscure 
men's clothing label called Spurt. 
Neither Spurt nor Bergdorf returned calls for comment. 
Meanwhile, sources said Roopal Patel 
a tastemaker for Bergdorf who was reportedly furious this summer when she was 
forced to supervise accessories at Neiman -- was making a public scene yesterday in the midst of New York Fashion 
Week. 
Patel, who previously held a more glamorous post at Bergdorf, supervising woolen's ready-to-wear clothing, was 'yelling 
and angrily stomping her feet' in a testy conversation with Bergdorf CEO Jim Gold on the street outside a fashion show by 
designer Catherine Malandrino, according to one person who witnessed the ruckus. 
"She didn't seem to be mad at Jim [Gold]," the person added, but rather pleading and complaining about the mess at the 
company as word of Fazio's resignation spread. 
A Neiman spokeswoman said "the reorganization recognized the talents of both Tommy and Roopal by giving them the 
opportunity to work on a much larger scale." taking on responsibility for 42 stores instead ofjust one. 
But while both execs were loaded with more work, one source said they received "little, if any" corresponding boost in 
compensation as Neiman has kept a tight lid on expenses. 
What's more, the role of fashion directors Fazio and Patel — who traditionally have shaped the merchandise at stores 
without a direct eye on the bottom line — has been questioned as the retailers' operations become increasingly numbers-
driven. 
Neiman President and CEO Karen Katz — who engineered the recent consolidation of Fazio and Patel's roles — "maybe 
doesn't totally get the fashion office," according to one person close to the company. 
The dust-up is another headache for Neiman Chairman Burt Tansky, who is beset by rumors that he will retire -- even as 
the retailer scrambles to cut costs as sales continue to plunge. 
Adding to the pressure is a mountain of debt the company took on four years ago in a SS billion buyout by the private-
equity firms TPG and Warburg Pincus.
