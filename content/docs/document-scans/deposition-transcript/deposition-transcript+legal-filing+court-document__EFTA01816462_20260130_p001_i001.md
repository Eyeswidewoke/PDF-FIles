Like the elves in Lord of the Rings. I think immortality is so seductive it's got these guys a bit 
mesmerized, but I like that people are interested in researching aging. The singularity part is a bit 
confusing - too many different definitions floating out there for it to be a meaningful concept at 
this point, imho. 
My friend apparently went to hear startup funding pitches at Singularity University not the 
Singularity Summit. 
I'm sending you the book we talked about "The Making of the Atomic Bomb." Not only does it go 
through the evolution of discoveries in physics it traces the human side of how this project came 
together, starting with Szilard's framing of his ambitions (based in part on HG Wells's writing ie. 
The Open Conspiracy) and how personal dreams and interactions produced the collaboration.

I know some of them - not Eric Baum. I liked his criticism of 
engineering as creating static and nonevolutionary design. I'll try and 
apply that to my work in scientific innovation: code and evolve, simple 
publication results are static. He has a nice framing - robust 
programming - that computational science as a whole might benefit 
from, going beyond his CAD apps. There is a similar idea to his notion 
of modularization in the study of scientific progress called black boxes -
the components we build future results on (another aspect to my 
research is the consequence of the internet making these opaque 
component boxes transparent). 
I don't know Peter Thiel (funder of singularity institute) personally, but found him 
interesting at one point a few years ago since he comes from the same 
Ayn Rand and Stanford background as I do. I saw him speak on the 
singularity at Google about a year or so ago and didn't think he knew 
what he was talking about and lost interest. In fact, I'm not sure those 
Singularity guys are being precise or scientific about what they're 
doing, generally speaking. Might not be an issue for you but makes it 
less interesting for me. Wouldn't mind chatting with Norvig and maybe 
a few others though, and I know Michael Nielsen personally and like 
him. 
Brockman asked me about them a few weeks ago and he questioned the lack of 
involvement by women. I agree that's weird. I told him Thiel was gay 
and he was surprised at his own prescience!
