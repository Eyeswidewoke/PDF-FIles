crisis that was fueled by bankers chasing higher pay. *"One million" 'of 
anything -- pounds, dollars or Bitcoins, sounds like a lot to us rabble, 
but let bankers explain to you how it's pretty much the same as nothing, 
really. 
For one thing, taxes will quickly whittle a seven-figure income right down 
to the mid-six figures, perilously close to being within sight of the 
middle class. Then, an ex-Goldman banker points out, with the mere 
$600,000 in take-home pay remaining, bankers still need to "pay the 
mortgages on, and maintain houses, in the Hamptons and Manhattan, to put 
three children through private schools costing $40k a year each, and to pay 
living costs."' 
Bankers might want to shed some of these costs by, say, sentencing their 
kids to rub elbows with the filthy Poor in public schools or owning just 
one house. But they are under constant social pressure to spend and spend 
some more, according to another ex-Goldmanite -- who is now a 
psychotherapist, naturally. And this is before the wives get their cut. 
According to the bankers and ex-bankers in this article, there are only two 
marital choices available to bankers: The frumpy, educated girl they've 
been saddled with since college, or a physically attractive layabout who 
sucks their soul and bank account dry. 'Which only makes sense, because 
what other kinds of women are there, fellas? Science.* 
An even stronger urge than the need to keep up with the Rotschilds or 
satisfy the miss-us is rooted in the bankers' childhoods. Every time they 
push a client to buy a sub-prime CDO, these bankers are merely trying to 
bring a smile to the cold, disapproving eyes of the parents looking over 
their shoulders. According to the squid/therapist quoted in the article, 
only "intense therapy."' So you truly have to ask, if these new 'Masters 
of the Universe', who see themselves apart from those who make less are 
having trouble living off of $1.6 million a year, they are obviously not 
financial wizards that they claim. Whereas, anyone who is working at 
McDonalds earning $18,000 yearly or a family of four living on $50,000 a 
year are economic magicians, much like my Mother who raised me, making $10, 
$12, $16 a day in the 1960s.

training and after reading 'Computer for Dummies*, you trudged along

smartphone and camera users during a 'TED Talk'. And yes, you may know a 
few of these already -- but there's probably at least one you don't. David
