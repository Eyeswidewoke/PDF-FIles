The biggest problem is the political rebels in Egypt are thanking Facebook for bringing them all together to fight 
oppression. This is bigger than the TIME cover for Zuckerberg. 
The timing is very bad for this chilling realization that what started out as a dating lark at Harvard has grown global 
to topple governments. If I were Scott, I would take full page ads in every paper in America and proclaim Facebook is 
the new "right is might" against injustice not one heroic king against the Nazi's. 
Harvey wanted me to stay in New York and make phone calls to every old person I court. This race is a fight to Feb. 
22 at 5:00pm and the longer the ballots stay out the more vulnerable TKS is. 
I got off the plane with two stuffed ears. They remained blocked for hours. I just woke up and they are less blocked 
but I still have slight inner ear aches and a sore throat. I may go to a doctor this morning because I am concerned about 
flying home. Never a dull moment. Also thinking about my sick mother and feel so sad for her. 
Glad I came for networking. Spent time with Colin Firth and all the European distributors that go to Cannes. Went to 
a lame small party for The Fighter that was 100 people crowded into an upstairs room in a hotel with adorable Amy 
Adams standing around with Jim Sheridan (has a hot new film for Universal with Daniel Craig and Rachel Weiss...and yes 
he saw the whole affair on his set), Terry Gilliam and distributors. The same guys have TKS and Fighter in Europe and 
they brought HW in. 
Then went to Eric Felner/Working Title/Vogue dinner party and was seated next to Nick Jones, owner of Soho House 
and right in back of Colin, Elizabeth Murdoch...yes I got her and Cohn nuts with the Logue/Keith Murdoch letters sitting 
in 102 Dame Elizabeth's attic in a shoebox....and they roared when I told them I put Mark Logue onto Wendi! 
Eric Fellner was telling me he was pissed at Harvey for jumping on his date (creating competing dinners) that he has 
had for years...but he understood I had to leave at 10:30pm because I was getting emails from Victoria...to get over 
there. 
Eric made me introduce him to Lucy Walker (who I asked to bring) and he is now taking her to lunch to talk about 
work. 
As chic as the Vogue party was (and I met one if Annabel Astor's daughters) once again Harvey's party was so much 
better with more film people, actors, a better mix, better room, better slightly brighter lighting, more table hoping and 
energy. Leave it to HW to put a party together in a week that was better than the one organized in the beginning of 
January. 
(But you know I am always less impressed with well dressed fashion people than articulate show biz.) 
I am going to the Momentum Distributing lunch for their Bafta nominees at noon...then resting...maybe Asprey 
cocktails but I know any party in a store is bad and Charles Finch's famous dinner. (He was at Eric's.) 
Sunday, I may go to Ginge Manor for lunch with Annabel Astor...she offered to send a car and her daughter said it's 
an hour and 15 away. 
Then Bafta's, the dinner, NW's after-party and home Monday. 
Might try to do something for Emily Smith on Page Six...which NW would love...someone told ne Emily "loves" 
me...hope that does not get around. After the double truck Geoffrey Rush story...I think it's overkill...but will probably 
write or call her anyway. 
I am very glad I came. Angus has been a doll. I met his soon to be very rich ex-wife, Meil de Boutton. He had fashion 
designer Oswald Boateng bring her. She was chic and very sweet. (Angus is reported to be getting about 50 million in the
