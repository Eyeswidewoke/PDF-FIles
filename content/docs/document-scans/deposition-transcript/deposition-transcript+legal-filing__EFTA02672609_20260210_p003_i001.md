And while Republicans in the rest of the c=untry are threatening to deport every immigrant not named Ted Cruz, 
California just OK'd driv=r's licenses for undocumented aliens. That's right, we're letting them =rive cars -- just like white 
people! You Red Staters may ask, "How come they'=re lettin' Meskins drive?" Well, it's because they have to get to=their 
jobs. You see, here in California we're embracing the modern world -- we can&=39;t be worrying about all the nonsense 
that keeps Fox News viewers up at night whe= they should be in bed adjusting their sleep apnea mask. Our state motto 
is,="We're Too Busy for Your Bullshit." 
The bottom line is that we are moving the country's largest economy int= a place where we can all be health-insured, 
clean air-breathin', gay-marr=ed, immigrant-friendly citizens who don't get shot all the time. And my mes=age to the 
rest of America is: do not resist. Kneel before Zod! California has bee= setting the trends in America for decades, from 
Silicon Valley to silicone tits, and it's not going to stop now. We say jump -- you say, "Ple=se sell me new exercise clothes 
for jumping." We said put cilantro in food, an= dammit, you did, you put cilantro in food, even though neither one of us 
kn=ws what it is. Almond milk? We just had some extra almonds and thought we= fuck with you. The enormous earlobe 
hole? You're welcome. We also invented t=e genius bar, where the kid with the enormous earlobe hole takes your 
MacBook=in the back and fills it with animal pornography. 
Bill Maher, host=of HBO's Real Time with Bill Maher -- 09/27/2013 
On Friday's show Bill Maher show a video of a sampling of Americans being asked what th=y knew about Obamacare. 
Web Link: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a=REhQICn90 <http:=/www.youtube.com/watch?v=afREKIICn90> 
If this is a truly representative sampling of what the majority of Americans understand about the Affordable Care Act, 
then we'=re in a lot of trouble. Hopefully, Bill Maher just chose the funniest, i.e. most ill-informed, responses from New 
Yorkers about Obamacare on the day the healthcare exchanges opened. Watch the cl=p from Friday's "Real Time" to 
have your faith in humanity completely unrestored. 
=p class="">As you know, on Tuesday House Republicans chose to shut down the Federal Government if the Democrat 
controlled Senate and White House di= not accede to their demands to delay and repeal the President's signature 
achievement the Affordable Health Care Act often referred to as Obamacare.-A0 Why? Republicans will tell you that 
Obamacare will hurt Americans, is un-Constitutional and is destroying the country. While the real truth is=that their 
goal is to weaken President Obama and destroy his Presidency. Good, bad or indiffer=nt, Barrack Hussein Obama is the 
44th President of the United States and he was re-elected last year with a substantial majority of the popular and 
Elector=l College votes. 
When he took office on January 20= 2009 the country was in two wars without a strategy, the most severe recession 
since the Great Depression, financial markets in free-fall and the major banks and financia= industry on the verge of 
collapse. Four and a half years later none of this is true. In addition, Osama Bin Lade= is dead and Detroit Auto Makers 
are doing better than ever, with the economy growing fo= more than 44 consecutive months. Using a slogan that 
Ronald Reagan campaigned on for his re-election, "are we bett=r now than we were four years ago." Without a 
doubt 
YES! As New Hampshire Senator Kelly Ayootte said this week, "its time for a reality check, defunding 
Obmamcare did not work as a strategy, so let's find common ground to work together to address the concerns that are 
very legitimate that we have with this healthcare bill, but also to get this government funded."=/p> 
T=ying to blackmail the President by hurting the country is a flawed strategy which should not be t=lerated in a 
democracy. Dissidence is understandable and at times desirable. But closing down the government and threatening to 
not raise the debt ceili=g unless the first major legislation that has been become law since the passage of Medicare and 
Medicaid fifty years ago, which will give access to tens of millions of Americans to affordable healthcare, should not be
