I don't feel awkward in the slightest. I think your people are interpreting what they see in a manner 
that is best for their perspective and to cover their asses. I think they're dead wrong. 
None of the people responsible for this transaction 5 years ago are still at IGY nor have they been for 
many years. This was not a situation in which your investment was solicited. It was something on 
which you insisted if you recall. I was trying to accommodate your desire to own 50% of the asset 
personally because of the nexus to LS.I. It was difficult to implement at the time because it was a 
related party transaction, would be seen by everyone, and thus every benefit of the doubt had to be 
given to IGY in which you and I both represented investors. The transaction, as I understand it, was a 
fixed price contract for a 50% interest. I did not negotiate the price, the contract or anything else. I 
have absolutely no idea how the number was arrived at and by whom. On either side. I don't know 
who did the deal for you either. But my recollection is that you were clear with me that you wanted 
to own half of it and I told people to see to it. Period. It was a 50/50 deal on the real estate and IGY 
and was to have retained all of the other rights and benefits it would have had if you had never been 
admitted. IGY is a branding, management, leasing and fee based company. To the best of my 
understanding that is what was done. 
My sense is that your team is trying now as hard as possible to demonstrate that something untoward 
happened. And its simply not true. The deal that was struck by those responsible for striking the deal 
(obviously not you or me) is the deal that was struck and the audits of the past 5 years seem to bear 
that out. 
If it is your desire to continue to have your folks dig through this, then please do so. There is nothing to 
find, jeffery. I have tried to show you that I want to try to make you feel better about a deal that in 
retrospect you seem to think was wrong. But I can't fix the past. I have been trying to show you my 
love and respect for you by offering to address the future. But it does not seem adequate. I am at a 
loss now for what to do. 
Your people struck a deal with IGY 5 or 6 years ago. It was what it was. I can't undo it. I'm upset that 
you're upset. But I can't seem to fix that either. So I surrender. Do what you think you need to do. I 
can't keep beating my management to reconstruct ancient history. They feel shitty that they are 
being treated as if they have done something wrong or have worked to obfuscate things when, in 
fact, they have been working hard to manage a difficult asset in a difficult environment. And they 
have done a solid job in a crappy market with an underperforming and aging asset. 
I made a couple of proposals to you. Ultimately I will get criticized by shareholders, I'm sure, for doing
