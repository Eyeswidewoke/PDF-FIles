DUBAI WORLD ORGANISATIONAL RESTRUCTURING 
I cleaned up the English, and edited it.. 
Dubai. IS October 2009 - Global holding company Dubai World. today announced that it has largely completed its 
restructuring . This has resulted in significant cost savings, increased and efficiency. Its businesses are now well 
prepared to thrive in an uncertain future environment. 
It has seen the management of lumeirah Golf Estates, Jumeirah Lakes Towers and the real estate activities of Dubai 
Maritime City move to Dubai World real estate company Nakheel. As a result of the restructure the company plans to 
benefit bu more than 800 million dollars in operating savings. The total workforce has been reduced by 
approximately 15%. This ensures that each Dubai World division is more appropriately sized for the current market 
while at the same time ,well placed to take advantage of the eventual economic recovery. During the process, each 
division reviewed its business plans and developed a clear strategy in line with its specific area of expertise, and have 
reviewed their operations and costs to more adequately reflect the current environment. Imponantlyst he ownership of 
the key assets underpinning Dubai World's balance sheet are unaffected by the organizational restructuring. 
Dubai World Chairman Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem said:"Whilst the challenges we faced arc not unique, with no global 
entity immune from the pressures of the world wide recession, we are confident that Dubai World and its subsidiaries 
arc appropriately focused and properly structured to embrace the new global reality. "Our diverse portfolio of assets 
around the world together with our significant interests here in Dubai provide us with an exciting and compelling 
finure.The Group will enter this next vital phase of our evolution better able to withstand all economic eventualities. 
Dubai World remains a testament to the vision of our government and the UAE as a whole, today and tomorrow." 
Group Chief Executive Officer of Dubai World Jamal Majid Bin lhaniah said:"I. This organizational restructuring is a 
substantial achievement and I would like to thank all our employees and our customers for their continued loyalty 
through these difficult times." Some of the key highlights of the restructuring arc detailed below. 
Nakheel ,the real estate development ann of Dubai World. has reorganized to focus its activities on that core business. 
The company is now structured into two divisions — asset management and real estate development. As noted above, 
Nakheel is now responsible for management of some real estate assets previously managed elsewhere in the 
group. As previously announced, the management of several hotels and commercial property has been transferred 
from Nakheel to Istithmar World. 
lstithmar World will continue to own these assets. 
In addition, management of Nakheel's shopping malls, including Ibn Batutta Mall and DragonMart in Dubai. are 
moving to a separate entity, branded Retailcorp World (see below). 
These changes are consistent with Nakheel's positioning as a real estate development business. 
Nakheel is now right sized for the current market and is structured to best meet the needs of its real estate customers. 
lstithmar World Istithmar World is the investment ann of Dubai World. 
The three different Istithmar World divisions, Istithmar World Ventures, Istithmar World Capital have been merged and 
Istithmar World's activities are now focused principally on the ongoing management of assets already acquired by 
Istithmar World with the aim of maximizing the value of those existing investments. In addition. Istithmar World will 
manage the assets of Dubai World Africain addition to the Victoria & Alfred Waterfront in Cape Town, South 
Africa. World Retail corp is the newly created retail management arm of Dubai World formed from the a division
