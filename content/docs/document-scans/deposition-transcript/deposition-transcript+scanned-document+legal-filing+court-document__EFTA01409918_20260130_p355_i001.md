Amendment No. 3 to Form S-1 
Table of Contents 
Fogo de Chao, Inc. 
Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 
(in thousands, except share and per share amounts) 
The Company's credit facility consists of two term loans (Term Loan A and 
Term Loan B). Term Loan A principal is due in quarterly 
installments and bears interest quarterly, at 3-month LIBOR plus a spread of 
4.00% with a LIBOR floor value of 1.00%. The maturity date of Term 
Loan A is July 20, 2019. Term Loan B matures on January 20, 2020 and bears 
interest at LIBOR plus a spread of 9.50% with a LIBOR floor value 
of 1 50%. 
The revolving line of credit bears interest at a rate of LIBOR plus a spread 
of 4.00% and has a maturity date of July 20, 2017. Additionally, 
the Company pays a commitment fee on the unused portion of the revolving 
line of credit at a rate of 0.50%. Because the Company is not required 
to make principal payments on any outstanding balance on the revolving line 
of credit until July 20, 2017, any outstanding balance is reported as 
non-current in the Company's consolidated balance sheet as a component of 
long-term debt. 
The Company is required to maintain certain financial covenants as defined 
in the credit facility agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, 
various remedies exist for the lender should the terms of the covenants not 
be met, including changes in interest rates and other fees or charges. The 
Company was in compliance with these covenants at March 29, 2015 and 
December 28, 2014. 
Under the terms the credit facility agreement, the Company is required to 
make mandatory prepayments in the event of Excess Cash Flows as 
defined in the agreement. The Company reclassified $1,938 at December 28, 
2014 of long-term debt to current as a result of this provision. The 
Company is required to make this mandatory prepayment within five business 
days of filing its debt compliance certificate which is due within 120 
days from the end of the Company's fiscal year end. 
The Company's wholly-owned subsidiary Brasa Holdings is the sole issuer of 
all of the outstanding debts and revolving line of credit. The 
credit facility is secured by substantially all assets of Brasa Holdings and 
its subsidiaries. 
As of March 29, 2015, the Company had four letters of credit outstanding for 
a total of $1,731 and $23,269 of available borrowing capacity 
under the revolving line of credit. 
Debt Issuance Costs 
In connection with the issuance of the outstanding long-term debt, the 
Company incurred debt issuance costs, which are being amortized to 
interest expense using the effective interest rate method over the term of 
each related facility. Remaining unamortized debt issuance costs were 
$905 and $989 at March 29, 2015 and December 28, 2014, respectively. These 
balances are included in other assets (noncurrent) in the 
consolidated balance sheets. 
Indebtedness Repayment Schedule 
At March 29, 2015, the indebtedness (excluding discounts) on outstanding 
long-term debt is payable as follows:
