Section 5.5. - Spendthrift Provision 
During the term of any trust hereunder, no money or other assets (either principal or 
income) payable or distributable under the provisions of this Agreement shall be pledged, 
assigned, transferred, given, conveyed, hypothecated, sold, anticipated, charged, or encumbered 
by any of the Beneficiaries hereunder, nor shall the income and principal of any trust, while in 
the possession of the Trustees, be liable for any debts, contracts, obligations, or undertakings of 
such Beneficiaries, voluntary or involuntary, or for any claims or judgments against any 
Beneficiary, including claims for alimony or for the support of any Beneficiary's spouse or 
children, or for reimbursement of a federal, state or local government, or any agency of any 
federal, state, or local government, for the support of any Beneficiary hereunder, prior to the 
time such money or assets are actually paid or distributed to such Beneficiary. Any attempted 
pledge, assignment, transfer, gift, conveyance, hypothecation, anticipation, charge, or 
encumbrance of any money or assets (either income or principal) payable or distributable under 
the provisions of this Agreement by any of the Beneficiaries hereunder prior to the time such 
money or assets are actually paid or distributed to such Beneficiary shall be null and void and 
shall not be recognized by the Trustees. This Section 5.5 of this Article V shall not apply to me. 
Section 5.6. - Limitation on Distributions 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no discretionary distribution of 
income or principal of any trust hereunder shall be applied to pay for medical care, residential 
facilities, or any other care or service that would otherwise be provided for any Beneficiary 
hereunder by any federal, state, or other governmental agency; and no such discretionary 
distribution of income or principal shall be made for reimbursement for any such care, facilities 
or services previously provided. Before making any discretionary payment to or for the benefit 
of any such Beneficiary hereunder, the Trustees shall consider the amounts such Beneficiary is 
or may be entitled to receive from any governmental agency for such care, facilities, or services. 
If such amounts are available, discretionary distributions of income and principal from any trust 
hereunder shall be made only to supplement such amounts, and to provide liberally for needs 
and comforts over and above the basic maintenance, support, and medical care that may be paid 
for by any such agency. 
Section 5.7. - Division and Combination of Trusts 
A. 
For any administrative, tax or other purpose determined by the Trustees 
to be in the best interests of any Beneficiary (including any remainderman) hereunder, the 
Trustees may at any time and from time to time (whether before or after funding), without 
approval of any court, divide any trust under this Agreement into two or more separate trusts or 
combine two or more trusts with substantially identical terms (whether or not such trusts resulted 
from division of a prior trust).
