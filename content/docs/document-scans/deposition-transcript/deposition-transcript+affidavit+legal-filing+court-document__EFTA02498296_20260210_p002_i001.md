I certainly do =ope that this time, you understand the finality of your 
"relationship=quot; with my husband. I hope now you can find true happiness without havi=g a relationship with 
someone else's husband. I really hope you do. l&=39;m not a person who likes to see other people suffer, no matter 
what hur=s they may have caused. I am not gleeful about your loss. Reid says he alw=ys wanted to just be friends with 
you, but I think he understands because =f your (plural) behavior and the damage you have both caused to our marria=e 
and family, that can probably never be. I hear from many people (w=o don't know what's gone on) that you and I would 
be great friends= I wish I could say I hope that happens someday, but I'm the kind of w=man who loves the sisterhood, 
not women who sleep with and fall in love wi=h someone else's husband or significant other, no matter how willing t=e 
man is to have his ego stroked and no matter how swept away you are by f=elings of some kind of deformed mutation of 
love. I just don't see tha= kind of friendship between us in the cards. However as I told Reid =efore he picked up the 
phone to call you, if he could urge you to suck up =our hurt feelings and send me a sincere apology for participating in an 
ar=angement that caused damage to Reid, to yourself, to me, and to our 
(who has been fighting tears all 
weekend because of his mother's pai= and because he sees the father figure he has admired his whole life as a =eak man 
who has lied and cheated to his mother)....if you can find it in y=ur heart to ask for my forgiveness, I would want very 
much to forgive you =nd see you in a light different from the one I have seen you in for years.=Perhaps you aren't 
aware....Reid has told me about his addiction to yo= before and has asked for my help to break it. He finally found the 
power =o do it because of the depths of his misery and unwillingness to proceed t=rough life as a dishonorable man. I 
hope you can find a similarly tr=e friend who can do the same for you. I wish you well, believe it or not. =ad you not 
jumped off the phone as quickly as you did (which I perfectly w=Il understand) he would have told you this. 
Reid and I have a lot of work to do together to fix the mess you two hav= 
caused, but our love is very strong and we will get there. I honestly don=ff393 want to add to your hurts by making you 
think you have destroyed our=marriage on top of everything else. I can't imagine you would have rej=iced had that been 
the case. You haven't destroyed our bond so n= worries on that front. It must be hard for you to understand how deep 
our=relationship is since he has not acted that way in his weak behavior with =ou. In fact, I think he felt he could act out 
with you, act as though his =elationship with you was intense and real, precisely because he knew I wou=d be there for 
him. He is a great man with great weaknesses. That doesn Ht make him a monster and I don't think you are either. 
Best wishes for your future, 
PS Bob Bauer, a dear friend to me and to=Reid, cares about you a great deal. He 
might be a good person for you to d=aw strength from. He has been a source of comfort and wisdom to me 
through=this. He truly is a wonderful man and I have no doubt he would show you gr=at kindness.
