The Fund and the Manager have acknowledged and agreed that, in certain instances. Debevoise & Plimpton LLP. as 
counsel to an underlying private equity fund in which the Fund invests, may have to withdraw as counsel to the Manager 
if a conflict arises between the Fund and such underlying fund. In such an instance, the Fund would be required to retain 
additional counsel. Separate counsel has not been engaged to act on behalf of Investors in the Fund. To the fullest 
extent permitted by law. Debevoise & Plimpton LLP does not represent or owe any duty to any Investor or to the 
Investors as a group in connection with its role as special counsel to the Manager. 
Diverse investor group 
Investors may have conflicting investment, tax and other interests with respect to their investments in the Fund. As a 
consequence and in connection with decisions made by the Fund, including with respect to the nature or structuring of 
investments, decisions may be more beneficial for one Investor than for another Investor, especially with respect to 
Investors' particular tax situations. In selecting and structuring investments appropriate for the Fund, the Manager will 
consider the investment and tax objectives of the Fund and its Investors as a whole, not the investment, tax or other 
objectives of any specific Investor. 
Side letters 
The General Partner or the Manager may enter into other written agreements with one or more Limited Partners which 
have the effect of establishing additional rights or alerting or supplementing the terms of the Fund Partnership Agreement 
(each, a "Side Letter). Any such Side Letter may entitle a Limited Partner to make an investment in the Fund on terms 
other than those described herein, in the Fund Partnership Agreement and in the subscription agreements relating to the 
purchase of Interests. Any such terms, including with respect to (i) reporting obligations of the Fund, (ii) transfers to 
affiliates, (iii) withdrawal rights due to adverse tax or regulatory events. (iv) consent rights to certain Fund Partnership 
Agreement amendments, (v) payment of fees, or (vi) any other matters, may be more favourable than those offered to 
any other Limited Partners. If the General Partner or the Manager enters into a Side Letter entitling a Limited Partner to 
withdraw from the Fund, any election to withdraw by such Limited Partner may increase any other Limited Partners' pro 
rata interest in the Fund. 
It is the Manager's policy to treat Limited Partners fairty. Consistent with this policy and applicable rules and regulations, 
the terms negotiated with individual Limited Partners may vary for a number of reasons, including a Limited Partners 
regulatory and/or tax status or other requirements or policies applicable to it, the amount of a Limited Partners

Deutsche Bank Group, and the nature of a particular investment.
