Texas Led the Nation in Active Shooter Incidents in 2024, FBI Report Says

False Rumors of Minneapolis ICE Raid Spark Protest as Police Decry 'Irresponsible' Info From Elected 
Officials 
Fox News (06/05, Norman) reported that a chaotic protest in Minneapolis during which federal agents were seen 
getting physical with demonstrators unfolded as elected officials posted "highly irresponsible" information online 
suggesting a criminal search warrant was an ICE operation, police say. Tense moments were captured on video 
Tuesday as federal agents and the public clashed in the streets of the major city, with Minnesota State Sen. Omar 
Fateh claiming on Facebook, "On scene are DHS, ICE, FBI, Sheriffs, and MPD" in what he described as "blatant 
fascism on display." The article stated that in a follow-up post, Fateh said, "While the Mayor has told us ICE is not 
welcome in our city, what residents saw was their deployment assisted by his MPD." However, the federal 
operation focusing on a Mexican restaurant actually "was related to a criminal search warrant for drugs and money 
laundering and was not related to immigration enforcement" and "No arrests were made," according 
to Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey. "The information that came out on social media from elected officials was highly 
irresponsible," Hennepin County Sheriff Dawanna Witt said Wednesday. "There were ways for them to have 
accurate information and instead of getting accurate information, being impulsive and putting out things that could 
potentially incite riots is senseless." CBS News (06/05, Wanger) also reported on the story. 
Federal Judge Hints at Early Release of MLK Jr Assassination Files Following Trump's Order 
The Independent (06/05, Sommerlad) reported that the government's secret files on the assassination of the 
Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. could be released ahead of schedule after a federal judge in Washington 
indicated he was open to doing so. In January, President Donald Trump signed an executive order, demanding 
the release of all government documents pertaining to the shootings of MLK, as well as both President John F 
Kennedy and his brother, Robert F Kennedy, in the 1960s. According to the article, at Wednesday's hearing in 
Washington, Judge Richard Leon of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia suggested he was prepared 
to bring the release date forward to comply with Trump's wishes, although he also emphasized the importance of 
sensitivity. Judge Leon said the first step would be for the National Archives and Records Administration to show 
him the complete inventory of files it has in its possession on the MLK assassination and the FBI investigation that 
followed, so as to establish the size of the processing task ahead. 
ICE Arrests Under Trump Top 100,000 as Officials Expand Aggressive Efforts to Detain Migrants 
CBS News (06/05, Galvez) reported that arrests by Immigration and Customs Enforcement during President Trump's 
second term topped 100,000 this week, as federal agents intensified efforts to detain unauthorized immigrants in 
courthouses, worksites and communities across the U.S., internal government data shows. On Tuesday and 
Wednesday, ICE recorded more than 2,000 arrests each day, a dramatic increase from the daily average of 660 
arrests reported by the agency during Trump's first 100 days back at the White House, the federal statistics show. 
During President Biden's last year in office, ICE averaged roughly 300 daily arrests, according to agency data. The 
article noted that the federal agencies now helping ICE arrest unauthorized immigrants include Customs and 
Border Protection; the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; the Drug Enforcement Administration; 
the FBI; and the Internal Revenue Service. The Trump administration has also enlisted local and state law 
enforcement officials in friendly jurisdictions like Florida to support ICE operations.
