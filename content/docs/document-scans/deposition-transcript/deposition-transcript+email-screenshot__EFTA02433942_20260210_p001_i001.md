Ok, you are upset. 
Please remember you offered to do this last night so don't tell me I forced you into doing 
something you detest. I don't think I was forcefull at all...you offered a call, I said why not an 
email. I couldn't believe you really did something that thoughtful and selfless so I asked to see it. I 
said thank you many times because I know you did it for me and I know you didn't really 
understand what it meant or agreed with the idea behind it but you still did it. Don't attack me 
because of it now, take the credit. Frankly, it was a much better lesson than trying to argue with 
me or nag about my flaws. I got the message.

I had previously asked whether you wanted to be in the house wiht svetlna so you could see for 
yourself , you have decided that the help i asked for was petty. Can i get you anything , nannys 
head massage. sue's tea, was not important. though I said these are the small things i d 
appreciate. then when others gladly do as i ask , you feel insecure. you feel no compunction to 
spoling my birthday, because you don't like 
t, spoling my highly anticipated trip to new york, 
because you overhear me talking on the phone and i according to you, said baby in kind tones. so 
you threw a tantrum. no sex fun, no hug, you wanlked out without saying goodbye. and today 
not only ask me to do as you put it petty , things (petty is trite , trivial, what you asked was for 
me to transmit your words as they were coming out of my mouth, having me do something i 
strongly detest, which i did immediately without argumnet, and even then, you couldn't stop, and 
had to ask for proof, and then more ( and you wonder where the idea that you are a spolied brat 
comes from„ ) . I had asked if you wanted a conference call. the fact that you take offense to the 
way people perceive you, you attribute to me. the fact and ive told you this mupltiple time, the 
more I say to defend you and your behavior, the more i say , no, she really is a help, no, she is my 
girlfriend, you will be seen to be weaker rather than stronger,if i was standing next to you and 
you told evryone in the most sincere of terms , doesn't jeffrey look in great shape. would do 
nothing more that call attention to the fact that i am not, and suggest that i am in need of bullshit.
