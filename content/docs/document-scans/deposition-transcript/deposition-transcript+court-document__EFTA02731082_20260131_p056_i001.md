massages to Epstein at his Palm Beach residence. 
Maxwell taught 
how to recruit younger girls for Epstein by taking

shopping trips, during which Maxwell would demonstrate how to recruit girls and would make 
practice doing so. Maxwell taught

really nice guy who likes to help people out," adding "you can make some money," and noting

that Epstein had a sex addiction. 
When 
recruited girls, she would have them meet her at her home, and then she 
would get a ride. Sometimes

Maria Alessi, Maxwell, or
