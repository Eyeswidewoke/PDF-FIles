Lighte: I think there's been a flight to quality, for example. It's been easier to market to clients 
because of the difficulties other banks are having; but, I've also learned that business of bankers is 
cycles, but no banker ever believes he's in one. But, I have enough experience to know that 
arrogance can turn right around and bite us right in the neck. 
So, I am loathe to be haughty these days because it can happen to anybody, I really mean that. 
That being said, I am quietly proud of how J.P. Morgan is going about our business. 
We are fortunate in enjoying some good publicity, these days; and I cannot help but feel that it's 
much better for other people to say good things about us than for us to say it about ourselves. 
I remember when I was a kid, an aunt of mine used to talk about her daughter all the time; and I 
once asked my mother, "why don't you talk alot about me?" She replied with a smiile, "I prefer to 
let other people do that." It's exactly the same thing. 
If you go to the recent CCTV interview with Jamie Dimon, when the anchor or journalist 
commented that Jamie was the most influential banker on Wall Street, he said simply that , "No, 
actually, this is an exaggeration. I'm just one of 200,000 employees at J.P. Morgan. I'm just doing 
my best." Not a bad role model, Pd say. 
Hubris is always perilous--all the more if you think you're flying high. 
TAB: So, what's the ripple affect for your bank in China? Is it business as usual, is it just sticking 
with your plans or... 
Lighte: Our plans continue, tougher times, aside; but our times are somewhat eased. When Jamie 
Dimon and his team were recently here, we were prepared with deep freeze scenarios. What a 
relief to be told to just get on and build out those branches! That speaks volumes about our 
commitment to China. 
There are certain things that are important right now to him and to Heidi Miller who heads up 
Treasury and Security Services and is the China advocate at the top of the house. They arc both 
committed to building out China, full stop. There's no equivocation. 
TAB: Will China be getting more attention because what's going on in the US and globally? 
Lighte: Absolutely. Just couple the facts that the biggest treasury holders in the world are the 
Chinese and the Chinese growth story will continue to be one of growth, China is centre stage. 
How the relationship gets adjusted between the two countries amidst the drama of the global 
economy remains to be seen; but, China is all the more significant to the United States during 
these stressful times. 
But, for sure, the fates of China and America are intimately related. There's no two ways about it. 
And I think the president-elect is mindful of this. Frankly, his domestic agenda cannot be hived off 
from the global situation.
