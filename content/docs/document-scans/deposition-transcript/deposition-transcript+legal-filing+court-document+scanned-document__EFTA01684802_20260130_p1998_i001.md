we exercise this right. A Penalty APR applied to a Feature balance pursuant to this subsection D will continue to apply to that Feature 
balance until you make timely payments for six consecutive billing periods. 
E. In our sole discretion. we may choose not to apply the Penalty APR to one or more Feature balances on your Account. even if you 
have met a condition described above. If we do this. it shall not constitute a waiver of our right to apply the Penalty APR on another 
occasion. 
F. The 'Prime Rate' is determined once with respect to each billing period. The Prime Rate for each billing period is the Prime Rate 
published in the Money Rates section (or successor section) of The Wog Street Joumalon (a) the first day of that billing period or (b) 
the day that is two days prior to the Closing Date of that billing period. whichever is higher. In each case. if such a day is not a 
customary publication day for The Wall Street Journal we will substitute the closest preceding day that is a customary publication day. 
If The WO Street Journal ceases or suspends publication. we may refer to the Prime Rate published in any other newspaper of 
general circulation in New York. New York. or we may substitute a similar reference rate at our sole discretion. Any increase or 
decrease to an APR resulting from a change in the Prime Rate takes effect as of the first day of the billing period. An increase in the 
Prime Rate means that the variable APRs (and corresponding DPRs) applicable to your Account will increase and you may incur 
higher Finance Charges and may have a higher Minimum Amount Due: 
Average Daily Balance 
We are updating the description of how we calculate Average Daily Balance. The changes provide that more than one interest rate could apply 
to a balance during a billing period. Accordingly, effective with billing periods beginning on or after January 22. 2010. the Average Daily 
Balance Method for Calculating Finance Charges section of your Agreement is deleted and replaced with the followthg: 
'We use the Average Daily Balance method to calculate periodic Finance Charges on your Account. Under this method. we calculate 
Finance Charges on your Account by applying the DPR to the Average Daily Balance (including current transactions) separately for each 
Feature balance subject to Finance Charges (as described below). Different OPRs may be used for different Features (such as Sign & 
Travel and Extended Payment Option). Within the same Feature there may be multiple balances (•Feature balance(s)') with different 
DPRs within the same billing period. 
To get an Average Daily Balance for a Feature balance. we (1) take the beginning balance for each day (including unpaid Finance 
Charges from previous billing periods). (2) add any new transactions. debit. or fees. (3) subtract any payments or credits credited as of 
that day. and (4) make any appropriate adjustments. For each day atter the first day of the Ming penod, we also add an amount of 
interest equal to the previous days daily balance multiplied by the previous days DPR for that Feature balance. This gives us the daily 
balance for the particular Feature balance for that day and the beginning balance for that Feature balance for the next day. If this balance 
is negative. it is considered to be zero. For each Feature balance. we add up the daily balances for each day a particular DPR was in 
effect for that balance and divide by the number of days that DPR was in effect for that balance. This gives us the Average Daily Balance 
for each Feature balance. 
If you multiply the Average Doily Balance for a Feature balance by its DPR, then multiply the result by the number of days of the billing 
period that the DPR was in effect. the result will be the periodic Fthance Charge for that Feature balance. except for variations caused by 
rounding. The total periodic Finance Charges for the billing period is the sum of the periodic Finance Charges assessed on each Feature 
balance. This method of calculating the Average Deny Balance and Finance Charges results in daily compounong of Finance Charges. 
We may use mathemaliCal formulas which produce equivalent results to calculate the Average Daily Balance, periodic Finance Charges. 
and related amounts. For example. we may utilize computer programs or other computational methods that are designed to produce 
mathematically equivalent results while using fewer ander simpler computational steps than are described in this Agreement. 
At our discretion. we may exclude certain categories of debit transactions or fees from the calculation of the daily balances. Unless we 
elect to use a later date. we add a Charge to the daily balance as follows: For Charges that we added to a Feature balance automatically. 
we add the Charge to the appropriate doily balance as of the date of the Charge. For Charges that ore added to a Feature balance at 
your request. we add the Charge to the appropriate daily balance for the Feature as of the date we process the request. Periodic Finance 
Charges are added to the Feature balance on the last day the applicable DPR was in effect for each Feature balance in the biting period. 
In our sole discretion. we also may round any calculations made in determining the Finance Charges on your Account in any way that is 
convenient to us' 
Foreign Transaction Foe 
We are not increasing your cost for foreign currency transactions. But we are changing the way they appear on your billing statement. Now. 
when we convert a charge in a foreign currency into U.S. dollars we increase the conversion rate by 2.7%. For charges in foreign currencies 
that we process on or after July 1. 2010. we will itemize this 2.7% amount as a fee on your statement. Accordingly. effective July 1. 2010. the 
Transactions Made in Foreign Currencies section of your Agreement is deleted and the following is added to the end of the "Other Fees' 
section of your Agreement: 
"Foreign Transaction Fee: If you incur a Charge in a foreign currency. it will be converted into U.S. dollars on the date it is processed by 
U3 or our agents. and we will charge a foreign transaction fee of 2.7% of the converted U.S. dollar amount. This fee is a Finance 
Charge. Unless a particular rate is required by applicable law, you authorize us to choose a conversion rate that is acceptable to us for 
that dale. Currently. the conversion rate we use for a Charge in a foreign currency is no greater than (a) the highest official conversion 
rate published by a government agency. or (b) the highest interbank conversion rate identified by us from customary banking sources. on 
the conversion date or the prior business day. This conversion rate may differ from rates in effect on the date of your Charge. Charges 
convened by establishments (such as airlines) will be billed at the rates such establishments 
Also effective July 1, 2010. we will itemize the 2.7% amount for ATM transactions in foreign currencies as a fee on your statement. The 
following paragraph will be added to the Fees section of the Agreement Between American Express Cardmember and American Express
