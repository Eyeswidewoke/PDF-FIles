Palestinian refugee camps are even known to hold pow=rful official posts in some rulers' courts. 
SUCCESSION STRUGGLES 
The pressures facing the Gulf states make for a very tense region, one in w=ich disagreements over the United States, 
Iran, and Israel threaten to boi= over. Quarrels between the kingdoms have at times grown so bitter that on= monarchy 
has tried to alter the course of dynastic succession in another.=Following the death of a ruler or a petty internal dispute 
in one monarchy= it is now commonplace for neighboring monarchs to interfere, either by di=creetly backing a 
preferred candidate, or, in the more extreme cases, by s=onsoring a coup d'etat. The resulting power vacuums have 
often allowed=foreign powers to interfere as well. 
The best example of a modern-day coup and subsequent foreign interference t=ok place in the UAE's northernmost 
emirate of Ras al-Khaimah. In 2003, a=ter allegedly burning an American flag at an anti-Iraq war demonstration, =rince 
Sheikh Khalid bin Saqr al-Qasimi, the emirate's long-serving crown=prince, was replaced in the order of succession by a 
younger half-brother,=Sheikh Saud bin Saqr al-Qasimi. Their very elderly father, Sheikh Saqr bin=Mohammed al-Qasimi, 
later signed a decree in support of this change, but m=ny analysts questioned the ruler's decision-making abilities, given 
his =dvanced age and poor health. The new crown prince had the apparent backing=of Abu Dhabi, which sent military 
tanks to take positions on the streets o= Ras al-Khaimah. The ousted crown prince's supporters still took the str=ets to 
show their support; security forces with water cannons disbursed th=m. The crown prince was then duly exiled, crossing 
the border to Oman befo=e leaving for the United States. 
As the emirate's Dubai-like development program began to flounder in 2008= the new crown prince Saud became 
increasingly vulnerable to criticism, in=luding widespread allegations that he accepted kickbacks from the construc=ion 
industry. The deposed prince, who was still in exile, enlisted a U.S. =ublic relations firm and a British lawyer to conduct 
an international medi= campaign to persuade Abu Dhabi and the international community that the i=cumbent crown 
prince was a liability. 
The campaign focused on Saud's apparent connections to Tehran, claiming t=at his effective deputy -- a Shia Lebanese 
businessman -- had major commer=ial interests, including factories, in the Islamic Republic. In 2009, the =ampaign even 
claimed that Iranian customs officers had been visiting Ras a=-Khaimah's port and that the emirate was serving as a 
conduit for nuclea= materials destined for Iran. Local media alleged that recent terror plots=there, including a 2009 
attempt to blow up Dubai's incomplete Burj Khali=a skyscraper, had originated in Ras al-Khaimah. The exiled crown 
prince ev=n courted Israeli support, reportedly meeting with Israel's ambassador t= the United Kingdom, who said that 
he was "working with certain people f=om his side" and "promised that the matter will be solved in his [the =ormer 
crown prince's] favor." 
In late 2010, the campaign appeared to be gaining traction. Abu Dhabi's r=ling family allowed Khalid to return from exile 
to visit his father Sheikh-Saqr, who still held the throne but was undergoing treatment in an Abu Dha=i hospital. When 
Saqr died in October, Khalid Ocm 5.4pt 0cm 5.4pt" valign="top" width="61">
