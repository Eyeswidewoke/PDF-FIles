(ii) 
cause the Transfer of up to 100% of the defaulting Limited Partner's 
Interest to (X) any one or more non-defaulting Limited Partners at the highest price 
offered by such other Limited Partner(s), or (Y) to any third party or parties acceptable to 
the General Partner or the Investment Manager, who shall offer a higher price and would 
otherwise qualify for admission as a Limited Partner of the Partnership; provided that in 
no event will the Investment Manager have any obligation to maximize the price payable 
by any party to the Defaulting Limited Partner, seek additional bidders or otherwise 
consider the interests of the Defaulting Limited Partner, 
(iii) 
reduce the defaulting Limited Partner's Interest to an amount equal to the 
lesser of (A) an amount that such Interest represents of the Net Asset Value and (B) the 
aggregate Capital Contributions made by such Limited Partner in respect thereof reduced 
by such Limited Partner's Percentage Interest of Feeder Fund Expenses and losses (if

(iv) 
cause the defaulting Limited Partner not to share in any income or gain

(v) 
charge interest on the amount for which the Limited Partner is in default at

(vi) 
prohibit the defaulting Limited Partner from participating in any future

In addition to and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the 
General Partner (or its assigns, including the Investment Manager) may, in its sole discretion, 
exercise any remedy in respect of the defaulting Limited Partner and/or the Interest of the 
defaulting Limited Partner that could have been exercised (i) by the General Partner if the 
provisions of the Master Fund LPA were contained herein in their entirety, mons mutandis 
and/or (ii) by the Master Fund General Partner if the defaulting Limited Partner were a limited 
partner under the Master Fund LPA. In addition, in the event that the defaulting Limited 
Partner's Default results in or contributes to a default by the Partnership under the Master Fund 
LPA (a "Master Fund Default"), the General Partner may, in its sole discretion, to the 
maximum extent possible, specially allocate any losses, damages, liabilities, remedies, costs or 
expenses relating to or arising out of the Master Fund Default directly to the defaulting Limited 
Partner's Interest. Each Limited Partner acknowledges that if it becomes a defaulting Limited 
Partner, the application of this Section 5.03 to it could result in the forfeiture of all or 
substantially all of its Interest in the Partnership and/or the loss of all or substantially all of the
