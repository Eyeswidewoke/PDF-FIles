here with the Biden family participating in them. That's something they'll have to explain." 
Morgenstern said on Fox Business' Evening Edit, "If we're looking to elect a president for the 
American people, not our foreign adversaries, this is something the...people definitely need to 
know immediately. This is absolutely groundbreaking news for our nation." 
Breitbart (10/22, 673K) reports Biden's campaign called reports of Hunter Biden's 
'overseas business dealings...'Russian misinformation' just hours before Thursday evening's 
final presidential debate." Fox News (10/22, Wulfsohn, 27.59M) reports on its website that 
Bobulinski had been scheduled to attend the debate "as a special guest of President Trump." 
The New York Times (10/22, Goldman, 18.61M) runs a piece titled "What We Know And Don't 
About Hunter Biden And A Laptop." 
Senate Judiciary Committee To Move Forward On Facebook, Twitter Subpoenas. 
The Wall Street Journal (10/22, Hughes, Needleman, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) reports 
the Senate Judiciary Committee has authorized Chairman Lindsey Graham to issue subpoenas 
to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey. The Washington Times (10/22, 
Lovelace, 492K) says "the forthcoming subpoenas will request the CEO's testimony on the 
"suppression and/or censorship" of two New York Post articles involving the former vice 
president's son on information about the company's content moderation practices and on other 
instances of Facebook and Twitter limiting the visibility of material online." Roll Call (10/22, 
DeChiaro, 154K) reports Graham "said Democrats on the committee had asked him to delay 
voting on the subpoena authorization but that he decided to move forward because of 
bipartisan interest in Zuckerberg and Dorsey." 
Trump, Ratcliffe Reportedly Seeking Declassification Of Russia Inquiry Document. 
Reuters (10/22, Hosenball, Bing, Landay) reports President Trump and DNI Ratcliffe "have 
pushed for quick declassification of a document disputing the 2017 intelligence community 
finding that Russia acted to help Trump get elected in 2016," according to three officials familiar 
with the matter. Two of the source said the "effort faces strong objections from inside the 
intelligence agencies," in part because the presidential election is so soon. 
The Daily Caller (10/22, 716K) reports that Trump and Ratcliffe are requesting the 
declassification "at the request of California Republican Rep. Devin Nunes." The intelligence 
community concluded "that Russia's meddling in the 2016 election broke in favor of Trump, 
regardless of the later finding that Trump's campaign had not colluded with nation." 
The Hill (10/22, Coleman, 2.98M) reports that Ratcliffe said, "I have requested that the 
document undergo a formal declassification review in response to a request" from Nunes. A 
former intelligence official told Reuters the CIA and NSA "were attempting to prevent the 
document's declassification 'because it would damage national security assets and jeopardize 
sources and methods." 
John Brennan Discusses DNI Ratcliffe's "Credibility," Trump's Relationship With 
Intelligence Community. 
In an interview clipped three times on the Washington Post website (1, 2, and 3), former CIA 
Director John Brennan "says he wishes John Ratcliffe had more 'credibility." DNI Ratcliffe this 
week "warned that both Iran and Russia had obtained voter data that could be used to 
endanger the upcoming election," but, in the interview, Brennan "said Ratcliffe was not specific 
about what Russia has done." Brennan said, "I think there are questions about whether or not 
what he said is being motivated by his political interests." Brennan also "said he thinks one day 
we'll know more about President Trump's relationship with Russia." Moreover, Trump's "attacks 
on the intelligence community will have long-lasting effects, but he has confidence the agencies 
will be resilient and respond positively to a Biden administration, if he is elected." Brennan said, 
"I have confidence that the communities are going to be resilient and they're going to respond 
very positively to the words of encouragement they're going to be hearing from President Biden 
and the rest of his national security team."
