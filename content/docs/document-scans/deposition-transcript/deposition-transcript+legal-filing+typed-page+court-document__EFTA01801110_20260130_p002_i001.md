=C240 By falling on his sword, Mr Diamond has created the possibility of a rapprochement bet=een his former 
bank and British political opinion formers. The bigger issue=for the bank he leaves behind and others like it is how — or if 
Q=804k it is possible after the crisis to rebuild political and regulatory confidence in the kind of financial markets 
busine=ses he dedicated his career to building and the people who run and profit f=om them. 
Bob Diamond's resignation as Chief Executive of Barclays bank cle=rly marks a turning point in the politics of 
banking in the UK. The announc=ment that Barclay's was to be fined E290mn as part of a settlement with the FSA 
financial regulator over its part in t=e fixing of the London interbank lending rate between 2005 and 2008 proved t=e 
tipping point for Mr Diamond. The Barclay's CEO has long been the=most controversial of Britain's bank leaders and had 
few political friends. Yet in the end, the trigger for his r=signation was not direct political pressure, but the FSA's 
intimati=n to the Barclay's board that unattributed threats from the top of B=rclays to the Bank of England had made 
Barclays' relationship with its regulator potentially toxic. 
Mr Diamond's departure and the LIBOR-fixing scandal will mark the start o= a new phase in the politics of the 
banking crisis in Britain. The suggesti=n that traders at Barclays and other banks were manipulating what is ultimately a 
key public benchmark for=pricing financial products compounds a run of mis-selling and tax planning c=ntroversies. With 
a Parliamentary enquiry now to take place on the LIBOR is=ue in the UK, and the issue likely to ripple across other 
jurisdictions and produce both litigation and=possible prosecutions, banks in the UK are confronted with new levels of 
po=itical and public disdain. The fact that the Bank of England's own c=nduct remains subject to question in some 
aspects of the LIBOR scandal will not deflect from this. 
It is safe to assume that the setting of LIBOR will now be moved into the=remit of the UK financial regulator. 
Brussels will tighten market abuse rul=s to apply criminal sanctions to tampering with indices like LIBOR. But the most 
significant political an= regulatory outcome from these events will be to renew the debate about uni=ersal banking. 
Where this debate has to this point focused on scale, implic=t subsidy and systemic risk, it will now focus on culture, 
personal character and contamination from the values of the trading floor to the rest of a ban=ing institution. Because 
these things cannot be regulated, the probability is that politicians will f=cus on their political proxies, especially pay. 
The return of Vick=rs 
The link between what has happened at Barclays and the uni=ersal banking argument is trust. Preserving the 
universal bank model relies=on public trust that the core retail functions of a bank and its trading ac=ivities can be 
properly and completely segregated. The UK Independent Commission on Banking chaired by Sir John Vi=kers proposed 
in 2011 that they could be preserved in a single institution b=t in separate entities, with the retail functions ringfenced 
with their own=higher capital levels. The Vickers Commission recommended that all derivatives services should be 
kept=outside this ringfence. 
The UK government accepted the argument that retail banks s=ould be able to maintain some simple derivatives 
functions such as products=for hedging currency risk for business clients. The Barclays experience is a=ready leading 
politicians and commentators in the UK to argue that simple derivatives may be an oxymoron.=Trying to define them 
may be a futile exercise, and one that will inevitabl= be gamed by banks.
