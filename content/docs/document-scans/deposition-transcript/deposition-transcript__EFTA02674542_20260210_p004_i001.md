As mos= of you know, I am a big fan of Bill Moyers and last week on Moyers & Company, political scholars Norman 
Ornstein and=Thomas Mann explained to Bill that Congress' failure to make progress on gun=control last week —
despite support for background checks from 90% of the American publ=c — is symptomatic of a legislative branch's 
dysfunction, partisan ravings and obstructionism.

For one thing, taxes will quickly whittle a seven-figure income right down to the mid-six figures, perilously close to being 
within sight of the middle class. Then, an ex-Goldman banker points out, with the mere $600,000 in take-home pay 
remaining, bankers still need to "pay the mortgages on, and maintai= houses, in the Hamptons and Manhattan, to put 
three children through privat= schools costing $40k a year each, and to pay living costs."=/p> 
An even stronger urge than the need to keep up with the Rotschilds or satisfy the miss-us is rooted in the bankers' 
childhoods.= Every time they push a client to buy a sub-prime CDO, these bankers are merely tr=ing to bring a smile to 
the cold, disapproving eyes of the parents looking over their shoulders. According to the squid/therapist quoted in the 
artic=e, only "intense therapy." So you truly have to ask, if these new Masters of the Universe, who see the=selves apart 
from those who make less are having trouble living off of $1.6 million a ye=r, they are obviously not financial wizards 
that they claim. Whereas, anyone who is working at McDonalds earning $18,000 yearly or a family of four living on 
$50,000 a year are economic magicians, much like m= Mother who raised me, making $10, $12, $16 a day in the 1960s. 
For those of=you (like me) you probably haven't had any formal computer training and after reading Computer for 
Dummies</=>, you trudged along learning what you can, during trial and error. To help both you=and me Tech 
columnist David Pogue shared 10 simple= clever tips for computer, web, smartphone and camera users during a TED 
=alk. And yes, you may know a few of these already -- but there&#=9;s probably at least one you don't. David Pogue is 
the personal technology columnist for the New York Times and a tech correspondent for CBS News</=>. He's also one 
of the world's bestselling how-to authors, with titles in the For Dummies series and his=own line of "Missing Manual" 
books. Please feel free to click on the web-link below.

The April employment numbers are in and after a disappointing M=rch report in which only 88,000 jobs were added to 
the US economy, the Department of Labo= said that the nation added 165,000 jobs and unemployment fell to 7.5%; 
&nbs=;a solid job creation in April. What is truly encouraging is that th=s positive news comes in the shadow of the 
sequester's automatic spending cuts, causing federal government employment (excluding postal service) to fall by 
4,900. On top of this the new report revised the March numbers up from 88,000 to a healthier 138,000, suggesting that 
the labor market isn't slumping=as much as it had appeared. Many of the details of the new report also point to a 
steady job market: The drop in the unemployment rate= for example, was driven by more people finding jobs, not by
