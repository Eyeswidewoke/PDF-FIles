The New York Times (10/8, Kantor, 18.61M) reports friends of Amy Dorris, who accused 
President Trump of forcibly kissing and groping her at the US Open in 1997, recall hearing the 
accuser's claims the year that she says they happened. Math teacher Dawn Capp "said that 
soon afterward, her friend had told her the same story about Mr. Trump that she later told 
publicly." Kerri Whitfield, "another friend, echoed those recollections, saying that Ms. Dorris had 
shared the story privately in the autumn of 1997. Neither friend has previously spoken publicly; 
both say they are confident of Ms. Dorris's truthfulness." 
Louisiana Residents Bracing For Delta, Now Category 3 Hurricane. 
The CBS Evening NewsVI (10/8, story 8, 1:40, O'Donnell, 4.22M) reported, "Millions along the 
Gulf Coast are bracing for Hurricane Delta, now a major Category 3 hurricane. It is expected to 
make landfall in Louisiana tomorrow afternoon, the record fourth named storm to hit the area 
this season. ... There's fear that Delta could destroy the few remaining homes those other 
storms didn't." 
The Orlando Sentinel (10/8, Pedersen, Harris, 536K) reports the National Hurricane 
Center said Thursday, "Heavy rainfall will lead to significant flash flooding and minor to major 
river flooding in parts of Louisiana Friday and Saturday. ... Additional flooding is expected 
across portions of the central Gulf Coast into the Lower Mississippi Valley." 
ABC World News TonightVi (10/8, story 6, 1:00, Muir, 6.7M) meteorologist Ginger Zee 
said "storm surge is going to be a big problem" with Delta. The storm is expected to make 
landfall on Friday night, which is "when the winds will be at their heftiest. Gusts near Lake 
Charles up to 80." Al Roker said on NBC Nightly NewsVi (10/8, story 6, 0:40, Holt, 5.56M), 
"The big problem: Delta's growing larger, so the tropical force winds extends from Galveston to 
New Orleans. Storm surges up to 11 feet and rainfall that could top 15 inches in some local 
spots." 
Lonnie Quinn of the CBS Evening NewsVi (10/8, story 9, 1:10, O'Donnell, 4.22M) said, 
"This storm is a record-breaker, from going from a tropical depression to a Category 4, the 
fastest in history. Now we're back to a major hurricane, a Category 3. Winds are blowing at 135 
miles per hour." As it "pushes towards the Louisiana coastline, we think it's going to get a little 
stronger, maybe 125-mile-per-hour wind but losing some strength as it comes onshore. It will 
come onshore about 24 hours from now as a Cat 2, maybe a Cat 3." On NBC Nightly NewsVi 
(10/8, story 5, 1:25, Holt, 5.56M), Morgan Chesky said Delta "could be making a direct hit" on 
Lake Arthur, Louisiana. 
The Washington Post (10/8, Lamothe, Cusick, Cappucci, 14.2M) reports the storm, "like 
so many before it, was drawing from warm waters and strengthening as it spun toward the 
Louisiana coastline." This hurricane season "has brought repeated attacks on coastal 
communities from Texas to Florida, an unrelenting barrage of rising water, heavy rain and killer 
winds that have uprooted trees and sent them crashing down on occupied homes." On ABC 
World News TonightVi (10/8, story 7, 0:45, Muir, 6.7M), Rob Marciano said the "the last thing" 
Lake Charles, Louisiana "needs is another major storm," since "the recovery since Hurricane 
Laura has been painful." The Wall Street Journal (10/8, McWhirter, Ailworth, Subscription 
Publication, 7.57M) reports local officials called on residents of Calcasieu Parish to evacuate 
ahead of the storm. 
The AP (10/8, Borenstein) reports Delta is "gaining strength as it bears down on the US 
Gulf Coast" and "is the latest and nastiest in a recent flurry of rapidly intensifying Atlantic 
hurricanes that scientists largely blame on global warming." National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration Climate and Hurricane Scientist Jim Kossin said, "We've certainly been seeing a 
lot of that in the last few years. ... It's more likely that a storm will rapidly intensify now than it 
did in the 19805," and "a lot of that has to do with human-caused climate change." In the last 
few decades, "meteorologists have been increasingly worried about storms that just blow up 
from nothing to a whopper, just like Delta. They created an official threshold for this dangerous
