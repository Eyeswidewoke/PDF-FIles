at 701 (citing Asahi Metal Indus. Co. v. Superior Ct, 480 U.S. 102, 113, 107 
S.Ct. 1026, 94 L.Ed.2d 92 (1987)). Accordingly, I find that this Court has 
general jurisdiction over the defendants and that litigating this matter in 
this forum comports with the Constitution's due process requirements. 
B. Venue in this Court is Proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(a) 
Defendants also argue that this is an improper venue in which to litigate 
this dispute. (Mem. in Supp. of Defs.' Mot. to Dismiss at 20-21.) I agree 
with the plaintiffs, however, that the Virgin Islands is a proper choice of 
venue. (Pls.' Mem. of Law in Opp'n to Mot. to Dismiss at 24-29.) Although 
the plaintiffs agreed to submit to the jurisdiction of New York courts and 
to waive the defense of an inconvenient forum, they did not agree to sue or 
be sued exclusively in New York. The Amended 1999 Note states that 
the undersigned [Epstein] hereby irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of 
any New York state or federal court sitting in New York City, and the 
undersigned hereby irrevocably agrees that any action may be heard and 
determined in such New York state court or in such federal court. The 
undersigned hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent he may 
effectively do so, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance 
of any action in any jurisdiction. 
(Mem. In Support of Defs.' Mot. To Dismiss, Ex. D at 10.) The Amended 1999 
Note, however, does not limit "the undersigned" to a specific forum or bar 
the plaintiffs from suing the defendants in any forum having personal 
jurisdiction over the defendants. Moreover, under the federal venue statute, 
a diversity case such as this can be brought in a "district where any 
defendant resides, if all defendants reside in the same State." 28 U.S.C. § 
1391(a). This statute further provides that "[f]or purposes of venue ..., a 
defendant that is a corporation shall be deemed to reside in any judicial 
district in which it is subject to personal jurisdiction at the time the 
action is commenced." 28 U.S.C. 1391(c). Because I have found that both 
Citibank and Citigroup are subject to this Court's personal jurisdiction and 
are thus deemed residents of the Territory for venue purposes, venue is 
proper in the Virgin Islands under section 1391(a)(1). In addition, these 
claims may be litigated in a "district in which a substantial part of the 
events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred." 28 U.S.C. § 1391(a)-
(2). The solicitation of the plaintiffs while they were in the Virgin 
Islands and the mailing of documents to the plaintiffs constitute a 
sufficiently substantial part of the events giving rise to this action to 
render venue proper under section 1391(a)(2). Accordingly, I will deny the 
defendants' request to dismiss this matter for improper venue. 
C. This Case Need Not Be Transferred to New York 
Anticipating that I might find that jurisdiction and venue are proper in 
this Court, the defendants have requested that I transfer this case to the 
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. They 
aver that this claim actually arose in New York and that the clauses in the 
agreements stipulating to the application of New York Law and the
