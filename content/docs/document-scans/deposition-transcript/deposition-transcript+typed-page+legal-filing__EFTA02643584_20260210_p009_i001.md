I wasn't paying much attention, =ut we discovered that until last year, the one IRA to which I have access was 
being used to distribute money to the family, up to the legal limit, which amounts to about half the annual required 
withdrawals from the IRA. Furthermo=e, taxes and management fees for the whole estate, most of which we have no 
access to, were being withdrawn from our IRA, carrying us well beyond the required withdrawal. In addition there were 
other expenses, like Wellfleet ($50,000 annually), Alex's annual medical bills, Max's bi=ls, and others. That has all led to 
rapid depletion of the IRA -- again, the only source we have access to in the estate. We were therefore compelled to 
make extra withdrawals, since there is almost no other source of income and we have other regular expenses (like 
Anthony). The family distributions along with full taxes and management fees for the whole estate, exhausting the IRA, 
made no sense, but it was my fault=C21)for not paying attention and simply assuming that sensible decisions were 
being made. Wrongly it turns out. 
The same was true of the decision to=move from Lexington to the Cambridge apartment. I had assumed, 
mistakenly, that I owned the Lexington house, and that the sale would cover the purchas= of the apartment. Turns out 
that that was mistaken and the three of you actually owned the house -- again, my mistake; not paying attention..C24, 
We also received very poor advice. We should never have bought this apartment, which we can't possibly afford. I had 
assumed tha= the proceeds of the Lexington house would come to me when the house would be sold. Therefore, we 
followed Max's and Sam's advice and to=k out a mortgage for half the price of the apartment, and a loan from one of 
your trusts (that is, a trust in M's name) for the other half, i= order to buy the apartment, expecting that as soon as the 
Lexington house sold, we would immediately pay off the mortgage and the loan. Of course, that never happened, since 
the house was not mine. We therefo=e have to deal with the mortgage and the loan. 
The mortgage we have been payin= it off slowly. The much bigger problem is the loan -- which, it turns out, has 
a substantial interest rate, so that it grows every year. We not only have to sell the apartment, which is too expensive 
for us, but to do so quickly, or it will never be possible to pay off the loan from the trust, which grows every year. More 
bad advice. 
We're dealing with all of this.=C2. We've cut back our life styles to below what either Valeria or I had been 
used to in the past -- not poverty of course, but cutting back on lots of things= And we're making plans to accommodate 
to the circumstances, which we 
tell you about when they are in place. 
For me, it's of course a great r=lief that all of you will be financially quite well off when I die. But I also want to 
make sure that Valeria will be able to be independent just as she was all her life. We're very happy together. Her coming 
into my life was not only a surprise -- I'd expected to spend my last years alone -- but also a real blessing for me. Valeria 
has given up quite a lot, for all the obvious reasons: family, her life in Brazi=, and so on. I don't have to explain why I'm 
concerned about he= welfare after I die. 
Those are the basic facts. If =here is something I'm overlooking, or unaware of, I of course would like to know 
about it -- and also to know the source, because it would be quite a surprise and I'd like to check. I've looked into all of 
the=e matters carefully and think I have a complete picture. This is something I'd never done in earlier years, simply 
placing my trust in others -- n=t always wisely, it turns out.
