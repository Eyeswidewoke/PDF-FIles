cover page of this prospectus) and all shares offered by us in this offering are sold, (i) profits interests in AB Acquisition would 
convert into equity of Albertsons Investor with an indirect ownership of 19,382,213 shares and into 450,749 shares owned by 
Kimco, for a total direct and indirect ownership of 19,832,962 shares upon completion of this offering and (ii) Phantom units of AB

2.3% of our outstanding common stock upon the completion of this offering. An initial public offering price of $26.00, which is the 
high point of the estimated offering range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, would increase the total number of 
shares outstanding and owned by Albertsons Investor and Kimco upon completion of this offering by 300,493 shares. An initial 
public offering price of $23.00, which is the low point of the estimated offering range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus,

offering by 339,687 shares.
