As a reviewer of this project's SBI R Phase I application noted, 'The need for such a 
device is very high both nationally for the screening and early diagnosis of 
ametropias in children and rural populations, and internationally for the provision of 
optometric services in a wide range of locations? 
The National Eye Institute (NEI, one of the National Institutes of Health) funded a 
research project, The Vision In Pre-schoolers Study or VIPS study, that showed that 
the two currently marketed portable auto-refractors are the present-day tools of 
choice for vision screening, a task that can be performed by lightly trained 
technicians and even HeadStart parents trained for a couple of hours. The key 
targets of public health screening efforts in developed countries are children and 
traditionally under-served populations (minority groups, urban and rural populations 
with poor access to healthcare). The autorefractor contributes to vision screening by 
determining whether a patient has more than a clinically or functionally significant 
amount of near- or far-sightedness or astigmatism. If positive, the patient gets a 
referral to an optometrist or ophthalmologist for a comprehensive eye exam. Of 
special interest are children, especially the difficult-to-examine young children 4-7 
years old. Note that it is not feasible to provide every young child a comprehensive 
eye exam — even in a provider-rich city like Boston, there are not enough 
optometrists and ophthalmologists. Therefore, a low-skill screening step is essential. 
Delivering refractive services for kids who need them, as soon as they need them, 
will not only help improve school performance, but has been proven to be remarkably 
effective (see next paragraph) in preventing the development of amblyopia, a life-
long, permanent un-correctable visual impairment currently affecting 3% of the adult 
populations of almost all developed and less-developed countries. The buyers for this 
market are primarily public health and primary educational institutions. These are 
admittedly difficult markets, but they have been gradually opening in the US and 
Europe as research has shown efficient, often auto-refractor based, vision screening 
drives referrals to licensed eyecare providers with optimal sensitivity and specificity. 
OptiOpia intends to own these markets in the US as they develop but cannot "bet the 
company" on waiting around for legislative allocations of resources during a time of 
budgetary pressure on existing education and health budgets. 
The benefits of widespread and well-done childhood screening in Scandinavia are 
dramatic: prevention in more than 80% of children of the permanent, lifelong loss of 
good vision in at least one eye, amblyopia, by detecting and correcting near-
sightedness, far-sightedness and astigmatism. OptiOpia believes that developing 
and deploying novel autorefractor technology is a great way, in the coming era of 
limited public health spending, to protect the health and quality of life of American 
children. Because recent NEI research has forcefully demonstrated the screening 
sensitivity and specificity of a portable, sensitive autorefractor that is operable by lay 
people and school nurses, and because of the national policy priority of this objective 
as a Healthy People 2020 initiative, now is a compelling time for investment to move
