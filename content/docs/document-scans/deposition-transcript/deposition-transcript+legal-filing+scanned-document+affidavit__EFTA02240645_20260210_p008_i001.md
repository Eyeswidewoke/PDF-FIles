Anyone who lives in a big Eastern seaboard city like Boston or New York has 
experienced irritation at getting into a taxi and finding the driver talking into his 
cellphone. The typical scene is that he barely interrupts his conversation to ask your 
destination before resuming a stream of Russian, Arabic, Hindi, or some other 
language you don't understand. Many riders experience irritation at this, and bans on 
using cellphones while driving have been passed. 
But these little encounters are a kind of global interface—you and the cabbie are 
where two worlds meet. If you can afford to ride in a taxi, you are likely to have 
reaped the rewards of the Land of opportunity, while the driver is just getting a seat at 
the table. On the phone he's reaching out to his old world. He could be talking to his 
wife about how the kids are doing in school. If you have a dark imagination, however, 
he could be talking to a disgruntled cousin in Iraq whose anger is boiling over about 
America. One sees the occasional news story about foreign-born taxi drivers arrested 
for recruiting or contributing money to terrorists. 
The most cherished myth about American immigration is the melting pot, but the 
situation is currently more like a boiling pot. Ellis Island has always stood for the 
former, more optimistic image. But the spectacle of mass immigration has always 
been bittersweet. In his 1917 silent short movie, The Immigrant, Charlie Chaplin's 
Little Tramp is on a boat pulling into New York Harbor—on YouTube you can view 
the scene titled "Arrival in the Land of Liberty." 
Chaplin, nattily dressed in his formal coat and bowler hat, is slumped on deck with a 
tight gaggle of immigrants. They jump to their feet to see the Statue of Liberty pass 
by, then they are immediately roped off by uniformed authorities. Meekly they submit 
as one by one they are allowed through a rope barrier. The Little Tramp isn't quick 
enough, however, and his first greeting in the new land is a kick in the pants from a 
police guard. 
Resentment and welcome are the two themes of historical immigration. No matter 
when your family arrived here—I came in 1971, a newly minted M.D. from India 
responding to the Vietnam War doctor shortage—there was always a simmering 
antagonism toward immigrants. I felt it from the established doctors in the emergency 
room in the hospital where I first worked in Plainfield, New Jersey. They assumed 
that I must have had an inferior education in India (in fact, the All-India Medical 
Institute in New Delhi boasted professors who came from the U.S. to insure a high 
level of quality graduates). 
Being snubbed by American-born colleagues eventually led to my first appearance I 
print when the Boston Globe published my letter complaining of rank prejudice 
against Indian physicians. But opportunity is an undeniable factor in most immigrant 
stories, mine being no exception. Wave after wave of foreigners has withstood 
nativist pushback, whether it was the anti-Irish sentiment of the 19th century, the 
antisemitism that followed, giving way to the Red Scare, the McCarthy era, or the 
current furor over illegal immigrants.
