At one stage, said =terle, Hamdallah got a little agitated as the group continued to bring him=back to the topic of 
honoring terrorists through sporting events and the e=ucation system. 
The same theme of questioning was put t= the education minister, and the same answers came back to the group. 
Trim=le opened the session with the process of inclusion between children from =oth sides of the Northern Ireland 
conflict. The minister appeared not to b= interested in further conversation in this area, though he did say the as=istance 
of the international community was needed to commence peace talks.=/span> Sterle, for whom this was not the first 
Dialogue gather=ng, said that it is imperative to have the visit to Ramallah included in an Dialogue visits. "It is definitely 
worthwhile for delegates to meet and =ear from the PA ," he said, and strongly recommended a briefing from 
Pales=inian Media Watch before any meetings with the PA."

<=iv style="margin-left: 30px;">Source: AAP=/div> "The Federal Industry Ministe= Christopher Pyne has defended his 
approach in high-level discussions in t=e West Bank at the weekend. 
=span>Mr Pyne was part of a delegation of British and Australian politician= visiting Israel, before heading for talks with 
Palestinian authorities in=Ramallah. 
The Palestin=an Education Minister Dr Sabri Saidam told SBS News he had expected the di=cussions to focus on 
education, but was surprised by the group's "explosiv=, blunt and rude" questions about Palestine's education system. 
He said both Australian and Briti=h MPs asked the offensive questions. 
"There was a lot of incitement I would say on behalf of the relegation meaning or implying that the Palestinians are the 
ones terrorisi=g Israel when we have been subjected to the longest occupation, as I said,=of modern times," he said. 
<=pan>Dr Saidam said Mr Pyne sidetracked from his Innovation portfolio to co=centrate on political discussions. 
"I had hoped that the Minister of Innovation would spend some =ime talking about Innovation, Industry and Science and 
I said you are now =elcome, the Ministry of Service that runs schools and manages higher=education entities, that we 
should be talking education. Instead, we were =iverted to talk about political difficulties and talking about challenges

In response, Mr Pyne's office sent the =ollowing statement: 
"M=mbers of the delegation are responsible for their own comments and behavio=r. 
"The Minister perso=ally engaged in constructive discussions centred around understanding Pale=tinian attitudes to the 
peace project." 
Dr Saidam said he gave the group a textbook on education =n Palestine and encouraged members to pose their same 
questions to the Isr=eli Government."
