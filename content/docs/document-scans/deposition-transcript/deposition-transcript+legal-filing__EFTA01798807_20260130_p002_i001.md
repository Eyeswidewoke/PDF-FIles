It looks like we are getting close to = final conceptual layout. Some of the comments we are seeing are prog=ammatic in 
nature — massing and basic heights — appropriate fo= where we are in the design process. But some are too detail-
oriente= for the phase we are in right now — railing details, roof spring lines, hardscape patterns, etc. Those need to be 
studied=after concept is done. We need to step the back a bit, and get basic=concept resolved, before we launch into 
the next level of design. 
Here is what I propose for the Main Re=idence: 
* 
= We need to focus on the scheme with the =errace at 44' and the switch-back stair. We can still adjust a=l of the 
elevations and stepping, but it sounds like the scheme with the s=raight run stairs from the main residence down (+47' 
version) was not preferred. 
* 
= We need to look at a couple a couple of =asic options for where the living room floor elevation; +42c;, +44', 
+47', etc. 
= We need to review the basic levels of th= stepped terraces, and include the views from the bedroom area. 
* 
= We need to take the photo-realistic patt=rns off the model, and just show the massing. I think the stone patt=rn 
is distracting our focus. The finishes and details for this (ston= vs. plaster walls, railing/wall details, etc.) would be part 
of the next design phase. 
Flagpole Pool: 
Jeffrey, I need to understand from you=how you want to proceed with this flagpole pool area. It looks as if=it is going to 
be built, before we have a chance to complete the design it! I do not want risk of that happeni=g, and your being 
dissatisfied with the end design. At this point, w= have almost completed the concept, incorporating what we discussed 
during=our work session last week (outdoor living room for cabanas with low sloped roofs, revised approach, etc), into 
the d=sign. We need to do to send you the new model views, which we can do=once the Main Residence is resolved. 
However, we are now being asked=to draft the pool building so it can be fast-tracked and built! Aside from this not 
being part of our scope of work, I ne=d to emphasize that this building has not been designed yet. We just=have a 
conceptual layout. For example, we proposed one large sliding glass=door facing the pool, centered on the main axis. 
Now we are told to make it two smaller ones, due to shipping a=d storm protection. That may not be the right solution 
— cente= point on that wall being a post. One smaller slider with two window= may be a more appropriate solution. We 
also do not know what the interior looks like, especially the bathroom. 
Here is what I propose for the Flagpol= Pool: 
* 
= Let us finish concept, including a revis=d west elevation for the pool building. When that is done, we will 
p=epare design drawings — floor and roof plan, basic elevations, basic=sections. Then you can have your local engineer 
do the structural portions for the permits. 
Jeffrey, please send me your comments =n this. Tom and team are currently addressing your notes from yester=ay on 
the design.
