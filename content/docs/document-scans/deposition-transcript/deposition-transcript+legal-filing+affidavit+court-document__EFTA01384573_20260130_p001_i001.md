HUBUS133 Alpha Group Capital 
Best Execution 
Transactions for Clients will be allocated to broker-dealers for execution taking into 
consideration factors such as price; transaction costs; ability to effect the transactions; a 
broker-dealer's facilities, reliability and financial responsibility; commitment of capital; 
access to company management; quality of research; effectiveness of sales coverage; 
access to deal flow; the provision or payment by the broker-dealer of the costs of 
research; and other factors that are deemed appropriate to consider under the 
circumstances. In selecting broker-dealers, Hudson Bay Capital need not solicit 
competitive bids and has no obligation to seek the lowest available commission cost. 
Hudson Bay Capital does not always negotiate "execution only" commission rates and 
may, in its sole discretion, determine that the amount of commissions charged by a 
broker-dealer which is greater than the amount another broker-dealer might charge is 
reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and products or services provided by 
such broker-dealer. Accordingly, the commissions and other transaction costs (which 
may include dealer markups or markdowns) charged to Clients by broker-dealers in the 
foregoing circumstances may be higher than those charged by other broker-dealers that 
may not offer such products or services. Subject to the considerations described above, 
the selection of a broker-dealer (including a prime broker) to execute transactions, 
provide financing and securities on loan, hold cash and short balances and provide other 
services may be influenced by, among other things, the provision by the broker-dealer of 
the following: capital introduction, marketing assistance, and consulting with respect to 
technology, operations, equipment and office space. Hudson Bay Capital may have an 
incentive to select a broker-dealer based on its interest in receiving these services rather 
than on Clients' interest in achieving most favorable execution. However, as noted 
above, Hudson Bay Capital selects broker-dealers according to its fiduciary duty to seek 
best execution, taking into account all applicable considerations. 
If Hudson Bay Capital decides, based on the factors set forth above, to execute over-the-
counter transactions on an agency basis through Electronic Communications Networks 
("ECNs"), it will also consider the following factors when choosing to use one ECN over 
another: the ease of use; the flexibility of the ECN compared to other ECNs; and the level 
of care and attention that will be given to smaller orders. 
Soft Dollar Benefits 
From time to time, Hudson Bay Capital may pay a broker-dealer commissions (or 
markups or markdowns with respect to certain types of riskless principal transactions) for 
effecting transactions in excess of that which another broker-dealer might have charged 
for effecting the transaction in recognition of the value of the brokerage and research 
services provided by the broker-dealer. In certain cases, such arrangements, although all 
related to Hudson Bay Capital's administration and investment management of the 
Funds, may fall outside of the safe harbor for fiduciaries' use of "soft dollar" services 
established by Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended; 
provided, in each case, that Hudson Bay Capital believes these arrangements are 
equitable and consistent with the objectives of the Funds. As of the date of this Brochure, 
there are no arrangements whereby Hudson Bay Capital has committed any Fund to pay a
