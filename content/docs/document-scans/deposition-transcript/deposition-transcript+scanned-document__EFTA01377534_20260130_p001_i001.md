As Lula corruption Probe Begins, Brazil's crisis Heats Up Again 
2015-07-17 03:00:01.0 GMT 
By Anna Edgerton 
(Bloomberg) -- The political crisis engulfing Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff got a lot bigger 
Thursday, when the man who was both her mentor and predecessor was named as the target of a federal probe 
into foreign business transactions. 
Former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, whose widespread popularity paved the way for Rousseff's 
election in 2010, is under investigation on allegations of influence peddling to help construction 
company Odebrecht SA win contracts in Panama and venezuela after his term ended. 
while Lula denies any wrongdoing, the investigation still could further bog down an administration 
that's struggling to fend off its own corruption scandal and stabilize an economy sinking into its worst 
recession in 25 years. The real reversed earlier gains Thursday on concerns the probe into Lula could 
derail the government's austerity plan and further weaken a president facing threats of impeachment. 
"It's truly a terrible moment, a delicate moment," said cristiano Noronha, vice president of 
political research company Arko Advice. "The situation should get even worse in the short term. It should 
remain quite difficult, quite tense." 
In a separate investigation, authorities are probing more than 50 politicians on alleged kickbacks 
paid to win contracts with the state-run oil producer. Rousseff's previous chief of staff, Senator Gleisi 
Helena Hoffmann, is under investigation for graft and police have detained the former treasurer of her 
Workers' Party for laundering money. Both deny the allegations. 
vet Thursday's announcement opens a new phase of Brazil's political scandal given Lula's unrivaled 
proximity to Rousseff and expectations he would make another bid for president in 2018. 
'Serious Accusations' 
"This adds to the trouble facing Brazil given the serious accusations made against prominent members 
of the workers' 
Party," congressman Mendonca Filho, the leader of the opposition DEM party in the lower house, said by 
phone. "This is going to intensify what's already a serious crisis." 
Lula, who orchestrated Brazil's rise to investment grade and helped pull millions out of poverty 
during his two terms, often meets with Rousseff to give political and economic advice and stumped for her 
in last year's re-election campaign. 
Lula also remained close to Brazilian businesses after leaving office in 2010, including odebrecht, 
which is Latin America's biggest builder. Marcelo odebrecht, the company's chief executive officer who 
was detained last month on allegations of corruption, said in April that Lula flew on company jets on 
speaking tours abroad sponsored by the firm. 
Marcelo odebrecht denies wrongdoing.
