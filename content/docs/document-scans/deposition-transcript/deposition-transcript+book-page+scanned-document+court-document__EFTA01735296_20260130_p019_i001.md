this case that it is wrong to approach this question solely from the perspective of English criminal procedure. In 
our jurisdiction prosecution will normally be started by the laying of an information, or a decision to charge. In 
many, perhaps most, other European countries the position is different. It is necessary to adopt a cosmopolitan 
approach to the question of whether as a matter of substance rather than form Mr Assange is wanted for 
prosecution. The fact that Sweden requires a person to be interrogated, before a formal decision to charge is 
made, is not determinative. Each country has its own procedures for prosecuting offences. The fact that the 
defendant would be interviewed upon his return is no clear indication that this is a criminal investigation rather 
than a criminal prosecution. This point was made recently in Anteslov v Szekszard City Court, Hungary 
12011J 1 WLR at pars 46. 
Two Swedish wimesses have given evidence that in their opinion Mr Assange is not wanted for prosecution. 
However their opinion is fatally undermined by having been based on an incorrect assumption as to the facts. 
They had been told that Ms Ny made no effort to interview Mr Assangc before he left Sweden with her 
permission and knowledge on 27th September 2010. In fact it is overwhelmingly clear that Ms Ny had contacted 
Mr Hurtig to arrange an interview significantly before 27th September. Having left Sweden Mr Assange has not 
returned. Shc did not know he was planning to leave Swcdcn on 27th September — even his own lawyer 
apparently only discovered that later. The most that had happened was that she had confirmed at an earlier stage 
that there was no legal constraint, at that time, on Mr Assange leaving the country. It is not necessary for me to 
determine for current purposes whether Mr Assangc deliberately fled the country to avoid further proceedings. 
That has not been specifically alleged. What is clear however is that he has not made himself available for 
interview in Sweden. It is said that an interview could have occurred in another way, for example by telephone 
or by way of Mutual Legal Assistance. Perhaps another prosecution lawyer would have taken that step. I don't 
know. Similarly I heard no submissions that English law would allow Mutual Legal Assistance in these 
circumstances. On the information I have, it does not seem unreasonable for a prosecutor in a serious matter 
such as this to expect and indeed require the presence of Mr Assange in Sweden for questioning, and if necessary 
to rake a DNA sample. Such unanswered questions that remain arc unanswered because this defendant has not 
complied with the request made to be interrogated in Sweden. There is then the fact that these proceedings are 
at the preliminary investigation stage. The decision to charge can be taken only after this stage is complete. It is 
not complete until interrogation has taken place and other important procedures, such as providing the evidence 
to the defence or nominating witnesses, have occurred. Upon the conclusion of the preliminary investigation a 
decision on whether to charge will be taken. 'chew arc obviously differences across Europe in systems and terms 
such as prosecution. This is well recognised. The court must take a purposeful approach. Someone who, say, 
commits a murder in Stockholm, immediately flees the country, and then avoids detection and interrogation, may 
well be wanted for prosecution (defined in a purposeful sense) in Sweden. It cannot be said, sensibly, that 
because he has not been interviewed then he is not wanted for prosecution and therefore no EAW can be issue. 
That is not the factual situation here, of course. It simply illustrates that the fact that no interrogation has taken 
place and therefore the preliminary investigation has not concluded is not determinative of whether a person is 
wanted for prosecution.
