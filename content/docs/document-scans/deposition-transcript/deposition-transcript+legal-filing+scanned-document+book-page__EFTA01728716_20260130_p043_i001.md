investigating officer; attack the motives of the prosecutor; claim the case is selec-
tive prosecution or a witch hunt; raise issues such as gay rights if the child victim 
is the same sex as the offender; and enlist the active support of parents, groups, 
and organizations. 
The investigator also must consider the possibility of physical violence. It would 
be a terrible mistake for any investigator or prosecutor to think that all child 
molesters are passive people who are easily intimidated. I am aware of several 
cases in which the arrested child molester was a paranoid survivalist with a mas-
sive arsenal of weapons and explosives. In addition there are cases in which child 
molesters murdered their victims, including their own children, to keep them 
from disclosing the sexual victimization. Two different child molesters who had 
each killed several of their child victims stated that the only way society could 
have prevented the murders would have been to legalize sex between adults and 
children. They claimed that they killed their victims only to avoid identification. 
After Conviction 
After being convicted and sentenced to incarceration, some pedophiles may 
exhibit another reaction. This involves asking to speak to law-enforcement inves-
tigators and claiming to have important information about more serious offenses 
against children. They might claim to know about organized child sex rings, child 
pornography, child prostitution, abduction of children, snuff films, satanic cults, 
or child murders. Some investigators are vulnerable to accept these claims 
because it is what they want or need to believe. Although this reaction is not as 
common as the others discussed here, there are numerous cases in which this has 
happened. In many of these cases the information furnished has turned out to be 
exaggerated, distorted, or patently false. Investigators have no choice but to 
investigate and check out such allegations because they might be partially or 
totally true. Investigators, however, must be skeptical and cautious in their 
response. Such stories should be carefully evaluated and assessed, and investiga-
tors should consider an early use of the polygraph by an examiner experienced in 
interviewing child molesters. 
Suicide 
One other reaction should also be anticipated in certain cases. An offender, espe-
cially from a middle-class background with no or one prior arrest, should be 
considered a high suicide risk at any time after arrest or conviction. The law-
enforcement investigator should be prepared to be blamed for the offender's death. 
Because "macho" investigators are supposed to laugh and joke about losing a 
"statistic" when a child molester commits suicide, some investigators are ashamed 
or embarrassed because they had positive feelings for the offender and did not 
necessarily want him to die. Investigators need to remind themselves that they 
were doing their jobs by enforcing the law and suicide was the offender's deci-
sion. The crucial issue for investigators is to try to ensure that the offender does 
not commit suicide while in their custody or kill or injure them or anyone else. 
A wide variety of criminals may react in similar ways when their activity is 
discovered or investigated. The reactions described above, however, have been 
seen in child molesters time and time again, particularly in preferential sex 
offenders.
