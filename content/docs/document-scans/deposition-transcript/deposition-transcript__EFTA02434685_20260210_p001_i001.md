I would have taken the checkride if you didn't start a fight. That's a fact. I had 3 short flights here 
in 2 weeks - that's I day of training on the ranch - and I am ready to take it. We wanted to 
schedule it for tomorrow but the examiner was not available so I will have to come back, do 
another flight with brad ,since I will not have flown for a week, and take the test on sunday. 
If you don't care where the food is bought why did you yell at me when I went shopping at publix 
and then you made up a rule that nobody is to buy food there for you again. 
brakes the rule and you reward it, I don't and you announce my granola is shit before you 
even open the box because it looks different than the publix granola you ate before. But I don't 
need to tell you; you have to see it..its so obvious, just think about your reactions

again you don't seem to understand the essence of what i am saying.. i DONT care where it is 
bought„ nor should you.. i want good quality. period„ your granola was shit„ did you taste it,did 
you taste MIK . it is that simple„ you serve me shit day after day„ i ask whether you tasted the 
disgusting toast. the answer was no„ though for at least 50 times I 've asked you not to serve me 
garbage that you haven't tried. 
i realize you will then say , but O tasted the pea soup and it was 
fine.. I have no opinion where the food is bought. i don't care„ it is the food .. i an not sure why 
you find this so difficult.. the food you have made recently and bought in the store , sperate from 
the saugage and peppers , is awful... period„ I would like to say thank you„ tell me for what. for 
you offering me a la mer mask to put on my face, for you admitting that the omelletes you made 
were even in your words , not good . no you chose to serve it to me„ the first one was not good, 
so you made it a little better and served it to me „ how crazy„ just say„ I can't do it„ would you 
like something else. , you tell me the only reason you didn't get your check ride in new mexico 
was that you had two days of arguing, its been two weeeks since you have been back„ no check 
ride„ just say It appears I AM not ready , as my e mail suggested„ trying to mask your 
incompetence , makes it much worse.. thank you

What's health foods? Are you talking about whole foods? 
I just spoke wither to see where she buys this special granola for you.. 
PUBLIX ! The greek yogurt and fruit she gives you - all from PUBLIX! And you tell ME I don't 
understand quality. I looked for a healthy granola at the best stores and actually spent time 
getting good food for you. You yell at ME without having any facts you assume the shit 
granola you had from 
must be top quality...just like Marina market eggs Lance was 
feeding you instead of
ti. When are you actually going to realize I put more effort into
