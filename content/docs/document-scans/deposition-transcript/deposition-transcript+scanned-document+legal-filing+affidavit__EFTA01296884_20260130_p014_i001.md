United States Courts Opinions: Supreme Court of New York: Neary v Burns US Official 
News April 1, 2014 Tuesday 
Burns further asserts that Benevento is not a member of 2784 LLC, but, rather, the 
member is the Estate of Julia. He argues that Benevento cannot claim a payment allegedly 
due to the Estate of Julia. He states that while Benevento is a co-executor of the Estate of 
Julia, he is not acting on behalf of the Estate with his brother, Anthony, who is the co-
executor. 
This argument by Burns is unavailing since Benevento is not making a claim on ralbehaff 
of the Estate of Julia, but in his own right as the holder of a beneficial interest of 9.2% of 
2784 LLC. Benevento does not seek to recover sums due to the Estate of Julia. Rather, he 
seeks to recover distributions from the sale of the 2784 premises owed to him individually 
which, he claims, Burns wrongfully withheld from him by making deductions to his share of 
such sale proceeds because he resides as a rent-stabilized tenant at the Neptune Avenue 
premises. This claim belongs to Benevento and is not shared by Anthony, the other 
beneficiary and the co-executor of the Estate of Julia, who is not a tenant at the Neptune 
Avenue premises and received his full share of such proceeds without any deductions. 
Thus, Benevento, and not the Estate of Julia, is the real party in interest in this 
litigation.Moreover, it is undisputed that Benevento is the transferee of one-half of the 
interest held by Julia, and, thus, the holder of a "beneficial interest" in 2784 LLC. Such a 
beneficial interest has been recognized as conferring standing upon a party to bring a 
derivative action on behalf of a corporation pursuant to Business Corporation Law § 626 
(a) (see Bernfeld v Kurilenko, 91 AD3d 893, 894 [2d Dept 2012]; Shui Kam Chan v Louis, 
303 AD2d 151, 152 [1st Dept 2003]), which has been held applicable to limited liability 
companies (see Tzolis v Wolff, 10 NY3d 100, 121 [2008]). While this is not a derivative 
action, this beneficial interest likewise furnishes a basis for Benevento's individual claims 
against 2784 LLC and Burns, and the fact that Benevento obtained his interest through the 
Estate of Julia does not deprive him of standing in this action (see Bernfeld, 91 AD3d at 
894). 
Furthermore, Burns previously recognized and acknowledged both Neary and Benevento 
as members of 2784 LLC. An e-mail by Burns dated February 9, 2009 (exhibit B to 
plaintiffs' opposition papers) stated that "the three Nearys . . . are direct owners" of 2784 
LLC. An e-mail by Burns dated February 22, 2010 (exhibit 6 to Burns' motion papers) 
regarding distributions sent to Neary and Benevento inquired as to "[h]ow do the Nearys 
want their checks" and whether they wanted "[o]ne to Mary Ann or 1/3 to each sib[ling]." 
Burns, in this e-mail, further inquired as to how he should distribute Julia's funds, noting 
that the checks would have to be made out to her Estate, and he asked whether he should 
issue two checks, or one each with the co-executors name also on the check. He 
additionally stated, in this e-mail, that he "only want[ed] to hear from members," that "title 
Nearys should elect if they want to vote as a group or individually," and that the 
Beneventos will have to decide themselves." By an e-mail dated February 24, 2010 
(exhibit C to plaintiffs' opposition papers), Neary responded that he wanted the check 
issued to him. 
Significantly, plaintiffs point out that Bums has already issued separate checks to them in 
payment of their distributions of the net sale proceeds, and that they are now simply 
complaining that they did not receive the full amount due to them. Burns, in paragraph 17 
of his attorney's affirmation in support of his motion, admits that plaintiffs have "received 
distributions." Thus, by such distributions, Bums has acknowledged Neary's membership
