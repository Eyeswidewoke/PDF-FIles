Just a follow up to our conversation yesterday - There has certainly been a= issue of timeliness with Alan and maybe a 
push from Karp changes that. As=l said to you yesterday, maybe Alan's client load needs to be narrowed to =nable him 
to service Leon Properly. We have questioned whether Alan is "sm=rt" enough and "well equipped" enough in terms of 
level of his planning ex=erience but, thinking more about what has transpired during the past sever=l months, I would 
like to suggest maybe we need to think about this a litt=e differently. 
Maybe the greater issue is difference of style. We knew Alan was a conserva=ive practitioner when we hired him. I 
believed that would be a complement =o your style but I am feeling like, instead, it has created conflict. Yes,=in a few 
cases, the 'delay' may have been a function of Alan not having se=n certain things done the way you've suggested 
(raising the issue of wheth=r he has sophisticated enough planning skills for a client like Leon) but =ore often, I believe, 
he was conversant but disagreed, and the delay was a=function of time spent by Alan to research further to decide 
whether he co=ld come around to agree with your plan. My observation would be that both =Ian and Ada are well able 
to hold there own when in debate with you which,=in itself, speaks well for both of them given the level at which you 
opera=e. I've told you previously that I am a great believer in a dialog of cons=ructive criticism getting a team to the best 
possible decision. Somehow, o=r dialogs just seem more painful for both sides than they need to be. I kn=w sometimes 
the dialog is necessary just for you to get Alan where he need= to be on a subject, and sometimes I think Alan knows he 
is waging a losin= battle. I think Ada and Alan are very similar stylistically. I may be on =hin ice here (without any legal 
background) but from my perspective, I'm n=t sure Alan brings a much higher level of expertise than we have with 
Ada.=lf we are going to pay for outside counsel that is something we should be =ooking for. 
Having just presented the thought that maybe the issue is style rather than=smarts, I must admit that the fact that the 
quality of drafting in the doc=ments we received for the new GRAT and related trusts has been lacking, we=can't dismiss 
the issue of "how well equipped". I know you said these are =he sorts of documents that should reflect Alan's longtime 
efforts to craft=a good document that is then ready to go when needed. You are the better j=dge, but it seems to me we 
did not have the same quality issues in the doc=ments we received in the planning steps earlier this year related to the 
s=bstitution, will, etc. 
To me, there is sort of a journey that you travel getting to a good working=relationship with Leon. I've traveled that 
path, and I see Ada doing that =urrently. Maybe Alan is just doing the same thing but I am not so sure. I =eel more like 
you and Leon should be deciding NOW whether you believe Alan=can service Leon's needs because, In my opinion, it is 
not fair to ask Ala= to rearrange his book of business for us if you already believe he is not=up to the job. I will tell you 
Alan has put tremendous effort into servici=g us and maybe a kick in the butt from Karp prompts Alan to move to the 
ne=essary level and this all works out fine. Personally, as a Manager, I've n=ver believed you are doing someone a favor 
by keeping them in a job they d=n't belong in. Maybe we need to consider moving on after this leg of the p=anning. I am 
not completely sure, I just know this is almost torturous. Af=er one of his recent meetings with Leon, Alan said to me "I
