The frustration now is the lack of wage increases -- =n obstacle that must be overcome both by raising the minimum 
wage and our corporations rewarding the increase in productivity among our workers...A0 Of course there's not been 
an encouraging word from the GOP, which opposes any increase in the federal minimum wage. =ln fact, their 2016 
frontrunner, Jeb Bush, does not think there should be a federal minimum wage. 
The GOP does not care to understand the late Senator =aul Wellstone's maxim, "We all do better when we all do 
better.&=uot; Increasing wages means more economic demand for more goods and services, and boosts the economy. 
Somehow, Republi=ans remain intent on cutting taxes for the already rich and devastating domestic spending. 
The House once again just proposed the "Ryan&=uot; budget full of unexplained and mysterious trillions of dollars in 
savings while cutting revenue, savaging domestic spending and proposing vouchers to purchase insurance instead of 
traditiona= Medicare. As Krugman writes, if it "were to become law, it would leave the federal government several 
trillion dolla=s deeper in debt than claimed, and that's just in the first decade."=/i> With the budget deficit radically 
dropping under President Obama and the increasingly better jobs reports, why would we believe these GOP austerity 
measures would help average families? We don't because they won't. Krugman again: "The simplest way to understand 
[the GOP budget proposals] is surely to suppose that they are intended to do wha= they would, in fact, actually do: 
make the rich richer and ordinary familie= poorer." 
They're also intent on misrepresenting the econom=c facts of the Affordable Care Act. Thanks to the ACA, 16.4 million 
previously uninsu=ed adults now have health care coverage under the ACA. The Brookings Ins=itution pointed out in 
March that "more than 4.2 million households, or 7.5 million people, are lik=ly to qualify for both the [Earned Income 
Tax Credit] and [ACA's] premium =ax credit" - - this in addition to improved, comprehensive health care coverage. Over 
the next 10 years, the Congressional Budget Office projected=the ACA will actually cost $109 billion less than previously 
anticipated. =And last year, the LA Times reported, "Insurance premiums are lower than anticipated, the Affordable Care 
Ac= will cost S9 billion less than previously estimated and the provision desig=ed to buffer insurance companies from 
risk will actually raise revenue, not function as any sort of federal government bailout." 
The Republican response to how the ACA is helping Ame=icans and heath care costs is to try to repeal it (56 times as of 
February) and attempt to hobble it with litigation. GOP presidential candidate, Senator Ted Cruz, who this week vowed 
to "r=peal every word of Obamacare," hypocritically receives health insurance for his family through the 
Federal="Obamacare" exchange. Are Republicans who control b=th houses of Congress interested in governing or will 
they remain stuck in their ideolog=cal corner? Their current approval rating of 11% does not seem to faze them, so the 
signs are not encouraging. In =n unprecedented move, 47 Senate Republicans just signed a letter deliberately 
undermining both our Presiden= and important allies' in the negotiation to halt nuclear arms prolifera=ion by Iran. So it 
looks like the facts be damned, the GOP has decided that the ideological corner is where they will remain. The voters 
will have a chance next year to change this. 
The reality is that under the Obama Administratio= the country's economy has blossomed immeasurably without 
inflation. Jobs have come =ack in almost every sector and although still depressed, for the first time in years wages are
