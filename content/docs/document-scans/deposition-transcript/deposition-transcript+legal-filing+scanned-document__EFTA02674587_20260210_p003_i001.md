THOMAS MANN: Yeah 
BILL MOYERS: ...named names and pointed fingers. You wrote, "The two parties are not equally to 
blame because the Republicans have become extreme both in," quoting you, "in terms of policy and 
process." And you're saying here today, a year later, that's still the case? 
THOMAS MANN: It's very much the case. Bill. We had no choice but to say it. It was in some ways, it 
was obvious if you if you look at the situation, and there is a body of scholarly research that has 
demonstrated this rightward march of the party, both among elected officials, but also rank-and-file 
Republicans. And the strongest, most extreme of those, the Tea Party people, have pulled the others 
back toward them. It's a reality, and it's not just ideological difference either. They begin with those 
differences, but then it's the strategic hyper-partisanship. what Norm referred to earlier: If Barack Obama 
is for something, we have to be against it because he's not a real American. 
NORMAN ORNSTEIN: Let me just offer a bit of a caveat here on two fronts. First, we're not saying 
Democrats are angels here. Plenty of flaws there. But I also hold out still some hope for the Senate. You 
have a number of Republicans in the Senate. and this has less to do with ideology than with focus. Are 
you there to solve problems, or are you there either to pursue a radical agenda or to gain political 
advantage? Everybody's going to look for political advantage. 
There are problem-solvers in the Senate. They are flawed ones, as we saw with the gun bill. You know, 
people like Lamar Alexander or Bob Corker, who joined with most of their colleagues. But I've talked to 
them when it comes to either reforming the nomination process, doing something in a larger fiscal sense 
that will include revenues, acting on immigration. I think you've got some opportunities here. Those 
opportunities will go to the House, and the only way they'll pass is with far more Democrats than 
Republicans. And they may not make it through. But we don't have a lost cause yet in the Senate. 
Now, the recent evidence is not great on that front. And the fundamental pathologies that we wrote about 
and talked about and we just felt an obligation that we'd built up some capital over the years. What's it for 
if you're not going to spend it now? 
BILL MOYERS: You riled the Republicans but you riled the press by talking about false equivalency. 
Their evenhanded treatment of decidedly uneven behavior on the part of the two parties, the equal 
treatment for true and false statements by advocates, equal weight to competing spin between opposing 
politicians and pundits without regard to the accuracy of either. You didn't get invited on the Sunday talk 
shows after that, did you? 
NOMAN ORNSTEIN: And still haven't been. 
THOMAS MANN: You noticed that? It's because those programs are predicated upon having spin from 
one side and then the other side. We're not the first to point out the, this artificial balance. I mean, 
reporters, good reporters do it partly out of a sense of professionalism, to be fair. To be wary of allowing 
your own personal political views to influence your writing. All of that is good. 
But now it's a safety valve. It keeps you from being charged as a partisan. It satisfies your producers, 
worried about advertising. And frankly, it's become really quite pernicious. We point out example after 
example in the book where they treat clearly unequal behavior as equivalent. 
NORMAN ORNSTEIN: You know it's not even that we weren't invited on the Sunday shows, it's the radio 
silence on the topic. So you mention 'The Washington Post" piece that appeared at right at the time that 
the book was published. And it just exploded on the scene, frankly; partly because of the title. which was 
"Let's Just Say It: Republicans Are the Problem". 
You know, within less than 24 hours after it was up unannounced on The Washington Post website, they 
had 5,000 comments. They stop counting after that. We got over 265,000 Facebook referrals; 1.5 million
