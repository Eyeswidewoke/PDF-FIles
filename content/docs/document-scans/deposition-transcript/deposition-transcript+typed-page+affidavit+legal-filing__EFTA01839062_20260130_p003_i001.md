There was a time not long ago, indeed up until the first decade of the 21" century, when 
surveillance often required a physical presence. Images of members of a surveillance team 
breaking into a home to plant a microphone, sitting in a parked van with earphones and cameras, 
climbing a telephone pole to install a tap, and following a man to a meeting place were burnished 
in the popular imagination by movies such as The Conversation, Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy, and 
The Lives of Others, all of which had a basis in reality. Now, however, with the proliferation of 
smart phones, credit cards, EZ passes, GPS trackers, emails, text messages, and CCTV cameras, 
such surveillance can be done from a remote location. When individuals use these ubiquitous 
devices, or are exposed to them, to make a call, go on the Internet, drive their cars through a toll 
bridge, pay an electronic bill, visit a social network, tweet. or share a photo, they leave a digital 
trail that can be reconstructed. Camera-equipped phones that locate the user via a rapid GPS 
signal, which were a rarity at the time of the attack on the World Trade Center in 2001, are now 
used by a large part of the population to phone, text, email, store voice mail, conduct Internet 
searches, pay bills, and organize their calendar of appointments. This data are routed through 
cyber space by a ganglia of Internet Service Providers, or ISPs, through global 
telecommunications companies. Once a security service acquires the ability to hack into the 
ganglia, it only needs to determine the phone number of a target to follow his every move, past 
and present, in cyber space. Nor is it an insurmountable challenge for even a second-rate 
intelligence service, if it is well funded, to obtain this capacity After Moammar Gadhafi's regime 
fell in 2011, documents found in Libyan intelligence by the Wall Street Journal revealed that 
AmiSys, a subsidiary of the French company Bull SA, had supplied Libyan Intelligence with its 
Eagle Interception System, which allowed Libyan intelligence to gain access through ISPs to the 
smart phones of a vast number of suspected dissidents and then, through special filtering 
software, intercept their emails, online chats and Facebook messages in what the company called 
"massive interception." If such off-the-shelf commercial products are readily available, it is not 
difficult to imagine what a first-class intelligence service can achieve in terms of remote 
surveillance. 
A former top executive of the National Security Agency said to me in 2011,"ff just twenty years 
ago a book described a world in which every citizen voluntarily carried around his own bug so 
Big Brother could listen to his conversation, it would be deemed science fiction, but now it is no 
longer fiction." He explained that since the smart phone contains all the elements necessary for 
surveillance, including a power supply, a microphone, GPS, and a continuous transmitter, "any 
security service can send it software codes that will turn it into a bug that monitors conversation 
even when the user believes it is turned off." A sophisticated target can of course take counter-
measures, such as removing the phone's battery when having a sensitive conversation. Even such 
a move in this game can be defeated by planting a hidden capacitor in his phone, which will act 
as a spare battery, although that requires physical control of the phone itself. 
Similarly, if a computer is connected to a network, a security services can remotely embed a 
program that will allow it to monitor all the key strokes a target makes on it. And with facial-
recognition program, a security service can follow a person's movements on networked CCTV 
cameras, which are already ubiquitous in some cities, such as London. As a result, much of what a 
person does, whether he realizes it or not, is time-stamped by a digital camera or cell phone.

encounter with a maid at the Sofitel, much of what occurred before and after was captured by
