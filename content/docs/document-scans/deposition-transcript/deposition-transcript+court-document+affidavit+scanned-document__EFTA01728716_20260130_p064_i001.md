Mixed Definitions 
Referring to the same thing by different names and different things by the same name 
frequently creates confusion. For example, the same 15-year-old individual Can be referred to as a 
baby,child,youthjuvenik,minor,adolescent,adult, or (as in one forensic psychological evaluation) 
underage adult. A father who coerces, a violent abductor, an acquaintance who seduces, a child-
pornography collector, or an older boyfriend can all be referred to as a child molester or pedophile. 
Terms such as sexual exploitation of children and youth or sexual exploitation of children 
and adolescents imply that a youth or an adolescent is not a child. At what age does a child become 
a youth or adolescent? If such a person is sexually victimized, is that considered youth molestation 
or sexual abuse of adolescents? 
There clearly can be a conflict between the law and society's viewpoint when it comes to 
defining a child. Many people using the term sexual abuse of children have a mental image of 
children 12 or younger. The main problem, therefore, is often with the 13- to 17-year-old age group. 
Those are the child victims who most likely look, act, and have sex drives like adults, but who may 
or may not be considered children under some laws and by society. There can be national, cultural, 
and ethnic variations in attitudes about who is a child. Pubescent teenagers can be viable sexual 
targets of a much larger population of sex offenders. Unlike one-on-one intrafamilial sexual abuse 
in which the victim is most often a young female, in many acquaintance sexual-exploitation cases 
the victim is a.boy between the ages of 10 and 16. 
Adolescents ere frequently considered and counted by child advocates as children in order 
to emphasize the large scope of the child-victimization problem. But then, little or nothing said or 
done about addressing the problem seems to apply to the reality of adolescent victims. If adolescents 
are considered child victims of sexual exploitation, then their needs, interests, and desires must be 
realistically recognized and understood when addressing the problem. 
Legal definitions of who is considered a child or minor vary from state-to-state and even 
statute-to-statute when dealing with adolescent victims. During a prosecution, the definition can 
even vary from count-to-count in the same indictment. The age of the child may determine whether 
certain sexual activity is a misdemeanor or felony and what degree felony. To legally determine who 
is a child, investigators and prosecutors turn to the law. That is, the penal code will legally define 
who is a child or minor. But they must still deal with their own perceptions as well as those of other 
professionals, juries, and society as a whole. In general, a child will be defined for this discussion 
as someone who has not yet reached his or her eighteenth birthday. One of the problems in using 
this broad, but sentimentally appealing, definition of a child is that it lumps together individuals who 
may be more unlike than alike. In fact 16 year olds may be socially and physically more like 26-
year-old young adults than like 6-year-old children.
