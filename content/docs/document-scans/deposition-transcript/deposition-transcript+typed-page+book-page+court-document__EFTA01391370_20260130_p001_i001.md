Risks Associated with Investing in the Access Fund. The Access Fund is an investment vehicle being 
formed to facilitate the investment of certain categories of investors into the Underlying Fund. The Access 
Fund's sole objective is to invest in the Underlying Fund and, other than such investment, the Access Fund 
is not expected to have any material operations. Substantially all of the capital contributions to the Access 
Fund will be contributed by the Access Fund to the Underlying Fund, and the Limited Partners will receive 
an indirect interest in the Underlying Fund. Because the sole purpose of the Access Fund is to acquire an 
interest in the Underlying Fund, all of the risk factors and disclosures of potential conflicts set forth in the 
Underlying Fund PPM will be relevant when considering an investment in the Access Fund. Therefore, 
prospective Investors must also carefully review the Underlying Fund PPM, including the more detailed 
and comprehensive summary of risks related to an investment in the Underlying Fund. 
In addition to the risks and conflicts of interest described in the Underlying Fund PPM, which generally 
apply to the Access Fund and the Interests, Investors should note, among other things, the Access Fund will 
be a newly formed entity (i) that will not be registered under the Investment Company Act, (ii) that will 
issue illiquid securities that are not registered under the Securities Act or any other laws, (iii) that will not 
register under the Exchange Act, (iv) the Interests of which will be subject to restrictions on transfer and 
will have no public market, (v) which will not be permitted to make full or partial withdrawals from the 
Underlying Fund pursuant to the terms of the Underlying Fund's governing agreement (except in very 
limited circumstances) and (vi) with respect to which, investors may lose the entire amount of their 
investment. 
In addition, there can be no assurance that the Underlying Fund will realize its rate of return objectives, will 
realize similar returns to past funds or investments sponsored by Glendower or its affiliates or will return 
any investor capital. The returns of the Access Fund will depend almost entirely on the performance of its 
investment in the Underlying Fund and there can be no assurance that the Underlying Fund will be able to 
implement its investment objective and strategy or avoid substantial losses. Certain ongoing operating 
expenses of the Access Fund, which will be in addition to those expenses borne by the Access Fund as an 
investor in the Underlying Fund (e.g., carried interest, management fees, Underlying Fund expenses, 
organizational expenses and other expenses and liabilities borne by investors in the Underlying Fund), 
generally will be borne by the Access Fund and the Limited Partners, resulting in Investors in the Access 
Fund paying multiple layers of expense that will have a corresponding impact on the returns to the Limited 
Partners. Such additional expenses of the Access Fund will reduce the Access Fund's performance relative 
to the Underlying Fund. Pending investment in the Underlying Fund, the Access Fund may invest a portion 
of its assets in short-term interest bearing accounts which would not meet the Underlying Fund's overall 
return objectives. 
Although the Access Fund will be an investor in the Underlying Fund, investors in the Access Fund will 
not themselves be limited partners of the Underlying Fund and will not be entitled to enforce any rights 
against the Underlying Fund or the Glendower GP or any of their affiliates, assert claims against the 
Underlying Fund, Glendower or their affiliates or have any voting rights in the Underlying Fund. An 
investor in the Access Fund will have only those rights provided for in the Partnership Agreement, and will 
not be permitted to attend the annual meeting of investors of the Underlying Fund. The General Partner is 
not the general partner or manager of the Underlying Fund. None of the Access Fund, the General Partner 
or any of their affiliates will take part in the management of the Underlying Fund or have control over its 
management strategies and policies. The Access Fund is subject to the risk of bad judgment, negligence, 
or misconduct of the general partner or manager of the Underlying Fund and its affiliates. There have been
