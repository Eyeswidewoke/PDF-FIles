network u=ing a computer or mobile device. The other benefit is that it outputs an an=logue signal which is required for 
the pre-amp and amplifiers. No extra cab=es required between the iMac and the audio system. 
If the aesthetics are an issue, we would r=commend a K-Array set up, which is club-grade and outdoor 
rated audio:

I do recommend running #12 or #10 wire to th= subs. You can also double up the #14 if that is easier. 
Also, on every spe=ker, best to plug up the parallel output with a Neutrik dummy plug to preve=t corrosion. Like this:

LS1 - Beach Area 
Same as=above, the location is using a surround sound receiver instead of a DSP pre=amp. The cabling is 
a bit odd. The Behringer is driving just one of the sub=. The second sub is not connected. The other large format 
speakers are bein= driven by the surround amp which is going to be 125Watts/channel, which is=low for these speakers. 
I wouldn't re-use any of that kit. I would recommend a SONOS c=nnect going in to some K-Array Amps 
and some K-Array speakers. These will b= much more attractive, powerful and will sound much better than the 
current=setup. 
L.S1 Theatre 
I saw some new 8k projectors at a trade show San Diego. They ranged in price from $18k to $450k= The 
$18k model I saw was so good, it would take a very trained eye to spot=the difference. It was supposed to be out in 
October, I'll have to c=eck on availability. The screen at LSJ is perfect for the 8k, although of c=urse we will have to wait 
for some 8k content, the 4k image is stunning and=a massive upgrade to the current projector. 
The Sub is quite slack and "flabby"= It sounds to me like all the low frequency sounds are the same. It 
would b= interesting to try one of our K-Array subs to see if it makes an appreciab=e difference. I think it will. If it 
doesn't sound great out of the=box, we'll have to check the DSP to make sure the signal being sent=is not flat and 
shaped for a subwoofer. 
GSJ - Various areas:<=b> 
The current location of the rack is not very well p=otected and managed. We discussed the concept of 
moving the Antenna pole to=the Manager's house and placing the Core Rack inside that building.=All connections would 
then come from this building. 
I recommend linking the Solar Area and Ma=n house to the Staff core with fibre. 
<=div> 
The pool can be covered by a wireless access point conn=cted by copper back to the staff core. 
=/div> 
The Beach Bar can connect to the Main House Rack over c=pper and local access points can be placed as 
needed. Audio can break out a= the beach pavilion as needed. Recommend local Technomad Chiton Amps in 
the=Pavilion that can handle the environment:

I recommend you run a dedicated 20A circuit for each Amp.</=iv>
