World Outlook 2016: Managing with less liquidity 
After remaining within a narrow band (0.Ipp) of zero for most of this year, 
inflation looks set to rise with base effects likely to add 0.6-0 7% by February. 
We expect CPI to average 1.1% in 2016 but it will probably still be shy of 1% at 
the time of the May inflation report. Evidence of rising inflation will be 
important to the BoE when it comes to deciding to tighten policy, as will 
improved prospects for wages and economic growth generally. Some on the 
Monetary Policy Committee would no doubt feel uncomfortable raising rates at 
the same time as having to explain the downside miss to its inflation target, 
but we do not expect this to stop the Bank from hiking. 
Should the Fed raise rates in December as we expect: then our call for the first 
BoE move in May looks reasonable based on past experience. The Bank is not 
governed by US policy — but there are numerous reasons we think the MPC 
will follow suit with a lag: i) globalisation has meant increased synchronisation, 
with both the BoE and Fed facing the same external conditions, ii) the UK is 
sandwiched between the tightening Fed and loosening ECB, iii) given the 
potential risks from a Fed move (particularly to EM), it seems reasonable for 
the BoE to wait given the UK's external sensitivity, and iv) in signaling the start 
of a hiking cycle a Fed tightening could push the dollar higher leaving the 
pound weaker (note our bearish sterling forecasts) — giving the BoE more 
room to cut.

The timing of UK rate rises could be impacted by the EU referendum. 
Currently the referendum bill is going through the upper house, where peers 
have amended the legislation which — if retained — would allow 16/17-year-
olds to vote. This is contentious, as younger voters are seen as more 
supportive of EU membership. Whether or not this amendment is upheld, 
allovvreg 16/17-year-olds to vote could delay the previously expected timing of 
the •,ote - either because of the time it takes to register the additional voters 
or because the bill goes back and forth before the elected Commons finally 
gets its way to drop the amendment. A pre-summer vote thus looks difficult 
(given the referendum cannot be held within four months of the bill being 
passed), with autumn more likely - if not into 2017. The Conservative Party's 
manifesto pledged a referendum before end 2017. 
A delay raises the risk that inward investment is not merely deferred but 
diverted to other countries. This could be particularly disruptive to growth 
given that the UK has the largest stock of inward investment globally outside
