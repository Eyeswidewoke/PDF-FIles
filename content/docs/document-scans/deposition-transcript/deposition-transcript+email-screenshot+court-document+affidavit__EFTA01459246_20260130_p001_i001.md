operational or other risks, and/or to reflect adjustments based upon our willingness to unwind all or part of your position or revenue tat has been generated but not yet recognized by DB ("Premium Adjustments"). Such Premium Adjustments will generally 
always decline over time. as DB's appetite to unwind at a premium will generally decfine over time, which will lead to lower valuations in the absence of changes in market oonditions. Valuations, including those containing Premium Adjusbnents, may not 
represent the terms at which new transactions c instruments could be entered into with DB or the tenns at which existing transacbons or instruments could be liquidated or unwound with DB. OB may change its valuation methodology and the related 
adjustments and assumpbons at any time. so Mal future valuations may be less favourable than the current ones, even in the absence of an adverse development in market crindillans. Valuations based on ddferent assumpbons or calculated using other 
methodologies may also yiekl different results and any adjusbnents may not apply for the duration of the transaction or instrument. Any subsequent valuabons provided to you will almost certainly differ from this valuation. This difference can be less favourable to 
you. and due to the volatility ot market conddions, the size or nobonal amount of the decrease or increase and other factors. the differential could be substanbal. DB shall not be lieble tor any errors or omissions made in calculabng or disseminating valuations. or 
for any inaccuracies or flaws in the methodologies. adjustrnents of assumpbons. DB specifically disclaims liability for any losses or damages (incidental. conseouential or otheiwise) that may arise from valuations Met are either used or relied upon by you or any 
other party for any reason including, without limitabon, your use of valuations in preparabon of your own financial books and records.
