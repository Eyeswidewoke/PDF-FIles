If you have Plan Shares in the Savings and Retirement Plan and own other Shares (either in your possession or held by a 
brokerage firm) outside of the Savings and Retirement Plan, you will receive two or more sets of Offer materials. You 
should be careful to follow the directions that apply to each kind of Shares. 
9. Who will know whether I tendered my Plan Shares? 
Your directions to the Trustee are CONFIDENTIAL. Individual instructions will only be disclosed to the recordkeeper as 
necessary to complete the tender. 
10. Can I change my mind and direct the Trustee to withdraw my Plan Shares that I directed to be tendered? 
Yes, but only if you perform the following steps: 
-- You must send a signed notice of withdrawal to the Administrative Committee for the Savings and Retirement Plan, 82 
South Street, Hopkinton, MA 01748-9918. 
-- The notice of withdrawal must be in writing. You may fax your notice of withdrawal to the Administrative Committee 
for the Savings and Retirement Plan at fax number (508) 787-2651. 
-- The notice of withdrawal must state your name, social security number, the number of Plan Shares that you wish to 
withdraw from the Offer and that you are directing the Trustee to withdraw Plan Shares that you previously directed the 
Plan Trustee to tender on your behalf. 
-- The notice of withdrawal must be received by the Administrative Committee before 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on 
Thursday, May 27, 1999.

11. Can I direct the Trustee to re-tender my Plan Shares? 
Yes. If, after directing the Plan Trustee to withdraw your Plan Shares, you wish to direct the Trustee to re-tender your 
Plan Shares, you must complete another Tender Instruction Form and return it to the Administrative Committee for 
receipt by 5:00 p.m. on Thursday, May 27, 1999. You may obtain another copy of the Tender Instruction Form by faxing 
your request to (508) 787-2651. 
12. Will I still be entitled to receive the forthcoming regular, quarterly dividend on the Shares that I tender? 
Shares which are sold to the Company pursuant to the Offer will not be entitled to receive the next regular, quarterly 
dividend. However, if the Company does not buy all of the Shares which you directed the Trustee to tender, the 
Company will return the unpurchased Shares to the Trustee, and your Account will be entitled to receive the next 
dividend on those Shares. 
13. Will I be entitled to receive shares of Limited Too in the Limited Too spinoff for the Shares I tender in the offer? 
Shares which are sold to the Company pursuant to this Offer will not participate in the Limited Too spinoff. However, if 
the Company does not buy all of the Plan Shares that you directed the Trustee to tender, the Company will return the 
unpurchased Shares to the Trustee, and your Account will be entitled to receive shares of Limited Too in the Limited Too 
spinoff with respect to the returned Shares.
