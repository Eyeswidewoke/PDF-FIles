So the next step in the evolution of money is the use of money that is backed 
by metal such as gold or silver, but itself takes on paper form. The origins 
of this paper money are the warehouse receipts that we just talked about. 
Those receipts are receipts given by depositors for the precious metals that 
their customers left or their temple worshipers left in their possession. The 
warehouse receipts began to function as money, not when the metal was 
deposited. but when third parties traded them for commodities rather than 
withdrawing their deposits. Let's think of an example here. 
So, I have deposited, kt us say some gold, at my temple. I have received a 
paper receipt. I now, say weeks later, wish to make a purchase for my home. 
I go to the individual who is going to sell me what I desire, and instead of 
first going back to the temple to get the gold, I simply present my warehouse 
receipt. I, in a sense, sign it over to the person from whom I am buying. When 
that third party, the person who is selling me goods, takes my warehouse 
receipt and thinks of it as her own, or his own, that is when those receipts 
begin circulating as money. 
Marco Polo found money printed on mulberry bark in China in the 13th 
century. In the west, London goldsmiths gave receipts for gold deposited 
with them, and those receipts functioned as money in the I7th century. The 
use of paper money lowered exchange costs since it was a heck of a lot easier 
to exchange warehouse receipts than the actual deposits. For one thing, the 
receipts were for a particular quality and quantity of gold, and the receipt 
actually said that. If you handed over the gold, you would have to weigh and 
it and assay it again. 
Ah. and here is a very subtle, but very, very important step in the evolution. 
Think about the people who are managing the depository: the London 
goldsmith. We will talk about that London goldsmith in detail in another 
lecture, but let's just get a highlight. Those goldsmiths soon realized that 
they could make loans to new parties by issuing new warehouse receipts. 
The scheme worked because on any given day, only a very small fraction 
of the people who had deposited gold with those goldsmiths actually tried 
to get it back. So, here we are with money as gold or silver or copper coins. 
But we know that that is not our money today, so what happened? The final 
demise of the gold standard, according to Angelo Redish, occurred in 2 
30 
steps. In August 1971, United States President Nixon temporarily suspended 
the convertibility of the U.S. dollar into gold and made that suspension 
permanent in 1973. 
So we come then, to the final step in the evolution of money from barter 
where there is no money, through commodity money, through gold coins, 
to fiat money; money that is valuable by fiat. It is valuable because the 
government declares that it is valuable. So. let's do a kind of experiment 
here. Pause for a minute, reach into your pocket, and take out a dollar bill. 
This is a little bit like a scavenger hunt. Search on that bill for evidence 
that that bill is not just money, you knew that, but fiat money. You're doing 
it? Well, you will not have to search for long before you find the words, 
•"This note is legal tender for all debts, public and private." Folks, that is the 
clear declaration that our money, the U.S. dollar, is valuable because the U.S. 
Government says it is. 
In 1844, the Bank of England established a rigid link between the amount 
of paper money in circulation and the gold reserves of the Bank of England. 
This meant that the supply of money in England would fluctuate with the 
gold reserves of the bank and with the availability• of gold in general. For 
example, discoveries of gold in the new world led to rising prices of goods in 
terms of gold. As gold became more plentiful, its value decreased. 
It was typical for the next 130 years for western economies to back their 
paper money with gold. In most cases, paper money was convertible. 
Holders of the paper money could demand gold in exchange at a rate set by 
the government. So they could bring their paper money to the government 
and get the predefined amount of gold whenever they wished. Ah, ha. But in 
times of national emergencies, obviously World War 1 and then again, World 
War II, nations, United Kingdom among them, abandoned the gold standard, 
and it suspended the convertibility of their currencies into gold. Why would 
they do that? 
Well, suspending convertibility allowed nations to finance some of the 
costs of the war by issuing more currency than their gold stocks would 
have previously permitted. They wished to buy more munitions, buy more 
soldiers, and buy more of all the other war goods that were required, and they
