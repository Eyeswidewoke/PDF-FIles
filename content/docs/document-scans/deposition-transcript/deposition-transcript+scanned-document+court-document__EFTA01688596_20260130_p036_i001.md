(Continued) 
10, 2006, at approximately 2:30 p.m., I served 
at her residence in 
Royal Palm Beach. The subpoena was given to her mother, Ill. 
I learned through one of the victims III that she was personally 
contacted through a source that has maintained contact with Epstein. 
The source assured E 
she would receive monetary compensation for her 
assistance in not cooperating with law enforcement. • 
also stated 
she was told, "Those who help him will be compensated and those who 
hurt him will be dealt with." I told III, that tampering with a 
witness/victim is an arrestable offense and very serious. I asked her 
who approached her during this encounter. III originally was reluctant 
to provide the name of the person who approached her to offer her not 
to testify because she felt they were still friends. 
On April 11, 2006, Det 
and I traveled to Tallahassee, Florida 
and met with the victim, 
III identified 
W/F, 
as the person w o approached her in Ro a Pa m Beach while 
lso stated she 
did not want to pursue the intimidation charges on

s e was ome during Spring Break in March 2006. 
concerned that the defense attorney was given a copy o. the report as 
certain things she had told me in confidence were repeated to her by 
Illitena for the Grand Jury which was scheduled to commence April 18, 
Prior to our departure, the victim was given a copy of her 
2006. 
Upon our return from Tallahassee, I notified the State Attorney's 
Office of what was told to me. I also notified them that the 
subpoenas were delivered to the witnesses and they would be calling 
for arrangements for the date and time needed for the Grand Jury. I 
spoke with ASA 
and informed her of the possible intimidation by 
the defense. 
On April 13, and April 14, 2006 I atte ted contact on several 
occasions with ASA 
and ASA 
to ascertain when the 
victims needed to report for Gran JUry testimony. Messages were left 
on their voicemail. On April 17, 2006, durin the hours of 9:00 am 
and 11:30 am, I again left messages for ASA 
and ASA 
for either of them to return my call as I ha not heard frilitTlite 
Attorney's Office as to the time and date of the Grand Jury. 
At approximately 12:30 pm, I went to the State Attorney's Office and 
and ASA 
in their offices. I entered ASA 
ootr 
e explained that an offer was made to the defense, Atty 
ice who in orme me that she was going to returniiiii
and Atty Alan Dershowitz. The offer is 1 count of Agg 
Assault with intent to commit a felony, five years probation, with 
adjudication withheld. Epstein would have to submit to
