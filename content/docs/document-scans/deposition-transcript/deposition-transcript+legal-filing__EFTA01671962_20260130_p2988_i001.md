Calculating 
APRs and DPRs 
The Annual Percentage Rate (APR) for variable rates is determined by adding an amount (margin) 
to the Prime Rate (see Determining the Prime Rate in Part 2). The Daily Periodic Rate (DPR) is 
1/365th of the APR. rounded to one ten-thousandth of a percentage point.

• your payment is returned by your bank. 
the Penalty APR is applied. The Penalty APR will 
continue to apply until you have made timely 
payments with no returned payments during the 
6 months being reviewed. 
Penalty APR for 
existing balances 
If you do not pay at least the Minimum Payment Due within 60 days after its Payment Due Date, we 
can apply the penalty APR to those balances it does not already apply to. After you pay on time for 
6 billing periods in a row, the penalty APR will no longer apply to those balances (but it may still 
apply to other balances as described above). 
Fees 
Annual Membership 
This fee is on the Rates and Fees Table on page 1 of Pad 1. We will charge $35 for up to 5 
additional cards, then $35 for each additional card thereafter. 
Late Payment 
Up to $35 or 2.99% of the amount past due. If you do not pay the Amount Due on a billing 
statement before the 10th day after the next Closing Date, the fee is $25. If this happens again 
within the next 6 billing periods, the fee is $35 instead. In both cases, if you do not pay the amount 
past due by the following Closing Date, we will charge, in that same billing period, the greater of 
$35 or 2.99% of the amount past due. For each subsequent billing period that an amount past due 
remains unpaid, the fee is the greater of $35 or 2.99% of any amount past due. However, the late 
fee will not exceed the Minimum Payment Due. Paying late may also result in a Penally APR. See 
Penalty APR for new transactions and Penalty APR for existing balances above. 
Returned Payment 
Up to $35. If your payment is returned unpaid the first time we present it to your bank, the fee is 
$25. If this happens again within the next 6 billing periods, the fee is $35. However, the returned 
payment fee will not exceed the Minimum Payment Due on the last Payment Due Date before the 
payment is returned. A returned payment may also result in a Penalty APR. See Penalty APR for 
new transactions above. 
Returned Check 
$38 if you use your card to cash a check at one of our approved locations and the check is returned 
unpaid. We will also charge you the unpaid amount. 
Statement Copy
