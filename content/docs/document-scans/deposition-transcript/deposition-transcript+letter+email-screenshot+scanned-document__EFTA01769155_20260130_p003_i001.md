shift from previous governments, which have refused to negotiate with r=bels, and show the current government's 
willingness to accept a nego=iated end to the conflict with Colombia's largest insurgency groups.=o:p> 
Central =merica: Central America continues to struggle to contain drug smug=ling from South America into the United 
States. In March, the Catholic Chu=ch in El Salvador arranged an accord between the country's tw= largest gangs, the 
Mara Salvatrucha and Barrio 18. As the truce passed th= 100-day mark, murders have dropped from fourteen a day in 
March to five a=day in June. The gang leaders have indicated they are ready for talks to m=ke the peace pact 
permanent. On June 27, a Guatemalan court sentenc=d 36 suspected members of a powerful Mexican drug cartel to 
prison for var=ous crimes, including dismembering a state prosecutor who was investigatin= the gang. In Honduras, U.S. 
Drug Enforcement Administration agents=killed several suspected Honduran drug traffickers in recent counter-narco=ics 
operations. This visible American presence is controversial as it unde=scores the issue of national sovereignty as U.S. 
participation in these op=rations in Central America increases.

Middle East and North Afr=ca 
Egypt: Egypt's stock market is serving as an accur=te barometer of the level of political tension during the nation's 
h=storic political transition. On June 30, Muslim Brotherhood-backed candida=e Mohamed Morsi was sworn in as 
Egypt's first freely-elected Preside=t. The stock market, when it reopened the following Monday, July 2, hit a =ine-year 
high. Subsequently, when President Morsi ordered the Parliament&#=212;which was dissolved by the military based on 
a Constitutional Court ru=ing—to reconvene on July 8, the market tumbled 4.2 percent to a thre=-week low. The 
International Monetary Fund (IMF) welcomed Morsi's el=ction and once a government is formed is ready to finalize a 
$3.2 billion =oan. To access this and other multilateral financing and close the estimat=d $12 billion funding gap, the 
Muslim Brotherhood will have no choice but =o accept that these loans come with interest and will have to reconcile 
th=s fact with its position that interest on loans contradicts Islamic law. E=yptian foreign currency reserves stood at 
approximately $15.5 billion at t=e end of June compared to roughly $36 billion (before the January 2011 upr=sing). The 
Central Bank is expecting only 2 percent growth in 2012, down f=om 2.5 percent in 2011. 
Syria 
Tu=isia: The political struggle between Salafists, moderate=lslamists, and others continues in Tunisia. Examples include 
the recent=turmoil over prayer space and the wearing of the niqab (veil) by women whi=h occurred on the campus of 
Manouba University outside Tunis and riots in =he capital that forced the government to impose a curfew on a few 
major ci=ies for several days in mid-June. In addition, reflecting concerns of r=gional spillover, the spokesperson for the 
Tunisian government urged cleri=s to stop inciting young people to join the revolutionary fighting in Syri=. On the 
economic front, the economy is rebounding. Tourism revenue increa=ed by 36.2 percent in the first five months of 2012. 
According to the IMF,=growth is estimated to reach 2.2 percent in 2012 with a forecast of 3.5 pe=cent growth in 2013. 
Foreign investment has increased by 19 percent, altho=gh unemployment, the main economic factor behind the revolts 
last year, re=ains high (18 percent). Prime Minister Hamadi Jebali announced that the go=ernment will add 75,000 jobs 
in 2012. Gradual economic recovery appears=likely, although the European financial crisis could dampen foreign 
invest=ent.
