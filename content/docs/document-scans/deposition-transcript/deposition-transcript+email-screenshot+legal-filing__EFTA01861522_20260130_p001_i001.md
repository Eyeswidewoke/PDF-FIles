Oh also ... Not proposing any solid waste or even bringing that up in Senegal. 
I only told you about solid waste stuff BC I thought you would be proud!! Its our Asian approach and I'm 
just not sure how to crack of on Africa yet... 
Not sure what to do about Dakar if you are saying the foundation is unwelcome because there are two 
teams there already (not me) working and expanding in Dakar. 
I have marching orders in terms of areas for grantmaking. Some flexibility with regard to geography so if 
you have suggestions, happy to explore. 
Have you talked to bill about colonialism etc? Maybe you can help change things or convince him to 
approach things differently? Or do yo think he gets it and its just the implementation that's wrong?

no chance, 
the attitude that westerners know what is right for the people is at the heart of the 
problem. I am aware of the mayor issues, and you have it 90 percent wrong it is not an anti 
coloniast vision, you misunderstand, you have also told me there was a 173 million dollars in 
rev , from your waste project. I have yet to sec anything that approaches even 5.. Please be 
careful.. you are taleneted and smart. -- bad numbers, unwanted ideas. are not good combos.. I 
can talk whetter you want.

Sorry it's taken a while to get back online. Sometimes tough out here in Africa. 
Well I can certainly sympathisize with that sentiment and I hate the thought of any of our foundation work 
being anything but demand driven. 
So hopefully your friend(s) would be wiling to take the time to discuss their wants/concems etc with me so 
that we can put that whole thing to rest - I am happy to hear any and all ideas. Unfortunately, sometimes I 
can't find a fit for ideas since we do have strategic constraints laid out by Bill. I think Bill would be sad to hear 
that anyone thought he was a colonialist! 
There are some things that I am not sure you are aware of, and I only note them as a caution in interpreting 
statements by the son of the president. First. the son of the president hates the mayor of dakar and has tried 
multiple times to push him out or at least really shred his reputation. Your friend ran for mayorial office 
against him and lost in a landslide election. Big time. The current mayor is the only elected opposition leader 
in the whole country and there are serious rumblings from the streets that your friend and his father are the 
next African government to be toppled. Folks think it is the mayo r of Dakar that is fomenting this. So 
anything viewed as successful in Dakar is typically quashed or at least threatened. Finding a balance 
between doing what is right by the people and avoiding politics is challenging. 
I think your friend may also be speaking out of both sides of his mouth also since he has accepted and
