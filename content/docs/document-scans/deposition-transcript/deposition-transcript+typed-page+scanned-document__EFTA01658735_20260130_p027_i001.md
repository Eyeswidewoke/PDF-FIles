hospitals, exhausting health-care providers and raising fears that the region's medical system 
will be completely overwhelmed in the coming days." Experts "say that cases are surging in the 
region as the weather has turned colder and more people are forced inside - into more poorly 
ventilated indoor spaces where transmission thrives - with the virus arriving even in remote 
areas in largely conservative states where Republican leaders have resisted mask mandates or 
business closures, asking their residents to rely instead on personal responsibility." In 
Minnesota, Gov. Tim Walz (D) "has warned of more `nightmare' numbers to come, even as the 
state has instituted new restrictions on bars, restaurants and social gatherings in an attempt to 
stop the spread." NBC Nightly NewsVi (11/12, story 2, 1:40, Holt, 4.9M) reported that in 
Michigan, "officials warn the state's healthcare system could soon capsize amid a nearly five 
fold surge in COVID hospitalizations since just last month. ... Hospitals throughout the state are 
understaffed and overwhelmed, with cases and hospitalizations doubling every two weeks." 
North Dakota Nurses Association Reject Policy Allowing COVID-Positive 
Employees To Continue Working. The Hill (11/12, Weixel, 2.98M) reports that in a 
statement on Wednesday, the North Dakota Nurses Association rejected "a policy that would 
allow COVID-positive nurses to continue treating patients at coronavirus units of hospitals and 
nursing homes if they are not symptomatic." They association "said the policy does not address 
the root of the problem and called for a statewide mask mandate and other public health 
measures to be implemented first." On Monday, Gov. Doug Burgum (R) announced the policy 
"as a way to ease pressure on hospitals that are short-staffed and nearing capacity, as COVID-
19 cases surge uncontrollably throughout the state." North Dakota "is currently the worst-hit 
state in the country in terms of coronavirus cases per 100,000 residents, but is one of 15 states 
without a mask mandate." 
Chicago Mayor Issues Stay-At-Home Advisory. 
Reuters (11/12, Caspani, O'Brien) reports Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot (D) "issued a stay-at-
home advisory and Detroit stopped in-person schooling on Thursday to staunch the coronavirus 
outbreak as more than a dozen states reported a doubling of new COVID-19 cases in the last 
two weeks." Lightfoot "on Thursday issued a 30-day advisory calling upon residents to stay at 
home and have no visitors, even during Thanksgiving festivities." According to Reuters, Illinois 
"has emerged as the pandemic's new epicenter in the region as well as across the country." 
Bloomberg (11/12, Singh, 4.73M) reports Lightfoot's advisory urges "residents to avoid 
leaving home except for work, school and other essentials as new Covid-19 cases and 
hospitalizations surge." The restrictions "will take effect on Monday and stay in place for 30 
days, or until the health commissioner changes it. If the city continues on the current path, at 
least 1,000 more Chicagoans could die from the virus by the end of the year, Lightfoot said 
during a press conference on Thursday." 
CNN (11/12, Parks, Jones, Jimenez, Asmelash, 83.16M) reports on its website that 
Lightfoot said in the release, "The gains we have made this past year have been the result of 
our willingness to work together. Even in this difficult moment, we will continue to unite as we 
always have for our city in order to halt the rise we're seeing, shake out of the fatigue we've 
been experiencing, and make the crucial difference in what our future is going to look like." 
The Chicago Tribune (11/12, Munks, Pratt, 2.65M) reports that at a coronavirus briefing 
on Thursday, Gov. J.B. Pritzker (D) said, "If things don't take a turn in the coming days, we will 
quickly reach the point when some form of a mandatory stay-at-home order is all that will be 
left. ... With every fiber of my being, I do not want us to get there. But right now, that seems 
like where we are heading." 
The Chicago Sun-Times (11/12, 875K) says "more people have contracted the virus in 
Illinois over the past 15 days - nearly 140,000 - than during all of summer." Of "all 536,542 
people who have tested positive in Illinois so far during the eight-month pandemic, almost half 
of them have been diagnosed just since the beginning of October alone."
