George: But there's still, then, the question. =e have and have always had in the world what we'll call policing. The 
Brit=sh did it in India, the United States did it in Nicaragua and the Philippines. Most major countries and many min=r 
countries did it. To me, the interesting argument that's underway, and t=e one that's least tenable, is the argument that 
this is the way war will =lways be from now on. We heard that all wars will be nuclear wars, we've heard that all wars 
will be coun=erinsurgencies, all wars will be small. To me, I don't accept the idea tha= the peer-to-peer war has been 
abolished, that the 21st century will be th= first century that will have no major systemic war between two great 
powers. 
Robert: Well, look, every century before, going=back thousands of years, has had the equivalent of interstate war. So to 
c=aim that this century automatically won't doesn't stand up statistically, in any sense of the word. I mean, the Iran=lraq 
war, which I covered firsthand as a journalist, was like World War I.=You would see hundreds of bodies piled up, killed 
by poison gas, on the Ir=qi side. They were Iranian bodies. Saddam Hussein used chemical weapons left, right and 
center. And this was =nly 25.30 years ago. So to think that we're not going to have interstate w=rs, given the tensions in 
the Middle East, given the buildup of weapons in=the Far East, I mean we haven't even talked about the growth of 
various naval platforms throughout the Pac=fic, not just in China. It seems to me very questionable. 
George: I want to apply the new math, which we =ave seen obviously in Afghanistan, for example, to peer-to-peer 
conflict. =o for example, it strikes me as questionable whether surface vessels are survivable. We know that in the Arab-
Israeli W=r of 1973, tanks facing wire-guided Soviet-built anti-tank systems, were b=ing destroyed by infantrymen. And 
we learned that there was an entirely ne= matrix to the war. One of the things that it seems to me is that we're going to 
see interstate war, but =ith the same sparseness of forces. 
Robert: And without even journalists able to co=er it, because you mentioned that surface warships are more and more 
vulne=able. What that means is that the face of naval warfare is going under water. It's going under sea. 
George: Assuming that submarines are survivable= 
Robert: Yes. Well, there's a saying in the Paci=ic: The submarines are like the new bling; everybody wants one. 
George: But, I mean, the question to really ask=is, we have anti-submarine rockets. We have anti-submarine torpedoes. 
We h=ve an entirely new generation of weapons. A submarine can run at 30 or 40 knots; a surface vessel can do 20, 30 
knot=. You have missiles coming out that are hypersonic, doing certainly Mach 3= Mach 4. You can't run from it, you 
can't hide from it. There were three g=eat platforms that emerged from World War II: the main battle tank, the aircraft 
carrier and the manned bo=ber. It's very hard to imagine how a manned bomber survives in an environm=nt of surface-
to-air missiles, or how a tank survives, or how a ship survi=es. And I include in that submarines because as much as you 
are hidden under water to my eyes, there are many t=chnologies that can find you. So it really becomes an interesting 
question=of how war is framed, what sea-lane control means, and so on and so forth,=that's evolving. 
Robert: We haven't had a test yet of these thin=s. The 21st century so far, as violent as it has been in the Greater Middl= 
East, in Afghanistan and Iraq, presently in Syria, has not had the kind of test that you're pointing at. 
George: World War II. Many of these systems hav= appeared in World War I and afterwards. But in many ways people 
were surp=ised at the emergence of the aircraft carrier, at the criticality of the tank, certainly by the massed manned 
bo=ber. There was speculation about it, and then it emerged. So I would argue=that first, we've had a revolution in 
warfare. Two, we've seen it applied =n Afghanistan, in that morally difficult and ambiguous state. When it's supplied in 
the state-to-state co=flict, which I expect to happen whether we want it or not -- I mean, it's =ot that everybody said, 
"Let's have a war"; wars seem to happen =or their own reasons -- we're going to see emerging, exactly as you said, an 
entirely new structure. 
Robert: This is why what's going on in the East=China Sea and the South China Sea is very interesting in this sense. 
Becau=e you see a buildup of naval platforms in a part of the world of vibrant states that are not united by an allianc= in
