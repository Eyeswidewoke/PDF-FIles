The Whitesides Lab 
Probably half of my work comes from George's group, both in terms of patenting and 
licensing. The way I've worked it out with George is that he just sends me every manuscript at 
the time he sends it off to a journal. These are triaged in terms of filing patent applications. 
Some are commercially relevant; for these, I make contact with the lead author since George is 
often not available, and I make decisions about filing. Others, such as review papers, are not 
commercially relevant. For those in the middle I email George for his opinion—he is very 
honest. 
The Lab Organizational Structure 
There is nothing unique about what we do. If you asked me what the most unusual characteristic of the 
research group was, I would put my emphasis on the people. I have no doubt that the creative center of the 
group is the students. In this respect we are very different from alt those university research groups which are 
focused on the leading idea of one professor, one student, one idea, or one thesis. 
—Professor George Whitesides 
Whitesides' approach to managing the lab emphasized collaboration and teamwork. There was a 
lot of "cross-pollination" and mobility across groups within the lab. As Weibel described the culture, 
This group gets along phenomenally well for a group that is full of very bright, very 
ambitious people who come from lots of diffeient backgrounds. This group is designed in a 
way that there are no conflicts with people doubling up on projects and competing with each 
other. People are really open to speaking to each other. And it is very easy to weed out bad 
ideas if you are talking to people about them. I find that absolutely invaluable. 
A research lab organization with a flat structure in which group members help each other on their 
projects did not need a lot of guidance. "I don't do any hand-holding," noted Whitesides. "Most of 
the meetings we have are meetings in groups. We have group seminars and we also have subgroup 
seminars. I talk to groups about specific problems, but since these projects are all collaborative, there 
are usually not a lot of reasons to talk to students individually. Students are very much on their own 
within the group to find resources within the group which can help them to solve things. I think what 
most of them say is that probably the thing they find most useful about being in a group is getting to 
know all the people." This flat structure pushed much of the responsibility to postdocs and doctoral 
students. Weibel noted, 
I had a meeting with George as soon as I joined the lab. He asked me what my goal in life 
was and what I wanted to do. We really didn't talk about research specifically. At a second 
meeting, I told him I was interested in energy. And he said, "Why don't you go build a fuel 
cell?" That was it. And that's pretty much the only direct command (or one of few) I've ever 
gotten from him on research. 
The lab members admired Whitesides both for his research contributions and for what they 
learned from him. Lara Estroff, a postdoc, recalled: 
During the first month I was at the lab I met with George. He told me he was going to teach 
me how to be creative. His favorite line is that the best projects are those that you can think up 
one night in the shower, get into the lab the next day and in two weeks have all the 
experiments done and then get it on the cover of Science. I don't know if this has ever actually 
happened, but I think I have learned to force myself to think about how to make it happen. 
George has an unlimited supply of ideas and he has a sense of which direction to go. This is 
part of his continued influence on the lab.
