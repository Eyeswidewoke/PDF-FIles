A minor royal wedding - but no showboating romance; Princess Eugenie, youngest 
daughter of Sarah Ferguson and Prince Andrew, has coped with her share of scandal and 
strife. Her wedding to long-term boyfriend Jack will bring her a 'pillar of support,' writes 
Julia Molony Sunday Independent August 26, 2018 
As details of their wedding emerge, there have been grumbles from some circles about the 
scale and ambition of the plans. After all, Eugenie is only a minor royal, and undertakes no 
official duties. Nor is she paid from the privy purse. In 2016 it was reported that Prince 
Andrew had put a request to the Queen that his girls be brought on to the payroll, but it 
was turned down. 
Yet Eugenie seems to be grasping her moment in the spotlight with both hands. When she 
and Brooksbank wed, the ceremony will be held at Windsor Castle and 1,500 members of 
the public will be invited into the grounds. Eugenie, observed one acidic commentator, is 
going for the "full-throttle, trumpet-tootling extravaganza, complete with all the royal 
trimmings". But will the world care when "Princess Nobody takes Joe Soap to be her lawful 
wedded hubs"? Despite the grand ceremony, Eugenie cannot hope to command anywhere 
near the attention that was lavished on her cousin, Prince Harry, and his new bride at their 
wedding earlier this year. But her seven-year relationship with Brooksbank is no 
showboating romance. It seems that Eugenie has quietly been building a solid and stable 
relationship to carry her through the pressures of life in the public eye. 
For someone so young, 28-yearold Eugenie already knows a thing or two about crises. 
Her parents, warm but hapless, have both invited calamity into their lives more than once. 
It seems strange to suggest that in them, Eugenie has an enviable role-model for solid 
partnership. And yet, despite their flaws and the failure of their own marriage, Fergie and 
Andrew share a friendship that many long-married couples might envy. Through 
bankruptcy, scandal, and disgrace they have never flagged in their commitment to each 
other and to their girls. Loyalty, above all, and forgiveness appear to be the abiding 
principles that hold them together. 
'We've been through some incredibly stressful times together as a family," Eugenie's older 
sister Beatrice told Hello magazine recently, springing to her mother's defence, "and every 
single minute she created joy. I am so lucky that I get to learn from her every single day. 
I'm inspired by her ability to give, even when she's going through something hard." 
Like Eugenie and Jack, Fergie and Andrew grew up together. They'd been friends in 
childhood, and were first photographed in each other's company at a polo match, then 
both aged 10. Sarah Ferguson remembers sneaking away from sporting events to "play 
tag with like-minded truants - including Prince Andrew, who was just my age". They fell out 
of touch, but were re-introduced as adults by Princess Diana, who invited Sarah to a party 
at Windsor Castle where Prince Andrew was present. Although Prince Andrew later said 
that "it was at Ascot that the whole thing took off'. They married in 1986 after a sixmonth 
engagement. 100,000 members of the public turned up to wish the couple well and they 
held their reception at Claridges hotel. Two years later, their first daughter Beatrice was 
born, followed, in 1990 by Eugenie. 
By that time, however, the marriage was already under strain. "I married a sailor," Fergie 
later lamented in an interview with Piers Morgan in 2011, "and I got a prince." Indeed, for 
the first five years of their married life, the demands of Andrew's naval career meant that 
the couple saw each other for just 40 days out of every year.
