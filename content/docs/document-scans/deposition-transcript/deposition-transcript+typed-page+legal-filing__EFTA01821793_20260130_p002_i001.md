Canadians. Based on my experience as both a mom and a writer, I give Dubai seven stars. 
Following are my top seven picks... 
1. Desert safari: I admit I was a little hesitant about an Arabian Adventures dune bashing 
adventure. Too tame? Too scary? In fact, the Sundowner dinner safari turned out to be much 
better than expected. Older kids will love the thrilling rides up and down sand dunes as part of a 
cavalcade of white SUV's, steered vertically, sideways and almost upside down steep and 
slippery sand dunes by incredibly well-trained drivers. I loved the stunning desert landscape 
bathed in sunset hues. Kids will love the desert 'camp,' complete with camel rides, belly dancers 
and henna painting, and a buffet dinner under the stars, seated on huge Arabian-style cushions... 
Yes, this was 'touristy,' but the dune ride was thrilling, and I highly recommend it for families with 
older kids who don't scare easily. See http://www.arabian-adventures.com/ 
2. Wild Water: The Wild Wadi water park next to Jumeirah Beach Hotel boasts two dozen rides 
and attractions, including the "Jumeirah Sceirah" (33 metres high with speeds of up to 80 km/h!) 
and the super-scary "Tunnel of Doom." If you stay at the iconic, family-friendly Jumeirah Beach 
resort, you get free admission to Wild Wadi, plus early admission. See: http://www.wildwadi.com/ 
I also highly recommend a a day at Atlantis Resort's Aquaventure. This 42-acre water park sends 
bathers through a series of rapids, waterfalls, waves and meandering rivers. You can also swim 
with the dolphins, an expensive 30 minute once-in-a-lifetime experience. Rates: all day, CDN 
$56, children, CDN $47. (Tip: A Sundowner pass is CDN $28 for adults and children.)

3. Abra ride: Abras — traditional boats used to transport residents across Dubai Creek — are a 
great, authentic experience, even if the benign-sounding Dubai Creek is actually surprisingly 
choppy and busy. Board on the Deira side and disembark at the textile market on the Bur Dubai 
side. Tour companies also offer dhow dinner cruises or custom abra cruises to sites like the Ra 
al Khor Bird Sanctuary. If you stay at the amazing Madinat Jumeirah resort, you will travel around 
the resort's extensive waterways by abra. Not a guest? You can now take an abra tour of the 
resort from the Souk Abra stations near Toscana and Barzar at Souk Madinat Jumeirah. See 
www.jumeirah.com.
4. Souks: For an amazing glimpse into everyday Arabic life, Dubai's spice and gold markets are 
not to be missed. I was truly surprised at the the hustle and bustle and trade going on — this is no 
manufactured tourist attraction, it's the real deal, and a real education for kids. Near the souks, 
lining Dubai's harbour for miles, are colourful, rickety dhows (boats) loading and unloading cargo -
everything from fridges to ketchup, Tang, and sacks of nuts for — and from — Iran and North 
Africa. Take a walk along the harbour and vote on which dhow looks least seaworthy. 
5. Heritage: Highly recommended is the Dubai Museum and Dubai Heritage Village. The
