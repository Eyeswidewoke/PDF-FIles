Leon, 
I hate having to write this. however . I wanted you to understand the seriousness of your dysfunctional family office. I 
spent the last week reviewing it.. The office has su=fered from lack of control and clear direction and recently the 
delay in re=oving Eileen She has been a nightmare for you . she hammmered together the office in a willy nilly fashion 
either trying to hire c quality people or once=20 hired giiving no defined roles. she and ada protecting what they see as 
their turf, errors upon errors upon error=. millions of dollars unaccounted for. 500k again found in a drawre=20 last 
week In early sept I notified you that joslin was unable to deal=20 with ada eileen . I sent delson in to referee. i again 
notifed you in early oct that she needed to be told but transition st=ying until only oct 15. I pointed out the risk of 
keeping the dynamic duo was their effect on joslin. and the office. . in nov I sent you a email warning=you i thought he 
could not take more of their interefernce.. this week, in the first face to face = had with him since dec he could not 
respond to simple questions , spoke finnacial gibberish, had misleading answers. bad answers i, wild elliptical 
statements. As=20 you asked ,i then confronted brad with this , and to my amazment brad said that hi= take was the 
same but this is how he found him in early jan and thought it was just his normal behavior!!!, In mid nov you suggested 
thtat your choice to run the office was Brad.and he would replace eileen. from mid dec he audited until early jan, when 
he assumed thhe job t=at im told is only 75% of his time. 125 % needed HE might be ca=able of runing your office but i 
have yet to see any indication that this is true. he is clearl= a good friend of yours . ON thurs I handed the same spread 
sheet that I had sent to brad, to fourQ=A0 financial execs. ( mine were the only ones with actual numbers), 40=A0to a 
person each withim minutes said this makes no sense. no sense whatsoe=er, bad numbers bad cagtegories. bad inputs 
outputs numbers that dont add. if=20 it was an mri , of joslin i woudl say serious breakdown. 4>=A0I had him over to 
explain to my team what had happend, and then sent my cfo to speak to him and others at elysium. I pointed out to you 
that joslon could not make the first pass at hiring a finance person . I was right. HE is a great tax person, period. no social 
skills reporting skills or mgmt skills. ITS a mess and a larger one than I thought. sorry, I have begun to interview some 
cfo.s Q=A0and have put out more feelers. if you feel comfortable i think you should ask at apollo for=20 help.. It is now 
too late to remove eileen entirely as i had been requesting. I have not spokein to her in months . but during this cra=y 
delay in doing so, she is now significantly more entrenched. A re-do is necessary . top down. 
you have repeatedly pointed out that you beleive you have paid me =hat you consider a great deal of money. you are 
one of my best friends. to say you made a good deal would be an understatment. I have spent the majority of the last 
year restructuring your things. I had cancel= my europe trips for the last six months of last year. I am down money, 
friends and clients doing so. I take our friendhsip very serioulsy and feel not one iota of regret though I made a bad 
deal but lived=up to it. and more much more 
that being said, you will need to bring i= a few people to start from the top down. apollo review, coordination, 
Q=A0bill pay, book keeping, legal reporting,filings, sec gaming foreign, pfic=20 fbar gift gtax use tax, corporate admin, 
Ilc etc. investments art. household personla. taxes. gifts, grats trusts children, chjecks and balances. banking doc review, 
tra review, brh review . review of will given=new info.. jpm goldman, db bam, check writing , foundation decision 
art consultants. boat plane. construction. travel. insurance, IT,. staff mgmt. w= will have to deal with torn ada, eileen, 
now joslin,
