Sweetheart deal!" So goes the attack on the resolutio= of the more than a 
decade ago federal investigation involving our client =effrey Epstein. The attack is profoundly misplaced, supported 
neithe= by the law nor the facts. Nor is it supported by the structure of our con=titutional republic. To the contrary, 
Jeffrey was subjected to an extremel= aggressive federal intrusion into what would typically be considered a 
qu=ntessentially local criminal matter in south Florida. The =ffense investigated — at its core, sexual favors fo= hire —
has long been treated as a matter entrusted to l=ws of the several States, not the federal government. The 
conducti>=A0- for which Jeffrey took full responsibility4)=A0— was a classic state offense and was treated exactly that 
way b= able, honest prosecutors in Palm Beach County. Nevertheless, w=thout a request from the state prosecutors, 
the federal government in=ervened. For their own opportunistic reasons, many are now criticizi=g the federal decision-
makers at the time, including now-Secretary of Labo= Alex Acosta (then-United States Attorney in south Florida), for not 
going=far enough. 
The cr=tics are wrong on the facts and the law. They also ignore a fact going to 
=he heart of fundamental fairness: In the decade since paying hi= debt to society, Jeffrey Epstein has led a life 
characterized by responsi=le citizenship, numerous acts of generosity and good deeds.<=> 
Here are the true key facts:Q=A0 Jeffrey Epstein, a successful self-made 
businessman with no prior =riminal history whatsoever, engaged in illegal conduct that amounted =o solicitation of 
prostitution. That conduct was wrong and=a violation of Florida state law. Although no coercion, violence, al=ohol, 
drugs or the like were involved, some of the women he paid were=under the age of 18. Those facts were carefully 
assessed by exp=rienced state sex crime prosecutors who aggressively enforce state crimina= laws. No one turned a 
blind eye to potential offenses to the public=order. To the contrary, the Palm Beach State Attorney's Office c=nducted 
an extensive fifteen-month investigation, led by the chief of the =ex Crimes Division. Mr. Epstein was then indicted by 
the state grand=jury on a single felony count of solicitation of prostitution. 
During that intense investigation, the state prosecutors extensively g=thered 
and analyzed the evidence, met face-to-face with many of the a=serted victims, considered their credibility — or lack 
thereof 4>=804o and considered the extent of exculpatory evidence, including sw=rn testimony from many that they lied 
about being eighteen years=old to be allowed into Mr. Epstein's home. After months of n=gotiations, the state 
prosecutors believed they had reached a reasoned res=lution of the matter that vindicated the public interest — a 
resol=tion entirely consistent with that of cases involving other similarly-situ=ted defendants. The system worked as it 
should have. =/u> 
Then, in came the feds.Q=A0 The United States Attorney's Office extensively 
and aggressively in=estigated whether Mr. Epstein had engaged in a commercial human traffickin= ring, targeted 
minors, or used the internet or traveled interstate i= the process. But that's not what this was and tha='s not what 
happened. That is precisely why the federal=authorities' ultimate decision to defer prosecution to the st=te was the 
right one. 
<=u> 
However, the federally-demanded resolution was not without c=nditions. The 
federal prosecutors insisted on various unorthodox requ=rements that Mr. Epstein's experienced defense team had 
never seen=imposed on any defendant anywhere. Under the federally-forced deal, Jeffre= was required to request that
