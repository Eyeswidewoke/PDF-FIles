PayPal will not sell or rent any of your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes and only shares 
your personal information with third parties as described in this policy. 
If you open a PayPal account directly on a third party website or via a third party application, any information that you 
enter on that website or application (and not directly on a PayPal website) will be shared with the owner of the third 
party website or application and your information may be subject to their privacy policies. 
How you can restrict PayPal from sharing your personal information 
Federal and state laws allow you to restrict the sharing of your personal information in certain instances. However, 
these laws also state that you cannot restrict other types of sharing. Because we have chosen to refrain from certain 
types of data sharing, the only type of sharing of your personal information that you may restrict is as follows: 
If you do not want PayPal to share your personal information with eBay companies for the purpose of marketing their 
products or with other financial institutions for the purpose of marketing our jointly offered products to you, please log 
in to your account and uncheck the box in the Information Sharing section of the Notifications and Information Sharing 
page. This page can be accessed by going to the Profile subtab under the My Account tab. 
You can also control how we use your contact information to market the PayPal Services to you in the notifications 
preferences. 
How you can access or change your personal information 
You can review and edit your personal information at any time by logging in to your account and clicking the Profile 
subtab under the My Account tab.
