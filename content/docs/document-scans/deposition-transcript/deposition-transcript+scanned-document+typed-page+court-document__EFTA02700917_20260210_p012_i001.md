become one of the most successful financiers in Europe and the principal financial advisor to the 
Vatican. Then, in March 1979, he was indicted by a US federal grand jury on charges of fraud 
proceeding from his 1972 take over of the Franklin National Bank. Although released on bond, 
he was required to remain in New York. Sindona instead staged his own kidnapping and fled in 
disguise to Italy. When arrested three months later, he was tried, convicted, and sentenced to 25 
years in prison. 
When 1 met him in the Otisville prison visiting room, the grey-haired financier appeared frail 
and nervous. After asking me to buy him a vanilla ice cream, we began the one-hour interview. 
He came right to the point, saying he only did what Pope Paul had instructed him to do: shift the 
Vatican's Italian assets to tax-free off-shore havens. When I asked him about anonymous entities 
named "Suprafin,""Zitropo" and "Manic," he said they themselves were merely vehicles to hide 
the transfers of money. It was, as he described it, purely a money laundering scheme, which he 
said was "legal" because the Vatican was sovereign. With the help of Calvi, the money was 
deposited in dozens of letter-box companies, which then borrowed against them from the Banco 
Ambrosiano, and sent the proceeds to other offshore entities. 
If so, why couldn't the funds be recovered? He answered that the Vatican with Calvi's help 
had used these funds to make "questionable investments." As an example, he cited the Vatican's 
attempt to buy control of Rizzoli, which owned Italy's largest newspaper, the Corriere della 
Sera. "I don't know how much was lost," he said, because by then he was no longer advising the 
Vatican. 
He claimed to know nothing about Calvi's death, but added, as I was leaving the room, that 
he might have a similar fate if he was ever sent back to Italy. It was the last time I saw Sindona. 
On September 25, 1984, he was extradited to Italy, and eon March 18, 1986 he died in a prison 
in Rome from a dose of cyanide in his coffee, a death ruled a suicide.

The Masonic Swindle 
When Calvi was arrested the year before his death in Milan, it was on a questionable 
technicality that occurred a decade earlier. His bank had arranged some currency legal transfer in 
1971 that, were held by a magistrate to violate a retroactive 1976 foreign exchange law. Along 
with Calvi, six other former and present executives of the Banco Ambrosiano were arrested. 
Mass arrests of bankers by magistrates on technical offenses had by the 1980s become a common 
even in Italy. Calvi spent 2 months in the medieval Lodi prison. On getting out, Calvi was 
determined to pay whatever needed to be paid to get political protection against future 
imprisonment. "It is a question of surviving in a climate that is becoming like a religious war." 
He said in a newspaper interview. "It is an atmosphere that favors every sort of barbarism." 
The person who offered Calvi such protection in this "religious war" was Licio Gelli. A 
mattress spring manufacturer and poet from Arezzo, Gelli claimed to run one a powerful web of 
influence in the form of a Masonic Lodge in Rome called Propagandi Due, or P-2. This secret 
society, according to a 64 volume investigation by a Commission of the Italian Parliament. 
included 43 members of Parliament, 48 generals, the heads of Italy's intelligence service, the top 
magistrates in the judiciary system, the civil servants running various state-owned 
enterprises (including the energy company END, key bank regulators and leading businessmen. 
The report concluded P-2 was a veritable a "state within a state." The Commission had come to
