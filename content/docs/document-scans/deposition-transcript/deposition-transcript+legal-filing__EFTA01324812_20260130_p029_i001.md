your available cash balances swept without limit to a tax-advantaged Sweep Fund or, for 
Puerto Rico residents only, the Puerto Rico Short Term Investment Fund, Inc. 
The following tax-advantaged Sweep Funds currently are available: 
• 
UBS RMA Tax-Free Fund Inc. 
• 
UBS RMA California Municipal Money Fund 
• 
UBS RMA New York Municipal Money Fund 
• 
The Puerto Rico Short Term Investment Fund, Inc. 
• 
UBS Select Tax-Free Capital Fund (subject to minimum asset requirements) 
State-specific municipal funds are intended for residents of those states only. The Puerto 
Rico Short Term Investment Fund, Inc. is offered exclusively to Puerto Rico residents as 
defined in the fund's prospectus. The Puerto Rico Short Tenn Investment Fund is not a 
money market fund registered under the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940, does not 
comply with rules applicable to U.S. registered funds, presents a higher degree of risk than 
those funds, and is for Puerto Rico residents holding accounts with UBS Financial Services 
Incorporated of Puerto Rico only. The Puerto Rico Short Term Investment Fund and the 
Sweep Funds are sold by prospectus only, and are not FDIC-insured, not guaranteed by 
a bank, and may lose value. 
If your Account is tax-advantaged, or is a Basic Investment Account, whether 
tax-advantaged or not, you are not eligible to select a tax-advantaged Sweep Fund as a 
Sweep Option. Tax-advantaged Accounts include, but are not limited to, Accounts of 
Plans, Plan Participants and IRAs. If your tax-advantaged Account or Basic Investment 
Account is not an Investment Advisory Account, and you choose not to participate in a 
Bank Sweep Program, available cash balances will remain in your Account and will not 
earn interest. If your tax-advantaged Account or Bask Investment Account is an 
Investment Advisory Account, available cash balances must be swept through a Bank 
Sweep Program. 
Changing Your Sweep Option 
You may change your sweep election to an available alternative Sweep Option at any time. 
By instructing us to change your sweep election, you are authorizing and directing us to 
redeem your Sweep Fund shares, or withdraw funds from one of the UBS Bank Sweep 
Programs, and transfer the funds to your new Sweep Option. You may change your sweep 
election by contacting your Financial Advisor. 
For additional information regarding program availability and Account eligibility, please 
refer to the UBS Bank Sweep Programs Disclosure Statement and the UBS International 
Deposit Account Sweep Program Disclosure in the Agreements and Disclosures booklet, 
and to the prospectuses for the Sweep Funds and the Puerto Rico Short Term Investment 
Fund. 
Institutional Sweep Funds and Automatic Exchanges 
We may offer Institutional Sweep Funds as Sweep Options or Secondary Sweep Options 
for clients (except for Plans and IRAs in investment advisory programs) who meet certain 
minimum asset thresholds. Current eligibility criteria may be obtained from your Financial 
Advisor. UBS may change the eligibility criteria at any time in its discretion without notice 
to you. Institutional Sweep Funds will generally offer a higher yield than other Sweep 
Funds, though there is no guarantee that the yield will be, or will remain, higher. 
Clients other than Plans and Plan Participants 
Your eligibility for the Institutional Sweep Funds will be determined at the end of each 
month, based on the value of your Marketing Relationship assets as determined in the sole

Institutional Sweep Fund.
