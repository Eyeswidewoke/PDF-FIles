US: Despite 01 lull and dollar appreciation, trend growth 
will continue to improve 
e 
The economy is projected to grow 2.4% In O1 2015, nearly the same pace 
as the previous quarter. The inability of the economy to sustain a 3%-plus 
growth rate in the first quarter is due to several transitory factors, which 
we expect to dissipate in 02. Consequently, similar to last year, we expect 
economic activity to rebound over the next couple of quarters. The biggest 
risk to growth is from an appreciating dollar. However, we believe that 
most of the dollar strength will be offset by the fall in energy prices, which 
will significantly boost real income. At the same time, the outlook for 
interest rates is much more benign, as the timing and glide path of the fed 
funds rate has been significantly reduced. This, too, will help offset some 
of the projected weakness in net exports. Therefore, financial conditions 
have not tightened enough for us to mark down our full-year GDP forecast. 
Moreover, to the extent that monetary policymakers are projecting less 
tightening than before, recent dollar appreciation, which has been on a 
torrid path, is likely to moderate. 
e 
Given the lags between changes in the trade-weighted dollar and net 
exports, the economy has yet to meaningfully feel the impact of the 
appreciating dollar. If its current level is maintained or if the dollar 
appreciates further, net exports are poised to be a significant drag on 
economy activity. At the same time, the strong dollar will weigh further on 
import prices and hence consumer goods inflation. Based on the 
appreciation to date, we estimate the rise in the dollar is worth roughly 50 
basis points of monetary tightening. However, overall economic activity 
may not be meaningfully compromised because a stronger dollar will keep 
interest rates lower than would otherwise be the case, which should help 
housing-related spending. Additionally, to the extent that the rising dollar 
has helped dampen inflation both through lower energy prices and 
eventually even lower goods prices, real wage growth will be lifted. This is 
a meaningful tailwind for consumers, who dominate US aggregate 
demand. Ultimately, the appreciating dollar may simply alter the 
composition of real GDP growth and not the trajectory of growth. This is 
why we have not changed our longer-run forecasts for the economy. 
• 
The economy has generated 3.3 million jobs over the past 12 months, the 
strongest pace since March 2000, when interest rates were much higher. 
In 2000, the fed funds rate was 6.0% and inflation-adjusted fed funds, 
using the headline personal consumption expenditures deflator, was 
3.13% at that time. Even with a strengthening dollar and the expectation of 
a rising fed funds rate, monetary policy will remain highly accommodative 
for the foreseeable future.
