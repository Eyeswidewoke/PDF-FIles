bank's earnings capacity," Jason Goldberg, a bank analyst at Barclays, said. "It makes =25 billion in revenue per quarter 
and has record capital." "JPMorgan fa=led — and failed miserably," Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in 
Manhattan, said on Tuesday in announcing the action. 
As much as such words might sting at first, the bank=92s shareholders and clients show every sign of remaining loyal. 
JPMorgan's financial success highlights a deep quandary that regulators have to grappl= with as they press the largest 
banks to clean up their acts. The government=92s penalties may seem large on paper — JPMorgan's mortgage 
settlement with=the Justice Department last year cost it a record $13 billion — but the large=t banks seem capable of 
earning their way out of serious legal trouble. =93JPMorgan's shareholders may believe these billions of dollars don't 
count because they see them as extraordinary expenses," said Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan La= 
School. "But they keep popping up one after another — and the bank coul= have done something about them."

One reason that JPMorgan can absorb the $20 billion i= that it has steadily set aside reserves over the last few years to 
finance futur= legal payouts. Mr. Goldberg, the bank analyst, estimates that, as of last year's third quarter, JPMorgan 
had injected $28 billion into its legal re=erves since the end of 2009. The legal payouts that have been subtracted from 
the reserves, including those booked since the third quarter, might have taken =he reserve down to about $10 billion. 
Most analysts expect JPMorgan will be ab=e to cover any remaining settlements, though the bank said on Tuesday that 
it might have to set aside an extra $400 million for the Madoff settlement. 
In theory, regulators have other ways of improving et=ics at banks. They can try to hold more individuals personally 
accountable. Some senior executives have left JPMorgan as a result of recent scandals at the bank, including the so-
called London whale incident, in which the bank's traders lost more than $6 billion on botched derivatives trades. In 
recent months, the bank has also added two members to its board to improve oversight. But facts contained in the 
government's Madoff action suggest that efforts to hold executives respon=ible may go only so far. 
The action describes how the chief risk officer of JPMorgan's investment bank allowed the bank to increase its financial 
exp=sure to a Madoff entity in 2007 to $250 million. The risk officer had spoken wit= Mr. Madoff but approved the 
increase even though Mr. Madoff appeared to mak= it clear that he would not answer more probing questions about his 
firm. The government's action says that the risk officer understood that Mr. Madoff "would not authorize any further 
direct due diligence of Madoff Securitie=." The risk officer, John Hogan, still works at JPMorgan as chairman of risk.=A0 
"Our senior people were trying to do the right thing and acted in good faith at all times," Brian J. Marchiony, a JPMorgan 
spokesman, said in a statement. The bank also said, "We recogniz= we could have done a better job pulling together 
various pieces of information=and concerns about Madoff from different parts of the bank over time."=/p> 
Still, some banking experts say they think that compa=ies like JPMorgan are so large and complex that it might be almost 
impossible t= keep all employees in line. "With respect to the big banks, it is not so much a culture problem but a 
complex=ty problem," said Kurt N. Schacht, a managing director at the CFA Institute,ran organization that promotes 
ethics and standards at financial firms. "We t=ink these firms are so large that they are always going to be plagued by 
rogue operators." As a result, breaking up the banks to make them smaller might improve their cultures, some bank 
speciali=ts contend. "I think JPMorgan is too big to manage and it should be broken up," said Paul Miller, a bank analyst
