These are the guys I might be working with. I only met with Doug Kitani so far. He is now the 
VP/CFO of Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association. The next person I am to meet this week is Dan 
Beldy, Disney's venture capital guy. And the third is Chuck Wallace, the co-founder of Esurance. They 
all work for AOPA now. (AOPA - htto://wvvw.aooa.oroJinfo/) Dan and Chuck have consulting contracts 
at the moment, getting the new companies ready for launch, and once that happens they are to 
assume executive positions in these new startups. Doug suggested the same for me. I would need to 
sign an NDA. 
,,,You sounded skeptical about the opportunity...am I missing something that does not sound right?
