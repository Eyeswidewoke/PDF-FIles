security interest in, sell, assign or otherwise transfer (an "Assignment's) all or any part of its interest in this 
Agreement and the other Loan Documents (including all associated rights associated with or secured 
thereby and the related international interests) or any amount due or to become due hereunder or 
thereunder, and Borrower shall perform all of its obligations under the Loan Documents, to the extent so 
transferred, for the benefit of the beneficiary of such Assignment (such beneficiary, including any 
successors and assigns, an 'Assignee"); provided that no such Assignment shall be to any Person

defenses arising from fraudulent acts on the part of Assignee. Upon the express assumption by such 
Assignee of such Lender's obligations hereunder, such Lender shall be relieved of any such assumed 
obligations. Borrower hereby consents to any such assignment, grant, sale or transfer, including, without 
limitation, for purposes of the Cape Town Convention. If so directed in writing, Borrower shall pay all 
amounts due or to become due to the applicable Lender under the Loan Documents and/or any related 
associated rights and international interests directly to Assignee or any other party designated in writing by 
such Lender. Borrower acknowledges and agrees that such Lenders right to enter into an Assignment is 
essential to such Lender and, accordingly, waives any restrictions under Applicable Law with respect to an 
Assignment and any related remedies. Upon the request of such Lender or any Assignee, Borrower also 
agrees (a) to promptly execute and deliver to such Lender or to such Assignee an acknowledgment of 
assignment in form and substance satisfactory to the requesting party, an insurance certificate naming 
Assignee as additional insured and loss payee and otherwise evidencing the insurance coverages required 
hereby, a consent to the Assignment for International Registry purposes, as well as renew any authorization 
required by the International Registry in connection with such consent, such as renewing its transacting user 
entity status. and re-designating a professional user entity, if necessary in Agent's or such Lenders 
judgment, and such other documents and assurances reasonably requested by Agent, such Lender or 
Assignee and make, or cause to be made, all registrations (including all assignments and subordinations) 
and all amendments, extensions and discharges with the International Registry reasonably requested by 
Agent, such Lender or Assignee (and give or obtain any necessary consent thereto, as well as renew any 
authorization required by the International Registry in connection therewith, including renewing its 
transacting user entity status and re-designating a professional user entity, if necessary in Agent's and/or 
such Lender's judgment), and (b) to comply with the reasonable requirements of any such Assignee in order 
to perfect such Assignee's Lien in the Airframe, Engines (including all associated rights associated therewith 
or secured thereby and the related international interests), proceeds and other Collateral.

Documents may be instituted or brought in the courts of the State of New York or the U.S. District Court 
for the Southern District of New York, as Agent may elect or in any other state or Federal court as Agent 
shall deem appropriate, and by execution and delivery of this Agreement, Borrower hereby irrevocably

enforced in any other jurisdiction, within or outside the United States of America, by suit on the judgment,

liability. Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, Agent and Borrower may bring a 
judicial proceeding against the Registrar of the International Registry in the Republic of Ireland, solely
