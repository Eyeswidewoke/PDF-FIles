The documents you forwarded to me include the PPM and the Subscription Agreements. No 
limited partnership agreement is attached. I would like to obtain a copy of the limited partnership 
agreement to check it against the description of terms contained in the Private Placement 
Memorandum. 
The investment to be subscribed for is for Class S Interests of a Delaware Limited Partnership, 
Blue Mountain Credit Alternatives Fund L.P., This Limited Partnership has been around since 
2003 and has other interests outstanding. According to the PPM, the Limited Partnership is 
currently also offering the opportunity to subscribe for other classes of interests, but those other 
classes of interests are being offered to existing holders of those outstanding interests. The PPM 
indicates that the terms of the other interests are different from the Class S Interests. The PPM 
does not specify what the differences are but refers us to a 2009 Private Placement Memorandum 
for Class Q2 Interests, Are you aware of these other interests and do you want us to determine 
what differences there are in the different class of interests currently being offered. I would like 
to know whether the terms of the Q2 interests are more favorable than the terms of the Class S 
Interests? 
Minimum investment in Class S Interests is $1 Million and the subscription offer is being made 
only to Qualified Purchasers under the 40 Act, which must also be qualified eligible persons under 
Regulation 4.7 of the Commodities Exchange Act, and to Accredited Investors under Reg D of 
the Securities Act of 1933. 
The structure is a Master Fund/Feeder Fund Structure, which includes this Partnership for on-
shore investors, an offshore fund and possibly other investment vehicles structured to meet the 
specific needs of certain U.S. Investors and non-U.S. Investors, all feeding into a Master 
Fund, Blue Mountain Credit Alternatives Master Fund, L.P., a Cayman Islands exempted limited 
partnership. The PPM states that as of the date of the PPM, September 2012, no Feeder Funds 
other than the Offshore Fund were in existence. I do not know what is the state of affairs today. 
. Withdrawals are considered to be made first from the sub-capital account (and corresponding 
sub-investment account) attributable to the earliest eligible capital contribution on a first-in first-
out basis. 
The "soft lock" applies to requests to withdraw any investment tranche that is held for less than 
12 months, and in the event of the withdrawal of a tranchc held for less than 12 months, requires 
payment of a withdrawal fee of 3% of the Net Asset Value of the Interests withdrawn. 
The "Investor Level Limit", provides that the Partnership is not obligated to permit a withdrawal 
of more than 25% per quarter of an investment tranche, so that a request to withdraw 100% of 
the tranche can generally take 4 quarters to be effective. However, there appears to be a quirky 
reset provision in the PPM which states that at the calendar year end following the conclusion of 
the Soft Lock with respect to any tranche, the Partnership may convert that tranche into any other 
tranche of Class S Interests that is not subject to a soft lock. So, although I do not have the 
limited partnership agreement to analyze, I think that this reference in the PPM means that if by
