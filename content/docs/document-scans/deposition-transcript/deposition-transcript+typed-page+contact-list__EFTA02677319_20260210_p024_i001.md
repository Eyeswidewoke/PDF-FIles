Credits: 4 
CRN 3970 Sec A 
This course represents the culmination of the Writing Concentration at Eugene Lang In this 
seminar, students rigorously critique, complete, shape, and revise a portfolio of work culled from 
their previous writing courses. This seminar is community-based, as the class collaboratively 
selects critical and creative readings that relate specifically to its members' writing projects. In 
engagement with these readings, as well as student writing projects. the class intensively 
examines issues of craft, form, content. and process- In addition to developing a final revised 
portfolio of 2535 pages. each student submits a critical essay contextualizing her/his body of 
work.

Credits: 3 
CRN 3976 Sec A 
This course covers techniques used to collect. organize, and present data graphically. Students 
learn how to calculate measures of center and dispersion, apply probability formulas, calculate 
confidence Intervals. and test hypotheses. This course also provides an introduction to software 
used to analyze and present statistical information. This course is designed for students in 
marketing and does not use SPSS. which is commonly employed in psychological studies. If you 
are a student in Lang you may wish to check with your department to see if SPSS is required for 
your field of study. This course does not satisfy any requirements for the Interdisaplinary Science 
major.
