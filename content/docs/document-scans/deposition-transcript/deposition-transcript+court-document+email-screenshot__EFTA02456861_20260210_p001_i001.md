Re: 
My decision on hiring and spending the=money to deliver exactly what our plan was - to deliver a restaurant to sup=ort 
a 4* hotel - I delivered - in spades - DAVID did nothing but systematic=lly tear this apart First DAVID Negligence on the 
DD for the=hotel Ran 9mm over on a 8 mm budget Shut the job down f=r 8 weeks - could have been avoided 
Incompetently handled t=e needed tco items for months - and was advised for months Has done nothing but 
systematically shut down revenue and operation &n=sp;Procedures from hotel to the restaurant - Went to the st=eet 
with out any NDA - negligence to me - asking everyone to take over Henr= - no one wanted to touch being in business 
with DAVID Has n=t communicated with me in months - yet there is a 70mm operation at risk ye= he's acting like e a 
child I have set up the=chef as a favor to me to take over operations for at least the next 4 weeks= trust me this has 
nothing to do with chef wanting to stay on board - it =80 s a total favor to me I have as the email you Re-forwa=ded me 
spoon feed how to transition- which DAVID has plenty of time - but n=t acted on at all I have even offered a priority loan 
of 50k which=is more then enough to keep the restaurant open for the next 4 weeks- =div>DAVID has to stop hiding 
behind you - have Communciatio=s with me on how to transition - as I have said often I would walk him thro=gh - not 
material we do not like each other - DAVID has a responsibility he=e he has to stop being a child - My involvement in th= 
restaurant stops on May 6 - I can not extend this date You=where to set up a meeting between us regarding the tco last 
week - that nev=r happened - tco is not at all how DAVID has told you- we can have a meetin= to review both tco and 
transition of restaurant on Monday =ou can tell DAVID to hire Gary to help us with the tco - never going to get=done 
with out GARY overseeing all trades - and telling you the truth <=div> But I'm not doing this through you - too
