Susan Hess and I arc chauffeured downtown with our Vera Wang gowns and report to the VIP extra holding 
area where we join Prince Dimitri of Yugoslavia in a bespoke dinner jacket, journalist Christopher Mason, songstress 
Yanna Avis, photographer Kelly Klein, art dealer Larry Gagosian's girl friend Shala Monroque in see-through Rodarte, 
beauty executive Olivia Chantecaille. producer Lawrence Robins, author Jackie Weld Drake, Vogue film critic Joan Juliet 
Buck, fashion consultant Jill Fairchild, CNN's Felicia Taylor and Italian newsman Mario Calvo-Platero. 
Ellen Mirojnick and her costume department have assembled racks of the most expensive elaborate designer 
gowns and work at break neck speed styling while we wildly strip to our undies in a makeshift dressing area. Ellen pours 
me into a black tulle Marchese with a enormous wired silver bow. Twenty hairdressers and make-up artists systematically 
work on 250 extras. A mile of tables arc alternately filled with steaming coffee, fattening breakfast foods, hair sprays. 
mirrors, shoes and jewelry. It's a madhouse of excitement. 
We are led to the part of the set used for the cocktail reception and placed around Michael Douglas and Charlie 
Sheen stand-ins. Charlie has been flown in from LA for half a day's work to reprise his original character. He is now the 
highest paid television actor commanding two million dollars an episode of "Two and a Half Men." 
Oliver arrives on the set greeting. examining, tweaking the shot and always pulling the prettiest girls closest to 
the camera. Michael and Charlie arrive from their trailers and run their lines as socials drift into their sight lines 
challenging their concentration on pages of dialogue. Oliver yells. "Action" as the extras aggressively jockey for face time. 
Charlie is not having an easy day and they do take after take. My corporate husband Chuck Pfieffer has gotten his real 
girlfriend Lisa Crosby in the film and my marriage has become a threesome. 
Sensing our concern of not making it onto the silver screen Oliver tells his first assistant director to seat a dinner 
table with Susan Hess. Jill Fairchild. Prince Dimitri, Chuck Pfieffer, Grace Meigher and Mario Calvo-Platero. He directs 
us to chat with each other turning left and right as the camera closely pans past our faces. 
Elsewhere on the set are John Buffalo Mailer, as Shia's character's best friend, Austin Pendleton, 94-year-old Eli 
Wallach and Natalie Morales. Also in this film are: the magnificent Frank Langone, as Shia's boss, who throws himself in 
front of a train early in the film, Susan Sarandon as Shia's real-estate broker mother, Sylvia Miles, who reprises her 
hilarious cameo as another real-estate agent and Jean Pigozzi as an international banker. 
Lunch is called at 4 p.m. and Michael Douglas takes seven heavily made-up and bejeweled women including 
Susan, Jill and me to a restaurant around the comer. Gordon Geklco hosts a hen party talking about children, schools, 
country houses and vacations. 
Back on the set Oliver is shooting the actual dinner. Assistant directors ask for volunteers to dance to the live 
music. Prince Dimitri twirls and dips Jackie Weld. Kelly Klein, in her own Karl Lagerfeld sheer black organza, watches 
from a table with scattered champagne glasses half-filled with apple juice along with her 86-year-old father. Tulley 
Rector. Charlie Sheen leaves for LA and Shia is very annoyed he was not introduced to his hero. Carrie Mulligan, 
costumed like Audrey Hepburn. chats with us between takes. 
The final set up is a long tracking shot of Josh Brolin and his wife as they triumphantly enter the ball. It is close 
to 9 p.m. and Lord William Astor arrives to pick rue up for Amelia Dayan and Adam Lindeinann's dinner for artists 
uptown. 
Oliver is introduced to William and delights in calling him Lord as he immediately moves him into the top of the 
shot and instructs him to tell Eli Wallach, "We must do lunch". Ever the proper English gentleman. William advises 
Oliver that Lords do not use American slang and improvises his own lines. The tracking shot continues for numerous 
takes following Josh and Noelle as every VIP extra gets another shot at instant stardom with one-line greetings.
