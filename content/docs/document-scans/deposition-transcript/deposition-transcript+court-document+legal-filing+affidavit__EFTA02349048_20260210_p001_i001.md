Jeffrey I think you hate =e... I have the impression you are trying to cut me out of your life. You =ell me 
you are sick but then you spend the day with 
or I don't k=ow who. It's been almost a week you are in Paris 
and=you didn't even tell me you were coming. The fact that you are in Euro=e and you don't want to see me makes me 
believe that I'm not so im=ortant for you since it's more than 6months that we don't see=each other... I would prefer for 
you to be honest with me instead of makin= up excuses, same as when I wanted to come to NY. I know you have a 
girlfr=end and you don't want her to know about me but I don't understand=why, since we are not together or even 
seeing each other. I thought we wer= friends...? 
I'm a 100% grateful everyday for what I =ave and what you give me, thank you. I don't know how I 
would mak= it without you and your support... What I know is that I will a=ways defend you regardless of what people 
say and will always be by your s=de if you have any problem. I really have a lot of respect and affection f=r you this is 
why seeing this whole situation and the way you are distanci=g yourself from me makes me extremely sad... 
Today, I foun= a job despite the fact that I know that none of your girls in NY is worki=g. I know you are 
trying to help me (thank you) but I don't under=tand this contradiction. I hope that one day I will be able to make m= 
way through life. I'm sure I have a lot of defects and I understand l=have to grow and that I have a lot to learn about how 
things really w=rk but I don't see myself as horrible as you say I am. 
Maybe=C2 you will not like this message and will take it as a whining but cont=ary I believe that venting 
my pain is healthier than suppress it with=drugs. I prefer to be honest and clear with you instead of pretending=of being 
ok when I'm not. By writing you this message I'm leaving =side my pride since I believe a relationship with no 
communication is fake=and I don't want to be fake with you. 
Love you...
