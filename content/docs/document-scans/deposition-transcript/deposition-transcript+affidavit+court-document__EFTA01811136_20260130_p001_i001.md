Subject Re: 
you were not to direct zeff„ you were to get the job done„ what i cannot accept is the fact that as 
of today months later, you have no results.. this is consistant with the past. you punchy nature is 
great, your accusations are not. Since robert coturier left. you and i have had the exact same 
discussion. about producing results versus wanting waiting, hoping, researching, exploring, 
searching, compiling, reviewing, critiqueing, wanting again, willing to , wanting to, hoping to, 
waiting for. receiving no emails. though you said in answer to my requirement that these things 
can't be done from a distance„ you were adamant that you could would definietly take care of 
what needed to get done. And once again NOTHING happens.. My affection for you as a friend 
is unshakable, you asked me on the ranch , what do you need to do to make money„ Isaid just 
once actually do as you say you will and get the job done instead of making excuses why again it 
didn't happen.. My affection is unshaken , in your personal intetnions. however , you accepting my 
accustations is not relevant., the only issues once again is did it get done, ill talk tomorrow, if 
you like, you and 
are welcome to come to paris.. I only have good feelings towards 
you, it seems that actually relying on you to do things for me , is proving to be divisive as 
opposed to enriching. you wanted to go on holiday again , in italy with your parents. i understand 
, you wanted to go on holiday with michael, i understood, I sinply asked that things get done, the 
cabans are ready in 4 weeks, thats the real time frame, this is not news to you.

jeffrey, i cant accept your accusations ?m sorry. you never once made it clear that i was to 
direct Zeff nor that i was to be the one really responsible for getting the cabanas done. i 
intentionally took a step back to be less directive, once you told me three weeks ago that sarah 
and i would work together on doing it , i felt it necessary to be sensitive to her suggestions 
and desires. 
if i sometimes seem punchy in my nature, i am no different from you in that regard, in fact you 
exhibit exactly the same trait, it is part of my livelyness and personality. it is not anger. i am 
willing to re-assess my delivery but you pay me for my opinion and that is what i give. 
i've really given you as much as you've asked for, and for the rest, been totally confused about 
where you're really going with what you want . 
that being said i love you and support you as a person, without doubt you are someone who is 
intricately and intimately woven into the fabric of my life. it is important we take care. 
for the rest i suggest we discuss in person — not via email — 
please call if you want to share
