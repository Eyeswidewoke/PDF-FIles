In both Florida and New York, the scheme operated in a nearly identical fashion: 
Epstein essentially operated a pyramid scheme of sexual exploitation, victimizing minor girls who 
were brought to his homes to give Epstein erotic "massages," in exchange for hundreds of dollars, 
and then paying those individuals to recruit additional minor victims. Once the victims were alone 
with Epstein, the "massages" became increasingly sexual. The identified victims ranged from 
approximately 14 to 17 years old when their abuse began, with the majority having been 
approximately 15 or 16 when they were recruited to perform sex acts with Epstein. Epstein's 
conduct included masturbating in front of victims; fondling their breasts; placing a vibrator on 
their genitals; and/or directly touching their genitals. Some victims also continued to engage in 
such acts with Epstein after they were no longer minors. Victims and recruiters in New York and 
Florida generally were paid $300 and $200 per visit, respectively. The victims were typically paid 
by Epstein or his employees in cash, in hundred dollar bills. 
After their first visit to Epstein's residences, victims in New York and Florida usually 
were contacted via telephone by individuals who worked for Epstein to arrange additional 
massages. In New York, one of those individuals was Leslie Groff, one of Epstein's assistants; in 
Florida, the primary contact for the girls was 
who was Epstein's employee and often 
accompanied him on travel, including to 
ew or 
everal victims reported that when they 
arrived at the Florida residence for massage appointments, 
was present at the house and 
escorted them to the massage room to meet Epstein. 
In order to maintain a steady stream of underage girls to perform sexual acts, Epstein 
also directed others, including some of his victims, to recruit other minor girls to engage in 
sexualized massages. Some victims brought just one or two friends, while others become prolific 
recruiters, bringing Epstein dozens of other girls. Epstein and his employees, including 
typically paid the recruiters hundreds of dollars for each girl they brought to Epstein's resi ences. 
The SDNY investigation has focused principally on conduct occurring in New York or 
with connections to New York, although, as detailed herein, through our review of information 
gathered through the prior investigation we have also developed considerable familiarity with—
and plan to charge—conduct that occurred in Florida. 
Epstein Background 
Epstein has had significant connections to New York City for many years. According 
to press reporting over the past approximately 20 years, he owns what is reportedly the largest 
private residence in Manhattan, on East 71st street, and his professional career was initially 
centered in New York. He was raised in Coney Island, and he taught calculus and physics at the 
Dalton School after dropping out of Cooper Union. From Dalton, he was hired at Bear Stems, 
where he worked from approximately 1976 to 1981 before reportedly starting his own wealth 
management business. The source of his reportedly-vast wealth is opaque; most concretely, he 
has worked closely with multi-billionaire Leslie Wexner, founder of the Limited chain of women's 
clothing stores, who also either gave or sold Epstein the Manhattan mansion. In the 1990s and 
2000s, Epstein apparently managed money, engaged in various philanthropy, and was briefly more 
publicly known for providing use of his aircraft to—and accompanying—Bill Clinton, Kevin 
Spacey, and Chris Tucker for a philanthropic trip to Africa. Since the Florida investigations, he 
has maintained a lower profile, residing primarily on his private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands.
