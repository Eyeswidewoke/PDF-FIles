This Intermediate nonfiction workshop course explores a founding genre of creative nonfiction, the 
true crime narrative. Beginning with colonial accounts of incidents published in sermons and 
broadsides, the readings will cover succeeding reports of murder and mayhem followed avidly by 
generations of American readers and writers. Occasionally, we will examine both nonfictional and 
fictional accounts of the same event (as with Don Moshefs seminal essay 'The Pied Piper of 
Tucson." which inspired a notable short story by Joyce Carol Oates.) Throughout the course, the 
essential elements of a compelling creative nonfiction narrative - character, point of view. 
strategic release of the facts, the writer's presence in the piece - will be analyzed. We will also 
examine the continuing appeal of the maxim If it bleeds, it leads; as well as changing 
conceptions of criminality and evil. Students will research and write crime narratives of their own. 
beginning with early exercises and culminating in one substantial piece due at the end of the

In this Advanced Poetry class, students will be asked to have double vision: in continuing work 
from Intermediate Poetry, they will also be asked to think about form in poetry. Students will read 
and write poems in traditional ('closed') and nontraditional ('open') forms. Readings will range 
from those poets considered expected but extraordinanly daring (Shakespeare. Bash°, Bishop) to 
ones who expectedly challenge the nature of form (Notley. Ashbery. Koch). The promise for the 
semester is a bumpy ride.
