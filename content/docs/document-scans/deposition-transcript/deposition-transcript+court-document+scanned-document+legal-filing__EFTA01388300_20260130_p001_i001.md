Interest Rate Swap. "Interest Rate Swap" means a transaction pursuant to which one 
party is required to make periodic payments of a fixed amount (or an amount calculated by applying a 
fixed rate to a non-amortizing notional amount) and the other party is required to make periodic payments 
of amounts in the same currency calculated by applying a floating rate to a non-amortizing notional 
amount. 
Section 13.2. Procedure for Exercise. Except when rights granted pursuant to an Option 
Transaction are deemed to be exercised pursuant to the provisions of Section 13.7 (Automatic Exercise) 
or Section 13.8 (Fallback Exercise), Buyer must give notice (which may be given orally, including by

given after the Latest Exercise Time on any day in an Exercise Period, then that notice will be deemed 
given on the next following day, if any, in that Exercise Period. If notice of exercise in respect of a 
European style Option Transaction or Bermuda style Option Transaction is given after the Latest Exercise 
Time on any day in an Exercise Period (or, in respect of any Option Transaction, after the Expiration 
Time), then that notice of exercise will be deemed to be ineffective. If, in respect of any Option 
Transaction, notice of exercise is given before the Earliest Exercise Time on any day in the Exercise 
Period, then that notice will be deemed given at the Earliest Exercise Time on that day. In the case of an 
Option Transaction to which Partial Exercise or Multiple Exercise is applicable, Buyer must specify in the 
notice the Notional Amount of the Underlying Swap Transaction or Swap Transaction in respect of which 
the Option Transaction is being exercised on the relevant Exercise Date. In the case of a Swaption that 
forms part of a Swaption Straddle, Buyer must specify in the notice whether it is exercising the Swaption 
in respect of the Underh. ing Payer Swap or the Swaption in respect of the Underlying Receiver Swap.

or, if designated in the relevant Confirmation. Seller's Agent, a written confirmation confirming the 
substance of any telephonic notice within one Exercise Business Day of that notice. Failure to provide

style Option Transaction, Buyer may exercise all or less than all the Notional Amount of the Underlying 
Swap Transaction or Swap Transaction on the Expiration Date, but may not exercise less than the 
Minimum Notional Amount, and, if an amount is specified as the -Integral Multiple" in the related 
Confirmation, the Notional Amount exercised must be equal to. or be an integral multiple of, the amount 
so specified. Any attempt to exercise (i) less than the Minimum Notional Amount will be ineffective and 
(ii) a Notional Amount not equal to, or an integral multiple of, the Integral Multiple will be deemed to be 
an exercise of a Notional Amount equal to the next lower integral multiple of the Integral Multiple (the 
Notional Amount of the Underlying Swap Transaction or Swap Transaction exceeding that amount being 
deemed to remain unexereised). 
Section 13.4. Multiple Exercise. If "Multiple Exercise" is specified to be applicable to an 
American style Option Transaction or a Bermuda style Option Transaction. Buyer may exercise all or less 
than all the unexercised Notional Amount of the Underlying Swap Transaction or Swap Transaction on
