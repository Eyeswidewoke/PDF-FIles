In 2009, the campaign even claimed that Iranian customs officers had been =isiting Ras al-Khaimah's port and that the 
emirate was serving as a cond=it for nuclear materials destined for Iran. Local media alleged that recen= terror plots 
there, including a 
2009 attempt to blow up Dubai's incomplete Burj Khalifa skyscraper, had =riginated in Ras al-Khaimah. The exiled crown 
prince even courted Israeli =upport, reportedly meeting with Israel's ambassador to the United Kingdo=, who said that 
he was "working with 
certain people from his side" and "promised that the matter will be so=ved in his [the former crown prince's] 
favor."</span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:18.0pt">In late 2010, the c=mpaign appeared to be gaining traction. Abu 
Dhabi's ruling family allowe= Khalid to return from exile to visit his father Sheikh Saqr, who still he=d the throne but was 
undergoing treatment 
in an Abu Dhabi hospital. When Saqr died&nbsp;in October, Khalid quickly r=turned to Ras al-Khaimah and installed 
himself in his former palace with s=me 150 heavily armed guards and even more loyal tribesmen. He seemed confi=ent 
that, having received Abu Dhabi's 
blessing to attend his father's funeral, he would be officially installe= as ruler of Ras Khaimah later that day. But in the 
early evening, the UAE=Ministry for Presidential Affairs in Abu Dhabi announced that his younger =rother Saud had been 
named the new 
ruler of Ras al-Khaimah.</span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:18.0pt">Abu Dhabi, which ho=ds the presidency of the Emirates, 
deployed UAE tanks on the outskirts of =he emirate and all of the deposed crown prince's retainers -- including =wo of 
his cousins, several Omani citizens, 
and a Canadian military adviser -- were arrested and detained for question=ng. Two months later, the emirate's new 
ruler was invited to a banquet i= Abu Dhabi held in his honor, where the ruler of Abu Dhabi congratulated h=m on his 
success.&nbsp;</span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:18.0pt">The Gulf's immedi=te future is likely to be marked by many more 
such coup and countercoup at=empts. Several current monarchs are very old, and powerful factions in gro=ing royal 
families have coalesced around 
rival successors. In each of these cases, internecine contests will develo= and, given the high stakes involved, the 
involvement of foreign powers is=all but inevitable.</span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:18.0pt">In the end, however= the monarchies may all suffer from such 
meddling, for these regimes are o=ly as strong as the weakest links in their chain. An especially brittle mo=archy 
succumbing to pressure over Western 
involvement, Iran, or Israel could easily be the first domino to fall, und=ing the illusion of invincibility that the Gulf 
monarchies have so painsta=ingly built to distinguish themselves from the floundering Arab republics =ext 
door.</span></p>
