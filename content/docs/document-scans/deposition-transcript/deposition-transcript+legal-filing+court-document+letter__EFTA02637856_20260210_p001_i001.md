This is a vi=it to pay tribute and to express gratitude. 
It has not only been the Kuwaiti leadership in humanitarian act=on but when I was High Commissioner for 
Refugees, I remember how the media=of Kuwait presided to the same conferences to mobilize international commu=ity 
to support the Syrian people suffering so much with the war that has b=en going on and on. My predecessor Ban Ki-
Moon has nominated His Highness =s Humanitarian Leader globally. But its not only the humanitarian leadersh=p of 
Kuwait: it's the wisdom, the dialogue, the promotion of under=tanding that Kuwait has been showing in relation to all 
conflicts in the r=gion and Kuwait has no agenda. The agenda of Kuwait is peace and understan=ing. In relation to the 
recent crisis that occurred in the Gulf, the posit=on of the United Nations is very simple; we are here to support the 
Kuwait= mediation and this was an occasion for me to express our deep appreciatio= to say how much we want to 
strengthen the cooperation and the dialogue be=ween Kuwait and the U.N. as we believe Kuwait is an extremely reliable 
par=ner in our common commitment to peace and security around the world. 
We had the opportunity to discuss all =he very difficult situations we are facing, not only the Gulf crisis, Yeme=, 
Syria, the drama of the Palestinian people, Libya, the need to make sure=lraq is able to come together in unity after 
defeating ISIS. So all these =spells were discussed in a very detailed way and I had the opportunity, on=e again, to 
discuss my deep appreciation for all the initiatives Kuwait ha= had in relation to the solution to this crisis. We also 
discussed the sit=ation in the Gulf and many of the humanitarian objectives that Kuwait has =een leading and that we 
fully support. 
We are doing our best to create conditions for the present stalemate=to be overcome. Kuwait was extremely 
successful in the first conference th=t was made and we will be working very closely with the Yemen authorities =o see 
when and how a new strong initiative for peace would be possible. 
We are not facing any pressure an= we conceded that no pressure would lead to anything. But we are not 
havin= any pressure, there is technical work being conducted and in the end that=will be presented to me and I will take 
the decision according to what I w=ll feel is the right thing to do. 
First of all, there is an initiative that my special representative is tr=ing to push in order to create conditions for 
both Hodeidah and Sanaa to a=low for an effective use for humanitarian purposes for these two very impo=tant 
infrastructures. I hope that it will be possible for an agreement to =e achieved between the parties to allow for 
Hodeidah and Sanaa to be fully=operational for the humanitarian needs of the Yemeni people who are suffer=ng in such 
a terrible way and deserves our solidarity and commitment.
