Thank you. 
A couple quick comments and questions we should prep for. 
Slide 2: Wayne — you (or we) will get asked about the 1 in AFCs queue from Feb. Not sure which one this is, but if there 
is any chance of reviewing it (and approving it!) before the call Monday it would be great to say Jan and Feb are 100% 
done. AB: Last Submitted on April 2nd. There is a note in the case stating : Waiting on more information from the 
Global Team. KYC Case # 1904641 - CAPUTO, JORGE ANTONIO RELATIONSHIP 
If we are only 10% approved in June and we're nearly half way through the month (by June 111, when do we 
think we'll be done with Q2? AB: Daphne can you speak with Nick and Vinita on this and revert back 
Slide 3: 
None of these should be reporting as overdue, since they are not due yet. AB: Correct. Updated 
There is a spike in August of 148 cases. We will need to explain this. Is this because a lot of customers are 
associated with one relationship, for example? How do we get ahead of this, e.g. if there are only 46 left to complete in 
July, do we think we could accelerate some of the August cases forward? AB: Customers within 45 different 
relationships are due. S of those relationships represent approx. 50% of the customers due. See list of relationships 
below. The case manager teams will start to work on these MAP as they get through the July volumes (some have 
already been started). I will liase with Daphne / allocation of Case managers to bankers will be adjusted as needed to 
get through the volumes

Slide 4: 
HR Status — numbers don't make sense, please review. If there were 258 due and 247 approved how are 59 
overdue? AB: Inadvertently had an incorrect figure for approvals: Total due is 258. Approved is 199 and 59 
overdue. Updated Slide 
The second main bullet seems to be missing something. Does this mean 23 are pending documentation or 
research? - For the 30 in rejected status, 23 ore pending client documentation, research 7 are pending with the RM/ 
Case Manager/Banker. AB: Client documentation or Research — updated to add or 
Given the current ABR resource gap a decrease in the moderate and low risk backlog for this segment is expected to be 
realised beginning 2H 2018 —Can we really say this? I don't believe it...A8: I used this specific messaging as it aligns to 
messaging Oliver sent Jan Wagener (email dated June 4th) "ABR team covering corresponding reviews and approval in 
staffing mode (S out of 9 FTE in place) with hiring respectively training expected to be completed in June / July, hence 
decrease of backlog for this segment expected to be realised beginning 2H 2018 
I would make everything from slide Son an Appendix and not clear if we should keep slide 6 or 8. AB: Removed Slide 6 
and 8 and moved slide 5 and 6 to appendix 
I do think you could put most of slide 4 into an exec summary, but we need to note: AB: Moved slide 4 to Executive 
Summary slides with a few updates
