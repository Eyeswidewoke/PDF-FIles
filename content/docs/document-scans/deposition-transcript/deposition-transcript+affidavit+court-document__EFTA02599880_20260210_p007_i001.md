Not your business, but one =hing that shocked me about Harry's letter was his complaint that I 
mov=d from a house to a "new home" -- insinuation obvious -- in fact=an apartment with no winter driving to my office 
and convenient for someon= my age.

As for the specifics of disclosure, what = need to consider is (a) what your income was in 
2017, since that was the =asis for the tax payments you seek to have reimbursed, (b) what your income is likely to be 
this year and going forward, (c) what=your expenses were in 2017 and are likely to be in 2018, and (d) whether a=y of 
your income (or other resources) are being used for purposes that the=trust cannot support (such as gifts to third 
parties). So far, Rich has provided me with some roughrinformation about your 2017 expenses. There are some gaps in 
that in=ormation, but nothing that can't be cleared up pretty easily (I th=nk). Rich has also assured me that you have 
not made any gifts that have diminished your resources and I assume you would confi=m that to me. What I don't have 
at this point is enough information about your in=ome, so that I can consider what the gap is between your expenses 
and your=income, which is the gap the trusts might help to close up. With res=ect to your income in 2017, all I can see is 
that your income tax obligations seem to be much higher than they were pre=iously. I'm assuming that reflects a jump 
in income from (i)=the profit made on the sale of the condominium, and (ii) large withdrawals=from your IRA. If you 
want to provide me with more information (bearing in mind what I noted in item 83, above) then inf=rmation about 
your 2017 income and what your income is likely to be this y=ar is what I most need. 
There is a very simple reason for the income =ax obligations. The depletion of the IRA that I 
reviewed again above=imposed a huge tax burden, which we were still attempting to deal with in 2017. After Harry's 
refusal to release some fund= from the trust to pay the exorbitant taxes resulting from what was happen=ng, I of course 
had to withdraw funds from the IRA to pay taxes on the who=e estate, incurring a new exorbitant tax burden. Despite 
some small relief later from the trust after I had r=peatedly pointed this out, it carried over through the 2017 tax 
bill.Q=A0 So for that reason, taxes were extremely high. That curious episo=e is at last finally over, leaving many 
questions unresolved about what was happening while I was paying little attention, r=lying on advisers to ensure that 
matters were proceeding appropriately 
I hope this is helpful an= will wait to hear more from you and/or Rich.
