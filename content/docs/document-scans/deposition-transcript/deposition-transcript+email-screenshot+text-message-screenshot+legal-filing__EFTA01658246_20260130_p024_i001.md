Reuters (7/29) reports, "China on Wednesday denied protecting fugitive financier Low Taek Jho, 
being sought by global investigators over his role in the multi-billion dollar 1MDB scandal." Low, 
"popularly known as Jho Low, has been charged in Malaysia and the United States over 
allegations that he orchestrated the theft of $4.5 billion from state fund 1Malaysia Development 
Berhad (1MDB), co-founded by former prime minister Najib Razak. Low has consistently denied 
wrongdoing." Reuters adds, "Malaysia's national police chief Abdul Hamid Bador was reported 
by newspaper Utusan Malaysia as saying Low was hiding in Macau and that attempts to 
extradite him had failed as Chinese authorities 'appeared insincere' in their efforts to cooperate. 
Chinese authorities rejected the accusations as 'groundless and unacceptable', saying that 
police had investigated all possible leads but were unable to trace Low."

Trump Defends Use Of COVID-19 Bill To Fund New FBI HQ. 
Reuters (7/29) reports that President Trump on Wednesday "defended his push to use a 
coronavirus relief package to fund a new FBI headquarters near his Washington hotel despite 
opposition from fellow Republicans, citing his background as a real estate developer." The bill, 
"facing tense negotiations in the Senate before multiple provisions aimed at helping Americans 
stave off financial losses amid the coronavirus pandemic expire on Friday, is on shaky ground 
with the White House at odds with both Democrats and Trump's own Republicans, who control 
the chamber." Trump "at first did not directly answer a question about whether he would drop 
his demand for $1.8 billion to fund a new FBI headquarters in downtown Washington one block 
from Trump International Hotel. He later said the provision 'should stay.' 'Republicans should go 
back to school and learn,' he told reporters at the White House. 'I'm very good at real estate." 
The Hill (7/29, Carney, 2.98M) reports, "Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.), the No. 2 Senate 
Republican, on Wednesday said that there is not 'a lot' of support for including funding for a 
new FBI building in a coronavirus relief bill. 'I think it came as a surprise to a lot of people that 
the funding for the FBI building was in the bill. They'd have to make a better argument than 
what I've seen so far' Thune said. 'I don't think there's a lot of support from our members for 
issues in the bill that are not directly related to the coronavirus,' he added." Trump, "speaking 
from the White House on Wednesday morning, criticized GOP senators who have been critical of 
its inclusion, saying they should 'go back to school and learn.' 'They have been trying to build a 
new building for many, many years,' Trump told reporters at the White House as he was 
departing for a trip to Texas on Wednesday morning." 
CNN (7/29, Klein, 83.16M) reports, "White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany was 
pressed Wednesday on why a coronavirus stimulus bill includes $1.75 billion for a new FBI 
building. 'So, this was part of the President's priority of updating the FBI building, keeping it in 
DC, and it's been one of the things that's been mentioned that's in this bill and it's a part of one 
of the President's priorities and it's been a priority for several months,' she said during an 
appearance on CBS News. Asked again what that provision was doing in the coronavirus bill, 
McEnany couldn't say, but said it is 'not a dealbreaker." Trump "said later Wednesday" that "he 
thought it was 'crazy' that they would consider moving it to the suburbs of Virginia or 
Maryland." 
The Hill (7/29, Chalfant, 2.98M) reports, "Trump said proposals to move the FBI building 
to Maryland or Virginia would have taken the bureau too far away from the Justice Department 
in downtown Washington, D.C." 
Fox News (7/29, Phillips, 27.59M) quotes Trump as saying, "I said, 'Let's build a new FBI 
building, either a renovation of the existing or. even better, let's build a new building.' So, we 
have that in the bill. It should stay, people have wanted a new FBI building now for 15-20 
years." "'But Republicans don't want it in the bill,' a reporter informed Trump. 'Then Republicans 
should go back to school and learn you need a new building,' the president said. 'It's a bad
