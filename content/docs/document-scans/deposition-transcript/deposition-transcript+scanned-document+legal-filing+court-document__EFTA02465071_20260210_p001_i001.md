Lets start. =AO I am aware that you are currently angry at the world. . =AO me, karp wechsler. even yourself, all 
willing absorbers of the current high heat. (though you =AO ,calling me ,Debra , did take away some of the sting ) =A0 
I am sorry to see you this way. 
emblematic ;=C2 I was asked to opine on whether to hire castrucci= an hour after I gave a preliminary yes. . l=called 
you then texted you that i had thought more about it and changed my mind. =AO The next day brad called and asked 
for my vote. I told him ,in no uncert=in terms it is a no , I categorically vote no. =C2 I called you . you came to see 
me . I said it was a bad idea. you said you were go=ng to do it anyway , I said and followed up in writing IT IS A =(STAKE 
. and added Please don't come back to me with anything suggesting=20 otherwise , you and I should be clear I think it 
is wrong . A v=ry strong NO . you of course can hire whomever you like. 
<=div> 
early on I told you I thought Tom remarkably careless . Eil=een goofy and your art lawyer not well informed to say the 
least. you to=d me Tom was a senior partner. Eileen had headed the trading desk , and Ralp= Lerner had to know what 
he was doing as he wrote the book. . =1 said I thought you deserved better ,should get better people and no , I am not 
an HR person. yesterday y=u told me that the reason you have hired whomver you could find was to avoid=20 being 
dependent on me. a decision by far , not the best place t= try to save money ) 
Joslin- who you say I hire= . I neither found nor hired. With a two person given choice l=approved joslin over some 
woman that eileen pref=rred. against my repeated advice you and eileen decided the pay range at under 300k . I told 
you at that time that = would personally pay the difference for a higher quality person= that was years ago . I have 
sent over a hundred emails to you clearly sa=ing he needs to be closely managed by better professionals. ini=ially , 
that referred to Eillen and Ada.and after= brad. john etc. THere are many emails each and every month from me, 
telling you , he is slipping failing cracking fragile.. crazy, n=ts, heading towards incompetence. Unless YOU- TAKE 
ACTION! when I pressur=d him for accurate numbers , you told him, to tell me, that he works for yo= and NOT for me.. 
When I continued to press for accuracy<=span> from your office , you told me that they were now all afraid o= me and 
i should let brad communicate any requests, ( you now tell me " we=20 know what Brad is"?). When I told you you office 
needs to be reviewed=20 and changed you told me i was being destructive rather than constructive. when i ultimately 
confronted joslin= in an attempt to protect you, told him that his numbers were wildly inaccurate , you told me that i 
had caused his ultimate resignation=C2 and now have an affirmative obligation to fill in the resultant gap. =C2 
I did give you a bad number, and apologized as soon as i realized it. =n error that was an embarrassment for me , the 
fact that that th= accurate number is still way below what you agreed to pay , has falle= by the wayside.( the 
preposterous argument that the end of year transaction was Alans idea , which you now know was not =rue and that 
me not receiving Phaidon documents was une=plainable. was your justification though, for non - full payment =A0) 
Hopefully You will recall that when you initially asked for my help= I declined repeatedly with the admonition that 
that having a financial arrangement is fraught with danger and could complitcate our friends=ip (as you will be 
unhappy paying what you will view as a large sum. while choosing to ignore=20 the financial benefits, ). In Bedford , I 
repeated=my concern. THe current circumstance is distressing to me , =AO I have done my utmost to keep you safe. 
and wil= continue to do so. reckless choices in accounting or otherwise does not bode well. at each turn = have put 
your interests first, including in some instances attempting to f=ght your choices.
