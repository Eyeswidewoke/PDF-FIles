Prosecution Rests in Trial of Karen Read Who's Charged in Death of Boston Police Officer Boyfriend 
The Associated Press (05/29, Whittle, Casey) reported that the prosecution in the second trial of Karen Read rested 
Thursday after about a month of testimony spotlighting evidence from the scene and witnesses who heard the 
defendant repeatedly say "I hit him" in reference to the killing of her Boston police officer boyfriend. According to 
the article, Read, 45, is accused of backing her SUV into her boyfriend, John O'Keefe, and leaving the 46-year-old 
officer to die on a snowy night in the front yard of another officer's home after she dropped him off at a party 
there in January 2022. Her lawyers say she was framed in a police conspiracy and someone in the home that night 
killed him. A mistrial was declared last year and the second trial has attracted massive media attention and become 
the subject of a Hulu documentary series. Read's second trial on charges of second-degree murder, manslaughter 
and leaving the scene has often looked similar to the first trial. If she is found guilty of the most serious charge of 
second-degree murder, she could spend the rest of her life in prison. The trial could easily continue several more 
weeks as Read's defense team makes its case. Read has said the defense's case will be "more robust" this time. It 
listed over 90 witnesses who could testify. Read's defense has vigorously questioned the prosecution's witnesses 
and called into question the evidence presented about O'Keefe's death 
Feds Target Chinese Couple Accused in $9 Million Crypto 'Pig Butchering" Scam 
USA TODAY (05/29, Hughes) reported that federal officials are trying to seize more than $6 million in 
cryptocurrency they say represents the ill-gotten gains of a Chinese couple's "pig butchering" scam left behind 
when they fled the United States one step ahead of the cops. Prosecutors say the $6 million sitting in four 
electronic wallets was left behind by Feng Chen and Tianqiong Xu as they fled to China last year, days after the FBI 
searched their home. They were indicted in June 2024 by a federal grand jury in Vermont. According to the article, 
court records filed May 22 indicate the married couple specifically targeted people of Chinese heritage across the 
United States. Prosecutors accuse the couple of ripping off at least $9.5 million from from least 120 victims, 
operating from their five-bedroom house in Frisco, Texas. 
FBI and Others Investigating Possible Florida Permit Fraud 
WINK News (05/29, Jean) reported that hundreds of homes in Collier County are now under scrutiny as part of a 
federal, state, and local investigation into questionable permits. A retired architect's seal is at the center of the 
controversy, and the investigation is raising concerns for homeowners affected by the unauthorized use of the 
seal. Gene Cravillion, a well-known architect, is now 91 years old and has lived in a north Naples assisted-living 
facility since August 2022. Gene's son said that as he grew older, he developed dementia, which ultimately led to 
him retiring from a 60-year career working in several states including Wisconsin, California and Florida. According 
to the article, even after Cravillion's retirement, it appears several people continued using his architect's seal to 
obtain permits. Now, the FBI and the Florida Board of Architecture and Interior Design with the DBPR and are some 
of the agencies that have opened investigations. In February at a committee hearing, Collier County officials 
revealed that at least 400 permits are involved, affecting both single-family homes and commercial buildings. That 
number has likely grown. John McCormick, Collier County's Director of Building Review and Permitting called this 
situation "substantial fraud."

Enforcement activity in the eastern part of the city. "We heard of five different detentions yesterday alone," said

outlet has learned those agents were assisting the Department of Homeland Security with immigration 
enforcement. In a statement, a spokesperson for the FBI wrote, in part, "The FBI in Pittsburgh continues to provide 
investigative, technical, and analytical support to our partners at the Department of Homeland Security in their 
immigration operations all over the region as directed by the attorney general."
