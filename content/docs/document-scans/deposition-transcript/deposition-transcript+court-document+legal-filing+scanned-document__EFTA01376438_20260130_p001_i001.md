(vi) 
If, prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default, the Issuer shall 
not have given any investment directions pursuant to Section 10.2(aXv), the 
Trustee shall seek instructions from the Collateral Manager within three Business 
Days after transfer of such funds to the Collection Account. If the Trustee does 
not thereupon receive written instructions from the Collateral Manager within five 
Business Days after transfer of such funds to the Collection Account, it shall 
invest and reinvest the funds held in the Collection Account, as fully as 
practicable, but only in one or more Eligible Investments of the type described in 
clause (vi) of the definition thereof maturing no later than the Business Day 
immediately preceding the next Payment Date. After the occurrence of an Event 
of Default, the Trustee shall invest and reinvest such Cash as fully as practicable 
in Eligible Investments of the type described in clause (vi) of the definition 
thereof maturing not later than the earlier of (i) 30 days after the date of such 
investment and (ii) the Business Day immediately preceding the next Payment 
Date. All interest and other income from such investments shall be deposited in 
the Interest Collection Subaccount, any gain realized from such investments shall 
be credited to the Collection Account, and any loss resulting from such 
investments shall be charged to the Collection Account. The Trustee shall not in 
any way be held liable by reason of any insufficiency of the Collection Account 
resulting from any loss relating to any such investment. 
(vii) 
During the Reinvestment Period and, to the extent permitted 
hereunder, thereafter, the Collateral Manager, acting as agent on behalf of the 
Issuer, may by Issuer Order direct the Trustee to, and upon receipt of such Issuer 
Order the Trustee shall, invest Principal Proceeds (and Interest Proceeds to the 
limited extent described in Section 12.2) and, if applicable, funds on deposit in the 
Ramp-Up Account pursuant to Section 7.19 in Collateral Obligations as permitted 
under and in accordance with the requirements of Article 12 and such Issuer 
Order. 
(viii) The Trustee shall transfer to the Payment Account for application 
pursuant to the Priority of Payments and in accordance with the calculations and 
the instruction contained in the applicable Payment Date Report, on or prior to the 
Business Day prior to each Payment Date, amounts constituting Interest Proceeds 
and Principal Proceeds for such Payment Date; except that, to the extent that the 
Principal Proceeds for such Payment Date are in excess of the amounts required 
to be applied pursuant to the Priority of Payments on the next Payment Date as 
shown in the applicable Payment Date Report, the Issuer may direct the Trustee to 
retain such excess amounts in the Principal Collection Subaccount for investment 
in Eligible Investments and not to transfer such excess amounts to the Payment 
Account. 
(ix) 
The Issuer may, at any time during or after the Reinvestment 
Period, upon the direction of the Collateral Manager, by Issuer Order direct the 
Trustee to, and upon receipt of such Issuer Order the Trustee shall, pay from
