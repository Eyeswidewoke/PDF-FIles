Joshua Fink: I did not mean it...I was frustrated and stressed 
Joshua Fink: And upset 
Joshua Fink: LI know I did not mean it 
Joshua Fink: And u know I love u very much 
: At least you didn't have to think how to stay in the country<=r> 
And I would be in 
Moscow now if Jeffrey hadn't helped 
Joshua Fink: And then I thought you went off and married some guy 
aou 
told me to do so 
Joshua Fink: I did not mean it...l was very frustrated and upset 
You wished me good luck with that 
Joshua Fink: When you came back all dressed up from meeting a potential fut=re husband....my whole 
face got red 
Joshua Fink: U saw how upset I was 
U know that I loved only you - but I needed help, not you being upset at me. My visa situation 
is not my fault, it was a problem that needed to be solved. 
Joshua Fink: I love u so much lanichka 
Joshua Fink: Lanichka 
Joshua Fink: See some good in me 
I thought if you were really sure I was your soulmate and your future - u would help. I love u 
and I m sure you love me, but perhaps u were not sure about future with me. Otherwise, I don't understand 
As I said you were ready to take financial responsibility, but no= emotional. 
Joshua Fink: We should sit down and have a heart to heart talk 
Joshua Fink: I can come see u next week in paris 
Joshua Fink: Or week after that 
And yes - I would go live with u in a little house in the woods, but if the woods requires a 
special entry permit that only you have - how can i do that? 
Joshua Fink: If u make me truly believe that you would...I will marry you Joshua Fink: I have been 
married once....and when I do it again, it will be=forever 
Joshua Fink: I promise that if I believe you would go live in the little cabin in the woods with me. I will 
marry you and start a family 
Joshua Fink: I liked when u cleaned me 
Joshua Fink: When u did not cook for me...did not think you were serious 
Joshua Fink: Or trying things with other girls 
Joshua Fink: I love u 
told you that I would learn to cook when I find a good teacher - and I did. And I've been 
taking my Jewish studies very seriously, I did some reading, went to services and have been in touch with my Rabbi. And 
I told you I was very excited about playing with girls. In 1.5 years I proved that I was very serious about you and our 
future. However, I did not get the same certainty from you. Now I do need some time to think. I will talk to you at the 
end of the week and let you know whether we are meeting in Paris. Now I have to believe that you would follow me to 
the little cabin..= 
Joshua Fink: Why would we not meet in paris? 
and he has asked 6 times if Elon has given me anything? and what did el=n give me? - i ignored 
and again blabbing about how special we were, th=t he never loved or felt like this about anyone, how i 
could calm him down=after a stressful day (also mentioned that i could not hike for many hours=- but eventually since i 
m in better shape now - he thinks i could enjoy h=king more; ), that he liked how i invented new things in bed and 
always wa=ted to try new things and how great it was; etc etc
