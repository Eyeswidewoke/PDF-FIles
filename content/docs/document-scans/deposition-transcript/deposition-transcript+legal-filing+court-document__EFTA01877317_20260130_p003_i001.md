The contrast between the fate of English- and French-language bookstores is playing out in Paris these days. 
Next month, after 30 years in business, the leading English-language Paris bookstore will close. For a generation 
authors like David Sedads, Susan Sontag, Raymond Carver and Don DeLillo gave talks and readings at the store, 
the Village Voice, on one of the chicest streets of St.-Germain-des-Pres. 
"When Stephen Spender gave a talk, Mary McCarthy was in the audience," Hazel Rowley wrote in a 2008 essay on the 
bookstore. "One evening Edmund White introduced Jonathan Raban, with Bruce Chatwin among the audience." 
But the Village Voice could not survive the deep discounting of Amazon and sellers of e-books. 
The specter of loss hovered over a party there Saturday night, when hundreds of well-wishers crammed into the store 
and spilled out onto the narrow street to mourn its passing. 
"I want you to know what a privilege it was to have you come and sit with me in my dark and cramped little den at the 
back of the bookshop, to chat, talk about books, about your own work and about life," said Odile Hellier, the 
founder and owner. "I will dearly miss those moments and can only hope that there will be another dark little 
den where I can sit and share ideas, and all the rest." 
It may have to be in a French-language bookstore like L'Usage du Monde across town in the heart of a gentrifying 
neighborhood of the 17th Arrondissement, which will celebrate its first anniversary in August. 
The owners, Katia and Jean-Philippe Perou, received grants from the National Center of the Book in the Culture 
Ministry and the Paris regional government and an interest-free loan from a group with the unwieldy name the 
Association for the Development of the Bookstore of Creation. 
"We couldn't have opened our bookstore without the subsidies we received," Ms. Perou said. "And we couldn't 
survive now without fixed prices." 
Beneath the surface there are predictions that France is only delaying the inevitable, and that sooner or later market 
forces will prevail. Despite the appeal of the neighborhood bookstore 13 percent of French books were bought 
on the Internet in 2011. 
An agreement that Google announced this month with the French Publishers Association and the Societe des Gens de 
Lettres, an authors' group, should allow publishers to offer digital versions of their works for Google to sell. Until 
now sales of e-books have lagged in France and much of the rest of Europe in part because of disputes over 
rights. 
"We are in a time of exploration, trial and error, experimentation," Bruno Racine, president of the French national 
library, wrote in his 2011 book, "Google and the New World." "Many scenarios are envisioned. The least 
probable is certainly that of a victorious resistance of the paper book." 
A 59-page study by the Culture Ministry in March made recommendations to delay the decline of print sales, including 
limiting rent increases for bookstores, emergency funds for booksellers from the book industry and increased 
cooperation between the industry and government. 
"Running a bookstore is a combat sport," the report concluded. 
One tiny operation determined to preserve the printed book is Circur byre. 
On the third Sunday of every month this organization takes over a corner of the Rue des Martyrs south of Montmartre. 
A small band of retirees classify used books by subject and display them in open crates. 
The books are not for sale. Customers just take as many books as they want as long as they adhere to an Informal code 
of honor neither to sell nor destroy their bounty. They are encouraged to drop off their old books, a system that 
keeps the stock replenished.
