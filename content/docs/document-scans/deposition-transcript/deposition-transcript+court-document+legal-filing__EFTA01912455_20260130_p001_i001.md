Ian, 
Ghislaine, of all people, should beware of what is found on the web... 
In any case, that matter was fully and completely resolved a while ago. The case was fully withdrawn by 
the plaintiff party during the discovery process, as they found out that they did not have a case 
against us at all, and were missing some important details, like the fact that it was not me who 
defrauded them, but their own internal partner. 
We have not had the funds to get the article removed, which requires a lawyer to go after that site. 
In proper context: 
What you saw was a press release (based on a one-sided Court pleading, not on any facts, and where 
you can make any sort of assertion). issued after a lawsuit was filed against both myself and Isabel 
by Ensign Consulting, a while back concerning some very expensive antiquarian books and an 
original iconic portrait of Sir Isaac Newton that I had purchased some time previously. The suit was 
easily and fully resolved during the discovery period when I was able to prove beyond any question 
that one of Ensign's own consultants Adam Gold (mentioned in the article) and a former friend of 
Isabel's and mine, secretly and without our knowledge, secured a personal loan for himself using my 
own valuable books and possessions as his own collateral! This was an amazing thing for us to have 
found out, as he was a friend of ours. 
While I was writing Adam telling him of my my own personal business purchases, he secretly told 
Ensign Consulting (I didn't know them or have any correspondence or dealings with them and neither 
did Isabel) that these purchases were his own purchases, and he independently got a six figure 
personal loan for himself using my possessions as his collateral, completely and utterly unknown 
to us. 
When Adam defaulted on his loan to Ensign, of course, they went ballistic, and naturally went after me, 
as they thought I was the one responsible, and had the collateral. Yet, the books that Adam had 
secretly borrowed against were fully paid for by me, and Adam had not sent any money for them, 
and the funds that he did send, were sent back. I was able to show through bank wire statements, 
invoices, and correspondence between myself and Adam, that he had not purchased these books on 
behalf of Ensign, and that they were entirely my property, and that I could do with them as I wished. I 
also was able to show that I had no knowledge of Ensign or the loan. as I had retained all my 
correspondence with Adam, which detailed his own financial perilous financial state. Most 
importantly, Gold could not produce any banking information to substantiate the claim that he took 
the money that he received from Ensign, and gave it to me to purchase these items. Therefore, 
Ensign was not able to sue me or pursue the suit against us for books that I had fully paid for myself. 
They then dropped the matter quickly.
