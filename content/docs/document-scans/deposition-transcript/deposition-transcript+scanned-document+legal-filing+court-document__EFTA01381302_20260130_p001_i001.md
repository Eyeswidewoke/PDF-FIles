Our Organization: "The Herd" 
Our company culture is an integral part of our strategy and one of our founding objectives is being a great place to work. We have a 
strong and dedicated team of employees we refer to as "the Herd," where each one of us is a "Buff." Our company culture is built on 
entrepreneurship, collaboration, a commitment to Blue Buffalo's minion, a competitive spirit and a friendly, casual work environment. As of 
March 31, 2015, we employed approximately 1,700 Buffs, including full-time and part-time Buffs, none of whom was represented by a labor 
union. We believe we have a good relationship with our team members and that our company culture is a key competitive advantage and a strong 
contributor to our success. 
We have a strong and experienced management team. with our founders playing an active role in the business. We have a deep bench of 
senior leaders with strong business and operational experience from major CPG and public companies across all business functions working closely 
as the Herd Leadership Team. Our Chief Executive Officer. Kurt Schmidt. has decades of leadership experience in CPG companies in the United 
States and overseas at Kraft, Wrigley, Novartis and Nettle, where he most recently led Nestle's 58 billion global Health & Wellness Division. Our 
President and Chief Operating Officer and co-founder, Billy Bishop. has been leading marketing and operations since our founding in 2002. Bill• 
provides us with the unique perspective of an entrepreneurial business builder having helped build the SoBe beverage brand before starting our 
company. Our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Nathenson, has a deep financial and strategic background in CPG companies from his leadership 
experience at PepsiCo and Dean Foods, where he was most recently the Chief Financial Officer of the Dean Foods Dairy Group. 
Our Operations: Scaled Pure-Play in the Wholesome Natural Market Segment 
We believe our scale allows us to compete effectively against both our larger and smaller competitors. Being one of the largest pet food 
companies in the United States and the #1 brand in the Wholesome Natural market segment provides us with significant scale advantages in ow 
supply chain. In September 2014. we commenced manufacturing operations at our I leartland facility. Once our Heartland facility ramps up to 
capacity. which we anticipate will be by the third quarter of 2015, we believe our hybrid network of owned and contracted manufacturing facilities 
will provide us with enhanced margin opportunities and greater flexibility in our supply chain. 
We focus on developing and marketing Wholesome Natural pet foods that we would want to find our own funy family members. Our 
exclusive focus on pet products enables us to identify and react to trends early, develop Wholesome Natural products that meet the needs of pets 
and their pet parents and execute with speed and efficiency. We believe being a pure-play with this focus on pet products gives us a competitive 
advantage compared to most of our major competitors who arc diversified CPG conglomerates. As the only Wholesome Natural pet food brand 
with a billion dollars of sales at retail, we possess operational and financial processes and tools that arc difficult for smaller companies to 
implement. For example, we successfully implemented SAP, a tier I ERP system, in 2013 and went live on January 1, 2014. We arc in the process 
of implementing internal controls over financial reporting required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which is ahead of the required 
schedule for an "emerging growth company." 
Our Manufacturing Network 
Our products, including those sold in Canada, are currently manufactured at our Heartland facility and through a network of 
manufacturing facilities that are owned and operated by third-party contract manufacturers across the United States. We intend to manufacture our 
products for the Mexican and Japanese markets using our manufacturing network in the United States. We expect our state-of-the-art Heartland 
facility will provide us with in-house dry food manufacturing of up to 30 million pounds a month and account for 50-60% of our forecasted dry 
food production needs over the next several years once it ramps up to capacity. Consistent with
