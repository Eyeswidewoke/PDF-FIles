I first met Erekat =n the late 1980s, while working on the Palestinian issue for then Secretar= of State George Shultz. 
Back then, the U.S.-educated diplomat was already=showing the brashness and outspokenness that would make him 
one of the most memorable -- if exasperating -- of the=Palestinians with whom we dealt. 
He annoyed then Sec=etary of State James Baker by wearing his kaffiyeh around his shoulders at=the opening of the 
Madrid Peace Conference in October 1991. And over the y=ars, he continued to annoy the Israelis too with his fiery 
performances on CNN -- though to this day, key Israeli =egotiators, such as Isaac Molho, continue to praise his 
pragmatism at the =argaining table. 
It was Erekat's aca=emic bent, analytical chops, and capacity to write in English that would m=ke him so indispensable to 
the only Palestinian who really counted in thos= days -- Yasir Arafat. Erekat was a unique figure -- neither a fighter (no 
nom de guerre for him), nor a PLO i=sider, nor an organization man from Tunis. Rather, he was a West Banker fr=m 
Jericho, and he succeeded in maintaining his relevance in a Palestinian =olitical scene dominated not by fellow 
academics, but by hard men defined by struggle and intrigue. During=the heady days of the peace process, he became a 
key point of contact for =he Americans, the Israelis, the Arabs, and much of the rest of the interna=ional community. 
I came to know Erek=t not only as a negotiator, but as a person. He sent his kids to Seeds of =eace, a conflict resolution 
and coexistence organization that I ran briefl= after leaving the State Department, and my daughter befriended his and 
stayed with the Erekats in Jericho. Sae= and I have yelled at each other, defended our respective positions, laugh=d, and 
mourned opportunities that were never adequately explored. But thro=gh it all, what he said about himself was true: He 
wasn't as pro-Palestinian or pro-Israeli as much as he was pr=-peace. 
That peace has prov=n elusive to this day. But with all our differences -- and there are many =- I believe Erekat believes 
in its possibility. Who else would list as an =quot;objective" on his resume: "Solve the Palestinian-Israeli conflict based 
on a two state negotiated solution thro=gh diplomatic offices"? 
If, or perhaps when= another effort to negotiate a deal is made, one thing is clear -- Erekat =ill be in the middle of it. Last 
week, he agreed to answer my questions on=the past and future of the Israeli-Palestinian problem. 
FP: What were your best and worst moments in the Israeli-Palestinia= negotiations, and what was the greatest missed 
opportunity? 
Saeb Erekat: Though I was not the chief negotiator at that moment= the connection between [then Prime Minister 
Yitzhak] Rabin and President =rafat made everyone around them, including myself, feel that peace was possible. There 
was significant progress in al= tracks until Rabin's assassination by an Israeli terrorist -- after he wa= killed, no Israeli 
leader had the vision to understand that the window of=opportunity for a two-state solution would close as fast as they 
continued their colonization policies. =/p> 
The missed opportunity has definitely b=en Israel throwing away the Arab Peace Initiative, which offers normalizat=on 
of relations of 57 countries with Israel in exchange for Israeli withdr=wal to the 1967 border. They threw it away by 
bombing Gaza, by intensifying collective punishments, and by in=reasing settlement construction all over the occupied 
West Bank, particula=ly in and around Occupied East Jerusalem. 
FP: 2013 is the 20th anniversary of the Oslo negotiations. What was=Oslo's greatest success, and its greatest failure? 
SE: The fact that, two decades after Oslo, we are still a nation un=er occupation shows that Israeli governments did 
derail it. The interim ac=ords were not supposed to last for 20 years but only five. After that, we were going to enjoy 
freedom and sov=reignty. 
But Israel increased its settlement exp=nsion. In fact, within 20 years, the number of settlers almost tripled. Th= 
institution-building efforts led by the Palestinian government have been =ompletely undermined by the lack of freedom.
