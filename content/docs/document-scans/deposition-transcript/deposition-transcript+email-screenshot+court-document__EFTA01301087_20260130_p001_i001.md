documnets that schulte had a meeting to disclose wrongdoing sept 06 BEFORE my withdrawal request and the

Yes, we are going to have Condren step in here on this issue as well as the Bear issues. We will have everyone get together 
this week, if possible, and then we will see what to do from there.

I think you should ask Wendall to recall the meeting he had with Sussman and Glenn. Glenn was unequivocal., 
adamant ,and loud in front of them both - that had he known about ziwm taking money for the airplane ( form 
the Highbridge acct no less , in dec of 04 ).. he would have immediatley told me to take all my money out . He 
said he would have taken all his money out .. We only receintly received the doc re garding the schulte 
meeting„ ( shulte was called in in investigate the problem ), where though my oral redemption request was in oct, 
and the written reduced demand on NOV. 13,schulte had a meeting in sept in which glenn attended, that informed 
Zwirn and Glenn of the problem in detail. ( wendall knows this!y I am aware of the issue being legal vs moral 
duty. However , the legal is abundantly clear once all the documents are reviewed, as opposed to only what 
wendalll has. I expressed in no uncertain terms in talking with Condren that I view this as a dispute ( Me vs JPM , 
in the Bear STearns case) as a family disagreement,. hopefully not discounted , by my well stated desire , never to 
file suit. that should not be a factor in a fair resolution of both issues. Im not sure if Condren can say Jeffreys 
claim is worth x- million if he were to file a claim , and only x minus, , now that we know he is unlikely to file
