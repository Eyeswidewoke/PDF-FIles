IAC subordinated loan facility 
Pnor to this offering, we will enter into an uncommitted subordinated loan facility with IAC, or the IAC Subordinated Loan Facility, pursuant to which we may 
make one or more requests to IAC to borrow funds from it. If IAC agrees to fulfill any such borrowing request from us. such indebtedness will be incurred in 
accordance with the terms of the IAC Subordinated Loan Facility. Any indebtedness outstanding under the IAC Subordinated Loan Facility will be by its terms 
subordinated in rigN of payment to the obligations under the Credit Agreement and the Match Notes. Such indebtedness will bear interest at the applicable 
rate set forth in the pricing grid in the Credit Agreement, which rate is based on our consolidated net leverage ratio at the time of borrowing, plus an additional 
amount to be agreed. The IAC Subordinated Loan Facility will have a scheduled final maturity date no earlier than 90 days after the maturity date of the 
Revolving Credit Facility or the latest maturity date in respect of any class of term loans outstanding under the Credit Agreement on the date we enter into 
such facility. The IAC Subordinated Loan Facility will contain events of default for non-payment, the occurrence of a change of control (which will include if 
IAC and certain permitted holders do not hold at least a majority of the aggregate voting power of all classes of our voting stock) and the occurrence of any 
event of default under the Credit Agreement or the New Indenture. 
Short term related-party Indebtedness 
After the initial public offering price has been determined, but prior to the completion of this offering, we will issue to IAC related-party indebtedness with an 
aggregate principal amount equal to the total net proceeds to us from this offering, assuming the underwriters exercise in kill their option to purchase 
additional shares. If the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional shares, such related-party indebtedness will be repaid in full with the 
net proceeds from this offering. If the underwriters do not exercise in full their option to purchase additional shares, we intend to incur additional borrowings 
under the Revolving Credit Facikty in order to repay the balance of the IAC related-party indebtedness. The IAC related-party indebtedness will bear interest 
at 2.25% per year and will mature within 30 days of the issuance of such indebtedness.

public market after the restrictions lapse could adversely affect the prevailing market price for shares of our common stock as well as our ability to raise equity 
capital in the future.
