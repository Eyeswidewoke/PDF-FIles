been in frequent touch with the head engineer earlier that day, exchanging no fewer than 13 text 
messages with him between 10:21 AM and 10:35 AM, according to the log of his cell phone. 
After receiving the 1:03 PM call, Sheehan headed to the Sofitel, which is about an hour and a 
half drive from his house. While en route, according to his cell phone records, he called the 
number 
in the United States. When I called the number a man with a heavy French 
accent answered and asked whom I wanted to speak with at Accor. The man I asked to talk 
to—and to whom I was not put through—was Rene-Georges Querry, Sheehan's ultimate superior 
at Accor and a well connected former chief of the French anti-gang brigades, who was now head 
of security for the Accor Group. Before joining Accor Group in 2003, he had worked closely in 
the police with Ange Mancini, who then became coordinator for intelligence for President 
Sarkozy. Querry, at the time that Sheehan was making his call to the 646 number, was arriving at 
a soccer match in Paris where he would be seated in the box of President Sarkozy. Querry denies 
receiving any information about the unfolding drama at the Sofitel at this time or until after DSK 
was taken into custody about four hours later. 
Another person at the Accor Group whom Sheehan (or the operator at Accor) might have 
alerted was Xavier Graff, the duty officer at the Accor Group in Paris. Graff was responsible that 
weekend for handling emergencies at Accor Group hotels, including the Sofitel in New York. His 
name only emerged five weeks later when he sent a bizarre e-mail to his friend Colonel Thierry 
Bourret, the head of an environment and public health agency, claiming credit for "bringing 
down" DSK. After the e-mail was leaked to Le Figaro, and it reported he said that he said that " 
nous avons reussi a 'faire tomber' DSK", Graff described it as a joke (it resulted, however, in his 
suspension as director of emergencies by the Accor Group). Even jokes can have a basis. In this 
case the joke was made by the person who was directly responsible for passing on information to 
his superiors, including the head of security at Accor, Rene-Georges Querry—information that, if 
acted on by informing the American authorities, could have helped destroy DSK's career. But like 
Query, Graff denied receiving any calls or messages from New York until later that evening, 
telling a French newspaper that the failure to inform him was an incredible blunder. 
Whatever communications might have passed between New York and Paris, the victim in the 
drama received no medical attention. The CCTV tape shows Diallo repeatedly pointing to 
different pans of her body over and gesturing with a series of hand movements. It appears to be a 
re-enactment of her story. At one point, she used the head housekeeper Markozina to play the part 
of her attacker. At 1:07 PM, the room service waiter, who is the only known person who may 
have witnessed her entry into the presidential suite, and was in the room only a minute before she 
entered, was brought into the apparent re-enactment. He can be seen in a discussion with the head 
engineer and Diallo. The CCTV tapes of course contained no sound component, so we do not 
know what was being said, but, if this was part of the re-enactment, at least two potential 
witnesses— the room service waiter, who had preceded Diallo in the room, and the head house 
keeper, who had heard her outcry on the 28" floor, had an opportunity to hear Diallo's version of 
the incident and refresh their memory before the police were called in.

It is not clear who finally made the decision to call the police. At 1:28 pm, the Accor Safety 
director, Sheehan, who was still on the way to the hotel, called the head engineer who had entered 
the security office. After that, the Sofitel's security man, Branch, made the 911 call. The 911
