Re: 
this tyoe of childish game is boring and disappointing. Instead of an hones= adult dialogue , do you think by not telling 
me -you are getting as yo= write " real answer " what does that mean? i am forced to deal =ith what you think i am 
doing, and why, and interpreting or misinterpretin= my answers, What we had, and I cherished , was open and honest.. 
yo= now want to play, hide the ball. i am unwilling to play. == I am =eft with having to guess your motivations, your 
decisions, your moods, the=outcome, THe ONLY I sent her home was because i didn't want you to =ay no, i an not 
coming now. I wanted you to come , so I had to guess at=the safest answer and consequently , without full knowledge, 
hope for the =esult.. This has gone too far. I think we need a serious rest. <=r>

Jeffrey, I thought you misunderstood what I was saying and now it is cle=r you did. 
I don't see a reason to tell you why I am asking about =ther girls staying because I want the real answer and not 
bullshit. I don&=39;t ask knowing what I would do either way but I like to make an informed=decision about extending 
my trip or not. 
If you thought I wouldn't come ifiwas there and you wanted me to come= my reason sounds like an ultimatum 
and is uncomfortable for you. If you d=dn't want me to come, instead of just saying that, now you would have-
stay because It makes it look like you are giving me a choice whil= really you just don't want me to come. Not because 
you couldn't s=y the truth ( you do! ) But because it is easier to make it sound like it&=39;s what I wanted... 
My flight is delayed till 9.25now.

according to you , you didn't want to =ell me why you asked me a question in case " i didn't want =ou to come 
and used tthe fact that 
was staying so you would =ot come. " avoids the real issue. If i did not want you to 
come= I would tell you so. you said i couldn't because you live in th= house. I said that somehow , if you believe you 
can come if i didn&=39;t want you to is crazy, however you find that statement " di=gusting". I asked you if you wanted 
to see for yourself that there=is no romance with aif 
so i would ask her to stay - i asked =ou if you prefer her to 
leave. I asked you what you want to do , I a=ked you about who should come to the house , and I asked you to propose 
a =olution. and then you say, nothing but i want to make my own decisio=s. You can and should make those decisions 
. Each one will have its ow= consequences„ some good some not so good . This is beyond silly. We are =ot getting along. 
I love you very much , but seem unable to communicate wi=h you .. you feel i am now picking on you. you tell me you 
dont start figh=s but in the next breath say yes i started a fight about 
and yes a=started the fight about
