her friend Monique Van Voorcn, both in their 80s, arc seated in front of the fireplace chatting in French. Production 
assistants fuss over them. Debonair macho man Chuck Pfieffer, who appeared in the original film, and I immediately 
invent a back story—I am his corporate wife—and we position ourselves on a couch next to the director's mother. 
Julia gets the best spot close to the piano and Amy, l arnish and decorator Geoffrey Bradfield are right behind her. 
Josh is brought in and the kibitzing stops. 
Oliver appears on the set with eagle eyes and a sly grin and quickly re-positions everyone. He explains the scene, 
gives out lines to his favored extras, and on his way out to the monitors in the next room mentions that my earrings arc 
too small. Wardrobe jumps. Josh rehearses and Oliver finally yells, "Action." The kid plays the piano, Josh explains 
why we are in his home, asks for money. the camera dollies as extras say their lines and Shia appears at the door

Marron saunters on the set to visit and Oliver spontaneously puts hint in a scene chatting with Josh. Carrie Mulligan 
hangs out watching boyfriend Shia work. 
At sundown Julia Koch has to race from reel to real life and explain to her husband where she has been all day. (He 
loves it) 
Chuck Pfieffer plants a "Page Six" item and the next day socialites begin calling me to get into the film. 
Thursday, November 5, Shun Lee Restaurant, West 65th Street 
Oliver shoots a crowded tight interior scene with Michael, Carrie and Shia. who are having an intimate Chinese 
dinner. Spontaneously, Oliver decides this is the perfect scene for Graydon Carter. After a flurry of calls, Graydon 
arrives on set, and playing himself, sashays by the table. Gekko jumps up to say hello and Graydon brushes him of 
with a few dismissive lines.
