MARKET, RANKING, AND OTHER INDUSTRY DATA 
The data included in this prospectus regarding markets, ranking. and other industry information arc based on reports of government 
agencies or published industry sources, and estimates are based on First Data management's knowledge and experience in the markets in which 
First Data operates. The Nilson Report. an industry source we cite in this prospectus, is generally published monthly. Data regarding the industries 
in which we compete and our market position and market share within these industries am inherently imprecise and arc subject to significant 
business, economic, and competitive uncertainties beyond our control, but we believe they generally indicate size, position, and market sham 
within these industries. Our own estimates arc based on information obtained from our trade and business organizations and other contacts in the 
markets in which we operate. We are responsible for all of the disclosure in this prospectus. and we believe these estimates to be accurate as of the 
date of this prospectus or such other date stated in this prospectus. However, this information may prove to be inaccurate because of the method by 
which we obtained some of the data for the estimates or because this information cannot always be verified with complete certainty due to the 
limits on the availability and reliability of raw data, the voluntary nature of the data gathering process, and other limitations and uncertainties. As a 
result, you should be aware that market. ranking. and other similar industry data included in this prospectus. and estimates and beliefs based on that 
data. may not be reliable. Neither we nor the underwriters can guarantee the accuracy or completeness of any such information contained in this 
prospectus.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
A substantial portion of our business is conducted through "alliances" with banks and other institutions. Where we discuss the 
operations of our Global Business Solutions segment. such discussions include our alliances because they generally do not have their own 
operations (other than certain majority owned and equity method alliances) and are part of our core operations. Our alliance structuns take on 
different forms, including consolidated subsidiaries, equity method invegments, and revenue sharing arrangements. Under the alliance program. we 
and a bank or other institution form a venture, either contractually or through a separate legal entity. Merchant contracts may be contributed to the 
venture by us and/or the bank or institution. The banks or other institutions generally provide card association sponsorship. clearing, and settlement 
services. These institutions typically act as a merchant referral source when the institution has an existing banking or other relationship. We provide 
transaction processing and related functions. Both we and our alliance partners may provide management. sales, marketing. and other 
administrative services. The alliance structure allows us to be the processor for multiple financial institutions, any one of which may be selected by 
the merchant as their bank partner.
