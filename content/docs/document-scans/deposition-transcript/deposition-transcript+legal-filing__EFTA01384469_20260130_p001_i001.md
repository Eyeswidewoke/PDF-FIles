Long•Term Asset Return Study: The Next Financial Crisis 
Candidates for the next Financial Crisis 
In this section we'll highlight some of the potential candidates for the next 
financial crisis. This is far from a prediction that they will occur but merely to 
show where some of the stresses are in the financial system and ones that 
could create global financial and economic problems. The list is also not 
exhaustive. Crises and shocks by their nature are unpredictable and while we 
might be right that the current system is crisis prone, we may be missing a 
brewing problem elsewhere under our noses! So we're more confident that 
crises can't be avoided in this global financial framework rather than confident 
of where they'll occur next. Nevertheless, there are places we can look to and 
the following section details where vigilance and prudence are required. 
The Great Central Bank unwind 
When looking for the next financial crisis, it's hard to escape from the fact that 
we're seemingly in the early stages of the 'great unwind' of global monetary 
stimulus at the same time as global debt remains at all-time highs following an 
increase over the past decade - at the government level at least - which has 
been unparalleled in peacetime history. Not only are interest rates starting to 
rise (e.g. US, Canada), but the Fed is about to start running down its balance 
sheet with the ECB likely to soon announce that the tapering of GE will 
continue in 2018. 
Working in financial markets on a day to day basis it's easy to become blasé 
about the size of central bank balance sheets. You slowly become anchored to 
believe the current situation is normal as it's persisted for so long now. 
However it's anything but normal. Since the financial crisis. $10 trillion plus 
has been added to the balance sheets of the four largest central banks with 
over $14 trillion of assets now owned. Since a local trough in March 2015, the 
ECB alone has added around $2.3 trillion to its balance sheet. To put these 
numbers into some perspective, the annual output of China - the world's 2nd 
largest economy and consisting of 1.4 billion people - is around $11.2 trillion -
not far off the balance sheet increases of the big four central banks since the 
GFC. Putting the ECB's increase over the last three years in some context, the 
French (6th largest in the world) and Indian (7th largest in the world) 
economies - consisting of 64.7 million and 1.3 billion people respectively -
produce an annual output of $2.5 trillion and $2.3 trillion respectively. So in 
just over two years the ECB has printed the same amount of money that it's 
taken the whole 1.3bn Indian population to produce economically in a year. 
Mindboggling numbers. 
Figure 32 shows the real adjusted balance sheet size of the largest four DM 
central banks through history. The Fed and BoE both have data starting from 
1914, while the Bundesbank has data from 1957 to 1999 (scaled up to the 
ECB's balance sheet size as of Dec 1998) and the ECB then from 1999 and 
finally the BoJ from 1971 onwards. It clearly shows how unique this current 
situation is relative to history and it has to be the case that this makes the 
financial system more unstable as a result. We also show just the Fed and BoE 
data as these two have a series going back at least a century whereas the first 
chart has data patched in where appropriate. The Bundesbank data clearly 
starts after the Weimar Republic money printing experiment of the 1920s so 
the second chart is perhaps a more faithful account of how unusual the last 
decade has been.
