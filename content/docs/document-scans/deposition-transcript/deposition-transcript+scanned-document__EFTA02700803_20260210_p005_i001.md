did not want to be limited by the amount of gold in their repositories. But. 
at the end of World War I and again at the end of WWII, nations did return 
to the gold standard. But they quickly experienced problems, problems that 
they had not had before. 
The supply of gold was growing too slowly and also too erratically to allow 
the supply of money to keep pace with growth in the world's developed 
economies. Money in the form of gold was not growing as rapidly as 
production in the post-World War II economics of the nations of the world. 
So for a time, the International Monetary Fund, and we will talk about 
them in a future kcture, attempted to keep the gold standard working by 
supplementing the supply of gold with paper gold that were called special 
drawing rights. But, the gold standard ended, as Redish reminds us, with 
President Nixon's decisions to suspend convertibility, to make a break 
between the number of U.S. dollars and the quantity of gold held by the 
United Stales. 
Today, in western economies, we have pure fiat monies that are backed 
by no commodity at all. The money is valued partly because governments 
declare the money to be "legal tender for all debts public and private." But 
ultimately, money is valued because people agree it is valuable. It is valued 
because people agree to accept money in exchange. It is valuable because 
people believe they can accept money and then turn around and purchase 
useful things whenever they wish. 
Four important themes have emerged from our examination of the evolution 
of money. First, money is truly a social contract in which the members of a 
society agree to accept money in exchange for goods and services. It is an 
act of faith for me to give something that is truly useful, an axe or a pound 
of meat, in exchange for a piece of paper that really would not even do a 
very good job of lighting a cigarette or starting a fire. It is true that the words 
"In God We Trust" are printed on the back of our bills. But if we want to 
understand why the dollar has value, we would be far better off with the 
words, "In One Another We Trust." 
Second, the social contract that is money has developed gradually through 
history because it has taken time to develop the trust necessary to exchange 
32 
something of intrinsic value, a pound of nails, for something of no intrinsic 
value, a British pound note. That trust had to be developed very slowly and 
had to be developed in the context of the codes. the laws, and the belief of 
the society that began to accept different forms of money. 
Third, the contract has developed as it has because members of society 
have constantly sought to meet 2 goals. I have always found that those 
goals to be in competition with one another. They have constantly sought 
ways of changing the money contract to lower the cost of trade. We want 
trade to be efficient and inexpensive, so that we could do more of it. But 
at the same time, we have wanted to make sure that we adopt a money that 
holds its value. Throughout history, government has played a crucial role 
in development of the money contract. From coordinating the choice of a 
particular commodity. to ensuring that the contracts made by goldsmiths 
were honored so those goldsmiths did not just renege, to setting up rules for 
the coining of precious metals, to developing laws that define the powers and 
responsibilities of the Federal Reserve. 
So, government is essential to organization of monetary arrangements, and 
that is not surprising. We are government. A fiat money system is highly 
efficient. Valuable metals such as gold and silver are not tied up as backing 
for money but are released to alternative uses in electronics, jewelry, and 
many other purposes. The Federal Reserve can allow the supply of money 
to keep pace with the growth in our nation. But our fiat money holds its 
value only if our Federal Reserve keeps the supply of money from growing 
too rapidly. If the Fed fails, inflation results, and inflation is the modem 
counterpart to seigniorage. 
Thank you very much.
