already embarked on a wide range of securiti=s markets reforms. But it will help embed the persistent political idea tha= 
retail banking is inherently 'safe' while investment banki=g and securities markets business is inherently 'risky. 
To=which recent events have added the taint of suspect ethical conduct. 
> For universal bank leaders who have come out of the securities world, this=is likely to be part of the challenge of 
dealing with politicians and regul=tors over the next few years. Politicians actively questioned Mr Diamond4=804bs 
credentials to lead a retail bank when he was appointed Barclays CEO=in 2011. His departure leaves an even greater 
burden on universal bank lead=rs to understand the growing political gap between the skillset desired of r=tail bank 
management and the caricature of the men and women who make a liv=ng on the trading desks. Mr Diamond 
maintained a glass office on the tradin= floor at Barcap even after his transition to leadership of Barclays; a ges=ure 
heavy with meaning for his critics. 
> Mr Diamond's instincts were to close this gap by championing a 4e=804ecitizenship' agenda for Barclays. The main 
problem with this i= not the agenda, or the work that was done by the bank in its name. It was t=e persistent 
undermining of this message by the perceived conduct of the ba=k itself. Not just questions of culture and character 
raised by the admissi=n that traders had sought to manipulate LIBOR rates for personal and instit=tional profit and the 
mis-selling of payments insurance and interest rate h=dges for small businesses. But also fundamental questions over 
the bank40.99s business model, the way it rewards its highest earners including Mr Dia=ond himself, its approach to its 
own tax affairs and the 'aggressiv=ness' of the tax services it provides to clients, irrespective of t=eir legality. In this, 
obviously Barclays is far from alone. 
> Politicians are at something of a loss as to how concretely to address the=e issues of values and character and this 
poses a particular challenge for b=nks. Culture is hard to regulate and the public have no real appetite or pa=ience for 
reassurances that a renewed rigour from supervisors will fix the p=oblem. The proxies for culture are going to be pay 
and senior accountabilit=, and these are the two things that ultimately tripped up Mr Diamond at Bar=lays. Although 
many in banking would like to argue that these things are b=side the point, politically they are the point. 
> Like much else in the current banking model, the case for remuneration lev=ls in banking is based purely on the logic 
and discipline of the free marke= for financial services. Yet the bailouts of 2008 and the LIBOR-fixing scan=al have further 
exhausted political and regulatory patience with the idea t=at banking exists in a free market. High levels of 
remuneration are also gl=ringly at odds with the wider economic context and the prevailing political=climate. George 
Osborne, the British Chancellor, has tried to accommodate L=ndon-based investment banks by resisting the rather rigid 
rules inserted at=the last minute by the European Parliament into the European CRD4 Directive=applying ratios for fixed 
and bonus pay at European banks. But in doing so h= is well aware that he is badly out of step with the public mood. 
> The accountability problem is as simple and blunt as politics gets. The ma=sive market disruptions of 2008 and the 
ensuing economic crisis have create= a latent political desire for personal accountability from the banking ind=stry that 
it has so far been unable to meet. In part this is because the mo=t egregiously managed institutions in the period leading 
up to 2008 have si=ply disappeared. The survivors are generally not inclined to feel implicate= in the industry's wider 
collective problems. Mr Diamond always see=ed to hint at the indignation of an executive whose bank had survived the 
b=nking crisis without direct government support and who felt he had little t= answer for, at least until his employees' 
malpractice made this un=enable. This is part of what made him such a lightning rod and figure of re=entment for many 
politicians. 
> The political fallout 
> How will this play out politically? The UK's Labour opposition has=clearly judged that there is mileage in a renewed 
campaign against the bank=rs. However, although Labour supports a tightening of the government8
