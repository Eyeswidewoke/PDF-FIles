Q. And what did you tell her about what she was 
going to be doing? 
A. I said, hey, Ill, do you want to go to this 
guy's house. He will give you $200 if you stand there 
naked. He is going to jack-off and ejaculate in his 
hand, and then we're going to leave. Do you want to do 
it. She said no. She said no a couple of times. More 
than a couple of times. Then I convinced her just like 
convinced me. 
Q. Did you tell her anything else? 
A. From what I recall, I said we're going to go 
make some money. We're going to walk up some pink 
stairs. It's a huge mansion. And there is a chef and 
he can make you food. And sometimes we can get, like, 
free, like, bikinis and stuff that Jeffrey will give us. 
And Jeffrey is an old man. We have nothing to worry 
about. We're going make $200 standing there naked. He 
might use a vibrator, might use his hands. Yeah, that's 
it 
Q. So, a 
knew exactly what was going to happen 
when you took her over to Jeff Epstein's house, correct? 
MR. EDWARDS: Object to the form. 
MR LUTTIER: Correct? 
THE WITNESS: Correct
