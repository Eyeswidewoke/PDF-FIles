6 December 2015 
Update: China Monthly: Rising challenges will trigger more policy easing in 2016 
divergence in monetary policy between China and US 
will likely make financing of external debt increasingly 
more expensive. According to the BIS data, as of June 
2015, China's cross-border borrowings were around 
USD1.2trn in Q2 2015. Although it is likely the 3Q 
number would have declined, the overall size of short-
term debt remains quite sizeable. Second. China is 
likely to continue to face the impossible trinity —
explicit monetary easing through interest rate/RRR cuts 
directly conflicts with its FX policy to keep USD/CNY 
spot stable, while opening up the capital account. In 
our view, the persistent desire to limit CNY weakness 
will continue to increase the risk of misalignment in 
monetary conditions with fundamentals, increasing 
vulnerability to possible policy mistakes and triggering 
further capital outflows. We believe the Chinese 
authorities will have to be more accommodative to a 
weaker RMB so that they can ease monetary policy 
more to help the slowing economy.
