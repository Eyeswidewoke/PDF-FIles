the sealing off of VIP rooms with yellow tape as crime scenes. For the security staff, it can also 
mean many hours of work preparing incident reports and being questioned by police, prosecutors, 
defense lawyers, and management. Given such consequences, it is not clear why two hotel 
employees would engage in the sort of victory dance that would be appropriate after a winning 
touchdown in a football game. Yet, the security guard, and the head engineer at the Sofitel did 
such a dance following the call to the police. They did not do this dance in the view of others, 
Instead, they went into a the loading dock area, where no one in the security area could see them. 
Neither man has offered an explanation for their dance. According to an Accor Group 
spokesman, they both said their minds were blank on the subject and they could not recall the 
dance. So we do not know what made both men suddenly to go to a private area and dance at 1:34 
PM. We do know that both these men had been working together throughout that day, as can be 
seen on the CCTV tapes, and they had many earlier opportunities to high five each other, but 
didn't. Their were no sports events that ended at 1:34 PM. What did happen at that time was that 
the 911 dispatcher said she was sending a squad car to the hotel. 
Chapter IX 
The C Word 
The "C" word in American journalism is Conspiracy. It derives from the Latin "to breathe 
together," and it occurs in law when two or more persons secretly act together to achieve a 
deceitful or illegal purpose. A conspiratorial explanation is particularly unpopular with 
journalists if it implies that there is more behind it than has been reported, and many such 
explanations prove to be unfounded. But conspiracies not only exist but are a staple in the 
prosecution of federal crimes in the United States. For example, the Center On Law And Security 
at Fordham University, which tracks all federal terrorism cases, found that between 2001 and 
2011, 92 percent of all federal indictment for them contained a conspiracy charge. From the 
perspective of U.S. prosecutors at least, conspiracies are the norm not the exception. 
Conspiracies, to be sure, come in very different forms. Some are before-the-fact conspiracies 
that create the event itself from whole cloth. For example, many of the allied deception operations 
surrounding the allied invasion of Europe in 1944 fabricated a mosaic of false data that when 
pieced to together would deceive the Germans as to the time and place of the attack. Others are 
after-the-fact conspiracies that manipulate and fake information after an event has occurred to 
alter the consequences. For example, the Watergate cover-up was designed to conceal the 
connections between the group of men who did the break-in of the offices of the Democratic 
National Committee to the Nixon White House. 
The encounter between DSK and the maid in the presidential suite did not occur in a vacuum. 
DSK had been a target of French intelligence, and his private activities in Washington DC the day 
before appear to have been closely monitored possibly as part of the investigation of the so-called 
Carlton affair. What had happened began as a strictly local affair in Lille. The manager of a legal 
brothel in Belgium named Dominique "Dodo" Alderwereld told French police that he had been 
providing prostitutes to an executive of the luxury Carlton Hotel in Lille, and he had done it under 
the protection of a French police official. The so-called "Carlton Affair" might have never 
morphed into a French intelligence operation if the police official, Lagarde, had not been involved 
in other libertine parties attended by a man planning to run for the French presidency. While in 
France it is not unlawful to have sex with prostitute, it is unlawful to pay for them with corporate
