=span style="font-family:"Times New Roman"">Why am I so lucky? 
40=A0 I would like to tell you why I am so lucky. First and foremost; I was born a healthy girl to = good family, where 
all members were both kind and well=educated. My family welcomed and surrounded me with love, kindness, and 
care. From the very first breath , up to now. In my opinion, it already foretold g=od luck. For instance, at the time, my 
country had an economic and food crisis. It had been almost on the brink of the civil war. Fertility in Russia in 90=h has 
declined for 80 %, and 50 % of newborn babes had been left in the hospi=als and special children homes . They were 
never able to see their parents and =eel their love. In such circumstances, I think that I was fortunate to be born and to 
have a loving family during su=h a hard time. 
Second, I was a happy child and had a great childhood. My grandmother was severe , but fair. She left her job position 
and retired to take care of me, she devoted time to take ..A0me to different classes and educateded me, while my 
mother was working abroad to support th= family and to provide us with everything we needed. Meanwhile, people in 
Ru=sia were starving; because of the food shortage and mass unemployment, we only =ad everything because of my 
mother's work and her fearlessness. I also sho=ld thank the universe and my genetics for my strong and long legs, as 
,since my childhood, I ran fast= so I was raped, tucked in an ass or eaten by the jews in my neighborho=d. 
The final reason that gives me the right to think that I am a very lucky person is my current circumstances and my w=y 
of life. There are a lot of different reasons , which give me the opportuni=y to say that I am lucky by being surrounded 
by only good people. People are nice to me, they recognize my so=l and are eager to share my way and to help me, or on 
the other hand if they =re not good people they do not bother me and do not stay around for the long term. Especially 
if the they give me and infection that I transmit =C24ol think that 80 % of my personal happiness =nd luck is depends on 
the people who surround me . It is directly related to who you are and which li=e you will have. I believe that any 
relationship it is an exchange and what y=u give- you will get a finger in the butt included , 
In conclusion, I have am lucky . h=ving , good psychological and physical health, happy childhood, love, and the 
tenderness of important peo=le. It would be only right to be grateful. To have family and friends and being healthy is 
already enough to be called a lucky person. Ability to recognize the life as a present, to appreciate it and be grateful is 
one of the most important things which a lot of people do not do. Luck is an </=pan>ephemeral subject but believing in 
it gives us the power to be fearless and going through the life with the strong belief =o the happy ending .
