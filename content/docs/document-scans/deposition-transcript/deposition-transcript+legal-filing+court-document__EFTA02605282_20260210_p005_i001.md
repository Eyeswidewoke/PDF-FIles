As a pro=edural matter, an FET audit includes an examination of the taxpayer by an =uditor and the issuance of 
an Examination Report in which the auditor proposes adjustments to the taxpayer's FET liabil=ty. If the taxpayer signs 
the audit report indicating agreement with the proposed adjustments, the FET is then assessed. If the taxpayer does not 
agr=e, but instead appeals the proposed adjustment to the IRS Appeals Office, then the taxpayer and the Appeals Of=ice 
may reach an agreement resulting in an assessment of taxes. If they ca=not agree at Appeals, then the IRS would 
presumably assess the taxes and r=quire payment, and the taxpayer could seek a refund in federal court. 
Effec= of the Suspension of Assessments on Existing Audits 
Notwiths=anding the suspension of assessments, FET examinations currently in progre=s may continue, and the 
IRS Agents may provide preliminary Examination Reports proposing FET taxes to be assessed. Howeve=, it is not 
expected that final Examination Reports (a/k/a 30-Day Letters)=would be issued, because that would result in the cases 
going to Appeals.<=> 
Effec= of the Suspension of Assessments on New Audits 
A suspen=ion of assessments does not preclude the initiation of new audits. We have=been informally advised 
that the IRS does not intend to initiate new management company audits on this issue. However, the susp=nsion would 
not preclude the initiation of FET audits for other issues (e.=., audits of FET collected on third-party charters and fuel tax 
audits). A=cordingly, there is no guarantee that an auditor opening an examination of FET on charter flights will refr=in 
from examining the owner flights as well. However, pursuant to the susp=nsion on assessments, the results of any such 
examination of owner flights=should not be included in a final Examination Report, as long as the taxpayer agrees to 
extend the statute o= limitations. 
Statu=e of Limitations 
We furth=r understand that the IRS does not intend to let the statute of limitation= expire on current audits. 
Accordingly, management companies under audit should anticipate that the IRS will request that the= sign a written 
consent to keep the statute of limitations open for a year=or more to allow time for the IRS to issue guidance (such as 
regulations) =n the issue. Management companies confronted by such a request should consider whether they would 
prefer to =a) not sign the consent to extend the statute of limitations and effective=y force the issue to be considered at 
Appeals based on existing guidance, =r (b) sign the statute extension in the hope that future guidance on the issue will 
be favorable.=/u> 
Inter=st on Tax Liability 
In decid=ng whether to agree to a statute extension that would allow a case to be s=spended, a management 
company should consider the effect of interest that continues to accrue on any FET that is ultimately =ue. We are not 
aware of any special rule that would abate interest during =he suspension period. 
Cases=in Appeals 
Cases cu=rently in IRS Appeals are not directly affected by the suspension, since t=e IRS Appeals Office is not 
under the jurisdiction of the SBSE division. It is possible that cases currently in Appeals may b= settled in Appeals. 
However, if the taxpayer and the Appeals Officer are =ware of the suspension, they may choose to suspend the Appeal 
pending the =ssuance of future guidance. We understand that SBSE may inform the Appeals Office of the 
suspension.</=>
