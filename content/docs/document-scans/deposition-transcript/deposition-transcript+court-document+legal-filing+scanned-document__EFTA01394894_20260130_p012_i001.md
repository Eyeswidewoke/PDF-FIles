the Manager may decline to accept a subscription by any Person, in whole or in part, and for any 
reason or no reason, in its sole discretion. Immediately following the admission of one or more 
Members on the Closing Date, the Initial Member, by its execution and delivery of a counterpart 
of this Agreement, shall resign from the Fund and shall have no further rights or claims against, 
or obligations as the Initial Member of, the Fund. 
3.2.2 
Each Member shall commit to contribute to the capital of the Fund an amount 
equal to its Capital Commitment. The minimum Capital Commitment for any Member shall be 
$1,000,000, subject to waiver, reduction or increase by the Manager in its sole discretion and any 
adjustment in accordance with Section 3.2.4 and/or Section 3.2.5. Subject to certain specific 
limitations contained in other provisions of this Agreement, such obligation to contribute capital 
to the Fund shall be irrevocable, unconditional and not subject to any defense, counterclaim or 
offset of any kind. 
3.2.3 
The Manager and/or its principals shall make aggregate Capital Commitments to 
the Fund of at least $2,000,000. In addition, ESM Fund I LP (the "ESM Fund"), a private 
investment fund managed by the Manager, shall make a Capital Commitment of $3,000,000 to 
the Fund. 
3.2.4 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Manager will 
allocate the Bonds to be acquired by the Fund first to the Affiliated Members and call capital 
from the Affiliated Members on a pro rata basis based on their respective Capital Commitments 
(as set forth in Section 3.2.3) to fund the acquisition cost until each Affiliated Member's 
unfunded Capital Commitment is reduced to zero, unless otherwise determined by the Manager, 
and then allocate the remaining portion of the Bonds to be acquired by the Fund to the other 
Members (the "Unaffiliated Members") and call capital from the Unaffiliated Members on a pro 
ram basis based on their respective Capital Commitments in accordance with the provisions of 
Section 3.3 to fund the remaining portion of the acquisition cost. In the event that any 
Unaffiliated Member's level of participation in the acquired Bonds is less than the level of 
participation that such Unaffiliated Member would have had in the acquired Bonds had the 
Manager allocated the investment opportunity to (and called capital from) all Members pro rata 
based on their respective Capital Commitments without giving any priority to the Affiliated 
Members, then such Unaffiliated Member's Capital Commitment and unfunded Capital 
Commitment shall be deemed to have been reduced by the same proportion as the reduction of its 
level of participation in the acquired Bonds resulting from the priority allocation of acquired 
Bonds to the Affiliated Members. 
3.2.5 
Unless otherwise agreed with a particular Member, after thirty (30) calendar days 
following the completion of the Tender Offer, each Member shall be released from further 
obligations with respect to its unfunded Capital Commitment except to the extent as reasonably 
determined by the Manager to be necessary to: (i) pay amounts owing or which may become due 
under any indebtedness or to satisfy obligations under existing guarantees, indemnities, covenants 
or other undertakings; (ii) pay Fund expenses when due; and (iii) establish Reserves for the 
purpose of funding the matters described in clauses (i) and (ii). Notwithstanding anything to the 
contrary in the foregoing, if, within the thirty (30) calendar period following the completion of 
the Tender Offer, there remain unfunded Capital Commitments available for drawdown, and any 
holders of the Bonds who did not accept the Tender Offer contact the Manager, then the Manager 
may in its sole discretion acquire additional Bonds from these holders in one or more privately 
negotiated transactions on behalf of the Fund and call capital from the Members to fund such 
transaction(s), in which event the Members will not be released from their unfunded Capital 
Commitments until such transactions have been completed.
