Detail of Changes to Your Cardmember Agreement 
This notice amends your American Express Cardmember Agreement ("Cardmember Agreement') as described 
below. Any terms in the Cardmember Agreement conflicting with this change are completely replaced. Terms not 
changed by this notice continue to apply. If you have any questions, please call the number on the back of your 
Card. 
Effective June 1, 2018, your Cardmember Agreement will be amended as follows: 
Your Pay Over Time Limit amount is added above the Rates and Fees Table on Page 1 of Part 1 of the 
Cardmember Agreement. 
The Rates and Fees Table on Page 1 of Part 1 of the Cardmember Agreement is amended by deleting the 
Paying Interest row and replacing it with the following: 
Paying Interest 
Your due date is at least 25 days after the close of each billing period. For transactions 
added to a Pay Over Time balance at your request, we will begin charging interest as 
of the date they are added to your Pay Over Time balance. For transactions added 
automatically to a Pay Over Time balance, we will charge interest beginning on the 
date of each transaction. We will not charge interest on charges added to your Pay 
Over Time balances automatically if you pay the Account Total New Balance by the 
due date each month. 
How Rates and Fees Work on Page 2 of Part 1 of the Cardmember Agreement is amended by deleting the Late 
Payment row and replacing it with the following: 
Late Payment 
Up to $38. If we do not receive the Amount Due (Minimum Payment Due if you have a 
Pay Over Time balance) by its Payment Due Date, the fee is $27. If this happens again 
within the next 6 billing periods, the fee is $38. However, the late fee will not exceed 
the Amount Due or the Minimum Payment Due, as applicable. Paying late may also 
result in a penalty APR. See Penalty APR for new transactions above. 
How Rates and Fees Work on Page 2 of Pad 1 of the Cardmember Agreement is further amended by adding the 
following new row called About Pay Over Time; however, effective July 1, 2018, the third paragraph in the new 
row regarding Pay Over Time Travel will be deleted from your Cardmember Agreement if you have not enrolled 
in Pay Over Time Trave by such date: 
About Pay Over Time 
See More About Pay 
Over Time in Part 2 
of this Agreement for 
important additional 
information about the 
Pay Over Time feature. 
We may add a feature to your Account that allows you to pay certain charges over time, with 
interest (Pay Over Time). If the Pay Over Time feature on your Account is set to Select, you may 
request to place eligible purchases from the current or preceding billing period in your Pay Over 
Time Select balance. If we approve your request, we will place the charge in your Pay Over Time 
Select balance. If we decline your request, you must pay the charge in full by the Payment Due 
Date. A charge is eligible for Pay Over Time if it equals or is more than a certain dollar amount. 
We will tell you this amount when you enroll, and it is subject to change. We will tell you if we 
change it. 
If we allow you to enroll in the Pay Over Time Direct feature, we will automatically place eligible 
purchases in your Pay Over Time Direct balance. You may alternate between the Select and 
Direct settings. You can do so by visiting us online at amerieanexpresteorn/payovertime or by 
calling the number on the back of your Card. 
If your Account is enrolled in Pay Over Time Travel, we will automatically place eligible travel-
related charges in your Pay Over Time Travel balance regardless of whether your Pay Over 
Time feature is set to Select or Direct. Some examples are airfare and cruise ship tickets, hotels, 
car rentals and charges made outside the U.S. If you request to cancel your Pay Over Time 
Travel feature at any time, you will not be able to re-enroll.
