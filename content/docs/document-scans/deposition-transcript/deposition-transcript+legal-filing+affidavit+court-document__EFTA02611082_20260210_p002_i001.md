I hope you are well! I was wondering if =ou could pass the following along to Jeffrey 
whenever either you or he =as a free moment. BTW, my mobile number has changed a. 
=ither way thank 
you very much. 
Jeff=- Wanted to reconnect. Since we last communicated I took on another =artner who 
provided myself and my other partner Josh the capital needed =o roll out what we had previously discussed in the 
amount of $7.5MM in =rading and operational capital to build out the systems. To be frank =he systems have taken long 
and have been more complex then I expected =given that I have little patience for anything more then 0% friction; ='m 
fine with taking market risk but I hate operational risk). That =eing said, we have been slowly rolling out it out. Currently 
we have =ur offices in Dorado Puerto Rico, where we obtained the favorable Act =0/22 tax decrees, hence the PR 
domicile. At the moment the trading =apital is at Interactive Brokers. I'm aware not a marquee name, but was =elected 
just for speed. We are currently finalizing all the operational =ystems which will be done by year end, wherein I'll feel 
comfortable in =aving responsibility for any outside capital outside of my own. I've =ttached the current returns (they 
are not audited but verifiable as =eeded). Also, as part of scaling out the systems we are only running =he current 
portfolio on between 5-7 individual assets, so please take =ny performance with that in mind. Current portfolio is made 
up of ES, =Q, NG, EUR, CL, and GC futures. The idea is making, for now, the =ortfolio construction unintelligent by design. 
More dispersion will =ead to even lower vol then currently. Currently since start (albeit a =mall sample size) we are up 
16.54%. Here are the following =tatistics: 
(A) =onthly Calendar » (9/18) +9.43%, (10/18 =TD) +8.14% 
(B) Frequency of Positive Days =gt;> 66.67%, Pos/Neg Ratio 1.04X 
(C) Frequency =f Positive Rolling 5-Days » 78.13%, Pos/Neg Ratio =.10X 
(D) Percentage of Days @ Peak NAV =gt;> 56.76% 
Our total max risk (risk defined as net of hedges where hedge =eferences ONLY 
corresponding underlier for purposes of netting) has =een run at 5%. The asymmetry in the upside to downside vol ratio 
is =nherent to the risk and not random. Additionally return attribution has =een disperse. There isn't some one-off 
winner that distorts the current =eturn stream. In any event I wanted to get back on the radar and would =appy to go
