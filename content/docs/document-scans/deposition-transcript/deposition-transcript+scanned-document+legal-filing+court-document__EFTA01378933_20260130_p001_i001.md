The fee retained by 0851 and Pershing is subject to change but shall not exceed 125 basis points (1.25%) and DBSI or Pershing 
may waive all or a portion of the fees payable to OBSI or Pershing. The fees that DBSI receives in connection with the IDP will 
usually be higher than the distribution fees, service fees and other compensation that DBSI may receive in connection with 
sweeps to Money Market Sweep Funds that serve as alternative Cash Sweep Options. Other than applicable fees imposed on 
your DBSI brokerage account there is no charge, fee or commission imposed on such account with respect to the IDP. 
DBTCA also serves as a Program Bank in the IDP and may receive additional compensation or otherwise benefit from its use 
of your funds that are deposited with OBTCA through the IDP. In addition, OBTCA serves as an "Excess Bank" in the event 
you have deposits over the $2.5 million maximum; any excess deposits over $2.5 million are automatically swept into an 
Excess Bank and such amounts are not eligible for FDIC insurance, It is your responsibility to monitor funds deposited at an 
Excess Bank. As a Program Bank or Excess Bank, DBTCA benefits from cash balances held with DBTCA. The profitability of 
DBTCA is determined in large part by the difference between the interest DBTCA pays on deposit accounts, and the interest 
or other income DBTCA earns on loans, investments and other assets. To the extent that OBTCA is used as a Program Bank 
and/or an Excess Bank, the IDP is expected to increase the deposits of DBTCA and, accordingly, the overall profits of DBTCA. 
Benefits Relating to the DB AG NY Sweep Program 
DBSI may receive an intercompany credit for funds placed with the Branch through the DB AG NY Sweep Program. Such 
credit if received may be used in determining the profitability of business activities of DBSI. 
DBTCA receives fees and benefits for services provided in connection with the DB AG NY Sweep Program. Specifically, 
DBTCA receives fees from the Branch of up to 4 basis points (0.04%) based on the balances in the Branch Deposit Accounts. 
The Branch also benefits from cash balances held in the DB AG NY Sweep Program. The profitability of the Branch is 
determined in large part by the difference between the interest the Branch pays on deposit accounts, such as the Branch 
Deposit Accounts, and the interest or other income the Branch earns on loans, investments, and other assets. The DB AG NY 
Sweep Program is expected to increase the deposits of the Branch and, accordingly, the overall profits of the Branch. The 
benefits that ()BSI and the Branch receive in connection with the 08 AG NY Sweep Program will usually be greater than the 
benefits DBSI and its affiliates receive in connection with sweeps to Money Market Sweep Funds that serve as alternative 
Cash Sweep Option 
Pershing receives fees from 08SI of up to 10 basis points (0.10%) based on the balances in the Branch Deposit Accounts. 
This fee compensates Pershing for Form 1099-INT reporting, statement issuance and other services provided in connection 
with the DB AG NY Sweep Program. 
Other than applicable fees imposed on your OBSI brokerage account there is no charge, fee or commission Imposed on such 
account with respect to the DB AG NY Sweep Program. 
Benefits Relating to the Money Market Sweep Funds 
DBSI and its affiliates may receive distribution fees (such as Rule 12b-1 fees), investment management fees, service fees and 
other compensation from the Money Market Sweep Funds. In addition, DBSI and its affiliates may receive a portion of the 
fees paid to the investment managers of the Money Market Sweep Funds. These fees, which vary depending on the Money 
Market Sweep Fund (and class thereof) used, are paid directly by the Money Market Sweep Funds but ultimately are borne 
by you as a shareholder in the fund. 
The Insured Deposit Program 
If you select the IDP as your Cash Sweep Option, your available cash balances will be automatically swept from your DBSI 
brokerage account into interest-bearing money market deposit accounts at the Program Banks. Pershing has established a 
separate account for the benefit of IDP participants at each Program Bank for deposits in the IDP (each a "Deposit Account," 
collectively the "Deposit Accounts"). The Deposit Accounts are insured by the FDIC within certain applicable limits. Your 
total funds at each Program Bank currently are eligible for insurance by the FDIC up to the FDIC Insurance Limitation 
(including principal and accrued interest) per depositor in most insurable capacities (e.g„ for each depositor in an individual 
or joint account, as more fully explained in the section entitled "Information about FDIC Insurance" below). 
FDIC Insurance does not cover amounts in excess of the FDIC Insurance Limitation that you have on deposit with any 
particular Program Bank. The FDIC Insurance Limitation at each Program Bank applies to your funds in the Deposit Account 
plus all other deposits held by you in the same capacity at the same Program Bank. Because accrued interest counts against 
the FDIC Insurance Limitation, DBSI has set a limit on the principal amount that may be deposited on your behalf with any 
one Program Bank at 95% of the applicable FDIC Insurance Limitation. The maximum amount of FDIC insurance coverage 
for your deposits in the IDP is $2.5 million for each category of legal ownership, as more fully explained in the section entitled 
"Information about FDIC Insurance" below. Any deposits over the $2.5 million maximum are automatically swept into an 
Excess Bank and are not eligible for FDIC insurance.
