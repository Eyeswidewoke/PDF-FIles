Important Disclosures for Your Records 
Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. "DBSI" is furnishing this document to you to 
alert you to important matters regarding your account. 
Securities Investor Protection Corporation ("SIPC") 
Securities held by our clearing broker, Pershing LLC, for your account are 
protected up to the total net equity held in the account. Of this total, SIPC 
provides $500,000 of coverage, including $100,000 for claims for cash 
awaiting reinvestment. The remaining coverage is provided by Pershing 
through a commercial insurer. SIPC protection applies when the SIPC memi)er 
firm through which you hold your investments fails financially and is 
unable to meet Ks obligations to securities clients, but SIPC protection 
does not protect against losses attributable to the rise and fall in the 
market 
value of investments. A small number of client accounts are not carried on 
Pershing's books due to specific account factors. These accounts are 
covered under DBSI's SII'C membership. DBSI does not provide coverage in 
excess of SIPC coverage. Certain investments, such as commodity 
futures contracts and currency, are ineligible for SIPC protection. For 
additional information on SIPC, see wvwv.SIPC.org or call the SIPC public 
infomiation number, (202) 371-8300. 
Payment for Order Row 
DBAB receives payment when its routes for execution certain orders in 
certain securities. The determination as to where to route orders is based on 
several factors, consistent wKh DBSI's obligation to provide best execution 
for all client orders. Because several factors are considered with respect 
to such determinations, DBSI could potentially secure price improvements on 
such orders by routing them in a different manner and all such orders
