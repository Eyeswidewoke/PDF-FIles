COUNTERINTELLIGENCE 
As Vice President During 9/11, Cheney Is at the Center of an Enduring Debate Over US Spy Powers 
The Associated Press (11/05, Tucker, Klepper) reported that Dick Cheney, as Vice President during 9/11, was a key 
figure in the US government's expansion of surveillance and intelligence collection powers. According to the article, 
Cheney was a prominent supporter of the Patriot Act and a warrantless wiretapping program, which have been 
subject to ongoing debates and legal challenges. The article assessed that the legacy of Cheney's national security 
policies continues to influence US counterterrorism efforts, with ongoing debates over the balance between 
security and civil liberties, and the use of intelligence as a political tool. The article highlighted that to confront 
potential terrorists and spies, law enforcement and intelligence agencies have retained key tools, which became 
broadly known after the attacks and include national security letters that permit the FBI to order companies to turn 
over information about customers. The article added that Congress in 2020 let expire three provisions of the 
Patriot Act that the FBI and Justice Department had said were essential for national security. One permitted 
investigators to surveil subjects without establishing that they were acting on behalf of an international terrorist 
organization. The article further explained that a recent crack has surfaced between Director Patel's FBI and 
intelligence agencies overseen by Tulsi Gabbard. The FBI said in a letter to lawmakers that it "vigorously disagrees" 
with a legislative proposal that it said would remove the bureau as the government's lead counterintelligence 
agency and replace it with a counterintelligence center under Gabbard's office. "The cumulative effect," the FBI 
warned in the letter obtained by The Associated Press, "would be putting decision-making with employees who 
aren't actively involved in CI operations, knowledgeable of the intricacies of CI threats, or positioned to develop 
coherent and tailored mitigation strategies." That would be to the detriment of national security, the FBI said. 
Spokespeople for the agencies later issued a statement saying they are working together with Congress to 
strengthen counterintelligence efforts. 
Fiber Laser Expert Convicted by Federal Jury of Economic Espionage and Theft of Trade Secrets 
BNO News (11/05, Robles) reported that Ji Wang, a 63-year-old Chinese man living in New York, has been convicted 
of economic espionage and theft of trade secrets. According to the article, Wang stole sensitive technology 
developed under a US defense contract from his employer, Corning Incorporated, and attempted to use it for 
personal gain with entities tied to the Chinese government. "Mr. Wang stole sensitive technology that Corning, Inc. 
and DARPA spent millions of dollars developing so he could line his own pockets and help our adversaries 
undermine U.S. national security," said FBI Assistant Director Roman Rozhaysky. WHEC (NBC-10) (11/05, Staff 
Writer) also reported on the story. 
'Sex Spies' Targeting Tech Industry Leaders, Trying to Steal State Secrets 
The National Desk (11/05, Harris) reported that "sex spies" from China and Russia are targeting tech industry 
leaders in the US to steal state secrets and technology. These spies use "honeypot tactics", including online 
approaches and in-person encounters, to compromise their targets and gain access to sensitive information. 
Notable cases include the targeting of James Mulvenon, a chief intelligence officer, and Rep. Eric Swalwell, who was 
targeted by a suspected Chinese intelligence operative named Christine Fang. The article highlighted that Swalwell 
cut off contact with her in 2015 after the FBI alerted him about its concerns, but the incident led to widespread 
controversy, specifically his position on the House Intelligence Committee. "This is how in depth the Chinese are at 
spying on America. Of wanting to know, stealing our secrets and the intel committee is different than any other 
committee. This is where America's secrets are kept. This is where individuals are able to know things other 
members are not," former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) told Fox News in 2020. Fox News (11/05, Sabes) 
also reported on the story.
