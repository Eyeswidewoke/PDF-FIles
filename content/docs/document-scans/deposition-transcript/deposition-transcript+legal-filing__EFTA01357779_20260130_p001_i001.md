efficiency, and (v) decreasing non-productive capital spending (test wells, 
seismic, infrastructure, etc). 
As we consider 2016, our equity counterparts have looked at the issue of US 
growth and asked the question: 'What would we need to see from the 
industry to normalize production growth from 2016 forward at a level more 
consistent with demand expectations? (i.e. reduce US YoY supply growth to 
500-600 Mb/d)." They estimate "that at minimum, the industry would need to 
drop -160+ horizontal rigs from the "Big Three" plays (Bakken, Permian, Eagle 
Ford) - or -25% of the near 700 rigs currently operating in these plays. The 
implications for the overall oil rig count (-1,600) is much more severe, as 
vertical rigs and marginal plays would likely fall off first, implying a total rig cut 
of 500+." If this scenario plays out as expected, it suggests that US YoY 
supply growth would be reduced from 0.90-1.0 million boepd now to about 
500-600K boepd, or a reduction of 300-400K boepd. We believe markets 
would view this move as significant. 
Looking at Figure 8. the good news is that we have seen some solid progress 
towards decreasing horizontal rigs by that -160 figure. 
Since the OPEC 
meeting in late November, horizontal rig count in the Big Three plays has 
decreased by 40 rigs or about 25% of the DB required cut - and the biggest 
step down came in this past week. In that same span, total US rig count has 
decreased by 167 rigs or about 33% of the DB required cut - again, with the 
best step down coming this past week. Not surprisingly, the necessary decline 
in less efficient rigs (both vertical rigs and rigs in marginal plays) is happening 
faster than for the core three plays, where rigs are most efficient.
