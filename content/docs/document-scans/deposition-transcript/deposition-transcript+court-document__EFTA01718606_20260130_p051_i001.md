illegal activities. To suggest that Mr. Epstein could violate these statutes simply by spending his 
legally carnal money on prostitutes is manifestly an erroneous interpretation of the how. 
'lb our relief, tiller briefing Matthew Menchel at a meeting regarding the spurious 
application of these statutes, we were told to ignore the laundry list and that defense counsels' 
locus should he turned to IS U.S.C. §2422(b). Once Mr. Epstein's counsel submitted and 
presented the reasons why a federal case would require stretching the relevant federal statutes 
beyond recognition, and that federal involvement in this matter should be precluded based on 
federalism concerns. the Petite Policy, and general principles or prosecutorial discretion. the 
parties commenced discussions an possible pica agreement. Around this time, we received an 
IIIIIII 
e-mail NM, Ms. 
SuggeStillg that she wanted to discuss the possibility of a concurrent 
federal and state reso talon. We were immediately informed by your Office that Ms. 
did not have the authority to make any such pica proposals and w u d not he invuly 
in any 
further negotiations of n plea. Despite this commitment. Ms. 
was the principle 
negotiator of the Agreement. At our meeting on September 7. sic made reference to an 
allegation against Mr. Epstein involving a 12 year old individual. This allegation is without 
merit and without Ibundation. Though your last letter suggests there was "no contact" between 
individuals in your Office and the press, we we • revi

receiving "information" specifically from

and established law. First, Ms. 
insisted that as part of the federal plea agreement. the 
State Attorney's (Mica without 'mg s town new evidence, should be convinced to charge Mr. 
Epstein with violations of law and recommend a sentence that are significantly harsher than what 
the State deemed appropriate. In fact, the State Attorney viewed this matter as a straightforward 
prostitution case and believed that a term of probation was - and is - the appropriate senumee. At 
Ms. 
's insistence, however, Mr. Epstein was forced to undertake the highly unusual and 
unprece wiled action of directing his debnse team to contract the State prosecutors themselves 
and ask for an upward departure in both his Indictment and sentence. There was no effort by the 
stare and federal prosecutors to coordinate the prosecutions. a practice which is against the tenets 
of the Pesky Policy. In our view, it is unprecedented to micro-manage each and every term of 
Mr. Epstein's State plea. including the exact state charges to which Mr Epstein plead guilty; the 
time-frame within which Mr. Epstein must enter that state plea and surrender to slate officials: 
and the amount of time he must spend in county jail. This is particularly true wh.ere the State
