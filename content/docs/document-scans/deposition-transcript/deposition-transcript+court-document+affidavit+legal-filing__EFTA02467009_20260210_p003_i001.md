an Export C of A that enables the aircraft to be issued a US Certificate of Airworth=ness, BUT all costs and modifications 
of the Aircraft, it's engine=, APU, documents, etc. required for an Export C of A so that the Aircraft =s in compliance with 
US CofA requirements should be paid by Purchaser. 
3. 
We agree the Delivery=Conditions should state that Aircraft should be free of any history 
of material damage and material corrosion. =AO We added the word "material" in front of damage in the =O1 and 
suggest that we keep it simple for now in the La and let the attor=eys better define the words "material damage" and 
=9Cmaterial corrosion" in the Purchase Agreement. 
4. 
The concept of the Se=ler putting money into escrow to cover those Purchaser funds 
Seller uses o=t of escrow for inspection costs defeats the whole concept and appeal of y=ur deal. If Seller has to put 
money in escrow to cover these costs they might as well pay Gulfstream directly for the costs= If the transaction fails 
because of Seller's breach or beca=se correcting the discrepancies exceeds $2MM, the Seller will reimburse th= 
Purchaser the full purchase price amount but it cannot be held in escrow. 
S. 
We understand that th=re needs to be a consequence for a Seller breach or Seller's faili=g 
to deliver other than because the aircraft will cost more than $2MM to f=x; however, similar to 4. above the funds 
cannot come out of escrow as it defeats the whole concept and appeal of your deal. W= also agree in the case of such a 
breach of failure to deliver, Purchaser=E2 s out of pocket costs for the ARCS inspections and "other=E2 costs invested 
in the project by Purchaser should be reimbursed by the Seller, but Seller will need a way to limit and quantify=what 
costs it will be responsible for reimbursing. Rather than get t=o bogged down in the LOI trying to list exactly what costs 
are included an= how they are reimbursed, we suggest we press forward, and if we have a deal, we can provide further 
details in=the Purchase Agreement on what "other costs" paid by Purch=ser shall be reimbursed by Seller. 
OTHER Explanations: 
* 
Paragraph 4: We can get a formal Gulfstream Quot= that will include the Flat Rate Cost for 
the required inspections but it =ill be provided PRIOR to the Inspection and included as an Exhibit in the =urchase 
Agreement; however, there is no way to include a full out-the-door cost for all of the inspect=ons until Gulfstream starts 
the inspections as the total costs will be dep=ndent upon what Gulfstream finds during the Inspection. 
* 
We understand and agree to the concept of a "C=osing Deadline" but feel it would be 
better to tackle that concept=in the Purchase Agreement as it is unclear at this point how we would defi=e when the 30 
days would start (after RTS, after Inspection completion, after export CofA issued, etc.?) or if 3= days is the right 
number.
