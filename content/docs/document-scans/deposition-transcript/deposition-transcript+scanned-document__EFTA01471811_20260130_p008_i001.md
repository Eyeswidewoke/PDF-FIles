that margin may be provided separately in respect of that Transaction in 
which case — 
that Transaction shall not be taken into account when calculating whether 
either party has a Net Exposure; 
margin shall be provided in respect of that Transaction in such manner as 
the parties may agree; and 
margin provided in respect of that Transaction shall not be taken into 
account for the purposes of subparagraphs (a) to (g) above. 
The parties may agree that any Net Exposure which may arise shall be 
eliminated not by Margin Transfers under the preceding provisions of this 
paragraph but by the repricing of Transactions under subparagraph (j) below, 
the adjustment of Transactions under subparagraph (k) below or a combination 
of both these methods. 
Where the parties agree that a Transaction is to be repriced under this 
subparagraph, such repricing shall be effected as follows -
the Repurchase Date under the relevant Transaction (the "Original 
Transaction") shall be deemed to occur on the date on which the repricing is 
to be effected (the "Repricing Date"); 
the parties shall be deemed to have entered into a new Transaction (the 
"Repriced Transaction") on the terms set out in (iii) to (vi) below; 
the Purchased Securities under the Repriced Transaction shall be Securities 
equivalent to the Purchased Securities under the Original Transaction; 
the Purchase Date under the Repriced Transaction shall be the Repricing Date; 
the Purchase Price under the Repriced Transaction shall be such amount as 
shall, when multiplied by the Margin Ratio applicable to the Original 
Transaction, be equal to the Market Value of such Securities on the 
Repricing Date; 
the Repurchase Date, the Pricing Rate, the Margin Ratio and, subject as 
aforesaid, the other terms of the Repriced Transaction shall be identical to 
those of the Original Transaction; 
the obligations of the parties with respect to the delivery of the Purchased 
Securities and the payment of the Purchase Price under the Repriced 
Transaction shall be set off against their obligations with respect to the 
delivery of Equivalent Securities and payment of the Repurchase Price under 
the Original Transaction and accordingly only a net cash sum shall be paid 
by one party to the other. Such net cash sum shall be paid within the period 
specified in subparagraph (g) above. 
The adjustment of a Transaction (the "Original Transaction") under this 
subparagraph shall be effected by the parties agreeing that on the date on 
which the adjustment is to be made (the "Adjustment Date") the Original 
Transaction shall be terminated and they shall enter into a new Transaction 
(the "Replacement Transaction") in accordance with the following provisions -
the Original Transaction shall be terminated on the Adjustment Date on such 
terms as the parties shall agree on or before the Adjustment Date; 
the Purchased Securities under the Replacement Transaction shall be such 
Securities as the parties shall agree on or before the Adjustment Date 
(being Securities the aggregate Market Value of which at the Adjustment Date 
is substantially equal to the Repurchase Price under the Original
