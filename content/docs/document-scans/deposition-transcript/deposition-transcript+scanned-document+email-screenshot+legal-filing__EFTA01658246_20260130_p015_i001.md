Biden, in a statement said, "Months after the U.S. intelligence community sounded the alarm -
to Donald Trump and to our allies - that Russia was placing bounties on the heads of American 
servicemen and women in a war zone, our president continues to turn his back on those who 
put their lives on the line for our country, and on his own duty. This continues an indefensible 
pattern of Donald Trump weakening the United States in the world in a manner that no 
American president ever has before, and it's absolutely despicable." USA Today (7/29, Jackson, 
10.31M) reports Democratic opponent Joe Biden and others "say Trump is too chummy with the 
Russian autocrat, and has refused to confront him on matters ranging from Russian 
interference in the 2016 presidential election to the allegations over bounties." 
Bloomberg (7/29, Egkolfopoulou, 4.73M) reports Biden spokesman Andrew Bates said in a 
statement, "The most critical and sacred obligation of a commander-in-chief is to protect those 
who serve our nation in harm's way. But months after the U.S. intelligence community sounded 
the alarm - to Donald Trump and to our allies - that Russia was placing bounties on the heads 
of American servicemen and women in a war zone, our president continues to turn his back on 
those who put their lives on the line for our country, and on his own duty." Also reporting on the 
story is Reuters (7/29). 
House Panel Votes To Give All Members Access To Classified Intelligence On Foreign 
"Disinformation" Campaign. 
CNN (7/29, Herb, Cohen, Raju, 83.16M) reports Democratic congressional leaders "sent FBI 
Director Wray a letter urging an FBI briefing to all lawmakers about the foreign interference 
efforts." Sources "told CNN the Democrats' classified addendum included concerns about a 
Russian-linked 'disinformation' campaign to target former Vice President Joe Biden in the 2020 
election, including that information from entities with ties to Russia was being provided to 
Senate Homeland Security Chairman Ron Johnson, who is leading an investigation into Biden." 
Democrats have not "publicly explained the material they shared with the FBI." The Intelligence 
Committee "voted behind closed doors to make the classified addendum available to any House 
member who requests it." The vote was "along party lines, with Republicans opposed," 
according to two sources familiar with the matter. Republicans have "dismissed the Democratic 
complaints as a partisan attack, and Johnson has denied receiving disinformation from 
foreigners." 
The Hill (7/29, Miller, 2.98M) reports the evidence, "compiled in a 'classified addendum,' 
was submitted to the FBI earlier this month by Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), Senate Minority 
Leader Charles Schumer (D-NY), House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA), 
and Senate Intelligence Committee Vice Chair Mark Warner (D-VA)." The Democratic leaders 
"pointed to it in requesting an immediate all-members classified briefing from the FBI on 
election threats." Schiff "said in a statement Wednesday that the evidence, which had 
previously been available to view only for members of the House Intelligence Committee, was 
being made public for all House lawmakers in response to multiple requests." 
"Gang Of Eight" At Odds Over Releasing Information On Election Interference. 
Politico (7/29, Desiderio, Bertrand, 4.29M) reports that the "Gang of Eight" congressional 
leaders "responsible for reviewing the nation's most closely held secrets is engaged in an 
unusual and bitter partisan fight over how much information to share with the public about 
election interference." The "public spat" is "highly unusual for the group, whose obligations 
normally rise above the political fray and rarely descend publicly into the partisan squabbles 
that define Capitol Hill." Politico adds, "The in-fighting has intensified so rapidly" that Senate 
Intelligence Chairman Marco Rubio "even suggested this week that his committee's annual 
hearing on global threats might not go on as planned, citing 'heavy politicization."
