There's no easy answer to building a platform for a city. Reading any book about urban planning and probably the 
first thing you see is a city grid of roads. The theory is with roads you have the "arteries" of a city and from there 
you can build the routes for water, sewage, electricity, and you know where to put houses. You can move around 
goods and services with ease, and you can dispose of waste with ease. People can get from homes to markets or 
schools. Of course we know this. So did the Romans. 
Building roads, however, is a major undertaking. It takes skills and resources. The materials of modern roads are 
expensive and the tools to create them require roads to deliver them to the site in the first place! In other words, 
bootstrapping a city with roads is a great idea —on paper. 
There are very few roads in Ethiopian cities outside of Addis Ababa (and at best one road connecting major cities 
and it is usually not continuous). Major cities of 100,000 or more people such as Harar or Dire Dawa have only 
moderate paved roads at best. Mid-sized cities such as Jijiga or Bishoftu have no paved roads. Imagine the city of 
Redmond with no roads (or plumbing or electricity). 
At first glance, the country should just do what Eisenhower did and commission a highway building project. Suffice 
it to say the conditions (political, economic, geographic) in the US were unique and can't be matched in Ethiopia. 
Just the challenge of building a road with modern methods seems impossible to overcome, and certainly not 
possible for anything but a national highway (one is being built in Jijiga right now, but the lack of water in the city is 
limiting the pace of construction, which in turn means it will be even longer before water could be brought to the 
city, if ever). Even if you could build an asphalt road, it turns out it might not be the best investment. Built to 
German standards, such a road might last 20-30 years. If there are economic and trade incentives, China has 
shown an interest in building roads in Africa, but these are built to 5-10 year standards. 
Have you ever been to a really really old western city like Rome, London, Paris, or Berlin (or downtown Seattle)? It 
turns out there is a technological solution to building roads that can work —cobblestone. The roads that the 
Romans built have lasted 1000 years. That's older than Excel 3 running on Windows 8. So there's a technology to 
use. But we've seen that just providing the technology doesn't seem to work. How can we turn the technology into 
a platform? How can this platform drive economic growth for a city in a new way? In other words, is there a 
solution where roads become a platform for the city, not just serve the purposes of transportation directly. 
The typical relief work or charitable view of this problem would be to raise money and just build a road. What you 
are left with is a large group of people without increased skills or the skills to maintain the roads. It means that the 
city is caught in a negative cycle of having to raise money to pay for outside resources to provide technology and 
people to maintain the road. Plus, the amount it costs for a mile of asphalt roads (the technology in use by those 
charitable organizations) is relatively short-lived and extremely expensive per mile (or per mile/per year of useful 
life). 
Enter GIZ, the German development group. GIZ created a plan to build cobblestone roads in Ethiopian cities. The 
impetus was not just the desire to improve transportation in a cost effective manner, but to create an economic 
engine for cities. Cobblestone roads can be created with local labor (there is a large supply) and local materials 
(Ethiopia is rich in raw materials for cobblestone, but has none of the materials for asphalt) and even local tooling. 
GIZ provides a few of the reasons that cobblestone provides the basis for a platform in building roads. Cobblestone 
paving: 
• 
is labor-intensive, creating jobs and opportunities for construction entrepreneurs 
• 
uses natural and local materials and does not require imported machinery
