The Fantasist 
they are, what they have accomplished in their fields?" 
One of the accusers—a girl of I4—had put his age at 45, not in his fifties, and you could see why. His 
walk was youthful, and his face was ruddy with health. He had none of the round-shouldered, burdened 
qualities of middle age. There was nothing in his hands, not a paper, a book, or a phone. Epstein had on 
his signature outfit: new blue jeans and a powder-blue sweater. "I've only ever seen him in jeans," his 
friend the publicist Pew Siegal had reported, saying there was a hint of arrogance in that, Epstein's 
signal that he doesn't have to wear a uniform like the rest of us. 
I told Epstein and Rubenstein the sort of story New York wanted to do, and Epstein seemed to find ironic 
delight in every word. "A secretive genius." I'd said. "Not secretive, private," he corrected in his warm 
Brooklyn accent. "And if I was a genius I wouldn't be sitting here." "A guy with sex issues." A smile 
funned on Epstein's bow-shaped lips. "What do you mean by sex issues?" Well ... He was 54, had 
never married—I didn't finish. "Are you channeling my mother?" 
When I said we were interested in the agony of his ordeal, Rubenstein wrote out the word agony in 
capital letters on his pad. But agony seemed the last thing on Epstein's soul. "It's the leans story, 
someone who flies too close to the sun," I said. "Did Icarus like massages? Epstein asked. 
Two years before, he had tried to explain himself to the Palm Beach police in the same way. After they 
came into his mansion with a search warrant and carted off massage tables and photos of naked girls and 
soaps shaped like genitalia, Epstein conveyed an urgent message to the detectives through his attorney. 
"Mr. Epstein is very passionate about massages ... The massages are therapeutic and spiritually sound 
for him; that is why he has had many massages." Epstein had even given 5100,000 to Ballet Florida's 
massage fund, so that the dancers might also be treated. 
I never got to interview Epstein at length. His dream team of lawyers led by Gerald Lefeourt was 
negotiating a plea with Florida state prosecutors in advance of a January 7 trial date. It is expected that 
Epstein will plead guilty to soliciting prostitution and get an eighteen-month sentence—not that there's 
likely to be a shameful admission. He has always had the confidence that comes with the power to 
dazzle and, though accused of "doing everything in Sodom and Gomorrah," as one friend put it; seemed 
to believe that he could convince any halfway sophisticated person that he wasn't the least hit tawdry.
"He lives in a different environment,- says Siegal. "He's of this world. But he mates this different 
environment. Ile lives like a pasha. the most magnificent townhouse I've ever been in, and I've been in 
everything. I've seen a model of the house in Santa Fe .. a stone fortress. A model of the house in the 
Caribbean—it is not to be believed. I've seen photographs of the apartment in Paris ... HO.NV did he 
himself into that pickle? Thais the mystery- of Jeffrey Epstein. Ile's very mysterious. Not that many 
people get close to bin Not that many people know him." 
The descriptions of Epstein's character veer between visionary and big talker. His world seems to be at 
• -mid distance from nonnai humanity. Ile lives in what is described as the largest private resident in 
about 50.000 square feet in nine stories between Fifth and Madison on 71st Visitors report a
