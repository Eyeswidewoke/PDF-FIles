Agreed Sultan. I think going on the offensive on this and other matters will help. I think Sarah was trying to seek your 
clearance for me to do some press, including CNI3C to get our side of the story. Are you OK with this approach?

Dubai Inc. Needs Change at the Top• By ANDREW CRITCHLOW Faced with a continuing financial crisis of savage 
proportions. Dubai risks retreating into its past rather than facing up to its new reality. The Gulf emirate needs to 
radically overhaul its state-controlled companies if it is to overcome its S80 billion mountain of debt. Yet rather titan 
seize the opportunity to introduce international standards of governance and transparency, the people whose poor 
judgment led Dubai to the brink have kept their jobs. For western lenders with billions of dollars still at stake, that is 
troubling.Take Dubai World. the conglomerate that has just been radically restructured after running up almost $60 
billion of liabilities on an ill-judged acquisition spree. Its deals included buying struggling Madison Avenue retailer 
Bameys for $800 million, investing in an $8.8 billion Las Vegas casino development and paying 5100 million for the 
Queen Elizabeth II liner, which has since spent most of its time languishing in a Dubai dry dock.Dubai World has 
now cut its work force by 15% in an effort to save $800 million over the next three years. Surprisingly, its senior 
managers remain in place, including Sultan bin Sulayem, the chairman who masterminded the expansion. That has 
disappointed bankers who fear that, unless senior managers arc held more accountable, the mistakes of the past will be 
repeated.But holding senior Emirati officials like Mr. Sulayem responsible for their decisions will be tricky. The 
Sulayetn family's ties to Dubai's ruling Maktoums run deep. Mr. Sulayem's father was a key adviser to the family. The 
same is true of many other of the emirate's business leaders whose reputations have been damaged by the 
crisis. Western lenders would rather see experienced and suitably qualified executives running Dubai's companies with 
proper accountability to an independent board and cralitors. Yet Dubai's ruler. Sheik Mohammed bin Rashid Al
