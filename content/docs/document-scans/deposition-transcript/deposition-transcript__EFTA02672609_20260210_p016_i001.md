Pharma and biotech: This one's harder to game out. The Food and Drug Administration didni=3 have to shut 
down in 1995 and 1996 because it was already funded. This time around, however, the FDA won't be spared, and the 
review process for ne= drugs is likely to get bogged down. The shutdown could also put a cramp on the gr=nt process 
from the National Institutes of Health. "If prolonged," Krueger writes, "that could negatively impact life 
sciences/diagnostic= companies. 
Would a government shutdown stop Oba=acare from happening? 
NO. As Sarah Kliff has explained, the key parts of O=amacare rely on mandatory spending that isn't affected by a 
shutdown. &qu=t;That includes the new online marketplaces, known as exchanges, where uninsured p=ople will be able 
to shop for coverage. The Medicaid expansion is funded with mandatory funding, as are the billions in federal tax 
credits to help with purchasing coverage." 
That means uninsured =mericans will be able to start shopping for plans when the exchanges launch Oct. 1, 
although there are lik=ly to be some glitches. 
How do you end a government =hutdown? 
Congress needs to pass a bill (or bill=) to fund the government, and the White House has to sign them. They can 
do this at any t=me. Or they can sit at home and keep the government closed. Nothing requires th=m to do anything. It 
depends what sort of political pressure they're faci=g. 
How often has the government shut down before= 
Technically, 17 times. But a serious, prolonged shutdown? That's only happened once before. 
Since 1976, =here have been 17 times when Congress has allowed government funding to lapse. Back in the 
1970s, this happened on=six occasions, although those lapses didn't lead to actual, physical shutdo=ns — government 
carried on as usual. 
Then, in the early 1=80s, then-Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti argued that the Anti-Deficiency Act actually 
required government agencies to close down if their funding expired. Since then, a failure t= fund the government has 
meant an actual, tangible shutdown. Most of the shutd=wns in the 1980s were brief affairs. 
By far the most signif=cant shutdown to date came in 1995-'96 and lasted 21 days, as Bill Clinton wrangled with 
congressiona= Republicans over budget matters. 
Is a government =hutdown the same thing as breaching the debt ceiling? 
Nope! Different type of =risis. In a government shutdown, the federal government is not allowed to make any 
new spending commitments (save for all the exceptions noted above). 
By con=rast, if we hit the debt-ceiling then the Treasury Department won't be able to borrow money to pay for 
spending that Congr=ss has already approved. In that case, either Congress will have to lift th= debt ceiling or the 
federal government will have to default on some of its bills= possibly including payments to bondholders or Social 
Security payouts. T=at could trigger big disruptions in the financial markets — or a long-term r=se in borrowing costs. 
The Bipartisan Policy Center estimates that we L=;re on pace to breach the debt ceiling sometime between Oct. 18 and 
Nov. 5. So if a gov=rnment shutdown isn't thrilling enough for you, good news: There's another=fiscal crisis just around 
the corner. And Congress should be ashamed...=. 
As Gary Hart pointed out this week in The Huffington Post</=>, occasionally, a single incident can characterize 
an entire era. Rosa Parks sits down near=the front of a bus. Gary Cooper drops his badge in the dust. Warren Beatty is
