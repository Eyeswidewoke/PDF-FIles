Standing Instructions to your Investment Specialist as part of the account opening process or subsequent to opening your account. A standing instruction is an instruction an account 
holder gives to their Investment Specialist to permit the withdrawal or transmittal of funds or other assets from the account holder's account at regular intervals, or as needed. The 
items included below are both Instructions that appear to be third party asset movements, as well as first and third party journal Instructions for accounts that are custodied with 
Pershing. 
We may remove any standing instructions that have not been used in the past 36 months (except for Automated Clearing House (ACH) which does not expire). You have the ability to 
re-establish those instructions through your Investment Specialist.
