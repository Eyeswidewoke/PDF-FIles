state. As such I =elieve that tjat Senator McCain and the other Sunday experts are wrong when they insist that American 
should act alone, when the=e is nothing that the US can do other than putting a band-aid on a festering situation, 
especially with little or no public support at home, and regiona= non-existent partners, will put the blame on the last 
man standing. =Because of this, all of the President's options are bad. Bombing a foreign country is -- an act of war, 
however you spin it. And as Collin Powell once caution, President George W. Bush "if it=breaks you will own it", the 
same is true in Syria. It is estimated that 70,000 people have already died in Syria as a result of this current civil war, and 
to use the death of 20 to 30 more as a pretense to g= to war seems a bit hypocritical to me. Although Sarin is 
categorized as a WMD, less people died worldwide during the same period in the US due to firearms. Still, we couldn't 
even get background checks approved in Congr=ss last week. I watched the Sunday Morning News Programs, with their 
guests advocati=g that we do something immediately, even when they all agree that there are no good options. Maybe 
when there are no good options, we should wait. And if this is truly a problem, let's wait for the Arab League, EU or the 
UN to take=the lead, because as General Powell explained, "if we break it we will end u= owning it." And the Syrian 
war, will be our war....=game-changer or not. So again, if you don't know, sip slow.

Please watch the above video clip, to truly see the absurdity of the ill-=hought advice that the Sunday News Programs 
experts presents week in and w=ek out. 
The issue is that I really can't whitewash are the failures of his administration, no matter how many supporters try to 
rewrite history=so that his legacy can be redeemed, similar to what has happen with Harry Trum=n. Like LBJ's legacy will 
always be linked to Viet Nam, Nixon's to Watergate and Carter's to American hostage= in Iran, George W. Bush will and 
should always be painted with his biggest blunder -= the senseless failed Iran war. When asked what was the biggest 
problem was when he first arrived in the White House at the tender =ge of 31, George Stephanopoulos replied, 
"everything is mag=ified." He described having a great day in the White House Press Briefing Room, and his Mother 
calling to=say that she saw him pick his nose while on camera and as a result, she wi=I never be able to face her friends 
at the hairdressers — t=us both mistakes and/or successes are magnified beyond sensible proportion. &n=sp;But this is 
not true for the 2nd Iran War. 
My father use to say, "that history is always rewritten b= the winners." And like everyone else, President's should be 
allowed to make mistakes, and not be tainted fo=ever as a result of one, two or several miscalculations or indiscretions. 
Ronal= Reagan got beyond Iran-Contra and the Marine Barracks massacre to become the most popular Republican since 
Abe Lincoln (who actually wasn't popular when in office) and somehow Bill Clinton got b=yond Monica Lewinsky and 
Somalia, to now become the most popular former President in the world. But in t=is moment of Kumbayah we should 
rightfully be put aside Presid=ntial mistakes. But if =e do not want to repeat the past mistakes, we should not allow 
history to be white-washed. As a result we should al=ays recognize that slavery, the Holocaust and child labor and child 
soldiers/armies in the past and present are bligh=s on humanity, should be acknowledged and not white-washed, so 
that they never happen again. A= a result, the same should be said for the Bush/Cheney Presidency, even though like 
President Obama said, I personally believe that George W. Bush is a good man. And obviously his mother agrees with 
me, based on what she said on the Today Show last week,"I think it's a great count=y. There are a lot of great families, 
and it's not just four families or whatever. There are othe= people out there that are very qualified and we've had 
enough B=shes." 
"No taxation without representation"</=> is a slogan originating during the 1750s and 1760s that summarized a primary 
grievance =f the British colonists in the Thirteen Colonies, which was one of the major causes of the American 
Revolution. In short, many in those colonies believed that, as they were not directly represented in the distant British 
Parliament, any laws it passed taxing th= colonists (such as the Sugar Act and the Stamp Act) were illegal und=r the Bill 
of Rights 1689, and were a denial of their rights as Englishmen. =nbsp;The phrase captures a sentiment central to the
