Hey !!=How r u ?! 
I have some big news I need to share with you..might even n=ed an advice from you..:please. 
So I met this guy, Alfonso=10 months ago..through my boxing trainer. We started hanging out and were =ust 
friends, but txting every day and spending a lot of time together= He is only 24, but pretty mature. From a really good 
family in Ecuador. H= is super fun. Makes me laugh all the time. Anyway, was never attracted to=him. Until recently. 
Started thinking about having sex w him but didn'= wanna ruin our friendship. But of course we ended up in bed. A week 
ago. =irst it was just a fun night out and sex. Which was okay. But 2nd...omg we=fucked for 1h20. It was mind 
blowing..and as we were spending even more ti=e together it got kinda out of hand..: 
Sexually and emotionally.=We checked in to a hotel for 3 nights. First time actually used a whip. Fo= some 
reason I really wanted him to be rough at times. And enjoyed the pair. I suprised myself. Never really wanted to do that 
w Ben. Also I finally =ried that ice cube thing with blow job. Wow ..he loved it. Also im bruised=up all over my body. 
Feels great :►) And physically can't even full anymore. My pussy is just too sorr and swollen. 
But we totally=fell in love. And first I was like there is no way I would ever leave Ben.=Especially now , 9 months 
before wedding. Even tho haven't started pla=ning anything yet. Beside date and location. 
But thinking =y life over and my desires and things I want and enjoy..I think Im going t= leave Ben. He is this 
incredible person. But as I said many times, Im jus= bored w him. No excitement. No suprises. He doesn't get my 
jokes..and=doesn't know how to dance. I always wanted a guy who knows how to grab=a woman and Alfonso took me 
to this salsa spot. Omg it was like from a mov=e. So fucking hot. 
And if I break up w Ben, yeah, the plan=is to be w Alfonso but regardless of that. I think I should just get out o= 
this engagement while it's time. 
Am I being completel= crazy? 
=AO
