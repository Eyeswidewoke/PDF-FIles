I remembered about your conversation with the russian woman at the elevator= 
so I've had one in English a few days ago, but it was little bit long=r than yours:) I had to attend one of my studies I've 
missed during th= 1st week of September, so there were 2 guys there, one from Lebanon and t=e other one from Syria, 
and they were talking Arabic language all th= time. Then one of them asked me that I must have been tired to listen to 
=hem, I said that it's ok, then he asked me if I speak English. They sp=ak Russian good enough, but English was easier for 
them, so we began to ta=k) it was a very nice conversation, it was so long I talked to someone in =nglish...now only e-
mails for you) 
Of caurse, I'll have to find a job, if I come to the US. It's not a= easy decision, 
cause there is nothing I have there now, but the economic =nd political situation in our country is not very good, to be 
honest...it&=39;s hard to explain, but here life is completely different. So, if I come= it would be this summer I think, 
because after my graduation it'd be =uch harder to do it. 
Oh, it's 3 am already! I have to go sleeping. 
Good night Jeremy! Bye=..

Yes, the woman wa= very surprised and looked a little bit 
embarrassed...probably because of =y terrible accent!! 
Wow, that's cold over there. It is getting much cooler here but not=nearly that 
cold! 
Yeah, I figured most of the churches out there we=e similar to my parents. It is a 
very traditional church. No, I don't =hink it is wrong at all to go to a catholic church instead of an orthodox =hurch. Is 
God in one more than the other? I don't think so. 
I'm sure you know that I'm very active in my church. I'm us=ally there twice a 
week either singing or going to a church service. We hare some dance groups here too with ballet and a few 
choreographed dances. 1= is a lot of fun. I hope you get a chance to come some day, the people are=always very nice. 
I'm so sorry to hear about the dental assistant job. School can be =ough and 
take up a lot of time. I know how that is, I just don't let i= take up any of my time, which is why I'm not getting my work 
done!! := 
So you are coming to the US to find a job then? Is this next year or on=e you 
graduate? 
My friends birthday party was great. He was very h=ppy and surprised by it all. I 
really don't think it is a good thing t=at I am so tired from all of this going out and spending time (and money) =ith my 
friends. I'm so tired and have no more money!! :-/ 
I need some rest and calmness...very, very badly. 
Ahh, Karina. l=hope you know that I really enjoy writing to you and I really enjoy 
readin= your messages. I miss spending time with you too!
