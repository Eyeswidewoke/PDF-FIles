CORPORATE AUTHORIZATION AND INDEMNITY AGREEMENT 
1. Authorization, The undersigned hereby requests and authorizes The Chase Manhattan Bank 
(the "Bank:-) to accept and act upon any instructions ("Instructions") delivered by telephone or telex 
or written or facsimile transmission given or purportedly given by a person or persons authorized to 
transact business with the Bank as shown on the corporate resolution or other evidence or advice of 
authority from time to time maintained in the records of the bank. 
2. No Liabillty_d_Dark The undersigned accepts the risk that instructions may be given by an 
unauthorized person and agrees that the Bank will have no liability or responsibility for acting in 
accordance with any Instructions, whether or not genuine or duly authorized. The Bank shall have no 
liability or responsibility for any misunderstandings arising out of any telephone Instructions. 
3. Security Procedures. The security procedure agreed upon for verifying the authenticity of 
Instructions is a callback to any of the following individuals, whether or not such individual has 
initiated any such transfer. (The Bank recommends that the persons designated below not be 
persons who generally issue Instructions; whenever possible, the Bank will endeavor to call someone 
other than the issuer of the Instructions.) 
Name and Title 
Cecile R. de Jong!' 
Jeanne Brennan 
Eric Gany 
Alternatively, at the Bank's option, the callback may be 
the 
signature cards or any other account documentation on file with the Bank for the undersigned's 
accounts as authorized to issue Instructions or otherwise transact business on such account. 
In addition to callback, the parties agree that for Instructions received by facsimile transmission, or in 
writing, the Bank will determine whether the Instruction purports to bear the signature of any 
individual who is designated on the current signature cards or other account documentation on file 
with the Bank for the undersigned's account(s) as authorized to Issue Instructions or otherwise 
transact business on such accounts. 
The security procedures and other terms specified in this Agreement also apply to amendments and 
cancellations of Instructions. It is understood that these security procedures are designed to verify 
the authenticity, and not the correctness, of Instructions. 
The Bank may, at its option, record (electronically or otherwise) any call back made pursuant to this 
Agreement, any Instructions or other Instructions given by telephone and any other telephone 
discussions relating to Instructions. 
The undersigned agrees that its rights and duties and those of the Bank hereunder shall be 
governed by the terms of the Chase Account Conditions (as may be amended from time to time) 
applicable to the undersigned's accounts at the Bank. The undersigned agrees that the security 
procedures set forth herein constitute a commercially reasonable method of providing security 
against unauthorized Instructions. The undersigned agrees to be bound by any Instruction, whether 
or not authorized, issued in the undersigned's name and accepted by the Bank in compliance with 
the security procedure set forth herein and the undersigned agrees to indemnify and hold the Bank 
harmless from any loss suffered or liability incurred by the Bank in, or arising from the Bank's 
execution of Instructions believed by the Bank in good faith to have been given (or signed in the case 
of a facsimile transmission) by a person authorized as provided above, provided the Bank has 
complied with such security procedure.
