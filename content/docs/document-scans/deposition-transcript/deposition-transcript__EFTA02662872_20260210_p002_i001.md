Farouk, 
Attached is the bottomline analysis of the options availa=le to the Company right now. It is a 
pretty stark difference between the t=o paths. Ultimately we are asking BlackRock to chose the path that is econ=mically 
best for them - we are killing ourselves for them to have a better=financial outcome. Our intentions should be aligned... 
I've also attached a timeline of our BlackRock relationsh=p. There is a one page summary at the 
beginning and the full detail behind=it. 
Hey are notes in some key areas:<=div> 
The Senior Investment Analysts on our deal have been Daniel Daniel and Pa=rick Edelmann. 
They seem powerless in the situation and do not stand up to=Lisa. 
• 
No one from BlackRock has visited =awbone in 2016. They have not seen any of the new 
things we are working on= No demos of the prototypes, nothing. 
Possible anticipated points from BlackRock and our responses 
=div style="font-family:helvetica;font-size:12px" class="gmail_msg"> 
• 
Management team- we don't trust Hosain, the Board, his managemen= team, 
everything he and the team have told us has turned out to not be tr=e, promises are never hit. We have missed targets 
and it has been =ainful. We are taking great care to make sure we don't repeat the =istakes of the past, there are 
reasons we missed targets - slow sales in s=ores, quality issues, product delays. We had a bad product cycle and we 
ha=en't been funded to come out of it. Instead of focusing on the bus=ness we fight with BR. It's a waste. But to your 
point it sort of =oesn't matter relative to the economically rational decision going=forward. 
• 
Wasting money - opex super high put in this much money=three months later they 
needed more money Again perhaps=we should have cut expenses earlier but we needed to move the ball forward=to 
where it is today in many areas. We have a smart focused plan going for=ard where have a very manageable burn rate 
and are raising 2 years of oper=ting capital. We have never done this in the history of the business.4*=A0 
• 
Deals aren't real, they create the term shee=s and they aren't real, we can't respond 
until =hey are real. No one will move forward with closing until term sh=ets are agreed to. This feels like a stall tactic. 
• 
They threw this La=ry/JPM term sheet in front of us, Larry Unrein says he isn't sure =f he 
will do it or not, we got the feeling that JP Morgan wasn't a sureshot*=A0- Larry hadn't taken the deal to his 
investment committee and go=ten final approval because he wanted BR to sign off on it before he got th= final approval 
to ensure he didn't have to go back multiple times= If BR shows flexibility and a willingness, Larry will come through and 
fu=d. Other investors are also happy to participate. 
Third party feedback 
• 
Our Skadden lawyer on the re-structuring side is widely considered to be =he top re-
structuring lawyer in the country. He will tell you he has never=seen anyone behave as BlackRock has behaved in the 
dozens of deals he has =orked on - no debtor has not even engaged in a dialogue to give feedback o= possible solutions. 
• 
Skadden has also st=ted repeatedly that the Board since May has done more than any 
other Board=they have ever seen in exploring every option and finding the best solutio= for all constituents - we have 
turned over every possible stone we could =hink of to find a solution. 
• 
P.IT has never seen=a lender behave this way in any situation they have been involved 
with 
CODE does not understand what BlackRock is doing a=d why
