"The allegations are not only categorically false, but disgusting at the 
highest level and clearly framed to solicit media attention or, more 
likely, are politically motivated. To be clear, there is absolutely no merit 
to these claims and, based on our investigation, no evidence that 
the person who has made these allegations actually exists." — Alan Garten, 
corporate attorney for Donald Trump, April 28, 2016 
The federal lawsuit, titled Katie Johnson v. Donald J. Trump and Jeffrey E. 
Epstein, accuses Trump and Epstein of rape and other sexual 
assaults during the summer of 1994, when plaintiff was 13 years old. 
Attorney Garten denied the accusations and cast doubt on the 
existence of the plaintiff. 
Attorney Garten's denial of rape claims against Donald Trump and Jeffrey 
Epstein dates from April 2016, when the case was filed by a 
"Katie Johnson," a possible pseudonym, on April 26 in U.S. District Court in 
Riverdale, California (home of plaintiff). The case, apparently 
filed pro se by the plaintiff, acting without a lawyer, sought $100 million 
in damages from defendants for, among other things, violating her 
Civil Rights and "by making her their sex slave." The case appears to have 
been first reported online by DailyMail.com, which included 
Garten's denial as well as a sampling of the lurid details of the 
allegations. Other early coverage appears to have been limited to other 
online news sites including RADAR online, Winning Democrats, Sunday Express, 
AntiMedia.org, and NYDailyNews.com. 
Less than a week after the case was filed under federal Civil Rights 
statutes, a federal judge ruled that it was a mistake and dismissed the 
case. On May 2, citing the Civil Rights basis of the suit, the judge wrote: 
"Even construing the ... pleading liberally, Plaintiff has not alleged 
any race-based or class-based animus against her, and consequently, her ... 
allegations fail to state a claim upon which relief may be 
granted." The dismissal received even less coverage than the filing. RADAR 
online reported: "Judge Trashes Bogus Donald Trump Rape 
Lawsuit," even though the judge had ruled only on the terms of the filing, 
not on any of the substance of the case as "bogus" or otherwise. 
Once dismissed, however, the case was over, at least for the moment. 
Plaintiff could have re-filed the complaint in correct form in 
California. Instead she apparently found a lawyer to file for her in New 
York, the home state of both defendants. 
On June 20, seven weeks after the California dismissal, New Jersey attorney 
Thomas Francis Meagher filed the same case in revised 
form in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New Yorkon behalf 
of plaintiff "Jane Doe, proceeding under a pseudonym" and 
seeking a jury trial. The filing is titled: 
Global Research Publishers 
"Complaint for rape, sexual misconduct, criminal sexual acts, sexual abuse, 
forcible touching, assault, battery, intentional and reckless 
infliction of emotional distress, duress, false imprisonment, and defamation" 
The complaint outlines central issues in the case succinctly:
