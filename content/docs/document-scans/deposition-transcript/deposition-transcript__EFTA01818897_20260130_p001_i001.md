Re: 
I have decided to not fight with you. you refuse to do things after I spend alarge amount of time 
explaining in excruciating detail the history, reasons, culture, i showed you the apple experiment, 
so that you might understand the underlying mechanism of spoilage. I ve done it over and over 
and over and over again with you.. , I tell you the proportions of flowers . golden mean 2;3 I ask 
that they not be dead, I tell you about eggs , I chose to ignore the meal you made I didn;t want a 
problcm,So I find myself living a life of merely accepting the absence of quality that you choose 
not to aspire to. , spoiled apples and why, i tell you about fresh breads, i tell you about 
cleanliness, and dog shit on the floor, i tell you that you need to plan in advance for food, why 
ask what i would like for breakfast in the nesxt ten minutes when there is no food to cook. You 
send jansuch , 
. shopping , and leave it up to them, I tell you about, meats, you give me 
janushcs bacon, rotten stinky food in the fridge, half of a bread that has laid there for a week. I 
specifically asked jinky not to throw it away , to see how green it would have to get, before you 
did anything about it. I have not had an argument with you over anything have gone through with 
you multiple times, I love you, think about how many times lye tried to explain to you about the 
basics of cooking.. , and after that , except for the soups which have been great, I spent time 
going through a breakfast book„ three weeks ago.. for what ? I love you„ I understand that not 
holding you to your word is my fault. you suggest helpers and then ignore them. , Re 
i 
needed help. ,

instead of doing it with me? That is a 
perfect example. You spend time with them, show them and explain what you want, when and how. Think 
about that. Why didn't you go to whole foods with me..and home depot the last time ? Why didn't you 'go 
through the house' with me? You make things as difficult as you can for me; expect me to read your mind at 
every moment, guess what and when you might want to cat today, not bother you by asking questions except 
between 6.30AM- 7am and when I can't do that, you feel it is right to complain. With other people you "spend 
the day going through cabinets and flowers" and you are surprised to get a different result. 
I still don't have any explanation re you changing 
trip as soon as I left despite our agreement she would 
leave yesterday.
