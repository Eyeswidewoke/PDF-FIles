local would then take very delicate experiments, with finely tuned initial and final conditions to 
restrict to the case where the worldlines of the ingoing and outgoing particles are all mutualy 
+c-intersecting. Hence, the world could be pc-local rather than local, and we would not yet have 
noticed the disfinctione. 
There is a third point which may play a role in resolving the paradoxes of locality. Let us return 
to the time coordinate t. It is possible to choose the phase space description so that t commutes 
with the components of spatial momentum. Hence t can be used to discuss the dynamics in 
momentum space. However, as we shall see in the next section, this comes with a cost, which is 
that the usual position-momentum commutators are deformed to 
[xi, pi] = 
f (pi)) 
(6) 
where f(p0) is the function 
J(E) = et00/4
(7) 
This has an interesting consequence, which is that we can introduce a new time coordinate that 
does commute with the xi. This is7
It is easy to confirm that, 
T = t + rt I (vo) 
(8) 
[T, xi] = 0 
(9) 
Hence, it is unproblematic to discuss events defined in a spacetime coordinatized by (x1,T), even 
in the quantum theory. So it is natural to propose that the classical spacetime in which we observers make 
measurements is defined by clocks that measure T and rulers that measure xi. 
However, T no longer commutes with pa, instead 
[T, Pi] = ItyPi 
(10) 
Hence there is a good time coordinate, T, to discuss evolution of wavefunctions in position space. 
And there is a good time coordinate, t, to discuss evolution in momentum space. But they are 
related to each other by the non-local transform (8). This plays a role in the derivation of the 
spreading of wavepackets in (x1.71) space. 
While the aim of this paper is to address the issue of physical consistency of DSR, we note 
that there are phenomenological implications of the results derived below. By studying the prop-
agation of a wavepacket in (x` ,T) spacetime we are able to study the question of the energy de-
pendence of the speed of massless particles. We find that there is a first order variation of the 
speed of light with energy. In addition, there is another first order effect, which is the new contri-
bution to spreading of wavepackets. This gives a stochastic variation of arrival times of photons 
proportional to TtpAE, where T is the time traveled and AE is the uncertainty in energy of the 
6We may note that this appears to disagree with the claim of Hossenfelder in (6J that in this language can be trans-
lated as the assertion that n-local physics is ruled out by experiment. However, it should be stressed that whether this 
is due to her model of DSR physics being different or to another cause is not clear at this time. What we can assert is 
that no claim can be made that physics in ic-Minkowski spacetime is grossly in contradiction with the observed locality 
of physical interactions.
