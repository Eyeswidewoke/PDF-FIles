There is nothing here, or elsewhe=e in the document, that restricts it to the brief period before the sale of the Lexington 
house. 
I have no information at all abou= having received any DNI. If there is such information, it should be sent to me so that I 
can use it for our own plans. 
I don't see much point in a m=eting. It seems to me that all of this can be cleared up in writing.

Hi, thanks for your reply. 
We are very, very concerned that you are not understanding and not getting help in understanding what is happening 
with your finances. Your responses below only increase our concern. The three of us are not able to serve as financial 
advisors. We urge you strongly to speak directly with Max so that he can clarify what he says in the Memo and expla=n 
what the Promissory Note language means. 
Just to give you one example of our concern: You focus on one phrase: that the interest will be "at the highest rate in 
effect." =ut you are taking those words out of context. We really don't think we =hould be trying to explain these 
details to you, but to try to summarize: t=is phrase applied to the double nature of the loan—the Marital Trust h=d to 
borrow money from Pershing to make the loan to you, until the Lexington house was sold. The phrase you quote applies 
only to that brief perio=, and has no impact on the interest accruing now or in the future. 
We can see why focusing on those six words would make you angry. But the six words mean nothing in and of 
themselves (i.e., what rate is "in=effect"?). But instead of doing the logical thing—getting the full information=E2 you 
are just so angry that you refuse to find out the truth. 
=br> 
Again, this is just one example of where you are stating conclusions based on faulty or incomplete information. There 
are explanations for your other issues as well (how the DNI is paid to you, how the interest payments can be made, etc) 
but rather than us trying to summarize the information for you here, we think it would make more sense for you to 
discuss them with the people who set all of this up, in the context of a broader conversation= Reading your response 
only redoubles our sense that you are simply misreadi=g important elements of your entire financial situation, and that 
you are making big decisions based on faulty information. We feel that you have painted yourself into a corner, in which 
you arrive at the worst possi=le interpretation of complex legal language, and then refuse to speak with the very people 
who could explain it to you, and just get angry at them based on your misinterpretations. 
We beg you once again to meet with us and with the people who set up the Trust, the loan, etc., to clarify these issues. 
Love, Avi, Diane and Harry
