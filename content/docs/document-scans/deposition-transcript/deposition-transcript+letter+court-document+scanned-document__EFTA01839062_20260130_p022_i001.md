head housekeeper and Diallo had re-entered the presidential suite. They were joined at 12:45 PM 
by the head engineer and the security guard and they remained there for approximate 5 minutes. 
If Diallo told then the same story she later told police, they knew only that she had been violently 
attacked by a naked man who came out of the bedroom of the presidential suite at about noon. 
Since Diallo had not previously seen DSK— she had not been on duty when DSK arrived the 
previous evening— she could not have known that he, and not an intruder, was the attacker. The 
hotel staff, according to prosecutors' documents, did not show her a photograph of DSK by the 
hotel staff until 2:30 PM. So, when they heard her initial story, they could not rule out the 
possibility that an intruder had gotten into the suite after DSK had left it, and attacked her. If so, it 
was possible that a criminal was still lurking in the hotel and could be a danger to others. That 
was reason enough to call the police immediately. In addition, they had to consider the well-being 
of their fellow employee. Diallo said she was dragged across a room and molested. Even if there 
were no visible injuries, she might require immediate medical attention or trauma counseling. 
The suite had a phone. Yet, instead of calling for police and medical help, they took Diallo 
downstairs, through the main lobby, and to a bench in the employees' entranceway across from the 
security office. Here, without any privacy or comfort, she waited for 50 minutes before the call 
was finally made. 
During this wait, there was no lack of communications. The CCTV tapes show that both the 
head engineer and security guard frequently used their cell phones, Yet, no one from the hotel's 
human resources department, which deals with employee welfare, was brought down to talk her. 
If the hotel staff was waiting for some development, what was it? 
One possibility is that Diallo was initially unwilling to file a complaint, Such a theory was 
suggested by Lanny Davis, the Washington lawyer retained by the Sofitel's owner, the Accor 
Group, in an interview on NBC's Today Show in December 2011. Presumably as the crisis 
manager for the Sofitel he had access to its employees. In attempting to explain the weird dance 
between the security guard and head engineer following the call to the police, Davis said it was 
possible that the two men were celebrating Diallo's finally agreeing at 1:30 PM "to allow the 
hotel to call 911." The implication is that for an hour she had not agreed to such a call. While 
such a scenario is possible, the prosecutors specifically cited the promptness of her outcry for 
help as a factor that made them believe her story. If she had been unwilling to make a complaint 
for over an hour, it raised the question what or who changed her mind at I:30 PM. 
Another possibility is that the hotel staff was awaiting authorization from a higher level 
before calling 911 . After all, DSK was a possible future President of France, and making the 911 
call would likely involve the French-owned hotel in a major scandal. The CCTV tapes depict the 
head engineer and security guard almost constantly on his cell phone in the three minutes prior to 
911 call. (See Appendix F) . The cell phone records also show Accor's chief of security in New 
York, called the head engineer at 1:28 PM, also sent a text to the hotel manager, who then sped to 
the hotel on a motor scooter (arriving only 7 minutes before the police.) A flurry of cell phone 
communications preceded the 911 call, and the employees at the hotel could have been influenced 
by these calls. 
The Victory Dance 
Ordinarily a scandal is not good news for a first-class hotel. It is particularly onerous if it 
involves the arrival of uniformed police in the lobby, authorities subpoenaing CCTV tapes, and
