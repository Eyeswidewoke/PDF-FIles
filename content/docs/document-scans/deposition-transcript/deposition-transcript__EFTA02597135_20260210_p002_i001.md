With 10% intraday ranges in price, and vols trading 50, it's hard to take a view and stick to it.. but I d= think 
prompt vols are too rich compared to mid/back. For example CLM5 had only a slightly smaller intraday range today 
compared to CLHS (8.1% vs 7.5%), but it is trading at over 6 vols discount..a gamma neutral straddle spread can be a 
good trade idea here to monetize the discount..
