e: romise art 
And note the unauthorized maintaining of multiple art lists and the request=for information from paralegal vs from 
accounting that maintains art datab=se. I added all gift information to the inventory data warehouse and then= pre-
existing lists were explicitly made obsolete by my cataloguing effort=. I look forward to working with Larry to improve 
organizational processe=.

> This is exactly what i referred to as not a 100% / 0 effort. Works are j=intly owned and there are requirements to 
properly insure by contract. Fr=m accounting perspective I need to track down invoices, check what was pai=, and. 
compare to contracts or letters of intention. For example, in past= invoice did not indicate joint ownership but gift letter 
stated joint own=rship. I figure I get all documentation and hand off to Ada to deal with =state issues. And given the 
mandate to be point person on art related it=ms, i lead the effort to gather facts and get complete our records so as t= 
have global view of artworks. I must provide to Ada in her efforts. She reads for estate tax inclusion and understanding 
of any legal obligations e=c.

need to be involved to tease=out all issues germane to my efforts.

various museums. I have not yet reviewed it against the ac=ual documents so I would rather she not circulate it as her 
descriptions o= the provisions may not be accurate.

these are legal document= and require an assessment of Leon's obligation (and the obligation of Leo='s estate or Debra's 
estate) to give the works to the museums at some poi=t in the future. We need to know which are legally binding on his 
estate,=in some cases, to obtain the completed paperwork and ensure that Leon comp=ies with the terms of each 
agreement. There are also issues in connection=with making fractional interest gifts of art that need to be looked into.

so it does not seem to fall wi=hin your job segmentation as Jeffrey described it today.
