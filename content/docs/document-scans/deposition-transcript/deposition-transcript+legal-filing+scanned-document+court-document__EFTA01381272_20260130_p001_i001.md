poultry by-product meals, artificial preservatives or corn and we deny that any of our grain-free products contain grains. We also assert that Nestle 
Purina's statements falsely imply that our products are not made in the United States and arc subject to quality control issues. We allege that Nestle 
Purina's conduct as described in this lawsuit is aimed at destroying the reputation and goodwill of the 13LUE brand and may induce consumers to 
make purchasing decisions based on Nestle Purina's false and misleading representations about the composition and sourcing of BLUE products. 
Our complaint in this lawsuit seeks, among other things, a preliminary and permanent injunction prohibiting Nestle Purina from disseminating such 
false information. as well as damages (including punitive damages). restitution and disgorgement of all profits attributable to their false and 
deceptive advertising. On June 4, 2014, this lawsuit was consolidated with the Nestle Purina lawsuit. We have since amended our pleading to name 
as additional defendants the two advertising and public relations agencies that assisted Nestle Purina with its advertising campaign. 
In the course of pretrial discovery in the consolidate) Nestle Purina lawsuit, beginning in September 2014 documents and information 
were revealed that indicate that a facility owned by a major supplier of ingredients to the pet food industry, including Blue Buffalo. for a period of 
time, had mislabeled as "chicken meal- or "turkey meal' ingredients that contained other poultry-based ingredients that were inappropriate for 
inclusion in "chicken meal" or "turkey meal- under industry standards, and it appears that this mislabeling was deliberate. This conduct was 
undertaken by the supplier without our knowledge. and we have since retaced purchasing ingredients from this supplier. This supplier was one of 
our primary sources of chicken meal and turkey meal. As a result of the supplier's conduct, our advertising claims of "no chicken or poultry by-
product meals" were inaccurate as to products containing the mislabeled ingredients. Therefore, we may be exposed to false advertising liability to 
Nestle Purina and others to the extent a claimant can prove they were injured by our actions. Such liability may be material. We have brought third-
party indemnity and damages claims, with respect to the Nestle Purina lawsuit. against the supplier that mislabeled the ingredients. as well as the 
broker for such mislabeled ingredients. and also have insurance coverage for some of the Nestle Purina lawsuit claims. However, we may not be 
able to fully recover from such supplier. broker or from our insurance the full amount of any damages we might incur in these matters. 
We are vigorously defending ourselves against the Nestle Purina and related class action lawsuits. However. Nestle Purina's allegations. 
whether made in their lawsuit or through press releases, social media or other public announcements. may result in a loss of consumer confidence 
in our brand and products and a reduction in our sale; if consumers perceive us as being untruthful in our marketing and advertising and may 
materially adversely affect our brand. reputation. business, financial condition and regilts of operations. regardless of the outcome of the litigation 
and any damages we may recover from Nestle Purina. In addition, if we do not prevail in our defense of these claims, we may be required to pay 
substantial damages and may not be able to fully recover those damages from either our insvrance, the ingredient supplier, the ingredient broker or 
any other responsible parties. In addition, we may be enjoined from continuing certain marketing and advertising practices, which have been an 
important driver of the growth of our brand and business. If the relief sought in the Nestle Purina lawsuit or any related lawsuit is granted, the 
impact on the Company could be material. We expect these legal proceedings will be costly and time consuming and will require a commitment of 
management and personnel resources that will be diverted from our normal business operations. In addition, during the course of this litigation, we 
anticipate announcements of the court's decisions in connection with hearings, motions and other matters, as well as other interim developments 
related to the litigation. If securities analysts or investors regard these announcements as being unfavorable to us, the market price of our common 
stock may decline. 
We may not successfully ramp up operations at our Heartland facility or our Heartland facility may not operate in accordance with our 
expectations. 
In September 2014, we commenced manufacturing operations at our Heartland facility in Joplin, Missouri and expect to ramp up the 
facility to full production by the third quarter of 2015. Any substantial delay in bringing this facility up to full production on our current schedule 
may hinder our ability to produce all of the product needed to meet orders and/or to achieve our expected financial performance. Opening this 
facility has
