I informed you that I selected Mr. I= 
because he was a friend and classmate of two people 
whom I respected, and that I had never met or spoken with Mr.
prior to contacting him about 
this case. All of those facts are true. I still have never met Mr. 
and, at the time that he and 
I spoke about this case, he did not know about my relationship with his friend. You suggest that I 
ather than 
should have 
licitly informed you that one of the referrals came from my
a
ti
simply a 
which is the term I used, but it is not my nature to discuss my personal 
relationships wi opposing counsel. Your attacks on me and on the victims establish why I wanted 
to find someone whom I could trust with safeguarding the victims' best interests in the face of 
intense pressure from an unlimited number of highly skilled and well paid attorneys. Mr. 
was that person. 
One of your letters suggests a business relationship between Mr.= 
and
This is patent) untrue and neither 
nor I would have received any financial bene it 
from Mr. 
appointment. Fu htre
 after Mr. 
learned more about Mr. Epstein's 
actions (as described below), he expressed a willingness 
andle the case pro Bono, with no 
financial benefit even to himself. Furthermore, you were given several other options to choose from, 
including the Podhurst firm, which was later selected by 
You rejected those other 
options. 
You also allege that I improperly disclosed information about the case to Mr. 
provided Mr. 
with a bare bones summary of the agreement's terms related to his appointment 
to help him deci e whether the case was something he and his firm would be willing to undertake. 
I did not provide Mr 
with facts related to the investigation because they were confidential 
and instead recommen e t at he "Google" Mr. Epstein's name for background information. When 
forwigthose questions to you, and you raised objections for the first time. I did not share any 
Mr. 
asked for additional information to assist his firm in addressing conflicts issues, I 
further information about Mr. Epstein or the case. Since Mr. 
had been told that you 
concurred in his selection, out of professional courtesy, I informe Mr. 
of the Office's 
decision to use a Special Master to make the selection and told him that the Office had made contact 
with 
. We have had no further contact since then and I have never had contact with 
. I understand from you that Mr. I= 
contacted 
. You criticize his 
ecisi
on 
to do so, yet you feel that you and your co-counsel were entit 
to contact 
to 
try to "lobby" him to select someone to your liking, despite the fact that the Non- rosecution 
Agreement vested the Office with the exclusive right to select the attorney representative. 
Another reason for my surprise about your allegations regarding misconduct related to the 
Section 2255 litigation is your earlier desire to have me perform the role of "faci litator" to convince 
the victims that the lawyer representative was selected by the Office to represent their interests alone 
and that the out-of-court settlement of their claims was in their best interests. You now state that 
doing the same things that you had asked me to do earlier is improper meddling in civil litigation. 
Much of your letter reiterates the challenges to Detective 
investigation that have
