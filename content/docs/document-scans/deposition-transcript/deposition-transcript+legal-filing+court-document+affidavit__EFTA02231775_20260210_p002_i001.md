million in after tax savings was just accomplished. though you left the 30 million 
outstanding that I had said should only be done if that was my additional fee. not 
used for non biz purposes and not art. 
re our financial arrangement 
the facts as i see them 
in June and then again Sept, we both agreed to a 50% of phaidon payout., then only 
after weeks, when you delayed any detailed discussion of money wanting to give 
the issue a thoughtful response ( which I fully understand ) . you unilaterally 
changed changed our agreement. . 5m would be reserved for the future ? . and 
out of the remaining 15m ,? i would receive only a third. ( note : I'm confident 
that both the debt , and the art space investment will also lead to a write off of 
another 30 m. plus ) In my dining room ,you were surprised when I said that i 
require most people to pay their advisory fee up front so that I am assured that I 
will be properly compensated for my work when strategies are implemented . you 
may recall that you appeared offended and said " arc you suggesting that i 
would go back on my word " I said no , of course not ! you are my closest of 
friends ,but my experience is that when amounts get large, people tend to get 
unhappy when it actually comes time for them to pay 
I include below the email i sent to you on April 15, the day i was examining your 
returns It laid out my understanding of the compensation for a transaction of the 
magnitude to the penny of the one just completed. though the number was great it 
was clear. When it appeared that the details could now be worked out I was the 
first to say , it is too much money, however. 
From day zero I proposed to discount to 50 - 60 million the fair price of the transaction 
just completed . including Phaidon. . though this amount was already 
substantially less than our agreed and negotiated formula. - I was never told 
that this was out of range. in fact, alternative methods of payment . plane, or 
an -in-kind payment were discussed ( ie including keeping the 30m portion of 
fee outstanding till March ) ,I provided as you specifically requested a detailed 
step by step execution plan and reviewed all documents that i was given access to. 
( Phaidon was not forthcoming ) in order to make my many corrections . I was 
then told that Alans involvement warranted a discount . Even in the best of light 
, though it is beyond question that not one time in the three years of his retainer 
has he ever proposed a unique idea. (including any wayt to deal with the use 
issue on debras death ,or even the most basic review of your largest asset by far , 
the BRH agreement. ) O.K. - lets say he made a contribution to the plan and 
stretch reality beyond the pale and say it was 50 %. though no one could posit 
such a large amount unless they were wearing a brightly colored clown suit. , the 
payment associated with the deal was known . It had both sent in writing and 
spoken about on the phone numerous times , a detailed execution plan was 
provided . then and only then after all was laid out for the group I was told that
