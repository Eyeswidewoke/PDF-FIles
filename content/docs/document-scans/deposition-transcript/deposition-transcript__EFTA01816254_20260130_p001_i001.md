Subject Re: 
you didn't constantly bitch about 
etc, you didn't feel as if you were entitled to ask 
where when why„ , you didn't fee r necesary to make others feel uncomfortable or tell me you 
would do things , promise to do things and then , not. you didn't feel able to putrify the house, 
and expent others to clean and ignore it. you and I had fun„ I had my naps , my ...., my 
 and 
you didn't get upset, and then mope around the whole day. I didn;t have to explain who was 
comiong and why. i didn't have to listen to " I called ten times and no one picked up.. You didn;t 
spend the majority of your time shopping for yourself, , I don't care about things„ if you think its 
the dirty carpet, instead of the total lack of thought , you are simply deluding yourself. , At that 
time if you recall, not one person did not coment on how nice it was to have someone who said 
little and was pleasant.. it then turned into jealousy 
russians. froge.,, , you did 
less and less, and expected more and more„ . do you t r 
r you crashed the car, i would give a 
shit.. about the car, if howver you told me that it would be better if i have to answer my own 
phones than have someone in my own house that helps out„ that is disturbing. I have not asked 
for you to fix it alone„ but i have asked you to do the monst minimal of things.. things that you 
continually refuse to do.. the flowers and the carpet ,are the results of your self focus. The last 
time you had your issue with the dog, was it becuase of the hardwood floor.. I think not.. It was 
the total lack of responsiblity .

Jeffrey, I can see I have a part in this unpleasant situation but I can't fix it alone. You seem so 
unhappy and let little things ruin your day, even a week.. I was so taken by you when I met 
you because I never knew anyone so easy going, carefree and fun and it was wonderful. You 
didn't let anything get to you and had an attitude that things are just things and people are 
what matters... 
I remember I broke a bike and ruined the stone border by the gym when I fist came to the island 
and I felt terrible about it. You just made a joke and never mentioned it again..chances of that 
reaction from you now are close to O. I don't know if you are just recovering from jail now or 
this is the new you but to see you shake with rage bacause of dead flowers still in the pot or a 
dirty carpet is very disturbing. It is understandable but it is how most men would react, not 
you.. In the scheme of things this is so petty and the reactions are so out of proportion. You 
will have to be miserable all day if you don't pick your battles.. I would know ;-)
