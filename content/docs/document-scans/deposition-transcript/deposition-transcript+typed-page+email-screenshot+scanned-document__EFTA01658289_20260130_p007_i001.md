DHS Compiled "Intelligence Reports" On Journalists Who Published Leaked 
Documents. 
The Washington Post (7/30, Al, Harris, 14.2M) reports DHS has compiled "intelligence reports" 
about "the work of American journalists covering protests in Portland, Ore., in what current and 
former officials called an alarming use of a government system meant to share information 
about suspected terrorists and violent actors." Over the past week, the department's Office of 
Intelligence and Analysis "disseminated three Open Source Intelligence Reports to federal law 
enforcement agencies and others, summarizing tweets written by two journalists - a reporter 
for the New York Times and the editor in chief of the blog Lawfare - and noting they had 
published leaked, unclassified documents about DHS operations in Portland." The intelligence 
reports, obtained by the Post, "include written descriptions and images of the tweets and the 
number of times they had been liked or retweeted by others."

"Adversaries." 
Politico (7/30, Seligman, 4.29M) reports Defense Secretary Esper "has directed the Pentagon to 
adjust the wording in a mandatory training course that identifies protesters and journalists as 
'adversaries,' a day after Politico first reported on the materials." The training material has been 
in use since 2010, but "it was shared with a wider audience following Esper's new guidance 
aimed at clamping down on leaks released this month, chief Pentagon spokesperson Jonathan 
Hoffman told reporters on Thursday." 
In Leaked Recording, Trump Asks Inhofe To Preserve Name Of Fort Lee. 
The Washington Examiner (7/30, Doyle, 448K) reports President Trump was overheard on a 
phone call to Senate Armed Services Chairman James Inhofe "asking for assurance that Fort 
Lee, a U.S. military base that bears the name of the commander of the Confederate Army, 
Robert E. Lee, would not be renamed." According to the New York Times, Trump asked Inhofe, 
"We're gonna keep the name of Robert E. Lee?" Inhofe was at "an Italian restaurant on Capitol 
Hill, when he took the call on Wednesday." Inhofe replied, "Just trust me. I'll make it happen." 
Inhofe "put the president on speakerphone, which allowed a nearby diner to record the call." 
Prosecutor: No Charges For Ferguson Officer Who Killed Michael Brown. 
The St. Louis Post-Dispatch (7/30, Currier, 685K) reports St. Louis County Prosecutor Wesley 
Bell on Thursday "finally answered the question that has followed him since his political 
campaign: Will he charge a former Ferguson police officer in the 2014 shooting death" of 
Michael Brown. The answer is "no." Speaking to reporters, Bell said, "This is one of the most 
difficult things I've had to do as an elected official. Although this case represents one of the 
most significant moments in St. Louis' history, the question to this office is a simple one: Could 
we prove beyond a reasonable doubt that when Darren Wilson shot Michael Brown he 
committed murder or manslaughter under Missouri law? After an independent and in-depth 
review of the evidence, we cannot prove that he did." 
The New York Times (7/30, Eligon, 18.61M) reports that "six years after a white police 
officer shot and killed" Brown "another investigation into the killing has come to the same 
conclusion as the first: The officer should not be charged." Thursday's announcement "most 
likely marks the end of the legal saga in a case that started the global rise of the Black Lives 
Matter movement."
