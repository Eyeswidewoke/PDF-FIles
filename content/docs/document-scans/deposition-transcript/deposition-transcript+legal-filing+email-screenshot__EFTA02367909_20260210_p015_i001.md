After Walt Disney World opened near Orlando, Florida,=in 1971, the circus attempted to cash in on the resulting tourism 
surge by opening Circus World theme park in nearby Haines City, which broke ground on April =6, 1973. The theme park 
was expected to become the circus's winter home as well as to have the Clown College lo=ated there. Mattel placed the 
circus corporation up for sale by December 1973 despite its profit contributions, =s Mattel as a whole showed a $29.9 
million loss in 1972. The park's=opening was then delayed until February 1974. Venture Out in America, Inc., a Gulf Oil 
recreational subsidiary, agreed to buy the combined shows =n January 1974, and the opening was further pushed back 
to 1975. While =he Circus Showcase for Circus World opened on February 21, 1974, Venture Out placed the purchase 
deal back into negotiations, and the opening of the whole complex was moved to an early 19=6. 
By May 1980, the company expanded to three circuses b= adding the one-ring International Circus Festival of Monte 
Carlo that debuted in l=pan and Australia. The Felds bought the circus back in 1982. Irvin Feld died in 1984 and the 
company has since been=run by Kenneth. Circus World was never successful, as its standard carnival-type rides were no 
match for Disney -=;s state-of-the-art attractions and was out of the way. The circus sold the pa=k to Arizona developers 
James Monaghan and Brian Burstein in 1984.

When in 1990 the Venice rail tracks could not support=the show's train cars, the combined circus moved its winter base 
to the Flo=ida State Fairgrounds in Tampa. In 1993, the clown college was moved from the Venice Arena to Baraboo, 
Wisconsin. =n 1995, the company founded the Center for Elephant Conservation (CEC)<=pan style="font-size:12pt;line-

early 1990s for Kenneth Feld and the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus. He was involved in the surveillanc= 
of Jan Pottker (a journalist =ho was writing about the Feld family) and of various animal rights groups such as PETA. 
After three years in Baraboo, the clown college opera=ed at the Sarasota Opera House in Sarasota until 1998 before the 
program was suspended. On February 26, 1999, the circus company started previewing Barnum's Kaleidoscape, a one 
ring, in=imate, upscale circus performed under the tent; designed to compete with similar upscale circuses such as 
Cirque du Soleil, Barnum's Kaleidoscape was no= successful, and ceased performances after the end of 2000. 
Nicole Feld became the first female producer of Ringl=ng Circus in 2004. In 2009, Nicole and Alana Feld co-produced the 
circus. In 2001, a group led by the Humane Society of the United States, sued the circ=s over alleged mistreatment of 
elephants. the suit ended in 2014 with the cir=us winning $25.2 million in settlements. On March 3, 2015, the Circus 
announced that all elephants would be retired in =018 to the CEC. The retirement date was subsequently moved 
forward to May 2016.
