Re: 
I said i would not bring it up, but if you like i can respond to this. b=lle getting pregnant by peabo , especially peabo was 
a direct result of yo=r being irresponsible , careless, reckless.. everything else flows from th=t. you dont pay attention. 
your slef views of your level of competence = experience flies in the face of reality , the outcomes are the same. 
your=self image of helping caring being there, is as fictional for me as they w=re for balle. I did not participate with balle 
so you would see , your dec=sions , without the abillity to blame me, ( which you haven't in bale =ase. ) left to your own 
judgment , result in disaster .Lucklily this time =to only dogs.-you say you dont need anyone to point out the mistakes. 
This=is about us, not about the dogs. your perception of your role in this m=ss is similar. 
When you in your words pick 
X, it is your choice= when you choose to be a bitch to frineds in my house it is your choice, w=en you choose to nag me , 
when you choose not to be helpful, (but think yo= are, ► the results are all the same . THe facts are the facts. Your bl=ck 
instructor for the plane , gets to point out your mistakes. that is his=job,. that is how you learn, your defensivness and 
lack of accpetance, of =epsonsiblity, is painful to watch. THe dog issue makes it clear, you ha= the best boyfriend , and 
the best dog. neither one still are.

I don't know how our recollection of events can be so different. 
You left to NYC and didn't answer your phone when she was giving birth =hile Story stayed on the phone with 
me throughout the night. I was terrifi=d about anything going wrong and I made decisions not based on Story's=opinion, 
but the vet's. I hope we can at least agree I absolutely want=d to do what was best for Ball-e and had no other 
motivation. You made no =ecisions, waited for the result of mine and then lectured me about what I =id wrong. Well, at 
that point I could see it for myself and don't need=anyone to point out the mistakes. Regarding Fatt-e you were 
unfortunately =gain not available during the critical moments and I had to make decisions=by myself about where to 
take her and what to do. You clearly had no contr.' over it and I am not suggesting you left me without help on purpose. 
You=were very helpful and kind once you landed. I did the best I could and the=e was nothing irresponsible or reckless 
about my decisions. I do feel guil=y for not being home for the few hours before you left when something happ=nded to 
Fatt-e. 
For the record, I am not suggesting you are responsible for anything that h=ppend with the dogs at all. They 
were fully my responsibility. You were no= involved and I realize the mistakes that were made. What I am saying is t=at 
you are not in a position to discipline me about it or blame me for wha= happened
