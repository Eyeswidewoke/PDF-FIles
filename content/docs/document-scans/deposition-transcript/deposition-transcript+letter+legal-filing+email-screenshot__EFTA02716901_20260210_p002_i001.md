What's happening is simple physics. Warm wa=er eats away at the ice from underneath. Then more ice is exposed to 
the water, and it too melts. =inally, the ice above the water collapses into the water and melts. Climate change has 
shifted the wind pattern around the continent, pushing warmer water far=her north against and below the western ice 
sheet and the peninsula. The =arm, more northerly water replaces the cooler water that had been there. It's only a 
couple degrees Fahrenheit=warmer than the water that used to be there, but that makes a huge difference in melting, 
scientists said. "Before Antarctica was much of a wi=d card," said University of Washington ice scientist Ian Joughin. 
At its current rate, the rise of the world's ocea=s from Antarctica's ice melt would be barely noticeable, about one-third 
of a millimeter a year. The oceans are that vast. But if all the West Antarctic ice sheet that's connected to water melts 
unstoppably, as several experts p=edict, there will not be time to prepare. Scientists estimate it will take a=ywhere from 
200 to 1,000 years to melt enough ice to raise seas by 10 feet, maybe only =00 years in a worst case scenario. If that 
plays out, developed coastal cities such as New York and Guangzhou could fa=e up to $1 trillion a year in flood damage 
within a few decades and countless other population centers will be vulnerable. "Cha=ging the climate of the Earth or 
thinning glaciers is fine as long as you don L=;t do it too fast. And right now we are doing it as fast as we can. It's not 
good," said Rignot, of NA=A. "We have to stop it; or we have to slow it down as best as we can."

At the same time the Arctic Sea ic= this year is the smallest in winter since satellite records began in 1979, in a new sign 
of long-term climate change, U.S. data showed on March 19, 2015. The ice floating =n the Arctic Ocean around the 
North Pole reached its maximum annual extent of just 14.54 million squa=e km (5.61 million sq. miles) on Feb. 25 -
slightly bigger than Canada 40=93 and is now expected to shrink with a spring thaw. "This year's maximum ice extent 
was the lowest in the satellite record, with below-average ice conditions everywhere except in the Labrador Sea and 
Davis Strait,"
