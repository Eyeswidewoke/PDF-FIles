True. I have no excuses. The =nly thing I can tell you is that I'm trying to do 
better by learning f=om my mistakes in order to not repeat them. I've waisted my time by go=ng to parties instead of 
being serious. Everything was confused in my mind=and I didn't really know what path to take, it's very easy to get =ost 
when you are young, specially into fake illusions. Still now, I'm =rying to understand myself and who I am. I believe it 
takes time and it L;5 different from person to person. Now little by little I've started =o focus more. I'm starting to 
understand real life, what are my priori=ies and things that really matter. Here are some actual facts: I'=ve started to 
earn some money ( which I've never did before ) which I =elieve it's already a small accomplishment. I did some 
babysitting and=after 2 paid trial days ( 250 euros per day ) shooting for Vogue and Dior,=I've got hired by one of the 
best fashion photographers called 
to be his assistant ( paid job ). I'm very happy and excited to =ork and 
learn from him which is better than any photography school. II= ready to work as long as I need to in order to build my 
skills and stand =ut in that field. I think I've achieved some results and gained some v=lue if I compare myself 2 years ago 
from now. Thanks to you I had the poss=bility to make many interesting experiences like Ferragamo in China and Al=ia in 
Paris. Even though I didn't get hired from them, those expe=iences allowed me to understand what I like and what I 
don't like and =haped in part the person I am. Thanks to the Alaia internship and my =assion for photography I am now 
working with 
doing what I re=lly like. However even though I work hard and I am paid I cannot fully 
sup=ort myself to pay a rent and my living in Paris. I really would like to co=tinue through this path, I feel it's the right 
one but I need your hel=, your support and your advices because I cannot make it by myself. <=div> 
I promise I will use my money wisely without throwing it away int= futilities like 
parties and holidays because I want to grow and build my =kills, my carrier and hopefully my future self.
