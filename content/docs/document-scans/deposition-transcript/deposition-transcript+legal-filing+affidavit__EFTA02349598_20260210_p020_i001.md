guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black, Presley was an early popularizer of rockabilly, an up-tempo, backbeat-
driven fusion of country music and rhythm and blues. RCA Vic=or acquired his contract in a deal arranged by Colonel 
Tom Parker, who managed the singer for more than two decades. Presley's first RCA single, "Heartbreak Hotel&qu=t;, 
was released in January 1956 and became a number-one hit in the United States.=C2* He was regarded as the leading 
figure of rock and roll after a series of successful network television appearances and chart-topping records. His 
energized interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance style, combin=d with a singularly potent mix of 
influences across color lines that coincide= with the dawn of the Civil Rights Movement, made him enormously popular 
l>=804> and controversial. 
In November 1956, he made his film debut in Love Me Tender.= In 1958, he was drafted into military service: He 
resumed his recording career two years later, producing some of his most commercially successful work before devoting 
much of the 1960s to making Hollywood movies and their accompanying soundtrack albums, most of which we=e 
critically derided. In 1968, following a seven-year break from live performances, he returned to the stage in the 
acclaimed televised comeback special Elvis, which led to an extended Las Vegas concert residency and a string of highly 
profitable tours. In 1973, Presley was featured in the first globally broadcast concert via satellite, Aloha fr=m Hawaii. 
Several years of prescription drug abuse severely damaged his health, and he died in 1977 at the age of 42. 
Presley is one of the m=st celebrated and influential musicians of the 20th century. Commercially successful in many 
genres= including pop, blues and gospel, he is the best-selling solo artist in the history of recorded music, with estimated 
album sales of around 600 million units worldwide. He was nominated for 14 competitive Grammys and won three, also 
receiving the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award at age 36, and has been inducted into multiple music hall= of fame. 
Forbes named Elvis Presley as the 2nd top earning dead celebrity with S55 million as of 2011. 
Presley's rise to=national attention in 1956 transformed the field of popular music and had a huge effect on the broader 
scope of popula= culture. As the catalyst for the Cultural Revolution that was rock and roll, he was central not only to 
defining it as a musical genre but in making it a touchstone of youth culture and rebellious attitude. With=its racially 
mixed origins — repeatedly affirmed by Presley — rock and roll's occupation of a central position in mainstream 
American culture facilitated=a new acceptance and appreciation of black culture. In this regard, Lit=le Richard said of 
Presley, "He was an integrator. Elvis was a blessing. They wouldn't let black music through. He opened the door for 
black music." AI=Green agreed: "He broke the ice for all of us." 
<=p> 
President Jimmy Carter remarked on his legacy in 1=77: "His music and his personality, fusing the styles of white country 
and black rhythm and blues, permanently changed=the face of American popular culture. His following was immense, 
and he was a symbol to people the world over of the vitality, rebelliousness, and good humor of his country." Pr=sley 
also heralded the vastly expanded reach of celebrity in the era of mass communication: at the age of 21, with=n a year 
of his first appearance on American network television, he was one of =he most famous people in the world.
