Universe is finite: objectified expression of activity: the assumption of the positive-negative abstractions particular to the 
subject-predicate proposition; the assumption of the process of subject-predicate. No ultimate subject: the unity is unitless. 
ficeWhere you end / And I begin / Or any else, in fine, / On such dichotomies depend / Therein% no one left to draw a line.a14
Subject-predicate: nounaTmd. Noun: negated. Syntax: confused. 
aceA noun is the name of things . . . why after a thing is named write about it.au The major accomplishment of science is that 
it has never produced an objective fact, never proven the existence of an object. No nouns: no objects, no people, no 
propositions, nothing. Living with Acethe growing terror of nothing to think about.Al2
Undifferentiation of activity: no division of activity into parts. No differences; no between. ficeTo be without description of to 
be.a" 
It is impossible to pay less than one hundred percent attention. It is impossible to do less than you do. Universe: verb. Do: 
always one hundred percent: the do of do; the do of not do. Activity: always one hundred percent: the activity of activity; the 
activity of nonactivity. Experience: always one hundred percent: the experience of experiencing; the experience of not 
experiencing. You canaTMt do less than you do. Doing: complete, obligatory, always one hundred percent, whether the focus 
is the part or the whole; the totality or the selection obscuring the totality. ficeI ama is doing: donaTMt call it being. Awl am 
nod is doing: donaTMt call it nonexistence. ace! thinks is doing: donaTMt call it thought. Do: aceThe final elegance, not to 
console / Nor sanctify, but plainly to propoundlim 
Undifferentiated activity. DonaTMt call it Life. DonaTMt call it Man. Talk aceof gods and man destroyed, the right / To know 
established as the right to be. / The ancient symbols will be nothing then. / We shall have gone behind the symbols / To that 
which they symbolized.V Use unambiguous language for objective description: elementary physical laws are all expressed by 
statistical formulas. aceAll the pictures which science now draws of nature, and which alone seem capable of according with 
observational fact, arc mathematical pictures.A16
The description is the thing. The most important thing is the next word; the to-be-said. Not a word and yet another kind of 
word: acea refinement of general language, supplementing it with appropriate tools to represent relations for which ordinary 
verbal expression is imprecise or cumbersome.av No ultimate subject. aceJust by avoiding the reference to the conscious 
subject which infiltrates daily language, the use of mathematical symbols secures the unambiguity of definition required for 
objective description/a" 
Get through the history of words. aceThrow away the lights, the definitions, / And say of what you see in the dark /'That it is 
this or that it is that, / But do not use the rotted names.A19
Universe: verb. The coupling of observer-observed system. The doing of man-environment. The doing of aceI think.i 
Universe: not observer, not man, not I. The unity is unitless, an expression of undifferentiated activity. aceWe need no longer 
discuss whether light consists of particles or waves; we know all there is to be known if we have found a mathematical 
formula which accurately describes its behavior and we can think of it as either particles or waves according to our mood and 
convenience of the moment.a" It aceexists in a mathematical formula; this, and nothing else, expresses the ultimate reality.0 
aceOur task can only be to aim at communicating experiences and views to others by means of language in which the practical
