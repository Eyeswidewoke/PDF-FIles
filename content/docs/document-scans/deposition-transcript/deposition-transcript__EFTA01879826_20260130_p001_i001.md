Subject: Re: Fwd: 
my march8„ - i m not suggesting you move from ny( as each time isay that as since i have said 
that many many times and you have ignored it. it only causes you to shut down, and the cycle 
restarts. ) When i began my house arreest in july of 09, the house reeked of dog pee, the garden 
was untouched and the house was a pig sty. three years ago . you were 23 . the time when most 
girls begin their adult life, after school. i gave the exact same advice. aJob builds into a career. , 
I have helped , longer, harder, and bcacuse it was you ,even in the face of a hurricane force 
headwind on the nose. as you continued to go your own way. no matter how i suggested 
coerced, railed, argued, tried to convince , .." move out an get a job," is said to all young adults. 
some as you rightly point out see it as a punishment , that somehow they to have to learn to 
contribute as opposed to merely. consume, . however that would rehash the same tedious and 
going nowhere discussion. I have no point to prove. I was certain that this is where things would 
end up, I told you they would , but again, you decided against all of my experiecince . caring and 
advice to take this road.. I think you should get a job , most likely outiside of new york, you 
have chosen to be a 
not me.. I would take any job i could if i were you learn the business 
of=„ 
as you now have the skill to operate ate, you need to learn the skill of opserating 
a buisness. ( getting along with IM like people„your customers , will be the first lesson )I will 
help as much as i can , get a job

Best 
- ...you are suggesting a 'job' instead of a career or help with a business that could actually 
offer some financial independence? 
Advice 
- "move out and get a job" sounds more like a punishment. For what, I really don't know... 
Yes there is no doubt you have provided financial support and I greatly appreciate it. I thought you 
forwarded it to me implying an interest in what it was used for...my mistake.
