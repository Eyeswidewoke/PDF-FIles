if the affected party has at any time in the period beginning on the date on which the 
failure occurred and ending at the Default Valuation Time, purchased, whether by 
way of a repurchase transaction, buy and sell back transaction or otherwise. 
Securities forming part of the same issue and being of an identical type and 
description as those Purchased Securities or Equivalent Securities, the affected party 
shall, to the extent that it does not fall within paragraph 10(e), treat the cost of such 
purchase (including all Transaction Costs) as the Default Market Value of those 
Securities; 
(ii) 
in calculating the Default Market Value, Transaction Costs incurred in connection 
with a purchase of Securities under paragraph I 0(eXiXA) (aa) or (bb) shall include

party is required to make with the Bank of Italy at the greater of the Pricing 
Rate for the relevant Transaction and EURIBOR (on a 360 day basis unless 
otherwise agreed by the parties to the Transaction) which shall be payable 
by the other party to the affected party. 
(b) 
If Buyer fails to deliver Equivalent Securities to Seller on the applicable Repurchase Date, Seller 
may by written notice to the other party, elect to adjust the Transaction in accordance with 
subparagraph (c) below. 
(c) 
The adjustment of a Transaction (the "Original Transaction") under this subparagraph shall be 
effected as follows. The Original Transaction shall be terminated on the Repurchase Date for the 
Original Transaction and the parties shall be deemed to enter into a new Transaction (the 
"Replacement Transaction") in accordance with the following provisions-
(I) 
the Purchase Date under the Replacement Transaction shall be the Repurchase Date 
under the Original Transaction; 
(ii) 
the Purchased Securities under the Replacement Transaction shall be Securities 
equivalent to the Purchased Securities under the Original Transaction; 
(iii) 
the Purchase Price under the Replacement Transaction shall, unless otherwise agreed, 
be the Market Value of the Purchased Securities for that Transaction on the Purchase 
Date for the Replacement Transaction as determined by Seller; 
(iv)

Transaction shall, unless otherwise agreed, be identical to those of the Original 
Transaction; and

and the payment of the Purchase Price under the Replacement Transaction shall be 
set off against their obligations with respect to the delivery of Equivalent Securities 
and payment of the Repurchase Price under the Original Transaction and accordingly 
only a net cash sum shall be paid by one party to the other. If such net sum is payable 
by Seller to Buyer, that sum shall be payable on the Repurchase Date under the 
Replacement Transaction.

If on the Repurchase Date for any Transaction Buyer delivers to Seller part only of the Equivalent 
Securities which it should have delivered (the "Delivered Securities" and the part of the 
Equivalent Securities which Buyer has failed to deliver being the "Undelivered Securities") Seller 
shall not be obliged to accept delivery of the Delivered Securities but instead may elect to 
terminate that Transaction in accordance with paragraph 10(hXiii) of the AgreementS in.which
