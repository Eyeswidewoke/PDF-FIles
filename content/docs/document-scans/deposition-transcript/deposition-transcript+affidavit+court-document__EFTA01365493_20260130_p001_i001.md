ARTICLE XIII 
HOLDERS' RELATIONS 
Section 13.1. Subordination.
(a) 
Anything in this Indenture or the Securities to the contrary notwithstanding, the 
Issuer and the Holders of each Lower Ranking Class agree for the benefit of the Holders of each 
Higher Ranking Class that such Lower Ranking Classes and the Issuer's rights in and to the 
Collateral (the "Subordinate Interests") shall be subordinate and junior to each Higher Ranking 
Class to the extent and in the manner set forth in this Indenture including, without limitation, as 
set forth in Section 11.1 and as hereinafter provided. If any Event of Default has occurred and 
has not been cured or waived and acceleration occurs in accordance with Article V, including, 
without limitation, as a result of an Event of Default specified in Section 5.1(f) or (g), each 
Higher Ranking Class (including any accrued but unpaid interest thereon) shall be paid in MI in 
cash or, to the extent the Controlling Party consents, other than in cash, before any further 
payment or distribution is made on account of the Subordinate Interests. 
(b) 
In the event that notwithstanding the provisions of this Indenture, any Holder of 
any of the respective Subordinate Interests shall have received any payment or distribution in 
respect of such Subordinate Interests contrary to the provisions of this Indenture, then, unless and 
until each Higher Ranking Class shall have been paid in full in cash (or, to the extent the 
Controlling Party or a Majority of the Lower Ranking Classes consent, other than in cash) in 
accordance with this Indenture, such payment or distribution shall be received and held in trust 
for the benefit of, and shall forthwith be paid over and delivered to, the Trustee, which shall pay 
and deliver the same to the Holders of the Higher Ranking Classes in accordance with this 
Indenture; provided, however, that, if any such payment or distribution is made other than in 
cash, it shall be held by the Trustee as part of the Collateral, and subject in all respects to the 
provisions of this Indenture, including, without limitation, this Section 13.1. 
(c) 
Each Holder of Subordinate Interests agrees with all Holders of each Higher 
Ranking Class that such Holder of Subordinate Interests shall not demand, accept, or receive any 
payment or distribution in respect of such Subordinate Interests in violation of the provisions of 
this Indenture including, without limitation, this Section 13.1; provided, however, that after such 
Higher Ranking Classes have been paid in full, the Holders of Subordinate Interests shall be fully 
subrogated to the rights of the Holders of such Higher Ranking Classes. Nothing in this 
Section 13.1 shall affect the obligation of the Issuer to pay Holders of Subordinate Interests. 
Section 13.2. Standard of Conduct. 
In exercising any of its or their Voting Rights, subject to the terms and conditions of the 
Indenture, including, without limitation, Section 5.9, a Holder shall not have any obligation or 
duty to any Person or to consider or take into account the interests of any Person and shall not be 
liable to any Person for any action taken by it or them or at its or their direction or any failure by 
it or them to act or to direct that an action be taken, without regard to whether such action or 
inaction benefits or adversely affects any Holder, the Issuer, or any other Person, except for any 
liability to which such Holder may be subject to the extent the same results from such Holder's
