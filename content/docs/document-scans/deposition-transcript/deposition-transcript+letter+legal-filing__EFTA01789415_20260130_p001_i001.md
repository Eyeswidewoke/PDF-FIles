Re: labels 
1 if I had programmed your=values you would be far ahead of where you are. In fact I failed to reprogr=m them . 2 it was 
not passive aggressive it was only aggressive , 3 your fo=us and understanding of consequences has not changed ,and I 
only want good t=ings for you and Believe you would be better in another city.i have been co=sistent on that fact but 
like the vast majority of things , i believe=i fully expect you will ignore my best advice .. 4 I have no intenti=n of sharing

Well, that was unnecessarily harsh.. 
1. It is a fact that the time I spent with you will=make my future dating difficult, but that is mostly a result of you 
exposing me to your unusual lifestyle and reprogramming all my values, priorities and sense of right and wrong, when 
you started dating me as a teenager. I was a willing participant, so don't think I am blaming you for it or using it as a= 
excuse. I'm just stating a fact. 
Because of you I ha=e come to not only tolerate, but genuinely prefer and seek a lifestyle that includes other 
girls and an 'open•=804 relationship... If you call that selfish, jealous or small-minded, I don't know what=to say. It's 
true this may be difficult to find but it is for the opposite r=asons than those you listed. 
2. Love is a now a label? You had no problem Q=98labeling' your relationships since I met you. Your sudden 
artificial refusal to have an adu=t conversation and use common English words because you don't want to Q=80•put 
labels' on things, supports your stubbornness more than your open-mi=ded and unconventional views about 
relationships. 
Why would you make a passive-aggressive comment lik= "Glad to s=e your reaction is not based on my being 
happy or not", and then refuse to answer the q=estion. I have no idea if you are happy. I want you to be. But judging by 
your random spurts of anger and obsessive focus on the negative detail while overlooking=the vast positive (in people, 
work, design and everyday life), I don't e=en dare to venture a guess. I really hope you ARE happy and I hope it lasts. I 
would also hope that when you are d=ne with this one, you don't blame it on the poor girl's esel=ishness' and 'jealousy' 
but maybe take a closer look in the mirror. I promise that if you don'= address your negativity and aggressive mood 
swings, you are going to have a very har= time, and so is she. When that happens, I won't say I told you so, l=ke you do. I 
just hope you take something from it. I wish you well.<=div> 
Par=on my honesty. 
PS: I hope you realize our communications are confi=ential and any information I share with you is not to be 
disclosed to any person, w=th or without a label.
