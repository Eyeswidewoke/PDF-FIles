Privet!) Hahah...it was very cute about your 'Well, Privet then'!:)=)lol. I can 
imagine the woman's expression at that moment!)) You see, =ometimes it's very useful to know Russian:) If you ever see 
her again =ay 'kak pozhivaete?' ( it's like 'how are you?'), I gu=ss she would be shocked:) 
Oh, 17 or 18 degrees Celsius...we can only dream about such a temperature 
n=w, it's +6-+8 here during last days! so cold...( 
Yes, most of our c=urches are similar to you parent's church, there are 
Protestant cathed=als here as well, but not so many. Your choir and your church, is it the s=me place, or your choir 
belongs to another church? Six grammy awards! Soun=s really imposing! yeah, that's great you sing there! 
Concerning=me, singing in my church choir...wow! hahaha...you kidding! No, if only da=cing!:)) 
To be honest, I attend a church not very often, sometimes I just feel that = need 
it and then I go. But in spite of I'm an Orthodox, last time I p=efer to attend Catholic church, I just feel more comfortable 
there, I don&=39;t know why, may be it's wrong, but I think it doesn't matter. Since I've been back I was going to 
continue working as a dental assist=nt at one dental center here, I've been working there before summer fo= part-time, 
but my schedule is different now, so I've no time to combi=e it with my studies. I relly have to learn more English, cause 
if I=wanna come to US and to find a job I must speak much better. 
How was your friend's birthday party? come on, that's great you'=ve got no rest 
because of the parties!:) but...yes, there are times when w= are full of everything and just need some rest and 
calmness... 
Sorryl=remy, I must not write it, but...I miss you.

Hi Karina, good to hear from you. It was kind of funny, that other day I wa= 
riding up to my apartment in the elevator and a woman was coming back fro= a job. I said 'hello' to her and she looked 
at me with a funny fa=e. Then she said,' I, Russian', 'Don't speak English'=..so I smiled and said, 'Well, Privet then'. She 
looked surprised =nd said it back to me. I felt like I was in Russia at that very moment! :►=C2Q I thought you would 
appreciate that story. 
It is getting colder here too, it is probably about 17 or 18 degrees Ce=sius. Hot 
tea and a good book sounds good right about now too. Unfortunate=y, I have to go to a friends birthday party...no rest 
for someone who need= it!! 
That's very cool that you are doing some real hands-on work cleanin= teeth. 
I do sing in my church choir...(http://brooklyntabernade.org/choi=/ 
chttp://brooklyn=abernacle.org/choir/> ) They have one six grammy awards for their music. I'm very=happy to be in 
this choir. Unfortunately, I will have to leave the choir s=on because I have to focus on finishing my studies. But I'm very 
activ= in other things at my church too such as the young adult group and the ch=ldren's group. I'm sure your choir is 
much more strict. You should=sing in your church choir too! :) Here is my family's church bac= home in Wichita, Ks. 
(http://www.stgeorgecathedral.net/) Is it similar to yours?=br>
