immigration policies. The hundreds of planned changes could take months or years to 
implement. Some pro-immigrant activists favored Mayorkas for the DHS role." Still, USA Today 
(11/23, Jansen, 10.31M) says that immigration "didn't come up much on the campaign trail, so 
it's not clear how much Biden will change Trump's policies." 
Bloomberg (11/23, Strohm, 4.73M) adds that the Biden transition team's "announcement 
on Monday didn't say who his picks for other key agencies will be, including secretary of 
defense or CIA director. Some names floated for those jobs include former Under Secretary of 
Defense Michele Flournoy and former deputy CIA Director Michael Morrell." 
Finally, Politico (11/23, Bender, Meyer, 4.29M) reports that some of the selections come 
from the firm WestExec Avisors, which was founded by Blinken and at which Haines was once 
one of its former principals. 
Sources Say Yellen Is Favorite For Biden Treasury Secretary. Citing unnamed 
sources, the Wall Street Journal (11/23, Al, Timiraos, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) reports 
on its front page that Biden will choose former Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen as 
Treasury secretary. On ABC World News TonightVi (11/23, story 5, 2:15, Muir, 7.67M), Chief 
Global Affairs Correspondent Martha Raddatz said that if Yellen is confirmed, she "would be the 
first woman ever to serve as Treasury Secretary, a remarkable first given that she would 
succeed 75 men who have filled the position and more important than ever during this critical 
period in the pandemic economy." 
Reuters (11/23, Lawder, Hunnicutt) says Yellen is "an experienced policymaker respected 
by Congress, international finance officials, progressives and business interests alike." The AP 
(11/23, Rugaber, Balsamo) similarly reports that Yellen is "widely admired in the financial 
world," and Bloomberg (11/23, Greifeld, Leach, 4.73M) says the reports of her selection "landed 
gently on Wall Street," as "traders intensely familiar with the former Federal Reserve chair 
cheered the pick in anticipation of her working well with the central bank to help the economy 
bounce back from the pandemic." The New York Times (11/23, Al, Smialek, 18.61M) reports on 
its front page that while Yellen "is not the type of firebrand nominee some progressives might 
have hoped for — she has warned that the United States is borrowing too much money, a fact 
that some liberals count against her — she has paid consistent, careful attention to inequality 
and labor market outcomes, even when doing so earned her backlash from lawmakers." 
Reuters (11/23, Shalal) reports Institute of International Finance President and CEO Tim 
Adam on Monday said, "Janet Yellen is an extraordinary choice for Treasury Secretary, and 
should be swiftly confirmed by the Senate." Adam added, "She is a world class economist and 
dedicated public servant, and will be a trusted, steady, and pragmatic hand on the helm as the 
U.S. navigates the economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic." In an editorial, the Wall 
Street Journal (11/23, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) says that if Biden does select Yellen for 
Treasury Secretary, she is likely to have more extensive influence than her recent predecessors. 
The Journal says lawmakers should focus the confirmation hearings on her position on federal 
debt. 
US Files New Charges Against Florida Navy Officer. 
The Florida Times-Union (11/23, Patterson, 203K) reports, "Prosecutors have stopped trying to 
prove that an indicted Jacksonville Navy officer was part of a Chinese CEO's smuggling 
conspiracy, but have expanded firearms charges tied to his relationship with the CEO." Lt. Fan 
Yang "was the subject last week of a new indictment replacing one filed last year that charged 
him in an export conspiracy alongside his wife and two Chinese business people. The three co-
defendants have already pleaded guilty, leaving only Yang, who had been assigned to Naval Air 
Station Jacksonville before being jailed last year, scheduled for trial in March." US Magistrate 
James Klindt "has scheduled an arraignment on the new set of charges, called a superseding 
indictment, for Dec. 3. The new indictment simplifies the case against Yang, 35," charging him 
"with twice buying handguns in his name that were really for the CEO's use and lying on a 
security review to hide the extent of his connection to the business executive."
