was advised in no uncertain terms-to having nothing to do with you, and not to speak or email you, and if I did,=l would 
cause more problems to both You and The Duke and myself. So I shut do=n and ran away. I was broken and lost. So 
please understand, as I do about yo=, that I ws broken and not the strong person you know, and I got completely 
obliterated too, and I saw all my childrens work etc disappearing.. I shut =own and everyone out. I was frightened. The 
Palace system is frightening, and e=ch step I turned or each action was wrong and I did not want to hurt Andrew on= 
more time. 
So Jeffrey, this email is sent with a hope you accept, and understand a lit=le of my side too. 
We are and have both been in the firing line, both blamed for stuff we have=not done, this front line attack has 
been like this for me for 22 years. You wo=ld have thought I was thick skinned enough to handle it. I know there are 2 
si=es to every story, I have heard yours, please hear mine. 
I am glad you spoke to James, and James made you aware from the British med=a standpoint, that all this 
hellaciousness had been going on many days BEFORE=my statement. And I was instructed to act with the uptmost 
speed, from most si=es, if I was to have any chance at all holding onto my career as a childrens bo=k author etc and a 
childrens philanthropist, and I got terrified. I should ha=e taken advice from you too, before speaking to Geordie, and 
taken a day or t=o to think of the ramifications of my actions, but for the reasons as stated above, I was in over riding 
fear. I am sorry. I just did not know what or w=ere to turn. 
I know James can send you every single article from the days, weeks, leadin= up to that Monday of the 
statement from the endless horrendous pages written a=out You and The Duke. So you can see why I became paralysed. 
I know you and James are going to work on a solution. 
In the meantime, I write this from the truth of my heart.
