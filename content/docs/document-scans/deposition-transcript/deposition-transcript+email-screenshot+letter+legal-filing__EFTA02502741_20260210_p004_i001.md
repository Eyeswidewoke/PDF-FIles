I've withheld writing because it is, frankly, not easy. The conce=ns you express about my life are completely groundless. 
There is in fact one problem in my life, one and only one: your insistence on pursuing this matter instead of resolving it 
easily, as I have suggested. The one and only problem. 
Furthermore, your picture of what happened in the past, whatever its source= is almost completely false. I've written to 
you in detail about w=at did happen. You haven't yet responded, simply ignoring the detail=d account I gave. I don't 
understand that. I'll go throug= it again and hope that this will finish the matter. Furthermore, you will find in due 
course that there has been serious wrongdoing, much more than I told you about in the letters I have sent before, some 
repeated below. 
Easier to add comments below. I also think it would be useful to make more explicit comments about your earlier letter, 
and a few other things. 
First, an area of agreement. Just as you are disturbed, similarly all of this is disturbing to me, extremely so. It's the one 
serio=sly -- very seriously -- dark spot on the new lives that Valeria and I are shaping for ourselves, and I would therefore 
like to get it over with and resolved as soon as possible. As I wrote, I cannot understan= why you are bringing any of 
these things up, and I think it would be very good to make everything clear, and keep nothing hidden or implicit. 
Second, it's clear that we are not communicating. The reason is c=ear: I write you long and detailed letters explaining 
the facts, and you complet=ly ignore the letters, not responding to anything I wrote. Not once.Q=A0 I presume that 
includes the letter I wrote about my father, which you ignor=d, along with all the others. When I ask specific questions, 
you do not respond. I've repeatedly asked you for the sources of your be=iefs, but you have never told me, so I can only 
guess. To take the most recent case, I have asked several times where you received the information about the sale of 
our Cambridge apartment (incorrect information, as I wrote) and the purchase of our Tucson house -- and also, why you 
even wante= to look into the matter, which, frankly, seems to me very strange. 
Then come the areas of disagreement, which I hope we can iron out quickly and expeditiously so that we can pick up the 
warm and close relations that we always had, and that I'd always treasured.

Dear Doddoy, 
We really hesitated to write our long letter to you last month. We only finally decided to write it because you insisted so 
many times that we do so. We think, and have thought for a long time, that we need to sit down face-to-face and work 
through our very substantial differences with you in how we understand your estate plan, financial history, and current 
situation. But after you asked us so many times in December to discuss it by e-mail, we decided to give that a try. We 
definitely didn't intend to be legalistic and adversarial, and we really regret th=t that's how you found our writing. We 
meant our letter as a heartfelt ex=lanation of our perspective on the issues and how we want to help you understand 
the problem and fix it. But it doesn't sound like you've unde=stood what we were trying to explain and express. This 
strongly confirms our feeling that e-mail is not a useful way for us to communicate about these issues. 
I understood very well, and responded, pointing out that the information you have received from some source -- which 
you do not identify, despite repeated requests -- is flatly wrong. In the letter I wrote to you, to which this one was
