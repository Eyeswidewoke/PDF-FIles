You have raised the issue of my responsibility to have stopped our mother from using the trust funds as 
she saw fit for her own care and that I am liable for some of the spent funds. The trust said mother, 
as co-trustee, could spend the funds on her own care as she saw fit. Therefore, it seems obvious that 
I am not liable to return any funds to the trust since you are aware that mother wrote all the checks on 
the trust account.

Peggy, 
I have been working with a lawyer and accountant to finalize mothers estate and trust, but as you can 
imagine these things are always more complicated than they seem. As you know the Estate tax 
return was filed and we are working on finalizing the trust accounting and estate accounting so that 
we can agree on the distribution and finish this up.

As I stated we are in the process of providing a trust accounting. I am hoping that we can reduce the 
significant accounting fees by my providing an informal accounting. If we are able to agree based 
upon that, then we can avoid the accounting fees required to go further back and potential litigation 
costs that will only deplete our funds. 
We are similarly making an informal estate accounting that should let us avoid the costs associated 
with a formal accounting. 
One final point. The loan noted in mothers will was not a deathbed loan. In December 2010, when we 
thought mother was cancer free and she was living in Alpine, she decided on her own to update her 
will and change lawyers from Seymour Levine to a New Jersey lawyer. I had no knowledge of this, 
and I have never met or spoken to this lawyer. What I assumed she did was update her affairs, and 
account for something that was done several years earlier. I received no money, and your 
characterization of a death bed loan was very disappointing, besides being untrue.
