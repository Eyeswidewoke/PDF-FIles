Subject: Re: Thanks 
when treasures are "re discovered" . ( not sure the re is appropriate ). it needs to be evaluated ( here you can use "re" ). 
it requires close examination to ascertain its new value. the auction house , is a nice way of determing it. and a long way 
on its path to recognition. 
On Mon, Mar 25, 2013 at 1:45 AM, President -:
vrote: 
I am finally home. 
First, let me wish you a happy passover; second, thanks for the candor and the friendship. So you won't mind if I push 
back. 
There are, as I can see it, three issues and if each can be addressed, with a third round of checking, you might think 
differently. I have had Lynne send on names. 
1) The repertoire. The works we do are worth doing, sometimes because a masterpiece is unearthed, and sometimes, 
something good but influential and worth hearing has been revived, and and sometimes as a foil from history against 
which we measure our so called greatest hits. In all cases, the works have to be performed and experienced and 
therefore performed. And we have a loyal following in the hall and on the internet. So something is working. 
2) The format of the concerts is a curated one that links music with literature, politics, history--a necessary part of what 
music is. In that sense the ASO is totally unique. 
3) Botstein and the ASO. The truth is that I have been such a thorn of the side of critics, conductors and managers that I 
am not surprised at what you found. But you will find support and real support within the profession. Pardon the 
expression but I have not gotten medals and awards for anything but my work in music. I just got the Bruckner Medal 
this month (the other recipients have been Toscanini and Walter, among others). And I got the same Austrian Cross for 
contributions to music as Sir Simon Rattle--the same year. I hate that stuff, but there it is. 
On 1--again think of Nabokov, whose favorite Russian poets were often obscure figures derided by all the other critics. 
He stood alone. The Marschner is beautiful opera and a crucial link between Beethoven and Wagner. So I stand in the 
Quixotic defense of works that are worth it--even if they are not as good as others. Music does not follow Darwinian 
patterns (a longer discussion). It is not science. That is, if i may say so, a commonplace; the idea that history is a judge 
that seems right but is not. One of the greatest plays was forgotten after the writer died and rediscovered in the 1920$, 
100 years later--Woyzeck. That is just one example. 
As to 2, that is one way to build an audience, by linking music to other forms of life--to pretentiously paraphrase 
Wittgenstein. 
And to No 3) I am still haunted by early criticisms by angry competitors and idiot ignorant critics who hated my ideas and 
the fact that I was an outsider with another career in scholarship and education. 
That being said, why not give me one last shot at proving the majority wrong. I have been at it for nearly 25 years, and in 
the next five, if there can be no measured improvement on the execution front--then that will be that. But 120,000 sales 
and a Grammy nomination for a rare work--a Popov symphony from the 19305,--and more than 20 years of some real 
success (we have generated a body of new scholarship in music history--is cause enough to inspire you to give us help. 
This is my plea. But I am not Moses, and if there were a God, he would not be on my side. (Another reason to help). 
I greatly cherish this new friendship and I have real admiration for how you go about doing things----tough as it is often I 
truly enjoy the argument. But this time I and not your preliminary findings and researchers--am right. Given the
