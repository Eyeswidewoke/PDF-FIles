by everyone on both sides of the aisle. There is no possible justification to remove him from 
office." 
Bloomberg (11/12, Courtney, Sebenius, 4.73M) reports that House Homeland Security 
Committee Chairperson Bennie Thompson (D-MS) said, "There are rumors the president may 
be cleaning house at CISA, with one high-level official reportedly asked to resign already. This 
is dangerous." Sen. Angus King (I-ME), co-chair of the US Cyberspace Solarium Commission, 
"called Krebs' work with states on election security `amazing' in a recent press briefing with 
reporters." King said, "The state infrastructure, the registration rolls, the election rolls, voting 
machines, all of that, is much better, much stronger, much more resilient than it was four years 
ago." 
The Hill (11/12, Chalfant, 2.98M) reports, "Krebs's potential ouster would leave a 
tremendous leadership vacuum at DHS and would leave the top government cybersecurity role 
vacant at a critical moment." If he is "forced to step down, his role would likely be filled by CISA 
Deputy Director Matthew Travis, who has served in the deputy director position since 2018." 
Ware, as well as Valerie Boyd, another DHS official, "were forced to resign due to pressure from 
the White House," according to reporting by CNN. 
Politico (11/12, Geller, Bertrand, 4.29M) reports that CISA "has been at the forefront of 
federal efforts to protect U.S. elections from foreign hacking and interference, and his efforts 
have drawn praise from people in both parties." Krebs' ouster "could make him the latest 
national security leader to lose his job amid a post-election purge that has already forced out 
Defense Secretary Mark Esper and other top Pentagon officials." An unnamed official said the 
White House "has wanted to fire Krebs for a while. ... From what I've heard from the [White 
House], they've considered removing him before."

Washington Times (11/12, Blake, 492K), and Federal News Network (11/12, Miller, 220). 
Commerce Department Will Delay Enforcement Of TikTok Shutdown Order. 
The Wall Street Journal (11/12, Maher, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) reports the Commerce 
Department said Thursday it will not enforce an order that would have effectively shut down 
TikTok by prohibiting US companies from offering it as a mobile app and offering web-hosting 
service for the company. Citing a preliminary injunction against the shutdown last month from 
US District Judge Wendy Beetlestone in Philadelphia, the Department said the order will not 
take effect "pending further legal developments." 
The New York Times (11/12, McCabe, 18.61M) reports that the restrictions were 
announced "in September under an executive order signed by President Trump targeting TikTok 
and WeChat." App stores "would not have been able to offer TikTok, and American companies 
would have been forbidden from hosting data for the service." The Commerce Department "had 
indicated that it would apply the restrictions only to the app if ByteDance, TikTok's Chinese 
owner, were unable to sell its interest in the product." On Tuesday, the agency "said that the 
order `has been enjoined, and will not go into effect, pending further legal developments.' 
The Washington Post (11/12, Riley, 14.2M) reports that TikTok is "waiting on a federal 
judge to grant a 30-day extension on the sale as it awaits a government green light on the deal 
it proposed to set up a new company with investment from Oracle and Walmart." If a ruling is 
not issued, the "presidential election results could leave the company with more options." 
CNBC (11/12, Sherman, 3.62M) reports, "The Commerce Department order doesn't 
address the CFIUS mandate demanding TikTok sell its U.S. assets," but "reaffirms TikTok can 
continue to operate in the U.S." The company "continues to wait for more government guidance 
about how to proceed with its minority stake sale." President Trump agreed to the sale of 20% 
of TikTok Global to Walmart and Oracle in August, but "the transaction never got the approval 
of the Chinese government, and Trump administration officials have gone silent on their 
demands in the weeks leading up to the election."
