the far side of the living. He went through his messages and discovered he had a potentially 
serious problem with one of his BlackBerry cell phones—which he called his IMF BlackBerry. 
This was the phone he used to send and receive texts and e-mails—including for both personal 
and IMF business. According to sources who are close to DSK, he had received a text message 
that morning from Paris from a friend. She warned DSK that at least one private e-mail he had 
recently sent from his BlackBerry to his wife, Anne Sinclair, had been read by his political foes. It 
is unclear how his foes might have received this e-mail, but if it had come from his IMF 
BlackBerry, he had reason to suspect he might be under electronic surveillance in New York. 
Since he had taken measures to protect his phone a month earlier, the warning that his 
BlackBerry might have been hacked was all the more alarming. At 10:07 AM he called his wife 
in Paris on his IMF BlackBerry, and in a conversation that lasted about six minutes told her he had 
a big problem. He asked her to contact a friend, Stephane Fouks, who could come to his home on 
the Place des Vosges and who could arrange to have both his BlackBeny and iPad examined by 
one or more expert in such matters. 
He had no time to do anything about it that morning. He had scheduled an early lunch with 
his twenty-six-year-old daughter Camille, who wanted to introduce him to her new boyfriend. 
After that, he had to get to JFK Airport in time to catch his 4:40 PM Air France flight to Paris. 
He had finished packing his suitcase at around noon, according to his own account, and then 
took a shower in the bathroom, which is connected to the bedroom in the suite by an interior 
corridor. Just minutes later there were multiple entries his suite. 
The first entry was at 12:05, according to the hotel's electronic key swipe records (which are 
accurate only to the nearest minute.) The key belonged to Syad Hague, a room service waiter. 
According to his police statement, he had come to the suite to remove DSK's breakfast dishes. If 
so, he turned left on entering the suite and proceeded through the living rook to the dining room, 
where he would collect the breakfast dishes on his cart. (See Diagram below.) 
It is not clear how long he spent in the suite or when he left since the electronic key system only 
records entries, not exits. 
The second entry came only about a minute later at 12:06 PM. This key belonged to a hotel 
maid, Nafissatou Diallo. She was a thirty-two-year-old immigrant from Guinea. Ordinarily, 
cleaning personnel do not enter a room to clean when a guest is still in it. The president suite, 
however, is a large 4 room apartment so she may not have known he was in the suite when she 
entered. If her purpose was to clean the suite, she would need the cleaning equipment on her cart. 
But, according to her own testimony, her cart was locked in room 2820. According to hotel 
records the guest had checked out at 11:36 AM She then left the suite and the door locked 
behind her. The third entry was also by Diallo. It was recorded at 12:06 PM, so she had spent 
very little time in the hall. We do not know why she returned but when she did she still lacked her 
cleaning equipment. At this time, depending on whether or not the room service waiter had yet 
exited, there was either one or two staff in the presidential suite. 
Shortly after her second entry she encountered DSK. What followed, and where it happened, is 
a matter of dispute but there is no doubt about the sexual nature of the encounter. The DNA 
evidence found just a few feet outside the bathroom door showed a combination of her saliva 
mixed with his semen. Nor did he deny a sexual contact had taken place. The prosecutors 
determined that this engagement, whether forced or not, was "hurried" because DSK's phone 
records show that by 12:13 PM he was speaking to his daughter on his IMF BlackBerry— a call 
lasting for thirty-six seconds. Since it was not a call that Diallo witnessed, according to her own
