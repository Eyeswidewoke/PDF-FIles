Mr Diamond's departure and the LIBOR-fixing scandal will mark the start=of a new phase in the politics of the 
banking crisis in Britain. The sugge=tion that traders at Barclays and other banks were manipulating what is ultimately a 
key public benchmark fo= pricing financial products compounds a run of mis-selling and tax plannin= controversies. With 
a Parliamentary enquiry now to take place on the LIBO= issue in the UK, and the issue likely to ripple across other 
jurisdictions and produce both litigation an= possible prosecutions, banks in the UK are confronted with new levels of 
=olitical and public disdain. The fact that the Bank of England's own con=uct remains subject to question in some aspects 
of the LIBOR scandal will not deflect from this. 
It is safe to assume that the setting of LIBOR will now be moved into t=e remit of the UK financial regulator. 
Brussels will tighten market abuse =ules to apply criminal sanctions to tampering with indices like LIBOR. But the most 
significant political a=d regulatory outcome from these events will be to renew the debate about u=iversal banking. 
Where this debate has to this point focused on scale, imp=icit subsidy and systemic risk, it will now focus on culture, 
personal character and contamination from the values of the trading floor to the rest of a=banking institution. Because 
these things cannot be regulated, the probability is that politicians will=focus on their political proxies, especially pay. 
The return of Vic=ers 
The link between what has happened at Barclays and the un=versal banking argument is trust. Preserving the 
universal bank model reli=s on public trust that the core retail functions of a bank and its trading=activities can be 
properly and completely segregated. The UK Independent Commission on Banking chaired by Sir John V=ckers proposed 
in 2011 that they could be preserved in a single institutio= but in separate entities, with the retail functions ringfenced 
with their=own higher capital levels. The Vickers Commission recommended that all derivatives services should be kep= 
outside this ringfence. 
The UK government accepted the argument that retail banks=should be able to maintain some simple 
derivatives functions such as produ=ts for hedging currency risk for business clients. The Barclays experience=is already 
leading politicians and commentators in the UK to argue that simple derivatives may be an oxymoron= Trying to define 
them may be a futile exercise, and one that will inevita=ly be gamed by banks. 
The UK government shows some reluctance to revisit its in=erpretation of the Vickers proposals. But if the 
British Parliamentary enq=iry into the LIBOR issue now concludes that the government has erred on th= side of trusting 
banks, then the pressure for an outcome closer to the original Vickers recommendation, to =e written into next year's 
Banking Act, will be intense. 
The universal banking debate will take another serious tw=st if the new leadership of Barclays ultimately decides 
to break the bank =p into a retail bank and an investment bank and broker/dealer. As extreme =s this sounds, the 
intangible costs in political and regulatory animus Barclays now attracts could suggest tha= a clean break makes sense. 
An arrangement that gave existing shareholders=a stake in both new institutions might be acceptable. 
Barclays would no doubt sell such a split as a smart comm=rcial move. But the political and regulatory subtext 
would be to undermine=the case that such banking agglomerations are both necessary and useful. A=though the French 
and German commitment to their own universal banking systems is very strong, such a split would =ertainly empower 
critics of the universal banking model in the EU and the =S. The Liikanen Group inquiry is due to report to the European 
Commission =n bank structure later this year. The Commission itself is then expected to issue its own recommendations 
on=bank structure. Both will certainly draw on the Barclays experience.
