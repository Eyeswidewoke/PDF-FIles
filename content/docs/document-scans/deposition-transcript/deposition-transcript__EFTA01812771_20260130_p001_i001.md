A couple of my favourites are as follows; 
=ails 
me to say she is having trouble with her Portuguese domestics and as I "have a way with staff" 
would I mind dropping in to see them, which I do a couple of days later. 
I forget their names, but lets call them Jose and Pauline. I ask Jose what the matter is. He replies and I 
quote as near verbatim as i can recall; 
"Sir, its not that I mind Miss 
ing at me. its not that I mind Miss 
creaming at me in front 
of my wife, its not that I mind M 
lapping me, its not that I mind her slapping me in from of my wife, 
its just that I cannot accept being slapped in the street" !!! 
Another good one was when I took Isabel to Bali, Indonesia 15 yrs ago. Whilst there she did a lot of 
shopping of local artifacts and hand crafts, including ordering a large bolt of fabric specially woven to her 
instructions. She asked Ugo Gerasati, the Brazilian socialite who had a fabricshop out there at the time 
specialising in Balinese batiquesetc. how he proposed sending this to her once completed, as she had no 
intention whatsoever of being paying outrageous postage and packing charges. He told her that he had an 
excellent solution, which would involve no costs at all. He would ask the next English customer who 
happened to be in the shop when the fabric was ready, if they would mind taking it with them back to 
London. Quite a favour to ask of anyone especially when this bolt was the size of a large packing case. 
In any event the late Mary Howard (Lord Patrick Howard's charming wife) dropped by a few weeks later to 
visit Ugo and was tasked with taking this huge package to London which she readily agreed to do. 
On arrival in London, the first thing she did was to call Isabel whom she had never met. She did this promptly 
morning, 
at 9:00Am in the morning, not a good time for Isabel who is a night owl and generally on 
oes to sleep 
around 6 and then wakes around lunchtime. The result of this call, which of course woke 
was for her 
to scream at Mary "Do you know what time this is? Do you think this is an office?" To whicMary replied, 
somewhat startled at the hostility of this reaction, " I was calling to let you know I have brought your fabric 
back from Bali. et 
remotely molified, cursed her for waking her up and added as an aside "Well 
drop it off this afternoon at 4:00pm" and then slammed down the phone without so much as good bye. 
Mary, somewhat aghast by this behaviour, generous to the extreme, put it down to a bad night and that 
aftemoon turned up at 
ith the huge parcel. She rang the door and waited and waited and 
waited and final) 
ened the door on the chain and asked who she was. "I am Mary Howard with 
your fabric from Bali". "Oh" snaps Isabel "You are that wretched woman who woke my so inconsiderately 
this moming" with that she opens the door, grabs the package and the slams it shut in Mary's face. 
Mary now finally cracks and bursts into tears on Isabel's doostep and calls her best friend Lynn Guinness to 
tell iichat has happened. Lynn, quite rightly outraged by this behaviour, calls me and tells me to speak to 
mediatly. 
By the time I get the message and call Isabel, its her "good time of day" around 6:30pm. I call her and she 
answers in a very friendly way and so I ask her if the name Mary Howard rings a bell. "Should it?" she replies 
quick as a flash. "Yes" I say "It bloody well shouldm since she had at great inconvenience hauled a large 
package half way around the world only to be yelled at for her trouble". 
hought for a second before 
wearliy replying "Well she's lead a sheltered life" and that was that. I lift the term rank ingratitude onto a 
different plane altogether.
