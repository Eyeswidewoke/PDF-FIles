Key Operating Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
We collect and analyze operating and financial data to evaluate the health of our business, allocate our resources, and 
assess our performance. In addition to revenue, net (loss) income, and other results under generally accepted accounting principles 
(GAAP), the following table sets forth key operating metrics and non-GAAP financial measures we use to evaluate our business. 
Each of these metrics and measures excludes the effect of our payment processing agreement with Starbucks. We do not intend to 
renew our payment processing agreement with Starbucks when it expires in the third quarter of 2016, and we recently amended 
the agreement to eliminate the exclusivity provision in order to permit Starbucks to begin transitioning to another payment 
processor starting October 1, 2015. Under the amendment, Starbucks also agreed to pay increased processing rates to us for as 
long as they continue to process transactions with us. Starbucks has announced that it will transition to another payment processor 
and will cease using our payment processing services altogether prior to the scheduled expiration of the agreement in the third 
quarter of 2016. As a result, we believe it is useful to exclude Starbucks activity to clearly show the impact Starbucks has had on 
our financial results historically, to provide insight into the impact of the termination of the Starbucks agreement on our revenues 
going forward, to facilitate period-to-period comparisons of our business, and to facilitate comparisons of our performance to that of 
other payment processors. Our agreements with other sellers generally provide both those sellers and us the unilateral right to 
terminate such agreements at any time, without fine or penalty. Furthermore, we generally do not enter into long-term contractual 
agreements with sellers.

Gross Payment Volume (GPV) 
We define GPV as the total dollar amount of all card payments processed by sellers using Square. net of refunds. GPV 
excludes card payments processed for Starbucks. Additionally, GPV excludes activity related to our Square Cash peer-to-peer 
payments service.

Adjusted Revenue 
Adjusted Revenue is a non-GAAP financial measure that we define as our total net revenue less transaction costs, adjusted 
to eliminate the effect of activity under our payment processing agreement with Starbucks. As described above, Starbucks has 
announced that it will transition to another payment processor and will cease using our payment processing services altogether, 
and we believe that providing Adjusted Revenue metrics that exclude the impact of our agreement with Starbucks is useful to 
investors. 
We believe it is useful to exclude transaction costs from Adjusted Revenue as this is a primary metric used by management 
to measure our business performance, and it affords greater comparability to other payments processing companies. Substantially 
all of the transaction costs excluded from Adjusted Revenue are interchange fees set by payment card networks and are paid to 
card issuers, with the remainder of such transaction costs consisting of assessment fees paid to payment card networks, fees paid 
to third-party payment processors, and bank settlement fees. While some payment processors present their revenue in a similar 
fashion to us, others present their revenue net of transaction costs because they pass through these costs directly to their sellers. 
Under our standard pricing model, we do not pass through these costs directly to our sellers. 
Adjusted Revenue has limitations as a financial measure, should be considered as supplemental in nature, and is not meant 
as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. These limitations include the following: 
• Adjusted Revenue excludes transaction costs, which is our largest cost of revenue item; and 
• other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate Adjusted Revenue differently from how we calculate
