Dear 
Your name was referred to the FBI's Victim Assistance Program as being a possible victim of a federal

regarding the criminal justice process throughout the investigation. Our program is part of the FBI's effort to 
ensure the victims are treated with respect and are provided information about their rights under feceral law. 
These rights include notification of the status of the case. The enclosed brochures provide information about 
the FBI's Victim Assistance Program, resources and instructions for accessing the Victim Notification System

As a crime victim, you have the following nghts under 18 United States Ccde § 3771: (1) The right to

public court proceeding, or any parole proceeding, involving the crime or of any release or escape of the
