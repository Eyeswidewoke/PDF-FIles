Long Commerce: Transactions Across =ime 
Lecture 
Our UK =nterest 
We at Z/Yen =ave been proposing that some of the support for small businesses could =ome from their own 
monetary system, a UK WIR, as has been working for =0 years among 60,000 small businesses in Switzerland. I happen 
to =hink that the WIR might be a wider aid & development tool as =ell. 
On what might =he Swiss WIR mean for the UK, Z/Yen brought out a report on Capacity, =rade & Credit with the 
City of London Corporation in December =011: 
Summary Findings - =apacity, Trade and Credit: Emerging Architectures for Commerce and =oney Michael Mainelli, 
Stephanie Rochford and Chiara von =unten

City of London =orporation, 21 =ages 
The full =eport was 200 pages and had numerous recommendations about using new =urrencies and exchanges 
to increase economic growth. Lord Sassoon =articipated in the launch and a number of other senior officials are 
=xploring the implications of the report. For the City of London, =his has been their most commented-upon report since 
the Global =inancial Centre Indices — www.globalfinancialcentres.net <http://www.globalfinancialcentres.net/> - began 
in =007. They've encouraged me to promote some more discussion, via =ong Finance — www.longfinance.net 
chttp://www.longfinance.nett> , write a few editorials, =onvene a Forum last year, etc. All that said, perhaps the most 
=mportant thought was trying to introduce a UK WIR. To the Swiss, =t's a clear success comprising a quarter of Swiss 
firms and about =A33.2 billion of trading (an average trade is half CHF and half =HW).

In summary =hough, all the Swiss did in 1934 was to push their regulator to =egulate two currencies rather than 
one. They removed the =93monopoly" on money that most nations believe fiat currency =equires. From there the 
system does its thing or not. The rational currency retains its supremacy based on the universality of tax =nd its 
monopoly on the use of force, but also in competition for =redit. It bypasses the crazy and unstated assumption among 
far =oo many, that fiat tax scrip plus leveraged banking will magically =qual the trust and credit of the national economy. 
The monopolies =o fight back. The Bundesbank produces reports from time to time =sserting that German alternative 
currencies detract from the economy =though these reports (a) fail to cite Swiss reports on a substantial =ystem 
modulating cycles and extending credit, and (b) frankly aren't =hat good). The Federal Reserve stamps on scrip issue 
(see US =istory of the 1930s when there were some 400+ scrips in issue). =he Bank of England is more subtle, but is 
based too on a monopoly on =he sovereign's debt and might interpret this vigorously (and =rroneously in a way) if any 
scrip or outside credit system becomes =ignificant. 
There are a =ew more modern, though perhaps problematic, examples in the report, =ncluding a recent large 
international player, Ormita —www.ormita.com; and the WIR history is not without its 'twists and turns (the Swiss feel no 
need to promote the system — =retty much maxed out recently and they don't seek non-Swiss members =r international 
expansion — as you'll gather from their website =96 http://www.wir.ch/de/wir-kunden/ ). Lots to =onder in my opinion. 
Current UK thinking is hardly innovative and =o concerned with the art of the practical (i.e. what the "in" =ommunity of 
UK thinkers might accept that other UK people might accept) =hat London is in serious danger of being =idelined. 
If you're =till reading this far, some related =eading...
