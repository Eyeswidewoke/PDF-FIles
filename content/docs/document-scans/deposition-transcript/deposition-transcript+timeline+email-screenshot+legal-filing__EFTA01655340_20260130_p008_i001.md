The Tennessean (07/15, Sandala) and Hoodline (07/15, Robinson) reported that Andrew J. Garasich, a 29-year-old 
former U.S. Army sergeant, was sentenced to 12 years in federal prison for aggravated child neglect. The neglect 
resulted in severe injuries to his two-month-old child, including extensive burns and a skull fracture. The 
investigation was a collaborative effort between several agencies, including the Army Criminal Investigation 
Division and the FBI Nashville Field Office. Special Agent in Charge Joe Carrico of the FBI Nashville Field Office 
commented on the community's collective intolerance for child abuse and the concerted efforts to ensure 
perpetrators face significant consequences because our society cannot permit such repugnant behavior, as "there 
is no place in our community for those who harm children," he stated.

Serial New York Bank Robber Gets Five More Years In Prison 
Patch (07/15, Schinella) reported that Jesse Hippolite, 37, from Manchester, has been sentenced to up to 60 
months in prison for robbing the Granite State Credit Union. According to the article, Hippolite, described as "a 
prolific bank robber", pleaded guilty in April and has a history of victimizing bank employees. He was previously 
involved in multiple bank robberies and was released from prison in February 2023, before committing the latest 
crime on February 4. Ted E. Docks, the special agent in charge of the FBI's Boston Division, said Hippolite was "a 
crime spree unto himself," due to all the banks he robbed before this credit union hit. In March 2012, he pleaded 
guilty to three counts, despite investigators accusing him of involvement in many more. "This sentence nips his 
burgeoning bank robbery career in the bud and holds him accountable for menacing innocent people who are just 
trying to make an honest living," he added. "This case is just one example of how the FBI continues to support our 
partners in pulverizing violent crime to improve public safety."
