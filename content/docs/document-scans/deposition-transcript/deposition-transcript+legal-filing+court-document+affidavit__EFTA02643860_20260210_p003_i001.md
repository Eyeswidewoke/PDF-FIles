Thanks for your message. I guess it's not productive to continue this c=nversation by this medium at this point. If 
you have questions about anything we'v= brought up we suggest that you speak directly to the people administering 
those affairs. 
It sounds like you're all having a good time at the Cape and the we=ther has been lovely. Those of us who 
couldn't make it this time are sorry t= have missed it! and hope to be able to catch up soon. 
Love, Avi, Diane and Harry

No need to find any of this painful, and no point in spending time up and back wirh Max. As I explained, none of 
what we're now discussing has anything to do with our decision to move or other major decisions, all being taken on 
entirely different grounds. And no reason for you to be concerned about our financial situation, which is well in 
hand..<=r> 
You mention other examples. If there are any, I'd of course like to know about them. 
All I knew about, until your last letter, had to do with the interest on the loan. You brought up another matter 
that I didn't know about: DNI payments to me. As I wrote, I would like to know about them, since there is no record in 
what has been sent by Bainco. But that I-=;5 easily cleared up without our wasting any time. 
The only other issue has to do with what the promissory note says about the interest on the loan, again, easily 
resolved. What remains is a passage that we're interpreting somewhat differently, but that too is very easily resolved 
without any meetings: simply have the promissory note rewritten to state explicitly what interest is to be paid when we 
pay back the loan. And that's basically up to you. Nothing else has to be mentioned about non-existent loans. And 
there's no reason f=r any of us to waste precious time simply to resolve matters that are easily settled just by mail. 
With regard to Max, he and I agreed some time ago that he was in a difficul= position representing both Valeria 
and me on the one hand, and the rest of the family on the other. There are no difficulties in that, but it's best to resolve 
the matter cleanly. So we agreed that he wou=d represent the rest of the family while Valeria and I have all of our 
affair= separately, which is how it has been working since. So there's no reason to bring Max into this apart from 
rewriting the promissory note to resolve any ambiguities. 
Again, nothing painful, no reason for concern, what is still unclear has nothing to do with any of our decisions 
and can easily be resolved without difficulty or delay.
