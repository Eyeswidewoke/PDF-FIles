anywhere in the world can agree to refer their disputes to=the DIFC Courts, regardless of whether there is any 
connection between the s=bject matter of their dispute and the DIFC. In other words, two or more con=racting parties 
that have no connection whatsoever with the DIFC can now ch=ose to have their disputes resolved before the DIFC 
Courts. 
Why is this significant? 
This is a potentially game-changing event for dispute resolution in the M=ddle East region because: 
1. The DIFC Court is a state-of-the-art common law court whose procedures=are based on the English civil procedure 
rules (with the ability to grant s=mmary judgment), and whose judges comprise very experienced former judges f=om 
the senior courts of (for example) England, Singapore and New Zealand;</=> 
2. Judgments rendered by the DIFC Courts can be enforced in the onshore D=bai courts as Dubai court judgments and 
this has happened on numerous occas=ons; 
3. In contrast to many offshore courts, parties in the DIFC Court can be a=arded the bulk of their legal and expert costs 
and expenses; 
4. Dubai is signatory to two conventions providing for the recognition an= enforcement of court judgments in many 
countries in the MENA Region. =These are: 
• 
the 1983 Convention on Judicial Co-operation between States of the Arab L=ague (the "Riyadh Convention"), to 
which all of the Gulf Cooperation=Council ("GCC") countries, as well as Iraq, Palestine, Sudan, Mauret=nia, Somalia, 
Tunisia, Jordan, Morocco, Libya, Algeria, Yemen and Syria are=signatoryi=j; and 
` 
the 1995 Protocol on the Enforcement of Judgments Letters Rogatory,=and Judicial Notices issued by the Courts 
of the Member States of the Arab G=If Co-operation Council (the "GCC Protocol"), to which all of the GC= countries are 
signatory. 
Why should this interest you? 
If your company conducts business in the above countries we encourage you=to speak with us to discuss the significance 
and implications of this new l=gislation on your business and in particular, on your existing dispute=resolution policies. 
We believe that this development may be particul=rly important for: 
• 
financial institutions with a presence in the MENA region, as the judges=in the DIFC Courts have experience of 
handling complex cross-border financi=l disputes, and the power to grant summary judgment; 
• 
parties contracting with regional financial institutions; 
• 
businesses with a presence in the UAE and in the wider MENA region,=which will need to review their standard 
and bespoke contracts in light of t=is development; and 
• 
clients with an existing business, or planning to do business, in t=e Kingdom of Saudi Arabia since this 
development may present an alternative=option for dispute resolution in contracts involving the Kingdom of Saudi 
A=abia.
