deciding whom to exclude is troublesome because 'a lot of the historical evidence and long-
standing practice really cuts against your position." 
USA Today (11/30, Wolf, 10.31M) reports, "Most justices indicated [Trump) may not have 
the right to exclude as many as 11 million people from the population base, a policy that would 
cost California and possibly other states seats in the House." But several of the court's 
"conservative justices noted that down-to-the-wire efforts by the Census Bureau to tally 
undocumented immigrants could fall short of the president's goal." According to the New York 
Times (11/30, Liptak, 18.61M), "The case is riddled with practical complications. Census Bureau 
officials have said they cannot produce the required data until after Mr. Trump leaves office in 
January. Even if they do, it is not clear that congressional officials would accept what they may 
view as flawed calculations." 
Roll Call (11/30, Macagnone, 154K) says "all six Republican-appointed justices questioned 
the practicality of making a ruling by the end of the year before Trump actually issues 
apportionment numbers." The Washington Post (11/30, Barnes, 14.2M) reports Chief Justice 
John Roberts "was among those questioning whether the court should wait to see whether the 
Census Bureau, under the direction" of Commerce Secretary Ross, "can even produce useful 
numbers about the undocumented population. Or if the numbers the government can produce 
will make a difference when deciding the size of each state's congressional delegation." 
CNN (11/30, de Vogue, 83.16M) reports on its website that "the justices seemed 
extremely skeptical that in the waning days of the Trump administration, the government has 
the time to fulfill its stated goal, with Justice Samuel Alito saying it would be a 'monumental 
task' to complete such a count by December 31." Politico (11/30, Gerstein, Montellaro, 4.29M) 
also reports that the Supreme Court "seemed reluctant...to issue an immediate, sweeping 
ruling" on Trump's plans "to exclude undocumented immigrants from the decennial census used 
to allocate House seats." 
The New York Times (11/30, Wines, 18.61M) writes in an analysis, "On Monday, the 
Supreme Court heard arguments on a question that goes to the heart of American democracy: 
Must the government count everyone living in the country, citizens or not, in the census totals 
that the House of Representatives uses to reallocate its 435 seats among the states? For more 
than two centuries, the answer has been 'yes:" Reuters (11/30, Hurley), the Los Angeles Times 
(11/30, Savage, 4.64M), and The Hill (11/30, Kruzel, 2.98M) also report. 
Trump Reportedly Mulling Additional Immigration Moves. 
Politico (11/30, Kumar, 4.29M) reports that since the election, some of President Trump's aides 
have "pushed through changes that make it easier to deny visas to immigrants, lengthened the 
citizenship test and appointed new members to an immigration policy board." According to 
Politico, "Some aides even urged Trump to sign an executive order attempting to end birthright 
citizenship for the children of immigrants." Politico cites "two people familiar with the 
discussions," but adds that "a third person said the idea had recently been dismissed." Politico 
goes on to report that "the focus is on putting a bind" on Joe Biden, "making it harder for him 
to reverse these politically fraught issues." 
Congress Sprints To Avoid Government Shutdown On December 11. 
Reuters (11/30) reports Congress has begun "a two-week sprint to rescue the federal 
government from a possible shutdown amid the coronavirus pandemic, the first major test 
since the election of whether Republicans and Democrats intend to cooperate." Negotiators 
"have made progress on how to divvy up around $1.4 trillion to be spent by Sept. 30, 2021, the 
end of the current fiscal year," but "more granular details are still unresolved and votes by the 
full House and Senate on a massive funding bill may come close to bumping up against that 
Dec. 11 deadline." Reuters adds that it is "unclear" whether President Trump, "who was 
defeated in the Nov. 3 election, will cooperate with the effort underway in Congress."
