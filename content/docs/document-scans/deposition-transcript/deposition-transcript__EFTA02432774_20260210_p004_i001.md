Geoffrey Beene, and Vogue's fashion editor Hamish Bowles wears a riot of plaids, patterns and a large yellow fake flower 
on his lapel. Costume Designer Ellen Mirojnick, who created Gordon Gekko's rich slick look in the first film, is ecstatic 
with the extras I invited. 
Oliver is shooting a scene with Josh Brolin (the star of Stone's "W"). His character Bretton (never Bret) James, 
a ruthless Wall Street kingpin, and his perfect wife Samantha (Hoene Beck) arc hosting a benefit piano recital for a 13-
year-old child prodigy in their huge, an-filled townhouse at 41 East 65th Street. The building actually belongs to Baby 
Jane Holzer, a wealthy an collector still famous for hanging with Andy Warhol in the `60s. Thc production designer had 
Jane's fabulous Warhols moved to storage and replaced with matching photographic copies. Very expensive contemporary 
art is again an important production element of Oliver's vision. 
At 10:30 a.m.. all the extras arc placed around the living room set. Oliver's French mother. Jacqueline Stone, 
and her friend Monique Van Vooren, both in their 80s, are seated in front of the fireplace chatting in French. Production 
assistants fuss over them. Debonair macho man Chuck PlielTer, who appeared in the original film, and I immediately 
invent a back story—I am his corporate wife—and we position ourselves on a couch next to the director's mother. Julia 
gets the best spot close to the piano and Amy, !famish and decorator Geoffrey Bradfield are right behind her. Josh is 
brought in and the kibitzing stops. 
Oliver appears on the set with eagle eyes and a sly grin and quickly re-positions everyone. He explains the scene. 
gives out lines to his favored extras, and on his way out to the monitors in the next room mentions that my earrings are too 
small. Wardrobe jumps. Josh rehearses and Oliver finally yells. "Action." The kid plays the piano. Josh explains why we 
are in his home, asks for money, the camera dollies as extras say their lines and Shia appears at the door uninvited for a 
confrontation with Josh. Three hours later a PA yells, "Lunch". 
In costume, Amy, Flamish and I run to The Monkey Bar. I am late to meet "The Harpies," including Liz Smith, 
Barbara Walters, Cynthia McFadden, Nora Ephron, Jennifer Isham, Maury Pen and Beth Kseniak. 
Graydon Carter is at the next table. I tell him Oliver Stone wants him in "Wall Street 2" as an extra. (I make this 
up.) Graydon jokes that he only works with lines. I say, "Not a problem." (This will be news to Oliver.) 
Back on the set I tell Oliver that Graydon is willing to be in the film with lines. Oliver finds that intriguing. 
Oliver shoots the piano recital scene over and over again from different angles all afternoon. Financial wizard 
Don Marron saunters on the set to visit and Oliver spontaneously puts him in a scene chatting with Josh. Carrie Mulligan 
hangs out watching boyfriend Shia work. 
At sundown Julia Koch has to race from reel to real life and explain to her husband where she has been all day. 
(He loves it.) 
Chuck Pfieffer plants a "Page Six" item and the next day socialites begin calling me to get into the film. 
Thursday, November 5, Shun Lee Restaurant, \Vest 65th Street 
Oliver shoots a crowded tight interior scene with Michael, Carrie and Shia, who are having an intimate Chinese 
dinner. Spontaneously. Oliver decides this is the perfect scene for Graydon Caner. After a flurry of calls. Graydon arrives 
on set, and playing himself, sashays by the table. Gekko jumps up to say hello and Graydon brushes him off with a few 
dismissive lines. 
Monday, November 9, 25 Broadway 
One hundred swells show up at the former Canard Shipping building, a massive Italianate hall, at the crack of 
dawn for the Alzheimer's Ball. a grand charity event.
