FBAR: 
Tom may revisions and posted to porta= yesterday. I reviewed and posed additional questions to Tom

Isle of man — please see atta=hed Moore Stephens memo re Isle of Man VAT registration. I will conf=rm with 
Captain Sputh that Isle of Man was chosen for VAT registration. Also attached is memo PW paralegal wrote on 
BJAV=which provides broad summary. Captain was contacted yesterday/=afternoon and I will look to speak to him 
today. He is on GMT =ime. Attached is a sampling of invoices. No invoices have ever been sent or mailed to 760 Park. 
All invoices come to family office =ia email from Captain Sputh. Sputh has had vendor relationships for =any years and 
some date back to Carl Ichan (CCI) ownership . l=will confirm with Captain Sputh how he receives invoices. I assembled 
30 invoices for your perusal. Some invoices are clearly =mailed only as there is no address. Some use dock where boat 
is bert=ed. Some use CCI address of 767 Fifth Ave. Some use Captain Sp=th's address in Florida. Many use Cayman and 
Isle of Man addresses. A few use 760 Park. As for charters, S=uth has continued to use the same form as when used 
when captain for CCI.=C2 Generally the address used is 760 Park or 445 Park. =AO Note that CCI charters used CCI 
address on Fifth Ave. See a=tached page one for CCI charter and two recent BJAV charters. I will look to disc=ss with 
Sputh today the invoice address and the charter address. I a=ked EA for color on use of 760 Park and her review of her 
files was a dead=end. 
For construction of SH Meadow (bay ho=se) , we are capitalizing into basis. We value this property at tax =asis 
on our books. For the townhouse we are doing same. We have these invoices and as such we review each to 
det=rmine capital vs expense. For other real estate we have valued=based on valuation guidance provided by JEE and/ 
or EA/ BJW. For inv=ices that we have access or have collected, we have capitalized but value the property rather than 
use tax basis (books). Miri=m had analyzed 760 improvements based on her records over the past several=years and 
she did not find a material amount. A more detailed review=is warranted for determining gain the 760 Park coop is 
sold. A project that needs to be completed is compiling all =nvoices for the Field House construction and derive a tax 
basis. =AO Also the insurance reimbursement information will be needed.</=> 
Trading — Entity was cr=ated yesterday by PW. PW/ Ada are working on LLC agreement.
