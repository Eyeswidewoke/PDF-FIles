discussed but it is important for each of us to discover the unique workings of his own mind. That 
takes the work of the Inner Jihad. 
FP: Share with our readers what you mean by the "Turnaround Moment." 
Siegel: There is a moment in typical horror films where the central characters have been pushed 
to their limit. They then change and fully embrace the willingness to be as ruthless as the threat 
they face. No more moral high ground; no more futile attempts to ignore or change the threat's 
essence. As Lee Harris described in The Suicide of Reason it is the willingness o r license to be 
(not necessarily actually being) as ruthless that is critical. It is a mental state that sheds all the 
prior counter-productive efforts at denial to finally clearly focus on the threat faced. Part of the 
Inner Jihad is to reach that Turnaround Moment sooner rather than later. 
FP: You suggest that "mirroring" should be used as part of our arsenal. Tell us about it. 
Siegel: Mirroring is a literal approach to transferring back to the addict responsibility that we 
have been inappropriately accepting. Critical to the addict/enabler relationship is asymmetry. Like 
the addict, the enemy uses a less limiting set of rules than we do. The enemy typically initiates 
aggression while we respond only. Mirroring means that we demonstrate our willingness to act 
symmetrically, to be governed by the same rules. It is stunning how much is accomplished when 
one's attitude simply is clear that he will do what is necessary; often not much else is needed as 
the addict or enemy realizes the game is fundamentally changed. But other times action is 
absolutely needed. Demonstrating that we are not afraid to treat the enemy as it treats us carries 
great meaning. Imagine (international law aside) if Israel announced that from now on it will 
mirror Hamas such that if civilian populations are targeted by bombs from Gaza, Israel will do the 
same (it is accused of such anyway). The population might finally rethink and take responsibility 
for its privilege of voting its leaders. As stated earlier, all behavior is instructive and when we 
mirror we teach the other the effects of his behavior. 
Conversely, some situations demand that we assert asymmetry; those cases where it is necessary 
to highlight our diffeicuces with the enemy. Just this week, an disingenuous report was issued by 
an NGO drawing an equivalence between Palestinian and Israe li schoolbooks claiming that both 
sides have their relativistic " narratives." Yet, as the Palestinian Media Watch's website has 
demonstrated for years, there is nothing in the West anywhere comparable to the hatred spewed 
daily by the Palestinian Authority, including through its education system. It is interesting to note 
that while the US State Department initially funded the "study,"- in what appears to be an attempt 
to sanitize the PA's record so that the US can continue to fund the PA against the spirit of US law-
Hillary Clinton has a difficult time escaping her conclusion as Senator in 2007 that these 
schoolbooks along with other media "profoundly poison(s) the minds of these children." It is most 
important that we do not succumb to this type of use of symmetry that distorts the profound 
differences between us and the enemy. 
Essentially, we are not clear as a nation, participating in a world with international rules, how to 
bes t fight this enemy. The first act of any rehab is to acknowledge that we do not know how nor 
arc we yet competent to stop our addictions. This is not a book about policy. In fact, the "right" 
policies are unlikely to emerge until a critical mass has meaningfully dealt with their Control 
Factors and share a common perspective. We like to look at our history and assume a single
