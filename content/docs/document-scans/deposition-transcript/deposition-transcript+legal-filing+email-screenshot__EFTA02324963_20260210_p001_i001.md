Re: Photos 
Than 
very helpful. Personally, I think it makes =ense to have the sofa on the back wall with no game table. I showed JE =he 
photos and he would like to see more photos of the overall room with =he couch against the back wall so he can get a 
better sense; photos =rom the corners, etc, so there is more perspective of overall room. =nbsp;Maybe we get a shorter 
couch for that room, could be an option I =uppose. They sell the same couch in a 6' version. (the current one is =') Not 
sure if that would make enough of a =ifference. 
He also said we can take out the horse hair =abinet, but I know we will need something there to cover the conduit, =tc. I 
don't know how large it is or what is looks like? Maybe we could =ave a box built around it which opens that could be 
painted the same as =he walls? 
JE said we don't have to worry =bout covering the shelves in the back of the room because his back will =e to them. He 
said we don't even have to worry about the curtains =oming all the way to the shelving on the wall because we won't 
see that =art either when watching a movie. He doesn't seem too concerned with =he way it will look when you walk in 
the room, as long as it makes the =alls black while watching a movie so there isn't the glare off the =hite walls. 
He questioned the blackness of the fabric =rom the photos, but in person it looks black right? I said it was just =he flash 
from the camera that made it look =ighter.

Hi -
1- Fabric I am suggesting 
2 & 3 - other fabric sample which I do not think will work =s well 
5 - Back Shelving Wall Great Room - may not need to be address =ith fabric? 
7 - Showing corner - fabric would not stop at shelving, but go =ight into corner - cut out area 
9 - Showing how a rod could go right in front of shelving, =itting on moulding noting than when curtains were 
pulled back, you =ould still see the rod 
10, 11 & 13 - Relax room with 2 matching chairs, noting =oor hits chair 
14 - Space between sofa and table on back wall I do not believe =e could move it any closer 
12 - Space between side table and horsehair book =helf 
16 - Sofa on back wall 
15 - Gap between chair and horsehair with sofa on back =all 
19 - Gap between chair and wall with sofa on back =all 
Please note I think the room looks very good in pictures 10 =amp; 11- shame about the door 
Let me know what else you may need, if you could get some =irection on if JE wants the back shelving wall 
curtained or not then I =ill work on fabric quantity 
Warmest regards
