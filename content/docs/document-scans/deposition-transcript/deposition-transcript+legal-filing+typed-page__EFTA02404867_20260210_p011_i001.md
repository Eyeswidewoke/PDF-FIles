Interview with Martin Wolf 
March 30, 2012 -- The group of fast-growing emerging markets known as the BRICS--Brazil, R=ssia, India, China, and 
South Africa--held their fourth annual summit this=past week in New Delhi. The leaders of the five nations agreed on 
new meas=res to facilitate greater trade within the bloc, including a deal to extend credit facilities in the 
local=currencies of other BRICS countries. They also discussed a potential plan =o set up a joint BRICS development 
bank, which would serve as a counterwei=ht to the Western-dominated World Bank and International Monetary Fund. 
However, the BRICS have not set out = comprehensive long-term agenda because they are hobbled by internal 
diffe=ences and have "nothing in common," argues the Financial Times' =artin Wolf. 
What are the prospects for a BRI=S development bank? 
It's not completely obvious to me what i= could achieve, given that we have the World Bank and a whole network of b=g 
regional development banks. There are big questions about the governance of those institutions, and in particular, t=e 
continued domination of the developed countries. The BRICS collectively =ould be able to shake that if they really try to 
do so. What's not clear t= me is whether this is a bank that would operate everywhere using BRICS money in some way, 
or whether it woul= be a BRIC bank. We have enough official banks, and it would make far more=sense to improve the 
governance of what we have than to start creating com=letely new institutions. 
What is the significance of the =act that the BRICS did not put forward a candidate for the World Bank pres=dency, and 
is it clear where they stand vis-à-vis the U.S. nominee? 
The BRICS are not a group. The BRICS wer= invented by Jim O'Neil [of Goldman Sachs, in 2001j. They added South Afri=a 
to the BRICS [last year), which wasn't originally there, to give some representation of Africa. These countries h=ve 
basically nothing in common whatsoever, except that they are called BRI=S and they are quite important. But in all other 
respects, their interests=and values, political systems, and objectives are substantially diverse. So there's no reason 
whatsoever =o expect them to agree on anything substantive in the world, except that t=e existing dominating powers 
should cede some of their influence and power= That's the one thing they have in common. 
Secondly, the grouping has very specific=jealousies within it, particularly the two most powerful members--in terms=of 
their potential, anyway--China and India. There's a lot of mistrust between the two, and [it would be) very difficul= for 
them to agree on a candidate. Third, at this stage, I don't think the= are particularly interested in quixotic battles. They 
know the U.S. is li=ely to get European support. They probably don't regard this--none of the countries individually or 
collecti=ely--as a first-class issue to use their capital on in a big way. In time,=voting shares are going to be adjusted, so 
sooner or later, the big countr=es are going to get the power that they need. It's a matter of continuous pressure over 
time, so why fight th=s battle now when they don't really care what happens in the World Bank? B=cause these 
countries are not very dependent on the World Bank. 
There's no=reason to expect them to agree on anything substantive in the world, excep= that the existing dominating 
powers should cede some of their influence a=d power. 
What are some objectives that th= BRICS agree upon, besides getting the West to cede power? 
Quite a number of them tend to complain =bout Western protectionism. They obviously are interested in developing 
tr=de amongst themselves; that's a potential area of cooperation. But I don't regard the BRICS as a grouping of 
natural=fellows. They are very, very different politically, in terms of their deve=opment potential, in terms of the 
economic fundamentals they have--and the= have quite a few conflicts among them.
