Market Disruption Events 
The Calculation Agent may, in its sole discretion, determine that an event has occurred that prevents us or our affiliates from 
properly hedging our obligations under the Notes or prevents the Calculation Agent from valuing the Reference Currency in the 
manner initially provided for herein. These events may include disruptions or suspensions of trading in the markets as a whole or 
general inconvertibility, or non-transferability of the Reference Currency. If the Calculation Agent, in its sole discretion, determines 
that any of these events has occurred or is occurring on the Final Valuation Date, the Calculation Agent may determine the Final Spot 
Rate in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner on such date, or, in the discretion of the Calculation Agent, may 
detennine to postpone the Final Valuation Date and Maturity Date for up to five scheduled trading days, each of %%filch may adversely 
affect the return on your Notes. if the Final Valuation Date has been postponed for five consecutive scheduled trading days and a 
market disruption event continues on the filth scheduled trading day, then that firth scheduled trading day will nevertheless be the 
Final Valuation Date and the Calculation Agent will detennine the Spot Rate of the Reference Currency using the formula for and 
method of determining such Spot Rate which applied just prior to the market disruption event (or in good faith and in a commercially 
reasonable manner) on such date. 
If the Maturity Date is not a business day, the amounts payable on the Notes will be paid on the next following business day and 
no interest will be paid in respect of such postponement. 
A -business day" means any day, other than a Saturday or Sunday. that is neither a legal holiday nor a day on which banking 
institutions are authorized or required by law or regulation to close in the City of New York. 
Events of Default and Acceleration 
If the Notes have become immediately due and payable following an event of default (as defined in the accompanying prospectus) 
with respect to the Notes, the Calculation Agent will determine the accelerated Payment at Maturity due and payable in the same 
general manner as described in "Key Terms" in this pricing supplement. in that case, the business day preceding the date of 
acceleration will be used as the Final Valuation Date for purposes of determining the accelerated Reference Currency Return 
(including the Final Spot Rate). The accelerated Maturity Date will be the filth business day following the accelerated Final Valuation 
Date. 
If the Notes have become immediately due and payable following an event of default, you will not be entitled to any additional 
payments with respect to the Notes. For more information, six "Description of Debt Securities — Senior Debt Securities — Events of 
Default" in the accompanying prospectus. 
Supplemental Plan of Distribution (Conflicts of Interest) 
Pursuant to the terms of a distribution agreement, HSBC Securities (USA) Inc., an affiliate of HSBC, will purchase the Notes from 
HSBC for distribution to J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and certain of its miistered broker-dealer affiliates, acting as placement agent, at 
the price indicated on the cover of this pricing supplement. The placement agents for the Notes will receive a fee that will not exceed 
SIO per SI,000 Principal Amount of Notes. 
In addition, I ISBC Securities (USA) Inc. or another of its affiliates or agents may use this pricing supplement in market-making 
transactions after the initial sale of the Notes, but is under no obligation to make a market in the Notes and may discontinue any 
market-making activities at any time without notice.

Delivery of the Notes will be made against payment for the Notes on the Original Issue Date set forth on the cover page of this 
document, which is the filth business day following the Trade Date of the Notes. Under Rule 15th-1 under the Securities Exchange 
Act of 1934, trades in the secondary• market generally arc required to settle in three business days, unless the parties to that trade 
expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade Notes on the Trade Date and the following business day 
thereafter will be required to specify an alternate settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement, and 
should consult their own advisors.
