GLDUSI27 Annandale Capital 
Section 7: Risk Factors 
Glendower Capital Secondary Opportunities Fund IV. LP 
operations teams that were involved in the management of the SOF Funds at Deutsche Bank have joined the Manager 
and the U.S. Adviser. Accordingly, in evaluating the past performance of the SOF Funds, prospective investors should 
note that the partners and employees of the Manager and the U.S. Adviser were formally part of Deutsche Bank, a large 
institution. and. in connection with the investments comprising the track record of the SOF Funds, such persons 
functioned as part of a larger group within Deutsche Bank and the success or otherwise of the SOF Funds should not be 
solely attributed to the partners and employees of the Manager and the U.S. Adviser. 
Liquidity risk 
The Fund's investments are typically expected to be highly illiquid investments that are not listed on a stock exchange or 
for which there may only be a limited number of potential buyers. Political and regulatory considerations (including 
limitations on ownership and approval rights) could also affect the ability of the Fund to buy or sell investments on 
favorable terms. As a result, there can be no assurance that the Fund will be able to realize cash from such investments 
in a timely manner, and dispositions of such investments may require a lengthy time period or may result in distributions 
in kind to Investors. Moreover, the realizable value of a highly ikigtid investment may be less than its intrinsic value or 
the valuation assigned to it by the Fund. 
Distributions in kind 
Although, under normal circumstances, it is intended that the Fund will make distributions in cash, it is possible that upon 
the liquidation of the Fund and in certain other circumstances as set out in the Fund Documents distributions may be 
made in kind (or in specie) and could consist of securities for which there is not a readily available public market. 
securities that are subject to legal and contractual transfer restrictions or securities of entities unable to make 
distributions. 
Investor risk 
Investors will be obliged to meet drawdown notices promptly, and fadure to do so may subject an Investor to severe 
consequences as set out in the Fund Documents, including without limitation forfeiture of its Interest. Should an Investor 
fail to provide the money drawn down from it promptly, the Fund may be unable to consummate the investment for which 
the money was to be provided or may be unable to meet other obligations when due. As a result. the Fund may be 
subjected to significant penalties (which could materially and adversely affect the returns to Investors) and money 
provided by the other Investors may be returned to them without having been invested and will be subject to recall. If a 
defaulting Investor's Interest is forfeited, the total Commitments may be reduced, which will kmit both the number of 
investments the Fund can still make, and the diversity of its investments including those that it has already made. 
Further, in the event that an Investor fails to comply with its obligations under the Fund Partnership Agreement to provide 
certain information, and comply with certain procedures, to enable the Fund to comply with the recently enacted U.S. 
Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment Act, such failure may subject an Investor to severe consequences as set out in 
the Fund Documents. 
Amounts and timings of payments to the Fund are uncertain 
Drawdowns may occur at any point, and for any amount (up to an Investors undrawn commitment to the Fund). during 
the life of the Fund, including after the termination of the Investment Penod 
Risks associated with unspecified transactions 
There are risks and uncertainties to Investors with respect to the selection of investments. Investors will not have an 
opportunity to evaluate for themselves the relevant economic. financial and other information regarding the investments 
to be made by the Fund and. accordingly, will be dependent upon the judgment and ability of the Manager in sourcing 
suitable transactions and in investing and managing the assets of the Fund. No assurance can be given that the Fund 
will be successful in obtaining suitable investments at attractive prices or that it will be able to fully invest Commitments.
