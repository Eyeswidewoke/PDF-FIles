Our policy on the Prohibition Against Discrimination, =arassment, and 
Retaliation (ACD 401 https://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/acd/acd401.html) =nd its accompanying procedures (P20 — link 
to the procedures is =mbedded in the policy document) directs the Office of Equity and =nclusion to conduct prompt 
and equitable investigations. Among =he points stated are that the Office accepts anonymous complaints as =ell as 
direct complaints. University employees are required to =ooperate with any investigation or allegations of violations of 
this =olicy. Providing false or misleading information or failing to =ooperate may result in disciplinary action. Individuals 
making a =omplaint or participating as a witness in an investigation cannot be =etaliated against. Any employee who 
engages in retaliation will =e disciplined. The Office of Equity and Inclusion does not make =ny findings until such time 
as it determines that it has completed its =act gathering. 
Our courts recognize that participants in an =dministrative investigation have a 
privilege against a defamation =harge. In Paros v. Hoemako Hospital, 140 Ariz. 335, =81 P.2d 918 (Ct. App. Div. 2 1984), 
the court recognized that the =mployer's response to a notice of charge of discrimination =iled with the Equal 
Employment Opportunity Commission was absolutely =rivileged. In Miller v. Servicemaster by Rees, 174 Ariz. at =20, 
851 P.2d 240, 243 (Ct. App. Div. 1 1993), the court recognized the =xistence of a conditional privilege for employees to 
report perceived =cts of sexual harassment as public policy dictated that employees must =e protected from workplace 
sexual harassment. Cited approvingly, Carey v. Maricopa County, 2009 WL 750225 =D. Ariz. 20O9). Both Paros and Miller 
were cases =oncerning discrimination and harassment under Title VII. In =ddition to its obligations under Title VII, the 
University must also =perate its educational programs and activities to be free from gender =iscrimination under Title IX. 
The Office of Equity and Inclusion will proceed with its =nvestigation as outlined 
in ACD 401 and P20. The Office will not =rovide your client with its investigative file. We look forward =o Dr. Krauss's 
continuing cooperation. Regards,

Dear Naimah et al: 
Attached you will =ind a letter from my attorney, along with a letter he sent to 
Buzzfeed =arlier in this week regarding the defamatory and false story they were =lanning on printing. The story was 
then published yesterday =orning. I wanted =o add to his letter, to reiterate our concern about how your office was 
=tanning to follow up on the false and defamatory third-party =Ilegations from Buzzfeed. Because this was initiated by 
an =nline entertainment news outlet with a clear agenda and established =ecord of propagating false allegations about 
me, rather than by any of =he individuals they refer to as sources, this should not be =onsidered a credible allegation 
worthy of investigation. I believe that =ur initial discussion was sufficient to settle this matter. =hether or not you agree 
with this, there are two things I think are important to establish. 
Firstly, that the University should =ot propagate what can be false allegations 
from such a source by =resenting them directly to current and/or former employees or to =thers. To do so would be to
