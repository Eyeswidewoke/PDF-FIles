taxes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Compulsory Acquisition is implemented. then the 
Dutch Court (as defined below) will determine the price to be paid for the non-tendered Shares. Although Intel 
and Purchaser will use their reasonable best efforts to cause the per Share price paid in the Compulsory 
Acquisition for the non-tendered Shares to be equal to the Offer Consideration, such price may be greater than. 
equal to or less than the Offer Consideration. Such price may potentially be increased by statutory interest 
("Dutch Statutory Interest") accrued at the rate applicable in The Netherlands (currently two percent per annum). 
The period for the calculation of the Dutch Statutory Interest would begin either (i) on the date on which the 
Offer Consideration became payable to Mobileye shareholders who tendered their Shares to Purchaser in the 
Offer (the "Offer Payment Date"), provided that Purchaser has acquired at least 95% of Mobileye's issued capital 
(geplaarst kapiraal) as of the Offer Payment Date or (ii) under certain circumstances, including when Purchaser 
has not acquired at least 95% of Mobileye's issued capital (geplatlist kapitaal) as of the Offer Payment Date. 
from the date when the Dutch Court renders a judgment allowing the claim for the Compulsory Acquisition 
against the non-tendering shareholders for all of their Mobikye Shares. The end of the period for the calculation 
of the Dutch Statutory Interest would be on the date Purchaser pays for the Shares then owned by the non-
tendering Mobileye shareholders. As a result of the Post-Offer Reorganization. Mobileye will either be liquidated 
or become wholly owned by Purchaser. 
Purchaser and Intel may effectuate or cause to be effectuated. at Purchaser's or Intel's election, the Post-
Offer Reorganization by one or more of a variety of actions, potentially including (a) subject to the receipt of the 
Pre-Wired Asset Sale Ruling (as defined below) and the approval of the Pre-Wired Asset Sale Resolutions by 
Mobileye shareholders at the EGM a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of Mobileye to. and the transfer 
to and assumption of all or substantially all of the assets and liabilities of Mobileye by. Purchaser (or an affiliate 
of Purchaser) (the "Asset Sale") and, as soon as practicable following the consummation of the Asset Sale. 
completing the Post-Offer Reorganization by the Liquidation (as defined below) and. as soon as practicable 
following the consummation of the Asset Sale, the Second Step Distribution (as defined below) or (b) if 
permissible under applicable law, the Compulsory Acquisition. 
Under the Purchase Agreement, Mobileye (which is a tax resident of Israel) has agreed. as soon as 
reasonably practicable after the execution of the Purchase Agreement. and in consultation with Intel and 
Purchaser, to prepare and file with the ITA an application for a ruling or rulings in form and substance 
reasonably acceptable to Intel and Purchaser that (a) exempts Intel, Purchaser and Mobileye from Israeli tax with 
respect to the Asset Sale, the Second Step Distribution and the Liquidation. taking into account all relevant 
related steps (including the possible conversion of Mobikye from a naandoze vennoorschap or N.V. to a besloren 
vennoorschap rust beperkre aansprakelijkheid or B.V. following the Asset Sale) and (b) provides that the Asset 
Sale will not adversely affect the remaining duration or the extent of the incentives available to Mobileye and its 
subsidiaries resulting from the status of a "Preferred Enterprise" and/or "Benefitted Enterprise" under Israel's 
Law for the Encouragement of Capital Investment. 1959. or require any recapture of any previously claimed 
incentive, and that the entitlement of Mobileye or any of its subsidiaries to any such incentive shall be preserved 
despite the Asset Sale (clauses (a) and (b) together, the "Pre-Wired Asset Sale Ruling"). 
If the ITA issues the Pre-Wired Asset Sale Ruling and Mobileye shareholders have approved the Pre-Wired 
Asset Sale Resolutions and the Conversion Resolutions. and if Purchaser and Intel elect to proceed with the Asset 
Sale followed by the Liquidation and the Second Step Distribution, and if the number of Shares tendered 
pursuant to the Offer and not properly withdrawn (including Shares validly tendered during the Subsequent 
Offering Period, as it may be extended by the Minority Exit Offering Period), together with the Shares then 
owned by Intel or its affiliates, represents at least 67% of Mobileye's issued capital (geplaarst kapitaal) (or 80%, 
if the Mobileye shareholders have not approved the Pre-Wired Asset Sale Resolutions and the Conversion 
Resolutions), then the cash consideration paid by Purchaser (or an affiliate of Purchaser) to Mobileye in the Asset 
Sale would be an aggregate amount equal to the Offer Consideration multiplied by the total number of Shares 
held by non-tendering Mobileye shareholders as of the expiration of the Subsequent Offering Period and, upon 
consummation of the Asset Sale, (a) Mobileye will hold only the cash received in the Asset Sale: (b) Purchaser 
(or an affiliate of Purchaser) would 6) own all of Mobileye's business operations and (ii) be the principal
