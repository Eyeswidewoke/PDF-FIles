CRS-8 
(A) The applicant establishes that there is a pattern or practice in his or her 
country of nationality or, if stateless, in his or her country of last habitual 
residence, of persecution of a group of persons similarly situated to the applicant 
on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, 
or political opinion; and 
(B) The applicant establishes his or her own inclusion in, and identification with, 
such group of persons such that his or her fear of persecution upon return is 
reasonable.' 
Mixed Motives. The intent of the persecutor is also subjective and may stem 
from multiple motives. The courts have ruled that the persecution may have more 
than one motive, and so long as one motive is one of the statutorily enumerated 
grounds, the requirements have been satisfied.36 A 1997 BIA decision concluded "an 
applicant for asylum need not show conclusively why persecution occurred in the 
past or is likely to occur in the future, [but must] produce evidence from which it is 
reasonable to believe that the harm was motivated, at least in part, by an actual or 
imputed protected ground."27 Generally, the asylum seeker must demonstrate in 
mixed motive cases that — even though his/her persecutors were motivated for a 
non-cognizable reason (e.g., the police's desire to obtain information regarding 
terrorist activities in the Sikh cases) — the persecutors were also motivated by the 
asylum seeker's race, religion, nationality, social group, or political opinion? 
Process of Requesting Asylum 
An applicant for asylum begins the process either already in the United States 
or at a port of entry seeking admission. This process differs from a potential refugee 
who begins a separate process wholly outside of the United States? Depending on 
whether or not the applicant is currently in removal proceedings, two avenues exist 
to seek asylum: "affirmative applications" and "defensive applications." The 
affirmative and defensive applications follow different procedural paths, but draw on 
the same legal standards. In both processes, the burden of proof is on the asylum 
seeker to establish that he or she meets the refugee definition specified in the NA. 
Affirmative Applications. An asylum seeker who is in the United States and 
not involved in any removal proceedings files an 1-589, the asylum application form, 
with the USCIS-Regional Service Center. The USCIS schedules a non-adversarial 
interview with a member of the Asylum Officer Corps. There are eight asylum 
offices located throughout the country. The asylum officers either grant asylum to 
successful applicants or refer to the immigration judges those applicants who fail to 
meet the definition. The asylum officers make their determinations regarding the 
affirmative applications based upon the application form, the information received 
25 8 C.F.R. §208.13(bX2).
