A review of the daily Department of Corrections log that is submitted by Epstein, 
indicated that he was at his office from 8:00 am to 10:00 pm that date. It appears that he 
falsified the document, because according to the above incident he was first walking to 
work at 4:45 p.m., which was totally in conflict with him already being at work at 8:00 
am. Additionally the statement made by his then probation officer that Epstein usually 
goes to work that time is also false and contradictory to his daily logs. A review of the 
daily logs from the time he was released from jail to the date of his incident revealed that 
one day he left for work at 2:00 pm, and every other day he left prior to noon, with a 
majority of the days indicating between 9am and 10am.
