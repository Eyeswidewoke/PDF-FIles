Dear Aircraft Owner: 
The registration of the aircraft shown above expired on September 30, 2019. 
The aircraft's registration and airworthiness certificates no longer support the aircraft's operation. 
The N-number is no longer authorized for use and its assignment to this aircraft will be cancelled 60 days 
from the date of this notice. 
We ask that you return the registration certificate to the FAA Aircraft Registration Branch as established in 
14 C.F.R. Section 47.41(b). 
Aircraft registration renewal every third year was established in Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations. Section 47.40(c) 
on October 1, 2010, as published in the Federal Register on July 20, 2010. page 41968. The changes made at this 
time will keep the U.S. Civil Aircraft Register up-to-date, to provide reliable support to users of the registration system. 
N-NUMBER RESERVATION: If an aircraft registration will not be renewed, its owner may reserve the N-
number by sending the Registry the first year's $10.00 reservation fee with a request to cancel the aircraft's 
registration and to reserve the N-number in the owner's name. If no request is made within 60 days of the 
date of this notice, the N-number will be canceled and become unavailable for five years. 
AIRCRAFT REGISTRATION: The owner of an unregistered aircraft may apply for registration at any time. 
Application for registration must be made in accord with 14 CFR Section 47.31(a), which requires an Aircraft 
Registration Application, AC Form 8050-1, evidence of ownership (unless it is already on file at the Aircraft 
Registration Branch), and the $5 registration fee. Please note, if application for registration is made after 
the aircraft's N-number has been canceled, the aircraft may not use the temporary operation authority 
provided for in 47.31(c) because the aircraft was not last previously registered in the U.S. 
OTHER CHANGES: Aircraft owners are still required to notify the FM Aircraft Registration Branch when 
their aircraft have been sold, exported, or destroyed. etc. These reports may be made by returning the 
Certificate of Aircraft Registration AC Form 8050-3 with the reverse side filled-out and signed. If the 
certificate is not available a letter may be sent. It should fully describe the aircraft and report the aircraft's 
change of status. If the aircraft has been sold, please provide the purchaser's name and address. 
FEE PAYMENT by mail should be by check or money order payable to the Federal Aviation Administration.
