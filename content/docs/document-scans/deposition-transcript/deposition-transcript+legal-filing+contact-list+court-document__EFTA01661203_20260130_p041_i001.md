be made with a single check or draft drawn on a US bank and payable in US dollars, or with a negotiable instrument 
payabet in US dollars and clearable through the US banking system, or through an electronic payment method payable in 
US dollars and clearable through the US banking system. Your Account number must be Included on all payments. If 
payment does not conform to these requirements, crediting may be delayed and additional Charges may be imposed. If we 
accept payment made in a foreign currency, we will choose a conversion rate that is acceptable to us to convert your 
payment Into US dallarS„ unless a particular rate is recuired by law. Please do not send post-dated checks. They will be 
dopes ted upon receipt. Our acceptance of any payment markecl with a restrictive legend will not operate as an accord and 
satisfaction without our express prior written approval. Authorization for Electronic Debit: We will process checks 
electronically, at first presentment and any re-presentments, by transmitting the amount of the check, routing number, 
account number and check serial number to your financial institution, unless the check is not processatie electronically or a 
less costly process is available. By submitting a check for payme nt you authorize us to initiate an electronic debit from your 
bank or asset account. When we process your check electronically, your payment may be debited to your bank or asset 
account as scon as the same day we receive your check, and you will not receive that cancelled check with your bank or 
asset account statement. If we cannot collect the funds electronically we may issue a draft against your bank or asset 
account for the amount of the check. Authorization for Electronic Payments: By using Pay By Computer, Pay By Phone 
or any other electronic payment service of ours, you will be authorizing us to initiate an electronic debit to the financial 
account you specify in the amount you request. Payments received after 5:00 p.m. MST may not be credited until the next 
day. Allocation of Payments and Credits: Subject to applicable law, we will apply and allocate payments and credits 
among Features and Charges on your Account in any order and manner determined by us in our sole discretion. Finance 
Charges: Average Daily Balance (ADB) Method for Calculation of Finance Charges (FC): We use the ADB 
Method to caculate FC on your Account. Under this method, we figure the FC on your Account by applying the Daily 
Periodic Rate (DPR) to the ADB (as described below) for each Feature (including current transactions). Different daily 
periodc rates may be applied to separate Feature balances. To get the ADB for each feature, we (1) take the beginning 
balance for each day (including unpaid FC from previous tilling periods) (2) add any new transactions, debts, or fees (3) 
subtract any payments or creths, and (4) make any appropriate adjustments. For each day after the first day of the biking 
period, we also add an amount of interest equal to the previous day's daily balance multiplied by the CPR for the 
Feature. This gives us the daily balance for the Feature for that day and the beginning balance for that Feature for the next 
day. If this balance is negative, it is considered to be zero. Then, we add up all the daily balances for the Feature for the 
billing period and divide the total by the number of days in the tiling period. This gives us the ADB for the Feature. If you pay 
the New Balance on this statement by the next Closing Date, then you will avoid additional FC on features included in ills 
New Balance. If you multiply the ADB for each Feature by the number of days in the billing period and the DPR for that 
Feature, the resvit will be the FC assessed on that Feature, except for variations caused by rounding. The total FC for the 
tilling period is calculated by adding the FC assessed on all Features of the Account. This method of calculably the ADB 
and FC results in daily compounding of FC. Transactions Made In Foreign Currencies: If you incur a Charge in a 
foreign currency, it will be converted into US dollars on the date it is processed by us or our agents. Unless a particular rate is 
lectured by applicable law, we will choose a conversion rate that is acceptable to us for that date. Currently, the conversion 
rate we use for a Charge in a foreigncurrency is no greater than (a) the highest official converaon rate published by a 
government agency, or(o) the highest interbank conversion rate identified by us from customary banking sources, on the 
conversion date or the pnor business day, in each Instance Increased by 2%. This conversion rate may differ from rates 
in effect on the date of your charge. Charges converted by establishments (such as airlines) will be tilled at the rates such 
establishments use. Billing Rights Summary : In Case of Errors or Questions About Your Bill: If you think your toll is 
Incorrect, or it you need more information about atransaction on your bill, write us on a separate sheet of paper at the 
Customer Samoa address noted to the right. We must hear from you no later than 60 days after we sent you the fast bill on
