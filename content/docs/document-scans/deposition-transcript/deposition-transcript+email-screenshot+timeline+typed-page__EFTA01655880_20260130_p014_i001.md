Former FBI Agent Gives Insight on Columbus, Ohio Cyberattack 
WBNS (CBS-10) (08/15, Jabour) reported that cybersecurity expert Connor Goodwolf said last week that 45% of the 
data stolen from the city of Columbus is now on the dark web. The other 55% of data the hackers sold that data to 
a buyer, according to Goodwolf. The article noted that Bret Hood, a former special agent of the FBI for 25 years, 
gave insight into how the FBI could be handling the case for the city of Columbus. The article quoted Hood, who 
said, "The FBI has contacts all throughout the world. So, it sounds like somebody hacked into Columbus' database 
and was able to retrieve that information. The first thing the FBI would have to do is try to figure out where the 
source was, who came in and where they are located. That takes a lot of effort, the FBI will never pay a ransom. 
They will leave it up to the entity involved. Whether the government, private business. That is their decision. The 
data leak from the city prosecutor's office is pretty damning. There are all kinds of potential information out there 
whether it's informants, victims and associated identifying information that allows people who have less than 
honest thoughts to pursue those people. Maybe try to gain leverage with them or exploit them for uses."

after the country's justice minister gave his approval on Thursday. Dotcom, who was born in Germany but has New

sharing site Megaupload, which was shut down by the U.S. government the same year. The article mentioned 
that New Zealand Justice Minister Paul Goldsmith has now signed an extradition order for Dotcom, according to a

flamboyant founder of Megaupload, a website which was used by millions as a fast and easy way to store massive 
files in a "locker" online and share them with others. Soon after his site was shut down, Dotcom was arrested by 
New Zealand police who descended on his luxury mansion in Auckland by FBI order in two marked helicopters and 
had to cut their way into a locked safe room to reach him. Reuters (08/15, Jackson, Craymer), BBC (08/15, Aikman),
