In an effort to share tips and advices learned through many years of surveying damages on various 
vessels, Captain William Howe has prepared the following list of TIPS FOR MARINERS 
When preparing a vessel for the 
approach of a tropical wave, depression, 
tropical storm or hurricane, be sure to 
close all seacocks, except the cockpit 
scupper seacocks. Leave the cockpit 
scuppers open to allow rain water and 
sea spray to drain out of the cockpit. 
During one tropical storm, a large 
sailboat was blown onto sotl sand in 
shoal water and would have suffered 
minimal damage However, since the 
galley and head sink seacocks were left 
open, seawater flooded the vessel while 
the yacht was careened on its side. The 
interior was partially filled with 
seawater, causing damage to the engine, 
refrigeration, electrical systems and 
cabinetry. It was an unnecessary loss. 
If you have the time when preparing for 
the arrival of a hurricane or tropical 
storm. consider removing your vessel'k 
lifelines and the vertical pieces of your 
two niece stanchions (base & vertical) 
from their bases along the gunwale of 
your sailboat. 
If you are ashore in a sate haven, you 
will not need the lifelines and stanchions 
to hold on to during the storm. If they 
are removed, that will keep them 
undamaged and they cannot engage 
stanchions or lifelines on a neighboring 
boat and cause unneeded damage.

3. 
If you are securing your sailboat 
alongside other sailboats in a rafting or 
marina setting, stagger the adjacent 
sailboats so that the mast, spreaders and 
standing rigging of your boat will not 
engage the neighboring boats. 
During a storm, the wind and waves will 
hit each boat at a different time and each 
boat will respond and roll differently It' 
your masts are adjacent to one another. 
there is a strong chance that they will 
catch on one another, causing unneeded 
damage. Move your boat fore or all to 
keep the spars and rigging apan.

Boat/US has done research showing that 
polyester (Dacron) dock lines resist 
chafe much better than nylon In fact. 
they have conducted experiments that 
showed that nylon anchor or dock lines 
would melt when mounted within rubber 
hose or tubing chafe gear!' Apparently. 
the friction between the strands of the 
stretchy nylon line, created so much heat 
that the nylon line was able to part 
The recommendation from Boat 'ti is to 
use polyester lines at chafe points \lake 
a short polyester pennant that passes 
over the bow chock or by the bobstay to 
use between the bow anchor and the 
anchor line. Use the nylon line where 
you want to have the strength and the 
stretching behavior. Use the polyester 
line at the chafe points
