for follow-up. 
On or about Tuesday October 4, 2005 at approximately 0928 hours, I responded to 358 
El Brillo and met with PB Sanitation worker Jeff Williams. I observed Williams 
enter the driveway of 358 El Brillo and remove several plastic bags of trash and 
place the contents into the side well of the sanitation truck. This side of the 
truck is separate from the rear of the truck and does not come into contact with 
other Crash. 
I then followed Williams to a predetermined location and seized the trash from the 
truck. The trash was transported to the Palm Beach Police Department where I began 
sifting through its contents. There were a total of 2 white in color plastic bags 
which were tied at the top. Each of the bags contained documentation and 
correspondence for 358 El Brillo and Jeffrey Epstein. 
All documents of evidentiary 
value were removed and turned over to Det.

On Friday, October 7, 2005 at approximately 0923 hours, I responded to 358 El Brillo 
and met with PB Sanitation worker Jeff Williams. I observed Williams enter the 
driveway of 358 El Brillo and remove several plastic bags of trash and place the 
contents into the bed of an empty sanitation truck. 
I then followed Williams to a predetermined location and seized the trash from the 
truck. The trash was transported to the Palm Beach Police Department where I began 
sifting through its contents. There were a total of 3 bags, one of which was white 
in color and tied in a knot at the top, and the other two bags were black in color. 
One bag contained documentation and correspondence for Jeffrey Epstein, which was
