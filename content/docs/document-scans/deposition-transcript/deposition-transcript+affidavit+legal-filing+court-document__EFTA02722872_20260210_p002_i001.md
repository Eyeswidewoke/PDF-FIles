chip, create most of the capabilities that you would have found in Sputnik, but, of course, orders 
of magnitude faster," says Mason Peck, a former chief technologist at NASA and now a 
professor at Cornell University. 
The most ambitious project to date is a flock of 28 nanosats, each one three CubeSats in size (ie, 
30cm long). These were carried to the ISS in January and released in batches (pictured at the 
beginning of this article) through a sort of satellite shooter developed by NanoRacks, an 
American company. These nanosats came from Planet Labs, a firm based in San Francisco. The 
satellites now take pictures as they scan the Earth more frequently than traditional ones and at a 
fraction of the cost, albeit at a lower resolution. 
Planet Labs, funded modestly with $65m of private investment, says its nanosats provide much 
of the performance of a conventional satellite for a fraction of the cost. That reflects a lot of 
antiquated technology in the space business, much of which can be bettered by the latest off-the-
shelf equipment, says Will Marshall, Planet Labs' boss. There are other cost-savin measures. 
Satellites are usual] built in elaborate clean rooms, but 
The company expects to put another 100 
nanosats into orbit in the next 12 to 18 months. 
A few miles away, in another modest San Francisco office, Nanosatisfi is working on its 
ArduSats. These arc open-source platforms and two have already gone up. They will contain an 
array of sensors and can carry out various missions, such as locating things. More than 250,000 
ships, for instance, now broadcast an automatic identification signal than carries about 50 
nautical miles. A fleet of small satellites in low orbit could pick up these signals and provide 
frequent updates about the ships' positions without the vessels having to use costly dedicated 
satellite uplinks. Such a system might have been able to track Malaysian Airlines flight MH370, 
which went missing in March. 
Farther south in Mountain View, Skybox captures high-resolution imaging data from its first 
satellite in orbit as it prepares another 23 to launch in the coming years. Some things, though, 
can be shrunk only so far and larger satellites arc needed for a telesco 
to obtain the hi er 
resolutions required for the firm's analysis. 
fairly common size for small satellites, the firm proved its concept to investors using CubeSats. 
"Being able to put something in space at very low cost allows you to demonstrate the 
technology to get more money," says Dan Berkenstock, one of the company's founders. 
The CubeSat specification came out of the academic world in the late 1990s. Bob Twiggs, then 
at Stanford University and now at Morehead State University, was frustrated by long delays on a 
large-satellite programme and set about thinking how much satellite capability might be 
crammed into a much smaller craft that could be launched cheaply. Space launches usually 
comprise one or more primary payloads and require ballast to balance the rocket. CubeSats, 
reasoned Mr Twiggs, could take the place of some of this ballast, so long as they did not 
jeopardise the main mission. The optimum size Mr Twiggs came up with was based on a box 
used to display Beanie Babies. Later, with Jordi Puig-Suari of California Polytechnic State 
University, it was turned into a full specification. Mr Twiggs also developed the 5cm 
PocketQube, which has a maximum weight of 180 grammes.
