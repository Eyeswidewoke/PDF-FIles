Important Disclosures 
This presentation does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any securities, which will only be made pursuant to definitive written offering documents (the 
"Definitive Documents") which describe risks related to an investment therein and which quality in their entirety the information set forth herein. This presentation has been 
prepared on a confidential basis and does not constitute part of any such Definitive Documents. Such Definitive Documents should be read carefully prior to any investment in GTIS 
Qualified Opportunity Fund LLC (the "Fund"). Any reproduction or distribution of this presentation in whole or in part, or the disclosure of any of its contents, without the prior 
consent of GTIS Partners ("GTIS"), is prohibited. 
This presentation contains forward-looking statements that are not historical facts and are based upon certain assumptions. These forward-looking statements include statements, 
express or implied, regarding the current expectations, estimates, projections, opinions and beliefs of GTIS, as well as the assumptions on which those statements are based. Words 
such as "believes," "expects," "endeavors," "anticipates," "intends," "plans," "estimates," "projects," "should" and "objective" and variations of such words and similar words also 
identify forward-looking statements. Such statements are forward-looking in nature and involve a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, including 
those described in this presentation, and accordingly, actual results may differ materially and no assurance can be given that GTIS will achieve the returns from its investments that it 
is targeting. 
There can be no assurance that unrealized investments will be realized at the valuations or projections shown, as actual realized returns will depend on, among other factors, future 
operating results, the value of the assets and market conditions at the time of disposition, any related transaction costs, and the timing and manner of sale, all of which may differ 
from the assumptions on which the valuations and projections contained herein are based. Nothing contained herein should be deemed to be a prediction or projection of future 
performance. There can be no guarantee or assurances that similar investment opportunities will be available in the future or that the Fund will realize similar returns on these 
investments. GTIS is pursuing the opportunities in the Fund's investment pipeline described herein to varying degrees; however, there can be no assurances that pipeline 
investments will be consummated by the Fund or otherwise. Investors in the Fund should be able to withstand a complete loss of their invested capital. An investment in the Fund 
will provide limited liquidity since the interests in the Fund are not freely transferable. There is no secondary market for the interests and none is expected to develop. An 
investment in the Fund is suitable only for sophisticated investors who do not require immediate liquidity for their investment and can bear the loss of their entire investment. See 
Certain Risk Factors Section for other risks. 
Unless otherwise indicated, all internal rates of return ("IRRs") and multiples on invested capital ("Multiples") contained herein are presented on a "gross" basis (i.e., before 
management fees, fund-level expenses, carried interest and similar items, which in the aggregate may be substantial). 
Certain economic and market information contained herein has been obtained from published sources prepared by other parties. While such sources are believed to be reliable, 
none of GTIS or its affiliates assumes any responsibility for such information. The data and charts presented in this presentation are intended to be actual, historical data or 
otherwise are intended to be hypothetical illustrations of mathematical principles. 
The opinions herein do not take into account prospective investors' circumstances, objectives, or needs and are not intended as recommendations of particular securities, financial 
instruments or strategies to any prospective investors. This presentation is not intended to constitute legal, tax or accounting advice, or investment recommendations. Recipient 
should make its own investigations and evaluations of the information contained herein. Recipient should consult its own attorney, business adviser and tax adviser as to legal, 
business, tax and related matters concerning the information contained herein. No securities commission or regulatory authority in the United States has in any way passed upon 
the merits of an investment in the Fund or the accuracy or adequacy of this presentation or the material contained herein. Additional information about GTIS and the Fund is 
available upon request. Recipient is cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements or examples included herein, GTIS assumes no obligation to update any 
forward-looking statements as a result of new information, subsequent events or any other circumstances. Such statements speak only as of the date they were originally made.
