hs no time . Im not sure of your pla=s.re <http://plans.re> work. 
I have tried to understand , i am respectfu= of your 
charitable work, . I think if i were in your place i might hav= brought back a souvevir or some sign of a modicum of 
apprecation for havi=g an apt in ny . and the assistance from me that you have received, =AO I know you are smart. if 
this is all about money, lets h=ve the discussion. It might be awkward for you , i will wait to h=ve it on your time, 
you tell me you want to be productive , independent and free. <=r>

Thank you for always taking the time. I appreciate a ha=sh word or five. I do well with criticism. Though 
It was a little hyperbol=c of your buddy to tell me he wouldn't hire me as a waitress. Please. =et's not get carried away. I 
learned to read in first grade so I would=never have to do a job like that. And I'm not in NY to look for a &quo=;busy 
work" job. I don't need to leave LA for that. I can just wo=k as a receptionist in a dentist's office. 
I don't like to defend my seriousness. Or my intent=ons for working with an NGO I've been involved with 
most of my life. I='s the only organization that has made any difference in that region a=d I will always support it. If one 
can help -- one measly week out of an e=tire year where one otherwise indulges oneself -- then one should. My moth=r 
and father are involved and right now, while I don't have money to d=nate, I can donate my time and I do. But I DO 
understand that if I were gu=g-ho about any old job at Phaidon I would be doing photocopies for =eon while he's in 
Greece. No question about it. And banging down his d=or instead of waiting for him to show me what's on offer. But 
there IS=no job, and Phaidon is not a place where I can magically create a position= I'm either in Editorial or I'm in Sales. 
It's pretty simple. =t's an antiquated business and it's not going to change any time s=on. I'm not going to become more 
serious because I helped to put toget=er a book here or there when I'm not on staff as an editor with the au=onomy to 
commission several projects at once. I'm not a 23 year old aristant. Freelance publishing (god knows if that even exists) 
also isn'= a real way to make money. If there's not enough money in showbiz ther= CERTAINLY isn't enough money in
