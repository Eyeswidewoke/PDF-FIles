Amendment No. 3 to Form S-1 
Jahk of Contents 
The company and its officers, directors and holders of substantially all of the company's common stock have agreed with the 
underwriters, subject to certain exceptions, not to dispose of or hedge any of their common stock or securities convertible into or 
exchangeable for shares of common stock during the period from the date of this prospectus continuing through the date that is 180 days 
after the date of this prospectus, except with the prior written consent of the representatives. Pursuant to this agreement, among other 
exceptions, we may enter into an agreement providing for the issuance of our common stock in connection with the acquisition, merger 
or joint venture with another publicly traded entity during the 180-day restricted period after the date of this prospectus. This agreement 
does not apply to any existing employee benefit plans. See "Shares Eligible for Future Sale" for a discussion of certain transfer 
restrictions. 
At our request, the underwriters have reserved up to 5% of the shares offered by this prospectus for sale within the United States 
to some of our directors, officers, employees, business associates and related persons. If these persons purchase reserved shares it will 
reduce the number of shares available for sale to the general public. Any reserved shares that are not so purchased will be offered by 
the underwriters to the general public on the same terms as the other shares offered by this prospectus. 
Prior to the offering, there has been no public market for the shares. The initial public offering price has been negotiated among 
the company and the representatives. Among the factors to be considered in determining the initial public offering price of the shares, in 
addition to prevailing market conditions, will be the company's historical performance, estimates of the business potential and earnings 
prospects of the company, an assessment of the company's management and the consideration of the above factors in relation to 
market valuation of companies in related businesses. 
We have been approved to list our common stock on the NYSE under the symbol "ABS." In order to meet one of the requirements 
for listing the common stock on the NYSE, the underwriters have undertaken to sell lots of 100 or more shares to a minimum of 400 
beneficial holders. 
In connection with the offering, the underwriters may purchase and sell shares of common stock in the open market. These 
transactions may include short sales, stabilizing transactions and purchases to cover positions created by short sales. Short sales 
involve the sale by the underwriters of a greater number of shares than they are required to purchase in the offering, and a short position 
represents the amount of such sales that have not been covered by subsequent purchases. A "covered short position" is a short position 
that is not greater than the amount of additional shares for which the underwriters' option described above may be exercised. The 
underwriters may cover any covered short position by either exercising their option to purchase additional shares or purchasing shares in 
the open market. In determining the source of shares to cover the covered short position, the underwriters will consider, among other 
things, the price of shares available for purchase in the open market as compared to the price at which they may purchase additional 
shares pursuant to the option described above. "Naked" short sales are any short sales that create a short position greater than the 
amount of additional shares for which the option described above may be exercised. The underwriters must cover any such naked short 
position by purchasing shares in the open market. A naked short position is more likely to be created if the underwriters are concerned 
that there may be downward pressure on the price of the common stock in the open market after pricing that could adversely affect 
investors who purchase in the offering. Stabilizing transactions consist of various bids for or purchases of common stock made by the 
underwriters in the open market prior to the completion of the offering. 
The underwriters may also impose a penalty bid. This occurs when a particular underwriter repays to the underwriters a portion of 
the underwriting discount received by it because the representatives have repurchased shares sold by or for the account of such 
underwriter in stabilizing or short covering transactions.
