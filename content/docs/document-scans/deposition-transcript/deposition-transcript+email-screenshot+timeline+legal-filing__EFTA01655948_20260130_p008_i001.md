came to help the deputies. During the altercation, the off-duty FBI agent discharged his gun, and it hit the resident 
in the chest. The resident, Harold Chamberlain, Jr., 61, was taken to the hospital, where he later died. SCSO said 
there wasn't enough evidence to proceed with criminal charges against the off-duty FBI agent, identified as 
Benjamin Spinale, 43, for fatally shooting Chamberlain. However, while the investigation was going on, several 
victims came forward and said Spinale had allegedly brandished his firearm at them recently while he was off-duty 
in the neighborhood. The article mentioned that as a result, Spinale was charged with four counts of brandishing a 
firearm. Potomac Local News (05/21, Staff Writer), and WUSA (CBS-9) (05/21, Pusatory) also reported on the story.

KSWO (ABC-7) (05/21, Allison) reported that the investigation into a deadly shooting in Atoka County is now being 
handled by the FBI. Alva Fortenberry was found dead on May 4, in a woman's yard. According to the article, one 
person had been initially taken into custody in connection to the death but they were not identified, and no

Mobster Ralph Deleo Plotted to Kill Federal Officials Who Put Him Away, Court Docs Show 
WPM (CW-12) (05/21, Sherman, White) reported that FBI agents allege Ralph DeLeo, a former reputed street boss 
of the Colombo crime family, was arrested this month for plotting to kill at least three people who helped put him 
behind bars in 2012, according to newly filed court documents. The article noted that the Massachusetts U.S. 
Attorney's Office revealed in the court documents that federal agents "received a tip from a confidential source 
reporting that DeLeo is actively planning to kill two current and one former federal official." The federal officials 
were all involved in DeLeo's conviction more than a decade ago, according to court documents. The article 
mentioned that DeLeo, 82, was arrested on May 15, but federal officials didn't publicly release details about his 
arrest until filing the new court documents on Tuesday night. DeLeo's criminal history dates back decades and the 
FBI alleged he served in the 1970s as an associate of the Patriarca crime family, which operated out of 
Providence. In 2012, DeLeo was sentenced to more than 16 years in prison for racketeering, among other crimes. 
He got out of prison under supervised release in May 2024, and federal agents alleged he's recently been planning 
to kill the people who put him away. 
New York Man Offered Farmer Wild Turkey Bourbon to Let Him Feed Girlfriend's Ex to Hogs 
The New York Post (05/21, Khan) reported that an upstate New York man tried to hire a hitman to murder his 
girlfriend's ex — then offered a farmer $1,000 and a bottle of Wild Turkey bourbon to feed the victim to his hogs, 
authorities said. According to the article, the entire thing was a set-up, and both the hitman and the farmer were 
working for the feds, according to a criminal complaint. Jeal Sutherland, 57, pleaded guilty last week to the use of 
interstate commerce facilities in the commission of murder-for-hire after the hitman he hired turned out to be an 
informant for the Department of Justice and the farmer he bribed turned out to be an FBI agent. Sutherland 
wanted his girlfriend's ex murdered and his body disposed of as soon as the would-be victim was released from 
state prison at the end of January, according to a federal criminal complaint. The plot was foiled by the FBI and now 
Sutherland faces between seven and nine years in prison, however U.S. District Court Judge Mae D'Agostino can 
impose a shorter prison term at Sutherland's sentencing in September. "Mr. Sutherland's diabolical plot intended to 
violently end a man's life and intimidate his family," FBI Special Agent in Charge Craig L. Tremaroli said. "Thanks to 
the swift actions taken by FBI Albany and our law enforcement partners, that plan never came to fruition." 
Bryan Kohberger Case Leak Could Lead to Excluded Evidence, Idaho Attorney Warns 
Fox News (05/21, Sabes, Ruiz) reported that an Idaho-based lawyer said she thinks Judge Steven Nippier will 
"absolutely" hold prosecutors and law enforcement accountable after sensitive information about the Bryan 
Kohberger quadruple murder case was leaked. According to the article, a TV episode about the murders of four 
University of Idaho students was aired on May 9 and featured new cellphone records, surveillance video, search 
records and more. Kohberger is accused of killing Xana Kernodle, 20, Kaylee Goncalves, 21, Madison Mogen, 21, 
and Ethan Chapin, 20. New information about the murders was shared during the May 9 NBC "Dateline" program, 
which included surveillance video from a nearby house. The surveillance video showed a car similar to Kohberger's 
that was in the area of the King Road house several times just before the four students were killed. The article 
stated that the program also claimed that FBI cellphone tower data showed that Kohberger's cellphone pinged 
nearly a dozen times to a tower that provides coverage to an area within 100 feet of 1122 King Road, where he 
allegedly killed the four students. Edwina Elcox, a criminal defense attorney in Boise, Idaho, told Fox News Digital 
she thinks Hippler is taking the leak very seriously. Elcox said she "absolutely" thinks it's possible for evidence
