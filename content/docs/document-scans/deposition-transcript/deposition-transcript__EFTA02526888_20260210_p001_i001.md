admitting that the=omelletes you made were even in your words , not good . no you chose to=serve it to me„ the first

I just spo=e with sarah to see where she buys this special granola for you.. 
PUBL=X ! The greek yogurt and fruit she gives you - all from PUBLIX! And you te=l ME I don't understand quality. 
I looked for a healthy granola at the=best stores and actually spent time getting good food for you. You yell at=ME 
without having any facts you assume the shit granola you had from sarah=must be top quality...just like Marina market 
eggs Lance was feeding you i=stead of fresh. When are you actually going to realize I put more effort =nto finding good 
things for you than the people you use as examples. This =s unbelievable! You have an opinion about where the food is 
bought when yo= haven't been to grocery stores and compared them in what - 2years, 5,=10 ? I do it 4 times every week 
and I do not shop at publix and pass the f=od to you as the best quality healthy food I can get. And instead of a tha=k 
you, you start fights with me without knowing the facts.
