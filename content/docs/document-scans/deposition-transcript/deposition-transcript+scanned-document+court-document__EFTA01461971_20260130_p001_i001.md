saga in the country, raising doubts about any possibility of a remedy to be 
offered at any time. 
By the time we went to press, Bloomberg news reported that an attempt by a 
group of Argentine banks to buy about $1.5b of defaulted bonds off holdout 
creditors also failed after a meeting in New York. This notwithstanding, it 
seems that a private sector involvement, after Minister Kicillof speech, 
could still offer a better opportunity to close the gap currently existing 
between the government and holdouts, though it remains unclear whether Judge 
Griesa would be willing to accept such an outcome. 
In any case, default is now a fact. To our understanding, the deadline for 
the payment to be made to the clearing house was 7PM Eastern time yesterday. 
This will provide a basis to trigger cDs and a reason for bond acceleration, 
though we continue to be of the idea that acceleration would be unlikely. It 
was very unfortunate that the market had a dramatic rally on the same day 
default took place, before it would likely sell off even more dramatically 
the following day. For those who wonder what would happen after default, our 
piece put out on Tuesday (see Argentina: will there be life after default?) 
should still be relevant - with the caveat that the baseline scenario 
described in that piece may look a bit too rosy after yesterday's event. 
FOMC: slightly more hawkish 
The FOMC evidently intended not to make any significant changes in its policy 
guidance. However, DB's Peter Hooper thinks the statement was slightly more 
hawkish than the preceding edition on balance judging by the tone, with a 
change in wording on the labor market that leaves them about where they were 
as of the June meeting and some changes in wording on inflation that advances 
them a bit closer to lift off. Looking ahead, he expects tapering will be 
completed on schedule in October, and, more importantly, if the next two 
labor reports and various wage and price inflation data show positive trends 
in the weeks ahead, the September FOMC message could begin to signal more 
clearly an exit process, including initial rate hikes, that could be moved up 
to the first half of 2015. 
Colombia: BanRep to continue hiking 
we expect the monetary board of Banco de la Republica to increase by 25bps 
the intervention rate on the meeting today taking it to 4.25% after four 
consecutive hikes. This hike is expected by market participants after the 
pickup in inflation and GDP growth in the first half of the year. In our 
view, while the curve seems fair at the very front end (75bp of implied hikes 
till December) the markets continue to price an overly aggressive BanRep for 
2015. we continue estimating around 50bp of premium priced for 2015, which 
should be supportive for short end receivers (IBR 6M1Y captures the bulk of 
the premium, displaying around 5bp/month of carry) and the front end of 
TES16. Also see Data Flash - Colombia.
