very fed up. The list was already prepared and on the bed . you are just so self absorbed, you 
couldn;t wait before you started to nag.. Its not working. goodnight,

I've been organizing your house, cleaned, made a cake for your return, bought you new clothes, offered my help, shopped for 
Paris supplies today, my attitude has been playful, 1 haven't mentioned a girl since I saw you, I very much enjoyed our walk, I 
organized fun for today and I reminded you that today is time for you to do your part as agreed 2 months ago. You could have 
handed me the list you promised and we could have moved on. I had no interest to discuss it further but I wanted to see if you 
were actually going to do it. I waited to see if I can again trust you to keep some of the more important promises as we move 
on. But its not a surprise you are backing out. I forwarded the emails to you today so you see how clear it is. It could have been 
painless but it's a struggle again. Very simple deal, there is no gray area regarding what should have happened today. I have 
nothing to add to it and I see no reason to argue.

I am concerned that your focus is still on what you didn/t get. not what you did get. no inkling 
of warmth , caring, only i didn't get. no acceptance of the part you played. you make no 
connection to an inordinate amount of my saying if you don't conribute , you shouldn;t expect 
to receive . YOu have said that after a month you still nccd more time with Tina to even make 
a proposal for change.Take as much time as you need, in the past you have suggested we 
transitiion ( your words),I think we should agree on the details, in case our latest attempt fails. 
i have spent a great deal of time re reading our correpondence. It is not a pleasant read. I 
write over and over that i love you , and do not understand how you continue to ignore my 
needs. you write over and over that it is a new girl thatvis now in the way. and that is the 
reason for x not happening. I would like our story to have a happy ending. ( no pun intended ) 
. you said that one time i didnt let you read because i wanted you to help sarah, you ask me if 
i want food, in the morning and when hearing no, decide that must mean for the whole day or 
week- you point to flying as now somehow , i am stunting your growth with a selfish 
motivation, as opposed to realizing that you have flown over a hundreed hours. had help at
