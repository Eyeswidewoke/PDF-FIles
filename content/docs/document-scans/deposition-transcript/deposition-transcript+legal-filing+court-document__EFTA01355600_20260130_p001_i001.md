Secure Your Tax Records From Identity Theft 
Identity theft occurs when someone uses your personal information 
such as your name, SSN, or Other identifying information, without your 
permission, to commit fraud or other crimes. An identity thief may use 
your SSN to get a job or may file a tax retum using your SSN to receive 
a refund. 
To reduce your risk: 
• Protect your SSN, 
• Ensure your employer is protecting your SSN, and 
• Be careful when choosing a tax preparer. 
If your tax records are affected by identity theft and you receive a 
notice from the IRS. respond right away to the name and phone number 
printed on the IRS notice or letter. 
If your tax records are not currently affected by identity theft but you 
think you are at risk due to a lost or stolen purse or wallet, questionable 
credit card activity or credt report, contact the IRS Identity Theft Hotline 
at 1-800-908-4490 or submit Form 14039. 
For more information, see Pub. 5027. Identity Theft Information for 
Taxpayers. 
Victims of identity theft who are experiencing economic harm or a 
systemic problem, or are seeking help in resolving tax problems that 
have not been resolved through normal channels, may be eligible for 
Taxpayer Advocate Service (TAS) assistance. You can reach TAS by
