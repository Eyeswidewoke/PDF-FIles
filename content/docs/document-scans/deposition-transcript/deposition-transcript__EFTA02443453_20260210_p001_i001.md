You know what the biggest thing I get out of this time period? Not just with you or. or= 
or the other 2 heartbreak situations I have had simoultancausly? 
Is that I really, really, REALLY like, love and admire who I am! That it is still best to remain the 
loving, lightfid, genuine, caring person I am! And yes I can be tough, but that is the balance...; ) I 
am an amazing teacher, performer and human being as well... I just grin when I recognize that 
people miss out so much of the really good stuff.... Because I realize the gift of the tremendous 
adversity of my life till now is that "I get it!" How lucky and rich I am! And it is my time to 
reflect that on the outside too! 
Thank you for everything! And without you speaking as you did in just the timing you did I 
would never have tried out such short hair at this time...it was less traumatic! ; ) We'll see what I 
do in the future, but fun! 
You are amazing, I am happy to reached out to you the last years and sincerely hope that I was 
able to nurture your spirit at a time I instinctively knew you needed...my heart and intentions are 
pure: ) 
I was ever so sad at how you priced my worth and, felt like to me, bullied me on that... I know I 
am priceless... Hours of physical hard work, amazing intuition and knowing but bigger than all 
the HUGE heart and tremendous gifts from what I have lived... But that was perhaps just a test 
for me, just like a Susan Boyle's, to stand up and shine regardless of the unkindness and bullying! 
I am free! And feel happier and richer for it as my heart shines yet stronger...I love who I am! 
Something that came to me in all this is... Do you realize you have created around you a bunch of 
people that are afraid to speak up and live their truest selves? You are SO well intended and so 
often right that you have lost the trees through the forest and trample the individual so often in 
front of you! You don't know it but I have had a very nurturing affect on the people around 
you...naturally. I do not have ego when it comes to helping people, I wish to self-empower them, 
nudge them to be their greatest. It is my solution to a better place! I'll be great and shine at what 
I am good at and each other do the same! Pretty cool! Teacher...1 think you missed 
something! And you are smart enough to learn this and do something about it! You are someone 
who makes a big impact! And you are the one accountable for the negative you create...and when 
it comes to your attention to do something about it; ) 
Sending you love and the greatest of intentions!
