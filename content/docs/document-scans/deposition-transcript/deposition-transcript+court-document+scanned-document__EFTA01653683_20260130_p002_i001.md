normalizing predator behavior and gradually crossing boundaries in ever-increasing escalations toward sexual abuse. 
Over time, the misconduct expanded and ultimately became a pyramid scheme of sexual abuse, in which minor girls 
were paid to provide Epstein with sexualized "massages," which escalated to greater and more frequent instances of 
abuse, after which the girls were then encouraged and paid to bring others to perform "massages" that would lead to 
additional molestation. In doing so, Epstein and Maxwell established a cycle of abuse that affected hundreds of 
victims throughout the country. In an exceptionally short period for an investigation of this scope, the team sought 
and obtained an indictment for Epstein, and coordinated with FBI and the Department of Homeland Security to effect 
his arrest upon his return to the United States following lengthy travel abroad. 
Following Epstein's suicide, AUSAs 
and 
along with Special Agent 
M, 
Detective In, 
and Analyst 'Ma, continued to investigate the role and conduct of Maxwell, who had been 
Epstein's girlfriend, business partner, and co-conspirator. The team quickly assembled a powerful case against 
Maxwell, including by discovering and speaking to newly-identified additional victims. The AUSAs, FBI personnel, and 
Paralegal 
also each spent countless hours to ensure that all relevant evidence was secured and reviewed, 
including dozens of physical items, hundreds of electronic storage devices, and millions of pages of documents. In 
total, the investigative team obtained over a dozen search warrants, including for multiple properties and an entire 
private island, leading to the seizure and review of dozens of electronic devices containing many terabytes of 
materials. 
AUSAsM 
and 
also collectively conducted more than 400 interviews of 
more than 150 witnesses, including dozens of victims, in close collaboration with Victim Coordinator=, Special 
AgentM, and Detective 
Those interviews were undertaken in at least five different U.S. states and 
territories and two foreign countries. The case was especially challenging because many of the victims previously had 
experienced difficult interactions with law enforcement, either in the course of prior investigations of Epstein, in 
connection with their own unrelated personal conduct following their abuse, or both. 
The full investigation revealed that Maxwell had recruited, groomed, and enticed multiple minor girls to be assaulted 
sit
by Epstein, and ultimately that she herself had directly participated in numerous instances of abuse. 
. 
igation 
culminated in charges against Maxwell in July 2020. Following the indictment, AUSAM, 
, 
and 
-jointly 
drafted hundreds of pages of briefing addressing numerous defendant pretrial motions, including to 
dismiss, sever, and suppress evidence. 
Each member of the team worked tirelessly to overcome a zealous and well-funded defense case before and during 
Maxwell's trial by expertly preparing witnesses for testimony and lengthy cross-examination, navigating complex legal 
and expert-related issues, and closely coordinating with victims to ensure their stability and security before, 
throughout, and after trial. At trial, over the course of a month, AUSAsIM, 
, 
and IME 
elicited testimony from more than 20 witnesses, cross-examined several defense witnesses, and introduced 
approximately 380 exhibits. During the investigation and through trial, the team received invaluable assistance from 
Victim Coordinator 
who skillfully worked to provide crucial support to victims and to minimize additional 
trauma. Paralegal Specialist 
also provided critical help with the hundreds of exhibits, millions of pages of 
discovery, and well over 100 witness meetings and trial prep sessions. 
The efforts of the AUSAs, FBI personnel, and U.S. Attorney's Office staff assigned to this case were exceptional. The 
nominees demonstrated extraordinary determination, professionalism, and teamwork in working together seamlessly 
for years throughout the investigation, ultimately succeeding in obtaining Maxwell's convictions after a month-long 
trial. Those efforts are worthy of recognition because they revealed a decade of crime and exploitation by Maxwell 
and Epstein that had been underestimated or overlooked for years. Through the team's groundbreaking 
investigation, the full scope of the criminal enterprise was finally discovered, exposed, and punished. The team also 
accomplished all of these objectives while being the focus of unprecedented public interest. Finally, all members of 
the investigative team worked expertly with numerous victims, establishing relationships of trust and confidence with 
vulnerable individuals who ultimately were able to provide accounts of deep trauma, enabling the prosecution to 
move forward and ultimately be successful.
