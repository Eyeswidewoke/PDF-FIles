Your advisor seems to be in the past, a U.S. Born Aircraft doesn't need a Export CofA to return 
to the U.S. Register. Only de-Registration from Bermuda. 
Export C of A's is a thing of the past

Seller wants us to indemnify Seller for post Delivery operating costs or liabilities (not sure why 
we should have to) and wants us to add Seller and its recent owners and financiers as 
Additional Insureds on our policy for 2 years following the closing. ?? 
F. One of the provisions in the Agreement says that Seller will "transfer or procure the 
transfer, by way of the issue to the Buyer of a full warranty bill of sale, the full legal, equitable 
and beneficial, good and marketable title, to the Aircraft to the Buyer at delivery free of all liens 
and encumbrances" See 'Title' on page 3 of the draft. English drafting is always horrible, but 
does the fact that they need to include a provision to "procure the transfer" mean that Seller is 
not the current owner of the Aircraft? lwe want to contract directly with the owner 
G. English law is said to apply to this transaction. no 
purchase price from $26,500,000 to $25,000,000. 
B. Consistent with your prior email which stated that we would pay $2MM if we walked away without 
any reason (i.e., not related to any failures by Seller), reduced the second deposit from $1.5 
MM to $1 MM, so that together with the first deposit of $1 MM, the total transaction deposit will 
be $2 MM. 
C. I expanded the list of what constitutes "Records" of the Aircraft. 
D. I fine tuned some of the language for the Delivery Condition in which Seller is required to deliver the 
Aircraft - see Page 4 - and added a requirement that there be no history of any accidents, and 
the requirement specificaly as part of the Delivery Condition, that the Aircraft be delivered with 
an Export Certificate of Airworthiness required to export the Aircraft to and register it in the 
United States. 
E. it has to be US certified. i understand that a DAR must be hired , but there must not be something 
that prevents us cert 
F. I changed the time within which Buyer is required to start its full Pre-Purchase Inspection from 5 
business days after the execution of the Sale Agreement to 15 business days. I was not sure 
how much time Larry would need to put everything together and get someone reliable to 
oversee the inspection, so I gave him essentially 3 weeks to do so. 
G. Consistent with prior email, I added provisions in the offer to the effect that if the deal falls through 
as a result of Seller's breach, then our costs of inspection, travel, consultants, etc will be 
reimbursed by Seller in addition to our receiving the retum of our deposits. I also provided that 
the same would be true if Seller refused to correct $1.MM or less of discrepancies and that 
caused the agreement to be terminated.
