Table of Contrail 
Long-Term Incentive Compensation 
As described above, equity compensation is at the heart of our compensation philosophy. Prior to this offering, Holdings granted long-
term equity-based awards to our executives which were designed to promote our interests by providing our executives with the opportunity to 
acquire equity interests as an incentive for remaining in our service and aligning the interests of our executives with those of our ultimate equity 
holders. The long-term incentive awards were granted to our NEOs in the form of Holdings restricted stock and stock options. The Committee 
determined that granting our NEOs Holdings restricted stock, restricted stock units and stock options would meet our goals of fostering a culture of 
performance and commitment to our Company. Restricted stock serves as a retention tool for us and stock options serve as components of 
performance-based compensation because they only provide value to our NEOs if the value of Holdings stock appreciates. All equity-based awards 
were granted under the 2007 Equity Plan. Following this offering. all equity-based awards will be granted by us. 
Fiscal 2014 Grants 
On February 10. 2014. annual grants of Holdings stock options were made to Messrs. Bisignano and Winborne and annual grants of 
Holdings restricted stock were made to Messrs. Bisignano, Plumeri and Winbome. with amounts determined in the sole discretion of the Holdings 
Committee after considering a variety of factors, including their existing equity holdings, the vesting dates/terms of such existing holdings, the size 
of annual equity grants awarded to similarly situated executive officers based on market data and our recent experience in hiring executives and a 
desire to provide awards to our executive officers that would be reasonable and equitable in light of their respective roles and responsibilities within 
the Company. The Holdings Committee did not use any specific commis in detennining the sizes of Holdings restricted stock and stock options 
granted to our named executive officers or assign any particular relative weightings to the various factors it considered but awarded long-term 
equity incentives in amounts that it believed were fair and reasonable in light of the factors listed above and would ensure that our executive 
officers have a continuing stake in our long-term success Subject to continued employment through the applicable vesting date, these Holdings 
stock options vest 33% per year on each of the first three anniversaries of the date of grant and these Holdings restricted stock awards vest on the 
later of January I, 2017 and the expiration of any underwriter-imposed transfer restrictions in connection with a Qualified Public Offering. 
A Qualified Public Offering is defined in the Management Stockholder Agreement to which all restricted shares granted to NEOs are 
subject as an initial public offering (1) for which aggregate cash proceeds to be received by Holdings (or any successor thereto, including the 
Company following the merger of Holdings with the Company) from such offering (or series of offerings) (without deducting underwriter
