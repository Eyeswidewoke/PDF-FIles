Wisconsin -- have gone down two very different paths. Today, Minnesota's unemployment rate is 3.6 percent -- far 
below the nationwide rate of 5.7 percent - while Wisconsin's job growth has been among the worst in the =egion and its 
income growth has been among the worst in the nation. 
Since his election,=Minnesota Governor Mark Dayton turned his state's budget deficit into a projected surplus of nearly 
$2 billion..C2* While Republican front-runner for the 2016 Presidential election, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker has 
swollen his stat='s budget deficit to a projected $2 billion. Meanwhile, Dayton has boost=d the minimum wage, invested 
in public education and supported workers' rights. (A=d Minnesota has the most union members of any state in the 
Midwest.) And Walker has slashed funding to public schools, and is dismantling the state&=39;s public university 
system. On March 9, he signed a bill that makes Wisconsin the 25th so-called right to work state, which, research 
shows, contrary to the hype, drives down wages and destroys good jobs. Why? All in an effort to eviscerate Wisconsin's 
labor unions.

Hasn't someone told Governor Wal=er that Trickle-Down Economics doesn't work and frankly and it =ever has. 
Therefore if we want to restore a healthy middle class, we need a different approach. If we want a stro=g middle class, 
which both Governors say that they want, then you can't take out the unions that b=ilt it. If you want good jobs with 
higher wages, then workers need a voice. If we want to restore a healthy middle class, we need a different approach, a 
virtuous cy=le that begins with a high-quality public education that gives students the sk=lls they need to get good jobs 
with fair wages, helping each generation climb t=e ladder of opportunity. Another crucial step is to enable more workers 
to fo=m and join unions. 
As Hillary Clinton recently noted, "The American middle =lass was built, in part, by the right for people to organize and 
bargain." And at Weingarten pointed o=t in her article Secretary Clinton is right. When unions were at their peak, more 
workers -- upwards of 50 percent -- were in the mi=dle class. Conversely, a decline in union membership - spurred on by 
trickle-down economics, ideological attacks and globalization -- is directly linked to the rise in income inequality. =At a 
time when only the wealthiest 10 percent have reaped the benefits of any gains in productivity, workers once again 
n=ed a voice on the job. Collective bargaining can lift all boats, even those boats that aren't carrying a =nion card. 
look at wages. In the heyday of the American labor movement, non-managerial workers' wages went up 75 percent. As 
unions have been o= the decline, these workers have only seen a four percent bump. Still, even toda=, union workers 
earn 28 percent more than nonunion workers. When two-thirds o= our economic activity is driven by consumer 
spending, it's critical tha= working families have more money in their pockets to spend. Broadly shared prosperity will 
remain elusive as long as workers' buying power is limi=ed.
