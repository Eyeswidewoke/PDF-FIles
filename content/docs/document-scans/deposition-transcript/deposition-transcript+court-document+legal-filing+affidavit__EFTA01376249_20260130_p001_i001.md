ARTICLE XIV 
MISCELLANEOUS 
Section 14.1. Form of Documents Delivered to Trustee. 
In any case where several matters are required to be certified by, or covered by an 
opinion of, any specified Person, it is not necessary that all such matters be certified by, or 
covered by the opinion of, only one such Person, or that they be so certified or covered by only 
one document, but one such Person may certify or give an opinion with respect to some matters 
and one or more other such Persons as to other matters, and any such Person may certify or give 
an opinion as to such matters in one or several documents. 
Any certificate or opinion of an Authorized Officer of either of the Co-Issuers or the 
Investment Manager may be based, insofar as it relates to legal matters, upon a certificate or 
opinion of, or representations by, counsel, unless such Authorized Officer knows that the 
certificate or opinion or representations with respect to the matters upon which his certificate or 
opinion is based are erroneous. Any such certificate of an Authorized Officer of either of the 
Co-Issuers or the Investment Manager or any Opinion of Counsel may be based, insofar as it 
relates to factual matters, upon a certificate or opinion of, or representations by, the Issuer, the 
Co-Issuer, the Investment Manager or any other Person, stating that the information with respect 
to such factual matters is in the possession of the Issuer, the Co-Issuer, the Investment Manager 
or such other Person, unless such Authorized Officer of the Issuer, the Co-Issuer, the Investment 
Manager or such counsel knows that the certificate, opinion or representations with respect to 
such matters are erroneous. 
Where any Person is required to make, give or execute two or more applications, 
requests, consents, certificates, statements, opinions or other instruments under this Indenture, 
they may, but need not, be consolidated and form one instrument. 
Whenever in this Indenture it is provided that the absence of the occurrence and 
continuation of a Default or Event of Default is a condition precedent to the taking of any action 
by the Trustee at the request or direction of the either of the Co-Issuers, then notwithstanding 
that the satisfaction of such condition is a condition precedent to such Co-Issuers' rights to make 
such request or direction, the Trustee shall be protected in acting in accordance with such request 
or direction if it does not have knowledge of the occurrence and continuation of such Default or 
Event of Default as provided in Section 6.1(d). 
Section 14.2. Acts of Holders: Voting Rights. 
(a) 
Any Vote provided by this Indenture to be given or taken by Holders may be 
embodied in and evidenced by one or more instruments of substantially similar tenor signed by 
such Holders in person or by an agent duly appointed in writing; and, except as herein otherwise 
expressly provided, such action shall become effective when such instrument or instruments are 
delivered to the Trustee, and, where it is hereby expressly required, to the Issuer. Such 
instrument or instruments (and action or actions embodied therein and evidenced thereby) are 
herein sometimes referred to as the "Act" of the Holders signing such instrument or instruments. 
Proof of execution of any such instrument or of a writing appointing any such agent shall be
