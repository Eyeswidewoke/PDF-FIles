I remembered that when we'd once discussed math—in particular, =n isosceles triangle—and I revealed I hadn't 
studied math since=l was 14 (such is, or was, the way of the British educational system), I re=eived a package at home 
via messenger. It was a book: "Math for idiot=." 
So he is not without humor, even though he doesn't drink or smoke, an= hates restaurants. 
"Jeffrey knows a good deal about most subjects," newspaper publ=sher Mort Zuckerman told me last week. He 
was certainly preaching to the co=verted. The truth is, Epstein does know a lot about a lot of things.=Just a few 
moments in his company and you know this to be true. 
When I saw pictures of Prince Andrew walking in Central Park with Jeffrey, =y immediate thought was that 
"Andy"—as Jeffrey calls him&=8212;is probably asking for help with his role as British trade envoy, or w=atever his 
strange title is. Because if one thing's for sure: When it=comes to international business, Jeffrey knows what he's talking 
abou= far more than "Andy" does. Which is why Leon Black, Mort Zucke=man and a few other financiers hang out with 
him. 
And Ghislaine? 
Full disclosure: I like her. Most people in New York do. It's almost =mpossible not to. 
She is always the most interesting, the most vivacious, the most unusual pe=son in any room. I've spent hours 
talking to her about the third worl= at a bar until 2am. She is as passionate as she is knowledgeable. She is c=rious. She 
has spent weeks at the bottom of the ocean, literally going deep=r than anyone else. She has sent me a DVD of the fish 
there. Her rolodex wo=ld blow away almost anyone else's I can think of—probably even =upert Murdochs'. She is very 
well-read and can talk about most things=for hours. She is passionate about Bill Clinton with whom she is close frie=ds. 
Yet, touchingly, when she had to give a speech at the 40th birthday party o= her best friend, Ariadne Calvo-
Platero, (known fondly to her close friends=as "the Tennis Goddess") Ghislaine shook a little with nerves. =hen it comes 
down to things she really cares about—and Ariadne is one=of them—Ghislaine shows her vulnerability. 
And that vulnerability is key to understanding her friendship with Jeffrey.=BR> 
"He saved her," I remember a close friend of mine telling me. &=8220; When her father died, she was a wreck; 
inconsolable. And then Jeffrey =ook her in. She's never forgotten that—and never will." 
In many ways, the socially awkward Epstein with his big house, plane, islan= and ranch was the perfect 
replacement for her father, the late Robert Maxw=ll, newspaper tycoon and criminal. Sure, Jeffrey had his sexual 
pecadillos,=but then Ghislaine's father was not without his oddities. After all, =t was he who died leaving a massive 
"black hole" he'd fra=dulently created. To Ghislaine, Jeffrey's habits may not have seemed =hat strange. 
In fact, she probably figured, rather like I have, after years of writing a=out he very rich, that most successful 
people in the end either have some w=ird habit (the late Bruce Wasserstein had the weight issues, the girl issue=, and 
moved countries to avoid paying tax), or they break the law (Sam Waks=l, Martha Stewart.) You don't tend to get to the 
top by being the wor=d's most balanced human being. Even the folksy Warren Buffett didnrs=17;t quite manage a 
normal life—whatever that is. He had a second :=20;wife" for many years whose existence he has been open about. 
So what to make of the current fuss over Ghislaine? I haven't spoken =o her or to Jeffrey, but I suspect that her 
loyalty to friends like Bill Cl=nton will keep her in good stead, in the end, she'll be out and about=as always. Look at 
Waksal and Stewart. No one sees them and thinks: crimina=. Au contraire. In this city, money makes up for all sorts of 
blemishes.
