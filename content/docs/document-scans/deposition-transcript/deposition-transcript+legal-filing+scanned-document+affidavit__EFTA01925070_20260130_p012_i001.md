and affiliates of RadNet Management, the lenders party thereto from time 
to time, and Barclays, as administrative agent and as collateral agent, 
pursuant to which RadNet Management has borrowed $180.0 million of 
new second lien term loans. 
• RadNet Management has the option of paying interest on the new term 
loans under the Second Lien Credit Agreement at either (a) the 
adjusted LIBOR rate plus 7.0% or (b) the base rate plus 6.0%. The 
interest rates payable on the new term loans under the First Lien 
Credit Agreement are the same as the rates currently payable under 
the First Lien Credit Agreement, which are (a) the adjusted LIBOR rate 
plus 3.25% or (b) the base rate plus 2.25%.  The adjusted LIBOR rate has 
a minimum floor of 1.0% on both the first lien term loans and the second 
lien term loans. In addition, RadNet Management has paid certain 
customary fees in connection with obtaining this financing. 
* After giving effect to this new senior debt financing. RadNet 
Management has approximately $415.3 million of senior secured first 
lien term loans outstanding under the First Lien Credit Agreement 
and $180.0 million of senior secured second lien term loans 
outstanding under the Second Lien Credit Agreement. In addition, the 
Company has access to a $101.3 million first lien revolving loan 
facility, which as of December 31, 2013 was undrawn. 
• Proceeds from the new first lien term loans and second lien term loans 
will be used in part to finance the payment of total consideration 
payable to holders of RadNet Management's $200.0 million in 
aggregate principal amount of 10 3/8% Senior Notes due 2018 (the 
"Notes") in connection with its previously announced offer to purchase any 
and all of its Notes through a tender offer (the "Tender Offer") and the 
related solicitation of consents to amend the indenture governing the Notes 
(the "Consent Solicitation"), and any related fees and expenses, in 
connection with the Tender Offer and Consent Solicitation. In addition, 
proceeds will also be used to pay fees and expenses related to the 
transaction and for general corporate purposes. 
* "We are very pleased to announce the completion of our refinancing 
transaction. We have successfully replaced our senior unsecured notes 
with a second lien term loan and additional borrowings under our existing 
credit facility, resulting in lower cash interest obligations of 
approximately $5.1 million per year. Additionally, the refinancing 
provides us with more operating flexibility and lengthens the maturity of our 
most junior debt capital." "With our first lien term loan due in 2018 and our 
new second lien term loan due in 2021, we face no near-term 
maturities. This allows our management time and attention to be 
dedicated to operating our business and driving strategic initiatives," 
• The deadline for the Consent Solicitation expired at 5:00 p.m., New 
York City time on March 20 2014 (the "Consent Payment 
Deadline"). At the Consent Payment Deadline, $193,464,000 aggregate 
principal amount of the Notes, representing 96.73% of the 
outstanding Notes, had been validly tendered and not withdrawn. As 
a result of the percentage of outstanding Notes tendered by the Consent 
Payment Deadline, the required consents were received with respect to the 
Consent Solicitation and the Company, RadNet Management, the 
subsidiaries of RadNet Management that are guarantors, and U.S. Bank 
National Association, a national banking association, as trustee (the 
"Trustee") entered into a supplemental indenture on March 21, 2014 which 
eliminated or modified certain restrictive covenants (not including the 
covenant to pay interest and premium, if any, on and principal of, the Notes 
when due), and eliminated or modified certain events of default and certain
