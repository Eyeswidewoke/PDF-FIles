that "If the Parties are unable to resolve the deadlock situation in accordance with 
Paragraph 3(A) above, then (Jacob's company] agrees to grant (Ian's company] a 
right to purchase (the "call option") all ordinary shares not owned by it at a price 
per share calculated in accordance with Paragraph 5 below." Thus, effectively 21 
days of indecision must pass before Ian even has the right to purchase Jacob's 
shares. Is that too long? Is there some shorter period that should be applied in 
emergency situations - e.g., What if the two Directors can not agree on emergency 
follow on bridge financing required by one of HAL's portfolio companies to stave off 
a business failure and loss of the portfolio investment? If it takes 21 days before 
even Ian has the right to Call the shares of Jacob, this may be too long. 
9. 
Call Option - There is no closing timeframe or provision relating to the 
closing mechanics for the call option. The call option provision in paragraph 3(B) 
provides only that if there is a deadlock (which will occur after 7 days), then 14 days 
after the deadlock, Ian is given a right to purchase Jacob's company's shares. How 
long will the purchase take? What are the closing procedures? 
10. 
Call Option - Should every decisional deadlock result in a Call option in favor 
of Osborne's company? Potentially chaotic. 
11. 
Call Option - Paragraph 3(B) - With respect to the call option, which takes 
place in a deadlock situation, Paragraph 3(B) provides that the call price is to be 
calculated "in accordance with Paragraph 5 below." However, there is no Paragraph 
5 in the Joint Venture Letter; the call price calculation provisions are in Paragraph 
3(C) of the Joint Venture Letter. This was very sloppy and confusing, 
12. 
Paragraph 3(C) - Price Per Share Calculations for the Call Option - Who 
makes the calculations of the Call price? What about disagreements about the 
calculation? Should there not be an appraiser? Do we need a joint appointment 
process? Given that this only arises in the case of a Deadlock, this could create a 
potential for serious delay during which time decision making could be frozen. 
Need to give Ian some more decision making latitude, such that once the deadlock 
time has passed and Ian calls the shares, Ian then has exclusive decision making 
authority, even while the closing of the call option is pending and even if it is 
delayed as a result of call price disputes, etc. 
13. 
What about transfer rights? Right of First Refusal? Non-transferability by 
Burda? Etc.? 
15. 
What happens to Joint Venture if Ian acquires all the shares? Does that result 
in a Termination Date for HAL as an investment fund? What if Ian becomes 
incapacitated or dies, will that result in a Termination Date for HAL as an 
investment fund? What about Jacob? The question is whether both have to be alive 
and in full capacity for HAL to continue on as an investment fund?
