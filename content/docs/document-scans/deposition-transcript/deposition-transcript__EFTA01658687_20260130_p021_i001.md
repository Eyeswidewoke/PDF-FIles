Man Pleads Guilty To Making False Bomb Threat To "Endanger Wife's Citizenship" 
Application. 
The Minneapolis Star Tribune (9/2, Furst, 1.04M) reports a man who made a "bogus allegation 
that his wife was planning to bomb the Mall of America pleaded guilty on Wednesday to one 
count of making a false bomb threat." Vincent Togbe Konney entered his "guilty plea before US 
District Judge Nancy Brasel in St. Paul." In his plea and documents "filed with the court, Konney 
admitted that on August 13, 2018, he wrote a letter falsely accusing his wife of being part of a 
plot to bomb the mall in Bloomington." Konney sent the letter to USCIS "to harm his wife, who 
was in the naturalization process at the time, the US Attorney's Office said." Using a false 
name, "Konney claimed in his letter that while he was riding a bus, he overheard two women 
discussing a plot to blow up the Mall of America." The case was investigated "by the FBI and 
prosecuted by Assistant US Attorney John Docherty." 
WCCO-AM Minneapolis (9/2, 14K) reports the act was in "retaliation against his wife who 
was in the naturalization process at the time." Officials "say Konney enclosed a photocopy of his 
wife's real Permanent Resident Card and urged the government to halt a 'terroristic threat' by 
deporting his wife." 
KSTP-TV Minneapolis-St.Paul, MN (9/2, 249K) reports his sentencing date "will be set at a 
later time." 
California Man In Plea Discussions Over Alleged School Threats. 
The Charlottesville (VA) Daily Progress (9/2, McKenzie, 94K) reports, "Federal prosecutors are 
working on a possible plea agreement with the attorneys of a former Charlottesville man 
charged this summer with threatening to blow up city schools if teachers were forced to go 
back into the classroom this fall." Lucas Isaiah Newton-Grant, 27, of Rancho Mirage, California, 
"the son of a local school teacher, is currently free on $10,000 unsecured bond, granted by the 
court at an Aug. 11 hearing, according to records in the U.S. District Court, Western District of 
Virginia. Newton-Grant was slated to be indicted by Aug. 27 on the charge of communicating 
interstate threats, but a federal judge granted a request from both the U.S. District Attorney's 
office and Newton-Grant's attorney to continue the indictment requirement until Sept. 23." 
Former UN Official Charged With Lying To The FBI. 
The AP (9/2) reports former UN telecommunications specialist Karim Elkorany "was arrested 
Wednesday on two counts of making false statements to federal law enforcement agents." He 
"resigned from the U.N. in early 2018, a few months after FBI agents questioned him outside 
his home about a woman who accused Elkorany of drugging and raping her in Iraq in 2016." 
The New York Times (9/2, Weiser, 18.61M) reports that the indictment said Elkorany "sexually 
assaulted or tried to sexually assault at least six women in Iraq, Egypt and the United States, 
among other locations." 
NJ News (9/2, 1.72M) reports that during a voluntary interview in November 2017, 
Elkorany "told the agents that the statements made by the woman to the UN were false and 
that he had not used drugs with the woman or provided them to her." 
WNBC-TV New York (9/2, 344K) reports that each charge "carries a maximum sentence of 
five years each in prison." 
Massachusetts Police Officers Charged With Overtime Fraud. 
The Boston Herald (9/2, 410K) reports that nine current and retired Boston police officers "have 
been charged with stealing $200,000 in a multi-year overtime fraud scheme, the FBI and US 
attorney's office announced Wednesday." US Attorney Andrew E. Lelling said in a statement, 
"These officers are charged with stealing taxpayer money, year after year, through fraud. 
Beyond the theft of funds, this kind of official misconduct also erodes trust in public institutions, 
at a time when that trust is most needed."
