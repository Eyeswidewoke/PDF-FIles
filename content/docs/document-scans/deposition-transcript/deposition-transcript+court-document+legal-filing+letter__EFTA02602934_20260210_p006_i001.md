Thank you for your reply.=C2 As you indicate that you are not being represented by counsel I will=reply directly 
to you, with a copy to Rich (as you suggest). Please consid=r: 
</=> 
1. 
As a starting point, let me note that I t=ink you and Rich may have misunderstood (at least initially) the 
terms of =he settlement that Harry proposed through his attorney. Rich and I discussed this in a call about 10 days ago 
and I'm hopi=g that misunderstanding has been cleared up, but as I'm not a part= to your exchanges (and Rich's 
exchanges) with Harry's att=rney I can't be sure. I'm also not certain whether t=e terms of the proposed settlement 
have changed. All I can say for sure is that=characterizing the offer as one in which distributions to you cannot excee= 
$100K per year is not consistent with my understanding of what has been orfered. 
The reason why the proposal is too outrageous=to discuss has nothing to do with the technicalities of the 
handout that H=rry is graciously offering. I'll review the background, once again. 
As I've discussed before, the Marital Tru=t was established in Carol's name for tax purposes. The obvious 
=ntention, clearly understood by Carol and me, and of course Eric Menouya, was that it would be available to the 
survivor -- Carol we assumed -- and =hen what remains would go to the beneficiaries. The idea that we int=nded that 
Carol would control "her" funds and I would control &q=ot;mine" is too ludicrous to discuss, though I understand the 
legalistic conjuring that can be adduced to reach this conclusion. =AO As you note, I was not working with you at the 
=ime you and Carol drew up your wills and trusts, but what you describe is not consistent with Eric's notes (which I 
have), nor w=th the facts as I understand them. You are right that tax savings we=e a major driver to the planning (and 
the plan did in fact result in substantial savings of both estate and income =axes) but it was not drafted with the 
expectation that Carol would survive=you. 
The question of who would be the survivor is irrele=ant. Carol and I assumed that she would be the survivor, 
but there w=s no reason to tell anyone, and it has no bearing at all on the fact that our intention was that the principal 
would be available to t=e survivor, then going to the children 
The decision to fund Carol's trust with both financial=assets and your Cape and Lexington homes was made 
when Carol was already i=l and (as far as the notes indicate) with the expectation that she would predecease you. 
This is quite surprising, and I would like som= clarification. Most important, I don't see how any significant 
=ecisions could have been made during those years, who could have made them= or why it was done. Obviously Carol 
could not have done so. She had to undergo massive brain radiation as soon=as the biopsy was taken, and serious 
cognitive and physical decline was im=ediate. Nor could I have been involved. I very much wanted to =eep her at home, 
rather than the only alternative -- a nursing home. I managed to do so for two years, until the end, =ut it required 24-
