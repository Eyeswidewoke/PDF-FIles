"We are not making major changes. We will preserve its tradition and the way it was," 
he said at a news conference near the ship's mooring. "It's a great vessel and it will 
continue its journey to serve the tourist sector in Dubai." 
The ship's fate has been the subject of intense speculation since its arrival in November 
2008. Officials have long been reluctant to address questions about its future, even as it 
sat unused and suggestions swirled that it could be moved to South Africa for the 2010 
World Cup or even sold for scrap. 
This past New Year's Eve, an event planning company hosted a black-tie bash onboard 
that included live music, fireworks and a laser light show. That was the first time the 
ship had hosted a large group of guests since it pulled into port. 
Istithmar bought the QE2 from the Cunard cruise line for $100 million in 2007. The 
company is part of Dubai World, the state conglomerate at the center of Dubai's 2009 
financial meltdown. Istithmar has been working to reduce its debt load, and in May lost 
control of upscale retailer Barneys New York as part of a deal with creditors. 
Bin Sulayem dismissed concerns about the cost of converting the QE2 into a working 
hotel, though he declined to say who was paying. Neither Istithmar nor the city-state's 
profitable port operator DP World, which Bin Sulayem also chairs, are paying for the 
project, he said. 
Britain's Queen Elizabeth II launched the QE2 in 1967. Since it went into service in 1969, 
the QE2 has made at least 26 round-the-world voyages.

lstithmar to Turn Queen Elizabeth Ship Into 300 Room Hotel 
By Tamara Walid - Jul 2, 2012 2:30 PM GMT+0400 
Istithmar World PJSC will turn its vessel Queen Elizabeth II into a 300-room hotel that 
will be operational in 18 months, Chairman Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem said in Dubai 
today. 
"Many banks will jump" to finance it, he told reporters, adding that neither OP World Ltd 
iDPW) which owns and operates Port Rashid in the emirate, nor its sister company 
lstithmar will finance the project. "This will not affect the financial commitments of 
Istihmar. There are plenty of resources available." 
Government-owned Istithmar, which like DP World is a unit of the Dubai World 
JS11 group, in June 2007 said it bought the more than 40-year-old vessel from Cunard 
Line in the U.K. for $100 million to turn it into a hotel. 
Istithmar is in talks with three hotel operators, including Dubai-based Jumeirah Group, 
to manage the property, said Bin Sulayem, who is also chairman of DP World. The vessel 
will be renovated, while preserving most of its interior decoration, he added, declining 
to say how much the conversion will cost. lsithmar has $286 million in outstanding debt, 
according to data on Bloomberg. 
An old cruise terminal at the port will be converted to become the Dubai Maritime 
Museum, which will house 25,000 pieces of artefacts and maritime artworks owned by 
DP World, bin Sulayem said. It will be finished within the same timeframe as the ship. 
DP World said in October it planned to expand Port Rashid's cruise terminal to cater for 
five cruise ships at one time by end 2012, compared with two vessels at present. "We 
want to make Port Rashid a sea port village," bin Sulayem said today
