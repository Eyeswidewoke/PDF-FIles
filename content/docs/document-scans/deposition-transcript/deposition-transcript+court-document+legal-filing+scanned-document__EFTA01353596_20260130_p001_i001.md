the case of paragraph I 0(6), Buyer, in the case of paragraph I0(gXiii), or Seller, in the case of 
paragraph I 0(hXiii).(in each case the "first party") incurs any loss or expense in entering into 
replacement transactions, the other party shall be required to pay to the first party the amount 
determined by the first party in good faith to be equal to the loss or expense incurred in 
connection with such replacement transactions (including all fees, costs and other expenses) 
less the amount of any profit or gain made by that party in connection with such replacement 
transactions; provided that if that calculation results in a negative number, an amount equal to 
that number shall be payable by the first party to the other party. 
(ii) 
If the first party reasonably decides. instead of entering into such replacement transactions, to 
replace or unwind any hedging transactions which the first party entered into in connection 
with the Transaction so terminating, or to enter into any replacement hedging transactions, the 
other party shall be required to pay to the first party the amount determined by the first party in 
good faith to be equal to the loss or expense incurred in connection with entering into such 
replacement or unwinding (including all fees, costs and other expenses) less the amount of any 
profit or gain made by that party in connection with such replacement or unwinding; provided 
that if that calculation results in a negative number, an amount equal to that number shall be 
payable by the first party to the other party. 
(I) 
Each party shall immediately notify the other if an Event of Default, or an event which, upon the 
serving of a Default Notice, would be an Event of Default, occurs in relation to it.

Where this paragraph applies, the party giving the notice referred to in subparagraph (a) may, subject to 
subparagraph (d) below, terminate the Transaction with effect from a date specified in the notice, not 
being earlier (unless so agreed by the other party) than 30 days after the date of the notice, by nominating 
that date as the Repurchase Date. 
(d) 
If the party receiving the notice referred to in subparagraph (a) so elects, it may override that notice by 
giving a counter-notice to the other party. If a counter-notice is given, the party which gives the counter-
notice will be deemed to have agreed to indemnify the other party against the adverse effect referred to in 
subparagraph (a) so far as relates to the relevant Transaction and the original Repurchase Date will 
continue to apply. 
(e) 
Where a Transaction is terminated as described in this paragraph, the party which has given the notice to 
terminate shall indemnify the other party against any reasonable legal and other professional expenses 
incurred by the other party by reason of the termination, but the other party may not claim any sum by 
way of consequential loss or damage in respect of a termination in accordance with this paragraph. 
(f) 
This paragraph is without prejudice to paragraph 6(b) (obligation to pay additional amounts if 
withholding or deduction required); but an obligation to pay such additional amounts may, where 
appropriate, be a circumstance which causes this paragraph to apply.
