camels, they are trying to get rid of all the donkeys over here instead . . . they forgot that a Puerto Rican donkey 
knows how to climb high mountains, and are stronger than any elephant." 
One federal subpoena went to the elder Gonzalez's longtime girlfriend, Lucia Sanchez. Investigators are also 
looking into the $1 million in campaign funds Gonzalez has spent over the years in uncontested elections, with 
much of the money going to a mystery campaign worker identified in filings as Ricardo Santiago. 
"At issue is whether or not borough politicos funneled state and city funds into pet programs to then turn those 
funds into salaries for friends and relatives," the Riverdale Review reports. 
One of the non-profits being probed is the West Bronx Neighborhood Association, a favorite of Gonzalez's 
housed in the same building as his office on the Grand Concourse. 
Talent shortfall 
THUMB-size thespians looking for a little work would do well to book a trip to London, where dwarf actors are in 
short supply. Producers for the BBC's "Doctor Who" are searching for undersize actors to play little blue aliens in 
the remake of the classic 1970s sci-fi show. But most of Britain's tiny talents have already been snapped up for 
the new "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" movie or to play Gringotts Bank staff in the new "Harry Potter" film. 
Executive producer Russell T. Davies complained to London's Daily Mirror: "It's very difficult to employ persons 
of restricted growth when these other movies are filming at the same time."

THAT it could get crowded for the Democrats in 2008. John Kerry has said he won't rule out running again, and 
now comes word Tipper Gore is telling friends that Al is eyeing another race himself. 
Words of gold 
DONALD Trump will be paid a record-breaking $1 million an hour for Learning Annex appearances in three 
cities this year. That's over $16,000 a minute. Since it was founded in 1980, the Learning Annex has featured 
such celebrity teachers as Sarah Jessica Parker, Tony Robbins, Deepak Chopra and Henry Kissinger. The 
previous highest fee was $28,000 - paid to Ron Wood nearly 20 years ago when he was a member of the 
Rolling Stones. Trump's "How toSucceed in Real Estate" hits Los Angeles on May 1, Chicago on Oct. 23 and 
New York on Nov. 6. Learning Annex president/founder Bill Zanker said, "Last time he taught for us, over 20,000 
students came - and this year he's even bigger." 
Mogul lusts for model shop 
IS billionaire financier Jeffrey Epstein making a bid for IMG Models? As we reported last summer, Epstein tried 
to buy Elite Models when the bankrupt agency was auctioned off. In 2003, we reported that Epstein, who's been 
described as "a connoisseur of beautiful women," was talking to Karin Models owner Jean-Luc Brunel about 
doing a deal, but it went nowhere. Epstein has also met with Elite's Gerald Marie and 1 Managements Scott 
Upps. Now we hear Epstein has been having talks with fellow billionaire Teddy Forstmann, who paid $750 
million for the IMG group a few months ago, about buying the company's modeling division, which reps the likes 
of Gisele Bundchen, Kate Moss and Heidi Klum. Reps for IMG and Forstmann deny any such negotiations are 
taking place. Epstein's rep did not return calls. Forstmann has been talking to top Hollywood talent agencies 
about a possible merger. 
Aspen captive 
SOCIALITE Denise Rich has fired her yoga instructor after his girlfriend told police that he locked her in a room 
of Rich's Aspen mansion for three days over the Thanksgiving holiday. The unidentified woman alleged that 
Jules Paxton attacked her first and then locked her in a room when she threatened to call the cops. A 
spokesman for Rich said the ex-wife of pardoned tax cheat Marc Rich was traveling abroad during the incident, 
but confirmed that Paxton was staying at herhome. "Mrs. Rich has decided to discontinue his services as her 
yoga instructor," the rep said.
