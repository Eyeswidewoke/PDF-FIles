The political fal=out 
How will this play out politically? The UK's Labour opp=sition has clearly judged that there is 
mileage in a renewed campaign agai=st the bankers. However, although Labour supports a tightening of the 
gove=nment's proposed rules on derivatives inside the ringfence for British retail banks proposed for 2013, its ultim=te 
aim is not a particular regulatory outcome but something closer to a mo=al posture on capitalism. Labour leader Ed 
Miliband has broadly disowned t=e banking record of the Labour government before 2010 and has put a "better, 
improved capitalism" at =he heart of his election platform. This is achieving some resonance in the=media. His aim is to 
use a moral and ethical critique of banking as a way =f differentiating himself and the Labour party both from its own 
past and the Conservative-led Coalition government= The Coalition government inevitably will be forced to cover the 
same grou=d. 
The Conservative party is much less inclined to make a mo=al issue of banking, still less of 
capitalism more widely. However, most o= the very small number of genuinely forensic critics of the banking sector=in 
the UK Parliament are Tories, and often individuals with financial services backgrounds. The Chancellor =eorge Osborne 
currently seems more inclined to use the LIBOR issue as an o=portunity to attack Labour's record in government, but if 
other banks ar= fined and the Parliamentary enquiry is highly critical, then he will have to tack to stay close enough to 
the =ublic mood. His own backbenchers have already started to grumble that he h=s misjudged the LIBOR scandal by 
playing it for politics rather than a que=tion of principle and policy. 
For an industry that is used to justifying its social rol= largely in terms of taxes paid and jobs 
created, this is difficult territ=ry. Assuming that banks accept that there is a need seriously to tac=le and talk about 
internal culture, providing evidence of this response is not easy. It will require bank leaders who ar= more visible, vocal 
and accountable, and internal management that is will=ng to pit the long term interests of institutions against the short-
term c=lture of the trading floor. 
For boards, and in particular the many non-executive boar= members of banks charged with 
providing external oversight of institution=l conduct and compensation, this adds both additional responsibility and 
a=ditional exposure. It will require a keen political ear. But it will also require politicians and regulators =o engage in a 
more subtle debate about culture. And care by politicians th=t their desire to curb unacceptable behaviour does not spill 
over into a t=reat to the existence and competitiveness of the banking sector as a whole. 
By falling on his sword Mr Diamond has created the possib=lity of a rapprochement between his 
bank and British political opinion for=ers. The bigger issue for the bank he leaves behind and others like it is =ow — or if —
it is possible to rebuild political and regulatory confidence in the kind of financial markets busin=sses he dedicated his 
career to building and the people who run and profit=from them.
