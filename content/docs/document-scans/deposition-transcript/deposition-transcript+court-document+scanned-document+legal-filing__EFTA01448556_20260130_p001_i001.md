as explained in the attached Margin Disclosure which is incorporated herein by reference.

Deutsche Bank in maintaining the Margin Account on Client's behalf. DBSI will deduct all interest charges from

4. Client's Margin Loan Is a Demand Loan. As such, DBSI or Pershing has the right to demand at any time the 
immediate payment of all or any portion of a margin balance. 
5. Liens. Client hereby grants to DBSI and its Affiliates a security interest in and lien upon all Securities and Other 
Property in the possession or control of DBSI, any of its Affiliates or Pershing, in which Client has an interest (held 
individually, jointly or otherwise) (collectively all such Securities and Other Properly are referred to herein as "DB 
Collateral") in order to secure any and all indebtedness or any other obligation of Client to DBSI and its Affiliates or 
Pershing (collectively, all such obligations are referred to herein as the 'DB Obligations"). Client further grants to 
Pershing a security interest in and lien (the "Pershing Lien") upon all Securities and Other Property held in Client's 
Margin Account(s) and any associated cash account(s) (*Margin Collateral") to secure the indebtedness or any other 
obligation of Client to Pershing in this Margin Account (the "Margin Obligations"). Clients who are joint account 
holders (Joint Accountholders) acknowledge and agree that DB Collateral shall include Securities and Other Property 
held in the Account or any other account held by either Joint Accountholder with DBSI or its Affiliates (whether 
individually, jointly or otherwise) and shall secure any and all DB Obligations of each Joint Accountholder to DBSI 
and its Affiliates. With respect to the lien granted to DBSI and its Affiliates, DBSI (or Pershing, at DBSI's instruction) 
may, at any time and without prior notice, sell, transfer, release, exchange, settle or otherwise dispose of or deal 
with any or all such DB Collateral in order to satisfy any DB Obligations. In enforcing this lien, DBSI shall have the 
discretion to determine which Securities and Other Property to apply for the purposes of the foregoing. With respect 
to the Pershing Lien, Pershing may, at any time and without prior notice, sell, transfer, release, exchange, settle or 
otherwise dispose of or deal with any or all Margin Collateral in order to satisfy any Margin Obligations. In enforcing 
this Pershing lien, Pershing shall have the discretion to determine what and how much Margin Collateral to apply for 
the purposes of the foregoing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall be deemed to grant an interest in 
any Account or assets that would give rise to a prohibited transaction under Section 4975(c)(1)(8) of the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or Section 406(a)(i)(B) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 
1974, as amended. Securities and Other Property held in Client's retirement account(s) maintained by DBSI, which 
may include IRAs or qualified plans, are not subject to this lien and such Securities and Other Property may only be 
used to satisfy Client's indebtedness or other obligations related to Client's retirement account(s)• 
6. Consent to Loan or Pledge of Securities and Other Property. Within the limitations imposed by Applicable Law, all 
Securities and Other Property now or hereafter held, carried or maintained by or in the possession of DBSI that have 
not been fully paid for, or are held in a margin account as collateral for a margin loan, may be lent to DBSI, to 
Pershing or to others, and may be pledged, repledged, hypothecated or rehypothecated by DBSI and/or Pershing 
without notice to Client, either separately or in common with other securities, commodities and other property of 
DBSI's or Pershing's other clients for any amount due in any account with DBSI in which Client has an interest, or 
for any greater amount, and DBSI and/or Pershing may do so without retaining in its possession or control for 
delivery a like amount of similar Securities and Other Property. Client understands that while securities held for 
Client's Account(s) are loaned out, Client will lose voting rights attendant to such securities. Margin securities in 
Client's account may be used for, among other things, settling short sales and lending the securities for short sales. 
As a result, Pershing and/or DBSI may receive compensation in connection with these transactions. Neither 
Pershing, nor DBSI, will lend or pledge fully paid for securities without Client's written permission. 
7. Margin Maintenance, Calls for Additional Collateral, Liquidations and Covering Short Positions. In order to engage 
in margin transactions, Client will be required to maintain such Securities and Other Property in Client's Margin 
Account(s) for margin purposes as shall be required under Applicable Law or otherwise by DBSI or Pershing for any 
reason. Client may be required to post, deposit or maintain additional collateral at any time. In addition to the rights 
otherwise set forth in this Agreement, DBSI and Pershing also shall have the right to liquidate any Securities and 
Other Property held in the Margin Account whenever DBSI or Pershing deems it necessary for its protection. 
Circumstances that may result in collateral calls or liquidations include, but are not limited to, the failure to promptly 
meet any call for additional collateral, the filing of a petition in bankruptcy, the appointment of a receiver by or 
against Client, or the attachment or levy against any account with DBSI in which Client has an interest.
