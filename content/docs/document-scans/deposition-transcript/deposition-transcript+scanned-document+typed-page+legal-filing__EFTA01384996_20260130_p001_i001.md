we hold a direct or indirect interest will not be treated as property held for sale to customers or that 
the safe-harbor provisions will apply. 
The potential application of the prohibited transactions tax could cause us to forego potential 
dispositions of our farms or interests therein or to forego other opportunities that might otherwise be 
attractive to us (such as developing property for sale) or to undertake such dispositions or other 
opportunities through a TRS, which would generally result in corporate income taxes being incurred. 
We have acquired and expect to continue to acquire from time to time crops, including (i) crops 
received as in-kind payments of rent and/or (ii) with respect to certain of our farms under 
development, crops we harvest during the development phase prior to leasing the farm. In past years, 
we have not sold any such crops through a TRS, and going forward it may not be feasible (or 
desirable) to earn the revenue from such sales through a TRS for tax purposes (especially in the case 
of crops harvested off our development properties). My such crops should be characterized as 
inventory or "dealer property" held primarily for the sale to customers in the ordinary course of 
business (and as noted above, with respect to certain development properties we generally are relying 
on and may continue to rely on inventory/dealer property treatment to avoid a violation of the gross 
income tests). Any gain from a sale of inventory/dealer property in excess of directly connected 
deductions (and without any offset for any losses from other inventory sales) is subject to 100% 
prohibited transaction tax. We have incurred prohibited transaction tax in the past, and we may incur 
such taxes in future periods. Moreover, current law provides little guidance as to the deductions that 
are allowed to offset the gain subject to 100% tax, and thus the IRS might disagree with our 
calculations of the amount of gain subject to 100% tax. 
Foreclosure Properly 
Foreclosure property is real property (including interests in real property) and any personal 
property incident to such real property (1) that is acquired by a REIT as a result of the REIT having 
bid in the property at foreclosure, or having otherwise reduced the property to ownership or possession 
by agreement or process of law, after there was a default (or default was imminent) on a lease of the 
property or a mortgage loan held by the REIT and secured by the property, (2) for which the related 
loan or lease was made, entered into or acquired by the REIT at a time when default was not 
imminent or anticipated and (3) for which such REIT makes an election to treat the property as 
foreclosure property. RErn generally are subject to tax at the maximum corporate rate (currently 35%) 
on any net income from foreclosure property, including any gain from the disposition of the foreclosure 
property, other than income that would otherwise be qualifying income for purposes of the 75% gross 
income test. Any gain from the sale of property for which a foreclosure property election has been 
made will not be subject to the 100% tax on gains from prohibited transactions described above, even if 
the property is held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business. 
Hedging Dunsactions and Foreign Currency Gains 
We may enter into hedging transactions with respect to one or more of our assets or liabilities. 
Hedging transactions could take a variety of forms, including interest rate swaps or cap agreements, 
options, futures contracts, forward rate agreements or similar financial instruments. Except to the 
extent provided by 'Nastily Regulations. any income from a hedging transaction (i) made in the 
normal course of our business primarily to manage risk of interest rate or price changes or currency 
fluctuations with respect to borrowings made or to be made, or ordinary obligations incurred or to be 
incurred by us to acquire or own real estate assets or (ii) entered into primarily to manage the risk of 
currency fluctuations with respect to any item of income or gain that would be qualifying income under 
the 75% or 95% income tests (or any property that generates such income or gain), which is clearly 
identified as such before the close of the day on which it was acquired, originated or entered into, 
including gain from the disposition or termination of such a transaction, will not constitute gross
