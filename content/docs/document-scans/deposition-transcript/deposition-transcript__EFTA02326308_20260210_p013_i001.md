worked perfectly but I really liked the newer =ontainer with the better handle grip...and the grass is always greener, 
=ight? 
The short version? 
If you have an older model that still works, =here really is no need to spend the money 
to upgrade. There are slight =ifferences between the two, but each gives you the same results. If =ou've never had a 
Vitamix and are tempted, you would not go wrong with =his model. 
THE MINOR DIFFERENCES: 
50O0: Nothing happens when you plug it in. 
6300: When you plug it in, = blue light comes on (see photos). 
5000: The =id is a bit hard to get on. 
6300: The lid style changed and it's much easier to get =n/off. 
5000: The container has a =imple plastic handle. 
6300: The container style has changed and it has a more =olded hand grip (see photos) 
which makes it easier to handle. 
5000: There are two toggle switches--one to =witch from variable to high speed and one 
to turn the machine =n/off. 
6300: There are =wo toggle switches--one for pulse and one to start/stop the machine 
=the machine is ON when you plug it in). 
5000: When making a smoothie (juice, yogurt, protein powder, =rozen whole 
strawberries), I just use high speed and it works fine. 
6300: When making a =moothie, there's a smoothie setting. It wasn't as powerful as the 
high =peed setting on the 5000 but it did get it mixed it just took a bit =anger. 
Overall, it's a great =achine. That said, I personally don't see the need for the specific 
=ettings (smoothie, frozen desserts, soup) but they don't hurt anything. ='ve also never had a need for the pulse setting, 
but now that I have =t, I will try it.

Color: Black Vine Customer Review of Free =roduct ( What's =his? ) 
Okay, I am so ready to start the war - =itamix vs Blendtec vs Ninja vs Bullet (any bullet, 
nutribullet, baby =ullet). NOBODY rocks a blender like Vitamix. This will be my FIFTH =itamix (and I own the nutribullets 
and the Ninja and I SCOFF loudly at =lendtec). Here's the story... My family owned the stainless steel =tiamix blenders -
from the Danbury Fair days! YES - the early 70's back =hen there was a REVERSE and the stainless steel container had a 
spigot! =hen I moved, I got to take that. A year later I picked up ANOTHER =tainless steel 70's Vitamix at a church fair -
for - wait for it - 50 =ents!! When I had my first baby 10 years ago, I sold both Vitamixes on =bay to generate the cash to 
get a brand new Vitamix 4000 series. And we =ade EVERY single serving of baby food that our two kids ate. At $1++ a 
=iny serving for organic food - we blended the heck out of every organic =quash, rice, banana, apple, cherry, broccoli, 
YOU NAME IT - we blended =t - froze it into cubes and saved THOUSANDS of dollars in baby food. =an I just tell you that 
my kids are still on p. 1 of their =ediatricians booklet - NEVER SICK - food was the key!
