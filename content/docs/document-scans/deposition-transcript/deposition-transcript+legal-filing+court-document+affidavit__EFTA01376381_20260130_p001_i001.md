"Margin Stock": As defined under Regulation U issued by the Federal Reserve 
Board. 
"Market Value": 
With respect to a Collateral Obligation on any date of 
determination, the price thereof (expressed as a percentage) based on the mid point quotation for 
such Collateral Obligation obtained from a Pricing Source as of such date or, if no such 
quotation is available on such date, the mean of the bid quotations for such Collateral Obligation 
obtained on such date from three dealers (which shall not be Affiliates of each other) in the 
relevant market selected by the Collateral Manager for an amount of such Collateral Obligation 
as close as practicable to its Principal Balance (or, if only two such quotations are obtained, the 
lower of such quotations, or if only one such quotation is obtained, such quotation). If the 
Collateral Manager is unable to determine the Market Value with respect to a Collateral 
Obligation pursuant to the preceding sentence, the Market Value of such Collateral Obligation 
shall be deemed to be zero; provided that with respect to such Collateral Obligations with an 
Aggregate Principal Balance not exceeding 5% of the Collateral Principal Amount, the Market 
Value will be the lesser of (A) the Collateral Manager's estimate of the market value (and not 
the recovery rate) of such Collateral Obligation, as of such date, determined by the Collateral 
Manager consistent with commercially reasonable and customary market practice or (B) 1.25 
times the S&P Recovery Rate of such Collateral Obligation as of such date; provided, further, 
that, if the Collateral Manager cannot obtain a bid from a nationally recognized dealer that is 
independent from the Collateral Manager or a Pricing Source within 30 Business Days after such 
good faith determination of the Market Value, the Market Value for such Collateral Obligation 
shall be deemed to be zero. 
"Maturity": With respect to any Senior Note, the date on which the unpaid 
principal of such Senior Note becomes due and payable as therein or herein provided and with 
respect to any Income Note, the date on which a final distribution amount, if any, on the Income 
Note becomes due and payable, in each case whether on the Maturity Date or by declaration of 
acceleration, call for redemption or otherwise. 
"Maturity Date": With respect to any security, the maturity date specified in such 
security or applicable Reference Instrument; and with respect to the Securities of any Class, the 
date specified as such in Section 2.3. 
"Measurement Date: Any of (i) the date of any purchase or sale of a Collateral 
Obligation, (ii) each Determination Date, (iii) each Monthly Report Determination Date and (iv) 
with reasonable prior written notice to the Co-Issuers, the Collateral Manager and the Trustee, 
any Business Day that a Rating Agency requests to be a "Measurement Date"; provided that if 
any such date would otherwise fall on a day that is not a Business Day, the relevant 
Measurement Date will be the immediately following Business Day.

and Articles of Association, as may be further amended, revised or restated from time to time.
