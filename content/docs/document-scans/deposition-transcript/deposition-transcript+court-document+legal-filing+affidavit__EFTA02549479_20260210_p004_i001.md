Some members of the Trump team interacted with Russians and advocated dovish policies. But so did 
numerous American political and academic elites, including many Clinton advisers. Presidential campaigns routinely seek 
opposition research and interact with foreign powers. The Clinton campaign funded the Steele dossier, whose British 
author paid Russians to dish anti-Trump dirt. The Podesta Group, led by the brother of Mrs. Clinton's campaign 
chairman, received millions lobbying for Russia's largest bank and the European Center for a Modern Ukraine, both with 
deep Kremlin ties. The Clinton Foundation and Bill Clinton took millions from Kremlin-connected businesses. 
No evidence has emerged of Trump-Russia collusion, and Mr. Mueller has yet to bring collusion-related 
charges against anyone. Evidence suggests one of his targets, George Papadopoulos, was lured to London, plied with the 
prospect of Russian information damaging to Mrs. Clinton, and taken to dinner, where he drunkenly bragged that he'd 
heard about such dirt but never seen it. These circumstances not only fail to suggest Mr. Papadopoulos committed a 
crime, they reek of entrapment. The source of this information, former Australian diplomat Alexander Downer, admits 
Mr. Papadopolous never mentioned emails, destroying any reasonable inference of a connection between the DNC hack 
and the Trump campaign. 
Crossfire's progenitors thus ignored an obvious question: If Russia promised unspecified dirt on Mrs. 
Clinton but never delivered it, how would that amount to collusion with the Trump campaign? If anything, such behavior 
suggests an attempt to entice and potentially embarrass Mr. Trump by dangling the prospect of compromising 
information and getting his aides to jump at it. 
Given the paucity of evidence, it's staggering that the FBI would initiate a counterintelligence 
investigation, led by politically biased staff, amid a presidential campaign. The aggressive methods and subsequent 
leaking only strengthen that conclusion. If the FBI sincerely believed Trump associates were Russian targets or agents, 
the proper response would have been to inform Mr. Trump so that he could protect his campaign and the country. 
Mr. Trump's critics argue that the claim of political bias is belied by the fact that Crossfire was not leaked 
before the election. In fact, there were vigorous, successful pre-election efforts to publicize the Trump-Russia collusion 
narrative. Shortly after Crossfire's launch, CIA Director John Brennan and Mr. Comey briefed Congress, triggering 
predictable leaking. Christopher Steele and his patrons embarked on a media roadshow, making their dossier something 
of an open secret in Washington. 
On Aug. 29, 2016, the New York Times published a letter to Mr. Comey from Senate Minority Leader 
Harry Reid, saying he'd learned of "evidence of a direct connection between the Russian government and Donald 
Trump's presidential campaign," which had "employed a number of individuals with significant and disturbing ties to 
Russia and the Kremlin." On Aug. 30, the ranking Democratic members of four House committees wrote a public letter 
to Mr. Comey requesting "that the FBI assess whether connections between Trump campaign officials and Russian 
interests" may have contributed to the DNC hack so as "to interfere with the U.S. presidential election." On Sept. 23, 
Yahoo News's Michael Isikoff reported the Hill briefings and the Steele dossier's allegations regarding Carter Page. On 
Oct. 30, Harry Reid again publicly wrote Mr. Comey: "In my communications with you and other top officials in the 
national security community, it has become clear that you possess explosive information about close ties and 
coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisors, and the Russian government." 
That these leaking efforts failed to prevent Mr. Trump's victory, or that Mr. Comet's ham-fisted 
interventions might have also hurt Mrs. Clinton's electoral prospects, does not diminish the legal significance of the anti-
Trump bias shown by government officials. 
The totality of the circumstances creates the appearance that Crossfire was politically motivated. Since 
an attempt by federal law enforcement to influence a presidential election "shocks the conscience," any prosecutorial 
effort derived from such an outrageous abuse of power must be suppressed. The public will learn more once the 
inspector general finishes his investigation into Crossfire's genesis. But given what is now known, due process demands, 
at a minimum, that the special counsel's activity be paused. Those affected by Mr. Mueller's investigation could litigate
