Farouk, 
<=r class="gmail_msg"> 
Attached is the bottomline analysis of the option= available to the Company 
right now. It is a pretty stark difference betwe=n the two paths. Ultimately we are asking BlackRock to chose the path 
that=is economically best for them - we are killing ourselves for them to have = better financial outcome. Our intentions 
should be aligned... 
I've also attached a timeline of our BlackRock re=ationship. There is a one page 
summary at the beginning and the full detai= behind it. 
Hey are notes in some key a=eas: 
Background on the Global Allocation team=/div> 
• 
Dennis Stattman is head of the Global=Allocation Team. 
• 
Lisa O'Donnell= Co-COO of the team, has been the Fund officer 
overseeing BlackRock's =osition in our company and has been the chief decision maker in this proce=s. 
• 
She has been extremely aggressive, me=n-spirited and difficult to work 
with since the beginning of their investm=nt. She dislikes all of their private investments and has stated she wants=to 
make a negative example of Jawbone. She objected to our deal in the beg=nning and feels like the investment was made 
despite her viewpoint. all> 
• 
No one from Jawbone has ever met Lisa in person= She refused to meet 
us either in her Princeton office nor has she ever vi=ited us. We have tried multiple times. 
• 
L=sa has repeatedly stated in front of advisors and bankers on the 
phone tha= she doesn't care if BR loses all of their capital from this deal- the=loss is insignificant for them with the size 
of their fund. 
• 
Lisa has also stated to me directly that we should neve= expect any help 
from BlackRock in any situation - "we are your cr=ditor, do not ever expect anything from us" 
• 
I have heard from several different people that they refer to me as 
=E24j*The Terrorist" internally. Terrible given the current stat= of affairs in the world. 
• 
David Clayton =s a non-investing Managing Director with the Fund and 
has recently been ou= primary contact recently (he reports to Lisa). 
• 
The Senior Investment Analysts on our deal have been Daniel Daniel 
=nd Patrick Edelmann. They seem powerless in the situation and do not stand=up to Lisa. 
• 
No one from BlackRock has vi=ited Jawbone in 2016. They have not 
seen any of the new things we are work=ng on. No demos of the prototypes, nothing. 
Possible anticipated points from BlackRock and our responses=/div> 
• 
Management team- we don't trust Hosain, the Board, his man=gement 
team, everything he and the team have told us has turned out to not=be true, promises are never hit. We have missed 
targets and it has=been painful. We are taking great care to make sure we don't repea= the mistakes of the past, there 
are reasons we missed targets - slow sale= in stores, quality issues, product delays. We had a bad product cycle and=we 
haven't been funded to come out of it. Instead of focusing on t=e business we fight with BR. It's a waste. But to your 
point it so=t of doesn't matter relative to the economically rational decision=going forward. 
• 
<= class="gmail_msg">Wasting money - opex super high put in this 
much=money three months later they needed more money Again p=rhaps we should have cut expenses earlier but we 
needed to move the ball f=rward to where it is today in many areas. We have a smart focused plan goi=g forward where
