Determining the 
Primo Rate 
We use the Prime Rate from the Money Rates 
section (or successor section) of The Wall Street 
Journal. The Prime Rate for each billing period is the 
Prime Rate published in The Weil Street Journal 2 
days before the Closing Date of the billing period. 
The Wall Street Journal may not publish the Prime 
Rate on that day. If it does not, we will use the Prime 
Rate from the previous day it was published. If The 
Wall Street Journal is no longer published, we may 
use the Prime Rate from any other newspaper of 
general circulation in New York, New York. Or we 
may choose to use a similar published rate. 
If the Prime Rate increases. variable APRs (and 
corresponding DPRs) will increase. In that case, you 
may pay more interest and may have a higher 
Minimum Payment Due. When the Prime Rate 
changes, the resulting changes to variable APRs 
take effect as of the first day of the billing period.

Converting charges made 
In a foreign currency 
If you make a charge in a foreign currency, we will 
convert it into U.S. dollars on the date we or our 
agents process it. Unless a particular rate is required 
by law, we will choose a conversion rate that is 
acceptable to us for that date. The rate we use is no 
more than the highest official rate published by a 
government agency or the highest interbank rate we 
identify from customary banking sources on the 
conversion date or the prior business day. This rate 
may differ from rates that are in effect on the date of 
your charge. We will bill charges converted by 
establishments (such as airlines) at the rates they 
use.
