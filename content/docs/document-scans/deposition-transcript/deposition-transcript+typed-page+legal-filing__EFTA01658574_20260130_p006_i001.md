Four planned to meet Wednesday to make a payment on explosives and exchange tactical 
gear; the FBI said in the court filing. The FBI quoted one of the accused as saying Whitmer `has 
no checks and balances at all. She has uncontrolled power right now. All good things must 
come to an end." 
The Washington Times (10/8, Mordock, 492K) reports, "Federal prosecutors announced 
Thursday that they had charged six militia members with conspiring to kidnap Ms. Whitmer, a 
Democrat. If convicted, all six could face life in prison. Separately, Michigan State Attorney 
General Dana Nessel filed charges against seven other members accused of having roles in the 
plot. Those seven face 19 felony charges, including state terrorism counts, that could land each 
in prison for more than 20 years. It is not clear what role the defendants facing state charges 
are accused of played in the kidnapping plot." 
CNN (10/8, Carrega, 83.16M) reports, "The arrests are likely to draw additional attention 
to the political tensions roiling the nation in the closing weeks of the 2020 election season, and 
underline warnings from law enforcement officials, members of Congress and groups that track 
extremism about the increasing threat of extremist and far-right groups. Whitmer at times has 
been the focus of extreme vitriol from far-right groups over her handling of the coronavirus 
pandemic." CNN adds, "In an interview on CNN's 'Erin Burnett OutFront' on Thursday night, 
Whitmer thanked law enforcement for making the arrests. `This is unlike anything we have seen 
before. The brave men and women of these two police organizations put their lives on the line 
to keep me and my family safe; she said. 'I'm incredibly grateful and humbled by the work they 
do." 
Fox News (10/8, Barrabi, 27.59M) reports, "Whitmer, a Democrat, has enacted strict 
lockdown measures during the coronavirus pandemic. Local Democrats have praised the 
measures as a necessary step to protect state residents, while critics, including Trump, have 
argued her plan was too restrictive and infringed on individual freedoms and the state economy. 
The Michigan governor said she has made 'tough choices to keep our state safe' and expressed 
sympathy for losses suffered by local residents and businesses." 
The Hill (10/8, Budryk, 2.98M) reports, "Whitmer, who imposed some of the nation's 
strictest measures to mitigate the coronavirus pandemic, said in May that she saw an 
'explosion' of threats as a result. The governor's residence implemented a $1.1-million security 
upgrade in September, which a spokesperson for her office said was part of 'routine 
maintenance and upgrades.' The Hill notes that in May, Robert Sinclair Tesh, "a 32-year-old 
Detroit man, was charged with threatening to kill both Whitmer and Attorney General Dana 
Nessel (D)." 
The Lansing_ 141) State Journal (10/8, Thompson, 206K) reports, "The arrest of six militia 
members accused of plotting to kidnap Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and take her to Wisconsin for a 
'trial' did not come as a shock to some of her Lansing neighbors. Though chilling, the plot felt 
like an escalation of the protests that have become common in the wealthy and usually tranquil 
neighborhood near Moores River Drive since spring. 'It's a shame that it's not a surprise, but it's 
not a surprise,' said James Perkins, a retired professor who lives a few doors down from the 
Michigan governor's residence where Whitmer and her family live." The State Journal adds, 
"Protesters demonstrating against coronavirus lockdown measures have periodically gathered 
outside the governor's residence, gridlocking the streets with cars, carrying weapons, shouting 
into bullhorns." 
The Washington Post (10/8, Timberg, Stanley-Becker, 14.2M) reports, "In June, one of the 
suspects in the plot to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer took to the relative privacy of a 
Facebook group to make clear his brewing hatred. Adam Fox called Whitmer a 'tyrant bitch; 
according to an FBI affidavit, and declared, 'I don't know boys, we gotta do something... give 
me some ideas of what we can do.' Such online declarations, brimming with anger and 
potentially violent intent, have become staples of extremism-fueled crime news in recent years, 
from police killings to synagogue massacres to bombing plots. Before they become real, they
