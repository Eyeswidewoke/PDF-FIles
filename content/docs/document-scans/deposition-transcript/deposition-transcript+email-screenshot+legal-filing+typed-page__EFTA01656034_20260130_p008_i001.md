KARE (NBC-11) (06/05, Staff Writer) reported that five members of a prominent north Minneapolis street gang 
were convicted Thursday in the second major federal racketeering (RICO) case involving the gang. Following a 
three-week trial, a jury found five members of the Highs gang out of north Minneapolis guilty of several federal 
crimes, including murder, drug trafficking, weapons violations, robberies and assaults. "The Highs have long 
terrorized north Minneapolis, bringing drugs, violence, and murder into our community," said Acting U.S. Attorney 
Joseph H. Thompson in a press release. "This verdict represents yet another step in our fight against gang 
violence." A DO1 press release noted that the ATF, FBI, Minneapolis Police Department, IRS Criminal Investigation, 
U.S. Postal Inspection Service, Hennepin County Sheriff's Office, Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, and 
Minnesota Department of Corrections are investigating the case. 
FBI Warns Students and Parents Over Online 'Sextortion' 
WBFF (Fox-45) (06/05, Depietro) reported that the FBI is warning students and parents about a growing threat 
online called 'sextortion, so they know how to avoid risky situations and ask for help if they're being victimized. 
According to the article, the growing online threat is on the rise this summer, with students home from school for 
the summer. The outlet spoke with FBI Supervisory Special Agent, Leslie Adamczyk, to discuss those growing 
concerns. She says there are both sexually motivated predators as well as financially motivated predators. The 
article quoted Adamczyk, who said, "It's not for large amounts of money; usually, it's for gift cards, $50 or $100, 
never more than a couple hundred dollars. Those happen really quickly and what is alarming about is we've had a 
lot of death by suicide in those cases." Adamczyk says that the concern for sextortion ranges from young children 
all the way to teenagers. She says that as soon as a child is in front of a device, they are subject to sextortion.

Arizona Teen, 14, Found Dismembered Told Cops She Wanted Out of Group Home Before She Was Found 
Dead 
The New York Post (06/05, Reilly) reported that a 14-year-old girl who was found dismembered on the side of a 
road in Arizona had previously told police that she hated the group home she had vanished from when she had run 
away years earlier, new body camera footage shows. Emily Pike was murdered after she disappeared on Jan. 27 
from the Mesa group home, run by Sacred Journey Inc., where she was reported missing three different times 
before in 2023. New bodycam footage of one of the previous incidents, dated Sept. 20, 2023, shows Emily walking 
along a canal when an officer calls her name repeatedly as he approaches her and asks her to stop. The article 
mentioned that the teen, whose family lives on the San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation, insists that the facility is 
not her home, telling the cop she'd rather live with her grandmother instead. The Mesa Police Department, FBI, 
and Bureau of Indian Affairs have organized a task force to track down Emily's killer. 
Washington Sheriff Shares New Photo of Suspected Killer Dad Amid Manhunt in Daughters' Triple Murder 
Fox News (06/05, Ruiz) reported that a Washington state survivalist has been on the run from authorities for nearly 
a week after allegedly killing his three young daughters, who were found with plastic bags over their heads and 
bound wrists at a campground in Chelan County Monday. Travis Caleb Decker, 32, did not have custody of the girls 
— all of whom are believed to have died from asphyxiation. Decker spent time in the military and is an avid 
outdoorsman, according to authorities. "We're getting more confirmation, that he might have possibly gone 
through Mountain Survival School," Chelan County Sheriff Mike Morrison told reporters Wednesday. "But we also 
know, too, that he's been an outdoorsman since he was a kid." On Thursday, he released a new photo showing 
Decker's tattoos and said search warrants had generated leads. He urged homeowners and people with mountain 
cabins to lock their doors — including to sheds and outbuildings, leave their blinds open and turn on outdoor 
lighting.
