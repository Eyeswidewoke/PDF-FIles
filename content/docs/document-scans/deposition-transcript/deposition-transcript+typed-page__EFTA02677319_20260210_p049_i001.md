Today. we live in beta. Major global forces are changing our institutions. our careers and the way 
we live our lives. The relative rise and fall of nationsUAsia and the West. and generationsirGen Y 
and the Boomers: urbanization: global warming and digitalization of connection and discourse are 
undermining our existing economic. educational, health and political systems, forcing massive 
disruptions in our organizations and our own sense of identity. The locus of solutions in this era of 
constant flux is Design. When the future lacks visibility, creative Design Thinking can guide us 
through a world of ambiguity and change. This course will focus on how Design can take us into 
cultures that are both familiar and foreign and reveal truths and trends that can provide the ideas 
for new products. services and experiences. It will explain how the package of tools and methods 
of Ethnography can generate the kind of knowledge that designers can translate into creative 
solutions, from new sustainable fashions for bike riders in New York City to new forms of drip 
irrigation for rural Indian villagers; from new FaceElook-based health care practices for doctors in 
Brooklyn to new online learning for Navajo elementary school children In Arizona; from less 
expensive university learning in the U.S., to inexpensive transportation for elderly British people in 
distance towns. In a series of lectures that will include a global roster of guest speakers and 
Parsons' own world-famous faculty, we will explore the new space of Design and Ethnography. We 
will examine global Gen Y youth cultures of China. India, the US, Latin America and Europe: 
women's cultures; street cultures: urban cultures; and• of course. digital cultures. We will have 
speakers from top innovation and design consultancies such as 10E0, ZIBA Design. fuseprojects, 
Continuum. and Smart Design. We will bring in the top trend spotting analysts, from fashion 
houses to cell phone makers (Nokia). And we will invite young artists to tell their storiesUhow they 
see and hear and translate that into their art. Readings will include books, blogs. biographies. 
websites and videos. The course will be a collaboration• not a lecture series. Speakers will interact 
with the students at each presentation And students will be asked to form small teams to do their 
own ethnographic research and develop a design brief for something new. exciting and useful.
