<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergonomics> and for safety <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety> reasons, stairs must 
have certain measurements =o that people can comfortably use them. Building codes 
chttp://en.wikipedia.org=wiki/Building_code> typically specify certain measurements so that the stairs are not too 
steep or narrow. American building codes specify the following parameters:[5] 
<http://en.=ikipedia.org/wiki/Stairway#cite_note-4> <=sup>[6] <http://en.wikipe=ia.org/wiki/Stairway#cite_note-5> 
<=up id="cite_ref-6" class="reference">[7]<http://en.wikipedia.orqwiki/Stairway#cite_note-6> 
• 
Minimum tread length, typically 9 inches (229 mm) excluding th= nosing for private residences. Some building 
codes also specify a minimum riser height, often 5 inches (127 mm).[8] 
chttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stairway#cite_no=e-7> 
• 
Riser-Tread formula: =ometimes the stair parameters will be something like riser + tread equals =7-18 inches 
(432-457 mm);191 <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stairwayncite_note-8> another formula is 2 times riser + tre=d equals 
24.6 inches (625 mm), the length of a stride.[31<http://en.wikipedia.org/wi=i/Stairway#cite_note-Neufert-2> Thus a 7 
inches (178 mm) rise and a 10.6 inches (269 mm) tread e=actly meets this code. If only a 2 inches (51 mm) rise is used 
then a 20.6=20 inches (523 mm) tread is required. This is based on the principle that=a low rise is more like walking up a 
gentle incline and so the natural swing of the leg will be longer. This makes low rise stairs very expensive in terms of the 
space consumed. Such low rise stairs were built into the Winchester Mystery House 
chttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winchester_Mystery_H=use> to ac=ommodate the infirmities of the owner, Sarah 
Winchester <http://en.wikipedia.org/=iki/Sarah_Winchester> , bef=re the invention of the elevator 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator> . These stairways, called "Easy Risers" consist of five flights wr=pped into a 
multi-turn arrangement with a total width equal to more than four times the individual flight width and a depth roughly 
equal to one flight's run plus this width. The flights have varying numbers of steps= 
• 
Slope: A value for the rise-to-tread ratio of 17/29 = 0.5= is considered optimal;[3] 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stairway#cite_note-Neufert-2> this corresponds to a pitch angle of a=out 30°. 
• 
Variance on riser height and tread depth between steps on the same flight should be very low. Building codes 
require variances no larger than 0.1875 inches (4.76 mm) between depth of adjacent treads or the=20 height of 
adjacent risers; within a flight, the tolerance between the largest and smallest riser or between the largest and smallest 
tread can not exceed 0.375 inches (9.5 mm).=10]<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stairwayticite_note-9> The reason is 
that on a continuous flight of stairs, people get used to a regular step and may trip if there is a step that is different, 
especially at night. The general rule is that all steps on the same flight must be identical. Hence, stairs are typically 
custom made to fit the particular floor to floor height and horizontal space available. Special care must be taken on the 
first and last risers. Stairs must be supported directly by the subfloor. If thick flooring (e.g. thick hardwood planks) are 
added on top of the subfloor, it will cover part of the first riser, reducing the effective height of the first step. Likewise at 
the top step, if the top riser simply reaches the subfloor and thick flooring is added, the last rise at the top may be higher 
than the last riser. The first and last riser heights of the rough stairs are modified to adjust for the addition of the 
finished floor. 
• 
Maxi=um nosing protrusion, typically 1.25 inches (32 mm) to prevent people=from tripping on the nosing. 
• 
Height of the handrail. This is typic=lly between 34 and 38 inches (864 and 965 mm), measured to the nose of 
the tread. The minimum height of the handrail for landings may be different and is typically 36 inches (914 mm). 
• 
Handrail diameter. The size has to be comfortable f=r grasping and is typically between 1.25 and 2.675 inches 
(32 and 67.9 mm)= 
• 
Maximum space between the balusters of the handrail. This is typi=ally 4 inches (102 mm). 
* 
Openings (if they exist) between the bottom rail and treads are typical=y no bigger than 6 inches (152 mm). 
• 
Headroom: At least 83 inc=es (211 cm).(4=pan>3)
