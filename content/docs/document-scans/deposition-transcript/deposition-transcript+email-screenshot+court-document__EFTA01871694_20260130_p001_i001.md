'Ifs hard to say goodbye when you're having fun! 
Yet, this is my last Page2Live X21 entry. 
On Tuesday, I became executive editor of Radar Online PI one of the country's biggest celebrity websites. 
The sandbox I get to play in now is a lot larger, and the gig often will take me to Los Angeles and Las Vegas 
and New York City. 
But I leave The Palm Beach Post PI and the readers who supported me with news tips, kudos and criticism 
for the past seven years with a heavy heart. 
I love Palm Beach County and the Treasure Coast, and not just because it's my home. There are few places 
in this country as quirky as Palm Beach, Stuart, Boca and Wellington. News people who work here know 
they're lucky because, indeed, there never is a dull moment. 
For more, look below or click 
My first story was a profile of the controversial Welly developer Glenn Straub, a West Virginia who conducts 
business the way miners in his native state attack coal veins. 
The 2004 piece opened with an anecdote about how Straub was so reviled that polo fans cheered when he 
injured himself in a potentially fatal fall during a Palm Beach Polo Club game. Straub complained about the 
coverage a little, but I believe he secretly loved the attention. 
I'll confess to a rough beginning in Palm Beach society a couple months later. 
To some, including the recently deceased Dame Celia Lipton Farris 
a great philanthropist, I just didn't 
dress right. 
After checking me out from head to toe at a party where I might have appeared without a tie and a shave, 
she told me: 'Palm Beach had a dress code, young man!" 
I never got around to buying a blue blazer with gold buttons or loafers adorned with some crest. 
Publicly, Palm Beach society didn't acknowledge Page2Live. But secretly, I believe it loved the attention. 
Some public officials, meanwhile, will welcome the news of my departure. 
Weeks ago, a high-ranking official at the Palm Beach County Sheriffs Office PI half-kiddingly promised me 
lunch at the Palm Beach Yacht Club gel if I left the Post. 
I guess stories about on-duty sex, violence, incompetence and corruption at PBSO was grating on the 
administration's nerves. 
I'm told former West Palm Beach Mayor Lois Frankel, now a U.S. Congress hopeful, made a round of gleeful 
calls when she heard about Page2Live's demise. 
She could still be traumatized after my story last year about how she ignored a citation for a blown red-light 
stop caught on the very cameras she had installed throughout the city. 
I believe that secretly, however, even Frankel loved the attention. 
What do I miss the most while now working alongside a dedicated staff of 11 to dig up more stuff on Tiger 
Woods, Angelina Jolie and Lindsay Lohan? 
You, the reader, the driving force behind Page2Live!
