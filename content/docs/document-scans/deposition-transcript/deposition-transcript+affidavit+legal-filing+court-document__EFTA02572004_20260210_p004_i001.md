First, until I learned about it, Bainco was paying out about half of the withdrawal in distributions to the family. About a 
third goes to taxes. The rest went to payments on the Wellfleet house. That exhausts the obligatory withdrawal. 
In addition, I was=paying the management fees for the entire estate. And there were of course addit=onal substantial 
expenses, like Alex's medical bills and payment to Anthony for the work that he is doing. All of that carries the total well 
over the required withdrawal. Worse, anything beyond the required withdrawal is taxed at an exorbitant rate, which is 
why I suggested that taxes come instead from the marital trust; no need to go over the fate of that idea. The arithmetic 
is simple. It's now far over t=e limit. All of this is before I take one penny for living expense=. 
In the manner that=things were being handled, in two or three years the IRA would be exhausted, and we'=d be down 
pretty much to a very small pension and Social Security -- which do not go to Valeria after my death. Furthermore, it 
goes without saying that I want to guarantee that after my death Valeria will have our home, unencumbered. That 
would clearly be impossible the way things were being handled. In fact, she would have nothing at all. 
I shouldn't ha=e to explain that providing for Valeria after my death is a serious concern for me.Q=A0 We are very 
happy together. Our being together added immeasurably to my life. I took for granted that friends and family would be 
very pleased about that, and those we see regularly are, very much so. 
I'm glad that =11 of you will be free from any financial concerns, thanks to substantial investments from my salary and 
other income over the years, now in trusts of which you are the beneficiaries. But that doesn't happen to be the case 
for me. I didn't really think about it in the past, but I never e=pected to have to spend my later years concerned about 
how to make ends meet.

Hi,

The promissory note itself defines=the interest rate for the loan - our opinion doesn't hold any legal weight on this issue. 
If your lawyer doesn't think it's clear, would=she like to write to Max and explain the problem? We really don't see how 
w= can be of help on this. Since you set up this loan and its terms with the help of Max, who was your lawyer at the 
time, he's the one who will be able to clarify any doubts. We got involved only to try to explain because we thought you 
were misunderstanding the terms of the loan, based on what we learned about it. 
If what you need is help calculating the amount owed based on the rules detailed in the note, Isabel Scharmer should be 
able to do that calculation easily, and we suggest you or your lawyer contact her. Noam Chomsky
