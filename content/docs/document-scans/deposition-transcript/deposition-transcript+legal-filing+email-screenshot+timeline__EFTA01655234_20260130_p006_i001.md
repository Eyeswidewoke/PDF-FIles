quadruple-murder trial set to begin next month, they turned to a final option: a plea deal to avoid execution. The 
article mentioned that Kohberger, 30, is due to appear at 11 a.m. MDT Wednesday before Idaho Fourth Judicial 
District Judge Steven Hippler in Boise, where he is expected to plead guilty to charges that he murdered Kaylee 
Goncalves, Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle and Madison Mogen at a rental home near campus in Moscow, Idaho, 
early on Nov. 13, 2022. "This resolution is our sincere attempt to seek justice for your family," prosecutors wrote in 
a letter to the families. "This agreement ensures that the defendant will be convicted, will spend the rest of his life 
in prison, and will not be able to put you and the other families through the uncertainty of decades of post-
conviction, appeals." The New York Post (07/01, Downing), NPR (07/01, Chappell), Newsnation (07/01, Menezes, 
Banfield), Newsnation (07/01, Menezes, Entin), CBS News (07/01, Freiman, Dakss), and CNN (07/01, Wolfe, 
Romine, et al.) also reported on the story. 
The FBI is Just One Problem Facing Malik Beasley, Amid $8M in Escalating Financial Problems 
The Detroit News (07/01, Snell) reported that Malik Beasley thrived on the basketball court last season for the 
Detroit Pistons while coping with a federal gambling investigation and more than $8 million worth of financial 
problems that include being sued twice by his Detroit landlord and having part of his Pistons paycheck seized, 
public records show. According to the article, court records paint a picture of a turbulent personal life as Beasley 
experienced a career breakthrough with the Pistons last season and while debts mounted from a celebrity barber, 
a dentist, a landlord, a lender and a marketing firm. The court records and details about a years-long history of 
financial problems are emerging as FBI agents conduct an investigation involving Beasley that is focused on wire 
fraud, gambling and prop bets. Beasley, who has signed NBA contracts worth more than $59 million during his 
career, has not been charged with wrongdoing, but the Pistons have pulled back on a three-year, $42 million offer 
amid the FBI investigation involving the free agent. ESPN (07/01, Purdum), CBS Sports (07/01, Dajani, Mahjouri), SI 
(07/01, Douglas), the Detroit Free Press (07/01, Romo), New York Post (07/01, Svoboda), Yahoo Sports (07/01, 
Owens), and MLive (07/01, Richman) also reported on the story. 
Cultlike Zizian Group Member Charged in Border Agent's Death Seeks Delay in Death Penalty Decision 
The Associated Press (07/01, Ramer) reported that a woman charged in the death of a U.S. Border Patrol agent in 
Vermont wants to delay the government's decision on whether to seek the death penalty by at least six months. 
According to the article, Teresa Youngblut, of Washington state, is part of a cultlike group known as Zizians that has 
been connected to six killings in three states. She's accused of firing at agent David Maland during a traffic stop on 
Jan. 20, the same day President Donald Trump was inaugurated and signed a sweeping executive order lifting the 
moratorium on federal executions. Attorney General Pam Bondi later cited Maland's death in directing federal 
prosecutors to seek the death penalty in cases involving the murder of law enforcement officers unless they find 
significant mitigating circumstances. But Youngblut's lawyers argue the government has set a "radically 
inadequate" and "extraordinarily rushed" timeline for that determination. The article noted that in a motion filed 
late Monday, Assistant Federal Public Defenders Steven Barth and Julie Stelzig said the government has set a July 
28 deadline for them to explain why the death penalty should not be sought, even though Youngblut has yet to be 
charged with a crime eligible for such punishment. 
DOJ Silent on Whether NYC Politician Who Allegedly Assaulted Ice Officer Will Face Charges 
Fox News (07/01, Pinedo, Arcand) reported that as the New York City mayoral results roll in, the Department of 
Justice is remaining silent on whether it will press charges against city comptroller and former Democratic mayoral 
candidate Brad Lander, who allegedly assaulted a federal immigration officer inside a courthouse. According to the 
article, a spokesperson for the DOJ replied to Fox News Digital's inquiry in an emailed statement, simply saying, 
"Unfortunately, we are not able to provide any additional information." Video footage taken of Lander's arrest, 
which was on June 17, shows a chaotic scene in which Lander is hanging onto Immigration and Customs 
Enforcement (ICE) agents as they escorted a defendant out of immigration court at 26 Federal Plaza. He repeatedly 
asked officials if they had a judicial warrant. The video shows federal officials eventually separate Lander from the 
immigrant whom the officials were targeting, and they proceed to handcuff Lander. He can be heard repeatedly 
insisting they do not have the authority to arrest him. One agent seemed to say that he was obstructing an arrest, 
to which he replied, "I'm not obstructing. I'm standing right here in the hallway. I asked to see the judicial 
warrant." Hours later, Lander walked out of the federal courthouse where he was being held alongside New York 
Gov. Kathy Hochul. During a news conference outside the courthouse, Hochul said that charges against Lander had 
been dropped, though the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York said it was "continuing to 
investigate" Lander's actions.
