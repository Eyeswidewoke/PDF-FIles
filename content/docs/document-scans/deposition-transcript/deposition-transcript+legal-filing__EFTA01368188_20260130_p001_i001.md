A WOMAN has claimed the was raped by Donald Trump as a teenager after being lured to sex parties. 
She accused the 69-year-old US Republican presidential hopeful and Prince Andrew's paedophile pal Jeffrey Epstein of assaulting 
her and using her as a sex slave. 
Katie Johnson. who has waived her right to anonymity as an alleged vicam, lodged her claim in the Cent-al District Court of California 
on Tuesday. 
Billionaire businessman Trump vehemently denies the allegations. 
Johnson also alleged she was threatened with her life if she ever spoke of the abuse claims. 
She said in the legal papers. "Katie Johnson was warned on more than one occasion by both defendants. Donald J Trump and 
Jeffrey E Epstein, that were she ever to reveal any of the details of the sexual and physical abuse the had suffered as a sex slave 
for defendant Trump and defendant Epstein. that plaintiff Johnson and her family would be in mortal danger. 
"Plaintiff Johnson was warned that this would mean certain death for herself and plaintiff Johnson's family unless she remained silent 
forever on the details of the depraved and perverted sexual and physical abuse she had been forced to endure from the defendants." 
Johnson, who is seeking £68.5million damages, accused the pair of "sexual abuse under threat of harm. 
She also "alleges she was enticed by promises of money and a modelling career to attend a series of underage sex parties held at the 
New York City residence of defendant Jeffrey E Epstein and attended by Donald J Trump". 
Johnson claims the was forced to perform sex acts on Trump and "engage in an unnatural lesbian sex act with her fellow minor and 
sex slave". 
The court papers add that on the "fourth and final sexual encounter" Trump "proceeded to forcibly rape the plaintiff ". She claims the 
acts took place from June to September 1994 and "she was subject to extreme sexual and physical abuse" from the age of 13 
The allegations could derail Trump's bid to be president. 
But in response, he told Radar Online: "The allegations are not only categorically false but disgusting at the highest level and dearly 
framed to solicit media attention or. perhaps, are simply politically motivated. 
"There is absolutely no merit to these allegations. Period." 
According to the documents. Johnson is representing herself in the case. 
Trump has previously been accused of sexual assault by his ex-wife Ivana. During their divorce battle in 1991, the Czech-American 
socialite claimed he "raped" her three years previously. 
But she later clarified her comment saying it was not in "a literal or criminal sense". 
In February, as Trump's presidential run got under way. allegations resurfaced that he sexually assaulted and tried to rape a woman in 
the early 90s. 
She claimed in a federal lawsuit that he violated her "physical and mental integrity' when he touched her intimately without consent 
after her boyfriend went into business with him. 
She said it left her "emotionally devastated and distraught". 
The woman dropped the £90million lawsuit in Manhattan last month. 
Epstein, who was once a dose friend of Prince Andrew. pleaded guilty to two state charges of soliciting a minor for prostitution and 
soliciting prostitution. 
He served 13 months after being sentenced in 2008. 
Investigators suspected the former New York financier of abusing 34 underage girls but lawyers failed to charge him or any of his "co-
conspirators" and instead offered him a secret plea bargain. 
They are false. There is absolutely no merit in these allegations. Period. DONALD TRUMP
