Leon, 
I hate having to write this. however . I wanted you to understand the seriousness of your dysfunctional family office. I 
spent the last week reviewing it.. The office has su=fered from lack of control and clear direction. Eileen has been a 
nightmare=20 for you . she hammmered together the office in a willy nilly fashion either trying to hire c quality people, 
cheap eq=ipmnet, or once hired giiving no defined roles. she and ada protecting what they see as their turf, errors 
upon errors upon error=. millions of dollars unaccounted for. 500k again found in a drawer=20 last week In early sept I 
notified you that joslin was unable to deal=20 with both ada and eileen I sent delson in to referee.. at my expens= as 
well as others. i again notifed you in early oct that she needed to go. but needed her until=20 oct 15. and ada till 
march. I pointed out the risk of keeping the dynamic=duo was their effect on joslin. . in nov I sent you a email telling 
you i thought he coul= not take more of their interefernce. obfuscation and scheming. . this =eek, in the first face to 
face I had with him since dec he could not respond to simple questions , spoke finnacial gibberish, had misleading 
answers. bad answers wild elliptical statements. =As you asked i immediatley confronted brad with this , and to my 
amazment brad said that =is take was excatly the same but this is how he found him in early jan and thought it was just 
his normal behavior. Since brad has little financial expertise he asuumed the gibberis= was just his lack of understanding 
, In mid nov you suggested that your choice to run the office was Brad.and he would replace eileen. from mid dec he 
audited until early jan, when he assumed the job th=t im told is only 75% of his time. HE might. , might be capabl= of 
runing your office but i have yet to see any indication that that is true. ON thu=s I handed the same spread sheet that I 
had sent to brad, to four4>=A0 financial execs. (only to mine with actual numbers), to a person each=20 withim 
minutes said this makes no sense. no sense whatsoe=er, bad numbers bad cagtegories. bad inputs outputs numbers 
that dont add. if=20 it was an mri , of joslin i woudl say serious breakdown. 4>=A0I had him over to explain to my team 
what had happend, and then sent my do to speak for hours to him and others at elysium. I pointed out to you that 
jos=in could not make the first pass at hiring a finance person . I was right. HE is a great tax person, period. no social 
skills reporting skills or mgmt skills. ITS a mess and a larger one than I thought. sorry, I have begun to interview some 
cfo.s Q=A0and have put out more feelers. if you feel comfortable i think you should ask at apollo for=20 help.. It is now 
too late to remove eileen entirely as i had been*=A0 urgently requesting. I have not spokein to her in months . but 
during this cra=y delay in doing so, she is now significantly more entrenched. the off=ce more intricate entwined and a 
danger to you. A re-do is necessary . top down. 
you have repeatedly pointed out that you beleive you have paid me =hat you consider a great deal of money. you are 
one of my best friends. to say you made a good deal would be an understatment. I have spent the majority of the last 
year restructuring your things. I had cancel= my europe trips for the last six months of last year. I am both down 
money, friends and clients as a result of doing so. I take our =riendhsip very serioulsy and feel not one iota of regret 
though I made a bad deal ,lived up=to it. and exceeded my predictions 
that being said,r, you will need to bring in a few people to start from the top down. apollo review, coordination, 
4,=A0bill pay, book keeping, legal reporting,filings, sec gaming foreign, pfic=20 fbar gift gtax use tax, corporate admin, 
Ilc etc. investments art. household personla. taxes. gifts, admin for grats trusts children, chjecks =nd balances. banking 
doc review, tra review, brh review . review of will given=new info.. jpm goldman, db bam, check writing , foundation 
decision 
art consultants. boat plane. construction. travel. insurance, IT,. staff mgmt. w= will have to deal with torn ada, eileen, 
now joslin, . cerrtain protections=that you previously vocally declined to consider i think should be p=t in .
