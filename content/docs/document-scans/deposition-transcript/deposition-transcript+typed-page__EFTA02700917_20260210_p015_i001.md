The most obvious suspect would be the party responsible for Calvi's protection on the night he 
was killed, Flavio Carboni. He had organized Calvi's escape, his travels, his forged documents. 
his bodyguard, and his hotel room at the Chelsea Cloisters. He had also accompanied him in the 
private plane to London, and was in constant touch with him. So he had opportunity. 
He also had arranged Calvi's lone bodyguard, Vittor, who left Calvi unprotected that night. 
At about 5 pm that afternoon, Carboni, phoned Calvi from the London Hilton, where he was 
staying and told him to pack his bags since he had arranged for him to move to a flat (which was 
untrue.) According to Vittor, Carboni arrived at the Chelsea Cloisters in a taxi that evening, and 
met him at the front desk, but didn't go up to see Calvi, who was waiting for him to move him. 
Since Calvi was relying on Carboni to hide him, he presumably would have followed whatever 
instructions Carboni provided, such as getting into a car or even a bridge to await a boat. If so, 
whether or not he used them, Carboni had the means to get him to Blackfriars bridge without 
using force. 
Carboni also showed what might be construed as consciousness of guilt. Using a pseudonym, 
he left England by going to Scotland where he had a chartered jet waiting to fly him to 
Switzerland. ( Vittor, also using a pseudonym, took an early morning commercial flight to 
Austria.) 
And Carboni also had a motive: money. He had in his Swiss Bank account in Zurich $11 
million of money he had gotten from Calvi and which Calvi, if he had lived, night have used for 
his own purposes. More important, Calvi's death also provided Carboni with the contents of 
Calvi's black attache case. The last time Vittor saw Calvi, he had the bag, but, after his 
vanishing, the bag disappeared. The value of its content became clear only six years later. An 
Italian police raid on a smuggling suspect turned up copies of two letter apparently sent by 
registered mail Cardinal Agostino Casaroli, who then a high-ranking Vatican official. The letters 
said that the smuggler had advanced to Carboni $1 million to get from him incriminating 
documents written by Calvi. Since these documents had come from Calvi's missing black bag, 
they were bought to the attention magistrate, Mario Almerighi, who was investigating the Calvi 
affair. When I interviewed Judge Almerighi in Rome, he told me that the Vatican acknowledged 
to him that a Vatican bishop had written checks for S2 million to Carboni on Institute per le 
Opere di Religione, the Vatican's bank. The magistrate also uncovered a memo in which a 
Vatican official discussed paying S40 million to Carboni for other Calvi documents in the black 
bag. He concluded that these sensitive documents were being used, as he put it to me, "to 
blackmail the Pope." In tracing the scheme back to June 20, 1982, Judge Mario Almerighi, also 
found a witness who claimed to see Carboni gave envelope to a Vatican official the day after 
Calvi died. If Carboni believed the Vatican would pay to keep secret the documents Calvi had in 
his black bag, Calvi might have also been worth a great deal more dead than alive. 
Judge Almerighi, a self-styled Sherlock Holmes among investigating magistrates, prided 
himself on his deductive logic. One clue that caught his attention was the fact that Calvi shaved 
off the moustache he had worn his entire adult life on the day he was last seen in London by 
Vittor. "We know he had packed his bags, and was waiting for a car that evening, he had an 
escape plan," Judge Almerighi said. "Shaving the moustache would be necessary if he was told 
he was getting a new identity." His reasoning was that he was carefully following instructions 
when he delivered into the hands of a contract killer at the bridge. His theory of the case which 
was brought to trial was that Carboni took Calvi's black bag and then betrayed him. Since there
