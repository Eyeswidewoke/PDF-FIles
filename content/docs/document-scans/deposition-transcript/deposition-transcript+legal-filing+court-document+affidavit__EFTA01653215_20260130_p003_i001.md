Any statements from those individuals that they were not involved in scheduling sexual massages we would view as not 
credible. 
Maxwell, a, 
and Brunel were associates of Epstein. 
Maxwell was believed to be his girlfriend for many years, and it has been reported that she assisted in recruiting certain 
victims. She traveled extensively with Epstein and is reported to have had a sexual relationship with him and/or with 
certain underage girls. 
Brunel previously was a close friend and associate of Epstein; they subsequently had a falling-out in recent years and have 
been engaged in litigation against each other. Brunel has been reported to have recruited minors for sexual activity with 
Epstein, and to have himself participated in sexual activity with minors. Brunel ran a modeling agency that gave him 
access to young girls, and he has been previously reported to have engaged in predatory behavior in the modeling 
industry. 
has been reported to have been Epstein's "sex slave" from an early age, possibly including when she was a 
minor. She may have been a perpetrator of the conduct and may also have been a victim of Epstein. 
From all three we would want to know: 
• 
what their personal interactions were with young girls along with Epstein 
• 
what Epstein said to them about the young girls he was with or the massages or sex acts with them 
• 
whether they saw or participated in sexual activity with young or young-looking girls 
• 
the details of their travel with him, including with any young girls 
• 
what role they had in recruiting and paying young girls for Epstein 
• 
what young girls they observed traveling with Epstein 
• 
any discussions they had with Epstein about his activities with young girls 
• 
For 
in particular we would want to know how she came to be associated with Epstein 
was a recruiter of young girls for Epstein, and she has referred to herself as his "Heidi Fleiss." She may have been 
a minor during some of her conduct, and we believe Epstein attempted to victimize her. She has previously spoken with 
law enforcement, and she received immunity in the initial investigation and testified in the grand jury. 
• 
The goal of the approach of 
is to convey information to her about the investigation and to build rapport if 
possible. We do not need to question her about the substance of her knowledge or role regarding the conduct 
because she has previously given statements. 
• 
We believe she is unlikely to be willing to talk with agents, but if she is, we want to convey to her that we are 
interested in speaking with her to explain the status of the investigation, and that we understand she may have 
been victimized and/or coerced herself. We believe she also may currently qualify for court-appointed counsel, 
and she can call us to arrange the logistics for that. 
Wexner is a long-time friend and associate of Epstein, and has been reported to have had a decades-long business 
relationship with him. Wexner is a billionaire and a founder of The Limited clothing company. If he wants to voluntarily 
talk when he is approached, we are interested in knowing about his relationship with Epstein and his knowledge and 
observations of Epstein with young girls, but we expect he likely will just be a subpoena drop. 
**PLEASE NOTE" that for the following individuals we must take special precautions in the approach, in case they are 
represented by counsel in connection with this investi ation: 
• 
Leslie Groff, 
Ghislaine Maxwell, 
and 
For those individuals we MUST do the following:
