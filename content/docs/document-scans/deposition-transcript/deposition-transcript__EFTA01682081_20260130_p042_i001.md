He agreed to try to put off the hearing that is scheduled for this Fria' Broward 
County court and to try to arrange a meeting with him, 
and 
sometime 
between May 29 and June 2. 
The meeting was entirely amicable and I came away convinced thallifirmly believed 
that I have been falsely accused and wanted to make it right by getting me out of the case 
and by having her withdraw her false accusation. I said that if he did so, I would be 
happy to apologize to the lawyers for my statements, delivered in anger, after I learned 
about the false accusation. I have completed dictating this memo at 9:51AM and it 
based on my contemporaneous best recollection of what transpired at the meeting.

which ended with a private conversation in 
which he said "the lawyers who pu your name in the federal pleading, not only did a 
stupid think that hurt their clients, they also did the wrong thing. They never should have

Nick numerous questions and requested that he be shown the original records, especially 
cell phone records. He said that the records were very persuasive, very complete and 
very compelling. I told him that we could provide even more documentation, and that 
what he had seen was merely a work in progresiae said that the more complete the 
records the better he would be able to persuade Mild her other lawyers that it was 
impossible that I could be the person with whom she had six sexual encounters on the

Epstein oral sex while I stood next to him talking to him. He asked 
to show him 
the affidavit in which she made that claim and he seemed to be shocked by it. 
said that the best course of conduct would be to put off all legal proceedings until

time to supplement the current records with additional data. I agreed to that proposal and
