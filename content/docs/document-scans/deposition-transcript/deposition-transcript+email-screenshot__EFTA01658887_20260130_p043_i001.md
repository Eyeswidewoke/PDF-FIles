Rand Paul, Rep.-elect Greene Criticize Mask Mandates. The Washington Post 
(11/13, Armus, 14.2M) reports Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) in a Fox News interview on Thursday 
called on the millions of Americans who have recovered from the coronavirus to "celebrate." 
Paul added, "We should tell them to throw away their masks, go to restaurants, live again, 
because these people are now immune." However, the Post highlights that the "medically 
suspect comment from Paul, who tested positive for the virus in March, contradicts widespread 
public health guidance as well as consistent messaging from many doctors and scientists: There 
is no evidence that people who have already contracted the virus are now immune to it, they 
have repeatedly said. And there is a possibility they can still spread the virus to others." 
Meanwhile, the Washington Times (11/13, Munoz, 492K) reports Rep.-elect Marjorie 
Taylor Greene (R-GA) "criticized the Capitol's rules on masks Friday at the orientation for new 
members." According to the Times, "A mask mandate was implemented in the Capitol and 
House office buildings over the summer after Rep. Louie Gohmert, Texas Republican, tested 
positive for COVID-19 in July." 
Alito Describes Covid-19 As "Constitutional Stress Test." 
The Wall Street Journal (11/13, Bravin, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) reports Supreme Court 
Justice Samuel Alito in a speech on Thursday to the Federalist Society's National Lawyers 
Convention criticized liberal critics of the court and described coronavirus restrictions as a 
"previously unimaginable restrictions on individual liberty." Justice Alito added, "The Covid crisis 
has served as a sort of constitutional stress test, and in doing so it has highlighted disturbing 
trends that were already present before the virus struck." 
More Than 130 Secret Service Agents In Quarantine. 
According to the Washington Post (11/13, Al, Leonnig, Dawsey, 14.2M), "More than 130 Secret 
Service officers who help protect the White House and the president when he travels have 
recently been ordered to isolate or quarantine because they tested positive for the coronavirus 
or had close contact with infected co-workers." The Post adds, "The spread of the coronavirus -
which has sidelined roughly 10 percent of the agency's core security team - is believed to be 
partly linked to a series of campaign rallies that President Trump held." The Post does not say 
how many of the agents tested positive. 
Reuters (11/13, Hosenball, Chiacu) reports that "two U.S. government sources familiar 
with the situation confirmed to Reuters that Secret Service officers had tested positive for the 
virus but did not provide a specific number." According to Reuters, "One of the sources said a 
larger number of officers who had not tested positive had gone into quarantine as a protective 
measure." ABC World News TonightVI (11/13, story 5, 0:38, Muir, 6.44M), the CBS Evening 
NewsVi (11/13, story 3, 0:16, Tracy, 4.12M), and NBC Nightly NewsVi (11/13, story 4, 0:24, 
Jackson, 5.27M) provided similar coverage in brief broadcasts. 
Pfizer Could Apply For FDA's Emergency Authorization Of Vaccine As Soon As This 
Week. 
On ABC World News TonightVI (11/15, story 2, 2:15, Llamas, 4.5M), Elwyn Lopez reported 
Pfizer, "the first drug maker to release an early analysis of vaccine trial data," could apply for 
the FDA's emergency authorization "as early as this week." BioNTech CEO Ugur Sahin: "If 
everything continues to go well, we will start to deliver the vaccine end of this year, beginning 
next year." However, Lopez added, "Supplying and distributing millions of doses will not be 
easy." According to Lopez, "Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine needs to be stored at around minus 94 
degrees Fahrenheit. Big box pharmacies say they are ready, but smaller ones might be forced 
to rely on dry ice." She added, "Even though Pfizer says its vaccine is up to 90 percent 
effective, top health officials like Dr. Anthony Fauci say that public health measures such as 
social distancing and wearing masks will still need to be maintained even once you get a 
vaccine."
