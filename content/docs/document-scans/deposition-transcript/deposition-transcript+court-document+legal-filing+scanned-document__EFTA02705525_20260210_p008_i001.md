OPERATING MANUAL 
APU) are selected ON and either the MASTER CRANK or MASTER 
START switch is selected ON (isolation valve opens automatically) 
NOTE: 
To incorporate ASC 422 on SPZ-8000 equipped 
airplanes. ASC 327. 327A. 3278 and any associated 
amendments must first be incorporated. 
G. APU Bleed Air Distribution: 
The APU bleed air duct is connected to the right side of the bleed air 
manifold. Selection of the APU BLEED AIR switch (cockpit overhead panel, 
BLEED AIR section) to ON opens the APU's load control valve and the 
isolation valve. The ON legend in the switch illuminates. APU bleed air then 
flows through a check valve in the APU bleed air duct into the bleed air 
manifold. Should bleed air manifold pressure exceed APU bleed air 
pressure, the check valve in the APU bleed air duct will close to prevent 
reverse flow. 
API.) bleed air is inhibited while airborne. Only electrical power is available 
from the APU. 
H. External Air Distribution: 
(See Figure 9.) 
The external air duct is connected to the left side of the bleed air manifold. 
On the opposite end of the duct is a coupling where the external air cart is 
connected. The external air connection point is located in the underside of 
the fuselage, just forward of the hydraulic system service access door. With 
the proper external air can connected. the flight crew may use external air 
as required for engine starting. Should bleed air manifold pressure exceed 
external air duct pressure, a check valve installed in the external air duct 
will close to prevent reverse flow. 
I. Door Seal Pressure Distribution: 
(See Figure 
Figure 3 and Figure 6 through Figure 8.) 
The door seal pressure line and pressure regulator are connected to the 
bleed air manifold. Location of the line on the manifold is such that either 
the left or right bleed air system can furnish a supply of bleed air. The 
regulator is designed to provide 18 11 psi output to inflate the main 
entrance door and baggage door seals. For airplanes having the cargo 
door modification, door sealing is also provided by the door seal system for 
the cargo door. 
On airplanes SN 1285 and subsequent and airplanes SN 1000 through 
1284 having ASC 364. redundancy is added to the door seal system by 
routing an additional constant high pressure air source to the pressure 
regulator. (See Figure 2 and Figure 3 instead of Figure 1 and Figure 3.) 
This ensures maximum flow output from the pressure regulator to the door 
seals. Additional pressure lines, one for each engine, are ported into the 
12th stage bleed air duct upstream of the HP bleed air pressure regulator 
and shutoff valve. The line is routed Into the tail compartment, where it joins 
into the existing door seal pressure line. The existing door seal pressure 
line is then re-routed to separate the total air temperature probe aspiration 
pressure supply and water system pressure tap (for later outfitting) from
