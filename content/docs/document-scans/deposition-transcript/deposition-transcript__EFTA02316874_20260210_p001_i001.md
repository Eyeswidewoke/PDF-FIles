I feel after 1 I years of being a traveling assistant, it's time to redefine my role. I 
understand that it's best for you if I continue to travel since I have had the privilege of 
doing so for many years; however I need to start looking forward. As grateful as I am for 
the many years that I have traveled with you and all of the experiences that I never would 
have bad without you—I am at a point, where I want to channel the confidence and life 
experience that I built with working with you into something that I can call my own. 
I believe the past 6 months have been a good introduction/test period for how things can 
be structured going forward. I would like to step out of the traveling assistant role and be 
more of a managing figure for the future traveling assistants 
as well as the 
NY and PB staff. I would continue to handle any household/personal projects for you 
either from NY or remotely. I am fully confident that I can help train, manage and 
oversee the other assistants who will travel with you, knowing that you will be in good 
hands. Despite your trip to California in August, I feel this has worked out relatively well 
in the past 6 months. I would love to et a better understanding of what expectations were 
not met and where I can coach 
to better anticipate and satisfy yours needs. 
However, I do think that the more trips a new travel assistant takes, the better and more 
natural they will be at it. 
has a great handle on what needs to be done on these trips 
and we can start training 
to have more responsibility if you want her to take on this 
type of role. I can put together a manual for travel for different circumstances; your 
homes, domestic destinations, foreign countries, etc. The manual would cover everything 
they need to think about, be aware of, be prepared for, and of course I am always 
available to help guide them anytime. 
Considering the timing of the upcoming Europe/Africa trip, and my planned absence from 
it
 to continue on as we have the past few months and begin right away with 
as the main traveling assistants. If you feel in 6 months it doesn't seem to be 
working out, we can reevaluate the situation. 
I very much want to grow as a person, to challenge myself and accomplish something on 
my own. You are family to me and I have cherished the time that I have been by your side 
but now I need to devote some time to focusing on more personal endeavors such as a 
home accessories line, custom back gammon boards, The Style Skinny book with Kathryn, 
etc. but still being an asset to you. You are a life mentor to me. I have always looked to 
you for advice and you have always had my best interests at heart; something that I hope 
will never change.
