Microsoft, because such a presence can work to create a standard computer language that other companies can design 
products for and that the public can use in common. That is the =role I.B.M. played, and now that I.B.M. has been 
dethroned, thanks partly to Microsoft, people expect Microsoft to perform it. 
One big difference between Gates and other early software entrepreneurs is that, whereas the others were bright kids 
from middle-class homes who achieved success beyond their expectations, Gates was born to rule. His childhood was 
emphatically not the stuff of Horatio Alger novels. His father, Bill Gates, Jr., is a well-known corporate lawyer in Seattle 
and a former president of the Washington State Bar Association, and his mother, Mary Gates, is a former regent at the 
University of Washington and was on the national board of the United Way and of U S West. Washington State 
governors and =senators were guests at the house when Bill was a boy. At dinner, the parents would lead the children--
Bill and his sisters, Kristi and Libby--in discussions of current affairs. The family also played a lot =of games and horsed 
around together. "I really like Bill's family, but =it would be nice if you could talk to them once in a while when they 
weren't in a human pyramid," Ida Cole, a former Microsoft executive, has said. Water-skiing was and remains a passion 
of Gates': several Seattleites have described for me the experience of coming across the Evergreen Bridge early on a 
Sunday morning in the summer and seeing Gates' big powerboat on Lake Washington, with Gates' white, toneless body 
water-skiing behind it and throwing up a big coxcomb of spray. Young Bill was obsessive about improving aspects of 
himself he didn't like. "He was always upset about his little toe curling in, so he'd work on it. He'd spend time holding it 
out so he'd have a straight toe," his sister Kristi told Stephen Manes and Paul Andrews, the co-authors of "Gates," a 
recently published biography. Gates used to try to impress his sisters by jumping out of a trash can, and he still 
occasionally jumps over his office chair from a standstill. Sometimes, on his way to = business meeting, he suddenly 
jumps up and tries to touch as high as he can on a wall, or to touch higher than the spot he touched last time, =but he 
says, in "Gates," "I don't jump spontaneously the way I used to, =in the early years of the company ... or even in a 
meeting.... Now =the jumping is not that common." However, he has planned a full-size trampoline for a house he is 
building. In Japan, a comic book about the =adventures of a boy modeled on Bill Gates is called "Young Jump." 
Gates attended Lakeside School, one of the best private schools in the Seattle area, and there he met Paul Allen, who 
was three years older. The two began spending a lot of time in the school's computer room. In 1971, when Gates was 
sixteen, he wrote a program that made it easier for cities to collect traffic statistics. That same year, he and Allen started 
a company called Traf-o-Data. In the Lakeside yearbook for 1973, Gates' senior year, there is a picture =of Gates in the 
computer room with a stocking cap pulled over his head =and lying on a table, over the caption "Who is this man?" 
Joseph Weizenbaum, a computer scientist at M.I.T., perhaps overstating the case a little for effect, wrote, in "Computer 
Power and Human Reason," this early portrait of computer hackers: "Bright young men of disheveled appearance, often 
with sunken glowing eyes, [who] can be seen sitting at computer consoles ... on which their attention seems to be as 
riveted as a gambler's on the rolling dice.... They work until they nearly drop, twenty, thirty hours at a =time. Their 
food, if they arrange it, is brought to them: coffee, Cokes, sandwiches.... Their rumpled clothes, their unwashed and 
unshaven faces, and their uncombed hair all testify that they are oblivious to their bodies and to the world in which they 
move." This description matches Gates' outward appearance, but Gates was different from most hackers in one 
important respect: Hackers were interested in computers =as a hobby, mostly just for fun, whereas Gates always saw 
computers as a way of making money. 
Gates and Allen sometimes talked about how cool it would be to design the software for the first personal computer, 
which =appeared to be on the horizon, but this was not a serious career goal of Bill's. His father wanted him to become a 
lawyer. "When I was in college, it was really hard to pick a career, because everything seemed =so attractive, and when 
you had to pick a specific one you had to say no to all the others," Gates told me. "I'd think, Well, if I went to that =law 
firm some partner might not like me, and they might assign me to these crummy cases, and I'd think, Well, God, that 
could be really crummy." The question was settled in dramatic fashion in December, 1974, when Allen, who was working 
in Boston, passed a newsstand in Harvard Square and saw on the cover of Popular Electronics a computer called the 
Altair 8800. The Altair 8800 was the first computer that ordinary electronics hobbyists could afford to buy and that 
people with reasonable technical knowledge could assemble in their homes. Basically, it was the first personal
