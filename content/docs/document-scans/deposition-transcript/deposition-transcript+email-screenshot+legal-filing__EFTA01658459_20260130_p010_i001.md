publicly denied it, no one has presented evidence to the contrary - nor can they, because there 
is none." The Washington Examiner (8/10, Dunleavy, 448K) reports Johnson also stated, 
"Democrats and many in the media have mainly focused their criticism of our investigation on 
the Biden component of our oversight. ... They have once again decided to weaponize a false 
'Russian disinformation' narrative as a tool for attacking their political opponents." 
The Wall Street Journal (8/10, Subscription Publication, 7.57M), The Hill (8/10, Carney, 
2.98M), Courthouse News (8/10, Rodgers, 2K), National Review (8/10, Evans, 731K), The New 
York Post (8/10, Moore, 4.57M), The Washington Examiner (8/10, Dunleavy, 448K), and The 
Milwaukee Journal Sentinel (8/10, Gilbert, 632K), among other news outlets, also report the 
story. 
Graham: "I'm Going To Find Out Why" FBI "Told The Same Lies" About Steele 
Dossier. Fox News (8/10, Halon, 27.59M) reports the FBI under Director Christopher Wray's 
"leadership deceived lawmakers on the Senate Intelligence Committee during a 2018 briefing 
on the Russia investigation, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham told 
'Hannity' Monday, citing a document he obtained from the Department of Justice." Graham said, 
"A year after they knew the Russian dossier was no longer reliable, they told the same lies to 
the Congress, not just the [FISA) court, as a completely new front of legal liability, and I'm 
going to find out what happened." Graham called on FBI Director Christopher Wray to address 
why "the Senate Intel Committee was briefed about the dossier and the Russian subsource in 
the same fashion that the FISA court was briefed," which Graham called "very misleading." 
National Review (8/10, Evans, 731K) also reports. 
DC Circuit To Hear Oral Arguments In Michael Flynn Case Tuesday. 
Just Security (8/10, Geltzer) reports the DC Circuit will rehear oral arguments in the case 
against Michael Flynn "en banc, in this instance in front of ten judges" on Tuesday. The outlet 
suggests that key points during the hearing will revolve around: whether judges believe the 
court "needs to take the unusual step of intervening now, on the emergency posture of a 
mandamus petition, to prevent the district court from proceeding, or can any potential concerns 
with how the district court handles the case be addressed later, on ordinary appeal;" the 
definition of "leave of court;" the "particularities of the Flynn case and the nature of further 
proceedings in the district court;" and if the case should "be reassigned to a different district 
judge." 
In an op-ed for The Washington Post (8/10, Zolle, 14.2M), Constitutional Accountability 
Center appellate counsel Dayna Zolle writes the DC Circuit "should deny Flynn's request to 
order the automatic dismissal of his case and should instead allow the district court to consider 
the public interest in determining whether dismissal is appropriate. That would serve the 
interests of justice, if not of this Justice Department." 
In an editorial, The Washington Times (8/10, 492K) writes that "Americans are waiting for 
a final resolution that frees Mr. Flynn, a long-suffering public servant. An endless cycle of 
prosecution is itself a form of punishment. It should never have happened." 
Former Student Says Halper Predicted Flynn's Ouster. The Washington Times 
(8/10, Scarborough, 492K) reports that Steven P. Schrage, a "onetime associate of FBI spy 
Stefan Halper says the University of Cambridge professor told him that retired Army Lt. Gen. 
Michael Flynn was 'unsuitable' for the post of President Trump's national security adviser." 
Halper told Schrage, "I don't think Flynn's going to be around long." Halper's comments to 
Schrage, who was a doctoral candidate at Cambridge at the time, "were recorded on Jan. 10, 
2017, two days before a Washington Post column on Flynn led to his quick White House 
dismissal." the Post adds that Schrage "outed himself Sunday as a whistleblower with a post, 
'The Spies Who Hijacked America,' on journalist Matt Taibbi's blog."
