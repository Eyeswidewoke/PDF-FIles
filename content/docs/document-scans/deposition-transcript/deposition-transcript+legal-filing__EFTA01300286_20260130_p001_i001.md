The variability of PRICES as we discussed 
But are the laws correct? For Aristotle, their power lay in their intuitive truth, 
their accord with our common sense. Yet Aristotle himself does not view statements as 
either true or false. In the Metaphysics, a few pages before announcing the Law of the 
Excluded Middle, he says, "The more and the less are still present in the nature of 
things" and adds that one who thinks 4 equals 5 is more correct than the one who 
thinks 4 equals 1,000.13 In De Interpretatione, he uses the terms truer and falser. Even 
for him, truth has degrees. 
In fact, Aristotle provides a wealth of arguments against his own axioms. The 
most famous involves ships clashing at sea. In Chapter 9 of De Interpretatione, he 
ponders the statement: 
There will be a sea battle tomorrow. 
True? Not true? 
A determinist would argue that, at this instant, it must be either true or false. Events 
are preordained, by divine hand or physical law. If we knew enough about celestial will 
or the sequence of causes, we could tell right now whether it were true or false. We 
don't, but it doesn't matter. At this moment, the statement is either true or false. 
A nondeterminist would demur. Events are not preordained, so at this moment 
it may be impossible for us to know the answer, even with total knowledge. God may 
reconsider or random acts may jostle causality. The answer may simply not exist yet. If 
so, the statement is currently neither true not false, but inderterminate. 
De Interpretatione is a dense, muddled work, and the crucial Chapter 9 is so 
opaque that scholars still contest its meaning. However, it appears to set forth these 
arguments, half-heartedly reject determinism, and conclude that "There will be a sea 
battle tomorrow" has an intermediate truth-value. A gap opens at the hairline. The Law 
of the Excluded Middle ebbs away. 
This question exerted great historical influence. In the Middle Ages, both 
Christian and Muslim thinkers tended to accept only two values for the sea battle, yet 
some scholars took up where Aristotle left off. Duns Scotus (c. 1265-c. 1308) toyed with 
a third value straight from Aristotle, as did William of Ockham (c. 1300-1349), he of the 
famous razor. In the 201h century, this chapter would spur Jan Lukasiewicz to revolt 
against both laws. 
The sea battle caused much spume to fly, but Aristotle made other important 
reservations too. 
First, silhouette definitions are crucial to Aristotle's logic. Definitions are the 
hairline. They must cleanly separate items into chair and not-chair. Yet at the outset of 
De Anima, he admits the difficulty of finding any method of definition. It is a remarkable 
concession, for if we can't specify the hairline, classes blur at the edges and the whole 
two-values system becomes an artiface. He glozes over this problem in his works on 
logic, most likely for pragmatic reasons. 
In the Nicomachean Ethics, Aristotle simply jettisons the axioms when discussing 
his famous golden mean. Here, an array of qualities possess a middle, usually the apex
