Consider that the experience of television violates innate biological rhythms programmed into the genetic homeostatic 
constitution from the earliest evolutionary eras. These biological rhythms are invisible, yet nevertheless are information in 
terms of the experience of the brain. The most obvious and perhaps least recognized rhythm is the day / night, light / dark 
flicker. The experience is a constant input of information for the brain,39 effecting change without consent or awareness. Note 
also recent experiments indicating that acein all animal species gonadal activity is increased by light rays reaching the retina. 
. . . As is the case for other biological cycles, interference with the natural cycles of light exposure can result in physiological 
disturbances. . . . Until the last century, man lived in the dark for long hours during the winter months, and this is still true in 
many primitive societies. Modem man, in contrast, was exposed to bright light for sixteen hours a day throughout the year. In 
view of the fact that light rays can affect hormonal activities, and that many, if not most physiological functions are linked to 
circadian and seasonal cycles, it seems possible that this change in the ways of life had long range consequences for the 
human speciesle 
Television, as direct experience, can be considered in this instance on two levels. First, it is a potent source of light. The 
cathode-ray experience is the only instance where man looked directly into a light source for any sustained period, possibly 
averaging four hours a day. Light is actually projected onto the retina by the cathode-ray tube. Second, man responded not 
only to light perceived by the senses but also to factors of biological rhythms such as the day / night flicker. Television alters 
this rhythm violently. Man talked about the violence evident on television programs. In light of the above considerations he 
might have developed a ficeTheory of Neural Programs, Television, and Violence:a which hypothesized that acedue to 
circumstances beyond our control, this tprogramãTM is out of order,a which is to say that licethere may well be limits beyond 
which the natural rhythms are not amenable to frequency synchronization with new environmental periodicities.541 Violence. 
ficeWeirmre talking.a The direct experience of the brain is communicated. Communicated through information. Man ceased 
to exist when nonlinear extension of experience was comprehended. It always existed, but now, once again, items time to 
say, ikeWeandre talkingli Thought control? Absolutely. Them is one hundred percent thought control. Indeed, any 
considerations on this level are beyond manaTMs morality. it is a question of a major leap in evolution. 
We arc beyond space and time; we are beyond good and evil. There is only information. It is the control, the measure by 
which the operation of the brain changes. There is always complete control. 
Man was always blind to considerations of the present. In the transactional present, manaTMs brain was continually coded 
through information. This information was of manaTMs own devising. Man determined what he would be, what he would 
think. This ordering took place in the present. But man, who made the mistake of confusing abstraction and reality, deluded 
himself into thinking he was conscious, and then proclaimed that this consciousness, this delusion, was reality. There are 
several stumbling blocks to communication between linear and nonlinear systems. The major one is that linear systems do not 
exist. All that exists are the operations of the brain, the direct experience, a nonlinear oscillation. 
Instead of looking to the world of man, to the linear abstractions, to the conscious motivations, etc., attention must be turned 
to a universe of control patterns, patterns of complete control, the nonlinear process of neural activity. The message in this 
system is the communication of pattern. accA message need not be the result of a conscious human effort for the transmission 
of ideastlz Work on the level of deciphering the patterns that have always existed but that man hardly even suspected. 
Consider the notion of power engineering: aceThe main function of power engineering is transmission of energy or power 
from one place to another with its generation by appropriate generators and its employment by appropriate motors or lamps 
or other such apparatus. So long as this is not associated with transmission of a particular pattern, as for example in processes 
of automatic control, power engineering remains a separate entity with its own techniquer Man was a separate entity with 
its own technique. The unity is methodological. Concentrate on communication of operant pattern. The only experience that
