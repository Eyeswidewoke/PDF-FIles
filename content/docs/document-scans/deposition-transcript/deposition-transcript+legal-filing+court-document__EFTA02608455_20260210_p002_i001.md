opportuni=tic reasons, many are now criticizing the federal decision-makers at the t=me, including now-Secretary of 
Labor Alex Acosta (then-United States Attor=ey in south Florida), for not going far enough. 
The critics are wrong on the facts and the la=. They also ignore a fact going to the heart of 
fundamental fairness: =AO In the decade since paying his debt to society, Jeffrey Epstein ha= led a life characterized by 
responsible citizenship, numerous acts of gen=rosity and good deeds. 
Here are the true key facts: Jeffrey Epstein, a successful =elf-made businessman with no prior 
criminal history whatsoever, engaged in=illegal conduct that amounted to solicitation of prostitution. =C2 That conduct 
was wrong and a violation of Florida state law. =AO Although no coercion, violence, alcohol, drugs or the like were 
involve=, some of the women he paid were under the age of 18. Those =A0facts were carefully assessed by experienced 
state sex crime prosecutors=who aggressively enforce state criminal laws. No one turned a blind =ye to potential 
offenses to the public order. To the contrary, the P=lm Beach State Attorney's Office conducted an extensive fifteen-
month =nvestigation, led by the chief of the Sex Crimes Division. Mr. Epste=n was then indicted by the state grand jury 
on a single felony count of so=icitation of prostitution. 
=/u> 
During that intense investigati=n, the state prosecutors extensively gathered and analyzed the 
eviden=e, met face-to-face with many of the asserted victims, considered their cr=dibility — or lack thereof — and 
considered the extent of =xculpatory evidence, including sworn testimony from many th=t they lied about being 
eighteen years old to be allowed into Mr. Epstein=E2 s home. After months of negotiations, the state prosecutors 
=elieved they had reached a reasoned resolution of the matter that vindicat=d the public interest — a resolution entirely 
consistent with that=of cases involving other similarly-situated defendants. The system w=rked as it should have. 
=/p> 
Then, in came the feds. The United States Attorney's =ffice extensively and aggressively 
investigated whether Mr. Epstein had en=aged in a commercial human trafficking ring, targeted minors, or used=the 
internet or traveled interstate in the process. But that =99s not what this was and that's not what happened. =AO That 
is precisely why the federal authorities' ultimate de=ision to defer prosecution to the state was the right one. =/span>
