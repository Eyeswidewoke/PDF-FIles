August. He had been working hard for one year to find a solution. He had agreed to postpone 
twice the submission of the report because of the importance of reaching an agreement. The 
Secretary-General believed that in the current regional context it was critical that Israel and 
Turkey salvaged their relationship. He very much looked forward to a full restoration of 
Turkey's relations with Israel. He enquired whether there was progress in the private talks 
with Israel and if the Minister saw any chance for a successful outcome in the next few days 
before the Panel submitted its report. 
The Foreign Minister thanked the Secretary-General for his personal efforts in this 
case. In the current context, it was even more important to keep a positive atmosphere in the 
region. Turkey wanted to be able to keep mediating between the Israeli and Palestinians. 
They had reached an agreement with Israel a month ago, but it had been blocked by some in 
the Israeli government. Mr. Netanyahu had called the Mr. Erdogan the day before to inform 
him that there would be a cabinet meeting on Wednesday. The situation was clear for 
Turkey: if Israel accepted the agreement, made apologies and compensated the victims, they 
would send their Ambassador back to Israel and would not talk about the incident anymore. 
On the other hand, if Israel didn't accept the agreement, they would take the next steps, 
which were very clear: they would challenge the legality of the blockade in the ICJ, support 
the victims in any tribunal in the world, close the Embassy in Tel Aviv, send their navy to the 
Mediterranean "to show the Israelis that the sea didn't belong to them". The US State 
Secretary and President were both working hard to convince the Israelis to accept the 
agreement. 
The Secretary-General hoped that these measures would not be necessary. Foreign 
Minister Davutoglu replied that Turkey was a country of dignity that could not accept that his 
citizens be killed. The international community had not reacted, the Government had to react. 
"If it had been Iran or Syria killing people, the international community would have reacted", 
he said. The international community was weak, but Turkey would show Israel that it was 
not weak. On Monday, when the Palmer report would be issued, Turkey would take the next 
steps. "Nobody can stop us. We know what to do", Davutoglu concluded. The Secretary-
General recalled that it had not been easy to convince Israel to the establishment of the Panel. 
He had personally been involved in convincing them. He underlined that he had no influence 
on what the Panel would say. Foreign Minister Davutoglu appreciated the efforts of the 
Secretary-General, but informed him that Turkey would challenge the legality of the 
blockade in the ICJ if Palmer said it was legal. The Secretary-General concluded by stating 
that the most important was to improve the relations between Israel and Turkey.
