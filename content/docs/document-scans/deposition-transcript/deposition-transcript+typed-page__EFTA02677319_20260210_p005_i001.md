"Designing Digital Knowledges: Production. Action, Labor* (Track C & M) This course takes up the 
principals, priorities and possibilities of Speculative Digital Humanities as they are articulated In 
Johanna Drucker's Speclab, and moves through a set of readings and exercises that will 
encourage us to consider `imaginary solutions" (Alfred May) to the problems of bringing 
humanities-based inquiry and creation to the digital and vice versa. We will also study a range of 
digital projects that —exist— and figure out what they do. how they work and study them through 
the lens of our key terms: Knowledge, Production. Action. Design and Labor. This course includes 
work on feminist, queer and critical race code studies, network theory. digital media research and 
creation, database studies and online archiving and 'anti-archiving,' the politics and practices of 
Immaterial labor and the impact of Web 2.0 'sharing economies' on digital humanities inquiry and 
production. Ultimately, students will develop plans for project-specific digital architectures and 
material worlds. This is not a programming course, but students with backgrounds in 
programming are welcome to bring their skills to this class! (Track C &

CRN 6831 Sec A 
'Non-human animals have been represented in various forms of media throughout history. From 
ancient instances of illustration upon cave walls paintings to the plethora of modern day visual 
media. images of —the animarlf have consistently been produced by all human societies, and for 
a variety of complex purposes. This course traces the manykey instances of animal portrayal 
through the agesdifferent epochs. with emphasis on identifying the ways in which humans interact 
with, and maintain, relationships with animals through the creation of their mediated image. 
Drawing upon sociological and philosophicalinterdisciplinary theoretical viewpoints that explore 
the subject of the animal and humans—conceptions— of them. we examine and question potential 
psychological motivations and consequences involved in creating and interacting with animals via 
their presentation as emblems, friends, and partners. companions, humanized characters, and 
wild others. Examination of visual media is key to the course and students are expected to 
contribute image visual examples to the online course blog for collective analysis. as well as and 
co-creation of a digital gallery that will have an online opening at the end of the semester

*Experimental Film: Sites and Spaces* (Track M & 5) The history and scope of experimental or 
avant-garde cinema has been closely tied to. but also significantly separate from, the practices of 
the an world, on one hand. and commercial Hollywood filmmaking, on the other. Situated between 
these two poles. it has developed into many distinct and overlapping cultures characterized by 
artisanal modes of filmmaking. independent theatrical and distribution channels, auxiliary print 
and screening practices, and often highly charged debates concerning medium specificiry, 
aesthetics, and politics. This course maps the multiple spaces in which experimental film has 
flourished, from the underground bohemia of downtown New York City and the rural isolation of 
Stan Brakhage's Colorado outpost. to the 'minor and 'minority cinemas that sprung up on the 
outskirts of Hollywood and the found footage experiments of contemporary artists in Vienna. 
Additionally the course examines notions of space as articulated in experimental film and media. 
including dry symphonies, landscape film, expanded cinema, and modes of ethnographic 
encounter. In each of the course's many sites of articulation, we will pay close attention to the 
avant-garde's impulse to locate, in film, video, and digital media, spaces of political resistance. 
personal expression, and aesthetic possibility. 'Track M & SJ

*Feminist and Queer Affect Studies* (Track C) This course develops close studies of current 
issues in feminist and queer theory. Our readings revolve around contemporary feminist and queer 
studies of affect. or the politics of feeling 0 a central concern for feminist and queer research since 
the early 1990s. and a critical component to what has been referred to as 'the affective turn' in 
studies of social, cultural and political life (Clough and Halley 2007). Students will be introduced to 
the major texts, issues and debates in the field which explore questions such as: how are 
ostensibly private and individualized feelings related to very public and shared structures of 
power? How are feelings gendered, racialized. sexualized and classed? How do we mobilize 
private. antisocial feelings towards public, social, political and cultural change? (Track CJ
