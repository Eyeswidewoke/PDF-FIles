without a doubt , one of the 
smartest people i have ever met, lu am well aware of his past problems , but i am a firm believer

he is neither fluent in spanish french or italian however he is highly conversant and 
multilingual in the areas of the most advanced science. He can exquisitely conduct a seminar in 
fields as diverse as evolutionary biology, computational neuro science.oreven the highly esoteric 
ndimensional manifolds. ,as well as music as a lens into the brain. His interests are far ranging 
and unlike many that simply repeat back what they have read , he is creative and original in fields 
such ase , signal intelligence, power law distributions , and encryption. 
I am well aware that in his past he has made some awful decisions, and Im sure he would have 
done things differently if he had the opportunity to do them over. however he has paid his debt 
to society, asked his friends and family for forgiveness and has continued his charitable work that 
he began even decades before his travails. 
i have had the privilege to meet the worlds greatest minds, and i can easily say that Jeffrey s is 
amongst the best of those. 
I have utmost confidence in his integrity. I have dealt with him for a number of years on both 
sides of a negotiation and say with certainty that I;d rather be on his side. 
He has been in the Billionaire business for longer than almost anyone else. His insight into the 
unique problems of the super wealthy , has been invaluable to many others that i know. He found 
a niche in the early 80s discerning the burdens of hyper wealth and from his time on the board of 
Rockefeller or his time at the trilateral commission, the common refrain from those he has come 
in contact with Jeffrey has made me think differently about. ....//. 
He has an extraordinary ability with numbers , complex concepts. mixed with a sometimes 
brutal honesty, refreshing, a sense of humor that some find highly cultured others find just 
outright silly, 
His homes are probably the best collection of real estate in the united states. A private island , 
that some describe as a tribute to megalomania. and a ranch in new mexico that is truly beyond 
imagination and my favorite townhouse in NY. HIs attention to detail is remarkable . I find it 
sad that he doesn't have children of his own, but makes up for it by maintaining close friendships 
that have lasted for decades. 
His chariblae instincts have been honed over many years and his advice and judgment has been 
invaluable in several instances. 
His ability to explain complex derivatives or concepts on the bleeding edge of science in layman's
