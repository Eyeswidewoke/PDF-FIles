I think (but don't know) that Dan found Kosoy th=ough Jim McCann who has had some dealing over the years 
with Kosoy. Kosoy is a Toron=o based real estate developer who buys distressed real estate and value adds(=he Sterling 
Companies/Sterling Centrecorp) and NPCM is a mortgage fund he foun=ed in the Bahamas in 2007 and runs. He was also 
involved in buying a bank in t=e Turks and Caicos. 
Dan is very uncomfortable with Kosoy. He says he r=grets borrowing from Kosoy who "strung him along" "until 
he had no other alternatives". I notice that he had to give NPCM a second mortgage on 210 Miraflores- a house and lot 
adjacent to the Phipps Estate lot on which Dan lives- as additional security for the second on 1220. Since, I don't thin= 
there is much more than $500,000 equity in 210 Miraflores, it seems that th=re was a hard bargain. 
Dan says that TD was very obliging in entering int= an agreement (a Mortgage Subordination Agreement) but I 
read it and find it a strict subordination agreement, with several restrictions on what NPCM can do in t=e event of 
default. TD does give NPCM an option to buy the first for all amounts secured (including fees, advances a=d expenses) 
for a scant 10 days after notice of default. Nevertheless, TO ask=d for and got in exchange: a $998,000 principal 
paydown, a $1=041,379 interest reserve and a $137,849 tax reserve. (This was in January 2011.) This correlates to the 
use of proceeds=he provided above. TD also got Dan's wife, Karen, as a guarantor. Dan alread= is a guarantor. 
Dan has discussed a refi nancing of the NPC M seco=d with TD and says that TD would welcome it but wants an 
additional $1 million paydow= plus an interest and tax reserve similar to what TD required in January. 4=iv> 
Dan's Finances 
I did not ask him to explain his financial conditi=n at this stage but it seems obvious that he is illiquid from his 
"no alternative=94 comment and his characterization of the $1,467,000 balance of the proposed =oan proceeds as "for 
Dan to live on". I also think he has a problematic net=worth. 
His visible real assets seem to be: 
1220 South Ocean. He has reduced the price =0 $64,900,000 and now owes $26,600,000. "Survey says" a $40 
number. Thus,=Swanson's equity could range anywhere from 0 (if it doesn't sell before November) t= say $14,000,000. 
See discussion below. 
205 Via Tortuga (Lot 17, Phipps Estates) (H= lives in a house this land). He has a mortgage linked to a $6 million 
credit line extended by Northern Trust secured by this property and an adjacent lot (207 Via Tortuga). This note has a 
variable interest rate and the "final due date" is October 2018. 205 Via Tortuga= might be worth $5,000,000. 
207 Via Tortuga (Lot 18, Phipps Estates). T=is lot is adjacent to his house and covered by the same Northern 
Trust mortgage. It i= about 20,000 sf and is listed with McCann for 55,500,000 but is probably wo=th around $4,000,000. 
Swanson's equity in 205 + 207 Via Tortuga combin=d (assuming the $6 million Northern line is fully drawn) is in 
the $3,000,000 range. 
210 Miraflores is an older 2000 sf Bermuda =ouse adjacent to his Phipps lots. He rents it out. He paid $350,000 
in 1995 and =wes $700,000 on a 20 yr self-amortizing mortgage. He pledged it as additional security for the 1220 second 
held by NPCM in January 2011. It is probably w=rth $1,300,000. 
Interest in 101 El Bravo Th=s is the spec house listed at $47 million. Jim Patterson o= Louisville is his partner. 
McCann (who has the listing) says that they have=had offers up to $30 million but Patterson has turned them down. Jim 
is allowed=to say a deal can be made in the upper $30s but it seems there is buyer "reluctance" above $30. There is a 
$25,000,000 mortgage on it through U=S. Bank N.A. which was put in place in February 2011. If they could get $30M, 
Swans=n's equity would presumably be $2,500,000 possibly less. (They =aid $16.5M for the land in 2007.) 
This indicates Swanson's net worth from PB real =state is in the $6 million range + his equity in 1220 South 
Ocean which as discussed co=Id be zero to $14M. 
This does not account for cash, securities, other =usiness interests, any other real estate outside PB, and 
tangibles. I do not have a=y information about these. I do not know of other assets and I do not think h= has a pending 
project. 
He does have a pending and very active lawsuit aga=nst him by Leo Vecellio (Ranger Construction) who bought 
589 N County. This is a very acrimonious suit. Vecellio is seeking several million in damages for construction defects and 
rec=ntly amended the suit to allege fraud by Dan, his wife, and his backer Dean DeSantis (son of Carl of Rexall-Sundo=n) 
and his wife. The fraud alleged is that Dan concealed water damage during construction due to hurricanes. This is well 
publicized and seems to be get=ing nastier and I assume very expensive to defend.
