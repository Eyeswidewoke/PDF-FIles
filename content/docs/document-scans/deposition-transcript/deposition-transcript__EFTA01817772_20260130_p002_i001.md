Mi
to bismol , has saved millions of lives. saved lives. the side effect was staying alive.. 
I am willing to advise you, guide you , help you, if you want. IF it is more important for 
you to " be right" , then really learn something useful and new, I completely understand, You 
are your own person with your own tightly held beliefs and you have done a remarkably good 
job of getting what you want .. I remain your friend jeffrey

you are too smart to believe that what is good for you , a twenty tvairear old healthy girl , 
with wonderful genes. has any benefit for someone less fortunate.. M, medicine and Health 
are serious fields , they do not and cannot and should not be related to your personal beliefs. 
or your personal health. I encourage you to learn real things. universtity classes. that offer 
recoginzed degrees. as opposed to magical, belief sgounded in nothing more than your own 
personal experience and folk law. Spending time in the lab is the result of a desire to work 
really hard to help people. Polio small pox,dysentery were not cured or helped by hundereds 
of people over hundreds of years, these terrible disease were only cured by western 
medicice in a laboratory, with real results that can be duplicated,

How many side effects has this pepto bismol... You heal one place in our body,but destroy 
little by little others... At least than you r busy healing yourself all the time... And 
pharmacists make good money :) 
All the pains is for the reason I think. you ate bad-next day you will have headache,you have 
cramps on your period-deal with it,bec mother nature is preparing u for labor!!! And here 
everybody is crazy about all pills! 
I am not a genius that spends hours in labatory but I listen to my body.

I prefer talking on the phone than emails. ( old recipe? ) , PLease read all about double blind 
studies, and what it means for rational thinking. Also the difference between cause and 
coincidence. I feel sad when people like Richard and his Wife Corey, tell me I am being 
careless , by not taking the time to explain things to you. They thought you were 
charming, and pretty , but would always be at a disadvantage , by not taking the time to 
learn real things as opposed to eastern europe superstitions masquarading as facts . They 
tortured me, with the idea that young women of your age , could still be confused about 
things that make you feel good , and things that cure disease. prayer, homeopathy, foot 
cleansing, energy work, have been with us for thousands of years, not one of those has the 
same power as pepto bismol. the drug store cheap solution to digestive issues.for example
