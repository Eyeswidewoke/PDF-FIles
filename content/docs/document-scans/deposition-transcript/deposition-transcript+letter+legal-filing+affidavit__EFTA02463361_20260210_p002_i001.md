You might recall that we "met" by email and on the phone a c=uple of years ago, originally through our 
mutual friend Bernard Kruger. =A0 
I have a question for you. I am preparing a lawsuit against the =roward County Sheriff's Department. I 
am looking for a good and =rustworthy private investigator there who will not undercut me with the Sh=riff's 
department because of ties there, etc. I have a couple of=candidates; but someone recently referred me to one in 
Davie, FL who this =erson said would fit the bill. 
When I went on the guy's website, however, I see that one of the t=ings he apparently holds out as a 
highlight (it is on his "press"= page) is a series of stories about your case. I assume the guy was =n investigator for the 
other side in the civil case - the group that set y=u up. 
His name is Mike Fisten and his company is Blueline Investigations. =AO If he is someone who you 
encountered and he was a bad guy or out to get=you, I would not want to use him. Even though we don't really kn=w 
each other, I very much liked you when we spoke and I would not want to =ive business to someone who had gone after 
you and you think is a bad=guy. If on the other hand, he was a decent guy just doing his job, p=rhaps it would be ok. I 
can't tell enough about it from his webs=te. 
Any thoughts on the guy? 
Meanwhile, I hope all is going well for you now and I wish you a happy=and healthy new year.

As terrible as the =ystem is and has been to you, I have to tell you one encouraging thing. =A0 
Last Friday I spoke on a panel in DC on the justice system. I was=seated next to Justice Breyer and got to know him a bit. 
For what it=is worth, he certainly seem to understand that the system is broken and I =ear this more and more. Indeed, 
he made it very clear that he thinks=the sentencing system (which he helped form as a member of the Sentencing 
=ommission) is broken and while you are past having to deal with that, I wo=Id like to think this raises some hope that 
the rest of the system will im=rove if others in his position feel the same. 
Tomorrow I go to Alabama to argue before the court of appeals regardin= the constitutionality 
of Alabama's Community Notification Act, which =he lower court struck down as unconstitutional already. Ultra right 
=ing court and election year, so who knows; but these laws are so Draconian= 
I saw that the U.S. Attorney's office is appearing in your civil c=ses as well. Some strange folks in 
that office. Anyway, I will=look forward to talking and while all the judges are going to be tough, Ju=ges Marra and 
Johnson so far have not been rubber stamps for government in=my case and that means something.
