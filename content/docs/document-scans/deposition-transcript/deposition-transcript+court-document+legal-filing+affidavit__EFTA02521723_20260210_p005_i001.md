curtail our fears. If =he Obama narrative is swallowed- that the only threat is the Violent Jihad= we will miss the other 
contamination fomenting within our borde=s. We must appreciate how these levels work together and even unite w=th 
other forces such as the global Leftist movement that you, Jamie, have =escribed so forcefully in United in Hate 
<http://www.amazon.com/United-=ate-Romance-Tyranny-
Terror/dp/1935071602/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=U=F8&qid=1357362028&sr=1-1&keywords=united+in+hate> . 
FP: You write about how we like to talk of "Good Muslims=E244 and how we are always on the eternal search 
for "moderate=E2404$0 Muslims (Khatami, Mousavi, Abbas, etc), while we stress how =he "extremists" are the real 
problem and how "f ew" they really are. All of this is connected to the Control F actor. Enlighten us. 
Siegel: The Control Factor =eeks to have us feel in control of the situation. The easiest way to do th=s is to simply 
minimize the number of potential enemies. We have been lect=red for years about how Islam is a "religion of peace" 
and=that the violence we see (remember that we have already improperly limited=the problem to violence) is the 
product of a small number of "craz=es" (remember Hillary Clinton's 50,000) who have distorted=lslam. I call this the 
"Peaceful Muslim Disclaimer" as vir=ually everyone in the press and government has been bullied into making so=e 
statement of the kind to silence those who will pressure them that they =re "Islamophobic" and Islam is being attacked. 
(These are =he Islam hustlers who operate on the same principles that black race hustl=rs so effectively used to extort 
concessions over the last six decades or =o). 
Nobody has done any real work to support this proposition, nor is it cle=r exactly how it would be tested. My 
view is that the grammar 40=9CIslam is x" is itself problematic because Islam has express=d itself throughout history in a 
variety of fashions. It is more usef=l to talk in terms of how seriously engaged with Islam, the Koran and othe= texts, a 
Muslim is. What is significant is how Muslims today are using Is=am and most of those who are in power either 
throughout a large territory =r within a small community tend toward, if not fully advocate, the ve=y supremacist ideas 
that we try to tell ourselves are reserved for the few=C2410"extremists." Presumably most Germans did not w=sh to see 
all Nazi atrocities carried out but in the end they fell in line=because they had to. Those our politicians and press call the 
"ext=emists" are in one sense more accurately the "good4r=80, Muslims who are following their Islamic beliefs 
dutifully. 
FP:<=p> 
Siegel: One of the dirty little secrets the Control Facto= preys upon is that if we believe we control something we 
can co=fort ourselves that we can change it. Remember the horror film- the threat=has one purpose and that is to 
destroy you. You can not change it, talk it=out of it, teach it alternatives or otherwise. That is what makes it so in=erently 
frightening. If we can convince ourselves that we caused the threa= to act the way it does we can maintain the secret 
hope that we can change=it. Consequently, there is a tremendous attraction to blaming ourselves fo= the Islamic 
Enemy's behavior. And we see this power in our r=adily accepting responsibility for terror- because of our occupation, 
our =reedy quest for oil, our failure to extend a hand of "engagement ,=E244, Israel's building settlements, our making 
videos that def= me Mohammed and so on. Again, the relationship is defined by the enemy bla=ing us for his actions 
and our accepting such responsibility. 
Shelby Steele has written brilliantly about what he calls "=hite guilt" and outlines how whites during the 60's and 
th=reafter were pressured into a transaction whereby in order to re-obtain a =ense of moral authority they accepted 
blame for the condition of blacks40=A0and behaved as if guilty. Blacks were able to extract great concess=ons and 
whites were able to view themselves as morally restored and redeem=d. At a certain point, however, the behavior takes 
on a life of its own an= the narratives become deeply embedded in the culture and, as we can see t=day, difficult to 
uproot. 
Western guilt is an extension of Steele's notion. President Obam='s confessionals to the Arab world admitting 
that America has made="mistakes" and was not born a colonial pow er express this same tendency to appease through 
guilt. Hillary Clint on's "reset" with Russia conveyed the same submissi=e request for a more acceptable response. In 
being guilty we presume the o=her party will recognize our contrition and respond in like kind. One of t=e Control
