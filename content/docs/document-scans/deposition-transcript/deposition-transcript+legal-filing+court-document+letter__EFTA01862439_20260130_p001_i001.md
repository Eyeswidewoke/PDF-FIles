Well I have taken your feedback in the spirit in which it was intended (I think?) and hired auditors (KPMG) 
and a documentarian from BRAG Bangladesh to do a comprehensive financial and operational summary of 
the IRRC projects. You are right that having incomplete information is unprofessional, even if no one else 
cares about the work! I am allowing the mayors and local partners to continue to use their city and country 
specific data but I think (they don't quite agree yet but they will!) that also having the larger and more 
complete view of the project will help their case. You are the only person I have discussed big picture 
numbers with, everyone else also gets the country specific numbers, so hopefully no reputational risk or 
damage to the foundation. 
On Senegal, gosh the more I look internally the more I find a ton of stuff going on. Not sure what to do? I 
was thinking that what might be helpful would be to prepare a really concise summary for the president just 
so he knows what's going on. Some of the projects are proposing/requiring matched public funds and 
almost all are working with/within public institutions. The health stuff, you are right, feels a little preachy. 
Since all strategies and investments are reviewed and recalibrated annually by the co-chairs (Bill Bill Sr and 
Melinda) there isn't a ton of flexibility - so I guess everyone here is to blame. Anyway, even if he doesn't want 
to meet me for some baobab juice, he might just want to know what is ongoing or planned in his country. 
I've gotten my relatively narrow urban strategy guidelines from the co-chairs but I think/hope I can do some 
creative or at least demand-driven things within the constraints. Maybe you can help sort through some of 
them. One of the areas where they would like to expand is *research on urbanization- which may be a big 
waste of money. Anyway...I am not sure if you are familiar with Duflo/Banerjee RCT people from MIT. They 
have done a very cool study showing that one cool way to support poverty alleviation and also deal with 
urbanization is by offering microinsurance for seasonal migrants...so they migrate to city seasonally, make 
money and come home. Microinsurance seems to mitigate their risks. Study only done on subcontinent but 
seems to be valid. I liked it at least theoretically and makes common sense. 
Another non-urban area that I am considering is a new way to do immunization campaigns in terrible places 
like Chad where there is no got Bill is getting totally ripped off (hundreds of millionsof $$ by WHO and 
others). Some neat ideas to try, tehcnology related and maybe you'd be in the mood to hear them. Anyway I 
think I am on the hook to present them right around when you are in town! 
Miss you! Hope you are ok wherever you are!
