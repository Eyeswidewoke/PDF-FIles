Iran, for its part,-has encouraged Shiite Muslim militia groups so extreme and violent, and of=en intent on targeting 
Sunni Muslims, that many Sunnis are willing to endu=e ISIS if it provides the protection their own government won't. 
The mess puts Mr. 0=ama in a box. A few weeks ago he laid out in a policy speech his rationale=for staying out of the 
mire of such sectarian conflicts, since they seem f=r removed from concrete U.S. interests. Yet, he now seems to 
acknowledge the U.S. must do something. 
The danger for the =resident is the U.S. are being drawn back into the fray, but with very few=options, never mind good 
ones.

Syria: Humani=arian Disaster—and Security Threat 
Elliott Abrams <http://www.cfr.org/experts/middle-east-is=ael-human-rights/elliott-abrams/b1567> 
June 13, 2014 -- Th= facts about the humani=arian situation in Syria ar= well-known: A minimum of 160,000 people have 
been killed=/span>. About 6.5 million Syrians =ave been forced to leave their homes and are displaced inside Syria, and 
2=7 million are refugees in neighboring countries—altogether, nearly half of Syria's population of 22 million. T=e refugee 
burden on neighbors is immense: There are a million Syrian refug=es in Lebanon, whose population is only a bit over 4 
million, and 600,000 =egistered in Jordan, with a population of just over 6 million. These official refugee figures may be 
far lower th=n the real numbers (there are probably over a million refugees in Jordan),=and do not begin to express the 
misery in which so many Syrians now live.<=span> 
The refugee flows a=d the jihadi presence, which are both growing, constitute a threat to Syri=, its neighbors, and the 
interests of the United States. Today, foreign fi=hters from around the globe are said to number anywhere from 8,000—
t=e estimate given by Gen. Lloyd Austin, U.S. Central Commander—to 12,000,=and several of the groups are linked to al-
Qaeda. The Secretary of Homeland Security, Jeh Johnson, said in April 2014 that &=uot;Syria has become a matt=r of 
homeland security,&quo=; and the Director of National Intelligence, James Clappe=, said in January 2014 that=one of 
the al-Qaeda-aligned Syrian jihadi groups "does have aspiratio=s for attacks on the homeland."Among the foreign jihadis 
now fighting in Syria there are believed to be seventy Americans=/span>. 
The U.S. Reaction <=span> 
The U.S. government=s reaction has been almost entirely humanitarian, through aid to neighbori=g countries and to 
various UN and private agencies. Soon the total will re=ch 52 billion. 
President Obama has=been extremely reluctant to lift U.S. involvement from the humanitarian an= diplomatic to the 
military. His 2012 d=cision against military aid=to the Syrian rebels was made against the advice of his top national 
secur=ty officials at that time, including Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, CIA Director David Petraeus, Joint Chi=fs 
Chairman Martin Dempsey, and Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta. His las=-minute decision in August 2013 not to strike 
Syria after its use of chemi=al weapons was popular in the Pentagon and with the public, but clearly went against advice 
from Secretary of Sta=e John Kerry.
