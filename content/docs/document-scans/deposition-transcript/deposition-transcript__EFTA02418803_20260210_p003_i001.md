He met at least nine of the fifteen women in or around nightclubs: Kalika Moquin was a marketing 
manager at the Bank in Las Vegas, which is also where he met onetime cocktail waitress and full-
time clubgoer Jamie Jungers. He met Julie Postle when she was a cocktail waitress in Orlando. 
Cod Rist at a nightclub in Manhattan. Holly Sampson met him through a mutual friend who is 
also a club promoter. These are not cases of eyes locking across a crowded dance floor. That's 
not the way someone like Tiger Woods goes out. Instead, special introductions are made. Girls 
are brought into his orbit by nightclub managers and directors of marketing and promoters and 
waitresses and owners. They are selected and then delivered. 
The most famous of Woods's alleged mistresses is Rachel Uchitel, who occupies a position of power in 
this strobe network of girls and money and celebrity. As VIP concierge and director of VIP 
hospitality at Tao in Vegas and at Dune in Southampton and at the Griffin, Marquee, Stanton 
Social, and Pink Elephant in Manhattan, she was the ambassador of client desire. 
Her job was born out of the culture of bottle service. The concept of paying for a whole bottle of alcohol 
and sitting at a table originated in Europe and grew a tail in the States in the early nineties, at 
New York clubs Life and Chaos. But it didn't stick until 2001, when bottle service became the 
new way of gaining entry into a world that had previously not been for sale. You no longer had 
to be an Andy Warhol descendant to party at a place like Bungalow 8; you could be Joe Banker 
or Joe Banker's son with his father's credit card. And the staffers changed, too. Cocktail 
waitresses evolved from out-of-work actresses into Penthouse Petlevel creatures who sparred 
with their co-workers for client gratuities by expanding their breadth of service. Their take-
home pay skyrocketed from $300 a night to $3,000 banner shifts. With the volume of VIP clients 
growing and the number of tables quadrupling, the need for organization spawned the creation 
of the VIP host, someone who could be trusted with the biggest clients. 
In Las Vegas, at the Bank, Woods's club of choice, a host would meet him at the door and walk him to his 
table on the second or third floor. From his perch high above the dance floor and flanked by 
superstar friends like Michael Jordan, Woods could look over the balcony and say, Oh, that 
table of pretty girls there, bring them up. The nightclub has become a smorgasbord. All you 
have to do is point and ask. 
Next: Rachel, how does it feel to be a home-wrecker?

This world was splayed open when Woods crashed his SUV last Thanksgiving weekend. And it does not 
close because Tiger Woods has (for now) left it, returning to public life this week to play in the 
Masters, a chastened man. There are still rich VIPs in the premium corners of clubs from New 
York to Miami to Las Vegas, being introduced to girls who are not Woods's girls but who are 
exactly like most of Woods's girls. In most cases, there is an exchange, gifts or help for 
sexthough with celebrities, what the girls receive is often just the privilege of being with a 
storied name. The Woods scandal has upset the rhythm of this world, upping the stakes and 
rattling the locals. But you can't keep wealthy men and pretty girls apart for long. 
Rachel Uchitel is long and skinny and buoyantly breasted. Her lips are a fat heart. On television and on 
the Internet, she is the aviatored one moving serenely through airports as camera-headed men 
coo, Rachel, how does it feel to be a home-wrecker? Rachel?
