Re: 2012--PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL 
Barry-i don't think we need to give APO our 74 (or, certainly not the full 2nd notice). All we need is, for example, josh h's 
number and know his and leon's relative ownership % of brh in 2012 and the math is simple. 
I really think the obvious next step is for jeffrey and tom to speak and for tom to reach out to the irs again. If that 
doesn't work, as you say, I think the tax guys--and jeffrey in partic--shld architect the nature of the response. I'll get the 
answer tomorrow from EY on jee's question on the potentially prejudicial nature of acknowledging a mistake.

Here are my observations: 
1. 
The first IRS letter references a "review" of BRH, but doesn't suggest that there will be changes to the BRH K-1 
items. In fact, it implies the opposite. The letter points to the K-1 it thinks we should have used (not reflecting any 
changes from the original). It asks what K-1 LDB used because it can't find the BRH K-1 or its exact numbers on LDB's 
return. 
2. 
The second IRS letter almost suggests the opposite. It is in effect saying that the original K-1 is wrong. P. 9 of 
the pdf indicates an adjustment of $884,006, referencing 98-054199, which is BRH's TIN; not to mention the p. 10 
footnote which mentions BRH. 
3. 
I'm not sure how the IRS traces this number to the LDB return, as the BRH K-1 was issued to BFP, and was not 
attached to LDB's return. LDB's 2012 return references a few items from BRH "via Black Family Partners," so maybe the 
IRS assumes that LDB pays taxes attributable to BRH. 
4. 
The IRS seems to be pointing out 2 different problems in its respective letters: (a) How does BRH 
income/loss/expense flow to LDB's return, and (b) The original BRH numbers were wrong, and have been changed by 
the IRS. In other words, the first letter implicitly asks us to trace specifically mentioned BRH K-1 numbers to LDB's 
return, which the second letter is saying are wrong and have been changed. 
I want to say that the second letter obviates the need to respond to the first, because the second letter is says the first 
letter's numbers are wrong. However, the letters are simply inconsistent. It would have been very easy for the IRS to 
withdraw the initial request or issue a clarification, but it did not do that. Assuming the agent continues to refuse to 
return our calls, I defer to the tax experts re whether "under-responding" to the first letter creates undue risk of a 9-
figure assessment vs. having them come back to us to request more info.
