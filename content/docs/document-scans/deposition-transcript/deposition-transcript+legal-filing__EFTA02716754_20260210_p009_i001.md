would overwhelm the existing brick and mortar companies. And some did, but most didn't and although Amazon is

great product/service, but it is difficult fo= me to believe that Uber is really worth $40 billion but then if Amazon is really 
worth $157.5 =illion today, anything is possible 
Flooding, dangerous heatwaves, ill health and violent conflicts among=likely risks if the world keeps burning fossil fuels

Whatever deniers are saying Climate Cha=ge is happening, it's almost entirely man's fault and lim=ting its impacts may 
require reducing greenhouse gas emissions to zero thi= century, the U.N.'s panel on climate science said this month. 
T=e fourth and final volume of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climat= Change's giant climate assessment offered no 
surprises, nor =as it expected to since it combined the findings of three reports released=in the past 13 months. But it 
underlined the scope of the climate ch=llenge in stark terms. Emissions, mainly from the burning of fossil fuels,=may 
need to drop to zero by the end of this century for the world to have = decent chance of keeping the temperature rise 
below a level that many con=ider dangerous. 
The IPCC didn't say exactly what=such a world would look like but it would likely require a massive shift t= renewable 
sources to power homes, cars and industries combined with new t=chnologies to suck greenhouse gases from the 
atmosphere. The report =arned that failure to reduce emissions could lock the world on a trajector= with "irreversible" 
impacts on people and the environment. Some=impacts already being observed included rising sea levels, a warmer and 
mo=e acidic ocean, melting glaciers and Arctic sea ice and more frequent and =ntense heat waves. "Science has spoken. 
There is no amb=guity in their message. Leaders must act. Time is not on our side,"=C2QU.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-
moon said at the report's launc= in Copenhagen. 
Amid its grim projections, the repor= said the tools are there to set the world on a low-emissions path and bre=k the 
addiction to burning oil, coal and gas which pollute the atmosphere =ith heat-trapping CO2, the chief greenhouse gas. 
"All w= need is the will to change, which we trust will be motivated by knowledge=and an understanding of the science 
of climate change," IPCC=chairman Rajendra Pachauri said. The IPCC was set up in 1988 to asse=s global warming and 
its impacts. The report released Sunday caps its late=t assessment, a mega-review of 30,000 climate change studies that 
establis=es with 95-percent certainty that most of the warming seen since the 1950s=is man-made. The IPCC's best 
estimate is that just about all of it is =an-made, but it can't say that with the same degree of certainty..=A0 And only a 
small minority of scientists challenge the mainstream conclu=ion that climate change is linked to human activity.
