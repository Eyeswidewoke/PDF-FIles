I make about 225K per year these days. Foundation, doctoring and publications. I should be making 
500 to 600K like my colleagues with similar skills but I m happy at the public hospital since I feel like 
the poorest should get the best even if they can't pay. Id work for free for them if I could. 
My needs were a little weird this year be of cancer stuff but I do support my dad (dying of squamous cell 
neck cancer...I did one of his surgeries) and I think he may live at most 5 years more given his 
staging. I provide all medical costs and care needs. That's about 75K per year. His wife works and 
pays for basics, housing etc. I also help my sister and her husband recently as they got hit pretty hard 
and are both looking for work. My sister got laid off as teacher, bummer. They work (currently) in 
commission paying jobs only (which are boom or bust) so I pay kids school and food/essentials when 
needed. Last year it was about 25K, this year closer to 35K. I also pay for my car, clothes, health etc. 
I support 2 orphanages in Zimbabwe at about 10K or 15K per year and spend another 15K to support 
the tiny project I started in 2007 (phvsicianeducation.orq). It provides basic tools like learning heart 
sounds or how to do basic resuscitation for dots in developing countries. I spend 10K per year 
supporting medical student associations in Nepal, China, Uganda and Tanzania. 
Steve pays for house (we bought jointly and have no mortgage) related expenses, mostly technology 
stuff so he can work from home. Our house is like Norad. He does support me if I ask for something 
but of course he's supporting his elderly mom and sister and since I am employed (and have some 
basic skills) I feel like I shouldn't be someone's dependent. I try to save everything else. I have 250K 
in my 401k and 150K in savings. I own half of two properties with steve. Lease my car (short 
attention span). I like watches so every few years I buy one. 
Does that help?
