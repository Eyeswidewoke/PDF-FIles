number. Thus, Swanson's equity could range anywhere from 0 (if it doesn't sell before November) to say 
$14,000,000. See discussion below. 
205 Via Tortuga (Lot 17. Phipps Estates) (He lives in a house this land). He has a mortgage linked to a 56 
million credit line extended by Northern Trust secured by this property and an adjacent lot (207 Via Tortuga). 
This note has a variable interest rate and the `final due date' is October 2018. 205 Via Tortuga might be worth 
$5.000.000. 
207 Via Tortuga (Lot 18, Phipps Estates). This lot is adjacent to his house and covered by the same Northern 
Trust mortgage. It is about 20.000 sf and is ksted with McCann for $5,500,000 but is probably worth around 
$4,000,000. 
Swanson's equity in 205 + 207 Via Tortuga combined (assuming the $6 million Northern line is fully drawn) is in 
the $3,000,000 range. 
210 Miraflores is an older 2000 sf Bermuda house adjacent to his Phipps lots. He rents it out. He paid $350,000 
in 1995 and owes $700,000 on a 20 yr self-amortizing mortgage. He pledged it as additional security for the 
1220 second held by NPCM in January 2011. It is probably worth $1,300,000. 
Interest in 101 El Bravo This is the spec house listed at $47 million. Jim Patterson of Louisville is his partner. 
McCann (who has the listing) says that they have had offers up to $30 million but Patterson has turned them 
down. Jim is allowed to say a deal can be made in the upper $30s but it seems there is buyer "reluctance" 
above $30. There is a $25,000,000 mortgage on it through U.S. Bank N.A. which was put in place in February 
2011. If they could get $30M. Swanson's equity would presumably be $2,500,000 possibly less. (They paid 
$16.5M for the land in 2007.) 
This indicates Swanson's net worth from PB real estate is in the 56 million range + his equity in 1220 South 
Ocean which as discussed could be zero to $14M. 
This does not account for cash, securities, other business interests, any other real estate outside PB. and 
tangibles. I do not have any information about these. I do not know of other assets and I do not think he has a 
pending project. 
He does have a pending and very active lawsuit against him by Leo Vecellio (Ranger Construction) who bought 
589 N County. This is a very acrimonious suit. Vecellio is seeking several million in damages for construction 
defects and recently amended the suit to allege fraud by Dan, his wife, and his backer Dean DeSantis (son of 
Carl of Rexall-Sundown) and his wife. The fraud alleged is that Dan concealed water damage during 
construction due to hurricanes. This is well publicized and seems to be getting nastier and I assume very 
expensive to defend. 
Value of 1220 
Dan has reduced the ask from $84 million to $64 million. Evidently appraisals were made by TD and NPCM in 
January that were in the $40s. Dan has asked that the TD appraisal be revised because of Moens sale of 1255 
S Ocean (the ex Krakoff lot) to the south for $22.7+ to Petterfy. (Swanson paid $20.6 for the land at 1220.) He 
thinks/hopes 1220 will now appraise in the $505. 
The nearest competition is Sandra Hammond's house at 1275 SOB listed by Cris Condon of 
Sotheby's at $42.5. I do not think there have been offers. Swanson sold the house to Hammond from 
plans. It recorded as a $15M land sale but she is supposed to have paid more than $26M in total. 
Interestingly, Petterfy got interested in the land at 1255 while looking at 1275. 1275 has 13,300 sf on 
170 lakefront feet (270 depth) and is basically a smaller version of 1220 (27.350 sf on 200+ feet by 
450 feet depth). 
The sense of the PB brokers is that 1220 will bring a $40 number. 
There has been a lot of activity in PB this season in the 520-$30 range (sales and offers). But the fact is that so 
far the high sale this season will be 529.1 for 40 Blossom Way (190 feet on the ocean) which (Moens says) 
Moens and his partner (Bill Kallop) are buying and leasing to Petterfy for 5 years while he builds on 1255 which 
they owned and sold to him. 
Discussion 
Dan is shell-shocked. He doesn't think Kosoy will extend the second so he fears losing 1220 in November before 
next season provides an opportunity to sell it. I don't think he is likely to have many alternatives over the 
summer. 
Its obvious that one could structure a second with a high rate of interest and an interest reserve. I think Dan 
would agree. The combined first and second would at 530,200,000 represent 75% loan to expected sales 
value ratio -possibly a lower ratio if appraised value is used. 
Since 1220 is owned by a single asset LLC, there seem to be some obvious techniques to limit exposure to 
delays in possession on default or in the event of an LLC bankruptcy including taking a membership position in 
the LLC and amending the operating agreement to require consent to certain actions like bankruptcy, sale and
