As for retirees the 401k pl=ns have been a horror. First of all, because the risk has been shifted from companies to the 
employees who for the most part are ill-equip=to manage them, leaving it to Mutual Funds that mostly float with the 
tide.40=A0 But more importantly, is that the average 401k plan only has $18,000 and $85,000 at the time when most 
people retire. This is not nearly enough because one needs at least ten to twelve times their salary as we are now living 
longer. As a result economists say that 45% to 50% of Baby Boomers do not have enough sock away in their 401k plans 
along with Social Security to cover their basic economic needs when t=ey retire. This spells poverty and poverty on a 
mass scale. Think about it roughly half or the Baby Boomers might end up living in poverty. And this is =argely because 
of The Burden Shift. 
Pay For Performance is probably the most egregious practice in business as it is a totally a rigged game in favor of the 
management =E2.4, who often manipulate the numbers and dates to enrich themselves. And one of the=most 
egregious companies abusing this practice was Apple, who under Steve Jobs admitted to falsifyin= more than 4000 cases 
where they falsely changed dates and documents to enable se=ior executives to enrich themselves. In the old days one 
would have considered =his insider trading, as executives not only do things for short-term benefit, i= is a common 
practice to make decisions that gooses the stock price prior to compensation review. Case in point: the top five 
executives of =ear Stearns and Lehman Brothers received more than $2 billion is stock options and cash compensati=n in 
the last two years including settlements when their companies collapsed:40=AD There was no stockholder value yet ten 
executives received $2 billion in compensation. Think about it if this had happen in China these guys would have gone 
to jail and their ill-gotten gains confiscated. 
Yet as bad as the aforementioned ha= been to squeeze the Middle Class, they don't come close to rivaling the housing 
bubble =nd bust which did more to devastate the Middle Class than any other development in American as millions of 
Americans were enticed to tale equity out of their houses to maintain their living standards. There has been a massive 
transfer of wealth from the middle class to the elite of the past 30 years and the most striking element of that is the $6 
=rillion lost by the Middle Class during the housing bubble. Prior to the hous=ng bubble roughly 70% of the assets of the 
housing stock was owned by the homeowner and the other re=aining 30% owed by banks. By 2009 that figure had 
dropped to 40%. Homeowners lost 30% of the value of a $20 trillion housing markets. This was an enormous =rosion of 
Middle Class wealth. Championed by Allan Greenspan, this Equity Stripping pumped $750 billion yearly into the 
economy but it devasta=ed the Middle Class. 
The groundwork for these=things to happen began in the 95th Congress in 1978. Because in 1978 Congress passed a 
federal law that over-ruled all of the states usury laws,=enabling banks and other financial institutions to charge 15%, 
18% and more on peopl= who can least afford it and they know are bad risk. This led to adjus=able mortgages, 100% 
financing, negative amortization enabling borrows to go further into debt every month. And the latest Payday Loans...
