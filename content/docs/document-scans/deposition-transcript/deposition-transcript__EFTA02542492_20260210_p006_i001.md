documentation to confirm= The term "estate" references the totality of a decedent's assets so the balance of Carol's 
estate, i=e. the Marital Trusts, go to the children, but Noam's estate does =ot. 
VC: We hav= not been informed that Noam has been receiving ANY of the Trusts net inco=e nor principal 
distributions. 
That leaves us with the IRA. I did not realize this, but though =ainco was aware that the IRA was my only source 
of funds, and was of cours= diminishing, they continued to make distributions to ten family recipients. We were also 
paying almost $50,000 a year =or Wellfleet, and paying other expenses, like Alex's medical bills. =AO It seems that we 
were also paying taxes for the entire estate. DPQ: I think Noam is refe=ring to Carol's Marital Trusts here. Am I correct? 
=AO 
VC: No, Deborah. The money for all this has been com in= from distributions from the IRA (and most of it, if not 
ALL, from the one=Noam has designated me as the beneficiary). 
Just to give yo= an idea of the scale, there is an automatic $300,000 deduction a year fro= the IRA. DPQ: In =he 
interest of being accurate the Minimum Required Distribution changes so=ewhat each year depending on market 
fluctuations and Noam's age. This is not a deduction from the IRA, rather, this is the minimum distributi=n to Noam as 
required under our tax laws. This is perhaps just a semantic =oint. 
Distributions and taxes come close to the total 
deduction from the IRA, and other expens=s of the kind just mentioned (plus Anthony) carry expenses well beyond 
the=funds coming in. 
VC: Although a requirement under the tax laws,=the distributions (withdrawals) from the IRA were being used 
for donations=to family members and other expenses that we should not be responsibl= for, considering that the IRA is 
the only stable source of money lef= for Noam. 
<=pan style="color:black"> 
Plainly, we cannot continue any of this while living on a diminishing IRA.=C2 I did request that a marital trust 
pay the taxes on the IRA, but Har=y insisted on conditions that I could not possibly accept, and I was very =urprised, 
frankly, that any conditions were even considered. Perhaps that had to do with the serious miscon=eptions about our 
expenses, whatever their source. 
Naturally, I want make sure that when I die, Valeria will at least hav= a place to live and something to live on. 
DPQ: I might re-word this=as it is Noam's intent as expressed to me and Gene that Valeria re=eives the totality of 
Noam's estate, and not just an amount that wrIl give her subsistence. 
VC: Again, Deborah. This i= the main and extremely important point of my letter. I might be ent=tled to receive 
whatever will be left from one of the IRA, if something wirl be left, but not the "totality" of Noam's estate.</=> 
She came here, abandoning everything in Brazil, to be with me in my =ast years. We are very happy together, 
and care for each other. =AO It is a joy I never anticipated after Mommy died and after the years I =pent alone. 
That's the situation. It is entirely different from what you=heard. Again, I do not know what the source of your 
information is, ..rut it is completely inaccurate. 
I should add, perhaps, that in earlier years, I was indeed careless ab=ut expenses, leaving it to Mommy. Valeria 
has taken over, and for th= past three years, both of us have been monitoring expenses carefully and know exactly what 
is coming in and what =s being spent. We have all the facts very clearly laid out, and are =fanning accordingly. I am glad 
that the three of you will be well ta=en care of from the estate, the way it was planned years ago. DPQ: =s above the
