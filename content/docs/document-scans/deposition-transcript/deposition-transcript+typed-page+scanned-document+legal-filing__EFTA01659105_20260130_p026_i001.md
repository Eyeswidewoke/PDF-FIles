which were "that she implied the involvement of Republican elected officials in her...conspiracy 
theory," and "she was unable to give Fox News adequate cover to present her claims 
uncritically." In a profile of Powell, the New York Times (11/23, Peters, Feuer, 18.61M) states 
that she "has said she plans to file a suit in Georgia but hasn't yet," and "it is unclear whether 
that work will continue now that the Trump campaign has cut her loose." 
In his Washington Post (11/23, 14.2M) column, Dana Milbank asserts Trump "is losing so 
much we are sick and tired of his losing." According to Milbank, "There's no realistic possibility 
his attempt to overturn the election succeeds, but the clown coup still does damage by 
preventing the incoming Biden administration from getting up to speed on potential national 
security crises and vaccine distribution. And last-minute sabotage - another government 
shutdown, or vetoing a defense bill over Trump's insistence on keeping the names of bases 
named for Confederates - can't be ruled out." Milbank concludes Trump "came in promising so 
much winning, but he's leaving with so much whining." 
Research Finds Small Numbers Of Right-Wing Personalities Behind Spread Of 
Election Misinformation. The New York Times (11/23, Frenkel, 18.61M) reports new 
research from Avaaz, a global human rights group, the Elections Integrity Partnership, and the 
Times "shows how a small group of people - mostly right-wing personalities with outsized 
influence on social media - helped spread the false voter-fraud narrative that led to those 
rallies. That group, like the guests of a large wedding held during the pandemic, were 
'superspreaders' of misinformation around voter fraud, seeding falsehoods that include the 
claims that dead people voted, voting machines had technical glitches, and mail-in ballots were 
not correctly counted." 
In another report on "viral misinformation," the New York Times (11/23, Frenkel, 18.61M) 
says Biden "did not have a maskless birthday party last week," despite posts to the contrary 
that attempt to portray his celebration in 2019 as taking place this weekend. Meanwhile, The 
Hill (11/23, Mastrangelo, 2.98M) reports, "Several prominent right-wing activists and 
conservative pundits have been pushing the false claim that Joe Biden invented the 'office' of 
the president-elect or that he is the first incoming president ever to use the title." The Hill adds 
that while "there is no government office for the president-elect, the term has for decades been 
used by the media, politicians and the general public to describe the winner of a presidential 
election before they take office." 
Hill-HarrisX Poll: 47% Of Voters Want Trump To Run In 2024. The Hill (11/23, 
Schulte, 2.98M) reports a new Hill-HarrisX poll of 1,873 "registered voters" (11/17-11/19) 
found 47% overall "said they support the idea of another presidential run by Trump in four 
years," including 75% of Republicans and 24% of Democrats, but 53% overall "oppose the 
notion," including 25% of Republicans and 76% of Democrats. 
In an analysis examining what Trump "liked" about the presidency, the New York Times 
(11/23, Flegenheimer, Haberman, 18.61M) says he "preferred the parts of the job that 
combined pomp, splendor and a world amenable to his decisions. In other words, he always 
seemed to genuinely enjoy pardoning turkeys." 
White House To Hold Indoor Holiday Reception. 
Reuters (11/23, Heavey, Shalal, Lambert, Mason) reports, "The White House plans to hold an 
indoor holiday reception next week just days after Thanksgiving despite ongoing COVID-19 
outbreaks at the compound, and against the advice of its own advisers who are urging 
Americans to sacrifice their normal holiday gatherings to curb the spread of the virus." The 
planned event "follows a series of White House events in recent months that have been linked 
to a rash of outbreaks." 
On ABC's Good Morning AmericaVI (11/23, 3.1M), Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams 
was asked, "the White House is planning to hold holiday parties indoors. What kind of message 
is this sending?" Surgeon General Adams said, "I want the American people to know we're at a 
dire point in our fight with this virus by any measure," but, he added, "We're going to have
