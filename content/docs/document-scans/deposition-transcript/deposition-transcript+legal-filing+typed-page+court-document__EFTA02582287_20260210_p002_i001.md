that time, I renegotiated my deal w/ OEP and included the clause that we would participate in everything they did. Rick 
Smith, whom I dealt with clearly stated we would be in every deal, sourcing it or not, and the contract reflects that. Over 
time, to make sure the guys in NY knew what we were up to, I flew up there every quarter and presented what we 
sourced and what deals we were working on, boards and added value, including for their portfolio's that were not based 
in Brazil but wanted to do business here. But the reality is that the OEP guys in Brazil were jealous and wanted to show 
they could live w/o us, or, needed to justify their presence. Some things made this worse, for example, when jamie 
dimon came to brazil, for the small exclusive reception, the JPM CEO invited only me and not them ( because they were 
junior, and because I helped the bank bring in a dozen of new private banking clients every year as he said), or, the 
portfolio companies and partners of One Equity elsewhere, when coming to Brazil, asked me for help, and not them, as 
the two could not get them into the owners of the companies/clients or decision makers that would generate real 
business. So thats how things got worse. 
3. The fee for the deal in question is Unicoba, an industrial battery-component and led company. I did not like 
the deal, but worked on it and it closed in late september of 2013. Pacific did not co-invest, it was our option not to and 
we elected that our fee be paid in cash. Key reason was that they sell to government and I have in my contract that I do 
not deal w/ government. When we sent the invoice, they asked us for additional info (what exactly we did for the deal) 
which they had never asked for previously. On top, they said this was due to new JPM requirements. Then, after we sent 
the info, Rick Smith, senior guy, said he would speak w/ me personally in his next trip to Brazil, which happened in early 
December. In August of last year Rick said OEP would cut all of their outside advisors and consultants, except for Pacific. 
In December he said they would no longer renew our agreement at current terms and that he was told by the Brazil OEP 
guys that the fee for the Unicoba deal was not merited because we did not do the work as expected. They never, ever, 
sent any email or complained about our work or quality during the process. On the contrary, we have a ton of praising 
emails over time and thank you emails to the team on this deal. But the Brazil guys, in December, cut us off from the 
MMM (weekly partners' meeting), took our names out of the investment memo sent to the Investment Committee, and 
started selectively cutting us off everything we were working on. In December they gave us a new version of the 
agreement that they wanted to sign w/ us which basically pays a zero fixed fee and only a variable 2% fee. I did not want 
to renew anyway, but did not say anything as we wanted to get paid on the deals that were still active in our pipeline, 
under the terms of the expiring agreement which had a tail. So I said "lets solve the open issues and then we work on 
discussing the new agreement" (which BTW, cancels off all the rights we have on the expiring contract). 
4. After December, I met w/ Rick Smith again in January 2014 in Brazil and had a very honest conversation about 
the entire situation. He asked me to send evidence which I did in February (the ppt you have). But when I met Dick 
Cashin in feb, he said he was not the person to discuss this, and threw the decision back to Rick. However, Dick Cashin 
stated that we made "too much money" over the years and that this needed to end as things changed in JPM. In early 
March 2014 I asked Rick if he had reviewed the evidence, and to date he said he has not had time. I am supposed to 
follow up this Friday. Other people internally aware of this are their internal legal counsel, Judah Shechter, Kathy Bryan, 
the CFO (an ex-JPM) and Fritz Hobbs, a close friend to Cashin who is on our side and knows how bad the Brazil OEP'ers 
behaved. 
5. My plan is to (i) drop out of the 3 boards I sit in at the Brazil portfolio companies they/I invested in; (ii) Get 
paid the fee for Cless deal (hair products) 
that was signed in February 2014 and has a closing next week (they said they would pay), and (iii) right after get 
a lawyer to press them to pay for Unicoba. While they offered to pay 2 more months of retainer (260k) as a "recognition 
of good work" but in fact to be a cut of the 1M due, I did not accept as I said we did do work and they need to fulfill the 
agreement. 
6. OEP's situation is pretty critical - they were for sale until now. I know that the JPM top exec supervising them -
Matt Zames - has been very much on top of their business, costs, selling, pulling back etc and making their life difficult.
