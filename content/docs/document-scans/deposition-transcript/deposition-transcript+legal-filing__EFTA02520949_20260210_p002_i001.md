My gosh, I am s000 sorry that I was=not explicit in showing my appreciation. I am deeply appreciative 
from the=moment of referral to you checking in on things to the side dialogs you L=;ve had. I'm terribly sorry I did not 
express that in a way that ma=e it clear. 
Thank you. 
I'm more th=n happy to turn this over to you. Any fee you want is fine. That isn.#393 an issue for me 
at all. Or if you don't want to be involved that=is fine too. I would rather be friends more than anything. 
I'd like you to be involved. I just want you to =nderstand a little more about the situation. It is more 
nuanced than a =oney negotiation i think. 
We've both done =ots of contracts and have both been more involved with lawyers tons more t=an we 
would have liked. But in very different ways and with different b=siness situations. Together we bring almost too much 
experience. :) 
For me, the currency in this negotiation isn't mone=. Steve doesn't care about the money because he 
knows I am not moti=ated by the money. The most important thing for Steve is foreclosing op=ions for me. That is why 
he did the negative stuff about me. The sec=nd most important thing is just feeling like he won. That means he gets=to 
brag about something. Me being a vc is a victory for him. Me being a=startup CEO is a victory. Samsung is a clean loss. 
I have been part of a dozen lawsuits filed after Micros=ft people went to competitors. It is nasty, public, 
and ultimately Micr=soft prevailed in all of them. Either the person backed down or ended up s= tarnished they were 
ineffective. The suits are filed regardless of the=work--"inevitable leakage of trade secrets". 
PR is part of foreclosing options. People do remembe= pr. Read about "Kai Fu Lee". He was branded 
ineffective a=d then left google as ineffective. He was a traitor then and is now a t=aitor to China. Maybe he is all of 
those in reality, but he was also a =eading Carnegie Melon computer scientist. 
This goes back to the 80's and is always done. S=nior people leave and there is a lawsuit if they go to a 
competitor. Alway=. 
If I choose to be a manager of people, espe=ially a large group, then that group will know about me 
almost exclusively=through what they read about me. I don't get a chance to charm them= And because of the lag time 
from start to releasing a new product it m=ans i have to change an organization and manage it with a cloud of doubt o= 
worse. Getting the most out of a team becomes impossible. That'= the failure cycle. It is real. 
Managing a large team when they get all of their inform=tion about their manager from the web or 
launching a product when the pres= thinks they know you is all impossibly hard with bad "personal pr&qu=t;. 
The "sightings" are real. Just like the co=ference I signed up for this is what impacts negotiation. I do 
believe =n sharing that with counsel which might be different between us. Both w=ys can work (or not). 
But the truth is people went straight to Steve and Stev= went straight to brad. Just like how steve fired 
off panic mail after i s=gned up to speak at the conference.
