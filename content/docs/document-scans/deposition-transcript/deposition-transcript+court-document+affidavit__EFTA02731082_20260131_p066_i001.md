PRIVILEGED - ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT/DELIBERATIVE PROCESS 
CONFIDENTIAL - SUBJECT TO FED. R. CRIM. P. 6(e) 
belonged to Wexner, but the Wexners had moved out of it in 1995. Epstein also sold himself a 
private plane that previously belonged to Wexner at a deeply discounted price. 
In the 1990s, Epstein told Wexner that he had other clients and that Wexner did not need 
to pay Epstein because Epstein was having fun and they would settle up later. Epstein 
introduced Wexner to a number of other people as his clients, and Wexner interacted with other 
prominent people who knew Epstein, such as Prince Andrew, professors at Harvard, and a sultan 
in Dubai. Epstein had no formal role in L Brands or Victoria's Secret. At some point, Wexner 
heard a rumor that Epstein might be holding himself out as connected to Victoria's Secret, but 
when Wexner asked Epstein about it, Epstein denied doing so. 
Epstein handled Wexner's personal business affairs until 2007, when Wexner learned that 
Epstein had stolen or otherwise misappropriated several hundred million dollars from Wexner. 
Around that time, Epstein told Wexner that he was having legal problems involving an overly 
aggressive police chief and some sort of massage. Epstein said he was being blackmailed and it 
could get messy, so it would be best for Wexner's wife to take over the family finances. In 
response, Wexner's wife looked into the state of their finances and discovered that Epstein had 
misappropriated a significant amount of the family's funds. For example, Epstein frequently 
bought property on behalf of the Wexners and then sold it to himself for a fraction of the cost. 
The Wexners then decided to cut off Epstein. When confronted, Epstein tried to convince 
Wexner's wife that she did not understand the financials and insisted that he had the Wexners' 
best interests at heart. The Wexners did not want to bring unnecessary public attention to the 
issue, so they withdrew the power of attorney, and hired counsel to negotiate a private settlement 
with Epstein. As a result of those negotiations, Epstein agreed to return $100 million to the 
Wexners, which he did in January of 2008. At that point, Wexner severed all ties with Epstein, 
and he has not seen or spoken to Epstein since. 
Wexner knows nothing about the 
claim from 
and explained that at the 
time, Epstein owned a property adjacent to the Wexners about a half mile way from the 
Wexners's property. The Wexners's security team is not aware of any inappropriate incident 
taking place on the Wexners's property, and the Wexners first heard about 
allegations from public reporting this year. 
2. Search Warrants 
In July and August 2019, we obtained and the FBI executed search warrants for Epstein's 
residences in New York and the Virgin Islands. We subsequently obtained warrants to search all 
electronic devices, drives, and discs seized from those residences. The FBI is continuing to 
review the extraordinarily large amount of data contained on those devices and is working with 
our filter team to complete a privilege review of that data. In addition, we have reviewed the 
materials obtained during the Palm Beach Police Department's October 2005 search of Epstein's 
Palm Beach residence.
