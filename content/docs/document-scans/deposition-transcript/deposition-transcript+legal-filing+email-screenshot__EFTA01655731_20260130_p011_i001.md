as a federal officer. They argue the Special Counsel role requires a presidential appointment and senatorial 
confirmation, which Smith did not receive, thus challenging the legality of his actions in the ongoing investigation. 
A Quarter of Americans Believe FBI Instigated Jan. 6, Post-UMD Poll Finds 
The Washington Post (01/04, Jackman, Clement, et al.) and Business insider (01/04, Griffiths) reported that a 
Washington Post-University of Maryland poll found that 25% of Americans, including more than three in ten 
Republicans, believe the false claim that the FBI instigated the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. According to the article, despite 
over 725 federal prosecutions of Jan. 6 participants and no evidence of FBI involvement, this conspiracy theory 
persists, particularly among those who cite right-wing media sources. The article explained that Director Wray has 
categorically denied these allegations. "This notion that somehow the violence at the Capitol on January 6 was part 
of some operation orchestrated by FBI sources and agents is ludicrous," Director Wray said during a House hearing 
in July, "and is a disservice to our brave, hard-working, dedicated men and women." The poll highlighted the 
widespread misinformation about the Capitol riot, with 39% of Fox News viewers and 44% of Trump voters 
believing in FBI instigation, compared to lower percentages among viewers of other news networks. The results 
come amid ongoing legal proceedings against Jan. 6 defendants, and as President Biden addresses Jan. 6 
revisionism, emphasizing the fragility of democracy. 
What to Know About Trump's Immunity Claim in the 2020 Election Case 
Axios (01/04, Knutson) reported that lawyers for former President Trump have claimed he should receive "absolute 
immunity" from charges related to his alleged plot to overturn the 2020 election, citing the 1982 Nixon v. Fitzgerald 
case. This case, which granted presidents immunity from civil damages but not criminal charges, is being used to 
argue that Trump's actions, including those around the Jan. 6 riot, fall within his official capacity, thus barring 
criminal charges. The article explained that constitutional lawyers and former government officials have labeled 
this argument as "absurd," stating it could undermine the rule of law. The article added that Special Counsel Jack 
Smith, leading the federal election interference case, has challenged this defense, suggesting it could allow a 
president to commit egregious acts without fear of prosecution. 
The Trump Campaign Embraces Jan. 6 Rioters With Money and Pardon Promises 
NPR (01/04, Dreisbach, Caldwell) reported that three years after the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, former President Donald 
Trump's campaign is supporting the rioters with promises of pardons and financial aid, challenging the extensive 
investigation led by the FBI under Director Wray. According to the article, Trump's stance, including potential 
pardons for those arrested, has been welcomed by the rioters and their families but has raised concerns among law 
enforcement and extremism experts. The article noted that Metropolitan Police Department officer Daniel Hodges, 
assaulted during the riot, fears that such pardons could embolden criminal behavior and further validate the 
violence of Jan. 6. 
Feds Boost Reward to $500K for Information on Capitol Pipe Bomber 
NBC News (01/04, Reilly) reported that the FBI has increased the reward to $500,000 for information leading to the 
arrest of the person responsible for placing two pipe bombs near the Capitol on Jan. 5, 2021, the day before the 
Capitol riot. According to the article, despite extensive efforts, including 1,000 interviews, reviewing over 39,000 
video files, and assessing nearly 500 tips, the identity of the individual remains unknown. The article explained that 
the FBI, in collaboration with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and Washington police, 
continues to work relentlessly on this case, which is part of the broader investigation into the Jan. 6 attack that has 
led to approximately 900 arrests. 
Proud Boys Member Who Went on the Run After Conviction in the Jan. 6 Riot Gets 10 Years in Prison 
The Associated Press (01/04, Whitehurst) reported that Christopher Worrell, a member of the Proud Boys extremist 
group, has been sentenced to 10 years in prison for his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, where he 
was convicted of assaulting police with pepper spray. According to the article, after fleeing house arrest and faking 
a drug overdose, which involved significant resources including FBI agents and sheriffs deputies, Worrell was 
recaptured and faced prosecutors' request for a 14-year sentence. The article explained that this case is part of the 
larger Jan. 6 investigation, in which more than 1,200 people have been charged, and over 700 sentenced, reflecting 
the ongoing legal repercussions of the Capitol riot. The Hill (01/04, Lee) also reported on the story. 
Army Officer Alleges Reprisal for His Account of Capitol Riot Response 
The Washington Post (01/04, Lamothe) reported that Earl Matthews, a key figure in the Jan. 6 investigation and a 
colonel in the Army Reserve, alleges that the Army is blocking his promotion due to his criticism of the Pentagon's
