4. If the Event is cancelled for any reason whatsoever, RSW shall refund to IIR the full 
Sponsorship Fee, without deduction or setoff, within ten days after cancellation. 
B. Sales of Event Passes and Sponsorships by IIR; Sales of Event Apps 
1. RSW hereby engages IIR as RSW's representative to sell Event passes and sponsorships for 
the Event (including dinner underwriting sponsorships). IIR shall use commercially 
reasonable efforts to promote such sales, and shall at all times conduct its activities in a 
professional manner in accordance with the highest standards in the industry. It is the hope 
and expectation of the parties that IIR's efforts will generate sales of 50 Event passes. 
2. IIR shall collaborate with RSW to create marketing materials to complement IIR's sales 
activities. RSW shall supply to IIR all information reasonably required to produce such 
materials, including details concerning Event activities and the substance of conversational 
topics to be introduced at Event forums. IIR shall create such marketing materials in 
consultation with RSW, and RSW shall have final approval over such materials, which 
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. 
3. IIR and RSW shall consult with one another to create the components of Event sponsorship 
packages, which shall in any event be subject to RSW's final approval. 
4. In consideration for IIR's sales efforts, RSW shall pay to IIR a commission of 15% of the gross 
amounts actually received by RSW (exclusive of any sales or service taxes) from sales of 
Event passes and sponsorships generated through IIR's efforts . 
5. In determining whether a given sale was generated by IIR, the parties shall act fairly and 
reasonably, with any differences of opinion being resolved through direct discussion 
between RSW and IIR's CEO, Debra Chipman. IIR shall endeavor to keep RSW informed of its 
sales efforts throughout the process in order to minimize the chances of a misunderstanding 
between the parties in this regard. 
6. Not later than 30 days after the conclusion of the Event, IIR shall send to RSW a statement 
listing the sales of Event passes and sponsorships commissionable to IIR in accordance with 
paragraphs B 4 and B 5 above, and RSW shall pay such invoice within 10 days after receipt. 
7. IIR may also assist in the sale of an "app" covering the Event, which is being developed by 
RSW. While the Event app is expected to be supplied without additional charge to Event 
attendees, it is expected that non-attendees may purchase the app separately following 
conclusion of the Event, at a price to be determined by RSW in his sole discretion. Any sales 
of such app generated through IIR's efforts shall be similarly subject to a 15% commission, 
which shall be paid by RSW not later than 10 days after the end of each calendar month in 
respect of sales made during such month, for as long as such sales shall continue. The 
principles set forth in paragraphs B 5 and B 6 shall apply in determining whether a given sale 
is commissionable to IIR.
