factors which can take into consideration sales of a highly technical book to a small but 
influential audience. Metrics covering "amplified" audiences will be described in the following 
section.) 
One of the virtues of quantifying impact in terms of volume of sales is that it can focus 
the mind on the huge difference that can be made by working with agents, presses and editors 
who can make a major success of a book. The vast majority of academic books are published 
with press runs of less than 1,000 copies. However, some books in the broadly "academic" 
market can be edited, packaged and marketed for outreach in the ballpark of 50,000 copies and 
above. It is clear that the best science and religion books can compete in this upper echelon 
market. It can be very illuminating to think through the huge difference in impact that can be 
made by scaling-up the size of a book project's audience by two orders of magnitude. 
A simple gauge of the cost-effectiveness of a book project is the cost per book sold: 
CPBS = [project expense] / [number of books sold] 
Example: $100,000 project; 25,000 books sold 
CPBS = $4 philanthropic subsidy / book sold 
It is obvious that the CPBS will represent a rather unattractive $100 subsidy per book if 
the sales are at a sales volume for a typical academic book of only 1,000 books. Therefore using 
this metric, the cost-effectiveness of a philanthropic investment in a book project has much to do 
with whether or not the book is widely promoted and sells well or not. Often, academics are 
motivated more by the fact of having the opportunity simply to publish a book, rather than by the 
volume of published book sales. However, it can be a tremendous career (and income) booster 
to author a hot selling book. It also will assist the field (of science & religion) greatly if a 
number of authors in the field are able to become well-known through high volume books sales. 
This should be possible in a similar manner as is observed in sales of the many excellent books 
on science which sell widely in the high end popular market. The key is to link with prominent 
editors who have the strong backing of their marketing departments. A careful study of the 
various components and connections to make for a big seller can be illuminating for an aspiring 
writer with an entrepreneurial spirit. 
6. Public communication effectiveness measures: 
In this section we extend our metricated measures of outreach to an audience in terms of 
"minutes of attention" and "media impressions." These measures are commonly used for 
quantifying projections in the advenizing industry. They do not gauge impact or quality so much 
as simply the domain or extent of the communicative outreach using various forms of media. 
They also allow linkage with media demographics which filter for certain targeted sub-
populations within the total audience. For advertisers, the especially sought after sub-populations 
may be consumers of various types (for example, expectant or new parents in the case of diaper
