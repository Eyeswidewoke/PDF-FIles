About using your card in Part 2 of the Cardmember Agreement is amended by deleting the About Pay Over Time features 
sub-section and replacing it with the following: 
More About Pay Over 
Time 
With Pay Over Time, you have the option to 
pay your Account Total New Balance each 
month, the Minimum Payment Due or anything 
in between. On each statement, your Account 
Summary will show your Pay Over Time New 
Balance, which is the amount that is eligible to 
be paid over time (see When you must pay in 
Part 2). 
We apply a charge to the relevant Pay Over 
Time balance in accordance with the selection 
in effect at 8 p.m. Eastern Time on the 
transaction date provided by the merchant. 
The transaction date provided by the merchant 
may differ from the date you made the 
charge if, for example, there is a delay in the 
merchant submitting the transaction to us or 
if the merchant uses the shipping date as the 
transaction date. 
Certain charges are not eligible for Pay Over 
Time, such as cash and similar transactions. 
We may change which charges are eligible to 
be placed into your Pay Over Time feature. 
We assign a Pay Over Time limit to your 
Account. We will not place any charge into 
a Pay Over Time balance if it would cause 
the total of your Pay Over Time balances to 
go over your Pay Over Time Limit. Your Pay 
Over Time Limit is shown on page 1 of Part 1 
and on each statement. We may increase or 
reduce your Pay Over Time Limit. We may do 
so even if you pay on time and your Account 
is not in default. We will tell you if we change 
that amount. You must pay in full all charges 
that are not placed into a Pay Over Time 
balance. 
About your Minimum Payment Due in Part 2 of the Cardmember Agreement is amended by deleting the How we calculate 
your Minimum Payment Due sub-section and replacing it with the following: 
How we calculate your 
Minimum Payment 
Duo 
The Minimum Payment Due is the Pay In Full New Balance plus any Pay Over Time Minimum 
Due. To calculate the Pay Over Time Minimum Due for each statement, we start with the higher 
of: 
(1) interest charged on the statement plus 1% of the Pay Over Time New Balance (excluding 
interest on the statement); or 
(2) $35. 
Then we round to the nearest dollar and add any Pay Over Time amount past due. Your Pay 
Over Time Minimum Due will not exceed your Pay Over Time New Balance. You may pay more 
than the Minimum Payment Due, up to your entire outstanding balance, at any time. 
EXAMPLE: Assume that you have a Pay Over Time New Balance 
of $3.000. interest of $29.57. no amounts past due. and a $400 
Pay In Full New Balance. 
(1)$29.57 + 1% multiplied by ($3.000 - 529.57) r$59.27 
(2) $35 
The higher of (1) or (2) is 559.27. which rounds to 
$59.00. The Pay Over Time Minimum Due of $59.00 plus the 
Pay M Full New Balance of $400 together make up the Minimum 
Payment Due of $459.00.
