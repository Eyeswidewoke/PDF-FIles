WASHINGTON'S SCHEDULE 
• Today's Events In Washington. 
LEADING THE NEWS 
Kelly Joins At Least 12 GOP Lawmakers Calling For Trump To Give Biden Access To 
Classified Intelligence Briefings. 
On CBS This MorningVi (11/13, 2.36M), Paula Reid reported a "growing number of 
Republicans...say that Biden should at least get...access [to classified intelligence briefings], 
including the President's allies like" Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and Ted Cruz (R-TX). On 
NBC's TodayVi (11/13, 2.87M), Kristen Welker reported, "At least a dozen [Republican 
lawmakers are] now saying Mr. Biden should receive classified intelligence briefings, which are 
being blocked by the White House." 
Politico (11/13, Lippman, 4.29M) reports former White House chief of Staff John Kelly in 
an interview on Friday argued Biden "should start receiving intelligence briefings, and the delay 
in allowing the transition to officially get started is damaging U.S. national security." Kelly said, 
"You lose a lot if the transition is delayed because the new people are not allowed to get their 
head in the game." Kelly added, "The president, with all due respect, does not have to concede. 
But it's about the nation. It hurts our national security because the people who should be 
getting [up to speed], it's not a process where you go from zero to 1,000 miles per hour." 
Meanwhile, Reuters (11/13, Lewis) reports that Biden transition official Jen Psaki on Friday 
"said the fact that Biden was not yet receiving classified intelligence briefings could hurt his 
preparations to govern," but she announced that Biden "will be briefed by national security 
experts next week." The Washington Times (11/13, McLaughlin, 492K) reports Symone 
Sanders, a senior adviser to Biden, during an appearance on CNN "said Friday the growing 
chorus of Republicans calling for Mr. Biden to start receiving intelligence briefings shows it is 
time for...Trump to throw in the towel." 
However, Politico (11/13, Forgey, 4.29M) reports former President Barack Obama in an 
interview with "CBS Sunday Morning" scheduled to air this weekend "said...it `has been 
disappointing' to see congressional Republicans remain supportive of...Trump's baseless claims 
of widespread voter fraud and his refusal to concede the 2020 White House race to...Biden." He 
said, "There's damage to this." Obama added, "What happens is that the peaceful transfer of 
power - the notion that any of us who attain an elected office, whether it's dog catcher or 
president, are servants of the people, it's a temporary job, we're not above the rules, we're not 
above the law - that's the essence of our democracy." In addition, Obama "described the fraud 
allegations leveled by GOP lawmakers as disingenuous, saying that `they obviously didn't think 
there was any fraud going on, because they didn't say anything about it for the first two days' 
after Election Day, when the results in some key swing states were still unsettled." 
In addition, Terry Moran said on ABC World News TonightVi (11/13, story 4, 3:31, Muir, 
6.44M) that Trump's refusal to concede "is throwing a wrench into Biden's plan to tackle the 
virus. His team has been blocked from coordinating with the White House coronavirus task 
force." Under the headline "Trump's Stonewalling Of Biden's Transition Team Threatens National 
Security, Democrats Say," the New York Times (11/13, Sanger, Stolberg, 18.61M) reports that 
as they have been "deprived of access to secure government communications by the Trump 
administration, Mr. Biden's team of more than 500 former officials and outside experts has 
embraced workarounds." 
In an analysis, the Washington Post (11/12, Phillips, 14.2M) says that national security 
officials "are concerned...other countries - and the coronavirus - could take advantage of a 
slowed transition for...Biden," and democracy experts "warn that the Republican Party is 
undermining the foundations of the U.S. electoral system and that the GOP is mirroring 
authoritarianism."
