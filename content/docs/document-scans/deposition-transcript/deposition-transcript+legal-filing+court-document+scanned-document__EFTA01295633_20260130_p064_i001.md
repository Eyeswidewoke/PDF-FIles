785 F.3d 895, *; 2015 U.S. App. LEXIS 7739, ea;

the parties' respective evidence." Id. The district court here did essentially the same thing 
as the district court in Allen, giving weight for good reason to the actual data available to 
the exclusion of the speculative extrapolation evidence. As in Allen, we should not say that 
the district court clearly erred in doing so. 
6. 
a. 
Plaintiffs' statistical evidence also does not apply controls for non-discriminatory factors 
that could very well have caused any observed disparities. See Lowery, 158 F.3d at 764. 
Seniority, for instance, influences promotions decisions at Nucor. See, e.g., J.A. 257. 
Disciplinary issues also led Nucor to reject certain applicants for promotion -- including 
frequent bidder Jason Guy, who is black. See J.A. 659.67; see also Coates v. Johnson & 
Johnson, 756 F.2d 524, 544 n.20 ("[A]n employee's prior discipline record seems likely to 
be a major, if not the most important, factor in [an employment] decision."). But Plaintiffs' 
experts admitted that they did not control for these or any other "additional [.114] factors 
beyond the control for each job posting." J.A. 1164. The majority would wish these 
considerations away, reasoning that Nucor never raised them. But Nucor's expert noted 
the need to "control for characteristics that would seem to affect the chance of selection," 
which would include matters like seniority and discipline. See J.A. 5893. Anyway, we could 
have affirmed the district court's decision here on "any basis supported by the record." 
Defenders of Wildlife v. N.C. Dep't of Transp., 762 F.3d 374, 392 (4th Cir. 2014). 
The majority also tries to summon its own justifications for these omissions, implying that 
records were not available to control for matters like discipline. Maj. op. at 25. Even 
Plaintiffs' experts conceded that they were. See J.A. 1165 (acknowledging that Nucor had 
maintained and produced "bidders' training, discipline, and bidding records"); see also J.A. 
5893 (Nucor's expert observing that "separate p941] discipline and training files [were] 
provided to Drs. Bradley and Fox and [him]"). And, based on allegations and personal 
assessments from Plaintiffs themselves, the majority assumes that potential explanatory 
variables are themselves racially biased. See maj. op. at 25-26. Yet here again, Plaintiffs' 
experts do not assume so, perhaps because r1151 there is no concrete evidence of such 
taint in the record. See Ottaviani v. State Univ. of N.Y. at New Paltz, 875 F.2d 365, 375 (2d 
Cir. 1989) (holding that district court correctly required the plaintiffs to account for potential 
explanatory variable where the plaintiffs alleged but did not prove that the variable was 
biased). And even if one were to indulge the majority's assumption that discipline at Nucor 
was itself biased, that outcome would not justify excluding the variable from the statistical 
model completely. "[T]ainted variables should not be routinely excluded from the 
regression equation. Instead, the effects of the inclusion of a tainted variable must be 
assessed and minimized." Paetzold & Willbom, supra, § 6:13. The majority's reasons, 
then, do not fill the gaps in Plaintiffs' experts' work. 
The failure to control for non-race-related explanatory variables "is sufficiently serious so 
as to weaken the statistical study's probativeness." Lowery, 158 F.3d at 764; see also 
Smith, 84 F.3d at 676; accord Rodriguez v. Nat'l City Bank, 726 F.3d 372, 384-85 (3d Cir. 
2013); Morgan v. United Parcel Serv. of Am., Inc., 380 F.3d 459, 468 (8th Cir. 2OO4); 
Munoz v. Orr, 200 F.3d 291, 301 (5th Cir. 2000); Sheehan v. Daily Racing Form, Inc., 104
