I spoke today with Dan Reynolds of Siffert's firm and Chet Lipton at Cooley. They wanted to 
let me know that Dan Zwim finally received from Dan Friedman, General Counsel of Corbin, 
proposed documentation for the restructuring at Corbin (Chet was copied on this as well). Chet 
and Dan Reynolds would not go into details about the restructuring deal claiming that they are 
bound by confidentiality obligations. All they would say is that they are they are being offered 
rights that confer treatment similar to the treatment of interests held by Glenn and Henry 
(essentially telling me nothing). They suggested that we get more details from our own contact 
(Glenn). Chet says that he and Dan Reynolds have to go through the does and take action by 
March 22, 2013. Chet and Dan also wanted to give us this info so that you could reach out to 
Glenn to see if anything could be done to try to get anything done along the lines of what we were 
trying to do previously (i.e., redemption of the interest by Corbin with certain proceeds to be paid 
to Jeepers or you or sale of the economic rights to you or Jeepers). Chet said that previously 
when they wanted to transfer to you or your entity Dan's interest or the economic rights in Dan's 
interest, even structuring it where you would have no voting, information or other rights or claims 
in respect any of the Corbin interests, Corbin's counsel was adamant that Corbin would not allow 
it. Also, you may recall that in December Dan Zwim had asked Craig Bergstrom, Corbin's Chief 
Investment Officer, whether they could revisit the purchase or redemption of Dan Zwirn's interest 
in Corbin. Chet told me that Bergstrom finally responded indicating that Corbin has no desire to 
redeem Dan Zwim's interests or have anyone from management purchase them. I again asked 
Chet and Dan Reynolds to speak with John to see if they could come up with any new ideas and 
Chet said that he felt that they exhausted all ideas when they tried to get this done previously. I 
asked them to revisit it, though my sense from them is that they don't have anything else they can 
think to do. Can you try to find out from Glenn about the restructuring and whether there is any 
way to get consent for assignment of interest or economic interest? Could we get Glenn to take 
Zwim's interest and then assign economic rights to you. Would that make it any easier with 
Henry?
