you are at putting yourself at risk of losing what good will and feelings i still have towards you. 
your revisionist history is both tedious and and filled with grossly distorted facts , while at the 
same time leaving out the very signifigant role in the events of the past. You seem to forget that 
you walked out. you seem to forget the harsh reality of the circumstatnces in which you were 
when we met . ( the seven years . that you refer to when you have been given more opportuinty 
than most poeple could dream of ) though you seem to continually suggest that you ve been held 
back, time and time again you have asked for help , given nothing in return and then come back 
for more. you seem to forget how many nights i chose to go into jail early than continue to listen 
to you. you forget that I have given you hundreds of thousands of dollars with no interference. , 
AFTER you decided to leave. You continue to ignore the facts of Your stubborn decision not 
to go to school , but to learn horseback riding instead, you learned to drive, you learned to fly, 
you ignore the fact that when i met you you had a toothbrush and were eating popcorn.. you 
couldn't even afford a sex toy on your own, you have earned no money whatsoever, but excuse 
it by putting the reasons on me, YOUve gone to shrinks , cousnelorss all to no avail. asked to 
commit to writing what you were going to do so that you woudl not be able to ignore it you 
chose to do nothing. you were not questioned by the authorities , and again conveniently forget 
that as i was in love with you , a significat impetus for my accpeting the deal offered wwas that 
everything you had done that might have put you in jeopardy would be covered and you would be 
out of harms way,l Instead of asking for help , you whine and demand to be paid what you 
believe you are owed. totally ignoring once agina the fact that YOU QUIT. inspite of that i 
continued to help. tried to be a friend , was let down time and time again, YOU quit, and inspite 
of that i have always been there for you.. years of emails reflect my trying to be a friend , in spite 
of you changing you mind re flying, in spite of you leaving me hanging at the last minute. help in 
the face of receiving nothing but recriminations and demands. I strongly suggest that you re 
write your last email. , . i promise to read it.
