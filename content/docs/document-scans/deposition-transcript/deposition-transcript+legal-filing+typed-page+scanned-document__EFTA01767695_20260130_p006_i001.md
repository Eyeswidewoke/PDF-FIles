and along the narrow strip of greenery along its banks that runs through the center of the country. The actual land area 
occupied by this huge population is small—larger than Maryland, smaller than the Netherlands. 
The bulk of the population falls between the ages of fourteen and thirty-four. People of this age group 
historically have been much more active in seeking social change, and at present they have a tough lot—unemployment 
among people between twenty and twenty-four is at 47 percent <http://www.acus.org/egyptsource/egypts-next-
president-will-inherit-unemployment-crisis> [3], even though many are well educated. Opportunities, especially the 
secure government jobs that many across the Middle East dream of, are limited. High birth rates are creating job seekers 
faster than Egypt's weak finances can create opportunities for them. 
Egypt depends on foreign food supplies and is the world's largest importer of wheat and second-largest 
importer of maize. These commodities, which have seen sky-high prices, must be paid for in foreign currency. The latest 
figures suggest Egypt's foreign reserves are down to the equivalent of $15.5 billion, scarcely surpassing those of Bolivia 
or tiny Croatia. This amount covers only about three months of vital imports. To make matters worse, two of its major 
sources of foreign income—natural-gas exports and tourism—have seen a precipitous decline since the Arab upheavals. 
Egypt increasingly relies on Suez Canal revenues and remittances from foreign workers, but many of the latter no longer 
contribute since the problems across North Africa have cut job opportunities. 
Without loans from world financial institutions, Egypt will go bankrupt unless it instigates rigorous reforms. But 
any austerity measures will be extremely unpopular with the underclasses, which expect to see their lives improve now 
that the Mubarak regime has been removed. In the past, Egypt's autocrats have bought off the poor population—a 
quarter <http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/3/12/33378/Business/Economy/Quarter-of-Egyptians-now-living-in-
poverty-State-d.aspx> [4] live on less than $500 a year, 40 percent 
<http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204059804577228984285910816.html> [5] on less than $2 a day—
with subsidies on fuel and bread. These subsidies are now worth almost 10 percent 
<http://www.cfr.org/egypt/reforming-egypts-untenable-subsidies/p27885> [6] of Egypt's GDP and do as much to 
create black markets as they do to help those in need. 
And then there are the environmental challenges. The Nile, without which Egypt cannot survive, is under 
pressure from both south and north. To the south, the river rises in Ethiopia (the Blue Nile) and Uganda (the White Nile) 
and flows through the two Sudans. These primary upper-riparian states are home to a combined 168 million people, a 
number that continues to grow. They need more water from the Nile for hydroelectric projects and irrigation schemes. 
At the same time, higher levels of evaporation and lower rainfall due to climate change are reducing the amount of 
water feeding the great river. These developments are slowing the flow and altering the quality of water reaching Egypt, 
thereby reducing agricultural yields. There are no multilaterally binding water agreements among all the states that 
share the Nile. Until such agreements on water sharing are reached, serious incidents including violence over water 
rights are possible. 
To the north, the Nile Delta faces the challenge of rising sea levels in the Mediterranean. This is increasing the 
salinity of its soil, in some cases making land uninhabitable. It has made farming more costly. Farmers have taken to 
buying bags of sand and spreading them over their land to isolate their plants from the salty soil. All the while, growing 
populations are reducing the land available for farming. This phenomenon is not unique to Egypt. Similar environmental 
challenges face low-lying coastal regions from Southeast Asia to the southeastern United States. 
Thus, it doesn't really matter what ideology Egypt's leaders claim to espouse. Addressing the fundamentals of 
the fragile economy must be their priority. This will require cooperation with their neighbors, Europe, the UN, major 
financial institutions and other world players such as the United States, China, Japan and South Korea. This suggests that 
any Egyptian government that gets distracted by other issues—whether a messy fight with Israel over the Sinai or 
domestic quarrels over Islamic traditions such as headdresses and alcohol consumption—will reap a whirlwind of 
discontent as basic challenges go unaddressed and the economic situation goes from bad to worse. Vigorous, swift 
action is essential to avoid a disaster.
