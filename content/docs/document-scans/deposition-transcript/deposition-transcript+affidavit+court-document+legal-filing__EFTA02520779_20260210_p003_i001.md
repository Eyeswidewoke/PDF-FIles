Our courts recog=ize that participants in an administrative investigation have a privilege =gainst a 
defamation charge. In Paros v. Hoemako Hospital, 140 Ariz. 335= 681 P.2d 918 (Ct. App. Div. 2 1984), the court 
recognized that the employ=r's response to a notice of charge of discrimination filed with th= Equal Employment 
Opportunity Commission was absolutely privileged. =n =i>Miller v. Servicemaster by Rees, 174 Ariz. at 520, 851 P.2d 
240, 243 (C=. App. Div. 1 1993), the court recognized the existence of a conditional p=ivilege for employees to report 
perceived acts of sexual harassment as pub=ic policy dictated that employees must be protected from workplace sexual 
=arassment. Cited approvingly, Carey v. Maricopa County, 2009 WL 750225 (D= Ariz. 2009). Both Paros and Miller were 
cases concerning discrimi=ation and harassment under Title VII. In addition to its obligations=under Title VII, the 
University must also operate its educational programs=and activities to be free from gender discrimination under Title 
IX.

Dear Naimah et al: <a 
Attached=you will find a letter from my attorney, along with a letter he sent to Bu=zfeed earlier in this 
week regarding the defamatory and false story they w=re planning on printing. The story was then published yesterday 
morn=ng. </=pan> I wanted to add to his letter, to reiterate our =oncern about how your office was planning to follow 
up on the false and de=amatory third-party allegations from Buzzfeed. Because this wa= initiated by an online 
entertainment news outlet with a clear agenda and =stablished record of propagating false allegations about me, rather 
than b= any of the individuals they refer to as sources, this should not be =onsidered a credible allegation worthy of 
investigation. I believe that ou= initial discussion was sufficient to settle this matter. Whethrr or not you agree with this, 
there are two things=l think are important to establish. <a 
Firstly,=b> that the University should not propagate what can be false all=gations from such a source by 
presenting them directly to current and/or f=rmer employees or to others. To do so would be to further their libe=ous 
agenda, as Mr Waldman has emphasized. In this regard, I would ap=reciate seeing copies of the correspondence you 
might send to current or f=rmer employees about this in the process of carrying out and concluding yo=r investigation. 
Secondly, I reiterate once again that t=e Origins Project environment is supportive, candid, frank, 
honest, and pr=ductive, with all employees being treated with respect, as well as being s=pported and mentored. I am 
proud of our team, and I believe they feel the =ame way. 
Thanks f=r your attention to these letters.
