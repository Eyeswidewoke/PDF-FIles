"T. S. Eliot wasteland ... a nation of housebound zombies," as Michael Eisner put it recently in a speech. Do =you think 
this could happen? What difference does it make if you invent =smart boxes to deliver dumb programming?

Interactive TV is probably a really bad name for the in-home =evice connected to the information highway. 
Lets say I am sitting at home wondering about some new drug that was prescribed to me. Or wanting to ask a 
question to my =children's teacher. Or curious about my social security status. Or wondering about crime in my 
neighborhood. Or wanting to exchange information with other people thinking about visiting Tanzania. Or wondering if 
the new lawn mower I want to buy works well and if its a good price. Or I want to ask people who read a book what they 
thought of it 
before I take my time reading it. In all of these cases being able to reach out and communicate by using a 
messaging or bulletin board type system lets me do something I could never do before. Assume that the infrastructure 
and device to do this is easy to =use and it was funded by the cable or phone company primarily because I =like to watch 
movies and video-conference with my relatives. 
All of the above is about how adults will use the system. Kids will =se it in ways we can't even imagine. 
The opportunity for people to reach out and share is amazing. This doesnt mean you will spend more time 
inside! It means you will use your time more effectively and get to do the things you like =more than in the past as well 
as doing new things. 
If you like to get outside you will find out a lot more about the places that are not crowded and find good 
companions to =go with. 
The bottom line is that 2 way communication is a very different beast than 1 way communication. In some ways 
a phone that has an unbelievable directory, lets you talk or send messages to lots =of people, and works with text and 
pictures is a better analogy than TV. The phone did change the world by making it a smaller place. This will =be even 
more dramatic. There will be some secondary effects that people =will worry about but they won't be the same as TV. 
We are involved in creating a new media but it is not up to us to be the censors or referees of this media—it is up to 
public policy to make those decisions. 
Because TV had very few channels the value of TV time was very high so only things of very broad interest could 
be aired =on those few channels. The information highway will be the opposite of =this--more like the library of congress 
but with an easy way to find things. 
I sometimes felt that this correspondence was a game I was playing with Gates through the computer, or maybe a game 
I was playing against a computer. What is the right move? What question will =get me past the dragon and into the 
wizard's star chamber, where the rich information is stored? I had no idea where Gates was when he wrote =to me, 
except that once he told me he was on a "think week" at his family's summer place on Hood Canal. I could not tell 
whether he was impatient or bored with my questions and was merely answering them because it served his interest. 
Because we couldn't talk at the same time, there was little chance for the conversation to move spontaneously. On the 
other hand, his answers meant more, in a certain =way, being written, than answers I would have received on the 
phone. I =worried that he might think I was being "random" (a big putdown at Microsoft) because I jumped from topic 
to topic. I sometimes wondered if I was actually communicating with Bill Gates. How hard would it be for =an assistant 
to write these messages? Or for an intelligent agent to do =it? 
I wrote a message titled "What motivates you?":
