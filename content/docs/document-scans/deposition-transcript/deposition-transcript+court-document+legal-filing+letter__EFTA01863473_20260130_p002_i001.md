know is hellacious, may I ask you to accept my apology for not reaching out to you, in the eye 
of MY storm, and accept and understand that I was in fear beyond all totality and I could not 
move left or right because of it, and was close to bed ridden with the fear of what was 
happening. I was paralysed. I was advised in no uncertain terms to having nothing to do with 
you, and not to speak or email you, and if I did, I would cause more problems to both You 
and The Duke and myself. So I shut down and ran away. I was broken and lost. So please 
understand, as I do about you, that I ws broken and not the strong person you know, and I got 
completely obliterated too, and I saw all my childrens work etc disappearing.. I shut down and 
everyone out. I was frightened. The Palace system is frightening, and each step I turned or 
each action was wrong and I did not want to hurt Andrew one more time. 
So Jeffrey, this email is sent with a hope you accept, and understand a little of my side too. 
We are and have both been in the firing line, both blamed for stuff we have not done, this front 
line attack has been like this for me for 22 years. You would have thought I was thick skinned 
enough to handle it. I know there are 2 sides to every story, I have heard yours, please hear 
mine. 
I am glad you spoke to James, and James made you aware from the British media standpoint, 
that all this hellaciousness had been going on many clays BEFORE my statement. And I was 
instructed to act with the uptmost speed, from most sides, if I was to have any chance at all 
holding onto my career as a childrens book author etc and a childrens philanthropist, and I got 
terrified. I should have taken advice from you too, before speaking to Geordie, and taken a 
day or two to think of the ramifications of my actions, but for the reasons as stated above, I 
was in over riding fear. I am sorry. I just did not know what or where to turn. 
I know James can send you every single article from the days, weeks, leading up to that 
Monday of the statement from the endless horrendous pages written about You and The 
Duke. So you can see why I became paralysed. 
I know you and James are going to work on a solution. 
In the meantime, I write this from the truth of my heart.
