Dear =awrence, 
<mailto

You are correct, I remember the incident at the bar with the student organizer very well. 
I was the one responsible for persuading you to come to Iowa for the conference - but had promised I would buy you a 
scotch if you agreed to be part of the program. We met at the bar at the hotel =nd Michael and Suzy from RDF joined us 
at first. Slowly some other people drifted in and joined us - one of them was the head of the Secular Student Alliance -
and then a couple of students associated with that organization joined our table. I think they were delighted to get the 
opportunity to meet you The women you mention, she sat across from you and was very chatty with you - very friendly. 
=nbsp;She was trying to convince you to come up to go to the hot tub and you replied that you did not pack any swim 
trunks, and she replied that you didn't need any - a towel would be just fine. 
I had the sense you were a =ittle uncomfortable and both trying to be nice but also 
trying to change the topic. At one point, you leaned over and asked me 'Is she hitting on me?" I replied that indeed she 
was =rom my perspective. Then a few minutes later =ou said she was rubbing her leg against yours. By then you were 
obviously not =omfortable - and she continued to invite you to the hot tub. You continued to decline - and it =as by that 
time becoming annoying. She finally realized that you were not about to go with her, so she left (the other students had 
left by then as well). After she left you =aid again how she was rubbing up against you with her feet - and you jokingly 
(or maybe half-jokingly) said to me something along the lines of keeping you safe from her during the conference. 
It might have been a year later = I saw a post by that student organizer who had hit on 
you at the bar and she had written that you had been the one who was hitting on her and tried to turn it into you being 
offensive. I alerted you to her accusation, and =hile nothing came of it at that time, I had said that if you needed a 
witness to that evening I would certainly step up as her accusations were completely false. I personally =hink she was 
offended that you declined her offer to go to the hot-tub. 
I think the reason why that evening stands out so well in my mind is that her flirting with 
you was so blatant and you were so uncomfortable with the situation. =nbsp;If there is a need, you can provide the 
person from Buzzfeed with my contact information. This week is extremely busy with all day meetings the rest of the 
week, but I will make the time to clarify the truth. 
Please give my best to Nancy and enjoy your trip to Peru. 
cheers 
Robin
