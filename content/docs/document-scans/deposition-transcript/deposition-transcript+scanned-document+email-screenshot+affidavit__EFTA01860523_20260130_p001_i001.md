Re: follow up 
jeffrey 
the stuff i am developing has the potential to go to charters as well. 
i want to develop software the can do online learning in a very elegant way. Am 
attaching a sketch of the model. I agree about the mess in education, and many 
ideas to develop. But need a base to create, and the resources to do it. 
the criminal angle is simply one hook to get some funding. but the more 
important point is that issues of self-control are predictive of academic 
achievement! low income kids have lower self-control and poor academics. there 
are powerful techniques to improve self-control, but they have yet to be 
elegantly developed and applied in the public domain. 
how do you propose we move forward? if you donate the funds to the Center that 
is linked to the Penikese School, I can use to develop these tools and then shop 
them to all sorts of educational arenas. Teh brain plasticity issue is red hot. 
Most are focused on working memory because of the application to alzheimer's. No 
one has really caught on yet to the self-control part, but it is ripe for 
developing applications. I just need the resources to bring the relevant players 
on board and make this happen. 
thoughts?
