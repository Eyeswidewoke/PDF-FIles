restaurant association's website claims the national median take-home pay for tipped servers is $16 to $22 an hour. But 
those same workers, according to the BLS, made just $9.01 an hour in 2014 — po=erty wages for a family of four and 
nowhere near enough to cover rent on the average two-bedroom apartment. (The association says this figure is low 
because some restaurants report tips improperly.) 
America's two-tiered wage system is hardest on women, who make up 71 percent of tipped servers—waitresses are 
twice as likely to use foo= stamps as the general population. And while federal law requires employers to make sure 
their tipped workers earn at least minimum wage after tips, that rarely happens—from 2010 to 2012, according to the 
Department of La=or, 84 percent of restaurants were in violation of federal wage law, "which means the women who 
put food on the tables in America can't actually afford to feed themselves," Jayaraman says. 
"The women who put food on the tables in America can't actually afford to feed themselves," Jayaraman says. 
The racist origins of tipping persist, meanwhile, in the take-home wages of nonwhite restaurant workers, who earn 56 
percent less than their white colleagues. In one study, researchers at Cornell University and Mississippi College found 
that customers at an unnamed national chain restaurant — even the black customers — tipped white server= better 
than black servers. This disparity, the researchers noted, could in theory render the tipped minimum wage unlawful. 
Jayaraman says she's not advocating the end of tipping, just that it take on a different form. Several celebrated 
restaurants, including Alice Waters' Chez Panisse and Danny Meyer's The Modern, have largely replaced tipping with 
higher menu prices or mandatory service charges. San Francisco's Bar Agricole tried it, too, but reverted to tipping after 
servers complained they were making less money. At least they're working in California, where they'll never take home 
less than the current $10-an-hour minimum wage, even if every last table stiffs them. 
Tipping is not about generosity. Tipping isn't about gratitude for=good service. And tipping certainly isn't about doing 
what's ri=ht and fair for your fellow man. It is also not about racism or a racist practice. 
Tipping is a practice encouraged by employers to get patrons to supplement the less than adequate wages that they are 
paying their employees. Because if you are expected to tip recommended an additional 15% to 30% as some restaurants 
print on their bills, it really isn't a recommendation, especially when tips are pooled and distributed to entire staff of the 
restaurants, which is more than often the case. 
Whether you start leaving 0% tips is up to you. I am not suggesting that you do it, and I don't do it myself. But the point 
is that an empl=yee's take-home pay shouldn't be up to you, or me, or anyone other than his/her employer. When we 
tip, we intend to do right by the people handling our food, but we may be just entrenching a system that takes 
advantage of 
them. But again it's totally between you and your servers.
