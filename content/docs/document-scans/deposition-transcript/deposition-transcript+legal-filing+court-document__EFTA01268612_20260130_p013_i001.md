CERTIFICATION FOR NO INFORMATION REPORTING 
ON THE SALE OR EXCHANGE OF A PRINCIPAL RESIDENCE 
This form may be completed by the seller of a principal residence. This information is necessary to determine whether the sale or 
exchange should be reported to the seller, and to the Internal Revenue Service on Form 1099-5, Proceeds From Real Estate 
Transactions. If the seller properly completes Parts I and III, and makes a "true" response to assurances (I) through (6) in Part II (or 
a "not applicable" response to assurance (6)), no information reporting to the seller or to the Service will be required for that seller. 
The term "seller" includes each owner of the residence that is sold or exchanged. Thus, if a residence has more than one owner, a 
real estate reporting person must either obtain a certification from each owner (whether married or not) or file an information return 
and furnish a payee statement for any owner that does not make the certification.
