We have a mask mandate but you cannot have a mask mandate, that does send a great signal, 
it does increase compliance, but there's never 100 percent compliance and that's a challenge 
that we have right now." 
Biden Advisers, Democrats Urge Americans To Take Pandemic Seriously. 
Joe Biden's Chief of Staff Ron Klain, on NBC's Meet The PressVi (11/15, 2.85M), said, "It's a 
very grave situation. Back in September then-candidate Joe Biden warned America was headed 
to a very dark winter if the administration didn't step up its action." Klain added Biden last week 
"met with his COVID task force and made a public statement afterwards where he called on all 
Americans to mask up. He urged governments to impose masking mandates now and reiterated 
the fact when he becomes President, he will impose one on a nationwide basis." However, Klain 
said Biden is "not the President now. There's not that much Joe Biden can do right now to 
change things other than to reiterate [that] all Americans and our state and local governments 
need to step up right now." 
Former Surgeon General and co-chair of Biden's COVID task force Dr. Vivek Murthy, on 
Fox News SundayVi (11/15, 1.15M), said, "We are in an alarming phase of this pandemic. But 
these are staggering numbers that we never really thought we would see in terms of cases and 
hospitalizations, not to mention the overall death toll, but what's happening is a couple things: 
One is we never really got our caseload down to a level that was truly manageable in the spring 
and we didn't actually have the testing and contact tracing to prevent subsequent rises and 
infection but what's happening now in particular is that with the winter as people move indoors, 
this is actually the perfect set up for the virus because we know it's easier to spread indoors 
than outdoors but there's one less component here which is really important, which is pandemic 
fatigue. People are tired." Meanwhile, Politico (11/15, Mueller, 4.29M) also reports Murthy 
described a national lockdown as "a measure of last resort" and instead pushed "for a more 
nuanced approach." 
Biden coronavirus adviser Dr. Atul Gawande, on ABC's This WeekVI (11/15, 2.91M), 
discussed what steps are necessary to halt the surge in COVID cases. Dr. Gawande said, 
"Number one is a clear voice from the top backing a national comprehensive plan. We've lacked 
that. It's led to disarray for the public and confusing messages. That will change. Number two is 
mask wearing as Admiral Giroir says. The evidence is overwhelming this can stop and reverse 
the spread. What I would say to those citizens is simply that when a person goes into a store 
and does not wear a mask, when they go to a public gathering and are not wearing a mask, 
they're hurting everyone's freedom. They're putting people in danger. Moreover, they're turning 
people away from shops and stores. That's hurting jobs. That's the critical mix of things. 
Opposing masks is like opposing washing hands. It's not political. We can do this." Bloomberg
(11/15, Czuczka, 4.73M) reports Gawande "called for targeted measures" such as masks and 
testing. 
Infection disease specialist Dr. Michael Osterholm, on NBC's Meet The PressVi (11/15, 
2.85M), discussed his projections for the coronavirus. Dr. Osterholm said, "Let me say at the 
outset the future is in our hands. Especially the next three weeks, because these cases are 
already in the pipeline, meaning people are already infected. The numbers will go way up. Our 
position is this: imagine what the world will be like if we make the changes we need to make. 
We will be heading to a vaccine in the next few months where we can start to imagine having 
summer baseball back, barbecues, et cetera. But in the meantime we are in a very dangerous 
period. The most dangerous public health period since 1918. If we don't basically take the 
important steps like some swapping air with our neighbors, our friends, our colleagues, we're 
going to see these numbers grow substantially." 
Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-VT), on CNN's State Of The UnionVI (11/15, 1.1M), said the 
Administration "put an emphasis on trying to get this vaccine done as quickly as possible. They 
were not alone. Everybody else worked together. We have a global pandemic. We have lost in
