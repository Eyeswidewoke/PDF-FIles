April 23 2012 -- Tu=key has blocked the participation of Israel <http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/tag/Israel> in a key 
NATO <http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/tag/NATO> summit that will take place in Chicago on May 20 and 21, 
despite=calls from influential allies including the United States, Western diplomatic have sources told the Hiirriyet Dai=y 
News. The veto was conveyed to the NATO <http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/tag/NATO> bodies by Turkish Foreign 
Minister Ahmet Davutoglu=/span> <http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/tag/Ahmet%20Davuto%C4%9F=u> during the 
Alliance's meetin= last week in Brussels. 
"There will be no Israeli presence at the NATO <http://www.hu=riyetdailynews.com/tag/NATO> meeting unless they 
=ssue a formal apology and pay compensation for the Turkish citizens their commandos killed in international waters"=a 
senior Turkish official told the Daily News. 
"There are demands from us for the removal of our veto, but this is out o= question." 
"Those countries who wish to see normalization in ties between Turkey and Israel 
<http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/tag/Israel> should advise Israel <http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/tag/Israel> 
to apologize and to compensate the killing of Turks in inter=ational waters," the official said. 
Turkey has vetoed a number of Israeli attempts to deepen its partnership wirh the alliance - such as opening an office at 
the NATO <http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/tag/NATO> headquarters and participating in the activities of the 
Mediterr=nean Dialogue group - on the grounds that it should first bear the consequences of its unlawful action against 
Turki=h citizens. This reflects the two-year old strife between Turkey <http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/tag/Turkey> 
and Israel, which is a result of the Mavi Marmara incident t=at claimed the lives of eight Turkish and one Turkish-
American citizen. The level of diplomatic relations between th= two has been reduced to the level of "second secretary" 
since then. 
Turkey's blockage against Israel</=pan> <http://www.hurriyetdailynews.=om/tag/Israel> was brought to the table 
during =he NATO <http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/tag/NATO> foreign ministers' meeting in Brussels on April 18, 
the Daily =ews learnt. Some ministers of the allied countries including the United States, France 
chttp://www.hurriy=tdailynews.com/tag/France> and Secretary-Genera= Anders Fogh Rasmussen indirectly criticized 
Turkey <http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/tag/Turkey> for bringing its bilateral problems with Israel 
<http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/tag/Israel> to the NATO <http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/tag/NATO> 
platform. Some ministers went so far as to vow to veto the parti=ipation of Egypt, Mauritania, Algeria, Morocco and 
other partner countries in the activities of the Mediterranean=Dialogue if Turkey 
<http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/tag/Turkey> continues to do so against Israel, something they called "= violation 
of NATO's values." 
Criticism from Davutoglu 
In response to such statements, Davutoglu harshly criticized his count=rparts sitting around the same large table. "You 
are talking about being=partners and partnership values. But partners, first of everything, should=act like partners, so 
that we'll treat them accordingly," was the main message Davutoglu delivered to his =/span>NATO 
<http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/tag/NATO> colleagues. He elaborated: 
- The army of a country which you call a partner killed our citizens upon a=political order given by its administration. We 
do not call this kind of c=untry a partner. 
- Turkey <http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/tag/Turkey> evacuated from Israel 
chttp://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/tag/Israel> not only Turks but citizens from many countries, after they =ere 
detained by Israeli forces due to Mavi Marmara incident. It also evacuated citizens of all nationalities from Lib=a and 
Syria without making distinction. Our expectation from all allied co=ntries is to pay the same respect to our citizens as 
we do to yours. 
- I assure you that Turkey <http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/tag/=urkey> will be the first country acting to prot=ct 
the citizens of NATO <http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/tag/NATO> countries in a similar incident. We believe in the 
notion of sol=darity in NATO <http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/tag/NATO> much more than the discrimination some 
of you have expressed.
