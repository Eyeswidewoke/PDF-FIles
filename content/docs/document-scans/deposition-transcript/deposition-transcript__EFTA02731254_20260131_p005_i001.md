And that made me more scared because she reminds me of 
and she has the female version 
accent of Jeffrey so I'm just a mess and nodded and she said in such a funny way. 
had the same idea about maybe writing out a list or timeline of my trauma just to myself 
and then maybe once I'm able to share then it will be kept safe until that time. I think I will try to 
do that but there isn't the time tonight.

family but I was convinced it was to meet Jeffrey, so I tucked myself in so tight under 
the table, covered my ears and the voice just continues. The next thing I know I have staff and 
other girls who didn't have family surrounding me and had cold ice in my hand. I was searching 
desperately for_, 
but she wasn't there and 
was trying to convince me that it 
was safe to come out but I wouldn't until 
finally came. Everyone was just staring at me, and 
it was so embarrassing and I asked 
what happened but she said that it wasn't important to 
talk about. Remembered I was supposed to go see 
so 
and it was
 with the same accent. I wanted to just s•

I talked more with 
and told her about

handle that because I wasn't sure if she was

back so tight. I don't think that helped m 
getting things out will help but that 
part only made me feel like a monster.

I made her promise until 1 
Pffrs old and we pinky swore. I met my goal of connecting with a 
staff member and I told her 
erything. She is safe and I know it will be safe with her. She said as 
long as I'm wearing her bracelet. I am safe to now write the trauma in here. I don't need to be 
detailed but for me to process and understand. She doesn't think I have a full understanding and 
thinks one day I'll need and want to process it with a grown up when and if I am ready but she 
wouldn't explain the things she felt I didn't understand. I promised I would do that as soon as she 
left and so I know I must do it before she gets back for lights out. I'm not sure how to do this but 
I'll do my best and if I did it wrong I'm sure she'll say something.
