Exercise of Purchase Right. 
Amounts deducted and accumulated by the participant will be used to purchase shares of our 
Class A common stock at the end of each purchase period. The purchase price of the shares will be 85% of the lower of the fair 
market value of our Class A common stock on the first trading day of each offering period or on the exercise date. A participant will 
be able to purchase a maximum of 4.000 shares of our Class A common stock during a purchase period. Participants will be able 
to end their participation at any time during an offering period and will be paid their accrued contributions that have not yet been 
used to purchase shares of our Class A common stock. Participation will end automatically upon termination of employment with us. 
Non-Transferability. 
A participant will not be able to transfer rights granted under our ESPP other than by will, the laws of 
descent and distribution, or as otherwise provided under our ESPP. 
Certain Adjustments. In the event of certain changes in our capitalization as set forth in our ESPP, to prevent diminution or 
enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits available under our ESPP, the administrator will adjust the number and class of 
shares that may be delivered under our ESPP and/or the number, class and price of shares covered by each outstanding award, 
and the numerical share limits set forth in our ESPP.

Dissolution or Liquidation. 
In the event of our proposed liquidation or dissolution, the offering period then in progress will 
be shortened, and a new exercise date occurring before the date of the proposed dissolution or liquidation, unless otherwise 
provided by the administrator. The administrator will notify each participant that the exercise date has been changed and that the 
participant's option will be exercised automatically on the new exercise date unless prior to such date the participant has withdrawn 
from the offering period. 
Merger or Change in Control. 
Our ESPP provides that in the event of a merger or change in control, as defined under our 
ESPP, a successor corporation may assume or substitute each outstanding purchase right. If the successor corporation refuses to 
assume or substitute for the outstanding purchase right, the offering period then in progress will be shortened, and a new exercise 
date occurring before the date of the merger or change in control will be set. The administrator will notify each participant that the 
exercise date has been changed and that the participant's option will be exercised automatically on the new exercise date unless 
prior to such date the participant has withdrawn from the offering period. 
Amendment; Termination. 
The administrator will have the authority to amend, suspend, or terminate our ESPP, subject to 
certain exceptions described in our ESPP. Our ESPP automatically will terminate in 2035, unless we terminate it sooner. 
2009 Stock Plan 
Our board of directors and our stockholders adopted our 2009 Plan in July 2009. Our 2009 Plan was most recently amended 
in September 2015. Our 2009 Plan will be terminated prior to the completion of this offering, and accordingly, no new awards will 
be granted under the 2009 Plan following the completion of this offering. All outstanding awards under the 2009 Plan will continue 
to be governed by their existing terms. As of September 30, 2015. options to purchase 106,133,176 shares of our Class B common 
stock remained outstanding under our 2009 Plan at a weighted-average exercise price of approximately $6.95 per share. The 
compensation committee of our board of directors administers our 2009 Plan. Except as described in this paragraph, options 
granted under our 2009 Plan are subject to terms generally similar to those described above with respect to options that may be 
granted under our 2015 Plan, provided that upon a termination of service, an option granted under our 2009 Plan generally will 
remain exercisable for three months following a termination either by us other than for "cause" (as defined in the 2009 Plan) or by 
the participant for any reason, generally for six months following a termination due to disability and generally nine months following 
a termination due to death and generally will terminate immediately upon a termination by us for cause. However, in the event of a 
termination of a participant's service other than by us for "cause" occurring on or after August 31. 2015 and before the date that is 
nine months following the first public sale of our securities, so long as the participant has provided continuous services to us for at 
least two years, any option granted under our 2009 Plan generally will remain exercisable until the earlier of: (i) three years from 
the termination date or (ii) one year from the date of the first public sale of our securities. Our 2009 Plan provides that in the event 
of a "corporate transaction," as defined under the 2009 Plan, each outstanding award will either be (i) assumed or substituted for 
an equivalent award or right by a successor corporation or its parent or subsidiary or (ii) terminated in exchange for cash, 
securities, and/or property equal to the excess of the fair market value of the shares subject to the portion of the award that is 
vested and exercisable immediately prior to the consummation of the corporate transaction over the per share exercise price 
thereof (if any). In the event the successor corporation does not agree to assume, substitute, or exchange an award under our 
2009 Plan, then such award will terminate upon the consummation of the corporate transaction. In addition, certain awards granted 
under our 2009 Plan provide for 12 months of vesting
