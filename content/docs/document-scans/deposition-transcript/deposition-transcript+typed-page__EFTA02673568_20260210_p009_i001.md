Your mail is the first time I have ever heard anyone suggest that John Malone and Jerry Levin deserve sympathy. 
They =are both great people. They are both smarter about deal making than I will ever be. John and Jerry and I share a 
vision of what the Information Highway can become. Its an incredible opportunity for all 3 =companies and we have 
been spending time to discussing how we might help each other. We don't have anything concrete at this stage although 
we =have developed a high level of trust for each other. 
I sent a message asking how much of his money Gates was planning on =iving away: 
Will there one day be a Gates Foundation, the way we have Rockefeller, Ford, Carnegie Foundations? When? 
How acutely =do you feel a sense of social responsibility? What kinds of philanthropy would you like your money to 
perform? How do you feel about leaving a =lot of money to your kids? 
Gates replied: 
I think that giving money away takes a lot of effort. Not as much effort as making it but still a lot to do it 
properly. Therefore when I am old and have time I will put some effort =into that. Assuming I still have a lot of money by 
the time I retire which is certainly no certain thing I will give away well over 90% of it since I dont believe in kids having 
too much money. I am like my friend Warren Buffett in this respect. I have already done some giving like to UW for a 
biotechnology department (Gate gave the University of Washington twelve million dollars) and some to Stanford for a 
computer =science building (six million) and some to United Way which I really believe in. I do believe in funding great 
research so some of my philanthropy will relate to that. Some to humans service activities. Some to education. Some to 
population control efforts if it looks like =donations can really help there. 
I wrote mail about "The Great Gatsby," which is one of Gates' favorite books. ("The Catcher in the Rye" and "A Separate 
Peace" are other favorites.) Gates dressed as Gatsby for his thirtieth =birthday, and again for an engagement party that 
friends and colleagues =in Silicon Valley threw for him and Melinda in September. (Melinda dressed as Daisy Buchanan.) 
Gates wrote: 
Gatsby had a dream and he pursued it not even really thinking he might fail or worse that what he dreamed of 
wasn't real. The green light is a symbol of his optimism--he had come so far he could hardly fail to grasp it. At the end 
Fitz is reinforcing what a romantic figure Gatsby is. Its also sort of about America but I think of it more in terms of the 
people. 
Once, when I was composing E-mail to Gates on an airplane, I felt physically closer to him than when I was composing 
from home. Perhaps I was thinking of all the thousands of people who have encountered this remarkable person on 
airplanes, restlessly wandering the aisles with his shoes off, or sitting in a seat staring into the screen of his laptop 
computer, rocking, writing E-mail that will be fired into the network when the plane lands and send hundreds of people 
=at Microsoft scurrying into action. 
Many executives in the telegraph industry, which had enjoyed control of the communications field since about 1840, 
believed =that the telephone did not present a threat to their business, because =no one would want a communications 
machine that did not leave a written =record of the conversation, as telegrams did. When William Orton, the president 
of Western Union, which was the Microsoft of its day, was offered the opportunity to buy Alexander Graham Bell's 
patent on the telephone for a hundred thousand dollars, he is said to have replied, "What use could this company make 
of an electric toy?" This remark seems less dim to me now. 
Technological change is not democratic, but if we did have a choice would we vote for a man who sometimes behaves 
like a ten-year-old boy to be the principal architect of the way we communicate with each other in the future? Or is it 
Gates' gift that he isn't socialized in a way you'd expect a corporate executive to be. =When I was ten, I would sit around 
with my friends watching it snow, and someone would say, "I wonder what the deepest snowfall ever was," or
