3) Market Economics. Shows the incremental P&L impact of each new market we add. 
4) Markets Open. Shows what markets we plan to open (and when) over the 
Plan years. 
Since flight operations began in October, 2009 serving the NY-FL markets, we have ramped 
up in four months with very little advertising to where in February we had 13 Shared-Ride flights (where customers pay by 
the seat) and 40 total shared-ride passengers, 34 of which were paying clients and 6 which were free companions (as part 
of our greet( card program). We also did an additional 1 I Charter flights in February (where a client charters the whole 
plane for a specific flight). 
Our Gross Margin on the Shared-Ride flights was ($7.597), or (9.5%), while our Gross 
Margin on the Charter flights was $18,140, or 13.1%. Our overall Gross Margin for all flight missions was S 10,543, or 
7.8%. 
A further examination of the Shared-Ride flight data in February indicates the 
following: 
*3 flights were profitable producing a Gross Margin of $10,349, or 31.6%. 
• 10 flights were not profitable and produced a negative Gross Margin of 
($17,946), or (38.0%). 
• The Load Factor (number of paying customers per flight) on the 3 profitable 
flights was 6.0 while the Load Factor on the unprofitable flights was 1.6. 
In considering this Shared-Ride flight data, it's important to understand the 
following: 
I) We need to consistently invest dollars in advertising or our Load Factor will suffer accordingly. Our 
Plan calls for an Ad spend of $80k (S40k per month for two months) for each market we open prior to launching our first 
flight, and then S20k per month thereafter to keep the flow going. Using this logic, during the period October 2009 through 
February 2010. for the two markets we have (NY-FL), we should have spent $160k in July and August for the pre-launch 
initiatives plus another 5240k in recurring campaigns for a total of $400k during this period, or 5640k for the first year. 
We only spent S I 50k during this period: and that was done in an ad-hoc fashion. 
2) We currently have approximately 500 clients in NY and 600 in FL in ow 
database (those with emails and phone numbers linked to those two markets). 
3) Using the actual average scat revenue of $2,354 for all Shared-Ride flights 
conducted in February (skewed to card holders at a discount vs. retail, which are driven by advertising, which would have 
been more like S3,000), and adding an additional paying passenger on each of the 10 unprofitable flights would have 
turned the overall Shared-Ride Gross Margin from ($7,597) to 515,947, or 15.4%. In all probability spending the full 
planned advertising budget of 5400k during this period would have increased 
the Load Factor funkier due to the nearly 3 fold increase in 
advertising spend. plus the average scat revenue would have been higher due to an increase in retail clients vs. cardholders. 
Our business model is predicated on consistently investing a sufficient amount 
into advertising in order to drive clients and trip requests and thus achieve an attractive Load Factor. At steady state, our 
Plan calls for an average Seat price of $3,024 and an overall flight level Gross Margin of 35%. When you add in the card 
sales, the Gross Margin increases to 47% and the resulting Pre-Tax income is 40%. 
Please don't hesitate to call should you have any questions.
