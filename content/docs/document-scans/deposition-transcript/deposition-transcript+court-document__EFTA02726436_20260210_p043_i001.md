really liked than, I took them three times. But I took 
2 
each girl. If I had a, if I had a notepad of 85 girls, 
3 
I took those girls. Those were the girls that I have 
4 
took. So, when I was done with those 85, 'could caft

the first one up and say, hey, do you want to go to 
6 
Jeffrey's; he needs to see a new vagina.

Q. The — is that what you told him? You called 
8 
them and told them, before you took them, do you want to 
9 
go to Jeffrey's; he needs to see a new vagina? Is that

MR. EDWARDS: Object to form.

18 
A. I said face. 
19 
Q. So, you misspoke earlier when you said that 
20 
what you told him was he wants to see a new vagina? 
21 
A. I didn't misspeak or spoke at all. They knew 
22 
what he wanted to see. They didn't just go there and 
23 
say, hey, I am here, Jeffrey Epstein. They took their 
24 
fucking pants off, and they said, here, pay me 5200.

knew the girls who were comfortable. And then a 
lot of girls weren't comfortable.

I would say, hey, you know, he is not really going to de 
5 
anything. You don't really need to take your clothes 
6 
off, you know, just to get them there. But once they 
7 
were there, they were scared out of their mind. They 
8 
did it anyways and some of them walked out. Some of 
9 
them did it, did the action and walked out and said I., 
10 
don't ever do this to me again. That was the worst 
11 
thing that ever happened in my life.

BY MR. LUTITER: 
20 
Q. Other than your lawyer, who have you made that 
21 
statement to? 
22 
A. !have made it to many of the girls. All the 
23 
girls who I have brought, I would get on the phone with 
24 
them, and I would say, hey, so-and-so, you know, never 
25 
wanted to go again. She had a really bad experience.
