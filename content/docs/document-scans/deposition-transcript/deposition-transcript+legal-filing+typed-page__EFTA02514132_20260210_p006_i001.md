I have already reviewed the facts about the way the Marital Trust was established and the obvious intentions, so won't 
go t=rough it again, but your account in the letter is entirely wrong, though it does exploit a legal technicality, and it's 
hard for me to imagine how this weird interpretation could even have occurred to you. 
Aside from many factual errors in your letter, whic= I won't review, I'm also amazed, and shocked, to read such 
statemen=s as "Carol's intention to leave some money to your children." Car=l's intention? Alone? Not my intention? Is 
this your concepti=n of what our family life was? I hope not. In reality, neither of us had separate "intentions." We 
decided together how to ensur= that the children and grandchildren would be very adequately cared for from my 
earnings of the years, and how the survivor would be as well.</=ont> 
I've just explained, once again, why you are ra=ically misled about what happened to my IRA under Max's and Bainco's 
super=ision, until I started looking into it and ended the practices that were rapidly depleting it. 
You say that you learned about Valeria in 2013 -- t=at is, when we met. It's quite true that I didn't consult lawyer= or 
financial planners or Harry before we decided to get married, just as Carol and I didn't, just as none of you did. I don't 
frankly unders=and what you are thinking. 
You are, again, mistaken about the sale of the Lexi=gton house. The facts are as I have repeatedly described. I surely 
would never have contemplated buying a Mem Drive apartment in a co-op with regular expenses and taking out a loan 
from a family trust had I not assume= that the loan would last until the sale of the Lexington house that would cover the 
costs of the new apartment. I've explained this over an= over. I don't understand why I have to say it again, and why 
you simply ignore what I say -- which is completely accurate. 
You report a visit by Harry and Max with an idea ab=ut using assets that you recount. I don't know where you got that 
fr=m. Nothing like that happened. They did come with an outlandish proposal that I at once rejected. Max had once 
come to Lexington to tell me that I had such enormous assets that I would never have a financial problem= Later he 
changed his story, radically: I don't know why. I had a p=ivate visit with Max in my MIT office in which he explained that 
I'd have to sharply reduce my past lifestyle, sell the boat and other such assets, because of the way my estate had been 
arranged. That's the first I'd heard of any of this. At that point I began to look into what was going on and found what 
I've described to you in detail, repeatedly= 
You say that "as far as we know, no financial planning has occurred, despite the passage of a year and a half since Max 
and Harry understood we all agreed it needed to be done." 
That's the first I've heard that Max and al= of you have been my supervisors. I had thought that Max was my lawyer and 
that you were my children. In fact, financial planning has now occurr=d, the first serious and careful planning since Eric 
Menouya, but it never occurred to me that I was supposed to be under the control of Max and Harry= 
You're right that I changed my relations with A=thony, as part of our financial planning. Again, it did not occur to me 
that this was anyone's business but mine. You can have your belie=s about the facts, but I have the facts available and 
feel I have the right to make such decisions without supervision, just as you do. 
You are quite right that I can repay the loan to th= marital trust, even though the profits from sale of the apartment are 
consi=erably less than your sources told you. I won't comment further about th=s, but you might want to think about it. 
As for my lifestyle, for your information it is con=iderably reduced from what it used to be, though I don't understand 
why that is your business, any more than I inquire into your lifestyles or seek to supervise them. 
The "sudden and sustained increase in spending=quot; is fully and completely explained by the practices I have once 
again review=d to you. That's why the IRA was depleted. Now I have ended t=ese practices and am no longer paying 
exorbitant fees to Max for such matters as the proposed will that I described to you.
