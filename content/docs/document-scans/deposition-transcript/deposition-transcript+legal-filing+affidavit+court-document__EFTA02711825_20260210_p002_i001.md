villages—with games teaching coding, mathematics and English. The effort builds on One Laptop per Child's 
program which has given thousands of rural Ethiopian children tablets to write computer programs in the language 
Squeak. iCog is soon expanding to a second branch in Hawassa. a smaller city near the capital and has 
collaborated with Addis Ababa Institute of Technology to form the first post-doctorate Al program in the country. 
Finally, iCog is a major contributor to the OpenCog foundation, the =open -source AI programming provider 
in the world and founded by Goenzel in Hong Kong. Open source means they share coding with Al developers 
worldwide and particularly to advance labs across Ethiopia. 
Other labs are laying a foundation for AI developers to work in their native Amharic language. EthioCloud, 
created the first advanced Amharic code programming language which runs on Microsoft's all-purpose .NET and 
C# platforms. The company also offers the first standard optical character recognition program to convert Amharic 
paper documents into editable text and the first Amharic text-to-speech conversion software. 
Fast on their heels, the Ethiopian government is rabidly eager to put robotics and advanced algorithmic 
intelligence into its mega-industrial projects, pan of its massive, Big Brother sounding, 5 year Growth and 
Transformation Plan (morphing now into the Vision 2025 plan). Its motivations range from likely megalomania to 
maintaining the multi-billion dollar flood of foreign investment which it relies on to stay in power. And given that 
it can't keep leasing out its land to foreigners, and that it sits on a goldmine of minerals and clean energy potential 
from geothermal to hydraulics, it is zealously enticing the most sophisticated technology partnerships from 
countries like China, India and Saudi Arabia to become a major honcho exporter (the 2nd biggest after South Africa 
according World Bank estimates). Current AI ventures and supporting infrastructure projects include a $1.4 billion 
mobile phone deal for Ethiotelecom to install network quality assessing robots in moving vehicles for mobile calls, 
advanced Chinese-built QoS (quality of service) ambient intelligence into the communication networks for its 
massive $4 billion electric Light Rail project. the largest in East Africa, US/French machine-learning self-
diagnostic intelligence software into the power grids to support the Blue Nile's S5 billion Grand Renaissance Dam, 
the largest hydroelectric power plant in Africa (which will also have its own tech park), cement loading robots and 
quality assessment robot technology for Dangote Cement, the largest cement plant in East Africa, self-diagnostic 
intelligence into the electric grids for the Ashegoda Wind Farm, the largest wind farm in Africa and self-
diagnostic intelligence into the smart grids serviced by Ethiopian Electric Power Corporation. 
The stage is also ripe for Al to be put into many more of its mammoth projects, including a S4 billion US-Icelandic 
geothermal plant, one of the world's largest, two deep space telescope observatories coupled with multi-billion 
dollar satellite plans, integration of intelligence into its own fleet of locally manufactured drones and factory 
robotics into a rapidly growing $10 billion dollar industrial tax free zone, primarily for the Chinese to outsourcc 
their own labor from $30 a day per worker in China to $1 per day in Ethiopia. 
Technological leapfrogging is a term that is proudly buzzing around the ministries and tech community of Addis 
Ababa. not to mention Africa: the notion that technology in developing nations can bypass the bureaucracy of older 
systems. The concept is hugely attractive but if basic human conditions such as nutrition, health, education.
