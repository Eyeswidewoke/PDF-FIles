HOWE MARINE SURVEYS 
SURVEY REPORT #P150513 JOHN-O-POINT 
EXTERIOR HULL, DECK & SUPERSTRUCTURE 
WETTED SURFACE: "JOHN-O-POINT" was inspected on 5/24/2015 while vessel was on the hard at Virgin 
Gorda Yacht Services, Virgin Gorda, BVI. "JOHN-O-POINT" was reportedly hauled for dry storage about 
one year ago. Wetted surface showed no evidence of grounding, delamination or weakness. The hull was 
sounded with a plastic hammer and no voids were detected. The red anti-fouling bottom paint showed 
good coverage but aged condition and should be renewed prior to launching to be effective. 
The two, four-bladed, right- and left-handed, 28" diameter by unknown pitch, bronze propellers, the 2" 
stainless steel propeller shafts, the bronze vee struts, the bronze through hull fittings, the bronze rudder 
posts and rudder blades were all free of pitting or wastage. The shaft and rudder zincs all showed proper 
wastage and effective protection. 
The twin rudders did not move in response to the steering wheel at the helm. At survey time, the power 
assisted hydraulic steering system was disabled. The rudder bearings at the exit from the hull appeared 
to be snug. ■ 
TOPSIDES: The topsides show overall strong and functional condition with painted green surface. 
Topsides show dulled and marked luster in some areas, particularly to starboard, with good luster with 
only salt water stains in other areas. Topsides show white boot top with white plastic rub rail along sheer. 
JOHN-O-POINT and Road Harbour, BVI are seen on the transom. 
DECK: The fore and side painted off-white non-skid surface in good condition with toe rail at deck edge. 
The open aft cockpit deck shows natural teak decking in serviceable condition with scuppers draining 
through the aft seat lockers. IN 
SUPERSTRUCTURE: The molded superstructure shows good condition with painted white cabin top fitted 
with light mast, four throw ring holders and two holders for buoyant apparatus. The overhead hatches 
show some deficiencies. • 
• 
INTERIOR 
LAYOUT: The forepeak shows the manual marine toilet centered forward 
at the bow with holding tank on the shelf above. The cabin shows vee 
shaped shelves to port and starboard at the bow with two levels for 
apparent luggage storage. 
Four battery boxes for 8D batteries are 
centered aft between the two bi-fold companionway doors to the main cabin. Main cabin is up three 
steps. Forepeak shows opening overhead hatch and four fixed cabin side portlights. 
The main cabin shows the helm centered forward with engine controls, steering wheel, spotlight control 
overhead, electrical panel to starboard and two battery switches alongside. Doors to the side decks are 
to port and starboard of helm. The passenger compartment is fitted with four rows of bench seats divided 
by a centerline passageway. A total of 24 guests can be seated on the cushioned seats. Additional seating 
is available on the three bench seats in the open cockpit aft. The deck house shows fixed windows to port 
and starboard and four opening overhead hatches. • 
FINISH & STRUCTURE: The forepeak interior shows painted white sole, hull sides and overhead. The main 
cabin shows black rubber like textured, non-skid surface, painted white cabin sides and overhead. Teak 
decking is seen on the aft deck. •
