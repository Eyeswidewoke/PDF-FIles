SIGNIFICANT NEWS EVENTS 
Judge Says Justice Dept May Have Committed Misconduct in Comey Case 
The New York Times (11/17, Feuer) reported that a federal magistrate judge warned that the criminal case against former FBI Director James B. 
Comey may be jeopardized due to apparent "government misconduct" stemming from multiple errors made by prosecutor Lindsey Halligan 
during her grand Jury presentation. The Judge, William E. Fitzpatrick, issued a 24•page ruling ordering Halligan to turn over all grand Jury 
materials used to obtain the indictment, describing the disclosure as "an extraordinary remedy" needed because the materials appeared 
Incomplete. According to the article, the Judge found that Halligan made at least two "fundamental and highly prejudicial" misstatements of law 
before the grand Jury and he further questioned whether both Halligan and an FBI agent who testified had conducted themselves properly during 
the proceedings. The article explained that the ruling follows earlier concerns raised by another judge about whether Attorney General Pam 
Bondi had lawfully appointed Halligan, who had never prosecuted a criminal case and was installed after President Trump removed the previous 
U.S. attorney who declined to pursue charges. The article noted that judge Fitzpatrick also raised the possibility that attorneycllent•privlleged 
information may have been improperly disclosed by the sole FBI witness before the grand Jury and he concluded that the series of irregularities 
could provide grounds for Comey's defense to seek dismissal of the indictment. Additional reporting on the story was provided by ABC News

Continued Reporting: After Trump Reversal, US House Pushes Forward on Epstein Vote 
Reuters (11/17, Morgan, Erickson, Allen) reported that the US House of Representatives is set to vote on releasing investigative files on Jeffrey 
Epstein, a late sex offender, after President Donald Trump dropped his opposition. Trump's reversal came after a House petition gained enough 
support to force a vote, with the president now stating that Republicans should vote to release the files. The vote is expected to pass, potentially 
unanimously, and would then move to the Senate, where it would need to be approved before being sent to Trump to sign. The Washington Times 
(11/17, Picket, McPherson) highlighted that President Trump stated that he will sign legislation releasing files related to Jeffrey Epstein if it 
reaches his desk. "I do want to [sign itj; Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House. "Here's what I want. We have nothing to do with Epstein. 
The Democrats do. All of his friends were Democrats. You look at this Reid Hoffman, and you look at Larry Summers, Bill Clinton. They went to his 
island all the time. Many others are all Democrats." The New York Times (11/17, Thrush) assessed that the DOJ is being used by President Trump 
as a tool to distract from damaging news cycles and target his political enemies. The article noted that 'frump has ordered investigations into
