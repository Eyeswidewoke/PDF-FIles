2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 97188, * 
from Hawaii, id. at 2; and July 1, 2016 for all other Class members, id. at 2; and extended 
the deadline for all Class members to opt out of or object to the settlement to July 1, 2016. 
Id. at 1. CAA updated the settlement website to reflect the extended deadlines before June 
20, 2016. ECF No. 107-1 ¶ 11. On June 20, 2016, CAA mailed supplemental notice 
postcards to a total of 13,141 Class members in Kansas, Oklahoma, New Hampshire, 
Pennsylvania, and Hawaii, and emailed a supplemental notice to all 111,893 email 
addresses on file. Id. ¶ 12. 
D. N14 Class member claims, requests for exclusion, and objections 
According to Plaintiffs, as of July 6, 2006, a total of 5,310 N14 Class members have 
submitted claims under the settlement agreement, and 2,064 claims have been approved. 
The remaining claims are under review or are awaiting supplemental documentation from 
Class members. Id. ¶¶ 17-18. One [14] hundred and twenty three Class members have 
opted out of the settlement, and 23 Class members have submitted objections to the 
settlement on various grounds. Id. at 11113-16; see ECF Nos. 75, 77-85, 96-98, 100-01, 
103-04, 106. The Court will address each of these objections individually in this opinion. 
E. Motions for final approval of settlement and attorneys' fees 
On May 19, 2016, Plaintiffs moved for an award of $2,320,000 in attorneys' fees and 
expenses for Class Counsel. ECF No. 86. Defendants filed a brief in opposition on June 
16, 2016, arguing that the Court should award Class Counsel only $1,820,000 in attorneys' 
fees and expenses. ECF No. 90. 
On June 20, 2016, Plaintiffs filed an unopposed motion seeking an order granting final 
certification of the N14 Class for settlement purposes, final approval of the settlement, and 
relief for N14 Class members under the terms of the settlement agreement. ECF No. 92. 
Plaintiffs filed a supplemental motion on July 7, 2016 containing updated information about 
Class member responses and discussing objections filed after June 20, 2016. ECF No. 
107. 
The Court held a fairness hearing regarding both issues as required by Federal Rule of 
Civil Procedure 23(e) on July 14, 2016. 
DISCUSSION (15] 
Before granting approval of the settlement agreement, the Court must consider: (1) 
whether the N14 Class can be certified under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23; (2) 
whether notice to the Class was adequate; (3) whether the settlement is fair, reasonable, 
and adequate; and (4) whether Plaintiffs' proposed provision for attorneys' fees and costs 
is reasonable. 
I. Final Class certification is appropriate 
The Court earlier granted conditional N14 Class certification, and now "final settlement 
depends on the finding that the class met all the requisites of Rule 23." In re Gen. Motors 
Corp. Pick-Up Truck Fuel Tank Products Liab. Litig. ("GM Truck Prods.'), 55 F.3d 768, 797 
(3d Cir. 1995). Under Rule 23(a), the Court must find that (1) the Class is so numerous
