Bo Diddley riffs, teenage anxieties and sharkskin suits but -- for all that -- the core of their sound remained country 
brother harmony," read their bio on the Country Music Hall of Fame's website. After averaging a Top 10 hit every four 
months over the next few years, the Everl= Brothers inked a 10-year pact with Warner Brothers Records (formerly=part 
of CNN's parent company, Time Warner, though now ow=ed by Access Industries) in 1960. More success followed --
including "Cathy's Clown," which the duo wrote -- and they stayed particularly popular in Britain.

By the 1970s, the pair was performing in a band that also included legends Warren Zevon and Waddy Wachtel. But their 
time together=came to a sudden end in 1973, when Phil stormed off the stage during a show in California. Th= brothers 
reunited on stage and in the studio 10 years later, leading to more albums, including "EB 84" (including the McCartney-
written "On the Wings of a Nightingale") and "Born Yesterday." Their remaining years were highlights by occasional 
shows, hall of fame induction= and various other honors, including a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1997. 
Who are the Millennials?

Having two childre= born between 1982 and 2002 I should know something about Millennials Baby Boomers and there 
was a generation called Generation X that is in between. As a result of doing research for this piece, I discovered that 
prior to the Baby Boome=s, Americans born from 1901 through 1945 are called the Greatest Generation as this 
generation was shaped by two World Wars and the Grea= Depression and transform the United States into the greatest 
country in the world. And depending on what you read there are a number of sub-categories, GI Generation (1901 to 
=924), Silent Generation (1925 to 1925), Hippie Generation (=946 to 1964), Baby Busters (1965 to 1980), Generation X 
(1975 to 1980), Generation YGeneration Z (1995 to now). And as you will see some of these generations overlap 
because there are no =recise dates when a generation begins or ends. But again, who are th= Millennials?

The Millennialab> generation is the generation of children born between 1982 and 2002, some 81 million children who 
have t=ken over K-12, have already entered college and the workforce. This generati=n will replace the Baby-boomers 
as they retire. The Millennials have different characteristics th=n any generation before them and in order to serve 
them better, K-12 education and colleges =nd universities are having to change the way they do business. The 
Millenni=ls have grown up in a society that is very different than any group before them. They have been plugged i=to 
technology since they were babies, are a safe generation, are the first generation for which Hispanics/Latinos will be the 
largest minority group instead of African Americans and have the most educated mothers of any generation before 
them. They are the most scheduled generation ever, are true multi-taskers, expect to have 6-8 careers in their lifetime 
and are attracted to diverse environments. The=Millennial student has been a different animal for their teachers. K-12 
institution=, colleges, universities and now the work force are wondering how to motivate and meet the expectations =f 
this generation.
