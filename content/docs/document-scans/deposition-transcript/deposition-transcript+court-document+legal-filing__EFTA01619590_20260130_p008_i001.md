Dear Ray & Legal Team, 
I have had a chance to peruse the proposed term sheet with Chopra Global. Here are 
some comments and queries: 
• Is it possible for us to define precisely, what "IP Assets" and "Non-IP Assets" are and 
define them for clarity? Also can the assets (IP/Non-IP) in the context of Chopra 
Enterprises be defined? 
• Would this be considered as a derivative work of existing IP and how would this 
be handled going forwarded. 
• In the Excluded Activities can we ensure that my consulting services for external 
organizations are covered? 
• Currently my commitment to the Chopra Center is between 70-80 days annually 
& this covers every course and service that CC offers. The valuation of Chopra 
Enterprises was based on revenue derived from these services. My compensation has 
been $120K/month, I would like that to be restored and guaranteed as a minimum. 
The 3% royalty becomes effective only after exceeds my compensation. 
• In the Right of First Refusal, can we establish a defined timeline (e.g. 2 weeks) to 
make a go/no-go decision? Following that the CG management should commit to a 
business plan to actualize the opportunity. If on the other hand CG is not committing 
to the plan. Then I should be given the option to pursue directly. 
• I feel strongly that we should invite an independent board of director to the 
board who has expertise wellbeing industry and also has expertise an entrepreneur in 
our domain. Tony Tijan (http://www.cueball.com/) who I know very well and respected 
in the industry with a proven track record is one potential candidate who comes to 
mind. Another person could be Steve Nelson, who is very well connected in the 
industry and also industry leaders such as Marc Benioff 
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Benioff). These are just my suggestions. I am 
happy to ask the people I had suggested to meet with all of you. But I would also 
welcome any person suggested by Ray, Matt or Alice.
