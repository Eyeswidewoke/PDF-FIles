On 8/20/09, Capt. Frick made contact with Probation Officer 
She advised Capt. 
Frick that based on her prior contact with Fill ahe was in compliance with the terms of 
his probation. Capt. Frick then questioned 
s to why he could be so far off a direct 
route and how much detail was included in this weekly schedule. She advised there was 
not much detail on the schedule or about the route. Capt. Frick advised 
that in 
order to avoid ongoing problems with Epstein that he would need a copy of his weekly 
schedule, and these schedules would have to be more detailed. Capt. Frick further 
advised 
that based on based on his observations, this was a clear violation of his 
i r
community control, and that absent 
direct involvement yesterday, Epstein would 
have been arrested for the VOP. 
advised Capt. Frick that she would meet with her 
supervisor and attempted to provide Epstein's schedule to him as well as improve the 
detailed information contained on the schedule. 
A review of the daily Department of Corrections log that is submitted by Epstein, 
indicated that he was at his office from 8:00 am to 10:00 pm that date. It appears that he 
falsified the document, because according to the above incident he was first walking to 
work at 4:45 p.m., which was totally in conflict with him already being at work at 8:00 
am. Additionally the statement made by his then probation officer that Epstein usually 
goes to work that time is also false and contradictory to his daily logs. A review of the 
daily logs from the time he was released from jail to the date of his incident revealed that 
one day he left for work at 2:00 pm, and every other day he left prior to noon, with a 
majority of the days indicating between 9am and 10am.
