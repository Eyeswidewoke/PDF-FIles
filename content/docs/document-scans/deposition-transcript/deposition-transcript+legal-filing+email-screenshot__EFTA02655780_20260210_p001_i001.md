Re: 
I'm sure you might think that photography is not a real job b=t it can turn into one if I do it well. At the beginning I will 
earn no mo=ey with it since I have to learn and I will probably need to work in a sho= or something to earn some money. 
My question is how do I learn by assisti=g a photographer if I work in a shop all day ?? How can I earn money to pa= my 
rent and living and in the same time learn a new skill in order to gro= in that specific field ? I'm not sure how I should 
manage this...
