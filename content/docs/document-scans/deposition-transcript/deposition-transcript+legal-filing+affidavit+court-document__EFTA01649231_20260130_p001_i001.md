Congratulations to us all for continuing the legacy of this historic institution. The SACs email presents a humbling retrospective of where we came from, where we currently arc, and where we must prepare to go in the face of an ever-
evolving threat picture. While the future may seem uncertain, there's no team I'd rather fight alongside than our very own. Be well and stay safe.

Colleagues, 
Today commemorates the 40th anniversary of the NY JTTF. During our forty years, thousands of agents, detectives, analysts, professional staff, and detailees have walked through our doors and aggressively accomplished the highest 
priority mission of the FBI. Our personnel, past and present, have selflessly and diligently investigated and mitigated the global terrorism threat and set the standard for collaboration with our partners. We have also set the tone for the 
FBI, and it is the contributions by you all that make us the model for law enforcement and intelligence agencies, as well as military task forces around the world. The fact that our NY JTTF encompasses 61 agencies and houses almost 
450 personnel, while effectively accomplishing our mission on a global level is a tree testament to our people. I could not be more proud of you all and am humbled by your focus, vision, and passion for what you do. Thank you for 
your sense of duty and dedication. 
I would like to recognize our twenty original FBI agents and NYPD detectives who took the initiative to create the NY JTTF in May 1980. You paved the way and built the foundation, which allowed us to grow and expand to 
unprecedented heights today. Know that our people continue to improve the NY JTTF through innovation, initiative, and continued assessment and reallocation of resources as the threat continually evolves. 
I am honored to incorporate the below note from Ken Maxwell (retired), one of those original members of the NY JTTF. He was assigned to M 10 Squad, precursor to the JTTF and an initial member of the NY JTTF from May 1980 
until October 1983. Ken was a supervisor on the JTTF from 1986 until 1993 and an ASAC assigned to the NYO Counterterrorism Branch from 2001 until 2002, playing a critical leadership role during the attacks of September Ilth. 
Good morning John, 
Thank you for forwarding Jim's email. I am copying him and the other JTTF leaders/members that he had on his address line as well. And thank you Jim, for providing me the opportunity to contribute to the anniversary message. 
Like everyone, I am greatly disappointed that we had to postpone our gala 40th Anniversary event that all of you had taken the leadership initiative to plan, which I am confident will come to fruition after this crisis is over. Here are just 
a few of my thoughts as I reflect back forty years ago on the origins of the JTTF and how it has evolved into the profession's foremost "tool" in combatting terrorism today. Submitted humbly, for your consideration: 
Many people today may not realize that forty years ago, like today, New York City was the primary venue for terrorism in our country. Many domestic terrorist groups represented a violent scourge upon New York during the 1970s and 
1980s, such as the Puerto Rico Independence advocate, the "FALN", the anti-Castro group, "Omega 7", the Croatian independence organization, 'OTPOR", the "United Freedom Front" (Top Ten Fugitives - Levasseur, Manning, et al), 
the "Jewish Defense League", and a very organized and formidable group, "The Family" made up of remnants of the "Weather Underground". "Black Liberation Army" and "Republic of New Afrika", and still others. They represented 
an overwhelming challenge for law enforcement at the time. Collectively, these nefarious organizations were responsible for creating mayhem and fear throughout the New York area over decades, having been responsible for multiple 
bombings of government and corporate buildings, the death of innocent New Yorkers, numerous armed robberies of banks and armored cars and the vicious slaying of police officers.
