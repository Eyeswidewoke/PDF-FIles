In a recent article in The New Republic, Elizabeth Stoker Bruenig pointed out t=e newest lunacy of the Right After 
President Barack Obama noted du=ing the last National Prayer Bre=kfast that Christians have commi=ted acts of 
violence in the name of Christianity, there are a lot of direc=ions conservatives could have gone. The sanest direction 
would have been to accept that Christians=have done terrible things under the banner of faith — even religio=s we find 
familiar and comforting can be contorted under the right conditi=ns. This was undoubtedl= the point the president was 
attempting to make, in an effort to maintain =ome semblance of fairness as he addressed the problem of Islamic 
terrorism= 
Instead, a number of conservatives tried to defend =he Crusades 
herein lies the lunacy.... At National Review Onlin=, 
a popular conservative blogging platform, Jonah Goldberg argued that the=Crusades were essentially justified in the 
context of what he identifies a= Muslim aggression. "For starters," the Crusades—despite their terrible o=ganized 
cruelties — were a defensive war." Note t=at the plural "Crusades" transforms by th= end of the sentence into the 
singular "a ... war*=800: Goldberg was closer to the mark at the start of the senten=e than at the end, as there were 
multiple Crusades, and each of them were =istinct affairs. Some, for example, were initiated by the papacy; others w=re 
initiated by kings against the wishes of the Church, and some, like the=C24>Children's Crusade, now appear to be at 
least somewhat myt=ological. More slippery is the tantalizingly italicized word Q=800defensive," which conservatives 
also periodically ap=Iy to the Civil War with similar intentions of historical whitewashing.Q=A0 
As David Perry points out at The Guardian, a ho=t of other conservative defenses of the Crusades have accompanied 
Goldberg=E244>s: from spirited justifications to softer arguments. Louisiana Gov=rnor Bobby Jindal's claim, for 
instance, was that the Crusades hap=ened so long ago as to be irrelevant in all modern contexts, and that the =ime 
spent discussing them in Obama's speech could have been put to bet=er use combatting ISIS. 
One =ould interpret these bizarre defenses as evidence that, for a certain bran= of Christian, the fact that Christians can 
and do pervert religion in the=service of evil deeds is literally unbelievable. But this would=seem a remarkable stretch, 
given that even Judas Iscariot has a place in t=e Christian economy of salvation. In other words, Christians ca= usually 
fathom, when thinking rationally, the idea that terrible things a=e a part of our collective history. 
Perhaps conserva=ives merely found the criticisms of the Crusades cynical, given that their=historical distance makes 
any genuinely felt implication on the president=E244s behalf unlikely. In this case, the defense of the Cru=ades reads 
as a reflexive measure, meant to press Obama into more compromi=ing territory, where he might have the courage to 
remark on a Christian at=ocity he himself feels guilty about. Yet it seems unlikely that=offering examples of more recent 
Christian evils — such=as racism and slavery, the conquest of the Americas, the Bosnian War, or c=mplicity in the 
Rwandan Genocide — would have won Obama any points=for sincerity. Each would most likely be respectively 
dismissed=as race baiting, as anti-American, as arguably legitimate, and as irreleva=t. 
It's likeliest that the conservative de=ense of the Crusades is directly related to their status as a touchstone o= American 
civic religion. When the Crusades are represented in =merican culture now, they are a symbol of Christian gusto, 
whether positiv= or negative. They resonate with the idea of a robust, aggressi=e Christianity, a faith with the masculine
