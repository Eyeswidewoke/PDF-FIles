James Malcolm is updating his view on the Bo' - he thinks there is now material event risk for the 
July meeting which warrants some 3-month vol premium on Yen assets and a close following of 
domestic data and news in the interim. Is the Sal stance shifting from "no-ease-unless-things-
worsen" .... to "ease-unless-things improve" mode ? 
I think it makes a lot of sense to own some low delta, low premium $1PY upside at the moment 
We are axed to sell 50m$ payout of a 51h August expiry 133.15 One Touch at just 8% (mid 5%) 
So invest 4m$ upfront to make 50m$ if the level trades at any point during the lifetime of the trade

From James Malcolm : 
Minor tweaks or comments in recent BoJ reports suggest the central bank is becoming more nervous 
about missing its inflation target a little over two years after it was lifted and a radical new QE program 
to achieve it was implemented. They suggest that if the economy does not pick up substantial 
momentum over the next ten weeks additional easing may be warranted. The July 15 monetary policy 
meeting is key as it provides for an interim assessment of policy board member's price and growth 
forecasts, and comes just after the Bank's quarterly Tankan and public opinion survey. Beyond the hard 
data, these will show whether spending intentions and inflation expectations are lifting in response to 
higher profits and wages absent the consumption-tax drag. 
What has changed? This week's semiannual Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices report ('The Bank's 
View') replaced its assessment that "there are downside risks" for prices with the starker phrase that 
"risks are skewed to the downside." A research study on the impact of QE thus far, published today, 
concluded that "in order to achieve the price stability target of 2% in a stable manner, a further increase 
in inflation expectations is necessary." It also said that while the overall results have been broadly in line 
with expectations "... [the) demand component data for real GDP -- particularly private consumption --
point to considerably weaker improvements than predicted," even if, on the other hand, actual 
increases in corporate profits and employee income have noticably exceeded expectations. And an 
empirical regime-switching model that researchers at the Bank have have developed shows that the 
likelihood of a switch in inflation to a 2% trend remains very low. In fact, it has turned down from about 
20% to 10% more recently, while the probability of the trend being at 1% has risen to about 55% from 
less than 20% pre-2013 (chart below). That is good in so far as the probability of the trend being at zero 
has dropped from stably more than 80% to less than 30% today, yet that is clearly not something which 
Mr Kuroda will settle for.
