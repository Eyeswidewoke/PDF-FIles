Asia FX. Positing on positioning 
The sharp rebound in Asian currencies in recent days can trace its 
roots to three drivers: 1) market re-pricing of the Fed after the weak 
NFP; 2) a more benign view of CNY ahead of the SDR review, and 
given better China reserves data, and stronger fixings; 3) stretched long 
USD/Asia positioning. In this note, we take stock of a range of 
positioning metrics to gauge how far the unwind has run. 
• 
Long USD/Asia NEW positioning has largely ['cur, 
•J..% The 
average 3M NDF-onshore forward implied yield spread in Asia has 
fallen sharply. The spread is now near negative extremes that have 
held since the 2011 EM sell-off (Chart 1). This suggests offshore 
investors have rapidly unwound long USD asset hedges or 
speculative positions. For five pairs (MYR, PHP, IDR, KRW, TWD) 
the offshore-onshore yield spread is at or near the lowest level over 
the past year (Chart 2). The front ends of the USD/MYR and TWD 
NDF curves are trading below spot. 
• 
KRW and IDR are now trading stronger than pre-CNY deval levels 
(Chart 3). PHP and THB have retraced all their losses since the 
China deval. MYR stands out as still trading 5% weaker versus 
then.

On average, ATM vol curves remain very flat (Chart 4) although this 
masks intrar egional divergence Vol

very high realized volatility, with gamma still valuable given sharp 
moves in both directions. For TWD, this is likely a reflection of the 
unwind of structured supply in the front end, while for SGD this 
could capture the premium on the MAS event.

curve,:. as the 
market is increasingly convinced of the "stable-until-SDR-review" 
thesis, and is encouraged by official rhetoric, USD supply, and 
lower fixings. The scope for further vol normalization appears 
greater than in outrights. 
• 
Risk reversals have begun to retrace lower, but remain 
elevated versus lighter NDF positioning (Chart 6). Even after 
today's move lower in riskies, the majority of 3M riskies remain 
above the 70'h percentile of the past year (Chart 7). Front-end risk 
reversals have come off much more than the back end (Chart 8), 
suggesting the market continues to seek protection for the more 
medium term.

Recall that equity outflows were a much bigger 
driver of Asian FX weakness over the summer than bond outflows 
(this was a 'growth tantrum' more than a 'taper tantrum'). The 
relationship between average FX returns and equity inflows for the 
six markets that report daily data (KRW, TWD, INR, IDR, THB, PHP) 
has been exceptionally tight for years. The 3m rolling sum of equity 
flows had reached cyclical lows by end-September. The recent 
surge in currencies suggests the FX market is now pricing equity 
flows to flatten out. Indeed, October has seen small inflows across 
markets (Chart 10). Whether Asian FX gains can extend will depend 
on whether equity inflows return in size.
