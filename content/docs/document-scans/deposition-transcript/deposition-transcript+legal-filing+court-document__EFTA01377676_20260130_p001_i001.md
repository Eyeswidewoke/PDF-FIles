S-1/A 
Because of our approach, we have grown rapidly. Millions of sellers accept payments with Square. They span all types of 
businesses: from cabs to coffee shops, lawyers to landscapers, retail stores to restaurants. Although substantially all of our revenue 
is currently generated in the United States, we also serve sellers throughout Canada and Japan. As this international base of 
sellers grows, so too should our Gross Payment Volume (GPV) and revenue in these regions. We serve sellers of all sizes, ranging 
from a single vendor at a farmers' market to multinational businesses. Our products and services are built to scale, so sellers can 
stay with us over the life of their businesses. In the 12 months ended September 30, 2015, sellers using Square processed $32.4 
billion of GPV, which was generated by 638 million card payments from approximately 180 million payment cards. GPV measures 
the total dollar amount of card payment transactions we process for our sellers (net of refunds), excluding card payments 
processed for Starbucks and our Square Cash peer-to-peer service. Since we generate transaction revenue as a percentage of 
payment volume, we believe GPV is a key indicator of our ability to generate revenue. In the 12 months ended September 30, 
2015, over two million sellers accepted five or more payments using Square, accounting for approximately 97% of our GPV.

Table of Content• 
The foundation of our business model is the millions of sellers processing payments with Square. We estimate that, to date, 
nearly half of our sellers have found us and signed up, rather than us having found them, adding efficiency to our sales and 
marketing efforts. We measure the effectiveness of our spending by evaluating the "payback period," which we view as the number 
of quarters it takes for a quarterly cohort of sellers' cumulative transaction revenue net of transaction costs to surpass our sales 
and marketing spending in the quarter in which we acquired that cohort. We define a quarterly cohort of sellers as the group of 
sellers that are approved to accept card payments with Square in a given quarter. On average, our payback period has been four 
to five quarters. 
Revenue from our sellers has grown consistently over time, resulting in strong dollar-based retention rates. Transaction 
revenue net of transaction costs for each of our 18 quarterly seller cohorts (dating back to the second quarter of 2010) has grown 
year over year in every quarter since the first quarter of 2012. Over the past four quarters, retention of transaction revenue net of 
transaction costs for our cohorts has, on average, exceeded 110% year over year. 
The addition of new products and services is also a key part of our strategy. Our scale, growth, and unique insights enable 
us to serve sellers of all sizes with additional financial services and marketing services, further strengthening our business. For 
example, sellers who grow sales as a result of deploying funds from Square Capital into their business will ultimately process 
increased payment volume with us. 
We earn nearly all of our revenue from payments and POS services. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 
transaction revenue and Starbucks transaction revenue together represented 95% of total net revenue. For the nine months ended 
September 30, 2015, our total net revenue grew to $892.8 million, up 49% from the nine months ended September 30, 2014. In 
2014, our total net revenue grew to $850.2 million, up 54% from the prior year. For the nine months ended September 30. 2015. 
our Adjusted Revenue grew to $317.6 million, up 63% from the nine months ended September 30, 2014. In 2014, our Adjusted 
Revenue grew to $276.3 million, up 73% from the prior year. We intend to continue to make investments that will serve sellers and 
buyers over the long term even if a return on these investments is not realized in the short term. For the nine months ended 
September 30. 2015 and September 30, 2014, we generated a net loss of $131.5 million and $117.0 million, respectively. In 2014 
and 2013. we generated a net loss of $154.1 million and $104.5 million, respectively. 
Factors Affecting Our Operating Performance 
Adoption of our payments and POS services. 
Our payments services are the foundation of our relationship with our sellers. 
We generate revenue with every card payment that our sellers accept. We will continue to drive adoption of our payments services 
by scaling our solutions to meet the needs of sellers of all types and sizes. We believe we can do this by further developing our 
products and services, using custom pricing to attract larger sellers, and enhancing relationships with larger sellers through our 
direct sales and account management teams. 
We seek to continue to drive adoption of our payments and POS services, as they represent one important way sellers can 
gain familiarity with our full range of products, features, and services. The insights generated by our payments services enable 
many new products and services, such as analytics that show our sellers how their businesses are performing, helping them 
increase sales and thereby generating incremental revenue for us. As a result, the level of ongoing seller adoption of our payments 
and POS services will affect our growth.
