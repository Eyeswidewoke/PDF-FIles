PRIVILEGED - ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT/DELIBERATIVE PROCESS 
CONFIDENTIAL - SUBJECT TO FED. R. CRIM. P. 6(e) 
Around the late 1990s, Epstein began using testosterone patches, which made him more 
aggressive. Their relationship began to deteriorate, and Maxwell stopped sleeping in the same 
room as Epstein. In or around 1999 or 2000, Maxwell stopped having sex with Epstein. At that 
time, Epstein was dating a woman named-.
513 In or around 
Maxwell ended her 
romantic relationship with Epstein and began dating other men. Around the same time, Maxwell 
met 
in Hawaii and ended up hiring her to be Maxwell's personal assistant to 
replace 
Shortly after 
was hired, though, Epstein made clear that 
would be 
his assistant instead. Maxwell trained 
regarding how to manage Epstein's houses, and 
eventually 
took over Maxwell's responsibilities. 
Between about 2001 and 2003, Maxwell continued travelling with Epstein, even though 
they fought frequently, because Epstein wanted her to continue managing his properties. It was 
during this period that Maxwell met 
Maxwell does not recall meeting 
and she primarily recalls speaking with Leslie Groff on the phone. 
In 2003, Maxwell began a long-term relationship with Ted Wight, and she remained in a 
committed relationship with him until 2010. As a result of that relationship, Maxwell spent less 
and less time with Epstein. She was not present in 2005 when the Palm Beach Police 
Department searched Epstein's Palm Beach residence, and she was not contacted or interviewed 
during that investigation. Maxwell understood that Epstein pled guilty to having sex with an 
"underage prostitute," and she did not visit him in jail. 
Throughout their relationship, Epstein asked Maxwell to connect him with massage 
therapists, but she insists that she only hired adults for that role. She recalled Epstein getting one 
massage per day, and she believed that the massages were not sexual in nature. Maxwell did 
engage in sex acts with Epstein and other adult women, but she denies ever doing so with 
minors. Maxwell categorically denies any involvement in recruiting minors for sex with Epstein. 
Maxwell's attorneys claimed that she has a medical condition making some of the public 
allegations regarding certain sex acts involving Maxwell physically impossible. They did not 
provide any additional details regarding the nature of the condition or which acts it impacted. 
They added that she could be intimate with Epstein, but not every day because of this condition. 
At the conclusion of the proffer, Maxwell's attorneys walked through the public 
allegations against their client and explained their views of why the individuals making those 
claims were not credible. In doing so, they emphasized that Maxwell had not invoked her Fifth 
Amendment privilege against self-incrimination when she was deposed as a part of 
lawsuit.59 Although they discussed several witnesses during this portion of the 
ss The FBI has not yet identified this individual. 
" We have reviewed the transcripts of Maxwell's two-part deposition in 2016, which was taken 
in connection with 
defamation suit against Maxwell. During the deposition, 
Maxwell admitted to being in a romantic relationship with Epstein from the early 1990s through
