with Lewie. In 2006 we invested $4 million to purchase one-third of Apes Hill Club, 
Barbados. 
South Padre Island proved a success in that we sold approximately 150 houses in 2005, 200 
in 2006, 170 in 2007, and in each of these years had cash flow of $3 million to $5 million net 
to the parent. We have developed approximately half of the 2,000 acres, have 1,000 homes 
built, and approximately 1,200 left to be built. After Lloyd Bentsen's death, we bought from 
his estate, at a very attractive price, his interest, and it is now owned 100% by Landmark. 
South Padre Island Development is on the right side of history in that it offers good value, in 
warm weather. on the water for middle-class pre-retirement, retirement buyers, however, 
with the housing crisis we only sold 21 houses in 2008 and are doing only slightly better than 
that in 2009. Therefore, the cash flow is not coming from South Padre to Landmark, but 
cash is going from Landmark to South Padre. Recently there was some sign of optimism, but 
in the short run, this may be a false spring. In the long run, I am confident that offering 
homes in a good golf course community from $135,000 up will be in the heart of the baby 
boomers retirement plan. 
Apes Hill Club is 470 acres that overlooks both the west coast of the Caribbean and the east 
cost of the Atlantic. It has been the most successful and highest quality development I have 
ever been associated with. While at the present time, with the pound low against the dollar 
and the financial crisis in England and Ireland at its zenith, our sales are slow, last year Apes 
Hill Club made $33 million net profit. However, because the cash flow was needed for 
continued development in Apes Hill, none of the money was brought back to Landmark. 
Obviously, if we have a completely integrated management staff and presently no income 
from our two major developments, we have a cash flow problem. A year ago I believed that 
recession was on us, things would be bad, and Landmark would be (if I could keep the team 
together) in an ideal position to take advantage of the greatest financial crisis in my lifetime. 
Therefore, I made the decision not to cut management back to what was necessary for 
Barbados and South Padre, but to use it to look for new opportunities and to be prepared to 
become a major player when the market foreclosed on what I knew would be billions of 
dollars of distressed assets. 
This year we have entered into a contract for the development of a distressed golf project in 
St. Lucia. We have reached agreement with the government of St. Kitts to start up, again, a 
resort project on the west coast of St. Kitts that had been abandoned because of 
mismanagement and corruption, and we are at the contact stage of entering into agreement 
on a 5,000 acre development in North Carolina where the owners need management and they 
need the ability to attract some money on a last-in, first-out basis, and we arc closely 
following a half dozen other distressed properties. 
In order to meet our negative cash requirements, we have exhausted our cash reserve, we 
have scrambled where possible, and I have borrowed over $1 million personally and put it 
into the company. A few months ago, a government bank for the eastern Caribbean, 
originally started by the World Bank, agreed to loan Landmark $5 million. The security for 
the loan would be the 100% of the St. Lucia company that owns one-third of Apes Hill Club 
in Barbados. That one-third interest is worth somewhere between $20 million and $50
