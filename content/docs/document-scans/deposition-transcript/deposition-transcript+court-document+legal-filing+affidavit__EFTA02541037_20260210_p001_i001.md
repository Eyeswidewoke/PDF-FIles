Re: Hello 
we're on the same team. M. 
testimony was that discussions with lovers , often include emb=llishments. and not 
indicative of non professionalism. =C2 I believe he said nothing more than it referenced " andys offic=". . 
says 
andy was there. how man= other people were there ? were 
and-. 
off in the c=rner talking to each other . 
was mccabe on the phone? =AO you know that taking emails alone is not meaningful. . =AO isnt it a but much to say 
that prosecutors that have strong opin=ons . should be looked out with skepticism? who doesnt have b=as. . 
had many neg hillary opinions . . - =michael cohen. michael flynn.. are not fictions created by mu=ller ? how are you 
On Wed, Jul 4, 2018 at 8:31 AM, <=pan direltr"><Gotti was an anomaly beca=se of his personality (some agents loved 
him and some hated him); but I ge= your point. Couple of things: <mailto
1. This the investigation of the President. It is only as =ood as public confidence in it can be (subtracting the conspiracy 
theorist= on both sides). We just can't have someone with this kind of po=itical bias as a lead investigator. But more 
importantly, he was not=alone. He was just stupid enough to show it in office emails. =e don't yet know what his 
private emails showed. =, 
however= says that he met with McCabe - the number 2 guy in the FBI - and in his orfice 
discussed how best to stop Trump from becoming President. That =ust cannot be tolerated. Plus, if I find any evidence 
of personal or=other extraneous animus in any case by any agent or prosecutor, I view it =s an open invitation for cross 
examination and any other exploitation poss=ble as it cannot be an accepted part of the process. 
2. In this whole matter, I am most disturbed by the composition =f the Mueller team and it seems to me that if we are 
to learn anything fro= the IG's report it is the importance of having an investigation condu=ted above-board without 
personal and political baggage. Mueller had = whole universe of lawyers from around the country to choose from to 
make =p his team. He purposefully chose a murderer's row of the worst.=C2 I can go one by one; but I will spare you. 
Here are a couple o= examples: 
A. 
was known in the EDNY as "The Pa=hological Liar" after the SNL character. He literally would 
wit=hold exculpatory evidence throughout the case and then one day when defens= counsel went to the bathroom or 
lunch, stick the documents under others or his table and tell the judge the lawyer had it all along. I have be=n brought 
into a case in which he lied from start to finish - and now his =ats have come to me to admit their role in it - to get 
murder convictions =n two cases. He has been cited by judges for his misconduct and he r=nined both Arthur Anderson 
and Enron through his work, all of which was re=ected by the higher courts. He also is a Trump hater and Clinton 
syc=phant. Mueller know 
conduct up close and personal.=C2 He chose 
for his chief counsel 
at the FBI years ago. 
B. 
hand-picked by Mueller from Mueller's own f=rm, was actually Clinton's lawyer in the email 
investigation. No= how does that look. She also is a bully and thinks she is a real to=gh guy and I don't want that kind of 
character around. I also hare an ineffective assistance of counsel case against her for a client in a =100 million earnings 
management fraud case in which she was way over her h=ad. 
C. 
was another bully who replaced 
the E=NY. He withheld evidence terribly in his cases, 
regularly threatenethothers, and accused a defendant of putting out a contract on him when he k=ew it was a
