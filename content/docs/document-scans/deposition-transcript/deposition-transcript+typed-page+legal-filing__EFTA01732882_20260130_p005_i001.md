He was interim Minister of Oil in Ira= in April—May 2005 and December 2005 —January 2006 and Deruty Prime Minister 
from May 2005 to May 2006. Once the white knight =or the Bush/Cheney Administration's efforts to replace Saddam 
Huss=in, Ahmed Abdel Hadi Chalabi who died on November 3, 2015 failed to win a =eat in parliament in the December 
2005 elections, and when the new Iraqi c=binet was announced in May 2006, he was not given a post. Once dubbe= the 
"George Washington of Iraq" by American neoconservat=ve supporters, he later fell out of favor and came under 
investigation by =everal U.S. government sources. Chalabi was the son of a prominent S=i'a family, one of the wealthy 
power elite of Baghdad, where he was bo=n. Chalabi left Iraq with his family in 1956[vand spent most of his life i= the 
United States and the United Kingdom.[ 
Chalabi was a controversial figure, especially in the Unite= States, for many reasons. In the lead-up to the 2003 invasion 
of Ir=q, the Iraqi National Congress (INC), with the assistance of lobbying powerhouse BKSH & Associates, provided a 
major portion of the information o= which U.S. Intelligence based its condemnation of the Iraqi President Sad=am 
Hussein, including reports of weapons of mass destruction and alleged t=es to al-Qaeda. Most, if not all, of this 
information has turned out=to be false and Chalabi has been called a fabricator. That, combined with =he fact that 
Chalabi subsequently boasted, in an interview with the Britis= Sunday Telegraph, about the impact that their alleged 
falsifications had =n American policy, led to a falling out between him and the U.S. governmen=. Furthermore, Chalabi 
was found guilty in the Petra banking scandal in Jordan. In January 2012, a French intelligence official stated that they 
beli=ved Chalabi to be an Iranian agent. 
Ahmad Chalabi sp=nt more than a decade working for the overthrow of Saddam Hussein, prides =imself on his 
understanding of the United States and its history. 40=9CI know quite a lot about it," he told an American reporte= in his 
Baghdad office in the new headquarters of the Iraqi National Congr=ss, the exile opposition group that Chalabi helped 
found in 1992. As=a young man, he said, he spent several years in America, earning an underg=aduate and a master's 
degree in mathematics from M.I.T., and a Ph.=. in mathematics from the University of Chicago. 
Cha=abi began studying the uses of power in American politics, and the subject=developed into a lifelong interest. One 
episode in American history partic=larly fascinated him, he said. "I followed very closely h=w Roosevelt, who abhorred 
the Nazis, at a time when isolationist sentiment=was paramount in the United States, managed adroitly to persuade the 
Ameri=an people to go to war. I studied it with a great deal of respect; w= learned a lot from it. The Lend-Lease 
program committed Roosevelt t= enter on Britain's side — so we had the Iraq Liberation A=t, which committed the 
American people for the liberation against Saddam.rE2*. The act, which Congress passed in 1998, made="regime 
change" in Iraq an official priority=of the U.S. government; Chalabi had lobbied tirelessly for the legislation= 
In 1977, he founded the Petra Bank in Jordan. =In May 1989, the Governor of the Central Bank of Jordan, Mohammed 
Said Nab=lsi, issued a decree ordering all banks in the country to deposit 35% of t=eir reserves with the Central Bank. 
Petra Bank was the only bank tha= was unable to meet this requirement. An investigation was launched =hich led to 
accusations of embezzlement and false accounting. The ba=k failed, causing a $350 million bail-out by the Central Bank. 
4)=A0Chalabi fled the country before the authorities could react. Chalabi was=convicted and sentenced in absentia for 
bank fraud by a Jordanian military=tribunal.
