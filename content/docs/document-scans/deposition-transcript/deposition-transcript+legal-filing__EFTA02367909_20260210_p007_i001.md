That, howev=r, didn't stop USAID from literally doubling down on the program in 2009, increasing its budget to $373 
million. SIGAR=E244ks conclusion: scattered, small successes but no wins on any overarching goals. Ashley Jackson, a 
longtime non-governmental organization worker, was blunter. USAID, she said, &=uot;would have been better off 
setting the money on fire." 
The chapter: Consequence-Free Zone: No One Is Ever Blamed For Failure Link — obviou=ly when there is no 
consequence of failure don't expect success. =As an example that site an unfinished courthouse in North of Kabul, which 
is a shell of rebar and cracking concre=e. So instead of being the centerpiece for Afghan national security trials, a 
prominent place to prosecute suspected insurgents, judges preside over a makeshift courtroom in a nearby building =ith 
fold-out tables. 
The Afghan contractor hired to build the courthous= had only been in business for about six months and there was very 
little documentati=n on why his company was chosen to do the work, Harmon said. The contra=tor hired a 
subcontractor that military commanders knew actively supported the Taliban. But since th=se commanders failed to 
share this information throughout the organization, the subcontractor had access =o a U.S. military-controlled area for 
two days — a serious security lap=e, according to a SIGAR report. With just basic foundation work done on the justice 
center, the contractor disappeared, tak=ng almost $400,000 of U.S. taxpayers' money with him. The military 
subsequently abandoned the project. The consequences for those mismanaging this misbegotten project? Nothing. 
Th= final chapter: Success or Failure: =e Spent $8 billion and There's Now More Heroin Than Ever — sums up o=r success 
in Afghanistan. Today Afghanistan is the king of heroin. It sits on a narco throne as "the global leader in illicit opium 
cultivation and produ=tion," according to SIGAR. After a 13-year effort by the U.S.to <http://U.S.to> end Af=hanistan's 
drug trade, it is now the world leader in heroin production. Plans to promote alternative farming and eradicate poppy 
fields have only led to more poppie= planted. Law enforcement training has been insufficient. About $109 million was 
spent on substance abuse treatmen= programs and education.

And that $8.4 billion the U.S. spent to end =ts reign over the last 13 years appears to have only enhanced its standing. 
The Pentagon, USA=D and the State Department had a grand plan to eradicate poppy fields, develo= Afghan law 
enforcement and promote alternative farming livelihoods. Yet the drug trade still "poisons the Afghan financial sector 
and undermines t=e Afghan state's legitimacy by stoking corruption, sustaining crimina= networks, and providing 
significant financial support to the Taliban and other insurg=nt groups," SIGAR found.

The drug trade feeds corruption. Deali=g with both are intrinsically tied to reconstruction success, which is why the 
failure to h=ve an effective strategy. When a farmer grows poppy, he pays off the local officials, and the money goes up 
the cha=n and leads to corruption of entire institutions. Part of the program was to demonstrate to the Afghans that was 
why they shouldn't let the drug=trade go on. Didn't we learn from the disastrous "War On Drugs" here in America and 
Nancy Reagan's laugha=le "Just Say No" drug campaign? Obviously not. And this is indicative to why our hold strategy 
under both Presidents Bush and Obama has failed. We are tryi=g to force a square peg through a round hole and we
