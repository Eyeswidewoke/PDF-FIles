Prince Andrew's friend, Ghislaine Maxwell, some underage girls and a very disturbing story I t... Page 10 of 17 
Details of the investigation have gripped all sections of American society. 
Police arranged for dustbin men to set aside Epstein's bags for a series of "trash pulls". Searches of the Palm 
Beach mansion found the staircase lined with photos of naked girls. There were hidden cameras and pictures of 
teenage girls on a computer. 
The charge against him is serious. It is understood that without a plea bargain, he would be facing sentences of 
ten to 15 years. 
told The Mail on Sunday how Epstein paid her college fees, made the down payment on her house, and 
paid for her to train as a hairdresser and as a masseuse. Eventually she gave in to his demands and the massages 
became more sexual in nature. 
was, of course, a consenting adult and, although questioned by the Florida police, insists that she had 
no knowledge of what took place with other girls. 
As she puts it: "All the stuff that was going on with the massages, no one ever talked about it. You wouldn't 
know coming to the house. The police reports paint a picture that it was a big orgy all the time, but it wasn't." 
has faced no charges and played no part in the prosecution of Epstein. She says the allegations against 
Epstein came as a surprise to her. 
"When all the stories started coming out and the police questioned me whether or not I had known about any 
involvement with underaged girls, I said definitely not, I was never aware of that. I gave him the benefit of the 
doubt. 
"Jeffrey asked me if anybody had asked me questions about it, and I said yes. I asked Jeffrey if it was true he 
had had sex with underage girls. He said, 'Yes, but I didn't know about their age. They lied about it'." 
But what of Ghislaine Maxwell, the woman who introduced 
to Epstein? 
"Ghislaine was quite motherly," says M. 
"She called all us kids, 'my children'. She was someone I very much respected and wanted to learn from. She 
carried herself in a special way. She is a very big personality. Ghislaine was very interesting." 
She was also — and 
was in no doubt about this — at the heart of Epstein's life. 
There is no suggestion that Ghislaine was aware that some of the girls were underage, or aware of Jeffrey's 
sexual requests. 
last saw Ghislaine in January 2006. 
Inevitably, as time went on, the glamour of Epstein's world started to fade for M. 
She says: "There wasn't an epiphany moment. I just began to feel deceived, as if I were part of a master plan I 
didn't know about. 
"It was when Jeffrey became more aggressive with me, trying to pressure me to do sexual things to him, that 
things turned sour. 
"He offered me money. I got $200 for a massage, and he gave me an extra $100 to do other things.
