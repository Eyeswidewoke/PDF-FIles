On August 12, 2019, LIEUTENAN
, (Lt. =), 
was interviewed at 290 Broadway New 
York, NY. Present at the interview were FBI Special Agent Hannah Kuhrt, FBI Special Agent 
IIIIMPOffice of the Inspector General Special Agent 
and Assistant United States 
Attorney (AUSA) 
After being advised of the identity of the interviewing Agents and 
AUSA and the nature of the interview, Lt. 
provided the following information: 
Lt. 
has worked at MCC for 17 years. =was promoted to Lieutenant in 2014 or 2015. 
works approximately 16 hours a day, 6 days a week. As part of his operational duties, 
is 
responsible for running the building, supervising core staff, and handling situations that come up with 
the inmates. 
The hierarchy within MCC is as follows: Warden, Associate Warden, Captain and Lieutenant. There are 
GS-11 Lieutenants and GS-9 Lieutenants. GS-11 Lieutenants supervise GS-9 Lieutenants. Lt.= is a GS-
11 Lieutenant. Corrections Officers (CO) are below GS-9 Lieutenants. 
The Special Housing Unit (SHU) has its own lieutenant. The SHU lieutenant is responsible for handling 
any problems that arise within SHU to include issues with staff as well as inmates. If there are no 
problems, the SHU lieutenant does not have to check in all the time. However, the SHU lieutenant must 
sign in to the SHU signature log at some point during his or her shift. 
MCC staff are required to fill out 30 minute check in sheets. The time of the check and the signature of 
the CO who conducted the check are documented on the check in sheet. The times are not always 
exactly 30 minutes apart to prevent inmates from learning a pattern of when the CO will come by. 
COs must also conduct and official count which is different from the 30 minute check in. The official 
count is conducted at l0pm, 12am, 3am, and Sam. A signed count sheet certifies that rounds were 
made and each inmate was in his cell at that time. On weekend days, there is a 10am count where 
inmates are required to stand up in their cells during the count. During the week, the 10pm count 
requires COs to ensure the inmate moves. A Lieutenant has to be present for at least one of the 12am, 
3am or Sam counts. 
Both the check in sheets and the count sheets are kept for 30 days in a binder. An El sheet is kept in the 
control center and has the inmates count as well as each inmate's physical location. The El sheet must 
match the count sheet. The CO who conducts the count must call in to the control center to report the 
number and a Lieutenant can only sign off on the count sheet when the number on the count sheet 
matches the number on the El sheet. 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN (EPSTEIN, previously identified) was housed in SHU. EPSTEIN met with his lawyers 
everyday between 8am and 8pm on the third floor of MCC. 
was not present when EPSTEIN was first placed on suicide watch on July 23, 2019. 
knew 
EPSTEIN was on suicide watch because EPSTEIN was wearing a smock and only inmates who are on 
suicide watch wear smocks. 
was also not present when the decision to remove EPSTEIN from 
suicide watch was made. 
According to policy, when an inmate in taken off of suicide watch he is placed on psychological 
observation for a period of time before he can be placed back in either SHU or in the general population. 
Regardless of whether or not an inmate is on suicide watch or under psychological evaluation
