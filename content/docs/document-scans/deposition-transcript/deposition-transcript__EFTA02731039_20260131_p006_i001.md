Epstein asked Victim-2 to bring other girls for massages, which she did. Initially, 
Epstein simply asked her to "bring a friend" and told her he would pay her to bring other girls. 
Later, after a few experiences of Victim-2 bringing victims who balked at the sexual nature of the 
massages, Epstein told her not to bring girls unless they knew what to expect. Victim-2 understood 
this to mean she should warn girls to expect they would need to take off their clothes, and that 
Epstein would touch them and masturbate. She then conveyed as much in recruiting victims. 
Victim-2 estimates she recruited approximately 20 to 30 girls for Epstein, all of whom 
were approximately 15 to 20 years old. Victim-2 believes that most of the girls she brought were 
minors. This continued for approximately two to three years. Although Epstein did not expressly 
tell Victim-2 to bring minors, the girls she knew—and thus the girls she could recruit—were all 
minors at the time. Epstein would occasionally indicate to Victim-2 which girls he liked and which 
girls he disliked, and she noticed he preferred the younger minors she brought, and that he preferred 
petite blonde girls. Victim-2 usually coordinated these appointments with 
Victim-2 
specifically recalls that 
would occasionally call Victim-2 and say that she was in New York, 
that Epstein would be arriving in Florida soon, and that she wanted to know if Victim-2 could 
"work" when he arrived. 
When Victim-2 first met Epstein, she told him she was 18 because her friend had told 
her to lie about her age. In truth, she was approximately 14 or 15 at the time, and was wearing 
braces, and recalls that it would have been obvious that she was very young. Initially, Victim-2 
similarly told other girls she brought to Epstein to say they were older because her friend had given 
her that instruction. Over time, however, based on her observations of the girls that Epstein seemed 
to prefer—and the sheer number of minors she brought to the house without issue—Victim-2 came 
to believe that Epstein wanted younger girls, and did not care if the girls told him their true ages. 
For this reason, Victim-2 stopped telling the girls she recruited to lie about their ages. She stated 
that the girls she recruited looked very young, and she believes it would have been obvious to 
anyone that they were underage. 
When the Florida investigations became public, after Victim-2 had stopped visiting 
Epstein, she recalls having a phone conversation with 
in which 
stated, in sum and 
substance, that Victim-2 would be taken care of if she didn't say anything. 
Corroboration of Victim-2 
The full name and phone number of Victim-2 appear on message pads recovered from 
Epstein's house during a search conducted as part of the prior investigations. The messages appear 
to refer to scheduling appointments and recruiting other girls, e.g.: "She has a female friend for 
you, please call back as soon as possible." These messages strongly corroborate that Victim-2 
worked as a recruiter for Epstein. Additionally, the message pads appear to include messages with 
names of individuals Victim-2 has identified as other victims, and who were interviewed during 
the previous investigation (and who confirmed at the time that they were victimized in a matter 
consistent with the pattern of conduct victims have described in our investigation). Although we 
have not yet been able to interview those victims, we intend to approach them after charging. 
Contemporaneous phone records also reflect numerous phone calls between Victim-2 
and 
corroborating Victim-2's account that 
was her primary contact for scheduling 
massagesor Epstein.
