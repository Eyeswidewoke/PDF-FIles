Dear Sir/Madame: 
January 22, 2020 
I am a Forensic Intelligence Analyst and a congressional consultant. I am also a paralegal 
with extensive experience regarding informant practices related to the FBI and their handling of 
taxpayer-funded, Top Echelon informants. I've been in documentaries, national and international 
newspapers, and many television news appearances discussing informants who commit serious 
crimes while working under FBI auspices. Additionally, I was an independent consultant and lead 
talent on the Spike documentary, "Gone — The Forgotten Women of Ohio." That series, submitted 
for a Peabody award, ran for eight episodes about, in part, murdered and missing women and 
informants; corruption; and human and drug trafficking. These matters are all addressed in this 
request. 
This request pertains to Jeffery Epstein, born January 20, 1953 in Brooklyn, New York, 
and deceased August 10.2019 in the federal Metropolitan Correctional Center New York. A copy 
of his obituary is attached to this letter. Under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) (5 U.S.C. 
§ 552), and President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Act of 1992, (44 U.S.C. §2 I 07), I 
request that the Federal Bureau of Investigation produce copies of any informant files, records or 
materials on or pertaining to Jeffrey Epstein, including but not limited to any informant file or Top 
Echelon (TE) informant file, Confidential Human Source (CHS) Reporting documents, and any 
Federal Central Inmate Monitoring System (CIMS) records wherever they may be located or filed 
and in whatever form or format they may be maintained. 
I further request photographic copies of all photographs of Mr. Epstein. I'd like to expand 
the photos, images or aerial images or any metadata pertaining thereto. With respect to electronic 
surveillance materials, please provide not only the transcripts, logs, and other written materials 
pertaining thereto, but also any audio or videotapes in the format in which they were recorded. 
Please include copies of any agreements with Epstein, or draft copy, or proffer agreement 
with Epstein and the FBI. 
Include in this request all correspondence, memoranda, documents, reports, records, 
statements, audits, lists of names, applications, diskettes, flash drives, letters, expense logs, and 
receipts, calendar or diary logs, facsimile logs, flight logs, telephone records, call sheets, tape 
recordings, video/movie recordings, notes, ticklers, numbered and lettered subfiles, I A envelopes, 
enclosures behind files.(EBE's), file covers. bulky exhibits ('Bulkier'), control files, and 'JUNE' 
or 'JUNE MAIL' files or records, examinations, opinions, folders. files, books, manuals, 
magazines, main discs, any mini storage files and records including and relating to mini storage 
989-9779, and any records in file number storage unit files and records, archival storage unit files 
and records, pamphlets, fonns, closed or transferred subfiles, jottings, telephone messages, 
message slips, post it notes or sticky's, drawings, charts, photographs, electronic mail, and other
