A couple of my favourites are as follows: 
Isabel calls me to say she is having trouble with her Portuguese domestics and as I "have a way with staff' 
would I mind dropping in to see them, which I do a couple of days later. 
I forget their names, but lets call them Jose and Pauline. I ask Jose what the matter is. He replies and I quote as 
near verbatim as i can recall; 
"Sir, its not that I mind Miss Isabel screaming at me, its not that I mind Miss Isabel screaming at me in front of 
my wife, its not that I mind Mrs Isabel slapping me, its not that I mind her slapping me in from of my wife, its just 
that I cannot accept being slapped in the street" !!! 
Another good one was when I took Isabel to Bali, Indonesia 15 yrs ago. Whilst there she did a lot of shopping of 
local artifacts and hand crafts, including ordering a large bolt of fabric specially woven to her instructions. She 
asked Ugo Gerasati, the Brazilian socialite who had a fabricshop out there at the time specialising in Balinese 
batiquesetc, how he proposed sending this to her once completed, as she had no intention whatsoever of being 
paying outrageous postage and packing charges. He told her that he had an excellent solution, which would 
involve no costs at all. He would ask the next English customer who happened to be in the shop when the fabric 
was ready, if they would mind taking it with them back to London. Quite a favour to ask of anyone especially 
when this bolt was the size of a large packing case. 
In any event the late Mary Howard (Lord Patrick Howard's charming wife) dropped by a few weeks later to visit 
Ugo and was tasked with taking this huge package to London which she readily agreed to do. 
On arrival in London, the first thing she did was to call Isabel whom she had never met. She did this promptly at 
9:00Am in the moming, not a good time for Isabel who is a night owl and generally only goes to sleep around 6 
and then wakes around lunchtime. The result of this call, which of course woke Isabel, was for her to scream at 
Mary "Do you know what time this is? Do you think this is an office?" To which Mary replied, somewhat startled 
at the hostility of this reaction, " I was calling to let you know I have brought your fabric back from Bar. Isabel, 
not remotely mollified, cursed her for waking her up and added as an aside "Well drop it off this afternoon at 
4:00pm" and then slammed down the phone without so much as good bye. 
Mary, somewhat aghast b this behaviour, generous to the extreme, put it down to a bad night and that 
aftemoon turned up at 
with the huge parcel. She rang the door and waited and waited and 
waited and finally Isabel opened the door on the chain and asked who she was. "I am Mary Howard with your 
fabric from Bar. "Oh" snaps Isabel "You are that wretched woman who woke my so inconsiderately this 
morning" with that she opens the door, grabs the package and the slams it shut in Mary's face. 
Mary now finally cracks and bursts into tears on Isabel's doostep and calls her best friend Lynn Guinness to tell 
her what has happened. Lynn, quite rightly outraged by this behaviour, calls me and tells me to speak to Isabel 
immediatly. 
By the time I get the message and call Isabel, its her "good time of day" around 6:30pm. I call her and she 
answers in a very friendly way and so I ask her if the name Mary Howard rings a bell. "Should it?" she replies 
quick as a flash. "Yes" I say "It bloody well shouldm since she had at great inconvenience hauled a large 
package half way around the world only to be yelled at for her trouble". Isabel thought for a second before 
wearliy replying "Well she's lead a sheltered life" and that was that. I lift the term rank ingratitude onto a different 
plane altogether.
