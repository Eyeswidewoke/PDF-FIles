2. In this whole matter, I am most disturbed by the composition =f the Mueller team and it seems to me that if 
we are to learn anything fro= the IG's report it is the importance of having an investigation conducted=above-board 
without personal and political baggage. Mueller had a wh=le universe of lawyers from around the country to choose 
from to make up h=s team. He purposefully chose a murderer's row of the worst. l=can go one by one; but I will spare 
you. Here are a couple of exampl=s: 
A. Andrew Weissmann was known in the EDNY as "The Patholo=ical Liar" after the SNL character. He literally 
would withhold excu=patory evidence throughout the case and then one day when defense counsel =ent to the 
bathroom or lunch, stick the documents under others on his tabl= and tell the judge the lawyer had it all along. I have 
been brought=into a case in which he lied from start to finish - and now his rats have =ome to me to admit their role in it 
- to get murder convictions in two cas=s. He has been cited by judges for his misconduct and he runined bot= Arthur 
Anderson and Enron through his work, all of which was rejected by =he higher courts. He also is a Trump hater and 
Clinton sycophant.&nb=p; Mueller knows Weissmann's conduct up close and personal. He chose=Weissmann for his 
chief counsel at the FBI years ago. 
B. Jeannie Rhee, hand-picked by Mueller from Mueller's own firm,=was actually Clinton's lawyer in the email 
investigation. Now how do=s that look. She also is a bully and thinks she is a real tough guy =nd I don't want that kind 
of character around. I also have an ineffe=tive assistance of counsel case against her for a client in a $100 
million=earnings management fraud case in which she was way over her head. 
C. Greg Andres was another bully who replaced Weissmann in the E=NY. He withheld evidence terribly in his 
cases, regularly threatened=others, and accused a defendant of putting out a contract on him when he k=ew it was a 
completely bogus claim, but gave him the publicity he craved.&=bsp; He is 100% in the pro-Clinton, anti-Trump camp. 
President Obama=gave his wife a federal judgeship on the SDNY 
and on and on. 
I don't personally believe Russia affected the election at all; but I =ertainly am not qualified to say. I do know 
that we have meddled in =ther countries' elections as a matter of policy forever. But the bot=om line is, if there is to be 
an investigation, just play it straight up.&=bsp; I am friends for a long time with the IG. If they had picked hi= to head up 
the team, I would not be a weekly guest on Hannity tv and radi= (I never would have been asked), as I know he would 
pick a team of honest=folks from across the spectrum.
