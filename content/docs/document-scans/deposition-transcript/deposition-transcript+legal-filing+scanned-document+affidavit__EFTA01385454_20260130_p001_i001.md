Ryerson Holding Corp. (RYI): Strengthening End Markets, 
Higher Metals Prices, Solid Current Yield: BUY 
On Dec 15, 2017 we initiated on Ryerson Holding Corp's MVO 11.0% senior 
secured notes due 20221112 price, 58% Y7VV, 408 OAS) with a Buy rating. We 
highlight selections from our initiation in the summary below. 
Executive Summary 
Initially founded more than 175 years ago, Ryerson Holding Corporation (RYI) 
is a leading metals service center predominantly operating in North America 
and China. For the LTM period ended September 2017 RYI generated adjusted 
EBITDA (excluding the impact of LIFO accounting) of $180mn on revenue of 
$3.236bn. As of 3O17, RYI had cash of S74mn and debt of $1.042bn equating 
to 5.4x net and 5.8x total leverage in a business whose equity trades at -7.2x. 
Recent Operating Performance 
Profitability was hindered in 3O17 by deflationary chrome and nickel costs that 
in turn deflated EBITDA by approximately $9.0mn. However, with renewed 
pricing strength in chrome and nickel driving higher stainless steel prices, we 
believe this headwind is largely behind RYI. With Chinese steel production 
slowing temporarily despite a robust macroeconomic demand backdrop in 
China, imports of steel products into the U.S. are on the decline and domestic 
manufacturers are having success raising prices for their products to cover any 
recent raw material inflation. We believe this is a theme that will play out over 
the course of 4Q17 and view RYI as one of the chief beneficiaries of the 
positive momentum. While net leverage is currently high at 5.4x, RYI's number 
one priority is deleveraging its capital structure through FCF generation and 
debt reduction before the first call date of its 11.0% secured notes due 2022.w 
fig?-COMInendatien 
RYI's absolute top priority is to refinance the 11.0% senior secured notes due 
2022. At first glance from a YIW perspective the 11.0% notes yield 5.8% at a 
dollar price of 112.000% for a Caa1/B credit versus the DB HY commodities 
index's 5.8% YNV. However, the 11.0% notes are not callable until May 2019 
at 105.500%, -1.5 years from today, which makes them more interesting 
owing to our belief that RYI may elect to redeem them earlier than the first call 
date since the expensive 11.0% notes now trade -520bps inside their coupon. 
Hence, we like the base-case of generating returns in line with the average HY 
Commodity index with the potential upside for mid-to-high-single digit returns. 
In the meantime, investors would be situated in a credit with an improving end 
market outlook reaping a generous current yield of 9.8% with a management 
team focused on deleveraging the capital structure. Therefore we are initiating 
on RYI's 11.0% senior secured notes due 2022 with a BUY rating. 
Risks 
Downside risks include raw material inflation compressing margins, an excess 
supply of foreign steel and aluminum imports being dumped in the U.S. 
leading to distressed levels of steel and aluminum pricing, market share losses, 
an inability to refinance the 11.0% secured notes, sudden price movements 
that make it difficult for RYI to pass along to its customers, unfavorable tax 
and regulatory changes that pressure RYI's business and the plausibility of a 
recession, which would pressure many of RYI's cyclical end markets.
