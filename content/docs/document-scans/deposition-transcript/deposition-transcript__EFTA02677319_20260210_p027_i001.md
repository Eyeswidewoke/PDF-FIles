This course is a survey of 'occupied' spaces in New York City beginning in early 20th Century to the

1950s. from the Stonewall Riot of 1969 to the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s. from Hip Hop and Fort 
Greene in the 1990s to the Occupy movement of recent times, the marginal and disenfranchised 
have occupied derelict or abandoned neighborhoods in New York City. Students look at the vibrant 
art and culture the communities in these neighborhoods produced and how, in turn, their art and 
culture are absorbed into the fabric and identity of New York City through gentrification and 
mimicry.

Credits: 2 
CRN 7752 Sec H 
Altruism, charity, human service, philanthropy. social entrepreneurship... all are terms that, while 
they may have different connotations, denote helping others as an institution. This becomes a 
complex idea when the surface is scratched. and there is no better laboratory than NYC to explore 
critical questions like: is -helping' a profession, an industry, or a calling? Why might voluntarism 
yield social capital differently from paid helping work? Where do social service and social change 
intersect and divide? Through readings, speakers, and trips. students will relate their own critical 
questions to their experiences, interests, and passions around helping others and being 
changemakers.

2902 Paris: Dream City/ Real City 
Faculty: 
Credits: 4 
CRN 7494 Sec A 
In this course we begin with the American Dream of Paris. Through literature. film and philosophy 
we look at how the American dream gives way to our experience of Paris as areal' cityUa complex 
and alien urban landscape. Exiles and foreigners often exist on the surface of life. Literature. film 
and philosophy can offer us. as strangers, small windows into the Complexities of French culture. 
Each Is only a small window, but by taking a variety of perspectives. we can tap Into some of the 
deeper currents of French life and thought. We examine some key French philosophical texts, 
taking them out of the realm of academic theory, and placing them in their original cultural 
context, to see what kind of window onto French culture they provide. We also link these 
philosophical texts to their literary and filmic counterparts, to see how the French imagine 
themselves through these art forms. We view a number of classic and contemporary French films. 
and look at what the French call -The 7th an,' cinema, as both a window onto daily life In French 
culture. and cinema as a premier French cultural export: the image they present to the world. We 
respond to the readings with a series of essays. To 'essay in French means to go forth, to try, to 
make an attempt. and the essay, as exemplified by Montaigne, is a literary form of discovery, an 
attempt without a destination. Through the essays, we also question our American identity in 
relation to our discovery of French culture. Auteurs and authors include Woody Allen. Gertrude 
Stein, James Baldwin. Louis Mane. Francome Own, Jacques Deride. Blaise Pascal and Michael 
Haneke.
