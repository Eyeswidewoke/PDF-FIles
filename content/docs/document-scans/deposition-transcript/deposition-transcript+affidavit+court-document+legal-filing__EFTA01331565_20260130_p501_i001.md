security interest of this Mortgage. Upon full compliance by the Grantor with the provisions of 
this subsection 4.11, the Mortgagee will deliver to the Grantor an instrument releasing the 
Engine with respect to which such Event of Loss occurred from the lien and security interest of 
this Mortgage. For all purposes of this Mortgage, each Replacement Engine shall, after being 
subjected to the lien and security interest hereof, be deemed an "Engine" as defined herein and
