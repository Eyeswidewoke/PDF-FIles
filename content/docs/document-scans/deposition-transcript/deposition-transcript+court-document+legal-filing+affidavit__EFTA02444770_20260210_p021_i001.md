people to realize that a rather more promising perspective exists. The money will be spent to 
cover the speaker's honorarium, plus travel and upkeep costs, as well as the expenses of 
advertizing, and a hospitality dinner to link the speaker with a few specially selected guests. 
In the typical mode, (case "A"), the event would be advertized and occur broadly as 
planned. The message would be heard by an assembled group of interested persons who would 
have responded to the advertizing by choosing to attend the lecture. Then the speaker would 
return home. This could be considered quite "successful" in various dimensions of success. But 
as an example let us consider that dimension which is the most vital one strategically. This, in 
my view, is long-term institutionalization. 
Consider an alternate scenario, (case "B"), involving additional ideas and no extra money. 
In this case the lecture planner acts boldly as a strategic entrepreneur. The situation evolves as 
follows: 
1. He or she prepares a two page memo which outlines the new state of affairs in the field 
of science and religion. The memo clearly and succinctly summarizes the growth of the field, its 
interdisciplinary value, its future possibilities, its research potential, and the way that it addresses 
very strong interests and needs of students, and generally would help the college or university to 
exhibit distinctive leadership. 
2. He or she arranges to have lunch with one or more deans to discuss the memo and 
open up conversation on the key issues raised in it. 
3. He or she arranges to have lunch with the director of the development office of the 
College in order to discuss the memo and possibilities for new fund-raising strategies for the 
institution. Considerable attention is given to the fact that many religious donors lack enthusiasm 
for giving to the College because they feel alienated by the rather strong anti-religious bias 
amongst the Faculty. 
4. He or she primes the speaker carefully that the lecture will be used as a first gambit to 
raise resources to endow a new program at the college focused on science and religion. 
5. As a result of these contacts, when the lecture occurs, several deans attend along with 
two interested trustees and three potential alumni donors who have been identified and invited by 
the development office. The president of the college is unable to attend the lecture. However, at 
the special dinner hosted by the development office for the VIP's, the president meets the speaker 
and is much impressed. Two of the possible donors clearly are quite enthusiastic. 
6. Two years later, the host of the lecture (now tenured) publicly thanks both donors in 
the opening ceremonies for the new endowed professorial chair in the newly created Center for 
Research in Science and Religion which is jointly hosted by the school of religion and the faculty 
of sciences. He or she assists various journalists with their articles describing the significance of 
this new $2 million initiative and the visionary generosity of the two donors. Credit also is given 
to the visiting lecturer whose initial lecture (cost: $2,000) provided he stimulus which helped to 
get the vision rolling towards this very pleasant day. The President makes inspiring remarks.
