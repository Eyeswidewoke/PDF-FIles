take to Jeffrey's place? 
2 
A. Yes. 
3 
Q. And you were paid money to do that? 
4 
A. Yes. 
5 
Q. How much were you paid? 
6 
A. $200. 
7 
Q. On those occasions that you took other girls 
8 
to Jeffrey's house, what did you do once you got to the 
9 
house? 
10 
A. We would walk in the house. Sometimes he 
11 
would just say the door is open, walk on in. Sometimes 
12 
someone else would answer the door. He had multiple 
13 
people at his house all the time, either they were 
14 
maids, chefs, or quote, unquote, models. He said that 
15 
they were girls who traveled with him would answer the 
16 
door. 
17 
By the time I already knew the drill. The 
18 
drill was is that we went right into the kitchen, took a 
19 
right There was a staircase with pink carpet. You 
20 
walk up the stairs. Then you take a left. You walk up 
21 
another thing of stairs, and then you take another 
22 
little left, curve to the right. There is his big 
23 
bedroom. There is a picture on the wall to the right on 
24 
the hallway before you walk into his room of a little 
25 
naked girl, probably three years old with her pants 
Page 103 
1 
clothes on; sometimes he had his clothes off. Sometimes 
2 
he had a towel around him. When he walked in the room, 
3 
we already had the massage table ready. There was a 
4 
couch right next to the massage table. We would sit 
5 
there. I would tell, I would instruct the girls to do 
6 
exactly what he told me to instruct the girls to do. 
7 
I would tell them take off their shoes. We 
8 
would take off our shoes. Heleitild be in the shower. 
9 
He would say get them ready,., so I would tell the 
10 
girls to take off her shin, take off her bra, take off 
11 
her pants. He likes it when you can take off your 
12 
panties, preferably. 
13 
He would get out of the shower, wipe off, lay 
14 
down on the massage table on his stomach. And we would 
15 
proceed to massage his legs. He loved his legs 
16 
massaged. 
17 
Then we would proceed to massage his back. 
18 
And he absolutely loved his scalp being massaged as 
19 
well. So one girl would get cn his back, massage; one 
20 
girl would be massaging his scalp. His feet he liked 
21 
massaged. 
22 
Then as we are naked, and as he is naked, he 
23 
turns over and the guy likes to talk. He would like to 
24 
talk about everything: What kind of drugs we liked. 
25 
What kind of things we've done. If we have ever took a 
Page 102 
3. 
hanging down. 
2 
And then you walk into his bedroom. Big bed 
3 
on the left. Always white linen. And in that bedroom 
4 
there was another room to the left There was a steam 
5 
shower. There was a steam room in there. A shower 
6 
right next to the steam room. There was a bathroom to 
7 
the left of the steam room. There was a closet on the 
8 
opposite, opposite side of that bathroom. 
9 
There was a dresser right next to that closet 
10 
that had lotions, different lotions. I remember I think 
11 
they were from the Body Shop. Then there was toys 
12 
inside of those drawers. 
13 
When you opened up the closet, there was a 
14 
massage table. Either it would be set out for us or 
15 
most of the time we would have to set the table up for 
16 
him. 
17 
We would take three big towels. Ho liked one 
18 
towel laid down by his feet and two big towels laid by 
19 
his head. 
20 
He would walk in. And I would be with one of 
21 
my girls that I had brought. When he walked in, he 
22 
would wink at me if he hied the girl. Pretty much he 
23 
would give me a smirk or a smile like, yeah, you did a 
24 
good job. Then he would jump in the shower. 
25 
When he came in the room, sometimes he had his 
Page 104 
1 
sip of alcohol. He said that he has never drank in his 
2 
life. He said that he never took a sip of alcohol in 
3 
his life. He said did you smoke cigarettes. We would 
4 
taint yes or no. He said that he never smoked a 
5 
cigarette in his life. He said that he was a brain 
6 
surgeon. He said he wanted to know what we did in our 
7 
daily life. He wanted to know what kind of people we 
8 
hung out with. 
9 
Q. Are you describing this happening every time 
10

11 
A. Every brae we went there. 
12

13 
A. Every time I went, every time I went with a 
14 
girl. 
15

16 
happened; is that right? 
17 
A. To a T. 
18 
Q. Every time? 
19 
A. Most of the time. There has been times where 
20 
I've went there and there was an incident where it was 
21 
just me. And he sat on the, and he sat on the couch and 
22 
talked on the phone. And I had my legs wide open, and I 
23 
was naked and he wanted me to massage his feet.
