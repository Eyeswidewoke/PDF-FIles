health system that's prohibited from interv=ning until a judge determines that someone presents an "imminent 
danger=to themself or others." The consequence is a society that's neglected millions of seriously ill peo=le hidden in 
plain sight on the streets of our cities, or locked away in our prisons and jails. As such, these mentally ill people are 
often portrayed as villains. About half of these=mass killings are being done by people with severe mental illness, 
mostly schizophrenia. And if =hey were being treated, they would've been preventable. 
For example, five weeks before the shooting a= the Washington Navy Yard, the gunman, Aaron Alexis, told 
police that he was hea=ing voices and being bombarded by strangers with a microwave machine. If he =ad been 
transported to a psych ward, the shootings might never have happened. In 2007, Virginia Tech student Seung-Hui Cho 
was behaving so irrationally that a court ordered him to seek mental health care. The or=er was never carried out. Cho 
killed himself and 32 others. And befo=e James Holmes dressed up as the Joker and shot 70 people in a movie theater, 
campus police at the Universit= of Colorado had been warned that he was potentially violent. Holmes had bee= a 
brilliant graduate student there studying the inner workings of the brain, until something suddenly we=t wrong with his. 
And this is not that unusal. 
You can be the most popular student, you can be the valedictorian of your class. And if you develop 
schizophrenia it will change the functioning of your brain and chan=e the nature of your behavior. You could be 
completely normal at age 20, perhaps a good student or a gifted student =nd a solid citizen, and at 21 or 22 be 
psychotic.Dr. Lieberman, who runs the psychiatry department at Columbia University's medical school, says tha= 
schizophrenia has a genetic component and tends to run in families, affecti=g the way the circuits in the brain develop. 
You can see the structural ab=ormalities in a brain scan. And you see people, a young adult, with a normal brain, same 
age with, who has schizophrenia, and you s=e that degenerative process has already begun. Schizophrenia is a disease 
of the brain and not a disease of the mind. 
Fifty years ago people suffering from schizophrenia, depression and other forms of mental illness would have 
ended up in one of =he big state-run hospitals that were used to warehouse the seriously mentally =11. Documentaries 
like Frederick Wiseman's "Titicut Follies" helped expose the dehumanizing conditions and l=d to reforms. One by one, 
the big asylums were shut down, and over time, a half million inmates were released into co=munities to fend for 
themselves. They were supposed to be housed in residential treatment centers, medicated, and supervised by case 
workers at walk-in clinics. But the programs were never adequately funded. 
What we did is we em=tied out the hospitals and, on any given day now in the United States, half of the people 
with schizophrenia a=d other severe mental illnesses are not being treated. How difficult is it=to get somebody 
admitted who does not want to be admitted? Almost impossible in most states. The laws will read, "You have to be a 
danger to yourself or others," in some states, and judges may interpret this very, very strictly. You know, we =iddingly 
say, "You have to be either trying to kill your psychiatrist, or trying to kill yourself in f=ont of your psychiatrist, to be able 
to get hospitalized." If these peo=le aren't receiving medical attention, where are they ending up? Many of them end 
up homeless. Many of them end up in jails and prisons now. So this is a huge problem.=A0 Our jails and prisons are our 
main place now where you find mentally ill people. 
In fact by some measure=, the largest mental institution in the United States is the Cook County Jail in Chicago. 
It houses the larg=st number of mentally ill people in the country. This is a population that people don't car= about and 
so as a result of that there are not the resources out there to c=re for them. Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart is in charge 
of the jail and he is not very happy about the situation. T=m Dart: I've got probably 2,500, 2,800 people with mental 
illness in my jail today. And you look at their backgrounds, they've been in here 50, 60, 100, we have some people 
who&=39;ve been in here 400 times. 
Steve Kroft: What kind of offenses? Tom Dart: Oh my God, retail theft is a norm. And usually it's 'cause they're 
stealing something either to feed t=emselves or, frankly, they're stealing something because they just wanted it that 
se=ond. Loads of cases of criminal trespass to land. What's that? They're b=eaking in some place to sleep. Steve Kroft: 
You're saying the prisons and the jails are the new asylums? Tom Dart: Absolutely. There is no person that could argue 
otherwise that the jails and prisons are the new insane asylums. That's what we are.
