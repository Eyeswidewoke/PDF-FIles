Most important unde= the proposed agreement was that Iran would be able to keep its nuclear si=es and all of the low-
enriched uranium <http://www.iranwatch.org/ourpubs/articlestiranucleartimetable.ht=l> it had already made. It would 
ship out only its much s=aller stock of medium-grade fuel. CNN <http://topics.bloomberg.com/cnn/> repo=ted last 
week that a similar deal will be on the table again at the talks =n Kazak=stan 
<http://topics.bloomberg.com/kazakhstanh . 
This initial agreem=nt with Iran would be just the first step in a process. Later, the parties=would move to a 
comprehensive arrangement in which Iran would, perhaps (th= details are still vague), get rid of its enriched uranium 
and limit -- to a token, face-saving level -- its =bility to make more of it. The U.S. would, perhaps, drop most of its 
sanct=ons and move toward normal relations. 
Same Deal <1=> 
Sound familiar? It =hould. The North Korea and Iran deals are essentially the same. After the =greement with North 
Korea, the country's leaders were left with enough p=utonium in the form of spent reactor fuel to make about six 
nuclear weapons, after further processing. The deal=being floated for Iran would leave it with sufficient enriched 
uranium to =ake about six nuclear weapons, after further processing. 
Of course, North Ko=ea did the processing and made the bombs. What we have to ask ourselves is=this: Why won't 
Iran? Is there any reason to believe that this time the =utcome would be different? 
The mistake in the =orth Korea talks was not to insist from the outset that all nuclear fuel s=ould be shipped out of the 
country, and all nuclear sites should be disman=led. The U.S. made a deal that lowered the diplomatic pressure on 
Supreme Leader Kim Jong-II, but left the danger=in place. North Korea got an agreement with the U.S. without giving up 
its=ability to make nuclear weapons. It was in a position to restart the progr=m at any time. 
If Iran accepts the=interim deal being floated this week, it will do even better. Iran will no= have to stop producing 
nuclear fuel and will only have to cut its product=on back by a small percentage, while keeping enough to produce a 
small arsenal. Nor will it have to dismantle i=s production sites. Like North Korea, it will be able to restart productio= at 
any time. 
The lesson from Nor=h Korea is that an interim agreement of this kind won't work. In additio= to leaving too much fuel 
in place that can be enriched to weapons grade, =he proposed agreement inevitably renders legitimate what it doesn't 
prohibit. If nuclear fuel, production or equi=ment is permitted, then it becomes Iran's right. 
Once such a notion =s accepted, the interim deal becomes the only one, because it dissipates t=e crisis atmosphere. The 
public starts thinking that things are safe, or a= least safe enough, though they aren't. The effect is to diminish the 
support for sanctions that was so difficult =o win, and to make it almost impossible to reinstate these measures once i= 
becomes clear that Iran is not taking the next steps, which -- just as wi=h North Korea -- it won't. 
Before making any h=lfway deal, U.S. and European diplomats should insist that Iran remove its=lf from the path that 
North Korea so easily followed. If Iran wants to convince 
<http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Documents/Board/2011/gov2011-65=pdf> the world that it has no desire to acquire 
nuclear weapons, th=n it should be willing to give up the means to make them. When the talks r=sume this week, let's 
hope history isn't forgotten.
