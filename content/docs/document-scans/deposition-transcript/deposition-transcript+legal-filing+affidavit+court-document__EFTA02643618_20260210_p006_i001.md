color:rgb=255,255,255);text-decoration-style:initial;text-decoration-color:initial">=Im glad that you find the idea 
interesting and think that you might co=sider it, though you have to consult lawyers first. 
My own =iew is different. To me the proposal I suggested seems to be a very =imple 
way of settling this matter, which to me is extremely troubling..=A0 I realize that this is just another case of a 
longstanding difference i= the way we approach these problems, a difference that has been clear ever=since we were 
discussing the interest on the loan from the Trust and found=that we could not communicate because I mistakenly 
assumed that it was a d=scussion among family members while your letters made it very clear and ex=licit that you saw 
it as a legal issue to be settled among lawyers and Bai=co, perhaps with a mediator in the adversary proceeding. All 
matters=1 find it very hard to comprehend, and to live with, but so be it. 
So by all means consult with your lawyer, or perhaps a battery of l=wyers, to make sure 
that your interests are properly protected. I do='t need any lawyer's advice. The matter is perfectly clear a=d 
straightforward. So there is no reason for me to hire a lawyer to =eal with the question and to have a lawyer contact 
yours and initiate a di=cussion in which we all participate. 
The matter is very sim=le. We can proceed without delay if you agree to settle the issue 
in=the simple manner that I suggested. 
As for your proposals i= your letter of March 29, as I wrote you, the letter was so 
shocking that =t was hard for me to bring myself to respond, but I did, in detail, but de=ided not to send it. Perhaps I 
should. Will think about it. 
As for your proposals, my response was the obvious one. ='m sorry for the stress you 
had to endure, but your efforts were a was=e of time for reasons I had already fully explained before you undertook 
t=em. As I'm sure you recall, a few years ago, I requested tax pay=ents from the marital trust when my IRA was being 
rapidly depleted by my a=visers who were distributing half to family and using the other half to pa= management fees 
and taxes for the entire estate, so that to pay Alex'= medical expenses and the expenses for Wellfleet I had to withdraw 
excess =unds with exorbitant taxes, all that before withdrawing even a cent to liv= on again with exorbitant taxes. Your 
response was to refuse the req=est unless I agreed to intrusive and insulting financial investigations --=of a kind I never 
considered when providing funds to you for something you=needed. I made it clear and explicit at the time that I would 
not su=mit to this procedure. Since your efforts and proposals simply repea= the same procedure, they were a waste of 
time. 
There were=some things in your letter that were correct. You're right that =espite what 
has happened, I'm still a "wealthy man," with in=ome well above the median, though lacking a pension and accumulated 
proper=y, not at the level of my peers. Furthermore, I can supplement my in=ome by teaching large undergraduate 
courses, something I'd never done =nd that is not that common for people approaching 90, but something that l=enjoy. 
And you too are a wealthy man, for the same reasons: the reas=ns are that I've worked hard all my life, lived fairly 
simply (and liv= even more simply today), and was therefore able to put aside enough money=to ensure that my 
children and grandchildren are very well cared for, inde=initely. 
But I again suggest that we put all of=this aside, and deal quickly and simply with what 
appears to be the one ou=standing issue: dividing the Marital trust and then dissolving it, all ver= simple, needing no 
lawyers, at least on my part.
