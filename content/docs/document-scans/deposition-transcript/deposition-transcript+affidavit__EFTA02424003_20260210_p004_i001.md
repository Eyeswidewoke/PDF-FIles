but will not do it until his heart and value is fixed. On Saturday, July 3r' my father fell and had a 
comminuted fracture of proximal right humerus extending to the metadiadiaphseal region, and 
was referred to an Orthopedic surgeon. They will not do surgery until the heart and value are 
repaired. He will be undergoing valve and heart surgery some time this month at the University 
of Washington, under a research study program. It has been determined that he would not live 
through a traditional open heart and valve surgery. This research study program is being very 
closely monitored by the Food and Drug Aadminsitration. It has taken longer then our family 
had hoped to get the necessary approval(s). We were told during the past weeks that my 
father should be able to get the needed surgery by the end of July or first of August. My 
mother is 73 years old and suffers from her own medical problems. In recent weeks, it was 
requested that she have a CT scan of her abdomen. During an examination, her Internal 
medicine doctor felt something that should not be on the right side of her stomach. This CT 
scan was completed on Tuesday, July 13° . 
I am not trying too runaway from St. Thomas, but I do not understand, with all the 
documentation that I have provided to them (management), why they continue to put up road 
blocks hindering my transfer to take care of my ailing parents. With all that I that is going on my 
life, in the past three years, I have witnessed other officers that have requested hardship 
transfers from the Port of St. Thomas, with less need that myself, that have been approved for 
one reason or another without all of the problems that I am having to deal with. I feel as if I am 
being punished for being a whistle blower on a co- worker or possibly management has stored 
information in my employee official personal folder. This would be information I have not been 
provided, which could be causing why there the road blocks. I am at a loss for words, but I 
would like to know why I am being unfairly treated? 
Since I joined US Customs/CBP, I have been a model employee and a very dependable 
employee. I feel that this is an unfair labor practices and I feel very much discriminated against 
as a person. I feel management is being deceitful and or willfully obstructing my right to 
request for and be allowed to transfers that I am entitled to. I was told I need to resign or return 
to St. Thomas on July 26'". I feel they (the Area Port of St. Thomas and the San Juan OFO), 
are telling me to withdraw the request for a hardship transfer, so they can approve someone 
else's request to transfer from St. Thomas. I have all necessary documentation needed to 
verify all requests, claims and allegations I have made in this request. On or about June 16, 
2010, I notified the supervisor in St. Thomas that I was going to request a investigation through 
one of my state representatives to look into the problems I am having. I was told "oh no, we 
are not trying to stall this, that will not be necessary." In believing their word did not do forward 
anything then, but now, the harassment continues and I feel I have no other recourse but to 
ask for your assistance in getting this matter resolved. With all that is happening, it is causing a 
tremendous amount of stressed, I have lost weight, my hair continues to fall out daily and 
every time I think about the situation I start crying but I continue my faith and beliefs. Overall, it 
is taking a tremendous toll on my mind, body and soul. 
Thank you in advance for all your assistance and understanding in this resolving this request. 
If your office is not the appropriate place to get the help I seek, and there is someone else that 
can better get this resolved, could ou lease forward this request to that office and notify me 
via phone a 
or email me a 
of the change o venue or reso ve.
