Notice of Changes to Your Agreement 
We are making Important Changes to your American Express Ca rdmember Agreement ('Agreement') governing the American Express.
Card Account identified on this Notice. 
Unless otherwise indicated below, these changes become effective with billing periods beginning on or after May 1, 2005, whether or not you 
receive a billing statement. This Notice formally amends your Agreement, and any contrary or conflicting language in that Agreement is 
replaced fully and completely. Note that the terms of your Account are subject to change (including increasing APRs/DPRs and fees, 
changing fixed APRs/DPRs to variable APRs/DPRs, and adding new terms) in accordance with the Agreement governing your Account. All 
terms of the Agreement not amended herein remain In full force and effect. 
This is an important Notice of changes to your Agreement. We recommend that you carefully review these changes, share them with any 
Additional Cardmembers on your Account, and keep this Notice for future reference. If you have questions regarding this Notice, please call 
the telephone number listed on the back of your American Express Card. 
Determining the Prime Rate Applicable to your Account 
We are changing the timing of when we determine the Prime Rato used to calculate the variable APRs (and corresponding DPRs) appicable 
to your Account. Accordingly, we are replacing subsection C of the Finance Charges section of the Sign & Travel' and/or Extended 
Payment Option Agreement with the following: 
'C. The 'Prime Rate' is determined once with respect to each billing period. The Prime Rate for each biting period is the Prime Rate 
published in the Money Rates section (or successor section) of The Wall Street Journal on (a) the first day of that billing period or (b) the 
day that is two days prior to the Closing Date of that billing period, whichever is higher. In each case, if such a day is not a customary 
publication day for The Wall Street Journal, we will substitute the closest preceding day that is a customary publication day. If The Wail 
Street Journal ceases or suspends publication, we may refer to the Prime Rate published in any other newspaper of general circulation 
in New York, New York, or we may substiute a similar reference rate at our sole discretion. Any Increase or decrease to an APR 
resulting from a change in the Prime Rate takes effect as of the first day of the billing period. An increase in the Prime Rate means that 
the variable APRs (and corresponding DPRs) applicable to your Account wit increase and you may Incur higher Finance Charges and 
may have a higher Minimum Amount Due? 
Average Daily Balance Method for Calculation of Finance Charges (Effective May 8, 2005) 
We are revising the Average Daily Balance Method for Calculation of Finance Charges section of the Sign & Travel® and/or Extended 
Payment Option Agreement to add the following two sentences to the end of that section: 
'In our sole discretion, we also may round any calculations made in determining the Finance Charges on your Account in any way that 
is convenient to us. Any such rounding may apply to or cause variations in your DPRs.' 
Arbitration (Effective May 8, 2005) 
We are amending certain subsections under the Arbitration section of your Agreement as follows (references to subsections below refer to 
those subsections in the Arbitration section of your Agreement): 
We we replacing the fest sentence of the Definitions subsection with the following: 
'As used in this Arbitration Provision, the term "Claim' means any claim, dispute or controversy between you and us arising from or 
relating to your Card Account, this Agreement, the Electronic Funds Transfer Services Agreement, the Sign & Travel and/or Extended 
Payment Option Agreement, and any other related or prior agreement that you may have had with us, or the relationships resulting from 
any of the above agreements ("Agreements"), except for the validity, enforceability a scope of this Arbitration Provision or the 
Agreements? 
We are replacing the Initiation of Arbitration Proceeding/Selection of Administrator subsection with the following: 
of Arbitration Proceeding/Selection of Administrator: Any Claim shall be resolved, upon the election by you or us, by 
arbitration pursuant to this Arbitration Provision and the code of procedures of the national arbitration organization to which the Claim Is 
referred in effect at the time the Claim Is filed (the 'Code'), except to the extent the Code conflicts with this Agreement. Claims shall be 
referred to either the National Arbitration Forum ('NAP) Of the American Arbitration Association ('AAA-), as selected by the party 
electing to use arbitration. If a selection by us of either of these organizations is unacceptable to you, you shall have the right within 30 
days after you receive notice of our election to select the other organization fisted to serve as arbitration administrator. For a copy of the 
procedures, to file a Claim or for other information about these organizations, contact them as follows:

• MA at 335 Madison Avenue, New 'tack, NY 10017; website: www.adr.org." 
We are replacing the first sentence of the Significance of Arbitration subsection with the following:
'IF ARBITRATION IS CHOSEN BY ANY PARTY WITH RESPECT TO A CLAIM, NEITHER YOU NOR WE WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO 
LITIGATE THAT CLAIM IN COURT OR HAVE A JURY TRIAL ON THAT CLAIM." 
We are adding the following two sentences to the end of the Restrictions on Arbitration subsection: 
'No arbitration award or decision will have any preclusive effect as to issues cc clains in any dispute with anyone who is not a named 
party to the arbitration. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement (including but not limited to the "Continuation' provision 
below) and without waiving either party's right to appeal such decision, should any portion of this "Restrictions on Arbitration' provision 
be deemed invalid or unenforceable, then the entire Arbitration Provision (other than this sentence) shall not apply.' 
We are replacing the second sentence of the Continuation subsection with the following: 
'Except as otherwise provided in the "Restrictions on Arbitration" provision above, if any portion of this Arbitration Provision (other than 
the "Restrictions on Arbitration' provision) is deemed invalid or unenforceable, it shall not invalidate the remaining portions of this 
Arbitration Provision, the Agreement cc any predecessor agreement you may have had with us, each of which shall be enforceable 
regardless of such Invalidity.'
