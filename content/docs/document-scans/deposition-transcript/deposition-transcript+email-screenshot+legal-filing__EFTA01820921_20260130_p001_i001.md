Subject: Re: 
yes, I read them and its all about what i do , it took a year of arguing before you gave in, you 
mean i didnt give in as quickly. and you take that to be a bad thing, it is your belief that I should 
succumb to petty ,behavior based on nothing more than childish jealousies. while all the time 
ignoring the fact that you do not do much but complain.

Sorry but you didn't do any of those things the way you did this one„it took a year of arguing to explain to you 
every one of those issues and it is still a compromise, jenna after 2 years still lives at 301, still comes to florida, 
you hired dana after I wanted her to leave, moved her to 301 and she still visits as well, you took hundreds of 
naps with sarah after we already talked about it and watched movies in the office every night hugging and 
being affectionate to these people...all of that knowing it was painful for me and i needed something from you 
that you didn't find justifiable or important enough. I know you were not trying to hurt me and I had to deal 
with the fact you are just going to do what you want. I obviously can't force you to do anything. 
With this email you actually took my needs into consideration without fighting me (well, until now) , I 
appreciated it, I realized how much nicer it is and I should do that for you too. ( this would be the point where i 
am dealing with my own actions and i am not content with them ) 
I don't see why we are arguing now...are you actually reading my emails?

All  needed to see was you actually taking a step to do what was important to me .. no naps no 
movie watching, no dana , no jenn„ these are all the same , just this one thing. , jeffrey doing 
something he detests just to demonstrate to nadia that he is willing to give up what he believes 
in. no matter how little he recieves in return.. It is just one more thing. no more no less. you 
seem content not to deal with your actions. only mine. it is not helpful constructive or fair.
