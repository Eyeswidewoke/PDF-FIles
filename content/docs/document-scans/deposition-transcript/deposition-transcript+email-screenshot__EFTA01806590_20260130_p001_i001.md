Re: 
Hello Jeffrey! Sorry for not answering so long, Im ok. But Im lying Im not ok. but its personal. Just feeling too bad inside 
and fed up of everything here. Im at work all day and my skype is online here every work day from 9 to 6. but I cant talk. 
then usually I go home and study. 
Trying to do my best with marks to have scholarship. Writing to you right now with tears in my eyes but I cant cry on my 
workplace and mascara is too expensive to spoil. To tell the truth I feel like Im living to take everybody's problems and 
wishes and nobody wanta to hear me. I dont speak with my parents. From that time. My only parents who loved me all 
my life and each other also, doesn't do it to me and between them also anymore. it hurts. I know they love me, Im not a 
13 year child to blame them that they dont love me its stupid. but the fact is that we are not together. Trully, when I 
came here, it was good. My friends missed me, my boyfrend took care of me, helped to find a job, put his sholder when i 
need that. I gave him every happy moment I could. 
I was with him my first time. That was my second time after you. you was the other person who changed me. You have 
seen how afraid i was, how shy I was and you made me a woman, you made me feel like a woman. You made me beleive 
that Im beautiful and you like it. I remember everything and I used it. Week ago I understood that he had another 
girlfriend and she is good smart virgin. I know thats stupid for you and you even shouldnt read that shit Im writing to 
you. But I want. Not because I dont have anyone to share with, but because it is you. It is so difficult you know, the 
person to whom you beleived and who told you hourly how does he want to change my last name to his... Oh, whatever. 
Im much stronger than he thinks. Than everybody thinks. Im tired of being here. If I only had a chance my dream would 
be a flight next minute. Im trying to make my visa, I have been consultaing some representatives from embassy but 
nothing heared from them. Remember I brought you a letter. so I cant understand my situation clearly, maybe you can 
know. Jeffrey knows everything huh =) so I officialy ws changing my visa from 11 to B2 and I officialy had rights to stay in 
US untill I will receive an answer despite the fact that my jl visa expired at october. 
did the same and she got her 
letter in November with "yes" and then went home. I was waiting until! the end of anuary with the words WE need 
more documents why u stay here until! 16th of February. I went home at 14th. I didnt hear the no and didnt hear the 
yes. What if I could not have chance to fligh away in october but I need it in November what should I do without the 
letter which came only in January? And I have my ticket from October, it is expired but I had it can be a document that I 
just became sick and couldnt go home. This is the first problem the second is court and you know about it. I dont think 
they can give me j1 student visa its ridiculous I should give them something more serious and reasonable. I will think 
about it. 
hahaha . I suppose next week I will 
definetely have them. Thank you so much I would never put them if you didnt tell me , I was shy. they are ugly. Also, I 
would like to ask do you still need those tiles, because as far as I understood, you need something good and special we 
have a lot of simple tiles which doesnt worth to be transported to NY because there are more better of them 
everywhere, but I found those which are handmade and was even used for restoration of registan mosque. I went to 
them and took some pictures they are on my disk if you need them I can send you but actually they told they can make 
any print you need professionaly and fast.Thank you for money transfer. You sent me more than I asked, I had 
something to cover my daily problems and pay for everything. Took 150 from that for Embassy. I hope to pass it. Im very 
nervous. I cant see the fact staying here.... If you only could pretend how much I want to ring your bell, see your smile 
and here "come, come, lets take a "quick" 
nap )) it was not so quick but it was very warm. I hope you are good. 
Say hello to girls. I miss. Hell how I miss. 
Take care.
