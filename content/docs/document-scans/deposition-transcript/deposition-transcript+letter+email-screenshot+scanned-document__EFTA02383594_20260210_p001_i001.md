Firstly and foremost I wanted to wish you a happy an= healthy new year. I hope it's a good one for you.<=p> 
At some point after the holiday over the next month =r two I'd like to speak about your year-end redemption.</=> 
When we last spoke you fairly observed that while ou= risk adjusted returns were good at some point absolute returns 
are needed= I took the message to heart and went about making a few changes int=nded to achieve this objective. 
Additionally some other opportunities have recently presented themselves to the fund th=t should result in higher 
returns. 
Before I discuss the changes, first I do want to poi=t out just how good our risk adjusted returns are. I've a ttachrd the 
report put out by Soc Gen which has results for approximately 1200 h=dge funds. When ranked by annualized returns 
over max drawdown we sit between the 98th and 99th p=rcentile of all hedge funds. I understand you can't eat lack o= 
risk but I thought I'd point it out because the return to risk rati= is what shows talent (even if the risk needs to be raised 
to achieve desired return). This is fixable, lack of talen= is not. A 2 Sortino is generally considered to be very good. =e 
are now north of a 7. 
The goal was /has always been to raise the VAR (Valu= at risk) on the portfolio to approximately 80 BPS daily (versus 
what we b=lieve the industry to average of 1%). We currently sit at approximat=ly 50 BPs and have averaged around 
that this year. It being below its target is still largely a function of =wo things: a low recent market volatility and saving 
room for managers in =he pipeline to be onboarded that we are excited about. 
However, For a good reason we will still not be very=soon reaching our risk target and that is that in the past few 
months (inc=uding in the coming portfolios being onboarded in the past few weeks) the =mount of "non-risk" portfolios 
being brought on has materially grown. This includes both our First loss b=siness which has increased by $150m this 
month alone and has added a lot m=re over the prior few months. It also includes a number of clever ar=itrages we 
have found and are growing. These represent significant expected return without much risk -preferable to ris= based 
strategies. They do however, suck up some balance sheet.=/o:p> 
I'm sure you noticed that since you put in you= redemption, our July estimate was increased by approximately 10 BPs 
when =inalized and more importantly our August was far and away the firms best i= existence. The main fund was up a 
bit over 3.3% for the month (still an estimate) bringing YTD to 7.8% (and appr=ximately 8.8% including through today, 
with September up approximately 1%)= We believe last year to be the aberration. It was one of the =orst years ever for 
platforms that have the basics of our strategy. Millennium posted its second to worst year e=er (approx. 3%), SAC had
