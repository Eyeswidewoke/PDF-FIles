businesses that together have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance in the trust account (less 
any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest earned) at the time of our signing a 
definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. If our board of directors is not able to 
independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion 
from an independent accounting firm or an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA, 
with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. We do not intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated 
industries in connection with our initial business combination. 
We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which 
our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target 
business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-
transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order 
to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we will only 
complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the 
outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for 
it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as 
amended, or the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more 
of the voting securities of the target. our stockholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a 
minority interest in the post-transaction company. depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the 
business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial 
number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would 
acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of 
new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a 
majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the 
equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses arc owned or acquired by the post-transaction 
company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for 
purposes of the 80% of net assets test. If the business combination involves more than one target business, the 
80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target business.

Prior to the date of this provectus, we will file a Registration Statement on Form 8-A with the SEC to 
voluntarily register our securities under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the 
Exchange Act. As a result, we will be subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act. 
We have no current intention of filing a Form IS to suspend our reporting or other obligations under the 
Exchange Act prior or subsequent to the consummation of our business combination. 
We are an "emerging growth company,- as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as 
amended, or the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS 
Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that 
are applicable to other public companies that are not "emerging growth companies- including, but not limited 
to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley 
Act of 2002. or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in 
our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding 
advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not 
previously approved. If some investors fmd our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active 
trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile. 
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an "emerging growth company' can take 
advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(aX2Xlit) of the Securities Act for complying 
with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an "emerging growth company" can delay the 
adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We 
intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. 
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (I) the last day of the fiscal year (a) 
following the fifth anniversary of the completion of this offering. (b) in which we have total annual gross 
revenue of at least $1.0 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the 
market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th. 
and (2) the date on which we have issued more than SI.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-
year period. References herein to "emerging growth company- shall have the meaning associated with it in the 
JOBS Act.
