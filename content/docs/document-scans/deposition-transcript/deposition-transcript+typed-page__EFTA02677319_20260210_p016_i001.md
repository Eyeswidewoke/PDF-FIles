CRN 4370 See A 
This seminar is an interdisciplinary survey of major themes in Middle Eastern history, focusing on 
the role of myths. rhetoric, and propaganda in politics. Its multidisciplinary approach incorporates 
texts from a wide range of fields and disciplines: art, politics, religion. history. philosophy, and 
literature. Focusing on primary sources, the course charts cultural trends in their various facets 
and their interaction form their very inception to the present day. as seen and interpreted by writes 
and artists themselves. From sacred biographies and Sufi books on everyday conduct to modem 
literature and the cinema, the rich mosaic of artistic and religious experiences of the Middle East 
are explored to deepen our understanding of what it meant to be a Muslim and what shaped the 
Muslim experience over the past centuries. Literature, cinema and popular culture will be studied 
as ways of understanding the contemporary issues faced by these Muslim societies. How has 
culture been used to create, express, or legitimate political power? And conversely, how have word 
and images been used to underwrite criticism and dissent? How does the past define the 
contemporary dilemmas of the Middle East, and how does Islam function as ideology? We will also 
be reading from the works of poets and novelists who lived in Palestine and then Israel in the 
twentieth century.

"When the stranger says: 'What is the meaning of this city? Do you huddle close together 
because you love each other?' What will you answer? 'We all dwell together to make money from 
each other? T.S. Eliot The great capital cities of nineteenth-century Europe were the midwives of 
the modern world - sites of the changes that defined modernity. This course uses London and 
Parts as a prism through which to examine two separate, but intertwined developments: the 
realities of a new kind of urban fife, on the one hand, and, on the other, the fantasies and 
expectations generated by the city that became the ground for a new social imaginary. It looks at 
such topics as: the transformation of physical space; the production and enactment of class and 
gender differences: crime disease, and prostitution: markets and consumerism: the culture of 
empire; technological transformations; and the emergence of a modern sensibility. In studying the 
development of these iconic capital cities. the course explores both the character of the emerging 
urban environment and the ways in which contemporaries understood and made meaning of these 
developments.'

CRN 7226 Sec A 
For Europeans in general, and for scholars in particular, the Great War of 1914-18 was the 
shaping event of the twentieth century 0 an event that not only set the frame for future 
developments but persists in memory to the present. Yet the specific legacies of the war have 
been understood differently by different kinds of authors writing in different times, in different 
genres, and within different historiographical frameworks. This course examines various 
interpretations of the war, seeking to uncover what the war has meant and the implications of 
these different understandings across time. It asks: How did eye-witness accounts shape the war 
story? How did the understanding of the war's legacies change in light of subsequent conflicts. 
Including the Holocaust. the Cold War and the war in Vietnam? What role did novelists and 
filmmakers play in telling the war story? And how have such popular accounts intersected with 
those of professional historians? Why and how do particular aspects of the war gain special 
resonance in different moments? Finally, what is at stake now as the war recedes in time and 
memory? In addressing these questions, the course uses primary and secondary documents. 
novels and film to explore the creation and transformation of historical knowledge as new 
generations make meaning from the past. This examination is especially pertinent as we approach 
the 100-year anniversary of the outbreak of the war.
