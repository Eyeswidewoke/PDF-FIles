2015 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 58928, * 
Before turning to the merits of Mr. Steadman's claims, the court addresses the parties' 
dispute over whether Green Tree is a proper defendant to Mr. Steadman's claims. First, 
Mr. Steadman's assertion that Green Tree assumed BoA's liability in tort or under 
consumer protection laws is meritless. Ordinarily, an assignee does not become 
vicariously liable for its predecessors torts or breaches without an explicit contractual 
agreement to assume ['11] such liability. See Lewis v. Boehm, 89 Wash. App. 103, 107, 
947 P.2d 1265, 1268 (1997) ("[T]he assignee of an executory contract is not liable on the 
contract in the absence of an express assumption of the obligations contained therein."); 
see also Kucheynik v. Mort. Elec. Registration Sys., Inc., No. C10-451Z, 2010 U.S. Dist. 
LEXIS 132547, 2010 WL 5174540, at *4 (W.D. Wash. Dec. 15, 2010) (disagreeing that 
"the mere assignment of contract, without more, automatically exposes the assignee to 
liability . . . for allegedly fraudulent conduct of the assignor" because "[u]nder Washington 
contract law, an assignment of contract does not impose on the assignee the liabilities of 
the assignor unless the assignee assumes those liabilities.").' Mr. Steadman identifies no 
such contractual agreement by Green Tree. And Mr. Steadman advances no other viable 
theory of successor liability. See Hall v. Armstrong Cork, Inc., 103 Wn.2d 258, 692 P.2d 
787, 789-90 (Wash. 1984). As such, Mr. Steadman may not hold Green Tree liable for 
prior improper acts by BoA. To the extent Mr. Steadman's claims are predicated on such 
acts, rather than on Green Tree's acts, they are not viable.

(W.D. Wash. Jan. 25. 2013) ("IAN assignee is liable for past breaches of the assignor only if he has expressly assumed any 
duties correlative with the right assigned, there [12] being no implication of assumption by the mere assignment") (internal 
quotation and alterations omitted); Chavets v GMAC Mod.. LW. No. 2:11-CV-01097-00W SS. 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 85505. 
2012 WI. 2343202. at '4 (C.D. Cal. June 20. 2012) ("Plaintiff has offered no authonty, however, to support her position that a 
loan servicer, trustee, assignee, nominee beneficiary. or even a successor in interest can be liable vicariously for the actions of 
an originator."); Au v. Republic State Mod. Co., No. CIV. 11.00251 JMS, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEAS 106439. 2012 WL 3113147. at 
'11 (D. Haw. July 31. 2012) ('lAIn assignee cannot be liable for unfair or deceptive acts that may have occurred when loan was 
consummated. and . . . liability for damages does not attach merely because one is an assignee") (internal alterations and 
quotations omitted): Uy v. Wells Fargo Bank N.A.. No. CIV. 10-00204 ACK. 2011 U.S. Dist. LEAS 33629. 2011 WL 1236590. 
at •10 (D. Haw. Mar. 28. 2011) (1Cpaims of fraud and violations of consumer protection laws are inappropriate to assert against 
an assignee where there are no allegations that the assignee had any contact with the mortgagor or made any representations 
to the mortgagor and the tactual basis for the clams occurred prior to assignment of the mortgage loan?), U.S. v Thompson 
and Georgeson. Inc.. 346 F.2d 865. 889 (9th Cir. 1965) ("Merely as assignee ore does not become affirmatively sable for a 
deficit in the accounts between his assignor and the other party to the assigned contract. Any such (93] liability would have to 
be based upon an affirmative assumption. by the assignee, of the obligations of his assignor on the contract. Of won some 
independent contractual arrangement?). 
Second, Green Tree's assertion that it is not the proper party to Mr. Steadman's claims for 
breach of contract and breach of the implied duty of good faith is mistaken. Contrary to 
Green Tree's assertions, it is irrelevant that Green Tree was "not a party to the alleged" 
loan modification agreement between Mr. Steadman and BoA. (Reply (DKt. # 33) at 8.) 
BoA assigned to Green Tree "all beneficial interest under [Plaintiff's] Deed of Trust . . . 
together with the note(s) and obligations therein described and the money due and to 
become due thereon with interest and all rights accrued under said Deed of Trust." (Box 
Decl. (Ex. 1) ("Assignment").) To the extent BoA and Mr. Steadman had previously 
contracted to modify the note's terms, those modified terms were what Green Tree was 
assigned. (See Mod. Agreement); Morse Elec. Prod. Corp. v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Co., 
90 Wn.2d 195, 579 P.2d 1341, 1342 (Wash.1978) (holding that an assignee cannot 
acquire any rights in excess of what the assignor has the ability to transfer); Fed. Fin. Co.
