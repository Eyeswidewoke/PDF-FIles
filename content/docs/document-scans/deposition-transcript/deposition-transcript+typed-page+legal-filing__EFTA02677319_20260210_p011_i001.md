Credits: 4 
CRN 5908 Sec AX 
This course exploit's contemporary issues in international education from a comparative 
perspective. Education is an important factor in economic, human and social development, and 
comparative inquiry is necessary to understand both global trends and local contexts. The impact 
of contemporary processes of globalization are central to the course, creating a forum for critically 
exploring the changing nature of education and it's relationship to economic development. 
democratic citizenship, social movements & change, social control, and cultural production. We 
examine the political economy of education reform in the context of the nation-state, key historical 
legacies (e.g. Colonialism), the rise and dominance of human capital theory, and the role and 
function of international organizations and international aid in education development. We pay 
particular attention to the developing world and the inter-relations between education and poverty. 
In addition, since many less-developed countries are now looking to the developed world for 
models of education reform and improvement (and in some cases vice versa), we will consider 
some of the most prominent reform models from the OECD countries (Organisation for Economic 
Co-operation and Development) and how they are being adopted by less-developed countries- We 
will discuss the various actors in the provision and reform of education in the developing world: 
governments (nationals and sub-national); international multi-lateral organizations (The World 
Bank. the regional development banks. UNESCO. UNDP, OECD. UNICEF. etc): inter-national and 
local NGOs and civil society: communities, parents, schools, teachers and children: labor unions: 
etc. The focus of the course will be on pnmary and secondary schooling but we will consider 
higher education as necessary as well as the impact of labor markets. And while the course 
focuses on education per se, It is built on a philosophy that broader human development requires 
that educational issues be considered together with health, social protection, and other sectors. 
Building from a base in the social sciences, the course examines multidisciplinary frameworks and 
methodologies, and multiple dimensions (scientific. pragmatic, and global) shaping contemporary 
debates about education. Considerable attention will be paid to teaming how to interpret data 
used for educational planning, policy, and advocacy. Additional topics Include: early childhood 
development, gender and education, the millennium development goals (MDG's) situations of 
severe crisis and war, teacher training and identity, curricular and pedagogical trends, the role of 
information & computer technology (ICT), educational quality and opportunity.

CRN 2992 Sec A 
This course introduces students to the history of education in the United States, exploring the 
ideologies and theoretical frameworks that have been paramount in different historical periods 
and the ways they have shaped the social, cultural, economic, and political dimensions of 
educational institutions in America. One key objective of the course is to provide a historical 
perspective on the schooling experience of diverse groups of people. This course focuses on 
issues of power and privilege and the ways that race, class, gender, citizenship/nationality, and 
sexuality intersect with school policies and practices across historical moments. By historically 
linking the development of educational initiatives to notions of power, nation building and 
citizenship, this course also furthers an understanding about the multiple purposes of education 
within democratic nations and its roles) within our current social and political climate. At course 
end, students will be able to demonstrate an understanding of the development of American 
education by explaining key historical conditions and events that have shaped present day 
educational realities.

Within the context of global justice and international aid, the salvation narrative of education 
reigns. In developing nations, education is widely positioned as the key to social and political 
stability, the strengthening of civil society, and the fostering of a vibrant and growing economy. 
This seminar explores the discourse of education as a human right within this broader salvation 
narrative and Investigates how new categories of meaning and universal standards about 
education become produced and contested through this major approach to global social justice. 
The course raises Important questions about the localization of human rights by problematizing 
how these rights become translated into local contexts of power and culture. The readings draw 
from across the social sciences, primarily anthropology, sociology, and political science.

3101 Refugees. Immigrants and Education 
Faculty: Martin, Margery 
MW 11:55 AM 01:35 PM 
Credits: 4 
CRN 6862 Sec A 
Immigrant-origin children have become the fastest growing segment of the national chill 
population with one in three children under the age of 1.8 projected to be the child of an immigrant 
by 2020. These children face considerable challenges but also demonstrate remarkable 
resilience. This interdisciplinary course will consider psychological, anthropological, sociological, 
and educational contributions to the study of immigrant children and adolescents and the schools 
and communities that receive them. We will review the growing presence of immigrant youth in 
public schools In the United States and other postlndustnal societies. We will delve into the cnucal 
role of the educational experience on the adaptation of immigrant youth and experiences that may 
factor into their experiences such as: refugee, visa. or undocumented status: the variety of 
stressors involved in the process of immigration: community forces, marginality, discrimination 
and minority status: and venous pathways of (trans)forming identity development. Lastly, we will 
also examine how schools, a critical site of reception for immigrant families and their children, 
enact the broader perceptions and immigration debates in the United States and other countries 
with growing populations of immigrant origin families.
