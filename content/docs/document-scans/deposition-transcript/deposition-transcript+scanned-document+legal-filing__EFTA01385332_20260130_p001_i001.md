HY E&P approaching a "normal" sector in the new normal 
oil market 
In the first two years following the dramatic collapse in oil prices in 2H 14, E&P 
players were largely focused on structural changes to the business model 
which could fit into a restructured oil market. On the capital structure side, 
this included major efforts to repair the balance sheet via equity raise, 
conversion of debt to equity, some more distressed exchanges and debt 
reduction via asset sales. On the asset portfolio side, we saw many players 
implementing major overhauls - mainly a shift to the Permian by names like 
WPX, QEP and SM Energy. Others expanded their footprint in their core 
basins - not just established Permian players, but also companies in second 
tier basins like Bakken (Oasis) or Eagle Ford (Sanchez). 
During this period, corporate strategies revolved around fundamental sector 
views (long term oil prices, preferred basins) and financial management by 
companies (equity raises, major divestitures). By early 2017. broad financial 
and portfolio strategies for most companies were largely in place. Post-OPEC 
deal in November 2016, the HY Energy sector was trading only 25 bps wide of 
the broader HY index, reminiscent of spreads seen during 1H 14, and a far cry 
from the >1,000 bps gap in early 2016. Meanwhile, the oil markets in 2017, 
while volatile, have answered some concerns regarding oil price downside risk 
by establishing the $40 floor (for WTI). With the oil market settling at the "new 
normal" range, the exit of weak players from the market and major sector 
themes (like the Permian Premium) having played out, the HY E&P group has 
been transitioning to a "normal" HY sector with standard credit themes like 
operational performance, cash flow models, and balance sheets allowing for 
greater differentiation - in many ways similar to pre-2014 market, except for 
the keen new learned awareness of downside oil risk. 
Solid operating performance of E&Ps continues into Pt' 17 
On the operational front, E&P players responded to the low oil prices by 
delivering an impressive improvement in efficiencies during FY 15-16 - both in 
terms of cost reduction (capex and opex) as well as optimization of well 
productivity. In this effort, they were helped by the sharp deflation in service 
costs. Going into FY 17, most of the low-hanging fruit had already plucked 
and cost savings were slowing. Given this, efficiency gains in FY 17 have 
inevitably moderated but overall performance continues to be solid. As a 
measure of progress during the year, we analyze how well E&P names have 
delivered on their start-of-year production/growth targets with the Q3 17 
updated guidance as measure of 2017 performance (see table below). The 
outperformance is quite evident for the oily peer group across the quality 
spectrum. 
Of the 16 oily names, 7 look set to deliver either (i) higher 
production (2-12% higher vs. original guidance) with capex unchanged or even 
lowered or (ii) similar production with sharply lower capex (eg: DNR capex 
budget taken down by 16%). BBG's guidance revision stands out - production 
target has been raised by 12% even as capex has been lowered by 4%. For 
another 4 names, both production and capex guidance have been revised 
(upwards, except for WLL) but we see the revised production-capex equation 
as more capital efficient. For example, WPX is currently targeting to grow oil 
production 12% above their start-of-year guidance with just a 9% increase in 
capex. For WLL, its production target is 4% below original guidance but the 
company has cut capex down sharply (by 14%) which we see as a net positive. 
Only for 4 names, the production-growth equation has been negative. Of 
these, OAS' case appears to be purely timing-related as exit rate production 
target has been maintained (FY 17E production target is down a modest 3%). 
That leaves us with just three names where there has been a genuine
