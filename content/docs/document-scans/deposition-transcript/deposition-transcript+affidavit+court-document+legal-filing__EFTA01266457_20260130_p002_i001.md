Trustees, by gift, by Will or by beneficiary designation, such additional property, including life 
insurance policies, as I may desire. Any such additional property shall be held on the same terms 
as are then applicable to the original Trust Estate, except that it may be transferred subject to 
conditions and provisions of special application to such additional property. 
Article II 
After My Death 
The following provisions shall apply after my death: 
Section 2.1. - Payment of My Debts and of Taxes and Expenses 
My Trustee shall pay from the principal of the Trust Estate (a) my debts, funeral and 
burial expenses and the administration expenses of my probate estate which are not paid by the 
Executors of my probate estate, and (b) the federal and state estate, inheritance, succession, 
generation skipping and similar taxes imposed by reason of my death which are the obligations 
of my Trustees (including any of such taxes which the Executors of my probate estate direct my 
Trustees to pay by written direction delivered to my Trustees). For purposes of this Section 2.1, 
the principal of the Trust Estate shall not include (a) any assets which are not included in my 
Gross Estate or (b) any assets which are not subject to, or available to creditors for the payment 
of, my debts, my funeral and burial expenses or the administration expenses of my probate 
estate. 
Section 2.2. — Specific Bequests and Devises under My Will and Trust 
If my probate estate is insufficient to satisfy all pecuniary bequests (or bequests payable 
in cash or in kind in the discretion of the Executors of my probate estate) provided in my Will, 
my Trustees shall pay such unpaid bequests from the principal of the Trust Estate. If my Will 
provided for a specific bequest or devise of specified assets and such bequest or devise could 
not be satisfied from my probate estate because such assets were held by my Trustees at my 
death, my Trustees shall distribute such assets to satisfy such bequest or devise. 
To the extent the assets of the Trust are insufficient to satisfy all bequests, I direct my 
Trustees to first pay all specific bequests in Article II, Sections 2.3(A)(12), (30), (31), and (32), 
and the bequest in Article II, Section 2.3(A)(33), then next comply with the provisions of Article 
II, Sections 2.3(A)(6), (17), (23), (24), (25), (26), (27), (28) and (29), and to the extent assets are 
insufficient to pay all of the remaining bequests in Article II, Section 2.3(A), then the 
beneficiaries of all such remaining bequests in Article II, Section 2.3(A) shall share on a 
proportionate basis in the remaining estate assets available for distribution. The determination 
of the Trustees as to the amounts distributable herein shall be binding on all parties. 
Section 2.3. - Bequests
