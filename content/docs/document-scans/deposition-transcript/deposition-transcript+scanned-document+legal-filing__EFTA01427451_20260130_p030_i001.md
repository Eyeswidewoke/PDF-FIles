but are still not at historical growth rates. We believe Untracked Channels 
have continued to grow at significantly higher rates than the overall 
market, as well as specialty channels. Wholesome Natural and Therapeutic 
market segments also continued to outperform the overall market in 
2014, growing at a rate of 14% and 5%, respectively. 
Doing Things the BLUE Way: Our Strategic Differentiation 
The Landscape We Found 
Pet food in 2002 was an established industry dominated by large CPG 
companies, offering a variety of brands made primarily with 
ingredients such as poultry by-product meals, corn, wheat and soy. Based on 
our conversations with many pet parents, we found that the vast 
majority of them did not read pet food labels and were often unaware of the 
ingredients they were feeding their pets, even though they were 
seeking natural foods and products for themselves and their families. A 
number of small natural pet food brands began to emerge in the 
neighborhood pet stores, led by entrepreneurs who often did not have the 
funding to build sizable businesses. In parallel, the pet food retail 
landscape had evolved significantly with the expansion of national pet 
superstores. These superstores carried a broad assortment of pet 
products and foods, anchored by Engineered brands but did not participate in 
the emerging Wholesome Natural market segment in a 
meaningful way. 
The BLUE Disruption 
We set out to challenge the status quo set by the incumbent brands. We were 
convinced that the Wholesome Natural market segment 
could become a large part of the industry due to a large unmet consumer 
demand for pet food with high-quality, natural ingredients. We have 
established our leadership position in the Wholesome Natural market segment 
through the strength and quality of our products, by broadly 
sharing our message to encourage pet parents to read ingredient labels and 
by pricing our products at a reasonable premium to Engineered 
brands. This approach was in contrast to our major competitors whose 
business models were tied to the mass production of Engineered brands. 
We committed to creating wholesome pet food made with whole meats, fruits 
and vegetables and other high-quality, natural 
ingredients that we feel good about feeding our own furry family members and 
to educating fellow pet parents about pet nutrition. We further 
distinguished our products by creating a two-part dry food, consisting of 
kibble and our trademarked LifeSource Bits that are cold-formed to 
help preserve the potency of vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. LifeSource 
Bits are more expensive and complex to manufacture, but we 
believe they provide significant benefits and create a visual point of 
differentiation when we talk to pet parents. We also combined advanced 
quality control and supply chain capabilities generally consistent with the 
standards required for human food industries with our deep expertise 
in pet foods. We believe these competitive advantages, together with our 
investments in our brand, have distinguished us from our smaller 
competitors in the Wholesome Natural market segment.
