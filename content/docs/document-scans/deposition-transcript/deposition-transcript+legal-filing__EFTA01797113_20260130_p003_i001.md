Instead, according-to information that is slowly leaking out, the Beidaihe meeting and other s=ssions 
beforehand in Beijing<=pan style="color: rgb(0, 66, 118); ">were especially tense 
<http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/02/wo=ld/asia/party-intrigue-seen-in-chinese-officials-apparent-demotion.html> . 
4,=804>The atmosphere was very bad, and the struggles were very intense,4=9D said a political analyst with 
connections to the party's nerve c=nter, the General Office. 
Mr. Hu, who has been criticized as having been an overly cautious and in=ffective leader during his 
decade in power, was also seen as defensive and g=oomy. 
A veteran party s.holar who attended the Beidaihe meetings said the leaders only met over a c=uple of 
days and finalized a list of more than 2,000 delegates to the congr=ss whose names were already public. A proposed list 
of new leaders was not c=rculated, however, and there was no deliberation of critical issues, like d=afts of the political 
blueprints to be unveiled at the congress, he s=id. 
"We though= that these issues would be settled there," he said, "but t=ey weren't." 
Given the absence of hard information from the government, it is possi=le that Mr. Xi's absence has 
been caused by something other than il=ness. The veteran party scholar, who dined late last week with a close fami=y 
member of Mr. Xi's, said the relative told him he did not know Mr= Xi to be sick. The scholar maintained that Mr. Xi's 
absence was mo=e likely because of the unsettled political situation. 
"There is still a struggle; it is n=t finished," he said. 
Most insiders say that they still expect Mr. Xi to re-emerge soon an= take over the top positions in the 
party and the government roughly on sch=dule. Two party academics who advise the government said Mr. Xi could 
make a=speech this weekend. Almost all the insiders said he should be healthy in t=me to participate fully in the 
Congress. 
But if Mr. Xi's sudden absence has been caused by=a serious illness, it raises the question of whether he 
will be strong enou=h to serve the two five-year terms expected of him when he emerged in 2007 a= a compromise 
candidate to lead the party. 
"This would be the worst-case scenario,"=said a senior official in a government research group with 
close ties to th= central government. "It would require a complete rebalancing of al= the competing interests." 
This is not to say that the transition has ground to a halt. Mos= of those who closely follow China's party 
politics are predicting t=at the powerful Standing Committee of the Politburo will be reduced to seve= from nine 
members in an effort to streamline decision-making, resolve fact=onal fighting over seats and rein in the power of 
China's well-fina=ced law enforcement apparatus. In addition, most seem to agree on all but o=e or two members of the 
probable leadership lineup. 
Not all, however, believe that this plan is se= in stone. The party scholar who attended the Beidaihe 
retreat said he had n=t seen any evidence confirming whether the Standing Committee would have se=en or nine 
members. 
So=e see the uncertainty as reflecting Mr. Hu's desire to retain influ=nce for as long as possible. It is 
unclear, for example, how long Mr. Hu wi=l stay on as leader of the Central Military Commission, a job that effectiv=ly 
makes him commander in chief. His predecessor, Jiang Zemin, retained tha= post for two years after stepping down as 
party secretary, but it appeared=for a while that Mr. Hu might bow to pressure to give that position to Mr. X= to help 
the new leader consolidate power.
