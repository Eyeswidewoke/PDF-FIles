But something else has changed very dramatically in the way your money =s flowing. Your spending has shot up, 
way out of proportion to the expense= we're aware of. It looks to us as if the money is just disappearing. You have 
enough money to support =he lifestyle you and Valeria have been living, but not enough to keep spen=ing at the rate 
you have been. 
We understand that it is distressing and even frightening to worry abou= the money running out. We can see 
why you are grasping for solutions like=considering disruptive lifestyle changes and looking for other sources of money. 
We know these decisions ar= ultimately up to the two of you to take, but they are not the solutions w= want for you. We 
don't want you to suffer the strain and dislocation;=and also we don't believe these small changes to your cash flow will 
solve the bigger problem of your startlingl= high spending rate. Some may even cost more money than they save.<=pan 
style="color:black"> 
We believe that you two -- while you are both brilliant at so many thin=s -- have never developed the practical 
skills of money management. Your t=oubles began when you stopped working cooperatively with the professionals who 
had always succeeded in h=lping you meet your goals in the past. We want you to find some financial =rofessional who 
can help you live your lives comfortably and free of finan=ial worry. They can help you outline your goals, both as two 
individuals and as a couple; show you what resourc=s you have; figure out if you have enough to meet your goals; figure 
out i= you have been spending money faster than you need to; and suggest the lea=t painful compromises you might 
make to save money, if that proves necessary after all. They can do this w=th utmost discretion. But you need to make it 
a priority to find the right=person, communicate promptly and openly with them, and take their advice s=riously. 
It pains us to see you trying to figure it all out on your own and comi=g up with horrifying and ineffective 
solutions. You should be enjoying you= life together and feeling confident about your futures. You've earned a lot of 
money through a l=fetime of hard work -- please get the help you need to use it effectively.=/span> 
You also need to make a clear decision about the role you want the rest=of your family to have in your financial 
affairs. The three of us would be=delighted to join you and your financial advisor in discussing the whole family's 
circumstances, incl=ding the history of your estate planning and the many gifts you've giv=n us. We used to discuss this 
regularly with Max and Bainco, and they woul= help us develop unified plans to meet the whole extended family's 
needs. Meetings like this don't requir= us to share all the details of our private financial affairs with each ot=er, the way 
one does with one's individual advisor -- but the more we =hare, the more opportunities we may find to help each other. 
It is up to you whether to continue this kind of open dis=ussion with us. 
=riting this letter is not something we are undertaking lightly. We are doi=g this because we are truly, deeply, 
concerned about your acute distress a=d about what this is doing to your relationships with your loved ones (especially 
us). 
Love, Avi, Diane and Harry
