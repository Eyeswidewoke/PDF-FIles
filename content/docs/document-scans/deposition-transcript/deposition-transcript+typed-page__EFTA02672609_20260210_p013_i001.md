What's =ore, if the shutdown lasts for more than two or three weeks, the Department of Veterans Affairs has 
said that it may not have eno=gh money to pay disability claims and pension payments. That could affect s=me 3.6 
million veterans. 
Women, Infants, and Children:</=> The Department of Agriculture has had to cut off support for the Women, 
Infants and Children program, which helps pregnant w=men and new moms buy healthy food and provides nutritional 
information and heal=h care referrals. The program reaches some 9 million Americans. The USD= estimates most states 
have funds to continue their programs for "a =eek or so," but they'll "likely be unable to sustain operatio=s for a longer 
period" — emergency funds may run out by the end of October. 
Rep. Rush Holt (D-N.J.) has a list of other possible ef=ects of a shutdown. Funds to help states administer 
unemployment benefits cou=d get disrupted, IRS tax-refund processing for certain returns would be suspended= farm 
loans and payments would stop, and Small Business Administration appro=al of business loan guarantees and direct 
loans would likely cease. 
=p class="">How is the city of Washington D.C. affected? 
D.C.'s garbage collection stops during a shutdown</=> 
Only if the shutdown goes on longer than a few weeks . In theory, the District of Columbia is supposed to shut 
down all but its most essential services during a government shutdown. But Mayor Vincent Gray =as said that he will 
label all city services "essential" and =se a cash reserve fund to keep everything going for as long as possible. 
Some background: The District of Columbia is the only cit= barred from spending funds during a federal 
government shutdown, save for arfew select services. During the 1995-'96 shutdown, the city was only abl= to keep 
police, firefighters and EMS units on duty. Trash collection and street sweeping came to a stop until Congress finally 
intervened. 
This time, however, the District is taking a more defiant stance. Gray has recently said that he will declare all 
city services "essential" and keep them running. And the city has $144 m=llion in funds to carry out services like trash 
collection and street sweeping for t=o weeks. If the shutdown drags on longer, however, it's unclear what will happen... 
How many federal employees would be aff=cted by a government shutdown? 
Half go home. 
=span styleefont-size:12ptline-height:107%;font-family:Georgia,serif">T=e government estimates that roughly 
800,000 federal workers have been sent home because of the government shut down. 
=p class="">That leaves about 1.3 million "essential" fed=ral workers, 1.4 million active-duty military members, 
500,000 Postal Service workers, and other employees in independently-funded agencies who will cont=nue working. 
Can you give me an agency-by-agency brea=down of the impacts? 
Yes. We've been compiling a deta=led list here at the Post, but here's a brief overview, showing how many 
employees are furloughed,=and examples of who stays and who goes: 
Department of=Commerce: 87 percent of the agency's 46,420 employees are be=ng sent home. (The Weather 
Service would keep running, for instance, but the Census Bureau wou=d close down.)
