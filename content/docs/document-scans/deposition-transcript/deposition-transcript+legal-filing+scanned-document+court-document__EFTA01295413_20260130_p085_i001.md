2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 40263, * 
On ri 1 n or about August 13, 2008, Gallion proposed a possible alternative method 
whereby Loadman could lease the real estate until the remediation was completed, at 
which time a new loan could be pursued for the real estate. (Doc. No. 35-1 at 428-29; Doc. 
No. 37 at 860-61.)x° Loadman testified it was his understanding that the lease alternative 
was intended "to expediate [sic] [the process] rather than waiting for all the other things to 
happen." (Doc. No. 37 at 860.) 
13 Regarding that suggestion. Ansell testified that both "the bank and the CDC were looking for ways to do the deal in the light 
of the environmental consideration." (Doc. No. 38 at 1048.) 
Loadman testified that, as late as August 14, 2008, however, Banco's in-house attorney, 
Kristina Rozek ("Rozek"), Banco's Wojtowicz, and the CDC's Ansell each assured him the 
original deal could still go forward, so long as he obtained a remediation plan, indemnity 
agreement, and escrow. (Id. at 869.) According to Loadman, Ansell purportedly further 
assured him that the SBA would not have a problem lending to him even without a "no 
further action letter" from the state. (Id. at 919.) Additionally, according to Loadman, Rozek 
told him she was in (9 8] charge of the closing, the closing was happening, and Gallion 
had no right to cancel the loan. (Id.) 
On August 19, 2008. Loadman emailed to Ansell and Banco a draft Limited Site 
Assessment ("LSA") report prepared by Allred Metal's environmental expert. Loadman 
stated that he wanted to purchase the Bethel Drive property because the draft LSA said it 
was clean. (Doc. No. 38 at 1052-53; Doc. No. 35-3 at 482.)" 
14 Both Banco and Ansell noted that the draft LSA did not, in fact. declare Bethel Drive dean. (Doc. No. 38 at 1049-50: Doc. 
No. 35-3 at 483.) Ansel added: "I don't believe SBA will approve anything until the Comprehensive Site Assessment (CSA) is 
performed and the extent of the contamination is known to include a determination about whether the Bethel property has been 
impacted and what the likely cost of remediation might be." (Doc. No. 35-3 at 483.) 
On August 25, 2008, Banco again explained to Loadman that it would not proceed with 
any real estate loan because of the environmental issues, but if he wanted to lease the 
property, he should provide the lease terms. (Doc. No. 37 at 863; Doc. No. 35-1 at 430-
31.) A few days later, Gallion explained the "current loan is withdrawn. If r 1 9] you put a 
new deal together we will respectfully consider." (Doc. No. 37 at 876; Doc. No. 35-1 at 
432.) Loadman never submitted anything to Banco showing he had obtained lease 
agreements or alternative financing for the real estate. (Doc. No. 37 at 877.) Furthermore, 
through the end of August 2008, the state had not approved a comprehensive site 
assessment, a corrective action plan, or the length of time, extent, and cost of remediation. 
(Doc. No. 35-5 at 499.) 
According to Ansell, plaintiffs also failed to meet other loan conditions, including a fully 
executed authorization for debenture guarantee from the CDC and SBA approval. Ansell 
testified that because of the failure to meet these conditions, the loans were never 
submitted to the SBA for approval and were never submitted to the CDC's credit 
committee. (Doc. No. 38 at 977-79, 1005, 1007.)* Subsequently, Loadman bought into
