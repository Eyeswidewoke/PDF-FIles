I am at a loss . Help me find a solution . I ask you to do something I believe I need. You choose 
not to to as I ask. If I ask again or point out that you have not done it you then say I am 
hurtful,mean,and rude. I usually say ok then I can't force you to , I love you ,have someone else 
do it 
Cooking-typing-hostcssing...shampoo buying and xxxxxcxc. You make a choice and then resent 
the necessary consequences. You choose not to do as I ask you always have what you consider 
to be a reason . I thanked you for your tuna sandvvgich , it was easy -you did as I asked I make a 
point to thank you . I can't say the same for you , when was the last time you said thank you fir 
anything to me.

I'm at a loss about what to do.. Your are my best friend I love you as much as you 
love me. , no matter what i say, it seems you do not understand the concept of 
consequences . You cannot make a deal, not complete your side and expect the deal 
is still in place.. IN the past i recognize that you and your parents have had difficulty. I 
am not your parents.. they tell you if you don't do something there will be 
consequences. you ignore, them, and get upset when the result is unpleasaant I have 
spent the entire day yesterday going through the house cleaning your mess. dog shit 
included,. 
I made it a point not to have any conflict with you before, you left. I 
REFUSE to live like this, You must think i am joking. You left with no food in the house. 
rotten food in the fridge , radishes with mold, rotten and green bread, though i told you 
on friday i did not want an nity fish tank on my desk, you chose, not to do anything at 
all, except tell me that 
will buyand chose Why because you were too busy. to 
go yourself Dead , smelly flowers, that i have repeatedly asked to be changed,left with 
dead 
over the table. Whole foods had plenty of choices of flowers . , You tell 
me its 
esponsibility to organize the food now that you are gone.. you didn't tell 
her anything...OWN is staying until wed,  i would have her stay the week but ghislaine 
needs her.. The magazines that i told you looked like a doctors office, you simply left 
month old magzines, for who. not me, . When I ask what did you do. , you get upset.. 
THIS IS BULLSHIT> people work , I work , I get up every day to work, YOU spend two 
hours making a soup and you feel your day is done. You serve me the shiftiest of
