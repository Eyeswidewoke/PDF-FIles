Subject: Follow up from your call with Jennie 
Hi. I spoke with Jennie about her call with you yesterday. She shared with me that the two of you agreed that 
the best way to accomplish our mutual objectives would be for Jennie to get all of the company's tax returns done and 
have you review them (and be comfortable with them), before any documents are signed, and that we should focus on 
doing the deal that she and Nathan always contemplated (i.e. being partners -- not a lender/borrower relationship). 
Makes sense to me too. 
Jennie tells me that all of the returns should be done in the next 4.5 weeks. As such, what I would like to 
propose is that we effectively start over and send you a proposed structure (chart and steps) that would assume (i) you 
have already seen all of the tax returns and (ii) having seen them, you are now comfortable proceeding. Once we 
mutually agree on a structure, we would immediately start to draft the documents to implement the structure (and 
most importantly, the new JV entity with Jennie and Nathan) and send them to you for your review. 
This approach would not only provide an expedited path toward a closing with you (rather than starting this 
process in 4-5 weeks), this also helps Jennie and me deal with RFR. If we have to tell RFR we are doing nothing for the 
next 4-5 weeks, as opposed to working on the documents to implement a closing -- they will be very difficult (and 
candidly, they can be unpredictable and even a bit irrational). As you would expect, we have been honest with them as 
to the reason for the delay in our transaction with you being due to the unknown tax risks, and based upon Jennie's calls 
with them, we believe they will understand that the path we would be taking (if you agree to it) is prudent and 
reasonable. 
Please let Jennie and me know if you agree with our suggested approach, and if so, we'll get you over our 
proposed structure chart and steps. 
As always, I greatly appreciate your thoughtfulness as to all of these matters. 
All the best, 
Rick
