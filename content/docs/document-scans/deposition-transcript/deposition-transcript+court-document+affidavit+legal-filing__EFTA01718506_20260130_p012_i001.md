With respect, encouraging these individuals to participate in the state sentencing will 
have the effect of creating a media frenzy that will surely impact the sentence Mr. Epstein 
receives — precisely what your Office promised to avoid. Such an intrusion into state affairs, 
when the identified individuals are not even victims of the crime for which Mr. Epstein is being 
sentenced is highly inappropriate. The federal investigation of Mr. Epstein has been concluded, 
and witnesses or civil claimants identified as purported victims of federal offenses have no place 
in the state proceeding. We also think it will likely promote spurious civil litigation against Mr. 
Epstein, a result that would be highly irresponsible to encourage. 
Fourth, we take serious issue with the assertion in the letter that the government has 
identified each recipient of the letter as a "minor victim." The term "minor victim" is notably 
absent from the Agreement. Section 7 of the Agreement states only that the government will 
provide a list of individuals "whom it has identified as victims, as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 2255." 
Indeed, you have told us that at least one identified individual is currently 24 years old, and thus 
would appear not to have been a minor at the time of the alleged conduct (and therefore is 
presumably not eligible to settle her claims under the Agreement). To confer on these women 
the imprimatur of a government "finding" is both incendiary and unwarranted. 
Fifth, your letter mischaracterizes the nature of Mr. Epstein's liability under the 18 
U.S.C. § 2255 provisions of the Agreement. Your letter states that every individual who receives 
the letter is a victim of "certain offenses, including travel in interstate commerce to engage in 
prostitution with minors and the use of facilities of interstate commerce to induce minors to 
engage in prostitution." This construction implies that these individuals are all victims of both 
offenses (travel in interstate commerce to engage in prostitution with minors and the use of 
facilities of interstate commerce to induce minors to engage in prostitution.) Clearly that is not 
the case. Consequently, the language should be revised to reflect that the identified individuals 
may be victims of certain offenses, but not necessarily both offenses. Additional) , for the sake 
of fairness and candor, we believe the same language contained in your letter to 
stating that "ft]he United States takes no position as to the validity of any such claim under this 
statute," should be included in any proposed letter. 
Sixth, your letter states that 
land Say 
"represent" the 
identified individuals. Since we have not yet had the opportunity to speak wither 
(though we hope to do so this week), we do not know that they will even agree to 
serve in this capacity. Since I believe the role you are casting for these attorneys creates a 
significant ethical problem, specifically the conflict between counseling the clients to settle for 
the statutory amount and rewarding the attorneys for litigating rather than settling their claims, I 
would not assume that they, or any ethical attorney, would agree to accept this assignment as you 
define it. Whether that will mean that other attorneys will have to be sought, or you will realize 
that the role is untenable as described, either result will require modification of the letter.
