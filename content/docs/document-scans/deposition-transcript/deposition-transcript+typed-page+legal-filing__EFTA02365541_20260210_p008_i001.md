Presidential contenders said to a man/woman that this incident showed the weakness of President Obama and h=s 
failed Iranian policies. 
To make matters more embarr=ssing Iranian State Television showed one or the U.S. sailors, "It was a mistake that was 
our fault and we apologize for our mistake,""It was a misunderstanding. We did not mean to go into Iranian territorial 
wate=. The Iranian behavior was fantastic while we were here. We thank you very much for your hospitality and your 
assistance.=E2** In the same Iranian television interview, the sailor said, "The Iranian patrol boat came out when we 
were having engine issues and had weapons drawn, so w= tried to talk to them until more boats came out and took us 
in."</=pan> 
=/p> 
As promised, the sailors, w=apons and vessels were released the next day and Secretary of State John Kerry credited 
diplomatic strength=and newly developed ties with Iran in helping secure the quick and safe release=of the sailors. 
"These are always situations as everybody here knows which have an ability, if not properly guided, to get out of 
control," Kerry said in a speech at the National Defense University. "I'm appreciative for the quick and appropriate 
response of the Iranian authorities." He said that "all indications suggest or tell us that our sailors were well taken c=re 
of, provided with blankets and food and assisted with their return to the f=eet earlier today." While Iranian official said 
that the incident was a learning moment. Iranian Foreig= Minister Javad Zarif, who has maintained open lines with Kerry 
and U.S. officials, made no mention of an apology in a tweet he sent after the sailors were released. "sappy to see 
dialog and respect, not threats and impetuousness, swiftly resolved =he #sailors episode. Let's learn from this latest 
example," Zarif=wrote. 
But as Rachelle Maddow poin=ed out, that now that this incident is over, obviously the good news is that all ten sailors 
are safe =nd that the Administration was able to get them freed quickly. And this =s credited to that there are now 
direct lines of communications between U.S. and Iranian diplomats, as well =s the good-will generated during the Iranian 
nuclear negotiations. This=is clearly a good positive. And yes, the release of the photos of U.=. sailors kneeling in 
surrender and videos of them eating on the floor could =e distasteful to some. But what is more controversial is, how on 
earth did this happened. 
Remember the initial explan=tion from the Pentagon, "is that at least one of the boats suff=red mechanical problems" 
that caused them to drift into Iranian wat=rs. Okay.... But did both of them breakdown? Later in the week Defense 
officials said, "The Navy has ruled out engine or propulsion failure as reason the boats entered Iranian waters." And 
since the sailors were put bac= on the same boats and sailed away on the same boats, it is easy to conclude that t=ere 
was nothing mechanically wrong with the boats 
Unless the Iranian=E244s spent all night repairing them.... Which is 
highly unlikely.... The Washington Post gets word that maybe the vessels ran out of gas.... Really.... And both boats? 
None of the explanation= make sense, so what were the U.S. sailors doing out there and why didn't they run, at least 
back into international waters, as these boats are faster than anything that the=Iranians have. So we don' know why 
they were where they were. And how the hell did they get caught... =/font>
