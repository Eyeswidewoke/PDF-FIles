Use of Computers by Sex Offenders 
We have historically warned our children about the dangers associated with strang-
ers, but often neglected to help them understand that sex offenders are often 
people they have come to know either in person or now online. Throughout his-
tory nonfamily members who sexually exploit children have frequented the places 
where children gather. Schoolyards, parks, and malls have been prime contact 
places. Offenders have also used technological advancements (e.g., cameras, tele-
phones, automobiles) to facilitate their sexual interests and behavior. Starting in 
the 1990s, home computers, online services, and the Internet have become new 
points of contact and technological tools. 
Although most of the offenders currently utilizing computers in their sexual 
victimization of children would generally be considered to be "acquaintance 
molesters," some might be family members and others might be strangers. Some 
of these offenders might also be sexually victimizing children without using com-
puters. For example they may also be sexually abusing readily available children, 
including their own, or trafficking in or collecting child pornography in maga-
zine, boolc, photograph, or videotape formats and utilizing the mail. Although it 
is the focus of this discussion, the focus of the investigation cannot be only on the 
computer. The computer is only a tool. Also, as the capabilities and availability of 
computers change, their role in the sexual victimization of children will also change. 
Some may wonder why a discussion of acquaintance molesters would 
include a section on the use of computers. That is because, like most acquain-
tance molesters, individuals attempting to sexually exploit children through the 
use of computer online services or the Internet tend to gradually seduce their 
targets through the use of attention, affection, kindness, and gifts. They are behavior-
ally like acquaintance molesters and best viewed as such for investigative and 
prevention purposes. They are often willing to devote considerable amounts of 
time, money, and energy to this process. They will listen to and empathize with 
the problems of children. They will be aware of the music, hobbies, and interests 
of children. Unless the victims are already engaged in sexually explicit computer 
conversation, offenders will usually lower any inhibitions by gradually introduc-
ing the sexual context and content. Some offenders use the computer primarily 
to collect and trade child pornography, while others seek online contact with other 
offenders and children. Some do both. Offenders who do either or both with a 
computer can also do either or both without the computer. 
Children, especially adolescents, are often interested in and curious about sexu-
ality and sexually explicit material. They will sometimes use their online access to 
actively seek out such material. They are moving away from the total control of 
parents and trying to establish new relationships outside the family. Sex offenders 
targeting children will use and exploit these characteristics and needs. Adoles-
cents may also be attracted to and lured by online offenders closer to their age 
who, although not technically "pedophiles," may be dangerous.
