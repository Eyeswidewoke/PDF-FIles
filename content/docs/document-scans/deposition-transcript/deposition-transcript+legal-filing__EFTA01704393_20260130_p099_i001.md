Important Sign & Travel and/or Extended Payment Option Information 
Finance Charges: Average Daily Balance (ADB) Method for Calculation of Finance Charges (FC): We use the 
ADB method to calculate FC on your Account. Under this method, we calculate the FC on your Account by apdying the 
Daily Periodic Rate (DPR) to the ADB (as described below) (including current transactions). To get the AUB, we (1) 
take the beginning balance for each day (including wiped FC from prevous billing periods), (2) add any new 
transactions, debits or fees, (3 subtract any payments or credits credited as 0' that day, and (4) make any appropriate 
adjustments. For each day a r the first day of the billing penbd, we also add an amount of Interest equal to the 
previous dayb daily balance mu/egged by the DPR. This gives us the daily balance for that day and the beginning 
balance for the next day. If this balance is negative, it Is considered to be zero Then, we add up, all the daily balances
the billing period and divide the total by the number of days in the billing period. This gives us the ADB. The ADB for 
a billing period will be considered zero if you paid the total New Balance, if any, shown on your previous billing 
statement by the Closing Date of the current tieng period. If you multiply the ADB by the number of days in the billing 
period and the DPR, the result will be the FC assessed, except for variations caused by rour.dng. This method of 
calculating the ADB and FC results In daily compounding of FC. The hformation cn page 2 of your statement
