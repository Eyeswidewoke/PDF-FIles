Still, when Falcone and five =ightSquared colleagues met over a meal of white-truffle pasta and =arolo at a Washington 
restaurant in January, they failed to come up =ith anything they could have done differently, according to a person =ho 
was there who asked not to be identified because the meeting was =rivate.

">Falcone said he's =pending a day a week in Washington and is trying to negotiate a =pectrum swap with the military or 
others that would eliminate the GPS =roblem. The Pentagon won't go along, said Walt Piecyk, an analyst at =TIG LLC in 
New York. 
"A swap of spectrum isn't a =ealistic option," Piecyk said. "First, there's nothing readily =vailable and second, if there 
was, that's spectrum that could be =uctioned off for billions in proceeds." 
Falcone said if the swap =oesn't work he'll try to negotiate with GPS manufacturers to put =ilters on their devices or to 
use the lower end of his spectrum. Or =here's the court. 
"If I have to, I'll put it =nto bankruptcy, I don't care." Falcone said. " I will maintain =ontrol." 
Falcone faces some of the toughest =reditors in the business, said Brad Baiter, head of Boston-based Baiter =apital 
Management LLC, which invests client money in hedge funds. Icahn =long with investors including David Tepper, head of 
hedge fund =ppaloosa Management LP, have bought about $300 million of LightSquared =ebt. 
'Alpha-Male Investor' 
"Icahn is a =ake-control, alpha-male investor," Baiter said. "Falcone is both =esperate and naïve if he thinks of Icahn as 
anything other than an =dversary who would wrest control of the spectrum if LightSquared went =nto bankruptcy." 
Icahn is nearing agreement to buy = 14.9 percent stake of Ferrous Resources Ltd., a closely held Brazilian =ron-ore 
producer, from Harbinger for 51.50 a share, four people =amiliar with the transaction said last week. That's about one-
third =f what Harbinger paid when it bought part of the firm in 2008. 
Falcone, who last year =rote down the value of LightSquared's spectrum by 59 percent and cut =t about 25 percent 
more in February, said the losses aren't forcing =im to change his lifestyle. He has a house on the Caribbean island of =t. 
Barts, owns a Gulfstream V jet and said he's planning to build a =orse farm on Long Island. 
Mark Baron, who has known Falcone =ince they grew up in Minnesota, said his friend always seems unfazed by 
=dversity. 
"When his father left, no one =new what was going on, and it didn't seem to affect him, though I'm =ure it did," said 
Baron, co-owner of computer-equipment provider =ompudyne in Duluth, Minnesota.
