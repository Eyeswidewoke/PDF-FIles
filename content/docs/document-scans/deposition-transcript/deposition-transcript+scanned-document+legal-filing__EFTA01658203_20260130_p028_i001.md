After the briefing, the President retweeted a White House post that quoted him as saying, 
"As one family, we mourn every precious life that's been lost. I pledge in their honor that we 
will develop a vaccine, and we will defeat the virus." Earlier Tuesday, Trump had tweeted, "You 
will never hear this on the Fake News concerning the China Virus, but by comparison to most 
other countries, who are suffering greatly, we are doing very well - and we have done things 
that few other countries could have done!" Trump also wrote on Twitter. "Tremendous progress 
being made on Vaccines and Therapeutics!!!" 
HHS Secretary Azar said on WLW-AMVi Cincinnati (7/21, 19K), "The President [Tuesday] 
night said that wearing face coverings is patriotic. We have said that from the outset with the 
President's guidelines on reopening. If we wear face coverings, if we close our bars, we see a 
real impact. Phoenix is turning around their infection rate to actually move into negative 
territory on the spread of disease by having people wear face covering and closing our bars. If 
we all do that...we have it in our hands to actually turn this around." 
White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said on Fox News' Hannity (7/21, 535K), 
"On March 31, this President was asked about masks. On March 31, he said if you want to wear 
a face covering, wear one. It does no harm. By all means, wear one. Three days later, the CDC 
came out with guidelines and instead of opposing face coverings and masks, they said it's 
recommended but not required. The President was ahead of the game, but guess who as 
behind the game? The White House press corps because a full month later when I did my first 
briefing - this is after the CDC recommendations - I looked around the room, no one was 
wearing masks. So it's very interesting to see the politically convenient White House press 
corps saying the President was against masks when that was never the case. He has always 
been open to it. It is the White House press corps that ignored CDC recommendations an entire 
month after they were issued." 
Reuters Analysis: White House Roiled By "Infighting And Tension" Over 
Pandemic. Reuters (7/21, Mason) reports, "Differences over how to fight the coronavirus 
pandemic have sparked infighting and tension within the White House, hampering its response 
as the death toll mounts and...Trump's approval ratings fall." According to "officials," there are 
"physicians on the White House Coronavirus Task Force, particularly its coordinator, Dr. Deborah 
Birx," who "are frustrated that warnings about rising cases are being ignored, and dismayed 
that Dr. Anthony Fauci, the renowned US infectious disease expert, has been demeaned and 
disparaged." Reuters also reports that "the decision to restart briefings came after tension 
between Trump's chief of staff, Mark Meadows, whose team took over leadership of the West 
Wing in March, and others in the White House, especially Vice President Mike Pence's team, 
about the right strategy for talking to the country about the pandemic." 
Politico (7/21, Orr, 4.29M) reports "a senior administration official said Trump's relatively 
disciplined performance was likely to neutralize objections that some aides had raised in recent 
days over allowing him to participate in televised coronavirus updates." Meadows, "along with 
senior adviser Jared Kushner and top officials on the president's reelection campaign, had 
previously urged him to tether his reelection message to the economy and other issues instead 
of constantly dwelling on the deadly virus." 
Axios (7/21, Knutson, 521K) reports "Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of 
Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN around 4 p.m. Tuesday that he" had "not been invited 
to President Trump's 5 p.m. coronavirus press briefing, and that he most recently spoke to the 
president last week." 
Cartoonist Says Trump Downplaying Dangers Of COVID-19 Is Part Of Election 
Strategy. Political cartoonist Ted RaII writes in the Wall Street Journal (7/21, Rall, 
Subscription Publication, 7.57M) that allegedly downplaying the dangers of COVID-19 may be a 
re-election strategy for Trump, because if there is a second wave during the fall elections, 
Republicans will be more likely to vote than Democrats. He also contends that there is greater 
enthusiasm among Trump supporters than among Biden supporters. He concludes that
