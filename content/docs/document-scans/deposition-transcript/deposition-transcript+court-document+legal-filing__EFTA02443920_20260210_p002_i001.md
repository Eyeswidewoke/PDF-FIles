One explanation for this is that it is inherent in our business that your former customers, 
when they determine to sell their homes, are your largest competitors. Because there 
were so few sales in the last half of 2007, 2008 and 2009, the market was much greater 
than normal, and buyers with the illusion of fear still in their hearts, looked for the most 
inexpensive, not necessarily the newest product. The bottom line is we should expect 
that South Padre Island sales will not be as good as projected, however, we can be certain 
that the baby boomers are aging one year at a time, that this is a high value, low cost 
middle class, pre-retirement/ retirement community, and that we are on the right side of 
history. 
While I don't want to confuse the atmosphere with a note of optimism, it appears more 
and more likely that the proposed causeway will proceed and that Holly Beach Road, our 
north boundary line, will be chosen as the access road to the causeway if it is built; it will 
therefore be four-lane, but not limited access. 
If the four-lane road is built on our northern property line, it will not only create long-
term substantial commercial potential, it will also isolate the Ocelot, if in fact there is an 
Ocelot, and make it easier for us to proceed to get restrictions from Fish and Wildlife 
lifted from our most valuable property. In short, South Padre is like so much in our lives, 
long-term excellent, short-term a disaster. 
2. 
Apes Hill Club — In January we had no contracts or reservations at Apes Hill. In 
February we had 6. We have projected 23 sales for the year. The last two weeks of 
February traffic was good and serious and there appears little reason to doubt that the 
unusual decision of requiring ownership of property at Apes Hill as a prerequisite for 
application for membership to the golf club, has been a successful decision. To-date we 
have at least 2 of our 6 new reservations or contracts buying only because of how 
important it is to them to be a member of Apes Hill Golf Club. 
It appears this momentum will continue into March, as the acceptance of our golf club is 
unprecedented in the history of Landmark. Those who have played it universally feel 
that it is the best in Barbados, the best in the Caribbean, and perhaps the best new golf 
course in the world. Martha and I leave early tomorrow morning for Barbados and if I 
learn anything different from what I have said, I will drop you a note. 
3. 
Hana — After 12 years of careful structuring of a plan that was approvable, we have 
agreement with the county to divide our approximately 130 acres of beautiful land in 
Hana into 14 lots and, by far the most important, these lots will be serviced by county 
water. You may recall that the ownership of this land is 45% Landmark, 45% Steve 
Manolis, and 10% Libbie Kamisugi. As always, it was the woman that did the heavy 
lifting and Libbie succeeded after years of effort to get this done. Landmark planned the 
subdivision and now Steve Manolis is taking the responsibility of marketing it. It is his 
hope to sell it wholesale, with a concept, to the new buyer of the Hotel Hana, if in fact the 
sale is closed, or to the present owner, if the sale is not closed. I believe that our interest 
is worth somewhere between $3,000,000 and $6,000,000.
