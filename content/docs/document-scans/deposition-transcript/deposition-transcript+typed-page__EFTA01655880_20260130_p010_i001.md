Minnesota Investigators Identify Baby Found Dead in Box 35 Years Ago 
CBS News (08/15, Moser) reported that Minnesota investigators on Thursday closed a decades-old case without 
filing charges. On April 23, 1989, a baby girl was discovered dead inside a box by the roadside in Santiago Township 
in Sherburne County. The case remained unsolved for more than 35 years as investigators were unable to identify 
the baby or her parents. According to the article, last year, Sherburne County investigators revisited the case with 
assistance from the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension and the FBI. Investigators say they were able to 
use DNA to identify the mother, who, in interviews, admitted to concealing her pregnancy and the birth from her 
family. She told authorities that the baby was not alive at birth and that, in a state of panic, she did not know how 
to handle the situation. The article mentioned that the original 1989 autopsy and re-examination done last year 
could not definitely determine if the baby had been born alive. Sherburne County officials say that two pathologists 
believe the baby was likely stillborn. Sherburne County Attorney Kathleen Heaney reviewed the case earlier this 
month before closing the case, citing the statute of limitations.

in the months before he was fatally shot. Amanda Bishop, of Kingston, and Byrd, of Lenoir City, were arrested 
Tuesday, the sheriff's office said in a news release. The article noted that the sheriff's office said in a news release

arrested Victor Martinez Hernandez, the man charged in the murder of Rachel Morin, a Maryland mother of five. 
Martinez Hernandez was taken into custody in June at a bar in Tulsa, Oklahoma, 10 months after Morin was found 
murdered off the Ma & Pa Trail in Harford County. The article stated that the video shows Martinez Hernandez 
being escorted out of the bar, put in handcuffs and into the patrol car. He was later extradited to Maryland where 
he is facing charges of first and second-degree murder, rape, sex offense and kidnapping. Investigators said they 
were tipped off that the Martinez Hernandez was in the Tulsa area after he fled Maryland. The article mentioned 
that the video starts inside a bar on a late Friday night in Tulsa when police and FBI agents approached Martinez 
Hernandez sitting at a bar. At first, Martinez Hernandez denied his crimes. Officers walked him outside and then 
asked to see his identification. But Martinez Hernandez told the officers he didn't have an ID and provided a fake 
name. Moments later, Martinez Hernandez was placed in handcuffs and into the patrol car after officers uncovered 
his real identity.
