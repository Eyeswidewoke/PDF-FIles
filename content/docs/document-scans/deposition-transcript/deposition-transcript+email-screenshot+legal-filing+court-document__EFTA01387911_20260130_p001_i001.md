B — Nature of Business: What do they do with the artwork? Do they purchase it and re-sell it? Does the trust only 
hold artwork as assets? — As per constitutional does, the purpose of Prytanee LLC is for engaging in the acquisition, 
ownership & management of artwork for investment purposes. I had already updated this but it seems they want 
more info on re-selling pan. Could you advise on this please?

This is hysterical. Private Art collectors are constantly buying and selling an work. They do whatever they 
please with it...put it on the wall, loan it to museums, keep it in the shipping box it came in. Artwork and cash to 
purchase the artwork are the only assets.

Please tell them to call me if they reject

C — Please check to see if there is a memo that was accompanied by Chip Packard's approval. If there is none. I 
recommend "refreshing" the approval with current senior management. The current c-mail approval does not 
address what exactly is being discussed and approved. — Kindly provide this please.
