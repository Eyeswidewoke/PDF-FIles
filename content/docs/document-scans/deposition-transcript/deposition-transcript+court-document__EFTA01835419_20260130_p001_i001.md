hi jeffrey, 
sorry for bothering with e-mails.. 
so we finished venetian plaster in master bedroom and the vestibule only. now the vestibule 
needs the design in top, but you are not sure yet about the sample. anyway i will finish that sample 
monday in the morning then you can decide and i can start the design in the vestibule. 
beside this i have to do cabana no3 (close to the pool) with those vertical lines.. and the 
bathroom with diamonds (brown bags color), and then there are two small rooms in the master 
bedroom in the between vestibule and the master bathroom, they need white venetian plaster. 
now, for the cabana no3, and the vestibule, i dont need help..if i keep my friend here i dont know 
what to give him to do.. otherwise i would have asked you for the begening that i need help. 
when i have to compose things like lets say those small blue cross lines like the sample i do for the 
vestibule in master bedroom, or even the verticals lines i have to do in cabana no3, or even the 
dimonds in its bathroom, i like to work alone..otherwise i get distracted..i cannot concentrate 
the only thing my friend can do is the venetian plaster in those small rooms in the master 
bedroom, and that would take one week for one person to do them or 2-3 days if two persons 
work, but we cannot do the venetian plaster in there because they are not ready for us. when i left 
before christmas garry told me they going to be ready at the begining ofjanuary, thats why i 
sgheduled my friend for one or two weeks of work. 
but then when we got here at the begening of this week and i i saw that those two small rooms 
arc not ready, i've i asked garry when are they finish the floor and instating the counter top and 
the sink , and he said is going to take one week to finish the floor and sanding and then they 
ordered the counter top and they will get it after after a week or two..so he said they will be done 
in two weeks. 
if i do venetian plaster before they finish instating the counter top, basebords etc, and sending the 
floor, then they will damage the walls. when you sand the floor it makes a brown-redish dust and 
gets stuck on the walls and you cannot remove that..you have to redo all the walls. 
anyway, after this talking to garry, i had to tell my friend that there is only one week of work, 
so he will go back saturday or sunday. after that he sheduled a job in new york for the next week, 
so now he has to be in new york monday morning. he works usually at the guggenheim museum 
as a freelancer, its his main job. 
sorry for this, and please let my friend to go back to new york tomorrow. 
thank you, 
ion
