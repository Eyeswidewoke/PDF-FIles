US Congress Approves Release of Epstein Files, Putting Matter Before President Trump 
Reuters (11/18, Morgan, McCaskill, et at) and The Associated Press (11/18, Groves) reported that the US Congress has voted almost unanimously 
to release Justice Department files on Jeffrey Epstein, with the House of Representatives passing the measure 427-1 and the Senate swiftly 
approving it. According to the articles, the bill is expected to be sent to President Donald Trump for his signature as soon as Wednesday, with a 
senior White House official stating that Trump plans to sign it. The articles noted that the release of the files is seen as a significant victory for 
survivors of Epstein's abuse, who have been fighting for years to hold those responsible accountable and to have the case files made public.

WABC (ABC-7) (11/18, Krauth) reported that the FBI is investigating a surge in cases linked to '764; a decentralized online extremist network 
that targets children on gaming platforms and social media, coercing them into violence or self•harm. According to the article, the bureau has

that involve harming our children by going after them online, causing self-mutilation, suicide, sexual abuse and steering them in the wrong
