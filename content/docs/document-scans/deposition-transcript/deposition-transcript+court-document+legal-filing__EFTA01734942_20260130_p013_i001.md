Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 
Draft — Not for Implementation 
366 
symptoms targeted by the drug (e.g., low sexual interest, desire, and/or arousal) and should be 
367 
supported by the proposed mechanism(s) of action of the drug, if known. Sponsors are 
368 
encouraged to discuss endpoint selection with the FDA early in drug development. 
369 
370 
The following outcome measures can be used as primary endpoints: 
371 
372 
• 
The change from baseline in the number of satisfying sexual events (SSEs) 
373 
• 
The change from baseline in the level of sexual interest or desire 
374 
• 
The change from baseline in the level of sexual arousal 
375 
• 
The change from baseline in the level of distress 
376 
377 
If a trial will use an endpoint of SSEs, the protocol and PRO instruments should define the term 
378 
satisfying and what activities will be classified as a sexual encounter. 
379 
380 
Baseline has been defined as a 4-week no-treatment phase or a 4-week placebo run-in period. 
381 
Changes from baseline typically refer to the treatment responses obtained during the last 4 weeks 
382 
of the double-blinded treatment period relative to the baseline. With this approach, the time 
383 
period used for assessing baseline status (e.g., 4 weeks) should be the same as the time period 
384 
used for assessing treatment responses (e.g., 4 weeks at the end of the treatment period). 
385 
However, one limitation is that this approach uses only a small portion of the efficacy data 
386 
collected during the treatment period. The FDA recommends alternative approaches that use a 
387 
greater portion of the efficacy data obtained during the course of the treatment period.

I. 
Primary and Key Secondary Endpoints 
390 
391 
The primary efficacy analysis should demonstrate a clinically meaningful treatment benefit that 
392 
is statistically significant. Sponsors should describe in detail what constitutes a clinically 
393 
meaningful change for each of the scales used in the trials and provide justification of the 
394 
selected clinically meaningful threshold to define treatment success. In clinical programs for 
395 
drugs intended to treat decreased sexual interest or desire, one approach is to assess the change 
396 
from baseline in SSEs and the change from baseline in sexual interest or desire scores as 
397 
coprimary endpoints," and associated distress as a key secondary endpoint. Similarly, in clinical 
398 
programs for drugs intended to treat decreased sexual arousal, one approach is to assess the 
399 
change from baseline in SSEs and the change from baseline in sexual arousal as coprimary 
400 
endpoints, and associated distress as a key secondary endpoint. 
401 
402 
However, it is important to note that the definitions for disorders of low sexual interest or desire 
403 
and low sexual arousal include associated distress and do not include a reduction in SSEs. For 
404 
this reason, comments received from two October 2014 public meetings have stated that 
405 
associated distress should replace SSEs as a coprimary efficacy endpoint for trials of drugs 
17 Multiple primary endpoints become coprimary endpoints when it is necessary to demonstrate an effect on each of 
the endpoints to conclude that a drug is effective.
