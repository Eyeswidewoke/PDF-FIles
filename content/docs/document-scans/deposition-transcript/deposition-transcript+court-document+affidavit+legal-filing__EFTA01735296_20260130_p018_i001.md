Against such criticism as remains of the Swedish prosecutor there is the mutual respect and confidence that this 
court has in the appropriate authorities of our European counterparts. This mutual respect underpins the whole 
framework of the European Arrest Warrant. Where there are ambiguities, and where there is a need for further 
information, this court almost always looks first to the judicial authority of the requesting state for clarification. 
That clarification is, in my experience, always accepted by the parties and the court. I recognise that others may 
have had different experiences, but that is undoubtedly rare. The starting point is that this court can rely on 
information supplied by the judicial authority, particularly in a European Union country. So I start with a strong 
presumption that Ms Ny is the best person to know why extradition is requested, and that she will provide the 
best and most reliable explanation. However, it seems to me that potentially such an explanation can be rebutted 
by other evidence. What is the other evidence here? 
Ms Ny is conducting a Preliminary Investigation which must end before a decision to prosecute is taken. Brita 
Sundberg-Weitman says that the EAW has not been issued for prosecution, but for the purposes of enforcing 
the order for detention. However her evidence is based on facts that are wrong. Shc confirmed that if the 
defence lawyer had told the prosecutor that he was unable to contact the defendant for interview, then the 
position would be different. When she gave her evidence she did not concede that it had happened like that. 
However we subsequently learned that she had been misled, or at the very least mistaken, about the factual 
position. This witness also said that in her view the real motive is that Ms Ny wants to arrest Mr Assange 
immediately after he is interviewed in Sweden, regardless of what he says. That sounds as if the motive is for 
prosecution, even in the form is irregular. She confirmed that she is not an expert on extradition. 
Sven-Eric Alhem emphasised the imperative for an early interview with the suspect of a rapt allegation. He said 
that if it was not possible to hold an early interrogation hearing than he too would have issued an EAW. Again 
his expert opinion is based on facts that in the event were wrongly stated. He had not been told of the efforts 
made by Ms Ny to arrange an interview in September. He told me that on the account given by Ms Ny it would 
have been a reasonable reaction to apply for F.AW. He too is not an expert on extradition, but it appears he has 
direct experience of the role of a prosecutor in Sweden. 
I am not helped by comments Ms Ny may have made before the warrant was issued. Her position may have 
changed over time, for example after Mr Assange did not present himself in Sweden for interview. 
It is clear that Ns Ny confirmed to the Australian ambassador in December 2010, after the EAW had been 
issued, that if a decision is made to charge Mr Assange, he and his lawyers will be granted access to all 
documents related to the case (no such decision has been made at this stage.) The decision to charge is not 
necessarily the same as a decision to prosecute. It is common ground that mere suspicion that an individual has 
committed offences is insufficient to place him the category of an "accused" person. There is no statutory 
definition of accused person, nor for this purpose is there any statutory definition of "prosecution". Given the 
diverging systems of law involved, that is not surprising. It is a question of fact in each cast whether the person 
passes the threshold of being an "accused" person who is wanted for prosecution. It is accepted by all parties in
