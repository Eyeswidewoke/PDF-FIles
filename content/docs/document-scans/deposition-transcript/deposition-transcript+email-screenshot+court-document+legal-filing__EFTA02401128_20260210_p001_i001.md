Re: 
First of all, I am really sorry and I apologize=if at times I didn't manage to show how grateful I am for everything y=u 
have done for me. I apologize for my mistakes, my bratish behavior and i= I haven't followed the right directions. Even if 
you don't see it=that way, I haven't taken your help for granted, I know it is extraord=nary and I will always feel indebted 
to you in some way, no matter what ha=pens now. 
I understand you be=ng angry and disappointed at me, I won't try to make excuses for mysel=, I only want you to see 
things from my perspective and maybe get a bit of=what's going on. I am deeply frustrated for not being able to choose 
a=life path and build a stable future for myself. It's part of my person=lity to escape from things and blame outside 
circumstances, but deep insid= I know the problems are in my head. There is a huge range of possibilitie= ahead of me, 
and I realise I am lucky to be in a relatively good position=to pursue any of them, but I get dizzy, scared, confused and in 
the end I&=39;m somehow incapable of taking real steps into one of them. This year I =ave been working harder, I'm 
trying to manage my image more efficientl= and I really did my best when interning for 
but my mental blo=kage is 
still there and I can't really see a way out of it. I know you=have given me directions, but I needed closer guidance and 
support. I am n=t saying you owed it to me -you have done more than enough!-, or that your=directions weren't good, 
but maybe I'm not as strong or as smart a= you are to succeed in life by myself, at least at this first stage. No on= has the 
right to expect this from anyone, and as I said your monetary sup=ort is extraordinary. Whenever I've acted childishly or 
rebellious (I =ave trouble finding the right words) I was only hurt because I felt you di=tant, cold or indifferent... I wanted 
to see you more often, talk to you m=re, being able to share my dreams, my struggles and my fears. I ended up d=iving 
you away when I only wanted you closer to me. I blame no one but mys=lf, I should have been more open about my 
feelings and tried harder to fol=ow your advices, instead of rebelling against them if I didn't feel yo= close enough. I 
know it now and I understand that you've lost your pa=ience with me. I sometimes loose hope on myself as well... I 
underst=nd it is up to me to solve my situation and stand up on my own feet, thoug= I will rely on the directions you've 
given me with a new approach. Yo= won't be there anymore, and apart from the obvious economic inconveni=nces, it is 
the certainty to have a sort of stable rock next to me where l=could rely on that I will miss more. I wanted to have you 
closer to me, bu= not having you at all from now on will make me cherish what I had. Thank =ou a thousand times for 
everything you've done for me
