Payments: Payments received after 12:00 noon may not be credited until the next day. Payments must be sent to the 
payment address shown on your statement and must include the remittance coupon from your statement. Payments must 
be made with a single check or draft drawn on a US bank and payable in US dollars, or with a negotiable instrument 
payable in US dollars and clearable through the US banking tydem, or through an electronic payment method payable in 
US dollars and clearable through the US banking system. Your Account number must be inc. ded on all payments. If 
payment does not conform to these requirements, crediting may be delayed and additional Charges may be imposed. If we 
accept payment made in a foreign currency, we will choose a conversion rate that is acceptable to us to convert your 
payment into US dollars,. unless a particular rate is required by law. Please do not send post-dated checks. They will be 
deposited upon receipt. Our acceptance of any payment marked with a restrictive legend will not operate as an accord and 
satisfaction without our express prior written approval. Authorization for Electronic Debit: We wift process checks 
electronically at first presentment and any re-presentments, by transmitting the amount of the check, routing number, 
account number and check serial number to your financial institution, unless the check is not amasser:to electronically or a 
less costly process is available. By submitting a check for payment you authorize us to initiate an electronic debit from your 
bank or asset account. When we process your check electronically, your payment may be debited to your bank or asset 
account as soon as the same day we receive your check, and you will not receive that cancelled check with your bank or 
asset account statement. If we cannot coiled the funds electronically we may issue a draft against your bank or asset 
account for the amount of the check. Authorization for Electronic Payments: By using Pay By Computer, Pay By Phone 
or any other electronic payment service of ours you will be authorizing us to initiate an electronic debit to the financial 
account you specify in the amount you request. Payments received after 5:00 p.m. MST may not be credited until the next 
day. Allocation of Payments and CredIts: Subject to applicable law, we will apply and allocate payments and credits 
among Features and Charges on your Account in any order and manner determined by us in our sole discretion. Finance 
Charges: Average Daily Balance (ADB) Method for Calculation of Finance Charges (FC): We use the ADB 
Method to calculate FC on your Account. Under this method, we figure the FC on your Account by applying the Daily 
Periodic Rate (DPR) to the ADB (as described below) for each Feature (including current transactions). Different daily 
periodic rates may be a Wied to separate Feature balances. To get the ADB for each feature, we (1) take the beginning 
balance for each day (inWuding unpaid FC from previous billing periods) (2) add any new transactions, debits, or fees (3) 
subtract any payments or credits, and (4) make any appropriate adjustments. For each day after the first day of the billing 
period, we also add an amount of interest equal to the previous day's daily balance multiplied by the DPR for the 
Feature. This gives us the daily balance for the Feature for that day and the beginning balance for that Feature for the next 
day. If this balance is negative, it is considered to be zero. Then, we add up all the daily balances for the Feature for the 
billing period and divide the total by the number of days in the billing period. This gives us the ADB for the Feature. For all 
Features the ADB will be considered to be zero if you paid the total Account balance,. if any, shown on your previous 
month's statement by the Closing Date of the current billing period. If you multiply the AD B for each Feature by the number 
of days in the billing period and the DPR for that Feature, the result will be the FC assessed on that Feature except for 
variations caused by rounding. The total FC for the billing 
riod is calculated by adding the FC assessed on all Features of 
the Account. This method of calculating the ADS and FO results in daily compounding of FO. Transactions Made in 
Foreign Currencies: If you incur a Charge in a foreign currency, it will be converted into US dollars on the date it is 
processed by us or our agents. Unless a particular rate is required by applicable law, we will choose a conversion rate that 
is acceptable to us for that date. Currently, the conversion rate we use for a Charge in a foreign currency is no greater than 
(a) the highest official conversion rate published by a government agency, or (b) the highest interbank conversion rate 
identified by us from customary banking sources, on the conversion date or the prior business day, in each Instance 
Increased by 2%. This conversion rate may differ from rates in effect on the date of your charge. Charges converted by 
establishments (such as airlines) will be billed at the rates such establishments use. Billing Rights Summary:  In Case of 
Errors or Questions About Your Bill: If you think your bill is incorrect, or if you need more information about a 
transaction on your bill, write us on a separate sheet of paper at the Customer Service address noted to the right. We must 
hear from you no later than 60 days after we sent you the first bill on which the error or problem appeared. You can 
telephone us at the number indicated on the frontof this statement, but doirgso will not preserve your rights. In your letter, 
give us the following information: 1. Your name and account number; 2. The dollar amount of the suspected error; 3.

not have to pay,any amount in question while we are investigating, but you are still obligated to pay the parts of your bill that
