This course will survey major developments in mostly American and European visual art from the 
end of World War II to the present. At the start of the course, students will be introduced to the 
main artistic terms and problems set up by the 'high' modernism of abstract expressionism. We 
will then examine the challenges to modernism posed by pop art minimalism. photography and 
video. and performance and conceptual art in the 1960s and 19705. As the course proceeds. we 
will narrow our focus to track certain problems set up by these postmodern practices as they are 
developed by artists in the 1980s and 1990s. including: the photomechanical challenge to 
painting and the unique touch of the artist's hand: the unsettled objecthood of photography. 
performance, and text-based work: the tension between art and document or making and 
recording; authorship, identity (including gender, race, and sexuality), commodification, and 
appropriation: the shift from medium specificity to the expanded fields of the physical. 
environmental, social, and political context of the artwork and its maker. Students will conclude 
the course with a research paper based on a work currently on view in the city. Time permitting, 
class trips to relevant current exhibitions may be arranged; previous familiarity with the history of 
modem an is encouraged but not required.

CRN 7177 Sec A 
The course offers a history of modern and contemporary art through the framework of art and 
labor. the various relationships between art and labor, the changes in the conditions of artistic 
production as well as the transformations in the measure/value of artistic tabor. Students address 
artistic representations of work as well as different figurations of the artist as worker. as 
nonworker, as out-of-work. If the Lumnine brothers' Workers Leaving the Factory (1895) Is the first 
film in the history of cinema, we will also ask what happens after the leaving of the factory: the 
time-space of reproduction and care, of work that is overlooked and undervalued (for example. 
women's work*); of the refusal to work, of strike, sabotage, or anti-work politics and post-work 
imaginanes: of the displacement of the factory and the assembly-ll ne as the primary mode of 
production. Students address how artists have worked with and against the effects of the 
restructurations of capital and social/technological transformations that have changed the very 
conditions of production, especially the supposed shift from a Fordist to post-Fordist economy: the 
blurring of the distinction between work and life. the Increasing Importance of what has been 
called immaterial, communicative. or affective labor. as well as the overall dismantling of the 
security and stability of work in general. As we analyze the transformations of the affective 
composition of labor. pointing to the current fear and anxiety of wearily. unemployment, debt. we 
will underscore labor not only as a matter of economics but also power and subjection: the 
subjective effects of labor, the timespace of the body in relation to labor, the working body. the 
reproductive body, the fatigued body, the body at rest, the idling or drifting body. the body on 
strike. This history of art will be studied alongside different histories and theories of labor. Seminar 
discussions will be supplemented with screenings. visits to galleries and museums. participation in 
artists' talks.
