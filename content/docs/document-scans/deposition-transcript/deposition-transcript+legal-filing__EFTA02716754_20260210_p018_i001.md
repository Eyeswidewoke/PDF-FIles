the Nazis with the Treaty of Versailles. Germany — having surrendered in 1918 — was forced to sign a treaty which 
included Ge=many taking the blame for World War One, reducing territories, agreeing to disarm and significantly 
diminish the military, and agreeing to pay roughly 6.6 billio= pounds in reparations. The German people felt this was 
unduly harsh, and developed a deep-set resentment of the Alli=d victors of WW1 for dealing them this intense 
punishment leading to the rise=of the Nazis and Hitler who promised to reestablish Germany back to its rightf=l position. 
Although Ronald Reagan never claimed to have bested the Soviet Union and wining the Cold War. Neocons like to point 
to Reagan saying, "Tear down this wall,"<=i> as if that kind of rhetoric is effective and somehow caused the coming apart 
of the So=iet Union. When in fact, that speech was made in 1987, but the wall didn't come down until years later after 
the=first President Bush refused to make aggressive statements about Gorbachev, who w=s then able to quietly 
withdraw support from Eastern Europe that led to the a=d of the Berlin Wall. The neocons simply misrepresented what 
happened and claimed that Reagan had followed their approach in dealing with the So-viet Union. This political rheto=ic 
taken out of context is both myth and the result of malice and intellectual laziness.

Indeed, the very=idea that there was a winner of the decades-long rivalry between the superpowers was a political 
formulation ra=her than one based on the historical facts. The notion that the United States forced the collapse of the 
Soviet Union and vanquished communism is not onl= a myth but a dangerous canard, Jack Matlock says in his new book, 
Super=ower Illusions: How Myths and False Ideologies Led America Astray—and Ho= to Return to Reality. Matlock was 
a U.S. ambassador to the U.S.S.R. during the Reagan and George H. W. Bush administrations. 
Because Americans are prone to repeating this line, that the Soviet Union lost, there is a widespread belief in Russia of 
the myth that Gorbachev was tricked by Reagan and Bush Sr. to give away the store and tha= ever since, the U.S. has 
been set on turning Russia into a colony fit only =or supplying cheap energy and raw materials. In the U.S., the collapse 
o= the Soviet Union was seen as a military victory, which led to a spirit of triumphalism and a feeling of omnipotence as 
the "sole superpower." If the U.S.S.R. has indeed been brought to its knees by military pressure, then this would =ean 
that the U.S. has the means to take down any ideology or political system i= finds dangerous or repugnant. Other 
countries drew this conclusion, too: If a country had a problem, then the U=S. was expected to set it right.

The truth is that the Soviet Union didn't coll=pse because of external pressures. Nor did the Cold War end with the 
collapse of the Soviet Union. It ended because of a nego=iated settlement that was potentially to the benefit of both 
sides. Communist rule end=d because Mikhail Gorbachev maneuvered it out of exclusive power. It was Gorbachev who 
ended Communist rule. He did it in the Soviet Union's own interest. The people who present=it as a victory of one 
country over another are incorrect, but it was the victory of one idea over another. This idea that somehow the U.S. 
beat the Soviet Union has led to failed policies from Washington but also misunderstandings from other countries, 
particularly the Russians.</=>
