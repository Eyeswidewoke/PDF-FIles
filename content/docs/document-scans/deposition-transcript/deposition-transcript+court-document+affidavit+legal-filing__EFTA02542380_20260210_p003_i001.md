I have repatedly spelled out the circumstances in extensive detail. Your sole response has been that you 
disagree, without once saying what you disagree with or why. I have never denied anything you have tried to say, for 
the simple reason that you have never said anything that could either be affirmed or denied, only that you disagree with 
what I've spe=led out but without any indication of what or why. 
In this letter, for the first time, you specifically address something I have written. You write: "We can tell from 
your tax requests that you have been spending many hundreds of thousands of dollars every year on personal expenses, 
even after having successfully eliminated the extra costs that you have mentioned as a drain on your resources (the 
Cape house, the gifts, Anthony's salary, etc).&q=ot; What I wrote you however is quite different. To repeat: there is a 
mandatory withdrawal from the IRA. Half of that was distributed to children, grandchildren, and spouses. The other 
half was spent in taxes and management fees for the entire estate. Cape house, Alex&=39;s medical expenses and other 
gifts, Anthony's salary, etc., were from nec=ssary withdrawals over and above the mandatory withdrawal, hence subject 
to exorb=tant taxes, requiring additional withdrawal. That is before we even get to ordinary living expenses. The 
request had nothing at all to do with personal expenses, as you can see by just looking at my letters and running through 
the arithmetic. So the one case you now mention is flatly incorrect. 
But this tells us how to proceed: tell me explicitly what you have in mind, and then we can proceed in a 
reasonable fashion. 
There's a simple way out of this impasse -- not by setting up an advers=ry proceeding with a mediator, as you 
suggest, but by you telling me what you disagree with in what i have outlined to you and what your reasons are. You 
have not yet done that in a single letter. So, simply, why not do it right now, and then we can proceed. 
Again, I've repeatedly spelled out the circumstances in extensive detai=. So, simply, tell me what you disagree 
with and why. No mediators are necessary, just a direct response. Or if you feel that you have already done so, then re-
send the letter in which you responded to my detai=ed account, telling me what you disagree with and why. 
Meanwhile, while the impasse continues, I'm compelled to face constant aggravating and painful circumstances, 
not to speak of humiliating demands and by now significant costs. That can end if we simply resolve these matters 
quickly in a straightforward and simple way. 
I haven't responded to the last part of your letter because it doesn1=3 relate to the matter at hand. I was 
referring to Max's radical sh=ft in stand, not to how affairs were managed in the past. To repeat, when distributions 
were made to family from the IRA, and taxes and manageme=t fees for the entire estate were drawn from the IRA --
exhausting the mandat=ry withdrawal -- Max, my lawyer, raised no question about the financial circum=tances of the 
beneficiaries, nor should he have done so. But when i am requesting tax payments from the marital trust that was set up 
for M and me and the survivor for our lifetimes, all of a sudden he is making exorbitant and humiliating demands. What 
you describe below has nothing to do with this simple matter.
