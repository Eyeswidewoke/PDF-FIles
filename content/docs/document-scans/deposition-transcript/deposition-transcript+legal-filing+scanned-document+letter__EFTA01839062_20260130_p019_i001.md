the room after he had departed at 12:26 PM. We know the door was locked because Diallo 
swiped her key to re-open the suite at 12:26 PM. Aside from Diallo, the only other employees to 
use their electronic keys to enter the room was the head housekeeper, who entered the suite at 
12:38 PM, along with Diallo, according to her statement, and the head engineer, who entered the 
suite at 12:45 PM and a second time at 12:51 PM. But none of these employees reported seeing 
the phone. Nor did the police who then entered the suite. 
The other possibility is that the phone was taken before DSK had left the presidential suite. 
Since it is a large 4 room suite— pantry, dining room, living room, and bedroom— it cannot be 
ruled out that someone else was in the suite, possibly even before Diallo had entered at 12:06 PM. 
That person could have taken the phone from his briefcase or elsewhere while he was getting 
dressed, and had it somewhere in the Sofitel. In that case, the phone would continue out sending 
GPS signals from the hotel until it was disabled at 12:51 PM. 
Whoever took it, the vanished phone has never been found. We don't know who took the 
phone from the room, when it was taken, or why it stopped sending GPS signals at 12:51 PM.. 
Chapter VIII 
Key Mysteries 
The Sofitel hotel, like many modem hotels, has high-tech electronic locks on its guest rooms. 
Electronic cards are issued to both employees and guests. To open a locked room, a guest or 
employee swipes this key card in the lock. It then records the time the time of entry to the nearest 
minute and the card's registration number. The time of entry is then stored in the hotel's computer 
along with, if it's an employee, his or her name and department. The computer printout, which is 
available to the hotel's managerial and security staff, would therefore reveal the times (within a 
minute) that anyone entered with a key the presidential suite and the rooms across from it, 
including room 2820, on May 13" and May le 2011. 
This key records provide a temporal map of the activities in the presidential suite. DSK had 
arrived at 7:13 PM on May Ir. Afterwards, only 5 people entered the suite. One was DSK, who 
had gone out for dinner, and re-entered the suite at 1:53 AM. As the lobby CCTV cameras 
showed, he was with a blond woman, who left two hours later. The four other people who entered 
on May le, were the room service waiter Hague, who used his key at 12:05 PM, the maid Diallo, 
who used her key three times between 12:06 PM and 12:16 PM, the head housekeeper Markozina, 
who used her key at 12:38 PM, and the head engineer Yearwood, who used his key twice, once at 
12:45 PM, and once at 12:51 PM. 
The key records for room 2820 across the hall show that on May le , aside from the guest, 
only Diallo used her key to enter the room prior to the arrival of the police, and she did so 4 times. 
If these tell-tale records had been available to the prosecutors when they first questioned 
Diallo, the case might have taken a different direction . But the prosecutors did not obtain them 
until more than a month later for reasons that remain unclear. When analyzed, they produce three 
intriguing mysteries.
