"One of the great things about =ognitive science is that it allowed us to continue that seamless =ntegration of the 
sciences, from physics, to chemistry, to biology, and =hen to the mind sciences, and it's been quite successful at doing 
this =n a relatively short time. But on the whole, I feel there's still a =ailure to continue this thing towards some of the 
social sciences such =s, anthropology, to some extent, and sociology or history that still =emain very much shut off from 
what some would see as progress, and as =urther integration."

Jennifer Jacquet: =Shaming At Scale" 
"Shaming, in this case, was a fairly low-cost form of =unishment that had high reputational impact on the U.S. 
government, and =ed to a change in behavior. It worked at scale—one group of =eople using it against another group of 
people at the group level. This =s the kind of scale that interests me. And the other thing that it =oints to, which is 
interesting, is the question of when shaming works. =n part, it's when there's an absence of any other option. Shaming is 
a =ittle bit like antibiotics. We can overuse it and actually dilute its =ffectiveness, because it's linked to attention, and 
attention is =inite. With punishment, in general, using it sparingly is best. But in =he international arena, and in cases in 
which there is no other option, =here is no formalized institution, or no formal legislation, shaming =ight be the only tool 
that we have, and that's why it interests =e."

Simone Schnall: "Moral =ntuitions, Replication, and the Scientific Study of Human =ature" 
"In =he end, it's about admissible evidence and ultimately, we need to hold =11 scientific evidence to the same high 
standard. Right now we're using = lower standard for the replications involving negative findings when =n fact this 
standard needs to be higher. To establish the absence of an =ffect is much more difficult than the presence of an =ffect."

"What all these =ifferent things boil down to is the idea that there are future =onsequences for your current behavior. 
You can't just do whatever you =ant because if you are selfish now, it'll come back to bite you. I =hould say that there 
are lots of theoretical models, math models, =omputational models, lab experiments, and also real world field data 
=rom field experiments showing the power of these reputation =bservability effects for getting people to cooperate."
