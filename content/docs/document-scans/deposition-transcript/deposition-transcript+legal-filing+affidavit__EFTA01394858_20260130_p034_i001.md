This Mt serves as an EDR for Aromatiss S.A.S (herein referred to as accountholder), an 
existing Wealth Management client since April 2018. 
This EDR included the following changes: 
(1) The addition of 3 UBOs, as beneficiaries of the Opus Futurus Foundation. 
(2) Update to loan signatories (per attached borrowing resolution). 
(3) Legal name change for an 18O: Cosmos Enterprises SLU changed its name to Cosmo 
International Fragrances, S.L.U. 
Risk Factors Include: 
• PEP Relationship: The UBOs are Relatives or Close Associates (RCAs) of a PEP due to their 
relationship with Gonzalo Aguirre Arriz. one of the founders of Coordinadora Nacional de 
Independientes. a political party established in Peru. Mr. Arriz is married to Janine Marion 
Belmont Dauelsberg. The PEP status was previously escalated (see attached escalation) 
• Source of Wealth (SOW )Industry: Juan Fernando Belmont Anderson (U8O) created 
Corporacion Yanbal International, a cosmetics company in Latin America. SOW Verification has 
been obtained. 
• Complex Structure: The ownership structure consists of multiple intervening layers. 
Below are the reasons why we are comfortable with approving this KYC: 
• Information and supporting documents required by our AML Policy were provided and 
reviewed: and as a result, we have an understanding of the structure of the accountholder, its 
purpose, the purpose of the account and expected activity. 
• The SOW was sufficiently detailed and appears plausible. Internet searches provided enough 
information to support the wealth for the prospective account holders and UBOs. 
Below are the risk factors associated with the accountholder-
• Our review did not identify any red flags and thus there was no need to escalate this case 
further. 
• Due diligence searches were performed on all key and the names searched were not on any 
sanctions lists 
• The UBOs and a legal rep/signatory appeared in the ICIJ Database as being linked to Paradise 
Papers. However, the appearance of the name in ICIJ database alone does not require 
escalation if there is no other negative information that presents significant or material 
reputational risk. There was no adverse media on the account holder, UBOs, or legal reps to 
warrant further escalation.

The August 2018 Fircosoft alert generated for Jesus Armando Lema Hanke is the same alert 
generated in April 2018, when the account holder was on-boarded. B1.AFC-WM previously 
reviewed and cleared the alert. The prior clearance (from April 2018) is attached to the KYC and 
covers the current alert.
