Impact from Tragic events of 1011/1/. Based on commentaries from several 
management teams, we believe that the impact from the tragic mass shooting in 
the Strip could have a modest short-term impact and thus we don't expect it to 
hinder the prospects of the city. We note that MGM's management noted that 
bookings declined immediately after October 1 because the company suspended 
its outbound marketing programs. Management also noted that they saw a spike 
in non-group cancellations (more than double than what they normally see). 
However, they noted these cancellations progressively subsided by mid-October 
and the booking pace returned to normalized levels after the company resumed 
its marketing efforts. Of importance, Mandalay Bay was the exception, as the 
company felt it was appropriate to reinstate marketing programs at a slower pace. 
Macau .- GGR Growth to Continue in 2018 
We expect Macau to end 2017 with higher GGR of $33.3 billion (+19.2% 
versus S27.9 billion). In our view, the primary drivers of the market expansion 
were: (1) the resurgence of the VIP segment, which was driven at least in part 
by the expansion of small-and-mid-sized junkets; (2) the improvement of the 
Chinese economy, which was largely driven by strength in the housing market 
(Tier-3 cities); and (3) the impact from new supply, which has driven 
incremental visitation. We believe these factors have contributed to make 
Macau a more appealing destination for both gamblers and leisure travelers. 
Looking into 2018, we anticipate GGR should increase to $37.0 billion (+11.0% 
versus $33.3 billion) owing to strength in both the mass market and the VIP 
segments. On a segmented basis, VIP revenues are expected to increase to 
$21.4 billion (+11.5% versus $15.6 billion). We believe growth in the segment 
will be supported by new VIP room openings from the Big 4 junkets. Turning to 
the mass market, we anticipate GGR to increase to $15.6 billion (+103% versus 
$14.1 billion). In our view, the increase in mass gaming revenue will be driven 
by incremental visitation, which will benefit from the opening of new supply.
