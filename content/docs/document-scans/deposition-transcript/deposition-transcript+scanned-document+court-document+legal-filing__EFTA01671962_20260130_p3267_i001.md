Important Changes to Your Account Terms 
The following is a summary of changes to important terms of your account. The detailed changes to your 
Cardmember Agreement appear on the reverse side of this page. 
How to avoid the change to Paving Interest on Pay Over Time features: You have the right to reject this 
change. If you do, your enrollment in these features will be cancelled and you will not be able to extend payment 
on any new transactions. If you reject this change, it won't apply to your Pay Over Time balance and you'll still be 
able to pay it down over time. To reject this change call us at 1-855-865-1451, or from outside the U.S. or 
Canada call us collect at 1-336-393-1111. You must reject this change no later than 5pm Eastern time on 
May 11, 2012. 
Revised term effective May 12, 2012 
Paying Interest 
(on Pay Over Time 
Features) 
If you have a Pay Over Time balance, your due date is at least 25 days after the 
close of each billing period. We will begin charging interest on transactions added to 
a Pay Over Time balance as of the date they are added. However, we will not charge 
interest on charges added to a Pay Over Time balance automatically (for example, 
Sign & Travel and Extended Payment Option) if you pay the Account Total New 
Balance by the due date each month. 
Additional information about the change to Paving Interest: We are changing when we charge interest on 
Pay Over Time features. If you pay in full each month, this change will not affect you. If you pay balances over 
time and then pay in full, we will charge interest until the day we receive your payment. Previously, we would not 
have charged interest (except for new Select & Pay Later transactions) in the month you paid your balance in 
full. This means you will pay more interest on Pay Over Time balances. 
Revised term effective July 1, 2012 
Minimum Monthly 
Payment 
(for Pay Over Time 
Features) 
The minimum amount due for Pay Over Time features will generally be 1% of your 
Pay Over Time New Balance plus finance charges, but not less than $35. The new 
calculation is shown in the Minimum Monthly Payment section on the reverse side. 
This change may increase your minimum monthly payment. If you make automatic 
payments in a fixed amount, please review your statements and adjust your 
payments as necessary. 
Additional changes to your terms and benefits effective July 1, 2012 
ATM Withdrawals 
(Zync. Green. Gold Cards 
only) 
The limit on ATM withdrawals for Zync and Green Card accounts will be $3,000 in a 
30-day period (previously, $1,000 in a 7-day period). The limit for Gold Card accounts 
will be $8,500 in a 30-day period (previously, $2, 500 in a 7-day period). 
Membership Rewards 
Reinstatement Fee 
(Program enrolees only) 
We will charge $35 to reinstate points forfeited for late payment (previously, $29). 
Membership Rewards 
Bonus Points 
(Rewards Plus Gold only) 
Rewards Plus Gold Cardmembers will earn 1 point for every dollar spent at a hotel 
with a frequent guest program that participates in Membership Rewards (previously, it 
was 2 points in the first year of Cardmembership and 1.5 points thereafter).
