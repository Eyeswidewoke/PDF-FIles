DO NOT CALL THE TRUSTEE, THE ADMINISTRATIVE COMMITTEE OR YOUR BENEFITS ADMINISTRATOR TO GIVE YOUR

INSTRUCTION FORM. 
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ON 
SAVINGS AND RETIREMENT PLAN TENDER RIGHTS AND PROCEDURES 
A. DESCRIPTION OF THE OFFER 
1.What is the Offer? 
On May 4, 1999, the Company offered to purchase up to 15,000,000 Shares of its common stock at a price not greater 
than $55.00 nor less than $50.00 per Share. This Offer will be open from May 4, 1999 until it expires at 12:00 midnight, 
New York City time, on Tuesday, June 1, 1999, unless it is extended by the Company. Savings and Retirement Plan 
participants who hold Shares in the Limited, Inc. Stock Fund ("Plan Shares") may provid= for the tender of Plan Shares 
for purchase pursuant to this Offer by so indicating on the enclosed Tender Instructions Form and returning it as 
directed no later than Thursday, May 27, 1999. Based on the number of Shares tendered and the prices specified by 
tendering stockholders, the Company will determine a single per Share price (not greater than $55.00 nor less than 
$50.00 per Share) that it will pay for the Shares validly tendered pursuant to the Offer and not withdrawn (the "Purchase 
Price"). The Compan= will select the lowest Purchase Price that will allow it to purchase 15,000,000 Shares (or such 
lesser number as are validly tendered and not withdrawn at prices not greater than $55.00 nor less than $50.00 per 
Share) pursuant to the Offer. All stockholders whose Shares are purchased by the Company will receive the Purchase 
Price for each Share purchased in the Offer. This process is known as a "Dutch auction". 
If the number of Shares tendered at or below the Purchase Price exceeds the total number of Shares to be purchased, all 
Shares tendered at or below the Purchase Price would be accepted on a pro rata basis. "Pro rata" =imply means that 
each person can sell an equal proportion of the Shares offered to the Company. For example, if the number of Shares 
tendered at or below the Purchase Price (assume, 30,000,000) exceeds the number to be purchased, 15,000,000, the 
Company would calculate a proration percentage which would equal 50%, the ratio of the total number of Shares to be 
purchased, 15,000,000, divided by the total number of Shares tendered at or below the Purchase Price, 30,000,000. 
Therefore, if you tendered 1,000 Shares at or below the Purchase Price, the Company would purchase 500 Shares at the 
Purchase Price. If the total number of your Shares (including those held under the Savings and Retirement Plan or the 
Company's Stock Purchase P=an or otherwise) is less than 100 and you tender all those Shares at or below the Purchase 
Price, then the proration percentage will not be applied to your tendered Shares and the Company will, instead, buy all 
of your tendered Shares. (If you hold fewer than 100 Shares you must check the second box on the Tender Instruction 
Form to avoid proration.) 
The Offer is fully described in the Offer To Purchase provided to you. 
PLEASE READ IT CAREFULLY. 
2. What are my rights under the Offer? 
The records of the Savings and Retirement Plan indicate that Shares are allocated to your Account under the Savings and 
Retirement Plan as a result of your election to invest in the Limited, Inc. Stock Fund. You may tender some or all of these 
Shares. Because all of these Shares are held in trust for your benefit, they are registered in the name of the Trust. 
Consequently, the Trustee will actually tender Plan Shares in accordance with your directions.
