Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 
(in thousands, except share and per share amounts) 
The 2011 Credit Facility was paid off in full on July 20, 2012 in connection 
with the 2012 Acquisition, resulting in a loss on extinguishment 
of $7,762. 
Successor 
On July 21, 2012, the Company entered into a syndicated loan agreement with 
various financial institutions (the "2012 Credit Facility"). The 
2012 Credit Facility includes a 7 year $182,500 1st Lien Term Loan ("Term 
Loan A"), a $70,000 2nd Lien Term Loan ("Term Loan B") and a 
revolving line of credit of $25,000. 
Term Loan A principal is due in variable quarterly installments starting in 
the fourth quarter of 2012 and bears interest, which is due quarterly, 
at 3-month LIBOR plus a spread of 6.25% with a LIBOR floor value of 1.25%. 
Term Loan A has a maturity date of July 20, 2019. The revolving 
line of credit has an interest rate of LIBOR plus a spread of 6.25% and has 
a maturity date of July 20, 2017. Additionally, the Company pays a 
commitment fee on the unused portion of the revolving line of credit at a 
rate of 0.50%. Term Loan B is due in full on its maturity date of 
January 20, 2020, and it bears interest at LIBOR plus a spread of 9.50% with 
a LIBOR floor value of 1.50%. 
Beginning with the quarter ending December 30, 2012, the Successor is 
required to maintain certain financial covenants including a Total 
Rent Adjusted Leverage Ratio and a Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio. 
Total Rent Adjusted Leverage Ratio means as of the end of any fiscal quarter 
of the Company for the Test Period ending on such date, the 
ratio of (a) the sum of (i) Consolidated Total Debt, as defined in the loan 
agreement, as of the last day of such Test Period and (ii) an amount equal 
to the product of eight (8) multiplied by Consolidated Rental Expense, as 
defined in the loan agreement, for such Test Period to (b) Consolidated 
EBITDAR, as defined in the loan agreement, for such Test Period, in each 
cash for the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, as defined in the 
loan agreement. 
Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio means, as of the end of any fiscal 
quarter of the Company for the Test Period ending on such date, the 
ratio of (a) Consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the loan agreement, for such 
Test Period to (b) Consolidated Interest Expense, as defined in the 
loan agreement, for such Test Period, in each case for the Company and its 
Restricted Subsidiaries, as defined in the loan agreement. 
The Company was in compliance with these covenants at December 28, 2014 and 
December 29, 2013. Under the terms of the agreement, 
various remedies exist for the lender should the terms of the covenants not 
be met, including changes in interest rates and other fees or charges. 
On August 23, 2013, the Company entered into an amendment to the 2012 Credit 
Facility (the "First Amended 2012 Credit Facility"). In 
connection with this amendment, the Company refinanced $181,131 of its 
existing Term Loan A, which resulted in a modification of the existing 
Term Loan A. The Company recorded a loss on modification of the Term Loan A
