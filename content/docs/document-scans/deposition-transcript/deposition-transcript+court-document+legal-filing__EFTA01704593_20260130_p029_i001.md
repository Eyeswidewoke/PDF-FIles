account number and chock serial number to your financial Matt/ton, unless the check is not processabte electronically or a 
less costly process is available. By submitting acheck for payment, you authorize us to initiate an electronic debit from your

day. Allocation of Paments and Credits: Subject to applicable law, we will apply and albcate payments and credits 
among Features and Crges on your Account in any order and manner determined by us in our sob discretion. Finance 
Charges: Average Daily Balance (ADB) Method for Calculation of Finance Charges (FC): We use the ADB 
Method to calculate FC on your Account. Under this method, we figure the FC on your Account by applying the Daily 
Periodic Rate (DPR) to the ADS (as described below) for each Feature (inducing current transactions). Different daily 
periodic rates may be applied to separate Feature balances. To get the ADBfor each feature, we (1) take the begirn no 
balance for each day (incbdrig unpaid FC from previous billing periods) (2) add any new transactions, debits, or fees, (3) 
subtract any payments or °cede, and (4) make any appropriate adjustments. For each day after the first day of the billing 
period, we also add an amount of interest equal to the previous day's daily balance multiplied by the DPR for the 
Feature. This gives us the daily balance for the Feature for that day and the beginning balance for that Feature for the next 
day. If this balance is negative, it is considered to be zero. Then, we add km a the daily balances for the Feature for the 
biting period and dvide the total by the number of days in the tilling period. This gives us the ADB for the Feature. If you pay 
the New Balance on this statement by the next Closing Date, then you will avoid additional FC on features included in this 
New Balance. If you multiply the ADB for each Feature by the number of days In the tolling period and the DPR for that 
Feature, the result will be the FC assessed on that Feature, except for variations caused by rounding. The total FC for the 
billing period is calculated by addng the FC assessed on all Features of the Account. This method of calculating the ADS 
and FC results in daily compounding of FC. Transactions Made in Foreign Currencies: If you incur a Charge in a 
breign currency, it will be converted into US dollars on the date it is processed by us or our agents. Unless a particular rate is 
required by applicable law, we will choose a conversionrate that is acceptable to us for that date. Currently, the conversion 
rate we use for a Charge in a foreign currency is no greater than (a) the highest official conversion rate published by a 
government agency, or (s) the highest interbank conversion rate identified by us from customary banking sources, on the 
conversion date or the poor business day, in each Instance Increased by 2%. This conversion rate maydiffer from rates 
in effect on the date of your charge. Charges converted by establishments (such as airlines) will be baled at the rates such 
establishments use. Billing Rights Summary: In Case of Errors or Ouestions About Your BIII: If you think your bill is 
incorrect, or if you need more information aWut atransaction on your bit, write us on a separate sheet of paper at the 
Custcmer Service address noted to the right. We must hear from you no later than 60 days after we sent you the First bill on
