Individuals making a complaint or part=cipating as a witness in an investigation cannot be retaliated against.&nbs=; Any 
employee who engages in retaliation will be disciplined. The Of=ice of Equity and Inclusion does not make any findings 
until such time as i= determines that it has completed its fact gathering.<=div> 
Our courts recognize that participants in an adminis=rative investigation have a privilege against 
a defamation charge. In Paros v= Hoemako Hospital, 140 Ariz. 335, 681 P.2d 918 (Ct. App. Div. 2 1984), the c=urt 
recognized that the employer's response to a notice of charge o= discrimination filed with the Equal Employment 
Opportunity Commission was a=solutely privileged. In Miller v. Servicemaster by Rees, 174 Ariz. at 5=0, 851 P.2d 240, 
243 (Ct. App. Div. 1 1993), the court recognized the exist=nce of a conditional privilege for employees to report 
perceived acts of se=ual harassment as public policy dictated that employees must be protected f=om workplace sexual 
harassment. Cited approvingly, Carey v. Maricopa County,=/i> Paros and Miller were cases concer=ing discrimination 
and harassment under Title VII. In addition to its=obligations under Title VII, the University must also operate its 
education=l programs and activities to be free from gender discrimination under Title=IX. 
<=> 
The Office of Equity and l=clusion will proceed with its investigation as outlined in ACD 401 and 
P20.=The Office will not provide your client with its investigative file. W= look forward to Dr. Krauss's continuing 
cooperation. Regards=

Subject:</=> P=ivate and Confidential, in response to our meeting. 
Dear Naimah et al: 
Attached you will find a letter from my attorney, along with a letter he s=nt to Buzzfeed earlier 
in this week regarding the defamatory and false stor= they were planning on printing. The story was then published 
yesterd=y morning.&n=sp; I wanted to add to his letter, to reiterate=our concern about how your office was planning 
to follow up on the false an= defamatory third-party allegations from Buzzfeed. Because this=was initiated by an online 
entertainment news outlet with a clear agenda an= established record of propagating false allegations about me, rather 
than b= any of the individuals they refer to as sources, this should not be c=nsidered a credible allegation worthy of 
investigation. I believe that our i=itial discussion was sufficient to settle this matter. Whether o= not you agree with this, 
there are two things l&nb=p;think are important to establish. =/div> 
Firstly, =that the University should not propagate what can be false allegations f=om such a 
source by presenting them directly to current and/or former emplo=ees or to others. To do so would be to further their 
libelous agenda,=as Mr Waldman has emphasized. In this regard, I would appreciate seei=g copies of the 
correspondence you might send to current or former employee= about this in the process of carrying out and concluding 
your investigatio=. 
Secondly, I reiterate once again that the Origins Project=environment is supportive, candid, 
frank, honest, and productive, with all e=ployees being treated with respect, as well as being supported and mentored= I 
am proud of our team, and I believe they feel the same way. =u> 
Thanks for your attention to the=e letters.
