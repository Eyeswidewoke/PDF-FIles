Table of Contents 
SAFEWAY INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
In connection with the closing of the Merger and immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, each outstanding, unexpired 
and unexercised option to purchase shares of Safeway common stock (each, a "Safeway Option"), that was granted under any equity 
incentive plan of Safeway, including the 1999 Amended and Restated Equity Participation Plan, the 2007 Equity and Incentive Award 
Plan and the 2011 Equity and Incentive Award Plan or any other plan, agreement or arrangement (collectively, the 'Safeway Equity 
Incentive Plans"), whether or not then exercisable or vested, was accelerated, vested and cancelled and converted into the right to 
receive an amount in cash (subject to any applicable withholding taxes) equal to the product of (A) the total number of shares of Safeway 
common stock subject to such Safeway Option as of immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger and (B) the excess, if any, of 
the Per Share Cash Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share (the "Option Price-) of such Safeway Option (the 'Option 
Payment"). In addition, each such Safeway Option that had an Option Price less than the Per Share Cash Merger Consideration 
received one Casa Ley CVR and one PDC CVR in respect of each share of Safeway common stock subject to such cancelled Safeway 
Option. 
Immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, each restricted share of Safeway common stock that was outstanding and 
that was granted pursuant to any Safeway Equity Incentive Plan, whether or not then exercisable or vested, automatically vested and all 
restrictions thereon lapsed, and all such restricted shares were cancelled and converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger 
Consideration. 
Immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, each outstanding performance share award covering shares of Safeway 
common stock (each a Performance Share Award") that was granted under any Safeway Equity Incentive Plan vested at the target 
levels specified for each such award and was cancelled in exchange for (i) an amount in cash (subject to any applicable withholding 
taxes) equal to the product of (A) the number of vested shares of Safeway common stock subject to such Performance Share Award 
(after taking into account any vesting as a result of the Merger) and (B) the Per Share Cash Merger Consideration and (ii) one Casa Ley 
CVR and one PDC CVR in respect of each vested share of Safeway common stock subject to such Performance Share Award. 
Immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, each outstanding restricted stock unit covering shares of Safeway common 
stock (each a "Restricted Stock Unit"), that was granted under any Safeway Equity Incentive Plan, whether or not then vested, was 
accelerated, vested and cancelled in exchange for the right to receive (i) an amount in cash (subject to any applicable withholding taxes) 
equal to the product of (A) the number of vested shares of Safeway common stock subject to such Restricted Stock Unit and (B) the Per 
Share Cash Merger Consideration and (ii) one Casa Ley CVR and one PDC CVR in respect of each vested share of Safeway common 
stock subject to such Restricted Stock Unit. 
On January 30, 2015, Safeway entered into a contingent value rights agreement with respect to the Casa Ley CVRs with AB 
Acquisition, the Shareholder Representative (as defined in the agreement). Computershare Inc. and Computershare Trust Company, 
N.A., as rights agent (the "Casa Ley CVR Agreement') providing for the terms of the Casa Ley CVRs. Pursuant to the Casa Ley CVR 
Agreement, a Casa Ley CVR will entitle the holder to a pro rata share of the net proceeds from the sale of Safeway's interest in Casa 
Ley. In the event that Safeway's interest in Casa Ley is not sold prior to January 30, 2018, holders of the Casa Ley CVRs will be entitled 
to receive their pro rata portion of the fair market value of such remaining interest minus certain fees, expenses and assumed taxes 
(based on a 39.25% rate) that would have been deducted from the proceeds of a sale of the Casa Ley interest.
