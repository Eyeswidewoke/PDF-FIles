unexpected inability to continue to finance leveraged positions. Even if the Corporate 
Value Fund does not use leverage to acquire an Investment, the Corporate Value Fund 
will need to have margin accounts in order to facilitate its hedging activities. 
Hedging 
The hedging transactions in which the Corporate Value Fund will engage may not be 
effective in mitigating the Corporate Value Fund's risks. Furthermore, Hudson Bay 
Capital may choose not to hedge certain risks (in whole or in part) or determine that 
doing so would be economically disadvantageous. Hedging transactions may, over time, 
result in a poorer overall performance of the Corporate Value Fund than if Hudson Bay 
Capital had not engaged in any hedging. 
Hedging strategies are subject to both significant transaction costs, as well as to path-
dependent outcomes depending upon when hedging positions are implemented, 
increased, reduced or liquidated and the correlation between such hedging positions and 
Corporate Event/Appraisal Proceeding (credit) risks that they are intended to hedge. The 
fact that the Corporate Value Fund hedges its exposure may be viewed unfavorably by a 
court or arbiter in the context of any determination of value to be awarded, potentially 
resulting in a lower amount. The Corporate Value Fund's portfolio will always be 
exposed to certain risks that are not or cannot be hedged. 
Expedited Transactions 
The opportunity for the Corporate Value Fund to participate in any given Corporate 
Event will typically be short-lived, and Hudson Bay Capital may be forced to make 
investment decisions on an expedited basis. The risk to the Corporate Value Fund of 
Hudson Bay Capital making expedited investment decisions is significant in the case of 
the Strategy because of the often precise and detailed analysis needed to determine 
whether the Transaction Price — which has, after all, been accepted by the Target's 
management — is meaningfully below Fair Value. 
Once the Fund is committed to an Appraisal Proceeding, the Corporate Value Fund will 
hold an effectively completely illiquid position; it will be very difficult for the Corporate 
Value Fund to close out this position in order to limit losses, even if Hudson Bay Capital 
realizes that it has made an error in assessing the Fair Value of the Target possibly due (at 
least in part) to the expedited due diligence that Hudson Bay Capital was forced to 
conduct on the Corporate Event in question. 
Purchase of Third-Party Appraisal Rights 
The purchase of Third-Party Appraisal Rights involves a risk that the Corporate Value 
Fund itself may not be able to exercise such Rights, as it was not the owner of the 
Target's securities when the Corporate Event in question occurred. In such case, the 
Corporate Value Fund would incur a partial or complete loss on its investment in the 
Third-Party Appraisal Rights. For example, there is a risk that the third party who sells 
such Third-Party Appraisal Rights to the Corporate Value Fund may not in fact have the 
legal or contractual authority to do so, which could in turn impair or eliminate the
