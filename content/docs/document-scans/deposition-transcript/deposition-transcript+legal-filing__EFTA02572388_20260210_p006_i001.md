increase our total units. It means our online units need to go up by about 8x. It does not seem like that has any chance 
of happening. 
The actions proposed are all excellent. I don't think one could disagree with them. But math says it won't be enough: 
1. 
Take Surface NOW to other retailers in China. Gome, Mall Stores, etc. {Suning has a much larger footprint 
already so this won't double the runrate} 
2. 
Extend our Holiday stores NOW for next calendar year. {The math on this will be positive, but this all is next 
calendar year and will not change the velocity we are seeing so this doesn't add to the unit runrate} 
3. 
Start on a plan now to properly take Surface to mass retail in Jan/Feb with the Pro launch,. (We agree we have 
to plan now. I am suggesting that as we plan this we will find an appetite and capability to do more sooner} 
4. 
Strategize how we tell our OEM's on our plan to take Surface to mass Retail, then we must properly tell the 
OEM's. {We have to do this no matter what if we follow your recommendation 3.} 
5. 
Accelerate our physical Stores in the US and open physical and pop up stores in the Canada, UK, Australia and 
China in 2013. (This is a small marginal increase in volume} 
We're missing what we would do in Europe, Asia, Pacific. Online and experience centers are not working to move units. 
With the fulfillment challenges we have had it is not clear we can recover from that—there's a good chance we have a 
significant SAT issue that will remain for quite some time. 
Your issues raised are all real. Let me try to talk about them a bit in terms of the categories of issues: 
* 
OEMs. We are in a tough spot as we operationalize things internally in that when there are differing views one or 
more folks hold up the possibility of upsetting OEMs. But we're not consistent in what we do or how we do things, so 
this isn't really something we can model or operationalize. From the outset we've been in a tough spot. When we 
priced Surface at $499 we sided with "our own" interests. When we included Office we upset the x86 side of things. 
And so on. I think we can agree, that selling now or later will have the same impact on the dialog. One could argue that 
OEMs are stocked out for holidays and that there are no tablets or touch screens at volume so we're really not taking 
"money" as you put it. I'm just pointing out that this is not so cut and dry. 
• 
Retail execution. I've attached a very significant drill down on how this could work. The team that executing on 
Suning has put this together. It is essentially the deck we would go to Retailers with. It has margin details and an overall 
approach. We can doubt the ability of the team to execute, but they believe that they can deliver. We will never 
execute this as well as our stores. We have all done shopping this past week (I went to Northgate and Southcenter) so 
I'm assuming we all had the same experience of 8 out of 10 PCs "dead", no networking, and poorly trained retailers (I 
listened to a retailer completely fabricate a Windows 8 phone scenario). It looks really bad for Surface, but frankly 
unless our plan is store within a store I am not sure what we can ever hope to expect. Yes that makes me sad and is why 
we bet on our retail. 
* 
SKUS, Online inventory and merchandising. We made a call to price at $499. Given that we can't secure attach 
very well online we limited this to 10% of the runrate, which is driving the stock out. This was going to have the 
implications we expected. The color choice was a known tradeoff because we did not want to sell unbundled for 
margin, value prop, and competitive reasons. While we know enough now on color mix and attach, any change in this 
(like adding green) will make the complexity of this significant. We've seen the impact of stock out on the blue cover.
