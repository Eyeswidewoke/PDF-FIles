Marr, , -try, probabilty, , symmetry. entropy. it might look like computation but it is not. it might look like algorithm 
but it is not. the flip of a coin does not compute, have an algorithm or a mechanism. though it might look as if it does. it 
is not an input system, there is not mechanism drivning the heads and tails towards equal numbers. , there is not nature 
looking to see what the previous results were and computing the next result. like your ug it is more of a miracle.

I wouldn't take the term "mechanism" too literally. It refers to whatever is taking place in the brain. For some, as most 
of those in the Nowak group, it means neural nets. For Gallistel, it's processes internal to the cell. Useful to look at 
these matters in terms of Marr's three levels: computation, algorithm, mechanism.

2. i am willing to be convinced, as always 
3. my admittedly naive point is that "mechanism" ,I believe ,is the wrong concept. driven in error, by the machine -
computer analog since the early 1900s . instead think of probability , it is not a mechanism ,

Not a trivial matter. I'm not the best person to ask. I'd suggest contacting people who've really thought seriously 
about these issues, like Robert Pollin, a fine independent economist at U Mass Amherst 
2. 
Sherman's speculation is an interesting extension of recent discoveries about conservation, deep homologies, 
regulatory circuits, and other elements of what's sometimes called "the evo-devo revolution." It remains to be seen 
whether anything can be done with it. I think you underestimate the contributions of Berwick and his students, 
including Yang. 
3. 
The idea that there is a "ug" for vision, language, etc., seems to be essentially what Randy Gallistel calls "the norm 
in neuroscience," quoted in the paper on modularity that I sent you. And yes, they're certainly connected, at least at the 
level of cells, and presumably well beyond. These are live and significant research areas. These "central modules" do 
not have input or output, but they are accessed by input systems and in some cases, like language, by output systems. 
That seems a fair picture of the rough cognitive architecture. I don't follow the rest. It's true that work on human 
language uses as evidence what is available, namely performance. And much of the work unfortunately is fascinated by 
the droppings, just as in other fields. But there is some work that seeks to discover the mechanisms, as discussed in the 
papers I sent you.
