Subject can't sleep 
re dinner, I know you are trying.. It didn't work.. the food , presentation, serving. were all pretty 
awful. although There was plenty of advance notice. -- After spending so much time explaining 
why pasta can't be left out and still be edible . thats what was done. the table should have been set 
with pinto plates and accessorries, there could have been flowers in the house and at the table , 
when bringing drinks , it is ery impolite to merely dump a tray of glasses in front of a guest„ each 
person should be handed what they asked for. there is no need to ask , do you want to cat now. 
when guests are ready to eat , i will ask. or you should ask 'when would you like to eat"„ you 
can't ask people where they are going . in miami, ( it is none of your or my business ). , miami is 
enough.. The steak a serving for one person , was plopped in the middle of the table. what were 
the guests supposed to do.? the pasta was cold and mushy, no reason to take it out of the 
container in which it came, until right before serving.. ( no one cares who cooked it, and in this 
case you certainly don't want to take credit, ), the food should be kept in a warm oven. or 
reheated in a pan. a big bowl of grated cheese in a cereal bowl is both smelly and awful to look 
at. no one came to clear the mess, until after i asked, no one came to check if anyone needed any 
more water, or would like something else to drink„ when I didask you to the table, you 
announced that ou would call Janush to help remove the dishes..
 =wouldn't it have been 
easier to hay 
here to help,( you let 
go to sleep ). its not about -
does it look like you cooked the food , or does it look like you are engaged, it is about basic skills 
that it would be helpful if you would try to develop.. this was a business dinner... as such it was a 
total failure. my banter ( as you put it - my wxageration ) was a failed attempt to disguise its 
glaring shortcomings. I did my best to write this message in a language you might find 
contructive as opposed to critical.
