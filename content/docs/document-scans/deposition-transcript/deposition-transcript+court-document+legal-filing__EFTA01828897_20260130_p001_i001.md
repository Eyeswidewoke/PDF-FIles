I am very pleased to have this opportunity to recommend Alexa Staley to you. I first met 
her as one of the outstanding students in my class, Physics 104: Introductory Physics II, in her first 
year at Bowdoin. Since that time I have had the pleasure of watching her develop into a dedicated 
researcher and leader of our senior class physics students. Her strength of purpose and active 
intelligence are notable among our majors. 
Alexa is quite serious about physics and began taking courses at the 300 level (namely, 
Methods of Theoretical Physics, the watershed courses in our sequence for students that intend 
graduate study in physics) in the fall of her sophomore year. 
Doing so opened doors to upper level 
theoretical courses that otherwise might have been blocked by her study away semester because of 
course sequencing issues. Her strong performance in both 200 and 300 level course work led to the 
award of the Hall Prize, our "most promising sophomore" prize, named for Bowdoin graduate and 
discoverer of the eponymous effect, Edwin Herbert Hall. 
In the spring of her sophomore year Alexa was a student in my Statistical Mechanics course, 
Physics 229. This course has the reputation of being one of the more challenging in our major 
sequence and is often put off until junior or senior years. For many students, the concepts of 
statistical mechanics are elusively abstract and the mathematical reasoning strangely different from 
other physics applications. Alexa's previous exposure to advanced mathematical methods was a 
clear asset. Her weakness, which is common to sophomores in the class, was a lack of experience 
with the applied problem solving strategies necessary for the wide variety of examples used to 
illustrate statistical methods. In spite of this, Alexa demonstrated a good, clear grasp of essential 
elements of the problems and would clearly communicate her ideas and questions in class and in 
private discussion. Her submitted solutions were always exemplary. Her A- reflects excellent 
mastery of the course material and steadily growing sophistication as a problem solver. 
As Departmental Chair, I consulted closely with Alexa about her course choices for her junior 
semester away at the University of Otago in New Zealand. She was highly committed to the 
adventure of exploring another culture, but determined not to sacrifice her academic priorities. Thus, 
she deliberately chose to visit an English speaking country where advanced course work in Physics 
could be part of her program. We discussed the difference in course levels carefully, but for a variety 
of reasons, she ultimately chose an upper level Quantum and Atomic Physics course for which she
