did not exceed $20,000 per month, the sublease would be automatically extended for 
an additional five-year period. 
On May 8, 1996, OFM wrote to Epstein informing him that his attempt to 
exercise his right of first refusal was premature because OFM had not yet made a 
formal offer to lease the Premises to someone else. On May 10, 1996, OFM again 
wrote to Epstein reiterating that the exercise of his right of first refusal was premature, 
and explaining that the prior arrangement with Galinas was not a binding contract, but 
rather merely an "expression of interest." Then, on May 16, 1996, OFM officials visited 
the Premises and discovered that Fisher, not Epstein, was in possession. 
Throughout this period, Epstein continued to pay, and OFM continued to accept, 
rent for the Premises, despite its knowledge that Fisher was in possession. OFM 
accepted and deposited Epstein's May 1996 rent check on May 28, 1996. On June 3, 
1996, OFM sent Epstein a notice of default, as required by the lease, stating that he 
was in violation of (1) the Use Clause, because he was no longer personally occupying 
the premises, and (2) the Assignment and Sublease Clause, because he had sublet to 
Fisher without prior written consent of OFM. Consistent with the terms of the Lease, 
Epstein was given 30 days to cure the default. On June 28, 1996, OFM accepted 
Epstein's June rent check. The cure period then expired on July 10, 1996. Epstein 
had not cured by this time, but rather than terminating the lease, OFM served Epstein 
with a 10-day notice to cure and demanded the July rent. OFM then accepted 
Epstein's check for the July rent. Finally, on August 7, 1996, OFM notified Epstein that 
the amended lease would be terminated as of August 23, 1996 for failure to cure the 
defaults. OFM demanded that Epstein vacate the Premises and return the keys on or 
before that date. 
Despite OFM's notice of termination, Epstein tendered August rent on August 
30, 1996. On September 13, 1996, OFM wrote to Epstein stating that rent was being 
accepted only through August 23, 1996, and refunded the balance to Epstein. On 
September 16, 1996, OFM wrote to Fisher advising that the lease agreement between 
OFM and Epstein had been terminated, that he was occupying the premises illegally, 
and demanded that the Premises be vacated immediately. Fisher met with an Assistant 
United States Attorney on September 23, 1996, who informed Fisher that Richard 
Massey, the OFM representative with whom Epstein dealt, would swear under oath 
that he never orally approved the sublet to Fisher. Fisher contends that he offered to 
continue paying rent directly to OFM rather than to Epstein, an offer to which the 
Government never responded. At that time, Fisher stopped paying rent to Epstein 
pursuant to the sublease. 
B. Prior Proceedings 
1. The Original Actions 
*4 The Government commenced this action against Epstein and Fisher in 
October of 1996. It seeks a declaration by the Court that it is entitled to exclusive 
possession of the Premises and that it is entitled to have Epstein and Fisher ejected 
therefrom because Epstein's lease was properly terminated as of August 23, 1996. In 
addition, the Government seeks dismissal of Fishers first and second counterclaims, 
which seek equitable relief against the Government. [FN2] Finally, the Government 
demands back rent from Epstein and/or Fisher.
