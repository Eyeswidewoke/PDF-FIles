in different geographical regions. These differences may affect the general izability of efficacy 
153 
data from patients outside the United States to the U.S. population. If the development program 
154 
includes trials conducted in other geographical regions, these data can be used to support safety. 
155 
156 
To support efficacy, the trial population should be representative of U.S. women in whom the 
157 
drug will be intended for use and should reflect the demographic characteristics of the target 
158 
population with the disorder. Trial subjects should be North American patients who are sexually 
159 
active and are at least 18 years of age. They should have a documented history of personal 
160 
distress related to low sexual interest, desire, and/or arousal. Although women who are not in a 
161 
stable relationship may also experience sexual dysfunction, the FDA recommends that the 
162 
clinical trials limit enrollment to women who are in a stable relationship. This approach reduces 
163 
the likelihood of having changes in relationship status during the trials, which could confound 
164 
the results. Patients should be excluded if the symptoms and associated distress are related to a 
165 
comorbidity, problems within the relationship, or the effects of a drug or other drug substance. 
166 
167 
Female sexual dysfunction occurs in adult women. Sponsors can request a full waiver for 
168 
pediatric studies on the grounds that necessary studies would be impossible because the 
169 
condition does not exist in the pediatric age group. 
170 
171 
2. 
Eligibility 
172 
173 
The exclusion criteria (e.g., coexisting medical conditions, concomitant medications, restrictions 
174 
based on body mass index, history of substance use) should be limited to ensure that the trial 
175 
population is representative of North American women anticipated to use the drug, if approved. 
176 
We also encourage sponsors to include patients with a broad range of severity of sexual 
177 
dysfunction at baseline, provided that the dysfunction causes marked distress (see section 
178 
III.D.3., Instruments for Measuring Patient-Reported Outcomes, for an assessment of distress). 
179 
Furthermore, because the eligibility criteria do not need to be identical in all phase 3 trials 
180 
comprising the clinical program, subsequent trial(s) can have less restrictive entry criteria than 
181 
the first trial. 
182 
183 
3. 
Menopausal Status 
184 
185 
Because conditions of low sexual interest, desire, and/or arousal occur in both pre- and 
186 
postmenopausal women, both groups represent appropriate target populations. Development 
187 
programs targeting only one of these subgroups should be justified by safety concerns or other 
188 
clinical grounds. 
189 
190 
Sponsors can choose to study pre- and postmenopausal women in separate trials or study these 
191 
populations within the same trial. If studied in the same trial, randomization of subjects should 
192 
be stratified by menopausal status. Regardless of the approach chosen, dose-finding, safety, and 
193 
efficacy should be established independently for each of these populations, because the benefit-
194 
risk profile may differ and there may be differences in etiologies and treatment responses. 
195 
Therefore, if both pre- and postmenopausal women are included in the same clinical trial, the 
196 
trial should be powered adequately to demonstrate statistical and clinical significance for each of 
197 
these subgroups.
