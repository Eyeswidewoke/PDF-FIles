summarize - the list I provided to Brad last December - of things I thought 
were a priority to get done - still remains in the whole unresolved. Neither 
Alan nor Brad has reviewed the BRH agreement or the TRA , the two largest 
financial assets of your portfolio , inexcusable . 
The IT, is virtually untouched and is still in desperate need of a new system - reporting 
badly flawed , and both cumbersome and inaccurate . all done by hand as one -off 
exercises , when either you or brad ask for it - airplane: re structure, (my only 
suggested priority in june ) is really ,no further ahead then it was then , consultants 
up the kazoo but nothing at all done.( the office was recently told by Brad not to 
share the outside proposals with me - brad has no idea even as to what questions 
to ask. he knows little of finance, is bullshitted over by almost everyone in the 
office. . Eileen was self aware enough to know she was over her head , that is a 
huge difference. bad info is rampant a simple emblematic example- 3 million in 
deductions I'm told were taken for art space but on closer examination it turns 
out they cannot be used at all. ( ZERO benefit ) though you will be told yes they 
were deducted on the return they said that is the only real question you were 
focused on ! " were they deducted or not - correct question would have been " is 
there a benefit " !! 
I asked for the balance sheet and/or P and L for Regan arts 
, the basic first step in order to check your financials. "sorry we never got one?" 
though 9.8 million invested, no p&l, nothing!, a construction project run amok , 
no budget, the coo fired after only 3 months. , no clue . fyi artspace financials 
are also a total mess. ( no receivables ??). when i asked for a list of what got done 
and did not, i received the email from Brad basicailly mind you own business. 
so much was promised. !!! 
As in your words im one of your closest friends and in order to turn the page. I 
include the following in order to be constructive 
Here is a list of things I think would be in your interest to get done asap .but definitely 
not by me . 
i suggest you form new grats. , hire a high level tax partner. use your trading accounts 
as they remain a paramount requirement 16 months after i emailed you re their 
importance. THe Phaidon transaction papered and structured as contemplated 
DOES NOT WORK , its as simple as that. DOES NOT !! 
I suggest again that 
you re-do bank loans. no need to pay interest at higher rates on boat or plane. . 
as Richard is now no longer trustee. re- do will, make suydam executor , with 
Barry, and john as back up. pay 1 million a year for executor role. get rid of Judy 
Black trust, deal with gifts and their tax returns, . review amounts to kids at fixed 
ages. put more protections in for Alex and Victoria. , distribute some money to 
kids let them make decisions. , decide art division with children in attendance . 
have fire drill done on estate. fill out estate returns as if you and Debra died today, 
choose advisers - rick bronstein said the only 1040 he ever filled out was his 
own. Halperin has a conflict that should be addressed., A strategy of the use of
