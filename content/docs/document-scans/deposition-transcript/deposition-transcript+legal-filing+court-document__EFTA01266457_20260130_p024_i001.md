certification from any attending physician of any individual Trustee of a trust that he or she is 
no longer able to make decisions with respect to such trust, then from the date of filing of such 
certification, such individual Trustee shall be deemed to have resigned for all purposes of this 
Agreement. 
Section 7.4. - Vacancy in Office 
If there is a vacancy in the Trustees and no successor Trustee is designated pursuant to 
Section 7.1 who is willing to act, the legally competent adult Beneficiary (or a majority in 
beneficial interest of the legally competent adult Beneficiaries if there are multiple 
Beneficiaries) then entitled or permitted to receive income from such trust shall designate a 
successor Trustee by an instrument in writing delivered to the designated Trustee. If the legally 
competent adult Beneficiaries do not designate a successor Trustee within sixty days after 
receipt of notice of such vacancy or if there is no legally competent adult Beneficiary of such 
trust, then a successor Trustee shall be named by order of a court of competent jurisdiction. All 
of the fees and expenses of my Trustees (including attorneys' fees) attributable to the 
appointment of a successor Trustee of a trust shall be paid from the assets of such trust. 
Section 7.5. - Elimination of Bond 
No bond or other security shall be required of any Trustee hereunder in any jurisdiction. 
Section 7.6. - Exculpation and Indemnification of My Trustee 
No one serving as the Trustee of any trust under this Agreement shall be accountable or 
responsible to any person interested in any trust hereunder for the manner in which my Trustees 
shall in good faith exercise any discretionary authority or any power of my Trustees. No one 
serving as the Trustee of any trust under this Agreement shall be liable for any loss or 
depreciation in value occasioned by reason of any negligence, error or mistake of judgment in 
entering into any transaction, in making any sale or investment, in continuing to hold any 
property, or by reason of any action or omission, whether by my Trustees or any other fiduciary, 
unless such Trustee has acted in bad faith. In the absence of proof by affirmative evidence to the 
contrary, each Trustee shall be deemed to have acted within the scope of my Trustees' authority, 
to have exercised reasonable care, diligence, and prudence and to have acted impartially as to 
all interested persons. A Trustee shall not be liable for the acts or defaults of another Trustee. 
In the event a legal action is brought against any individual serving as the Trustee of any 
trust under this Agreement, all legal fees and related expenses incurred in connection with the 
defense of such legal action shall be paid by such trust without court authorization; provided, 
however, that (a) no such payment shall (or shall continue to) be made if a court enters an order 
prohibiting such payment, and (b) such Trustee shall refund to the trust any such payments that 
previously had been made if a court enters an order directing that such payments be refunded, 
or if a court concludes that such Trustee acted in bad faith.
