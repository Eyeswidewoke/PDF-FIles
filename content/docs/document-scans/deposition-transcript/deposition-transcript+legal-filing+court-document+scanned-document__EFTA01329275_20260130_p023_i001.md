Agreement are and shall be continuing in nature and shall remain in full force and effect until 
such time as the Note and all other obligations of Grantor to the Lender are paid in full and until 
this Agreement is terminated or cancelled as provided herein. 
30. 
PROHIBITIONS REGARDING COLLATERAL. 
Grantor represents, 
warrants and covenants to Lender while this Agreement remains in effect as follows: 
30.1 
Transactions Involving Collateral. 
Without the prior written consent by 
Lender, (i) Grantor shall not sell, offer to sell, or otherwise transfer or dispose of 
the Collateral, and (ii) Grantor shall not lease pledge, mortgage, encumber or 
otherwise permit the Collateral to be subject to any lien, security interest, 
encumbrance, or charge, other than the security interest provided for in this 
Agreement. This includes security interests even if junior in right to the security 
interests granted under this Agreement. Unless waived by Lender, all proceeds 
from any disposition of the Collateral (for whatever reason) shall be held in trust 
for Lender, and shall not be commingled with any other funds; provided however, 
this requirement shall not constitute consent by Lender to any sale or other 
disposition. Upon receipt, Grantor shall immediately deliver any such proceeds to 
Lender. 
30.2 
No Commercial Use. 
Grantor shall use the Collateral solely for business 
purposes. Grantor shall not, without prior written consent of Lender, use the 
Collateral, or permit the Collateral to be used, in Commercial Operations, except 
Grantor may operate the Collateral on a FAR Part 135 basis, provided the use is 
covered by Grantor's insurance policy for the Collateral. 
30.3 
Removal of the Collateral. Except for routine use, Grantor shall not change the 
Home Airport or remove the Collateral from the Home Airport without prior 
written notice to Lender. Grantor shall, if an Event of Default has occurred, advise 
Lender of the exact location of the Collateral upon Lender's request. Grantor 
shall not base, or permit the Collateral to be based, outside the continental United 
States of America. 
30.4 
Travel Restrictions. Grantor shall not operate or locate the Collateral, or permit 
the Collateral to be operated, located, or flown (i) outside the continental United 
States without war risk coverage, (ii) in or over any country for which the U.S. 
State Department has issued travel restrictions (excluding any such travel 
restriction made solely with respect to the spread of Covid-I9), (iii) in or over any 
country or jurisdiction that does not maintain full diplomatic relations with the 
United States, (iv) in or over any area of hostilities, or (v) in or over any 
geographic area not covered by the insurance then in effect. Without limiting the 
foregoing, Grantor agrees that at no time during the effectiveness of this 
Agreement shall the Collateral be operated in, flown over, or temporarily located 
in any jurisdiction, unless the Geneva Convention, together with its necessary 
enacting rules and regulations (or some comparable treaty and regulations 
satisfactory to Lender) shall be in effect in such jurisdiction and any notices, 
financing statements, documents, or instruments necessary or required, in the
