Aside from many factual errors in your letter, which I won't review, l&=39;m also amazed, and shocked, to read such 
statements as "Carol's inte=tion to leave some money to your children." Carol's intention? Al=ne? Not my intention? Is 
this your conception of what our family life was? I hope not. In reality, neither of us had separate "i=tentions." We 
decided together how to ensure that the children and grandchildren would be very adequately cared for from my 
earnings of the years, and how the survivor would be as well. 
I've just explained, once again, why you are radically misled about wha= happened to my IRA under Max's and Bainco's 
supervision, until I st=rted looking into it and ended the practices that were rapidly depleting it. 
You say that you learned about Valeria in 2013 -- that is, when we met.Q=A0 It's quite true that I didn't consult lawyers 
or financial planners=or Harry before we decided to get married, just as Carol and I didn't, jus= as none of you did. I 
don't frankly understand what you are think=ng. 
You are, again, mistaken about the sale of the Lexington house. The facts are as I have repeatedly described. I surely 
would never have contemplated buying a Mem Drive apartment in a co-op with regular expenses and taking out a loan 
from a family trust had I not assumed that the loan would last until the sale of the Lexington house that would cover the 
costs of the new apartment. I've explained this over and over. I don't understand why I have to say it again, and why 
you simply ignore what I say -- which is completely accurate. 
You report a visit by Harry and Max with an idea about using assets that you recount. I don't know where you got that 
from. Nothing like that happened. They did come with an outlandish proposal that I at once rejected. Max had once 
come to Lexington to tell me that I had such enormous assets that I would never have a financial problem..=A0 Later 
he changed his story, radically: I don't know why. I had a p=ivate visit with Max in my MIT office in which he explained 
that I'd have to sharply reduce my past lifestyle, sell the boat and other such assets, because of the way my estate had 
been arranged. That's the first I'd heard of any of this. At that point I began to look into what was going on and found 
what I've described to you in detail, repeatedly= 
You say that "as far as we know, no financial planning has occurred, despite the passage of a year and a half since Max 
and Harry understood we all agreed it needed to be done." 
That's the first I've heard that Max and all of you have been my su=ervisors. I had thought that Max was my lawyer and 
that you were my children. In fact, financial planning has now occurred, the first serious and careful planning since Eric 
Menouya, but it never occurred to me that I was suppose= to be under the control of Max and Harry. 
You're right that I changed my relations with Anthony, as part of our f=nancial planning. Again, it did not occur to me 
that this was anyone's bu=iness but mine. You can have your beliefs about the facts, but I have the facts available and 
feel I have the right to make such decisions without supervision, just as you do. 
You are quite right that I can repay the loan to the marital trust, even though the profits from sale of the apartment are 
considerably less than your sources told you. I won't comment further about this, but yo= might want to think about it. 
As for my lifestyle, for your information it is considerably reduced from what it used to be, though I don't understand 
why that is your business= any more than I inquire into your lifestyles or seek to supervise them. 
The "sudden and sustained increase in spending" is fully and completely explained by the practices I have once again 
reviewed to you..=A0 That's why the IRA was depleted. Now I have ended these practices and am no longer paying 
exorbitant fees to Max for such matters as the proposed will that I described to you. 
Your phrase "an independent Trustee, such as Max," is quite remar=able in the light of what I have told you, not least 
the legalistic chicanery about the Marital Trust. He's your lawyer, working for your benef=t, which is what a lawyer is 
supposed to do I suppose. That explains the recor= I have described at length, repeatedly. But I have every right to 
select an independent and qualified Trustee, just as I selected the Trustee= up until now, without question or discussion.
