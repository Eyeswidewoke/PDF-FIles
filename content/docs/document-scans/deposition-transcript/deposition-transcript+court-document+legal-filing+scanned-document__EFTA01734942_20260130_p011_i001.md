and distress. We encourage the research and drug development community to collaborate with 
282 
the FDA in development of a publicly available fit-for-purpose PRO instrument that can be used 
283 
across multiple drug development programs over time. A framework for such collaboration is 
284 
available within the FDA Development Tool Qualification program. See the guidance for 
285 
industry and FDA Staff Qualification Process for Drug Development Tools.

Female Sexual Function Index14
288 
289 
The Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) is a 19-item instrument that has been used in clinical 
290 
trials to measure overall sexual function, although the FDA is unaware of data that adequately 
291 
establish the validity of the instrument as a whole for regulatory purposes. Individual domain 
292 
questions from the FSFI have been used to measure specific components of sexual function such 
293 
as sexual desire (questions 1 and 2) and sexual arousal (questions 3 through 6). Below we focus 
294 
on the FSFI sexual desire domain. To date, the FDA's experience with the FSFI sexual arousal 
295 
domain is limited. Sponsors who wish to use that domain or other portions of the FSFI to 
296 
establish efficacy for other aspects of sexual function should provide supporting data consistent 
297 
with the recommendations in the PRO guidance. 
298 
299 
The assessment of desire in the FSFI includes introductory instructions that define desire as 
300 
being "a feeling that includes wanting to have a sexual experience, feeling receptive to a 
301 
partner's sexual initiation, and thinking or fantasizing about having sex." Question I asks "How 
302 
often did you feel sexual desire or interest?" with response options ranging from 5 (Almost 
303 
always or always) to 1 (Almost never or never). Question 2 asks "How would you rate your 
304 
level (degree) of sexual desire or interest?" with response options ranging from 5 (Very high) to 
305 
1 (Very low or none at all). These two questions ask the subject to reflect on her symptoms over 
306 
the preceding 4 weeks. The two response scores are summed, and raw scores are multiplied by a 
307 
factor of 0.6, providing a sexual desire domain score that ranges from 1.2 to 6.0. 
308 
309 
The FDA has the following concerns with the content validity and response scale of the FSFI 
310 
desire domain, in addition to the long recall period (28 days) as discussed in section 111.D.1., 
311 
Recall Period. 
312 
313 
• 
The FDA's content validity concerns for the sexual desire domain arise from the 
314 
multibarreled instructions that make it unclear what is driving any change identified on 
315 
the assessment (e.g., receptivity, sexual fantasies, or initiating sexual activity). For 
316 
example, if only one component (e.g., sexual fantasies) is increased with the drug, but 
317 
other components (e.g., wanting, initiating, or feeling receptive to sexual activity) have 
318 
not improved, a score change suggesting improvement could be shown; however, it is 
319 
unclear whether this represents a meaningful benefit to patients. 
320 
321 
• 
The FDA's concerns with the response scale relate to the response option of "Almost 
322 
always or always" feeling sexual desire or interest (question 1) and a response indicating 
323 
a "Very high" level of sexual desire or interest (question 2). For example, it is unclear
