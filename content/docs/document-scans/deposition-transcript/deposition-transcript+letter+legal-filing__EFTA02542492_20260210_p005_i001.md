Subject: Fwd: Letter from the three of us (Avi, Diane, Harry) 
To: Valeria Chomsky < 
<mailtol 
Very good to talk to you yesterday evening, Diane.

Read your letter carefully of course. Many times.. And needless=to say, very glad to know of your concerns. I 
would, however, like t= clarify some very serious misconceptions. 
I have no idea what information you are receiving, but it is completely fal=e. In fact, I do not even understand 
how you are receiving this info=mation. Whatever the source, it is radically wrong. We have in=fact seen some highly 
misleading information from Bainco. In the category of our expenses, they have included all sort= of things that do not 
belong there, such as distributions, airline expens=s but not the fact these were reimbursed as planned, and many other 
quite =isleading calculations. However, whatever the source of what you have heard, it is completely mistaken. 
Our expenses in fact have gone down, but not entirely. In Lexington w= were living rent free. As I explained to 
Avi, I thought the house w=s in my name, and we would never have agreed with the advice from Max and =am to move 
into an apartment in Cambridge if we hadn't thought that the sale of the Lexington house would cover =he new 
apartment. That was very bad advice, and if I'd known tha= I did not own the Lexington house, I never would have 
accepted it. 
As it now stands, we have expenses for the apartment that we never had befo=e. We cannot figure out what is 
happening to royalties, but we are b=rely receiving them. There is virtually no pension because, about 20=years ago, it 
was restructured as an IRA which we then invested in the estate that will be left to the three of you-when I die. DPQ: Is 
this=the smaller IRA at Bainco? The large one is being left to Valeria based on the change in ben=ficiary designation 
that you informed us of, and regarding which I await w=itten documentation from Bainco when they provide the 
materials I have requested. 
VC: There are three IRA ac=ounts, according to the IRA/ESA Distribution Request Forms that Bainco has=been 
sending us along the years, as I mentioned above in this letter.=l would like if you could check on this. 
As I also explained to Avi, years ago when the estate was planned, the=prime concern of the lawyers was 
avoiding estate taxes. The investme=ts were assigned to trusts in Mommy's name, since we assumed that I would die 
first. The intention of course was=that the money would be available to the survivor, but things did not work=out as we 
had anticipated and now, as the trusts are written, it seems tha= I have no access to them. DPQ: This is not 
entirely=accurate as Noam is the income beneficiary of these trusts and must receiv= all the net income annually, and he 
is also entitled to principal distrib=tions as the trustees "consider advisable". At my death, the estate goes to you. DPQ: 
Carol's t=usts are left to the children at Noam's death. Except for th= small amount of assets currently in Noam's 
revocable trust (we wi=l be updating this trust after we meet in March), Noam's estate is left to Valer=a under the terms 
of his new will and pursuant to the beneficiary designat=on of the large IRA at Bainco which I am awaiting
