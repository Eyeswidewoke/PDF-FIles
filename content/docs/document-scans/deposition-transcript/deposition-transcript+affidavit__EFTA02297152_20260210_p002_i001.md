Hi Jeremy! 
I was so glad to chat with you too, as I remember the first t=me we were chatting, you was very hungry and had 
a stomachache after eatin= some Indian food) hope this time you were alright) How're you doing =how is your car? 
What about your new apart., have you move there already?<=r> I like skating in winter, though I should say I do it not 
very well, but I =ike it. What about skiing, I did it only with simple ski, but I have never=try mountain ski, it's completely 
different of course, I'd like to=try it. 
You must be very religious person Jeremy, but what about me I'm even no= sure whether I can call myself a real 
Christian. I believe in God, He is =bsolute and the world He created is wonderful!. And it's really comfor=able to know 
that you can talk to him every moment and to know that you wi=I be heard. But I don't know how to think about what is 
told in the Bi=le. You know, probably if I was born in a Moslem family, I would think tha= everything what is told in the 
Koran is verily. I know that nobody can te=l the true and we have just to believe, but I still doubt and some things =he 
Bible is telling about seem to be strange to me. According to the Gospe= I must be convicted because I have put myself 
in doubt. But that is what = think. Probably, one day I will change my mind. 
And there is an eternal dispute about what direction of Christianity is ver=ly. For example, Orthodoxy consider 
other branches of Christianity to be s=ctarianism. In Orthodoxy we celebrate Christmas on Jan 7th, when other 
Chr=stians do it on Dec 25th. Or different traditions and customs, Who has eve=t it? All this seem to be strange enough. 
But what about the sense of our life, I like the words one writer I love to=read has told: "People love each other. 
And that is everything. That =s the most inconceivable and the simplest thing in the world... Without lo=e man is not 
more than a dead person on vocation...But what are we living =or than? We can die the same way..." And I agree with 
him. Our world =s perfect, but we are not and never will be. But love is the only feeling =hat can make us better.

Hello again! 
My favorite season is the Autumn, I love the leaves cha=ging color and the cool air. It is amazing how 
fast time passes by. I also=love to go skiing though. Do you like to ski? Do you like to play any othe= sports? 
We celebrate Christmas on Dec 25th as well. I think all Christian relig=ons do. How do you like the 
Catholic church there?

Hi again) Jeremy,=I'm sorry for those question in my previous email, please don't tr= to answer 
it, it would be curiously, don't know why, I've just be=n in a strange mood those day, so don't pay attention:) better tell 
me=how are you, I haven't heard from you quite long already. Can't be=ieve it's the end of this autumn, when I came 
back from US I thought t=ese months would be endless, but time is passing by so fast, another 3 mon=h - and the spring!
