to tendering Mobileye shareholders not described in sections (I) and (2) above will be subject to Israeli 
withholding tax (generally at the rate of 25% for individuals and 24% for corporations), unless they provide a 
valid certificate issued by the ITA providing for an exemption from withholding or for a reduced withholding tax 
rate that will be in effect as of the date of actual payment for the sale of Mobileye shares. According to the terms 
of the Israel Withholding Tax Ruling, such valid certificate must specifically relate to the sale of Mobileye shares 
and a general exemption for "services and assets" may not be relied upon for an exemption or reduced rate of 
withholding. Once the closing occurs and the sale of Mobileye shares is confirmed, there will be no further 
opportunity to provide a valid certificate or remedy any deficiencies in a certificate that has already been 
provided. including in the event that a certificate limited in time is no longer in effect as of the date of payment. 
Receipt of Cash in Exchange for Shares Pursuant to the Post-Offer Reorganization. 
The Israeli tax consequences of the Post-Offer Reorganization imposed on Mobileye shareholders in respect 
of the Second Step Distribution may be different from, and greater than, the taxes imposed upon such 
shareholders of Mobileye had they tendered their Shares pursuant to the Offer (including during the Subsequent 
Offering Period, as it may be extended by the Minority Exit Offering Period), and may be subject to additional 
withholding tax requirements. Mobileye and Purchaser have filed an application for the he-Wired Asset Sale 
Ruling, which, if obtained, may provide that a shareholder receiving cash in the Second Step Distribution would 
generally be treated for Israeli tax purposes as described above.
