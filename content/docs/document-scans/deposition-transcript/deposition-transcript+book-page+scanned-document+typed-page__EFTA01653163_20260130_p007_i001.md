ambassador reflects some of the most complicated gender 
and political dynamics of Trump's presidency. Now the 
impeachment probe is magnifying those dynamics as the first 
woman to publicly testify prepares to confront Trump's 
fiercest congressional defenders, nearly all men, about a 
campaign by other male allies of the president to force her 
from her post." 
Ukraine FM: Sondland Never Linked Aid To Biden 
Investigations. The Washington Examiner (11/14, Pearce, 
448K) reports Ukraine Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko said 
Thursday that US Ambassador to the European Union 
Gordon Sondland never tied military aid to Ukraine to that 
country's government launching investigations into Burisma. 
Prystaiko "told reporters...that Sandland never asked him for 
investigations into Joe Biden's son's role with the energy 
company while Biden was vice president, according to 
Interfax-Ukraine." Prystaiko said, "Ambassador Sandland did 
not tell us, and did not tell me exactly, about the relation 
between the [military] assistance and the investigations. You 
should ask him. ... I do not recall any conversation with me as 
with foreign minister. It was not we, the Ukrainian officials 
[who were told this]. ... I have never seen a direct link 
between investigations and security assistance. Yes, 
investigations were mentioned, you know, in a Presidential 
conversation. But there was no dear connection between 
these events." 
Pelosi Claims Trump Committed "Bribery." The AP 
(11/14, Mascaro, Jalonick) reports House Democrats are 
"refining part of their impeachment case against the president 
to a simple allegation: Bribery." House Speaker Pelosi on 
Thursday "brushed aside the Latin phrase 'quid pro quo' that 
Democrats have been using." Pebsi said of Trump's July 25 
phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in 
which he asked the Ukrainian leader for a favor, "It's perfectly 
wrong. It's bribery." Mary Bruce said on ABC World News 
Tonight (11/14, story 4, 1:00, Muir, 6.71M) that Pelosi's use of 
the word "bribery" is 'a new and explicit allegation, and a 
major step for the Speaker! Nancy Cordes said on the CBS 
Evening News (11114, story 3, 1:10, O'Donnell, 4.08M) that 
this was the first time Pelosi used the term, which 'has been 
gaining steam in her party." 
Peter Alexander said on NBC Nightiv News (11/14, 
story 3, 1:10, Holt, 5.7M) that Pebsi called Wednesday's 
testimony from Ambassador William Taylor and State 
Department official George Kent "devastating! Politico 
(11/14, Caygle, 4.29M) quotes Pebsi as saying the testimony 
"corroborated evidence of bribery uncovered in the inquiry 
and that the President abused power and violated his oath by 
threatening to withhold military aide and a White House 
meeting in exchange for an investigation into his political 
rival." Politico says Pelosi nevertheless "cautioned" that she 
"isn't yet ready to say whether the House will vote to impeach 
Trump, an outcome many lawmakers think is all but certain to 
happen by the end of this year." 
The Hill (11/14, Lillis, 2.98M) says Pebsi "accused 
Trump of committing offenses more severe than those of 
President Nixon, who resigned in 1974 amid an impeachment 
proceeding." She said, °What President Trump has done on 
the record — in terms of ... [asking] a foreign power to help 
him in his own election and the obstruction of information 
about that, the cover up — makes what Nixon did look almost 
small." 
McCarthy Says Schiff Has "Lied Numerous Times." 
The Washington Post (11/14, Wagner, 14.2M) reports that 
House Minority Leader McCarthy on Thursday "accused" 
House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff "of lying when he 
said Wednesday that he does not know the identity of the 
whistieblower." According to the Post, when "pressed for 
evidence to back up his claim, McCarthy did not directly 
answer the question but instead repeatedly accused Schiff of 
lying." Speaking at his weekly news conference, McCarthy 
said, "I think Adam Schiff has lied numerous times." The 
Washington Examiner (11/14, Ferrechio, 448K) says 
McCarthy "said Schiff has a history of lying, and he pointed to 
Sthiff's public, unsubstantiated claims that there is evidence 
Trump colluded with Russians ahead of the 2016 election." 
WPost Analysis: GOP's Hearsay Impeachment 
Defense Is "Extremely Risky." A Washington Post (11/14, 
Bade, Debonis, Dawsey, 14.2M) analysis says the White 
House and Republicans "have seized on the lack of 
witnesses with firsthand knowledge of President Trump's 
actions on Ukraine to try to undermine the Democrats' case 
for impeachment." But the strategy "is extremely risky. ... 
While it is true that the diplomats testified that they were told 
by others that Trump pressured Ukraine, a witness with 
firsthand information — possibly former national security 
adviser John Bolton — could still emerge." The Post adds that 
"if Republicans were so concerned about secondhand 
accounts, Democrats say, they should allow Trump 
associates who do have firsthand information — acting White 
House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and Energy Secretary 
Rick Perry, for example — to testify." Mary Bruce said on ABC 
World News Tonight (11/14, story 5, 2:10, Muir, 6.71M), 
"Democrats say they want to talk to firsthand witnesses," 
including Mulvaney and Bolton, "but Trump is blocking them 
from testifying." 
Aides Move To Cast Trump As Presidential, Above 
Impeachment Fray. Politico (11/14, Cook, 4.29M) reports 
that while the President "typically mocks the idea of acting too 
presidential — equating it with being boring," that is "exactly 
what Trump appears to be attempting this week during the 
first public impeachment hearings." Aides 'have sought to 
cast Trump as presidential, busily focused on his policy work 
and above the fray of the impeachment proceedings." Politico 
cites a "senior Administration official" who said that the White 
House "has been making a concerted effort to schedule 
presidential work and meetings on Syria, opioid abuse and 
the trade talks with China in an effort" to highlight the contrast
