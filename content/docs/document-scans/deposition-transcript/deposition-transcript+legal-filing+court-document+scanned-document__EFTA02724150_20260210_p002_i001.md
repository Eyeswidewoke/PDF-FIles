MARGARET ELISE JOSEPH. and LESLIE KEITH SASSER. Independent Executors. Petitioners-Appellants. v. COMMISSIONER OF 
INTERNAL REVENUE. Respondent-Appellee. 
.‘ppeal from the Deeirma of the Caked States Tax Court 
Before STEWART. Chief Judge. and WIENER and COSTA. Circuit Judges. 
WIENER. Circuit Judge: 
Petitioners-Appellants Margaret Elise Joseph and Leslie Keith Sasser ("Petitioners"). as Independent Executors of the Estate of their 
deceased father. James A. Elkins. Jr. ("Decedent"). petitioned the United States Tax Court ("Tax Court") to review and eventually 
eliminate the federal estate tax deficiency assessed against the Estate by Respondent-Appellee. the Commissioner of Internal Revenue 
('the Commissioner"). That deficiency resulted solely from the Commissiona's disallowance of the "fractionalownership discount" 
applied by the Estate in determining the taxable values of 1)roedent's pro rata shares of the jointly stipulated fair market values
"FMV") of 64 original works of modern and contemporary an in which the Decedent owned only fractional interests at his death. 
In the Tax Court. the Commissioner steadfastly maintained that absolutely no fractional-ownership discount was allowable. This 
presumably accounts for his failure to adduce am . affirmative evidence—either factual or expert opinion—as to the quantum of such 
discounts in the event they were found applicable by the court. 
The Tax Court rejected the Commissioner's zero-discount position. but also rejected the quantum of the various factional-ownership 
discounts adduced by the Estate through the reports, exhibits• and testimony of its three expert witnesses—the only substantive 
evidence of discount quantum presented to the court.' Instead, the Tax Court concluded that a "nominal" fractional-ownership 
discount of 10 percent should apply across the board to IX-rodent's ratable share of the stipulated FMV of each of the works of an: 
this despite the absence of any record evidence whatsoever on which to base the quantum of its self-labeled nominal discount. 
The Estate had applied a fractional-ownership discount of 44.75 percent uniformly to the Ikeedent's interest in each work of art when 
preparing the estate tax return. Form 706. It did so based on the appraisal of Sotheby's, Inc. and the report of Deloitte L.L.P. As the 
IRS disallowed that discount, however, the Estate treated it as a fall-back position in the Tax Court and adduced expert testimony of 
discrete discounts for the various works. 
We agree in large part with the Tax Court's underlying analysis and discrete factual determinations, including its rejection of the 
Commissioner's zero-discount position (which holding we affirm). We disagree, however, with the ultimate step in the court's analysis 
that led it not only to reject the quantum of the Estate's proffered fractional-ownership discounts but also to adopt and apply one of 
its own without any supporting evidence. We therefore affirm in part reverse in part, and render judgment in favor of Petitioners. 
holding that the taxable values of Decedent's fractional interests in the works of an are the net amounts reflected for each on Exhibit 8 
of the Tax Court's opinion. This. in turn. produces an aggregate refund owed to the Estate of S14.359.508.21. plus statutory interest.2
= The Estate and the Commissioner have jointly stipulated this amount as the tax refund that would be due under these circumstances 
and have further stipulated that they will confer and calculate the proper amount of statutory interest owed if the stipulated refund is 
ultimately determined to be due and owing. 
1. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS 
A. Issue on Appeal 
Despite the size and complexity of Decedent's estate and the millions of dollars of federal estate tax that it returned and paid, the single 
question presented in this appeal is narrow, straightforward. and easily posed: 
Given the parties stipulation of the FMV of each of the works of an in which Decedent owned fractional interests at his death, is the 
Estate taxable on Decedent's undiscounted pro rata share of those FMVs, as the Commissioner contended on audit and throughout the 
Tax Coun proceedings, or is it taxable only on those values reduced by fractional-ownership discounts of either ( 1) a uniform 10 
percent each, as held by the Tax Court, or (2) the various percentages that the Estate advanced through the testimony and reports of 
its expert witnesses? 
This entire appeal thus begins and ends with the question of the taxable value of Decedent's fractional interests in those 64 items of non-
business. tangible, personal property that were jointly owned in varying pv•vvotages by Ikcedent and his three adult children at the 
instant of his death. And, the answer to that one question begins and ends with the proper administration of the ubiquitous willing 
buyer/willing seller test for fair market value: "Fair market value is defined as 'the price at which the property would change hands 
between a willing buyer and a willing seller, neither being under any compulsion to buy or sell and both having reasonable knowledge 
of relevant facts.' "'
