I was always by your side and I did plenty: however not without fighting you, not without telling you what you ask 
for is petty and unimportant in the scheme of things, and not without treating your requests as simply an 
unnecessary way to keep me occupied. And for that I am really sorry. Unfortunately, it was your kind gesture that 
made me see the difference and not your yelling and nagging so you can throw a tantrum now but it seems obvious 
that leading by example or just being kind is a more constructive way to communicate than attacking each other...

yes, I read them and its alt about what i do , it took a year of arguing before you gave in, you 
mean i didnt give in as quickly. and you take that to be a bad thing, it is your belief that I 
should succumb to petty ,behavior based on nothing more than childish jealousies. while all the 
time ignoring the fact that you do not do much but complain.

Sony but you didn't do any of those things the way you did this onc„it took a year of arguing to explain to you 
every one of those issues and it is still a compromise, jenna after 2 years still lives at 301, still comes to 
florida, you hired dana after I wanted her to leave, moved her to 301 and she still visits as well, you took 
hundreds of naps with sarah after we already talked about it and watched movies in the office every night 
hugging and being affectionate to these people...all of that knowing it was painful for me and i needed 
something from you that you didn't find justifiable or important enough. I know you were not trying to hurt 
me and I had to deal with the fact you are just going to do what you want. I obviously can't force you to do 
anything. 
With this email you actually took my needs into consideration without fighting me (well, until now) , I 
appreciated it, I realized how much nicer it is and I should do that for you too. ( this would be the point where 
i am dealing with my own actions and i am not content with them ) 
I don't see why we are arguing now...are you actually reading my emails?
