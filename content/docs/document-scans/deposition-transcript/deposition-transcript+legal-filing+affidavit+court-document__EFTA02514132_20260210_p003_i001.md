I understood very well, and responded, pointing out that the information you have received from some source -- which 
you do not identify, despite repeated requests -- is flatly wrong. In the letter I wrote to you, to which this one was 
supposed to be a response (while avoiding everything I wrote), I already had explained in some detail why your picture is 
incorrect, throughout. I'm sorry that you ignored the letter, but I will repeat the main points below. If you want to sit 
down face-to-face, OK, though I think a conference call would make more sense. 
Before going on, I frankly cannot comprehend why yo= think this discussion -- in which I respond to you point by point 
and you ignore everything I write -- is necessary or even appropriate. = can appreciate your being concerned about my 
life, just as I'm concerne= about yours. I'd be amazed if it were otherwise. That's=natural in a close-knit family. Over 
the years, I've often been seriously concerned about the decisions and choices all of you have made, which somet=mes 
seemed questionable or mistaken to me (Mommoy even more so, when she was alive and well). But neither she nor I 
ever ever felt that we had a right to interfere or to supervise. For example, I never would have dreamed of asking you 
for financial statements, or even suggested that we discuss these matters. I'd have been happy to do so if yo='d asked, 
but if not, it's your decisions and my role is only to be suppor=ive -- as I have been, in many ways that you know and I 
need not review. And also by setting aside ample funds over the years to ensure that you and your children will be well 
provided for: that includes the trusts of which you are beneficiaries, two houses, almost all of my pension, educatio=al 
Trusts for grandchildren, and lots of funding along the way for all sorts of purposes. I don't understand why you think it 
is any different in the present case, and I think it would be a good idea for you to explain= so that we can clear the air. 
On a personal level, we are heartbroken to feel that we are kept at such a distance from you in your new life. We were 
thrilled to learn that you had found a new partner, but we were grieved when we began to realize that this meant we 
are rarely able to see you. 
It didn't mean that at all. Of course, my=life became different, and Valeria and I had many things to do to put our new 
life together. But we took time off from the conference in Mexico to see you, with much pleasure; a few months before 
that we went to Wellfle=t to spend some time with you. Harry, Amy and Alex have visited. I kept seeing Avi whenever 
we could arrange it, sometimes with Valeria, usually alone. We began spending winters in Tucson, now moved. I 
certainly don't want any distance, and am just as heartbroken as you to think that there might be. 
Even email and telephone communica=ion has become much more limited. 
If so, I'm not aware of it. Until the las= few weeks I spoke to Harry weekly until he stopped calling. I very rarely had 
email correspondence with Diane in the past, more often with Guillermo, which has continued. Since Avi was close by, 
email was always limited= Otherwise we rarely used the phone. 
We have also been increasingly dis=ressed to see that instead of feeling happy and relaxed, you feel impoverished. 
You misunderstand, totally and completely, so much so that I cannot comprehend where you are getting your 
information from.4>=A0 Certainly nothing in my letters or anything of said. Again, apart from this continued 
interchange, which I don't understand, I'm happ= and relaxed, much more so than during the years before Valeria and I 
came toget=er. As for "impoverishment," when I began to look into how my affairs had been handled, I discovered that 
I was indeed facing financial problems, though far from impoverished. I've explained before in letters th=t you have 
ignored, so I will repeat briefly again. 
I discovered that I have almost no pension: years a=o it was turned into trusts of which you are the beneficiaries, and 
the very small pension I receive (less than Social Security) ends at my death, leavi=g nothing to Valeria. 
I discovered that I was living on an IRA that was b=ing rapidly depleted. To run through the arithmetic again, there is a 
mandatory withdrawal of about $300,000. Half of that was being distri=uted to 10 family members. The other half was
