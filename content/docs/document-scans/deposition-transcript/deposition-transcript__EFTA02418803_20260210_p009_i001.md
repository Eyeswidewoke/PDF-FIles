I felt pimped, she says. 
Another time, at another club, Kim slapped a whale who reached his hand up her skirt and she got fired. 
Now she works behind a bar. She makes a lot less money. But nobody is touching her. There's a 
whole bar between me and the men now, she says, and she draws the width with her hands. 
Now girls come out expecting to find Tiger Woods, says Andrew Parker. It's a Thursday night, and we are 
at CV Lounge on the Lower East Side, which is not one of the big-name exclusive venues but has 
a certain cacheUay-Z and Diddy have stopped in to check out the private couple's room. Parker 
is a 40-year-old dandy, dressed in a self-designed suit and an ebullient pocket square and tinted 
glasses. He used to own a clothing store on the Upper East Side, but mostly he is known for 
being at parties, a launch for a small-batch bourbon, the premiere of a Ugandan film. 
There is a new breed of girls coming to the clubs, he is saying, wanting to hunt the big game like Tiger. 
But it's harder now than ever, because the inverse is also true. Men have been warned by what 
happened to Woods. They are more cautious when they meet a girl. They don't give last names 
or occupations. 
The odds of even meeting an investment banker who will really take care of you are slim, says Parker. 
Girls are more likely to run into guys like Parker. He hosts tables, which means he is a sometime 
promoter, and the club will give him a table and a few free bottles with the understanding that 
he will bring in some pretty girls. He dresses like he has money, he goes out like he has money. 
But he doesn't really have the kind of money they're looking for. 
I've had at least a dozen girls over the past year not call me back because I don't have as much money as 
they thought I did. His good suit shrugs. I slept with them. I wasn't planning on marrying them 
anyway. 
If you're looking for whales, you go out on Thursday night. Bankers go to Avenue and lOak on 
Thursdays. Mainly, these guys just want a girl for a night. Possibly a long weekend in Vegas or 
Miami. To meet these guys, a pretty girl just needs to hang around their table or wait for a VIP 
host or a bottle waitress to pluck her from the bar and say, Come on over and drink at this 
booth. The girls who are more experienced at this game will already be at a table with other 
men. Possibly, they will be looking to trade up, from traders to hedge funds or from hedge 
funds to celebrities. 
Speaking of girls looking to trade up, here at the table with Parker are two quotidian examples whom 
we'll call Kelly and Rebecca. Both 24, they aren't models and they aren't beautiful but they're 
young enough and pretty enough. Rebecca is quiet but smiling. Kelly says she's a freelance 
banker. They get to the bottom of their drinks quickly and often. 
Next: How most of the foreign girls girls operate. 
Kelly is wearing an eighties-style dress, all geometric shapes and latitudinous shoulders. She is hooking 
up with a 20-year-old male model but he's not here tonight and she's got her eye out for 
something else. Girls like her are either dating older men with money or young and good-
looking ones without. There is a stupendous symmetry to this. The rich old men want to be 
young and good-looking and the young ones want to be rich, but both are sleeping with the 
same girl.
