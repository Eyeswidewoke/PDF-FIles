Lodging Outlook 
As we approach the end of the year, the performance of the US lodging 
industry continues to be driven by growth in individual business and leisure 
travelers, partially offset by weak group demand. 
Where are we at the cycle' It is our belief that we are currently at the later 
innings of the recovery. RevPAR in this part of the cycle is characterized by 
flat to slightly lower occupancy levels and modest ADR growth. We note that 
transient and group ADRs are exhibiting similar behavior to the later stages of 
past cycles, showing a possible cautionary signal in which transient is first to 
lose rate power followed by group as the group booking window is 
considerably more elongated relative to transient. At this juncture, we 
anticipate RevPAR growth to further decelerate in 2018 and 2019. 
When thinking about the potential length of the current lodging cycle, we 
believe it is useful to review prior cycles (1991-'01 and 2002-'08), paying 
particularly close attention to the relationship between demand growth and 
supply growth. It is worth noting that while the current cycle has lasted 96 
months so far (since RevPAR troughed during the downturn to October 2017), 
we've had 84 months of demand growth exceeding supply growth. The real 
key to anticipating the next peak in RevPAR is simple: figure out when demand 
growth will no longer outpace supply growth. The previous cycle (2002-2018) 
only lasted 74 months (after trough demand until peak RevPAR), but the one 
prior (1991-2001) to that lasted a full 10 years (120 months after trough 
demand to peak RevPAR). In that cycle, we had 71 consecutive months of 
demand growth outpacing supply growth.

20iC: Outlook. For 2018, we believe US RevPAR will increase to $84.8 (+2.0% 
versus $83.2) owing to higher ADR of $129.1 (+2.0% versus $126.6), partially 
offset by flat occupancy of 65.7%. We note that our RevPAR forecast is 
modesty below the estimates put forth by CBRE (+2.5%), PwC (+2.5%) and 
STR (+2.2%). 
Room supply growth remained well below historical levels from 2011 to 2015; 
however, it has gradually increased since then. In October, the number of 
domestic hotel rooms increased to 5.18 million (+1.7% versus the prior 
year). Meanwhile, the number of room nights available (which reflects the 
cumulative effect of rooms opened over the past 12 months), increased by 
1.9%. Most markets have a manageable supply pipeline in the near term, 
although construction is brisk in a few markets like Nashville, New York, 
Seattle, Denver, and Dallas. Of importance, New York City-area construction 
activity (10.7% of existing supply) is concentrated in Upscale and Upper 
Midscale (select-service) hotel rooms in Midtown South/Times Square and 
outer boroughs.
