Narrative 
personal accounts at TD Bank since 2004; however, he opened two business accounts for his law office (Darren K. Indyke PLLC) 
in February and April 2019, coinciding with the opening of business accounts at TD Bank by Richard D. Kahn, under the name 
HBRK Associates Inc. This business was described to TD Bank as providing accounting and other services to Ultra High Net 
Worth individuals, however the activity in the accounts since they were opened does not suggest the existence of any clients 
other than Jeffrey Epstein. Recent civil lawsuits filed against Jeffrey Epstein's estate allege that HBRK employees worked for and 
at the direction of Jeffrey Epstein and that the employees specifically targeted underprivileged, emotionally vulnerable and/or 
economically disadvantaged young females. These allegations raise concerns regarding not only the sources of funds, but also 
the disposition of some of those funds at TD Bank (for example, included in this narrative are what appear to be payments of 
tuition for a female student through an HBRK account). Regarding S 
she is a former model and-
and has been linked to Jeffrey Epstein in media. She is included in this SAR as her accounts have been funded by Epstein-related 
entities (including the same entities funding the accounts maintained by Kahn and Indyke), however she does not appear to be 
associated with either Kahn or Indyke via any other transactional activity at TD Bank. Additional suspects for this SAR are 
referenced in the transactional analysis below. 
The inflow of funds to the affected accounts cited in this narrative follows a similar pattern, with wire transfers from accounts 
located primarily at Deutsche Bank, Charles Schwab & Co, and Firstbank Puerto Rico, sometimes including references to entities 
linked in media to Jeffrey Epstein. The wires typically list the originator's address as either c/o HBRK Associates in New York or 
an address in the US Virgin Islands that is linked in media and public records to Jeffrey Epstein (6100 Red Hook Quarter, B3, St. 
Thomas, 00802, US Virgin Islands). 
The total amount of suspicious activity cited in this SAR is $47,296,860, consisting primarily of inbound wire transfers, as well as 
a few deposited checks. The review period is 09/01/14 through 09/25/19, with suspicious activity occurring between 05/07/15 
and 08/29/19, and facts determined on 09/17/19. 
This is the first SAR filed regarding Richard Kahn, HBRK Associates Inc, JSC Interiors LLC, S
