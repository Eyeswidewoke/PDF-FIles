tax purposes, but such deduction may be limited under Sections 2806 and 162(m) of the Code for compensation paid to certain executives 
designated in those Sections. Any gain or loss recognized upon a subsequent sale or exchange of the shares is treated as capital gain or loss, as 
applicable, for which we arc not entitled to a deduction.

to be taxed at the time of grant pursuant to Section 83(b) of the Code. On the date an award of restricted stock becomes transferable or is no longer 
subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture, the holder will have ordinary• income equal to the difference between the fair market value of the shares on 
that date over the amount the holder paid for sueh shares, if any, unless the holder made an election under Section 83(b) of the Code to be taxed at 
the time of grant. If the holder makes an election under Section 83(b) of the Code, the holder will have ordinary income at the time of grant equal to 
the difference between the fair market value of the shares on the date of grant over the amount the holder paid for such shares, if any. Special rules 
apply to the receipt and disposition of restricted stock received by officers and directors who arc subject to Section 16(h) of the Exchange Act. Any 
future appreciation in the common stock will be taxable to the holder at capital gains rates. However, if the restricted stock award is later forfeited. 
the holder will not be able to recover the tax previously paid pursuant to his Section 83(b) election. We will be able to deduct, at the same time as it 
is recognized by the holder, the amount of ordinary income to the holder for federal income tax purposes, but such deduction may be limited under 
Sections 2806 and 162(m) of the Code for compensation paid to certain executives designated in those Sections.

(or cash) pursuant to a restricted stock unit award, the holder will have ordinary income equal to the fair market value of the number of shares (or 
the amount of cash) the holder actually receives with respect to the award. We will be able to deduct the amount of ordinary income to the holder 
for federal income tax purposes. but the deduction may be limited under Sections 2806 and 162(m) of the Code for ordinary income paid to certain 
executives designated in those Sections. Any gain or loss recognized upon a subsequent sale or exchange of the stock (if settled in stock) is treated 
as capital gain or loss for which we am not entitled to a deduction.

 between the fair market value of the shares on the date the conunon stock

at the same time as it is recognized by the holder. the amount of ordinary income to the holder for federal income tax purposes. but such deduction 
may be limited under Sections 2806 and 162(m) of the Code for compensation paid to certain executives designated in those Sections. Any gain or 
loss recognized upon a subsequent sale or exchange of the stock is treated as capital gain or loss for which we are not entitled to a deduction.

award is granted. Upon receipt of cash in settlement of the award, the holder will recognize ordinary income equal to the cash reeeived, and we will
