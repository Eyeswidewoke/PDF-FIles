same changes that plainly have to do with maturation and th= very specific internal concepts of human cognition, 
leading finally to un=erstanding of extremely refined visual concepts, all with only minimal exp=rience that can't be 
directing these developments any more than the nu=rition of the embryo, while obviously necessary for development, 
can deter=ine that we have a mammalian rather than visual system. There are al=o some quite intriguing differences. 
E.g., at the age when sighted c=ildren acquire the words/concepts see, look at, etc., blind childre= also do, but 
necessarily give a tactile rather than visual interpretation= So for the blind child, to look at something is to touch it, and 
to=see it is to grasp what it is. The child is therefore surprised to f=nd that its mother cannot see the back of the dolls 
they are holding, sinc= the child can. Lots of results like these. 
What is par=icularly striking, however, is how similar the cognitive growth is to norm=l physical growth, 
of course elicited by experience but then substantially=following its internally determined path. The widely-held belief 
tha= cognitive development is somehow different from the rest of biology in th=t it is experience-determined is, I think, 
a residue of traditional dualis= -- a kind of "methodological dualism," which is, I think, more =ernicious than traditional 
metaphysical dualism, which, in fact, was quite=serious and reasonable science at the time. 
Long story.
