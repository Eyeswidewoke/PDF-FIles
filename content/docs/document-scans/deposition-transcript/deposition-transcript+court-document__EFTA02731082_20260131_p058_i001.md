Epstein, and

recalled that 
already knew exactly what to do and what Epstein liked sexually.
recalled 
Epstein saying that other than Maxwell, 
was the best for picking up girls. When asked to 
describe specific instances in which 
personally observed 
recruit someone, 
El 
said she did not recall actually seeing 
recruiting anyone, and added that she and 
did not really get along, and 
did not see her much. When asked whether-
had other sexual experiences with 
she said there were "tons" and "too many to count." 
generally described Maxwell and Epstein directing her to engage in sex acts with 
other men. Although we did not delve into the details of this topic, 
volunteered some 
information about it, 
used the term "lent out" to describe instances in which Maxwell or 
Epstein directed her to have sexual contact with other men. Her first memory of being "lent out" 
was after Epstein paid for her to get an apartment in Florida and after Maxwell had gotten her a 
cellphone. One day, Maxwell told 
to massage Glen and Eva Dubin and explicitly told 
that she had to do to Glen what 
did for Epstein, which 
understood to 
mean engage in sex acts. 
added that at some point, Maxwell and Epstein told 
that they were going to "test me out" with other people, which she needed to do in order to be a 
"real" massage therapist. With respect to Prince Andrew,' 
recalled that Maxwell told 
that she was going to meet a prince and should make him happy and do the exact same 
things for him that she did for Epstein because the prince was a good friend of Maxwell's. 
explained that she was "lent out" so many times that she began using drugs, and 
she cannot estimate how many times she was "lent out" to other people. She recalls being "lent 
out" to some people multiple times, and some people just once. Sometimes Maxwell would 
direct 
to engage in sex acts with other men, and sometimes Epstein would do so. When 
in New York, either Maxwell or Epstein would call 
to the massage room and direct her 
to engage in sex with a man there. 
said that she was never paid by any of these other 
men for the sexualized massages she provided. 
does not recall any conversations about 
money taking place in front of any of the men to whom she was "lent out." 
also 
mentioned Alan Dershowitz, but we did not fully explore the details of her interactions with him. 
When asked whether she was aware of any other girls who were "lent out" like 
she said that 
was a participant in sex acts with "lots" of third parties. She also said 
that 
was "lent out" and that 
and 
were "lent out" together.' 
54 We are in the process of obtaining the name of a lawyer who represents Prince Andrew. Once 
we have this contact information, we plan to request an interview.
