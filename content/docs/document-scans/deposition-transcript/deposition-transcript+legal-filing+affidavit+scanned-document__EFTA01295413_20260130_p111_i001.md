2004 Ohio 6250, *; 2004 Ohio App. LEXIS 5682, ** 
we conclude that Hanlin-Rainaldi's alternative assignment of error as asserted in its reply 
brief is improperly raised. Therefore, finding that Hanlin-Rainaldi's alternative assignment 
of error is improperly raised, we decline to address it. 
r P25] [HN5] Appellate review of a lower court's granting of summary judgment is de 
novo. Mitnaul v. Fairmount Presbyterian Church, 149 Ohio App.3d 769, 2002 Ohio 5833, 
at P27, 778 N.E.2d 1093. " r 13) 'De novo review means that this court uses the same 
standard that the trial court should have used, and we examine the evidence to determine 
whether as a matter of law no genuine issues exist for trial.' " Id., quoting Brewer v. 
Cleveland Bd. of Edn. (1997), 122 Ohio App.3d 378, 701 N.E.2d 1023, citing Dupler v. 
Mansfield Journal Co., Inc. (1980), 64 Ohio St.2d 116, 119-120, 413 N.E.2d 1187, 
certiorari denied (1981), 452 U.S. 962, 101 S. Ct. 3111, 69 L. Ed. 2d 973. 
r P26] [FINS] Summary judgment is proper when a movant for summary judgment 
demonstrates: (1) no genuine issue of material fact exists; (2) the movant is entitled to 
judgment as a matter of law; and (3) reasonable minds could come to but one conclusion 
and that conclusion is adverse to the party against whom the motion for summary 
judgment is made, that party being entitled to have the evidence most strongly construed 
in its favor. Civ.R. 56; State ex rel. Grady v. State Emp. Relations Bd. (1997), 78 Ohio St. 
3d 181, 183, 1997 Ohio 221, 677 N.E.2d 343. 
ITV] [HN7] Under Civ.R. 56(C), a movant bears the initial burden of informing the trial 
court of the basis for the motion r 14] and identifying those portions of the record 
demonstrating the absence of a material fact. Dresher v. Burt (1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 280, 
293, 1996 Ohio 107, 662 N.E.2d 264. Once a movant discharges its initial burden, 
summary judgment is appropriate if the nonmoving party does not respond, by affidavit or 
as otherwise provided in Civ.R. 56, with specific facts showing that a genuine issue exists 
for trial. Id.; Vahila v. Hall (1997), 77 Ohio St.3d 421, 430, 1997 Ohio 259, 674 N.E.2d 
1164; Civ.R. 56(E). 
r P28] In its assignment of error, Hanlin-Rainaldi asserts the trial court erred when it 
applied the parol evidence rule to bar Jeepers' subsequent conduct when determining that 
the August 2001 agreement released Jeepers of its obligations under Note 1. 
r P29] [HN8] '"The parol evidence rule is not a rule of evidence but of substantive law.... 
It prohibits the consideration of evidence as to anything which happened prior to or 
simultaneously with the making of a contract which would vary the terms of the 
agreement.'" Thompson v. First Citizens Bank & Trust Co. (2002), 151 N.C.App. 704, 708-
709, 567 S.E.2d 184, quoting Harrell v. First Union Natl. Bank (1985), 76 N.C.App. 666, 
667, 334 S.E.2d 109, 110, ("15] affirmed (1986), 316 N.C. 191, 340 S.E.2d 111. Accord 
Ed Schory & Sons, Inc. v. Society Natl. Bank (1996), 75 Ohio St. 3d 433, 440, 1996 Ohio 
194, 662 N.E.2d 1074; Natl. City Bank, Akron v. Donaldson (1994), 95 Ohio App.3d 241, 
244-245, 642 N.E.2d 58. "'Generally, the parol evidence rule prohibits the admission of 
evidence to contradict or add to the terms of a clear and unambiguous contract."' 
Thompson, supra, at 709, quoting Hansen v. DHL Laboratories (1994), 316 S.C. 505, 508, 
450 S.E.2d 624, affirmed (1995), 319 S.C. 79, 459 S.E.2d 850. Accord Citicasters Co. v. 
Bricker & Eckler, L.L.P., 149 Ohio App.3d 705, 2002 Ohio 5814, at P7, 778 N.E.2d 663.
