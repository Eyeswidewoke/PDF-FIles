orders that aggregate 100 shares or more without having those orders consolidated into round-lots as far

facts relative to certain of its customers and orders it accepted for execution; violated NYSE Rule 342 by 
failing to reasonably supervise and implement adequate controls, including separate system of follow-up

NASD Fines BRUT $2.2 Million for rule violations relating to publication of erroneous 
order execution quality reports, backing away from the 
firm's posted quotes, failure to maintain two-sided 
quotations, failure to comply with the rules applicable 
to trade-throughs and locked and/or crossed markets, 
non-retention of emails, OATS deficiencies and 
inadequate supervision. In addition to the fine. BRUT 
agreed to revise certain of the firm's written supervisory 
procedures within 30 days. NASD found that from October 2001 shortly after the 
requirement to publish order execution reports took 
effect through July 2005, BRUT published execution 
reports that contained critical errors. Specifically, when 
subscribers of BRUT's ECN entered orders that included 
a "reserve size component." BRUT& treatment of these 
reserve size orders resulted in execution reports that did 
not include the full size of each such order.. 09/01/2006, Financial Industry Reg. Auth. (FINRA)
