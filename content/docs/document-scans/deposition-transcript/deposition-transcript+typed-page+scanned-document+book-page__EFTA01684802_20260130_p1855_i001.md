discovering the store won't take it back. When you use your Card for 
eligible purchases, there's no need to worry. If you try to return a 
designated item within 90 days from the date of purchase and the 
merchant won't take it back, American Express will refund the full 
purchase price, up to 5300 per item, excluding shipping and 
handling, up to a maximum of $1,000 annually per Card account.*
