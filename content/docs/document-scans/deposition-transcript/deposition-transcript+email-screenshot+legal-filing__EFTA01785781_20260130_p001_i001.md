you not only time, but countless dollars, and isn't somethi=g that can be readily bought. I had people working also for

to people who promise to help, but end up p=oviding nothing, and so, I end up having to do it myself. What do I get

We w=re trying to fix up your mess. I didn't create it. Just thought it would b= something to help. This was NEVER about 
trying to pull money out of=you, and fact, we have don't everything possible to keep the costs down considerably. 
I must talk to you about the Hand thing asap. When can we do that?
