With all due respect this has always been our account and earlier in the year I told you that Liz was going to pursue the 
account and if the need arose where you could be of help we would happily include you. Liz and I went to Marc's office 
just a few months ago and have had an ongoing dialogue with him as well and we were caught completely off guard when 
we learned that you were speaking with him about doing a trade in our account.. I was very surprised to learn that IPO 
paperwork was signed unbeknownst to us for an account domiciled in the branch. While partnership is encouraged it is 
not at the expense of confidentiality and trade supervision. I am concerned about how this progressed and would like to sit 
down with you and Michael to make sure that this doesn't happen again. 
Kind regards, 
Jim

All, Marc Schwartz, head of the Broad Family Office, called me a bit ago as a result of a phone call from PCS (see 
below). Liz had raised concerns to him about our internal politics. He asked me if it was "OK to have called me for the 
trade". You see, I had always told him that we could place the trade in the existing account and never had shared that it 
was a PCS account that would need to be moved, who would get "credit", or any of these internal battles. Prior to Liz's 
call, he just assumed we were one happy family. I reassured him that he need not concern himself with our internal 
politics and that we are all operating as a cohesive delivery model to serve his needs. I do not believe we should be air 
our laundry with our clients, especially burgeoning ones where significant new business might follow. 
I believe our new colleague, Lee Hutter, knows Marc well and can assist in resolving these issues within the month. I am 
happy to let it lie until then. I am sorry we could not reach an amicable solution before the client was brought in to the
