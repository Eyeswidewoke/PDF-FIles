Country Singer Dating Director Patel Sues a Utah Man for Claiming She Is a 'Honeypot' Israeli Spy 
The Salt Lake Tribune (11/05, Schreifels) reported that country singer Alexis Wilkins, who is dating Director Patel, 
has filed a $5 million defamation lawsuit against a Utah social media influencer — arguing the man fabricated his 
claim that she's an Israeli spy and is using his tale as "fund-raising click-bait." According to the article, her federal 
lawsuit targets Utahn Sam Parker, who once ran for Congress and now frequently posts on social media. He has 
nearly 100,000 followers on his "BasedSamParker" X account, where he has asked them for financial support. The 
Tennessee woman alleges in her lawsuit that Parker has repeatedly lied about her online, falsely asserting that she 
is an Israeli "honeypot" agent who began her relationship with Director Patel to "manipulate and compromise" him 
in his role as Director. The article detailed that the lawsuit alleges that Parker posted defamatory statements about 
Wilkins on X that he either knew were false or posted with "reckless disregard for the truth." Director Patel, who 
has come under fire recently for using an FBI jet to travel to see Wilkins perform, shared a lengthy post on 
X defending her. "The disgustingly baseless attacks against Alexis — a true patriot and the woman I'm proud to call 
my partner in life — are beyond pathetic," he wrote. "She is a rock-solid conservative and a country music 
sensation who has done more for this nation than most will in ten lifetimes. I'm so blessed she's in my life." The 
Independent (11/05, Cockburn) also reported that four FBI agents had a rollercoaster start to the week after being 
fired on Monday, rehired later the same day, but then fired again on Tuesday, as Director Patel sought to remove 
agents who helped investigate Donald Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election results. Director Patel initially 
fired the agents on Monday, but it is reported that, following pushback from US Attorney Jeanine Pirro of the 
District of Columbia and others, he reinstated them the same day. But by Tuesday morning, he relieved them of 
their duties again. Daily Beast (11/05, Thompson) and Daily Mail (11/05, Peterson, Lepore) also reported on the 
story. Hindustan Times (11/05, Video) provided broadcast coverage on the story. 
Maryland to Sue Trump Admin Over FBI Headquarters 
The Baltimore Sun (11/05, Mause) reported that Maryland is suing the Trump administration for abandoning 
Greenbelt in favor of a new FBI headquarters in downtown Washington, D.C., according to people familiar with the 
state's plan. According to the article, the lawsuit is a last-ditch effort to save years of work by state officials and 
lawmakers to land the coveted new headquarters, finally succeeding, only to see the Trump administration 
dismantle the dream in a matter of months. Sen. Angela Alsobrooks mentioned the possibility of a lawsuit after the 
Senate voted last week to approve funding for the FBI headquarters to move to the Ronald Reagan Building. The 
Reagan Building formerly housed the United States Agency for International Development before it was shuttered 
earlier this year by the administration. The White House referred the reporting outlet to the DOJ. The DOJ did not 
respond prior to publication. The article explained that Alsobrooks said last week that she believes the 
administration has violated a 2022 law that designated three potential sites for the new FBI headquarters. 
Greenbelt was ultimately selected by the General Services Administration, the agency that oversees many federal 
buildings and properties. Washington, D.C., was not on the list of sites. The Baltimore Banner (11/05, Wood), WJLA 
(ABC-7) (11/05, Bell), and WBFF (FOX-45) (11/05, Curtis) also reported on the story. 
Book by Ex-FBI Agent Details Portrait of Indiana Grave Robber 
Indy Star (11/05, Bongiovanni) reported that former FBI agent Tim Carpenter has written a book called "The Grave 
Robber" about the case of Don Miller, who stole thousands of cultural artifacts and human remains from Native 
American graves. According to the article, in 2014, the FBI seized over 5,000 artifacts and 2,000 human bones from 
Miller's home in Rush County, Indiana, with the remains being stored in moldy and disrespectful conditions. The 
article noted that Carpenter's book reveals the details of the case and the efforts to repatriate the artifacts and 
remains to their countries of origin, with about 96% of the seized items having been returned to countries including 
Peru, Canada, and China. 
Epstein Claimed Prosecutors Offered His Freedom if He Agreed to Implicate President Trump 
The New York Post (11/05, Tillett) reported that Jeffrey Epstein claimed New York federal prosecutors told him he 
could walk free if he agreed to implicate Donald Trump, according to his ex-cellmate. The article detailed that after 
his arrest on child sex-trafficking charges in July 2019, Epstein was transferred to the Metropolitan Correctional 
Center in Manhattan — where he shared a cell with ex-cop Nicholas Tartaglione, who was awaiting trial before 
being convicted on a quadruple-murder charge. Tartaglione, 57, now claims that Epstein, who died a month after 
being arrested, told him prosecutors had offered to cut a deal if he'd snitch on Trump, who was then in his first 
term. "Prosecutors ... told Epstein that if he said President Trump was involved with Esptein's crimes he would walk 
free," Tartaglione claims in a pardon application filed in July and obtained by the reporting outlet. The filing
