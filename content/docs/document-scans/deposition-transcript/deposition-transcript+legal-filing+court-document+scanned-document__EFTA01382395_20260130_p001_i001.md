balance of the ASC Notes plus funds sufficient to pay interest thereon for three years. ASC granted to SuperValu a security interest in its 
rights under the escrow agreement to secure reimbursement to SuperValu of any amounts paid by SuperValu under its guarantee of the 
ASC Notes. The ASC Indenture contains, solely for the benefit of the 2037 ASC Notes (but not any other series of the ASC Notes)

Anticipated Refinancing Facilities 
We have had preliminary discussions with potential lenders, financial intermediaries and advisors and following the consummation 
of this offering, subject to market conditions, we intend to enter into new financing facilities, consisting of the S4,000 million New ABL 
Loan Agreement, the New Term Loan Agreement (which we expect to be in the form of an amended and restated version of the 
ABS/Safeway Term Loan Agreement described above), and an indenture governing the New Notes. The New Financing Facilities are 
expected to extend the weighted average maturity of our indebtedness, reduce the amount of our secured indebtedness and provide use 
with more flexibility to pursue various transactions than we have under the restrictive covenants in our existing indebtedness.
