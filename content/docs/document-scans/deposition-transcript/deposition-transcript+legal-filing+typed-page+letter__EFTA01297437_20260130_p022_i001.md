Jeffrey Epstein, Billionaire Pedophile, Goes Free 
Page 6 of 7 
could have landed Epstein in prison for 20 years. Brad Edwards, attorney for seven of the victims, confirms the 
existence of an earlier draft of the non-prosecution agreement, officially under seal, in which it appears that Epstein 
"committed, at some point, to a 1O-year federal sentence." But in the end Epstein's legal team refused that deal and 
threatened to proceed to trial. And that's where the question of whether the case was "winnable" before a jury again 
came into play, according to a source in the U.S Attorney's Office, which shared the state attorney's view that the 
prosecution was far from a slam dunk. 
For one, it was clear from the stan that Epstein would spare no legal expense and that his team of veteran lawyers, 
whose cases ranged from O.J. Simpson to the investigation of Clinton's relationship with an intent, would play rough. 
When the Palm Beach police started to identify victims, according to Detective Joe Recarey's report, Dershowitz began 
sending the detective Facebook and MySpace posts to demonstrate that sonic of these girls were no angels. Reiter's 
deposition also states that he heard from local private investigators that Dershowitz had launched background checks 
on both the police chief and Det. Recarey. Dershowitz denies all of that. According to Reiter, both he and Recarey also 
became aware that they were under surveillance for several months, without knowing who ordered it. And the Florida 
victims began to complain that they and family members were being followed and intimidated by private investigators 
who were then linked to local attorneys in Epstein's employ. In one reported instance, the private investigator claimed 
to be a police officer, and Reiter considered filing witness-tampering charges. 
The credibility of the victims was also an issue; they had never complained of their treatment by Epstein until they 
were contacted by police, and they may have voluntarily returned to the Palm Beach mansion several times. Many of 
the girls came from disadvantaged backgrounds or broken homes, and they were susceptible to Epstein's cash, 
intimidation, and charm. Those who were 16 when they went to El Brillo Way would have been in their zos by the time 
they took the stand, and Epstein's investigators had dredged up every instance of bad behavior in their pasts. 
According to an exchange in the Reiter deposition, a few of the victims had worked in West Palm Beach at massage 
parlors known as lack shacks." Each new compromising detail was immediately forwarded to the State Attorney's 
Office, where staff met frequently with Epstein's lawyers. 
The Florida statutes are clear: Any person older than 24 who engages in sexual contact with someone under the age of 
18 commits a felony of the second degree. The victim's prior sexual conduct is not relevant; ignorance of her age is no 
defense. She needn't resist physically to cast doubt on the issue of "consent." For a child under 16, even lewd behavior 
short of touching is a felony of the second degree. But convincing ajury that a sexual encounter is a heinous crime is 
difficult if the victim can be made to appear willing and unharmed, not to mention vulgar and mercenary. It wasn't 
hard to imagine some of the victims quickly being discredited in court by Epstein's crack legal team, who repeatedly 
noted that the age of consent is lower in many other states. 
But that doesn't quite explain why the Department of Justice would forgo the child-trafficking charges, which pertain 
regardless of a girl's attitude or character. Epstein's final sentence is so out of line with the statutory guidelines for that 
crime that it appears the department may have been influenced by the existence of his many powerful friends and 
attorneys. A highly intelligent man who once taught math at the Dalton School in New York without a bachelor's 
degree, Epstein has been a serious and respected player in the highest reaches of politics and philanthropy. He has 
made substantial contributions to political candidates, served on the Council on Foreign Relations, and donated S30 
million to Harvard University. 
Moreover, many of his high-powered acquaintances availed themselves of Epstein's private jets, for which the pilot 
logs, obtained by discovery in the civil suits, sometimes showed that bold-face names were on the same flights as
