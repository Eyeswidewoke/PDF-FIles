<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:18.0pt">Oct 14, 2013 -- Mom=nts after Hanan Porat and his fellow Israeli 
paratroopers had crossed the =uez Canal as spearheads of a furious Israeli counterattack in the 1973 Yom=Kippur War, 
he was severely wounded 
in an Egyptian mortar bombardment. The Egyptians and Syrians had surprised=lsrael on Yom Kippur, with an atrocious 
loss of life, and crushed the coun=ry's post-Six Day War belief in its own invincibility.&nbsp; As Porat la= recovering in 
his hospital bed, his chest 
ravaged by shrapnel wounds, he thanked God that he wasn't in the burn un=t. And then, as

revealed.</span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:18.0pt">He read, in his hos=ital bed, an article in a kibbutz newspaper by 
a writer named Arnon Lapid,=titled, "An Invitation to Weeping." Porat wasn't a member of the secul=r kibbutz elite; he 
was a member of a more 
marginalized group of religious Zionists, who envied the kibbutznikim, and=respected them as well.&nbsp; He was 
stunned by what Lapid wrote: "I wan= to send you all an invitation to weeping ... I will weep over my dead, yo= will weep 
over yours ... we'll weep ... for 
the illusions that were shattered, for the assumptions that were proven to=be baseless, the truths that were exposed as 
lies ... And we will pity our=elves, for we are worthy of pity."&nbsp; Halevi writes that when Porat r=ad this lament he 
"felt as if his wounds 
were being torn open. He would have shouted if he had the voice. Pity the =eneration privileged to restore Jewish 
sovereignty to the land of Israel? =hat small-mindedness, what weakness of character! Where would the Jews be =ow if, 
in 1945, they had thought 
like this Arnon Lapid? Israelis would do now what Jews always did: Grieve =or their dead and go on, with faith and 
hope."&nbsp; Porat would soon he=p usher into existence a new movement, a settlement enterprise that would =e self-
consciously modeled on Israel's 
original settler movement, the socialist, Zionist and fiercely anti-religi=us pioneering formations that built the original 
kibbutzim. The early kibb=tznikim were the men and women who laid the foundations for the reborn Jew=sh state and 
led that state through 
the first decades of its existence, but by 1973 they appeared to be a spen= force, exhausted spiritually, morally and 
politically.&nbsp; Porat's mo=ement, which would cover the biblical heartland of the Jewish people with =ettlements --
a heartland the secular 
world referred to as the West Bank, but which Jews knew by the ancient nam=s of Judea and Samaria -- would be driven 
by devotion to God and his deman=s, not by a secular vision of Jews liberated from the ghettoes and freed f=om the 
fetters of capitalism.</span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:18.0pt">This movement, whic= coalesced around Porat's Gush Emunim --
the "Bloc of the Faithful" =- has defined Israel's political agenda for the past 40 years, just as t=e kibbutz movement and 
its leaders shaped Israel
