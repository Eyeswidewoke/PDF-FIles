Steve Kroft: They're dangerous? Ray LaHood: I don't want to=say they're unsafe. But they're dangerous. I would agree 
with that. Steve Kro=t: If you were going to take me someplace, any place in the country, to illustrate the problem, 
where would=you take me? Ray LaHood: There is a lot of places we could go. You could go to any major city in America 
and see roads= and bridges, and infrastructure that need to be fixed today. They need to b= fixed today. 
Steve Kroft: We decided to start in Pittsburgh, which may have the most serious problem in the coun=ry. Our guide was 
Andy Herrmann, a past president of the American Society of=Civil Engineers. Steve Kroft: From up here you can see why 
they call it the city of bridges. Andy Herrmann: Yeah. Between the highway and the railroad bridges. There&4=9;s many 
of them. Steve Kroft: And most of them old. Andy Herr=ann: Most of them old. They're nearing the end of their useful 
lives, yeah. There are more than more than 4,000 bridges in metropolitan Pittsburgh and 20 percent of them are 
structurally deficient, including one of the cit='s main arteries. Steve Kroft: This is the Liberty Bridge ahead? An 
important bridge for Pittsburgh. Andy Herrma=n: A very important bridge for Pittsburgh. A connection from the south 
to the city itself, and then to the north. It was built in 1928 when cars and trucks were much lighter. It was designed to 
last 50 years -- that was 86 years ago. Every day in Pittsburgh five million people travel across bridges that either need to 
be replaced o= undergo major repairs. Andy Herrmann: One of these arch bridges actually has a structure built under it 
to catch falling deck. See that structure underneath it? They actually built that to catch any of the falling concrete so it 
wouldn't hit traffic underneath=it. Steve Kroft: That's amazing. 
Andy Herrmann: It all comes do=n to funding. Right now they can't keep up with it. Three hundred bridges become 
structurally defici=nt each year in the state of Pennsylvania. That's one percent added to the already 23 percent they 
already have. They just ca='t fix them fast enough. Pennsylvania is one of the worst states in country when it comes to 
the condition of its infrastructure, and Philadelphia isn't any better off than Pittsburgh.=C24> Nine million people a day 
travel over 900 bridges classified as structurally deficient, some of them on a heavily traveled section of I.95. Ed Rendell 
is a former Democratic governor of Pennsylvania. Steve Kroft: How critical is this stretch of I-95 to the country? 
Ed Rendell: It&=39;s a nation's number one highway. Twenty-two miles of it goes through the city of Philadelphia. There 
are 15 struc=urally deficient bridges in that 22-mile stretch. And to fix them would cost seven billion dollars -- t= fix all 
the roads and the structurally deficient bridges in that 22-mile stretch. Rendell says no one knows where the money is 
going to come from and this stretch of I.95 has already had on= brush with disaster. In 2008 two contractors from the 
Pennsylvania Department of Transportation stopped to g=t a sausage sandwich, and parked their cars under this bridge. 
Ed Rendell= And fortunately they wanted that sausage sandwich because they saw one of these piers with an eight foot 
gas= in it about five inches wide. And oh, they knew automatically that this bridge=was in deep trouble. Politicians in 
Washington don't have the political courage to say, 'This is wha= we have to do.'" 
=1span> 
The section of I-95 was immediately shut d=wn and blocked off while construction crews buttressed the column with 
steel girders. It=was closed for three days, creating havoc in Philadelphia. But the city was luc=y. Ed Rendell: I mean, it 
was unbelievable. It's so fortuitous. Steve Kroft: And if they hadn't wanted a sausage sandwich? Ed Rendell: There's a
