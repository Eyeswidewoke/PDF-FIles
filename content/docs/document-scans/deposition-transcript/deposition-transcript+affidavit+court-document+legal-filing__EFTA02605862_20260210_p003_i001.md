&=uot;Four Witnesses reported during the investigation that Respondent once =ade a 
comment in the presence of employees about the physical characterist=cs of Amber Heard, an actress and female visitor 
at Origins Project event.=Specifically, during the Johnny Depp event on February 16, 2016, that Resp=ndent, while 
getting everyone together to take a picture with Johnny Depp,=said, "get your hot ass over here" when attempting to 
get =tuber to join the picture. During this same event, two witnesses allege tha= Respondent told Heard, "Your ass looks 
great." Employees =lso indicate that he talked about how "hot she was". =/div> 
When asked if he ever commented on a female=E24).4>s buttocks in front of employees, 
Respondent stated, "Whoa= not that I...I can't imagine doing that". Responden= stated, "Generally, I would say that is 
not a good idea" =ut added that if someone asked his opinion about someone, he might respond= When asked if he ever 
made comments about Amber Heard's body, Res=ondent stated, "No. Amber Heard is an incredibly attractive 
woman,=and everybody understands that and everybody said it, and she is".= 
R=spondent stated that he did not remember telling Heard that her "a=s" looked good. 
He stated, "I don't remember sayin= it, but it's the kind of thing that a close friend would say to a=close friend in the 
context of [asking for wardrobe advice], but I certain=y don't remember it, but we were very, very close." Respon=ent 
stated that making such comments in the workplace would be outside of =ormal conduct for him, but "if it would've 
happened, it wo=ld have not been at the Origins offices. It would have been in the middle =f an event when we were 
celebrating". 
Factual Determination: Four witn=sses heard Respondent make the statement. 
Although Respondent stated he di= not remember saying this, he did acknowledge that it is the kind of thing=that a 
close friend would say. It is more likely than not that Respondent =ade the statements. "

Hey Lawrence. 
<=span> 
I'm glad to hear from you although, of=course, I am saddened that it is under these 
circumstances. 
Here is my res=onse, which you may forward to the University if you wish:</=iv> 
I do not recall this o= any incident between us as being inappropriate. I also feel deeply 
for an=one who feels as though they have been the subject of any unwanted attenti=n in this way, so I hope this can 
provide any clarity on your situation. =C24> 
Lawrenc= Krauss was a close friend, and as I recall his behavior towards me was gr=cious 
and kind during our visits to the Origins Project. I don4>=99t recall any such comments by him backstage at the Origins 
event, and mo=e generally remember no inappropriate comments toward me at any time, eith=r in public or backstage 
during the events, or at our home or elsewhere, a=d we left all of our interactions with both him, and his Origins staff, 
fe=ling very well treated. The Origins events were a highlight for me. <=span> 
I hope this lays this issue to rest. 
Due to the public nature of =y life and the uniquely public circumstances surrounding 
aspects of my mar=iage and divorce to my ex-husband (who participated in the Origins event m=ntioned above), I 
request that this statement be used internally by the un=versity only. Thank you. 
Best regards
