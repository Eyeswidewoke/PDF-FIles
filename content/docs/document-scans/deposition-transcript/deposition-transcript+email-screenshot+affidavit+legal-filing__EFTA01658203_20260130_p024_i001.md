McCarthy Introduces Legislation To Sanction Foreign Hackers Targeting COVID-19 
Research. 
The Hill (7/21, Miller, 2.98M) reports House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) on Tuesday 
"introduced legislation to sanction foreign hackers involved in attempts to target and steal 
research on COVID-19 vaccines and treatments." The Defend COVID Research from Hackers Act 
"would allow the president to impose sanctions on foreign individuals engaging in hacking 
activity that compromises economic and national security or public health, and freeze any 
American assets of these individuals." The bill also "requires the Secretary of State, in 
consultation with the DNI, to submit a report to Congress within 180 days of the bill's passage 
on `the extent of known cyber-enabled activities or attempted cyber-enabled activities' around 
COVID-19." McCarthy "said in a statement that Congress should take steps to protect American 
researchers working on a `Victory Vaccine' to combat COVID-19, vowing that the US would 
share any vaccine it developed with the world." 
White House Threatens To Veto NDAA Over Intelligence Sharing Proposals. 
NextGov (7/21, Baksh) reports the White House is threatening "to veto the National Defense 
Authorization Act if it contains a number of provisions from the House, including those for 
public-private cyber threat intelligence sharing activities recommended by the Cyberspace 
Solarium Commission." A statement of Administration policy released Tuesday "says that 
sections of the House bill `calling for a cyber threat information collaboration environment (Sec. 
1631) and defense industrial base participation in a threat intelligence sharing program (Sec. 
1632) `do not adequately reflect the DNI's statutory responsibility to protect intelligence 
sources and methods with regard to cybersecurity threat intelligence related to information 
systems operated by agencies within the Intelligence Community." The proposals are based "on 
recommendations from the Cyberspace Solarium Commission, and their inclusion was 
celebrated by commission members such as Rep. Jim Langevin (D-RI)." 
Ignatius: US Has Stronger Hand In Its Tech Battle With China. 
In his column in the Washington Post (7/21, 14.2M), David Ignatius writes, "New US sanctions 
against the Chinese telecom giant Huawei are beginning to bite hard, with a British assessment 
predicting that the firm may begin running out of complex, US-designed semiconductors and 
other gear during the next year. The shortage could cripple parts of its business. ... US and 
Chinese analysts have both warned in interviews that this technology conflict is leading to a 
decoupling of the global tech market that might leave both nations worse off." He adds, 
"America and its allies also have vulnerabilities." Beijing signaled Monday that it might retaliate 
by imposing sanctions on Nokia and Ericsson, which depend on some Chinese components." A 
Chinese diplomat in Europe recently offered a menacing warning: `We treat our friends with fine 
wine, but for our enemies we have shotguns.' Tough talk. But in the Huawei fight, it turns out, 
the heavy weapons seem to be on the American side." 
House-Approved Defense Bill Would Ban TikTok From Government Devices. 
The Hill (7/21, Rodrigo, 2.98M) reports an amendment "banning the use of TikTok on 
government devices was successfully attached to the annual defense policy approved by the 
House Tuesday." The proposal, brought by Rep. Ken Buck (D-CO), "would bar federal employees 
from downloading the short-form video app onto government-issued devices." A spokesperson 
for TikTok "said in a statement to The Hill that the company's app is for 'for entertainment and 
creative expression, which we recognize is not what federal government devices are for.'"
