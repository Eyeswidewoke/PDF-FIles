Let's set up a time to discuss when Brad is back next week. Some of these requests seem ureasonable. and AML 
should already have a lot of this info, particularly anything relating to Jeffrey Epstein personally (since we have so 
many accounts for him). 
As for Chip's email. it predates me. And the other people on the email are no longer at DB. So I don't see how I 
can get hold of the full email. But again, Jeffrey has been through a complete rep risk process here and has been 
signed off on repeatedly by management as we've done any KYC remediation or new account opening. 
Anyway, let's regroup nem week so we can go back to AML with a comprehensive set of responses. 
Thanks
