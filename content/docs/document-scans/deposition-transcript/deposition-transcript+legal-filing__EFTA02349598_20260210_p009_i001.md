A decision against Obamacare would kick millions of people, mainly living in red states, off their health plans -- =nd leave 
them looking to the Republican Congress for a solution. 
Congressional Republicans want Americans -- especial'= the nine on the Supreme Court -- to think the GOP can do in less 
than five mont=s what it took Democrats decades to achieve: enact comprehensive health care reform legislation. But 
given that Republicans have been unable to reach consensus on much beyond repealing Obamacare in the last five 
years, that's an ambitious timeline4=A0 This pattern has been repeating itself since 2009. Two weeks ago, House 
Republicans approved yet another bill (the 56th time) to repeal the Affordab=e Care Act, and this one included language 
charging three House committee cha=rmen with devising a replacement plan. 
Meanwhile, Senate Finance Committee Chair Orrin Hatch=(Utah), Sen. Richard Burr (N.C.) and House Energy and 
Commerce Committee Chairman F=ed Upton (Mich.) unveiled the GOP's latest attempt to construct an Obamaca=e 
alternative. Although the proposal is virtually identical to the one that Hatch and Burr issued a year ago with then-Sen. 
Tom Coburn (R-Okla.), the duo -- along with Upton -- scored headl=nes describing their framework as the Obamacare 
replacement plan. But rem=rks from House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) on Thursday underscore how far 
congressional Republicans are from having an actual alternative in place. "Clearly, our three=chairmen have an awful lot 
of work to do to come up with our replacement. But I would expect=all of this to be part of the discussion -- all of it. 
Listen, there's a lot of ideas out the=e," Boehner said. "The key is going to be to boil those concepts =own to what a real 
replacement would look like."

The problem is that their proposal doesn't make things better even if they can get a consensus of support. The Hatch-
Burr-Upton pro=osal is a case study in the difficult trade-offs Republicans would eventually have to negotiate among 
their members and supporters -- and then defend to the broader public= Relative to Obamacare, the Republican 
proposal would provide financial assistance to fewer people and cut off aid at a low=r income level. It would also roll 
back Obamacare's Medicaid expansion, replacing it with a tax credit for =uying private insurance; eliminate regulations 
that guarantee all policies includ= comprehensive benefits; and, among other things, give insurers more leeway =o vary 
premiums by age.

Republicans promote these changes as increasing =E2$4choice" and "flexibility" in in=urance, claiming that they will 
result in less federal spending and that younger adults will pay lower prices. But each of these proposed changes would 
carry other consequences as well. Polici=s without full benefits, including "junk" plans and=mini-med policies, would 
return to the market. The same pricing practices that reduced premiums for 25-year-olds would jack them up=for 60-
year-olds, putting insurance out of reach for many older Americans...A0 And the proposal's precise effect on the 
uninsured is hard to tell, but under the prevailing assumptions of most for=casting models -- including those used by the 
Congressional Budget Office -- the li=ely impact would be more people without insurance and/or much weaker financial 
protection, as an analysis of last year's plan by the Center on Bud=et and Policy Priorities suggested.
