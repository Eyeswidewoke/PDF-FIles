It is really horrendous to be continually used to hurt people you care =eeply about by the newspapers. It is beyond any 
words, as you know. 
I know you spoke to James. I of all people understand what it feels like =o be castagated by the Tabloids. I know how you 
feel. 
I know you also feel hellaciously let down by me, from what you were =ither told or read, and I must humbly apologise 
to you and your heart for =hat. You have always been a steadfast, generous and supreme friend to me and my =amily. 
As you know I did absolutely not say the P. Word about you. But =nderstand it was reported that I did. 
However, I am apologising to you today for not replying to your email, =r reaching out to you when the tabloids were so 
vicious and horrendous... =n the weeks leading up to that monday when I made my statement. And then =fterwards. 
When they used me to hurt you beyond realms. 
As you know, it was and is the worst nightmare for you, but also for me. =s you know the whole story did not come 
about because of me. 
However because of my statement they made it worse for you. I understand =11 this. 
You know me well, and we are steadfast to that. But, I must apologise =or not reaching out to you or answering your 
email. It is unlike me. Therefore, =ou can only deduce, that something else must have been going on, for me to =eact in 
this way. So in the eye of your storm, which I know is hellacious, =ay I ask you to accept my apology for not reaching out 
to you, in the eye of MY =torm, and accept and understand that I was in fear beyond all totality and I =ould not move 
left or right because of it, and was close to bed ridden with =he fear of what was happening. I was paralysed. I was 
advised in no uncertain =erms to having nothing to do with you, and not to speak or email you, and if I =id, I would cause 
more problems to both You and The Duke and myself. So I shut =own and ran away. I was broken and lost. So please 
understand, as I do about =ou, that I ws broken and not the strong person you know, and I got =ompletely obliterated 
too, and I saw all my childrens work etc disappearing.. I =hut down and everyone out. I was frightened. The Palace 
system is frightening, =nd each step I turned or each action was wrong and I did not want to hurt Andrew =ne more 
time. 
So Jeffrey, this email is sent with a hope you accept, and understand a =ittle of my side too.
