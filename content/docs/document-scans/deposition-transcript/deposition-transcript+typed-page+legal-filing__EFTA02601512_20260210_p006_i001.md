the plan did in fact result in substantial savings of both estate and income =axes) but it was not drafted with the 
expectation that Carol would survive=you. 
The question of who would be the survivor is irrele=ant. Carol and I assumed that she would be the survivor, 
but there w=s no reason to tell anyone, and it has no bearing at all on the fact that our intention was that the principal 
would be available to t=e survivor, then going to the children 
The decision to fund Carol's trust with both financial=assets and your Cape and Lexington homes was made 
when Carol was already i=l and (as far as the notes indicate) with the expectation that she would predecease you. 
This is quite surprising, and I would like som= clarification. Most important, I don't see how any significant 
=ecisions could have been made during those years, who could have made them= or why it was done. Obviously Carol 
could not have done so. She had to undergo massive brain radiation as soon=as the biopsy was taken, and serious 
cognitive and physical decline was imrediate. Nor could I have been involved. I very much wanted to =eep her at home, 
rather than the only alternative -- a nursing home. I managed to do so for two years, until the end, =ut it required 24-
hour care, and I was in no position to think about such =atters. If I had been informed -- I don't recall anything of 
the=sort -- I couldn't have paid any attention or granted truly informed consent. So I would like to learn more about 
=hese decisions. 
Secondly, I don't understand them. H=w could the Cape and Lexington homes fund the Trust? Did the funds 
f=om selling the Lexington house go to the Trust? How was it funded be=ore. Would appreciate clarification on this. 
Of course we knew by then that she would prede=ease me. It was a medical miracle that she was able to 
survive that =ong, on experimental drugs, as a last resort. 
The records that I have seen do not indicate what your expectations (or Carol's) were as to =ow the Marital 
Trusts were to be made available to you after Carol was gon= — for that the independent trustee of the trusts (whether 
me or m= successor) has to rely on the terms of the trusts themselves, the information that's given by the trust 
beneficiarie=, and the law surrounding such trusts. 
I'd be interested, of course, in knowing abou= the records you have seen, but it would hardly be surprising if 
there is =o explicit record of what is obvious simply to common sense. We were a married couple who cared for each 
other and for our children, pu=ting a Trust in Carol's name for tax purposes. What sort of luna=y would it to set up a 
Trust for one of us to have access to but not the o=her? So of course you are unlikely to find notes about it. If Harry 
forces this to litigation, all of this will=have to come up, either in court or in public in some other manner.=/b> 
When I appointed Harry to replace me as trust=e, I took for granted that he would handle the trust as I had. His 
b=havior since, and this latest proposal, make it very clear how wrong that assumption was. This proposal calls for him 
to be in =omplete charge, which means, as he has shown, that I can only plead for so=e funds by accepting conditions 
that he knows I will not accept. You=recall, I presume, that this was true even when I faced an enormous tax bill 
because my IRA was being depleted for th= benefit of the family. 
To refresh your memory, let me repeat again w=at was happening with my IRA until I learned about it. There is 
a ma=datory withdrawal. Half was being distributed to family. The other half was being used for taxes and 
management fees for the entire=estate. In order to pay Alex's medical expenses, and to pay $50,=00 a year for rent and 
upkeep on the house in Wellfleet that we had given =o the children and that I was barely using, I had to withdraw extra 
funds from the IRA, with the onerous tax burden.=C2 The same when I withdrew something to live on. Under these 
cir=umstances, Harry refused to release funds from the Trust for tax relief wi=hout onerous and humiliating conditions 
that he knew I would not accept. Easy to predict what might happen under =ess extreme conditions. It was not until 
2017 that I was able to ove=come the accumulated burden of these actions.
