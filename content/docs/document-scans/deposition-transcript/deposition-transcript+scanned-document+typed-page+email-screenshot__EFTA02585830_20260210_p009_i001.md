At that =oment, Famm says, he and Slaoui realized they were "biting off =oo much." Slaoui and Famm concluded that 
starting with the brain =E2 which seemed logical, given that it's the body's C.P.U. — =ould take decades to yield viable 
treatments. The human brain's circuitry, with 100 billion =eurons, seemed far too complex. "Why don't we just skip the 
brain and go =traight to the organs?" Slaoui suggested. 
Right then, =laoui said, "we decided to focus on the peripheral nervous =ystem." The peripheral nerves link the brain 
and spinal cord (the central =ervous system) to the organs and limbs. Rather than try to fathom the brain — a =lack box, 
basically, with its 100 trillion neural connections — Slaoui =roposed that they put "an interface between a nerve and the 
organ with an electrical =evice." To eavesdrop on a telephone call, his thinking went, you don't tap =nto the switching 
center and search for the conversation. You go to the line nearest the =aller's location. Compared with the brain, the 
cablelike bundles that are the =eripheral nerves contain vastly fewer fibers — hundreds versus billions. 
When I joined Famm in Philadelphia in February, he referred to his role as Glaxo's bioelectronics chief as "like being a 
=issionary." Famm, who lives in London, was in the U.S. to attend half a dozen meetings with =ioelectronics researchers. 
His challenge is coaxing those from disparate disciplines =o embrace a singular vision. Whereas drug discovery primarily 
involves like-minded =hinkers — molecular biologists, chemists, geneticists — =ioelectronics calls for alliances between 
experts in fields that in many cases have little to do with =edicine — nanotech, optics, electrical engineering, materials 
science, computer programming, wireless networking and data mining. At the moment, Famm is focused on getting 
what he called a "transdisciplinary" =roup of scientists to agree on how to solve two key technical challenges. 
The first is =hrinking the hardware. It must be small enough to attach to virtually any nerve yet still have enough battery 
power and circuitry to run =lgorithms that generate the patterns of electrical impulses needed to treat various =iseases.

the Charles =tark Draper Laboratory in Cambridge, Mass., we met with a team working on miniaturization. Draper is best 
known for internal navigation =ystems that guide things like ballistic missiles and spaceships. Bryan =cLaughlin, who 
directs bioelectronics development at Draper, showed me the latest =rototype mock-up — a dime-size implant. It's 
small, he said, but =ot nearly small enough. McLaughlin wants to get its electrodes, microprocessor, battery and a 
=ireless transmitter into a device no larger than a jelly bean. "W= also important to make it closed-loop, with the ability 
to read and write to the nervous system. =90 The goal, in other words, is to end up with something that can 
continuously =onitor a patient and then dispense bioelectronic therapy as needed. 
The second =hallenge is devising a method to make sense of signals emanating simultaneously from hundreds of 
thousands of neurons. Accurate recording =nd analysis are essential to bioelectronics in order for researchers to
