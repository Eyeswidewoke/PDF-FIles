Check writing 
If you enroll in the check writing feature for your Account, you authorize us and our Check 
Provider to honor checks that bear your signature(s) and unsigned drafts that are presented on 
the basis of separate written authorization from you to the payee. These checks may be used 
only in conjunction with your Accounts and only up to the Account's "Withdrawal Limit" as 
defined in the General Terms and Conditions in the Agreements and Disclosures booklet. We 
will deduct funds from your Accounts and reimburse the Check Provider in federal funds when 
checks or drafts are presented to the Check Provider. We may delay or deny payment if there 
are insufficient available assets in your Account to cover payment on the day you write the 
check or authorize the draft through the day on which we deduct funds from your Accounts 
to pay the check or draft. 
Bill Payment and Electronic Funds Transfer Services 
If you enroll in the Bill Payment and Electronic Funds Transfer services, you authorize UBS and 
its processing bank to effect the types of transactions described in the Bill Payment and 
Electronic Funds Transfer Service Agreement. This service agreement also applies to other 
electronic transfers to or from your Accounts, including transfers made with the UBS 
CashConnect feature and certain payments made through the Automated Clearing House 
('ACH') system, even if you do not enroll in this service. 
UBS Visa Debit Card for RMA or BSA 
If you choose to enroll for the UBS Visa Debit Card (Card) whether either verbally or in writing,

UBS policies, you will be issued one or more Card(s) by the Card Issuer. UBS and the Card 
Issuer will approve transactions you initiate using the Card(s) up to your Account's 
"Withdrawal Limit" or such other amount as described in the Agreements and Disclosures 
booklet. 
You agree to maintain sufficient available assets in your account to make payment in full, and 
transactions may be denied if there are insufficient assets in your Account to make full 
payment for any Card transactions as they are processed. As your Card cash withdrawals are 
processed, we will deduct funds from your Account to reimburse the Card Issuer. Once each 
business day, we will deduct from your Account the amount of purchases made with the Card 
that have been received by the Card Issuer but not yet deducted from your Account. The Card 
Issuer may suspend or cancel Cards if there are insufficient assets to cover transactions. Your 
use of the Card constitutes your agreement to the terms and conditions in the UBS Visa Debit 
Card Cardholder Agreement, which is included in the Agreements and Disclosures booklet.

separately from your eligible brokerage account. You may pay your Credit Card balance 
automatically each month from your eligible brokerage account, or you may pay the bill from 
other sources or allow a balance to revolve. The Credit Card terms and conditions describe 
rates, fees and other costs for the Credit Card. The Card Issuer will issue and manage your 
Credit Card according to Utah law and the UBS Credit Card Cardholder agreement (Credit 
Card Agreement). The Card Issuer will include the Credit Card Agreement with your Credit
