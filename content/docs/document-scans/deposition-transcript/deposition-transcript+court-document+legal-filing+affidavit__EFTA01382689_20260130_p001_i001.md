Ndwork & Security Solutions 
Our Network & Security Solutions segment provides a range of network solutions and security, risk and fraud management solutions to 
business and financial institution clients in our OBS and GFS segments, and independently to financial institutions, businesses, governments, 
processors, and other clients. This segment also includes our Data and Analytics Solutions, Online and Mobile Banking Solutions, Healthcare 
Solutions and Government Solutions. and serves clients in the United States and outside the United States. Our largest service in this segment is our 
STAR Network, which enables clients to encrypt, route, and decrypt various types of financial data, process debit and ATM transactions, and 
provide access to demand deposit accounts. In 2014, our STAR Network routed 3.6 billion transactions in the United States, up 3% over 2013. 
Network Solutions 
We provide a range of network solutions to business and financial institutions clients. Our EFT Network Solutions manage debit card 
and account processing solutions and facilitate EFT commerce, such as PIN debit. PIN-less debit, and ATM transactions. Our Stored Value 
Network Solutions facilitate stored value commerce, such as (1) closed-loop prepaid transactions, which are initiated by various types of prepaid 
cards issued by enterprises, such as retailers, that issue enterprise-branded cards that can generally be used only at the enterprise issuing the card or 
account, and (2) open-loop prepaid transactions, which arc initiated by various types of prepaid cards issued by a bank and carry a network 
association brand, such as Visa or MasterCard. enabling them to be used at multiple merchant locations. 
Our EFT Network Solutions citable our business and financial institution clients to route secure, encrypted data betwixt themselves on 
our STAR Network to facilitate PIN and PIN-less debit and ATM transactions. Our STAR Network is connected to over 3,800 financial institutions 
and community banks. over I million POS and ATM locations, and numerous third-party payment processors, ATM processors. and card 
processors that participate in the network. When a business, a merchant acquirer, or an ATM owner acquires a STAR Network transaction, it sends 
the transaction data to the network switch, which is operated by us. which in turn routes the encrypted information to the appropriate financial 
institution for authorization. To be routed through the STAR Network, a transaction must be initiated with a card participating in the STAR Network 
at an ATM or POS device also participating in the STAR Network. 
Revenues related to the STAR Network are derived from fees payable under contracts and negotiated rate structures. but arc driven more 
by the data transactions processed than by accounts on file. In a situation in which a debit transaction uses our network and we are the debit card 
pnnasor for the financial institution as well
