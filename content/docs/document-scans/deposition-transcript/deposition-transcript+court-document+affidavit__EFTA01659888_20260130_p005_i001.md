In mid August 2007, your defense team, dissatisfied with my staff's review of the case, asked 
to meet with me. Mr. Lefkowtiz indicated your busy schedule, and asked me to put off until 
September 7, 2007, so that you could attend. Mr. Lefkowitz also indicated that he might appeal my 
decision to Washington D.C., if my decision was contrary to his client's interest. I agreed to the 
September r meeting, despite the fact that our AUSA had an indictment ready for presentation to 
the grand jury. An explicit condition of that agreement, however, was an understanding between Mr. 
Lefkowitz and myself that any appeal to Washington would be undertaken expeditiously. 
On September 7, 2007, I, along with FAUSA 
AUSAs and 
and 
FBI agents, met with you, Mr. Lefkowitz, and Ms. Sanchez. I understood that you wished to present 
federalism-based concerns regarding our prosecution. To ensure a full consideration of your 
arguments, I invited Drew Oosterbaan, Chief of the Criminal Division's Child Exploitation and 
Obscenity Section, to travel from Washington to attend our meeting. During the September 7th
meeting, your co-counsel, Mr. Lefkowitz, offered a plea resolution. The inclusion of a Section 2255 
remedy was s 
ifically raised and discussed at the September 7th meeting. Indeed, according to 
AUSA 
notes, you thanked her for bringing it to your attention. Again, no objection to 
the Section 2255 issue was raised. 
After considering the ar uments raised at the September r meeting, and after conferring 
with the FBI and with 
our Office decided to proceed with the indictment. At that 
time, I reminded Mr. Lefkowitz that he had previously indicated his desire to appeal such a decision 
to the Attorney General, the Deputy Attorney General, or the Assistant Attorney General for the 
Criminal Division, and I offered to direct our prosecutors to delay the presentation of the indictment 
to allow you or he to appeal our decision if you so chose. He decided not to do so. 
Instead, Mr. Epstein elected to negotiate the Non-Prosecution Agreement. These negotiations 
were detailed and time-consuming. Mr. Epstein's defense team, including yourself, Professor 
Dershowitz, former United States Attorney Guy Lewis, Ms. Lilly Ann Sanchez and Messrs. Roy 
Black, Jack Goldberger, Gerry Lefcourt and Jay Lefkowitz had the opportunity to review and raise 
objections to the terms of the Agreement. Again, no one raised objections to the Section 2255 
language. 
Since the signing of the Agreement, the defense team and our Office have addressed several 
issues that have arisen under the Agreement. Although the exchanges were at times a bit litigious, 
it appears that these issues have been resolved by mutual consent, some in favor of your client, some 
not so. 
It is against these many previous foregone opportunities to object that I receive with surprise 
your letter requesting an 11th hour, after-the-fact review of our Agreement. Although it happens 
rarely, I do not mind this Office's decision being appealed to Washington, and have previously 
directed our prosecutors to delay filings in this case to provide defense counsel with the option of 
appealing our decisions. Indeed, although I am confident in our prosecutors' evidence and legal 
analysis, I nonetheless directed them to consult with the subject matter experts in the Criminal
