Republicans in Congress have been wary of new spending programs, arguing that more money is not necessarily the 
answer, and they h=ve rebuffed President Obama's calls to fund preschool for low-income f=milies. A number of 
Republican and Democratic governors have initiated state programs=in the past several years. The report comes as 
Congress begins debate about rewriting the country's main federa= education law, which was first passed as a part of 
President Lyndon B. Johnson*=99s "War on Poverty" and was designed to give federal help to states to help ed=cate 
poor children. The most recent version of the law, known as No Child Left Behind= has emphasized accountability and 
outcomes, measuring whether schools met benchmarks and sanctioning them when they fell short. 
That federal focus o= results, as opposed to need, is wrong-headed, Rebell said. "We have to think about ho= to give 
these kids a meaningful education," he said. "We hav= to give them quality teachers, small class sizes, up-to-date 
equipment. But=in addition, if we're serious, we have to do things that overcome the =amages- of poverty. We have to 
meet their health needs, their mental health needs, after-school programs, summer programs, parent engagement, 
early-childhood services. These are the so-called wraparound services. Some people think of them as add-ons. They're 
not. They're imperative."=C2* "We've all known this was the trend, that we would get to a majority, but it's here 
sooner rather than Iater,Q=80Q said Michael A. Rebell, the executive director of the Campaign for Educational Equity 
at Columbia University, noting that the poverty rate has been increa=ing even as the economy has improved. "A lot of 
people at the =op are doing much better, but the people at the bottom are not doing better at all. Those are=the people 
who have the most children and send their children to public schooL=E24,40 
Darren Walker, president of the Ford Foundation, =as born in a charity hospital in 1959 to a single mother. Federal 
programs helped =hrink the obstacles he faced, first by providing him with Head Start, the early-childhood educa=ion 
program, and later, Pell grants to help pay tuition at the University of Te=as, he said. "Even at 8 or 9 years old, I knew 
that America wanted me to succeed," he said. "=hat we know is that the mobility escalator has simply stopped for some 
Americans..C24, I was able to ride that mobility escalator in part because there were so many people, and parts of our 
society, cheering =e on." "I don't think today that low-income children and their families feel that America is cheering 
them o=. We need to fix the escalator. We fix it by recommitting ourselves to the id=a of public education. We have the 
capacity. The question is, do we have the will?" The country needs to make that same commitme=t today to help poor 
children, he said. Remember that the future of the country will be in the hands of our children and if they don't receive 
sufficient education and trainin= we can kiss the country's future goodbye.... 
My 6 Top Geopolitical Predictions=for 2015 
=ha> 
</=pan> 
If 2014 proved anything, it's that guessing at the state of the world a yea= down the line is a vain or even slightly 
embarrassing endeavor. Indeed, who co=Id have expected a year ago that Russia would take over Crimea, ISIS would 
break out of AI Qaeda and declare a caliphate, the US would start bombing Syria and Iraq while approaching a nuclear 
deal with Iran, or that Ebola would ravaged three wes= African countries and scare the world? Nevertheless and being a 
physical commodities trader deeply involved in and abreast of world affairs I though= I'd share with you my friend Ziad 
Abdelnour's, (Wall Street Financier=& CEO of Blackhawk Partners) -- 6 top geopolitical prediction= for 2015.
