2006 Reading of Hamlet 
Faculty: Critchley. Simon 
F 
03:50 PM - 06:30 PM 
Credits: 4 
CRN 6676 Sec A 
The objective of this seminar is deceptively simple: to read Shakespeare's Hamlet. Yet how are we 
to approach Shakespeare's longest, densest and most philosophically self-conscious drama? In 
addition to reading the play together slowly, collectively, and line by line. we will look at the play in 
the company of a number of readers, notably Carl Schmitt. Walter Benjamin. Hegel, Schelling, 
Nietzsche, Freud. Lacan. and Heiner Mueller. A number of problematics will be encountered: the 
political stakes of Hamlet, the nature of male and female sexuality in the play, the problem of 
nihilism, the theological background of Hamlet and the way in which it characterizes our so-called 
'modernity, tragedy and the production of shame. It is hoped that our reading will add up to a kind 
of Hamlet doctnne that might tell us something about why this play continues to fascinate us and 
shape what we think of as our present.

301.9 Evolution and Ethics 
Faculty: Adams, Zed 
TR 
10:00 AM 11:40 AM 
Credits: 4 
CRN 6822 Sec A 
Since the publication of Darwin's Origin of Species and Descent of Man. many have thought that 
evolutionary theory has significant implications for ethics. Sin the 19th century. many of Darwin's 
staunchest admirers, as well as many of his fiercest critics, agreed that evolutionary theory, if true, 
has significant implications for our beliefs about right and wrong and what the good life is like. SA 
fair number of the British clergy. for instance, argued that because of these implications. 
evolutionary theory itself must be false.1The thought that evolutionary theory has ethical 
Implications is still widespread today, as anyone familiar with contemporary debates about the 
teaching of evolution in public schools is sure to recognize. In this course, we will approach the 
question of the relationship between evolutionary theory and ethics historically. awe will begin with 
Darwin's own views, before proceeding to those of the most famous 19th century evolutionary 
ethicist. Herbert Spencer. Mee will then look at a variety of criticisms of Darwin's and Spencer's 
views, both those of followers of Darwin as well as those of critics of evolutionary theory more 
generally. SWe will repeat this cycle of advocacy and criticism twice more: first with regard to 
sociobiology in the 1970's and second with regard to evolutionary psychology in the 1990's and 
today.

relation between ethical virtues, nature and habits: contemplative and practical wisdom: and 
nature and political law. Moreover, we will locus on the role of the city in determining the 
possibility of the full realization of human capacities. This course will move largely through class 
discussion.

3109 Existentialism & Feminism 
Faculty: Bernstein, Jay

Credits: 4 
CRN 6859 Sec A 
Existentialism is the view that human beings have no unchanging metaphysical essence, that we 
are, in a sense. self. making or self-fashioning that the human is always an interpretation of the 
human. How far can such a thesis go? Could it conceivably reach as far as sexual difference? In 
this course we shall examine Jean-Paul Sartre's Being and Nothingness. Simone de Beauvoir's The 
Second Sex, and Judith Butler's Gender Trouble and related texts in order to comprehend the 
central elements of existentialist philosophy, and its bearing on feminist thought. This course is 
for advanced undergraduates only who have taken at least two previous philosophy courses.
