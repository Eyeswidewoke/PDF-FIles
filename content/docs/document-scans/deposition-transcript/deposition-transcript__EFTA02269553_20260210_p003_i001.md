concept of reality is utterly unresilient and a quitter. Do you think your 
sister, if she could go back in time 18 years, would change anything? 
» I would not change anything I have done so far. I have the perfect case study. 
I look at him every time I look in the mirror. And by the way, up is a 
significantly better athlete then I ever was, and much smarter. He will also be 
taller and heavier. I too top it off, he has parents and an nanny who have 
invest far more in him than my parents ever did.

the Tiger mom book Your son will thank you someday.

» -I want to discuss last night. I really think it.i.ould have been handled 
differently. I don't know what you discussed with II after I went to bed. I 
would like to know. I think ty deserved to talk with his friends for 20 min(when 
they are all `on line' also 8:30-8:50pm) then study and read in bed to fall 
asleep.. Giving ty a little bit of space is not a bad thing. He will be a 
happier person for it. We demanded of him a lot yesterday and he got no reward 
(reward in his eyes would be 20 min to chat with his friends). He deserves it. 
We need perameters. If he got to chat he would then have to study. 
» Throwing a 31200 phone out the door does not show Illgood judgment, behavior 
or a great way of handling a situation. I realize you were trying to make a 
point but had it broken or froze-then what? Ty almost threw the big flash light 
into our foyer and would have thrown it hard too. I'm glad he had the sense not 
to do it. (But after watching you it would be hard to blame him) Another thing-
we are always on top of ty to get himself organized with friends and that is what 
he wanted to do. Make dates to do stuff after school this week. This being said 
he also needs to allot time for homework and studying. Managing being a good 
parent is hard and I think you do a great job most the time. But last night was 
not good. What was the end result last night? I gave ty his phone this morning 
as we left the house. He seemed in good spirits. And he liked the chocolate Chex 
cereal. We had that already (I did not buy it yesterday) I think he must have not 
seen it last week. It is low in sugar
