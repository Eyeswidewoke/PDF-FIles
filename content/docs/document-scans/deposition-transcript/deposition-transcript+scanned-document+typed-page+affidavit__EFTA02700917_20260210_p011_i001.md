even the right to inspect Vatican records. Archbishop Marcinkus, the head of the IOR, was 
known to have a close relationship with Calvi, and was listed as a director of the Banco 
Ambrosiano overseas subsidiary in the Bahamas, from appeared responsible for nearly $900 
million in missing funds. 
According to the reconstruction by Bank of Italy, eight anonymous companies belonging to the 
Vatican bank owed the overseas subsidiaries of the Banco Ambrosiano the missing funds. Calvi 
had unsuccessfully attempted to the Vatican to refinance the massive debt but he first needed to 
obtain a document showing that the Vatican owned these companies. Archbishop Marcinkus had 
resisted providing any document that could be used to prove Vatican ownership of the 
anonymous companies since their indebtedness far exceeded the liquid resources of the Holy See. 
So Calvi cited records in the vault of the Banco Ambrosiano's banking subsidiary in Switzerland 
that he claimed would establish the Vatican's ownership of these subsidiaries in the event he was 
unable to refinance the debt. To verify this claim, the chief accountant of the Vatican bank, 
Pelligrino de Stroebel, was dispatched to Switzerland to view the secret records. Since they 
appeared to substantiate Calvi's claim, the Vatican bank furnished a document signed by 
Archbishop Marcinkus' deputy that acknowledged that the Vatican bank "directly or indirectly" 
controls the following entities", and gave a list of the eight anonymous companies, and then 
added "We also confirm our awareness of their indebtedness to subsidiaries of the Banco 
Ambrosiano". Marcinkus then initialed the document. As part of the deal to get this document, 
Calvi provided the Vatican bank a letter releasing them from any liability arising from these 
anonymous companies that had borrowed the missing $900 million dollars. The key documents 
pertaining to this arrangement had vanished, along with Calvi. And Calvi was now dead. 
As it turned out, Calvi could speak from the grave. In the summer of 1982, a special 
committee of inquiry in Parliament eerily heard Calvi's posthumous recollections on tape. Flavio 
Carboni, the Sardinian who had help organized Calvi's escape from Italy, had kept a microphone 
concealed behind his lapel during his final conversations with Calvi. These tapes had been 
seized when Carboni was arrested in Switzerland. On them, Calvi rambled on for no less than 
ten hours. At one point, Calvi recounted a conversation he had with Archbishop Marcinkus, 
claiming to have warned him "Be careful... If it comes out that you gave money to Solidarity, 
there won't be one stone of the Vatican left standing ." (He was referring to the Polish labor 
union movement which helped undermine the Soviet Union's control of Poland.) 
Archbishop Marcinkus meanwhile stone-walled Italian regulators, stating that Calvi was the 
sole author of the machinations. Italian authorities then issued subpoenas, but they were returned 
unopened on the basis that the Vatican was not subjects to the laws of Italy. Finally, on August 
6th 1982, the Minister of Finance, Beniamino Andreatta, ordered the Banco Ambrosiano 
liquidated and all its assets turned over to a new consortium of banks. 
The Vatican's 
controlling bloc of stock in the bank was worthless. The missing $1.2 billion was never 
recovered. 
"You can't run the church on Hail Marys alone", Archbishop Marcinkus told me when I asked 
him in 1983 about the transfer of the money. He said he knew none of the details of the 
transactions. According to him, the Pope had entrusted two lay bankers with this task: Sindona, 
who was the Pope had met with personally, and Calvi. "They, and they alone,know" he added. 
Calvi was dead, but Sindona was in prison in the United States. 
I went to see Sindona in Otisville Federal Prison in upstate New York in April 1984. Born in 
Patti. Sicily in 1920, and educated by Jesuit priests, by the time he was forty-three, he had
