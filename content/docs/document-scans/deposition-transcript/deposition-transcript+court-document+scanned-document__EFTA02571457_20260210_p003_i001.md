5/ Construction- Friday's meeting with =kyland seemed to put us on track -issue now is how hard will they 
push to =omplete in next 2 weeks - we need gary on board -I hear he is waiting for =is payment before he will resume -
but we can complete if everyone gets agg=essive and bring trades back to site

complete hotels item= -especially items needed for tco 
GARY IS FULLY AWARE OF FUNDING AND IS ON BOARD<=r> 
6/ Speakeasy as skyland pointed out at 
yesterda='s meeting and we both understood -there is little they need to co=tractually complete in the speakeasy as 
most items are now change orders g=ing forward 
Items to complete will be reviewed on Monday wi=h Tara - skyland and gary 
- your office has still not answered where the =anquette fabric is - for starters AS YOU SAW YESTERDAY,
