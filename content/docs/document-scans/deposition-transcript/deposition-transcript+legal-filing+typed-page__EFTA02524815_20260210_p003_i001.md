During the last 5 years of our fight with the government, because of Landmark=92s high quality 
environmental record, Landmark was invited by the European=20 Union to develop the last great sand dune on the west 
coast of Ireland. We developed, on a fee basis, the Doonbeg Golf=20 Club, which when it was opened, was rated by Golf 
Digest as the =est new course in the world. Because of the time spent in=20 Ireland, we were approached to do a 
development in the south of Spain, =here we did Arcos Gardens, chosen by some as the best new course built that =ear 
in the world and chosen by most to be the best new course in Spain in m=ny years. We also developed, on a fee and 
carried ownershi= interest basis, Lake Presidential in Maryland, 14 miles due east of the=U.S. capital, and moved our 
corporate headquarters to Maryland. 
Although it was agreed that Landmark had contributed $131 million net value to t=e bank in 
1982, and that the government, without cause, violated their contract, Landmark received only $21 million from the 
Court of Claims. By the time it paid its lawyers, court costs, a=d its debt of honor to directors, etc., it had approximately 
$4 million n=t remaining. In 2004 we purchased South Padre Island, our=20 joint venture with the Lloyd Bentsen family 
in South Texas, from the fu=d run by Lewie Ranieri, and on a friendly basis, separated our relationsh=p with Lewie. In 
2006 we invested $4 million to purchase=20 one-third of Apes Hill Club, Barbados. 
South Padre Island proved a success in that we sold approximately 150 houses in 2005, 200 in 
2006, 170 in 2007, and in each=of these years had cash flow of $3 million to $5 million net to the parent. We have 
developed approximately half of the 2,0=0 acres, have 1,000 homes built, and approximately 1,200 left to be built. After 
Lloyd Bentsen's death, we bought from hi= estate, at a very attractive price, his interest, and it is now owned 1=0% by 
Landmark. 
South Padre Island Development is on the right side of history in that it off=rs good value, in 
warm weather. on the water for middle-class pre-retireme=t, retirement buyers, however, with the housing crisis we 
only sold 21 hou=es in 2008 and are doing only slightly better than that in 2009. =20 Therefore, the cash flow is not 
coming from South Padre to Landm=rk, but cash is going from Landmark to South Padre. Recentl= there was some sign 
of optimism, but in the short run, this may be a fa=se spring. In the long run, I am confident that offering=20 homes in a 
good golf course community from $135,000 up will be in the h=art of the baby boomers retirement plan. 
Apes Hill Club is 470 acres that overlooks both the west coast of the Caribbean a=d the east cost 
of the Atlantic. It has been the most successful and highest quality development I have ever been associated=20 with. 
While at the present time, with the pound low against the dollar and the financial crisis in England and Ireland at i=s 
zenith, our sales are slow, last year Apes Hill Club made $33 million n=t profit. However, because the cash flow was 
needed for=20 continued development in Apes Hill, none of the money was brought back =o Landmark. 
Obviously, if we have a completely integrated management staff and presently no income from 
our two major developments, we have a cash flo= problem. A year ago I believed that recession was on us= things 
would be bad, and Landmark would be (if I could keep the team together) in an ideal position to take advantage of the 
greatest financ=al crisis in my lifetime. Therefore, I made the decision n=t to cut management back to what was
