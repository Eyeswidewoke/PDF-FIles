I should make it clear to start with that none of this bears on our decisio= to move to Tucson. That has quite 
different motives. 
We do of course have to face our financial situation: reliance on a diminis=ing IRA (and another very small one) 
with no access to other funds, and the burden of paying for an apartment that I agreed to buy only on the mistaken 
assumption that the cost would be paid by the Lexington house. 
What we're discussing is something else: the nature of the loan from th= Trust. 
The final version of the Promissory Note that was provided to me reads as follows: 
"Interest on the balance out=tanding shall be payable at a rate equal to the highest rate in effect from time to 
time on any one or more loans outstanding <=font> 
between-Lender and (insert full name of Pershing entity], or if no such loans are in existence, then the rate shall 
be fixed at the so-called Mid Term Applicable Federal Rate in effect at the time, recalculated monthly in accordance with 
Section 1274(d) of the Internal Revenue Code, or an= successor thereto. Interest due on each Loan shall be calculated 
based on a 360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed."<=ont size="3"> 
There is nothing here, or elsewhe=e in the document, that restricts it to the brief period before the sale of the 
Lexington house. 
I have no information at all abou= having received any DNI. If there is such information, it should be sent to me 
so that I can use it for our own plans. 
I don't see much point in a m=eting. It seems to me that all of this can be cleared up in writing.

Hi, thanks for your reply.

We are very, very concerned that you are not understanding and not getting help in understanding what is

expla=n what the Promissory Note language means. 
Just to give you one example of our concern: You focus on one phrase: that the interest will be "at the highest 
rate in effect." =ut you are taking those words out of context. We really don't think we =hould be trying to explain 
these details to you, but to try to summarize: t=is phrase applied to the double nature of the loan—the Marital Trust 
h=d to borrow money from Pershing to make the loan to you, until the Lexington house was sold. The phrase you quote 
applies only to that brief perio=, and has no impact on the interest accruing now or in the future. 
We can see why focusing on those six words would make you angry. But the six words mean nothing in and of 
themselves (i.e., what rate is "in=effect"?). But instead of doing the logical thing—getting the full 
information=E24“flou are just so angry that you refuse to find out the truth.

Again, this is just one example of where you are stating conclusions based on faulty or incomplete information. 
There are explanations for your other issues as well (how the DNI is paid to you, how the interest payments can be 
made, etc) but rather than us trying to summarize the information for you here, we think it would make more sense for 
you to discuss them with the people who set all of this up, in the context of a broader conversation= Reading your
