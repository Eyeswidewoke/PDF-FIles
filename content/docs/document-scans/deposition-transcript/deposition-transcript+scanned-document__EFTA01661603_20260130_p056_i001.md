In Ghana, Clinton will launch a new initiative with Peruvian economist Hernando de Soto to give deeds and land 
titles to poor people who now have no legal status and are considered squatters. 
In South Africa, Clinton will deliver a speech and join Mandela in promoting prevention of AIDS. Clinton will also 
meet in that country with the first class of Clinton Democracy Fellows - 11 young South African men and women 
who just completed three months in the U.S. 
Clinton will also meet with the presidents of the other nations on his itinerary. 
Perfect angel 
THE producer of Tara Reid's latest flick says she's a perfect angel and that Us Weekly misquoted him as saying 
that he and the bar- friendly hellcat "went out drinking all the time." J. Todd Harris, producer of "Heaven's Pond," 
blasts Us in a letter to the editor: "I specifically said that our working relationship with the actress was nothing 
short of spectacular." He also shoots down the mag's source who claims Reid needed to have a baby sitter 
escort her out every night tomake sure she didn't wake up with any regrets. 
We hear .. . 
THAT eyebrows are flexing over tonight's U.N. black-tie dinner honoring Muhammad Ali, Mayor Bloomberg and 
Paul and Heather Mills McCartney. Seems Heather insists on being referred to as "Lady Heather Mills 
McCartney" ... THAT Steve Martin, Paul Morrissey, Glenda Bailey and Elizabeth Kieselstein-Cord attended last 
nights 15th anniversary party of Modem Painters magazine at the Cheim and Read Gallery. 
Headlines heal 
SARAH Ferguson, the former Duchess of York, credits the media for keeping her weight down. Once dubbed 
the "Duchess of Pork" by the British press, the now stunning and skinny Weight Watchers rep says every time 
she thinks of pigging out, she remembers the old headlines. Among those she cited during an appearance at an 
Albany Weight Watchers seminar, according to The Post's Kenneth Lovett: "Fat, Selfish, Greedy Fergie" and "82 
Percent Would Rather Sleep With a Goat." "It does help me when I read articles that (say] the 'slim svelte 
Fergie,' " Ferguson said. "I don't want them to have a go at me again. I'm tired of that." 
Lost actor pops up in L.A. 
JASON Mewes is alive and well. Mewes, who played the long- haired, drug-loving "Jay" in Kevin Smith's 
"Clerks," "Mall Rats," "Chasing Amy" and "Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back," was reportedly on the lam or even 
feared dead after his friends told the Chicago Sun-Times they hadn't seen him in 10 months. An arrest warrant 
had been issued for him after he violated probation on a heroin conviction. But last month, Mewes made an 
appearance at a film festival in Malibu to promote his new indie movie "RSVP," and he'll host a talent show Oct. 
17 at Marshall University in Huntington, W.Va. "The rumors of his death are greatly exaggerated," chuckled 
Mewes' agent, Nancy Oeswein. "I just got off the phone with him. He's certainly not in hiding. He just moved to 
L.A." For some folks, living on the Left Coast is as good as being dead. 
Sex sells 
ABERCROMBIE & Fitch has outdone itself. The store chain's new "magalog," a catalog disguised as a 
magazine, is even more salacious than past efforts, with a naked Heidi Klum on the cover - one hand hiding her 
nipples, the other holding a Santa hat over a naked man's crotch. The tag line reads: "180 pages of sex and 
Xmas fun! Heidi Klum adds inches, Spike Lee catches it on tape, Larry Flynt breaks tapes, Heidi Fleiss gets 
what she wants, streetcorner Santa brawls and more!" One spy said: "There is a ton of bums and breasts inside. 
Everyone is naked." The quarterly, targeted at teens and college students, will be featured on "Entertainment 
Tonight' later this week.
