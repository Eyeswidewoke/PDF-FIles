WILLIAM MASUCCI 
Responsibilities and Introductory Information: 
I have been the CEO/CFO for a large single family office based in Upstate NY for approximately 15 years. 
My sole reason for considering a change is that the Patriarch is nearing 89 and is requiring me to 
relocate to Florida with no succession plan in place should he pass. I inherited, on the financial side an 
asset base with no allocation or other cohesive plan to manage the money effectively. It was basically 
office managers deciding what they wanted to purchase that day without regard to how one decision 
affects another. The Patriarch then gave me the full responsibility of managing the assets for the family. 
In addition to starting with a large asset base, I oversaw the proceeds from their liquidity event and have 
had full discretion over the portfolio with responsibility ranging from asset allocation, to manager 
selection, to performance reporting and everything in between. The Patriarch has no involvement in the 
process at any level and chooses not to. I am responsible for all due diligence and all decisions managing 
the entire portfolio and have P.O.A. over the assets. The allocation ranges from long equities, to 
alternatives, to a broad fixed income mandate. Some of the portfolio I manage myself, while some of it I 
act as the quarterback to outside managers. I have also put in place safeguards to double check the 
activity. I also have P.O.A. over the family's banking relationships and manage all cash flow, bill paying, 
and customary banking needs as expected for a high net worth family. While most family offices for the 
ultra- rich have multiple people doing multiple things, they choose to have me perform all duties in all 
areas for them with just some administrative help. To put in candidly, I basically do everything for the 
family from financial to non- financial management. 
In addition to the financial management, I oversee the buying and selling of commercial and residential 
real estate, the purchase and sale of yachts, planes and automobiles. I handle and coordinate with both 
accountants and attorneys on both tax and legal matters for the family. I perform the due diligence and 
annual reviews for all the family's insurance needs. I have been through NY State Audits successfully and 
was responsible to ensuring the family met the threshold. I am the conduit between generation one and 
all other generations within the family tree. I have also managed the family's golf course business, 
logging projects on vacant wooded land, and multiple other projects on an ad hoc basis. I also have the 
responsibility of hiring the domestic staff, hiring administrative personnel for their home office and 
managing all those functions. Virtually every decision that has to be made at any level comes through 
me. 
I have been asked and have spoken at several family office seminars over the years on multiple topics 
from finding safe investment havens to asset allocation to managing a single family office. I have also 
been involved with the Family Office Exchange and their initial investment committee and am often 
asked to give my view on various issues. I can provide class A references should we get to that point. 
The duties described only touch on the scope of thing I do on a daily basis. I am basically performing the 
function of 3 people myself as the family doesn't trust and doesn't understand the magnitude of 
managing their wealth. While it has been a great learning experience, the factors outlined above are 
leading me to consider other opportunities. I am willing to relocate.
