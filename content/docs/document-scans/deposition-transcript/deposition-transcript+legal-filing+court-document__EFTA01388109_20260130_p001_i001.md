Subject: Assistance Required in solving rejection points on KYC Case# 
Importance: High 
Hello Stewart, 
Hope you are well!! 
I have received the following list of rejection points on KYC Casell....5 relating to customer — Prytanee, LLC. 
I need your assistance in resolving below highlighted points. 
For Point 2 —As per attached constitutional doc, they (AML) are requesting to update address mentioned on Pg 11 
(Royal Palms Professional Building address). I had updated address as per Pg 28 which is the IRS letter. Please confirm 
whether to keep this address or amend it as per Pg 11? 
For Point 6 — Could you provide the email that the AML team is seeking? I only have the attached email (2nd pdf 
attachment) from the repositories. 
For Points 8 & 9 — Kindly provide SOW info for Jeffrey & Caroline. 
For Point 10 — This will be covered on Pts 8 & 9 
For Point 11 — My existing comments on the DB deposit account is "the purpose of this account is to managing the 
monthly expenses of the company" as per previous KYC. Kindly advise, please? 
For Point 13 — I am unable to procure SoS for this entity from the US Virgin Islands company registry website -
Department of Licensing and Consumer Affairs. Kindly provide this please? 
For Point 17 — Please provide the requested email. 
Rejection:1) Please add the account number for the deposit account. 
2) The address on the LLC Agreement does not match the address in the LLC Agreement. Please provide proof of 
address. 
3) Please expand on the nature of business. What do they do with the investment in art work? Re-sell it? 
4) Richard Kahn has been tagged as a signatory. However, as per the DB Resolution uploaded under KYC — 1704382, he is 
not listed as a signatory. If Darren is indeed not a signatory, please remove him from this KYC. 
5) The Pierre Trust was created under the laws of USVI. Please re-run research with that country as well. 
6) Can you please locate the full e-mail chain that proves that Chip Packards approval actually refers to Epstein's jail 
sentence? The current e-mail attachment uploaded does not refer to what is actually being discussed. 
7) Please attach the ROC Alert for Richard Kahn. 
8) Please provide SOW verification for Jeffrey Epstein. 
9) Please complete SOW narrative for Caroline and provide SOW verification as well. 
10) The SOW narrative for Jeffrey Epstein seems a bit outdated. It still refers to the Financial Trust Company as the SOW 
Company. However, based on the consent of board of directors meeting from 2013, Financial Trust Company merged 
into Southern Financial LLC with Southern Financial LLC as the surviving entity. Please updated the SOW narrative and 
provide research etc for the new entity. 
11) Please explain in detail what this account is being used for. What are the monthly expenses of the company? 
12) Please complete the 90 and one year values. The one year value is listed as $1MM, however, the account currently 
has just less than $200K. 
13) Please provide COGS for Prytanee, LLC.
