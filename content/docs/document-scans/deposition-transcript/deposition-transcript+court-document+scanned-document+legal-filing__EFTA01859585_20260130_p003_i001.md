Mr. Epstein, thank you for the opportunity to go to Little Saint James and review this 
spectacular project. Having had the opportunity to have opened an number of larger resort 
throughout the Caribbean and Hawaii I must say the attention to detail at your project 
matches up to them well. However as with all projects there are always numerous 
practices that need to be reviewed in order for them to blossom and grow efficiently. On 
this trip I had the opportunity to spend some quality time with Gary, Karen and Brice, 
which gave much incite to our initial Phone call two weeks ago. First before I go into the 
detailed areas I do not think there is any theft or in play, it seems as though these three 
people truly have your interests and comfort as their primary concern. 
The first area I would like to discuss is landscaping because it was the most obvious area 
of financial burden, the gentleman i brought in to review the area is also responsible for the 
landscaping at the Westin Sain Johns and the W in Vieques. So he has vast experience in 
growing on an Island; 
• More effective water usage must be put in place, this can be achieved with the 
combination of the placement of adequate plant palette and the installation of 
effective irrigation systems such as emitter, drip, or micro subsurface irrigation. As 
opposed to spray heads, the aforementioned minimize the lose of water through 
transpiration and evaporation which will lead to more effective water usage. Which is 
critical at a site such as this. 
• There must be a landscaping design and plan put in place. As beautiful as it is on a 
tropical Island it is critical to plan what you want to grow, plant selection is critical 
in order to minimize irrigation, maintenance and replacement costs in maintaining a 
healthy garden. Placement of plants is important so the stronger plants work as 
windbreakers to protect weaker flowering plants. 
• New landscaping work can be done more efficiently by bringing in a contractor for 
that specific project to avoid the hiring of full time employees. As you are finding 
out full time employees in the Caribbean arc a heavy finical burden, plus I have found 
the longer they are employed their production has a tendency to decline. 
• The existing nursery should be replaced by a program of purchasing and delivery 
of plant material for normal wear and tear of landscape area. This would be a more 
cost efficient solution, it would minimize water consumption and the manpower 
needed for the nursery's upkeep. Also a relationship should be established directly 
with nurserys in Florida and Puerto Rico not with "third parties". 
• Presently with 15 employees we feel landscaping is over staffed.
