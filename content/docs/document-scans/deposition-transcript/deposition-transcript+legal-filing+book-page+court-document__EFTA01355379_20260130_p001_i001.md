including (i) to the extent such amendment does not subject any Limited 
Partner to any material adverse economic consequences or diminish or 
waive in any material respect the duties and obligations of the General 
Partner to the Access Fund or the Limited Partners, (ii) to cure any 
ambiguity or correct or supplement any provision in the Partnership 
Agreement which may be inconsistent with any other provision therein 
or to correct any clerical errors or omissions in order that the Partnership 
Agreement shall accurately reflect the agreement among the Partners, 
(iii) is necessary in order to comply with any fiscal, statutory or official 
requirement (whether or not having the force of law) and (iv) to address 
changes in financial, regulatory or tax legislation, which amendment 
may include reorganizing or reconstituting the Access Fund, but only to 
the extent such amendment does not materially adversely affect the 
economic returns of the Limited Partners. The General Partner and the 
Investment Manager intends to cause the Access Fund to vote its interest 
in the Underlying Fund as a single interest. 
The General Partner and the Investment Manager will not consult the 
Limited Partners when voting the interests of the Access Fund and will 
endeavor to vote in a way that benefits the Access Fund as a whole. As 
such, a Limited Partner's individual interest may differ from that of the 
Access Fund and therefore the vote may not be consistent with how the 
Limited Partner would have voted if provided with the opportunity. The 
Limited Partners of the Access Fund will not have the right to vote 
on any matters requiring the vote of the Access Fund in its capacity 
as an investor in the Underlying Fund. 
Borrowing 
The Access Fund may enter into a credit facility (a -Credit Facility") 
with a third party, which Credit Facility may be secured by drawdowns 
of Subscriptions, for purposes of temporarily funding all, or any portion 
of, any anticipated capital calls by the Underlying Fund in respect of the 
Limited Partners' Subscriptions or expenses or liabilities of the Access 
Fund in advance of receipt of such amounts from the Limited Partners 
and to cover the Access Fund's over-commitment to the Underlying 
Fund or defaults by Limited Partners. 
See "Capital Calls" and 
"Purpose: Underlying Fund" 
Such borrowings may require the Investment Manager, on behalf of the 
General Partner, to pledge all or a portion of the property of the Access 
Fund and/or the Subscriptions to the Access Fund to secure such a loan. 
In such event, the Access Fund may also be required to delegate the 
rights to issue drawdown notices and to receive capital contributions to 
a third party. Limited Partners may be required to provide banks or other 
financial 
institutions 
with financial 
information 
and 
other 
documentation reasonably required to obtain borrowings. 
Repayment of the principal and the interest (and any related fees and 
expenses) amount of any such borrowings will be made from the Limited 
Partners' Subscriptions.
