Finance Charges: Average Daily. Balance Method for Calculation of Finance Charges (FC):We use the Average 
Daily Balance method to calculate FC on your Account. Under this method, we figure the PC on ycur Account by applying 
the daily periodic rate to the Average Daily Balance (as described below) for each feature (such as Purchase, Cash 
Advance and Balance Transfer features)7 of your Account (including current transactions). To get the Average Daily 
Balance for each feature, we (1) take the beginning balance for the feature each day (incUdLng unpaid FC from previous 
billing periods), (2) add any new transactions, debits, or fees, (3) suited any payments Cr credits, and (4) make any 
appropriate adantinents. For each day after the first multipliedof
 billing period, we also add en amount of 
interest equal to the previous day's daily balance
 by the daily periodic rate for the feature. 
This gives us the daily balance for the feature for that day and the beginning balance for the feature for the next day. If this 
balance is negative, it is considered to be zero. Then, we add up all the daily balances for the feature for the biting period 
andavid° the total by the number of days in the bang period. This gives us the Average Daily Balance for the feature. For 
all features except Cash Advances and certain promotions, the Average Daily Balance wall be considered to be zero if you 
paid the New Balance, if any, shown on your previous month's statement by the Payment Due Date shown on that 
statement. If you multiply the Average Daly Balance for each feature by the number of days in the billing period and the 
daily periodic rate for that feature, the result will be the FC assessed on that feature, except for variations caused by 
rounding. The total FC for the billing period is calculated by adding the FC assessed on all features of the Account. This 
method- of calculating the Average Daily Balance and FC results fn daily compounding of FC. The minimum 
FC for any billing perlod in which FC are imposed is $0.50.
