EXECUTIVE BRIEFINGS 
ECONOMY AND POLITICS: Euro Crisis 
Adit Jain, IMA India 
November 2011 
When Angels Fall 
Over the past few weeks, a number of our clients have written to me seeking our perspective on the 
possible impact upon India, of a worsening crisis in the Euro zone. It is difficult to pinpoint what this 
will be, as the variables are several. Frankly, the Euro zone has been in a crisis for several months and 
the most obvious impact was the flight of capital from India and other emerging markets. Clearly, if 
Greece failed and Italy and Spain too defaulted, the markets will go into a panic and it is hard to 
determine the turn of events that may follow. 
As things stand, I do not believe there is any 'Euro deal'. This is not only because Greece still needs to 
get its political act in order and come up with a credible proposal on austerity measures; it is also 
because the original deal proposed by the Euro zone authorities was based on inappropriate 
assumptions. First, the hair cut of 50% announced by the authorities is voluntary, which means 
banks don't have to take it. Making it mandatory would have triggered billions of credit default swap 
(CDS) derivatives. Second, Euro zone members would need to contribute Euro 30 bn to Greek debt. 
Strangely, these countries are not willing to write down their existing debt in order to convince their 
citizens that they would not have to fund it. Third, raising the Euro Stabilisation Fund to Euro 1.4 tn 
involves another Euro I tn to be produced. This may involve the issue of ESFS bonds. The point is, 
who would buy such bonds and who would guarantee them? What would the value of such guarantees 
be? Eventually I believe Euro zone authorities will have no choice but to amend their existing charter 
and allow the European Central Bank to monetise some of the outstanding debt. 
The initial euphoria that followed when bank stocks recovered, I suspect, was misplaced. Ultimately 
whatever happens, the only way out of this financial mess is economic growth. But as I have argued 
previously in several papers (including the one on Global Rebalancing), this growth is unlikely to 
happen. Europe is not prepared politically or socially to pay for it i.e. to accept lower salaries, longer 
working hours, higher retirement ages and so on. 
In terms of the way forward, the best case scenario is one where an amicable solution is agreed upon 
for Greece's debt. Banks that have exposure are prepared to take a hair cut and Greece is able to 
implement the austerity measures that lenders have demanded. Additionally, the European Central 
Bank is able to raise the Euro 1 tn that it believes it would need to prevent the crisis from spreading. 
This scenario clearly assumes that the crisis is contained and Italy and Spain and other countries are 
spared. In such a case, the impact on external markets in general, and India specifically, would be 
limited. Greece is a small economy and the exposure of the banking system is moderate. However, 
under the current set of circumstances I do not think this is a likely scenario. 
The worst case scenario is one where the crisis is not contained. If the rescue package announced by 
the Euro zone - Euro 1 m in any case is too little - cannot be raised, then the crisis will slowly spread -
first to Italy and then to Spain. The cost of sovereign debt in these countries and in others will become 
so high that their economies will simply be unable to sustain them. So when the time comes to repay or 
roll over and the countries fail to do either, sovereign defaults will begin to happen. Under such a 
scenario, the financial markets globally would panic and banks would go into a complete shell. They
