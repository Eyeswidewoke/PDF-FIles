interviewers themselves become upset when observing victims give voice to their negative 
emotional experiences. If police interviewers were more aware of the cathartic value of victims 
voicing their emotional experiences, perhaps police would be more receptive to allowing victims 
to incorporate their emotional reactions within their narrative of the crime details. 
If victims do become highly emotional during the interview, they should be empowered to stop 
the interview process when they wish, but it is generally recommended that the interview not be 
terminated unilaterally by the interviewer (Cote & Simpson, 2000). This is because interrupting 
or stopping the interview may be experienced by the victim as patronizing and denying an 
opportunity to testify. Instead, possible empathetic responses and supportive comments are 
recommended. These include: "From what you are saying, I can see how you would be..." or "It 
sounds really hard..." or "I'd imagine you'd be feeling really 
right now." Our experience, 
mainly as related by police investigators who interview rape victims, is that if victims are 
permitted to stop narrating their experiences when they feel extremely emotional, they frequently 
become silent for a while, and then, after gaining their composure, continue to narrate their story, 
oftentimes providing many details. 
Limited Mental Resources. People have only limited mental resources to process information 
(Baddeley, 1986; Kahneman, 1973), and especially if they are in a highly aroused state. For 
instance, witnesses may have limited ability to understand interviewers' questions and 
instructions, while the witnesses are concurrently searching through memory. Interviewers can 
minimize overloading witnesses by refraining from asking questions while witnesses are 
searching through memory and in general by asking fewer, but more open-ended, questions. 
Witnesses also should be allowed to close their eyes before responding, as that is known to 
enhance concentration, presumably by reducing visual interference (Perfect, Wagstaff, Moore, 
Andrews, Cleveland, Newcombe, Brisbane, & Brown, 2008). Requesting witnesses, and 
especially victims, to close their eyes during the interview should be done only after having 
developed adequate rapport, and after witnesses feel comfortable with the interviewer. 
Witness-compatible Questioning. Each victim's mental record of an event is unique. Some 
victims may have focused on the perpetrator's face, whereas others may have focused on the 
weapon. Interviewers should tailor their questions to each particular victim's mental record 
instead of asking all victims the same set of questions and in the same order. Interviewers often 
violate this rule by using a standardized checklist to guide their questioning of all victims (Fisher 
et al., 1987) or by constructing a fixed set of questions to ask before the interview has begun and 
then using those pre-interview questions blindly, even if they are inappropriate for the particular 
victim. 
During the course of an interview, event details will vary in accessibility. Memory for the 
weapon, for instance, should be more accessible when the victim is thinking about when she/he 
first saw the weapon than when she/he is focusing on the assailant's face. In general, event 
details will be most accessible when they are perceptually related to the victim's current mental 
image (Pecher, Zeelenberg, & Barsalou, 2003). Interviewers therefore should be sensitive to the 
victim's currently active mental image, so as to time their questions efficiently. This may require 
interviewers to defer asking questions about specific details until later in the interview, when the
