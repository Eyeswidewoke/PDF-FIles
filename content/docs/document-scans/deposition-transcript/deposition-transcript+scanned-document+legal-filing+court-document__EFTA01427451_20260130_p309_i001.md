Blue Buffalo Pet Products, Inc. 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 
($10 million sub-limit for letters of credit and a swing line sub-limit of 
$5 million). The Facility is secured by 100% of Blue's assets and is 
guaranteed by its parent BPP. The term loan facility expires on August 8, 
2019 and the revolving credit facility expires on August 8, 2017. 
As of December 31, 2012, the term loan is presented net of the related 
unamortized original issue discount ("OID"), which was $7.0 million at 
issuance. Accretion of OID is included in interest expense and was 
approximately $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. In 
connection with the Facility, the Company recorded approximately $5.7 
million of deferred debt issuance costs. Both the OID and deferred debt 
issuance costs are being amortized over the weighted-average term of the 
Facility (approximately 7 years) using the effective interest method. The 
proceeds from the term loan were used to fund a special dividend of $350 
million to shareholders. 
On December 6, 2012, the Company and its lenders amended the Facility to, 
among other things, provide additional term loan borrowings of $50 
million and allow for the distribution of dividends of $50 million. The 
proceeds from the additional term loan borrowings were used to fund a 
special dividend of $50 million to shareholders. In connection with this 
amendment, the Company recorded $1.2 million of additional deferred debt 
issuance costs to be amortized over the remaining term of the term loan 
facility (approximately 6.7 years) using the effective interest method. 
On February 15, 2013, the Company and its lenders entered into two 
amendments to re-price both the term loan and revolving credit facility (the 
"Amended Facility"). The term loan amendment reduced the applicable margin 
on the $399 million principal amount of term loan borrowings by 
150 basis points and the interest rate floor by 25 basis points. The 
revolving credit facility amendment reduced the applicable margin on revolver 
borrowings by 150 basis points (there were no borrowings under this 
facility). In connection with the amendments, the Company incurred and 
recorded approximately $4.7 million of additional deferred debt issuance 
costs, which are being amortized over the remaining life of the Amended 
Facility. In addition, the Company recorded $0.5 million related to bank and 
legal fees paid to third parties to execute the amendments, which is 
included in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2013. 
On December 9, 2013, the Company and its lenders entered into an amendment 
to re-price the term loan. The term loan amendment reduced the 
applicable margin on the $396 million principal amount of term loan 
borrowings by 75 basis points. The revolving credit facility remained 
unchanged. In accordance with accounting guidance on debt modifications and 
extinguishments, the amended term loan was deemed substantially 
different and as such the modification has been treated as an 
extinguishment. In connection with the extinguishment, the Company recorded 
a loss 
on extinguishment of debt of $15.9 million, which consisted of unamortized 
debt issuance costs of $9.2 million, unamortized OID of $5.7 million, 
and new debt issuance costs of $1.0 million.
