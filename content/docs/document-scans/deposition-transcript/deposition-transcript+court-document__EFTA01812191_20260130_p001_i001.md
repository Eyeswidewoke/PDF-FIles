Subject Re: Tired 
I am willing to discuss all your concerns, IF you re-read your email you will see that you play no 
role in this mess. I have been TRYING TO HAVE DISCUSSIONS for the past week in pb. 
Ihave asked that you ask your questions and then stop nagging,s. Not that I asked for you to 
leave AFTER asking over and over that you stop spending your full time with me questioning 
me, ONLY QUESITONING ,only questions re girls. who is on the phone, who is on skype, who 
gave you that, what is on the blackboard, I have asked to discuss the future, money, 
expectations. and plans. only to receive today from you a -what do you expect?. 
I am aware of 
your fears re ghisliane , russians„ nasty looks. other peoples views. that is your focus, what other 
people think of you. though you choose to ignore what they see with their own eyes , and once 
again blame me for their opinions. I tell you everything. with the hope that you will modify your 
actions. yesterday with Freja, a perfect example. who is at the house. what is she doing „ what is 
she really doing, i want to come in and see d „ ok, I want you to kiss me in front of her. ok, I 
wnat you . and then when i concede to suchpettiness , you walk out , you don't speak to her. I 
didn;t have to say anything to lesley rich 
llynn,freja, they see. igor and story,making fun of 
you d talking about how you don't want to rive a car driven by jenn. I tell you in order that you 
have information to modifiy your behvaior. You merely attempt to justify it, by saying it is a 
shitty car. .. They see . When you and I were beginning , yes I was in love with you when 
ghislianc was around. You now , suggest i am behaing the same way. WITH WHO ?

Dear Jeffrey, 
I don't know what you expect is going to happen to us. I do not want to come back in July and 
get nasty looks from the girls who think you would rather choose to spend time with them 
over me because you have been having 'affairs' with them while I am gone. 
You have been dishonest about other women and as a result I can't trust you. You refined to 
help rebuild the trust by full disclosure and have no other suggestions. 
If we can agree the girls you spend time with over next 2 months, while I am gone, permanently 
dissapear from our lives after July, I don't need to ask any more questions. But otherwise, let's 
not drag this on. I do not want to be treated like Ghislane - yes, she had a great life except you 
were cheating on her with me, everyone saw it, felt sorry for her, acted differently when she 
showed up, made fun of her and treated her like a retard for not seeing it. 
I feel resentful about you forcing me to leave and I can't deal with the russian baggage that 
comes with it. 
I love you, I appreciate being able to play with the plane today and I hope you win every battle 
you are fighting. 
Good night
