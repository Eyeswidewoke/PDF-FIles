the United States becoming the first country to report more than 100,000 daily cases," 
although "a surge in Europe contributed to the rise." Reuters adds, "The latest seven-day 
average shows global daily infections are rising by more than 540,000." 
Scientists Concerned As Denmark Culls Mink Population Over Coronavirus Spread. 
The New York Times (11/8, Gorman, 18.61M) says the Danish government's decision to "kill 
millions of mink because of coronavirus concerns, effectively wiping out a major national 
industry, has put the spotlight on simmering worries among scientists and conservationists 
about the vulnerability of animals to the pandemic virus, and what infections among animals 
could mean for humans." According to the Times, "The most disturbing possibility is that the 
virus could mutate in animals and become more transmissible or more dangerous to humans." 
The Times adds the World Health Organization and foreign scientists "said they have yet to see 
evidence that this variant will have any effect on vaccines. They have not, however, criticized 
Denmark's decision to cull its mink population." 
World Leaders Congratulate Biden While Others Remain Silent. 
World leaders continued to offer messages of congratulations to President-elect Biden on 
Sunday. Axios (11/8, Rummler, 521K) reports, "King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin 
Salman congratulated...Biden on his projected victory in the 2020 election on Sunday, 
according to the Saudi Press Agency." Reuters (11/8, Rashad) says the congratulations from 
Saudi Arabia came "more than 24 hours after he defeated Donald Trump, who had close 
personal ties" with the Crown Prince. 
The Wall Street Journal (11/8, Pancevski, Vieira, Simmons, Subscription Publication, 
7.57M) says while world leaders congratulated Biden, others, such as the leaders of China, 
Russia and Iran, have been silent. The New York Times (11/8, Hulse, 18.61M) reports four 
years ago, "the Kremlin rushed out a message for President Trump within hours of the 
American television networks calling the race on election night." The Times adds that there are 
indications that Putin "is preparing for a deeply adversarial relationship with America's next 
president." Holly Williams of the CBS Weekend NewsVi (11/8, story 4, 2:05, Garrett, 1.44M) 
reported, "America's adversaries, including Russia and China, have portrayed the US election as 
chaotic, and American democracy as flawed." 
The AP (11/8, Stevenson, Alvares) says President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil and Mexican 
President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, "both of whom have been seen as friendly" to 
President Trump, were "notable holdouts." Bolsonaro has been silent and Lopez Obrador 
"refused to congratulate Biden at this point, saying he would wait until the legal challenges over 
the vote were resolved." 
Europe Relieved By Biden Victory, But Wary. The New York Times (11/8, Erlanger, 
18.61M) reports while there is "relief in Europe about having a well-disposed friend in the White 
House who is more likely to support than to berate, harangue and insult," there "will still be 
wariness among European leaders - about what Biden may ask of them, especially in the 
knowledge that he may be a one-term president and that the populist impulse that animated 
Trumpism has hardly gone away." The Times says "the world has changed, and so has the 
United States, where the Biden victory was relatively narrow and not an obvious repudiation of 
Mr. Trump's policies. A fundamental trust has been broken, and many European diplomats and 
experts believe that U.S. foreign policy is no longer bipartisan, so is no longer reliable." 
Netanyahu Congratulates "Great Friend Of Israel" Biden. Israeli Prime Minister 
Benjamin Netanyahu tweeted his congratulations to Biden and Vice President-elect Harris 
Sunday morning. Netanyahu wrote, "Congratulations @JoeBiden and @KamalaHarris. Joe, 
we've had a long & warm personal relationship for nearly 40 years, and I know you as a great 
friend of Israel. I look forward to working with both of you to further strengthen the special 
alliance between the U.S. and Israel."
