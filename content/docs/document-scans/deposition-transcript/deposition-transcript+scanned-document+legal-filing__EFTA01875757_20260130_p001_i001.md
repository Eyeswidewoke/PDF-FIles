RE: follow up 
See Article II on pgs 1-2 of the 2006 Trust Doc attached to my last email for 
language related to distribution of 'trust accounting income' from operating 
profits of 'relevant companies' which you will see detailed in II(A)3. The 
'relevant companies' are the Apollo entities Leon had ownership interests in that 
he contributed into the GRATs that poured into the 2006 Trust. There isn't 
specific language surrounding the principal. The trusts owns the interests in 
Black Family Partners and the monetization of the value of the BRH interests 
would not constitute 'trust accounting income' from 'operating profits' and would 
therefore remain in the trust. 
I will next forward a summary entitled 'History/Structure' that I wrote for 
myself early on as I was trying to come up to speed on what had been put in 
place. I believe I left you a hard copy which was behind the org chart of Black 
Family Partners. There is a section on the first page with comments on FLPs-I was 
in an education mode and, with hindsight, did not fully understand the control 
issues but I think otherwise this will help you understand where we came from. 
Importantly, you will see there were 2 sets of GRATs. The termination of GRATs A-
K went as planned. But the second set, GRATs L-O lacked sufficient cash to make 
the final annuity payment to Leon so we did an inkind transfer of the Black 
Family Partners these GRATs owned to Leon and then he contributed these into a 
new GRAT, the Judah 2009 Trust. We made that a 4 year GRAT instead of 2 years 
like the original ones we did because I felt we would not have generated enough 
cash in 2 years to make the annuity payments to Leon.

offer the following: 
> Regarding the issue of why turning off the income right now works is that it 
would be the independent trustees turning off the income right, not Leon, and 
that the 2006 Trust was drafted purposely in anticipation of this. I believe this 
relates to the language on page 30 in the attached. 
> Also, Ada (from US Trust) at one point had suggested to Carlyn that we consider 
having the trustees turn of the income right in the 2006 Trust and then decant 
the assets from the 2006 Trust into a new trust before proceeding with the Art 
Partnership to insure a cleaner transaction. 
> Also, on the subject of the 2006 Trust and other trust paying their own taxes-
important implication for Black Family Partners would be that we no longer have a 
single taxpayer.
