Patriotism. Habit. The human habit. 
There is no choice with information. It is a measure of effect, a measure of the change in the brainirms operations. As the 
brain functions in a universe of continuous, simultaneous operations, it may be said information is always circulating in the 
system. As information is a measure of control, there is always one hundred percent control. Thcrc is no choice. 
It is interesting to note that research into the activity of the brain shows that the program of operations in terms of direct 
experience becomes imprinted as an operant circuit. It must be remembered that the operation of the brain is activity of which 
one cannot be aware. These imprints exist in the simultaneous universe of operations. It has been demonstrated through 
electronic stimulation of the temporal lobe by implanted electrodes that the imprint of a previous program can become 
activated. Illusions of familiarity of a dAOjA vu nature, as well as interpretation of shape, clearness, and speed, are activated 
by stimulation of the temporal cortex and subsequent electrical discharge on only one side of the brain, the side responsible 
for minor handedness,' We also know that the flicker experience of a frequency of that of a movie (twenty four frames per 
second) could excite this same area of the brain through exaggerated electrical discharge.61 Considerations of individual 
ticeminda only beg questions that may be readily explored through analysis and observation on the operant level. Operant 
observations and analysis are impossible within the abstraction system of man. 
Discern the patterns by measuring output and relating it to input. How a change in the environment is related to a change in 
the brainaTMs operation. The relationship is nonlinear; the measure of the relationship is information, a measure of the change 
of the brainiims operations. It goes beyond the abstraction of the individual. In a way man could not sec, he was animated by 
his extensions. He was the terminal, not the originator. It all went through him. it wasnirmt life; it was process. 
It comes down to rhythms. Reality is to be found in the process of neural activity. Systems of abstraction are developed which 
allow the fimctioning phenomena to monitor their own activities. This monitoring, rather than being an observation of extant 
activity, is actually new activity. It is represented by frequencies, rhythms, numbers. When man tried to find the ultimate 
material basis of identity, he got down to the level of molecular spectra, only to find neither materials nor mechanisms, but a 
self-organizing pattern of frequencies. A process. A whole which can be represented by operant mathematical symbols, but 
which can be talked about and measured only in terms of eject. Who am I? 
There are not, there will not be, any footnotes in the body of this exercise. Ownership is a human habit The author presents 
not ideas, but information. Not words and images, but a transaction that can be measured only in terms of information. It may 
appear inconsistent to use the linear format of the printed book to convey the message that there is only information The 
entity ficebooka is an arbitrary representation of reality, not dissimilar to symbolizing operant patterning as ficemanit On the 
neural level we can see how ficebook,fi an extension of man, fed back signals telling the brain what to do. There is acca sense 
in which we can say that there is communication of information between man and his products.e3 This is process. It is 
integrated on the neural level. It is nonlinear. 
Language. This exercise is using language to say that language does not exist. There is only information controlling the direct 
experience of the brain. The currency of the nervous system is the neural impulse. The key to language is to be found in the 
operations of the brain. The universals of language arc the universals of neural patterns. Different languages cut up reality in 
terms of their own bias. Mathematics must be included in this consideration as a language. However, keit may even be in the 
cards that there is no such thing as atanguageirm (with a capital L) at all! The statement that rthinldng is a matter of 
IanguageaTM is an incorrect generalization of the more nearly correct idea that Ethinking is a matter of different tongues.aTM 
The different tongues are the real phenomena and may generalize down not to any such universal as laanguager but to 
something better called rsublinguisticirm or rsuperlinguisticamirand NOT ALTOGETHER unlike, even if much unlike, 
what we now call a'mental.âTMã
