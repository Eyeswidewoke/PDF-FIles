determine whether one who occupies land forfeited by the Government must pay the 
Government a reasonable rent for the period of his occupancy); Reed, 660 F.Supp. at 
181 (holding that Massachusetts law governs the rights of the parties under a Postal 
Service lease). 
*8 The Second Circuit in Kerin did not reach the issue of whether federal 
common law or state law applied because, in that case, federal law and state law led to 
the same result. See Kerin, 116 F.3d at 991. I agree with the Seventh Circuit's 
conclusion, for two reasons. 
First, although Epstein and Fisher argue that a federal rule should be created to 
promote the creation of a uniform body of law in landlord-tenant disputes involving the 
Government, there is no "distinct need" for a nationwide legal standard or a uniform 
national rule. See Kamen, 500 U.S. at 98. Landlord- tenant law traditionally has been 
a matter of state law. There is no compelling reason to disrupt expectations that 
tenants and landlords may have under state law merely because they are entering into 
a lease with the federal government. Courts have long held that, "[a]bsent controlling 
federal legislation or rule of law, questions involving real property rights are determined 
under state law, even when the United States is a party." United States v. O'Block, 788 
F.2d 1433, 1435 (10th Cir.1986) (citing Oregon ex rel. State Land Bd. v. Corvallis Sand 
& Gravel Co., 429 U.S. 363, 378-81, 97 S.Ct. 582, 50 L.Ed.2d 550 (1977)). [FN7] 
FN7. Indeed, the Supreme Court has articulated that the normal federal 
disposition where no substantive federal provision is relevant to the legal issue at hand 
is for "federal courts [to] 'incorporat[e] [state law ] as the federal rule of decision." • 
Kamen, 500 U.S. at 98 (emphasis added) (quoting United States v. Kimball Foods, 
Inc., 440 U.S. 715, 728, 99 S.Ct. 1448, 59 L.Ed.2d 711 (1979)). 
Second, application of state substantive law directly on point is eminently more 
logical than application of general principles of federal contract law. While application of 
general federal contract law to Government contracts may be appropriate in certain 
instances, where, as here, the particular government contract is a lease for the use of 
real property, the adoption of state common law of landlord-tenant relations, a body of 
law that has developed precisely to address the rights and duties of individuals in the 
unique relationship of landlord and tenant, makes sense. Application of the state rule, 
which permits a landlord to refuse consent to a sublet or assignment arbitrarily in the 
absence of a clause to the contrary, better serves the interests of the Government as a 
landlord because it permits the Government to have unfettered discretion in deciding 
who occupies its property. Given the sensitive political considerations that often come 
into play when governmental property, such as the property here in issue owned by 
Iran, is involved, the Government should have as much discretion as possible. 
Noting that federal landlord-tenant law does not exist, Judge Posner stated in 
Powers: The Federal Courts could of course create that law, picking and choosing 
among existing state laws and proposed reforms in accordance with the 
recommendations of eminent scholars and practitioners. It is not to be expected that 
the federal courts would do a very good job of devising a model code of landlord-tenant 
law, since they have very little experience in landlord-tenant matters; and though
