According to sources close to the situation,=the departure of CEO Steve Ballmer from Microsoft last week was more 
sudden than was depicted by the company in its announcement that he=would be retiring 
<http://=Ilthingsd.com/20130823/microsoft-ceo-ballmer-to-retire-within-12-monthsk within the next year in a 
planned smooth tran=ition. 
It was neither planned nor as smooth as port=ayed. 
While the decision to go seems to have technically been Ballmer's, i=terviews with dozens of people inside and outside 
the company, including many close to the situation, indicate that he had not aimed to l=ave this soon and especially 
after the recent restructuring of the company=that he had intensely planned. 
Instead, sources said Ballmer's timeline had been moved up drastical=y — first by him and then the nine-member board, 
including his longtime partner and Microsoft co-founder and chairman Bill Gates — afte= all agreed that it was best if he 
left sooner than later. 
That was due to a number of increasingly problematic issues on the imm=diate horizon — including a potentially nasty 
proxy fight, continued business performance declines and, perhaps most of all, that Bal=mer's leadership was becoming 
a very obvious lightning rod. 
Interestingly, Ballmer actually indicated that he had planned on stayi=g in his letter about his imp=nding departure 
<http://allthingsd.com/201.301323/steve-ballmers-memo-to-employees-=nnouncing-his-retirement-from-microsoftk 
noting: "My original thoughts on timing woul= have had my retirement happen in the middle of our transformation to a 
de=ices and services company focused on empowering customers in the activities they value most." 
That sentence spurred much chatter inside the company, including the p=rsistent rumor that Gates had dropped the 
bomb on Ballmer. That sentiment was further underscored when Ballmer's letter contained n= reference or thanks to 
Gates, with whom he has been tightly tethered over=the last several decades. Its absence has been much discussed 
internally a= Microsoft, where it has been seen as an unusual slight and a sign of a rift. 
Gates also did not reference his longtime business partner in any cele=ratory manner in Microsoft's announcement. "As 
a member of the succession planning committee, I'll work closely with the other memb=rs of the board to identify a 
great new CEO," said Gates, in the entiret= of the quote about Ballmer's retirement. "We're fortunate to have S=eve in 
his role until the new CEO assumes these duties." 
Other sources cautioned that it was not indicative of tensions between=the pair, but was done to minimize "lame duck 
concerns" that might arise if Ballmer was portrayed as already out the door. 
Those sources also insist that Gates never asked Ballmer to step down =ooner, although they acknowledge that he also 
did not — as Gates had in the past — disagree that it was best that he move on. 
"Did Gates instigate it? No," said one source with knowledge of th= situation. "But was he as supportive of Ballmer as he 
had been in the past? Maybe not." 
That was still a big change, of course. Gates — who has always been =nd remains the key decision-maker on Microsoft's 
board — had always been Ballmer's major backer, despite increasing pressure both ext=rnally and from other directors 
for him to step down. 
Gates had rejected such suggestions for years. That included former di=ector and Netflix CEO Reed Hastings, who many 
sources said had been one of the first to urge that the company replace Ballmer as CEO,=as well as from a spate of Wall 
Street investors complaining about the com=any's declining value in the Ballmer years.
