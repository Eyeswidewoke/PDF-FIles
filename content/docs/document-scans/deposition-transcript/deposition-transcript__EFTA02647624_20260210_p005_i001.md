Jeffrey, I had no idea what was reality before. You started by sending m= an 
incredible amount of money like 10k, sometimes 5k and then when I was =oing to school you were sending me 4K or 3k 
a month which I extremely appr=ciated but I wasn't prepared for it, I had really no idea at that time=what was the value 
of money ending up doing stupid things and not taking I=fe seriously. Even if I was told, everything seemed very abstract 
in my mi=d. Now that I collapsed I know. Now that I find myself in this situation, =hat I've started working and earning 
some, I understand how hard it is=and how much work there is behind and wish everyday I knew this before... = don't 
earn a house and the money I earn doesn't even cover the re=t even though I'm working. Jeffrey, I did understand the 
lesson. I beg=you, please forgive me. I need your help. I'm drowning, I'm not ab=e to support myself all alone.

True. I have no excuses. The only thing I can tell you is th=t I'm trying to do 
better by learning from my mistakes in order to not=repeat them. I've waisted my time by going to parties instead of 
being=serious. Everything was confused in my mind and I didn't really know w=at path to take, it's very easy to get lost 
when you are young, specia=ly into fake illusions. Still now, I'm trying to understand myself and=who I am. I believe it 
takes time and it's different from person to pe=son. Now little by little I've started to focus more. I'm starting=to 
understand real life, what are my priorities and things that really mat=er. Here are some actual facts: I've started to 
earn some money = which I've never did before ) which I believe it's already a smal= accomplishment. I did some 
babysitting and after 2 paid trial days ( 250 =uros per day ) shooting for Vogue and Dior, I've got hired by one of t=e best 
fashion photographers called Paolo Roversi to be his assistant ( pa=d job ). I'm very happy and excited to work and learn 
from him which i= better than any photography school. I'm ready to work as long as I ne=d to in order to build my skills 
and stand out in that field. I think I I-=;ve achieved some results and gained some value if I compare myself 2 year= ago 
from now. Thanks to you I had the possibility to make many interestin= experiences like Ferragamo in China and Alaia in 
Paris. Even though = didn't get hired from them, those experiences allowed me to understan= what I like and what I 
don't like and shaped in part the person I am.=Thanks to the Alaia internship and my passion for photography I am no= 
working with Paolo Roversi doing what I really like. However even though = work hard and I am paid I cannot fully 
support myself to pay a rent and m= living in Paris. I really would like to continue through this path, I fee= it's the right 
one but I need your help, your support and your advice= because I cannot make it by myself. 
I promise I will use =y money wisely without throwing it away into futilities like 
parties and h=lidays because I want to grow and build my skills, my carrier and hopefull= my future self.
