The question of who would be the s=rvivor is irrelevant. Carol and I assumed that she would be the 
surv=vor, but there was no reason to tell anyone, and it has no bearing at all =n the fact that our intention was that the 
principal would be available to=the survivor, then going to the children 
=as made when 
you. 
=div> 
The decision to fund Carol4o=804$ trust with both financial assets and your Cape and Lexington homes 
tas already ill and (as far as the notes indicate) with th= expectation that she would predecease 
=/div> 
=div> 
This is quite surprising, and I would like some clarification.=C240 Most important, I don't see how any 
significant decisions could =ave been made during those years, who could have made them, or why it was =one. 
Obviously
ould not have done so. She had to underg= massive brain radiation as soon as the biopsy was taken, 
and serious cogn=tive and physical decline was immediate. Nor could I have been invoked. I very much wanted to keep 
her at home, rather than the only alt=rnative -- a nursing home. I managed to do so for two years, until t=e end, but it 
required 24-hour care, and I was in no position to think abo=t such matters. If I had been informed -- I don't recall 
anythin= of the sort -- I couldn't have paid any attention or granted truly in=ormed consent. So I would like to learn 
more about these decisions.<=b> 
Secondly, I don't understand them. How could the Cape and=Lexington homes fund the Trust? Did the 
funds from selling the Lexin=ton house go to the Trust? How was it funded before. Would app=eciate clarification on 
this. 
Of course we knew by then that she =ould predecease me. It was a medical miracle that she was able to 
su=vive that long, on experimental drugs, as a last resort. 
=/div> 
The records =hat I have seen do not indicate what =our expectations (or Carol's) were as to how the 
Marital Trusts we=e to be made available to you after Carol was gone — for that the =ndependent trustee of the trusts 
(whether me or my successor) has to rely =n the terms of the trusts themselves, the information that's given by the trust 
beneficiarie=, and the law surrounding such trusts. 
<=iv> 
I'd be =nterested, of course, in knowing about the records you have seen, but it w=uld hardly be 
surprising if there is no explicit record of what is obvious=simply to common sense. We were a married couple who 
cared for each =ther and for our children, putting a Trust in Carol's name for tax pur=oses. What sort of lunacy would it 
to set up a Trust for one of us t= have access to but not the other? So of course you are unlikely to =ind notes about it. 
If Harry forces this to litigation, all of this =ill have to come up, either in court or in public in some other manner. 
=/div> 
When I appointed Harry to replace me as trust=e, I took for granted that he would handle the trust as I 
had. His b=havior since, and this latest proposal, make it very clear how wrong that assumption was. This proposal calls 
for him to be in =omplete charge, which means, as he has shown, that I can only plead for so=e funds by accepting 
conditions that he knows I will not accept. You=recall, I presume, that this was true even when I faced an enormous tax 
bill because my IRA was being depleted for th= benefit of the family.
