I am reminded of the graphic =f a Middle Class white American women juxtaposed next to an Arab woman in = burka, 
one holding a Bible and the other a Koran with both holding guns a=d the captioning asking, "What's The 
Difference..=804, As such, the inspiration of that reference today for me is Joh= Feffer's recent article in the 
Huffington Post t=tled — Is Putin Really as Foolish as We Are'?.=A0 Because you would think that after its own 
disastrous nine year wa= that resulted in almost 15, 000 Soviet deaths and more than 53,000 wounde=, then watching 
the United States and its allies make the same folly for e=ually ridiculous reasons, one would think that even Vladimir 
Putinife=99s might be reluctant to enter into another war not directly on Russia4,=804,s borders. 
But then Richard Nixon, another Cold=Warrior, as well as considered one of the most duplicitous president in U.=. 
history actually knew that the U.S. air war in Southeast Asia was a dism=l failure. Even as he was telling the media that 
the saturation bomb=ngs of Vietnam and Laos were "very effective," Nixon was =rivately acknowledging the opposite. 
"We have had 10 ye=rs of total control of the air in Laos and V.Nam," Nixon wro=e to his secretary of state, Henry 
Kissinger, on January 3, 1972. " 
The Obama administration has unlea=hed a similar air war in Syria and Iraq against the Islamic State. The res=lts have 
been comparable to Nixon's "zilch."40=A0 The Islamic State has not replaced its black flag with a white one= nor has it 
shrunk appreciably in size. Obama's attempt to unsea= Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad has not produced much either, 
other than in=reased violence and chaos in the poor, benighted country. The Pentag=n's effort to train and re-insert 
"moderate" rebels i=to the country has proven so disastrous that the Obama administration rece=tly suspended the 
project.

Meanwhile, the CIA Hs rival plan to simply ship armaments to existing forces fighting against=the government in 
Damascus hasn't yielded more than "</=ont>zilch," at least according to rece=t reports. Except that the success that 
anti-Assad forces have had w=th anti-tank missiles helped persuade Russian President Vladimir Putin to =ntervene on 
the side of the Syrian government to forestall checkmate and p=olong stalemate. Since Putin is Russian, chess has been 
the go-to me=aphor for portraying recent Kremlin strategy. No surprise, then, tha= Putin's move in Syria has been

Putin's Folly 
Since the end of last month, th= Russian government has sent fighter jets, tanks, drones and a couple hund=ed of
