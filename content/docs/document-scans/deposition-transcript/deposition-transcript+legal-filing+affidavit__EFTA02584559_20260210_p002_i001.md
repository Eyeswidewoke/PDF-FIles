For Harold Simmons's estate, that alternate valuation date =s tomorrow -- six months from his death. Today is the last 
trading day before that valuation. How's Valhi done in the last six months= 
Source: Bloomberg 
Oh.6 The stock closed yesterday at $6.01, reducing the value of the estate's ho=dings by $2.8 billion -- and its estate-tax 
liability by $1.1 billion -- s=nce Simmons's death. 
Is that good news or bad news for the estate? Well, the fir=t law of tax is that it is always better to have more money 
than less money.7 It's not actually a good idea to lose $2.8 billion of money to sa=e $1.1 billion in taxes. 
Though the estate didn't exactly lose $2.8 billion of money. That tax liability is a cash expense: You've actually got to 
=rite a check to the IRS for $1.9 billion (using the December valuation) or=$765 million (using yesterday's valuation=), so 
the $1.1 billion you save is an actual cash savings. The $2.8 billion I=ss, on the other hand, is a paper loss. Perhaps it's 
just temporary. If th=re were some reason to think that it didn't reflect only a decline in the =undamental value of Valhi, 
you might not worry as much about that paper loss as you would about the cash =axes. 
So what's happened to Valhi? Well, it's not having a great year<=span> 
<http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59255/000005925514000059/=xh991.htm> , with zero-ish net income last 
quarter. The board reduced the dividend 
<http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59255/000005925514000059/=xh992.htm> by 60 percent, to its lowest 
level since 2005. And the few people w=o follow the stock are unimpressed. Bloomberg shows two analysts 
following=Valhi, Barclays and EVA Dimensions. They both have sell ratings, and Barclays has a price target of $5.00, 
say=ng in May that "from a SOTP analysis, we continue to view VHI as trad=ng above its intrinsic value." A Seeking Alpha 
piece <http://seekingalpha.com/article/2259473-valhi-seems-like-a-tough=way-to-seek-value> from a few weeks ago is 
similarly gloomy, with a $6 per share fair v=Iue. 
All of this suggests that Simmons's estate owes less tax be=ause it's really worth less than it was six months ago. In fact, 
if you taxed Simmons's heirs now based on the value of Valhi six mon=hs ago, they'd have almost nothing left of their 
stock.<=p> 
But there's one more bit of the story. On June 11, about tw= weeks ago, the Harold Simmons Foundation -- the 
charitable foundation controlled by Simmons's heirs -- filed with the SEC 
<http://www.sec.gov/=rchives/edgar/data/59255/000005925514000079/form144hsfoundation.htm> a plan to sell all 
of its 2.5 million shares. That's not a lot of stock, exactly -- just 0.7 percent of the company, worth arou=d $16 million at 
the time of the filing -- but it is a lot relative to the=usual volume of trading in Valhi. Remember, 93.8 percent of Valhi is 
owned=by Simmons's heirs and never trades. Between December 27, 2013, and June 10, 2014, Valhi traded an average 
of 4=,311 shares a day, so the foundation's shares represented almost 59 days' =olume. 
It sold them <http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59255/000005925514000102/=orm144vhc.htm> in =1 days: 
Source: Foundation filings, Bloomberg 
The foundation's sales over the last two weeks or so accoun=ed for over half of the volume, on average, each day. And 
the foundation's average sale on each of those days was more than five tim=s the average volume over the previous six 
months. From Jan. 1 to June 10 =f this year, more than five months, Valhi traded a total of 4.6 million sh=res. From June 
11 to June 25, just over two weeks, it traded a total of 4.8 million shares -- more than half =f them sold by the Harold 
Simmons Foundation. 
You might expect that to drive down the stock a bit? Actual=y the stock performed surprisingly well, all things 
considered; it closed on <https://www.google.com/finance/historical?q=NYSE%3AVHI&ei=3D_YmtU-
