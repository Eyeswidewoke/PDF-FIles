among Features and Charges on your Account in any order and manner determined by us in our sole discretion. Finance 
Charges: Average Daily Balance (ADB) Method for Calculation of Finance Charges (FC): We use the ADS 
Method to calculate FC on your Account. Under tits method, we figure the FC on your Account by applying the Daily 
Periodic Rate (DPR) to the ADB (as described below) for each Feature (including current transactions). Different daily 
periodic rates may be applied to separate Feature balances. To get the ADB br each feature, we (1) take the beginning 
balance for each day (including unpaid FC from previous billing periods) (2) add any new transactions, debits, or fees, (3) 
subtract any payments or credits, and (4) make any appropriate adjustments. For each day alter The first day of the biking 
period, we also add an amount of interest equal to the previous days daffy balance multiplied by the DPR for the 
Feature. This gives us the daily balance for the Feature for that day and the beginning balance for that Feature for the next 
day. If this balance is negative, it is considered to be zero. Then, we add up all the daily balances for the Feature for the 
billing period and divide the total by the number of days in the billing period. This gives us the AD B f or the Feature. II you pay 
the New Balance on this statement by the next Dosing Date, then you will avoid additional FC on features included in this 
New Balance. If you multiply the ADB for each Feature by the number of days in the tilling period and the DPR for that 
Feature, the result will be the FC assessed on that Feature, except for variations caused by rounding. The total FC fcr the 
billing period is calculated by adding the FC assessed on all Features of the Account. This method of cakulating the ADB 
and FC results in daily compounding of FC. Transactions Made in Foreign Currencies: If you incur a Charge in ,a 
foreign currency, it Wit beccnverted into USdollars on the date it is processed by us or our agents. Unless a particular rate is 
required by applicable law, we will choose a conversion rate that Is acceptable to us for thafdate. Currently, the conversion 
rate we use for a Charge in a foreign currency is no greater than (a) the highest official conversion rale published by a 
government agency, or (b) the highest interbank conversion rate identified try us from customary banking sources, on the 
conversion date or the pnor business day, In each Instance Increased by 2%. This conversion rate may differ from rates 
in effect on the date of your charge. Charges converted by establishments (such as airlines) will be billed at the rates such 
establishments use. Billing Rights Summary:  In Case of Errors or Questions About Your Bill: if you think your bill is 
incorrect, or if you need more intormation about atransaction on your bill, write us on a separate sheet of paper at the 
Customer Service address noted to the right. We must hear from you no later than 60 days after we sent you the first bill on
