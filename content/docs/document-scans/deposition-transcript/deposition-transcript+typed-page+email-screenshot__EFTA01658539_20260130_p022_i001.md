outdoor picnic for 1.3 million...without knowing how much food he has, who's coming, how he's 
going to invite them and what they can and can't eat." 
Newsom: California Will "Independently Review" FDA-Approved COVID Vaccines 
Before Releasing. The Los Angeles Times (10/19, Luna, 4.64M) reports California Gov. Gavin 
Newsom (D) said Monday that the state "will review the safety of all COVID-19 vaccines that 
receive federal approval before distributing them to the public, adding an extra safeguard amid 
concerns that the White House could rush the process." Newsom, at a news conference, 
"announced the creation of a new work group of physicians and scientists working with the 
California Department of Public Health that will 'independently review' all federal Food and Drug 
Administration-approved vaccines, he said." The Times says Newsom is "insisting on a state 
review at a time when polls show declining confidence in future COVID-19 vaccines," and his 
announcement "also raised new uncertainty about COVID-19 vaccines just days after Dr. 
Anthony Fauci said he felt 'strong confidence' in the safety of those approved by the Food and 
Drug Administration." 
The San Francisco Chronicle (10/19, Koseff, Ho, 2.67M) reports Newsom "announced the 
creation of an 11-member scientific review committee to check the process for any vaccine 
approved" by the FDA; members "include San Francisco's health officer, Tomas Aragon, as well 
epidemiology experts from UC Berkeley, Stanford University and Kaiser Permanente." 
Cuomo May Lift Restrictions On Some COVID Red Zones. 
The Wall Street Journal (10/19, Yang, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) reports that in a 
conference call on Monday, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) said that on Wednesday he will 
announce changes to New York City's red zones, which he said could mean adjusting the rules 
around reopening so that they are contingent on local community response and infection rates. 
The New York Daily News (10/19, Sommerfeldt, 2.52M) reports Cuomo "said the changes 
will be unveiled...roughly two weeks after the color-coded shutdowns of schools and non-
essential businesses were first implemented in parts of southern Brooklyn, central Queens, 
Rockland County, Orange County and some areas of upstate." Cuomo "did not divulge the exact 
nature of the tweaks, but said they could be made on a 'block by block' basis within the zones. 
For example, Cuomo said a bar tied to a specific outbreak could remain shuttered while schools 
and other businesses return to normal." 
Catholic Leaders Voice Disapproval Of Cuomo's COVID Measures. The New York 
Times (10/19, McKinley, 18.61M) reports that in the last two weeks, "Catholic leaders in New 
York have voiced their deep disapproval" with Gov. Cuomo "over his decision to sharply limit 
attendance at houses of worship in areas that are seeing a surge of new coronavirus cases." 
The governor's decision "was largely aimed at trying to rein in congregants in Orthodox Jewish 
synagogues in New York City and in Orange and Rockland Counties, where some members have 
flouted social distancing and mask regulations." However, "it also affected other houses of 
worship, including about two dozen parishes in the diocese covering Queens and Brooklyn, 
where Catholic officials have sued Mr. Cuomo in federal court, insisting that they have been 
abiding by the rules and should not be punished." 
New Jersey COVID Cases Spike. 
The New York Times (10/19, Tully, Gold, 18.61M) reports, "Coronavirus cases in New Jersey, an 
early epicenter of the pandemic, are on the rise again, doubling over the last month to an 
average of more than 900 new positive tests a day, a worrisome reversal of fortune for a state 
that had driven transmission rates to some of the nation's lowest levels." Gov. Phil Murphy (D) 
"said Monday that residents should refrain from all but necessary out-of-state travel." Murphy, 
"who has been conservative in allowing the state to reopen, said he would consider targeted 
shutdowns to curb the spread, as Connecticut and New York have done, but he suggested that 
would not cure the problem." The "new cases, he said, do not appear linked to reopened
