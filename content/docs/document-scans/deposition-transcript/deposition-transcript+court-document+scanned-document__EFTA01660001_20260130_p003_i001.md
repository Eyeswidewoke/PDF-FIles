Let me provide two examples of how Mr. Indyke's conflict of interest and absence from 
Mr. Epstein's workplace will result in insufficient monitoring of Mr. Epstein's activities. I have 
learned that Mr. Epstein has been noticed for a deposition in connection with one of the civil suits 
filed by one of his victims. Mr. Epstein's counsel have stated that the deposition need not take 
place at the Stockade because Mr. Epstein is out on work release. The deposition has nothing to 
do with The Florida Science Foundation and, accordingly, cannot possibly fall within the scope 
of his duties. If the deposition were to occur at the office of The Florida Science Foundation, it 
would violate the ban on Mr. Epstein receiving visitors at his workplace. If the deposition were 
to occur at the offices of one of the attorneys, it would violate the ban on leaving the workplace. 
To the extent that Mr. Epstein is using any of his time outside the Stockade to work with his 
attorneys in connection either with his criminal case or the multitude of civil cases filed against 
him, it falls outside the scope of his duties to The Florida Science Foundation and would seem to 
violate the rules of the Work Release Program. 
As another example, one of Mr. Epstein's attorneys has suggested that Mr. Epstein is using 
his time on work release to manage investments resulting in investment income of millions of 
dollars. If that is true, then Mr. Epstein is acting outside of the scope of his employment with 
The Florida Science Foundation. Instead, that would be in keeping with Mr. Epstein's work for 
his for-profit corporation, which would inure to the benefit of Mr. Indyke. Because that work 
would result in a financial benefit to him, and because he is Mr. Epstein's subordinate at that 
corporation, Mr. Indyke would be reluctant to inform the Sheriff's Office of this violation of the 
terms of Mr. Epstein's Work Release contract. 
The "references" listed by Mr. Epstein all have the same conflict of interest. Mr. Epstein 
did not list any past or present co-workers, supervisors, or even clients. Instead, he has listed 
four attorneys who are currently retained—and paid handsomely—by Mr. Epstein. Their attorney-
client privilege obligations would further restrain them from notifying the Sheriff's Office if Mr. 
Epstein was not abiding by the work release rules. 
As I previously mentioned to IMI=r, 
the decision regarding work release is 
completely within the discretion of the Sheriff's Office. However, in exercising that discretion, it 
would seem that the Sheriff's Office needs a complete and accurate picture of Mr. Epstein's 
offenses and his work situation. Further, Judge Pucillo, who conducted the change of plea and 
sentencing, heard the factual proffer and imposed Mr. Epstein's sentence. She has not been 
consulted regarding Mr. Epstein's application for work release. 
I understand that Judge 
McSorley's standing order states that she "takes no position with respect to the eligibility of any 
inmate sentenced in this Division unless specifically stated at time of sentencing." However, 
because of her absence, Judge McSorley did not conduct the sentencing and, therefore, could not 
have stated any objections to work release at that hearing. Given that it is unclear whether Judge 
Pucillo was aware of Judge McSorley's order when she imposed sentence, I respectfully suggest 
that the appropriate judge be consulted for her position on this issue as well. 
Request for Notification 
I would appreciate if you would keep me informed of any changes to Mr. Epstein's release 
status so that I may fulfill my obligations to keep the victims identified through the federal 
investigation informed of Mr. Epstein's status. I have informed all of the victims of Mr. Epstein 
of the change in his incarceration status and that you are the contact person if they have any 
questions. Some may ask that their locations be amongst the "Exclusionary Zones" programmed 
into Mr. Epstein's GPS unit. If you need their addresses, please let me know. 
Please feel free to contact me with any questions or concerns. 
Sincerely.
United States Attorney
