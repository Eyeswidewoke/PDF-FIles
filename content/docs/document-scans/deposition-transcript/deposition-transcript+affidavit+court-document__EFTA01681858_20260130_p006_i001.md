Committee, I oversaw the drafting of the current version of the Prosecution Function Standards 
and participated in drafting and discussing prosecutors' candor obligations in particular. 
In general, as "ministers of justice," prosecutors have more demanding candor obligations 
than other lawyers. Prosecution Function Standards, Standard 3-1.4(a) states: "In light of the 
prosecutor's public responsibilities, broad authority and discretion, the prosecutor has a heightened 
duty of candor to the courts ...." Prosecutors' candor obligations are not fully incorporated in the 
professional conduct rules or in courts' sanctions decisions. To a significant extent, courts expect 
candor from prosecutors regardless of whether the expectations are fully incorporated in 
enforceable law or whether a lack of candor is sanctionable. In rendering this opinion, I address 
what courts should expect of prosecutors as "ministers of justice" — expectations that are not fully 
codified in professional conduct rules and sanctions decisions. 
If the Government were to call 
s its witness in connection with the sentencing, 
then it would have the ordinary obligationfirst to satisfy itself of the truthfulness of her testimony 
and then to disclose impeachment material. See, e.g., NY Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 
3.8(b); ABA Prosecution Function Standards, Standard 3-1.4(b) ('The prosecutor should not make 
a statement of fact or law, or offer evidence, that the prosecutor does not reasonably believe to be 
true . . ..") it, Standard 3-5.4(c) ("a prosecutor should make timely disclosure to the defense of 
information [that tends to impeach the government's witnesses] that is known to the prosecutor, 
regardless of whether the prosecutor believes it is likely to change the result of the proceeding."). 
I assume that the Government does not intend to make 
its witness, and that 
insofar as anakes 
a presentation to the court, she will do so pursuant to her statutory 
right as a putative victim. Even if so, in m *udgment, equivalent candor obligations arise if the 
Government were to rely on 
statement in its submissions to the court, thereby 
essentially making her its witness. Before asking the court to credit 
information, the 
Government should consider available evidence bearing on to her credibility, including deposition 
testimony that, it has been told, raises serious uestions concerning the credibility of her relevant 
testimony. The prosecutors should not rely on 
ormation unless, in the language 
of Standard 3-1.4(b), they "reasonably believe it to 
true." Their belief in 
reliability would not be reasonable unless they consider readily available information that, they 
have been told, discredits her and, given the totality of the circumstances, reasonably find her 
account truthful. 
Finally, even assuming the Government does not intend to advance or rely on 
statement or testimony, its duty of candor to the court may be implicated, because prosecutors bear 
some responsibility to protect the sentencing court from relying on false information. As I have 
previously written: "Since the judge has no independent investigative authority, the sentencing 
judge must rely in large part on the prosecution for the relevant facts about the offense. If any 
lawyer must make full and frank disclosure of factual matters relevant to the sentencing court's 
decision-making, it is surely the prosecutor." Green, Candor in Criminal Advocacy, supra, at 446; 
cf. United States v. E.V., 500 F.3d 747, 754 n.12 (81° Cir. 2007) (referring to 'prosecutors' 
obligation to apprise the court of facts relevant to sentencing"). Consequently, the Office cannot 
consciously disregard 
deposition testimony bearing on the credibility of her 
submission to the court; further, if the Office concludes that asubmission 
is unreliable,
