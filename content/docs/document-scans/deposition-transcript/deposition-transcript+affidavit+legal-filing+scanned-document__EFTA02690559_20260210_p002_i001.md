3. 
Prosperity. Saudi Arabia pumps about 10mm barrels per day of 
oil. Iraq is said to be currently pumping about 2.5mm barrels of oil per day. Iraq 
is second only to Saudi Arabia in the size of its proven oil reserves so they have 
the potential to materially change the supply of oil in the world. (They are also 
estimated to have the 10th largest reserves of natural gas in the world). If in 5 
years (or maybe its longer) Iraq could increase its oil production by 4 mm barrels 
per day, this would materially alter the pricing of oil worldwide. It would also 
materially alter the leverage that Saudi Arabia and Russia currently have in the 
world of energy. That would change the geopolitical map. 
With oil at $140 per 
barrel, emerging economies are going to have a hard time emerging and 
developed economies are going to suffer material change. Prosperity gives 
hope for rich and poor alike, and hope is one of the preconditions for peace and 
stability. Were Iraq to be able to increase its oil production, it could affect the 
world's economic prospects. 
4. 
Peace. Let's review the region. Saudi Arabia is currently a critical 
player to regional stability because of their vast reserves of oil and money. The 
sustainability of their governance system is a source of constant speculation. 
The country has not modernized, has massive unemployment amongst its youth 
and is a source of fundamentalism in the region. Were Saudi Arabia to become 
chaotic or fall into hostile hands, this could destabilize the global economy. This 
is an issue we ignore at our peril. Iran is a major player in the region. It is ruled 
by a theocracy, it is developing nuclear weapons (and the ability to deliver those 
weapons). In the view of some knowledgeable Arabs, if Iran gets the bomb, they 
will use it offensively. Iran scares the crap out of everyone in the region and if 
you want to understand the neighborhood, ask one of the neighbors. Next, 
Syria is ruled by a brutal dictator. Lebanon is always on the brink of civil war 
and Egypt has profound demographic challenges. If we head east, Pakistan is 
arguably the Mother of all Problems. So what is Iraq about? Assume that Iraq 
developed a reasonably stable system of governance. Petraeus calls it 
Iraqocracy. Not our version democracy, but some version of democracy. I 
recognize this is a big assumption and it may prove to be the faulty major 
premise of the strategy. However, were such a governance model established, 
this could have profound ramifications for the region. Were the surrounding 
populations to see a country where its people were improving their standard of 
living, where minorities don't rule, but have a voice and where there is some 
form of accountability on the part of government officials, those populations may 
well say "why not me". The US would no longer have to be the policeman. 
Indigenous populations become the indigenous cops and we could play a 
supporting role. So, for example, there are those who feel that without regime 
change, Iran could well trigger a nuclear war. Currently the regional players who 
believe this turn to the US and say "fix it". The ugly truth is that we can't fix it. 
Only the Iranians can fix it and a stable and prosperous Iraq could well provide 
the role model. If you apply similar analysis to other surrounding countries (e.g. 
Saudi Arabia), you can see that a stable Iraq could be a game changer for the 
surrounding countries. I would also point out that a successful Iraq means that
