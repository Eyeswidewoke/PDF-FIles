discovery in a civil case. Fisher objects to Proposed Paragraph 7(c). He contends that 
use of any confidential documents produced in this case should be limited to this 
lawsuit. 
Fisher's objection is sustained, for three reasons. 
First, confidentiality orders are intended "to 'secure the just, speedy, and 
inexpensive determination' of civil disputes by encouraging full disclosure of all 
evidence that might conceivably be relevant." Martindell v. International Tel. & Tel. 
Corp., 594 F.2d 291, 295 (2d Cir.1979). Unless protective orders are "fully and fairly 
enforceable," persons relying upon such orders will be inhibited from providing 
essential testimony and information in civil litigation, "thus undermining a procedural 
system that has been successfully developed over the years for disposition of civil 
differences." Id. A provision that would permit the use of confidential information 
outside of this lawsuit would defeat the very purpose of the protective order. 
*2 Second, although the Court recognizes the strong public interest in obtaining 
all relevant evidence required for law enforcement purposes, the Govemment as 
investigator "'has awesome powers' [that] render unnecessary its exploitation of the 
fruits of private litigation." Id. (quoting GAF Corp. v. Eastman Kodak Co., 415 F.Supp. 
129, 132 (S.D.N.Y.1976)). Proposed Paragraph 7(c) should not be included in the 
protective order "merely to accommodate the Government's desire to inspect protected 
[information] for possible use in a criminal [or civil] investigation." Martindell, 594 F.2d 
at 296; cf. id. (denying Government's order to modify or vacate protective order to 
permit it access to witnesses' deposition transcripts protected by the order). The 
Government will still be able to fulfill its statutory obligation to enforce the law through 
ordinary criminal and civil process and by taking advantage of the substantial 
resources available to the Government to investigate suspected violations of the law. 
Third, tax information has traditionally been treated as private and confidential 
information. Section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code, for example, specifically 
prohibits any person, including an officer or employee of the United States, from 
"disclos[ing] any return or retum information obtained ... in any manner in connection 
with his [or her] service as such an officer or employee." 26 U.S.C. s 6103(a). Section 
6103 also spells out the limited situations when an officer or employee may disclose 
return information. See, e.g., s 6103(h)(2) (disclosure of returns and return information 
to Department of Justice employees), s 6103(h)(4) (disclosure of returns or return 
information in judicial or administrative proceedings). This section provides specific 
limits on the disclosure of returns and retum information and bolsters the conclusion 
that Fisher's tax return is entitled to protection from disclosure by the Govemment in 
this action. See Richards v. Stephens, 118 F.R.D. 338, 339 (S.D.N.Y.1988) (s 6103 is 
intended to protect the confidentiality of taxpayers' returns by "regulat[ing] ... disclosure 
of tax returns by people having access to tax retums in their official capacity"). Fisher 
should not become the subject of an IRS tax investigation merely because of 
documents he produced in what is essentially a landlord-tenant suit. 
For these reasons, I will enter a protective order that does not contain Proposed 
Paragraph 7(c). The Govemment may not use confidential information produced in 
discovery pursuant to the protective order for any purpose other than prosecuting this 
lawsuit, absent further order of the Court. 
SO ORDERED.
