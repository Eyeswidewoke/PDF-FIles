US GDP Shrunk By Record Amount In Second Quarter. 
The CBS Evening NewsVi (7/30, story 6, 1:05, O'Donnell, 4.19M) reported the economy's "stall 
is evident" in Thursday's announcement of a "historic drop in gross domestic product. The 
economy shrank a record 9.5% in the second quarter, sidelining millions of Americans." ABC 
World News TonightVI (7/30, story 3, 1:30, Muir, 7.06M) referred to the economy "contracting 
at an annual rate of nearly 33% from April to June," and NBC Nightly NewsVi (7/30, story 6, 
1:10, Holt, 5.82M) pointed out the drop was "worse than the Great Recession and the Great 
Depression." 
CNBC (7/30, Cox, 3.62M) says on its website that Q2 US GDP "plunged 32.9% on an 
annualized basis," but "economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for a drop of 
34.7%." CNBC says "sharp contractions in personal consumption, exports, inventories, 
investment and spending by state and local governments converged to bring down GDP, which 
is the combined tally of all goods and services produced during the period." Reuters (7/30, 
Mutikani) reports that "the bulk of the deepest contraction in at least 73 years...occurred in 
April when activity almost ground to an abrupt halt after restaurants, bars and factories among 
others were shuttered in mid-March to slow the spread of coronavirus." 
The Washington Free Beacon (7/30, Stiles, 78K) reports, "Global pandemics typically 
aren't good for national economies. On the contrary, they are usually bad. The US economy, for 
example, contracted 9.5 percent in the second quarter of 2020," and "the German economy, 
meanwhile, declined by 10.1 percent." 
Assistant Treasury Secretary for Public Affairs Monica Crowley said on WOR-AMVi New 
York (7/30, 17K), "We knew it was going to be bad and it is bad, but there are signs of life in 
this economy. When we take a look at some of these numbers on the internals of the GDP, we 
see that economic activity has already resumed in most parts of the country and if we take a 
look at some of these internal numbers about monthly retail sales, industrial production data, 
those things are important gauges of growth and those numbers are up even after severe 
declines in March and April." 
NEC Chief Economist Joe LaVorgna said on CNBC's Squawk On The StreetVi (7/30, 304K), 
"The figures are annualized, which is fine when you have a growing economy - which happens 
about 95% of the time. So if you look at it, it's really more like a 9% drop, 9.5% drop because 
we annualize it assuming it's going to continue for the full year. That's clearly not going to 
happen because this really is a pandemic contraction, and we've seen it in the data with March 
and April being extraordinarily weak and then seeing record growth in many series in May and 
June - retail sales, industrial production, employment, the PMI. So, we're looking at this as 
really being a shock almost something akin to a natural disaster." 
To Politico (7/30, White, 4.29M), "the question now for President Donald Trump, trailing in 
the polls and facing a daunting reelection effort, is just how much conditions can snap back in 
the months leading up to Election Day." The Washington Post (7/30, Al, Siegel, Van Dam, 
14.2M) says, "Thursday's report helps explain which parts of the economy suffered as people 
stayed home, cut back their spending and suddenly overhauled their routines. With retail stores 
shuttered and people swapping out their work wardrobes for leisurewear, clothing and footwear 
sales dropped. The pandemic also triggered a collapse in oil prices, exacerbated by lower 
gasoline sales and dampened transportation services, as Americans stayed home and avoided 
commutes or basic errands." In addition, "Health care fell off as the pandemic pushed people to 
cancel non-emergency visits and procedures, triggering layoffs within the health care industry." 
The AP (7/30, Crutsinger, Wiseman) says, "The economy's collapse in the April-June 
quarter, stunning in its speed and depth, came as a resurgence of the viral outbreak has 
pushed businesses to close for a second time in many areas." The AP adds, "So steep was the 
economic fall last quarter that most analysts expect a sharp rebound for the current July-
September period. But with coronavirus cases rising in the majority of states and the
