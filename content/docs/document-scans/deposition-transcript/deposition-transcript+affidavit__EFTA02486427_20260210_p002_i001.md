Well, this came in today, and this clarifies =ome things.. Particulary it is clear 
that this office is not really =ollowing any procedure and isn't out to deal with me in a =ay that respects my rights. (no 
surprise to you!). Statements =ike "include, but not limited to"? What the fuck =s that? Also, it seems clear that from 
the list of =E2.4teallegations' (and note they don't explain which =nes they are actually investigating), that the list is 
basically the =uzzfeed article.. so indeed they are not restricting themselves in at =east listing just university related ones 
(items 4 and 5.. and re 5, =hat the fuck? Who the fuck cares what an employee thinks about a =onor?) 
Anyway, =t is clear to nancy and I that we need to bring Justin in, at least as =n 
advisor before I have my meeting next tues.. I was going to consider =ringing him in depending upon what I heard there, 
but based on this, =here are various jurisdictional issues, and respecting my rights issues =hat I need to be guided on. (I 
plan to ask specific =uestions now during the meetings next tues, but not give responses at =he time). 
So, at this point I plan to write to her to ask her for some =pecifics (which I don't 
expect her to agree to answer till we =eet, but we will see), and contact Justin to let him know I will pay =is retainer. I 
don't want him accompanying me to the =eeting on Tues, but I want to plug him in the loop with me, and help me =now 
what to ask, and how to be prepared to respond.... 
<=iv class=""> 
Just FYI.. so I =uess I will take up your offer of the $25K...
