An Interview with Jeffrey Epstein 
Page 3 of 5 
NCC: CBS has refused to run your ads, claiming that they are "too controversial" 
and "too emotional." What is it about these ads that they find so objectionable? 
That's the million dollar question... Initially, I thought that the incorporation of 
Arabic might have appeared to be less than politically correct. In hindsight, I believe 
that educating the public to the threat of radical Islam doesn't fit CBS's leftist 
agenda - an opinion supported by their latest posting of an 'AV article on terrorism. 
Once again, CBS was duped. They posted a faulty Fatwa, on their news site, which 
was issued by a questionable Islamic organization with reputed ties to terrorism. If 
the article wasn't bad enough, they chose to accompany it with a picture of a Muslim 
man praying next to an American flag. CBS redesigned the flag by replacing the 
stars with a crescent. Many of us consider this to be the ultimate act of desecration -
something particularly offensive when our servicemen are dying overseas. 
NCC: Is this simply a case of political correctness run amok, or is something else 
behind it? Could the reasons be more partisan in nature, or might they fear angering 
Islamic pressure groups such as CAIR? 
In consideration of ABC's recent firing of conservative talk show host Michael 
Graham, I believe something far more sinister might be in play. The "MSM" is 
partisan and is committed to undermining the war effort and our support for the 
State of Israel. Just weeks ago, the BBC began to generically label Islamist terrorists 
as 'bombers". Not to be outdone, The New York Times, America's greatest liberal 
rag, decided to revise history by showing respect for a barbaric butcher. Accordingly, 
Abu Musab Zargari, the SOB who not only fathered the "IED" but is responsible for 
the loss of thousands of military and civilian lives, is now being referred to as a 
Jordanian fighter. 
I have been told that media-related organizations are intimidated by the treat of 
legal action from groups like CAIR. Additionally, rumors have it that several talk 
show hosts are fearful of reprisal by Islamist extremists - especially when dealing 
with topics concerning Iran. 
NCC: Mr. Epstein, of recent weeks we have witnessed horrific terrorist attacks in 
London and the Middle East - are we any safer here? 
Relying on the opinions of those counter-terrorism experts which I consult with, the 
answer would be no. We've come a long way but not far enough. Unfortunately, we 
will suffer from horrific attacks over the coming years. Any labeling of the current 
conflict as a war on terrorism is a misnomer. We are engaged in a struggle between 
two diametrically opposed cultures. A religious war was declared on the West by 
Islamic extremists who are committed to our very destruction. We can expect this 
war to last for decades and no military options should be taken off the table. If and 
when the Islamo-fascists secure nuclear weaponry, they will use them. 
NCC: Are we more or less vulnerable than pre-9/11, and why? 
I believe that we are significantly more vulnerable now because the Jihadists learned 
much from our response to the attacks... They tested American resolve and 
discovered how quick we were to forget even the most horrendous acts committed 
against us. Just consider how our "enemies from within" set out on their treasonous 
quest to "Vietnamize" the war effort in Iraq. We're currently engaged in fighting a 
war on two fronts - a war which is our to lose if not supported on the home front. 
I believe that the treat we are now facing is far more dangerous than that posed by 
the Third Reich in the thirties. The Nazis were regionalized and for the most part in 
uniform. Our Islamist enemies are widely disbursed and disguised within our own 
borders. With a global population in excess of 1.2 billion Muslims, consider the 
consequences of only having a mere 10% of them or 120 million sworn to our
