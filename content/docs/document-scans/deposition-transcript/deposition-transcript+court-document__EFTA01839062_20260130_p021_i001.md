Then prosecutors learned that Diallo had gone to 2820 after the encounter. On June 28th, 
2011, when prosecutors then re-questioned her about it, as they noted in their motion for 
dismissal, she "admitted for the first time that she had been untruthful about this key point." 
She then provided them with a detailed version of her entry into room 2820. Diallo now said 
that after the alleged assault in the presidential suite she ran out the door and had "gone directly" 
into room 2820. As the prosecutors established that the alleged assault had ended at about 12:13 
PM, and it takes just a few seconds to cross the hallway, this meant that if this version was true 
she had entered 2820 just after, 12:13 PM. She then said that vacuumed and cleaned that room. 
While that would account for her whereabouts, there was no electronic key swipe record of her 
entering in at 12:13 PM. 
Of course, the door could have been opened from the inside, but the 
occupant had checked out at 11:37 am. So if someone opened the door for her, it could not have 
been him. (The hotel would not identify the registered guest other than to say he was a "French 
businessman."). There is no key entry between 11:37 AM and 12:26 PM so, if Diallo was telling 
the truth to the prosecutors in June that she ran directly to room 2820 after leaving the presidential 
suite, an unknown person in room 2820 may have opened the door for her at 12:13 PM. 
The issue became even murkier after Diallo, confronted with the data from the key records, 
again changed her story. On July nth 2011, in what prosecutors called "Version 3," Diallo said 
that after the incident she had waited in the hall until after she saw DSK leave the floor, which 
was at 12:26 PM. Only then did she momentarily go into room 2820 to retrieve her cleaning 
supplies. Her previous entry key swipe was at 11:33 AM. So, according to this version, she had 
that locked her cart with all the equipment she needed to clean the presidential suite in room 2820, 
even though the occupant had not yet checked out, before going to the presidential suite. But 
given Diallo's conflicting accounts, all that we really know for certain is what the electronic key 
records disclose: Diallo entered the room 2820 three times before the registered guest left and 
once afterwards at 12:26 PM. We don't know if anyone else was in the room when she was there, 
why she left her gear there before the guest had checked out, or whether, if her June version is 
true, how the door was opened at 12:13 AM without leaving a swipe record. 
The Unexplained Time Lapse 
There was a gap of well over one hour between the time Diallo had her encounter with DSK 
and the time that it was reported to the police. She had run out of the presidential suite at, or 
before, DSK called his daughter at 12:13. The 911 call by the Sofitel security chief was received 
at 1:32 PM, according to the 911 report. So there is a 79 minute delay. Part of this gap was due to 
Diallo herself not immediately reporting the incident to anyone.. First, at 12:26 PM, as the key 
card records show, she briefly went back into the presidential suite, but did not stay to clean it. 
Then, approximately four minutes later, she asked a hypothetical question to another maid, and 
only when questioned about whether the hypothetical situation had happened to her, did she state 
that she had been attacked by the guest in the presidential suite. This allegation was at 12:30 PM. 
But even after her outcry, there was a one-hour delay before the hotel staff reported it to police or 
attempted to get her medical attention. As a result, Diallo did not arrive at St. Luke's Hospital 
until 3:57 PM, nearly four hours after the alleged attack. 
We know from CCTV tapes, phone records, and police reports that members of the hotel staff, 
including the hotel's head engineer, a security guard, and the head of housekeeping, were heading 
up to the 28"' floor within 10 minutes of her outcry. By 12:37 pm, according to key records, the
