renting them a house on the fringes of Watts and buying them sound equipment. "We were 
living solely off of Owsley's good graces at that time.... [His] trip was he wanted to design 
equipment for us, and we were going to have to be in sort of a lab situation for him to do it," said 
Garcia. 
Main career (1967-1995) 
One of the group's earliest major performances in 1967 was the Mantra-Rock Dance — a musical 
event held on January 29, 1967, at the Avalon Ballroom by the San Francisco Hare Krishna 
temple. The Grateful Dead performed at the event along with the Hare Krishna founder 
Bhaktivedanta Swami, poet Allen Ginsberg, bands Moby Grape and Big Brother and the Holding 
Company with Janis Joplin, donating proceeds to the Krishna temple. The band's first LP, The 
Grateful Dead, was released on Warner Brothers in 1967. 
Classically trained trumpeter Phil Lesh played bass guitar. Bob Weir, the youngest original 
member of the group, played rhythm guitar. Ron "Pigpen" McKernan played keyboards and 
harmonica until shortly before his death in 1973 at the age of 27. Garcia, Weir, and McKernan 
shared the lead vocal duties more or less equally; Lesh only sang a few leads but his tenor was a 
key part of the band's three-part vocal harmonies. Bill Kreutzmann played drums, and in 
September 1967 was joined by a second drummer, New York native Mickey Hart, who also 
played a wide variety of other percussion instruments. 
1970 included tour dates in New Orleans, Louisiana, where the band performed at The 
Warehouse for two nights. On January 31, 1970, the local police raided their hotel on Bourbon 
Street, and arrested and charged a total of 19 people with possession of various drugs. The 
second night's concert was performed as scheduled after bail was posted. Eventually the charges 
were dismissed, with the exception of those against sound engineer Owsley Stanley, who was 
already facing charges in California for manufacturing LSD. This event was later memorialized 
in the lyrics of the song "Truckle', a single from American Beauty which reached number 64 on 
the charts. 
Mickey Hart quit the Grateful Dead in February 1971, leaving Kreutzmann once again as the sole 
percussionist. Hart rejoined the Grateful Dead for good in October 1974. Tom "TC" Constanten 
was added as a second keyboardist from 1968 to 1970, while Pigpen also played various 
percussion instruments and sang. 
After Constanten's departure, Pigpen reclaimed his position as sole organist Less than two 
years later, in late 1971, Pigpen was joined by another keyboardist, Keith Godchaux, who played 
grand piano alongside Pigpen's Hammond B-3 organ. In early 1972, Keith's wife, Donna Jean 
Godchaux, joined the Grateful Dead as a backing vocalist. 
Following the Grateful Dead's "Europe '72" tour, Pigpen's health had deteriorated to the point 
that he could no longer tour with the band. His final concert appearance was June 17, 1972 at 
the Hollywood Bowl, in Los Angelesa3o] he died in March, 1973 of complications from alcohol 
abuse. 
The death of Pigpen did not slow the band down, and they continued with their new members. 
They soon formed their own record group, Grateful Dead Records. Later that year, they 
released their next studio album, the jazz influenced Wake of the Flood. It became their biggest 
commercial success thus far. Meanwhile, capitalizing on Flood's success, the band soon went
