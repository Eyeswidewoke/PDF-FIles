"her" funds and I would control "mine" is t=o ludicrous to discuss, though I understand the legalistic conjuring that =an 
be adduced to reach this conclusion. 
When I appointed H=rry to replace me as trustee, I took for granted that he would handle the =rust as I had. His 
behavior since, and this latest proposal, make it=very clear how wrong that assumption was. This proposal calls for hi= 
to be in complete charge, which means, as he has shown, that I can only p=ead for some funds by accepting conditions 
that he knows I will not accept= You recall, I presume, that this was true even when I faced an enor=ous tax bill because 
my IRA was being depleted for the benefit of the fami=y. 
To refresh your memory, let me repeat again what was happenin= with my IRA until I learned about it. There is a 
mandatory withdraw=l. Half was being distributed to family. The other half was be=ng used for taxes and management 
fees for the entire estate. In orde= to pay Alex's medical expenses, and to pay $50,000 a year for rent an= upkeep on 
the house in Wellfleet that we had given to the children and th=t I was barely using, I had to withdraw extra funds from 
the IRA, with the=onerous tax burden. The same when I withdrew something to live on.=C24, Under these 
circumstances, Harry refused to release funds from the T=ust for tax relief without onerous and humiliating conditions 
that he knew=l would not accept. Easy to predict what might happen under less ext=eme conditions. 
For such reasons, Harry's proposal is,=as I said, too outrageous to discuss. 
2.=C24> 
As you know, Harry's attorney has comm=nced a legal action that is intended to facilitate my resignation and 
the =ppointment of a successor trustee to take my place. Since you've wanted me removed for some ti=e and since I've 
said (from the first time you and I met) that I o=ly wanted to serve as trustee if all the family members wanted me to 
serve= I'm looking forward to resigning as soon as the court determines how I am to do so and how my successor is to 
be selected. =C24, 
=span>3. =C2* Given that my replac=ment is impending, it might be worth waiting until my successor is in plac= 
before responding to my requests for financial disclosure, as it's possible that my successor won't share my views as=to 
what the trustee of the trusts needs to know before making decisions ab=ut distributions. Likewise, if my successor will 
be identified soon =t might make sense for me to hold off on any distributions and leave it to the new trustee to work 
with you on figuring all of this o=t. In this regard I'm kind of a "lame duck" =rustee, wouldn't you say? 
4. =C240 To the extent that you want to push forward wh=le I remain the trustee, let me again state the basis for 
financial disclo=ure by you. It is that, as trustee, I owe a duty to you and I owe a duty to your children (as the =emainder 
beneficiaries of the trusts). For the present my primary du=y is to you and it is to distribute to you all income earned by 
the trusts= net of expenses, 
=/span> 
Until I asked about the matter recently, I am aware of no in=ome distributed to me earned from the trusts. I cannot be 
sure, beca=se I also do not recall having received any accounting of what is happenin= to the trusts, including 
distributions from them to others (or as require=, to me). Could you then please send me the records on these matters= 
and to distribute to you (or pay on your behalf) additional monies as reasonably needed t= the extent that your income 
from other sources is not sufficient to suppo=t your reasonable expenses.
