US bank and payable in US dollars, or with a negotiable instrument 
payable in US dollars and clearable through the US banking system, or through an electronic payment method payable in

accept payment_ made in a foreign currency, we will choose a conversion rate that rs acceptable to us to convert your 
payment into US dollars, unless a particular rate is required by law. Please do not send postdated checks. They will be 
deposited upon receipt. Our acceptance of an 
ment marked with a restrictive legend will not operate as an accord and 
satisfaction without our express prior wntten approval. Authorization for Electronic Debit: We will process checks 
electronically, at first presentment and any re-presentments, by transmitting the amount of the check, routing number, 
account number and check serial number to your financial institution, unless the checks not precessade electronically or a 
less costly process is available. By 5U: ending a check for payment, you authorize us to inmate an electronic debt from your 
bank or asset account. When we process your check electronically, your payment may be debited to your bank or asset 
account as soon as the same day we receive your check, and you will not receive that cancelled check with your bank or 
asset account statement. If we cannot collect the funds electronically we may *sue a raft against your bank or asset 
account for the amount of the check Authorization for Electronic Payments: By using Pay By Uomputer, Pay By Phone 
or any other electronic payment service of ours, you will be authorizing us to initiate an eledronic debit to the financial 
account you specify in the amount you request. Payments received after 8:00 p m MST may not be credited until the next 
day. Allocation ot Payments and Credits: Subject to applicable law, we will apply and allocate payments and credits 
among Features and Charges on your Account in any order and manner determined by us in our sore discretion. Finance 
Charges: Average Daily Balance (ADB) Method for Calculation of Finance Charges (FC): We use the ADB 
Method to calculate FC on your Account Under this method, we figure the FC on your Account by applying the Dad y 
Periodic Rate (DPR) to the ADB (as descnbed below) for each Feature ((including current transactions). Different daily
periodic rates may be applied to separate Feature balances. To get the ADB for each feature, we (1) take the beginning 
balance for each day (including unpaid FC from previous billing periods) (2) add any new transactions, debits, or fees, (3) 
subtract any payments or credits, and (4) make any appropriate adjustments. For each day after the first day of the 
period, we also add an amount of marmot equal to the previous daYs daily balance multiplied by the DPP for the 
Feature. This gives us the daily balance for the Feature for that day and the beginning balance for that Feature for the next 
day. If this balances negative, it is considered to be zero. Then, we add up all the daily balances for the Feature for the 
Wring period and dvde the total by the number of days in the being period. This gives us the ADB for the Feature. If you pay 
the blew Balance on the statement by the next Closing Date then you will avoid additional FC on features included in this 
New Balance. If you multiply the ADB for each Feature by the number of days in the billing period and the DPR for that 
Feature, the result will be the FG assessed on that Feature, except for variations caused by rounding The total FC for the 
bilingperiod is caloulated by adding the FC assessed on all Features of the Account This method of calculating the ACS 
and FC results in daily compounding of FC. Transactions Made in Foreign Currencies: If you incur a Charge in a 
foreign curie 
it will be converted into US dollars on the date it is processed by us or our agents. LThless a particular rate is 
required byapplicable law, we will choose a conversion rate that s acceptable to us for that date. Currently, the conversion 
rate we use br a Charge in a foreign currency is no greater than (a) the highest official conversion rate published by a 
government agency, or (b) the highest interbank conversion rate identified by ys from customary banking sources, on the
conversion date or the p
ion
 business day in each Instance Increased by 2.7%. This conversion rate may differ from 
rates in effect on the date of your charge. Charges converted by establishments (such as airlines) will be billed at the rates 
such establishments use. Billing Melds Summery: In Case of Errors or Questions About Your Bill: If you think your 
bill is incorrect, or if you need more information about a transaction on your bill, writere on a separate sheet of paper at the 
Customer Service address noted to the right. We must hear from you no later than 60 days after we sent you the first bill on
