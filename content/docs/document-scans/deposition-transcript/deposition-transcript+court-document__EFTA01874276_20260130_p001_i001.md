I yes trying hard gets the job done. I have told you how i think it gets done , but you don't 
believe me. fair enough.. from the outside it appears easy, doing the impossible is posssible , but 
it rcuircs following directions. . sorry, / I . as you continued to fly without sex, and in fact me 
strongly suggesting no sex, contrasts with your recollection, 2. funny line, but i would hope , 
that you woudl focus on positive things, it appears you only remember the negative. 3. 
Yes , 
no strings , freedom, had benefits for both of us .. . your decisions have predictable outcomes . 
as i said i am willing to sit and explain in as much detail , or answer questions. you have yet to 
put the questions that you need answered im writing so that i can at least attempt to help resolve 
what appears to be your distress. . I did not and will not lie. to you. your definition of "sex". 
seems flexible to bolster your hurt. 4. I would like to see you peaceful and productive . i have 
time to speak on the phone this weekend . if that suits you„ but would appreciate a list of 
questions so that it has meaning.

If you have taught me anything over the years it is that there is always a way as long as you make 
enough of an effort. Some things are not worth it but there is a way. It was one of the most 
attractive qualities about you. You were the master of doing the impossible that's why hearing you 
say the opposite is always disturbing. It doesn't mean it can't be done, it only means you haven't 
tried hard enough...your words, not mine. 
1. I never said I would only fly as your girlfriend. That conversation was strictly about sex...it had 
nothing to do with flying, only no more sleeping together without a relationship. You chose to walk 
away claiming you "don't want a girlfriend" (cowardly way out). The result of eliminating sex was the 
end of the friendship from your side. You became angry and aggressive. You made a comment about 
being annoyed NOT because I wouldn't fly (I said I still would!), but because I was to be on the 
Africa trip for "sex and sleeping" and "my replacement couldn't leave the country". The remark made 
no sense to me at the time and you quickly changed the subject, but it is now clear that you were 
talking about Karyna and the restrictions of her immigration fraud. That means you had been lying to 
me about not sleeping with anyone else during the time you slept and traveled with me. I do not 
forget these conversations and I do not forget being lied to. You are surprised I am angry...It takes a 
lot of discipline to forgive you for another let-down. 
2. I do not want to be with you, but it upsets me to see you use the same exact patterns to seduce, 
manipulate, and ultimately control and hurt other girls. I don't even like them and I actually feel 
guilty about knowing how they will end up. Meeting your latest Russian was like watching a person 
on death row eating their last lavish meal without knowing what's about to happen. That girl couldn't 
handle you if you came with instructions. I know what you are capable of and I will always be 
protective of you out of pure loyalty and stubbornness but my conscience is far from clear. 
3. The last phone conversation was just silly. Don't try to say you only had me around 'to fly' for those 
six months last year, sex played no role or you don't recall having any. It is simply untrue. 
You made it clear the flying was for my benefit. Seeing that your memory doesn't serve you well, let me 
remind you that you had daily new sex and more actual sex with me than even when I first met you. 
That's a lot. You kept telling me how happy you were and how perfect our time together was. You 
said there was nobody you would rather be with and we were having an amazing time. You invited
