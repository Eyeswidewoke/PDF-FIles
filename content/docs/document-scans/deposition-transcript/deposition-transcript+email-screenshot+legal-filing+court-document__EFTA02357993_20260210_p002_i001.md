what already seemed to be pretty remote from the empirical phenomena of language (though interesting 
mathematically) was becoming hopelessly remote.

Thinking about it, but I don't see how once can assign a value to a sentence (token or type or looked at even more 
abstractly, say the proposition expressed) in isolation from contexts, and value will vary all over the map as contexts 
vary. Take the standard example "the cat is on the mat," typically valueless, but not if the information conveyed is a 
signal to set off nuclear weapons that will destroy the world. Generalizes. 
On 3, there is a place for probabilities in the study of use of language (e.g., Charles Yang's integration of UG and learning 
theory in study of acquisition), but there is no indication of how they might enter into I-language. The concepts don't 
seem relevant. 
As for category theory, it makes sense to appeal to it if the results obtained at this level of abstraction have implications 
for the particular system under investigation. I don't see how it would be true in this case. Would we, say, learn more 
about the roots and implications of the copy theory of displacement if we abstracted to category theory? I don't see 
how. 
I'll ask Valeria if she's gotten the book yet. Sounds like a great evening.

1. the terms - value , money ,and currency- need definition. separate and apart from an intrinsic worth to an individual ,

I wondered whether sentences ( concepts without being necessarily

see no reason why not, does that set up an economics of sentences /concepts. .

taste of a new math. 
I read your attached paper. I would suggest that the system of analysis suffers from the use of early twentieth century 
reasoning , ie references to Merge. minimal computation ( the set notation can be misleading ) or modules. I think a 
system and notation that might, just might, help and add interesting insights is -category theory. fresher, more useful
