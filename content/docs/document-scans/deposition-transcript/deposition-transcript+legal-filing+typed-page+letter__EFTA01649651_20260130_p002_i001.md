Along with guilt and shame come blame and anger. Many times, survivors of sexual trauma will 
blame themselves for what happened and will direct anger at themselves. They beat themselves up 
with critical, hurtful, and mean thoughts and comments. Some may even engage in self-harming 
behaviors such as cutting as a coping strategy. 
A goal at this stage of treatment is to separate responsibility from blame. Again, no matter what 
happened, it is never a person's intention to get abused! Treatment focuses on challenging the 
blame; challenging the hurtful, critical thoughts; and learning to look at things from a new 
perspective and generate healthier, more adaptive thoughts. The blame and anger then shift to the 
perpetrator, as it should. 
Unfortunately, many people become stuck at this stage, fuming in anger and unable to move 
forward. Anger can make us feel more in control. When we are angry, people listen, do what we say, 
or leave us alone. There is power in anger that makes it hard to let go of. There can also be a fear 
that if one lets go of the anger, it means it was okay that the trauma happened (of course, it's not!). 
Over time, chronic anger can lead to isolation, loneliness, and depression. Treatment focuses on 
validating the anger, understanding why it's there, recognizing anger as a protective warning sign, 
and learning to manage it before it escalates into verbal or physical aggression.

Grieving can help a survivor of sexual trauma to get unstuck and begin to move forward. There may 
be many things to grieve: loss of innocence; loss of childhood; loss of feeling safe; grief over 
mistrusting others and always feeling like something is "too good to be true"; grief over loss of time 
(for school, relationships, jobs, or time spent self-medicating and in depression); and grief over "what 
could have been." Grief can make us feel helpless, powerless, vulnerable, and weak. 
It is natural to want to fast-forward through grief or, better yet, stuff it. 
Unfortunately, there are no shortcuts through grieving. 
It is natural to want to fast-forward through grief or, better yet, stuff it. Unfortunately, there are no 
shortcuts through grieving. The more you try to avoid it, the more out-of-control your emotions may 
feel. You may begin to fear crying or "losing it" when something triggers you. A common complaint 
is "overreacting" to small things. But remember, your body is not just reacting to the most recent 
"small thing"; it is also reacting to all the stressful events you experienced and stuffed away. 
Unpacking, unstuffing, and letting it all out is part of the grieving process. It is especially important 
that you set up a support system and a regular schedule of self-care activities. Treatment at this 
stage focuses on helping you establish the space, time, support to grieve and mourn. Treatment also 
helps you learn how to manage intense emotions so you are the one in control, not the emotions.
