1 Leon- had I known from the beginning what i know now, I woul= never have gotten involved with 
s issue never ! 
ever.!=C24, / I have 40 years of experience dealing with the IRS=C24› , I never have cheated ,evaded or crafted 
ridiculous4>=A0 returns . I am maniacal in taking careful=y crafted thoughtful positions that even if I don't receive 
the =ull benefit ( i have no recollection of any total loss on any positi=n.) I get most of it.. Hence my credibility wit= 
the IRS is quite unique and one of my most important assets. as you=know 
my research is detailed , the case laws 
rele=ant and though the arguments are sometimes hot there is great respect on b=th sides. 
. 
situation is emblematic of my warning s and advice that it appears still continues to go atiheeded. . I have 
repeatedly told you that these girls ,=all want to show how clever they are. they , come from countries whe=e taxes are 
rarely paid and on top of that , they have no experience=with real rules, money or biz . they often push the enve=ope 
beyond the pale 
unfortunately usually ending up ge=ting the principal in serious trouble.. ( sometimes by 
design,Q=A0 I assume not in this case, though she would not be unhappy to seafind 
out about it . ). For six 
months I have asked you , her 
if there was something i didn't know or wasn'= being told , as I 
found this particular audit highly unusual=- highly ! - not helpful that you with the usual voice o= authority telling me 
in no uncertain terms "what the ag=nt really wants" . I continue to be amazed how you , Barry, and brad share very 
strong detailed views witho=t having even one day of true experience. and relying on joslin and toms prono=ncements 
. I will review with you the ugly facts only o= the phone . 
2. I can easily ignore the fact tha= your repeated regarding the detectability of the first 100 mi=lion that saved your 
financial life. and provided a resurrection of = billion dollars of grats that had died is never bala=ced by the recognition 
of what you received and frankly not to=date- paid for . Each time you have chosen not to pay what we agree=. or 
what has been written by me in many emails BEFORE the tra=sactions are complete. you tell me that tom and joslins 
advice is one of the reasons that you feel you shouldn't pay the amo=nt owed written or agreed. ( mind you , this only 
happenst>=A0 AFTER you have received the benefits of my advice ) 1= the big transaction - you then add the easily 
refuted and silly arg=ment that it was Alan's idea. BTW It is = and would have been super easy for you to set a 
meeting if you had =hosen to get to the bottom of this farce. . you have met with =rad. there are memos. 
there are 
emails ( which yo= choose not even to look at , for , I can only assume . for fear tha= This fa=rications is as clear as I 
suggest it to be . ). NOW - lets assume t=at i show you that alan had only an irrelevant minuscule involvem=nt ,at the 
very end . way after the fact , no serious involve=ent in the crafting or execution of the idea - in a transaction 
that=saved your family 600 million dollars. or re detec=ability that in fact the first hundred or the full 175 actually 
now=C2. gets you a benefit that you have been going on about . . =what then ?! will there be more reasons that r 
why agreed amounts=should not be paid. or is this an exercise solely for am=sement . not mine 
3 It seems you have forgotten=C2* that it was you, that asked for my HELP! . 
audit , gift tax audit 
audit.Q=A0 8865, gagosian contract. underpayment =f Apollo offshore. tax. now AF and A . • it is wholly unfair t=at 
after I tell you what I will charge , you say , don't worry _.=C24> as you know we always work it out, complete the 
transaction to=your benefit and then and only then you decide not to pay ,Q=A0 you then categorically state ,( true ) 
that I never agreed=to your emails or even read them, or agreed to follow our agreement=which I unilaterally
