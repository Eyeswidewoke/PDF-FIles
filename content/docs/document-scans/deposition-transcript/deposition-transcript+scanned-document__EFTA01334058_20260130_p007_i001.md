blackmails should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law." 
Hollywood insiders say Frankie Muniz and Wes Anderson may also have been burglarized, but their reps deny 
it. Steve Coleman, a Los Angeles police officer who worked the case, told PAGE SIX: "Darnell Riley is in 
custody and charged with burglary, robbery, and home invasion. This is an ongoing investigation." 
Asked if the cops were looking into whether or not Riley had pulled the heists at the homes of Hilton, Johnson 
and the others, Coleman said, "That's fair to say." 
Wacky lackeys 
AND you thought P. Diddy forcing Farnsworth Bentley to hold his umbrella was bad? Mariah Carey retains a 
"petite Colombian woman" whose duties include "keeping Mariah's long skirts from touching the floor and 
humping around a Louis Vuitton backpack filled with bottled water," reports Stuff magazine. Nefly keeps a 
"personal jewelry jockey" to ensure the safekeeping of all his carat- encrusted bling. Ludacris has a minion 
whose sole role is to make sure his boss' Gameboy is always loaded with fresh batteries. And rapper N.O.R.E. 
has a hype man, Ching Bing, who has just one job: to stand onstage and swing around a towel. 
We hear . . . 
THAT Eva Longoria - milking her man-eating "Desperate Housewives" image to the max - has taped a spot for 
Sirius Satellite Radio where she huskily pants: "Some women have to guess what a man wants, but I know what 
a man really wants, something that will keep a smile on his face for a really long time - over 120 channels, 
enough to satisfy any man" . . . THAT a visitor to Japan - where extreme modesty and close quarters prevail -
reports that new public toilets have an unusual feature, the Flush Noise button, so that you can conceal the 
sound of actual bathroom functions with an artificial flushing noise.

Romanian babe scores rock 
NOW that his romance with Serena Williams has gone south, randy director Brett Ratner seems to be settling 
down with his former gal pal. Model Aline Pascau has been flashing a massive canary-yellow diamond 
engagement ring Ratner recently gave her, we're told. Pascau, a Romanian stunner, used to date reclusive 
billionaire Jeffrey Epstein. Epstein, who handles Leslie Wexner's fortune, helped land her a gig modeling for 
Wexner's Victoria's Secret brand, wehear, and paid for her to live in high style. After they broke up she and 
Ratner dated for a while before his fling with Williams. "She's beautiful, but dumb as paint," one pal of Pascau 
told us. "She never washes her hair and she always has a cellphone glued to her ear. Without Jeffrey she would 
never have gotten the Victoria's Secret job." Pascau, who likes high-profile men, also used to bed down with 
Formula I driver Eddie Irvine. Ratner's rep did not return calls. 
Publicity-hungry 
A ROMAN restaurateur is trying to exploit a near-miss with Bill Clinton, who recently canceled a dinner for 18 at 
the fashionable Agata e Romeo eatery. Owner Romeo Caraccio is whining to the press that Clinton's people 
ordered nearly $2,000 of special food and wines but never canceled, leaving him to take a loss. But his tale is 
baloney, says Clinton rep Jim Kennedy. "An advance person made a reservation, canceled it, and compensated 
the restaurant for' t," Kennedy said. He quipped, "A restaurant trying to get publicity out of a canceled 
reservation? I'm shocked."
