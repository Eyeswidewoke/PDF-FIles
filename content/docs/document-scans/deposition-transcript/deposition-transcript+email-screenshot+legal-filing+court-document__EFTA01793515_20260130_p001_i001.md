Subject: Proposal 
To: Jeffrey Epst=in <jeevacation@gmail.com <mailto:jeevacation@gmail.com> &=t; 
Mr. Epstein, 
We are sending this proposal to you with hopes that it encourages =ou to know that we have a good idea of what is 
needed to happen here on =he Ranch. The first page, is work for approx. 6 months. We have actual bid= for the contract 
work and we have done the pricing for all other material=that is needed on the other work. (staff repair) The Proposal 
for the Main House does not have any dollar amounts as we=do not feel that we have the authority to bring in someone 
to give us bids=without further damaging our fragile relationship with Brice and Karen= If we use the contractor that 
they have been using he would surely let th=m know. We know what needs to be done and how to get it done but have 
a hu=e road-block in that regard in front of us. 
The last pages are all work in progress and work that needs done. We d= not have the staffing or pricing because those 
two items play hand in h=nd with each other. If we have the staffing we need to be self sufficient,=much work can be 
accomplished by us here and we only have to buy material.=/div> 
As we see it, we would like to hire: 
(1)Main housekeeper (to live in the staff cottage). She will be respon=ible for the upkeep of the house. Salary of 
$25,000/yr 
(1)Carpenter (to possibly live in staff house at Ranch central). Will =elp with all building, repairing, painting, drywall, 
fencing. Salary of $3=,000/yr.( Depends on living arrangements) 
(1)Landscaper (to possibly live in staff house at Ranch central) Will =aintain greenhouse, Ranch Central grounds, Larry's 
house grounds and M=in House grounds- (This person could possibly do away with Landscaping con=ract that is in place) 
Salary $27,000/yr 
(1) part time house keeper. To come in for approx. 20 hours a week. Sh= will help maintain the Lodge, Bunkhouse, 
Caboose, Yurt, Log Cabin and wil= be the laundress during the times you are here. 
We feel that these people will be cross-trained and be able to multi-t=sk and fill in and help out in any situation. We 
would like to be self suf=icient for the most part other that specialty work that is needed at the M=in House. 
By taking on this responsibility and all the duties that go along with=it, we are asking for a salary increase to $60,000./yr 
each. We know that =his will require many extra hours and days and a lot of learning about thi=gs that have been kept 
from us. We gladly asked for this and are willing t= give it 110 %. We also know that there is accounting, books and 
budget= to meet and know we can get the job done for you with the teamwork needed=to make the transition. 
We both have always taken pride in our work and will expect other empl=yees to meet our standards of excellence. We 
will lead by example and will=continue to work along side and help who ever gets hired.
