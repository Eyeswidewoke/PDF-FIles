This course provides students with a broad overview of social psychological research and 
theorizing. Central to the course is the Idea that human beings are not isolated entitles who 
process information like computers, but social animals engaged in a complex network of social 
relations, driven by goals and motivations and constrained by cultural worldviews. We will analyze 
how this affects our perceptions of and attitudes towards individuals (including ourselves) and 
groups. We will examine why people conform, how they influence each other, why they firmly hold 
on to stereotypes and why they engage in pro- or antisocial behaviors. By analyzing these 
phenomena we will see how theories of human behavior can be tested rigorously via laboratory 
experiments and field studies.
