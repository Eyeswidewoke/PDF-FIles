befriended and picked up material from folk singers there, including Dave Van Ronk, Fred Neil, Odetta, the New Lost City 
Ramblers, and Irish musicians the Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem. In September, Dylan gained public recognition 
when Robert Shelton wrote a review in The New York Times of a show at Gerde's Folk City. Th= same month Dylan 
played harmonica on folk singer Carolyn Hester's third album, which brought his talents to the a=tention of the album's 
producer, John Hammond. Hammond signed Dylan to Columbia Records in October. The performances=on his first 
Columbia album, Bob Dylan, in March 1962, consisted of familiar folk, blues and gospel with=two original compositions. 
Dylan made two important ca=eer moves in August 1962: he legally changed his name to Bob Dylan, and he 
signed a management contract =ith Albert Grossman. (In June 1961, Dylan had signed an agreement with Roy Silver. In 
1962, Grossman paid Silver $10,000 to become sole manager.) Grossm=n remained Dylan's manager until 1970, and 
was notable for his sometimes confrontational personality and for protective loyalty. Dylan said, "He was kind of like a 
Colonel Tom Parker figure ... 
Dylan's lyrics have inc=rporated a variety of political, social, philosophical and literary influences. They defied 
existing pop music conventions and appealed to the burgeoning counterculture. Initially inspired by the performances of 
Little Richard, and the songwriting of Woody Guthrie, Robert Johnson and Hank Williams, Dylan has amplified and 
personalized musical genres. His re=ording career, spanning 50 years, has explored the traditions in American song —
from folk, blues, and co=ntry to gospel, rock and roll, and rockabilly to English, Scottish, and Irish folk music, embracing 
even jazz and the Great American Songbook. Dylan performs =ith guitar, keyboards and harmonica. Backed by a 
changing line-up of musicians, he has toured steadily since the late 1=80s on what has been dubbed the Never Ending 
Tour. His accomplishments as a recording artist and performer have been central to his career, but his greatest 
contribution is considered his songwriting. 
Since 1994, Dylan has publi=hed six books of drawings and paintings, and his work has been exhibited in major 
art galleries. As=a musician, Dylan has sold more than 100 million records, making him one of the best-selling artists of 
all time; he=has received numerous awards including Grammy, Golden Globe and Academy Award; =e has been 
inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Minnesota Music Hall=of Fame, Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame, and 
Songwriters Hall of Fame.Q=A0 The Pulitzer Prize jury in 2008 awarded him a special citation for "his profound impact 
on popular music and American culture, marked by lyrical composition= of extraordinary poetic power? In May 2012, 
Dylan received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from Barack Obam=. 
Having spent my formative y=ars trolling around the coffee shops in Greenwich Village in the 1960s like many of 
my generation I too wa= inspired by the lyrics of Dylan. And from Gerdes Folk City, to Café Figaro to the Bitter End and 
Café =ha?, as well as the Newport Folk Festival to Woodstock these were Bob Dylan's st=mping grounds as well as mine. 
And although I appreciated his music I was disappointed of his person whether it was at his homes in Greenwich 
Village=or Woodstock or wherever else our paths crossed. Yet, his "Like A Rolling Stone" is still one of my all-
time=favorites. And although most of Dylan's most important music is associated with the Folk music counter-culture 
generation of the 1=60s he truly provided a bridge from the beat to the rock generation. With=this said, I invite you to 
enjoy the music and genius of Mr. Bob Dylan....
