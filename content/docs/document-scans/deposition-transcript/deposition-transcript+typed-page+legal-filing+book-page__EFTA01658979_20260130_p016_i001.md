Bradley Birkenfeld are among "a makeshift team of investigators, cynical political operatives, 
and loyal Trump boosters who have latched on to the Hunter Biden saga as the miracle cure for 
the president's re-election woes." 
Putin Rejects Trump's Criticism Of Hunter Biden's Business In Ukraine, Russia. 
Reuters (10/25, Osborn) reports Russian President Vladimir Putin "said on Sunday that he saw 
nothing criminal in Hunter Biden's past business ties with Ukraine or Russia, marking out his 
disagreement with one of Donald Trump's attack lines in the U.S. presidential election." Reuters 
adds Putin, "who has praised Trump in the past for saying he wanted better ties with Moscow, 
has said Russia will work with any U.S. leader, while noting what he called Joe Biden's 'sharp 
anti-Russian rhetoric:" 
WSJoumal Rejected Effort By White House Allies To Push Hunter Biden Email 
Story. In a nearly 2,300-word article, the New York Times (10/25, Smith, 18.61M) reports 
two sources say that in October, three allies of the President met with "straight-shooting" Wall 
Street Journal White House reporter Michael Bender, to pitch him on writing an article about "a 
cache of emails detailing Hunter Biden's business activities." According to the Times, "The 
Trump team left believing that The Journal would blow the thing open and their excitement was 
conveyed to the president." However, the Times adds that as they "waited with excited 
anticipation for a Journal exposé, the newspaper did its due diligence," and after the New York 
Post broke the story, ultimately "published a brief item, just the stub of [its) reporting. The core 
of it was that [Hunter Biden's former business partner Tony Bobulinski) had failed to prove the 
central claim." 
Meanwhile, a New York Times (10/25, Lipton, Vogel, Haberman, 18.61M) analysis says 
"there is no evidence that the former vice president was involved in or profited from a joint 
venture pursued by his son and brother." 
However, the Wall Street Journal (10/25, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) editorializes 
that the press has a progressive bias, as is evident from the response to its reporting on Hunter 
Biden. The Journal accuses other mainstream media outlets of wrongly using their influence to 
advance Democrats at the expense of the public. 
Parnas: Giuliani Was Offered Salacious Documents Belonging To Hunter Biden In 
Spring 2019. Politico (10/24, Bertrand, 4.29M) reports President Trump's personal lawyer 
Rudy Giuliani "was offered salacious photos and other documents belonging to Joe Biden's son 
Hunter in the spring of 2019, earlier than previously known, according to one of Giuliani's 
closest former associates." Moreover, the alleged offer was made by a Ukrainian oligarch 
seeking assistance "with a potential legal jam." According to Politico, "The claim made by Lev 
Parnas, a Ukrainian-born businessman who was indicted last year on campaign finance charges, 
raises new questions about the provenance of the materials Giuliani has said he obtained 
recently from a computer repair shop in Delaware - and that he is now touting to accuse the 
Democratic nominee of corruption." Parnas, "who collaborated with Giuliani on the former New 
York mayor's quest to find damaging information on the Bidens beginning in late 2018, now 
says that similar materials were being offered to Giuliani just weeks after Joe Biden launched 
his presidential run." 
Politico Analysis: MAGA World Attempting "To Conjure Up The Same Event That 
Helped Them" During 2016 "Home Stretch." A Politico (10/24, Nguyen, 4.29M) analysis 
says that "MAGA world is trying to conjure up the same event that helped them in the home 
stretch of 2016 - an out-of-left-field FBI investigation into their opponent." Though "the 
ingredients are all the same," an FBI probe is not, in the current instance, "supplying the 
ingredients. Instead, MAGA adherents are sourcing the ingredients and hoping they summon an 
FBI investigation. And, of course, the new target is Joe Biden, not Hillary Clinton." According to 
Politico, Giuliani "has obtained a laptop he claims belongs to" Hunter Biden and has given the 
laptop "to the FBI, claiming it contains emails that show a variety of misdeeds and corruption -
even if the emails aren't all verified, don't offer conclusive evidence of the misdeeds and bear 
the hallmarks of a Russian disinformation effort."
