It's a powerful and convincing statement, but my feeli=g is that it would not be wise to submit it for publication. Taking 
=he stance of a reader who comes to the matter from afresh, perhaps having =eard some rumors but knowing nothing, 
the reaction I suspect will be of th= "where there's smoke there's fire" kind. Few are =illing to think through the 
arguments and factual details or to try to adj=dicate conflicting claims. I've seen this happen over and over o= other 
matters -- many years of having been accused of Holocaust denial, f=r example.. Ugly and bitter as it is, I suspect the 
best course now =s not to stir the pot by raising the issue publicly, opening the door to c=arges and accusations that can 
no doubt be answered in the court of logic =nd fairness -- but that's not the public domain, where innuendo and 
su=picion and accusation reign. 
Anyway, for what it's =orth, that's the way it looks to me, in part on the basis of experienc=. 
The great work that you have been doing speaks =or itself. My feeling is that you should keep at it, and simply deve=op 
a thick skin to fend off whatever ugliness breaks through now and then,=diminishing over time.

Sweetheart deal!" So goes the =ttack on the resolution of the more than a decade ago federal investigatio= 
involving our client Jeffrey Epstein. The attack is profoundly misp=aced, supported neither by the law nor the facts. Nor 
is it supported by t=e structure of our constitutional republic. To the contrary, Jeffrey was s=bjected to an extremely 
aggressive federal intrusion into what would typic=lly be considered a quintessentially local criminal matter in south 
Florid=. The offense investigated — at its=core, sexual favors for hire — has long been treated as = matter entrusted to 
laws of the several States, not the federal governmen=. The conduct — for which Jeffrey took full=C2 responsibility —
was a classic state offense and was tre=ted exactly that way by able, honest prosecutors in Palm Beach County. =A0 
Nevertheless, without a request from the state prosecutors, t=e federal government intervened. For their own 
opportunistic reasons= many are now criticizing the federal decision-makers at the time, includi=g now-Secretary of 
Labor Alex Acosta (then-United States Attorney in south=Florida), for not going far enough.

The critics are wrong on the facts and the law. They also=ignore a fact going to the heart of fundamental 
fairness: In th= decade since paying his debt to society, Jeffrey Epstein has led a life c=aracterized by responsible 
citizenship, numerous acts of generosity and go=d deeds. 
Here are =he true key facts: Jeffrey Epstein, a successful self-made busi=essman with no prior criminal history 
whatsoever, engaged in illegal condu=t that amounted to solicitation of prostitution. That =A0conduct was wrong and a
