Elle magazine made the same-sex marriage matter chic with a Jan. 18 cover featuring two longhaired young women in 
white joined in a chaste embrace. The 30-plus-page special report was bolstered by full-page ads for diamond rings by 
houses like Buccellati and Chaumet and 10 pages of bridal outfits.

per>, meanwhile, ended his haute couture show for Chanel a few days later with two brides (the Vogue cover girl Kati 
Nescher and a fellow model, Ashleigh Good) holding hands and wearing identical gowns. Their eyes were made up 
heavily in black. 
Mr. Lagerfeld's views have evolved. In 2010 he told Vice magazine that he was opposed to same-sex marriage. 
"I'm against it for a very simple reason: In the '60s they all said we had the right to the difference," he said. "And now, 
suddenly, they want a bourgeois life." 
Asked by reporters after his recent show if his use of lesbian couture was a sign of support for gay marriage, Mr. 
lagerfeld replied, "Of course it was." He added, "I don't even understand the debate." He pointed to the 1905 law that 
separates church and state in France. "Why can't people who live together have the same security as bourgeois 
marrieds?" he asked. 
But he said he was "less enthusiastic" about male couples as parents. 
"Two mothers seem to me better than two fathers," he said. "A child without a mother, that's a bit sad." 
The campaign for legalizing same-sex marriage comes as the appeal of traditional heterosexual marriage is waning. 
The sanctity of marriage was shaken forever by the social and sexual revolution of May 1968 that promoted equal rights 
between men and women and freedom from the tyranny of bourgeois institutions. That was especially true of 
institutions with strong ties to religion — like marriage. 
"After May '68, if you were modern, you didn't get married," said Frederic Martel, organizer of the Rond-Point event 
and author of the new book, "Global Gay: How the Gay Revolution is Changing the World." "Now we're at a moment 
when we are all a bit hysterical about marriage — gay marriage. But this is really a conservative movement, about 
stability in society and being good parents and protecting children and becoming rather ordinary." 
Seventy percent of the French do not think it is important for couples living together to get married, according to an 
Insee poll in 2012. Fewer than four marriages for every 1,000 citizens were performed in France in 2011, compared with 
nearly eight in 1970. 
The civil solidarity pact legislation, which was intended to give gay couples many of the rights of marriage, has been used 
overwhelmingly by straight couples as a kind of "marriage light." It is so popular as an alternative to marriage that in 
2010, there were four civil unions for every five marriages. 
Mr. Hollande, who made passage of the same-sex law a campaign promise, is a model for unmarrieds. He never married 
Segolene Royal, the mother of his four children; she called herself "a free woman" and marriage a "bourgeois 
institution" when she ran unsuccessfully for president in 2007. There is no indication he intends to marry Ms. 
Trierweiler. 
Carla Bruni, the singer and ex-model who became the third wife of Nicolas Sarkozy when he was president, has urged 
France's first couple to do the conventional thing and marry. In an interview with Elle last October, she said, "I think it is 
simpler to be the legitimate wife of the head of state rather than his partner," adding, "I felt a real easing of the general 
concern about me when I married Nicolas." 
While 63 percent of the French favor same-sex marriage, according to a poll by the French Institute of Public Opinion 
released last Saturday, 49 percent favor the right of same-sex married couples to adopt. There is less support for 
legalizing artificially induced pregnancies for gay couples. And some liberals and feminists consider surrogate 
motherhood an exploitation of poor working women by the rich. 
"It introduces the notion of the child as merchandise," the historian Max Gallo said on France Culture radio last Sunday. 
"You rent a belly and buy the product." 
Some feminist lesbians think a change in the law is retrograde. In Elle, the historian Marie-fosephe Bonnet called 
marriage an "instrument of domination" and same-sex marriage a project of gay men, not lesbians. 
"We want to be able to exist socially as women, without being a mother or 'the wife of,' " she said. Asked why she didn't 
mobilize lesbians against the law, she said, "No one can be opposed to equality."
