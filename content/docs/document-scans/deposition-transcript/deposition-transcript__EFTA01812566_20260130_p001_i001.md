you don't nag= over and over and over and over.. you don't tell the staff not to play with her, 
make the staff feel like shit and prefer and even ask them to leave, you don't continue to torture

play with anyone, but when I call her, she will rather do it with me. There is no question how much 
she loves me and how much she misses me when I leave. She would choose me over anyone else in 
the world. When she is charming other people and quickly wraps them around her little paw, she 
might as well wink at me ;-) 
You used to be like 
It was almost a show watching you charm another one, knowing it's just 
like a game and having no doubt you love me desperately ( we even used to secretly hi-five when 
you did well) I wish I could still feel that way but something changed. Now your 'games' are more 
secretive, there is no winking, they feel more real and I no longer know you really love me, miss me 
or would pick me over anyone else. That takes the fun part away. Now watching the routine is just 
stressful, like when 
runs out alone and I can't see her.. I still love her the same but I am 
annoyed with her, I yell her name as many times as it takes for her to get back and the whole 
experience is not pleasant.

I am very stressed , but disciplined. These times are the most stressful, therefore I have decided 
not to make important decisions, until I can breathe , at least a little. that is why i need time 
away. you add, rather than releive the stress. You were so different., you were affectionate, 
and supportive,. said little, and smiled. Then 
-- just one thing. please dont do just one 
thing. if you really love me , how can you continue to do just the one thing i can't live with. I 
told you on the street that if i gave in to your whiniing it would be the beginnng of the end. IF 
you , are there for me , i will be there for you. I walked on the beach , in pb with you,and 
asked you to stop nagging. i told you that i loved only you and=. I did not want to say 
no to either one of you . I asked you to stop nagging. I walkidCvith you on the ranch, 5 
years ago, when you were nagging about, 
I asked you to stop nagging. I have had the 
same discussion in the library in paris, the sixth floor. in new york, and at least four times in 
prison and five in the escalade. I have talked to shrinks with you , and without you. you have 
described your experience to me , what it is like to be with your mother. and how your father 
should leave. you look great, better than ever before.
