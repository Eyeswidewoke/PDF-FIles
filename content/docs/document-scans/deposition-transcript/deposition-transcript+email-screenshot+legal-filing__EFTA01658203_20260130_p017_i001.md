Bloomberg (7/21, Hurtado, 4.73M) reports, "A federal judge is considering making public a 
trove of previously sealed records from a 2015 lawsuit against Ghislaine Maxwell, who is now

by Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss, the head of New York's FBI office and lawyers for 
accusers of British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell after her July 2 arrest in Bradford, New 
Hampshire. He said the comments show that an order is necessary to prevent `prejudicial 
pretrial publicity by the government, its agents, and lawyers for alleged witnesses.' In 
particular, he cited comments at a news conference by William Sweeney, head of New York's 
FBI office, that referenced Maxwell as `one of the villains in this investigation' and compared her 
to a snake that `slithered away to a gorgeous property in New Hampshire.'"
