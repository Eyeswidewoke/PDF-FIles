Any Global Security that is transferable to the beneficial owners thereof pursuant 
to this Section 2.10 shall be surrendered by the Depository at the office designated by the Trustee 
to be so transferred, in whole or from time to time in part, without charge, and the Applicable 
Issuer shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, upon such transfer of each 
portion of such Global Security, an equal aggregate principal amount of Definitive Securities of 
Authorized Denominations (pursuant to instruction of the Depository). Any portion of a Global 
Security transferred pursuant to this Section 2.10 shall be executed, authenticated and delivered

Global Security may grant proxies and otherwise authorize any Person, including Agent 
Members and Persons that may hold interests through Agent Members, to take any action that a 
Holder is entitled to take under this Indenture or the Securities. 
(d) 
In the event of the occurrence of the event specified in paragraph (a) of this 
Section 2.10, the Applicable Issuer will promptly make available to the Trustee a reasonable 
supply of Definitive Securities. Pending the preparation of Definitive Securities pursuant to this 
Section 2.10, the Applicable Issuer may execute, and upon Issuer Order the Trustee shall

disregarded by the Applicable Issuer and the Trustee for all purposes. 
(b) 
If any Ineligible Holder becomes the beneficial owner of any Security or an 
interest in any Security, the Issuer shall, promptly after discovery that such Person is an 
Ineligible Holder by the Issuer, the Co-Issuer or the Trustee (and notice to the Issuer, if either of 
the Co-Issuer or the Trustee makes the discovery), send notice to such Ineligible Holder 
demanding that such Ineligible Holder transfer such Security or interest to a Person that is not an 
Ineligible Holder within 30 days of the date of such notice. If such Ineligible Holder fails to so 
transfer its Securities or interest, the Issuer shall have the right, without further notice to the
