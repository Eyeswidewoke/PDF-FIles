» It's like Jeopardy except that Watson won't =ave the answer. 
» One of my faculty, Cesar Hidalgo, recently wrote a book called =Why Information Grows". 
http://www.amazon.com/Why-Information-Grows-Evolution-Economies=dp/0465048994 
» I haven't read it yet, but I've had some =onversations with him. He's trying to approach it from a 
=hysics perspective and agues that life is "information" =nd "order". Not sure this is right. 
» "What is economic growth? And why, historically, has it =ccurred in only a few places? Previous 
efforts to answer these =uestions have focused on institutions, geography, finances, and =sychology. But according to 
MIT's antidisciplinarian Cesar =idalgo, understanding the nature of economic growth demands =ranscending the social 
sciences and including the natural sciences of =nformation, networks, and complexity. To understand the growth of 
=conomies, Hidalgo argues, we first need to understand the growth of =rder.

» At first glance, the universe seems hostile to order. =hermodynamics dictates that over time, order--
or information--will =isappear. Whispers vanish in the wind just like the beauty of swirling =igarette smoke collapses into 
disorderly clouds. But thermodynamics =Iso has loopholes that promote the growth of information in pockets. =ur cities 
are pockets where information grows, but they are not all the =ame. For every Silicon Valley, Tokyo, and Paris, there are 
dozens of =laces with economies that accomplish little more than pulling rocks off =he ground. So, why does the US 
economy outstrip Brazil's, and Brazil's =hat of Chad? Why did the technology corridor along Boston's Route 128 =anguish 
while Silicon Valley blossomed? In each case, the key is how =eople, firms, and the networks they form make use of 
information. 
» Seen from Hidalgo's vantage, economies become distributed =omputers, made of networks of 
people, and the problem of economic =evelopment becomes the problem of making these computers more powerful. 
=y uncovering the mechanisms that enable the growth of information in =ature and society,Why Information Grows lays 
bear the origins of =hysical order and economic growth. Situated at the nexus of information =heory, physics, sociology, 
and economics, this book propounds a new =heory of how economies can do, not just more, but more interesting 
=hings."
