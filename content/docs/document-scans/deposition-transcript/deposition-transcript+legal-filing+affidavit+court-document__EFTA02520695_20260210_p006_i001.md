=ontracts, by writing third parties with whom Professor Krauss is in =rivity, present a similarly inflammatory series of 
anonymous, =ecklessly false and malicious accusations, and then question: how can =he email's recipient allow such a 
person to serve on their =oard, or speak at their conference? The letter from Buzzfeed to =he University falls into both 
categories. There will be appropriate =egal consequences for Buzzfeed's actions. 
It =s my understanding that your office believes it is compelled by the =bove to 
investigate false, defamatory, anonymous accusations posited by =he online tabloid Buzzfeed by contacting third parties 
and potentially =ebroadcasting the tabloid Buzzfeed's accusations. To be =tear, these accusations were not made to the 
University by actual human =eings who are alleging they were victims. There is no evidence =hey were presented to 
Buzzfeed by actual human beings. Moreover, no =resent or former employees of ASU have made any such allegations to 
=our office, or to any office at ASU, to our knowledge. They are simply =lleged by a tabloid, and one that had yet 
published a "story" =n the topic when they forwarded these to you. You may propose to =ebroadcast this tabloid's libel 
to other third parties who have also =ade no accusation against Professor Krauss. I suggest that you =onsult with the 
University's counsel before taking so rash a =tep as re-broadcasting hearsay defamation that came to you via an =nline 
tabloid under these circumstances. 
Professor Krauss and I both recognize the absolute need to =nvestigate real allegations. 
Some of the women who have bravely =ome forward with personal harassment allegations against Harvey =einstein are 
my clients and friends. Some of these victims have =een advised by me. Those actual allegations are entirely distinct 
=rom a tabloid attempting to manufacture allegations to create harm. =nbsp;

Dear Mr. Aldous: 
I =m writing as litigation counsel to Professor Lawrence Krauss. It =as come to 
my attention that you and Buzzfeed have engaged in an =utrageous and protracted defamation campaign against 
Professor Krauss, =ncluding both libel and slander. Buzzfeed's campaign has =een malicious, undertaken with absolute 
reckless disregard for the =ruth, and despite repeated disprovals of the falsehoods you continue to =armfully 
disseminate. Your defamatory efforts have also been =ndertaken, for reasons known only to you and your colleagues, 
with the =ntention of tortiously interfering with the contracts of Professor =rauss, and Buzzfeed has unfortunately
