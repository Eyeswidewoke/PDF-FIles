The Manager will appoint its affiliate. Glendower Capital (U.S.), LLC ('Glendower U.S.). to 
provide investment advice to the Manager in connection with the investment management of 
the Fund. 
The Manager will be responsible for Glendower U.S.'s fees pursuant to a sub-advisory 
agreement. 
The Fund is seeking aggregate commitments to the Fund ('Commitments") of 
US$1.75 billion. although the General Partner may accept aggregate Commitments less than. 
or in excess of. this amount, provided that aggregate Commitments do not exceed 
US$2.5 billion (not including the Team Investment (as defined below)). 
In order to subscribe for an Interest. a prospective limited Partner must execute a deed of 
adherence and provide documentation to the General Partner in order to satisfy its 'customer 
due diligence' obligations. The General Partner may accept or reject a subscription for an 
Interest. 
The minimum Commitment for a limited partner of the Fund (collectively, the 'Limited 
Partners" and, together with the General Partner and the Second GP. the 'Partners") is 
USS5 million, although the General Partner may accept Commitments of lesser amounts. 
Each Limited Partner will make a capital contribution to the Fund equal to 0.01% of its 
Commitment. The remaining 99.99% of its Commitment may be drawn down by the Manager 
from time to time in the form of advances to the Fund (each, an 'Advance"). 
Certain individuals that are partners or employees of the Manager and Glendower U.S. will 
invest in the Fund (the 'Team Investment') indirectly through the Special Limited Partner (as 
defined below). 
The Team Investment will be equal to, at least, 1% of the aggregate 
Commitments. 
The General Partner will hold an initial closing of the Fund (the 'First Closing") as soon as 
practicable. From time to time after the First Closing one or more additional closings may be 
held as necessary to admit additional Limited Partners (each, and the First Closing, a 
'Closing"). The final Closing of the Fund is to take place no later than 15 months after the 
First Closing (the 'Final Admission Date), provided that, if on the 15 month anniversary of 
the First Closing, aggregate Commitments and commitments to any Parallel Fund (as defined 
below) are: (i) less than US$1.75 billion then the Final Admission Date shall be automatically 
extended to the 18 month anniversary of the First Closing or (ii) US$1.75 billion or more then 
the General Partner may extend the Final Admission Date with the consent of the Fund 
Advisory Committee (as defined below). 
Limited Partners admitted to the Fund subsequent to the First Closing (each a "Subsequent 
Closing Partner') generally will participate in the investments, if any, made by the Fund prior 
to their admission. Each Subsequent Closing Partner will generally contribute to the Fund an 
amount equal to its proportionate share of all funded Commitments of the Partners admitted 
in prior Closings, plus an additional amount computed as interest thereon at the higher of the 
preferred retum rate of 8% and three-month USD LIBOR plus 2% from the date of each 
applicable funding, with such appropriate adjustments as may be necessary to take into 
account distributions made to Partners admitted in prior Closings. 
Advances will be drawn down on an as needed basis to make investments and to pay the 
General Partner's Share and Fund liabilities and expenses at any time, generally upon 
12 business days' prior written notice.
