Subject Re: 
you forget, I tried , In the middle of lots of work = I did have a conversation , I had you to my 
house. you didn;t listen, you mere;y repeated your new take it or leave it demand. only one week 
before a big trip. it was nt nice, there was absoulutely no consideration for how it would affect 
me. none. it was all about you. there was no dialougue„ I want what i want , take it or leave it. 
I chose to leave it , and then you point out the strange fact that as a result of your decision i 
needed to find a sleepign replacement, IF you choose not to fly today„ I will also have to find a 
replacement. who wants to be a replacebale pilot you will say. your conclusion was we are 
stuck. you proposed two roads.. you choose? unreliable is unpredictable and difficult . You 
didn't comew to me and say jeffrey I have a problem, I am finding this difficult /I thought i was 
ok but im not. what do you suggest. .. you said jeffrey Im not doing this without more. here are 
your choices. IF you told me this morning you decided not to fly, i would have not been 
surprised .. your I Asked for so little. i only wanted what you were very clear in saying you 
didn't . I hope you fly today, . but if you choose not to please tell larry early..

I sense I have offended you. I didn't mean to do that. I can see my timing was bad 
and I'm sorry about that. 
I couldn't handle being your 'friend with benefits' and I needed to make that clear 
before things got out of control. I tried going along with it as long as I could after 
a failed attempt to resolve it a few weeks earlier, but it quickly became clear I am 
really not the right girl for casual sex/sleep with you. I wish I could be. I loved 
spending time with you. 
I understand being annoyed, but one really has to spin the story to arrive at the 
conclusion that this makes me generally unreliable. I can agree it makes me an 
unreliable sleep/booty call who is too sensitive for the position. 
You had to 'scramble to find a sleeping replacement.' Doesn't that say it all? Not a 
compromise or a negotiation...replacement was your default solution. Who wants 
to be a replaceable sleeping partner? 
You say you don't want a girlfriend. I understand that means you don't want to lose your 
freedom. Those are two different things. Sooner or later, you will realize you 
want, and need, a life partner. Hopefully you will also come to understand that to 
keep one, you do need to make small compromises and let them be a part of your 
life in a role that is not so disposable. I don't know how many girls it's going to 
take for you to get there, but I am afraid it will be too late to have the best one 
back. I asked for so little, I can't imagine a better deal for you. 
I understand your reservations, you've been burned before. But you threw away
