commenced negotiations with Xenophon Galinas for a possible sublease or 
assignment of the Premises. The proposed arrangement between Epstein and Galinas 
included payment by Galinas to Epstein of $100,000 for improvements to the Premises 
made by Epstein during his tenancy. At the same time, Epstein also commenced 
negotiations to sublet the Premises to Fisher. Fisher informed Epstein, however, that 
he would not enter into a sublease unless it was approved by the State Department 
and Fisher could be assured that he could remain in the Premises beyond January 31, 
1997. Epstein told Fisher that he had a right of first refusal under the lease 
amendment, and that pursuant to this right, he would take all necessary steps to renew 
at the end of the lease term. 
In the meantime, Galinas contacted OFM directly about a new lease for the 
Premises beginning in February of 1997. Negotiations between Galinas and OFM 
culminated in a "letter agreement" dated April 12, 1996 by which Galinas agreed to rent 
the Premises for a five-year term beginning February 1, 1997 for $16,000 per month, 
with yearly increases, up to $18,000 per month for the last year of the lease term. This 
agreement was expressly made subject to Epstein exercising his right of first refusal 
and renewing his lease for personal use only. In other words, OFM told Galinas that it 
would not consent to any request by Epstein for a sublet beyond January 31, 1997, and 
that it would permit Epstein to renew the lease beyond that date only if he occupied the 
premises personally. 
On April 16, 1996, Epstein notified OFM by letter that he intended to exercise his 
right of first refusal and renew the lease. Epstein contends that in a telephone 
conference between Richard Massey of OFM and Jeffrey Schantz, Epstein's 
transaction counsel, on April 19, 1996, OFM orally consented to Epstein's request to 
sublet the Premises to Fisher. The same day, Epstein wrote back, requesting "written 
confirmation" of OFM's alleged approval. By letter dated April 26, 1996, OFM formally 
responded to Epstein's request. In this letter, Thomas E. Burns, a representative of 
OFM, informed Epstein of OFM's intention to lease the Premises to Galinas beginning 
February 1, 1997 in the event that Epstein decided not to renew the lease and occupy 
the premises personally, and denied Epstein's request to sublet the Premises to Fisher. 
OFM's stated reasons for the denial were to (1) "minimize any difficulties in turning over 
the house to the tenant we have selected should Mr. Epstein decide not to reoccupy 
the premises under the new lease," and (2) "minimize the potential for damage to the 
premises from a short-term tenant occupancy." (Schantz At, Exh. D). OFM did, 
however, grant Epstein permission to sublet the Premises to Galinas for the remainder 
of 1996. 
*3 On May 3, 1996, Epstein again wrote to OFM, formally exercising his right of 
first refusal, believing such right to have been triggered by the April 12, 1996 letter 
agreement between OFM and Galinas. Thereafter, on May 7, 1996, Epstein and 
Fisher entered into a sublease agreement at a rental price of $20,000 per month, 
despite OFM's express denial of Epstein's request for permission to sublet to Fisher. 
Fisher claims to have entered into the sublease agreement based on Epstein's 
representations that the sublease was approved by the State Department and that 
Epstein had properly exercised his right of first refusal to renew the lease. The original 
sublease was to commence May 7, 1996 and terminate on January 31, 1997. In the 
event that Epstein's lease with OFM was extended, and the new rent under that lease
