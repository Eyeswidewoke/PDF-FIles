Re: 
as usual everyone liked=you alot . =AO each surprised by how knowledgeable you were about many var=ous subjects. 
however not one of them understood w=at the Daf ide= meant to you . what they heard was that ,you would " let=" 
them contribute to things like very special diseases( small w=rms or such ) that never gets funding and or if they like 
they could=give a portion of their money to women's health issue, but no mo=e than 60 percent of their giving. 77" --
and that's it. !!! sor=y 
my suggestions 
1. The idea first a=d foremost is about SHARING. . Sharing your experience , your judge=ent, your values your ideas. 
That requires asking THEM=C2 questions. ie " what are you interested in? h=w many kids do you have? what do you 
think? etc. =This is what we are thinking of doing that is GOOD FOR YOU and us. (=not merely good for women , 
Africans. uneducated kids etc. to=lets. .) here is how it might work,  here is how=it might be beneficial to you now, 
and for your estate. here i= how you can magnify you current impact in things that matter for- Y=U.! I ,Bill Gates will 
be your partner/ your friend =A0 your colleague in the giving arena. . we can do thing= together !. 
You can save 
taxes. =AO ( I , or someone else ( lawyer ) can do that part , I believe with more=credibility than you in this area ) . We 
can PARTNER, enjoy the proc=ss. etc do good. do better . etc. 
conversations =e philanthropy , without results are just more conversation.s. . =AO yes they all want to have a hand in 
where their money goes. of co=rse. they worked hard for it. but properly structured and pres=nted , the DAF=/span> 
provides more benefits than burdens. in every are=a. and a DAF</=pan> with you is the pinnacle of their giving lives. 
The example yo= gavethe group of the past was only one in which friends on who you =ersonally called gave YOU 100 
million each for YOUR polio prog=am. not what these guys would do even after being water board=d. 
I suggest we have another meeting. Let me run it. =C2 moderate it. etc. or if you prefer I m happy to have someone 
e=se in my place, but that person has to present a structure, explain=it. ask questions of everyone. . 
Ron Ba=on wanted to know how to attack his own problem. could i=suggest trusts what types, how should he think 
about leaving it to h=s kidsl =how much, etc the usual. kid questions that each p=rson would celebrate to be able to 
discuss with you. I told hi= I have no time for any new clients. He and his many similarly situa=ed friends are also of the 
age group that need answers NOW. =AO \ 
AT a minimum a " this is how it would work &q=ot; should be presented. Even I was not sure where =the number" 60 
percent of your giving ", came from. 
you are one of the very few people that can think in this area. =AO The leverage is as great as increasing govt spending , 
as it could be i= areas that govt and with structures that govt couldn't/wouldn't d=lve. 
At the breakfast you mentioned 
pri's . but few people =ven know about the idea. 
4-6 people partnering , c=uld be the way to go=/span>. but I think as
