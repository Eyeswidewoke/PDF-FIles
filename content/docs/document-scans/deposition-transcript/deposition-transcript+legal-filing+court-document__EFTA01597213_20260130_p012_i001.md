International Deposit Account Sweep Program 
The Sweep Option for International Accounts is generally the UBS International Deposit 
Account Sweep Program (IDA). The IDA is an interest-bearing account maintained by UBS 
AG at the Cayman Islands Branch where funds are invested into short-term deposits. If 
you are eligible and choose to participate in the IDA sweep program, free cash balances in 
your Accounts are automatically deposited into a demand deposit account at the New York 
Branch of UBS AG, from which funds are then swept and re-deposited each business day 
into an overnight deposit account at the Cayman Islands branch of UBS AG. As your 
agent, UBS Financial Services Inc. will make the necessary withdrawals from the New York 
deposit account to satisfy debits or charges in your Account in accordance with the 
General Terms and Conditions. You may choose to withdraw from the IDA Program at any 
time, however, your free cash balances in your Account at UBS Financial Services Inc. will 
not earn interest or dividends. Funds on deposit in the accounts at the New York and the 
Cayman Islands branches of UBS AG are not eligible for federal deposit insurance from the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).
