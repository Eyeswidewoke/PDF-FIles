I was under shock. That moment you told me you would never speak to me =gain I felt like if I had the whole world 
falling on me and felt totally a=andoned all of a sudden. This horrible feeling was caused because you repr=sent for me a 
stable rock in my chaotic life. I'm not talking only abo=t the financial part which obviously helped me a lot but more 
important yo= turned into a Father, a lover, a mentor, a friend... Everything. I've=isolated myself from all the people that 
surrounded me to follow your dire=tions because spending time with you is what gives me the most happiness. =t that 
moment what else should I have done ? I reacted impulsively because=in that instant everything turned black. I know it 
must be difficult to de=I with a 21-year-old's feelings and I understand you can lose your pat=ence. I wish I would have 
had your wisdom so that I could keep up with you= But I can't. I also thought your promise on the dock was just to 
shut=me up which made me even more sad... and that was even more painful. =/div> 
When I lied to u it was always the consequen=e of my reckless acts. The reason I lie is when I'm scared to deal wit= the 
truth so I make up stories trying to get around your imminent anger o= deception. Obviously it never works and gets 
even worse later--"lies=have short legs"--but this doesn't make me a bad person because i='s never done in a mean way. 
Values are extremely important to me and =oyalty is the one I would never give up for anything. The fact that I 
lied=doesn't take away my values and the fact that I will always be loyal t= you. You told me once you will always be 
there for me just like I will al=ays be there for you... Yes, always. Also when you will get older I will b= there for you and 
that is a promise that I will keep no matter what happe=s... because I care. I really do. 
I know tha= I've let you down so many times, but never so much as I let myself do=n. However, experiencing failure is 
the only way for me to learn and under=tand how to do things right. My moods are very unstable and when I'm d=wn I 
feel paralyzed, closing myself in loneliness... I wish I could change= Maybe speaking with I psychologist would be helpful.
