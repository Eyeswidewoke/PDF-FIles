The German governme=t has always pursued an unwritten rule on its Israel policy, which has alr=ady lasted half a 
century and survived all changes of administrations, and=that former Chancellor Gerhard Schroder summarized in 2002 
when he said: "I want to be very clear: Israel rec=ives what it needs to maintain its security." 
Franz-Josef Strauss=and the Beginnings of Illegal Arms Cooperation 
Those who subscribe=to this logic are often prepared to violate Germany's arms export laws. Ev=r since the era of 
Konrad Adenauer, the country's first postwar leader, Ge=man chancellors have pushed through various military deals 
with Israel without parliamentary approval, kept th= Federal Security Council in the dark or, as then Defense Minister 
Franz-J=sef Strauss, a member of the conservative Christian Social Union (CSU), di=, personally dropped off explosive 
equipment. That was what happened in an incident in the early 1960s, when =trauss drove up to the Israeli mission in 
Cologne in a sedan car and hande= an object wrapped in a coat to a Mossad liaison officer, saying it was &q=ot;for the 
boys in Tel Aviv." It was a new model of an armor-piercing grenade. 
Arms cooperation wa= a delicate issue under every chancellor. During the Cold War, Bonn feared=that it could lose the 
Arab world to East Germany if it openly aligned its=lf with Israel. Later on, Germany was consumed by fears over Arab 
oil, the lubricant of the German economic mira=le. 
Cooperating with Ge=many also had the potential to be politically explosive for the various Is=aeli administrations. 
Whether and in what form the Jewish state should acc=pt Germany's help was a matter of controversy for the Israeli 
public. The later Prime Minister Menachem Begin, for examp=e, who had lost much of his family in the Holocaust, could 
only see German= as the "land of the murderers." To this day, financial assistance for Israel is in most cases referred to 
as "reparations." 
Cooperation on defe=se matters was all the more problematic. It began during the era of Franz-=osef Strauss, who 
recognized early on that aid for Israel wasn't just a mo=al imperative, but was also the result of pragmatic political 
necessity. No one could help the new Germany acquir= international respect more effectively than the survivors of the 
Holocaus=. 
In December 1957, S=rauss met with a small Israeli delegation for a discussion at his home nea= Rosenheim in Bavaria. 
The most prominent member of the Israeli group was =he man who, in the following decades, would become the key 
figure in Israel's arms deals with Germany, as well a= the father of the Israeli atomic bomb: Shimon Peres, who would 
later beco=e Israel's prime minister and is the current Israeli president today, at t=e age of 88. 
No Clear Basis 
It is now known tha= the arms shipments began by no later than 1958. The German defense minist=r even had arms and 
equipment secretly removed from Germany military stock=iles and then reported to the police as stolen. 
Many of the shipmen=s reached Israel via indirect routes and were declared as "loans.&quo=; The equipment included 
Sikorsky helicopters, Noratlas transport aircraft= rebuilt M-48 tanks, anti-aircraft guns, howitzers and anti-tank guided 
missiles. 
There was "no =tear legal or budgetary basis" for the shipments," a German offi=ial admitted in an internal document at 
the time. But Adenauer backed his =efense minister, and in 1967 it became clear how correct he was in making this 
assessment, when Israel preempted an attack by its n=ighbors and achieved a brilliant victory in the Six-Day War. From 
then on,=Strauss's friend Peres consistently reminded his fellow Israelis not to fo=get "what helped us achieve that 
victory." 
The fact that the G=rman security guarantee was not a question of partisan politics became evi=ent six years later, when 
Social Democrat Willy Brandt headed the governme=t in Bonn -- and Israel was on the verge of defeat in the 1973 Yom 
Kippur War. Although Germany was officiall= uninvolved in the war, the chancellor personally approved arms shipments
