Leon, you hire= me to produce a work of art. it was not inexpensive. th= value far exceeds any other piece in your 
collection.- by FAR . =lt took me 30 years to be able to craft such a work. I understand your desire to modifiy my work, 
=C2 in doing so you have brad telling me , just a bit more red., here let me show you,=C2 you yourself pick up a brush 
a add some strokes. you have=joslin spray water on it to maintain it. I vigorously complain that joslin in ruining my 
w=rk .. you describe me as zeus, i describe it as artist and a reaction to his work being ruined. however =m aware 
that you own the work and you have the right to paint over it. tear it up , put it in the closet in the basement . its you=s. 
I was told that Toms office is sending someone in ,or some people in, to review "some things." brad told me ,the 
partnership account=ng. I know absolutely nothing more than that. though bringing in his team was my idea . Having 
them review things without even asking for my input , or let alone my direction ,is ridiculous. but.. I guess you wanted to 
save money.? 
The audit has brought to the fore the lack of your=office quality that i have been violently squawking about. ie . 
=children playing with works of art. . It is inconceivable to me that =AO John castrucci is still there , joslin part time, but 
relied on . =AO joe error prone and brad a corporate bandleader talking abo=t the office's finance team, accounting 
dept, and directing wendy to d= things that are clearly not in your interest. ( saving money ag=in ?) its nuts!! . a still 
non-existent IT dept. impossi=le , it was the first thing on my list of things that were needed to be done. =C2 Still no 
trading accounts to speak of , though its prophylactic quali=y has been discussed over and over during the past three 
years . computers do not read Page Six . the women at the IRS do. ! =AO you said your motivation in keeping this 
group of part timers was = consequence of the high cost of my artwork. . the u=fortunate result was easily 
predictable. - now 
=AO If you want my and my atelier to continue, I will oversee the audits. take charge of the TRA BRH assignments and 
review 2012 amendment options!!( note :your redo of the=20 estate fire drill has not progressed very far ). Lots of
