Dear Keith: 
I am very concerned by your letter, indicating your actions =nd requests, a number of which seem both 
inappropriate and =nprofessional. I understand your shock and concern upon seeing the =uzzfeed story but I believe 
your response was inappropriate for a =umber of reasons. Let me outline them: 
1. In December Buzzfeed contacted my University and me =ith almost everything that was in the story. I 
provided =ounter-evidence including information from ASU and ANU, another =niversity I am affiliated with that 
investigated the Australia =negation. As a result of this I received a note from Buzzfeed =hat they were not publishing 
the story. Buzzfeed continued to =ester my institution for information, but as there was none, and as =ssentially the 
entire story is false ( the counter-evidence we provided =s not included in the story) there was no expectation that a 
story =ould appear. I had in fact related my concerns about Buzzfeed to =achel Bronson in November, which prepared 
her for the slanderous call =he received from them shortly after making false claims and asking why =he allowed me to 
be associated with the Bulletin. She understood that =he allegations were false and had been dealt with. Moreover, a 
lawyer =ho I had contracted because of concerns about Buzzfeed had prepared and =ent a cease and desist letter to 
them to stop their harassment. =e had no expectation that they would publish false stories after being =nformed that 
they were false, and for all of these reasons it would =ave been inappropriate to bring this personal matter up to you or 
your =rganization at the time. 
2. I am very disappointed that you decided to send a letter =o all participants about this without consulting me 
or my staff. This =as unprofessional as well as being discourteous to both me, my Origins =olleagues, the ASU Origins 
Project itself, and all of the =orkshop participants. What you have effectively done is to =ropagate what we believe was 
slander to a broader audience, and without =ny substantiation was extremely inappropriate for you to do in the =ontext 
of your position as a representative of the Stanley Foundation, =ndependent of any personal anger you may felt. It 
would have =een appropriate to consult us first. It is unprofessional to =espond personally in the heat of anger, and any 
decision about this =hould have waited till calmer heads prevailed. 
3. Your reaction regarding the workshop is also =f some concern here. Allegation, and indeed allegation by 
=uzzfeed of all places, is just that. There should not only be a =resumption of innocence but you should note that all 
organizations that =ave looked at these claims, including ASU and the Origins Project, have =ismissed them. ASU was 
aware of all the allegations and chose to take =o action because there was no evidence. I am saddened that you, =n 
behalf of your organization acted so rashly as to email participants, =nd now want to remove Stanley's name from an 
event that everyone =nvolved felt was professional and wonderful and had nothing at all to =o with the Buzzfeed story. 
You are essentially impugning the =rigins Project and ASU because of your concerns about me, valid or =ot. And for your 
information, I have never been accused or found =n violation of sexual harassment regulations by any organization with 
=hich I have been associated. I have not been 'banned'=from universities or institutes, as I informed the Buzzfeed 
reporter =long with documentary evidence. I have never groped, assaulted, =r harassed anyone. 
It =s too late to completely undo some of what has been done, but I would =equest two things.
