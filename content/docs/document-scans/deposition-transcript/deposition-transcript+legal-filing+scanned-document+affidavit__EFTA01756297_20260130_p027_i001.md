</span><span class="MsoHyperlink"><span style="font-size:18.0pt">early =ctober</span></span><span style="font-
size:18.0pt">, prodded by America'r top diplomat Secretary of State John Kerry, Israeli and Palestinian negot=ators 
engaged in a new round of peace 
talks in an attempt to breathe new life into their on-again, off-again eff=rts to bring lasting stability to their relationship. 
To prove successful =nd sustainable, the outcome of these talks must ultimately gain the suppor= of both the Israeli and 
Palestinian 
people. But given the catalytic role Washington has played in this effort =o revive the Middle East peace process, there 
is a third party whose judgment of the outcome may prove crucial: American Jews.

widely held in some parts of the world 
-- that American Jews uniformly back a hardline stance on the Israeli-Pale=tinian issue -- is simply not true. The 5.3 
million-member American Jewish=community is far from monolithic in its emotional attachment to Israel, on=a two-
state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian 
conflict, or on many of the other issues that bedevil the peace process. 1= fact, there are wide differences between 
Orthodox, Conservative, and Reform Jews on many of these concerns. 
</span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:18.0pt">To be sure, more th=n two-thirds (69 percent) of American Jews 
feel some attachment to Israel.=But just 30 percent of Jews feel very attached, and this ranges from 61 pe=cent of the 
Orthodox to 24 percent 
of Reform Jews. Asked whether they trust Israel to make a sincere effort t= achieve peace, though, and things start to 
get more complicated. 
</span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:18.0pt">As for the peace pr=cess, only about four-in-ten American Jews 
(38 percent) think the current =sraeli government is making a sincere effort in negotiations with the Pale=tinians, while 
48 percent say the Israeli 
effort is lacking. But such numbers mask divisions within the American Jew=sh community. Most Orthodox Jews (61 
percent) believe the Israeli governme=t is working to bring about peace with the Palestinians, as do 52 percent =f 
Conservative Jews. But fewer 
Reform Jews (36 percent) agree. </span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:18.0pt">That said, there's =reater consensus among American Jews when 
looking at the other side of the=negotiating table. Three-quarters of respondents think the Palestinian lea=ership's 
efforts to bring about a peace 
settlement with Israel are not sincere. </span></p> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:18.0pt">Clearly, Jewish set=lements in the West Bank are a major point 
of contention in the negotiatio=s. A plurality of American Jews (44 percent) say the continued building of=such 
settlements hurts the security 
of Israel. Just 17 percent say it helps, while 29 percent say it does not =ake a difference. Notably, 50 percent of Reform 
Jews think the settlements=harm the peace process, but only 16 percent of the Orthodox agree. By comp=rison, a 2013
