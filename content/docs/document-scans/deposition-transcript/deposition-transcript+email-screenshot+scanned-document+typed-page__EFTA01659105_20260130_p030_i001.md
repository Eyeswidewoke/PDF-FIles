US Moving Toward Holiday Season As Coronavirus Cases Increase Faster Than Ever. 
The Washington Post (11/23, Fox, 14.2M) reports that the US "is heading into the holiday 
season as coronavirus cases rise at their fastest rate ever." Last week, "more than 150,000 new 
cases were reported each day...and experts worry that indoor gatherings over the Thanksgiving 
holiday will cause case counts to surge even higher." On NBC Nightly NewsVI (11/23, story 7, 
1:40, Holt, 6.1M), Miguel Almaguer reported the US "is on pace to soon hit 200,000 daily 
infections." 
The New York Times (11/23, Smith, 18.61M) says the national daily average of new cases 
"is as high as it has ever been," with nine states "reporting more than twice as many new cases 
a day as they did two weeks ago, and none of them are in the Midwest." According to the 
Times, the increases in Arizona, California, Delaware, Louisiana, Maryland, New Hampshire, 
New Mexico, Pennsylvania, and Vermont "reflect a still-escalating national crisis." In addition, 
the Washington Post (11/23, Farzan, 14.2M) reports the number of coronavirus hospitalizations 
nationwide "shattered records on Monday, topping 85,700," and the Wall Street Journal (11/23, 
Subscription Publication, 7.57M) says Sunday was the 13th straight day of record 
hospitalizations 
Bloomberg (11/23, Querolo, 4.73M) reports according to a model from the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention, COVID-19 "is on track to claim another 30,000 lives by mid-
December," with "weekly cases and deaths both rising every week for the next month." On the 
CBS Evening NewsVi (11/23, story 8, 1:30, Brennan, 4.43M), Margaret Brennan reported 
South Dakota has recorded "more COVID hospitalizations and deaths over the last week per 
capita than anywhere else in the country." David Begnaud added, "Here in Sioux Falls, mask 
wearing is now mandatory, says mayor Paul TenHaken. But there's no enforcement behind it." 
Begnaud added South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem (R) "is against mask mandates, despite the fact 
that per capita, South Dakota leads the world in COVID deaths every day." 
Meanwhile, the Miami Herald (11/23, Marchante, 1.09M) reports Florida's Department of 
Health on Monday "confirmed 6,331 additional cases of COVID-19 as dozens of Florida counties 
have hit a 'tipping point' of infections just a few days before Thanksgiving, according to Harvard 
University data." 
CDC Advises Overwhelmed State, Local Health Departments To Prioritize Contact 
Tracing Efforts As COVID-19 Infections Surge. Politico (11/23, Ollstein, 4.29M) reports, 
"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is advising overwhelmed local health officials 
to triage their coronavirus contact tracing efforts, writing that the latest infection surge is 
making it difficult to reach every close contact of Covid-positive patients in time to help contain 
the disease's spread." The agency in new guidance "said state and local public health 
departments should prioritize contacting people who tested positive for Covid-19 within the last 
six days, members of their immediate household, the elderly and people with health conditions 
that make them more vulnerable to the virus, and people who live or work in congregate 
settings like nursing homes and prisons, where the virus has spread rapidly." 
California Governor Quarantining After Children Exposed To Infected Police 
Officer. Politico (11/23, Staff, 4.29M) reports California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) and his 
family "are quarantining for 14 days after learning three of their children were exposed to a 
California Highway Patrol officer who has tested positive for Covid-19." Newsom and his family 
"tested negative Sunday for coronavirus" after he "learned of the CHP exposure during the 'late 
evening' Friday." 
Airline Travel Surges Despite Guidance Against Holiday Travel. 
The Washington Post (11/23, McMahon, 14.2M) reports the Transportation Security 
Administration "recorded its highest number of weekend passengers since the coronavirus 
pandemic began in March, with over 3 million people traveling in the past three days." The 
spike "comes despite Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance advising against 
Thanksgiving travel because of mounting covid-19 cases across the nation." Reuters (11/23,
