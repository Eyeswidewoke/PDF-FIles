Jeffrey, 
Oh!, I'll be tough on her, I'll blind cc you on my big response tomorrow,. 
This is the story she sent me: 
Hi, Captain! 
How was Europe? J said you were coming back home today. Did you hear about my crazy flight 
last night? 
So one of the cross country guys I flew with at school had to deliver a C172 from Tulsa to 
Miami to someone who just bought it and he offered me to fly it from the right seat and log a 
lot of free flight time in a day. So I went to Tulsa yesterday morning to pick it up. The plane 
was old and even though it just came out of maintenance that day, the alternator 
malfunctioned and failed on our last leg in the middle of the night somewhere over the 
Everglades. 
After a few uneventful legs during the day, we took off with full tanks at Tallahassee yesterday 
evening. We planned to top off again in Gainesville so we make it to KOPF with a nice 
reserve. But GNV weather deteriorated quickly after we took off and went to 400ceilings. The 
other guy was flying this leg and wanted to shoot an approach and try landing. We went to 
minimums, didn't break out of the clouds, went missed and decided to leave and continue on 
our way south. He wanted to just keep going all the way to Opa Locka. There was a good 
chance we would have had enough fuel but the reserve would have been questionable. I was 
getting uncomfortable, little tired, weather was ifr, I was in the right seat of strange old single 
engine plane in the middle of the night thinking about our trip starting to sound like a 
beginning of one of my crash book stories, so I told him I wanted to stop somewhere anyway 
and refuel first. He let me get the controls and take it into Lakeland to top off again and I am 
glad we did. Thinking back, we probably should have stopped there for the night.. 
Maybe an hour after leaving KLAL, in level flight, without warning, the whole plane just went 
dark. I was flying, we were on ifr flight plan when we lost all coins, lights, transponder, 
everything electrical.. the circuit breaker was tripped so we reset it once, had enough time to 
tell center what was going on and they told us to keep going to KOPF, descend at our 
discretion if we lost everything again, do an ILS to 30 and then call them to cancel ifr. We lost 
it again. He brought his Garmin 696 so we used that to navigate. What a lifesaver, I think now 
I really need to get one :) 
I was trying to decide whether to keep the controls for the approach or give to the other guy. I 
thought be knew how to work his 696 better and could set me up but he wasn't doing so well 
with the stress so I kept flying from my scat and had him shine a light on my instruments and 
work the gps. Weather was not too bad but still ifr with 700ceilings in Opa Locka. We were
