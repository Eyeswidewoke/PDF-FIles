For the purposes of the Purchase Agreement, a "Superior Proposal" means a bona fide written Alternative 
Acquisition Proposal that is binding (subject only to the valid termination of the Purchase Agreement) on the 
offeror. that did not result from a breach of Mobileye's non-solicitation obligations and that the Mobileye Board 
has determined in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors), taking into 
account all legal. financial, regulatory. financing. certainty, timing, and other relevant aspects of the proposal. 
and the person making the proposal: 
provides for a purchase price per Share in cash that is at least $6.354 higher than the Offer 
Consideration: 
• is more favorable to Mobileye and its shareholders, employees and other stakeholders than the 
transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement: 
• is reasonably likely to be consummated; and 
• to the extent third party financing is required, such financing is then fully committed. 
For purposes of the definition of "Superior Proposal." each reference in the definition of "Alternative 
Acquisition Proposal" to "20%" will be deemed to be a reference to -50%."

indirectly: 
(a) withhold, withdraw, qualify, amend or modify. or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, qualify.

Mobileye disclosure documents, the approval. adoption, recommendation. or declaration of advisability 
by the Mobileye Board or any committee thereof, of the Purchase Agreement of the Offer or any of the 
other transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement, or make any public statement inconsistent 
with the Mobileye Board Recommendation; 
(b) recommend, adopt or approve, or propose publicly to recommend, adopt or approve, any Alternative 
Acquisition Proposal: or 
(c) publicly make any recommendation in connection with an Alternative Acquisition Proposal other than 
a recommendation against such proposal; 
(any action described in clauses (a) through (c) above, an "Adverse Recommendation Change"). 
In addition. Mobileye has agreed that neither the Mobileye Board, nor any committee of the Mobileye 
Board, will directly or indirectly, approve or recommend. or publicly propose to approve or recommend. or allow 
Mobikye or any of its affiliates to execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, 
agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement. option agreement. joint venture agreement, 
partnership agreement. or other similar contract (other than a confidentiality agreement pursuant to the no 
solicitation covenant) (a) relating to any Alternative Acquisition Proposal or any offer or proposal that would 
reasonably be expected to lead to an Alternative Acquisition Proposal or (b) requiring it (or that would require it) 
to abandon, terminate, or fail to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement. 
Solely in response to a Superior Proposal received after the date of the Purchase Agreement, the Mobileye 
Board may, at any time prior to the Expiration Time, make an Adverse Recommendation Change or validly 
terminate the Purchase Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal or 
authorize, resolve, agree, or publicly propose to take any such action, only if all of the following conditions are
