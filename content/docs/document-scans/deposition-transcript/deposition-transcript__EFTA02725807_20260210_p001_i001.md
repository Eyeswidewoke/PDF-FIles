A. No. 
3 
Q. It's my understanding that C. and T. 
4 
either came to his house alone to visit with Mr. 
5 
Epstein or brought other girls in their age group 
6 
to Mr. Epstein. 
7 
Were you familiar with that type of 
8 
recruitment process of girls bringing other girls? 
9 
MR. CRITTON: Form. 
10 
THE WITNESS: Yes. 
11 BY MR. EDWARDS: 
12 
Q. Can you tell me more about what you know 
13 about girls bringing other girls that are 
14 
relatively the same age to come to Jeffrey 
15 Epstein's house and to use your words, have a good 
16 time? 
17 
MR. CRTITON: Form. 
18 
THE WITNESS: It's hard to know who they 
19 
knew. But I think that was -- they feel 
20 
better themselves when they're in a group 
21 
than going by themselves, but I don't know 
22 
somebody recruiting. 
23 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
24 
Q. Okay. And you've talked about, at least 
25 
referred to yourself I believe to the police and

for now we'll call it a massage -- as well as 
anybody who brought that person over to the house, 
they would both get paid cash. Are you familiar 
with that? 
MR. CRITTON: Form. 
THE WITNESS: No. 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
Q. If C. brought another girl over to the 
house and C. stayed downstairs but this other girl 
went upstairs with Mr. Epstein, which one would 
you pay? 
A. I don't know because I was told who to 
pay. 
Q. And 
always told you? 
A. 
told me pay so and so. 
Q. So if we were going to ask anybody else 
about the exact method in terms of who would get 
paid and for what, who would the people be? I 
mean, other than Mr. Epstein who else could we ask 
these 
• ns? 
A. 
Q. 
A. Yes. 
Q. She would know this? 
A. Yes.

1 as well today as a human ATM machine. Right? 
2 
MR. CRITTON: Form. 
3 
THE WITNESS: Something like that. I was 
4 
supposed to carry cash at all times. 
5 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
6 
Q. One of the primary reasons why you 
7 
carried cash was to pay the girls in this age 
8 
group of C. and T. for whatever happened at the 
9 
house. Right? 
10 
MR. CRITTON: Form. 
11 
THE WITNESS: Yes. 
12 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
13 
Q. That's a fair statement. Right? 
14 
MR. CRITTON: Form. 
15 
THE WITNESS: Yes. 
16 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
17 
Q. Okay. And when C., let's use her for 
18 example, would bring somebody else to the house, 
19 did you pay C. as well as whomever she brought to 
20 the house, pay them both? 
21 
A. No, I pay only one person, 
22 
Q. Okay. My understanding, and tell me if 
23 
this is wrong or you can corroborate this, is that 
24 Mr. Epstein would pay the girl that was actually 
25 
performing whatever was happening in the room --

Q. What about Ghislaine Maxwell? 
2 
MR. CRITTON: Form. 
3 
THE WITNESS: You're talking about the 
4 
boss. I don't know. 
5 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
6 
Q. To your knowledge was Ghislaine Maxwell 
7 
aware of these girls that are in the age group of 
8 
C. and T. coming to Jeffrey Epstein's house to 
9 
have a good time? 
10 
MR. CRITTON: Form. 
11 
THE WITNESS: I have to say something. 
12 
Mrs. Maxwell called me and told me not to 
13 
ever discuss or contact her again in a 
14 
threaten way. 
15 
BY MR. EDWARDS: 
16 
Q. When was this? 
17 
A. Right after I left because I call one of 
18 the friends for a job and she told me this, but, 
19 you know, I feel intimidated and so I want to keep 
20 her out. 
21 
Q. What exactly did she say? First of all, 
22 was this a telephone call? 
23 
A. Yes, she was in New York. 
24 
Q. She called you on your cell phone? 
25 
A. Yes.
