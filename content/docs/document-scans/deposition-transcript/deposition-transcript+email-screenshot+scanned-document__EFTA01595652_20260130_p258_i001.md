When making a verbal inquiry, the Bank may ask that you send us your complaint in 
writing within ten (10) business days after the first telephone call. 
We will investigate your complaint and will correct any error promptly. If we take more 
than ten (10) business days to do this, we will credit your account for the 
amount you think is in error, so that you have the use of the money during the time it 
takes to complete our investigation. 
INTEREST NOTICE 
Total interest credited by the Bank to you this year will be reported by the Bank to the 
Internal Revenue Service and State tax authorities. The amount to be reported will be 
reported separately to you by the Bank.

If you think your bill is wrong, or if you need more information about a transaction on 
your bill, write us at P.O. Box 1377, Lewiston, Maine 04243-1377 as soon as 
possible. We must hear from you no later than sixty (60) days after wesent you the 
FIRST bill on which the error or problem appeared. You can telephone us, but doing 
so will not preserve your rights. In your letter, give us the following information: 
- Your name and account number.

- Describe the error and explain, if you can, why you believe there is an error. 
If you need more information, describe the item you are unsure about. 
You do not have to pay any amount in question while we are investigating, but you 
are still obligated to pay the parts of your bill that are not in question. While we 
investigate your question, we cannot report you as delinquent or take any action to 
collect the amount you question. 
FINANCE CHARGES: Although the Bank uses the Daily Balance method to calculate 
the finance charge on your Moneyline/Overdraft Protection account (the term "ODP" 
or "OD" refers to Overdraft Protection), the Bank discloses the Average Daily Balance 
on the periodic statement as an easier method for you to calculate the finance 
charge. The finance charge begins to accrue on the date advances and other debits 
are posted to your account and will continue until the balance has been paid in full. 
To compute the finance charge, multiply the Average Daily Balance times the Days in 
Period times the Daily Periodic Rate (as listed in the Account Summary section on 
the front of the statement). The Average Daily Balance is calculated by adding the 
balance for each day of the billing cycle, then dividing the total balance by the number 
of Days in the Billing Cycle. The daily balance is the balance for the day after 
advances have been added and payments or credits have been subtracted plus or 
minus any other adjustments that might have occurred that day. There is no grace 
period during which no finance charge accrues. Finance charge adjustments are 
included in your total finance charge.
