Jeffrey, I miss understood. When I arrived at=the hotel I really thought I had to leave my luggage in his room. I also 
c=lled him to ask if it was ok for him and I passed him the girl at the rece=tion so he could confirm to her as well. Why 
didn't he say no to me or=her ? Then I admit it's not very polite to take a shower in someo=e else room but I really 
needed it ( I didn't want to smell like =he plane ) and since he wasn't there I took the occasion to take = quick one. I 
don't see nothing wrong or suspicious about doing t=is exept the fact that it is not polite and well-mannered. Then, 
when=he arrived in the room I was about to leave so I was dressed and the =athroom was completly in order. I told him I 
took a shower and that's =t. You can tell him I am really sorry about it and I apo=ogize for this again.
