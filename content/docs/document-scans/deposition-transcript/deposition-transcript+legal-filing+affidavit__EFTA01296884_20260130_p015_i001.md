United States Courts Opinions: Supreme Court of New York: Neary v Burns US Official 
News April 1, 2014 Tuesday 
interest and Benevento's beneficial membership in 2784 LLC and [*9]their rights to receive 
such distributions. 
Notably, in the December 15, 2010 decision and order in the Neptune Avenue action, 
Justice Partnow previously acknowledged that Neary is a member of Neptune LLC and 
that Benevento has a beneficial interest in Neptune LLC. Burns. in his attorney's 
affirmation, has admitted that both Neptune LLC and 2784 LLC "have identical members 
with only a slight difference in percentage ownership." Therefore, it follows that Neary is a 
member of 2784 LLC in his own right in the same way that he is a member of Neptune 
LLC, and that Benevento holds a beneficial interest in 2784 LLC in his own right in the 
same way that he holds a beneficial interest in Neptune LLC. 
Thus, Neary and Benevento do not lack standing to maintain this action. Dismissal of this 
action, pursuant to CPLR 3211 (a) (3), must, therefore, be denied. 
Burns further contends that plaintiffs have failed to join the other members of 2784 LLC 
and that, therefore, this action must be dismissed, pursuant to CPLR 3211 (a) (10), which 
provides for the granting of dismissal of a claim against a party based upon the ground that 
"the court should not proceed in the absence of a person who should be a party." 
This contention by Burns is devoid of merit since plaintiffs' second amended complaint 
asserts direct claims by plaintiffs to recover for distinct injuries that they individually 
sustained by Burns' alleged wrongful withholding of their proportionate share of 
distributions of the net proceeds from the sale of the 2784 premises. Plaintiffs are thus 
alleging claims based upon the breach of a duty owed directly to them, independent of any 
duty owed to 2784 LLC or any of its other members (see generally Abrams v Donati, 66 
NY2d 951, 953 [1985], rearg denied 67 NY2d 758 [1986]; Behrens v Metropolitan Opera 
Assn., Inc., 18 AD3d 47, 50 (1st Dept 2005]; Lawrence Ins. Group, Inc. v KPMG Peat 
Marwick LLP, 5 AD3d 918, 919 [3rd Dept 2004]). Plaintiffs do not seek to recover any 
sums that may be due to the other members of 2784 LLC or for any damage to 2784 LLC. 
Plaintiffs' claims relate only to their own direct claims as against Burns and 2784 LLC and, 
as a result, do not require the joinder of the other members of 2784 LLC. Consequently, 
dismissal of plaintiffs' action for failure to join necessary parties must be denied. 
Burns also contends that this action must be dismissed, pursuant to CPLR 3211 (a) (7), 
based upon plaintiffs' failure to state a cause of action. "It is well settled that, as a general 
rule, on a motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a cause of action under CPLR 
3211 (a) (7), the complaint must be construed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff" 
(Gruen v County of Suffolk, 187 AD2d 560, 562 [2d Dept 1992]; see also Rosen v 
Watermill Dev. Corp., 1 AD3d 424, 425 [2d Dept 2003]), and the pleading is to be afforded 
a liberal construction (CPLR 3026). The court must also accept the facts as alleged in the 
complaint and submissions in opposition to the motion as true and accord the plaintiff "the 
benefit of every possible favorable inference" (Sokoloff v Harriman Estates Dev. Corp., 96 
NY2d 409. 414 [2001]; see also Thomas v LaSalle Bank N.A., 79 [*10]AD3d 1015, 1017 
[2d Dept 2010]). The court, in accepting the facts alleged in the complaint to be true, must 
" determine only whether the facts alleged fit within any cognizable legal theory"' (Ruffino v 
New York City Tr. Auth., 55 AD3d 817, 818 [2d Dept 2008], quoting Morris v Morris, 306 
AD2d 449, 451 [2d Dept 2003]; see also Hurrell-Harring v State of New York, 15 NY3d 8, 
20 [2010]; Goldman v Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 5 NY3d 561, 570-571 [2005]).
