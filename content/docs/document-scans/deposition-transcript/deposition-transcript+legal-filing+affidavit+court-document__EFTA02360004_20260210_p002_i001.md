This is a=draft of the certified letter to Mr. Diaz that Darren wrote with my minor =dits. Please let me 
know if this is fine to send to him. 
clear="none"> 
Dear Mr. Diaz: 
&n=sp; 
As I emailed you on Friday, April 8, 2016, I repeatedly called you all last we=k, leaving 
you numerous voice mail messages, as well as messages with your administrative assistant. Failing to receive any 
response, I also left a message for Mr. Jeffers and requested t=at that he forward that message to you. Mr. Jeffers has 
subsequently confirmed that he passed on the message however, you have yet to respond. Consequently, I am writing 
this letter to formally demand the immediate return to LSJE, LLC of $114,540.53 previou=ly paid to and unlawfully 
retained by Better Roads for work that has never bee= performed by Better Roads on Little St. James. 
&n=sp; 
No representative of LSJE, LLC or Little St. James has ever signed any written agreement 
entitling Better Roads to charge any cancellation fee for work th=t has not been performed on Little St. James; nor has 
Better Roads at any tim= ever presented any representative of LSJE, LLC or Little St. James with a proposed contract that 
provides for the payment to Better Roads of such a cancellation fee. Moreover, no Better Roads representative has ever 
previously advised any representative of LSJE= LLC or Little St. James, either verbally or in writing, of any such 
cancellation fee, and there is simply no applicable statute or rule of law =hat authorizes Better Roads to charge or retain 
any such a cancellation fee. Better Roads' attempts to retain $76,875 as a cancellation fee, in addition to the $56,292.80 
which it asserts as its cos=s on a project that it barely commenced and never completed, are therefore completely 
unlawful and entirely improper. 
&n=sp; 
In the hopes of amicably resolving any disagreements between Better Roads and LSJE, 
LLC, the assertion by Better Roads that it has expended $56,292.80 on work performed on Little St. James to date has 
not as yet been challenged b= LSJE, LLC. However, should Better Roads refuse to return the remaining $114,540.53 of 
the total $170,833.33 which L=JE, LLC previously paid it, then LSJE, LLC shall have no choice but to pursue Better Roads 
legally for all moneys previously paid to Better Roads.&=bsp; In that event, Better Roads will surely expend will in excess 
of $76,875 and face the loss of the additional $56,292.80 it=has retained in a futile effort to hold onto a cancellation fee 
for which there=is absolutely no contractual or legal support whatsoever. 
&n=sp; 
As I stated in my email to you, we are very disappointed with how this transac=ion has 
been handled to date, but are providing you with a last effort to see r=ason and settle this matter amicably. Please 
respond immediately confirming that you will promptly refund $114,540.53 of=the $160,833.33 deposit which LSJE, LLC 
previously paid to you, or I will have =o choice but to turn this matter over to LSJE, LLC's. I sincerely hope that it will not 
be necessary to escalate this matter further.
