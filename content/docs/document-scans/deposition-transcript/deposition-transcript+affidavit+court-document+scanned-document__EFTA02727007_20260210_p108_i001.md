Focus of Session 
Inmate Epstein was seen by this writer this morning while on psychological observation in the hospital area of the 
prison. 
Subjective/Objective Presentation 
Inmate Epstein was in good spirits today and engaged in redprocal conversation with this writer this morning. He 
smiled and remarked, "welcome back" when this writer arrived. He continues to assert he does not remember how he 
received marks around his neck, remarking "I do not remember anything, maybe you can give me some cues" He 
stated he just remembers going for a drink of water and the next thing he knew he woke up to the sound of his own 
snoring. When this writer attempted to get a more detailed account from him, indicating that it would be rare to have 
such impairments in memory as he does not suffer from an acute cognitive disorder, he smiled and said he understood 
my position. 
Inmate Epstein did reveal he is unhappy with his current confinement in Special Housing (SHU) as he considers it "a 
punishment cell." He said he finds the restrictions up there unfair as he has not done anything wrong. Inmate Epstein 
stated he feels it is dangerous in the SHU, he cannot sleep well up there due to noise from the other inmates, it smells, 
and it is difficult for him to work on his legal case up there. He stated he has not received the phone calls he was 
promised nor has he been able to receive recreation. It was explained to him that he spends the entire day in the 
attorney conference room and it is likely that he has missed the times when staff members have attempted to give him 
phone calls and recreation. Inmate Epstein also reported complaints about the attorney conference room, stating they 
do not take him to the bathroom frequently enough. 
Inmate Epstein adamantly denied any suicidality at this time, stating "I am too vested in my case to fight it; I have a life 
and I want to go back to living my life." He denied any acute symptoms at this time. 
According to his log bcok, he has been eating, drinking, sleeping, and interacting with the inmate companions. He has 
also been attending his daily legal visits. 
InterventionN)
Inmate EPSTEIN was provided with brief supportive interventions and psychoeducation regarding additional coping 
strategies. Inmate EPSTEIN was mostly receptive to these interventions. He requested to be housed in general 
population rather than the SHU and stated he wanted to remain on psychological observation due to his concerns with 
being in the SHU. 
Emgrtss/Plan 
In an abundance of caution, inmate Epstein will remain on psychological observation. He has yet to give an account of 
how he sustained the marks around his neck, is not revealing much about his mental status, and there are concerns 
about his adjustment at this time to being housed in the SHU. Inmate Epstein will be seen daily by psychology whiIe on 
psychological observation.
