Fwd: Marital Trusts

I would like to renew my request that you arrange for Max to resign as trustee for the marital trusts, and 
expeditiously, for reasons I will expla=n below. 
> > 
I have already spelled out some of the reasons why I cannot trust Max. =AO I hope you have read those detailed 
letters, which only tell part of the story, though it was more then enough. By now the situation has becom= completely 
intolerable. 
During the years when Max was serving as my lawyer, he saw no problem when the IRA that is my source of 
income was being depleted by distributions to 10 family members -- which alone amounted to half of the mandatory 
withd=awals -- along with payment of taxes and management fees for the entire estate.=C2 All of that exhausted the 
annual withdrawal, and the IRA was exhausted further by payments for the Wellfleet house, Alex's medical expenses, 
a=d others that you know about, compelling me to make further withdrawals just for ordinary daily expenses, and 
imposing the exorbitant taxes charged for such withdrawals. Max saw no problem with that. He never suggested any 
financial accounting from any of the beneficiaries. I trusted him, mistakenly, as in the case of the purchase of the 
apartment and the outlandish loan from the marital trust, which I assumed would be for a few weeks until the Lexington 
house was sold, not realizing -- though he surely did -- that I would receive nothing for that and would be stuck with an 
expensive apartment I could not possibly afford and a loan that I never would have agreed to had I understood. 
Now, all of a sudden, everything has changed. Suddenly, Max has all sorts of scruples and legalistic demands. 
What caused the sudden change? It is because now I am requesting that taxes be paid by the marital trust. For the first 
time, Max insists on extensive (and of course outrageous) financial surveillance, claiming that as trustee, he is concerned 
with life expectancy (I might live too long) and with the long-term effect on the trust -- matters that never concerned 
him while he watched my IRA being depleted with payment of taxes and management fees for the entire estate, in 
addition to distributions to family. No scruples, no concerns, all fine as long as it was rapidly depleting my source of 
income. 
To make this even more outrageous, the marital trust is, of course, intende= for the use of the married couple 
who established it, to be their main resource during their lifetimes, and the lifetime of the surviving spouse.=C2 That is 
the obvious intention of a marital trust, and that should end the matter, within a family. But it is even true of the 
wording, if we have to descend to legalities. Not just for taxes, which is what I am requesting, but for daily life.
