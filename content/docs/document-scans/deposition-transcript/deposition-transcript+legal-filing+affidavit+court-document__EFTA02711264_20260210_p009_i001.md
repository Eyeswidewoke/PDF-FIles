is real is in the operations of the brain. The individual experience, the private experience, the personal experience: illusion. 
The end of the individual. 
Man concerned himself with meaning. His books, plays, movies, television programs, were considered only in terms of what 
they had to say, what they had to communicate in ideas. But experience was itself the communication, what the brain did. 
Man was oblivious to these changes. A story was a storya"complete with plots, morals, points of view, and ultimate 
meaningseto fit within preestablished value systems. Considerations of story on the neural level are another story. Recent 
research has shown that seethe pans of the brain from which memories are evoked so easily and regularly arc those we find 
most liable to exaggerated electrical discharge during flicker, and it is here too that in normal subjects the pattern of incoming 
stimuli can be seen abstracted and preserved for some time after the stimulation has ceased:Er 
The movie experience is a flicker experience of a frequency of twenty-four times per second, slightly higher and safer than the 
level considered dangerous for certain brains. The reflection of projected light from a treated surface, a surface encompassing 
up to eighty percent of the visual field, can have the effect on the neural level of an electronic brain message. Where is the 
meaning when we realize the emotional response is a function of the flicker experience reactivating memory imprints stored in 
the operant circuits of the brain? The implications of such a hypothesis are obvious. How can we merely discuss ace' like it / I 
donaTMt like its without reference to questions about the brainfiTMs activity, a universe without lam's. 
Neural energy is not produced by the major receptors for sensory stimuli. The sources for neural energy are the gravitational 
receptors, the stretchingtype muscles. ficeThe visual receptors, bringing in up to two-thirds of the sensory stimuli for the 
brain, are useless as a source of neural energy.a45 In this light, look to the transaction between the environmental force and 
the organism in terms of the information provided to the brain. The visual receptors tend to pick up light as motion. ficeThe 
human eye has economically confined its best form and color vision to a relatively small fovea, while its perception of motion 
is better on the periphery. When peripheral vision has picked up some object conspicuous by brilliancy or light contrast or 
color, or above all by motion, there is reflex feedback to bring it into the fovea. . . . We tend to bring any object that attracts 
our attention into a standard position and orientation, so that the visual image which we form of it varies within as small a 
range as possible.a* 
Consider the motion-picture experience not in terms of the images of the movie, but the motion of the flickering light, the 
flashing on and off, twentyfour times per second. A relationship can be established between the information this experience 
provides for the brain and the production of new quanta of neural energy. Unlike the usual situation where the eye scans one 
hundred percent of the visual field, picks up motion, and brings it into the fovea, the light as motion of the movie experience 
can encompass up to eighty percent of the visual field. The normal reflex feedback, bringing the movement into the fovea, is 
not possible, as the outer muscles are locked into a pattern of stretching activity quite unlike any other performed in the daily 
routine of contemporary life. The information from this experience is measured by what the brain does to adjust to the 
change. In this case there is every reason to speculate that the experience will provide a potent source of neural energy. The 
source is not in what the eye secs, but in what the eye is doing: the stretching of the muscles, the gravitational receptors, 
providing information for the brain. 
These speculations on the relationship of the environmental force and the activity integrated on the neural level raise an 
interesting question. Going beyond the nonexistent linear construct of movie and into the direct experience of the brain, we 
can easily see that the very same movie, experienced in two different theaters, can provide the brain with significantly 
different information. Sitting to the rear of a theater with a postage-stamp screen will expose only about five to ten percent of 
the visual field to light as motion. Sitting in the first few rows of a seventy mm. theater will expose up to eighty percent of the 
visual field to light as motion. It appears obvious that the latter experience would be more intense on the neural level. But 
man, the nonexistent linear construct, could not get past the level of ficeWhat did it saynt aceWas it good% or aceWas it bad?fi 
His mind saw a movie; the experience in the present changed the way the brain worked.
