Preserving priority 
Once the Origin<=em> was published, botany became the central focus of Darwin's researc= for the remaining years of 
his life. This botanical work was highly original, not only because of the quality of his observations, but because it was 
the first attempt to apply the principles of evolution to plants. 
Darwin's crucial contribution to b=tany was his understanding of and ability to demonstrate that the flower is a product 
of evolution. By the 18th century, botanists were convinced that flowering plants have both male and female parts, and 
assumed that most plants self fertilise or inbreed. This erroneous and deeply ingrained view of the flower continued 
until Darwin began publishing on the biological meaning of flowers in the 1860s. The prevalence of cross-pollination was 
Darwin's single most important botanical trut=. 
Indeed Darwin realised there was a problem with plant sex immediately after discovering natural selection in 1838. If 
flowers perpetually self fertilised then both natural selection and evolution would be invalid, because natural selection 
requires hereditary variation. If there is no variation, there is simply nothing to select. Evolution stops. If flowers self 
fertilised for generation after generation, they would become unvarying clones. Furthermore, without variation, where 
did the thousands of known plant species come from? Evolution would not explain the diverse families of flowering 
plant genera and species. The world =99s flowers were just too big a part of nature for Darwin to forfeit them to the 
creationist position that species are immutable. 
In the case of flowers, he undertook decades of field and garden observations and breeding experiments, all focused on 
testing and supporting one powerful hypothesis: that of natural selection. 
Through his painstaking studies, such as the Primula =xample below, Darwin discovered that flowering plants have 
evolved elaborate structures, strategies, and relations with animals and reasoned that it was all to avoid the apparent 
necessity of perpetual inbreeding. Thus the Darwinian meaning of flowers became a pillar of botany and botany became 
one of the strongest fields supporting evolution. 
Love, Primu=a style 
Spring 1860 was the first flowering seaso= following Origin's publication. Darwin, bursting with experimental energy, 
made several crucial botanical discoveries. In May, he observed two different kinds of flowers among common primulas. 
The style, or shaft of the female part, is either tall, protruding like a pin, or it is short. Darwin's chi=dren gathered 
armloads of flowers for their father, who noticed something: The two kinds of flower occur in a 50:50 ratio. To explain 
these two morphs, Darwin would follow the scientific method, but after his very own personal style. At first, the 50:50 
ratio reminded him of a normal male-female sex ratio. So he believed the two kinds of flowers were evolving into 
separate sexes. That is, he thought he had witnessed one step in the evolution of separate male and female flowers. The 
tall-style flowers must be evolving into pure females, he surmised. Conversely, their short stamens must be losing 
potency. To test this he crossed the two forms. But to his surprise, the 'males' pro=uced abundant seeds. So the 
experimental method forced him to abandon his first hypothesis. As Darwin once observed, his first explanations of 
things frequently proved wrong. The originality and breakthrough would come with thinking up the next explanation. 
He now realised that the maximum fertility occurs when pollen moves from one form to the other. It was always the self 
fertilised flowers that had reduced fertility. Thus the two forms, each of which is both male and female, are favoured to 
maintain a stable population. Darwin had in fact discovered a breeding strategy that gave a clear advantage to cross-
pollination and thus provided experimental support for his long-held interpretation of the meaning of flowers. To think 
of flowers in terms of plant breeding strategies, now that is evolutionary botany. And Darwin's primulas have been a 
prime example of this new way of=20 thinking ever since.
