sue if they didn't go along with it. We also should point out that all of Epstein's lawyers are well aware that our 
Office has been sued by two victims for failing to keep them informed about the investigation. We have an 
obligation to inform all of the victims upon Epstein's release. This obviously puts us in a very bad situation. 
When we met with Colonel 
at PBSO, I specifically asked him to keep me informed when/if Epstein was 
being released so I could inform all 31 victims. Goldberger kept that from happening. Up until now, we have 
been willing to lay the blame at Goldberger's feet rather than impute it to Epstein. But I think the time has come 
to raise it with Roy and let him know that we will no longer take that approach. 
I anticipate that they will ask for some sort of compromise, pointing out that Epstein would have been eligible 
for placement in a halfway house if he had been sentenced federally. Of course, as 
points out, he never 
would have received an 18-month sentence if he had been sentenced federally, so this is a moot point. 
Nevertheless, in the interests of complete preparation, I contacted someone at BOP to ask about how work 
release would be applied in this situation. I learned that, in light of his short sentence, Epstein would have been 
eligible for placement in a half-way house, which includes the opportunity to work outside the facility, six 
months prior to his projected release date. If Epstein were doing federal time, his projected release date would 
be early October, 2009. According to the documents in Epstein's work release file (which 
got from 
PBSO), his projected release date is September 24, 2009. March 24, 2009 is six months prior to that. In the 
federal system, Epstein would never be allowed to engage in the type of work that he currently is doing and he 
would not be allowed to work more than 40 hours per week. For example, Epstein lists himself as "president" of 
the Florida Science Foundation and lists his supervisor as the "Vice President," Darren Indyke. (Indyke was a 
subject of our investigation and refused to comply with a grand jury subpoena, by the way.) Indyke is located in 
New York and does not work here in Florida. So PBSO is letting Epstein work completely unsupervised. The 
feds would never allow that. 
The documents submitted to PBSO in support of the work release are also rife with misstatements. For example, 
it lists Richard Kahn as one of the directors. Richard Kahn is a partner at Sullivan & Cromwell in New York, but 
the listed phone number is Jack Goldberger's firm. It says that Epstein earned $250,000 last year for his work 
for the Florida Science Foundation. (The Florida Science Foundation is really the "C.O.U.Q. Foundation, Inc., 
d/b/a the Florida Science Foundation.") IRS documents filed by COUQ show that Epstein was earning "$0 per 
year" for his work for the foundation, which was only 1 hour per year. 
Anticipating that you might be willing to consider a compromise, I have attached a proposed Second Addendum 
to the Non-Prosecution Agreement. I also have attached the letter allegedly sent by Alex that shows Alex's 
acceptance of the work release program. As I suspected, it was a draft victim notification letter that they 
objected to and was never sent out. The language comes directly from Fl. State. 944.605. 
And my e-mail to Colonel 
made clear that we could not decide for him regarding an application for work 
release, that it remained within his discretion.
