</=iv> 
Thank you for sending the email from Neil T=rok. We have raised this with the 
Perimeter Institute, which has clarified=its position, as follows: 
During the event, a sexual haras=ment complaint was filed with the 
administration against you. 
In 2012, as part of a formal review of it= internal policies, the institute 
made a decision that you would not be in=ited to return. 
=div> 
I believe this final claim is fal=e, and I would like confirmation from you. It may be a 
fine point, but I b=lieve it is important. Originally Michael informed me immediately af=er the event in 2009 that there 
was a complaint of inappropriate com=unication with one of the staff--something I still dispute--but be that as=it may, 
he informed me by email that I shoudn't communicate with t=e staff I had interacted with at the time, and the matter 
was then conside=ed closed. Several years later I was invited to give another public=lecture but your outreach 
coordinator later rescinded the invitation, alth=ugh I was reimbursed for that. As you are aware, I subsequently 
disc=ssed my concern about this with Neil in Vancouver in that year, and inquir=d about exactly what it was all about, 
and informed him that either a form=l procedure to resolve any issue in which I could participate and respond =ight be 
appropriate, or the matter should be dropped. Neil said he would e=plore the matter, and neither he, nor anyone else, 
ever contacted me follo=ing that. I have never been informed of anything like Buzzfeed has =laimed. Indeed I have 
been invited back to Perimeter for scientific meetin=s by various colleagues in the intervening years. I would fin= it 
highly irregular if any formal procedure took place with such an outco=e without my knowledge or without any due 
process, and without subsequentl= informing me, and all evidence I have suggests the contrary. 
=div> 
I am very concerned by this claim below, for obvious re=sons. First, the original 
Perimeter source provided false and defama=ory information to Buzzfeed, changing a story only after I provided 
counte=-evidence. 
The accurate history if there is one, is that the=e was a complaint from someone at Perimeter 
about inappropriate communicat=on and that 3 years later a decision was made by the outreach coordi=ator, perhaps 
in collaboration with others, not to invite me back at that =ime for a public lecture. I would like to have your confirm for 
me t=at Buzzfeed's claim is incorrect a it stands I would prefer =o leave it at that, but if necessary one could add that 
there was a report=of inappropriate communication with an employee at the event at the time, =hich I disputed and the 
matter was closed. 
Please=confirm my understanding of this issue for me if you will. As you ca= imagine, 
making this public is embarrassing for me, Buzzfeed has tr=ed, at every turn, to misrepresent facts in the worst possible 
light, it i= important for me to not allow them to continue to do this with impunity.=C2* For example, they contacted 
my university and asked if there any cla=ms fo sexual harassment against me, and though the University explicitly 
r=plied there were none from the University, but that there was an external =negation about a remote event that the 
University had investigated and ha= discredited (the one I mentioned above) and about which they would theref=re not 
provide further information, Buzzfeed informed me that they intende= to report that they contacted the University with
