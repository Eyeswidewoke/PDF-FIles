Sweetheart deal!" So =oes the attack on the resolution of the more than a decade ago federal 
inv=stigation involving our client Jeffrey Epstein. The attack is profou=dly misplaced, supported neither by the law nor 
the facts. Nor is it suppo=ted by the structure of our constitutional republic. To the contrary, Jeffrey was subjected to an 
extremely aggressive federal intrusion into what wo=ld typically be considered a quintessentially local criminal matter in 
sou=h Florida. The offense investigated —4)=-A0at its core, sexual favors for hire — has long been tr=ated as a matter 
entrusted to laws of the several States, not the federal =overnment. The conduct — for which Jeffrey took4orA0full 
responsibility — was a classic state offense and =as treated exactly that way by able, honest prosecutors in Palm Beach 
Coun=y. Nevertheless, without a request from the state prosecut=rs, the federal government intervened. For their own 
opportunistic r=asons, many are now criticizing the federal decision-makers at the time, i=cluding now-Secretary of 
Labor Alex Acosta (then-United States Attorney in=south Florida), for not going far enough. 
The critics are wrong on the facts and the law. The= also ignore a fact going to the heart of 
fundamental fairness: 40=A0In the decade since paying his debt to society, Jeffrey Epstein has led = life characterized by 
responsible citizenship, numerous acts of generosit= and good deeds. 
=ere are the true key facts: Jeffrey Epstein, a successful self-=ade businessman with no prior 
criminal history whatsoever, engaged in ille=al conduct that amounted to solicitation of prostitution. =hat conduct was 
wrong and a violation of Florida state law. Alt=ough no coercion, violence, alcohol, drugs or the like were involved, 
some=of the women he paid were under the age of 18. Those facts=were carefully assessed by experienced state sex 
crime prosecutors who aggressively enforce state criminal laws. No one turned a blind eye to p=tential offenses to the 
public order. To the contrary, the Palm Beac= State Attorney's Office conducted an extensive fifteen-month 
investig=tion, led by the chief of the Sex Crimes Division. Mr. Epstein was t=en indicted by the state grand jury on a 
single felony count of solicitati=n of prostitution. 
<van style="font-family:Arial,sans-serif"> 
=p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:Spt">During that intense investigation, the =tate 
prosecutors extensively gathered and analyzed the evidence, met =ace-to-face with many of the asserted victims, 
considered their credibilit= — or lack thereof — and considered the extent of exculpat=ry evidence, including sworn 
testimony from many that they =ied about being eighteen years old to be allowed into Mr. Epstein'= home. After 
months of negotiations, the state prosecutors believed =hey had reached a reasoned resolution of the matter that 
vindicated the pu=lic interest — a resolution entirely consistent with that of cases-involving other similarly-situated 
defendants. The system worked as =t should have. 
Then, in came the feds. The United States Attorney's Office ex=ensively and aggressively 
investigated whether Mr. Epstein had engaged in = commercial human trafficking ring, targeted minors, or used the 
internee or traveled interstate in the process. But that's not(orA0what this was and that's not what happened. That is 
p=ecisely why the federal authorities' ultimate decision to def=r prosecution to the state was the right one. 
However, the federally-demanded=resolution was not without conditions. The federal 
prosecutors insisted on=various unorthodox requirements that Mr. Epstein's experience= defense team had never seen 
imposed on any defendant anywhere. Under the =ederally-forced deal, Jeffrey was required to request that the state 
=rosecutors demand the imposition of a thirty-month sentence that included=C2*both jail time and the strictest 
conditions of probation: l=fetime sex-offender registration. Those draconian measures were far m=re than warranted by
