witness testimon=, and the Department of Justice's own policies to demonstrate that no=federal prosecution should 
follow and that if it did, it would fail. </=pan>Despite all of our efforts, we were unable to persuade the federal 
prosecutors to totally abandon their federal efforts, but agreed that a solution belonged in the state court. No=20 
federal prosecution. ( making the issue of federal crime victims moot=20 ). We began to negotiate what eventually 
came to be a non-prosecution agreement between the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of 
Florid= and Mr. Epstein. 
The n=n-prosecution agreement was signed in September of 2007 following a wide-ranging FBI 
investigation and months of strenuous negotiation. In exchange for a legal commitment to discontinue the argument 
over jurisdiction. and not attempt to bri=g federal charges, Mr. Epstein agreed to plead guilty to state felony charges and 
other conditions that, despite their recent mischaracterization by the Miami Herald articles, had never been widely 
accepted as being overly lenient to Mr. Epstein. To the contrary, in view of our strongly held belief that there was no 
federal nexus to this exclusively state criminal matter, the benefits that accrued to the Governm=nt from entering this 
Agreement, which have been trivialized by the Miami Hera=d in its condemnation of the Agreement, were quite 
significant. <=span> 
<=pan> 
<=pan> Unlike the public telling., the Agreement included a 30-month sentence. , consisting of an 18-
month jail sentence, followed by 12 months of community control probation. To be clear absent the federal 
intervention, the entire sentence would have consisted =20 under state law : mandatory pre trial intervention , no jail 
time and=20 no criminal record or sex registration. In addition ,despite a misinformed view that Mr. Epstein received 
preferential treatment in the se=ving his already enhanced sentence, it was implemented and served in=the very same 
manner as the sentences of any other county prisoners. The reduction of actual time Mr. Epstein was to spend in jail 
based =n his 18-month sentence was calculated based on the same exact rules applicable to every other county inmate 
, so that the 13 months Mr. Epstein served in jail was precisely the same 13 months that would have been served=by 
every other county inmate with an 18-month sentence who served his time coo=eratively and without incident, like Mr. 
Epstein did. Mr. Epstein was given no special consideration or early release in calculating his time served . Moreover, 
the work-release that was approved for Mr. Epstein was approved under the same guidelines applicable to all county 
prisoners and was granted to many others during the same time as others similarly situated inmates. 
<=pan> 
<=pan> In addition, under the Agreement, Mr. Epstein was required by the feds to register as a sex 
offender for life 0=800 a condition that was not required by state law. </=pan>lt requires him to notify at least one 
registry prior to all travel and to update the registry of every change in his trave= plans, such that his whereabouts at 
any given time are always known by the government. Both his passport and in some jurisdictions his driver's license are 
subject to demarcation =o indicate his status as a sex offender. Moreover, his status as a sex offender requires him to 
register in new jurisdictions =e visits even if only visiting for a short while, and at times prevents him f=om traveling to 
some jurisdictions altogether. Whatever one might think of the offenses alleged against Mr. Epstein= sex offender 
registration is a substantial and permanent constraint on Mr. Epstein's liberty, one that was required to be imposed on 
him by th= United States Attorney's Office. 
<=pan> 
<=pan> Further, the NPA imposed on Mr. Epstein one of the most highly unorthodox civil liability waiver 
and monetary compe=sation requirements that, to the collective knowledge and experience of most attorn=ys,they 
had ever been part of such an agreement. In other=words, the federal government would not tell Mr. Epstein who was 
on a list prepared by them , he wo=ld have to agree to it sight unseen and he would not able to defen= himself from 
lawsuits brought against him, until after he already signed and performed his obligations under the Agreement In 
essence t=e Agreement required him to blindly accept legal and financial responsibility of an unknown magnitude 
payable to a list that the govt would produce.
