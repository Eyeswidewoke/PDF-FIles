Any city where space is limited -- Hong Kong, London, Chicago, San Francisco and, of course, New York -- condo buildings 
are clim=ing ever higher, said Brian O'Looney, an architect with Torti Gallas and Pa=tners in Maryland. And because 
available lots tend to be small, the buildings are also getting increasingly skinnier.t>=A0 The 111 West 57th building, for 
example, will only be 60 feet wide at its base. Demand for these sky-high residences is mostly coming from international 
buyers an= corporate bigwigs -- Chinese businessmen, hedge fund managers, Russian oil billionaires -- looking for a place 
to invest and bragging rights.</=> 
New York builders are developing condo towers as tall=as the Empire State Building -- and one that will be just one foot 
shy of the new =ne World Trade Center. "The taller it is, the more prestigious i= is. People want trophy homes," said Eric 
Trump, executive vice president for Donald's=Trump's Trump Organization. Trump should know. In 2001, his father's 
company developed one of the first ultra-high con=o buildings, Trump World Tower, on Manhattan's East Side. The 
building to=ped out at 861 feet and the man who personifies "trophy" anything. 
These days, new materials and techniques enable devel=pers to go even higher without residents getting seasick on 
windy nights, said Timothy Johnson, an architect with NBBJ in New York and Chairman of the Cou=cil on Tall Buildings 
and Urban Habitat. But before developers can even break ground, they are shelling out big bucks fo= these projects. 
Not only are city lots expensive, but they must navigate a minefield of regulations and community opposition. Once 
they get past those hurdles, they pay handsomely for skilled, experienced trade union labor. Pe= square foot, 
construction costs for high-rise buildings are more than twice that of shorter buildings, said O'Looney. "These 
developers have to build at the very top of the luxury market," said Miller. 4),=AO"That's the only way the math works." 
One57 is still under construction, but this rendering shows what it will look like from Central Park. 
The floors on the upper levels produce much of the developers' profits. People are willing to pay big bucks for the views, 
according to Johnson. At the building= near New York City's Central Park, for example, higher condos can cost 1% to 2% 
more per floor and there=039;s a big jump, roughly 20%, for unobstructed park views, said Miller. Two =enthouses at 
One57 have sold for a whopping $90 million each. One at 432 Park is said to be priced at $9= million, one of the most 
expensive apartments ever sold. "We make tall buildings to be singular ... to be noticed ... to be seen as special," said 
John Torti, president of Torti Gallas and Partners. "This is true for those who build them, design them, and live in them." 
I truly understand the appeal of the unobstructed view and even being in a tr=phy building but l<=pan style="line-
height:107%"> wonder about living on the 80<=font>th floor of a building in a city where the fire department's 
equipment does not r=ach above the 25th floor. I also wonder about living in a building that is essentially vacant, as 
most of the apartments are owned by foreigners who have multiple residences and often w=ll spend less than a month 
each year in their apartment in these buildings.Q=A0 Still our trophy buildings are soaring to unimaginable heights 
twenty years ago as prices for residences in these buildings soar through the stratosphere.
