FBAR: 
Tom may revisions and posted to portal yesterday. I reviewed and posed additional questions to Tom 
Turrin. Tom responded last night with comments at 8:02pm. I will speak to him this AM. Once we agree on 
presentation, I will give you draft FBAR report. 
Isle of man — please see attached Moore Stephens memo re Isle of Man VAT registration. I will confirm 
with Captain Sputh that Isle of Man was chosen for VAT registration. Also attached is memo PW paralegal wrote on 
BJAV which provides broad summary. Captain was contacted yesterday/ afternoon and I will look to speak to him 
today. He is on GMT time. Attached is a sampling of invoices. No invoices have ever been sent or mailed to 760 Park. 
All invoices come to family office via email from Captain Sputh. Sputh has had vendor relationships for many years and 
some date back to Carl Ichan (CCI) ownership . I will confirm with Captain Sputh how he receives invoices. I assembled 
30 invoices for your perusal. Some invoices are clearly emailed only as there is no address. Some use dock where boat 
is berthed. Some use CCI address of 767 Fifth Ave. Some use Captain Sputh's address in Florida. Many use Cayman and 
Isle of Man addresses. A few use 760 Park. As for charters, Sputh has continued to use the same form as when used 
when captain for CCI. Generally the address used is 760 Park or 445 Park. Note that CCI charters used CCI address on 
Fifth Ave. See attached page one for CCI charter and two recent BJAV charters. I will look to discuss with Sputh today 
the invoice address and the charter address. I asked EA for color on use of 760 Park and her review of her files was a 
dead end. 
For construction of SH Meadow (bay house) , we are capitalizing into basis. We value this property at 
tax basis on our books. For the townhouse we are doing same. We have these invoices and as such we review each to 
determine capital vs expense. For other real estate we have valued based on valuation guidance provided by JEE and/ 
or EA/ BJW. For invoices that we have access or have collected, we have capitalized but value the property rather than 
use tax basis (books). Miriam had analyzed 760 improvements based on her records over the past several years and she 
did not find a material amount. A more detailed review is warranted for determining gain the 760 Park coop is sold. A 
project that needs to be completed is compiling all invoices for the Field House construction and derive a tax basis. Also 
the insurance reimbursement information will be needed. 
Trading — Entity was created yesterday by PW. PW/ Ada are working on LLC agreement. 
JPM has not sent all docs for trading via an LLC. They were to send option doc last night. I also asked 
them to prefill the docs with the entity name. I am scheduling a call with them today to go over the form completion. 
DB has sent account opening docs for an entity with entity name pre-filled. They will come to our offices to review 
today. Samantha is assisting on the form completion. Plan is to submit to JPM and DB this Wednesday with BJW 
signature. KYC will follow once LLC agreement is provided. ISDA/ CSA will follow account opening. 
Plane depreciation: Not completed. We are putting Avioneta books FY 2014 in order to reflect a) 
chartering under 135 starting mid-year b) retro-active reimbursements from Apollo c) chartring palne to Jet as part of 
135 operations. I need to sit down with Tom to review the prior year depreciation. His initial take was that he was not 
comfortable claiming depreciation for any period that there was not charter operations.
