terms in their tweets at the time," while a spokesman told The Hill (11/7, Axelrod, 2.98M) that 
Trump's tweets "would be treated like any other when he leaves office." 
Meanwhile, USA Today (11/7, Phillips, Johnson, 10.31M) states that Trump "has long been 
the subject and instigator of lawsuits, both before his presidency and while he has been in the 
White House," which "will not change after he leaves." According to USA Today, "A number of 
lawsuits and investigations awaits Trump once he returns to private life. Some could stain his 
family's reputation. Some could affect his business. And some could damage him personally as 
the protection provided by the presidency goes away." 
In a more than 3,600-word analysis, Politico Magazine (11/7, Grunwald, 4.24M) contends 
Trump "won the White House in 2016 because he wasn't a conventional politician. Joe Biden 
won the White House in 2020 because he was. After four years of presidential rage-tweeting, 
name-calling, gaslighting, race-baiting and all-around norm-breaking, an exhausted electorate 
decided this week that it was ready to return to politics as usual." 
Trump's Return To His Business Next Year Comes Amid "Significant Financial 
And Legal Difficulties." The Washington Post (11/8, Sonmez, Firozi, 14.2M) says that when 
President Trump "leaves office next year, he will return to a business that is facing significant 
financial and legal difficulties." Records show some of the President's "best-known properties 
have struggled since he took office," as "his divisive political rhetoric drove away the big-
spending urban customers and nonpolitical conferences his businesses relied upon." 
In an analysis, Politico (11/8, Kumar, 4.29M) said investigators "are examining whether 
Trump improperly inflated assets, evaded taxes and paid off women alleging affairs in violation 
of campaign finance laws. Women have filed lawsuits accusing him of harassing and assaulting 
them. Lenders are looking for hundreds of millions of dollars in loans to be repaid. And he's lost 
the legal immunity the presidency confers on him. He's lost the White House's bully pulpit. He 
may lose the GOP." Politico added that as such, Trump "must plot how he can make the money 
he will need, keep the attention he craves and evade the authorities probing him. And 
according to Republicans familiar with the situation, he has already started doing that." 
New York AG Says Investigations Into Trump Organization Will Continue. New 
York Attorney General Letitia James (D) said on MSNBC's AM JoyVi (11/8, 844K), "The 
investigations that we currently have against the Trump Organization will continue. The 
outcome of the election will have no impact on our investigations. ... It is important that 
individuals understand that no one is above the law and that our investigations have nothing to 
do with politics but more to do with the facts and the law as we see it and as we analyze it. So 
our investigation will continue." 
US Nears 10M Coronavirus Cases. 
On ABC World News TonightVI (11/8, story 5, 2:05, Llamas, 4.21M), Stephanie Ramos reported 
that coronavirus cases are "exploding across the country," with "nearly 10 million people 
infected, more than a million cases added in just the last ten days. Hospitalizations now rising 
in 43 states." She added, "While there's no clear plan to contain the virus, there is another 
outbreak at the White House. Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and at least five others testing 
positive." 
On the CBS Weekend NewsVi (11/8, story 5, 1:50, 1.44M), Major Garrett said the US has 
"suffered its worst week of the pandemic, and Saturday, 130,000 new infections were reported. 
The most since the pandemic began." Adriana Diaz added, "Wisconsin's surge is pushing COVID 
into new territory." According to Diaz, "Wisconsin is one of 27 states that broke records for new 
daily cases this week. Eight states have reimposed restrictions, in contrast, these 16 state don't 
have a mask mandate." 
In addition, the New York Times (11/8, Mervosh, Smith, McDonnell Nieto Del Rio, 18.61M) 
says the "worsening" outbreak "comes at an extremely difficult juncture: President Trump, who 
remains in control of the federal response to the outbreak for the next 73 days, is openly at
