would get infected during a widespread coronavirus outbreak." President/CEO Dean Banks "said 
he was 'extremely upset' about the allegations against managers at its plant in Waterloo, Iowa, 
saying they do not represent the company's values." 
USA Today (11/19, Bote, 10.31M) reports an amended lawsuit filed Wednesday says 
managers "placed bets on how many would end up getting sick." Tyson kept the plant open 
"even as local officials urged for its shutdown early in the pandemic. As a result, around 1,000 
employees contracted COVID-19, five of whom died." The amended lawsuit claims plant 
managers "downplayed the severity of COVID-19 at the plant to both supervisors and 
processing workers." The Wall Street Journal (11/19, Bunge, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) 
reports Tyson said it suspended the managers accused of wagering on the number of COVID 
cases. 
Older Americans Increasingly Challenged By Isolation Orders. 
NBC Nightly NewsVi (11/19, story 9, 2:55, Holt, 5.84M) reported that social isolation measures 
introduced to combat the spread of COVID-19 are increasingly challenging older Americans, 
who continue to struggle with solitude. Kate Snow interviewed Dr. Louise Erinson, who warned 
that continued isolation will undermine the mental health of America's seniors. Erinson said, "I 
am seeing people having trouble sleeping, having trouble focusing, and worried about will this 
go on forever." The mental health challenges are also burdening caregivers, and AARP's latest 
report warns that one out of six caregivers "report a fair or poor mental heath state." 
Missed Census Deadline Could Impair Trump Effort To Block Migrants From Count. 
The AP (11/19, Schneider) reports that on Thursday, Steven Dillingham, the Director of the 
Census Bureau, "said...that irregularities have been found during the numbers-crunching phase 
of the 2020 census, a development that jeopardizes the statistical agency's ability to meet a 
year-end deadline for handing in numbers used for divvying up congressional seats." According 
to the AP, the Census Bureau "already was facing a shortened schedule of two and a half 
months for processing the data collected during the 2020 census — about half the time 
originally planned." The AP also reports that the Census Bureau "would not say...what the 
anomalies were or publicly state if there would be a new deadline for the apportionment 
numbers." 
The New York Times (11/19, Wines, Bazelon, 18.61M) says the announcement is "a blow 
to the Trump administration's efforts to strip unauthorized immigrants from census totals used 
for reapportionment" because Census Bureau officials "have concluded that they cannot 
produce the state population totals required to reallocate seats in the House of Representatives 
until after President Trump leaves office in January." However, the Times goes on to report that 
Dillingham "did not explicitly rule out delivering reapportionment totals before Mr. Trump's term 
ends. 
The Washington Post (11/19, Bahrampour, 14.2M) says the delay presents "a new 
roadblock" to the Trump Administration's "quest to exclude undocumented immigrants from 
being counted" after an attempt to "add a citizenship question to the survey, which experts said 
could scare immigrants away and result in an inaccurate count" was blocked by the Supreme 
Court. The Administration separately "in July announced plans to try to exclude undocumented 
immigrants," sparking "several legal challenges" and a Supreme Court hearing set for 
November 30, though "it is unclear how the delays communicated Wednesday will affect that 
case." 
CNN (11/19, Wallace, 83.16M) reports on its website that "if the issue delays the bureau's 
data processing steps, the incoming Biden administration may be in a position to override the 
controversial decision by the Trump administration to exclude undocumented immigrants from 
key tallies such as the apportionment count for how many congressional districts states have." 
The Wall Street Journal (11/19, Overberg, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) also reports.
