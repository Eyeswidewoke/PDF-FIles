Re: 
you pontificate from a place that has no basis in experience or education. get over iit. - I told you 
that you needed to focus your attention on the real, as opposed to a tried and true method 
designed to fail. took my maidenhood. allows it to sound like a received something„ you spent no 
time in focusing on anything except your naive provincial ideas. giving away little but always 
wanting , it fact you took your life and threw most of it away , all the while paying no attention to 
me trying to stop it

honestly jeffrey my perspective on you and I and what was possible was always different from 
yours I think. From the chime of your email, I take that you wanted me to develop a career for 
myself that would lead me to independence. 
I'd put it that I wanted to develop my self and from that establish a position , do something of 
value, something that brought value to others. On the contrary, you always told me there was 
a short cut to success and that I shouldn't ever work for anyone other than you, that it didn't 
make sense. This was the dominant thesis for the better pan of ten years. And though with 
initial resistance, a resistance that is once again fundamental , i took on and advocated your 
template of thought. My perspective came from that of a woman who quite simply was in love 
with you and saw you as that type of partner, not as a prize in need of buying, something 
much more real and simple. In my eyes, and the eyes of many others you took my 
maidenhood and in exchange for that there was some contribution on your part to assist me in 
cultivating the greater part of my life. A different kind of humaneness is invoked I suppose. 
I may well be completely wrong with this, but in the spirit of abject honesty, to be quite frank, 
I don't think your antics serve you and I never wholeheartedly did. It is ironic that you 
eulogize those that support it and contribute to it, but on your most intimate level , a place 
that I'd venture to say, I may well have touched, I think it leaves you feeling depleted. 
Balance and equilibirim in life is essential for wholeness and the move in Paris, though I 
remain sorry for any behavior on my part that engendered negativity, aniliated that sense. To 
have it yes, no doubt, you need it but I think you also need a caring that is different from that 
which you perpetually seek, both pleasure and emotional security in the long run are better 
when they are not bought. i might well be wrong with all of this, in fact 
happy to be 
wrong. that is ok. I think you are an extraordinary person, and 
always hold you as nothing 
other than most special and' truly wonderful! '
