Amendment No. 3 to Form S-1 
Table of Contents 
SuperValu—Albertsons and NAI Trademark Cross Licenses 
In March 2013, NAI and Albertsons each entered into a trademark cross licensing agreement with SuperValu, pursuant to which 
each party granted the other a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use certain proprietary rights (e.g., trademarks, trade names, trade 
dress, service marks, banners, etc.) consistent with the parties' past practices and uses of the relevant proprietary rights. The cross 
license agreements will each remain in effect for so long as and to the extent that either party to the cross-license agreements owns any 
of the proprietary rights subject to the agreements. 
Lancaster Operating and Supply Agreement 
In March 2013, NAI entered into an operating and supply agreement with SuperValu for the operation of, and supply of products 
from, the distribution center located in the Lancaster, Pennsylvania area (the "Lancaster Agreement"). Under the Lancaster Agreement, 
NAI owns the Lancaster distribution center and SuperValu manages and operates the distribution center on behalf of NAI. In addition, 
SuperValu supplies NAI's Acme and Shaw's stores from the distribution center under a shared costs arrangement, allocating costs 
ratably based on each parties' use of the distribution center. Unless earlier terminated, the initial term of the Lancaster Agreement 
continues until March 21, 2018. Subject to either party's right to terminate the Lancaster Agreement for any reason and without cause 
upon 24 months' notice (provided that NAI cannot give a termination notice prior to May 28, 2016). SuperValu may extend the term of the 
agreement for up to two consecutive periods of five years each. For fiscal 2014, NAI paid SuperValu approximately $1,154 million under 
the Lancaster Agreement. 
Capital Expenditure Program 
Our capital expenditure program funds new stores, remodels, distribution facilities and IT. We apply a disciplined approach to our 
capital investments, undertaking a rigorous cost-benefit analysis and targeting an attractive return on investment. In fiscal 2015, we 
expect to spend approximately $850 million for capital expenditures, or 1.5% of our fiscal 2014 sales on a pro forma basis, including 115 
remodel and upgrade projects and excluding approximately $300 million of one-time Safeway-related integration-related capital 
expenditures in fiscal 2015, in advance of anticipated sales of surplus assets. We expect to incur approximately $170 million of one-time 
opening and transition costs and capital expenditures to remodel and remerchandise the stores and to invest in price and labor.
