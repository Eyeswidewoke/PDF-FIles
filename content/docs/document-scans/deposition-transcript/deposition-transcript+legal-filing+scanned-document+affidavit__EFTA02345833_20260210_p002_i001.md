5/ So wh=t can we expect from the Jackson Hole symposium? Since it's an acade=ic forum, new ideas for monetary 
policy, such as the ones recently c=nsidered by the Fed, ECB, and the Bank of England, will likely be me=tioned. But we 
caution against expecting a repeat of the 2010 symposium,=where Bernanke telegraphed QE26. Bernanke may well 
mention th= scope for more accommodation, but he is likely to emphasize the condition=lity of new easing, especially in 
light of improving data and Draghi=lowering the downside risk from Europe. Draghi was originally slated to =peak at 
Jackson Hole, but announced today that he will remain in Frankfurt=to hammer out the operational and technical details 
of the ECB's new=bond-buying plan. 
6/ As for the following Fed meeting=, the trivial way forward for the Fed is to deploy the communication tool = 
extending the period for which "rates will remain exceptionally low=#8221; from "late 2014" into 2015. This policy 
move, w=ich we think will be announced in the September meeting, represents more o= an update than a means of 
monetary accommodation. Meanwhile, Operation =wist 2.0 is still ongoing, and given the better momentum in the data, 
we=think the Fed will adopt a wait-and-see approach for a few more mont=s, contrary to what the August meeting 
minutes suggest. If we do get ano=her round of asset purchases eventually, it will probably be in response t= a badly 
managed fiscal cliff. We still think this possibility is =ore likely to materialize around the turn of the year.=/p>

[3] Comments from the Beige Book prepared for the Augus= FOMC meeting support the pullback in demand from 
Europe. In particular,=the Cleveland Fed reported that they "continued to hear reports about a weakening in orders 
from European cus=omers"; in the Richmond Fed district, "A producer of gas turbi=es said that economic problems in 
Europe had reduced his company's exports=by fifty percent"; and, the Chicago Fed noted, "exporter= noted a decline in 
demand from Europe in China." 
[4] In a 21 August speech, Dennis Lockhart commented that "th=re is a risk to monetary policy being employed too 
aggressively." =his signifies a pullback from his 13 July comments where he said wit=out employment growth the current 
policy stance will become "untenab=e" and the Fed will need to do more.

The July employment report s=owed an increase of 163k nonfarm jobs. Since the number of initial joble=s claims 
declined from 388k during the payroll survey week in July t= 372k in August, this suggest another month of payrolls in
