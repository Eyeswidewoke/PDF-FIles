But that sale never happened, Ensign says. 
Ensign says Seckel offered the Newton portrait to another defendant, Michael Sharpe Rare & Antiquarian 
Books, as collateral for a debt that Seckel owed Sharpe for a 15th century manuscript. 
"Since Ensign paid for and owned the Newton portrait and Seckel otherwise had no ownership interest in the 
Newton portrait, Seckel had no right to use the Newton portrait as collateral for his personal debt owned to Michael 
Sharpe," the complaint states. 
Sharpe foreclosed upon the security interest in the Newton portrait, and with the court enforcing the 
judgment, promptly sold it to a third party, defendant Lou Weinstein, according to the complaint. 
Ensign claims that everyone involved knew that it owned the portrait, and conspired to hide that the Newton 
portrait had been used as collateral, had been the subject of a creditor lawsuit, and was sold. 
Sharpe made more than $284,900 on the transaction, and Seckel netted more than $15,000, the complaint 
states. 
Meanwhile, Ensign claims, Seckel induced it to invest in eight sets of rare books that he described as either 
"'pre-sold,' or as good as 'pre-sold."' 
But once again, Ensign says, the sales never took place. 
Ensign says it entered into a contract with Seckel that required him to repay the price of the investments 
should any "material adverse change" occur. 
But a contract couldn't protect it from Seckel's double-dealing, Ensign says. 
With weeks, Seckel said that three of the books, worth more than $103,000, had been stolen by a bookseller, 
though actually he had sold the books, using the bogus theft as a way to cover up his fraud, according to the complaint. 
Finally, after Seckel defaulted, Ensign says it tried to take possession of the books and portrait, and hired an 
auction company to handle the sales. 
At first Seckel failed to cooperate, then "he finally admitted that he had pawned some of the books, 
presumably almost a year after having done so," Ensign says. 
Ensign says that in an email, Seckel claimed that he had pawned the books to comply with Ensign's demands 
for repayment. 
Named as defendants are Al Seckel, Isabel Maxwell, Illusionworks LLC, Lou Weinstein, Heritage Book Shop, 
Krown & Spellman Booksellers, Michael Sharpe Rare & Antiquarian Books, W.P. Watson Antiquarian Books, and 19th 
Century Rare Book and Photograph Shop. 
Ensign demands $543,259, and punitive damages for breach of contract, fraud, conversion, tortious 
interference with a contract, fraudulent transfer, negligent misrepresentation, and fraudulent accounting.
