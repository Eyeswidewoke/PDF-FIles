Patch (02/15, Meadows) reported that an appellate judge rejected former President Donald Trump's emergency 
motion to delay a Cook County court case aimed at disqualifying him from the Illinois ballot due to his involvement 
in the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot. According to the article, oral arguments will proceed as planned, focusing on a

determinations. The article noted that legal director Ron Fein, representing the voters challenging Trump's 
candidacy, plans to appeal, arguing that Illinois law supports disqualifying Trump based on the Constitution.
