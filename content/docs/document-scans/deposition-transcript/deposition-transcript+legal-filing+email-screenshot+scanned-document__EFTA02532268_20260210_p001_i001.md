Fwd: The Carol S. Chomsky Revocable Trust/Marital Trusts.Settlement Proposal 
According to the letter from Harry's lawyer about =he marital trust, below, you agree with this plan. But I would like to 
hear that directly from you. And soon. This is dragging on far too long. 
You've received the earlier correspondence, so you=know that this plan is essentially the most extreme and outrageous 
of the severa= options I outlined to Harry -- intending it as irony. It establishes that Harry will be in complete control of 
the Marital Trust, as he has been (with Max) since I appointed him to replace me in 2009. Accordin=ly, he will be able, 
as in the past, to ensure that the Trust, in its entirety, goes to the three children after I die. The reasons are very clear; I 
spelled them out fully in the letter you have seen, and won't repeat them. 
Harry's current proposal is that he will let me ha=e $100,000 a year. That kind offer requires further analysis. Legally, he 
is required to provide me with income from the trust -- which, incidentally, he apparently did not do until I asked about 
it in 2015. Exactly what that income is supposed to be I do not know, since I have never receiv=d an accounting 
statement from the Trustees, as of course should have been provided. In the absence of an accounting, I cannot be 
certain, but now that I am at last looking at what has been done instead of just taking everything on trust, it appears 
that legal fees were taken from the income that the trustees are legally required to send me. We now have financ=al 
advisers concerned with my rights and interests. They were shocked to discover that investments were being made in 
an entirely inappropriate way: for the long term -- that is, for the beneficiaries after my death -- instead of the standard 
practice for an elderly person of investments with short-term returns, which it is the obligation of the Trustees to 
ensure. For these reasons it therefore unclear just what is being planned. Furthermore, nothing is said in the letter 
about paying taxes on the marital trust, which I've paid in the past. 
The meaning is simple. In addition to millions t=at you have already inherited, you will now also inherit the full Marital 
Trust -- which, of course, was intended for the survivor. In earlier letters, I've reviewed the legal chicanery employed to 
evade the conclu=ion. No need to repeat here. The plan is that I will live on the diminishi=g IRA, which is no longer 
being completely depleted the way it was during the period when that was being done for the benefit of family, the
