Speaking at their home in South =frica, where they live in semi-retirement, the Alexanders reveal they =ad watched with 
increasing concern the beautiful girls who paraded =bout the house topless or naked whenever their boss was in 
residence =48211; until Cathy became so disturbed that she insisted they part =ompany with Epstein in 2007, a year 
before he was sentenced to 18 =onths in jail for solicitation of prostitution. 
Paradise =etreat: Little St James, a private 72-acre island three miles off the =ast coast of St Thomas in the U.S. Virgin 
islands owned by America =illionaire Jeffrey Epstein 
'I saw some girls who I =hought were very young-looking — about 16 or 17 easily — =nd it bugged me because I have a 
daughter and, although she was in her =0s, I didn't like the idea that another woman's child was =n that situation. I 
didn't feel comfortable about it,' she =aid. 
They looked like they had =tepped out of an underwear catalogue. They walked around with very few =lothes on or 
lounged around by the pool with nothing on. It was like =hat most of the time. I was concerned about their ages. A few 
of them =ooked very young and I couldn't help but wonder if their mothers =new where they were. 
'One very young-looking =irl was called Tila. I just thought, "You really shouldn't =e here", but I made myself switch off 
as I had no proof.' =/span> 
Island guest: =odel Naomi Campbell stayed as a guest on Epstein's Caribbean =sland 
The couple, who have been married =or 24 years, still find it hard to comprehend that Epstein is a =onvicted sex 
offender. 
'He was a very kind man =nd, while I don't approve of things he's been accused of, I =iked him very much,' says Miles. 
While Cathy says she was always =uspicious about the girls' ages, Miles insists: 'I took the =iew that what went on 
behind closed doors was not my business and it is =ot my place to judge. If anything was going on we didn't want to 
=now. 
'Our job was about =iscretion. We have a clear conscience that we didn't witness =nything untoward. Whatever went on 
at the other houses — and yes, =e heard things from other members of staff — it didn't, to =y knowledge, happen at our 
property.' 
Miles also says that on several =ccasions he refused Epstein's requests to smuggle female guests =n by boat, to 
circumvent the strict immigration policies of St Thomas, =he island with authority over Little St James, which would have 
meant =ogging names and passport numbers. 
But he was aware that Epstein =ound others to do his bidding. For as the couple were told when they =ere hired: 'What 
Jeffrey wants, Jeffrey gets.' 
The words came from Ghislaine =axwell, who was then Epstein's girlfriend. She flew to South =frica with Andrew 
Shannon, a lawyer, to interview the Alexanders in =998, after they had replied to a small ad for 'management couple 
=ought to run private island'. 
After apparently passing the =nterview, they were invited to meet Epstein in New York.
