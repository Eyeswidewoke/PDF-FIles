Thank you for sending the email from Neil Turok. We have =aised this with the 
Perimeter Institute, which has clarified its =osition, as follows: 
0uring=the event, a sexual harassment complaint was filed with the 
=dministration against you. 
In =012, as part of a formal review of its internal policies, the institute 
=ade a decision that you would not be invited to =eturn. 
I believe this final claim is false, and I would like =onfirmation from you. It may 
be a fine point, but I believe it is =mportant. Originally Michael informed me immediately after the =vent in 2009 that 
there was a complaint of inappropriate =ommunication with one of the staff--something I still dispute--but be =hat as it 
may, he informed me by email that I shoudn't =ommunicate with the staff I had interacted with at the time, and the 
=atter was then considered closed. Several years later I was =nvited to give another public lecture but your outreach 
coordinator =ater rescinded the invitation, although I was reimbursed for =hat. As you are aware, I subsequently 
discussed my concern about =his with Neil in Vancouver in that year, and inquired about exactly =hat it was all about, 
and informed him that either a formal procedure =o resolve any issue in which I could participate and respond might be 
=ppropriate, or the matter should be dropped. Neil said he would explore =he matter, and neither he, nor anyone else, 
ever contacted me following =hat. I have never been informed of anything like Buzzfeed has =laimed. Indeed I have 
been invited back to Perimeter for scientific =eetings by various colleagues in the intervening years. I =ould find it 
highly irregular if any formal procedure took place with =uch an outcome without my knowledge or without any due 
process, and =ithout subsequently informing me, and all evidence I have suggests the =ontrary. 
I am very concerned by this claim below, for obvious =easons. First, the original 
Perimeter source provided false and =efamatory information to Buzzfeed, changing a story only after I =rovided counter-
evidence. 
The accurate history if there =s one, is that there was a complaint from someone at Perimeter about 
=nappropriate communication and that 3 years later a decision was =ade by the outreach coordinator, perhaps in 
collaboration with others, =ot to invite me back at that time for a public lecture. I would =ike to have your confirm for 
me that Buzzfeed's claim is =ncorrect a it stands I would prefer to leave it at that, but if =ecessary one could add that 
there was a report of inappropriate =ommunication with an employee at the event at the time, which I =isputed and the 
matter was closed. 
Please confirm my understanding of this =ssue for me if you will. As you can 
imagine, making this public =s embarrassing for me, Buzzfeed has tried, at every turn, to =isrepresent fads in the worst 
possible light, it is important for me =o not allow them to continue to do this with impunity. For =xample, they 
contacted my university and asked if there any claims fo =exual harassment against me, and though the University 
explicitly =eplied there were none from the University, but that there was an =xternal allegation about a remote event 
that the University had =nvestigated and had discredited (the one I mentioned above) and about =hich they would 
therefore not provide further information, Buzzfeed =nformed me that they intended to report that they contacted the 
=niversity with a request for information about sexual harassment =Negations at ASU and that the University would not 
give them any =nformation. 
Last, while it would not ber surprising if Buzzfeed has =eiinterpeted statements 
from Perimeter staff just to elicit a response, =ut if a member of your staff made the original false allegation to =uzzfeed
