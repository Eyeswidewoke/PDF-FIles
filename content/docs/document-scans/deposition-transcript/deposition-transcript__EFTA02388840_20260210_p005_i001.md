some money ( which I Hve never did before ) which I believe it's already a small accomplish=ent. I did some babysitting 
and after 2 paid trial days ( 250 euros per da= ) shooting for Vogue and Dior, I've got hired by one of the best fash=on 
photographers called 
to be his assistant ( paid job ). I&=39;m very happy and excited to work and learn 
from him which is better tha= any photography school. I'm ready to work as long as I need to in ord=r to build my skills 
and stand out in that field. I think I've achieve= some results and gained some value if I compare myself 2 years ago from 
n=w. Thanks to you I had the possibility to make many interesting experience= like 
in China and MI in Paris. 
Even though I didn't=get hired from them, those experiences allowed me to understand what I lik= and what I don't like 
and shaped in part the person I am. Thanks to t=e MI internship and my passion for photography I am now working 
wi=h 
doing what I really like. However even though I work hard =nd I am paid I cannot fully support myself 
to pay a rent and my living in =aris. I really would like to continue through this path, I feel it's t=e right one but I need 
your help, your support and your advices because I =annot make it by myself. 
I promise I will use my money wis=ly without throwing it away into futilities like 
parties and holidays beca=se I want to grow and build my skills, my carrier and hopefully my future =elf.
