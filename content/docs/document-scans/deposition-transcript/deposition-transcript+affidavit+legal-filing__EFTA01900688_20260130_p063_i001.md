prove they are only on the registry for a Crime Against Nature by Solicitation conviction (and, 
defendants contend, that they prove they did not solicit sex 26 from a minor). 18 Thus, the 
defendants maintain that the plaintiffs cannot succeed on their § 1983 Equal Protection claim. It 
is noteworthy (and puzzling) that the plaintiffs' complaint, which post-dates Act 402, makes no 
reference to Act 402, and it is unclear whether they directly (which they deny) or indirectly 
attack Act 402. That aside, however, the defendants have not carried their burden at this stage to 
show that the plaintiffs have failed to state a plausible claim for relief, particularly in light of the 
Court's repudiation of defendants' conjecture in Doe I.19 18 Again, the Court stresses that the 
Court does not reach the question of who actually has the burden to satisfy Act 402's 
requirement regarding persons under 17, the registrant or the local district attorney. That issue 
of statutory interpretation could be rather important when taking account of whether Act 402, 
indirectly or directly, adds an unreasonable burden to plaintiffs' ability to be removed from the 
registry. 19 As this Court previously wrote: The defendants also urge that the plaintiffs are not 
similarly situated to prostitutes because they have submitted no evidence regarding the 
underlying circumstances of their convictions. That argument conveniently ignores that the 
straightforward comparison for the plaintiffs, for Equal Protection purposes, is with those 
convicted of solicitation of Prostitution. ... [T]he defendants [also] assert that requiring sex 
offender registration protects the public's safety, health, and welfare. They insist that conviction 
is an imperfect indicator of the underlying charge and, because Crime Against Nature by 
Solicitation is a lesser offense to which other registrable offenses can be pleaded down to, it is 
possible that prosecutors pleaded down "more 27 The better time to consider whether the 
plaintiffs' charges directly, or indirectly, put Act 402 at risk, or whether that's even the target of 
this lawsuit, is when that issue has been developed by submission of briefing in connection with 
the plaintiffs' motions for summary judgment or class certification.20 heinous" solicitation 
charges (such as solicitation of persons under 17...). The Court has no duty to indulge such 
patent hypothetical speculation; no suggestion exists in the record that the State legislature's 
purpose for requiring those convicted of Crime Against Nature by Solicitation to register as sex 
offenders was anchored to a legislative desire that prosecutors plead down other registrable 
offenses.... Doe v. Jindal, 851 F. Supp. 2d 995, 1008-09 (E.D. La. 2012). 20 The defendants 
contend that La.R.S. 15:542, as amended by Act 402, is the reason why the plaintiffs and 
putative class members are still on the registry. But the plaintiffs urge the Court to reject 
defendants' semantics, and insist that Act 402, in fact, does not eliminate the offending 
classification declared unconstitutional in Doe I because Act 402 is prospective and left intact 
the imposition of a sex offender registration requirement on those convicted of Crime Against 
Nature by Solicitation prior to August 15, 2011, but not those convicted under the identical 
solicitation provision of the Prostitution statute. Plaintiffs insist that the defendants are bound by 
the doctrines of stare decisis and non-mutual offensive collateral estoppel. Another argument 
advanced by plaintiffs, that is best left to a meritsinquiry, is whether Act 402 improperly imposes 
an exhaustion of state law requirement. See, e.g., Patsy v. Bd. of Regents, 457 U.S. 496, 501 
(1982); Monroe v. Pape, 365 U.S. 167, 183 (1961), overruled on other grounds by Monell v. 
Dep't of Social Services of City of New York, 436 U.S. 658 (1978)). The Court urges the 
parties to attempt to resolve their conceptual dispute and perhaps explore practical solutions for 
removing individuals from the registry in accordance with Doe I's declaratory judgment, 
notwithstanding the State's apparent petulance, as seemed apparent to the Court during oral 
argument; if one believes that undisguised sarcasm is a suitable replacement for effective and 
scholarly 28 Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED: that the defendants' motion to dismiss is DENIED.
