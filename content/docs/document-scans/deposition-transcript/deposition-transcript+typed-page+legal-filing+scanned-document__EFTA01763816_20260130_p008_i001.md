Oct 20th 2012 -- A =IANT Kurdish flag undulating atop a raised plateau inside Syria faces the =own of Senyurt in 
Turkey's mainly Kurdish south-east. At the local headquarters of the ruling Justice and Developmen= (AK) party, a grey 
slab engraved with Ataturk's aphorism "Happy is he=who calls himself a Turk" gathers dust under a stairwell. Across the 
str=et at the gendarmerie, another slogan—"Loyalty to the army is our honour"—glints through barbed wire.</=pan> 
The scene encapsula=es Turkey's Kurdish (and Syrian) impasse. The Turkish prime minister, Rerep Tayyip 
Erdogan, has long called for Syria's president, Bashar Assad, to go. Turkey now hosts over 100,000 refugees fro= Syria. 
Tensions between the two countries have almost tipped into open wa=. Yet there is no sign of an early end to the Syrian 
conflict. And the wit=drawal of Syrian forces from mainly Kurdish towns along the border has raised the stakes in the 
Turkish state=92s 28-year battle with the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). The towns are now run by the PKK's Syrian 
franchise, the Democrati= Union Party (PYD). As well as setting up Kurdish-language schools and Kur=ish outfits, the PYD 
is busily arming itself, forming three battalions so =ar. It claims this is to defend against the chaos that may ensue after 
Mr Assad's fall. But in the eyes of an in=reasingly hawkish Mr Erdogan, the PYD is the PKK—and its main enemy is 
T=rkey. The Kurds fear they, not Mr Assad's forces, are the target of Turk=sh troops and tanks deployed along the 
border. They think a bill just adop=ed by the Turkish parliament to authorise the army to intervene abroad is =imed at 
them. This is overwrought. Yet Turkey is clearly rattled by the prospect of a quasi-independent Syria=-Kurdish entity 
emerging beside the Iraqi-Kurdish statelet in northern Ira=. In Nusaybin, farther along the border, the Kurdish Peace 
and Democra=y Party (BOP) mayor, Ayse Gokkan, gestures at the Syrian town of Kamishli,=partly under PYD control. 
When the Kurdish flag was raised over Kamishli, =housands of locals took to the streets in celebration. "These borders 
are artificial, for centuries we =ived as one, our hearts are one, our aims are one, our suffering is one,=94 she sighs. At 
the BDP-run Mitanni cultural centre, young Kurds are maki=g up for lost time, performing dramas and songs in the most 
widely spoken Kurdish dialect, Kurmanji. "Independ=nt maybe, autonomy definitely," grins a teenager playing the role of 
Ham=et. 
The PKK often seems=less concerned with Kurdish rights than with undermining the AK party. The=rebels have 
escalated their violent campaign inside Turkey, killing scores of soldiers and policemen. And right across =he south-east, 
the PKK has embarked on a terrorist spree, burning governme=t buildings, raiding schools, wounding children and 
kidnapping teachers to=weaken the state's grip. 
The fiercest fighti=g has been in the mountains around Semdinli, a town wedged between Iran an= Iraq. Cemil 
Oter, leader of the powerful Jirki tribe, which has fought on the side of the army against the PKK, sug=ests that Turkish 
rule over Semdinli has become a polite fiction. Mr Oter,=once an ardent supporter of Mr Erdogan, used to tell his people 
to vote AK= "He gave us more hope than any other Turkish leader," acknowledges Mr Oter. But "now he has become 
ju=t like the others, we won't vote for him again." = AK is the BDP's sole rival in the region. It swept up half the Kur=ish 
votes in the south-east in 2007. In 2009 Mr Erdogan came tantalisingly=close to peace, first by taming Turkey's 
meddlesome generals and then by=introducing reforms that gave the Kurds greater linguistic and cultural freedoms. He 
also began secret talks with =he imprisoned PKK leader, Abdullah Ocalan, in hopes of ending an insurgenc= that has cost 
nearly 50,000 lives. But Mr Erdogan's 2009 "Kurdish ope=ing" was closed after he was re-elected last year. Critics claim 
that Mr Erdogan ditched the Kurdish opening in a =ynical bid to court nationalist votes that may carry him to the 
presidency=when it becomes free in 2014. They also say his promises of a new democrat=c constitution will come to 
nothing. The government retorts that, by stepping up its terrorist attacks, the PKK=has made it impossible to get the 
Turkish public on board. Even as Turkish=fighter jets rained bombs on PKK camps in northern Iraq this week, the 
gov=rnment was unveiling textbooks for Kurmanji classes in state schools. An official Kurdish-Turkish diction=ry is in the 
works, and defendants will be allowed to speak Kurdish in cou=t. Yet with each new concession, the PKK keeps raising
