more pressured to keep a lid on labor costs while dealing with the ups and downs of consumer demand, 
said Jennifer Swanberg, a professor of Social Work at the University of Maryland. They get data every 
week about sales for the previous week and how many hours they might need to staff for the upcoming 
week, and they need to be cautious about committing to too many hours. 
"The supervisor is often the person being squeezed between what senior management wants and what 
they have to do day-to-day," she said. 
I caught up with Vermont's Governor Peter Shumlin at a rally for striking workers from FairPoint, a 
telecommunications company, on the steps of the state capitol in Montpelier. Despite the state's record 
for passing wage increases during his tenure, he'd nearly lost the governor's race just a few weeks 
before. When I asked him about concerns that Vermont's worker-friendly policies weren't really helping 
workers, he referenced the national economy. 
"Low-income Americans are even worse off than they were in the depths of the recession," he said. "The 
folks at the top who were doing well during the recession are doing even better now." 
The increases to the minimum wage helped Vermonters, but there's a lot more that needs to be done to 
lower healthcare costs and keep wages high enough so that Vermonters can make ends meet, he said. 
Vermont's single-payer healthcare system, one of Shumlin's signature programs, will help keep some of 
these costs down, he said. 
"We're up against an economic tide that's unusual, since this recovery is lifting the boats of those who 
already had their boats lifted. This is our challenge." 
But increasing wages can also create a whole new set of problems, as Vermonters are realizing as they 
see their pay go up by a few cents or a dollar an hour. There's a "benefits cliff" that workers face, as they 
earn too much money to be eligible for state benefits—but not enough to pay all their bills. 
"I almost doubled my salary, but I'm almost worse off than I was before. I have no services and I'm 
struggling." 
Jessica Atwood, 27, started working in June as a housekeeper at an inn in Queechee, in the eastern side 
of the state, near the New Hampshire border. At first, she was doing well, at $11 an hour and enough 
hours in the height of the summer tourist season to support herself and her 6-year-old son. But her 
higher earnings bumped her all but off of Vermont's state assistance programs—she now barely receives 
any food stamps or heating assistance. Now that fall foliage season is over and fewer tourists are visiting 
Vermont, she only gets a few days of work a week. She just picked up another part-time job—at a 
cheese factory—to pay the bills. 
"I still make 'too much' to receive anything, but it's not enough," she told me, as she stood in line at a 
community non-profit in White River Junction, waiting for a free turkey and Thanksgiving fixings 
alongside hundreds of other low-income Vermont and New Hampshire residents. 
Vermont's only Congressman, Peter Welch, was helping to hand out food. When I asked him about why 
so many working families in Vermont—the bluest of blue states—were still struggling, he, too, blamed 
national economic trends that permeate state lines.
