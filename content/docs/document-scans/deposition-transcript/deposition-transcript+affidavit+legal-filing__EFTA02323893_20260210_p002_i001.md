Hi Sarah, 
Agree about sofa back wall, I will set it up this afternoon and rev=ew the scale, to be 
honest I did not move the coffee table in place because=l could not move it - will get some strong bodies to help me 
with that. Wil= let you know about the size of furniture etc 
Fabric - Black very black, I will also measure up this afternoon an= forward 
FYI - we do need to review the leather in the library, as one thing=we did not address 
was the other side of the screens ie the big window when=closed shows raw wood when you look thru the window -
staining would solve t=e problem - I will forward photos also

very helpful. Personally, I think it makes sense to have the sofa on th= back wall 
with no game table. I showed JE the photos and he would like to s=e more photos of the overall room with the couch 
against the back wall so h= can get a better sense; photos from the corners, etc, so there is more per=pective of overall 
room. Maybe we get a shorter couch for that room, c=uld be an option I suppose. They sell the same couch in a 6' 
version. (the c=rrent one is 7') Not sure if that would make enough of a difference. adiv> 
He also said we can take out the horse hair cabinet, but I know we will=need 
something there to cover the conduit, etc. I don't know how large it i= or what is looks like? Maybe we could have a box 
built around it which ope=s that could be painted the same as the walls? 
JE said we don't have to worry about covering the shelves in the back o= the 
room because his back will be to them. He said we don't even have to w=rry about the curtains coming all the way to the 
shelving on the wall becau=e we won't see that part either when watching a movie. He doesn't seem too c=ncerned with 
the way it will look when you walk in the room, as long as it m=kes the walls black while watching a movie so there isn't 
the glare off the=white walls. 
He questioned the blackness of the fabric from the photos, but in perso= it looks 
black right? I said it was just the flash from the camera that ma=e it look lighter.

Hi Sarah 
1- Fabric I am suggesting 
2 & 3 - other fabric sample which I do not think will work as w=ll 
5 - Back Shelving Wall Great Room - may not need to be address with=fabric? 
7 - Showing corner - fabric would not stop at shelving, but go righ= into corner - 
cut out area
