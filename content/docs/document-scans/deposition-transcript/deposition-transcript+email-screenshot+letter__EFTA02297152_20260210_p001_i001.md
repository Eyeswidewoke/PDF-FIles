Re: Hi!

KARINA!! It has been TOO long since we last spoke. How are you doing? Are y=u done with school for the month? 
I'm good now, no stomach ache. := My car is fine, it cost a lot of money to get it fixed but it runs =ood now. My new 
apartment is going to be nice I think. It will take some t=me to get used to though. I'm moving there at the end of this 
week. 
I'm not very good at ice skating, there are so many rinks here that.] should get better at it I hope. I love skiing, I hope to 
go really reall= soon. 
I wouldn't say that I am a very religious person. But I =ave a lot of faith in God. I strive to develop a relationship with 
God, no= to go through the motions because it is what I am 'supposed' to d=. 
It is very understandable why you think that if a person is born into a=certain religion that they would believe it to be 
true. I did for many yea=s. But there is one very important difference between Christianity and all=other religions. See, 
Christianity doesn't TRY to make people be good.=There are laws, sure, but those laws could never be kept. There are 
WAY to= many of them and they are all so ridiculous, like 'don't eat pork=#39; or 'be inside before it gets dark before a 
worship day. Those law= were there to show us how we are not able to be holy as God wants us to b= holy. That is why 
God sent his son, Jesus, to die on a cross for our sins= He lived a perfect life, one that I try to follow, led by love and by 
God= Now that I have accepted Jesus into my heart, I have submitted my life to=him and to following the Bible (God's 
word) and to try to spread what =ove I can. I now don't have to worry about being perfect because Chris= saved me 
from the sins that I have committed and the ones I will commit (=ot that I want to but because we are all fallen from 
grace). In the Koran =t talks about working your way to salvation, same thing is Buddhism where =ou have to follow the 
Shakras to enlightenment and Nirvana. All these othe= religions have requirements that allow others to say 'look at how 
spi=itual or holy I am', 'you aren't as holy as me'. In =hristianity we are all the same to God; all sinful. None is better 
than th= other, we are all together, helping each other if we can and serving God =ogether for the common cause of 
being a light of love to the world. None o= us can boast that one is more spiritual than the other because none of us=are 
spiritual in the presence of God. We are all dirty. 
Whew, I know I've said a lot, but that is what I believe about my f=ith. I am sincere in it and try my best never to judge 
others. I'm not=going to say it is easy at all but it is important to me and something tha= guides my life. My hope is that 
you'll look deeper into Christianity,=not Catholicism or Orthodoxy but in what the Bible says and in prayer to G=d. My 
favorite Chapters of the Bible are James, Proverbs and the Psalms. G=ve them a read and tell me what you think. I think 
they are beautiful. 
When it comes to traditions, we have to look at them for what they are;=simply remembrances of an important event in 
our form of Christianity to h=lp us remember a significant event. It doesn't matter when it is celeb=ated or how but it is 
important that we do remember it for what it represe=ts. When churches argue when something occurred or didn't I 
believe it=just cheapens the importance of the event. 
I love your quote, it is right on point. I would have to add one thing =hough; instead of saying just love, add: "love of 
God", that wou=d be my philosophy. You are a very deep woman. I didn't realize. :) 
I really like talking to you about this. You are a very bright and thou=htful woman. Let me know what you think about 
what I wrote. I'm prayin= for you too. Do you have anything specific I can pray for for you?
