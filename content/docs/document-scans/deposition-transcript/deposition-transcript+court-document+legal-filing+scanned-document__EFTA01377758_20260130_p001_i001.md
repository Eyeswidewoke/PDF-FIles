S- /A 
otherwise determined by our compensation committee, to earn an actual award, a participant must be employed by us (or an 
affiliate of ours) through the date the award is paid. 
Our board of directors or our compensation committee, in their sole discretion, may after, suspend, or terminate the Bonus 
Plan, provided such action does not, without the consent of the participant, after or impair the rights or obligations under any award 
already earned by such participant. 
401(k) Plan 
We maintain a tax-qualified retirement plan, or the 401(k) plan, that provides eligible employees with an opportunity to save 
for retirement on a tax-advantaged basis. Eligible employees are able to participate in the 401(k) plan as of the first day of the 
month following the date they meet the 401(k) plan's eligibility requirements, and participants are able to defer up to 90% of their 
eligible compensation subject to applicable annual Code limits. All participants' interests in their deferrals are 100% vested when 
contributed. The 401(k) plan permits us to make matching contributions and profit sharing contributions to eligible participants, 
although we have not made any such contributions to date.
