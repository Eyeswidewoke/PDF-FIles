the terms of liberal thought and conventions, will be completely unable to understand this uncompromising attitude of 
finiteness. 
The world is made up, not made. The world is created, and created things can no longer be considered as intermediaries 
leading to an infinity of other things. They are dead: they arc their own fictions, begin and end in themselves, live and die in 
themselves. Created things are dead. The life you live is a lie. The world you inhabit is a lie. There is no need for fiction in the 
world: the world is the only fiction. 
Personality is not the only way. The individual is one of the problems of our time. So, too, the mass of men. What to do about 
amount, what to do about quantity. Theyirmre nothing, starting from one. In a finite world, numbers cloning count: words 
do. mereãTMs no addition, no accretion, no infinite attainments. Nothing and everything, no one and everyone: man is dead. 
ficeThe mass is nothing. The number of men in a mass of men is nothing. The mass is no greater than the singular man of the 
mass.a4
Finite man, finite intelligence: control. Not in control, but as control, as reality, as intelligence. Finite intelligence: the mass is 
no greater than the singular man of the mass. Expect no life from the mass. Expect no voice from the people. 
Life is inexpressible. Life is inexcusable. 
ItaTMs getting much harder to live. hints getting much easier to accept the idea that keit is an illusion that we were ever 
alive.ad0 Life is a knowledge, not an existence. Life is disposing of the waste: names and categories. Name it: itaTMs dead. 
Then you live in those names and by those names. You live in those names and by those names when you live in the world. 
ItaTMs no longer possible to tell a story: life is a story. ItaTMs a story, a narrative series of pictures. A series of timeless 
tableaus, an infinitely successive series of nows. But this canaTMt be. It isnaTMt. aceA picture held us captive. And we could 
not get outside it, for it lay in our language and language seemed to repeat it to us inexorablyt The world is finite: that 
means ficeita isnirmt. We are free from the pictures and the lives lived in the mind are at an end. Words are what matter. 
IaTMm going out of my mind. IaTMm trying to hold on to my body, my life. ItaTMs a horrifying experience. 
aceWe had thought to control it by assigning it a meaning, but the world has only, little by little, lost all its life.e Man is 
dead. ltaTMs not enough to perish. One has to become unintelligible, almost ridiculous. 
ficeNo sign of life but life, itself, the presence of the intelligible in that which is created as its symbolic' Life is a knowledge, 
not an existence. Life is not lived, it is known. Known: not experienced. imagine, you had an experience. 
Disposable world. A reality of acedecreation: to make something created pass into the uncreatedt aceModem reality is a 
reality of decreation, in which our revelations are not the revelations of belief, but the precious portents of our own 
powers.a°
