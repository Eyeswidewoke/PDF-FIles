The Washington Post (7/21, Shepherd, 14.2M) reports that "experts and local activists say 
Trump's claims are the latest in a sustained efforts by conservative commentators and 
politicians to marry the myth of Antifa terrorists to a city where discontent has grown for years 
over increasingly harsh police responses at protests." The Washington Times (7/21, Sherfinski, 
492K) reports that Trump's deployment of federal agents to Portland, "and possibly elsewhere is 
seeing pushback not only from Democrats but also from conservatives and libertarians who say 
the federal government can't indiscriminately throw its weight around and trample on 
constitutional rights." 
Elizabeth Vaughn, however, writes for The Federalist (7/21, 126K) that "President Trump 
has every right to send in 'the feds' when federal laws are being broken, especially when city 
and state officials fail to act." 
Former FBI director James Comey writes in the Washington Post (7/21, 14.2M) that while 
"it is not clear that federal officers in Portland are acting unlawfully," what "is clear is that they 
are acting stupidly, a mistake they may be about to repeat in other places, with lasting 
consequences for federal law enforcement." For DHS, Comey says, "it will now be a long road 
back to trust and partnerships." Comey argues that, "yet again, the craving of our president for 
reelection seems to override everything." 
Oregon State Lawmakers, Groups File Suit Against Federal Law Enforcement 
Agencies. The Oregonian (7/21, Bernstein, 1M) reports that "two Oregon state lawmakers, 
the Western States Center Inc., a Portland church and a Portland attorney have joined to sue 
four federal law enforcement agencies that are providing tactical officers to defend the 
downtown federal courthouse." State Reps. Janelle S. Bynum (D-Clackamas) and Karin A. Power 
(D-Milwaukee), "along with Portland lawyer and legal observer Sara D. Eddie, the First Unitarian 
Church of Portland and Western States Center, which tracks extremist groups and provides 
support to social movements, filed suit Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Portland against the 
U.S. Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Customers and Border Protection, Federal 
Protective Service and U.S. Marshals Service." The suit contends the federal agents "have 
encroached on state powers and violated the First Unitarian Church of Portland's right to protest 
and practice social activism" that are "protected under the First Amendment's free exercise of 
religion clause, according to attorney Clifford S. Davidson." 
De Blasio Threatens Legal Action If Trump Sends Federal Officers. The AP (7/21) 
reports New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said Tuesday that President Trump's "threat to send 
federal law enforcers to patrol the city is likely not serious but if he did follow through, New 
York City would take legal action." Said de Blasio, "I have to start by saying this president 
blusters and bluffs and says he's going to do things and they never materialize on a regular 
basis." He added that if Trump did send federal officers to New York City, "it would only create 
more problems. It would backfire, it wouldn't make us safer, and we would immediately take 
action in court to stop it." 
Trump Campaign Ads Warn Of Anarchy In Democratic-Led Cities. The New York 
Times (7/21, Al, Haberman, Corasaniti, Karni, 18.61M) reports that as President Trump 
deploys federal agents to Portland and "threatens to dispatch more to other cities, his re-
election campaign is spending millions of dollars on several ominous television ads that promote 
fear and dovetail with his political message of 'law and order.'" The Trump campaign is "driving 
home that message with a new ad that tries to tie its dark portrayal of Democratic-led cities" to 
Joe Biden "with exaggerated images intended to persuade viewers that lawless anarchy would 
prevail if Mr. Biden won the presidency." To date, the campaign has spent "almost $20 million 
over the last 20 days" on the ads. 
Fourteen Shot Outside Chicago Funeral Home. The Chicago Sun-Times (7/21, Main, 
Behm, Charles, Camarillo, 875K) reports that 14 people were shot Tuesday night outside a 
funeral home in Chicago's South Side — "the largest number of victims in a single Chicago 
shooting in recent memory." The shooting happened "about 6:30 p.m. as people left a funeral."
