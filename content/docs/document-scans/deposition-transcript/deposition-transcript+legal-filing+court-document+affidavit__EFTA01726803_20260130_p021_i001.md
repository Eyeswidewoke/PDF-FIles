We are making Important Changes to your American Express Cardmember Agreement governing the American Express°  Card Account 
identified on this Notice. We urge you and any Additional Cardmembers on your Account to read this Notice carefully. 
The changes made to the Cardmember Agreement will become effective as Indicated below. This Notice formally amends that Agreement 
and any contrary or conflicting language in that Agreement Is replaced fully and completely. Note that the terms of your Account are subject 
to change (Including increasing APRs and fees and changing fixed APRs to variable APRs) in accordance with the Agreement governing 
your Account. All terms of the Agreement not amended herein remain in full force and effect. 
This is an important Notice of changes to your American Express Card Account Agreement. We recommend that you carefully review the 
changes, and then file this Notice for future reference. If you have questions regarding this Notice, please call the telephone number listed on 
the back of your American Express Card. 
Annual Fees for Basic and Additional Cards 
Effective immediately, the section of your Cardmember Agreement entitled Annual Fees is replaced with the following: 
We will bill your Account an annual fee of $1,000 for the Basic Card, $500 for each Additional Card, $175 for each Additional 
Platinum Card, and $45 for each Additional Gold Card on your Account." 
Dishonored Payment Fee (Effective May 8, 2004) 
• 
We are Increasing the fee to $38 whenever any check, similar instrument, electronic payment order that we receive, or a check presented at 
an American Express Travel Services Office or other authorized location is not honored by your bank or other financial institution. 
Accordingly, we are amending the Other Fees section of your Cardmember Agreement applicable to Dishonored Payments by replacing 
"529" with138." We are also replacing the "$29" with '$38" in the Fees section of your "Agreement between Cardmember and American 
Express Travel Related Services Company, Inc. Concerning Electronic Funds Transfer Services.' 
APR Applicable to Features for Accounts (Effective with billing periods ending in June 2004) 
We are amending the Finance Charges on Features section of your Cardmember Agreement as follows: 
Determining the Prime Rate Applicable to Your Account We are changing the timing of when we determine the Prime Rate used to calculate 
the variable APRs applicable to your Account to the higher of the 1st or 25th day of the month prior to the month in which your billing period 
ends. Accordingly, the subsection of the Finance Charges on Features section of your Cardmember Agreement that describes the Prime 
Rate is revised to replace "20th day' with "25th day.' 
APR Applicable to Accounts in Default We are changing the Default Rate on all Features from a fixed APR of 23.99% to a variable APR 
equal to the Prime Rate plus 21.99%. This change will apply to Accounts that are at the Default Rate as of the effective date as well as 
Accounts that go into default in the future. 
Accordingly, the sentence in the Finance Charges on Features section of your Cardmember Agreement that describes the Default Rate is 
replaced with the following sentence: 
"The Default Rate is a DPR which corresponds to an APR equal to the Prime Rate plus 21.99%." 
Monthly Payment-Minimum Payment (Effective with billing periods ending in October 2004) 
We are changing the calculation of the Minimum Amount Due on your Account. In some cases, as described below, we will increase the 
Minimum Amount Due by $15. Accordingly, we are substituting the third paragraph of the section of your Agreement entitled Billing 
Statements/Amount Due with the following: 
•The Amount Due for any Charges associated with Features will be the greatest of: 
• 1/50th of the New Balance of all Features on the Closing Date of the billing statement (the calculation of which 
is rounded to the nearest whole dollar), 
• the current billed Finance Charges, or 
• $20 (or the total outstanding balance of all Features if it is less than $20). 
If the greatest of the three calculations immediately above is the current billed Finance Charges, then we will add $15 to the 
calculation of the Minimum Amount Due for Charges associated with Features."
