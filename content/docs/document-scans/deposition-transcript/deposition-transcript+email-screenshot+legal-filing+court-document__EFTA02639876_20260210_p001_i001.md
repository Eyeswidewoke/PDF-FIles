Re: [External] Plane 
what is an apollo flight . ?=C2 when will we have the proforma ? the gift ta= paid but still fraud fable is just that . 
=cant be found because it doesnt exist. you are getting c=ildish advice and data. ? sorry. I was very =tear with leon 
that you need a senior tax advisor . person. =AO Joe V is not it. 
you have bookkeepe=s , accountants and enad y 
compliance. you going a=ound to others to see how they work is in my opinion the=height of silliness. I consider 
you tthe best thing that hap=ened to elysium . and have been quite vocal about it. hire th= best people . they cost 
money. This biz is leons most impor=ant asset that he will leave to his kids.. It will be responsbile f=r a whole host of 
family, estate. operating issues.. 
i =ave not gottten involved in the documentation , of what is there =AO . and its acccesibility. i would guess pretty 
good now. =C2 
For ex , my disccusions with other clients =are a give and take , of laws mecahnisms. tactics 
strategys..=C2 audit prep. . case law.. a joint composition of =igh level planning . reporting. analyisis, alternatives. 
=AO 
hearing about an article that your guy might have read in=his dentitst office. that turns out to be bogus. is 
emblematic of th= office. I am confient that you will grow into the job, =AO . re clats I only asked if any of your so 
called advisors=C2 have actually done one so they understand its true and p=acitcal pitfalls. 
your response that the 
art will be s=ld quickly. and that there is a chapter in lerners book about it , t=e same book that leon relied on to his 
detriment before. ( 1031 ) .=C2 was suprising, . if the art is to be sold quickly ( =AO not sure leon would sign on. ) , DO 
it before he dies= not after. art delays the closing of the estate.=C2 
leon is the "BEST seller. , know the ma=ket etc. 
gains can be dealt with . 
I=real tax advisor should demand at least lm per year. up =0 3 . all the big firms have a mandatory retiremen= at age 
60. high level people all on the street. =C2 my friends biz that only grosses 60 m just hired o=e for a million. guys 
that have hand filled out PE=SONAL tax returns TRUST returns . planned strategies yea=s in advance. . Audit 
experience preferable large =ase. . some tax court experience helpful. . filled=out estate tax docs ( VERY 
IMPORTANT)

Some trips for Apollo are not 135 compli=nt due to minor issues of crew rest or otherwise. So occasionally we 
have =o fly Part 91 on Apollo flights. Hard to do without Apollo being ope=ator.
