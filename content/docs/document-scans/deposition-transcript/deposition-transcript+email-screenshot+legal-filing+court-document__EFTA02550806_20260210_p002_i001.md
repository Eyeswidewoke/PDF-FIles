unilaterally changed changed our agreement.. 5m would be reserved for the future ? . and out of=the remaining 15m 
,? i would receive only a third. ( note : lim=confident that both the debt , and the art space investment will also lead to 
a write off of another 30 m. plus=C2* ) In my dining room ,you were surprised when I said that i require most=20 
people to pay their advisory fee up front so that I am assured =hat I will be properly compensated for my work when 
strategies are implemented . you may recall that you appeared offended a=d said " are you suggesting that i would 
go back on my word " I said no = of course not ! you are my closest of friends ,but my experience is that=C2* when 
amounts get large, people tend to get unhappy when it actually comes time for them to pay 
I include below the=email i sent to you on April 15, the day i was examining your returns46=A0 It laid out my 
understanding of the compensation for a transaction of the magnitude to the penny of the one just completed. though 
the number was great it=20 was clear. When it appeared that the details could now be worked out=C240 I was the first 
to say , it is too much money, however. 
From day zero I proposed to discount to 50 - 60 million =the fair price of the transaction just completed . including 
apan>Phaidon.. though this amount was already substantially les= than our agreed and negotiated formula. - I was 
never told that thisiO=A0 was out of range. in fact, alternative methods of payment . plane, =r an -in-kind payment 
were discussed ( ie =20 including keeping the 30m portion of fee outstanding till March=) ,I provided as you 
specifically requested a detailed step b= step execution plan and reviewed all documents that i was given access to.=( 
Phaidon was not forthcoming ) in or=er to make my many corrections . I was then told t=at =span>Alans involvement 
warranted a discount . Even in the best of l=ght , though it is beyond question that not one time in the three ye=rs of 
his retainer has he ever proposed a unique idea. (includin= any wayt to deal with the use issue on debras death ,or 
even the most basic review of your=largest asset by far , the BRH agreement. ) O.K. - lets say he made a contribution to 
the pla= and stretch reality beyond the pale and say it was 50%. though no =ne could posit such a large amount unless 
they were wearing a brightly=20 colored clown suit. , the payment associated with the deal was =nown . It had both 
sent in writing and spoken about on the phone nume=ous times , a detailed execution plan was provided . then an= 
only then after all was laid out for the group I was told that after a number o= conversations with brad karp that a 
total of only 20m would be paid , (and even that was more tha= originally contemplated ) for both transactions . Leon I 
feel 1= was remarkably unfair. I wondered whether brad even knew of o=r prior agreement.? I called him and he said 
he was never told.?, I wou=d ask that you I and Brad karp sit together if you think it would be helpful.. I would like to 
sen= him this email, with your consent of course. If the transactio=s were never consummated , i would not be owed a 
dime, however , the expect=d fee was known up front. , the detailed step by step plan was f=llowed and overseen by 
me, the amount that I had requested befo=e the transaction was even begun, and had already been heavily 
discou=ted, out of friendship, from our agreement . I believe the decision re onl= paying 20 m has frankly , left me 
felling quite une=sy.
