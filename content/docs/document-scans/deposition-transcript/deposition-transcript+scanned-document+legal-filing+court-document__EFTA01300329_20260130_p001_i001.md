"The Physics of the Universe" Summit 
Hosted at SpaceX, Caltech and the Midas West Hollywood Hyatt, January 8.9.10 2010 
To accomplish the extraordinary. you must suck extraordinary people. — James Lee Bran 
In this two day retreat we hope to bring together the top minds (thinkers and doers) in the fields of the physics of the universe both theoretical and experimental. We want to ask 
and answer questions like "I low much can we understand about the universe. soon?" "What is the role of theory and of expenment in getting there?" "Are there things we may 
not undentand?" and "Ilow much of what we think we know might be wrong?". 11w meeting fosters discussion ant) we are convinced that when the brit people talk the outcome 
is advance and growth. We are hoping we can avoid standard prepared talks, and focus on exciting forefront issues, where there may be differences of opinion, or new results that 
will provoke wide discussion. You will receive more information about the program and your own possible role in the near future. 11w summit is inspired by the onset of the 
Large Hadron Collider. the Planck mission, the resent results by satellite and ground based experiments on dark matter searches. and the vast progress in Blowy. Also by meetings 
such as the IIIC Olympics. and the workshops of the past years at the MCI?, KfTP and Perimeter as well as interdisciplinary gatherings of the ASU Origins, the Edge Master-
Classes and Gnostic's SciFoo.
