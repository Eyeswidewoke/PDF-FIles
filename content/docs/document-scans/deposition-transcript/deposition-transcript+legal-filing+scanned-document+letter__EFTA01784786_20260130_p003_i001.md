Olympics in Mexico City, which hurt their subsequent professional careers. Coaches and team executives told Dave 
Meggyesy, a white All-Pro linebacker for the St. Louis Cardinals in the late 1960s, that his antiwar views were 
detrimental to his team and his career. As he recounts in his memoir* Out of Their league', Meggyesy refused to back 
down, was consequently benched, and retired at age 28 while still in his athletic prime. 
In 1969 All-Star St. Louis Cardinal outfielder Curt Flood refused to accept being traded to the Philadelphia Phillies. He 
objected to being treated like a piece of property and to the restriction placed on his freedom by the reserve clause, 
which allowed teams to trade players without their having any say in the matter. Flood, an African American, 
considered himself a "swell-paid slaves." With support from the player= union, Flood sued Major League Baseball. In 
1970 the US Supreme Court ruled against Flood, but five years later the reserve clause had been abolished and players 
became free agents, paid according to their abilities and their value to their teams. In the 1970s tennis great Arthur 
Ashe campaigned against apartheid well before the movement gained widespread support. In 
1992 he was arrested outside the White House in a protest against American treatment of Haitian refugees. In the 
1970s and 1980s, tennis star Billie Jean King, followed by Martina Navratilova, spoke out for women's r=ghts and gay 
and lesbian rights. 
In 2003, just before the United States invaded Iraq, Dallas Mavericks guard Steve Nash wore a T-shirt during the National 
Basketball Association (NBA) All-Star weekend that said "*No War. Shoot for Peaces." Sev=ral other pro athletes —
including NBA players Etan Thomas, Josh Howard, Adam Mor=ison, and Adonal Foyle, baseball's Carlos Delgado, and 
tennis star Martin= Navratilova — raised their voices against the war in Iraq. In 2010 = number of baseball players 
publicly opposed Arizona's controversial anti-immigration law. But with the exception of Robinson, however, none of 
these jocks for justice had the impact that Ali had on public opinion. His fame, his sacrifice, and his lifetime commitment 
to peace and human rights is unequaled in the sports world and I am sure that Muhammad Ali inspired all of them. 
Today's brand-focused, business-like athletes generally choose to m=ke ornamental political statements with T-shirts, 
playing accessories and social media posts, and not to put their careers on the line with their activism. Simply put, 
there's too much money at stake in today =80 s modern sports culture. Choosing to sacrifice nearly four years of one's 
ca=eer seems unthinkable, no matter the cause. The peak time for professional athletic performance is between 25 and 
27 years old, and that's whe= star athletes receive their largest contracts. Ali was sidelined for that period of his life. 
Late civil rights movement leader Stokely Carmichael perhaps put it best, as quoted in Zirin's book: 
Of all the people who opposed the war in Vietnam, I think that Muhammad Ali risked the most. Lots of people refused to 
go. Some went to jail. But no one risk as much from their decision not to go to war in Vietnam as much as Muhammad 
Ali. And his real greatness can be seen in the fact that, despite all that was done to him, he became even greater and 
more humane. 
His humanity — that's where Ali's true greatness li=s. Sports fans can say we were robbed of Ali's true prime, but society 
gained something mu=h 
better: a leading voice against the class and race issues that intertwined with one of the deadliest foreign wars in U.S. 
history. 
For most of us Muhammad Ali is definitely the greatest of all time. And just not because of boxing. Because I remember 
getting off a plane in 1973 on the island nation of Mauritius which is in the middle of the Indian Ocean and when a 
twelve year-old native boy who was trying to help me with my luggage for a tip realized that I came from America all he
