As you know, the trusts were in Carol's name for two reasons: one, we a=sumed that she would be the survivor, 
and two, for estate tax reasons, to assure that the three children would receive the maximum benefits after we both 
died. 
In addition, Max has apparently been allowing distributions from the marita= trust to children and grandchildren 
without consulting me -- and, of course= without calling for investigation of their financial circumstances. That concern 
is reserved for my request for tax payments from a trust to which, by rights, I should have full access. 
I can think of only one explanation: Max, as your lawyer, is seeking to ensure that you receive every penny 
possible: not just the trusts and educa=ional trusts of which you are the sole beneficiaries, along with the two houses, 
and almost all of my pension, but even the marital trusts that M and I established for ourselves. I can think of no other 
reason for his radical change of attitude from the time that the IRA was being exhausted before his eyes to today, with 
sudden concern about long-term potential problems with the marital trust and possible excessive life expectancy. =AO 
No doubt he can contrive various legalisms, but I hope it is clear enough why these should not even be considered in 
matters such as this. 
Plainly, this situation -- which I have only partially described -- is unacceptable. And it would be even apart from 
what I have already written to you, and you know without my spelling it out. 
To repeat, I've worked hard all my life and have been very careful to p=ovide for the needs of my children and 
grandchildren, and to ensure that they will be well cared for after my death, even abandoning my pension and main 
material possessions (the two houses), in addition to trusts of which they are beneficiaries. After M died, I assumed that 
I would spend my last days alone. I was lucky to meet a wonderful woman, who has given up her life, her family, and 
her successful professional career to be with me. We are very happy together, and have been looking forward to a new 
life in Tucson, in peace and tranquillity, where we can be together and pursue our work and lives. I think I have that 
right. Inste=d, I am spending exorbitant amounts of time, energy, and even lawyer's fee= to obtain what should be 
available to me with barely a word. Alone among the people I know, I am compelled to suffer serious aggravation, and 
to spend time and energy away from life and work, without simple financ=al security. I hope you can see how unfair this 
is. 
I would therefore like to renew my request that you inform Max that he should resign. I would then like to 
replace him with my financial adviser, Richard Kahn, who is experienced, highly qualified, and trustworth=. That seems 
simple enough. 
Furthermore, it is urgent. Within the next few days, money has to be available for taxes, and Max's repeated 
delays and sudden scruples a=e going to again cost a lot of money that I should not have to spend. I hope it is also clear 
that I should not have be facing this kind of situa=ion at this stage of my life.
