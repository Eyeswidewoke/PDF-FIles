while mutant workers police with intensity 4. =4, =ZAA 1-w. If an 
allele affecting intensity of policing is recessive, then it is intuitive to 
think of wild-type workers as policing with intensity ZA4=ZA„, 
while mutant workers police with intensity Zo, = ZAA +V/ = Z,1, +w. 
In the limit of incremental mutation, the fraction. p. of queen-
derived males and the colony efficiency, r, become functions of the 
average intensity of policing in the colony, which is Z+ wz. where z 
is the fraction of mutant workers in the colony. We have

We have made the substitutions p,-•P(Z+ wz) and rz -.R(Z+wZ). 
and (11) gives the Taylor expansions of these quantities in terms of 
their first and second derivatives at intensity Z. (For conciseness, we 
will often omit the argument Z from the functions P and R and their 
derivatives.) Here, wl<1. so that workers with the phenotype 
corresponding to the mutant allele only have an incremental effect 
on colony dynamics. Thus, the expansions (11) are accurate 
approximations. We assume that P > 0. The sign of w can be posi-
tive or negative. If w is positive, then the mutant allele's effect is to 
increase the intensity of policing. If w is negative, then the mutant 
alleles effect is to decrease the intensity of policing. Note that this 
formalism could also be interprets as describing the case of weak 
penetrance, in which only a small fraction of all workers that have 
the mutant genotype express the mutant phenotype. 
For considering the dynamics of a dominant police allele with 
weak phenotypic mutation, we introduce the quantity

Notice that ( 13) and (15) are, up to a multiplicative factor, the same

Using Eqs. (13) and (IS), the condition for policing to increase 
from a given level Z is

Policing decreases from a given level Z if the opposite inequality 
holds. We have explicitly written the 2dependencies in Eq. (16) to 
emphasize that the quantities P.P. R. and /V are all functions of the 
intensity of policing. Z. 
The left-hand side of Eq. (16) can be understood as a ratio of 
marginal effects. To be specific, the left-hand side gives the ratio of 
the marginal change in efficiency over the marginal increase in the 
proportion of queen-derived males, if policing were to increase by 
a small amount For selection to favor increased policing, this ratio 
of marginals must exceed a quantity depending on the current 
values of 12 and P. 
Notice that the sign of the right-hand side is determined by 
n —2. So we get different behavior for different numbers of 
matings: 
• For n =2 (double mating), policing increases from Z if and only if 
K(Z) > 0. This means that evolution maximizes the value of R. 
regardless of the behavior of P. In other words, for double 
mating, evolution maximizes colony efficiency regardless of the 
effect on the number of queen-derived males. 
• For n=1 (single mating), the right-hand side of Eq. (16) is 
positive. So the condition for Z to increase is more stringent 
than in the n=2 case. Increases in policing may be disfavored 
even if they increase colony efficiency. 
• For n z 3 (triple mating or more than three matings). the right-
hand side of Eq. (16) is negative. So the condition for Z to 
increase is less stringent than in the n=2 case. Any increase in 
policing that improves colony efficiency will be favored, and 
even increases in policing that reduce colony efficiency may be 
favored. 
Eqs. (13) and (15) also allow us to determine the location(s) of 
evolutionarily singular strategies (Geritz et al., 1998). Intuitively, a 
singular strategy is a particular intensity of policing, denoted by 
Zs. at which rare workers with slightly different policing behavior 
are, to first order in w, neither favored nor disfavored by natural 
selection. The parameter measuring intensity of policing, Z. can 
take values between 0 (corresponding to no policing) and 1 (cor-
responding to full policing). There are several possibilities: There 
may not exist a singular strategy for intermediate intensity of 
policing; in this case, there is either no policing (V = 0) or full 
policing (r =1). If there exists a singular strategy for 0 < 
< I. 
then there are additional considerations: There may be convergent 
evolution toward intensity r or divergent evolution away from 
intensity 
In a small neighborhood for which Z x2*. further 
analysis is needed to determine if the singular strategy corre-
sponding to r is an ESS. 
To determine the location(s) of evolutionarily singular strate-
gies, we set the quantity in square brackets that multiplies w in 
(131 and I to zero. yielding

Eq. (17) gives the location(s) of singular strategies for both domi-
nant and recessive mutations that affect policing. 
For a given singular strategy V. there is convergent evolution

There is divergent evolution away from 2° if the opposite

It is helpful to consider some examples. If the functions f(Z) 
and R(Z) are known for a given species. then the behavior of 
worker policing with gradual evolution can be studied. It is pos-
sible that policing is at maximal intensity, Z. = 1 (Fig. 14(a)), is 
nonexistent,

intensity. 0 <2* < 1 (Fig. 14(c)), or exists at an intermediate value 
of intensity, 0 <V < 1 (Fig. 14(d)). 
Note that a singular strategy may or may not be an evolutio-
narily stable strategy (ESS). (For example. it is possible that there is 
convergent evolution toward a particular singular strategy Zs
which is not an ESS. In this case, once Z 2', evolutionary
