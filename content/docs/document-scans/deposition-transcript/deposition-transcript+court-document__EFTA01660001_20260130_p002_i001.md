Mr. Epstein provided to you no documentation regarding his pre-incarceration 
employment with "The Florida Science Foundation" or its corporate alter-ego, "The C.O.U.Q. 
Foundation, Inc." As you will see, it seems clear that the Foundation, its offices, and Mr. 
Epstein's purported job schedule were all created on the eve of Mr. Epstein's incarceration in 
order to provide him with a basis for seeking work release. 
The Florida Science Foundation was not registered with the State of Florida and had no 
office space or telephone number until after Mr. Epstein was already incarcerated. 
The 
application filed with the State of Florida and signed under penal of e .11 
b Richard Kahn 
lists Mr. Kahn's and the Foundation's telephone number as 
That is the 
telephone number of Atterbury, Goldberger and Weiss—one of the law firms representing Mr. 
Epstein. Richard Kahn is a partner at the law firm of Sullivan and Cromwell in New York and 
has no association with the Atterbury firm. 
I have enclosed the IRS returns of "The C.O.U.Q. Foundation, Inc." for fiscal years 1999 
through 2006 (which covers the period through 2/28/07). 
Each and every one of those sworn 
filings shows that Mr. Epstein worked for the Foundation for only one hour  per week and earned 
no compensation. ( See page 6 of each return.) All of these returns were signed under penalty of 
perjury by either Mr. Epstein or Darren Indyke, who is listed in Mr. Epstein's work release file as 
Mr. Epstein's "supervisor." Mr. Epstein's misstatement of his prior work duties and salary 
violate the salary and employment verification requirements of C.O.P. #926.01(V)(C)(7) and (8). 
In response to your requirement of "a detailed work schedule," Mr. Indyke has provided 
the following two sentences: 
[Mr. Epstein's] duties will require him to work six days a week, Monday through 
Saturday, at the Foundation's office located at 250 S. Australian Avenue, Suite 
1404, West Palm Beach, Florida from the hours of 8:00 A.M. to 8:00 P.M. 
As President of the Foundation, Mr. Epstein will be responsible for the general 
oversight and management of the Foundation, and particularly, to seek out, evaluate 
and determine worthy charitable causes to which the Foundation may make 
contributions. 
Mr. Indyke did not disclose that Mr. Epstein only worked one hour per week prior to his 
incarceration and has provided no explanation of why Mr. Epstein could perform these duties in 
one hour per week before he was incarcerated but now needs to spend 72 hours each week to do 
the same job. Again, this is inconsistent with C.O.P. #926.01(V)(C)(7). 
Mr. Indyke has signed the "Alternative Custody Unit Program Agreement" as Mr. 
Epstein's "employer." In that Agreement, Mr. Indyke promises to "notify the Alternative 
Custody Unit immediately if the Participant: (1) Fails to appear for work at the scheduled time; 
and (2) Leaves the place of employment prior to the scheduled time." Both in this form and in 
Mr. Indyke's letter in support of Mr. Epstein's application, Mr. Indyke neglects to inform the 
Sheriff's Office of two significant facts. First, Mr. Indyke lives and works in the New York 
metropolitan area. He is not and will not be present at Mr. Epstein's workplace, so he will not 
know if Mr. Epstein "fails to appear for work" or "leaves the place of employment." Mr. Indyke 
also will not be able to supervise Mr. Epstein's actual work to determine whether he is truly 
doing the work of The Florida Science Foundation. a Second, Mr. Indyke does not "employ" 
Mr. Epstein. Instead, Mr. Epstein "employs" Mr. Indyke. Mr. Epstein is the President and 
founder of The Florida Science Foundation and Mr. Indyke is its Vice President. 
More 
importantly, Mr. Epstein is also the founder and President of the Financial Trust Company, his 
for-profit corporation. 
Mr. Indyke is Mr. Epstein's subordinate at that entity as well. 
Accordingly, Mr. Epstein has authority over Mr. Indyke's position and salary, which will cloud 
Mr. Indyke's objectivity regarding his supervision of Mr. Epstein.
