Narrative 
of this SAR is the total amount of activity of concern reported in the initial SAR filed on 07/13/2019 and this SAR filing. 
Jeffrey Epstein was arrested and federally charged on 07/08/2019 with one count of sex trafficking of minors, and one count of 
conspiracy to engage in sex trafficking of minors, alleging the activity took place between2002 and 2005, possibly with an 
exchange of funds for acts. Jeffrey Epstein was held in Federal custody as prosecutors considered Jeffrey Epstein a very high 
flight risk given his enormous wealth, international ties, and private planes. On 08/10/2019, Jeffrey Epstein was found deceased 
while in jail by an apparent suicide. Per internet research two days prior to Jeffrey Epstein's death, he executed his last will and 
testimony where it appears his assets were moved into a trust that has been filed in the US Virgin Islands. The executors of Mr. 
Epstein's will are Richard Kahn and Darren Indyke. 
The initial SAR filed by Schwab on 07/13/2019 (DCN 31000150416250) reported concerns with international wires attempted to 
be remitted from the Schwab account registered to the Southern Financial LLC to an individual in Morocco for real estate 
purposes. In light of the negative media surrounding Jeffrey Epstein, which included a bail hearing, Schwab filed to report the 
attempted money movement for an individual considered a flight risk. The outgoing wires were attempted to be remitted to Marc 
Leon, a partner at Kensington Morocco, which appears to offer luxury properties in Morocco and France 
(www.kensingtonmorocco.com). The attempted international wires which were identified in the initial investigation review were 
ultimately canceled or reversed at the request of the account agent, Richard Kahn. 
During this continuation investigation, additional outgoing funds remitted from the accounts up until account closure raised 
concerns given the continued media coverage on Jeffrey Epstein. It should be noted the outgoing funds were primarily remitted 
between 07/15/2019 and 08/02/2019, while Jeffrey Epstein was alive in Federal custody and before his will was executed and 
filed in the US Virgin Islands. 
Between 07/15/2019 and 08/.2019, the two corporate accounts sent 16 individuals wires for an aggregated amount of 
$45,354,912.12. The wires were sent to individuals and companies that appear connected and/or associated with Jeffrey Epstein 
as follows:
