JAMES E. STALEY to be the Executors of this Will. If any one or more of my Executors fails 
to qualify or ceases to act, I appoint ANDREW FARKAS as successor Executor. I authorize the 
last acting Executor to designate his successor as Executor. 
B. 
If my estate must be administered in whole or in 
part in any jurisdiction other than the state or territory of my domicile at the date of my death 
and if my Executor is unable or unwilling to serve in such jurisdiction, then I appoint the 
successor Executor of my estate designated in Paragraph A of Article THIRD provided that he is 
able and willing to serve in such jurisdiction. If no Executor or successor Executor is able and 
willing to serve in such jurisdiction, my Executor shall designate a successor Executor to serve 
in such jurisdiction. Such designation shall be made by written instrument delivered to such 
successor Executor. 
C. 
No bond or other security shall be required of any 
Executor in any jurisdiction. 
D. 
Any Executor may resign in the manner provided 
for by the governing statutes of the state or territory having jurisdiction of the administration of 
my estate or, in the absence of such statutory guidance, by filing a written notice of resignation 
with the Court having jurisdiction of the administration of my estate. Any Executor who resigns 
shall not be entitled to any compensation hereunder for any services rendered as Executor prior 
to his resignation. 
E. 
My 
Executor shall 
not 
be accountable or 
responsible to any person interested in my estate for the manner in which my Executor in good 
faith exercises or declines to exercise any discretionary authority or power of my Executor. My 
Executor shall not be liable for any loss or depreciation in value occasioned by reason of any 
negligence, error or mistake of judgment in entering into any transaction, in making any sale or 
investment, in continuing to hold any property or by reason of any action or omission, whether 
by my Executor or any other fiduciary, unless my Executor has acted in bad faith. In the absence 
of proof by affirmative evidence to the contrary, each Executor shall be deemed to have acted 
within the scope of my Executor's authority, to have exercised reasonable care, diligence and 
prudence and to have acted impartially as to all interested persons. An Executor shall not be 
liable for the acts or defaults of another Executor. 
FOURTH: 
The following provisions shall apply to my estate and to my 
Executor, except as is otherwise specifically provided in this Will: 
A. 
My Executor has the entire care and custody of all 
assets of my estate. My Executor has the power to do everything my Executor in good faith 
deems advisable without necessity of any judicial authorization or approval, even though but for 
this power it would not be authorized or appropriate for fiduciaries under any statutory or other 
rule of law. My Executor shall exercise my Executor's best judgment and discretion for what 
my Executor believes to be in the best interests of the beneficiaries hereunder. If more than two 
Executors are empowered to participate in the decision to exercise or not exercise any fiduciary 
power granted by this Will or by law, a majority of such Executors shall be empowered to make 
such decision.
