single family,=since January 1, 2017; and 
(b) Donors who contributed in ex=ess of $300,000 since 2010. 
Only reque=ts from these individuals or groups will be considered for return. The

Foundation shall be solely responsible for determining the m=thod for calculating the 
amount of funds attributable to ea=h donor that are available for return, making the 
calculati=n, and specifying the form of the consent or direction necessary from the 
d=nor. 
Since the original mission of the Origins=project that you supported is no long being 
carried out directly at ASU, I f=lt it was important that people who donated to the project should feel free=to reassign 
their donations elsewhere. The first step in this process=is contacted the ASU Foundation to ask for the return of your 
funds. =1 am thus reaching out to you now to let those of you who fall into one of t=e categories described above 
(others among you can contact the foundation a=d ask as well.. I don't know how rigid they will be), that you need=to 
contact the ASU Foundation by January 16th to initiate the process of ha=ing your donation returned to you. Contact 
information for the Execut=ve Director of the ASU Foundation is given below. 
At the same time, I have=some good news: The Origins Project's original mission will 
continu= through the work of a newly created non-profit corporation, The Origins Pr=ject Foundation, INC, which will be 
a tax exempt organization under 501 (c)=(3). We are hoping you will consider reassigning your original donati=n, after it 
is returned to you, to support the work of this new Foundation.= The Origins Project Foundation, which is based in 
Phoenix, will host=the same kind of remarkable forefront public panels that you are familiar w=th from the original 
Origins Projects, as well as host exciting travel and o=her educational opportunities giving members of the public direct 
access to=the leading scientist, scholars, public intellectuals and leading artists, m=sicians, writers, as we discuss the 
issues that are most important for meet=ng the challenges of the 21st century. While the new program i= currently 
under development, I am very happy to announce that John Edwards= Joseph Logan, and Steven Home have joined me 
as directors of the Origins P=oject Foundation. Our website has just been launched, and you can go t= it to follow 
developments and be added to the mailing list as our full sla=e of public programs and other activities unfolds. The 
website is: &n=sp;ht=ps://originsprojectfoundation.org <https://originsprojectfoundation.org> . We are hoping to begin 
pro=ramming by the summer or fall of 2019 at the latest if we can raise s=fficient funds between now and March. 
If you=wish assistance in moving your funds to provide a tax free gift to the new 
f=undation, please contact the foundation via its web site, or contact: John E=wards, the treasurer of the Foundation, 
directly at.. xxxx. &n=sp;John can give you banking information and other guidance. 
Your support of the work of the ASU Origins Project helped t=rn that program into one 
of the most exciting public education opportunitie= anywhere in the world. Leading that program was one of my 
proudest a=hievements in over 30 years as a professor at various institutions around t=e world. I am extremely excited 
about carrying on, and expanding that=legacy through this new initiative. I am hoping you will join us as w= move 
forward with an exciting new Origins Project , building on our past e=perience, and extending it to new and even more 
exciting opportunities to c=nnect forefront world leaders with the public to help build a better future= 
Whatever you decide to you, I wanted to personall= thank you for helping make Origins 
such a success, and I hope to see you a=ain in 2019 and beyond.
