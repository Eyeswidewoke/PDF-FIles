Union" on Sunday "said starting those conversations now would have an "obvious" benefit for 
the next administration." 
On ABC World News TonigISVi (11/15, story 4, 2:30, Llamas, 4.5M), Rachel Scott 
reported Fauci is "saying it's time to work with Joe Biden." Fauci: "It's almost like passing a 
baton in a race. You don't want to stop and then give it to somebody. You want to just 
essentially keep going. And that is what transition is. So, it certainly would make things more 
smoothly if we could do that." 
Meanwhile, USA Today (11/15, Yasharoff, 10.31M) reports former President Barack Obama 
in a "CBS Sunday Morning" interview "reflected on a wide range of topics" and "brushed 
off...Trump's and his supporters' fight against the election results." Obama asserted, "Joe Biden 
will be the next president of the United States and Kamala Harris will be the next vice president 
of the United States. There is no legal basis." The Hill (11/15, Folley, 2.98M) also reports that 
Obama "said...that it's `disappointing' more Republican lawmakers are not challenging...Trump, 
who is continuing to push unsubstantiated conspiracy theories around the election after his 
projected defeat." Bloomberg (11/15, Allison, 4.73M) reports Obama said, "When your time is 
up then it is your job to put the country first and think beyond your own ego, and your own 
interests, and your own disappointments." He added, "My advice to President Trump is, if you 
want at this late stage in the game to be remembered as somebody who put country first, it's 
time for you to do the same thing." 
In an interview with CBS' 60 MinutesVI (11/15, 7.02M), Obama was asked his advice for 
Trump. Obama said, "A President is a public servant. They are temporary occupants of the 
office, by design. And when your time is up, then it is your job to put the country first and think 
beyond your own ego, and your own interests, and your own disappointments. My advice to 
President Trump is, if you want at this late stage in the game to be remembered as somebody 
who put country first it's time for you to do the same thing." Asked if it is time for Trump to 
concede, Obama said, "Absolutely. I mean, I think it was time for him to concede probably, the 
day after the election, or at the latest, two days after the election." 
In an interview with CBS' 60 MinutesVi (11/15, 7.02M), Obama was asked about 
President Trump's claims of widespread election fraud. Obama said, "The President doesn't like 
to lose and never admits loss. I'm more troubled by the fact that other Republican officials who 
clearly know better are going along with this, are humoring him in this fashion. It is one more 
step in delegitimizing not just the incoming Biden Administration, but democracy generally and 
that's a dangerous path. We would never accept that out of our own kids behaving that way if 
they lost, right? I mean, if my daughters, in any kind of competition, pouted and then accused 
the other side of cheating when they lost, when there was no evidence of it, we'd scold them. I 
think that there has been this sense over the last several years that literally anything goes and 
is justified in order to get power." 
The Hill (11/15, Choi, 2.98M) reports former Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson 
on Sunday "said...the Trump administration's refusal to aid in a transition to a Biden presidency 
is a disservice to Americans as well as national security, stating that a new administration 
cannot begin without any information." On ABC's "This Week," Johnson said, "A new 
government cannot start on January 20 from a standing-still position. This is what transitions 
are for. Intelligence briefings, [presidential daily briefings], when you're in office, in national 
security are your eyes and ears." 
Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-VT), on CNN's State Of The UnionVi (11/15, 1.1M), said, "I am 
less and less worried about [the lack of progress on a transition] because as more and more 
victories state-by-state are confirmed for Biden, I think public support in any way, shape, or 
form for the President is now going down. But I will say this, Trump will have the distinction of 
doing more than any person in the history of this country in undermining American democracy. 
The idea that he continues to tell his supporters that the only reason he may have lost this 
election is because of fraud is an absolutely disgraceful un-American thing to do and I would
