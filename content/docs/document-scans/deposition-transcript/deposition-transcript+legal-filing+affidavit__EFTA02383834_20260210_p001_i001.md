Re: CV 
Why are you recalling all tho=e things that happened in the past ? Always pulling me down for everything=.. When you 
told me I needed an education I thought you meant I had to go =o university. Why did you make me study for the Toefl ? 
Why did you even s=art paying for my school if it was to stop in the middle of the year ? I a=ologized over and over for 
the things I did. In Paris I was in a bad mood =ecause you were repeatedly telling me "now what are you going to 
do&q=ot; I didn't expect you wanted to stop with my school and I got into p=nic being totally destabilized. I have 
feelings as well... I spent most of=C2 my money to come to see you in NY to apologize for my bad mood and ha=e fun 
and instead of seeing the positive side of it you've seen only n=gatives. I know it wasn't very clever but it was something 
totally spo=teneous that I did with the heart without thinking of the consequences. Wh=n you told me to get an 
internship I said ok and sent emails ( Gagosian, C=anel and Dior ). When I toldMil was scared to loose my freedom 
doesn&ii=9;t mean I wasn't looking for a work. You need to understand that=my fears are human since I've never really 
worked and don't have a=y knowledge or example around me. I've always tried to escape reality =n some way acting like 
a spoiled child. My family situation is not ea=y and no one ever cared or gave me any example of work. I told you pe=ple 
around me were putting me pressure like my mother but doesn't mean=l take their judgment seriously and you 
perfectly know my mother can&=39;t help me. In fact, I'm writing to you, not her. And if I'm wri=ing to you it's because I 
think your judgement matters more then anyon= else because you are really important to me and I need =our help 
because if not I'm lost. Even if I've done many mistakes,=I've always listened to all of your advices. You told me in 
September =hen you came to Paris that I wasn't serious about getting in shape, dr=ving, school... So I changed and got 
more disciplined about those things. =he reason I've got an appointment with Serena this afternoon for an in=ernship is 
because you told me to do it, and I did follow your advice. If = wouldn't care I wouldn't even asked you to help me with 
my CV. Fo= me moving to a new city and going to a real school was a total change and=even if I did some mistakes I 
think I've also done lots of progress re=arding my Life and discipline thanks to you. However I'm still fa= to be perfect 
and still have lots of learning and growing. I apologize ag=in for the stupid things I did over and over and my bad 
behavior... N=ne of those things were meant to harm you.
