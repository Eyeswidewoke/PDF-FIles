Hello Team, 
I apologize for the delay, but it took some time to hear back from one of the civil attorneys that 
has 
extensively been communicating. I'm also copying 
into this. Please note that 
also reached out SSA 
who sent a similar email to 
and myself a few days ago. 
has provided him with the 
same information below. I've highlighted the portion of text that is relevant what this means for FBI/VSD. 
The Estate of Jeffrey Epstein has created a Claims Fund Program to compensate the victims of Mr. Epstein. If a victim was 
abused by Mr. Epstein, she is eligible to participate in the Program. Victims are eligible to participate in the Program even 
if their claim is time-barred by the statute of limitations or if they previously entered into a settlement agreement with 
Jeffrey Epstein in the past, assuming other criteria is met. There is no cap or limitation on the amount of funds available 
to the Program to compensate all eligible victims. 
This Program is different from the lawsuits that have been filed or could be filed against the Estate. The Program is 
voluntary, which means that each victim has the right to chose whether or not to participate. If the victim has a claim 
that is not barred by the statute of limitations, she can choose to file a lawsuit and litigate her case rather than participate 
in the Program. She can also choose to participate in the Program and litigate her case in Court at the same time. The 
Program and the lawsuit are independent of one another. 
The Program is run by Program Administrator-. 
Each victim who chooses to participate in the Program will 
submit her claim (comprised of the details of her abuse and proof of her damages). Ms. 
will then make a 
determination as to the monetary value of her claim. Each claim will be evaluated separately, meaning the dollar 
amounts awarded to compensate each victim will differ and are made irrespective of one another. 
Ms. 
will run the Program independently from the Estate. This means that the Estate will not be involved in 
determining the amount of compensation awarded to each claimant. Ms. 
will make those determinations on her 
own without input from the Estate. The Estate will be provided with the names of the victims who submit claims to the 
Program, but they will not have access to any evidence that each victim submits to support her claim. 
After Ms. 
has evaluated a claim, she will issue a letter to the victim or her attorney including the amount of 
compensation that the Program is willing to pay to compensate her. At that time, the victim can either accept the amount 
of money being offered to her and sign a release precluding her from continuing any litigation or taking any further action 
against the Estate, or she can reject the amount of money offered and, if she chooses and the remedy is legally available, 
proceed with/file a lawsuit. 
By way of brief relevant background, the Estate intended to have this Program approved by the Court in the USVI on 
February 4. Shortly prior to the hearing, the Virgin Islands Attorney General filed a lien against the Estate preventing the
