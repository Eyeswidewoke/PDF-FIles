I know it didn&=39;t just happen and I assume my responsibilities.. Does this means that l=should stay in this situation 
forever because of my previous mistake= ? I'm starting to understand how life works.. it's not easy, actu=lly it's very 
scary and wild. I feel like I've been thrown in a ju=gle all of a sudden surrounded by lions. You've always told me that 
sc=ool is unusfull and internships ( even if in good companies, like I've=always found ) as well since they are not paied so 
it was a waste of time.=Now I'm working very hard as a babysitter from 8am to 8pm, a paied job=( the kind of job you've 
always told me to do) and assisting the photo=rapher when I can in order to learn something interesting ( babysitting 
is=not very interesting and it's taking most of my time and energy) but i='s paied... How long should I work as a 
babysitter in order to be succ=ssful ? Do you think this is getting me on the right path ?
