moratorium on using CRISPR-Cas9 to edit the human germline—making changes to 
sperm, eggs, and embryos that would then be passed along to future 
generations—and have warned against altering humans for non-medical reasons. 
There are also some practical concerns when it comes to using CRISPR-Cas9 
for therapeutics. How can a therapy using this technology be delivered into 
the body effectively? Will it safely do its work, or cut DNA in the wrong 
places? One wrong snip—a so-called off-target effect—could cause serious 
unintended consequences, and ensuring that this doesn't happen is just one 
of the technical challenges that have to be faced before a CRISPR-Cas9 drug 
begins human testing. One need only look at the up and down history of gene 
therapy and RNA interference drugs to see the roller coaster likely ahead as 
researchers try to figure out how to use CRISPR-Cas9 for therapeutics. 
While Bosley acknowledges the challenges to come, she notes that part of the 
excitement surrounding CRISPR-Cas9 is that it's come at a time when "our 
knowledge of the genome is just at a fundamentally different place" than it 
was many years ago. She adds that a lot of progress has been made to combat 
potential off-target effects, like figuring out the exact right size of the 
RNA guides and which types of Cas9 enzymes to use. Meanwhile, Editas co-
founder Keith Joung has developed a tool called "Guide-Seq" to track 
instances of unintended DNA cuts. 
And as for delivering these treatments, Editas "isn't trying to reinvent the 
wheel," Bosley says. Rather, it's looking to proven delivery methods—at 
least initially. For the LCA program, it's delivering a CRISPR/Cas9 using 
adeno-associated virus, a delivery vector that has been used by a number of 
gene therapy companies. It could use other established delivery 
technologies, like lipid nanoparticles (often used to shepherd RNA 
interference drugs into the body) or electroporation (in which an electric 
pulse creates tiny holes in cells that allow drugs to gain entry). 
Still, delivery is "a critical challenge in this field, there's no question 
about that," she says. 
A patent battle between Editas and Doudna's group at UC Berkeley is also 
part of the mix. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office awarded the first 
CRISPR-related patent in April 2014 to the Broad Institute of MIT and 
Harvard for work led by the Broad's Feng Zhang (an Editas co-founder). The 
Berkeley group is fighting the patent, claiming it made the invention first. 
Doudna's work is licensed to Caribou, which in turn has licensed use of its 
technology for human therapies to Intellia. The work of Doudna's co-
inventor, Emmanuelle Charpentier, is licensed to CRISPR. And Doudna herself 
was an Editas co-founder, but as MIT Technology Review first reported, later 
cut ties with the company. When asked about the patent case, Bosley didn't 
give an update directly, but said that the company has a "broad portfolio of 
IP" that it's licensed in, and that it's developing patent applications from 
its own internal work as well. 
All of which is why the progress of Editas and its rivals will be so closely 
watched, and why the financing today marks such a noteworthy step for the
