Conditions, you would have rendered Services under the cancelled Assignment, multiplied by your 
daily pay rate for Services set forth in the applicable PO (collectively under this Section 5.3(b)(ii), 
the "Cancellation Feed). The parties agree that, if a daily pay rate is not specified in the applicable 
PO, Barton shall determine such daily rate in good faith based on the Fees set forth in such PO. 
5.4 
Effects.
(a) Termination of this Agreement or cancellation of any Assignment for any reason shall 
not release either party from any obligation or liability that: (i) has already accrued hereunder; (ii) 
comes into effect due to such termination or cancellation; or (ii) otherwise expressly or impliedly 
survives such termination or cancellation, which for the avoidance of doubt shall include those set 
forth in Section 3.2(a), Section 5.3(b) Section 7, Section 8, Section 10, Section ll, and Section 13. 
(b) Termination of this Agreement automatically cancels all Assignments, and 
cancellation in full of any Assignment automatically terminates the cancelled Assignment's PO. 
(c) Subject to Section 6 if Barton cancels an Assignment or if you cancel an Assignment 
under Section 5.3(b)(i), Barton shall remit any undisputed Fees then due and payable to you for 
Services you had provided for the applicable Client prior to the effective date of such termination or 
cancellation. You acknowledge and agree that this Section 5.4(c1 constitutes Barton's sole 
liability and obligation to you in connection with any cancelled Assignment, and under no 
circumstances shall Barton have any obligation to pay any Fees or other amounts to you for 
uncompleted portions of any Assignment. 
6. Financial Terms. 
6.1 
Lea Subject to the terms and conditions of this Section 6 as full compensation for 
your provision of Services and the rights granted to Barton under this Agreement, Barton will pay 
you the undisputed Assignment-specific fees negotiated and agreed to in each PO (the "Feed). Fees 
are paid from the amounts Barton receives from each applicable Client and, unless otherwise 
required by law or negotiated by you, on a per-Assignment basis. 
6.2 
Payment Terms; Invoices. Barton shall pay all undisputed Fees to you within fifteen 
(15) days of receiving an invoice or similar document (in paper, digital, or other agreed-upon format) 
setting forth the basis (e.g., per-Assignment or time) for your provision of Services (each, an 
"Invoice). On a weekly basis or as may otherwise be agreed, you shall complete all Invoices and 
submit such Invoices to the applicable Client for verification. Barton shall have no obligation to pay 
you any Fees unless Barton has received your Invoices verified by Client; provided that at its option 
Barton may elect to pay any undisputed Fees to you prior to satisfaction of the foregoing conditions. 
6.3 
Expenses. Unless otherwise agreed in a PO, you are responsible for any travel, 
lodging, mileage, and other costs or expenses incurred by you in providing Services. If agreed in a 
PO, Barton may arrange Standard Travel & Lodging (as defined below) accommodations or 
reimburse Standard Travel & Lodging expenses from the reimbursements or other payments Barton 
receives from the applicable Client; provided, however that you agree: 
(a) (i) you shall provide all documentation within fourteen (14) days of incurring such 
expenses; and (i) you shall be responsible and liable for any costs, fees, penalties, or expenses 
incurred or paid by Barton as a direct or indirect result of: (A) any damage to or loss or destruction 
of any travel implements, vehicles, or lodging accommodations, beyond reasonable wear and tear, 
caused by you or any of your Representatives; (B) your arranging any travel or lodging or incurring
