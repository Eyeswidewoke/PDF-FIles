Jeffrey. 
I have seen the photographs you sent, I understand your frustration but you are taking something in the wrong 
way. Please pay attention to this: 
I told Fancelli that we would be doing some changes when the paneling was finally installed, exemple, the 
location of the animals or the finish. My vision for that library was a very distressed old stained rough and 
sophisticated room. I understood or misunderstood that it was what you liked. It has never changed since the 
day I sent you a photograph of the model i prepared for you and at the same time i presented the one with the 
solomonic columns and Renaissance grills. You chose this one and at this point you thought it was extraordinary. 
You have to understand that the cost of producing this one compared to the original proposed is enormous and 
was absorbed by Fancelli. Now, if you have decided after seeing the room in situ that the finish should be a 
warm-golden-glow to a more even finish, I accept it because at the end it is what you like and makes you happy. 
There is some small holes unfinished or nails in the carved animals. It is definitely not important considering that 
Fancelli is fully aware of these items and they are in his punch list that I prepared for him when I was at the 
island last time. I did ask to Doug, your achitect, to provide me with a punch list but these items were overseen. 
I also mentionned to Fancelli the faux turtle application and he is fully aware that he has to fix it on his next trip. 
Regarding the hardware. I have no problem changing all of it for perhaps a more practical (Baldwin?) than the 
one i installed, which is a genuine replica of an 18th century "espagnolette". I would not recommaned it for a 
design purpose. 
When you mentionned to me the chicken wire, i would like to remind you that you saw in my office in Paris a few 
different samples of this bamboo woven net that you loved. Again, if you prefer the regular chicken wire - made 
out of metal - I have no problem changing it, although to my point of view it would be a downgrade. 
Fancelli is fully aware of all of this adjustments and his attention is to be there the 22nd in order to go through the 
final (if possible) punchlist with you and your architect, Doug. Regarding the finish, Fancelli will follow your strict 
orders as per the sample you want to provide. 
My intention, Jeffrey, is to finish the Library in a way that you will be proud and happy and will put back on track 
our good relationship after a very tough time i believe coming from all our intermediaries. 
I still believe this room is extraordinary and I wish i can see it one day all finished.
