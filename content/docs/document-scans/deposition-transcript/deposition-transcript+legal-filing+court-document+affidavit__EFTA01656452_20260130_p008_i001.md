Narrative 
not, were reneged on this morning. So uh, we are hoping it still can be a deal, but at this point the terms that I accepted are not 
agreeable, I want to retract the wire." 
The wire had been posted, and currency was exchanged. In order to reverse the wire, Schwab relayed to Mr. Kahn that it would be 
a "best effort" since the 30 minute window to cancel had lapsed. In the event Schwab was successful in reversing the wire, 
Richard Kahn agreed to assume any losses, but alluded that if there was a gain, he hoped he would receive the profit. 
Schwab was able to successfully retract the wire posted on 06/26/2019, and realized a ($113,527.80) loss after the currency 
conversion. The funds have been deposited back into brokerage account 41224708, registered as Southern Trust Company, Inc., 
on 07/10/2019. Richard Kahn indicated the wire for 11,150,000 Euro was sent prematurely, but that he may need to send another 
wire for even more to a different escrow account. This information was relayed during the conversations regarding the reversal 
request. 
On 07/04/2019, Schwab received a second international wire request, again signed by both Richard Kahn and Jeffrey Epstein; the 
request was to send S14,950,000 USD to Marc Leon located at Imm 
n 
The funds were sent to an account at Bank Julius Baer and Co. LTD located in Zurich Switzerland, reflecting an updated 
account number 
At the time of this request, the account did not have a balance to support the wire 
request as the retracted wire was still pending deposit back to account 41224708. 
Richard Kahn sent an email to Schwab five days later on 07/09/2019, asking to "please cancel this wire.' Once the retracted wire 
was posted to account 41224708 on 07/10/2019, Schwab made an outbound call to Richard Kahn where he confirmed he did not 
want the $14,950,000.00 wire to be processed. In addition, Richard Kahn asked the Schwab representative if future wire requests 
would require two signatures (note at this time Jeffrey Epstein was in jail). He indicated he would need to send more wires out 
soon 
Please see the attached CSV for detailed information pertaining to the outgoing wires.
