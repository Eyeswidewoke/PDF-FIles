Subject: 
tight schedule lets try a set time to speak 
Leon, you hired me to produce a work of art.=C2* it was not inexpensive. the value far exceeds any other piece in 
your collection.- by FAR . =lt took me 30 years to be able to craft such a work. I understand your desire to modifiy my 
work, =C24k in doing so you have brad telling me , just a bit more red., here let me show you,=C24k you yourself pick 
up a brush a add some strokes. you have=joslin spray water on it to maintain it. I vigorously complain that joslin in 
ruining my w=rk .. you describe me as zeus, i describe it as artist and a reaction to his work being ruined. however 
=m aware that you own the work and you have the right to paint over it. tear it up , put it in the closet in the basement . 
its you=s. 
I was told that Toms office is sending someone in ,or some people in, to review "some things." brad told me ,the 
partnership account=ng. I know absolutely nothing more than that. though bringing in his team was my idea . Having 
them review things without even asking for my input , or let alone my direction ,is ridiculous. but.. I guess you wanted to 
save money.? 
The audit has brought to the fore the lack of your=office quality that i have been violently squawking about. ie . 
=children playing with works of art.. It is inconceivable to me that*=A0 John castrucci is still there , joslin part time, 
but relied on .4,=A0 joe error prone and brad a corporate bandleader talking abo=t the office's finance team, 
accounting dept, and directing wendy to d= things that are clearly not in your interest. ( saving money ag=in ?) its 
nuts!! . a still non-existent IT dept. impossi=le , it was the first thing on my list of things that were needed to be done. 
=C2* Still no trading accounts to speak of , though its prophylactic quali=y has been discussed over and over during the 
past three years . computers do not read Page Six . the women at the IRS do. !4>=A0 you said your motivation in 
keeping this group of part timers was = consequence of the high cost of my artwork. . the urfortunate result was 
easily predictable. - now 
40=A0 If you want my and my atelier to continue, I will oversee the audits. take charge of the TRA BRH assignments 
and review 2012 amendment options!!( note :your redo of the=20 estate fire drill has not progressed very far ). Lots of 
paper needs=20 to be collected and reviewed, At MY direction. the outside team will be brought in at my expense 
working for me and you. coming=C240 in for interviews and reviews, . sucession, technology, tax and compliance. 
investment reporting „ computerized timelines for filings etc. .=C24k household classifcations and reporting with a 
system of best practices. <=r> My goal is clear • to end, not extend , our financial interactions. you will have a machine 
that works , it will not be complexto oversee , to create it,=20 is some thing else . Unfortunatley for us both, the price 
for =y works has not changed since day one. 40m per year, I m w=lling to discount it to 35 as I did give you a bad 
number when asked and=should pay an embarassment fine. Im also aware, as you made perfectl= clear . that you 
have already paid what you consider a great deal of=money, for my work, but again its value exceeds anything else by 
far in your collection at a cost less than agreed upon. . please also reme=ber that you and i agreed no more demands 
on my time after the last payment for the big transaction. 
OR, =ou can decide that brad , tom , and whomever else you choose can screw with my work and they can oversee 
your audits .=C24, they are both aware and sensitive to the issue at hand. alan c=uld be brought in but i would be 
extra careful having paul weiss given access to entire story.
