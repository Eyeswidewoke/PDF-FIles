—At the Perimeter Institute's "Quantum to Cosmos" Festival =n October 2009, a 
woman made a formal complaint of sexual harassment =gainst you. The institute immediately removed you from the 
premises and =anned you from ever coming back. 
I am not made =ware of any formal complaint of sexual harassment against me 
at =erimeter, which would have resulted in either formal proceedings or =etters or emails to me. I did attend the 
"Quantum to Cosmos =9D Festival for several days and was never 'removed from the premises'. =fter I left I received 
thanks and further assistance from the =taff. Nor was I banned from returning to Perimeter. I have =aintained a 
collegial relationship with various colleagues there who =ave invited me to return on several occasions. 
—Former =mployees of the Origins Project told us =hat the working 
environment sometimes made them feel uncomfortable, partly =ecause of your behavior, which they described as 
sometimes =nprofessional and juvenile. They called you a "sexist" =nd a "womanizer." 
In =articular, they described the following incidents: 
• 
In early 2016, after a transgender =anelist for an upcoming event 
negotiated a higher appearance fee, you =oked at a group meeting that "she's got balls," =wo witnesses said. 
During another meeting around that =ime, you showed off a vaguely 
suggestive doodle you had made of a woman =ent over, two witnesses said. 
"It was like being in a room =ith a 5-year-old and a 15-year-old boy at 
the same time," one =ormer employee said. "He had no filter." 
At a dinner =vent at the school's University Club in October 2015, a =9-
year-old undergraduate said she was left feeling acutely =ncomfortable when you looked at her from head to toe, 
smirked, and told =er that you liked the short jumper she was wearing. Two witnesses =onfirmed her account. 
In April 2016, another staffer =ngrily posted on Facebook about how 
you "suggested that I =hould dress up like a hula girl while advertising for an event." =/span> 
• 
Another =mployee was so upset by your behavior that she started 
keeping a =ritten record of offensive incidents. "Said he =nderstood why people didn't like to hire women of child 
bearing age =ecause it isn't fair to have to pay maternity benefit," she =rote in one entry. "Said he's going to buy me 
birth control so = don't get pregnant and inconvenience him. Asked if I was planning to =et pregnant." 
I am proud that =he Origins Project has been an open and supportive program 
since it was =reated. Our team works in a transparent environment of candor and =rust, where people can thrive and 
discuss all issues openly and frankly =ith mutual respect as part of a safe supportive team. Staff are =ncouraged to 
provide feedback and I and my managers have regular =eetings with staff to discuss potential problems and concerns. 
No =ne has ever has brought up complaints along any of these lines to any =f us, nor has anyone complained to the 
University in this regard about =ny such issues. Quite the contrary.
