Meanwhile, while the impasse continues, I'm compelled to face constant aggravating and painful circumstances, 
not to speak of humiliating demands and by now significant costs. That can end if we simply resolve these matters 
quickly in a straightforward and simple way. 
I haven't responded to the last part of your letter because it doesn1=;t relate to the matter at hand. I was 
referring to Max's radical sh=ft in stand, not to how affairs were managed in the past. To repeat, when distributions 
were made to family from the IRA, and taxes and manageme=t fees for the entire estate were drawn from the IRA --
exhausting the mandat=ry withdrawal -- Max, my lawyer, raised no question about the financial circum=tances of the 
beneficiaries, nor should he have done so. But when i am requesting tax payments from the marital trust that was set up 
for M and me and the survivor for our lifetimes, all of a sudden he is making exorbitant and humiliating demands. What 
you describe below has nothing to do with this simple matter.

Dear Doddoy, 
», Harry Chomsky 
We've tried to talk to you about your financial situation several times over the past couple of years, in person, 
by phone, and by e-mail. The process has been extremely unpleasant for us, and we presume for you as well. More 
importantly, it has not led to any enlightenment on any of our parts. Much of what we've tried to say you have flatly 
denied; some of it we think you simply haven't understood. You se=m absolutely convinced that your beliefs are correct 
and absolutely uninteres=ed in trying to look at the situation in other ways, to the extent that you can't even remember 
these exchanges. Much of what you've said=to us conflicts directly with our personal knowledge of your history and 
with legal and financial advice from every source we've heard from. So the conversations lead only to more stress and 
heartache. 
We are not willing to continue trying to discuss this with you unless somet=ing changes. One change would be 
to include a professional in the convers=tion who can resolve our differences in belief about basic facts. However, you 
have apparently decided that because you disapprove of some of the suggestions made by your former lawyer and 
financial managers -- many of which were based on choices you and Mommoy had made previously -- you will now not 
believe anything they tell you. That leaves us with no recour=e to determine the truth about anything that happened 
between 2007 and 2016.<=r> 
We have suggested a mediator as a last resort. Perhaps with a mediato= we can at least listen to each other's 
beliefs and perspectives, even i= we can't come to agreement on key points. Perhaps a mediator coul= even help us find 
a way to investigate the questions of fact and come to some conclusions that we could all accept. <=ont size="2" 
face="Arial"> 
Short of being able to talk to you openly, it's very important to the t=ree of us to protect you from future 
financial catastrophe. We have been trying our best to do this, and will continue to try, regardless of what happens with 
our communication. We believe that Eric Menoyo designed your estate plan properly to protect the interests of all 
parties, and we will continue to work to ensure that the plan is administered in a faith=ul and professional way. 
We also wanted to say that we have a different interpretation of how we have balanced respect, privacy, and 
autonomy, versus questions and interfer=nce, in our family history. You tell us that you deeply resent being asked
