America as the move could create new problems for him and his eldest brother King Charles. The Economic Times 
(02/04, Staff Writer), The Mirror (02/04, Jolly), and The Toronto Sun (02/04, Hunter) also reported on the story. 
The FBI Once Opened a Two-Year Investigation into the "Dirty" Lyrics of Tice Kingsmen's "Louie Louie" 
American Songwriter (02/04, Boisvert) reported that while there have been various recordings of the 1957 song 
"Louie Louie," the version recorded in the 60s by The Kingsmen is one of the most well known. The article pointed 
out that it's also the only version to spark an FBI investigation. The article explained that teenagers couldn't 
understand the lyrics, which led to them creating their own. According to the article, this caused an issue because 
the kids were now adding "dirty" lyrics to the song. According to Dick Peterson, who replaced the band's drummer 
in 1963, "We were on the front page of every newspaper saying that we were corrupting the moral fiber of the 
youth of America." The article highlighted that Peterson told NPR in 2023, "J. Edgar Hoover launched an 
investigation — they woke us up in the middle of the night pounding on the door: 'FBI, FBI!" The article added that 
the governor of Indiana banned "Louie Louie" after receiving complaints from two high school students who didn't 
like the allegedly "obscene" lyrics. The governor bought a copy of the record, listening to the song at different 
speeds to determine if the lyrics were, in fact, dirty. The article mentioned that according to a 2019 retrospective in 
the Indy Star, the govemor came to the conclusion that the song might be dirty, and contacted the FCC, who got 
the FBI involved. The article outlined that in the end, The Kingsmen testified in front of the FCC following the two-
year investigation by the FBI. According to Peterson, the judge asked to listen to the record. "And he thought, 'Why 
are you fighting over this? It's a piece of junk," Peterson said, adding, "And so he said, 'Listen, nobody can tell what 
it says. I'm going to deem it unintelligible at any speed, and lift the ban." 
FBI Employee, Whistleblower Loses Job After Years-Long Fight 
The Journal (02/04, Milbourne) reported that Teresa Tumblin first blew the whistle on discrepancies and unethical 
behavior within the FBI in more than 10 years ago, when she saw things done incorrectly within the National Name 
Check program, where she served as a quality assurance reviewer research analyst. According to the article, 
Tumblin reported the discrepancies with the team leader and supervisor and on up the chain of command to the 
director of her division. Her allegations led to an inspection of her unit and her identification as a whistleblower. 
The article indicated that Tumblin faced retaliation within the FBI. She was initially moved out of her position and 
has been passed up for promotions and performance awards, despite having been recognized as an outstanding 
employee prior to her coming forward as a whistleblower. The article noted that in a statement released this week, 
Tumblin shared that she has been terminated from her position with the FBI for "minor grammatical errors and 
spelling mistakes." The article detailed that after Tumblin's initial reporting, the DOJ investigated and reported 
reprisals occurred in her case in 2020. After the FBI made an argument following the release of the Office of the 
Inspector General's report of reprisal, it submitted a second report in 2022, which softened the tone but still 
reported reprisal had occurred. The article explained that Tumblin was granted a transfer to the Training Services 
Unit (TSU) in 2019 from research analyst GS12 to management and program analyst GS12. The article pointed out 
that Tumblin made another protected disclosure to Information Management Division (IMD) management and the 
FBI Inspection Division. She reported TSU for gross misuse of funds and mismanagement. She even went as far as 
to say the Training Services Unit could easily be dissolved into another unit that could result in a savings to the FBI 
of approximately $775,000 per year. The article stated that Tumblin noticed immediate hostility from the TSU team 
and management. On Aug. 23, 2023, she received a letter from the Inspection Division that the Internal Affairs 
Section mandated actions be taken to address the concerns raised in her complaint. The article highlighted that 
Tumblin was later notified that the FBI opened an investigation on May 21, 2024, for allegedly disruptive and 
unprofessional behavior and unprofessional conduct while on duty. She has not heard a thing from the Inspection 
Division since being notified, but she has been expecting special agents to raid her home any day. Tumblin was 
notified in October that she failed her Performance Improvement Plan (PIP), after which, on Nov. 7, she was placed 
on indefinite suspension with recommendation for dismissal. The article added that Tumblin was dismissed on Jan. 
30 for an unjustified failed PIP that she contends she should never have placed on in the first place. She was fired 
after 16 years of documented outstanding, excellent and successful performance for minor spelling and 
grammatical errors, she said.
