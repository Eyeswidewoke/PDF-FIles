In February, I met Moncef Slaoui, Glaxo's chairman of Global Research =nd Development, at one of the company's 16 
facilities he oversees =orldwide, this one in King of Prussia, Pa. Slaoui, who is 55 and has a Ph.D. in =olecular biology and 
immunology, was instrumental in developing the first malaria vaccine =nd is considered one of the most influential 
executives in the pharmaceutical =ndustry. 
"When =ris came to me in early 2012 with this idea of vagus nerve =timulation," Slaoui told me, "I was like: Cmon? 
You're gonna =ive a shock and it changes the immune system? I was very skeptical. But finally I agreed to visit =evin's 
lab. I wanted the data, the evidence. I don't like hot air." He =ent to Tak, the lead scientist for the trials. "I asked him, 
'Paul-Peter, is =t really real?'" 
After getting =n endorsement from Tak, who is now Glaxo's global head of immuno-inflammation research, Slaoui 
committed to financing SetPoint. =he investment was modest, though, because he felt that Tracey's =evice was "just a 
starting point. It was still very broad — you touch the vagus =erve, you touch most of your viscera. We had wanted 
something very specific." What he =idn't want was "the bulldozer approach" that characterizes already =xisting 
stimulators for treating Parkinson's, chronic pain and epilepsy. (Pacemakers =iffer because they stimulate muscle, not 
nerves.) These devices are indiscriminate, =lasting electricity into billions of neurons and hoping for the best. As Slaoui 
=aw it, SetPoint's stimulator was a primitive forerunner to "a =evice that reads your 
mobile.nytimes.com/2014/05/2=/magazine/can-the-nervous-system-be-
hacked.html?J=1&gwh=CAO1B525=89ABED1E295E68FDD9790E2&gwt=pay&assetType=nyt_now&referre=

electrical =mpulses and sees when something is wrong, then corrects what needs correcting." 
In 2006, =laoui continued, "when I became chairman of R. & D., R. =amp; D. was a liability to this company. We were 
spending lots of money and not =roducing new molecules for new medicines. I had to acknowledge that the current way 
=f doing R. & D. wasn't likely to be successful." Four years =ater, Slaoui put together a 14- member think tank and 
discussed, among other topics, the Human Brain =roject. The multinational endeavor, directed by the neuroscientist and 
Fulbright =cholar Henry Markram, at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne, =s trying to create a 
computer simulation of the human brain. That got =laoui "thinking about electrical signaling, an opportunity to make 
=edicine — a therapeutic intervention — that's super highly specific =n terms of its geographic position. I'm going to go 
to the nerve that goes to your kidney =nd nowhere else, and only to your left kidney, and to a particular area of the left 
=idney." 
That degree =f precision would address one of Slaoui's major criticisms of conventional drugs: They flood the body, and 
then doctors have to hope =hat they will perform only where they're supposed to. "It is =eally difficult to design a 
molecule that will only interact where you want it, because it goes =verywhere." The upshot, usually: side effects. 
Bioelectronics could potentially =liminate those, as well as the costly redundancy involved in the drug-discovery process, 
=n which every promising molecule must be independently evaluated. "There =s very little that is transposable from one 
molecule to the next," Slaoui =aid. "You have to redo everything." Bioelectronics attracted him, he says, because =E2 95 
percent of the hardware is the same," no matter what disease it treats. 
So Slaoui =ound himself working for a drug company while devoting himself to the idea of treating illness without drugs. 
In July 2012, he and Famm toured Markram's facilities in Lausanne. There Markram showed them a =-D digital 
visualization on a giant screen of 100,000 synapses actively firing in a =ouse brain.
