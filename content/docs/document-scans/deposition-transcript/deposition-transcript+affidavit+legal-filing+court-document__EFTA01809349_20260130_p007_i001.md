For example, in mid-August 2011, San Francisco transportation officials turned off cell 
phone underground service for several hours in order to maintain public safety by 
stopping a planned protest discovered on the Web site of a protest organizer.28 
Some in the United States compared the San Francisco transportation agency strategy 
of temporarily cutting off cell phone use to former President Hosni Mubarakbs strategy 
of cutting off Internet and cell phone 
services in order to quell protests by the Egyptian people.29 Other research indicates 
that Mubarak may have made a mistake in doing so. When Egyptian cell phone and 
Internet services were disrupted on January 28, 2011, unrest apparently increased 
instead 
of decreased. The cutoff caused more civilians to become aware and interested, while 
more people became involved in communicating face-to-face with greater street 
presence, and communication became more decentralized and harder to control than 
simply large 
gatherings in Tahrir Square.30 (In contrast to the situation in Egypt involving 
communication cutoff, the Libyan uprising may have been relentless largely due to 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization support for the rebels including strategic bombing, 
access 
to drones and other intelligence, and other assistance.) 
San Franciscobs local government determined that it had a legal right to turn off cell 
phone service on its property under a 1969 ruling by the Supreme Court in 
Brandenburg v. Ohio.31 In this case, the Supreme 
Court decided that a government may stop speech that could incite activity considered 
unlawful (beyond merely advocating violence).32 In 2011, mass violence apparently did 
not occur within San Franciscobs transportation system, but the local government 
believed 
that violence might possibly occur imminently if it did not cut off communication. Thus, 
even in America, as in Saudi Arabia, it is legal for a government institution to cut off 
communication in the interests of public safety and security if there is a chance 
that it could prevent protests that might possibly lead to violencebff“nstsre" be

Analogous to the Supreme Court ruling in Brandenburg, other nations including Saudi 
Arabia and India place restrictions on speech that may possibly be communicated to 
incite unlawful activitYretherbYs'xial
media or other means In mrd•20 11. for example, India issued Internet rules to strengthen secunty and place limits on information, including 
content that might be considered "insuSing' or "blasphemous' or 'harmful' to any country.33 Indian cyber cafC)s, Web 
sites, and search engines may be liable to the goyemment for any offending Internet content, including social media. According to the Indian 
government, its rules weigh security end freedom, deriving inspiration from laws in other democratic countries 34 
According to the deputy minister responsible for information technology and commumcabon, Sachin Pilot "We must draw a distinction between 
freedom of expression and freedom of expression with intent to harm or defame sompone."35 
Analogous to both Indian law and Me Supreme Counts holding in Brandenburg, under Saudi law, mainstream media (including the print media) 
and Internet sites (including blogs) are restricted from "damaging 
the countrybs public affairs or delivering insults to senior clerics, or -incrbno divisions between &fixers,' among other violations. 36 Also 
analogous to Indian law and the Supreme Counts holding in Holder v. Humanitarian Law Protect Saudi proposed laws 
pending in the Shuns Council would punish anyone who may be supporting terrorism by any means such as "harming the interests of the state" or 
'endangering national unity."37 
In Saudi Arabia, activism online hos thus far not created significant challenges to the Royal family or the rest of the government For example, a "day 
of rage Organized via social media, including Facebook 
fizzled out 3$ In any case King Abdullah has ensured that newspapers and by Implication social media have considerable freedom to Question 
religious clones, discuss the rights of women, report on police abuse, and so forth Thus, for example, religious. 
clerks may be criticized or questioned in public media or forums, but net personally attacked 39 
When foreigners aim to influence events under a particular nabonbs confrOt, whether by sou., media or Otherwise. that nation may take it upon 
itself to erne' Or repel such foreigners By further extrapolation
