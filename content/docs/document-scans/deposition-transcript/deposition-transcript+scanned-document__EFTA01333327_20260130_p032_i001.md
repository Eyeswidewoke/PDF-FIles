(Continued)
On March 31, 2005, Sgt.  
 requested that I set up a 
surveillance vehicle on El Brillo Way and conduct video surveillance 
of the front exterior of Epstein's residence. At 3:00 p.m., I set up 
a surveillance vehicle equipped with a video monitoring device. The 
surveillance vehicle was parked on El Brillo Way approximately fifty 
feet east of Epstein's driveway. The purpose of the video 
surveillance was to gather investigative intelligence by monitoring 
and recording all vehicle and pedestrian traffic entering and leaving 
Epstein's property. 
The video surveillance tapes were changed daily with a new Maxell 
T-160 VHS tape. Video surveillance was established for Epstein s from 
March 31, 2005 through April 05, 2005. On April 05, 2005, video 
surveillance was concluded. I reviewed the video tapes and advised 
Detective Pagan the surveillance videos yielded no evidentiary value. 
On April 01, 2005 at 9:30 a.m., I responded to the area of 358 El 
Brillo Way to meet with Town of Palm Beach sanitation employee, Jessie 
Jones. While parked in the area of 358 El Brillo Way waiting to 
collect Epstein s trash, I observed a white female, who I recognized 
as 
from her Florida driver's license photograph. I

. While parked in the area, I also 
observed Epstein s GMC Yukon truck leave the property as well as other 
vehicles arrive and park across the street from the property. The 
occupants of these vehicles appeared to be housekeepers, maintenance 
men, and gardeners. 
At 9:38 a.m., I met with Town of Palm Beach sanitation employee, 
Jessie Jones. I observed Jones enter the driveway of 358 El Brillo 
Way and collect the trash from Epstein s property.' I followed Jessie 
to a predetermined area at which time I collected the trash bags from 
the sanitation truck. I transported the trash bags to the sanitation 
department, where I sifted through its contents. I collected mail 
correspondences addressed to Jeffrey Epstein, automotive records and 
personal documents for Janusz Banasiak and Beata Banasiak as well as 
Jeffrey Epstein notepaper with the names and appointment times for 
mage and a 
No last names or other personal information was 
written on the notepaper. 
While sifting through Epstein s trash, I also collected a three-inch 
purple finger size object, which had a broken end. The object 
appeared to be a broke piece from a sexual toy similar to a (Cyclone 
Vibrator) possibly used for reciiimiratification. The sexual object 
was photographed for Detective 
, packaged in a biohazard evidence 
bag (possible body fluids) and secured as investigative evidence. All 
items collected from Epstein s trash were turned over to Detective 
for evidentiary purposes.
