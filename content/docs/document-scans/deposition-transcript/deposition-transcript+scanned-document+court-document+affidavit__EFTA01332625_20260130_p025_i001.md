policies of insurance. Grantor, upon request of Lender, will deliver to lender from time to time 
the policies or certificates of insurance in form satisfactory to Lender. In connection with all 
policies covering assets in which Lender holds or is offered a security interest for the 
Indebtedness, Grantor will provide Lender with such lender's loss payable or other endorsements 
as Lender may require. Grantor shall not use or permit the Collateral to be used in any manner or 
for any purpose excepted from or contrary to the requirements of any insurance policy or policies 
required to be carried and maintained under this Agreement or for any purpose excepted or 
exempted from or contrary to the insurance policies, nor shall Grantor do any other act or permit 
anything to be done which could reasonably be expected to invalidate or limit any such insurance 
policy or policies. 
21. 
Failure to Provide Insurance. Grantor acknowledges and agrees that if Grantor 
fails to provide any required insurance or fails to continue such insurance in force, Lender may 
do so at Grantor's expense. The cost of any such insurance, at the option of Lender, shall be 
added to the Indebtedness. 
Grantor acknowledges that if Lender so purchases any such 
insurance, the insurance will provide limited protection against physical damage to the 
Collateral, up to an amount equal to the unpaid balance of the debt. Grantor's equity in the 
Collateral may not be insured. In addition, the insurance may not provide any public liability or 
property damage indemnification and may not meet the requirements of any financial 
responsibility laws. 
22. 
Application of Insurance Proceeds. 
Grantor shall promptly (not to exceed 
seven (7) days) notify Lender of any loss or damage to the Collateral in excess of $50,000, 
whether or not such casualty or loss is covered by insurance. Lender may make proof of loss if 
Grantor fails to do so within fifteen (15) days of the casualty. Lender shall have the right to 
receive directly the proceeds of any insurance payable to Grantor on the Collateral; and the 
insurance proceeds shall be paid directly to Lender. If Lender consents to repair or replacement 
of the damaged or destroyed Collateral, Lender shall, upon satisfactory proof of expenditure, pay 
or reimburse Grantor from the proceeds for the reasonable cost of repair or restoration. If lender 
does not consent to repair or replacement of the Collateral, lender shall retain a sufficient 
amount of the proceeds to pay all of the Indebtedness, and shall pay the balance to Grantor. Any 
proceeds which have not been disbursed within six (6) months after their receipt and which 
Grantor has not committed to the repair or restoration of the Collateral shall be used to prepay 
the Indebtedness. 
23. 
Insurance Reports. Grantor, upon request of Lender, shall furnish to Lender 
reports on each existing policy of insurance showing such information as Lender may reasonably 
request including, but not limited to, the following: (1) the name of the insurer; (2) the risks 
insured; (3) the amount of the policy; (4) the property insured; (5) the then current value on the 
basis of which insurance has been obtained and the manner of determining that value; and (6) the 
expiration date of the policy. In addition, Grantor shall upon request by Lender (however not 
more often than annually) have an independent appraiser satisfactory to Lender determine, as 
applicable, the cash value or replacement cost of the Collateral. 
24. 
Notice of Encumbrances and Events of Default. Grantor shall immediately 
notify Lender in writing upon the filing of any attachment, lien, judicial process, or claim 
relating to the Collateral. Grantor additionally agrees to immediately notify Lender in writing
