The Associated Press (11/20, Golden) reported that the FBI arrested a 30-year-old Florida man named Harun 
Abdul-Malik Yener for allegedly plotting to bomb the New York Stock Exchange with a remote-controlled device to 
"reboot" the U.S. government. According to the article, the FBI began investigating Yener in February after

wake people up," and had rewired two-way radios to serve as remote triggers for explosives, planning to disguise 
himself when planting the devices. Additionally, the article mentioned that Yener was known to post YouTube

threatened to "go Parkland shooter in this place" at his former workplace. The FBI's investigation also revealed that
