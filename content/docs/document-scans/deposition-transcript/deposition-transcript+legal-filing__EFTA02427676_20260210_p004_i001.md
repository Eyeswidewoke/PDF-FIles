3. Were Post-Raid Publicized Arrests and Imprisonment of Rubashkin Warranted? 
Following the nationally publicized Agri raid, the Iowa federal prosecutors conducted an 
investigation of Agri. The sworn complaint on which the raid was based had acknowledged that Agri 
had screened job applicants and had, in fact, twice rejected an ICE undercover agent who tried to 
gain employment with false identity papers. Only when ICE provided him with authentic 
documentation was he hired. Rubashkin denied that he had knowingly violated the immigration laws 
and Agri retained Robert Kent to discuss the charges with the prosecutors. The prosecutors made 
arrests and filed immigration-law charges against various company employees. Most of these steps 
were accompanied by substantial local and national publicity. Counsel forAgri and Rubashkin was in 
regular communication with the prosecutors to attempt a resolution of potential criminal charges 
against Agri and Rubashkin. 
Although he was served with a letter identifying him as a larger of the investigation, 
Rubashkin himself remained in his Postville, Iowa, home during the almost six months following the 
raid. He made one trip to Canada to visit a sick friend and returned promptly to Postville. There is 
not a scintilla of evidence that he made any effort to flee. 
It was clear that Rubashkin would surrender voluntarily if notified of any charges, but the 
local prosecutors had him arrested without advance warning, to the accompaniment of great 
publicity, on October 30, 2008. Page A14 of The New York Times of October 31, 2008, for 
example, had a story headlined "Arrest Made in Iowa Plant Case" and a photograph - coverage that 
would not have appeared had counsel been requested, as is customary in such cases, to bring in his 
client to answer charges. 
An indictment charging one violation of the immigration laws was returned. At Rubashkin's 
bail hearing on the indictment, the prosecutors and the Magistrate Judge permitted him to be 
released on a $1 million bond and with an ankle bracelet and electronic monitoring. Individual 
employers charged in all other immigration-law prosecutions have been released either on personal 
recognizance or on the submission of a nominal bond. No other employer accused of violating the 
immigration laws has ever been restricted with an electronic bracelet or required to post a bond of 
$1 million. 
On the day following his release, the Iowa prosecutors had Rubashkin arrested again on an 
allegation that he had committed bank fraud after his first arrest. Their claim was that, in the routine 
certifications that Agri made to the St. Louis bank with which it had a $35 million line of credit, it had 
falsely represented that it was in compliance with the law when, in fact, it was harboring illegal 
immigrants, and that Agri had failed to deposit all checks it received from customers in the "sweep 
account" that was security for the bank loan and had temporarily used (but had subsequently 
reimbursed) money for a store and school in Postville that Agri was administering. 
Although there was no proof that the bank was actually misled by this conduct or that its 
loan, on which timely interest payments continued to be made even after the raid, was imperiled in 
any way, the Iowa prosecutors asserted that this conduct by Rubashkin constituted "non-
compliance" with the terms of Rubashkin's release on bail and asked that he be denied bail and 
imprisoned. 
Among other arguments for denying bail to Rubashkin, the prosecutors asserted that 
Rubashkin could flee to Israel because he is Jewish, although there was no evidence whatever that 
he had sought to travel to Israel. This same specious contention would justify the imprisonment of 
any Jewish person ever arrested on any charge. In his opinion denying bail, the Magistrate Judge 
accepted the Iowa prosecutors' claim regarding flight to Israel. 
Rubashkin spent the next 76 days in prison. No other individual accused of an immigration-
law violation and no other non-violent and non-threatening person charged with nothing more than 
having compromised the security of a bank loan that was otherwise being kept current has ever 
been denied bail prior to trial on such a charge unless he was apprehended while actually 
attempting to flee. 
4. Why Were Seven Superseding Indictments Filed With Inflated Allegations and a 
Forfeiture Demand? 
After a hearing held in January 2009, the District Judge found insufficient evidence to keep 
Rubashkin in prison as a "flight risk' and ordered his release pending trial. In the meantime, the 
Iowa prosecutors had begun ballooning the immigration and bank-fraud charges with a series of
