Noam — 
Thank you for your reply. As you indic=te that you are not being represented by counsel I will reply directly to 
=ou, with a copy to Rich (as you suggest). Please consider: 
1. 
As you know, Harry's attorney has comm=nced a legal action that is intended to facilitate my resignation 
and the =ppointment of a successor trustee to take my place. Since you've wanted me removed for some ti=e and since 
I've said (from the first time you and I met) that I o=ly wanted to serve as trustee if all the family members wanted me to 
serve= I'm looking forward to resigning as soon as the court determines how I am to do so and how my successor is to 
be selected. 
3. 
To the extent that you want to push forward wh=le I remain the trustee, let me again state the basis for 
financial disclo=ure by you. It is that, as trustee, I owe a duty to you and I owe a duty to your children (as the =emainder 
beneficiaries of the trusts). For the present my primary du=y is to you and it is to distribute to you all income earned by 
the trusts= net of expenses, and to distribute to you (or pay on your behalf) additional monies as reasonably needed t= 
the extent that your income from other sources is not sufficient to suppo=t your reasonable expenses. Notwithstanding 
your statement that "As for the claim about concern for my later years, that has been thoro=ghly refuted" it has not 
been refuted in the context of my trusteeship and it remains my=duty to consider distributions in light of the possibility 
that you will h=ve a reasonable need for distributions from the trust for many more years,=and perhaps in increasing 
amounts, depending on your circumstances in the future. 
</=pan> 
5. 
As for the specifics of disclosure, what I nee= to consider is (a) what your income was in 2017, since that 
was the basis=for the tax payments you seek to have reimbursed, (b) what your income is likely to be this year an= going 
forward, (c) what your expenses were in 2017 and are likely to be i= 2018, and (d) whether any of your income (or other 
resources) are being u=ed for purposes that the trust cannot support (such as gifts to third parties). So far, Rich has 
pr=vided me with some rough information about your 2017 expenses. There=are some gaps in that information, but 
nothing that can't be clear=d up pretty easily (I think). Rich has also assured me that you have not made any gifts that 
have diminished your resources an= I assume you would confirm that to me. What I don't have at this point is enough 
information about your in=ome, so that I can consider what the gap is between your expenses and your=income, which 
is the gap the trusts might help to close up. With res=ect to your income in 2017, all I can see is that your income tax 
obligations seem to be much higher than they were pre=iously. I'm assuming that reflects a jump in income from (i)=the 
profit made on the sale of the condominium, and (ii) large withdrawals=from your IRA. If you want to provide me with
