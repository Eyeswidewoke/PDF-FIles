After many road blocks of Ideas that I thought were going to work, I 
think what's going to have to happen Is that we'll unfortunatc4y have 
to speed up the testing of an alternative setup to the mpls network. 
One of the short term solution that ATT recommended was to setup a 
high gain antennae to connect to the cellular network and get about 
one meg to a meg and half so that we can test to see if we're able to 
engineer a solution that will still provide the services that users 
currently need. I thought about just getting a local provider on this, 
but most likely they'll usually want a at least an annual contract. 
There shouldn't be too much of an Investment and we wont be causing 
any interruption with current network services that are being 
utilized. 
If we can successfully come up with a new design that is agreed upon, 
and test it, the Idea would be to use the existing circuit that splint 
uses to bring service over and move forward with the migration from 
them. The only downside is that the power outage problem will still 
remain, however we can start there from getting in the necessary 
bandwidth. 
We may have to go back to looking at the wireless solution, but I know 
that given the time frame and the issues that will arise with that, 
hence pushing forward with the alternative setup to test the speed and 
network services of the cellular connection. I'm not convinced that 
this will be able to handle all of the need, but it will serve the 
purpose In the interim of moving forward. 
Let me know if we need to get together to discuss the options via conference. 
Roadblocks: 
The initial thought of extending the demark Is possible, and would 
allow a bypass to to the shutdown of services If there was an extended 
power outage. However, I was told that Innovative will not do it, 
even if we can split the channels of one of your circuits. However, I 
think if Cecile puts in a request, things may change on that end, and 
also in speeding up getting a new circuit if were to just go ahead 
with a connection from ATT without any wireless, but dont know the 
details on If that's possible. If Its not we're a bit stuck on 
getting another data connection in order to test out what we'll need 
to have in place in order to maintain current network services to then 
migrate from the current setup. 
One other option that I wanted to see was to we could get the LS) 
fiber Into the Char Am office in town where ATT's data connection 
comes Into the Island. This would have literally brought down the 
connection time frame Into weeks Instead of the estimated several 
months. We could then directly hook Into An Pipe, and we'd be good 
trim there for whatever capadty. Currently the fiber has a run only 
from one of Innovative's east end location out to the Island, and 
does not reach into town. This could be solved in that usually if 
we're able to get into their Nazareth location, they would be able to 
create a fiber musk and that would loop into their direct runs into 
Char Am, but once again this is what would be Incredibly costly and 
time consuming as this would have to bring In WAPA, permits, the whole 
nine yards of doing digging up the road. We could do an anal run, 
which would speed up the time, but the cost for this would still be 
high. 
there were two more thoughts, but they also were a no no. I think the 
best use of time now would be to see how we can get a temporary setup 
and go from there.
