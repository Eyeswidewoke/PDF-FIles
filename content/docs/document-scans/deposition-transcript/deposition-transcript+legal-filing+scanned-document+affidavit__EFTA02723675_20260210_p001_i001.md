Re: 
Oh I'm sorry Jeffrey, 
was very tired last night and probably a little 
overwhelmed and under prepared for the questions and wow of it all.. she was very 
sweet and very thankful with JoJo and probably felt in her own way she'd said 
thank you for the car. 
is staying downtown with her friends really but I'm 
very grateful for the apartment, there was rather a high octane energy at tea 
with lots touched upon but I was going to suggest to you yesterday afternoon when 
we met that there were a couple of things in the apartment that could do with 
being changed and I'd be happy to help organize any of it as a way to say thank 
you if it was useful. 
As for the Core club, I was just caught up in the excitement of the idea and 
didn't come from that more reflective place in the moment, I didn't want to say I 
appreciate it as that would have sounded like it was going to happen and I don't 
like being presumptious, but you know me if it were to happen I would have 
expressed how much I appreciate it, and in my own smaller - less grandiose way 
found a way to say thank you. Time seems to run away when I'm with you but 
please know you are adored! x

that 
, neither sent a thank you note, said thanks,or brought a cookie 
of a thank you. No matter what career she chooses. , and I woudl very much like 
her to succeed, and be fulfilled and independent. -- AS I told you years ago. 
concentrating on what you get as opposed to what you give „ is the English 
recipe for failure. Yes , I can organize the Core Club for you, for services, 
for facials. for most things, but not once did you say„" I would appreciate 
that". not once. not even thanks for tea.
