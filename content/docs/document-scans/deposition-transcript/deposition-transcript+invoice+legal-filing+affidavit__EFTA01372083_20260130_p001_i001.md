.oldings (continued) 
Generally, securities acquired before 201t in retirement accounts or held by Non-U.S. entities are not subject to the cost basis reporting rules set forth in the Internal Revenue Code of 
1988, as amended by the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, and are marked as " noncovered". Securities marked as "covered', were identified as securities potentially 
subject to the cost basis reporting rules and may be reported to the IRSon form 1099-Eifor the applicable tax year in which the securities are disposed. 
Note: In the event where we cannot easily determine the taxability of an account, we may mark the account as noncovered. However, if the account does not receive a 1099B, the cost 
basis will not be reported to the IRS. 
3 The cost basis of this security has been provided to us by you or your introducing firm and Pershing makes no representation as to the accuracy of thisinformation. 
12 Pershing has received updated cost basis information, therefore cost basis provided on previous client brokerage statements may differ from the new cost basis reported in this section.

Pricing 
This section includes the net market value of the securities in your account on a settlement date basis, including short positions, at the close of the statement period. The market 
prices, unless otherwise noted, have been obtained from independent vendor services, which we believe to be reliable. Market prices do not constitute a bid or an offer, and may differ 
from the actual sale price. Securities for which a price is not available are marked "Ni A" and are omitted from the Total.

Estimated Annual Figures 
The estimated annual income ( EA I) and estimated annual yield (FAY) figures are estimates and for informational purposes only. These figures are not considered to be a forecast or 
guarantee of future results. These figures are com puted using information from providers believed to be reliable; however, no assurance can be made as to the accuracy. Since interest 
and dividend rates are subject to change at any time, and may be affected by current and future economic, political, and business conditions, they should not be relied on for making 
investment, trading, or tax decisions. These figures assume that the position quantities, interest and dividend rates, and prices remain constant. A capital gain or return of principal 
may be included in the figures for certain securities, thereby overstating them. Refer to www.pershing.coml disclosures for specific details as to formulas used to calculate the figures. 
Accrued interest represents interest earned but not yet received. 
Reinvestment 
The dollar amount of Mutual Fund distributions, Money Market Fund dividend income, Bank Deposit interest income, or dividends for other securities shown on your statement may 
have been reinvested. You will not receive confirmation of these reinvestments. Upon written request to your financial institution, information pertaining to these transactions, 
including the time of execution and the name of the person from whom your security was purchased, may be obtained. In dividend reinvestment transactions, Pershing acts as your 
agent and receives payment for order now.
