give a speech, but that the event will convert to 'telerallies." Said Trump, "I just felt it was 
wrong. ... We didn't want to take any chances." 
Politico (7/23, Oprysko, 4.29M) reports Curry and Sheriff Mike Williams "reacted to the 
cancellation on Thursday with a clear sigh of relief," saying in a joint statement, "We appreciate 
President Donald Trump considering our public health and safety concerns in making this 
incredibly difficult decision," and adding that the President had "once again reaffirmed his 
commitment to the safety of Jacksonville Florida and the people of the United States of 
America." 
USA Today (7/23, Fritze, Subramanian, 10.31M) recounts that "Trump addressed 
reporters for the third time in as many days after announcing he would restart daily briefings 
on the virus that were suspended in April." The President "has used the high-profile sessions to 
tout efforts to spur vaccine production, encourage the wearing of face masks and warn that the 
pandemic is getting worse." 
The Washington Post (7/23, Itkowitz, 14.2M) refers to "the latest in a series of head-
snapping reversals" by Trump "in the face of a nationwide pandemic that continues to spread 
out of control," and adds that "the convention retreat came as polls continue to show public 
disapproval of Trump's handling of the pandemic," with Joe Biden "expanding leads in key 
battleground states and advisers pressing Trump to try to shift gears." Bloomberg (7/23, 
Egkolfopoulou, Korte, 4.73M), the Wall Street Journal (7/23, Restuccia, Lucey, Subscription 
Publication, 7.57M), the Washington Examiner (7/23, Lim, 448K), the New York Post (7/23,

announcement. 
US COVID Case Count Surpasses 4M. 
All three broadcast networks opened their Thursday evening newscasts with the news that the 
US coronavirus case count has passed 4 million. On ABC World News TonightVI (7/23, lead 
story, 5:00, 6.89M), David Muir marked the "difficult milestone," and said, "We had just hit 3 
million 15 days ago. ... More than 143,000 lives have been lost in this country. Tonight, the 
CDC now predicts there could be 175,000 deaths by August 15. Florida setting a record number 
of deaths in the past 24 hours, and more than 10,000 new cases." 
Norah O'Donnell said on the CBS Evening NewsVi (7/23, lead story, 4:00, 3.92M), "The 
US has now surpassed 4 million cases of coronavirus. That is a drastic increase of infections in 
just a few weeks that illustrates how rapidly the virus is spreading. To give you a sense of how 
fast cases are growing, it took about five months to reach 2 million cases in the US but only six 
weeks to double that number, and tonight for the second night in a row more than 1,000 people 
have been killed by the virus nationwide in just 24 hours. The CDC said today that death toll 
will only keep growing, projecting as many as 30,000 more deaths in the next three weeks." 
Lester Holt said on NBC Nightly NewsVi (7/23, lead story, 3:05, 5.52M), "It's becoming 
more and more likely that you or someone you know personally has been affected with 
coronavirus." NBC's Miguel Almaguer: "The new milestone reached today as a top health official 
sounds the alarm for 11 American cities in trouble after testing results came back from metro 
areas like Cleveland, Columbus, Minneapolis, and New Orleans. Dr. Deborah Birx warned local 
leaders they need to take aggressive steps to mitigate their outbreak." Birx: "We're tracking 
this very closely. We're working with our state officials to make sure we're responding together." 
Reuters (7/23, Shumaker) reports that on Thursday, "the total number of coronavirus 
cases reported in the United States passed 4 million...reflecting a rapid acceleration of 
infections detected in the country since the first case was recorded on Jan. 21." Reuters points 
out that "it took the country 98 days to reach 1 million cases, but just 16 days to go from 3 
million to 4 million," and "the average number of new U.S. cases is now rising by more than 
2,600 every hour, the highest rate in the world."
