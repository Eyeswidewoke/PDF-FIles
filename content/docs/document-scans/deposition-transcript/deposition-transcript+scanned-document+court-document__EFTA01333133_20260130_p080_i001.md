I located a telephone number for IMMEMMOWOMMand attempted to 
contact her on several occasions. I called 
nd spoke 
with Ms. — 
who advised she would speak with me in 
where she resides. Due to a scheduling conflict, we were unable to 
meet. I informed her I would contact her to schedule another 
appointment to speak with her about this investigation. I have 
attempted to meet with her and make telephone contact with negative 
results. 
On February 13, 2006, I met with David Rodgers at 7318 Heathley Drive 
in Lake worth: Rodgers was identified as Epstein's pilot. I spoke 
with Rodgers who advised he has been employed with Epstein since 1991. 
He flies both planes for Epstein depending where he wants to fly to. 
Rodgers was asked about passengers in the plane he flies. Rodgers 
stated unless Epstein flew to his island off of St Thomas, there would 
be no way of knowing who the passengers were. I mentioned a recent 
flight to Ohio, where Rodgers flew to Ohio to pick upaiiiblan. 
Rodgers stated he recalled flying on several occasions and did 
remembers 
Rodgers stated once he is in the cockpit, he does not 
know who the passengers are. When he prepares the passenger

and 
Rodgers stated he would list either female or male 
passengers on the manifests only to keep a count on the passengers. 
Mrs. Rodgers came into the living room and recommended that her 
husband consult with an attorney. Mr. Rodgers agreed he would speak 
with the family attorney to inform him of this questioning. I 
explained to Mr. Rodgers that he was not the suspect in this 
investigation and ceased all questions. Based on the fact Rodgers 
could not advise who passengers were in the plane, I then left the 
area.
