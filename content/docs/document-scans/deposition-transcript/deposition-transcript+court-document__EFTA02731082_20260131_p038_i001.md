she and her mother visited Epstein's Palm Beach residence multiple times. Mr. Alessi and his 
wife both picked

Mr. Alessi recalled that

In total, Mr. Alessi saw "hundreds" of girls at Epstein's Palm Beach residence, but he 
believed the majority to be in their 20s. Toward the last few months of his employment, Mr. 
Alessi began seeing younger girls, most of whom were brought to the residence by

recalls that Maxwell hired younger girls to come to the Palm Beach residence, including two 
girls whom Mr. Alessi knew to be in high school, but whose names he could not recall. Mr. 
Alessi believed most of the young women who came to the house to be professional masseuses, 
but he also recalled cleaning up after massages and finding sex toys in the room, which he then 
washed. Mr. Alessi also recalled that Maxwell kept a basket filled with sex toys in her room and 
that Maxwell was occasionally inside the massage room with the young women who came to the 
house. 
Mr. Alessi also recalled more generally that many young women would be topless or 
naked by the pool. At the very end of his tenure, Mr. Alessi told Epstein that he should slow 
down, that "these girls" would get him in trouble. Epstein remarked that it was fine, and that 
"these girls only care about money." When Mr. Alessi left Epstein's employment, Epstein told 
him: "I hope you keep your mouth shut."
