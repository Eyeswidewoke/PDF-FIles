World Outlook 2016: Managing with less liquidity 
Europe: Not a global engine 
We expect euro area GDP growth to be broadly unchanged at 1.6% in 
2016 and to slow in 2017. The global recovery will be less supportive than 
we previously thought. This year's stimulus from lower oil prices won't be 
repeated and probably reverses in 2017. Joint monetary and fiscal policy 
will help compensate in 2016 but not in 2017. 
Broad financial conditions should start 2016 easy before tightening into 
year-end. The output gap will gradually narrow even with these modest 
rates of GDP growth and past euro depreciation is starting to become 
more visible in inflation. By end 2016, the ECB's medium-term headline 
inflation projections should be at levels consistent with a tapering 
discussion. While refugee and security-related public spending is likely to 
see fiscal policy relax next year, we expect compliance with fiscal rules to 
improve in 2017. 
Political uncertainty is likely to rise into 2017. The refugee crisis has 
created frictions but the common threat to security may unify Europe and 
reduce the risk of local political events — Greek debt relief negotiations, 
Portugal's minority government, Catalonia's independence bid, the UK's 
EU negotiations — from undermined area-wide stability in 2016. The unity 
won't last into 2017. The closer we get to the Dutch, French and German 
elections in 2017 —Italy may bring forward its election into 2017 too — the 
more disharmonious the EU is likely to sound. This will weigh on structural 
reform, and market may take notice. 
• 
Despite fiscal austerity, a strong currency and maybe some EU 
referendum-related uncertainty, UK GDP growth will be no worse than 
trend in 2016, helped by robust private consumption. Inflation base effects 
will push inflation back up and we continue to see the Bank of England 
achieving rates lift-off in May. The referendum vote could be as soon as 
late next year. According to opinion polls, the outcome looks closer than 
the last referendum in 1975 when 66% voted to remain in the EU. 
The EMEA region is a case of contrasting paths. CEE is characterized by 
decent growth with little or no inflation and scope to ease further if 
necessary. The economies elsewhere in EMEA are either experiencing 
recession or faltering growth but high inflation affords little if any room to 
provide offsetting policy support.
