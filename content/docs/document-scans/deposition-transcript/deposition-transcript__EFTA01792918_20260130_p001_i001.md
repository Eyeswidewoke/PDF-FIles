Re: .. 
I understand that you want to do better for me, but you should understand what is better firstly. Its like feeding 
someone who like oranges very much but have a severe allergy on them. I appreciate your help very much, you taught 
and showed me a lot. But you can't change me. 
Excuse me for being not happy as you used to see those babydolls, excuse me for not answering your emails on time 
because'. very busy", and for being looking "like a shit" when I came to you, etc... Yes. young but 
not that 
stupid Jeffrey, and I know what do usually mean and usually doesn't. I know what you expect from me Jeffrey but I will 
not say that, not for me. Sometimes its better say "darling El beautiful bitch who comes to your house and and you like 
me, everybody likes me and I love myself and you also. I am in troubles darling transfer me money sweetheart you can't 
say no you are a gentleman"!? 
Yes? Successful yes? Yes. I see it everyday and how it works, and I had a lot of opportunities to say that by myself to a lot 
of people, believe me. Of course they also tell "you babygirl are going to go with me at my place I will fuck you twice you 
will suck my cock and I will have your ass three times" ! Gosh how good it works. All right, Jeffrey. You have a lot of 
them. Go ahead. Know that I was that one who never did something for you when she didn't want to. And never 
expect" something back, believe me if I had an opportunity I would never take money from you when • 
going home. 
Sorry, 
not used to this world. 
not your daughter for you to deal with my problems, and this is all my fault I chose 
it myself, me was not working, me was taking money from friends and enemies just because no choice was seen at that 
moment. But it will be seen, I believe. Can't see the reason to delay my ticket, it should be better to bring it back. Can't 
see the reason to meet me the second day.. not a toy Jeffrey, thank you ...
