This requires some consideration 
The str=ng of letters explains a lot of the dynamic that has been going on for too=long and I don't think this is healthy for 
Noam. The whole situa=ion is totally outrageous and Deborah seems to be strictly following Max&#=9;s agenda, 
although being paid by us and now by you (this was the reason = wanted to verify more carefully her invoices and what 
she was charging us=before paying all the invoices she submitted to us -- one of them includin= hours for studying how 
to revert copyrights transfer of one book (Who Rul=s the World) the only one that Noam has legally transferred to me). 
=s this representing Noam -- to revert the one book a husband has decided t= put under his wife's name and charge us 
for that? Very strange.=C2.

You seem to have misread my letter. I m=ant it exactly as I wrote it. I was providing you with information t=at I thought 
you should have. There is absolutely nothing personal a=out it, and it has nothing to do with our personal relations. 
You may=be misinterpreting one comment: about the loan from the trust. It Hs true, as I wrote, that I regarded that as 
a personal, not legal, matter= But it has nothing at all to do with our personal relations. =C24,Rather, as I tried to 
explain, I wou=d never have accepted a loan from within the family if I had understood wh=t was happening. To repeat, I 
assumed that it would be for a few weeks or =t most months, until the Lexington house was sold and I would pay back 
the=loan and as much of the mortgage I chose to. I was willing to accept=it as a temporary, very brief, expedient. I 
would never have agreed =therwise. I did not know that I did not own the Lexington house, and=that I was being 
advised to buy an expensive apartment that I could not po=sibly afford and to do so with no assets to pay for it. It is 
quite =tear that that made no sense at all, even apart from leaving me with a loa= that I would never have agreed to had 
I been paying attention to the fact= instead of relying on advisers. 
I looked back over the correspondence, and I =idn't find any efforts to provide me with different evidence, either a=out 
this (which seems completely straightforward) or about the other thing= I mentioned, like the strange practice of 
distributing half of the requir=d withdrawal from the IRA to family, and therefore (with taxes, Wellfleet,=management 
fees for the whole estate) reducing the funds from the IRA to z=ro before I paid expenses for Alex's medical fees and 
before I had any=hing to live on, with the serious tax consequences that entails for furthe= necessary withdrawals along 
with rapid depletion of the one substantial s=urce of income, there being almost no pension. That's just arith=etic. I 
don't see what the counter-evidence could be. 
=br> 
I don't know where you are getting information from..=A0 I haven't seen anything that suggests that what I have been 
writing=to you is incorrect. If you have received information showing that w=at I wrote is wrong, I'd surely want to see 
it. As I wrote= once I found out about the seriously mistaken advice I was receiving, and=the practices concerning the 
estate, I began looking at these matters clos=ly to understand the circumstances, which I will henceforth deal with.
