Re: 
i did not see 
fun time in any of this, have you caught the seat=le disease.. a childrens story„ a fairy princess , 
lives in a d=ngeon , in a rainy dark environment, surrounded my unimaginable riches,=A0 she flys so fast, with narrow 
eyes,  only stopping to refuel. th=t she never has the time to laugh.

Hi there 
I don L-=3 really have any interesting projects like this going, I have always jus= wanted to. I've 
been making small stories only for my direct family a=d nothing beyond that! 
I am just back from Uganda so my schedule is a little weird this week =ut perhaps a good thing for you to do 
might be to think about what your sc=edule looks like and how much you are willing to travel to try to do somet=ing like 
this. I understand that Jeffrey will be supporting you in this pr=cess, so perhaps talk to him too about what might be the 
right fit for you= 
Traveling with me is probably not a good idea because I don't real=y have "down" time and usually blow through 
a city slum and gove=nment offices pretty quickly - however I do have great friends and associa=es in many cities around 
Africa and Asia. What I envision might be for you=to visit some of the world's most amazing places not as a tourist, 
but=as a learner. You might spend a few days wandering around and talking to r=gular people and asking them what 
stories they tell their children at nigh= and what legends have been passed on from their parents and 
grandparents.=/div> 
In Africa, it is more about tribe than country. I would suggest that y=u spend time in Dar, Harare, Rabat-Sole, 
Durban, Kampala, Cape Town, and m=ybe even Lilongwe. You'd hit several of the major tribes in these plac=s and I know 
plenty of folks in these places that would take great care of=you. Some would likely even require you to stay in thier 
homes and be part=of their family. That beats a hotel any day! Asia is great too. You could =o 100 stories just in China. 
But I would say that Danang, Siem Reap, Rango=n, Mumbai, Kathmandu and maybe Delhi would offer some great tales. 
It might be fun to do three "volumes" - Asia, Africa and Lat=n America. You could also get fancy and do Island 
stories too...those are =ome of the best! Fiji, Hawaii, Madagascar, New Zealand, Vanuatu, Sri Lanka= Maldives...all have 
these wild, wild stories about how their island is th= center of the universe.... 
So this is something that could consume your life! In order to see all=of these cities, you would want to plan well 
in advance. Weather (storms) =s usually the main thing I try to plan around. I like Africa in November-J=nuary and south 
Asia in December. China is best in the spring. The islands=are always risky but usually have a solid dry season. To give 
you an examp=e of how to budget time and money, I would say that a 10 day trip to Afric= is about $15,000 if you stay 
at business (not super fancy) hotels and tra=el business class. A 10 day trip to Asia is probably a tiny bit less. You =ould 
need 5 days for each city (give yourself 2 for travel and 2-3 to ha=g out). Tourist visas generally take about 2 weeks to 
process unless you g= stand in line at the consulate, then it's more like 2 days. Each one =osts on avergae of $100 USD. I 
can make the contacts for your visits but y=u will have to feel empowered and brave on your own too!
