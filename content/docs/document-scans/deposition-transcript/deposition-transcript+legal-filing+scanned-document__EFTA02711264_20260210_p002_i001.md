impulse happened then. In any event, the present instant is the plane upon which the signals of all being are projected.al This 
instant, the interval, constitutes all that is directly experienced. It was for man the abstraction, his AchillesaTM heel. 
In this evolutionary stage, a stage beyond space and time, the interval is closed forever, and man ceases to exist. 
Man ordered his experience in terms of psychological considerations of the nonexistent mind. But the ordering of experience 
is always on the here-andnow level. The interpretation of the ordering is always at the there-and-then level. Be aware that the 
brainaTMs operation is a continuing activity of ordering in the here-and now. There was always ordering in the here-and-now 
while man deluded himself with considerations there-and-then, considerations of a world that didnaTMt exist. A world that 
never had existed. The world of the past. A fractional instant, and yet the past. Because of that interval man was able to exist. 
Man, a relic of the instantaneous past. Man, an instant too old to exist. Things not existent should be of no interest to us. All 
those things rendered unto man are based on a system that deals with illusion. The interpretation of the ordering of the brain 
takes place while new ordering is continually happening. It is almost as though there were two parallel planes. 
Almost. We might even assume there was a choice between living in one plane or another. Actually, there is no choice. There 
is no choice. There is only the ordering and arrangement, the here-and-now. Some of us, most of us, cannot recognize this 
level and continue by blindness, by inertia, by pretension, the delusion that we are men. ItaTMs a mistake. Man is dead. Man 
never existed at all. Our awareness as experience is past experience. Dreaming. 
Man is dead. ItaTMs a world of information. Information in this context refers to regulation and control and has nothing to do 
with meaning, ideas, or data. arrAny system is said to be able to receive information if when a change occurs the system is 
capable of reactions in such a way as to maintain its own stability.ii4 Information is nothing but an abstraction. As an 
abstraction it will allow for new observations and associations, for discernment of patterns and organization. Note that the 
reference is to a reaction to change. The concern here is only with the reaction, the effect. Information is a measure of the 
effect. This refers to how the control center of the organism, the brain, reacts to change in order to maintain continuity. 
We are dealing with activity integrated on the neural, the brain level, i.e., the present. Thus, when discussing information, we 
are talking about the brainaTMs response in terms of present, direct experience. This response is always effected without 
consent or awareness. There is no choice. There is no information unless there is a change. aeelnformation does not exist as 
information until it is within the higher levels of abstraction of each of the minds and computed as such. Up to the point at 
which it becomes perceived as information, it is signals. These signals travel through the external reality between the two 
bodies, and travel as signals within the brain substances themselves. Till the complex patterns of traveling neuronal impulses 
in the brain are computed as information within the cerebral cortex, they are not yet information. Information is the result of a 
long series of computations based on data signal inputs, data signal transmissions to the brain substance, and recomputations 
of these data.r Information is an abstraction to be used for measuring the communication of pattern, order, and neural 
inhibition. 
What is the information from an electric light bulb? No information. What is the information from a book? No information. 
keTo speak of a change as giving information implies that there is somewhere a receiver able to react appropriately to the 
change, Be concerned only with the changes in the operations of the receiver, the brain, in terms of the transactional 
present. Do not confuse information with signals or the source of signals. keThe mind of the observer-participant is where 
the information is constructed, by and through his own programs, his own rules of perception, his own cognitive and logical 
processes, his own metaprogram of priorities among programs. His own vast internal computer constructs information from 
signals and stored bits of signals.117 Information is a process. There are no sources of information; there are no linear 
movements of information to the brain.
