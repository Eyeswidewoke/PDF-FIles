First 
I needed 800 k we had made a earlier budge= months ago that showed - if we opened months ago -I 
could have made it wit= 750k - david kept using this budget - I let it go 
What david did not share with you is that because=of such a late opening - I have given him an 
additional budget -of a loss o= 175k to get us to march - tmi - but opening so late gives you zero momentu= into first 3 
months of 2018 
This has still not ben addressed 
Because david has told everyone months ago we would have=the needed funding - we where told to 
start to ramp up - which increased pa=roll - I put the brakes on. From additional employees since zero funds ha=e come 
in - we need another 20 +employees to train and be ready to serve gu=sts- a 3.4 week process 
Jeffrey- this is where david just lies
