When an indi=idual transfers title or possession of property to a trust, a transfer has=been made to a separate entity. 
See TSB-A-99(22)S. This is true even in the case of a grantor trust =r a revocable living trust. Id. If there is consideration 
given in any form in connection=with the transfer, a retail sale of tangible personal property occurs and =ales tax is 
imposed. Id. Even though such a transfer may be a non-event for income=tax purposes, it will still be a sale under the 
sales tax as long as it is=made to a separate entity. See TSB-A-06(8)S. 
Petitioner c=ntends that the terms of the trust agreement do not allow the exchange bet=een the Settlor and Trust to be 
supported by consideration. The Settlor alone, in a non-fiduciary capacity, decides whether to exercis= the Power to 
Reacquire and what property will be substituted. The Trustee= have no power to consent or agree to the substitution. 
Under these terms,=the Petitioner contends there is no negotiation or bargaining between the parties and the exchange 
is not s=pported by consideration. 
However, a t=ansfer to a trust does not require negotiation to be supported by consider=tion. See TSB-A-99(22)S; see 
also 20 NYCRR 526.7(a)(3) (definition =f sale includes involuntary transfer). As long as the individual receives =omething 
of value in the transfer, consideration is present. Id. Because Petitioner plans to transfer tangible personal property =o 
the trust and receive other than tangible personal property of equivalen= value from the trust in return, this transaction 
is a sale for sales tax =urposes and, unless some other exemption applies, the sales tax will be imposed on the value of 
the prope=ty received in the exchange. 
Sales tax is=imposed on retail sales of tangible personal property. See Tax Law § 1105(a). A "retail sale" is defined, in 
pa=t, as sale "for any purpose other than . .. resale as such....&qu=t; Tax Law § 1101(b)(4) . Petitioner's initial purchase 
of the tangible =ersonal property that is to be transferred to the trust may qualify for the resale exclusion if Petitioner 
intended at the time th= property was purchased to transfer it to the trust for consideration. See Matter of D.J.H. 
Construction v. Chu, 145 AD2d 716 (3d Dep't 198=). However, to establish that he purchased the property for resale and 
the=eby qualify the purchase for the resale exclusion, Petitioner must "s=ow that (the property) was purchased for one 
and only one purpose: resale." Matter of the Petition of P=H Fine Arts, Ltd, Tax Appeals Tribunal, October 13, 1994, 
confirmed 227 AD2d 683 (3d Dep't 1996) (petitioner's purchase of art=ork does not qualify for the resale exclusion 
because petitioner displayed=the artwork before reselling it). Although not determinative, later activi=ies may be 
relevant to ascertain Petitioner's intent at the time of sale. See Matter of D.J.H. Construct=on, supra.
