going to payment of taxes and management fees on the entire estate. In addition, close to $100,=00 was going to 
expenses for Wellfleet and Alex's medical expenses. Hence before I withdrew a penny for daily life, I was already far 
over the mandatory withdrawal, which, by law, imposes exorbitant taxes that I also had to pay. You can work out the 
arithmetic for yourselves. And you will recall I'm sure that when I requested that some of the tax=s be covered by the 
marital trust (which, by rights, I should have full acces= to), Harry refused unless I submitted to extensive and highly 
intrusive financial analysis, which of course I refused to do on principle. There was never a request for such financial 
analysis when distributions were made to family, or when Max distributed funds to family from the marit=l trust, or for 
any other gifts over the years. And I saw, and see, no reason why I should be subjected to this humiliating demand. 
In addition, as I've repeatedly explained, I bo=ght the apartment in the Cambridge co-op on the erroneous assumption 
that the cost would be covered completely and quickly by the sale of the Lexington house. If I'd paid attention instead 
of just trusting advisers, I would have known, as they did, that I did not own the Lexington house and that the profits 
would go to you, so I was buying an expensive apartment in a co-op with no assets at all, a crazy decision. As I wrote, I 
agreed to the surreal idea of borrowing money from within the family (with interes=) only on the false assumption that 
the loan would be for a few weeks or months, hence meaningless. 
That's the "impoverishment," and I t-=;ve now pretty much overcome what had been done. 
All that keeps me from being "happy and relaxe=" is your continued insistence on pursuing these matters, which, again, I 
don't understand. 
You have even felt the need to hire multiple lawyers t= threaten people who you had trusted for years, and who we 
believe have continued to do their utmost to act in your best interest and to help you navigate your new financial 
situation. 
Again, I'd be interested in=knowing your source for these claims. You're quite right that for years I had (quite 
mistakenly) trusted people who, it turned out, had been making decisions, such as those I have again reviewed, that 
were quite harmful to me. It is hard for me to comprehend how you think they would act in my best interest and help 
me navigate the financial difficulties that they had created in the light of what I have explained to you, repeatedly. And 
as I've written, that's only a part of it. I mentioned th= tens of thousands of dollars we paid Max for such things as a will 
so outlandish that we had to trash it at once (see my last letter). And there is quite a lot more. I don't understand why 
you completely disregard the detailed and fully accurate information I have once again reviewed, and choose instead to 
rely on what you are told by others. And as I mentioned above, there has been serious wrongdoing, now coming to 
light, which you will find out about in due course. 
We have in fact found your letters over the past year increasingly alarming= If we felt that you were stable and content 
in your new life, we would probably accept the distance that has been created. But your statemen=s, in person, and in 
your letters, do not give us the impression that you feel stable and content. 
I have explained before, and will repeat again, tha= I am very stable and content in my new life, and looking forward to 
the peace, tranquillity, work and life conditions that I think I have a right to enjoy after many years of hard work and 
with ample attention to caring for the needs of my children. There was a financial problem caused by extremely harmful 
decisions of advisers that I had trusted, but that'=s now pretty much overcome. What's causing extreme distress is your 
insistence, which I don't understand, on pursuing the matters we are no= again discussing. 
One matter that remains is that marital trust.Q=A0 I explained what has been happening in a letter that you seem again 
to have ignored, and won't repeat the full details. In brief, Max ha= concocted an interpretation that is technically legal 
but that clearly makes no sense at all. It is based on the outlandish idea that Mommoy and I had decided to split our 
assets so that she would make decisions about allocation of her part and I would make decisions about allocation of my 
part. The idea is insane, and never occurred to either of us..C2* Max's weird interpretation is based on a pure 
technicality: namely, in setting up the trust in M's name for tax purposes, the funds were first assigned to her revocable 
Trust and then to the Marital Trust. That Trust was, of course, intended for the use of the survivor -- which is, for
