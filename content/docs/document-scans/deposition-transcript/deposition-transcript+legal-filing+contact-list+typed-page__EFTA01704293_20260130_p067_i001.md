among Features and Charges on your Account in any order and manner determined- by us in our sole discretion. Finance 
Charges: Average Daily Balance (ADB) Method for Calculation of Finance Charges (FC): We ause the ADB 
Method to calcuiate FC on your Account. Under this method, we figure the FC on your Account by applying the Daily 
Periodic Rate (DPR) to the ADB (as described below) for each Feature (inducting current transactions). Different daily 
period° rates may be applied to separate Feature balances. To get the ADB for each feature, we (1) take the beginning 
balance for each day Oncludng unpaid FC from previous billing periods) (2) add any new transactions, debits, or fees, (3) 
subtract any payments or credb, and (4) make any appropriate adiustmenta. For each day after the first day DPR 
billing 
period, vie also add an amount of interest equal to the previous daya daily balance multiplied by the 
for the 
Feature. This gives us the daily balance for the Feature for that day and the begs 
balance for that Feature for the next 
day. If this balance s negative, it is considered to be zero. Then, we add up ail nning. 
the daily balances for the Feature for the 
billing period and divide the total by the number of days in the biting period. This gives us the ADB for the Feature. If you pay 
the New Balance on this statement by the next Closing Date, then you will avoid additional FC on features included in this 
New Balance. If you multiply the ADS for each Feature by the number of days in the billing period and the DPR for that 
Feature, the result will be the FC assessed on that Feature, except for variations caused by rounding. The total FC for the 
bifingiceriod is calculated by addng the FC assessed on all Features of the Account This method of calculating the ADS 
and FC results In deity compounding of PC Transactions Made In Foreigntl.

foreign currency, it will be converted info US dollars on the date it is processed by us or our agents. Unless a particular rate is

rate we use for a Charge in a foreign currency is no greater than (a) the highest official conversion rate published by a 
government agency, or (p) the highest interbank conversion rate identified by us from customary banking sources, on the

in effect on the date of your charge. Charges converted by establishments (such as airlines) will Bill:baled at the rates such 
establishments use. Billing Rights Summary:  In Case of Errors or Questions About Your il
