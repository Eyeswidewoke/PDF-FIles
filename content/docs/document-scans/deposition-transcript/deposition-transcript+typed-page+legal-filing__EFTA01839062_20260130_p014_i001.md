Rousselot's investigation, said that DSK was implicated in a prostitution case that involved, 
among other things, transporting prostitutes to Washington DC. If it turned out to be true that 
DSK could be involved in a Washington prostitute ring, releasing him on bail could embarrass the 
DA's office, especially if he fled. 
There indeed may have been more than one phone call from Paris. At the bail hearing the next 
day, according to the court transcript, McConnell requested that Judge Melissa Jackson hold DSK 
without bail, explaining in an apparent reference to the communications with Paris "we are 
obtaining additional information on a daily basis regarding his behavior and background. " He 
continued "Some of this information includes reports he has in fact engaged in a conduct similar 
to the conduct alleged in the complaint." He added that these reports were as yet unverified but 
he did not specify who was supplying his office with these reports on a "daily basis" less than 2 
days after DSK's arrest. But if it concerned DSK's activities the W Hotel in Washington DC 
earlier that week, it raises the question of how the French government. or whoever was supplying 
the reports. obtained such up to date intelligence on DSK's private activities in Washington. 
For their part, the prosecutors now strongly deny that this information from France was the 
decisive factor in their opposing bail. Their principal concern, according to a source in the 
prosecutor's office, was that DSK, if released on bail, might use his connections to flee to France. 
But whatever shaped the decision, Judge Jackson acquiesced and denied DSK bail . 
The prosecutor's opposing bail had two immediate consequences. First, DSK was imprisoned 
on Rikers Island for 4 days (at which point another judge granted bail.) Second, it triggered a 
relatively-brief clock for the prosecutors. New York state law required the prosecution to gather 
evidence and present it to the Grand Jury within 144 hour, . This rush resulted in a presentation 
before all the facts could be assembled. For example, within that period, the prosecutors had not 
yet obtained electronic key swipe records. When they did the following month, it cast a very 
different light on the case. 
The reasons that the prosecutors may have been willing to risk this rush to judgment is, as the 
District Attorney publicly stated, it was assumed that there was a solid case against DSK. After 
all, preliminary DNA evidence established that DSK had a sexual encounter with Diallo. The 
semen stains, moreover, placed it in the presidential suite in the area she described to the police. 
DSK nor his lawyers had denied it had occurred. Instead, they send it was not forced. So the only 
legal issue was whether or not it was consensual. That would be up to a jury to decide. And as is 
common in sex crime prosecutions, its verdict would depend heavily on the credibility of the 
prosecution's only real witness. If the jurors believed her beyond a reasonable doubt that force 
was used, he would be convicted. And, as far as her credit ability went, they believed that they 
were on strong ground. The initial police investigation had turned up noted flags" in Diallo's 
background. She had, for example, never been arrested or accused of a crime. Although she had 
entered the US under an alias (as do many refugees), she had been granted political asylum by the 
US Immigration Court. Diallo had worked for the Sofitel for three years without any reported 
problems and was described by her supervisor as a "model employee." And while she was the 
only witness to the attack itself, two other hotel employees, the room service waiter and the head 
housekeeper had given police statements that supported her story (although, as it later turned out, 
these witnesses had the opportunity to hear Diallo's tell her story in the security area before the 
police were called in.) When the prosecutors went to court on May 15", and argued against bail, 
they assumed they had a credible witness. 
She also impressed them subsequently with the vivid account she gave of experiencing a
