made no attempt to alter his direction and in fact came as close as 5-7, feet crossing in 
front of her client (the Victim). 
Attorney 
also advised that, when Jane Doe No. 3 (the Victim) saw Epstein, she 
yelled out, "O God No!" and began to scream. She continued yelling "No! No! No!" 
and began to cry out loud. Attorney 
advised that, she quickly removed her client 
(the Victim) from the area, away om 
pstein and eventually into the lobby of the 
building where she collapsed into a chair. 
After numerous attempts to calm Jane Doe No. 3 (the Victim), Attorney 
advised 
that, she was still visibly distraught and would not be able to proceed with the 
examination which was terminated. 
On that date Epstein stated that he was aware of the protective motion and the deposition 
that was to take place all day at his attorney's office. His daily probation log for that date 
indicated that he was at his attorney's office at Bayon and Olive (Critton's Office) from 
3:30 p.m., to 6:30 p.m. This would indicate that he made a special trip back to the office 
where the deposition was going on and for lack of better terms bumped into Joane Doe 
#3. This shows that his travels back to that location was intential and in conflict with his 
probation log. 
COUNT #6 
On Wednesday Februa 
3 2010 at 10:20 a.m. Florida State Licensed Investigators 
conducted a surveillance of Jeffrey 
Epstein. He was o serve 
eaving his rest ence in his black Escalade, driven by his 
bodyguard 
They were observed to leave the County of Palm Beach and 
drive direct y toteOcean 15 hotel located at 1500 Collins Avenue, Miami Beach, 
Miami-Dade County, Florida. Epstein was observed exiting his vehicle and greeting 
Attorney Alan Dershowitz. They remained at the hotel for ten minutes, leaving with 
Dershowitz and traveling to the Intercontinental Hotel located at 201 South Biscayne 
Blvd., Miami, Florida. 
The Intercontinental Hotel was inundated with media and 
security as the hotel was the host hotel for the New Orleans Saints who were playing in 
the Super Bowl on the following Sunday. Jeffrey Epstein remained at that location until 
1:40 p.m., when he was observed leaving the front of the hotel by himself. He was 
picked up by his bodyguard in the Escalade and they drove North back to his residence. 
On that day Epstein called probation advising his officer that he needed to go to 
Walgreens for Bengay, nothing indicates on his daily log that he ever went to a 
Walgreens. The daily log for that day reflects he was at probation at 8:00 a.m., which 
was no true as he was under surveillance since 7:00 am. Additionally, the log indicates 
that he went to Miami at 9:00 am, and returned home at 1O:00 pm. The facts are that he 
left for Miami at 10:20 am and returned home at approximately 2:30 pm. The log does 
not indicate who he went to Miami with, where he went when in Miami and who he met 
in Miami.
