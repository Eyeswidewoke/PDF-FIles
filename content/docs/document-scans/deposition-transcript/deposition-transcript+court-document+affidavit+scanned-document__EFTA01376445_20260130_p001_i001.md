(c) 
Upon receiving actual notice of any Offer (as defined below), the Trustee 
on behalf of the Issuer shall notify the Collateral Manager of any Collateral Obligation that is 
subject to a tender offer, voluntary redemption, exchange offer, conversion or other similar 
action (an "Offer"). Unless the Notes have been accelerated following an Event of Default, the 
Collateral Manager may direct the Trustee to accept or participate in or decline or refuse to 
participate in such Offer and, in the case of acceptance or participation, to release from the lien 
of this Indenture such Collateral Obligation in accordance with the terms of the Offer against 
receipt of payment therefor. Without limiting the foregoing, the Issuer may, at the direction of 
the Collateral Manager, exchange a Collateral Obligation for another Collateral Obligation in an 
exchange of one security for another security of the same issuer that has substantially identical 
terms except transfer restrictions. 
(d) 
As provided in Section 10.2(a), the Trustee shall deposit any proceeds 
received by it from the disposition of a Pledged Obligation in the applicable subaccount of the 
Collection Account, unless simultaneously applied to the purchase of additional Collateral 
Obligations or Eligible Investments as permitted under and in accordance with the requirements 
of this Article 10 and Article 12. 
(e) 
The Trustee shall, upon receipt of an Issuer Order at such time as there are 
no Notes Outstanding and all obligations of the Co-Issuers hereunder have been satisfied, release 
any remaining Collateral from the lien of this Indenture. 
Section 10.8 Independent Accountants. 
(a) 
On or prior to the Closing Date, the Issuer shall appoint one or more firms 
of Independent certified public accountants of recognized international reputation for purposes of 
reviewing and delivering the reports or certificates of such accountants required by this Indenture 
(the "Indevendent Accountants"). Upon any resignation by such firm, the Issuer shall promptly 
appoint by Issuer Order delivered to the Trustee, the Collateral Manager, and each Rating 
Agency a successor thereto that shall also be a firm of Independent certified public accountants 
of recognized international reputation. If the Issuer shall fail to appoint a successor to a firm of 
Independent certified public accountants which has resigned within 30 days after such 
resignation, the Issuer shall promptly notify the Trustee of such failure in writing. If the Issuer 
shall fail to approve a successor within 10 days thereafter, the Trustee shall be entitled to appoint 
a successor firm of Independent certified public accountants of recognized international 
reputation. The fees of such Independent Accountants and any successor shall be payable by the 
Issuer as Administrative Expenses. 
(b) 
On or before January 30 in each year beginning in 2008, the Issuer shall 
cause to be delivered to the Trustee and the Collateral Manager a certificate from the 
Independent Accountants indicating (i) that such firm has reviewed the Payment Date Reports 
for the Payment Dates during the preceding calendar year, (ii) that the calculations within such 
Payment Date Reports have been performed in accordance with the applicable provisions of this 
Indenture and (iii) the procedures undertaken by such accountants to perform such calculations. 
In the event such firm requires the Trustee to agree to the procedures performed by such firm, the 
Issuer (or the Collateral Manager on its behalf) shall direct the Trustee in writing to so agree; it 
being understood and agreed that the Trustee will deliver such letter agreement in conclusive 
reliance upon the direction of the Issuer (or the Collateral Manager), and the Trustee makes no
