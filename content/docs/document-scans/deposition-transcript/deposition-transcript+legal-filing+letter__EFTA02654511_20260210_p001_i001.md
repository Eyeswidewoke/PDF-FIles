'>l understand why my reque=ts for help is not of the utmost 
importance with everything you are dealin= with now and I can understand that. 
I was always a listening ear for you. You know, I remember your =tory of a chance meeting on a rainy day that changed 
your life and gave yo= an opportunity to succeed and it's a great story that perhaps many pe=ple don't know about you. 
I loved your story, you buying a car, that y=u allowed a man to drive to make money during the day so that you would 
ha=e a ride to and from work, so that you would not have to take the subway r=lentlessly everyday (I don't blame you). 
Besides that, being=mathematically brilliant, your life path only led you on a journey to fina=cial success with the chance 
meeting of a prominent figure I don't=need to mention. I always loved hearing your stories and they inspir=d me. You 
are a smart and brilliant man and that is the story that =hould be told. I am not sure why in your life you strayed to find 
re=ognition from the public and perhaps that was your downfall, after leading=such a private life. Maybe you got richer, 
or grew a bigger ego, but=that is something you will only know. Because you never really discu=sed your family to me, it 
seemed they were a distant factor, and perhaps t=at is another story that is untold as to why you had such a drive in life 
=r why you became who you are. In my eyes, your mission was to free y=urself from the realities of Coney Island and 
that lifestyle and perhaps t=ings you would like to forget. 
Y=u always said to me, "Ask yourself whether it could hurt you4e=9I). This was whenever I was unsure to take a risk in 
life or questio=ed something. And, I still stand by that. Can it hurt expressi=g myself and really letting someone know 
how I feel? Well, clearly s=eaking the truth to my brother-in-law, may come back to bite me, but at le=st I was able to 
relieve myself of bottling my experiences. Sometime= what we do in life affects people more than we can realize and it 
goes bo=h ways. 
=div class="gmail-m_- 
'>I know life is short and=in the grand scheme of things and the 
shit we are dealt are sometimes less=ns we need to learn, regardless that we try to avoid them. I am just=curious to 
know how you feel sometimes as to all the shit that surrounds y=u. Once a private man and now surrounded by all 
these negative accus=tions. I just wish for you and obviously I don't know why so=etimes I feel so concerned, not only 
because I have been brought into thin=s in the past, that you are okay. I think it is because I still care= 
=div class="gmail-m_- 
'>With all the experiences=l was privileged to through you, I will 
always be grateful and I must let =ou know that. But let me tell you, coming back to my little small re=lity that you could 
never understand how I provided for myself on such a s=all salary and high rent, was a difficult one. The glimpse into a 
wo=ld that I will never see again, was not necessarily damaging, but definite=y an eye opener. I also tended and still 
stay very private about my =xperiences and so that makes it sort of tougher on me. At that time,=I was young and hid 
my adventurous nature from my family and friends...A0 Unfortunately, secrets don't last forever. 
I do feel that for some reason it is within the=universe to bring out the truth, especially right now, and things are comi=g 
to the surface. There is no hiding and with me having a scientific= yet a spiritual outlook on life, maybe there is a 
reason, why now. =o why now? Maybe your people can answer that. :-) =/div> 
Sometimes I get frustrated quest=oning why I have defended you after all that has surfaced throughout the y=ars. But I 
have. I do wonder though. And maybe I turned = blind eye.
