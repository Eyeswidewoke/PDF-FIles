The refugees and=humanitarian crises of the Middle East, Afghanistan and Colombia are well known to most. But it 
came as a sur=rise even to the experts of international relations that Nigeria now constitutes one of the epicente=s of 
displacement. As many as 3.3 million people are internally displaced in Nigeria, the third highest worldwide.Q=A0 The 
Internal Displacement Monitoring Center, a research institution part of my organization, the Norwegian Refugee 
Council= was this year for the first time able to present figures from Nigeria confi=med even by the government. 
The people fled their homes in Nigeria because of con=lict, violence and neglect that have been built up over a number 
of years. =he neglect is shared by both the national government and the international community. Nobody really cared 
enoug= to focus on what happened in North-Eastern Nigeria where Boko Haram and other armed actors c=uld do 
seemingly whatever they wanted to defenseless civilians. Too often it is=not objective needs that determine who gets 
our attention and who does not. But=a selective humanism is not human, and we should give the same minimum 
amount=of attention, assistance and action to all refugees, wherever they are../p> 
More than one th=rd of the world's internally displaced -- about 12.5 million refugees -- are located in sub-Saharan 
Africa. Th= Central African Republic is one of the examples of the humanitarian and political crisis that long-term neglect 
ca= lead to. The U.N. and humanitarian partners have only managed to cover part of the resources needed for life-
saving relief in the country. It is a recipe for cementing the emergency situation into a permanent crisis.Q=A0 This again 
reinforces the neglect, because a protracted crisis gets even less attention and resources than an exploding emergency. 
This is the sad reality of the Horn of Africa and in the Democra=ic Republic of Congo, where millions of displaced people 
are trapped in abject poverty. 
Aid workers say that the situation is not hopeless.=C24, With resources from the U.S., the E.U., Scandinavians and other 
good donors, emergency relief has in recent years become more effective and cost-efficient even in the most extreme of 
circumstances.Q=A0 Mortality rate in emergencies are down and nutrition, sanitation and education better, compared 
to what they were a de=ade or two ago. This progress is now under threat. The extreme number and scale of 
humanitarian crises are placing unprecedented demands on the international =id system, and humanitarian resources 
and capacity are becoming dangerously ov=rstretched. We need to rethink our priorities and approach. 
Aid workers say that more than anything, we can and w= must enable more people to get out of their hopelessness. Too 
many people =teeing conflicts or natural disasters become trapped in protracted crises. We may save lives and =ncrease 
handouts, but we fail to provide durable solutions. We need political leaders that are able to create stable societies 
where human rights and the rule of law can enable economic growth and employment for th= displaced children we 
now give school. Relief and development actors need t= work more hand in hand.
