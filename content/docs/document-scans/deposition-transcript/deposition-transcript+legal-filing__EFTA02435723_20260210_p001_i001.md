economy I No Comments 
Bad news is often stickier than good news. Regardless of whether it's true or not, it's something that 
ertainly holds true for the economic outlook of the Gulf. Dubai in particular has received a severe 
lashing from the international press since late 2008, with the UAE's largest city painted not merely as 
victim of the global economic malaise but as a symbol of hubristic overreach that received its 
•eserved comeuppance. 
growing number of economists say the pessimism has been overdone and that the picture for the 
ulf is not nearly as dark as it seemed just a few months ago. Indeed, a consensus is building that 
ot only is the region headed for robust recovery, but that the silver lining may soon eclipse the cloud 
tself. 
Some experts say the Dubai crash, along with the lessons likely to be learned from it, may have even 
been the best thing that could have happened to the UAE and its neighbors, for if the 2002-
2008 boom had continued, a number of much needed reforms might have been delayed indefinitely, 
leading to more lasting damage further down the road. 
o be sure, those interested in the bad news have no shortage of stories to choose from. There's the 
10 billion fraud allegation leveled against the head of Saudi conglomerate Saad Group, a scandal 
hat suggests lending practices at Gulf banks have been less than stringent. 
•r to take a more recent example, the "travel news" section of The Timesnewspaper recently 
reported - on tenuous grounds, citing a single unnamed property agent as its source - that Nakheel's 
landmark island chain development The World had been "canceled," the quoted source adding that 
he man-made archipelago "doesn't even look like the world" and that most of it resembles "a pile of 
muck." The suicide of the buyer of Ireland was offered as further evidence of The World's apparent 
ailure. 
Never mind Nakheel's assurances, published in the Dubai daily the Kha/eej Times, that it has already 
handed over 33 islands to buyers, or the recent report inArabian Business that Safi Qurashi, the 
British property developer who bought the Great Britain island for $60 million in May 2008 started 
building on it immediately after Ramadan. The World, rightly or wrongly, has become yet another 
ymbol of Dubai's folly. 
he case of Nakheel is emblematic of the rush to judgment in a situation more nuanced than most 
boosters or detractors would have it. Like many Dubai developers, Nakheel is a troubled firm. Its 
bonds and sukuk (Islamic bond) certificates were trading at levels that resembled junk bonds earlier 
his year, with yields reaching as high as 85 percent at one point. Several developments have been 
uspended before they even began, including another man-made island chain slated to surround The 
World called - what else? - The Universe, announced at the boom's tail end in 2008. 
ether projects have been subjected to little or no scrutiny. Take Dubai Promenade, for instance, a 
million-square-meter waterfront development adjacent to Dubai Marina, notable for the building 
•epicted on promotional drawings which resembled a donut standing on end. It was clear to anyone 
who visited the construction site in the spring that work had come to a halt. 
Not a crane, truck or bulldozer was to be found on the vast expanse of reclaimed land, and even the 
•n-site offices had been cleared of everything but the furniture. Dubai Promenade's Web site still 
promises "a sophisticated waterfront community" with "breathtaking vistas from every direction" as
