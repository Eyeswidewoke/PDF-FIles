an established star wit= several hit records and film appearances and a lucrative touring career...AO He had also 
established his own St. Louis nightclub, Berry's Club Bandstand. But in January 1962, he was sentenced to three years in 
prison for offenses under the Mann Act — he had transported a 14-year-old girl across s=ate lines. After his release in 
1963, Berry had more hits in the mid-1960s, including "No Particular Place to Go", "You Never Can Tell", and "Nadine". 
By the mid-1970s, he was more in demand as a live performer, playing his past hits with local backup bands of varia=le 
quality. In 1979 he served 120 days in prison for tax evasion. 
During the 1960s and 1970s, Berry's music was the i=spiration for such groups as the Beatles and the Rolling Stones. 
Berry had a nu=ber of comeback recordings and in 1972 had the first and only #1 Pop Chart hit of his career with 
0=9CMy Ding-A-Ling." Berry was among the first musician= to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on its 
opening in 1986; he was cited for having "laid the =roundwork for not only a rock and roll sound but a rock and roll 
stance." Berry is included in=several of Rolling Stone magazine's "greatest of all time" lists; he was ranked fifth on its 
2004 list of=the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs That =haped Rock and Roll 
includes three of Berry's: "Johnny B. Goode", "Maybellene", and "=i>Rock and Roll Music". Berry's "Johnny B. 
Goode=b>" is the only rock-and-roll song included on the Voyager Golden Record.=/span> 
As Washington Post music critic Chris Richards wrote — t>=9CEven if Chuck Berry never sang all of those beautiful words 
about V-8s, jitneys, limousines and Coupe de Villes, it was obvious that he was making a new kin= of car music. His songs 
started like engines. A guitar riff would stutter like=a crankshaft, then the beat would kick in, and suddenly everything 
smelled li=e motor oil and hormones. This new vroom-vroom music was dubbed rock-and-roll=" Please feel free to read 
the attached, Luke Dittrich's December 2011 Esqui=e Magazine interview with Chuck Berry. 
=p class="MsoNormal">Chuck Berry's music has transcended generatio=s. He earned respect as an international icon 
because in addition to being a master entertainer Berry was one of civilization0=80t finest songwriters, offering 
marvelously detailed accounts of anticipation, possibility and mobility — social, sexual and the like. Beyon= simply a 
musical style, rock & roll, as seen in movies and on television, influenced lifestyles, fashion, attitudes, and language. In 
addition, rock and roll may have contributed to the civil rights movement because bot= African-American and white 
American teens enjoyed the music. It went =n to spawn various genres, often without the initially characteristic 
backbeat, that are now more commonly c=lled simply "rock music" or "rock" and much can be traced back to Mr. Johnny 
B. Goode himself, Mr. Charles Edward Anderson "Chuck" Berry. 
Berry, who is considered one of "The Founding Fathers of Rock & Roll," discovered success by watching the audienc='s 
reaction and playing accordingly, putting his listeners' amusement above all=else. For this reason, tunes like "Johnny B. 
Goode,Q=9D "Maybellene" and "Memphist>=80.O have become anthems to an integrated American youth and 
popular culture.40=A0 Berry is a musical icon who established rock and roll as a musical form and brought the worlds of 
black and white togeth=r in song. With this said, you are again invited to enjoy the music of The Father of Rock & Roll, 
the great Mr. Chuck Berry
