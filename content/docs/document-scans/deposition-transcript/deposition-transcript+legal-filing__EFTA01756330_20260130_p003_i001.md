those dialogues since 2006. And yet never before have we had what=took place over the course of the past few days in 
Geneva, which was appar=ntly a very serious, technical discussion about how Tehran can meet the co=cerns of the 
international community for greater transparency and greater assurance that the Islamic republic c=nnot break out and 
achieve nuclear weapons capability. 
The Iranians hav= made it clear, though, that they want to continue to enrich uranium. We d=n't know whether they are 
willing to stop at this 20 percent figure. What =oes the magic figure mean? 
There are both qual=tative and quantitative constraints that the international community is lo=king to see Iran apply to 
its enrichment activities. The UN Security Counc=l resolutions that have been passed over the course of the past seven 
years all refer to a requirement of a su=pension of uranium enrichment, which was of course the condition—the 
con=ession—that now President Rouhani negotiated while he was in charge of t=e talks for Iran from 2003 to 2005. 
There has been for some time an understanding among most in the internatio=al community that it is no longer viable 
to achieve a sustained suspension=of all of Iran's uranium-enrichment activities. However, there are concern= about 
enrichment to what is described as medium levels—near 20 percent enrichment—which provides something o= a fast 
track to production of nuclear weapons fuel material. This h=s been an area where the United States and its partners 
have been focused =or a number of years in hopes of persuading Iran to either forgo that enrichment or to suspend and 
stop it. It appears=that that's an area [in which] the Iranians are at least prepared to make =ome initial concessions. 
There is discussion, at least in the reports that=have come from Geneva, that Iran may be prepared to suspend that 
enrichment for a six-month period. Iran ha= been quite careful to ensure that its stockpile of this medium-enriched 
u=anium does not go beyond what the Israelis and others have described as a red line. That is an area [where], because 
of the focus of many years,=we're more likely to see some quick progress. The bigger issues may be som= of the 
technical areas of concern that have grown more urgent as Iran's program has expanded over the course=of these many 
years. 
Like what? 
In particular, the =evelopment of more sophisticated centrifuges and the heavy-water reactor based in the Iranian city of 
Arak, which is due to=come online sometime next year. I think these are two particular issues [t=at] the international 
community is going to be looking at very closely for significant Iranian concessions in=order to build up confidence that 
we can keep Iran significantly far from =uclear weapons capability. 
There was some t=lk about Iran agreeing to this so-called "additional protocol" that allows UN inspectors to come in 
without any real warning. Can you talk about that? 
This is a form of e=hanced transparency, and something that has been the focus of interest for=many years. The Iranians 
agreed to implement the "additional protocol=quot; while Rouhani was the nuclear negotiator, but the treaty was never 
ratified by the Iranian parliament; and that leve= of transparency has not been in place in Iran for many years. And so, it 
=s of considerable importance that Iranian negotiators appear to have said =ublicly that they are prepared to implement 
the terms of that protocol, even if they are unable for eithe= legal or political reasons to get parliamentary ratification of 
the treat= addition itself. That is an important confidence builder, but, in effect,=transparency is not enough. We would 
like to see greater transparency and cooperation with the Internatio=al Atomic Energy Agency from Iran. But, I believe 
that the more important =onsiderations from the international community are caps on the number of c=ntrifuges and 
on the extent of enrichment in Iran. While the Iranians have suggested they are prepared to=talk about it, it's not yet 
clear if there is any real meeting of the mind= between the two sides on what kinds of numbers would be acceptable. 
Of course, there=are several parties who are not terribly happy about the improvement in th= atmosphere. There are 
many members of Congress who would like to have add=tional sanctions put on Iran now, as well as the Israelis who are 
very nervous about this progress.<=pan style="font-size:18.0pt"> 
There are still man= who have not yet been convinced that there is a real deal on the table at=this point, and that's 
perfectly justifiable in some quarters, given that =his is a significant shift from much of what we've seen and heard from
