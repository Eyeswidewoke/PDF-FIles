I was always a listening ear for you. =ou know, I remember your story of a chance meeting on a rainy day that 
cha=ged your life and gave you an opportunity to succeed and it's a great =tory that perhaps many people don't know 
about you. I loved your story= you buying a car, that you allowed a man to drive to make money during th= day so that 
you would have a ride to and from work, so that you would not=have to take the subway relentlessly everyday (I don't 
blame you).=C2 Besides that, being mathematically brilliant, your life path only le= you on a journey to financial success 
with the chance meeting of a promin=nt figure I don't need to mention. I always loved hearing yo=r stories and they 
inspired me. You are a smart and brilliant man a=d that is the story that should be told. I am not sure why in your l=fe 
you strayed to find recognition from the public and perhaps that was yo=r downfall, after leading such a private life. 
Maybe you got richer,=or grew a bigger ego, but that is something you will only know. Beca=se you never really 
discussed your family to me, it seemed they were a dis=ant factor, and perhaps that is another story that is untold as to 
why you=had such a drive in life or why you became who you are. In my eyes, =our mission was to free yourself from 
the realities of Coney Island and th=t lifestyle and perhaps things you would like to forget. 
You al=ays said to me, "Ask yourself whether it could hurt you".=C2 This was whenever I was unsure to take a 
risk in life or questioned =omething. And, I still stand by that. Can it hurt expressing m=self and really letting someone 
know how I feel? Well, clearly speak=ng the truth to my brother-in-law, may come back to bite me, but at least = was 
able to relieve myself of bottling my experiences. Sometimes wh=t we do in life affects people more than we can realize 
and it goes both w=ys. 
I know life is short and in the grand scheme of things and th= shit we are dealt are sometimes lessons we need 
to learn, regardless that=we try to avoid them. I am just curious to know how you feel sometim=s as to all the shit that 
surrounds you. Once a private man and now =urrounded by all these negative accusations. I just wish for you 
and=obviously I don't know why sometimes I feel so concerned, not only=because I have been brought into things in the 
past, that you are okay. =AO I think it is because I still care. 
With all the experi=nces I was privileged to through you, I will always be grateful and I must=let you know that. 
But let me tell you, coming back to my little sma=1 reality that you could never understand how I provided for myself on 
suc= a small salary and high rent, was a difficult one. The glimpse into=a world that I will never see again, was not 
necessarily damaging, but def=nitely an eye opener. I also tended and still stay very private abou= my experiences and 
so that makes it sort of tougher on me. At that =ime, I was young and hid my adventurous nature from my family and 
friends.=C2 Unfortunately, secrets don't last forever.
