THOMAS MANN: Thank you, Bill. 
BILL MOYERS: Okay, the election's come and gone and the deep dysfunction that has gripped our 
government for so many years now is still with us. What are you thinking today? 
THOMAS MANN: You know, the election was even more stunning, in a way, in its sweep than we might 
have imagined. So you would have thought things would be different. Maybe in an issue or two, like 
immigration, it will be. But if you look at the gun issue, the background check, so much of the focus has 
been on the four Democrat apostates who drifted away from their party. 
Forty-one of 45 Republicans voted no. That includes people from states that wouldn't naturally be a part 
of a big gun culture. What's the reason? It's the tribalism we described in the book that continues. If he's 
for it, we're against it. We're not going to give him a victory, even if we were for it yesterday. And I'm 
afraid that pathology is still a driving force, dramatically so in the House; a little bit less in the Senate. But 
as we saw with background checks, not quite enough. 
THOMAS MANN: Sadly, divided party government, which we have because of the Republican House, in 
a time of extreme partisan polarization, is a formula for inaction and absolutist opposition politics, not for 
problem solving. 
You know, it wasn't that long ago when you could actually get something done under divided government. 
There'd be enough members of the opposition party who want to legislate, not simply to engage in what 
we used to call the permanent campaign is now a permanent war. But that doesn't happen anymore now. 
It's Republicans are unified in their oppositions, or beholden to a "no new tax" pledge that really keeps the 
country, the Congress, and its political system from dealing honestly and seriously with the problems we 
face. 
BILL MOYERS: Well, take the gun vote again. It occurred to me that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid 
may have made a fatal blunder when he caved earlier in the year and didn't go for the end of the 
filibuster, as he could have. Do you agree with that? 
NORMAN ORNSTEIN: I have mixed feelings about that, Bill. The difficulty that Harry Reid faced was to 
do this would cause a lot of turmoil in the Senate. There are so many other ways that a minority party can 
bollix up the works. And it's worth a price, if it's going to lead to legislative outcomes. But with a 
Republican House, all those bills passed would have met a graveyard. 
BILL MOYERS: They could have still blocked it over in the... 
NORMAN ORNSTEIN: Could have still... 
BILL MOYERS: Anything that... 
NORMAN ORNSTEIN: ...blocked it. 
BILL MOYERS: ...passed in the Senate. 
NORMAN ORNSTEIN: So he went for a deal with Mitch McConnell which makes it easier, if the two 
leaders want to do something, to overcome individual rogue senators, like a Ted Cruz or a Rand Paul. 
But it didn't bank on, he didn't bank on the Republican leader basically going back to where he had been 
for the first four years of the Obama administration on nominations for judges and top administration 
officials, and on a whole host of bills, and once again raising the bar to 60 routinely. 
BILL MOYERS: You really surprised me last year, because I know how hard you both have worked to be 
bipartisan and to work with Democrats and Republicans, but you were very blunt in the way you came out 
and finally, you know.
