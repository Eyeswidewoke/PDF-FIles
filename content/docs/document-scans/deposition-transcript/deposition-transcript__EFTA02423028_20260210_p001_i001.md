Subject Re: 
There is work... Is not that I'm doing nothing all day. Fm doing market research since I arrived 
here. and I report to my boss every second, third day. The problem is that the sales went down 
drastically lately and everybody is a bit stressed about it, and trying to come up with solutions 
asap...so maybe this was another reason why I thought that I won't be needed I'll finish end of 
october. I think my bf is actually more mature than I am when it comes to many things specially 
when it comes to work. I'm stubborn coz I've got lost so many times I don't want it to happen 
again. I have many insecurities (personal and financial) :( 
And I've listened to all your advices... sooner or later. 
I care a lot about my bf, and I'm strong because he's there for me 24h a day.

ask the boss , if there is anything you can do to help him or the company, Ask for more 
work. . , when is your 3 months up. ? ask , if there is not work in your department , if there is 
something you can do in another, dept. .. I hestitate to give you more advice, you rarely if 
ever takemine 
( I told you that going to Lyndon party was very very important. you made 
the decision , not to go. , its been difficult since then, ) the issue was were you going to 
behave like an adult, or like a child, with a childish boyfriend. ), You are really great, but very 
stubborn.

Great!!! Was thinking of you this weekend, I was looking for you on skype. 
I don't want to complain but so far I've only been in dept. Is funny that I took the 
salary(1400) and spent it in the first week ( paying the rent, buying abonament for tube, some 
groceries from the supermarket and the bank overdraft I had) Am I doing something wrong? 
Or is just the way it is? And no way of buying new clothes even though I need since winter is 
coming with fast steps 
I can say I'm a bit patrified thinking that my boyfriend is comeing here next week, and starting 
a life together. I have to admit that he won't be able to take care of me in the next 2-3 years 
at least, so I'm kind of on my own, so I have to grow in my job and be smart about every 
step. So far I don't feel needed in the office, and I don't know if is because all of them are 
professional and don't need my oppinion, or I just don't have good ideas...anyway I'm trying 
to learn everyday... 
There was another intern working here with me, and he left for another job before he finished 
his 3 months. 
Any advice? 
kisses
