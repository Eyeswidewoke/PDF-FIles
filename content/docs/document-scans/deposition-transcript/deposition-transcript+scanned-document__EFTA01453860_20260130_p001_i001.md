tactical trade to position for ECB QE (now) 
The ECB is preparing both itself and markets for QE - Its senior board members 
have stepped up public comments over the past 48hrs. This is the clearest sign 
so far QE could happen and why I am writing to you now. 
Ideally ECB wants to buy ABS from small to medium sized European companies but 
the outstanding available is relatively small so it will likely buy Eurozone 
Government Bonds. The spread between Italian BTPs and German Bunds has 
tightened significantly past 18months but old metrics of value make no sense 
in Europe because they rely on history when there was no QE. 
while It's hard to get excited about lOy BTPs yielding 3.16% (164bp over 10Y 
German Bunds) I'd still have 5-10mm lOy BTPs in my portfolio both for the 
duration and spread compression potential. I prefer lOy over Sy because the 
recent nearly parallel spread compression has left 5slOs steep relative to 
0-5s.. 
3 reasons i like this trade: 
i) macro investors view ECB QE as a second bite at the cherry. Everyone I talk 
to wants European risk assets having seen QE in the US. 
ii) ECB QE is probably still 3-6mths away which will keep credit bid. This 
will be a buy the rumour sell the fact trade 
iii) credit has been bulletproof during the recent risk selloff because a) ECB 
QE expectations, b) G3 rate hikes are being pushed into the future while cash 
has nowhere else to go. This price action is telling - as and when equities 
recover i think credit continues to tighten

2) Tactically position for higher EURUSD - 2 week view (now) 
BUY EURSOmm 2week expiry 1.40 strike European Style EURUSD Calls @ 6bp 
(EUR30,000) 
This is a low cost contrarian short term tactical call. Most investors myself 
included are bullish USD in the medium term (see trade 3) 
but in the very short term I see EURUSD higher because: 
i) Despite ECB preparing the markets for QE, the price action of EURUSD 
(broadly unchanged) has been quite bullish compared to what one would expect 
ii) speculators don't appear long EURUSD to us. majority are short or flat. 
iii) implied volatility is 5.25% (offer for 2week options) which is very very 
low historically. so this is a penny option, highly convex, pain trade bet 
against other speculators betting on QE 
If my view is wrong 6bp is lost. If I'm right I'd plan to exit in a week 
making 4-6x

3) Position for a Stronger Dollar - lyear view (now or soon) 
Buy ly expiry European style digital binary option on EURUSD struck 5% below 
spot @ 21% of payout (which i think is too cheap) 
Current strike (spot - 5%) would be 1.3120 
At expiry if EURUSD has fallen by more than 5% from current levels the option 
payout is EUR1mm. Upfront premium is EUR210k. 
The option is liquid and can be unwound at any time. 
i) Yellen has done a poor job of communicating the Fed's thinking but its 
increasingly clear the Fed will brake later than usual 
ii) Betting on higher US interest rates in the rates market isn't cost 
effective because the forward curve is already pricing in higher rates 
iii) The Dollar hasn't appreciated yet because short rates in the uS haven't 
risen meaningfully 
iv) THE KEY POINT - FX volatility is very low in currency pairs like EURUSD 
where central bank policy on each side is increasingly diverging. The low vol
