NBC Nightly NewsVI (7/27, story 4, 1:45, Holt, 6.32M) likewise remarked on Trump "for only 
the second time in public wearing a mask while touring a biotech center in North Carolina." Both 
CBS and NBC devoted most of their segment to coverage of National Security Adviser O'Brien 
testing positive for the virus. 
ABC World News TonightVi (7/27, story 3, 2:25, Muir, 7.11M) reported that in North 
Carolina, "the President did wear a mask, just the second time he has done so in public, as he 
visited a vaccine production facility." Trump was shown saying, "A second vaccine is likely to 
enter Phase 3 in a matter of days." However, added ABC, "the President also seemed to 
contradict health experts who say much of the country is dealing with an alarming spike in new 
infections, largely because the states reopened too quickly." Trump, on the other hand, 
"suggested some states are not opening quickly enough." Said Trump, "I really do believe a lot 
of the governors should be opening up states that they're not opening, and we will see what 
happens with them." Along those lines, Yahoo! News (7/27, Stableford, 12.82M) recounts 
"Trump continued to urge states to reopen their economies Monday despite the sharp increase 
in the number of Americans testing positive for COVID-19 in recent weeks." 
The New York Post (7/27, Bowden, 4.57M) similarly reports "Trump donned a mask," and 
that he "has embraced wearing masks in recent weeks, pulling it out of his pocket at the 
rebooted coronavirus briefings and calling it an act of patriotism after mocking...[Joe] Biden for 
wearing one in May." 
WWAY-TVVi Wilmington, NC (7/27, 10K) reported, meanwhile, that when he took 
questions from the media, Trump "was asked about the state's decision regarding the 
Republican National Convention and how the nomination night will be going ahead as planned." 
Trump was shown saying, "We are having a very major - I guess that would be the nomination 
night, so that is Monday, that will be Monday, they are going to be here and the rest we will do 
in a different form. We could have done it many different ways, but I think we did the right 
thing, and I'm really happy that we're going to be having a piece of it, at least , and a very 
important piece in North Carolina." 
Moderna Begins Final-Stage Testing Of Corona virus Vaccine Candidate. The AP 
(7/27, Neergaard, Hill, Noveck) reports that "the biggest test yet of an experimental COVID-19 
vaccine got underway Monday with the first of some 30,000 Americans rolling up their sleeves 
to receive shots created by the US government as part of the all-out global race to stop the 
outbreak." The AP adds "final-stage testing of the vaccine, developed by the National Institutes 
of Health and Moderna Inc., began with volunteers at numerous sites around the US given 
either a real dose or a dummy without being told which." Reuters (7/27, Maddipatla, O'Donnell) 
indicates that NIH Director Collins said in a release announcing the start of Moderna's Phase 3 
trial, "Having a safe and effective vaccine distributed by the end of 2020 is a stretch goal, but 
it's the right goal for the American people." Reuters reports that the trial is "the first such late-
stage study under the Trump administration's program to speed development of measures 
against the novel coronavirus, adding to hope that an effective vaccine will help end the 
pandemic." 
The Wall Street Journal (7/27, Loftus, Subscription Publication, 7.57M) reports that NIH's 
Collins said on Monday, "Yes, we're going fast, but no, we are not going to compromise safety 
or efficacy." In its lead story, the CBS Evening NewsVi (7/27, lead story, 3:25, O'Donnell, 
4.46M) referred to the trials as "a huge leap forward in the development of a vaccine," and 
showed Collins saying, "This is a very significant milestone. ... This is the first of several 
vaccines that are going to be coming along quite quickly. So people are going to be hearing a 
lot about this." ABC World News TonightVi (7/27, story 2, 1:15, Muir, 7.11M) showed Collins 
saying to the volunteers, "You're contributing to the kind of scientific advance that might 
ultimately save hundreds of thousands, maybe millions of lives." NBC Nightly NewsVi (7/27, 
lead story, 2:55, Holt, 6.32M) reported, meanwhile, that "there is growing reason to hope 
tonight that medicine can soon do what all those changes in human behavior seemingly can't:
