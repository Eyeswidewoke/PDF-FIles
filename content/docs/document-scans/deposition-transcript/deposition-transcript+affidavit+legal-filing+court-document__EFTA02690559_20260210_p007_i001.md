new governance system for Iraq. All of this is embryonic and fragile. Some of it 
is only weeks old, none of it more than months old. At the same time all of it is 
fundamental to a successful Iraq. Putting aside the costs to the US, we need a 
withdrawal plan in order to make the strategy work. We need a withdrawal plan 
in order to allow Iraq to stand on its own. That is the end game of the strategy. 
The art will be to devise a withdrawal plan whose timing and structure is driven 
by the strategy and not by US or Iraqi politics. Over a reasonable period of time 
(1-2 years), the Iraqi army should be able to stand on its own with respect to 
domestic terrorism and insurgency. In that time frame, however, they will not 
have developed the capabilities (air power, intelligence systems etc.) to secure 
themselves against a conventional war with Iran. Our withdrawal will need to be 
tailored to those realities. In the Fall there will be provincial elections. Watch 
not only for voter turn out, but watch for whether the results are along sectarian 
lines or do people begin to vote for the individuals they prefer. Does block voting 
erode in favor of traditional issues like the voter's pocket book. Next year there 
will be national elections. We met with the opposition and they are acting like an 
opposition party. They are identifying the weaknesses of the incumbents and 
they are publicizing those weaknesses. Watch out for Iran. They are the 
serious bad actors in the neighborhood. This is the one topic that all Arab 
countries can agree upon. Finally, I am told that Washington consensus is that it 
will take another 10 years to produce a stable Iraq. I am more optimistic, but I 
would use as my threshold a "reasonably stable" Iraq. External forces (Iran, 
Saudi Arabia, US policy etc.) will play a major role in this timing. In my view, Iraq 
is no longer principally about ridding Iraq of Al Qaeda and insurgents. It is more 
three dimensional than that. It is about stability in an important and dangerous 
region, it is about prosperity, peace and hope. It is about a strategy that is 
aimed at these challenges.

Postscript - Afghanistan. Afghanistan is important, but Iraq is 
critical. I say this for several reasons. First, Afghanistan is not likely to produce 
a governance model that others can follow. It has never had widespread, true 
national identity. Look at its terrain. Its social structure is built around that 
terrain. Second, even if we are successful, Afghanistan will never be a 
meaningful economic force in the world. Third, in their neighborhood, Pakistan 
is the real danger. This is a big time danger, but a pacified Afghanistan will not 
have the same profound consequences as a pacified Iraq in terms of producing 
positive change in surrounding countries. It is true that if we lose Afghanistan, 
that would impair regional stability, but our primary focus in Afghanistan is to 
deny it as a base for the Taliban. I don't want to diminish the importance of that. 
At the same time, we don't need it for such things as a role model for 
governance or energy production on a world scale or a military force that is 
meaningful in terms of regional balance of power. Iraq is ground zero for the 
future of the Middle East and the Middle East, in many ways, is ground zero for 
global stability, prosperity and hope.
