Thank you very much dear Jeffrey for your thoughts, comments and suggestions. It is good to get 
some critics, because good critics makes one think about things that can be improved, try harder 
to make it happen, and grow. I thought about everything you told me since the day we've met and 
I agree that even though in my opinion the performance had some improvements from my earlier 
playing, however it is still not perfect, too rigid and needs more freedom. I will keep on trying to 
develop these skills in order to be more free and alive not only in my playing but in general as a 
person. 
As always, it was a great pleasure to see you, thank you for your time spent with me, for 
considering my recording and for great comments about it. Once again, it's essential to get some 
critics in order to get better, but I'm happy that you still liked it! 
Wish you a pleasant trip and hopefully see you next weekend!

sorry i missed you this trip. I re listened and watched the performance, thnk you for sharing it 
with me, . I find myself in the diffiucult positon of wanting to be supportive of your effort , but 
needing to push you to do better. just as in your life , and i mentioned it last year. I suggest 
you need to take risks, be passionalte. have fun, show and experince emotion. do somthing crazy 
is my last years suggestion. the performance is rigid, lacks humor. passion and risk. the piece is 
grand , fun, muysterious, amusing, strong. the conductor was not much of a help as he appeared 
to be asleep. while moving his arms. as you want to be a performer ---perform. 
enjoy the 
process. try new phrasing, try new accents. . playing the piece as if it were for an entrance exam 
with no audience , techinally was nice, but had little romance. 
it is not serious, it is fun, no 
one wants to watch a serious rendition played as it was played 100 years ago. this is supposed to 
entertain, enthrall, motivate, move. I would remove the rocking from the waist. and put the 
feeling in the bow. you are good enough to stand out from the crowd if you try, conformity will 
deaden the work, be brave, take risk, it is PLAY the music , not recite it. play is fun 
I had hoped to tell you these things face to face so you could see that my eyes are kind , and my 
motivation pure, however as time ran out, I think it importnat that you make some changes if 
you are to achieve your stated goals. otherwise you will learn , learn learn and not be closer to 
your dream.
