In view of the=inter-related context as above, attacks by militants (whether shooting, kidnapping or other) is 
part of the strategy by militants, especially TTP, to attack security forces — it is =ot a new tactic. It pre-dates the Zarb 
Azab military operation begun in June 2014, but now, in response, all uniformed personnel, anywhere in Pakistan, are 
renewed targets of the TTP & its allies. The police and/or Levies accompany=ng polio teams offer the right target & 
polio workers are collateral damage, som=times in gunfire by the security forces. 
<=span> 
Since the Dece=ber 2014 suicide operation on the Army Public School in Peshawar, a true game-changer, 
members of TTP, Lashkar Jhangvi, Jundallah & allies are being hanged by the authorities — hence any chance of a 
dialogue with=any of the militant groups cited above is, for the present, neither possible no= recommended.

In addition, l=1 notes that the 4 day 16-19 February PEP in Quetta was postponed both due to PM Sharif's visit as 
all security forces were diverted for his protection + Matriculation exams beginning 18 February.&=bsp; IPI therefore 
recommends that PEP be coordinated in advance regarding known events such as examinations. What cannot be 
foreseen are security-related postponements, as in December 2014. Also, the renewed campaign by UNICEF which 
focuses on parental refusal shou=d be improved (it is criticized by the target group, inter alia, as no= adquately taking 
into account local cultural traditions).

(ii) Khyber Agency, FATA: Khyber Agency is=geo-strategically important, historically as well as in the present 
context. It touches Peshawar, KP's provincial capital, two other FATA agencies + Afghanis=an, in addition to being the 
entry/exit point for the traffic & transport of people, goods, NATO supplies. As the military operation Zarb Azab 
progressed, militants fleeing North Waziristan have sought refuge in Khyber, leading the Pak military to launch a military 
operation titled Khyber I in mid-October 2014. Even prior to this launch, parts of Khyber (in particular Bara & Tirah 
Valley) saw combat between militant groups & Pak military — the former composed of a combination of 3 militant 
groups which elsewhere have =een fighting each other, but are here defending a prized transit route for mass=ve 
smuggling. Khyber I is also aimed at clearing the transit route for NATO's retrograde mission (supplies & equipment 
being withdrawn from Afghanistan). Khyber has valuable mineral deposits & mines, exploited by militants groups for 
income.

Polio incid=nt: On Sat 14 February 2015, gunmen fired at a van carrying a polio vaccination to=m, killing the 
driver, as it was preparing for a 3-day PEP 16-18 February.&nbs=; The shots were fired from a nearby hill in the Lowi 
Shalman area of Landi Kotal, Khyber, which has, in addition to the aspects cited above, valuable mineral deposits which 
are mined & sold b= the militants. On the same day, a number of militants were killed by Pak forces in an adjacent FATA 
area, as Pak for=es began preparations to launch a fresh crackdown in Bara, & locals were ordered to evacuate the area 
by that pm. IPI does not see this as either a direct attack on the polio team, nor an attempted abduction — the militants 
shoot from surrounding hilltops at anything which moves & go into hiding only when Pak helicopters secure =he air 
above.
