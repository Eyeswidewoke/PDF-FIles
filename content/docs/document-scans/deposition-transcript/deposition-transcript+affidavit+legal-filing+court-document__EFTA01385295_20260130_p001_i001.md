Chemicals: Market Perform Relative to DB High Yield Index 
Continued low-cost feedstocks with similar margins for the Chemicals actor 
Our basic theme for 2018 for the Chemicals sector is a continued benefit of 
low-cost feedstocks for commodity producers leading to another year of solid 
margins. Margins are expected to be at a similar level as in 2017, which 
represents a level within the range of prior peaks, but well below the record 
levels of late 2014. Further, we expect the macro backdrop to be modestly 
stronger than in 2017. We also expect Chemical producers to focus on 
continued cost cutting initiatives and M&A to grow in the face of the current 
macro forecast. 
Market Perform rating for the Chemicals sector 
The DB HY Chemicals Index has a YTVV of 5.36% versus 5.75% for the broad 
HY Index. Given the outperformance of HY Chemicals over the past year, the 
yield is now 39 bps tight of the DB HY Index as compared to 14 bps wide at 
the end of 2016. The current relationship is slightly tight to the average over 
the past ten years, which has been 22 bps tight of the DB HY Index. Given this 
relationship is largely in-line, along with the macro backdrop calling for modest 
growth, we rate the sector Market Perform. 
Recommendations mciude riinseo and NOVA Chemicals 
Our BUY recommendations in the Chemicals sector include the Trinseo 5.375% 
Senior Notes '25 and the NOVA Chemicals 4.875% Senior Notes '24, 5.000% 
Senior Notes '25 and 5.250% Senior Notes '27. The Trinseo and NOVA bonds 
both represent attractive relative value compared to similarly rated names by 
offering additional yield compared to their peers, while maintaining stronger 
credit stets. 
U.S. Ethylene lip-Cycle to Persist through 2020 
While lower oil prices have reduced U.S. ethylene profitability, we still expect 
U.S. ethylene margins to remain strong and U.S. ethylene producers to remain 
advantaged versus oil-based producers in Europe and Asia through the rest of 
the decade. We forecast U.S. ethane-based ethylene cash margins to stay 
close to the current level of 13 c/lb range through 2018. The 13 c/lb margin is 
below the 44 c/lb margin achieved in September 2014 (the peak of the peak). 
but still within the range of prior peaks of 10-15 c/lb. Notwithstanding our 
view of rising ethane prices, we remain positive on the U.S. ethylene cycle 
through the rest of the decade (and likely longer) for 2 key reasons: a beneficial 
oil-to-gas ratio and limited global supply additions. 
Global GDP to be up modestly in 2018 
The global macro economy is expected to see modestly stronger growth in 
2018 as compared to 2017. DB's Global Economics team forecasts global GDP 
will increase 3.8% in '18 versus 3.7% in '17. Faster progress on tax reform 
bills in the U.S. and the EU-UK exit deal provided the most recent positive 
catalysts to growth in 2017. They added to a favorable backdrop of strong 
economic growth, increasingly supportive fiscal and regulatory policy, and 
tightening but still easy monetary policy. The DB Global Economics team 
expects the positive environment to extend into 2018, as the global economy 
should expand at a strong pace, with the U.S. and Eurozone growing above 
potential and China slowing down, but only moderately. Political risk, though 
still present, shouldn't escalate. We expect central banks exit from ultra-
accommodative monetary policy to continue very gradually.
