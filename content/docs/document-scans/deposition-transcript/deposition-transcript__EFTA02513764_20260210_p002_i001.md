The base complex is down significantly tod=y with most of the losses occurring in the morning. The losses in oil have 
spurred Chinese hedge fund selling of copper. Volumes are growing on the LME as Chinese players such as GF Financial, 
Bank of China and China Merchant Services enter the space left by western banks. Copper lead the base complex down 
and did not recover to the same extent in the afterno=n. It crashed through support at $6,000 at around 06:00. The 
90th percen=ile for copper the level where 10% of producers are in the red is expected to be around $5660 which could 
be a key support for the metal. =Decembers Chinese imports are up 7.4% but this is due to the state stockpiler the SRB 
were seen buying in this period so it is unlikely to be all down to physical demand. Chinese demand is expected to rise in 
January as looser credit conditions kick in but the period immediately after Chinese new year is traditionally a time of 
low demand for copper and could expose further weakness in the market. Railway workers have begun a strike on a key 
copper shipping line between Zambia and Tanzania. Aluminium followed the complex down in the morning breaking 
support at $1800 and getting as low as $1772 but recovered in the afternoon. Over capacity in China is likely to increase 
the shipment of aluminium products overseas, easing the supply deficit in the west. In December exports of alumini=m 
and aluminium products rose from 390 kMT to 540 kMT. Chinese producers are being forced to keep running in order to 
service debt despite AZ China estimating that over half of China's capacity is operating at a loss. =Alco Inc expect the 
auto and aerospace sectors to support Aluminium, increasing demand by 7% in 2015. Nickel was firmer in the morning 
but broke support at $15,000 around 10:30 and traded down to $14,800 before noon and then came off again for the 
close. Zinc crashed off at around 10:30, recovered slightly and dropped again at the close. Lead traded down during the 
morning then stabilised around 11:30. Lead traded volumes have quadrupled in 2014 to 2.92mn lots as HKEx attracted 
more inter=st in it's Yuan denominated "mini" contracts. 
Shanghai Aluminium on warrant stocks are up 1.947% to 46 kMT. LME Aluminium on warrant stocks are flat at 1839.8 
kMT. Shanghai Copper on warrant stocks are up 16.48% to 39.3 kMT. LME Copper stocks are up 2.47% to 167 kMT. LME
