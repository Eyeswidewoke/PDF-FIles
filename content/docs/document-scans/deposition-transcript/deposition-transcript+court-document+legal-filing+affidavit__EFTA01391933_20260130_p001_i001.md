Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if the General Partner 
determines in good faith that for legal. tax, regulatory, accounting or other similar 
masons, it is desirable that an investment be made utilizing an alternative investment 
structure, the General Partner shall be permitted to structure the making of all or any 
portion of such investment outside the Partnership, by requiring any Partner or Partners 
to, and such Partner or Partners shall, make such investment either directly or indirectly 
in, and become a limited partner, member, stockholder or other equity owner of, one or 
more partnerships, limited liability companies, corporations or other vehicles (other than 
the Partnership) (each, an "Alternative Investment Vehicle") (i) of which the General 
Partner, an Affiliate of the General Partner or one or more of their respective partners, 
members, managers, directors or officers shall serve as general partner, manager or in a 
similar capacity and (ii) which shall invest on a parallel basis with, or in lieu of, the 
Partnership, as the case may be. Additionally, the General Partner shall be permitted to 
form more than one Alternative Investment Vehicle for the making of a single investment 
and may require that different Partners invest in different Alternative Investment 
Vehicles as the General Partner determines to be necessary• or advisable for legal, tax, 
regulatory. accounting or other similar reasons. 
(b) 
The Limited Partners and the General Partner (or its Affiliate), to the extent of their 
investment participation in an Alternative Investment Vehicle, may be required to make 
capital contributions directly to such Alternative Investment Vehicle to the same extent, 
for the same purposes and on substantially the same terms and conditions as Partners are 
required to make capital contributions to the Partnership, and such capital contributions 
shall reduce the unpaid Subscription of each Partner to the same extent that it would be 
reduced if made to the Partnership (i.e., capital contributions will be treated as if they 
were paid directly to the Partnership). The organizational documents of any such 
Alternative Investment Vehicle may be executed on behalf of Limited Partners investing 
therein by the General Partner pursuant to 14.7.1. 
(c) 
Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the economic 
provisions of this Agreement and the partnership or similar agreement or instrument 
governing each such Alternative Investment Vehicle are intended to be, and hereby shall 
be, construed in all material respects and effected in such a manner as to cause each 
Limited Partner individually, and the General Partner and its affiliated entities that may 
be utilized to effectuate this 3.5 collectively, to receive the same aggregate allocations 
and distributions, at substantially the same times, from the Partnership and the 
Alternative Investment Vehicle as they would have been entitled to receive if (i) all 
capital contributions to the Alternative Investment Vehicle were made to, and all 
distributions from the Alternative Investment Vehicle were made by, the Partnership, 
(ii) all Alternative Investment Vehicle investments in the Underlying Fund and 
Alternative Investment Vehicle short-term investments were initially acquired by, and 
were at all times held by, the Partnership, and (iii) all Alternative Investment Vehicle 
expenses (including management fees incurred or paid by any Alternative Investment 
Vehicle) were incurred and paid solely by the Partnership; provided, however, that the
