Thanks for forwarding me the content of the investigative =eport by ASU related 
to me and my participation, along with Johnny, at =rigins events. I am attaching what you sent to me so that = may 
comment on it.: 
"Four Witnesses reported during the =nvestigation that Respondent once made 
a comment in the presence of =mployees about the physical characteristics of Amber Heard, an actress =nd female 
visitor at Origins Project event. Specifically, during the =ohnny Depp event on February 16, 2016, that Respondent, while 
getting =veryone together to take a picture with Johnny Depp, said, "get =our hot ass over here" when attempting to get 
Amber to join the =icture. During this same event, two witnesses allege that Respondent =old Heard, "Your ass looks 
great." Employees also =ndicate that he talked about how "hot she =as". 
When asked if he ever commented on a =emale's buttocks in front of 
employees, Respondent stated, =E2 Whoa, not that I...I can't imagine doing that =9D. Respondent stated, "Generally, I 
would say that is not a =ood idea" but added that if someone asked his opinion about =omeone, he might respond. 
When asked if he ever made comments about =mber Heard's body, Respondent stated, "No. Amber Heard =s an 
incredibly attractive woman, and everybody understands that and =verybody said it, and she is". 
Respondent stated that he did not =emember telling Heard that her "ass" 
looked good. He =tated, "I don't remember saying it, but it's =he kind of thing that a close friend would say to a close 
friend in the =ontext of [asking for wardrobe advice], but I certainly don't =emember it, but we were very, very close." 
Respondent stated =hat making such comments in the workplace would be outside of normal =onduct for him, but "if it 
would've happened, it would =ave not been at the Origins offices. It would have been in the middle =f an event when we 
were celebrating". 
Factual Determination: Four witnesses =eard Respondent make the statement. 
Although Respondent stated he did =ot remember saying this, he did acknowledge that it is the kind of =hing that a close 
friend would say. It is more likely than not that =espondent made the statements. " 
Hey Lawrence. 
I'm glad to hear from you although, of =ourse, lam saddened that it is under 
these =ircumstances. 
Here is my response, which you may forward to the =niversity if you wish: 
I do not recall this or any incident between us =s being inappropriate. I also feel 
deeply for anyone who feels as =hough they have been the subject of any unwanted attention in this way, =01 hope this 
can provide any clarity on your situation. =nbsp; 
Lawrence Krauss was a close friend, and as I =ecall his behavior towards me was 
gracious and kind during our visits =o the Origins Project. I don't recall any such comments =y him backstage at the 
Origins event, and more generally remember no =nappropriate comments toward me at any time, either in public or 
=ackstage during the events, or at our home or elsewhere, and we left =11 of our interactions with both him, and his 
Origins staff, feeling =ery well treated. The Origins events were a highlight for =e. 
I =ope this lays this issue to rest.
