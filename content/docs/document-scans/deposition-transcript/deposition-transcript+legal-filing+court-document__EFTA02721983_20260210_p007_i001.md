because of our occupation, our greedy quest for oil, our failure to extend a hand of 
"engagement," Israel's building settlements, our making videos that defy me Mohammed and so 
on. Again, the relationship is defined by the enemy blaming us for his actions and our accepting 
such responsibility. 
Shelby Steele has written brilliantly about what he calls "white guilt" and outlines how whites 
during the 60's and thereafter were pressured into a transaction whereby in order to re-obtain a 
sense of moral authority they accepted blame for the condition of blacks and behaved as if guilty. 
Blacks were able to extract great concessions and whites were able to view themselves as morally 
restored and redeemed. At a certain point, however, the behavior takes on a life of its own and 
the narratives become deeply embedded in the culture and, as we can see today, difficult to 
uproot. 
Western guilt is an extension of Steele's notion. President Obama's confessionals to the Arab 
world admitting that America has made "mistakes" and was not born a colonial pow er express 
this same tendency to appease through guilt. Hillary Clint on's "reset" with Russia conveyed the 
same submissive request for a more acceptable response. In being guilty we presume the other 
party will recognize our contrition and respond in like kind. One of the Control Factor's most 
devastating moves is employed- presuming the other is just like us and will respond the way we 
would. This is frequently how an enabler justifies his continuous support for an addict. The 
problem, however is that our Islamic Enemy is NOT like us and will not respond in like kind. 
Rather, as we repeatedly refuse to learn, appeasement invites more abuse from an 
enemy. This becomes the "game of guilt;" it tends to expand to greater and greater consequences. 
Paradoxically, psychological defenses tend to create the very outcomes they seek to eliminate and 
it is no different here. It is a game we love to play but, unfortunately, the game gives us no rules 
for how to end it. 
All beha vior is instructive. That is, we teach others how to treat us. The game of guilt, along with 
other Control Factor tools, teaches our Enemy it is winning and to continue playing. 
FP: The reason Nidal Hasan was able to perpetrate his murder spree at Fort Hood is precisely 
because of our Control Factor. Please connect the dots for our readers. 
Siegel: Just as I used to look at Hitler when I was young and be amazed that no one could see 
what he was about, in retrospect the same applies to Hasan. It is precisely all the elements of the 
Control Factor that could allow this man, a Soldier of Allah, to be positioned as he was. He was 
blatantly voicing his Islamist views and Jihadi intent including, even, an essay recommending the 
"painful liquidation" of non-Muslims. Yet, in the Army of all places, the Control Factor operated 
to allow and even foster his work. Even after the murders, we cont inue the denial by calling it 
"workplace violence." He is the Civilization-Violent Jihad combo! And we continue to enable the 
same infiltration elsewhere. 
FP: Tell our readers about "The Project" and "Explanatory Memorandum." These are realities 
that serve as great threats to the Control Factor, right? 
Siegel: These arc separate sets of documents that outline the Muslim Brotherhood's goals and 
plans underlying the Civilization Jihad. The former was discovered in Europe and extends
