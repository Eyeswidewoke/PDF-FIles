SOP III -1081 Southern Financial LLC 
6.3 
Tax Distributions. Notwithstanding Section 6.2, with respect to any 
Portfolio Investment, the Fund may, at any time, out of Distributable Cash from any 
source, make distributions ("Tax Distributions") to all Partners (other than any Defaulting 
Partners or any Excused Partners with respect to such Portfolio Investment), regardless of 
their tax status, in amounts intended to enable such Partners (or any Person whose tax 
liability is determined by reference to the income of any such Partner) to discharge their 
tax liabilities arising from allocations made (or to be made) pursuant to Section 6.8 or 
7.5, and any distributions made, with respect to such Portfolio Investment. The amount 
of each Tax Distribution shall be determined by the General Partner in its reasonable 
discretion, taking into account the maximum effective United Kingdom tax rate 
applicable to individuals or corporations (whichever is higher) on income and gains, as 
the case may be, and the amounts of income and gains allocated to the Partners pursuant 
to this Agreement, and otherwise based on such assumptions as the General Partner 
determines in its reasonable discretion to be appropriate. The amount distributable to any 
Partner pursuant to any clause of Section 6.2 shall be reduced by any Tax Distributions 
made to such Partner and not previously taken into account pursuant to this sentence, and 
such Tax Distributions shall also be deemed to have been distributed pursuant to such 
clause of Section 6.2 for purposes of making the calculations required by this Agreement, 
so that to the extent possible each Partner receives in the aggregate pursuant to Section 
6.2 and this Section 6.3 the amount it would have received pursuant to Section 6.2 as if 
this Section 6.3 were not included in this Agreement. For purposes of the preceding 
sentence, the General Partner shall allocate in its sole discretion any distributions 
received by the Special Limited Partner pursuant to this Section 6.3 among Distributable 
Cash apportioned to each Partner. 
6.4 
General Distribution Provisions. 
(a) 
Overriding Limitations on Distributions. Notwithstanding any other 
provision of this Agreement, distributions shall be made only to the extent of Available

Fund pursuant to this Article VI or Article XI to the Person shown on the Register as a

right to receive such distributions as provided herein, shall, to the fullest extent permitted 
by applicable law, acquit the Fund and the General Partner of all liability to any other 
Person that may be interested in such distribution by reason of any Transfer of such 
Person's Interest for any reason (including a Transfer of such Interest by reason of the 
death, incompetence, bankruptcy or liquidation of such Person). 
(c) 
Reservation of Rights. The Fund shall be entitled to have a reservation of 
rights for all distributions received by the Limited Partners, pursuant to the General 
Partner's right to require the Partners to return distributions to the Fund pursuant to 
Section 9.2. The Fund and the Partners hereby agree that all distributions received by the
