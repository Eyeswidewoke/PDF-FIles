Alan Loeb was brought in for a rewrite. Pressman asked me to meet Loeb at the Carlyle Ilotel to explain the 
social rhythms of New York's financial high society. Whereas Gekko's character was modeled after '70s junk bond kings 
(Michael Milken) and '80s mergers and acquisitions killers (Henry Kravis), Loeb bases the new villain on hedge fund 
billionaires like John Paulson and Mike Novogratz. geniuses who have created stratospheric wealth beyond Gordon 
Gekko's wildest dreams. When Oliver Stone agreed to direct, he rewrote a portion of the script to focus on bankers as well 
as hedge funders, taking no screen credit. 
This past September. Oliver yelled. "action" as Gordon Geklco, with long grey hair. comes back to life as he 
emerges from a lengthy prison stint shot outside of Sing Sing in Ossining, New York. Gekko is desperate to redefine 
himself in a different cm. The New York Post runs a full-page photo of Gekko and Ncw Yorkers immediately become 
obsessed with the filming of Wall Street 2. 
A week into shooting, a glorious fall day. Ed Pressman invites me on the set at the Central Park Zoo. Oliver 
designs an elaborate tracking shot around the seal pool where fiekko, fresh from jail, walks and talks to Jake Moore, a 
young idealistic investment banker played by Shia LaBoeuf. They discuss Gekko's daughter MIMIC, Moore's fiancee. 
played by Carrie Mulligan, who is also having an off-screen romance with LaBoeuf Oliver played Cupid. Moore invites 
Gekko to the Alzheimer's Ball at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Dekko, who used to be a sponsor or honoree of such 
events, cannot even afford a ticket. 
The shot starts with a barking seal jumping for fish, then pans down to the actors. Extras weave in and out. In 
one take Michael makes a wrong turn and ends up at the monkey house. Everyone laughs. The atmosphere on the set is 
courteous but quick and tense. There is pressure when you arc making a sequel to a hit. 
I watch the action on monitors while sitting on the producers' canvas chairs with Pressman. Eric KopeloIT 
("Monsters Ball") and Celia Costas, who was a location manager on the first "Wall Street." They have asked me to be an 
extra in the Alzheimer's Ball scene and bring some friends to play rich Upper East Side socialites. Oliver wants over the 
top glam, go-to-the-vault jewels and couture gowns. "Give me the night before the Titanic goes down," were his exact 
words. Not a problem. 
I pay a quick visit to Michael in his trailer on Fifth Avenue where he is resting. We go way back. I was his 
personal publicist when he won the Golden Globe and Oscar for Best Actor for 'Wall Street" and we have remained great 
friends. Gekko is just as challenging for him the second time because of endless pages of technical financial dialogue. We 
discuss Catherine Zeta-Jones' Broadway debut in a "Little Night Music." Michael has a stack of partially finished 
handwritten thank you notes next to him for gilts received for their shared birthday party on September 25th at the St. 
Regis. Her 40th and his 65th. 
I tell him I have been cast as an extra in two scenes and he laughs knowing I am desperate to hang around him 
and the production. 
8:30 a.m. on Wednesday. October 2Ist, another wann, stunning fall day. I report to the wardrobe trailer on 65th 
Street and Madison Avenue. I carry four elaborate cocktail dresses and bags of matching accessories. My hair is in rollers. 
Statuesque Julia Koch walks over from her Park Avenue apartment carrying her white Valentino and long diamond 
earrings. Her real-life financial titan husband David is unaware where she is this morning.
