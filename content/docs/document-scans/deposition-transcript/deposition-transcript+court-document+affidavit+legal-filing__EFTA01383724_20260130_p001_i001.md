Ill decide not to tender, how will the Offer affect my Shares and what will happen to Mobileye? 
After the Offe• Closing, we intend to cause Mobileye to terminate the listing of the Shares on NYSE (the 
"Detesting"). As a result, we anticipate that there will not be an active trading market for the Shares. In addition. 
after the Offer Closing. we intend to cause Mobileye to terminate the registration of Shares under the Exchange 
Act as promptly as practicable and take steps to cause the suspension of its reporting obligations with respect to 
the Shares with the SEC. As a result, with respect to the Shares. Mobileye would no longer be required to make 
filings with the SEC or otherwise comply with the rules of the SEC relating to foreign private issuers. 
Furthermore, the ability of "affiliates" of Mobileye and persons holding "restricted securities" of Mobileye to 
dispose of such securities pursuant to Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities 
Act"). may be impaired or eliminated. 
In addition, you should be aware that, after amendment of Mobileye's articles of association, following the 
Offer Closing, pursuant to the Conversion Resolutions proposed to be approved at the EGM. record ownership of 
Mobileye shares can only be transferred pursuant to a notarial deed executed before a Dutch notary. This will 
require compliance by the transferor and transferee of Shares with various administrative formalities under Dutch 
law and will also require shareholders to incur costs for Dutch notarial fees when they transfer Mobileye shares. 
If such amendment to Mobileye's articles of association becomes effective prior to or during the Subsequent 
Offering Period or the Minority Exit Offering Period, then all transfers of record ownership of Shares to the 
Purchaser during the Subsequent Offering Period, and (if applicable) the Minority Exit Offering Period, must be
