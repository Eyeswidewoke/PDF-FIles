requested that the trash at 358 El 
Brillo Way be collected for evidentiary purposes. I contacted Sanitation Supervisor 
Tony Higgins at ext 7041 and requested that the trash be collected while an 
investigator observes the collection. He then contacted Jeff Williams, who is the 
employee on that route and informed him to contact me prior to picking up the trash. 
At 9:30 a.m., I had not received a call from Mr. Williams so I responded to the area

driving his collection vehicle eastbound on El Brillo to South County Road. I met
