continued to clearly state her positions on Donald Trump's baseless claims that the 2020 
election was fraudulent and on the Jan. 6 vote to certify Trump's loss." Cheney "has been telling 
people that if holding onto her leadership role requires having to lie or stay quiet, she doesn't 
believe that's a price worth paying." 
The Washington Post (5/5, 10.52M) editorializes, "A strong conservative on policy, Ms. 
Cheney faces punishment for refusing to embrace, or at least to accept with silence, the 
falsehood that the Democrats stole the 2020 presidential election. ... Two-thirds of GOP House 
members, many of whom secretly agree with her, would have to vote to remove her. They must 
ask themselves whether they want to pledge their allegiance even more fully to a single man, 
over truth, principle and the integrity of U.S. democracy." 
The New York Daily News (5/5, 2.51M) editorializes, "The top Republican in the House is 
trying to oust from leadership a staunch conservative whose sole sin, from the perspective of 
the new Grand Old Party, has been honesty, standing up to Donald Trump's corrosive, anti-
democratic lies about the 2020 election. ... If [House Minority Leader] McCarthy gets his way, 
he'll defenestrate the most prominent congresswoman who cares about extracting that poison 
from Republican veins. He must fail." 
In a piece for the New York Times (5/5, 20.6M) headlined "Why Trump Still Has Millions Of 
Americans In His Grip," Thomas Edsall writes that starting in the mid-1960s, "the priorities of 
the Democratic Party began to shift away from white working- and middle-class voters - many 
of them socially conservative, Christian and religiously observant. ... By the 1970s, many white 
Americans...felt that they were being shouldered aside. ... These voters became the shock 
troops of the Reagan Revolution; they now dominate Trump's Republican Party." 
Stefanik Could Replace Cheney As Soon As Next Week. The New York Times (5/5, 
Fandos, Edmondson, 20.6M) reports "top Republicans moved swiftly on Wednesday to purge" 
Cheney from the leadership, "laying the groundwork to install a replacement who has embraced 
his false claims of voting fraud." Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY) "is more moderate" than Cheney 
"and has more often parted ways with Republicans over her years in Congress, but she has 
emerged recently as one of Mr. Trump's most vociferous defenders, willing to indulge and even 
amplify those claims." 
USA Today (5/5, Behrmann, 12.7M) says Stefanik is backed by House Minority Whip 
Scalise and other leading House Republicans. The Washington Post (5/5, 10.52M) says the 
"onetime moderate whose recent rise was propelled by her embrace of Trump and vigorous 
defense of his actions during both his impeachment trials" is likely to be tapped to replace 
Cheney "next week, when the House returns from a recess." Trump endorsed Stefanik on 
Wednesday. The New York Daily News (5/5, Sommerfeldt, Goldiner, 2.51M) reports Trump said 
in a statement, "Liz Cheney is a warmongering fool who has no business in Republican Party 
Leadership. Elise Stefanik is a far superior choice, and she has my COMPLETE and TOTAL 
Endorsement for GOP Conference Chair. Elise is a tough and smart communicator!" 
Jonathan Karl said on ABC World News TonightVi (5/5, story 3, 2:45, Muir, 6.42M), 
"Trump himself endorsed [Stefanik] to replace Cheney in the Republican leadership. Cheney 
actually voted for the Trump agenda nearly 93% of the time - much more than Stefanik. But on 
January 6, Stefanik went along with his election lie and voted to overturn Joe Biden's win." 
Nancy Cordes said on the CBS Evening NewsVi (5/5, lead story, 4:00, O'Donnell, 4.03M), "On 
his own website," Trump backed Stefanik "to take Cheney's place. Stefanik thanked him for his 
'100% support." 
The Hill (5/5, Choi, 5.69M) reports the conservative Club For Growth on Wednesday came 
out against Stefanik. The group tweeted, "Elise Stefanik is NOT a good spokesperson for the 
House Republican Conference. She is a liberal with a 35% CFGF lifetime rating, 4th worst in the 
House GOP. House Republicans should find a conservative to lead messaging and win back the 
House Majority." The group "was referring to its own scoring system that it uses to grade 
federal lawmakers."
