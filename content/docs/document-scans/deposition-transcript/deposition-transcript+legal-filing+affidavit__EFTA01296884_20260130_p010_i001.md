United States Courts Opinions: Supreme Court of New York: Neary v Burns US Official 
News April 1, 2014 Tuesday 
Neptune LLC could elect to dissolve and sell the premises pursuant to the majority vote of 
its members, it could not evict Neary, Benevento, and Carmel and was required to sell the 
Neptune Avenue premises subject to their rent-stabilized leases. 
In December 2010, Burns resigned as the manager of 2784 LLC, and Judice is now its 
current manager. Burns claims that he and now Judice have been distributing 2784 LLC 
funds from the sale of the 2784 premises pro rata to the members after enough cash is 
accumulated and obligations paid, and that plaintiffs admit that they received distributions 
as members. The Neptune Avenue premises have not yet been sold and Benevento and 
Neary remain in occupancy as tenants there. 
On March 18, 2011, plaintiffs filed the instant action, which initially named 2784 LLC and 
Burns, along with McRory and McRory, PLLC and Raymond McRory, Esq. (collectively, 
the McRory defendants), as defendants. On May 2, 2011, plaintiffs served a complaint, 
and, on May 16, 2011, plaintiffs served an amended verified complaint as of right pursuant 
to CPLR 3025 (a). Plaintiffs' amended complaint alleged that Burns, acting on behalf of 
2784 LLC and his own personal interests, unilaterally and improperly diverted funds 
belonging to 2784 LLC for purposes unrelated to it, including making payments in excess 
of $200,000 to buy out the tenants who resided in the building at the Neptune Avenue 
premises, and making payments of legal fees to the McRory defendants unrelated to 2784 
LLC. It further alleged that Burns, acting on behalf of 2784 LLC and his own personal 
interests, unilaterally and improperly withheld from the net proceeds realized from the sale 
of the 2784 premises distributions due to them because they had not vacated their rent-
stabilized apartments at the Neptune Avenue premises. Specifically, plaintiffs alleged that 
Burns withheld the sum of approximately $40,000 (as of the date of the amended 
complaint) in partial distributions due to them from the sale of the 2784 premises. Plaintiffs 
asserted that Burns, as the manager of 2784 LLC, owed them a fiduciary duty as members 
of 2784 LLC. 
Plaintiffs' amended complaint alleged three causes of action. Plaintiffs' first cause of action 
against Burns and 2784 LLC sought an accounting of the affairs and monies of 2784 LLC. 
Plaintiffs' second cause of action against Burns alleged that Burns diverted monies 
belonging to 2784 LLC and withheld distributions due to them from the sale of rtlithe 2784 
premises, which constituted a breach of his fiduciary duties to them. It sought a judgment 
surcharging Bums in the amounts which are determined to be improperly diverted, 
converted, and/or misappropriated. Plaintiffs' third cause of action against the McRory 
defendants sought a judgment requiring them to disgorge all legal fees paid to them by 
2784 LLC which were unrelated to 2784 LLC. 
On September 15, 2011, Burns served an answer to plaintiffs' amended complaint, which 
denied its material allegations and raised four affirmative defenses. Burns' first affirmative 
defense alleged that plaintiffs' amended complaint fails to state a cause of action. Burns' 
second affirmative defense alleged that the court should not proceed in the absence of 
persons who should be parties. Burns' third affirmative defense alleged that Benevento 
has no standing and is not a proper party to this action as he is a co-executor acting 
without authority in relation to the Estate of Julia, who was the member of 2784 LLC, and 
that Neary has no standing and is not a proper party to this action as he is a member of a 
group called the Neary Group that is the member of 2784 LLC. Bums' third affirmative
