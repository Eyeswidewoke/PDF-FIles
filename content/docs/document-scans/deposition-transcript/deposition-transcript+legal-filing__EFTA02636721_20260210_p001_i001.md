Eve= more important would be proof of travel schedule - proof not physically th=re during time period - 9/2001 and 
weekly as alleged. 
Only real threat criminally is rape even though b=sed on 100% false facts. SOL as opposed to 5 year SOL and obviously 
m=st inflammatory along with 14-15 year old age claim. Easy to make a f=lse claim.

Another respo=se would be for AD to respond by letting him know in no uncertain terms tha= this is a

Again, I doubt this would have any i=pact in the guy. It is possible he has been duped and he should take t=e ethical

Another view would be to try to pr=empt him by AD reporting the extortion effort to the bar and even

Another course would be to resp=nd and have a lawyer want to hear him out, etc. to give you more time
