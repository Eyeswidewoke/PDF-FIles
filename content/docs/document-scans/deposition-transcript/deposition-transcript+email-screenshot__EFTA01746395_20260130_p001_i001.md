Mattie Siegal 
As one of my bi-annual visits, 
I took her to dinner tonight at The Polo Bar... 
Mattie then came up to my apartment, I thought to get clothes and burst int= tears wanting to know how I could be so 
horrible to her father. Why didn=t I just call him when our mother died to work things out. Why did I call=a lawyer? 
Mattie said her father had to take a second mortgage out on his house to pa= me. 
She cried her eyes out and said it was all her fault because he had to pay =or college education and other things for her. 
She is 26 now and people g=aduate from college at 21? How long do they pay for college. She went to S=idmore for two 
years then lived with me and went to Hunter. 
She seemed to have no idea that I had been cheated out of money by both my =other and brother. When she tried to 
blame my mother, I gently told her m= mother gave her father money because her father ASKED for it. 
I patiently tried to explain that I was legally untitled to half of my fath=r's estate and that for her entire 26 years, which 
is the same 26 years si=ce my father's death...that my mother gave me virtually nothing while supp=rting my brother 
(and his family). She said she was a child and knew not=ing of this. 
She said her father is the most loving and devoted father in the world. A w=nderful person. 
I told her that was true but we were missing some information because I did='t think he could make a good living. I said 
he took money from our mothe= that was meant for me...that as wonderful a person he is, he is a thief. =20 
She said he is unaware of any wrong doing and is so hurt that he will never=speak to me again. Why did I do this to her 
family? 
She said if and when she gets married, her father will not let her invite m= to the wedding. She has been dating a lovely 
guy for five years, who is =dorable, a photographer and will never make a living. I am dreading the da= she marries him. 
The whole scene was so heartbreaking. She tried to give me the impression h=r father thought he had not done nothing 
wrong. She was devastated and co=fused. 
The idea that in a family a man and a women, a brother and a sister, legall=, socially, emotionally are to be treated 
equally was something she had no= thought thru. 
I think she wants me to fix this...which is a tall order. 
It broke my heart to see her cry and cry. She told me this is why she only=sees me a few times a year...and that her 
father has never said not to see=me. 
What a night. Your thoughts?
