Case 1:22-cv-10019-JSR Document 181-2 Filed 06/22/23 Page 8 of 13 
HOW WILL THE CLASS REPRESENTATIVE'S LAWYERS BE PAID? 
BSF and EHL, as Class Counsel, will file a motion for an award of attorneys' fees, costs, and expenses that will be 
considered at the Settlement Hearing. Class Counsel will apply for an attorneys' fee award in an amount not to exceed 
thirty percent (30%) of the Global Settlement Amount, plus payment of their costs, charges, and expenses incurred in 
connection with this Litigation in an amount not to exceed $2,500,000.00, plus interest earned on both amounts at the same 
rate as earned by the Qualified Settlement Fund. Such sums as may be approved by the Court will be paid from the Global 
Settlement Fund. Class Members are not personally liable for any such fees or expenses. 
The attorneys' fees and costs, charges, and expenses requested will be the only payment to Class Counsel for their 
efforts in achieving this Settlement and for their risk in undertaking this representation on a wholly contingent basis. The 
fees requested will compensate Class Counsel for their work in achieving the Settlement. The Court will decide what 
constitutes a reasonable fee award and may award less than the amount requested. Class Counsel shall not share any 
amount of attorneys' fees, costs, or expenses awarded to them with any other firm or individual. 
CAN I EXCLUDE MYSELF FROM THE SETTLEMENT? 
Yes. If you do not want to receive a payment from this Settlement or you want to keep the right to sue or continue 
to sue Defendant on your own about the legal issues in this case, then you must take steps to exclude yourself from, or "opt 
out" of, the Class. If you are requesting exclusion because you want to bring your own lawsuit based on the matters alleged 
in this Litigation, you may want to consult an attorney and discuss whether any individual claim that you may wish to 
pursue would be time-barred by the applicable statutes of limitation or repose. 
To exclude yourself from the Class, you complete and submit an Opt-Out Form to the Claims Administrator no 
later than 
 2023, at: 
[To Be Determined by the Court] 
[X] (Claims Administrator's Address) 
Email: [X] (Claims Administrator's email) 
You cannot exclude yourself by phone or by e-mail. If you make a proper request for exclusion, you will not 
receive a settlement payment, and you cannot object to the Settlement. If you make a proper request for exclusion, you will 
not be legally bound by anything that happens in this lawsuit. 
CAN I OBJECT TO THE SETTLEMENT, THE REQUESTED ATTORNEYS' FEES, THE REQUESTED 
PAYMENT OF COSTS AND EXPENSES AND/OR THE PLAN OF ALLOCATION? 
Yes. If you are a Class Member, you may object to the terms of the Settlement. Whether or not you object to the 
terms of the Settlement, you may also object to the requested attorneys' fees, costs, charges, and expenses and/or the Plan 
of Allocation described herein and in the Stipulation of Settlement. In order for any objection to be considered, you must 
file a written statement, accompanied by proof of Class membership, with the Court and send a copy to Class Counsel and 
Defendant's Counsel, at the addresses listed below by 
, 2023. 
The Court's address is: Hon. Jed S. Rakoff, Daniel Patrick Moynihan United States Courthouse, 500 Pearl Street, 
New York, NY 10007; Class Counsel's address is: Boies Schiller Flexner LLP, 55 Hudson Yards, 20th Floor, New York, 
NY 10001, do Andrew Villacastin; Defendant's Counsel's address is: Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP, 60 
State Street, Boston MA 02109, do John Butts. 
You may attend the Settlement Hearing and you may ask to speak to present any objections you have, but 
attendance at the Settlement Hearing is not necessary. Persons wishing to be heard orally at the Settlement Hearing, 
however, are required to indicate in their written objection their intention to appear at the hearing and identify any witnesses 
they may call to testify and exhibits, if any, they intend to introduce into evidence. 
WHAT ARE MY RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE SETTLEMENT? 
If you are a Class Member and you do not exclude yourself from the Class, you may receive the benefit of, and you 
will be bound by, the terms of the Settlement described in this Notice, upon approval by the Court.
