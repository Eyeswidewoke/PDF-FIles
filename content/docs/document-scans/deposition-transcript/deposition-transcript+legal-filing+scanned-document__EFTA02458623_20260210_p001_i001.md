today I conducted an experiment encouraged by No=m's wholly justified aggressive and detailed directives to joscha. . 
=AO =oshcha focused on layers being developed in the brain . the t=ming for the development of each layer being 
different per species .=C2 
I postulate that music might be a frosted window in=o that structure. 
symphonies begin with their firs= " layer " a 
theme. in fact , there might be =ore than one theme in the first layer „ the second part of symphon=c form is the 
complex development stage. where tho=e themes are inverted, deconstructed, reconstructed etc =AO ,and the 
development stage takes the most time . in=C2 the conclusion of the symphonic form the recapitulation =f all that 
has come before it forms a " phenenoma of the piece &qu=t; a whole ,made up of its smaller concepts . As o=posed 
to listening to music to record which neuron is firing, as mos= musciolgists</=pan> attempt . I propose that the music 
may be the audible re=ult of those neurons firing, made possible by a select few who would=attempt to notate those 
neuronal firings. Beethove= for example. 
The experiment . I mas=ed all of the four symphonies together , playing =ecordings of the 3rd 5th 6th 7th all 
overlayed on each othe=, playing at the same time. - the way a brain might develop.=C2 I expected an ordered noise 
but to the surprising contrary ,=C2 
IT WAS AMAZING. . you can hear =ew "concepts " forming, 
</=iv> 
it wonder whether in the mind of a blind child , the " music" =AO would be created even without the visual referencial. 
but created no=e the less. later when the visual can be tied to c=ncepts , the anatomy may be hijacked to produce 
sounds . that someho= relate to the concepts. . 
I tried to mix m=sic from different cultures- it didn't work. African=does not work with western europe,- chinese works 
with neither of the other two. =but within the same cultural music ( the brain of the local sp=cies ) the mash ups are 
beautiful. 
I would note that computers engage i= "parallel processing" only in order to take a hard =roblem and break it into its 
component parts , working on each component s=parately, 
here each problem Interacts and the their resolutions 
interact in remarkable ways.
