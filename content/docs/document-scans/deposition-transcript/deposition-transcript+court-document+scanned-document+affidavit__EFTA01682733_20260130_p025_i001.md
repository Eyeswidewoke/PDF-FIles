affrey Epstein, Pervert 
Posted by Taki Theodoracopulos on October 03, 2007 
He lives on the same street two blocks east of me, and his house is reported to be the largest in 
_ Manhattan, and I have bumped into him at times—literally—but he is as disgusting a human being as 
it is possible to be and still be out of jail. But not for long. Jeffrey Epstein, a big-time Noo Yawk 
- investment manager and multi-billionaire has agreed to plead guilty to soliciting underage prostitutes 
at his Palm Beach mansion in a deal that will send him to prison for about 18 months. 
- This is the semi-official announcement. The reality is somewhat different. Epstein got his start when ' 
Lesley Wexner, the Limited department store tycoon, took him under his wing and showed him the 
ropes, so to speak. Needless to say, there were a hell of a lot of rumours flying around about the 
- tutelage, but what is certain is that Epstein ended up becoming a multi-billionaire financial adviser and  
close friend to Bill Clinton and Ghislaine Maxwell. Epstein flew Clinton around Africa on his private 
— jet, partied with Prince Andrew and became a business partner of Mort Zuckerman, the real estate 
— shark who poses as a writer and columnist in the newspaper and magazine he owns. 
Once, walking down my street towards the park, we came face to face and I refused to give way and 
 
=bumped into him. He protested. "In the past, people like you would get off the sidewalk for people like I 
me under the penalty of death..."0 said I, evoking a Samurai custom. He was appalled but there was 
— nothing he could do, as he had stepped out without his heavies. A Vanity Fair article about three years  
— ago hinted at sexual shenanigans but was not specific. I knew better but libel laws prevent me from 
spilling the beans. Now, according to newspaper reports, Epstein has made a deal with the Feds, and 
- will get a few months in a country club jail. What is known is that he had under age girls in his Florida --
— mansion giving massages and oral sex. What I know is that these girls were not pros, but daughters of 
trailer park trash parents who were brought to him by the pimps he employed to do just that. Tabloids 
— in the UK have hinted that Ghislaine Maxwell was the beard while the two went on fishing 
— expeditions. I'm not so sure. 
What is sure is that Andrew Windsor is a fool. Clinton never had and never will have any dignity, but 
— Andrew does represent Britain in a way, and should behave accordingly.

 Students of Ancient Greece might pick up the signals: very young boys resemble very young girls, but 
if you need more details all you have to do is pick up professor Dover's classic, Greek 
_ Homosexuality.° What I find disgusting is that a billionaire or a celebrity can get away with murder in 
the Land of the Depraved , as this Proctor man just did in Los Angeles, and as Epstein has in plea 
— bargaining a lousy 18 months. Here is Conrad Black facing years in the pokey for—in my opinion—
enriching Telegraph stock owners as well as himself; and a Clinton-Maxwell-Zuckerman buddy can

And speaking of Spectator owners, I was extremely sad to read of Ian Gilmour's death. Lord Gilmour 
was the first man to write a letter to Conrad when Lord Black and I had our famous falling out over 
— Marc Rich and Israel. In fact he also wrote a letter of support when I got into trouble and was sent to 
Pentonville 25 years ago. For drug possession, I might add. He never once remonstrated with me over 
7 my undying support for Lady Thatcher because, unlike so many hypocrites in politics, Ian Gilmour 
-- actually practiced what he preached. He was a high Tory and Libertarian and he let people be. Under 
his ownership and while he was editor the Speccie hit an all-time high of prestige and influence, and
