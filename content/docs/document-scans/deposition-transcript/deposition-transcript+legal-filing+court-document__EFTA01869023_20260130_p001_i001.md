The first pays a relatively low rate of interest (5ish). 
TD has interest paid through maturity and real estate taxes paid for year and a Jan 2011 appraisal @ $40M (or 
50% loan to value). 
Plus they know about a holder of a $5M second who presumably has resources to refinance in November when 
the first is due to protect his position. 
I don't see TD's incentive to discount. 
I think Kosoy could refinance TD if he was forced to.

He is looking for a new $10 million second to refinance the existing $5,332,695.25 second mortgage loan that 
has been in place since January 2011. Before January 2011 there was no second. The new second would 
be junior to the existing first mortgage ban(s) held by TD Bank (successor to Mercantile) now totaling 
$21,200,000 but which he would pay down to 520,200,000 out of the proceeds of the new second. TD 
extended the due date of the first until October 30, 2011 (when the existing second was put on) and Dan 
thinks TD will further extend it until Spring/Summer 2012 with an additional paydown. The existing second 
matures in January 2012. Basically, he is seeking another selling season. 
This is his proposed use of proceeds: 
Principal reduction on TD first 
$1,000,000 
Interest reserve for first (to July 31, 2012) 
800.000 
Reserve for 2011 real property taxes 
200,000 
Pay off existing second 
5,332,693 
Closing costs of refinancing 
200,000 
Reserve for maintenance, insurance and 
other bits for 1220 
1,000,000 
For "Dan to live on" 
1,467,307 
Obviously, there is play in this. 
We did not discuss interest rates or any other financial terms. 
The existing second mortgage lender is New Providence Capital Management Partners II Limited (NPCM), a 
Bahamian international business company, with an address in Nassau. It is controlled by David Kosoy, a 
Canadian who has been dabbling in Palm Beach real estate for 20 years and who has a piece of the Royal 
Poinciana Plaza along with Lee Munder. Dan said the interest rate is "in the fives-. It is due in January 2012-
academic since the first is due October 30, 2011. The subordination agreement between NPCM and TD 
prohibits any current payment of principal or interest on the second while the first is outstanding. I assume 
there was a reserve or discount to compensate for this. It does not appear that Dan personally guaranteed 
the second. 
I think (but don't know) that Dan found Kosoy through Jim McCann who has had some dealing over the years 
with Kosoy. Kosoy is a Toronto based real estate developer who buys distressed real estate and value
