and and sometimes as a foil from history against which we measure our so called greatest hits. 
In all cases, the works have to be performed and experienced and therefore performed. And 
we have a loyal following in the hall and on the Internet. So something is working. 
2) The format of the concerts is a curated one that links music with literature, politics, history—a 
necessary part of what music is. In that sense the ASO is totally unique. 
3) Botstein and the ASO. The truth is that I have been such a thorn of the side of critics, 
conductors and managers that I am not surprised at what you found. But you will find support 
and real support within the profession. Pardon the expression but I have not gotten medals and 
awards for anything but my work in music. I just got the Bruckner Medal this month (the 
other recipients have been Toscanini and Walter, among others). And I got the same Austrian 
Cross for contributions to music as Sir Simon Rattle--the same year. i hate that stuff, but there 
it is. 
On I--again think of Nabokov, whose favorite Russian poets were often obscure figures derided 
by all the other critics. He stood alone. The Marschner is beautiful opera and a crucial link 
between Beethoven and Wagner. So I stand in the Quixotic defense of works that arc worth it--
even if they are not as good as others. Music does not follow Darwinian patterns (a longer 
discussion). It is not science. That is, if i may say so, a commonplace; the idea that history is a 
judge that seems right but is not. One of the greatest plays was forgotten after the writer died 
and rediscovered in the 1920s, 100 years later—Woyzeck. That is just one example. 
As to 2, that is one way to build an audience, by linking music to other forms of life--to 
pretentiously paraphrase Wittgenstein. 
And to No 3) I am still haunted by early criticisms by angry competitors and idiot ignorant critics 
who hated my ideas and the fact that I was an outsider with another career in scholarship and 
education. 
That being said, why not give me one last shot at proving the majority wrong. I have been at it 
for nearly 25 years, and in the next five, if there can be no measured improvement on the 
execution front--then that will be that. But 120,000 sales and a Grammy nomination for a rare 
work--a Popov symphony from the 1930s,--and more than 20 years of some real success (we 
have generated a body of new scholarship in music history--is cause enough to inspire you to 
give us help. 
This is my plea. But I am not Moses, and if there were a God, he would not be on my side. 
(Another reason to help). 
I greatly cherish this new friendship and I have real admiration for how you go about doing 
things----tough as it is often I truly enjoy the argument. But this time I and not your 
preliminary findings and researchers--am right. Given the firestorm I created 20 years ago I am 
even surprised I did as well in your research, whatever grade you put on the result. it is not 
the final exam, only a badly constructed mid-term, I am a bit proud not to have gotten a top 
grade. True controversy rarely leads to praise in this business. Nabokov became famous and 
admired only at the end.
