C. 
Interviews of Witnesses Who Were Not Sexually Abused 
1. Juan Alessi 
Juan Alessi was interviewed on July 13, 2019 in Florida. Juan Alessi ("Mr. Alessi") 
worked for Epstein as the house manager at his Palm Beach residence from the early 1990s until 
the end of 2002. Additionally, his wife, Maria Alessi, ("Ms. Alessi") also worked at Epstein's 
Palm Beach residence. Mr. Alessi recalled that in or about 1993, Ghislaine Maxwell took charge 
of managing Epstein's residences in Palm Beach, New York, New Mexico, the Virgin Islands, 
and Ohio. Around that time, Epstein specifically instructed Mr. Alessi to go to Maxwell for 
orders. Mr. Alessi described Maxwell as extremely demanding and compared working under her 
to "slavery." 
Mr. Alessi recalled that his relationship with Epstein began to deteriorate beginning in 
approximately 2000, when Maxwell instructed Mr. Alessi and other house staff not to make eye 
contact or be in the same room with Epstein. Around this same period, Mr. Alessi recalled that 
Epstein received approximately three massages per day when he was staying at his Palm Beach 
residence. Mr. Alessi understood most of the masseuses to be professional massage therapists 
from around the Palm Beach area, several of whom provided massages for Epstein's guests, 
including business partners and prominent people, at the Palm Beach residence. At first, Mr. 
Alessi was responsible for scheduling Epstein's frequent massage appointments, but during the 
last several weeks of his employment, 
was hired as Epstein's personal assistant and 
began scheduling the appointments instead. 
Closer to the end of his tenure, Maxwell asked Mr. Alessi to compile a list of all hotels 
and spas around the area of Palm Beach. After Mr. Alessi compiled the list, Maxwell instructed 
him to drive her around to each location. Maxwell would enter each location, then return with 
business cards of massage therapists. Mr. Alessi recalls one such incident in or around the 
summer of 2002 when he drove Maxwell to Mar-a-Lago and waited for her to receive a massage 
there. After Maxwell returned to the car, she observed a young girl, whom Mr. Alessi later 
learned was named 
and instructed Mr. Alessi to stop the car. Maxwell got out 
of the car and went to speak with 
for about 20 to 25 minutes before returning. Later that 
same day, Mr. Alessi saw 
come to Epstein's Palm Beach residence. Over the next 
several months, 
returned just about every day to the Palm Beach residence to give 
Epstein massages. Mr. Alessi recalls learning that 
was also traveling with Epstein to 
other locations, and he recalls 
bringing other girls about her age to the Palm Beach 
residence to massa ge Epstein. Mr. Alessi understood that 
was under the age of 18 but 
did not know what 
was doing in the "massages" with Epstein.
