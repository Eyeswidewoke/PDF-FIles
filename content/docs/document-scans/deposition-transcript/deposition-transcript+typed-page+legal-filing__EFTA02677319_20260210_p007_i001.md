*Modernist Architecture: Designing Race and Sexuality* (Track CJ Since the start of the twentieth 
century. architecture and design have been concerned as much with creating new forms of living 
spaces as new forms of people to occupy them. This course focuses on the contributions early 
twentieth century modernist architecture and interior design have made to the production and 
regulation of modern categories of race. gender and sexuality. We will examine texts across the 
fields of architectural and design studies, histories of sexuality, race, media and communications,

*Science, Technology. Design* (Track M) These three fields form something of a continuum, from 
the pure to the applied, but while science and technology are often studied together as one field. 
design is not often included as a component of that continuum of practices. In part. this course will 
function as an introduction to science and technology studies, covering key authors and 
arguments. In part, it will complicate the narrative of that field a little by introducing the question 
of how science and technology relate to design practices. In short. if technology is applied science, 
can we think of design as applied technology? Such at least might be a starting point. The work of 
Gilbert Simondon and Andre Leroi-Gourhan and Bernard Stieger may help us expand the scope of 
science and technology studies a little to Incorporate design as a fundamental conceptual 
category. Seniors/Juniors only. Juniors must obtain permission from instructor. (Track MI
