3. 
All records pertaining to or referencing Portsmouth, Ohio Attorney Michael 
Mearan. Also include records pertaining to or referencing William Marshall or Mark Eubanks. 
4. 
All records in any informant file in chronological sequence, commencing with the 
present year 2020 through to the earliest date. 
5. 
All records that has 
name, or codename, or 
signature, or initials on them pertaining to any Epstein investigation re ated to Ohio or mentioning 
Ohio, New York, New Jersey, or Palm Beach, Florida. Many cases that I, and law enforcement 
officials, have requested the FBI to investigate issues related to FBI informants and their handlers' 
informant ractices were re ularly dismissed by

Agent in Charge (SA 
At the time, she was an SAC over one of the FBI agents and a BCI agent 
that the DOJ IG's office submitted to the FBI's 1NSD division (a division in which she had 
previously been employed) for further investigation. But not one witness that agreed to cooperate 
with the FBI officials, including former and current law enforcement officials, was contacted by 
the FBI. Moreover, one local low-level informant was willing to provide the location of the body 
of a woman who remains missing, but the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation Agent who was 
on the federal task force. The FBI Agent chose to never contact the informant, who was a 
participant in the woman's homicide. The lead detective on that case was the detective that was 
also on the federal task force with the FBI and BC! Agent mentioned above, and he has since 
resigned from his position after the discovery of misconduct related directly to him. The missing 
victim was a client of the defense attorney who was under investigation for trafficking women to 
Palm Beach, Florida and other states. I suspect these documents' release will shed light on the 
FBI's failures to protect murdered and missing women in Ohio, and those trafficked to Palm 
Beach, Florida, New Jersey and other states. One of Jeffrey Epstein's victims has been recently 
reported to say that she was taken to one of Epstein's associates homes, in Ohio, and assaulted 
there. A lawsuit is pending on this issue. 
6. 
All records pertaining to Epstein victims associated in any way with Ohio or 
pertaining to Ohio, Kentucky or New Jersey that were taken to Palm Beach, Florida or were 
brought from Palm Beach, Florida to other states or countries including which states or countries 
the victims were brought to by Epstein or his associates. 
7. 
All records pertaining to any FBI internal investigations related to Epstein, or 
Epstein and Ohio, whether located in the FBI Inspection Division (FBI-INSD), National and 
Transnational Organized Crime section, Office of Professional Responsibility, Public Corruption 
Division, Units, or Offices, Violent Crime Divisions, FBI Cincinnati Field Division (White Slave 
Trafficking investigation) FBI Cincinnati Field Division Human trafficking investigations, FBI 
Detroit Field Division Extortion Investigation, FBI Cincinnati Field Division Mexican Drug 
Trafficking Organization investigation files, FBI Cincinnati Field Division Violent Gang
