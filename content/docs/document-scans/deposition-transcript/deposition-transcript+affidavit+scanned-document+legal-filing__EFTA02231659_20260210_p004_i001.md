after only 3 months. , no clue . fyi artspace financials are also a total mess. ( no receivables ??). 
when i asked for a list of what got done and did not, i received the email from Brad basicailly 
mind you own business. so much was promised. !!! 
As in your words im one of your closest friends and in order to turn the page. I include the 
following in order to be constructive 
Here is a list of things I think would be in your interest to get done asap .but definitely not by 
me. 
i suggest you form new grats. , hire a high level tax partner. use your trading accounts as they 
remain a paramount requirement 16 months after i emailed you re their importance. THe 
Phaidon transaction papered and structured as contemplated DOES NOT WORK , its as simple 
as that. DOES NOT !! 
I suggest again that you re-do bank loans. no need to pay interest at 
higher rates on boat or plane. . as Richard is now no longer trustee. re- do will, make suydam 
executor , with Barry, and john as back up. pay I million a year for executor role. get rid of 
Judy Black trust, deal with gifts and their tax returns, . review amounts to kids at fixed ages. put 
more protections in for Alex and Victoria. , distribute some money to kids let them make 
decisions. , decide art division with children in attendance . have fire drill done on estate. fill 
out estate returns as if you and Debra died today, choose advisers - rick bronstein said the only 
1040 he ever filled out was his own. 
Halperin has a conflict that should be addressed., A 
strategy of the use of art should be implemented. . you have tax consultants it consultants. plane 
operation consultant. . boat consultants. architects, lighting , art, legal, . foundation , deal with 
TRA , BRH , rationalize investments. cash flow. reporting, gaming disclosures. foreign, gift. . 
prepare tax projections for 15 and 16, . deal with neg basis ( tufts gain, debt financed. art 
partnership, pledges. sell stock , art, deal with phaidon debt. athene,? income , capital , foreign 
, exit, corporate, insurance regs, out and inbound issues, basis, appropriate discount rates. ? 
terminations. control. , qualified dividends. corporate tolls, inversion rules. , grat issues, short 
swing and other sec disclosures, I still think you might consider a Rothshcild bank transaction 
they have 150 b and a distribution network with no products , private bank Rockefeller 
Rothschild. financial service. deal with UK visa issue sooner rather than later. we can talk about 
Rowen request re Athens , complex 2 billion in taxes on transaction. ?! 
since you asked since last nov. 
i found 11 million dollars in dormant accounts. 4 million 
dollars in cilcens drawer. . went through cash flows for phaidon showing that john murphy is not 
an accountant. redid your gagosian contract , . organized structure in case of divorce. set up 
gift trust. stopped ada from including multiple times things not in your interest. dealt with bad 
sales tax use tax income tax . created 8 millino in deductions ,500k in mistakes , found bank of 
scotland fbar problems, . . reorg bad art purchases , funds taken,  charitable decisions , helped 
with fincancial statements, gaming commission. . boat deductions, rescued stock from grats. . 
may 1 after months of brad not finding anyone i sent an email saying you would have to pay 
more. . on april 15. I sent an email detailing payments owed if i could figure out the basis issue, 
ref the email above.
