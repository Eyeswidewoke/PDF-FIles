DUBAI—In the 10 years since RAK Cerami=s opened a $40 million tile manufacturing plant in Iran, the United 
Arab Em=rates-based firm has racked up millions of dollars in losses in the Persian=country, fired hundreds of 
employees and all but extinguished its kilns. 
But this summer Iran struck a nuclear deal wit= the U.S. and other foreign powers. Now with sanctions on 
Tehran expected t= ease, RAK Ceramics is looking to boost output of the kitchen and bathroom t=les it sells in Iran and 
the wider region. Executives for one of the world's largest manufacture=s of tiles and sanitary ware by capacity are now 
betting the long wait on l=an is about to pay off. 
"We were a patient investor," s=ys Abdallah Massaad, RAK Ceramics' chief ex=cutive. 
RAK Ceramics is one of a handful of Arab-owned=firms positioning themselves to profit from a post-sanctions 
neighbor, even=as frosty relations between Iran and most of the Gulf Cooperation Council*=80*Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, 
the U.A.E., Oman, Qatar and Kuwait—show few signs of thawing. 
The week after the U.A.E. joined Saudi Arabian-led airstrikes in April against Iranian-backed Houthi rebels=/a> in 
Yemen, U.A.E.-owne= Etihad Airways launched a daily commercial service to Tehran. Dubai-owned =lyDubai has 
launched seven new routes to Iran this year after a bilateral aviation agreement was signed in Januar= between the 
U.A.E. and Iran. <http://www.wsj.com/articles/=audi-arabia-launches-military-operations-in-yemen-1427275251>

The forays by Gulf businesses, though still in=their infancy, could further complicate political alliances across the 
Midd=e East by deepening commercial ties between Iran and some of its less-hosti=e neighboring states. Such 
developments could begin to shift the region's center of economic gravity from S=udi Arabia, the world's biggest oil 
producer, to Iran, home to an e=ucated and burgeoning middle class. 
As executives from the Gulf are eyeing Iran fo= business opportunities, their governments are locking horns 
elsewhere in t=e region. Saudi Arabian warplanes, supported by the U.A.E., Bahrain, Qatar a=d Kuwait, continue to 
bombard Iran-backed Houthi militants in Yemen. The tiny Gulf island of Bahrain in J=ly pulled its ambassador from Iran in 
protest at alleged Iranian meddling i= its affairs. Gulf-backed rebels also face off against the Iranian-supporte= 
government of President Bashar Al Assad in Syria. 
The foreign ministers of the GCC in August pub=icly backed the nuclear agreement between Iran and world 
powers in meetings with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry <http://www.wsj.com/arti=les/gulf-arab-states-voice-
support-for-iran-nuclear-deal-1438618887> . But some, such as the U=A.E.'s minister of state for foreign affairs, Anwar 
Gargash, have a=so voiced concern that the deal will embolden Iran.
