banks might have exhibited in their ethical standards here, the reality is that the banking crisis had i=s roots in poor 
lending and risk standards, and poor management of loan bo=k funding, rather than wild gambles or duplicity in the 
securities markets= The Vickers Commission explicitly recognised this by focusing on raising capital standards at the 
retail ban=s that make up the backbone of the British credit system. 
Recent huge losses in the Chief Investment Office at J P =organ and conduct like that of Barclays' 
traders have made this di=tinction far too subtle to insist upon politically. This may not matter mu=h in regulatory terms 
— regulators have already embarked on a wide range of securities markets reforms. But it wil= help embed the persistent 
political idea that retail banking is inherentl= 'safe' while investment banking and securities markets business is 
in=erently 'risky'. To which recent events have added the taint of suspect ethical conduct. 
For universal bank leaders who have come out of the secur=ties world, this is likely to be part of 
the challenge of dealing with pol=ticians and regulators over the next few years. Politicians actively quest=oned Mr 
Diamond's credentials to lead a retail bank when he was appointed Barclays CEO in 2011. His departu=e leaves an even 
greater burden on universal bank leaders to understand th= growing political gap between the skillset desired of retail 
bank managem=nt and the caricature of the men and women who make a living on the trading desks. Mr Diamond 
maintained a =lass office on the trading floor at Barcap even after his transition to le=dership of Barclays; a gesture 
heavy with meaning for his critics. </=pan> 
Mr Diamond's instincts were to close this gap by champi=ning a 'citizenship' agenda for 
Barclays. The main problem with this i= not the agenda, or the work that was done by the bank in its name. It was=the 
persistent undermining of this message by the perceived conduct of the bank itself. Not just questions of culture=and 
character raised by the admission that traders had sought to manipulat= LIBOR rates for personal and institutional profit 
and the mis-selling of =ayments insurance and interest rate hedges for small businesses. But also fundamental questions 
over the =ank's business model, the way it rewards its highest earners including M= Diamond himself, its approach to its 
own tax affairs and the 'aggressiv=ness' of the tax services it provides to clients, irrespective of their legality. In this, 
obviously Barclays is=far from alone. 
Politicians are at something of a loss as to how concrete=y to address these issues of values and 
character and this poses a particu=ar challenge for banks. Culture is hard to regulate and the public have no=real 
appetite or patience for reassurances that a renewed rigour from supervisors will fix the problem. The proxies f=r 
culture are going to be pay and senior accountability, and these are the=two things that ultimately tripped up Mr 
Diamond at Barclays. Althou=h many in banking would like to argue that these things are beside the point, politically 
they are the point. 
Like much else in the current banking model, the case for=remuneration levels in banking is 
based purely on the logic and discipline=of the free market for financial services. Yet the bailouts of 2008 and th= LIBOR-
fixing scandal have further exhausted political and regulatory patience with the idea that banking exi=ts in a free market. 
High levels of remuneration are also glaringly at odd= with the wider economic context and the prevailing political 
climate. Geo=ge Osborne, the British Chancellor, has tried to accommodate London-based investment banks by resisting 
the ra=her rigid rules inserted at the last minute by the European Parliament int= the European CRD4 Directive applying 
ratios for fixed and bonus pay at Eu=opean banks. But in doing so he is well aware that he is badly out of step with the 
public mood. 
The accountability problem is as simple and blunt as poli=ics gets. The massive market 
disruptions of 2008 and the ensuing economic =risis have created a latent political desire for personal accountability 
f=om the banking industry that it has so far been unable to meet. In part this is because the most egregiously m=naged 
institutions in the period leading up to 2008 have simply disappeare=. The survivors are generally not inclined to feel 
implicated in the indus=ry's wider collective problems. Mr Diamond always seemed to hint at the indignation of an 
executive whose =ank had survived the banking crisis without direct government support and =ho felt he had little to 
answer for, at least until his employees' malpr=ctice made this untenable. This is part of what made him such a lightning 
rod and figure of resentment for ma=y politicians.
