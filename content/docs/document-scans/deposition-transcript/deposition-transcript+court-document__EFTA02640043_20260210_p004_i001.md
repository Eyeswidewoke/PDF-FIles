successor will be identified soon =t might make sense for me to hold off on any distributions and leave it to the new 
trustee to work with you on figuring all of this o=t. In this regard I'm kind of a "lame duck" =rustee, wouldn't you say? 
=span>4. =C2 
To the extent that you want to push forward wh=le I remain the trustee, let me again 
state the basis for financial disclo=ure by you. It is that, as trustee, I owe a duty to you and I owe a duty to your children 
(as the =emainder beneficiaries of the trusts). For the present my primary du=y is to you and it is to distribute to you all 
income earned by the trusts= net of expenses, and to distribute to you (or pay on your behalf) additional monies as 
reasonably needed t= the extent that your income from other sources is not sufficient to suppo=t your reasonable 
expenses. Notwithstanding your statement that "As for the claim about concern for my later years, that has been 
thoro=ghly refuted" it has not been refuted in the context of my trusteeship and it remains my=duty to consider 
distributions in light of the possibility that you will h=ve a reasonable need for distributions from the trust for many 
more years,=and perhaps in increasing amounts, depending on your circumstances in the future. 
=u> 
=span>5. =C2 
As for the specifics of disclosure, what I nee= to consider is (a) what your income was in 
2017, since that was the basis=for the tax payments you seek to have reimbursed, (b) what your income is likely to be 
this year an= going forward, (c) what your expenses were in 2017 and are likely to be i= 2018, and (d) whether any of 
your income (or other resources) are being u=ed for purposes that the trust cannot support (such as gifts to third 
parties). So far, Rich has pr=vided me with some rough information about your 2017 expenses. There=are some gaps in 
that information, but nothing that can't be clear=d up pretty easily (I think). Rich has also assured me that you have not 
made any gifts that have diminished your resources an= I assume you would confirm that to me. What I don't have at 
this point is enough information about your in=ome, so that I can consider what the gap is between your expenses and 
your=income, which is the gap the trusts might help to close up. With res=ect to your income in 2017, all I can see is 
that your income tax obligations seem to be much higher than they were pre=iously. I'm assuming that reflects a jump 
in income from (i)=the profit made on the sale of the condominium, and (ii) large withdrawals=from your IRA. If you 
want to provide me with more information (bearing in mind what I noted in item #3, above) then inf=rmation about 
your 2017 income and what your income is likely to be this y=ar is what I most need. 
=u> 
I hope this is helpful and will wait to hear=more from you and/or Rich.
