Title: Re: Life 
In NYC apt. Will call now. 
#1. Want to I ask for a year end !von on billings, etc. 
#2. Do I just email my brother and ask for a report on all checks written on estate for last year. I asked lawyer about this a 
number of times and he does not respond 
#3. Spoke to Dr. Harold Klopowitz, famous child shrink...who helped me with 
that I met by accident at hair dresser 
getting a hair cut Sat. He talked to me for half a hour. Will tell later. 
M. Brother going to Palm Beach and using mother's apt for two weeks. Lawyer said to leave it alone. 
#5. Alpine house not selling as is. Only at 2 mil cash. Worth more. Lawyer says take it. Can close in two weeks. Shrink 
and real estate agent said put in 400,000 to clean up interior. New kitchen and baths and sell for 3 mil. People want 
instant gratification to buy a house. There arc starving painters/contractors who do this for 15% of expenses and put a cap 
on spending. Do it now and be ready in April to sell. Nothing sells in dec-feb...even just painting the inside will help. 
06.1= 
on Dec. 22 
Staying in NYC for a week. Jean Pigozzi having a 60th on Jan 2 in Panama estate. Want to go for 4 days. I lave not been 
invited and he is a friend. Asked Tamara Mellon to ask him to invite me. She is. Will be beyond cool. 
People will come from St Berths. I can get j)j)♦o take me in her plane from St Barth on Jan 2...or meet her there Jan 2 
and fly home with her. Have job for FA Schlossberg/gallery art opening Sat. Jan 7.. Also can go to David Koch's for New 
Year's in Palm Bcach..come home Jan 2 with him or go to Panama from Miami. 
#7. Bryan going away for 3 weeks on Friday. Office closed for 2. 
#8. If you are here Tues, Dec. 13th we have Meryl Streep's The Iron Lady premiere. She is amazing at maggie thatcher. 
#9. Went to funeral last week of Yassi Aga Kahn's 25 year old son...so so sad. 
#10. Looks like "The Artist" might win Oscars...HW wants me to work on campaign but go find sponsors to underwrite 
events and pay me...nothing new. Head of production told me HW has money problems again. Has no hits. 
Stephen Daldry's "Extremely Loud Incrediby Close" is possible upset winner, which is Scott Rudin's. Think film was 
finished too late to have impact on academy...do not think Warner's and Scott can beat Ilarvey...b4..cau.se everyone just 
loves "The Artist" and HW has been working this film since Cannes. 
When can we speak?
