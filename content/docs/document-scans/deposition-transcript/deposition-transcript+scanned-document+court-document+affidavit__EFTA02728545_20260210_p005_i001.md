clock in his office facing the briefcase with the money in it. 
Epstein then placed $4,000. in U.S. currency, one hundred dollar 
bill increments and left the bag on his desk as he always does 
when he is in town. Epstein said that he went to bed with the 
camera system monitoring the bag and desk area, only to wake up 
and twice to have $100. missing from the bag and the suspects 
image on his computer hard drive. It should be noted that there 
were thirteen one hundred dollar bills still in the white envelope 
and that nothing else in the house appeared to be disturbed by the 
suspect. 
Epstein took me to the computer room where he showed me a computer 
monitor that was displaying a still frame of the suspect. The 
computer indicated a time of 0428 a.m., when the suspect came into 
the office area, walked behind the desk, opened the hand bag, and 
then opened the center drawer to the desk. It appeared as though 
the suspect was familiar with the house and the desk. Epstein 
told me that he did not know who the suspect in the photo was 
but thought it might be his former houseman because of his size 
and shape. Epstein also pointed out that the suspect in the 
video was wearing moccasin type shoes like his former houseman 
did due to his back injury. The suspect was a white male who 
was 5'10" in height, 250 lbs., wearing tan pants, white shirt, 
and a hat. Epstein provided me with the former houseman's 
information which was 
, DOB pillIllt, living at 
West Pa m Beac , Florida. 
I advised Epstein that I would need to obtain a copy of the 
surveillance video from his computer hard drive in order to 
have in hands. Epstein told me that he had limited working 
knowledge of the system but he would contact the company who 
had installed the system and have them make a copy by Monday. 
Epstein told me he would call when he had more information. 
Epstein took me to the desk where the carry on bag was and told 
me that he believed that the suspect might have gained entry 
into the house from the sliding glass doors on the south side 
of the house but not the west side of house because he had 
personally locked all the sliders on that side of the house. 
It is believed that the suspect also left the house by the 
same sliding door that was unlocked as there were no pry marks 
or indication of forced entry into the house. Epstein also showed 
me the bookcase behind the desk where he kept his Glock 9 mm 
handgun between the books which was now missing. Epstein could 
not supply me with the serial number for the handgun at this 
time but advised he would contact Gator Gun on Okeechobee 
Blvd. to obtain the information.
